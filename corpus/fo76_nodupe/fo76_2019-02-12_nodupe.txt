Looking for it, but till I can pull that source, just consider my comment there to be hearsay. Sorry for confusion.

There is a 20 hour counter, and there are different vendor factions. Let's say you sell 50 caps worth at a raider vendor, then an hour later sold 150. 19 hours later, 50 caps will be available at all raider vendors, then an hour later, another 150 will.
---
My observations lead me to concur. 
---

---
I have noticed when killing some enemies that you see a loot-able inventory straight away but then before you can loot, the items vanish and you have the loot-loading symbol instead. The robots at The Whitesprings are a great example. They have a inventory of loot at 'death' and then a new loot request is made which comes back as no loot. It seems inefficient. 
---
&gt;I fell off the Fallout 76 train pretty quickly after launch because, well, you know.  
---
  
---
lmao
---
that's because it's not. Is battlefield an MMO?
---
SaintNitsu, I personally will not be online until midnight though.

Todd is a gremlin. When they pour water on his back, little Toddlings grow out of his back and they multiplied enough to take over the project.
---
I have sent an email to Bethesda every time this has happened to me. I only finally got a response when I said I didn't appreciate their rudeness in not answering me after I had sent so many emails and uninstalled and reinstalled the game as directed by their bot. I received as snarky email in response staying that they did not have the capability to return my fusion cores, power armor, weapons or caps. Nor could they verify I ever even had them. Basically made me feel like they thought I was lying.
---
If by some slim chance you made all the extra effort to 76 pages because of my comment on your original post, you are a legend and these are amazing! Seriously fantastic job and 76 for 76 just sounds awesome!
---
OP is doing God's work here. This is the kind of data to really respect. Ty OP!
---
Ah, completely missed that one. The first one auto opened and started playing for me.
---
Looks real good.
---
My do you or we care if someone is using a level up mod on a fame where level doesnt mean anything?
---
I think the game has a lot going for it really, the writers and people setting up the world did a great job at it. I'm very interested to see what the future DLC brings and how they'll move things forward (Though of course making the game more stable and giving me a dog would be super cool)
---
I put the blinking light in it. Looks awesome in a thunderstorm. Creepy. 
---
This seems to be the right place for me. 
---
I don't like using power armor all of the time but I know the mod you mean.  They just didn't bring it over from fallout 4, I guess 
---
Added ya.  Will be online in 5 minutes 
---
I wanted any effort up front.
---
It was a good idea, and I didnt have a clear plan for when to finish this - it was lots of fun though, not a chore at all doing 76. I could have done a 100 if I had the free time. So thanks for the idea!
---
Investigate a little more actively please
---
report to bethesda. They are the ones that will do anything
---
Infinite Perk Card packs and perks, the ability to infinitley respec all of you specials and get new perks. Not fair to other players. 
---
&gt;join our camps together to form Voltron
---
Now this is all I want :(
---
Rule number 9, no witch hunting.
---
Reported to both Xbox and Bethesda. 
---
Bethesda's response: "but fortnite though!" 
---
Player base: "why would we want to pay for a buggy game with broken pvp when we can play fortnite for free?! We want fallout!" 
---
Bethesda: "because fortnite! And we already got your money haha!" 
---
He is not witch hunting.
---
People are ass holes in any online game. Judging a game based on the activities of players is a poor way to judge a game. 
---
The community managers have mentioned before that the next content update happens in March. 
---
Because mods are against the law.
---
Putting other players names are not aloud on here i think.  Try pacifist mode to help u to avoid pvp. It could of been a super mutant hoard 
---
Even WoW has some things that change as you do them, literally nothing in this game does for more than an hour.
---
My guess would be that this was the intent for the second floor of Top of The World, but, like many other things intended for this game, weren't feasible for whatever reasons.
---
Perhaps second floor was intended to be locked until you completed Rose's quest line. 
---
I'm the kind  of player who likes to get out there and explore, and basically experience everything the game has to offer. I don't just go to an event because it's a legendary or  XP farming hotspot. When you play the game like that, you very quickly become aware of how broken it is.
---
So this is a low health Bloodied build, not a dedicated one so the mad thing is that this would probably go higher, notice the +1 Strength minor mod on the sword. Your health needs to be below 20% and rads need to be pushing behind at below 20%, then get radicool and bloody mess perk cards maxed, Strength needs to be maxed and overflowing via buffs like unyielding armor and solar powered maxed, enclave shielded under armor then just cheat with chems and food, fury gives like +30% melee damage, get the deathclaw wellington for plus strength and so on but this is the madness of the bloodied low health build, you will get hit more so if in power armor get the emergency Protocols mod so incoming dmg is halved by 50% and get scaly skin for dmg resistance, max out the adrenaline card :) 
---
Calling out a player by name, accusing them of hacking and having no real evidence. That's witch hunting.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

I like this idea however you have to think about this in a corporate standpoint. How much money would it cost them to bring on another company. 76 would probably be a better game but how much would they have to invest and how much would the return be? It‚Äôs very sad because this all could have been prevented. There‚Äôs still a small part of me that hopes they will straighten everything out though ü§î
---
Not sure.   It had a good variety of stuff I use on occasion like .308, .44, .45, 10mm and even some shotgun shells.   Also, whenever I see lower level characters, I drop them a couple hundred rounds of the most popular ammo.  They're usually pretty happy.  So, you're feeding into my own pass-it-on-isms. 
---
Then that is all you can do. You are more likely to get shit from people on this sub reddit. So no point in posting anymore. 
---
So when people kill you, you only drop the "Junk" loot right? Or everything on you? 
---
I really hated PA in fallout 4 for some reason but i like it more in this game. Most of the time im not using PA except nuke zones or when i want to fly with my jetpack lol
---
Sandbox, sandbox, sandbox! Add more sandbox content!

I apologize, I have removed his name from the post.

^ What he said. Apparel cannot be equipped to the favourite 'wheel', only weapons and aid can be.
---
So no, I don't think there is a faster way to equip it unfortunately.
---
Got any plastic farming sources? Do you know about the crazy cat person house with like 50 cat bowls in it?
---
Great question. I am at level 25 and I am wondering what level I can solo ‚Äúhandle things‚Äù at. I feel like I am 2/3rds of the way into the campaign maybe? What level do people complete the campaign at? I can‚Äôt win at scorchbeast. 
---
Why does every MMO do storytelling so much better?
---
Life support functions such as air recycling were set to auto shutdown 24 hours after the vault doors open for Reclamation Day. Vault-tec knew dwellers could become too complacent and comfortable with the *good life* in a vault so forced them to move out that way as a failsafe.
---
Very similar to the WhiteSprings in a way, the ole 'you don't have to go home but you can't stay here'.
---
Hmmm... no i dont..... lmao
---
cross platform play would be so much better for it too
---
This is fantastic. It's great you've enjoyed making them so much, I know I've enjoyed reading each and every one so thank you.
---
Fuck yeah man.
---
I mean, how could they so royally fuck up a game that‚Äôs adored by millions and which we want so badly that we‚Äôre still trying despite it being a total shit show?
---
Some asshole board members in charge of Bethesda obviously thought they could force an incomplete product in development out to be a fallout fortnite after seeing how much cash that game made.
---
Problem is, fortnite is a one off.  It wAs mostly original (sorry pubg, but you should be suing them already. I feel you) game that doesn‚Äôt carry over to every fucking title.
---
Fallout is not AND Never will be, a battle royals game.
---
We fallout because we love what we can do in it, and that‚Äôs not play 5 minute pvp matches.
---
Fuck that shit.
---
 I hope those board members get removed from any position of influence Purely from a stance of incompetence compounded by no knowledge of what their customers want.
---
I had saved up 15 level ups for the last nerf. I'm nowhere near my dps but I'm close. 
---
Half my build is weight reduction though which is lame
---
I don't think they have the skill or experience to pull it off.  With every iteration of updates that result in fixing some things and breaking other things, I'm more convinced that the dev team lacks experience.
---
Absolutely correct it would even it out and energy weapons just need some love, although on the flipside to this coin I'm running into the most dangerous situations in the game with low health build @ 10% health and a Chinese officers sword :/
---
I have spent the last 4 hours trying to battle through site Charlie to get to launch my first nuke. I‚Äôve gotten as far as to repair pipes, server crash. Then come back and start all over again with Bio cards and all this bullshit. It‚Äôs fucking infuriating. 
---
Alt + F4
---
Almost all of my ammo and just about anything I can grab.. 
---
This is incredible and the people who are currently helming the whatever you wanna call it.... development ? Is that what we can call it at this point? of this game don‚Äôt deserve you in the slightest.
---
I hope someone on the dev/management team sees this amazing piece of work you‚Äôve created and clearly labored over and goes ‚Äúfuck we should step our game up‚Äù
---
Heck, there are stills out in Appalachia, for crying out loud.  I've come across at least 2 of them if not more! 
---
Maxed Animal Friend perk. So I can pacify them and they leave me alone.
---
Only junk

^^This^^
---
I assume it follows [Fallout 4's resistance formulas](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Fallout_4), where the ratio between the weapon damage and armor is used when calculating the percentage that passes through it.
---
With all those weapons you're losing more than half your damage to resistance, and lower damage weapons fare even worse.
---
And then melee has this:
---
&gt; Incisor rank 3: Your melee weapons ignore 75% of your target's armor.
---
Played Diablo 3 with one of my best friends who commited suicide havnt been able to play since.. know all to well where you are coming from 
---
Sorry. Only accepting complete runewords.  I need my barb to teleport man.
---
Imagine being a triple A developer with millions and millions of dollars with a team of ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù and not being able to release a game that doesn‚Äôt have disappearing items or not being able to fix that bug 3 months after release. Yikes.  
---
I've gotten really fond of the Gauss Rifle.  Spent a long time learning the mods, getting kitted out, loading up on rifle perks, and now I finally feel like they're actually fun to hunt.
---
Yep, 24 players, 24 vending machines, all in one spot.
---
And you could server hop to the next server and you'd be right there next to 24 new player vendors to shop :)
---
Games not even half finished. Wtf would you even think it has replay ability when it doesn‚Äôt even play once?
---
I know! I just like the idea of doing all the things! 
---
Upgraded T-60 has a very good balance of resistances (Physical/Energy/Rad), **mod availability** and **cheap repair/upgrade costs**. 
---
There is a small pond near the snake icon on the map in the south of the Whitespring golf area that spawns 3 to 5 mirelurks. Sometimes there is a legendary and sometimes there are strangler mirelurks. I have a base there and it's a natural spawn point so they respawn when anyone travels to me or enters the area. Have been hunting this disease for a long time and will be looking for that diseased variety until I find it now. Thank you so very very much. 
---
That's just his chosen operandi.   üòé

According to Bethesda, marine combat Armour is second only to pa.

---
Thank you! Not quite sure yet what the name means but I subscribed. It seems a lot of people, like me, who are enjoying the game and not getting all worked up!
---
Maybe... in/around a Vault?  Like how Vault City was a bustling hub of human life thanks to a GECK and lots of effort to grow and sustain a city?
---
I‚Äôm not talking from ‚Äúneeding this many people to be able to do this certain quest‚Äù, I‚Äôm talking about people saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt find the home fun, then just find friends to play it with. That‚Äôll make it more fun‚Äù 
---
I created a spreadsheet with a list of the materials used for everything I actually care about and use it to help me decide what junk to keep:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11FvMkF9OzwqNCYCQVjsZgeE9dB9ht5F3wCXi8frY7Qo
---
I believe it counts as animals since you have the option to pacify them now
---
Bugs every damn time you don‚Äôt wait 3 minutes for the server to finish loading every goddamn item on it.
---
OMFG, such shit design,  
---
Leave server and then wait it out and hopefully your not at whitesprings or your already protected from radiation .
---
Only 6 artillery?
---
I think the problem is scale.  If there are 500,000 players playing, you'd have each server trying to pull ALL of those items into your server to display.  Then a player in X server clicks BUY the same time you click BUY in two different worlds.........who gets the item?  The shut down the extra MODUS vendors because people were abusing it to dupe items (one guy deposits, 3 guys try to buy, boom 3 duped weapons).  I imagine that will only be increased because of lag between the servers.
---
Plus it would be painful to look through.  Imagine the lag as your terminal consults some database with 50,000,000 items in it.
---
It would take you 10 or so mins to search all 24 terminals, then 1 server hop, then 10 more mins.  I think the servers can handle that better than trying to draw a global database every time someone even "touches" a terminal.
---
No, I leave the helpful threads alone. This was clearly a gripe post circle jerk, so I participated.
---
I started putting stuff in the cash register too.  It was a suggestion here and I liked it.
---
But why come back?
---
Over the next four months a TON of games are coming out. 
---
Two of them being direct GaaS competitors (Division 2 and Anthem). 
---
It‚Äôs taken them 3 months to get this far. In 3 more months I‚Äôll have played 
---
* Anthem
---
*Division 2
---
* Metro Exodus
---
* Crackdown 3 (game pass, why not?)
---
* Mortal Kombat 11
---
* DMC5
---
* Sekiro
---
* Far Cry New Dawn
---
* Days Gone
---
* Rage 2
---
* Dreams (maybe)
---
good luck
---
You're not reading the statistic right. The bias you've introduced is conflating the playerbase that interacts with a game online (\~\~20%) with the part playerbase that never does (\~\~80%).   
---
Someone here linked a source a few days back. 
---
The vocal demand for PvP you're hearing isn't equally prevalent between those 20% and 80%. And your trophy statistic represents everyone. 
---
Would only have access to auction posts from those individuals on your specific server at the time, would be nice if they could figure a way to include posts from other servers, but i figure if wow never did that there is a damn good reason
---
Yes on orbital. Don't know about artillery. 
---
Power armor pieces can be favorited tho. I have three I swap between depending on the fight.
---
Thanks!
---
Appreciate the info!
---
Unless they‚Äôre afk at a vendor. That‚Äôs no bueno, and makes me irrationally irritated. 
---
My friend, I wasted several hundred hours for what you can now buy for 5,600 caps....  
---
    
---
Calibrated shock plans were at the high point of TSE value, 25k - 40k.  
---
I wouldn't whine about a piddling 6k, compared to what everyone else went through to get the ability to make them, hell if it's that much a deal breaker farm the vendors for the mods, they are like 400 caps. 
---
My tse unequips itself from the fav wheel every time I fast travel.  My power armor pieces also unequip themselves every fast travel.  Knock wood haven't lost anything yet but I'm constantly surprised b it hasn't happened yet.  Knock wood.
---
You don't need them all. 
---
Not flagging you as wanted because a shotgun pellet glances someone would be a plus. 
---
Ya always call out on discord or reddit. Get a group together ready. Everyone does a little so no one has to use a lot of resources. Give ppl a rough 15-20min heads up next time.
---
Also another hugh tip: do not center your nuke blast on prime! Just keep prime within the blast reach. This way you can fight SBQ outside the nuke zone. Make it s touch easier 
---
DLC will be them making you pay to get bug fixes and general game design tweaked along with a few things they again will cut n paste from other fallout games, because they evidently think they can get away with anything,
---
Helps if you add the platform ;)
---

---
This seems relevant between Fallout 76, the myriad of Skyrim poets and the paid mods. 
---
I use a handmade to get their attention and then switch to a prime two shot pump shotgun when they land. I aim where the wing meets the body so the enforcer perk with cripple it and then it's shots to the face until it's over.

ps4 sorry

I'm level 20. Sometimes I'm on with my bf (level 36).

I get a pop up on my phone saying this is trending and it‚Äôs deleted.... cool reddit 
---
Dude, you gotta cut them some slack. Right now the entire studio is 4 underpaid programmers and 28 managers, with whips and chains, trying to whip 32 programmers' worth of code out of them. 
---
I feel this post deep in my spirit, lmao. I literally just bought my Excavator CS plans today too and then found out it needed violet flux. Wasn‚Äôt expecting that. Waiting for some nukes to drop now, lol. 
---
Keep at it! Give all the solo players a reason to keep plugging on!!
---
I enjoy Speed Demon...just about the only thing I would add there.
---
I waited 4 hours for this and it was worth it.  +1.
---
I‚Äôve had my guy parked in station there for 8 months now.
---
Every time I go out, I get blasted to bits n robbed blind.
---
Fuckers. I really miss my wormhole.
---
I got a level 6 dude. Sure could use  the caps! But only if I can kill you with a drill.  Since we are using garage tools, we should commit said act in a red rocket. 
---
To be useful a player hub should be independent of the servers themselves - should be able to support hundreds of people. The logical choice would be vault 76, but not the resident vault. Instead, make it a conversion of a visitors center that was established before the war.
---
When you sign in it should remember the server you came from - but that‚Äôs a whole nother topic.
---
ahhhh this is gonna be a learning curve..but any junk that u pick up..if it only provides steel, wood, plastic (something really common) u dont have to necessarily scrap it because it is so easy to come by..so if it contains something like lead, aluminum, screws, gear, springs, ballistic fiber...scrap it and then stash it..all the other common stuff i just sell it to vendors..***so dont use the scrap all feature!! try to do it individually..
---
another thing is look at your apprael..armor is heavy..anything that is easily replacable just sell it
---
Flux capacitor of course...and some plutonium.
---
He can then go back and kill the dude pre trade to get out of this.
---
Ok.  That does sound good. 
---
Nice of you to assume they are even trying to do that.
---
1)Probably not the same team of people working on the clothes and prop design as the people who fix bugs with inventory and enemy AI
---
2) Most of the Atom shop stuff was probably designed, created, and queued up from the day the game was launched.
---
Pain train works poorly.  
---
-Damage is comically low.  
---
-Stagger does not seem to effect most creatures.  
---
-Nothing I've seen seems to effect it in a positive way, but I'll be honest I've not looked at the game files on this perk.
---
-Harms Friendly NPCs (reported bug) resulting in hostility.. I suggest not having it on at WhiteSprings, Enclave bunker, etc.  
---
There are a few Fallout 4 mods that make Pain Train worth it, but it appears Bethesda did not import the changes from any of them.
---
Whatever happened to people getting killed in a game, analyzing what they could have done better, and move on?  If one death makes you want to quit then you are terrible at dealing with a challenge.  Relax, take a break, and come back to the game when you are ready.  
---
How the fuck does the underground Enclave bunker exit to the third floor of the Whitesprings when the resort exit is on the lowest reachable level? Is it an elevator disguised as the door or something?
---
Posted about a dozen times already ;)
---
Are those your illustrations? Because that art is gorgeous.
---
Depends if you group often? If so Herd Mentality is exceptional 
---
I had almost the same experience with the T-60. Got the mod, then the plan, then realized the need for flux, but honestly the challenge to get flux was really fun. It pushed me to start going into nuke zones, which ended up being a fun challenge... if only people would start nuking Whitespring again for the non-plant parts. 
---
So, sorry for your pain, but good luck. It'll all be worth it when you have the carrying capacity of a tractor trailer. 
---
That has to be my biggest problem. I mean they could do so much better but I feel like the fallout fans are just Bethesda's side-chick when we all know they are too in love with ES to give us any attention. 
---
technically yea but the second is reduced so its not a full two shots. Its like a 1.25 shot. They should make it a three shot. 
---
This is the best answer if you're not looking for a *specific* event. Wander into Grafton, Morgantown, Flatwoods, Sutton, etc. Player proximity is what signals an event to start, so why not be that player?
---
Agree, but I think Bethesda wanted to leave an area for newer players to explore safely 
---
I do group all the time.  
---
plastic is the main thing i run out of..always on the hunt for plastic
---
Yeah. Sadly train stations are not very safe since it's a location that you're pretty likely to have bulk junk (though usually worthless stuff). I got killed once and learned that lesson. I hope it doesn't put you off too badly. I haven't found it to happen often, but it does happen. 
---
How is carnivore? I've bought it but it's just sitting in my stash. How does it work? Can you no eat ANY dish with a fruit or veg? Like radstag stew has meat and veg.. nay or yea? Corn soup is for sure a no. Is it greyed out? Can you still eat it but you don't get the benefits? 
---
Great work, thanks for sharing. It's pretty sad to see a wonderful and creative post like this getting less than a hundred upvotes while repetitive shitty complaining posts get hundreds or thousands. Hopefully the appreciation rises with time. xD
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Agreed, having to disrobe of the PA when in the Whitespring or the bunker is bonkers. 
---
Yea... no kidding...they told me it was "Bait and Switch" SMH....
---
Is this the one you get in by accident by joining the radrat horde event in the Savage Divide? 
---
I haven‚Äôt played since I got them.  I did this last night before bed.  I‚Äôll have to reply later.  
---
&gt;practicality there is very little chance you‚Äôd get that far without dying repeatedly
---
Well now that you've posted you were wrong maybe you've be able to rub two braincells together to figure out the entire point of my post instead of being upset and calling it trolling.
---
man! Here I was thinking I was going to be 1st for once. 
---
Thanks :/
---
My guess is they half assed implemented some d2-esq anti duper feature to remove items and its escaped its cage.
---
I love love... The idea of a player hub. Maybe something the overseer got to, Or some secret underground junky looking facility. No humans yet? Okay how about it ran by an acquaintance of grahm that greets you, a robot who got uploaded with the persona of a super hero or something. Would be exciting. Love this game, but even I can admit its time for a little more. 
---
 
---
Player vendors at camps could work. They did it in Star Wars Galaxies. The thing that would need to happen though is persistent player cities which would be goddamned awesome. A server list would HAVE to be visible for this to happen. 
---
Just got the game recently too (since it was on sale) and have been playing it with my step-son.
---
Been having a blast despite a couple of bad experiences with other players (someone randomly blasted me in the back with a gun when I was at a trader bot in the first town - took off half my health!)
---
The server disconnections have been a pain, but the game is fun. Just exploring with my son and finding things in the world has been great. 
---
Yeah I have been having this issue a lot as well
---
It is great! Well worth it! But yes you don't get the benefits of veggies. But meat is well worth it. Plus no chance of disease. 
---
i need the speed demon recipe
---
Deep pocketed marine combat Armour plans still on vendors. Saw one last night for like 1800 caps.
---
Has anyone had any luck with heat flashes or rattle hands?
---
Be smart about it though.  I don‚Äôt bulk anything that already has value to vendors.  If it‚Äôs zero value I will bulk it.  I also focus more on bulking items worth the most bulked.  
---
Here's [some testing](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aedxlm/hard_numbers_on_armor_piercing_qualities_data_for/) I did, and the comments include a table of the AP values extracted from the game files, along with an explanation of the damage calc, extra damage, the maximum effectiveness, etc. 
---
And then gets fired because he's redundant. Which is part of the reason most developers don't take ideas (even good ones) offered by us randoms online.   
---
Another reason would be, well, who the fuck wants to be told how to do their job? If I got work in a dev studio I'd be following my own vision. xD
---
And then the acid trip started to wind down...
---
dude. Stop thinking ur the chosen one cuz u experienced a bug a few months back. I explored the map in the first week, did all the quests and by the point of beyond lvl 50. I began working on my build. I was more interested in the games pvp. After finding the right weapons for my build. All I did was pvp and SBQ. Urnanium fever and the wendigo ones have garuenteed 3*. Plus they are not too long. It isn't about one person leading the other. It really boils down to common sense and time management. No, I am not going to do the messenger quest expecting anything good from it and the heart of the swamp is an ammo sink for little benefit, which is still a small chance of finding legendaries. Workshops also give u loads of events, so while pvping, you accomplish loads of events at the same time.  
---
I‚Äôm not wrong, we‚Äôre talking about two different things. I‚Äôm talking about going solo, you‚Äôre talking about getting carried by a team of people.  Also if you‚Äôre going to be this nit-picky, you used the wrong form of ‚Äúyou‚Äù in the same sentence that you said I have two brain cells. But please, continue this pointless conversation.
---
I don't think so, but it's really hard to tell!
---
Wait, what? I've fought a bunch of level 50-70 monsters and killed them without trouble using a damage 150 weapon. You absolutely do not need 250 damage weapons after level 50...
---
Developers don't balance damage based on endgame bosses dude...
---
I‚Äôve had to deal with this constantly on ps4.  Its fucking irritating as hell,
---
Prime Level 50 Two Shot (er, 1.25 shot) Gatling Gun with max heavy weapons, martial artist 3, tenderizer 3, stabilized 3, one gun army 3, and bloody mess 3. And adrenaline 5 to boost damage after wiping out any summoned support scorched.
---
Not really when the game is billed as a 'Game As A Service". That means you provide on going service to the game and detailed updates on what is coming. Right now they've delivered a game as though it is offline. They've tried to use their previous game launches and it doesn't work.

 Love the game despite the obvious issues BUT he hit this nail square on the head. I do agree with the over zealous nerf that didn‚Äôt fix anything...nerfpocalypse certainly took the steam out of my game. PvP isn‚Äôt fun, Survival mode won‚Äôt be successful, the community ‚ÄúRebuilding‚Äù we were promised doesn‚Äôt seem to be having, so...I play solo, trying to find new things to keep my attention just for the love of Appalachia 
---
With just rad worms I killed a level 62 ghoul by standing next to it using Plague Walker. It took about 5 minutes :-)
---
hmmm. sure. follow your own vision is always the way to go. In bethesda's case. I don't think they have the right vision for things lol.
---
I don't know how other games do their auction house systems but they should do it like them where it just works correctly
---
Thank you, I am on PS4 but you have helped quite a bit by getting Bethesda‚Äôs attention. Thank you!!
---
Not trying to rain on your parade, just wanted to warn before the hate train / downvotes start piling on
---
Wow.  I had no idea about that!  Guess I was lucky to to find the 300-400 cap cs mod when I did.   
---
Where we‚Äôre going we don‚Äôt need flux. 
---
D2 will forever be Diablo 2
---
I think that I want a 'hangry' prefix: more damage and or faster fire/reload rate the hungrier you are
---
Well if you feel like traveling together, my PSN is Vampyreguardian. 
---
Even if we do separate goals, that's cool. I run out of minutes speaking to people as well. I also don't feel the need to fill silence. We also don't need to be on mic. 
---
If you want to join up for big events like Nuke events. I'm game, if you wanna do dailies, sweet. If we have a common mission and we only do that mission together, cool. If we are on a team in the same world but not working together the whole time. That's cool too üôÇ. If you need supplies or anything, I'm willing to share for free. My payment is having fun with a new friend. 
---
No pressure. I also won't assume I can just join you, I'd ask via the messanger. I have friends that I just join up with but I've been playing with them for a long time. I always ask the first few times. 
---
Will there be candy?
---
Or id software! You know the company that Zenimax owns. Imagine Doom shooting in Fallout.
---
I keep seeing pacifist mode. But I can't find it anywhere. Looked in settings and other menus and don't see it anywhere. I have hate PVP in this game also. So far it's been nothing but players with 3 times my lvl attacking for my loot. That will ruin this game if it continues.
---
Yes we will be busy collecting plants! Lol
---
The first time I went there, I legit thought that's what it was going to be. Until I found some ghouls, and not much else. The space is definitely underutilized.
---
Is it a spoiler to advance what are the critical bugs you plan to solve first?
---
To repair sneak when? (I quit exploring for this), 
---
Rad worms messing everything repaired when?
---
And server stability improved? (terrible in my area, central EU)
---
you're....another you're....and punctuation
---
&gt; I‚Äôm talking about going solo
---
that's real obvious from all the times you mentioned Solo in your post lmao
---
&gt;Also if you‚Äôre going to be this nit-picky,
---
what's the difference between 1 and 14 again?
---
You said literally nothing and admitted you were just being pedantic
---
&gt;please, continue this pointless conversation.
---
You're super upset over never helping people rush the main story line when all i'm doing is agreeing with you.
---
I‚Äôm at Charlie and I‚Äôve been here all frickin day trying to fight the robots, bugs and server disconnects. Hillbilly202 on PSN. 
---
Thank you!   Yes there will be a payoff. 
---
Actually, what I said was that less than 10% of the game owners on PlayStation and less than 5% of the game owners on Xbox have killed 20 or more players since the game servers opened.
---
You can try to spin that any way you want, but what it simply says is that more than 90% of people that own the game on console have not killed 20 or more people.
---
I'm running everything above minus talons. And I added grounded, speed demon, super great! Electrically charged, bird bones, twisted muscles, unstable isotope, and adrenal reaction. With a maxed out class freak negates almost all negatives. Completely changed my game! 
---
**Workshops** should evolve into settlements which can be joined by multiple players.  They are already revealed on the map when owned.  If you allow for some kind of persistence at Workshops across logins, then you have a natural draw for players to build there.  
---
Hey Beth! If you‚Äôre not doing anything constructive, run into the living room and get my stogies. 
---
That‚Äôs what I am thinking too!
---
I think their vision is fine for the most part. I'd say the bigger problem is rate of production and polish. Imagine if the vault content was releasing soon and the patches were all smoother, there would probably be no complaining about Survival Mode at all. And while it's easy to say they're stupid for prioritizing PVP, it's hard to tell if that's really the case or if the PVP stuff is just easier for them to do, or maybe the team working on it is more effective. Stuff like that.
---
 Suffering from the same issues. Given up now, and waiting for a patch. The crashes and disconnects are so bad and the game doesn‚Äôt save progress nearly frequently enough sometimes. 
---
I feel like prime recievers should be the strongest in the game, they should be better than hardened and powerful automatic recievers against normal enemies
---
Lvl? Do sbq or pvp?
---
battlefield isnt an mmo but it isnt an 'mmolite'
---
this is literally the same shit i was just talking about where people get really pedantic over the definition of mmo
---
by your definition wow isnt even an mmo because of sharding
---
There is some few details you missed. The loot on mobs are generated to all players that contributeday on the kill and then filtered to you. Leading to some bugs where you can see other ppl loot, and you can't interact. Aldo that my be the reason why nukes tend to have stupid long loot timers
---
I'll kill ya
---
Lots of the people here played the beta including myself. It‚Äôs not new. Always has been a big problem.
---
Good artist team.  Shit programming team.
---
How would I award people atoms? They only come from challenges or buying them. I see nothing wrong with adding some "achievements" for flavor with a small reward.
---
no player hub is needed if you just improve pacifist mode to disable PVP in general IMO. it should
---
\- Disable taking and dealing slap damage
---
\- make your camp immune to PVP damage
---
\- disable dealing damage to other people's workshop items, even if un-owned
---
\- prevent you from claiming workshops unless you turn it off
---
\- make your name and health bar a bright blue color, to identify pacifist mode
---
You still have it. Maybe it got stored? Or maybe destroyed?
---
*nod*  
---
It's why allot of the people who had invested time into become power armor specialists did the "I'm quitting" bit,'I've got close to 500,000'ish caps invested into the power armor mods I have learned (shocks for all, Jetpacks for all that could take it, reactive plates etc etc) and countless hours...  
---
   
---
And then with one patch Bethesda invalidates all the hard work, all of the invested caps, etc.   
---
I mean I'd love to get back that Bloodied Explosive Weight reduction Gatling gun I trade for X, and the AntiArmor Explosive Per combat shotgun I traded for Y, etc etc etx
---
when i look for it in the stash box menu its not there..i dont think it is in my stored items but will check later..thnx
---
I can (melee) one hit kill anything except for the mirelurk queen and ofc the SBQ. If I moved perk cards around, and SPECIAL points, I could probably OHK the mirelurk queen but I don't feel like putting 5 points into adrenaline, usually 1 point is enough for mobbing.
---
Don't bother with missiles at all, Get that Bandolier perk, Bulk your junk.
---
Do AP magazines do reduced damage to non-armored enemies? I'm thinking not, right? In reality it should since AP would pass right through an unarmored target (depending on the speed of the bullet and how dense the tissue is, but in a very general sense and just comparing to non-AP ammo, anyway). If it doesn't reduce damage to non-armored targets, then yeah, definitely worth investing in. I have it on my hunting rifle, but not others. Guess it's time to upgrade.
---
Pain train knocking the shit out of enemies in fo4 was awesome. I loved playing melee and being a big mean old bruiser. I agree it's a tad weak in 76 and the fact friendlies are hit is such a huge liability I don't bother.
---
I have one for sale! Xbox, GT is Kaise7en
---
I dont know whats going on with inventory, but a new power armor frame popped up in my stash and when i put it out in the world it was a full set of lvl 45 raiders. i'm not complaining, but im honestly so confused?
---
And this is why we support cat killers now.
---
Where‚Äôs peta!!!?
---
No that's vault 63 I believe
---
The faster reload really helps! 
---
Use one of the mods or vanilla?   
---
Only ask because I didn't think PT was worth it without the mod
---
Awesome, sounds great, I‚Äôll add you! Anyone else who‚Äôs read my above post and doesn‚Äôt mind is free to add me as well: SrtaTacoMal.
---
Keep in mind the negative effects and grab class freak I think ... not sure what the specific title is. Luck card.
---
Can't honestly disagree with that
---
Notice: Bethesda stated using exploits is a bannable offense. Be smart and don't do this. 
---
worked like a charm!
---
The short answer is you shouldn‚Äôt. The game was simply not ready and it was released anyway. I uninstalled it and unless there‚Äôs a serious QoL change with the game, it‚Äôs never getting reinstalled. Lesson learned here. Bethesda is never getting another pre-order or immediate post launch purchase from me until the dust has settled and a solid set of reviews are out. No wonder they opted not to sell the game on Steam, the refunds would have been astronomical.
---
But fallout not profitable?  
---
I mean, fuck, they could just outright sell the ip separate from the game engine and still roll in the cash.
---
You're the kind of people I like. Thank you for being optimistic
---
I will become a can of stew, do I get to wear power armor O.o
---
thx bruh - but ps4 :(
---
Did he have a big iron on his hip?!?
---
He really likes you.
---
I bet that loot spinning is a big rewrite that has been  in the works for a while now. 
---
3 star legendaries with the exact 3 legendary affixes.
---
In other words, a handful of duped weapons.
---
Again, all rise is the best 2h melee weapon in game...if you don‚Äôt cheat.
---
I should note I agree with this, and I was glad when they patched it out, and then less glad when they patched it back in. :(
---
FWIW, these are generally available .ini settings, so my concern is that it's less an exploit, and more just configuring the game's settings, same as setting fullscreen in the .ini. The sooner they can patch these out, the better.
---
1. By that logic, I never mentioned going in a team so that doesn‚Äôt exactly help your case either.
---
2. Considering the majority of the weapons in the game require you to at least be level 5 to use them, there‚Äôs a considerable difference between 1 and 14.
---
3. Yes, I‚Äôm going to correct you on a very small point because that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre doing here even though I‚Äôve explained my meaning in every single comment since.
---
4. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve agreed with a single thing I‚Äôve said so far.
---
I‚Äôm blocking you now, this conversation is over even though I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd love to waste more of my time.
---
That‚Äôs not really a bad experience. Just the game. 
---
i just want to be able to build a camp closer to a person on my friends list than what i usually would be able to do. 
---
Yes my character is making the "ouch" sound, this happens a lot while running about, I slam into an invisible wall and get blood spatters, the damage in this case is not noticeable.
---
While I get the dying 'bug' my guy is constantly grunting while taking damage.
---
This bug clearly does exist though. 
---
It likely isn't user error entirely. It is likely the bug similar to the hopper box that is still unfixed I believe with the "Feed the people" mission. Where you can accidentally put your items in the hopper if you click too quickly. The game appears to lock it only to the meat products (visually too) but then throws a curveball with one line of your inventory loading near the end. If you click too fast you lose your inventory item.
---
Now some people may chime in like some asshole "Well don't click too fast". That may be a bandaid to an issue that occurs with the UI in this game on other features similar to the hopper bug. Yet this is something that ultimately NEEDS FIXING. Otherwise it can cause other serious issues down the road for the game. 
---
This is amazing work. I might be dense if you said the same thing but isn‚Äôt the conclusion stinging mag the best bc combo of armor pierce plus mag size? For the handmade I just hate a 10 round mag for fighting anything but one or two enemies 
---
Wow! I never thought to do that, I have a fast melee built so I'll go ape shit with my bowie knife :)
---
It is still happening. For the main mission with Rose and her karma syringer you have to kill a yao guai...well that f*ck er is invisible. It told me danger and then I got pummeled to death. Twice. Exiting out of the game and restarting did fix it.
---
Yes guys I always run a max build so keep topped up with fluids and meat as I have carnivore mutation, makes no difference, still want to die :(
---
Invisible Wendingos, that would be cool actually.
---
80 cents will get you a player icon and that's it, to my understanding. For as big of a hassle as it is that sounds really petty.
---
(Insert ‚Äúwait. thats illegal.‚Äù Meme here)
---
What are it's 3 star effects?
---
It‚Äôll just a a silo run, disguised as a vault. Groups of robots here and there, some random task, final boss battle at the end. Done.  
---
There really is no AI. Mobs aggro... then run directly for you often breaking land speed records!!!
---
Mobs don't "think" in anyway. So combat is a mindless DPS race.  So many fails. So much potential wasted. I am past feeling disappointed or sad, I am just mad.
---
The Fallout Franchise deserved better than this.
---
Could you share this location? I would like to explore it.
---
A shit fest.
---
Maybe poison then from different critters, no way to make my health immutable against poison damage? I have Vaccinated perk at 3\* but that doesn't mention poisons.
---
Thanks for your useless post about the current state of the game :-)
---
Try to, gets the mouse and keyboard all sticky though :(
---
Yes always full up as a max build.
---
Scorchbeasts NEED to land so melee buildds can do something. It's all good saying spec in V.A.T.S but what's the actual point, when you miss the 95% chance targets, because they're MOVING? (Looking at you Scorchbeasts!) Legitmately just wasted 42 stimpaks amd 15 minutes shooting them to absolutely no avail (two of them)
---
Reducint the sonic blast spam isn't enough ,they NEED to land on their own a bit more and for longer periods, they didn't land ONCE for me in an open area, it actually made me stop playing.
---
Wasn‚Äôt meant to be useful. Thanks for your equally useless sass though. 
---
Seems so then just relog and start again, cheers.
---
Lmao
---
Use the arrows to change the variant of the stash box. 
---
Short of long, sneak is completely broken ATM, for most people 
---
I feel like the people on this sub are my family. Lol. I mean it with love.
---
Quit this game. It isn't good. Play the other Fallouts. Bethesda let us down, it's cool, we'll live.
---
Peace out fam, I'm unsubbing. 
---
I did have the marsupial mutation but thought is a bit silly bouncing about, maybe I should just get it for these cases to escape these unstoppable deaths.
---
Should be in the settings
---
Furious Handmade when in the air. Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet, or Grognak's Axe, once they land. For the SBQ fight, I put on my explosives perk cards and unleash all my 40mm ammo at her using my Auto Grenade Launcher which takes off a sizeable chunk of her health. Once I run out of that ammo, I switch to my Suppressor's Explosive Gatling Plasma gun and do some more damage. I also used bloodied melee weapons for the SBQ.
---
Its one of the weekly challenges. Just an easy scavenger hunt to get a few extra atoms
---
If it wasn't meant to be useful then what drove you to post this?
---
Use thumbstick to change variants 
---
Couldn't have said it better. If Bethesda could put half the time and effort into the game as OP did with this Journal we would all be happier.
---
It's because they use the same rates for automatic loops that Fallout 4 used (420, 540, 660, 780 and 900 RPM) without actually determining each automatic weapon's rate of fire in the same way Fallout 4 did. Fallout 4 set a base speed and then defined it with an additional multiplier, whereas 76 just sets a particular speed (which ends up right between the 420 and 540 loops). I actually made a sound replaced for the Handmade for personal use, and I adjusted the 420 auto loop to around 480; it doesn't sync perfectly, but it's a hell of a lot closer than the vanilla loop. I've been considering making that adjustment for all of the loops and throwing it up on the Nexus, but that wouldn't do any good for console players sadly.
---
Yep, always try to keep a max build as I prefer that, with carnivore and my trusty water purifiers I always keep stocked up, others have suggested poison damage and invisible badly spawned foes, will just relog when it happens or jump up somewhere away from the invisible one.
---
I‚Äôm glad someone else recognizes how terrible the enemy ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is. 
---
I have never had a fun combat experience in which the challenge was part of the fun. 
---
Any ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù is like you said; a part of the DPS race. 
---
Low effort post
---
You are making a lot of speculation here.  Are you hoping to create more outrage over something trivial?
---
No one but the devs know if they planned on having it discoverable in game, or if it was an atomic shop item by design.
---
I also offer you this counterpoint.  What if they had designed the Vampire costume for the Atomic Shop, and then decided, hey let's make a witch and skeleton as well, and put them in the game as discoverable outfits that players don't need to buy.
---
Point of view and perspective are important.
---
Yeah but I can't plan a character based on bugs. How's it SUPPOSED to be?
---
Oh well, hoping they add a preset system to the game sometime, that would be cool.
---
The best Jerry, the BEST!
---
I have a Two Shot Weightless Ghoul Slayers Gauss Rifle and it no joke makes me smile every time I log on 
---
Game didn't flop. Try again
---
Oh baby. 
---
That Rage 2 gameplay looks sexy as fuck. 
---
Maybe get that tech and retrofit it for Fallout?
---
The game is much better, but still not great. You just haven5 played through the improvement.
---
I guess I made this sound more like a personal issue than what I see as a broader issue; why should the CONSUMER play Fo76 and spend money on it when there are so many games better games on the market? I just hope it's something Bethesda asks itself
---
If executed well, that could be an amazing. Give players the option to start a new character in a new world without the bullshit that's slowly killing off their player base. Maybe throw in a "simulation veteran" meaningless gift as an apology. 
---
I'd log back in to check it out.
---
I get that. Downvotes don't really 'bother' me as this is not necessarily a painting or math proof I poured my soul into.(not that I can paint)
---
cheers though! 
---
Have 'bumped' into a robot in the middle of the Enclave bunker while in PA with Pain Train equipped. It was not a good time...
---
You don't think it be like it is, but it do.
---
First off, this is not a quest. It is a random encounter that can mark locations on your map. Just like the traveling merchant or deathclaw nest or crashed vertibot or Ford or the crashed satellite. You are the one offering misguided information.
---
Second off, the issue is not if it was in game, it‚Äôs did they pull content intended for the base game to put behind micro transactions. I don‚Äôt care what they did, I‚Äôm worried about what they may do.
---
What if in the new enclave DLC, the new quests and events are free, but the rewards are atomic shop items you can purchase after completing the quest. Bethesda has shown no signs of good faith with how they handle their in game purchases. I believe it is important to make sure they know what we expect of a full priced game. And it‚Äôs not removing content in order for it to later be micro transactions.
---
Then why even bother with player vendors? Just implement an in game auction house system that can be accessed from anywhere like guild wars 2
---
 Not all 3\* Legendry are equal.
---
honestly the majority of people I talk to don't seem to crash but then again it could be a system thing where some crash more often because of (insert random thing here) so I can see it being a real thing but at same time I play 15+ hours a week in a team and I only see one crash a fraction of the time mostly I see the shard implode and all of us get booted same moment so I think its less server stability and more something (probably exploiters) broke the shard
---
Where the hell can I get disease cure or antibiotics? I have looked at every vendor and medical vending machine I could find for the past week and havent seen any. I've got like 3 diseases right now that I cant get rid of  
---
but if you quit why keep looking into it? Legit question not sarcastic - I mean when I quit games I leave a review say don't buy it and then move on buy something else if your done with the game why not be well done with it?
---
 I will finally get an Anti Armor exploding legendary and it will be freaking binoculars. 
---
It‚Äôs from Borderlands, boiiii
---
An important side effect of the scaling ratio formula to note is that AP results in a flat effective damage boost, regardless of the target's DR. the only exception being things whose armor is low enough that you already do essentially 100% damage. 
---
I have one. Offer? 
---
There is an armor type that does the poison resist and a legendary effect too. I haven't looked too much into the foods and chems that help because I have so many stimpak, just hitting it multiple times as it goes down does the trick. Running vaccinated right now? You are missing out on the rad worms. What is your endurance at?
---
Those kings do travel in three's and there are invisible types. 
---
This is like a message written by Dwight
---
I would interested in the answer to the question as well.
---
I have to say I am a fan of Pain Train, less for damage but more for crowd control. Run into the Golf House and start smacking Ghouls around until you get corned but a massive crowd of the then you just run through them leaving a trail of ghouls falling over. Loads of fun!
---
Also funny to run into something big and weak like a radstaff and just have it explode by running into it.
---
Its definitely behaving weird for me, times when I'm quite obviously out of view of anything it'll still say \[DANGER\] and won't drop until I've gotten an absurd distance away. Seems like some of the enemies are looking right through "solid" objects. 
---
But other times, its working perfectly...errr at least works as I would expect it to based on FO4 sneaking. 
---
I have a pretty strange set of bodged together armor, one of which is chameleon, but I have paid zero attention to weight and still can sneak right up on most enemies without detection, watch super mutants walk by etc. Seems like some enemies, mongrels/wolves for sure, can see right through my sneak. 
---
Definitely getting a wee bit annoying as I'm obviously chasing the 2.5x sneak multiplier, yet some stupid critter 1/4 miles away can see me through Chameleon and cliffs in the dead of night randomly. 
---
I can always tell when I get close to something as I see the down votes climbing 
---
&gt; What I'm worried is it will be at my camp.
---
oh, well if they make this CAMP related/dependant I bet it was going to be an endless source of problems.
---
 I would expect something like the Mall at Whitesprings, 24 mini shops with upto 24 player vendor-bots (or upto 24 vending machines).
---
Excellent work, thanks alot!
---
Its titled challenges thats why
---
Was the first sentence in your thread inspired by the opening lines to ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù?
---
How about release the basic ideas before launch instead of releasing a half arsed shit game?
---
Absolutely lol
---
Lol.  
---
Do it for pc‚Äôers. You‚Äôd still be loved :)
---
Or ride it around while limahl plays
---
 STRANGER DANGER!  Next they will be offering you candy!  We need an adult!
---
I saw that too! I thought it was a fun Easter egg.
---
I've had the map but before. It's shown nobody (not wanted) but then I've seen people after q few minutes.
---
Van with no windows.
---
Yes twice.  I don't know what he is playing.
---
Brilliant!
---
it doesn't matter, because players can still one shot other players (mostly melee) becaus they have so much damage. 
---
Explosive instigating and two shot would be ideal but I could take others 
---
I prefer the option of having the whole map as PvP area and not just a smaller section of it.
---
Yeah that would be a doodle addition. 
---
I'm betting there will be a new dupe glitch
---
I thought it was it was the battle of the bismark 
---
Im just saying that the game has a large silent player majority with no online representation/interaction **except** in stats like the one you brought in, and cautioned of inferring things about that majority from the people that do talk about it online. Nothing else. 
---
I hope you‚Äôre physically upset by whatever triggered this post.
---
If a video game does that to you, then you deserve it.
---
It will be [here](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) first like usual.
---
The Eyed Piper! 
---
thank you. my point exactly kind sir.
---
Honestly, I have a howitzer built (the camp artillery) and the gatling gun sounds better.
---
what exactly is aggressive or antagonistic about asking for what literally everyone wants? 
---
I'm a mechanic and I understand the headaches of troubleshooting and broken things. Troubleshooting can range from a quick fix (most of the time it isn't) to something you need to spend days on (because of Murphy's law). But at the same time, just giving us a little list of content they'll be working on in the year will make me happy and content to wait like a story overhaul, new lands, vaults and etc.
---
Nah I‚Äôve tested they disappear every time I log out well nearly every time
---
not the same as combat armor deep pocketed.
---
50% Metacritic isn't a flop? What planet is this.
---
&gt; We're actively investigating reports of infinite loot loading. 
---
Haha...I've seen no evidence of BGS *actively* doing anything beyond having you PR drones issue one bland platitude after another.
---
Dude I've seen a few accounts coming on here to bash the game and only had &lt;1 week old accounts. So it must go both ways. 
---
That would be great, finally manage to catch up to the overseer.  She built a settlement 
---
I saw people launching nukes earlier today and thought it would be posted by now. 
---
My psn is my username.  Add me. I'm level 41
---
I actually meant its against the rules.... But I've been drinking and well fuck it
---
well if we are going full technical here that isn't a Howitzer either that is a Mortar cannon.
---
There's some formula. It will take the cost to develop and produce the game. To buy/rent/maintain servers. Support, marketing, etc. All costs. Then initial sales. Underperformed obviously. Bad reception hurt sales. Game went on sale for 50% off in the first months. Maybe they have some formula that says sell X many copies, maintain population of X number of players, sell X number of Atoms per month, etc. There's a sweet spot somewhere. Who has access to all of the numbers? Who can tell? Yes an games can loss money, online in particular, or not make enough profit for it to be worth it. If you want to drive people away from a game to cut server costs because things aren't adding up, and they already got the money from the initial purchase, they can do that easily with a simple patch screwing up things people enjoy. I see a different perspective. I'm the kind of person who would invest more. Think outside of the box. Make radical changes. Innovate. The Atom Shop would have new items every day that people would actually want to buy. There would be new events coming out every week. I'd hire 100 people if I had to to get every bug fixed as soon as possible. A game like this should be getting every chance to succeed. But you have bean counters and suits with focus groups and casual game testers and charts and projections and a lot of BS that dictates decision making. Well look where that gets them.
---
I don't think editing the ini("game files") is allowed per the TOS. Not sure though.
---
I removed the mod and it indeed did work, I can now use the trade system. Thanks for the help!!!
---
Haha, good call.
---
You are honestly taking things out of proportion. 
---
There is nothing shady here, the costume was there to begin with. Its their choice to put it in game or in the atom shop, seeing as it has the atom shop icon... which means it can't be dropped and could be obtained through craft after purchase proves that it was intended to be that way. It's their game. Their shop. Their choice. They didn't put it in then remove it. Just because you found the costume on a prop.
---
Plus we got two out of the three Halloween costumes already in game. Let's not be greedy now. If it makes you feel any better, some atom shop items have in game variances, like the clown outfit or space suit etc. and the western coat. Those ofcourse are rare, so it seems to me that it is kind of fair play. 
---
Hey, unpopular opinion here, thanks for what you have shared so far. While I too am dying for more info, I still remember and cling to the habits of the past, before every game had a twitter and a roadmap. Not that I would object to that roadmap happening tomorrow, in the least, but I understand why it has not.
---
That said, a teaser of some sort might not be remiss. A reminder that more is coming would at least stoke the fire a little.
---
Well, here's a hey howdy. My friends tab is blank. And so is my husbands. We can't team up with each other or our friends. A super duper way to play a game we spent a good delay of money on for the Express purpose of playing co-op. And the final "try" for a fix given by support is to uninstall and reinstall to game with no guarantee that will solve the issue anymore than their other suggestions did. Remind just how many gigs that when all was said and done? Would Beth like to pay my wifi bill this month? Didn't think so.
---
that sucks, I've realized my cooked soup disappear over time, but i just assume it spoils, i always have spoiled food in my inventory as well, i will look closer now
---
Well ya got an up from me, bud.
---
Just listened to your suggestion; I don't think it is.  I'm pretty sure it's a Confederate war tune or the like.
---
Thanks for replying.

Fair enough, it is a mortar cannon. It's also not as much fun as the gatling gun.

There is a sulphuric fountain in a pagoda near the tennis courts in Whitesprings that will cure what ails you. Other than that, you can sometimes find them in bathroom mirrors. Myself, I make my own with Firecaps, and Bloodleafs, etc. in the chemistry workbench.

Expect at least two weeks to get this fixed.

Yes, this!

The best part about Mayor for a Day is All Rise.

AP magazines do not improve damage against unarmored (or insufficiently-armored) targets.

Yeah because people don't create an account on a forum to complain about a product they just bought and are not satisfied with.

What about in tandem with 'fireproof' perk cards?
---
If I stack them, can I drop a mine at my feet and be unscathed by the explosion (+ adamantium skeleton).
---
If anything, you're the one sounding smug and condescending. Seriously you'd think if they wanted to keep players they'd be a lot more vocal than just the same old responses from community people.Doesn't even have to be a devstream ala Warframe, just give the players *something* to really look forward too in the months to come.
---
While equipped I bumped into a bot in Whitesprings and everything went aggro... never again.
---
You mean a safe place that players can go to that would be isolated and secure enough to protect players from dangerous environmental threats and physical threats from dangerous creatures?  It could possibly be under ground with a yuuuuuge nearly impenetrable door that only the player can access?  Golly, I don't think I could ever think of a place like that.  Has anyone even heard of a place like that?  Maybe we can put together a focus group and question fallout players about a place that could shelter players from external dangers, that they could store their stuff, and enter and exit the place at their leisure.  But would this sort of place negatively affect the storyboard of the fallout franchise?  We don't want to make something new that would cause irreparable damage, because this is a "prequel" we don't want to make some sort of impenetrable shelter that could house its inhabitants indefinitely and store their stuff indefinitely (dependent on the design life of the shelter mind you).  I don't know guys, i'm not some smart developer who is actually paid to do this stuff and make these sorts of decisions who can just pull this sort of structure out of my a$$ and if I could it would probably ruin the franchise.
---
Anything new since you last announced it 22 hours ago?
---
No worries, I often search out old comments months down the line and ask people if they "still feel that way?" So I'm sure I'll be coming back here in the future. 
---
Holy Negotiator (from my Hellgate days)
---
Maybe others can commiserate.
---
Doesn't bother me. Look at it this way, aggressive hiring and expansion of the team is what is happening in regards to fixing the game. You don't make a car with no engine go faster by pushing down on the pedal more.
---
/u/ladydevann are we getting Patch 6 tomorrow since it's been 2 weeks or is it more likely to come out next week?
---
OG commmenter was trying to make this point but figured he‚Äôd be shit on so quoted it to other people lol
---
Swear to Christ dude.  You can get about 7-10 ammo bags in Fort Defiance in how ever fast it takes you to run through the BOS side of the building.  If you server hop a few times to get a fresh building you can get 10 bags guaranteed.  You can get 2-5 bags in the BOS outposts around the northern edge of Cranberry Bog.  There's 3-5 ammo bags that I know of it Watoga.  There's one right outside Wes-Tek and two inside that I know of.  This isn't even counting all the fiber you get from tape in those palces.  I seriously do sell it.  I had over 300 ballistic fiber a few days ago before I drastically reduced my stock in junk materials.  I now only keep 75 ballistic fiber max and I really don't even need that much because I know where to immediately go to get more.
---
I see "Quest Designer" so no, not bothered at all
---
This would make things so much easier. Maybe we could get the community to start using that waste of space whitesprings resort as such a place. Then Bethesda just has to restrict weapon usage in there as well.
---
I just added you! I'm now level 16 lol
---
We have an extra member ;)
---
I find myself still exploring.  Finding little jokes, listening to holo tapes, finding camp sites. I haven‚Äôt finished anything yet like you but I find so much to do that I‚Äôm still interested.  I‚Äôve probably only put in 75 hrs though at this point.
---
I was a die-hard defender since the beta. I decided to take a break after the last inside the vault, but Apex Legends came out, and I've just been taking it easy with that. I still don't believe Fallout 76 will be an abandoned project (especially since people are barely finding out what's inside the vaults). I just decided I'd rather be back when the bulk of the new content is out. 
---
That would be an amazing idea. Too bad 80% of players will think it‚Äôs a cargobot escort and shot you down 50 feet from where you got picked up. Then there‚Äôs the raiders.
---
main problem is manpower and experience bgs Austin has no idea what they are doing
---
Of course the main problem is manpower. Bethesda came out and said at launch that they would be focussing most manpower towards the next game launch. We knew months ago that FO76 was bottom of the totem for Bethesda once it was launched.
---
Posts like this is what this sub should be posting. 
---
hej cranbog, can you come online?
---
Xbox Achievements net you gamerscore which does nothing for you, yet players are chasing those damn things ALL the time.
---
One would assume they are still interviewing for these positions.  New hires would then have an acclimation period of something like 90 days before getting any real work done. Seems to me we won't even have a baseline launch quality game for another 6 months.
---
I'm glad to see more of these I know anti armor weapons are probably my favorite weapon got a anti armor hand made and lever action rifle and with tank killer they can really lay down some hurt quick 
---
Nothing to do except events and farm to repair gear. Which is also now next to impossible with 20hr cooldowns on world pick ups
---
And those events have idiotic timers in excess of an hour / shitty spawn rates / shitty bugs preventing completion and the best part of all **shitty rewards that you probably have received 10, 20, 30 times already**
---
Last time I was asked this, they issued an amber alert 
---
But maybe if your still wearing Power Armor or have the bird bones muta 
---
You drop to the ground ready for PvP and the person who shot takes wanted bounty 
---
Gaming developers come and go. Most developers are hired for a project/game and then fired at completion.
---
What this says is that Bethesda is ramping up development of their next game and continuing to ignore FO76.
---
Same. We usually take unowned workshops for the XP and events.
---
I wanted to believe that it would get better but Bethesda has shown no interest in making any significant changes since launch. I'll keep enjoying the game for what it is but I think it's time we let this comeback fantasy go. 
---
I was always excited for 76. Nobody wanted to see this game succeed more than I did. I hope I'm wrong but I really don't think I am. 
---
I'm leveling an alt and just hit 11 my.main is closing in on 40.  I dont ther to play often but usually its early 1-5am in the morning eastern US time.  
---
Seriously doubt they are giving a new project to Austin. These are Austin positions, not general BGS positions.
---
I uninstalled it and re-downloaded / installed Witcher 3.  Later ya'll.
---
I‚Äôve never stopped going on this sub though. I admit the explosive damage bug was a big change. There hasn‚Äôt been much more improvement beyond that. No new content or features either. So yeah, not much better.
---
I think it just kinda happens 
---
That would make sense. I‚Äôm just making the point it‚Äôs not a guarantee to get where you‚Äôre going, and that would frustrate some players.
---
He would be there yes. But if it were possible than you start a server and play for 30 mins and he'd eventually be there like clockwork. If it works once it'd probably work always. He'd be like a permanent addition to your camp.
---
It is just tacked on. Real PvP is a blast. In this game it's just some asshat sniping you from afar or mashing your camp to be an asshole. Cap baiting for shits n gigs. That isn't PvP. 
---
I played for almost 800 hours and I just got bored. I like doing events, but I've done all the events hundreds of times. I like launching nukes, but the only thing that's worth nuking is fissure site prime and I've killed the queen enough times to get every single mutation serum recipe multiple times. I still continued to play for a while even though I was feeling burnt out on the game but I enjoyed just hopping on to chat with my friends but now most of them either don't play at all or don't play as much as they used to so with none of my friends playing and no desire to do the same events again and again I have no motivation to play right now. Other games I'm looking forward to are coming out soon, so I'll probably just be playing those and I'll come back to 76 once some new content is added.
---
The game has failed to bridge the gap into multiplayer by adapting the story to be engaging while also not impacting the game world. Nothing you do matters yet the game is written like a standard 'you must do this and save *X*'. As such everything feels unfulfilling and somewhat pointless. The story is delivered in the single most unimaginative medium possible which means that gameplay and plot immersion are actively disconnected from each other, you are either playing or being presented with the next part of the story and you have to drop one to get the other. The replayability of previous Fallout games or RPGs in general is not there because the character has no choices, every character is destined to follow the same path to the same result.
---
All of this means that even hunting for the trademark Bethesda set-pieces in the world design isn't worth the monotony.
---
Fair enough :-)
---
It just feels so much better for me. There hasn't been much and I really hope a roadmap comes soon, but the game is getting better no matter how slow the pace.
---
Yea but there never was a guarantee to begin with I‚Äôm emphasizing survival mode Fo4 where you could still be shot out of the vertibird via npc‚Äôs 
---
Still no guarantee safety.
---
And depending on how high the bit flies I‚Äôm sure no ones gunna be trying to snipe out a random vertibot unless trolling with a gauss rifle or targeting system missile launcher. Js
---
I stay in stealth almost all the time.  You won't see people like me on the map.
---
In my opinion, one of the locked up conference halls in the WhiteSpring should be opened and be used for a kind of "player market" like a trade show in real life. Would be fitting. 
---
I have a furious ripper.  It sucks so bad compared to FO4.
---
It's not that rare compared to some events, just keep trying, I guess. You dont have to be near the County Fairgrounds, it'll happen wherever you are
---
Everything is justified except your fortnite part it has nothing to do with fortnite period that‚Äôs your cynical hate talking 
---
Also strikes me that there are zero QA positions listed.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to build my tiny shack and pedal some white lightning. Best/ worst part would this would greatly increase PvP, robbers trying to take your product. It‚Äôll be a mini exhibition all over again.
---
Better than never.
---
Additional bonus. If they are hiring for Austin it means the Maryland studio will be spending their time focused on making sure Starfield and TES:VI aren't utter trash instead of picking up the pieces of 76.
---
Oh nice, I'm glad it got patched up!  And yeah, those temps are fine, although I'd suggest a slightly more aggressive fan curve on the GPU.  MSI Afterburner has an easy fan curve controller.  Fiddle with that a bit until your max temps are around 75ish.  Shouldn't take much tweaking to find that sweet balance between "cool" enough and "quiet enough."
---
Also, because you have GSYNC, you shouldn't need to cap your FPS @ 100, especially if you're not getting higher FPS than your native refresh rate (hz) in FPS.
---
On xbox you can use radaway x in pipboy but if your on item screen you drop whatever you were on. I dropped an item this way and was thinking the glitch I keep hearing about got me then 5 min later it occurred to me what happened ran back to the spot I used radaway and my item was there in a paper bag 
---
Make that 5 times now, just lost a zealots power fist that swung 40% faster.  Really really getting old.
---
Thank you. I will go check it out tonight. I do t have any plans or recipies for them yet. 
---
Have you got a Anti armor VATS 50% VATS cost -25% Lever action rifle? Seems like I'm the only one with it.
---
It‚Äôs pretty clear you hate em and want fallout 76 to die and Bethesda to fail like most on this sub wants 
---
Had my first solo on one with the BOS mission to get a special set of armor. Scorchbeast in a cave that couldn‚Äôt fly + Melee = lvl 33 win!
---
Big congrats for takin‚Äô it down with ballistics! Cheers!
---
We would have an accurate answer for you if the dailies were actually dailies
---
keep enjoying it man! I burned out after 120ish hrs. there are tons of small thing I love in the game, it just got monotonous for me sadly.
---
Rose‚Äôs quest?
---
As soon as the no content cry babies stop crying maybe they can do that 
---
What did it do?
---
It's clear to me they boated this poor team out into the middle of the ocean and threw them to the sharks while the rest of BGS went back to their "real" projects chasing those couple billion dollars over the horizon.
---
yeah I know what you mean
---
GT:Crawls84
---
I swing shifts so I play at different times but if I see you on, I'll team up
---
This would be pretty neat.  Maybe they could use another vault that could serve as a player hub that is released in an update.  It could have boxes to stash junk in for people to take freely.  And trading areas or like a market like other MMO games where you can sell items for caps via a special vending machine.
---
server hop or do other events until Leader pops up
---
I still play it but less and less everyday, sometimes none at all. Today, I logged in and had fun watching a glitched trashcan popping up and down in the air, this went on for 15 or so minutes before I looked back on the map, literally nothing exciting that was happening
---
The invisible bad guys I have resolved with turrets 
---
Bethesda doesnt care stop making posts as if they do
---
Also while you're at it more legendary exploding mole rats please.
---
I stopped playing shortly after the tse patch. Since then, I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub in hopes that I‚Äôll find something to bring me back, but I‚Äôm starting to doubt I ever will. 
---
Bethesda hasn‚Äôt given us any reason to keep playing, so it‚Äôs understandable that people are moving on. 
---
You're on the wrong sub for reasonable replies. Seriously, almost all replies to a community manager post say this to some degree or another.
---
Oh I remember when I was told scrapped junk wouldn't weight inside of stash box, totally sad I believed that lie. Would of cancelled my preorder of Tricentennial edition if I knew that I was wrong. Literally my favorite part of fallout 3 and 4 was the fact there was no real inventory management required like MMO games, just dump it all in a bin at base and head back out to explore the world. Heck I would settle on just having to not to worry about managing scrapped resources.
---
Yo I'm in Australia so we have similar time zones. You're welcome to add me. I'm level 23. Psn is fakenunchucks
---
If you planned your build out, it should come together by 45-50 at the latest (assuming you actually find the weapon you were hoping to use and start crafting ammo for it, if necessary).
---
Scorchbeasts will devour all your ammo at lower levels, but around your 30s you should hit the "first solo Scorchbeast" point, late 40s you should be able to traverse anywhere in the Cranberry Bog without too much worry about the overgrown bats, and once you have all your gear and perks in place post-50 they're mostly just flying pi√±atas (where the prize is a chunk of meat, some Ultracite, and occasionally an item plan or a relatively-nice non-legendary weapon).
---
I mean weapons that have located in different places on the map, I‚Äôve got literally everyone i think
---
Decided to step nack &amp; take a bit of a break &amp; see if they can pull off a turnaround with some PVE content soon.  ESO was on sale over the weekend, so i picked it up on a whim since it's so often compared to FO76.  Sadly i don't think i'm all that much of an MMO player, so i'm not sure if i'll stick with it yet.
---
Might try some heavily modded Skyrim or FO4, but i'll have to learn the ins &amp; outs of Vortex instead of the 'ol NMM
---
Imagine being a triple A developer that has a place and team specifically to tackle problems like this, but when the public uses the bug reports the team in charge tells the public that there's nothing they can do. Finally when enough players are outraged their public relations people collect everyone's information to placate them, meanwhile on the back end we're going to get the same action... nothing.
---
Isn't the inside of whitesprings pretty much that? PvP is "allowed" bit not a very good idea lol
---
This is why the in-game tool tips are such garbage. It should take players to do this kind of in-depth testing in order to know what is happening in game. But thank you for showing this to everyone.
---
Bored. So damn bored with it. The bugs almost broke me with the constant CTD but the almost complete lack of endgame is what really sealed the deal. Complete lack of social tools like auction house, mail, guilds, and global text chat made it even worse. Cmon bethesda, it's the modern world and we have washing machines with wifi that can post to twitter, get with the times man!
---
travelled to you!
---
Lvl. 42. I still get fucked every time
---
You really don‚Äôt understand what this is about. It‚Äôs not about being greedy for more cosmetics, I have bought atoms and purchased what I want. It‚Äôs about them putting base game content in a micro transaction based shop.
---
Look at some of the data mined items, like the moth man sets. A lot of people have speculated that there will be future DLC related to Point Pleasant and the cult surrounding the moth man, and we know with near certainty they intended to release themed cosmetics to the atomic shop.
---
It is there game and they are free to do as they please, but as consumers, we have the right to demand value out of our purchase.
---
How much damage is it putting out?
---
If you mean atom farming... all your characters on the same account share atoms and daily challenges to earn them.
---
I see where your coming from, but I think the main issue with the story was the lack of compelling side quests. Bethesda has never really been who I look at for a great main storyline personally. But their main sidequests it usually where they shine. The only good side questline I can think of in 76 is the mistress of mystery
---
I've seen the same thing.  Sometimes when do a search nothing happens so I loot what's there and walk away.  Then all the sudden it pops up 15 seconds later. I know things are very laggy on the server.
---
THIS SO MUCH.  I was so excited for Fallout 76 and I've absolutely moved on and I'm super disappointed about the whole thing.  Just check this subreddit on occasion hoping for a No Man's Sky NEXT type update (if you're not familiar with NMS they totally overhauled the game and basically released 2.0 for free with the NEXT update).
---
CWSS is very much missed.
---
okay, thanks
---
Try fast travel, sometimes it resets quests or objectives markers.
---
I see, I picked up some weird weapons. Like the bone club and another one similar to it but different.
---
but I meant farming the daily quests
---
The question I have is do Bethesda employees still play this game in their non-work leisure time?
---
Is Pete Hines out in Appalachia somewhere playing solo like he said he did? 
---
1) The ridiculous amount of bugs / issues.  
---
2) No end game.  
---
3) PVP is a joke.  
---
4) No new content.  
---
5) No QoL fixes.  
---
6) Wasting 5000 bullets, only for your game to crash.
---
hell yeah! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
---
I found something there once super early into me playing,  and I got really excited, so thanks!
---
Settings =&gt; Game =&gt; Pacifist Mode (on/off)
---
I did. No change sadly.
---
Shoot, I tried to tell people even back in beta that was false.
---
Posted this Oct 27th
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ryo5q/scrapped_junk_does_count_towards_stash_weight/
---
any ammo needed?
---
I'll probably be off by then.
---
Do you usually get on at that time?
---
The UI change makes me hate power armor so much. I refuse to use it. 
---
Technically, playing the game is not a revenue stream once you buy the game. Only Atom Shop sales do.
---
Also, PvP numbers would be low, what with the anti-PVP system they have in the game. But a month ago, the sub was filled with "we want real PvP," and now that it's incoming, the other side of the coin is now angry about it.
---
I'd suggest that you *don't play right now*. Really. They've said this will be a long burn project, an experiment. So set it aside, play one of the many games you mentioned, enjoy them. Check in every few months to see if they released anything that tickled your fancy. You lose nothing for playing another game (I caught Witcher 3 on steam sale and am getting a kick out of it, have barely touched 76 in a week now. Also, Axiom Verge is free on Epic store just now, if you don't mind having a different launcher for your games).
---
surprise, it didnt get sorted
---
Maybe this is silly but do we need so many containers in the open world? Idk if reducing them would help the servers or not but if it did I wouldn't mind if they ditched a few hundred tool boxes and dressers.
---
Again, this isn‚Äôt about wether or not we deserve the cosmetic. It‚Äôs about Bethesda removing base content from the game in order to put it in the AS for profit. That‚Äôs why I raised the question of if it was removed, I never said it was. I‚Äôm not crusading for it to be added into the game. Just raising concern for future content updates. 
---
And to your counter point, why would the vampire take the place at the random encounter spawn over the other two. Only one of the bodies can spawn at a time. This is the only one that you gain nothing from, other than a duplicate holo tape and some cotton candy bites, both of which the other two already carry. 
---
And my point of view is a paying customer, who wants to make sure they are not taken advantage of
---
Sorry, switching servers makes you lose it entirely so there's probably not much else to do except hope Todd Howard waves a magic wand.
---
I definitely think that for Fallout 76 the side quests is where the real immersion and classic 'Fallout' feel can actually be let loose. Side quests can be whatever they want. They don't need a 'purpose' in the same way the main story does. They can be passing curiosities that the player character decides to check out. They tick all the required boxes:
---
* No required change to world state upon completion of quest
---
* No necessity in quest provides player with meaningful (if basic) decisions
---
* Self-contained allows for immersive storytelling not contaminated by the aforementioned problems with the main quest (linear, choiceless, pointless)
---
* Exploration is its own reward
---
But then you can kill people with your gaze! 
---
It's in the process of flopping more than a pair of noisy sandals!
---
You will have a scorchbeast constantly attacking your base if you build there :(  I wanted it for the acid extractor, but even giving up to just living inside the edges of the cave I couldn‚Äôt deal with the constant attack.  
---
\*snerk\* I still go back to that post and laugh quietly every once in a while. The numbers continue to grow, as everyone adds their touch to the Legend.
---
That said, I look at ESO for inspiration. Launched in bad shape, almost no fun to be had even among ES nerds. But they took the time and polished that turd until nobody seems to remember it was once a turd and not a polished game.
---
It's Bethesda. They tend to release turd games and then just keep going until they stop being turds. So rather then yelling about the turd in our mouths, we should probably spit it out and do something else until it's palatable.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Typical for this unpolished turd lol
---
The thing is that all of this is fine, but realistically the best 2nd affix on any weapon is explosive. 
---
Do all the tests again but with an explosive rifle for more usable information. 
---
Thank you for the quick response 
---
Will do! 
---
Awesome! Leveling is pretty quick if you do events and missions and crafting lol 
---
Try both Grafton vendors, station and Greg in town. The one at Camden park sells em too. It seems that a few of the set inventory items for vendors are still randomly available. They will be there, just maybe not today.
---
Theres so many missed oppurtunitys with this game that being one of them. Have there be a benefit to powering up all the power plants and nuking multiple fissure sites,etc. You nuke a fissure site and SB still spawn from them. So whats the point story wise?! You can kill 3 queens in an hour on the same server so clearly using nukes on them is pointless. Theres just no progression or benefit that you see, its just loot battles and workbenches.
---
My favorite to fight? That's easy: deathclaws 
---
No, put it in the vault but have it be a multiserver system. Have it so every server has one so all players can use it but it shows listings across multiple or all servers. Grand Exchange was good was to describe the kind of thing we need. No matter what world you go to people are there buying, selling, and lending items and equipment across separate world's. No need for actual interactions but those are still available. 
---
Also when you buy an item you should be able to picked up from any Shop in Appalachia or have it go directly to your inventory upon next login.
---
An alien quest would have been really neat, if you could find scout ships that imply that the aliens are watching the planet as an experiment. It would give more credence to the implication in Mothership Zeta that they could have also started the war.
---
It varies, I work a lot of evening shifts so I'm not home until after midnight. But I play before work too
---
I mean it allows me to put stuff where i other wise wouldn't be able to. so i don't really hate it.
---
It works orbitals when equipped drop on death...
---
The vendor at Camden park has basically all the upgrades for the excavator armor
---
Yeah, noticed the SB when I ft'ed there few times while trying to build something. Gave up on it eventually.
---
Lol it's happened to me before so I'm sure you aren't alone
---
Cool, will have to add something soon. Have you tried burn barrels?
---
Or they kill you?
---
I sometimes just run around using a chainsaw, makes me feel like a madman not caring for myself or the world around me.
---
Lately I've been obsessed with modding guns..a fellow redditor just made me a suped up 10mm, hunting rifle, and handmade for my low level alt..all level 15/20..since the TSEs were somewhat nerfed..had to improvise to still have fun 
---
This is always going to be the case. The game is not built for player-impact.
---
Let's say the first PvE DLC is Vault [63 and the G.E.C.K](/spoiler). If you complete that like you complete Scorched Earth it's not going to [meaningfully rejuvenate Appalachia](/spoiler). Everything will be the same once you're done. Eventually at some point Bethesda might flip a switch and the game world changes for everyone in a very 'congratulations, you did it' or 'you didn't do it, but someone else did' moment.
---
More likely at the end of February 
---
Your name says it all.

As long as your ping is low and the target is reasonably moving. For whatever reason, I can headshot almost anything on the move, but not the sodding SB's. Not sure what it is about them, but I cannot body-shot them with a gauss half the time, which seems silly because I thought the Gauss was hitscan, and I am starting to suspect server lag or the like. But take that with a grain of salt, I've not done any meaningful research on it.
---
I only use it in nuked areas or if I just want to jump off something as a shortcut. I'd use a hazmat suit if it didn't make me take off my armor to wear it. I've noticed the fire breather stuff let's you wear armor. At least I think so. Can you wear that in a radiated area too? 
---
He was asking if they did decreased damage.
---
thats true who would want to be told how to do their job but, Bethesda stated in the last Inside the vault that they want feedback on enemy's and how they feel and weapon feedback along with quest and item feedback so i'd say that bethesda wants to be told because they dont know themselves.
---
Which is not good for a AAA Game developer not to know the direction of the games core gameplay and stuff.
---
 Everything except rad resistance of my X-01in Nuke zones and Excavator carry weight makes me hate PA.  I hate the UI and I hate the movement and noise.  
---
Sad but True. :(
---
Or did the immense negative reaction result in some payroll deductions and "promotions to customer"?
---
That sucks. I tend to avoid people I don‚Äôt know but I have had some good experiences with random players showing up in my camp and teaming up. I would tell you to keep trying. I lose my hard-earned loot a lot by simply dying naturally at the hands of npc‚Äôs and it always feelsbadman. 
---
Or the inside of the Whitesprings Resort.. 
---
this could be a pvp event too. like capture the flag only were chasing a bot in the sky while we fend off everything else trying to kill us
---
But the constant spinning wheel hasn't been there before patch 5. before that Loot was showing up nearly instantly and correct 
---
Quit.   Because it's unplayable.
---
Can't enjoy it because it won't let you.  So I tried to pull back and just build camps focusing on them.  I think camps are buggier than the game.  I just can't do it.  I'd love to love it and get my money worth, but I just can't.  Been in a game funk recently too.  I thought FO76 would replace ESO for me.    
---
Still in that game funk. 
---
if you really want to give low levels stuff. leave the stuff in the first corpse you encounter out of 76, the one where you find the pipe pistol
---
Ooo.  I had not heard about Dreams.  Media Molecule makes fun, quirky stuff so I looked it up.   Definitely on my watch list, looks very unique.
---
Player hub should be morganville
---
Dont forget the potted plant! they are the integral part of the team!
---
Topical work, thanks.
---
Hmmmm... does this let you place in trickier spots?
---
90 days seems kind of long.
---
I've played over 250 hours, never been griefed. But then again, I don't have a nice house.
---
My current build has too much weight reduction in it, so if I want to be able to dps from range, I basically have to be a glass cannon that can hardly carry anything without my tonka toy armor. I don't expect to be able to have unlimited perks or anything, but a better balance would free up a little weight management options for us. Melee are obviously going to stack strength, but that means they are sacrificing something in its place. Of the devs do not want to change the perk system to reduce the number of perks required for the main damage types, then maybe they would consider allowing us to add perks up to level 60 or 65. Again this would allow for more hybrid type builds which I am a fan of since I mainly solo, or for straight dps builds to add a little support for themselves when soloing. 
---
Hey, I'm with you.  No other FO DLC and storyline has ever been able to creep me out atmospherically like that one did, even though you'd think having a prewar ghoul as part of it all would somehow screw with the eerieness of the lore.
---
I have 60 some that you can have lol
---
I've been saying this since December.
---
Totally not worth it unless youre like level 10
---
Sorry, I don't think they are in the game.
---
Heh, Im in Brave so I just keep an alt there for stuff. What a hellhole
---
Power fist and dense armor mod, we both can't hurt each other.
---
To learn existing code, procedures and infrastructure? I don't think so.
---
  When I was still a rather low level he came leading his troop behind playing his tune as I engaged the Grafton monster who always spawns in the river bed between Charleston Tarin yard and Posiden Energy.  It was epic having a battle tune playing as I engaged the beast.
---
Hey you're in my camp spot! Thanks for the info, I'll have to try this. It's the only one I have left too. 
---
Yep.  There's a lot of potential here.  That's kind of the sad part.
---
Hey look a world and the ability to build structures.  We can rebuild the wasteland!  Woohoo!  Nope.  Here's your tiny little CAMP and it's not persistent in the game world.  In fact, everything you do is not persistent in the gameworld...at all.  You have basically zero effect on this world.  Even nuking it does no permanent change.  Oh, you also can't build remotely close to any of the cool stuff, k-thanks-baaaayyeeeee!
---
The fix?
---
Let everyone build anywhere and make it 100% persistent for that world.  No restrictions, just build anything.  What if someone wants to be an ass?  That's fine.  Players can make and destroy anything.  Creatures can be aggroed to any nearby structures (actually, promote this and scale this sort of like FO4).  Heck, nuke player cities.  I'd merely drop scrap from damaged items so players can reclaim some of the materials.  Also, blueprints need to be anything and everything, any scale.  If a guy wants to blueprint a city and wants to rebuild it with all the materials necessary, fucking go for it dude.  If you run across some random building someone else made, blueprint it so you can save it and build it elsewhere.  It should be very, VERY open-ended.  Let people play in the world without hassle or restrictions.  The major limiting factor will always be materials, and that's the part people work for.  What about gross exploits?  Let's say a group builds 1000 turrets at a fissure site to just play easy mode with boss fights.  Is that OK?  Yeah, it kind of is.  I mean anyone working to collect resources should gain the reward to build and use whatever those resources create.  It's a game.  That's part of the fun of games, to do weird shit and get away with it.  Also, the build height should be ridiculously high, because why not?  Just let players fuck around with anything and everything.  That's part of the fun of an open world game...with a building system.
---
Hey look a multiplayer online role playing game with emphasis on no NPCs and only other real players populating the world!  Let's role play and build a life in this new world!  Woohoo!  Nope.  No barter system, no social systems, and very limited role play or even group play.  Want to be a trader?  Hope you have good imagination!  Want to be a raider?  Prepare to be punished for every bullet ever fired at any other person.  Want to start a farm and open up a store front?  Good luck with that!
---
Create a monetary barter system in the game.  It could be an open market with pricing driven by pure supply and demand or based on game metrics, drop probability, etc., or just plain caps for X.  We need something, anything really, a better, more comprehensive system the better.  Look at other MMORPGs and mimic the ones that worked the best and that players were most happy with.
---
Build into the game social systems, roles, the ability to create events.  There should be the ability to classify yourself into some career path and have game metrics associated with that path.  I'd love to see a developers kit for creating custom events, quests, and activities.  Let the players build events, raids, and custom adventures.  Consume resources to do it (for structures, for creep spawns, and items drops).  Have a tool kit to develop triggers and AI functions.  Think something along the lines of making custom games in WC3.
---
The bigger point here is all this stuff is very tough to do for a developer and very limited staff.  BUT...it gets super easy for thousands of players to develop all kinds of crazy stuff in an open world.  Let the players do the work.  All we need is the tool kit to let us play.
---
For me, I see that this could be so much more but in a very different way than Bethesda's original intent.  The best games I've ever played were the ones that gave power to the players.  Think of games that have existed for actual decades simply because they had the dev kits available to players to extend the game engine vastly further.  Think of the Starcraft and Warcraft series with their custom game creator tools.  Think of Half-Life and all the mods that came forth.  Think of Minecraft and the mods that evolve that world and keep it interesting and fresh.
---
Now the challenge is Bethesda really still needs a monetary system to this game.  It wasn't a pay to play game, so the main fallback is really the creation market.  However, that's also the really big part that needs to be player owned and used.  Bethesda could take the percentage approach and simply charge a small fee per sale, using the in-game currency that's earned through play or bought with real money.  Realistically, consider it a hosting fee for the digital content.  The game is the support engine, but the money is made through content sales.  John Smith creates a cool leather overcoat and puts it for sale on the store for 50 caps, and Bethesda's revenue is 10%.  Yeah, there's a lot of virtual currency, but there will be a lot of people that will pay real money for in game content, and users will make a LOT of content if the game has value for it and the tools available to do so.  I mean LOL's pulling in billions just in skins alone, but they have a massive user base.  FO76 needs users, and it's the online open-ended world that can get them here.
---
Yeah, there will be a lot of weird, dumb stuff going on too, some illegal, and there will need to be some moderation.  However, that's not too tough to manage with some personnel, especially if the total game servers aren't that high in quantity (and they shouldn't, really need a lot more players on each world, like 100+)  I know this all sounds like it can become a real clusterfuck of a game, and that's kind of ok.  It will devolve a bit.  Some deviants will get banned.  People will settle into the game and start making some really cool stuff, correction, they will shape the wasteland...exactly as they were meant to be.
---
So you just drop camp wherever you happen to be, interesting, my camp is a bit too sprawling for that.
---
I datamined the files: Unless they've changed it, a magazine with only armour piercing gets 40%, and one with a mix gets 30%.
---
Yeah still doesn't change the fact that this game wouldn't do well on private servers. Especially if it's PC only. 
---
When I think of private servers I think 7 days to die or rust. A place where that server is unique. I don't think that would translate over to FO76 well. It would essentially be a co-op mode.
---
Now if those private server were on console as well AND had community supported mods that would be cool. But Bethesda will never let go of that control. 
---
I am going to go with nope.
---
How many units were sold?  How much money did they make vs cost to produce.
---
Try again
---
Love that player vending is coming
---
yes plz
---
This is a good idea. Thank you so much for sharing a good idea on this shitheap of an excuse for a forum
---
r/forgivememaster 
---
Really? I thought quest rewards went in your inventory, not stash?
---
smh... I can see your point. Do not get me wrong. But there is nothing to base your claim that it was actually designed to be looted in-game, even if a corpse, more of a prop than anything else can justify that.
---
keep in mind, on the contrary to your speculation. many atom shop costumes have variances in-game in the form of rare outfits. For example, the western duster outfit. 
---
Grognax, Silver shroud the unstoppables all of those are atom shop costumes right, although common throughout the fallout series. Can we suggest that they were meant to be looted in game but retracted to the atom shop just cuz they are part of the fallout universe?
---
All in all, these items are their assets and they can distribute them as they please. While I do understand your concern of gaming companies getting carried away with cosmetics and paid walls, we can not claim that they are extracting said items from the actual game to expand on the atom shop.
---
My point is that it was by design. Not scheme. They didn't withdraw the halloween costume and throw it in the atom shop. It was there from the very first day. It sucks that it is an atom shop item, but it was there by design. Hence, it has the atom shop icon on it. I wouldn't be suprised if we could possibly find a rare variance of it later on in the game.
---
I just drop my extra-stuff  at the train stations right in front of the stash boxes. But yes, a HUB city would be awesome! 
---
It's been a reoccurring problem for me since I got the game on release day.
---
Wonder why they can't have an option in the settings for classic power armor ui and a on off toggle. Turn it off and you get the standard ui with an extra bar below AP for current core charge with a number of cores in inventory next to it. 
---
My morning plans just changed, actually.
---
So I'll be on 12am pst your time, not sure if my friend will still be on.
---
I had the same thoughts as you. I hated the HUD and the noise it makes while you walk around. Hated it since fallout 4. Bought myself a fully modded t51-b nuka cola set with jet pack and all the other bells and whistles for 4k caps off a fellow player ... Really helped the with the transitional period. Now I don't even notice the HUD. 
---
Are you one of the 2 remaining devs? I didn't think so. Next.
---
It wouldn't really make lore sense for it to be stronger against all enemies.The interaction between the ultracite in the ammo and the scorched is what makes it so powerful. 
---
I'd just like to be able to convert all my normal shotgun shells I find into ultracite varieties.
---
Do retailers often slash the prices of in demand products?
---
It's the British grenadiers march
---
I can see where that‚Äôs going to happen.  Still I just love all the little
---
Things. The notes to read the tapes to hear.  But fallout always has that burn out point; the open world fatigue!
---
Yes, I'd like to know as well.
---
Bump
---
Would be even cooler to make **Alcohol**
---
LOL that makes no sense. Why would a-15/18 style weapons be phased out for outdated CETMEs? 
---
i reckon they will release when they open the enclave presidential mission that currently you cant do either. :)
---
How does Plague Walker function with other players? Do you damage them them, too? If you damage them, do you acquire a bounty?
---
Asking for a friend. A friend who is me.
---
I don't think I've ever come across a developer that didn't encourage feedback. It's not a Bethesda special. :P  But it doesn't mean they're asking for big design ideas to fill their free time, either. I'm sure in most cases the feedback gets filed but only implemented when it aligns with their own vision and resources.
---
It's not stupid, since everyone gets a warning to move and if they stay it's their fault. 
---
If your camp is on the Whitesprings grounds, you should *expect* it to get nuked. 
---
... This is brilliant. Yes this a thousand times yes.
---
I feel like when they say they don‚Äôt want to spoil something, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt have much yet
---
i wouldnt know, im not gonna stay near vendorbot pheonix anyways kus i dont wanna waste ammo on protectrons
---
Oh, you can still kill THEM, they just don't shoot FIRST.
---
Check r/market76. A lot of players who run stores will do random give aways or a session where theyll hangout at their base and craft serums or power armor mods and give them away. Its all possible because players usually donate items in return for the free services
---
I'd like to see this, but not at Whitesprings. It's weird and out of place in the world, visually that is, and there are too many performance impacts. 
---
I want them to make a new location specifically as a player hub.
---
I got the furthest I‚Äôve ever gotten into a silo today just for it to crash as I was restoring the mainframe core... level 50, 3rd attempt so far.
---
Consider checking /r/fo76bazaar or /r/fo76marketplace, prices will vary by platform.
---
AR is a Maxim MG FG42 hybrid. Though you could make the case the it's direct impingement operating system and not the long stroke piston the FG42 or the short recoil the Maxim used.
---
Oh my god yes please 
---
while this is anecdotal, my AA handmade (max level) "feels" stronger with a drum mag than with a 10 round stinging or even 35 round perforating.  
---
I'm sure this is placebo, coupled with, i'd assume,the AA effect is multiplicative so you get diminishing returns due to the anti-armor legendary effect being \~50% anyway.
---
I played 250 hours completely on my own, only now am I playing with other people. Experiencing all the story alone was great, now I'm doing endgame stuff with friends. 
---
I loved it at first.
---
The world is absolutely gorgeous (outside of trees that look almost straight out of a pixel art game). The voice acting is top notch. And it's Fallout... a franchise I've been playing since the 90s.
---
But as you play the charm starts to wear. Bugs are everywhere. Not small things... random item loss, frequent crashes, massive loot lag in "busy" areas like a recently nuked. Then there's the near complete radio silence on major issues and an almost non-existant roadmap (other than a rather iffy sounding pvp survival mode).
---
The game feels hollow. The lack of NPCs might sound great on paper, but you're doing quests for robots and recordings of the dead. Oh and there far too many freshly dead "NPCs" giving a sense of "oh you just missed them".  Not to mention multiple factions you join that have zero effect on you or the game world. Just boxes to check off on an overly large to do list.
---
It's a skeleton of a game. There are signs of greatness, but it's buried under mediocrity and bugs.
---
And I'm so very sad about it.
---
I would wager that 90% of the angry posts about issues and/or quitting are by people who love Fallout. And have nothing to gain by the game failing.
---
They're just in shock that this is where it ends.
---
Lol I thought the same thing when I was playing. "No wonder theyre all dead, all they have is laser weapons"
---
100 percent agree player onlive coop fo4.
---
How about an update on your progress?
---
Ever anything good in those? Have a ton of them. 
---
Bug Fixes &gt; Balance &gt; Content
---
The reason we're only getting a PvP mode right now is because we're still mostly on step 1. They've said previously that their roadmap and new content plans have been offput by bug fixing and balance issues.
---
Remember ESO. It'll get better, but it's gonna take time. Unlike ESO, no monthly fee, so you're able to set 76 aside for now and just check in regularly for new content.
---
Damn, is it THAT high? Who are you buying from?
---
I mean Binoculars should add +1 Perception at least lol
---
Yea they changed them to give more of a sense of progression to building.  At this point brick and metal are hard buys for lower level players, which sucks, but it's a nice carrot to chase. 
---
Once you hit a decent level (I'd say around 25-30), it's not hard to get caps. You could buy the plan in 2 days.  
---
Some are real trash. Be careful not to pick up the turdos.
---
I read this as lightning and have been severely disappointed
---
Yes, until you get a good WR legendary. The %50 AP is much better than a tiny DPS increase.
---
Preach, brother! 
---
My build is a silly hybrid of a few things. Nothing too crazy, but it works for what I do.
---
Check that the "quest" is not unchecked in your pipboy.
---
I had the same issue earlier, and the quest was unchecked after requesting a drop.
---
My Anti Armor Mole miner gauntlet and Gatling gun are my most effective weapons. with my instigating power fist right behind
---
Not even close to an MMO.  Battlefield has more player per server.
---
I had noticed that Whitesprings has been remarkably nuke free lately on PC. I am guessing the burn to grind legendaries has finally died?
---
Food could be a lunchbox, or some packaged foods lying around, or stuff like that. Or it could be you could plant some stuff I don't know about that. I think it's food stuff that is available there to pick up in some way. Water can be water purifiers you place down. Some produce a lot of water fast, which is much better than producing it at your camp. If you have a fusion generator plan, or power up a power plant, or one is already powered up and providing energy to a workshop, you can put down a bunch of water purifiers and get a lot of water pretty fast.
---
what does it do?
---
Hoard allllll the plastic...
---
I am currently using my TS Handmade (nothing else, just that) and spam shooting it. I can do more damage with a gauss in theory, but in practice I keep missing those shots for some bloody reason (seriously, I can headshot anything on the move, but can't body-shot a SB? WTF?), so I use my handmade semi-auto and just keep clicking.
---
I know thats just xbox but damn. i killed 20 players before 2019...interesting
---
The only trophies im missing are read 20 magazines (i refuse to read them for shit benefits) and trophies for quests i need to create a new character for.
---
Oh shit.  My bad. 
---
&gt;Him card read good!
---
That's the vendor price now. Brick plans are also around 1k. On the bonus side, you can buy all of them reliably at multiple vendors... no more server hopping. :p
---
&gt; they already got their money... so its not problem
---
"we're working on that and hope to tell you something soon"
---
Which vendor sells Metal? The reliability factor is a godsend.
---
something something canvas texture. Look like little big planet.

No you cant, just walk 6 feet to them and pick them up
---
This would be awesome
---
Short of a rerelease this game is basically dead, sorry op it has no potential and most people already left feeling ripped off 
---
Hell, I could get by with just one rank of Fireproof and ~200 DR.
---
You can make disease cures pretty easily; blood leaf, boiled water, snaptail and firecap. All from the forest. 
---
Vault 76 was ruined on reclamation day when they filled it with balloons and confetti as a permanent place for the new dwellers to start at.
---
But it would've made a great player hub if it wasn't used as a tutorial zone with absolutely nothing of importance in it.
---
Make sure to have your mic ready 
---
You need players lmao
---
‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt flying. It was falling, with style.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve seen it once, got a little laugh
---
Not true. I beat new Vegas on launch week with maybe 1 crash on pc
---
Ikr, now I can theoretically bring down a Scorchbeast in two hits (but I have to get a sneak attack and VATS critical in one shot, and then get another critical).
---
I triggered it at Tyler County Fairgrounds.
---
Hey just saw this. No worries I'm melee üòâ
---
to be fair, this is the same thing people were saying about fo4.
---
Yea haha. It's actually an improvement for high level players, but for anyone who has a hard time farming caps it could suck.
---
I think you can buy all of the building block types from the Whitespring station vendor now. Every time I stop by to sell stuff I see the plans. Otherwise I've also seen metal at Watoga.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought. Works for me, nonetheless. Cheers. :)
---
Am I remembering right that this is what they were doing? I swear there was a plan to patch once a week starting with PC so that they could hot fix things and then push it to consoles. I guess that didn't work out. 
---
I am a bit shocked that they are just leaving massive bugs like the radworm buff in for weeks at a time.
---
\*spots OP's name\*
---
Yeaaaaah, I'm gonna take this particular opinion with a grain of salt. Best of luck, mate.
---
What's your platform?
---
This has never happened to me, I'm guessing it is network related, wire or Ethernet?
---
I would recommend looking at the wikia for it. They have a pretty big list.
---
I've tried ethernet and wireless. I'm on XB1X
---
Can confirm, my dad lost his daily use 3star super sledge and is devestated. CS simply said to submit a bug report
---
The community and friends I have made on it, definitely. I don‚Äôt enjoy it all that much alone, obviously.
---
I have 700 caps 
---
Low level players are more likely to participate, high level players don't bother wasting time and resources farming legendary leather right leg anymore.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and Bethesda advised me to restart my console if this happens frequently. I don‚Äôt know why, but it seems to work. Eventually it comes back, but I restart and I‚Äôm good for a while. 
---
Depending on your platform, maybe that‚Äôs helpful. 
---
Battlefield has 3x as many players per server
---
Only if I can use it's bones to make armor and swords.
---
Once picked they are done in my experience, they will re spawn as normal plants once the zone has expired.

[Pure Violet Flux](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Pure_violet_flux_(Fallout_76))
---
Between crashes, disconnects, the one where your screen is black after fast travelling to Harpers Ferry/Grafton Steel and probably other places, and infinite load screens, there should have been a rejoin last server from the start. But that is fine in hindsight, with these problems still present it needs to be number 1 priority. I can put up with a lot of crap with this game but this stuff is just game breaking broken and not many people will put up with that for long and no doubt has been the cause of many people quitting for good.
---
It is. It's explosive that's takes energy resistance as defense.
---
Mr Buzzy Blade or Mole Miner Gauntlet. 
---
You are looking at decades old glass badly maintained.
---
If it‚Äôs taking you that long to run the silo.....let me
---
Know what you‚Äôre playing on. I can show you how To run it way less 
---
I don't know what you guys are talkin about.. I'm having a blast on this game. Lovin it
---
I no longer fast travel to harpers as this happens too often. Only place that causes me problems with fast travel.
---
Well since they reset the codes I hope
---
You‚Äôre not still doing this.   That would suck
---
I agree. The problem isn't so much that I have to rejoin, it's that when I rejoin I have to rebuy my workshops! 
---
And nevermind new codes are already up
---
shut up before they nerf it
---
Cheating has nothing to do with it.  It's simple RNG.  I mean, I found a 2\* Vampire's Super Sledge at a vendor once that had a +40% swing speed on it.  It may not do as much damage, but you're striking far more often.  It's the difference of, like, 200 dmg every 1.5 seconds of 150 dmg every 1.  Personally, I'll take the latter.  Even though it was Lv. 40 (which is probably why they sold it), it's funny to watch.
---
Servers closed in 3... 2... 1
---
I'll give this a shot. Thanks! 
---
Message me and I‚Äôll add you.  Have to have a mic or can take direction.   Had a hell of a time explaining to someone they needed a hazmat suit or power armor 
---
I have a question, what enemies have armor to be pierced? I know that super mutants and robots but is there a list of enemies that are affected by this somewhere around the web? 
---
exactly my point. it's got 64 player maps and it's not an MMO
---
I'd love to be proven wrong because I absolutely enjoy 76.  But nothing I've seen since release leads me to believe there's some miraculous turnaround in the works, nor do I see where a massive influx of players is supposed to come from that provides a financial justification for spending more money than they have to in order to fix it.
---
you mean it didn't disapear 5 seconds after you killed it?  you lucky s.o.b.
---
Oh awesome. My partner has wanted to light up her roof piece on her camp, cheers!
---
it's multiplayer, you level up your character and equipment, and is in a non-persistent world.  FO76 is closer to battlefield than an MMO
---
I love the gauss for the reasons most people hate it. It is the only rifle that sends a projectile downrange affected by gravity. I love the irony that the only guns that works like real guns are scifi guns.
---
It's not that I like the challenge. I was trained to lead a moving target and factor for drop. For me a challenge is hitting a moving target with a hitscan gun.
---
I have a 2 shot instigating gauss rifle and it will kill things dead dead dead with a sniper shot. Well, I assume it still does. That was pre two shot nerf, and I have not had the heart to log in after it.
---
The downside to one shotting most things is that you don't get the regen loot bonuses. If that is still a thing.
---
30 seems to be about when people can take them out, it's still a hell of an undertaking though, well done!
---
Honestly, I don't see too many Sledgehammers or Super Sledges come up in vendors or as Legendaries.  In some ways, it's just poor odds.  Since they encompass all weapons in the game (in theory), the odds of getting either of these *two* are low.
---
Of course, I say that, and I was swimming in Legendary Tesla Rifles.
---
Do you get to climb on and ride one around the map? That would be awesome.
---
Farm queen faster and more effective 
---
Sounds like bad luck. Whenever I see Fissure Site Prime hit, there are usually 4-8 players in the area. Still haven't fought the Queen myself. The timing is usually bad for me, and I kind of want to do the silo run and nuke the site myself since it feels like part of the story.
---
I already uninstalled after months of playing. I'll re-install it after a year or so
---
Yeah. I don't know. Last week I saw plenty of Prime fissure nukes, so it's not like the nukes weren't flying. 
---
If you're blocked from building because someone else built there, your CAMP will be placed as normal the next time you login without a conflict.  You don't need to do anything.
---
Please take a truck load. 
---
I still have the bug since the BETA ended where I cannot see the in games friends list , worked fine in the beta now just a blank list except for the recent tab
---
This might be the best approach to fixing the legendary system I've heard so far. Bravo.
---
Thank you! It's not exact but incredibly close
---
what are you talking about. I do at least 5 to 6 SBQs a day and I never saw a small crowd. 
---
You are wrong buddy. Regardless of how buggy and glitched the SBQ is, it still drops the best loot possible in the game.
---
Your unfortunate experience doesn't represent it for everyone else. You just had an unlucky server. 
---
FYI: Most of those sentinel assassin's drop from the SBQ. So high level players are always swarming the SBQ. To say the least, that is where I got two of my own pieces from. One of them being very recently.
---
As for the lower levels in SBQ runs, they just make the SBQ soak up more damage with their poor damage output. They aren't like the hobbits from lord of rings bringing salvation to the fight. They are purely there for a good carry. In other words, the guys dishing out the damage have to put in more effort, ammo, and resources to get the fight done.
---
Still better than the main games for me. I'm at 29 myself and have a lot of work ahead of me still, but I feel like this game will stick to me for a very long time when I haven't gotten to 20% completion on Fallout 4.
---
The difference here is that I've actually got gear to farm that matters.
---
In Fallout 4 I played exclusively survival mode. I made two main characters who I did not play very far with. The first one was a pistol sneak character. I would use a silenced 10mm and after level 15 or so I would oneshot basically everything. A bit more and I was undetectable and literally oneshot all my enemies. I found the quest reward 10mm from the railroad thing which was an insane weapon. And that was my character basically completed. I didn't need anything anymore.
---
Then my second character was a melee one, and when I got to diamond city and found the baseball bat it was basically the same thing.
---
With 76 though, I have work to do to get my character completed because there are upgrades for a very long time afterwards, where as on 4 there really weren't. 
---
Correct, it's the 63. This one is new.
---
&gt; best guess
---
It isn't necessary to guess, the benefit of gun magazines is documented and the damage formula is know so the benefit can be calculated.
---
Single-affect AP magazine gives 40% AP  
---
Double-affect AP magazine gives 20% AP  
---
40% AP increases damage by 20.6%  
---
20% AP increases damage by 8.5%  
---
Spear can tear shit up. Pole Hook from Far Harbor. Drill/chainsaw/mrBuzzy are fun for awhile; i found a bloodied mr buzzy this week but its lvl 15, still does about 170@VFAST when its overpowered. Theres a Bone Hammer and a Bone Club. Still cant get that damn untracite gatling laser. And apparently demo expert buffs tomahawks like they are grenades.
---
No, not that I've seen looking at the games files, they didn't add a hidden buff or debuff by armor type 
---
You're not even old enough to spell alcohol and you think you are ready to make it?
---
Goes in and out for me too, I plan to do the following pages.  
---
-Player.  
---
-UI (I think the friends list would go here).  
---
-Quests.  
---
-Locations / Worldspace 
---
(SPOILERS) I've loved the idea of having teams/friends in a Fallout world and I still have fun playing despite bugs. As for the story, I know in Fallout 4 there were complaints about Prestons "go save a settlement" quests, but Fallout 4 had so many other great side quests. I found that the 76 main quest felt disjointed, the links between the introduction to the fractions seemed weak, and the overseer was a side mission? Isn't she sort of our boss? Hers should have been the main mission. Also, I don't really like her much, she talks about her love for her husband yet she abandoned him for the Vaults glory, I would have liked it if she had found out after that they had told her he died before they shut the vault doors and she found out after she returned that he'd been left and turned to a goul and she didn't have the heart to kill him.  A story I did connect with was Abbies, something about the fact that she was so real, her discarded holo tapes as she realizes what a slim chance she'll have of it ever succeeding or that she won't know if it did. Her sort of despairing anger that it seemed hopeless and she was alone. It made we want to finish it in her memory. That one moved me. That said, I agree that it is horrible that you have to help Rose in her quest to build new Raiders, yet you can't set in motion the rebuilding of other factions. It would have been wonderful if like in Fallout 4 you could pick a faction, even if it just steered back to the main quest. As for the PVP integration, I hate to say they should copy another game, but ESO has the wars and it would be cool if we could pick a faction we aligned with (me, Responders or Order of the Mysteries) and you could fight for some tek that would keep the scorched queen off of your factions headquarters and instead she would attack the others or something like that. I'll fight with ally for a cause against others but just picking at other solo players, not what Fallout has ever been. As for the main game/map now, I don't think we need a ton of NPC's but we need some, look at the fandom for Graham. Could we get a mission traveling with him help him find something he needs to set up a trading station or something, my boyfriend and I have gone along with him just helping fight enemies and protecting Chaley the MooMoo, and they can't even be killed. We can't have an emotional connection with a bunch of stale Robots (not to say I didn't love Buddy the drink distributing robot from 4) but we need a little life for it not to feel hopeless. Another one I wish we had more of was when we found some goals (dead because its 76), not feral, but they had been killed and when you heard their holo tapes, begging their family not to kill them, that they were still human, your heart went out to them. I would love to do a quest where I just talk to one and do something that helps their group escape and set up camps away from people, maybe help them build protection like the automated turrits the BOS had. I'm hoping they'll come up with many more stories, side quests, like what happened to the painter on top of the West Tek. Who is behind all the teddy bear stories that are so fun to find? And as far as the "boss fight"  Could maybe the scorch beast drop bits of tek and when you got all the pieces (which would take a while, you can build a legendary/ even a random one, just not a sucky Stalkers Golf Club? That would make killing her worthwhile again. I guess what we need is hope, we need to feel like we are making a difference in keeping things from getting worse. We know the world is still a mess by Fallout 4 timeline. We just want to matter now. 
---
If they implemented this now the dragon would require 50c to fly per square inch and would instead kill you both. Probably eat all the gear afterwards.
---
I read this as ‚Äúlightning‚Äù and was a bit shocked. 
---
Where did you get this?
---
*Insert the "Why not do both" meme here*
---
Station just to group up against the SBQ.. I'd be down for that!
---
Totally.  And I think being able to "rent a room" at the Whitespring could be fun. Get access to the upstairs and other currently-locked areas of the Hotel for... I dunno, fun stuff! Clean rooms at the *very* least.
---
Basically zero endgame content.
---
Changing the rules to make life harder on dupers is a bad call imo.  
---
The game should be built around whatever the average player is up to not the extreme ends of the spectrum.  
---
Oh I am with you, just saying it's an FPS and has 3x the server capacity no way is 76 an "mmo" lite
---
That seems like an exaggeration, but even apart from that, you can only engage them when they land. Sure you can do it, if you like standing around getting face blasted every second by blinding graphics, but I wouldn't call it fun.
---
You keep trying and failing.
---
I love how this sub has finally went from "ITs AlL tHe DuPErS FaUlT" to actually blaming the shitty servers. Such a nice change but too little too late imho
---
i wish it would go in and out for me it hasnt worked since the beta stopped
---
Marriage material
---
I'm 50. Play everyday after work on Ps4
---
So does the Grafton vendor in town. 
---
Uh, basically no units were sold. By local best buy cant even give it away for free on bundles, it's that bad.
---
&gt; they can move pacifist to full 100% block damage 
---
They *can* but will they?
---
 Maybe, but you seem to be making a lot of assumptions. 
---
the Whitespring Resort seems like everyones fav spot lol
---
&gt;We want to be detailed without giving away too many spoilers on what's to come. 
---
Honestly that's a luxury for devs with a good record. If they want back in the communities good graces they need to cut the coy "spoiler" teases and go for full and fast transparency. When people are satisfied with what's going on under the hood then you guys can start worrying about surprises again.
---
Ouch, that's brutal 
---
I'm beginning to think that too, despite there being an apparent recipe online. 
---
Too little too late.
---
Wow man, I mean this with the utmost respect but I can't believe you're still doing this.  Putting in more work than the entirety of the dev team for this game (except maybe the shitty atom shop).  Keep it up in hopes of a decent game but I've given up at this point :(
---

---
Have hopped both grafton vendors for 2 days. Nothing in their stock is changing. Also, morgantown airport vendor had identical stock to grafton station. 
---
Right, I definitely agree. I‚Äôm not saying everything BGS does need me to focus on stopping cheaters. The vast majority of the players just want content, bug fixes, and APPROPRIATE balances made. However, as most companies with online games, stopping cheaters becomes part of their normal thought process because it ruins the game for normal gamers and decreases the overall value of their product. 
---
Challenges. 
---
106? You might be *insane*
---
Was at camden park a few days ago. I thin watoga may also be an option. 
---
You shouldn't. Just play Anthem right around the corner 
---
Anyone else have the death grips guillotine mod for fo4?
---
https://youtu.be/JJLstJzbolQ
---
XPonz78. Pretty casual but always available to team up.
---
Unless it has changed since FO 4, they will not eat your Brahmin or food and act like a living turret system. 
---
In FO 4 they could also die, often relatively easily, although that depended somewhat on their strength compared to the attacker. 
---
What I don't know and am curious about is whether they have different levels of aggressiveness. I don't really like it when my turrets pick fights with every random enemy nearby who had been ignoring my camp previously.
---
There are a lot of vendors that have a connected inventory. Google it, but there are 7 different vendor money pools. The responders and raiders have a lot of connected vendors.
---
Duh Yes, seeing as how common flux was BEFORE the war!  
---
So you see what happens when not even two shits are given when it comes to lore and immersion?
---
Armor weight affects sneak. If you're doing it right, you won't get hit at all, so you can plan all of your armor accordingly. I use 5 pieces of item weight reduction armor with a smattering of other nonsense that's only marginally effective on my crit sniper, and he doesn't die except occasionally in nuke zones while wearing hazmat.
---
Then patch 1.5 hit, and I made a melee/shotgun toon because the stealth and crit nerfs were just absurd.
---
Thanks..?  
---
I'm struggling with it, won't lie...   
---
Between the downvote train, trolls, lack of Response from Bethesda and an unplayable game ATM, it's hard.   
---
Really struggling with the remaining 3 or 4 pages I need to put up, like the thought of the quests one is making me pucker a bit...  
---
There is a delay some times before the counter updates
---
We need more people like you. :)
---
That's what I told my friends!
---
This would be cool if we could get at least 50 players per server. When max is 24 and they are not even full. It's just a ghost town everywhere you go.
---
I got a TS .44 revolver in White Springs this evening. 3*
---
Odd. I've been in and out of my excavator armor all day.
---
Do you get out as soon as the game loads in?
---
Woooosh
---
Every vendor I go to has a counter that says 106.  It does not move even after completing sales.
---
Instigating and two shot are mutually exclusive, but a two shot explosive or instigating explosive with a third star should run you 3-5k
---
brilliant. this needs to happen. all the stuff i have gathered for late game mods, I am sure you guys that are 100+ would want them more than I need them at this point.
---
Jus gehv us privaut servers ahlready ya rad-toads!
---
Love the idea but with servers only holding like 24 players and no text chat it would be pretty pointless. People would have found a place to gather and congregate already if that was something that was something that was going to happen in this game. As it is it is very rare I even encounter another person and then if they don't just ignore you that is like hitting the lottery.
---
Hey with my game freezing for a second or 2 every 8-10 seconds it'll take me years to finish the game. So please no new content. Here's hoping it runs better before new stuff is added.
---
90 days is about right to get a decent understanding for a large code base. Takes around a year to know the complete architecture if no one is around to tell you.
---
Thanks guess I got farming to do
---
Regarding displaying items as decor in C.A.M.P.: I would love to have the **wall-mounted gun display racks** from FO4. The armor displays were nice too.
---
My other wishlist item for C.A.M.P.s is **player-owned vendor bots**. Just transfer items to be sold to the bot's inventory, and set the sale price. It would be nice if they could have a list of stuff to buy from other players, too, though I can imagine that menu system being cumbersome since it would be a list of every item in the game. They had player owned vendors working fine in Ultima Online in 1998, so I'm sure now that we live in the future this feature should be no sweat. ;)
---
define an mmo and i'll explain why the game is LIKE (keyword LIKE because as i said before, people are discounting the label on virtue of servers not holding many players and at once which even games like WoW do) an mmo 
---
Same.  Also, a random piece of my power armor will unequip itself every time i open up a transfer menu.
---
Where would you say is the best place to get a good amount of each type of flux?
---
I wouldn't call the 7th day end game content.  It is just the day you have to defend yourself from a horde of zombies.
---
Increased storage and building supplies would be nice regardless 
---
people are being pedantic. they're caught up on the massively part of mmo when i'm saying that it is LIKE an mmo. 
---
lots of the games aspects are relatable to other mmos on the market, just presented differently because of the nature of the game. 
---
I agree on the repair thing. I don't want to run around looking for a couple melons before I can repair everything else, or have to place my junk over again.
---
Thank you
---
Its a spelling mistake, so what? Its a valid question.  I'm just trying to post something neat that isn't another "fo76 is bad and the Devs should feel bad cuz reasons" post.  Lighten up
---
Yeah nah, people just gave up on the notion that Bethesda is competent enough to stop the dupers. 
---
This!
---
I just received one as a gift.  I've been looking for it FOREVER!!!  I was told to scrap it in order to learn the plan, so I did.   IT WORKED!!!  Here's a pic below:

---
Because for console you have to pay a fee and has to go though MS/Sony first. So it is better to just release large patches monthly. 
---
Pretty awesome!
---
Thanks for the rebuttal, I can see where you're coming from. I just have this feeling that the game will die and we won't even be left with any sort of afterlife. 
---
I like options, and I know damn well that when mods open up with private servers that are supposed to come up later (i think that's what they said? A year or so after release? I don't recall...) There will be new stories and such added by modders. 
---
I imagine a fo76 where people can build their own version of the game (story/lorewise) and they can share their servers with others. I have some stories I think would fit well in the fallout universe, but I'd fancy myself more as a person that could steer a story, not write the code.
---
I agree with this, a safe area where people can hang out would be nice. Having to look out 24/7 is pretty tiring. In other fallout games there were always city‚Äôs and towns where you were safe, you could craft and explore.
---
Yeah I don't think this game has that all worked in. I'm pretty sure all they do is merely lower the armor stats. So not a big difference against low armor mobs, but shouldn't be a reduction either. 
---
Give Bethesda a break, it was just national eat breakfast for ice cream day and all the devs were spending time with their family. President's day is right around the corner as well so they need some time off for that as well. Now we can maybe fit you in for a hotfix sometime around Q2 2019 if that works for you?
---
"It ain't much, but it's honest work"
---
I agree, vault 76 had potential that was lost.
---
battlefield doesnt have a persistent world, fallout 76 does. battlefield places players in an instance to have a match. 
---
You level up a profile and equipment but the contexts are entirely different. You loot and craft equipment in 76 just like mmos. you can trade with other players and keep your new things across the game and you can sell or just drop it. You build your character through perk cards in a roundabout rpg character tree, can respec and choose different cards like you would respec in other mmos. You can party up and take on quests that have a story like in other mmos. fetch quests, kill quests, etc. There's conditional pvp like other mmos (like hunter/hunted). Player housing through the CAMP system. Professions reflected through the lens of the game like gun nut, cooking perks, repair perks etc. 
---
Is your game data corrupted? Because I've not had a crash in months.
---
Its not a personal network error, actually its been a hot topic tonight across all platforms that the servers have been shit. In general though at any time,  Its kind of silly at this point in FO76's history to suggest a personal network error over server error.  Guess you might be one of the lucky ones though who don't experience constant DC's even with a decent network?
---
Gonna check it out
---
Congrats on a comment worthy of /r/cringe. Stop being a fanboy. This game turned Bethesda into EA. 
---
There's nothing persistent about the map in FO76. Every time you log in it's exactly the same as the first time you logged in. The only difference is what the players have done, like BF
---
Here are my ideas for a player hub
---
I think the player hub should be in a whole new world sepreat from West Virginia 
---
Smaller then West Virginia
---
It could support bunch of players
---
Be accesed from the main menu or a by going to certain location in game
---
Fireproof3 negates thier damage in the air entirely. As melee, I'll watch you shoot it the whole time and still 1-2 shot it when it lands, so you wasted bullets. A scorchbeast dies with one quick attack from full health if im running low health/high dmg, 1 power attack followed by one quick attack if my health is full and I'm not in outrageous damage mode. Typically when fighting the queen her health bar quite literally only moves when I hit her, unless another well built melee is there. I've even been disconnected and her health has not moved at all with the 12 ranged people shooting her. Where as if I run nerd rage I can drop her in one landing at times. 
---
Melee is extremely OP, this entire game is not very difficult. 
---
It would be well served with interesting mechanics that matter, such as actually wanting to dodge the poison or whatever that they cropduat you with.
---
More like they fixed the exp exploit with ghouls.
---
Depends on what you're going for, I suppose. If you want to maximize damage then you'd want the perforating magazine.
---
But in your case it sounds like you'd be fine sacrificing a bit of damage in exchange for the ammo capacity
---
what do you think persistent means?
---
Game is working as intended, as designed.  Your the interesting content keeping the grieving assholes around. Gratz
---
I don't even really care about caps, but time. Time and effort that are lost are much more precious than caps.
---
I mean when you put it like that what's the difference from the people you meet online?
---
This still happens to me on PC. Acts funky on zooming in - sometimes it zooms out after I‚Äôve been holding the aim button, sometimes I have to click it again because it won‚Äôt leave, and sometimes it un zooms after a couple of seconds
---
I see your point, but those aren‚Äôt always safe.
---
I actually came across a thread where a player was recommending a sort of player hub, a closed off area where it‚Äôs truly safe.
---
Anyways I don‚Äôt know about the enclave HQ or BOS HQ yet. I just started playing after a long break from the game and I haven‚Äôt had much time to explore. Still on some of the early quests, but you could be right.
---
The tide is turning and now the mob's ire is starting to focus on the Austin Studio. With the "we can't wait to tell you / no spoilers" info we are getting from Bethesda it really isn't that surprising that there is so much wild speculation. It will likely be years before we get a hint of what really sank the ship, if ever.
---
Laughter, it‚Äôs the best weapon in this sick joke of a fight. ;)
---
It‚Äôs not. 
---
And taking 0 Damage from the Attack via Fireproof/Dense. I don‚Äôt really care what you call fun. 
---
I've experienced 4 infinite loading screens on XB1.  Each time it was fast travelling back to Poseidon to collect my fusion cores after 30 min.  Or feeling crazy and spending 50 caps to fast travel across the map, only to have those caps wasted.
---
that's what battlefield has as well, it's just got more than one of them.
---
By flop I meant critical disaster. Things can flop critically. Both by the public and professional reviewers. It's seen as one of the worst games of all time, because it is. 
---
I didn't know experimental meant *barely works consistently for an hour* or that chaotic journey meant *barely works consistently for an hour*.  I have the last week never once stopped playing by going to quit.  I get disconnected in a horrendous spot, and am too weary to spawn back in to the enemies I just killed, to have to rehack the same computers and lockpick the same stuff all while overencumbered this time around.  I just put the controller down until I'm feeling up to *dealing with it* again.
---
I might still play but that doesn't mean I can't be upset over the poor quality of an experience I'm left with after each time I play.  At this point it almost feels unhealthy to go back, I just want to play with my friend but damn it we'll seriously never get to hold workshops, do powerplants, or farm sbq or nuke zones at this rate because by the time it's all fixed we'll be so sick and tired of everything that we had to deal with that just thinking of the game invokes painful memories of vast disappointment that'll continually sour any further experience.
---
It's like eating rotten eggs or shrimp, after you've puked them up the sight of them alone triggers your gag reflex.
---
I've had it happen in Excavator and X01 specifically. Haven't tried the others yet. 
---
It can happen at any time. Any time I load the game or fast travel, it's like a 50/50 chance that I'm stuck in the armor until I reload or fast travel again.
---
I sort of see where he‚Äôs coming from, as in everyone and their mom (those who‚Äôve never played a fallout title) decided to review it just so they could shit on it. That being said, pretty much everything that people were saying was accurate and honest about the game.
---
Those, and Mole Miners.
---
And, this is just a guess, but I'd also assume large creatures like yao guai, deathclaws, and scorch beasts would have higher damage resistance 
---
Those aren't ideas for a player hub. Those are ideas for an expansion.
---
Alright I stand corrected, sounds like you know what you're talking about. I don't run mutations, usually don't run any melee damage perks (just Incisor and Martial Artist) leaving room for weight reduction perks, and don't run bloodied.
---
Yup, the biggest bother was when it wouldn‚Äôt unzoom for 3 or 4 seconds after I let go of the aim trigger. 
---
This was a huge problem for because the rifle was my main weapon so every combat scenario was frustrating 
---
Been reworking my whole build around the 3* Bloodied RNG blessed me with last week.  Is gud shit.
---
Sit back and watch as your game lags like hell, and crashes.
---
That's funny, the amount of fixes we have got so far seems more like the work of one underpaid programmer working part time. No way there is someone let alone multiple people working 8 hours a day on this game.
---
Good lord. This issue alone warrants a detailed developer blog/post-mortem on it, and this is just one of many ongoing severe issues with the game.
---
Man, I'd kill for an honest, transparent post-mortem of the development up to launch and an idea of what they legitimately thought the reaction would be and what plans they had for the immediate future.
---
This games scope and depth of its issues - both abysmal design choices and an apparently near complete lack of any QA being "does this brick machines?" - are astounding to me as someone who has followed online gaming/MMO's for decades.
---
Yeah it'd have to be placebo I guess, since the more you stack the better your damage has to be.
---
And remember that obviously you'll only see a big difference on the heavily armored mobs. Like for my build, I use heavy guns and I have the 45% AA perk, plus an AA .50 cal and it just RIPS through mole miners.
---
Einstein and Schrodinger were discussing the General Relativity of Gaming. Schrodinger had a thought experiment later would be known as Schrodinger's Ban. Basically it involved exploiting and hacking the crap out of a game before you quit. Then when you quit how do you know if you are banned or not? You are simultaneously banned and not banned at the same time. hehe.
---
Thanks to all the grief energy weapons have gotten, I didn‚Äôt even bother with them. Then I got a random drop for a Tesla rifle. It had higher damage than any other gun I was carrying, I was low on ammo, and was carrying like 600 cells for no reason, so I said, ‚Äúwhatever, I‚Äôll use this to conserve ammo. It‚Äôll probably break after a few shots anyway. Oh wow! The shot arcs between enemies!‚Äù
---
So I was prepared for it to break in no time, and the repairs would be stupid expensive. But that didn‚Äôt happen. The durability barely moves on it, and it‚Äôs incredibly cheap to repair.
---
And that‚Äôs how I unexpectedly found my favorite weapon. 
---
WhiteSpring for everything except Violet. Fissure Prime for Violet.
---
MorganTown is pretty decent for everything except violet I think, some violet if the community garden gets nuked. WhiteSpring and FP are your best bet.
---
If you are on PC there's a mod to remove that vignette.
---
Prices went up since everything is available at the vendors now for the most part
---
These were amazing to follow, and really lit up the creations subreddit! Thanks for sharing your badass art!
---
Also I seriously want letterhead with your ‚Äúfrom the desk of‚Äù on it, curse zazzle and its copywritten content policies. But, supporting the artist is better, so do you do commissions?
---
Get the 3 level bargain before buying, also use other things such as grape Mentats to boost your buying power.  Should be much less than that ..
---
Very very odd.
---
Yet we are getting downvoted

Country Roads and the track by The Beach Boys are out of period music for fallout. So no, I must disagree with the music.
---
Just means it grows and produces faster, you still need to build water pumps and plant food.
---
Only Sunshine has a good producing machine as far as I know.
---
There is a water purifier ready to go at Charleston Landfill, just needs power.
---
Never even thought about an indoor garden. I always think of outdoor plants as distractions for intruding enemies.
---
It feels better? Alright...
---
Thank you!
---
Impressive!
---
This happens to me a lot.  Xbox. I‚Äôve tried clearing cache and restarting but it seems to randomly pop up.  Last night I was lucky enough to log back into my same server.  I usually try to do a mass collection by waking to my shop before I fast travel just in case.  Reconnect to last server needs to be an option.  
---
I can only write so much about 3 minutes of gameplay.
---
It was a shit show on launch. Broken quests literally trapping people in zones, you could hardly play with your friends because almost everything was instanced. The people who grinded their way to Vet Ranks literally ran people into the ground in PvP (it's for people who grinded to be better, but it was actually comical how big the disparity was in the beginning), and in general the game was getting shit on, to the point that people *still* write it off because of how bad the beta and launch were.
---
I'm not here to say either launch was worse, because FO76 hasn't run it's course yet. But ESO was pretty far into failure land on launch and through the first year. 
---
Empathy is trash.  Total trash.   Just stop
---
Solution: Have two separate Vault 76s.
---
Players start in the tutorial vault.
---
Then later on, Vault 76 reopens for whatever reason, and it's a new area. 
---
Buy a lottery ticket.
---
Tons 
---
Definitely. 
---
Title was short but it did insinuate inon's game OST, not third party advertising songs.
---
Are you equating the valid explanation of Christmas and New Years to meaningless "holidays"? Because if so, you're a selfish idiot that's clearly just looking for a reason to hate Bethesda.
---
I believe so as when you jump in you un equip all your armor someone correct me if I'm wrong please.
---
NEVER!
---
 none of your other armor works while in power armor
---
Not to mention, if we're talking thematically, Metro Exodus will be way more in line with the original Fallouts than 76.
---
Plastic is easy once you've joined the BoS. Go to Fort Defiance, take the elevator to the top and grab all the plastic cutlery, plates, trays, and pool balls. Quick and easy and you get a ton of it. While you're there hop downstairs for straight jackets and ballistic fiber. 
---
They really aren't that bad if you know what you are doing and have a build that is working for your weapons. The people complaining about them constantly  are either really bad at the game or way to low a level to even be going near them.
---
Ya we need more than 24 ppl per world to make this true mmo. I love the map/world 1but it does feel empty too often 
---
tomorrow? or have they said anything since that
---
I can't help but wonder if 76 can be polished like ESO though. Everybody has pretty strong memories of FO4, and 76 several years later managed to keep most of the bugs modders fixed, and introduce some new ones as well.
---
Agreed. Best to not say anything in this situation. 
---
I'd like to say first, stop supporting EA dont buy anthem since respawn was bought by ea in December 2018.
---
Second, does anyone have the profits and investments from Bethesda over the game yet to see or get a feel of where they might go? I don't have a crunchbase premium account so cant find much
---
Ugh. This reminds me that I STILL haven't unlocked the 35 round mag for my handy.
---
Great write-up, though üòâ
---
no dates have been given.
---
Sweet. Will add when I get home.
---
I would still lose. But that isn't responding to question.
---
In the ini file there was a automaten every 10 minutes so if unlucky you have to play those 10 minutes over if you dont get to the 10 minutes before you disconnect. Really annoying.
---
Unless they‚Äôre only hiring entry level developers. It may take a significant amount of time to really know your way around the code base, but it wouldn‚Äôt take anyone worth their salt to get some meaningful work done after a week or two in. I say this as a software engineer. I don‚Äôt develop games but code is code for the most part.
---
Mid-march they say. We're expecting another Inside the Vault on Thursday. Don't expect much information until then.
---
I've been saying for months we need something like vault City from fallout 2
---
Can't imagine why else they are doing next to nothing to fix the game. Maybe you can enlighten me? 
---
Sorry,  they hired a new cleaner and they're still trying to explain that it's perfectly normal that their potted plants grow through the solid walls.
---
Anyone know how to say "occlusion blocks" in Tagalog?
---
Except that a lot of these positions mention FO 76, explicitly. 
---
I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know how to check. I don‚Äôt feel like checking. I‚Äôve done nothing to the game files. I don‚Äôt think it would be unfair to assume it was the game‚Äôs fault. Especially because I got 3-5 minutes into the game with no crashing and only a slight amount of lag.
---
If it's just veins don't bother (just single rocks you can hit once). If it's deposit (a depression in the ground that you can hit multiple times) than yes, it's worth moving your CAMP. You can build an extractor for deposits, not veins.
---
you are telling me I keep disconnecting every time I try to finish the ID part at the DMV going on a hour and 30 minutes now I have not a fucking clue what else I can do. I have a 1GB by 1GB internet and I have my settings set up to allow for the fastest connection possible to their servers.
---
It's mid March for the launch of pvp servers, there can still be patches before then.
---
That's it; you're a bloody champion!
---
[Link](https://youtu.be/PGrxHO-B2TY)
---
But you look cool when you get out of the armor...
---
Its their instability issues and we all suffer to some extent. In the DMV quest you can acess the computer and change the number to your number. Saved a lot of time for me.
---
I usually just go to recently met players and rejoin the server of the most recent player. Usually all my stuff is there still. You just have to reclaim the workshop 
---
Fallout is cool, hence the down votes. The angry chumps bang their fists on the table because they want it to be theirs. Too bad games legit fallout is legit. RuneScape is still a safe Haven I hear.
---
So conclusion, for damage always for for perforating? Its definitively better then stinging? 
---
Battle ground would
---
Be cool if we all had 10 times benefit from every trait and item except the damage we can deal
---
Which stays un multiplied. Then it will be actual
---
Battle and not an Insta kill contest
---
\*Reposting question here\*
---
Certain quests require you to hit the check points in a single session or else you need to start them from scratch. Everything you do stays the same (things collected, damage taken etc..) except the quest chain resets.
---
I bought 76 at the suggestion of a friend who is objectively a better gamer than I am. Better at fighting enemies, better at understanding weapons and armor, better at figuring out quests.
---
Since I'm lousy with fighting, weapons and armor I just went with a straight melee build, with a high strength and every perk card to support that build. I just basically wanted to stay alive.
---
Little did either of us know I would have the stronger, easier to live with build. And yes I have Incisor maxed out. 
---
A little place where we could set up trade stalls would be good fun, actually. The only problem is people would dupe and mule to sell more stuff. 
---
I‚Äôm surprised all the bits of rebar on raider armor don‚Äôt crush you when you climb into the suit.
---
its a nightmare I am never making another character.....
---
Nice.
---
Everyone wants this, the idea of eating our bobble and magazines is really not resonating to the players. They should be added to ones that we know, like plans are, and then managed what ones are equipped to use via the perks screen. Obviously they would be limited by having only a few equipped at once and activated for either short burst of increased power or the 1-2 hour boost like some of them. 
---
I can‚Äôt make it through a single play session without my rifle breaking, and before patch 5, I went a week w/o it breaking.  Someone put a ; in the wrong spot or too many 0‚Äôs on the equation!! 
---
Lol
---
If you're on PS4, I am xa0t1ca (the o is a zero) and have wayyyyyy more plans &amp; recipes than I need. I try to give them away regularly -- and often for free because I have so many -- but most people who initiate trades don't seem interested so far. Level 51, I don't have many lower level weapons but would be happy to craft some if you stop by my camp.   
---
I don't usually have a mic though but if you appear and make the trade emote, I'll get the hint ;)
---
no i mean the patch with the scorch beast fix
---
I had the same issue with a BoS quest. There's not many of them in the game that operate like that thankfully. 
---
That's likely accurate, although there could be some incentives (challenges, trade-related events, etc) which could lure people into hanging around longer than is typical.   
---
Also, although I'm still not a super high level player &amp; often avoid 'spoilers', it does seem like Whitesprings getting nuked attracts a bunch of people... so there could potentially be some event related to trading immediately afterward or etc. 
---
Yes. Damn, how you know that?!?
---
Short of something wrong with your cable, router or ISP. I don't know what would cause that to happen. 
---
Bad coding.
---
With all the good people have already pointed out about this game (which I personally, wholeheartedly agree with), it doesn't feel to me like passion is what's missing. This feels like a Mass Effect Andromeda situation where there was an immense amount of corporate meddling, infighting among the team, and poor communication that lead to a potentially great entry in an iconic franchise being hobbled by the most asinine of decisions. Both games have evidence of where they could have gone and an apparent overabundance of passion, but something happened behind closed doors that lead one to be mediocre and the other to flop horribly. I just hope they figure it out and fix this game and not drop it like ME:A was abandoned.
---
that ship has long since sailed. 
---
only way to save this cesspool of a game is to go full FFXIV remake on it 
---
Gonna use chameleon legendary so I can't be VATS-killed.
---
Yet why would i be free of the problems then?
---
There is evidence that this body should contain loot, the other Trick-orTreaters are evidence. Both the skeleton and witch bodies drop the plans to make their respective costume. The vampire is the only one who drops nothing but the holo tape. I should have made this more clear in the post,  I may add this detail in if it starts to get more attention.
---
The western duster is not a variant of an in game item. It is an outfit from the minutemen in fallout 4. The western outfit and western outfit w/ chaps in game are much more of a cowboy cosmetic. I have both. The other variants you mentioned earlier (clown and Spacesuit) are not ‚Äúrare‚Äù, all have persistent spawns within world.
---
I am fine with the unstoppable being a Atomic Shop item as the only time a cosmetic was in game before was for a very specific quest in fo4. There is no connection to this game other than the order of mysteries, and we do have that costume. The Halloween costumes, including vampire, do have a place in the game, through the costume shop.
---
Again, this is about future content being placed behind pay walls. They own the game and the shop and can decide what is fair, but I have a right to call out their business practices if they are short selling me. You wouldn‚Äôt buy a brand new car then have to pay for air conditioning later. 
---
And now you are jumping to the conclusion that they made this decision when designing the costume, when clearly the body is set up with the same drop mechanics as the others. Bethesda has shown unwillingness to be transparent about what the customer can expect when purchasing a product. This isn‚Äôt about what they did at launch, it‚Äôs about what they plan to do in the future. Or would you prefer more disasters like the canvas bag, nuka dark rum, AS cosmetics being marketed as outfits, but actually being under armors, and in game holiday emotes (which they actually did change)?
---
A lot of people are still holding out hope for future content updates that could save the reputation of the entire release. The player base needs to be clear with Bethesda what we expect of them, so that the next ES or Starfield or ID Software game turns out like FO76 did. The Star Wars fan base was able to make real change with the battlefield franchise. If we want to save Fall our from becoming another punch line in a joke about micro transactions and poor releases, we have to hold BHS accountable.
---
You trying to defend them, before we know for sure if they did or didn‚Äôt is the very reason we are on this mess in the first place. Weak defenses and excuses don‚Äôt help make AAA gaming better, I just turns every game into a corporate cash grab at the expense of the loyal fans wallets.
---
I don't think anyone can answer that, not even bethesda.  But we can get a "I'll let the dev team know!" occasionally.
---
You are doing an incredible job at this, your diligent and meticulous approach is praiseworthy. If the devs don't leverage them for reference it's a huge miss.
---
At a minimum these are a virtual job application.  
---
Grab me another beer while you're at it
---
It does/did have huge potential. It's a real shame. I don't think anyone disagrees that the map itself is amazing. Easily one of my favorite fallout worlds. I thought the story itself was almost there. The narrative came fast early on, then all of a sudden it's over with no real conclusions. I think they did a great job with cryptids.
---
All that being said, it's like they came up with an idea for a new fallout, went halfway then just stopped. They threw in multiplayer when it really doesn't work or have much benefit. Then there's the bugs, the duping, the balancing issues. They've shown no imperative to fix anything. It's embarrassing really. I've sunk more hours than I can count into FO3, NV and Skyrim, but I'm really pretty much done with this whether I want to be or not.
---
This exists? I get the look (you know what i mean) anytime i sit down to play my shit. üòÇ
---
So because you didn‚Äôt have a crash it‚Äôs impossible that anyone has ever had this game crash on them unless the person playing did something wrong? That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm tapping out.
---
If not that, at least join the subreddit discord LFG channel, there's always people doing prime who will jump on your server to down the queen.
---
Yep. 
---
I like this general concept but wonder if it would create work for customer service / QA.   
---
I can picture people submitting "bug" reports because they tried to buy something, totally forgot they did it, leveled up a bunch of times, then a bunch of caps disappeared from their inventory &amp; they sulked. Obviously that's their problem, but I feel like if they weren't reminded about it periodically via some method other than remembering to visit the hub, it could become an issue. This likely wouldn't be as much of a problem for higher level players, though, so if the hub didn't become available until a certain level and/or was difficult to access solo or etc, that might minimize that issue.
---
and then you woke up..  :\
---
Only thing I can really think of is the impossibility yo find certain weapon and armor mods (BoS) at shops since the merchant update.
---
I love the web interface idea... but is that common in other cross-platform games? It seems like it could be difficult to implement
---
Thank you yet again for your continued efforts. Your dedication n perseverance are very much appreciated. 
---
She's pretty hot, I'd toss it to her.
---
Just pick them up, while wearing Excavator PA. Suddenly I have hundreds of ore and didn‚Äôt realize
---
I love fallout.
---
a. they could slowly be introduce npcs and quest content as we retake Virginia
---
b. implement hundreds of qol suggestions
---
c. increase loot variety and content variety (not just white springs... everywhere should be fun and rewarding)
---
d. make current content more rewarding like control areas
---
Why can i build a magazine rack and not do anything with it.  Lol.  This ass backwards game.
---
Thanks!  
---
Might want to stay an enthusiast, if it's any indicator, good chance it would be harder to do if it was a job! ;)
---
Yes, the leveled lists are glitched, honestly I can see one of the issues with them (cap on total number of plans that can display) but honestly don't see what's causing the Toxic Valley vendors to display them.
---
Ad Victoriam brother, may he Rest In Peace. Rest assured knowing that those memories are something to be happy about and know that everything old was once new and that you can still carve out new adventures and memories!!!
---
I don't know how you can even stay on this site at all. It's full of people like him.
---
Battle Hymn of the Republic I think.
---
probably they want to change to f2p when the pvp servers fired up and they want get more money with atom shop...
---
Wow! So much effort. 
---
It's literally at the top of the subreddit.
---
Not gonna lie it is pretty damn hilarious that there are still people in this sub who think it is acceptable for a AAA studio to release a AAA online game in mid November broken as fuck and then disapear until after new year's. It was a pretty big sign back then that any real support for this game was over before it started but now that that is over and people still think the holidays are why they weren't doing shit really does give me a good chuckle. 
---
" **honestly be the best MMO** " have u seen rust or ark before?
---
Yep, I think the only way they could really fix it all is to wipe everything &amp; start everyone over with all the updates in place. That won't happen, and business wise it would be smarter to not invest any more money in a sinking ship.
---
Either they sink more money into a game that has a very low return on that investment, or they put that into a new game that will amaze people and redeem their brand.
---
tried that
---
yeh..nothing there
---
Great work.  This game doesn't deserve you!
---
I was baffled when I saw that. I was like... did he just pull the Final Fantasy XI Auction House and suggest this lol.. 
---
A list of values for items bought, sold, and timestamps would be mandatory. But, let's get real, they have the same bugs and worse since day 1. Doubt the interns know how to code AHs.
---
nice...will.try that..iv been going to watoga school
---
Yesss this would make the game so fun. I avoid playing sometimes just so I don't have to deal with throwing away good gear. I wait until friends or randoms get on to unload stuff.n
---
I‚Äôll try this. Never even occurred to me this was possible.  Thanks for this
---
yup yup I got alot of painting done. Most of these are done with black ink and a touch of coffee.
---
C'mon over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals if you haven't been yet. Much better atmosphere over there.
---
how is that different to stash box? its a storage that only you can access..if they would do that wouldnt it be easier just to give us bigger stash box?
---
Well.. I had fun doing it, so anyone that enjoys it on top of that is just added bonus.
---
I tried playing at launch but the game was, in all sense of the word, unplayable. Now I'm trying to roam the wasteland and I noticed the building mechanics are still worse than in Fallout 4. After coming here I noticed some of the issues aren't explicitly stated as bugs so if they're already known, sorry. Please fix the issues where it says the item is floating, intersecting, a part or the main structure, etc when it clearly isn't. It's so annoying that it makes building literally impossible. If anything just remove it all together and let me have "floating" or "intersecting objects.
---
I really hope they can see this and at least use it if possible. 
---
Stash is available at every train station and Red Rocket station and anywhere a stashbox is available.  This would only be at your camp. Presumably the limit on stash is due to server stability. This would avoid that issue.
---
I'll give 4,000 Cap's to anyone with xo1 jet pack mod on Xbox one
---
No, please stay true to Fallout canon. 
---
It's already bad enough the Brotherhood was shoe-horned here, although I admit that was done well.
---
I just have grounded, speed demon, marsupial, and herbivore. I‚Äôm 24/7 PA so I run and fly through the air. Grounded is perfect because energy weapons are trash so extra DR is perfect. And I love herbivore because soups are the easiest food to source and fills my needs. 
---
Some people like carnivore but I find the other better
---
Lol it's already broken and it's more of a joke post. You know it's gonna happen tho. 
---
I am not defending them. I am just stating the facts as they are and I don't think it was in-game loot to begin with. Who knows if all three were meant to be a cosmetic bundle that was added into the game before releasing. What if it is the opposite of your speculation. One could simply consider the same otherwise. 
---
Atom shops and such are sort of a life line for online games. A way players could support the product beyond its revenues. In most cases, these revenues are used to improve the game itself. So paid shops aren't all that bad from a long-time perspective. Given the poor profits fo76 made on launch, I could see that they are highly depending on the atom shop to keep fo76 alive.
---
Most players see such shops in this sense anyway. Nevertheless, a costume can not be considered as an air conditioner to a car. You get loads and loads of costumes in game. So many that you would probably never even need to look at the atom shop, and we can not deny that. For the sake of this argument, we can't burn down the whole product on just this finding. Who knows and what happened first. You could even be right about your speculation, but still it wouldn't really mean anything. 
---
As a fellow player who doesn't like micro transactions, I could assure you that there is nothing shady here, it seems like fair play to me. At least in regards to the haloween costume.  
---
One more thing to take into account is the ease of obtaining atoms. They throw atoms at you for killing mice lol. So it isn't really on a high demand for real life currency, when you could rack up atoms easily. I guess that is what makes the atom shop less of a pay wall. It's easy to get atoms. Play the game and everyday, you are rewarded with atoms.
---
It's not the same milking tactics a game like warframe would do. More like destiny 2 eververse year 2. Loads of items, but ez to gain currency to buy such items on a weekly rotation. 
---
I'm just happy you and Ben were able to enjoy so many hours of good times and laughs 
---
Yes! This sounds great
---
This game sucks
---
Plus... I liked in FO4 having different containers for items so I group them however I want. Not like the current system where every box in your camp has all your items listed.
---
You think the AI in fallout 76 is bad? Try ESO. When we gave F76 a whirl we were thrilled by how smart the AI was in comparison.
---
Here's to hoping!
---
Actually linked that on the imgur post, here's the header on its own and paper background template https://imgur.com/a/Qxqz5gO  
---
But there are two perks, one to pacifi whatever and other only animals so :D 
---
Shia did based on your comment , it was a really good idea ...of course now others can blame you when they ask why he stopped at 76 :p 
---
If there was a Grognak or Unstoppables comic I'd consider a purchase. I'm in the US though. 
---
They're a good game brent
---
Had this same issue today. Had to go back 3 times to the same ghoul and finally a two shot flamer dropped lol talk about demoralizing.
---
Damn it must be terrible then because I really do think FO76 (and F4 since all the enemy AI comes from it) is terrible. 
---
I played ESO for a day or two but never got that into it. Maybe level 15 I think? Didn‚Äôt pay attention to the enemy AI. 
---
I have had this problem too but mostly going to home screen still üòí
---
Another one is in bus that is in front of gate to park where responder vendor is. Near ash heap.
---
Yeah I was wondering for example on the queen what the best mag was for dps? Maybe even an argument for the drum. But that aside the best two mags are perforating and stinging right ?
---
I tried and failed and wasted everything I‚Äôve saved and acquired for couple weeks. And couldn‚Äôt even get the scrap out of there. 
---
Can‚Äôt get past smashing all mainframe cores. About 3/4 and the bots take over. 
---
No fret.  Saw it today at vendor Greg in Grafton.  Would have grabbed it for you but I wasn‚Äôt sure what platform you were on.
---
https://imgur.com/a/n5HEg1t
---
well we had tons of fun playing the game and talking about the journals and seeing design sketches Shia was doing was a blast ..the real reward are the friends we made along the way ....like mister bitey or the invisible bees ...or the scorchbeast that had us pinned down in the farm house when we were very low level ...internet points are just icing on the cake 
---
There are people with 600+ hours. Guys who are in wheelchair and game whole day, someone made post he have over 800hours and is ending.
---
I don't understand people who have game from beta days and have under 100hours, like why you have gaming setup, when you don't play lol :D
---
I was trying to figure out the same. I think dmg wise perforating is better per shot but I think there‚Äôs a case to be made for stinging for fighting more than a few smaller enemies and for big ones like a yao Guai or queen
---
This.  Had 6 people starting out including myself, now it's down to me and one friend, those 4 people, they don't even own fo76 anymore, they have better things to spend their time on.
---
 I got my first one at level 30 to, on my first char that kinda went nowhere. ;)
---
Thank you again for your wonderfully entertaining read here mate, and for putting together the zip file :)
---
while they are being excruciatingly slow, keep in mind the one studio currently working on it is the Austin branch, one of the two smaller branches and one of the least experienced with the engine. While it's not an excuse for how slow, it's a good reason for being slow since they're likely having to learn about the engine's issues as they go.
---
I know it was ages ago, but back in New Vegas armor peircing ammo did considerably less damage to un-armored targets. I didn't use it much there, and I guess I've been in the same mindset here, because I've just been going for the biggest magazines. Time to kick that habbit. 
---
Nowadays gamers are so idiotic, game is in good phase, Yeah in beta times and at release it was tragicaly laggy, but now, man i had seen alot worse games.
---
There are 20-30ppl on huge dynamic world, I don't understand how server can handle flying objects when you throw granate in house. 
---
There are lots of mechanics that any other MMO didn't have. It is crazy what beth did and they have my respect. 
---
Here's [something](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+uninstall+a+program+in+windows+10) that will make sure they never let you down again.
---
ISO TSE Flare Gun
---
I started playing ESO in August of 2015. I‚Äôm pretty sure it was still in the turd phase at that point. Maybe a little better than launch?
---
There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre going to save F76 in time. The player base is dwindling way too fast.
---
Sorry.
---
..this ..is ..GENIUS :P I never thought about this as I've had pacifist on since level 5, but I know for a fact that you get xp from every mob that has taken even the slightest damage from yur stanky aura, so I think your plan could actually work :P
---
Are you guys on console by chance? I'm on PC, and have been getting very few disconnects (and back when I was getting a lot more disconnects a lot of them were bc of my internet).
---
I'm not saying I dson't believe, just looking to square the difference of our experiences.
---
I can make the rifle and mod it out for you free of charge if ya like or O have legendary versions for sale but not for caps lmk :) bout to hit the sack
---
It is painful to read whatever it was you were attempting to write. Premium currency for XP boosters? You must be looking for the Android gaming thread which is clearly not here. Your excuse is as lame as scented butane body spray. Unsubscribing to notifications is easy but I doubt  you even own the game seeing as how you think leveling is difficult and boosted through the cash shop. You should really think honestly about your scope of mind when you go to a game thread - for fans of a game to flame post barely illegible dishonest crap. Good grief man, everyday starts with you. Get right and choose life.
---
In beta times it was pain, but now, i can take workshop, Launch 3nukes, kill 3SBQ, and go loot that workshop without DC. How can you DC while doing single quest?
---
Maybe you all stop making up reasons for stuff and acting like they are confirmed facts?
---
Really? I can't even get that quest to trigger at all.
---
It is like sleeping bag, it is working better if you are naked in it.
---
What?  No, it was there from the start.
---
I just place a streetlamp on my roof as a beacon to let people know a safe space to rest and repair is available.
---
Cool but the cease and desist wouldn't be.
---
I have a legendary level 50 assassins Tesla I just need the mod or depending on the legendary version you have etc and what you want to trade for it.
---
I was guessing that mirelurks do too
---
So you have to buy some expensive plan every week, or you end up caps caped ?
---
You've been wanted for two months? /s
---
I've been anxious to see if it has worked for other players as well, this made me sad to see and I feel silly now. But I hope it works out in the end either way, if anything: I know your pain :P Thanks for reporting back with your results (Y)

Cool big word you used there but if you weren't playing on a crap 10¬¢ VHS TV combo your Uncle stole from Kmart and you're sister put her foot through while watching her Insanity work out videos- you might actually hear the sound and it's pretty damn good. The skins track has an the industrial ambiance and haunting Bohemian wind instruments from the earlier games.
---
Oh if ya just want the mod man if ya can supply a few mats I can make a ton of um for you to dismantle ao yoy get the mods or xan mod it for free for ya and check my post history theres a big list.
---
Another open letter about something people post a hundred times a day on this sub?  My eyes can't roll back any farther.
---
Then you must really despise [this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Goin%27_Under) song being in Fallout, right?
---
Your contribution to our stanky science inspires me (Y)
---
I don‚Äôt see it so I‚Äôll mention it. Rad Sponge seems to stop working when a team mate has left or sometimes it does not even start working. This makes the nuke zone not fun anymore 
---
You are seriously confusing the setting with limited game mechanics.  Did you notice all the destroyed buildings?  That's because they were nuked.  The nukes we drop can't sadly impact the world that much.  Personally I think they should have limited nuke strike locations to only a half dozen or so, and when nuked it actually changes the location to a post nuked area with buildings gone etc instead of just the irradiated zone of a pristine building.
---
Game is dying and the sub is dying, many have uninstalled in protest. 
---
Where is some good places to farm caps? If you don't mind my asking. I used to do events for caps but since the event cool down was added it's hard to make money that way.
---
Nice tidbit of information, I didn't even know Whitesprings had mirelurks :P Thanks for sharing! Hope you'll be graced by the gods of woopsie :)
---
I have a bloodied death claw gauntlet, with my perks right 1200 dmg, if I'm downed and revived or kill in chains can go up 1800 or more., 40 percent more power attack damage so with a sneak power attack its insane.
---
Yeah, it's hard to do BUT "World of Warcraft" has some neat things in the Frozen Throne expansion where after you complete a certain stage of the main quest of the expansion cities actually change permanently for you.  That'd be a tough mechanic to make work in this game, but would have been cool to see.  Or maybe it was a later expansion.  I was blown away by how the locations actually changed after I completely the main story.
---
I mentioned it in your other thread. Rad Sponge seems to stop working when a team mate has left or sometimes it does not even start working. This makes the nuke zone not fun anymore. Been happening since last update 
---
I would actually be more OK with the RNG of the legendary drops (I'm not Ok with drills, flares, and no drops at all) if it weren't so hard to actually find a 3 star legendary enemy. I run the Watoga circuit, Robco, General's steakhouse, Harper's Ferry, and Whitesprings, and It's very rare for me to find even one 3 star legendary enemy. There needs to be a better way to grind because right now the drops aren't great and the grind is just bad.
---
you won't believe this but I literally just got the plan for the Tesla lmao.
---
What happens there is the perk card stops sharing, you have to go into the perk manager and share that perk again.  
---
Super annoying, but I totally forgot to include it, good catch, will add and submit it in the morning.
---
Forgot about martial artist affecting some heavy weapon rates of fire.
---
its not though....
---
or are you one of those that think people in the military would not try any and all means of communication in the event of a nuclear war and/or governmental collapse? or that (illegal) government experiments would only occur in one area?
---
Do the wooden fences count as defense walls?
---
Favorite-ing items should already do that in my opinion
---
You could just not be a drama queen, take a long break, and maybe come back in a few months.
---
I think you can get addicted, but there is absolutely no feedback in the UI except the little pip-boy guy looking weird and hanging his tongue out. If in that state you take adictihol it will then put him back to his normal happy walking self.  
---
I do not know if it actually buffs/debuffs any stats, I‚Äôve never seen anything pop up.  
---
I shouldn't have to consider things like that, I was sold a $60 AAA game under Bethesdas name. They should be offering refunds if the Austin team isn't competent enough to deliver on the game people were sold and Bethesda won't step in and help them. I imagine there will be a class action lawsuit started eventually when we never actually get a fixed game or real dlc and the servers are shut down, if they dont offer refunds first. I find it really hard to believe there are many people buying the game anymore and even fewer buying atoms.
---
This has always been there and, IMHO, weak stories like this indicate that they knew they were messing with the lore and they forced it in anyway because that was the quick and easy thing to do. I'm surprised there's not a loading screen entry about the BOS too.
---
I actually really enjoy this game, but it's in spite of the total lack of respect for the lore.
---
Hey if you get the "Pharma Farma"-perk in luck, I can promise you that it will rain down foe you with antibiorics and disease cures :) Even 1/3 of procs quite often, I daily go to the church in Flatwoods to "search"/press space on the two med-kits and that one doctor's bag there, also if you are high enough level: Fort Defiance is flooded with mirrors (you get cures from these too!) and med-kits, plus tenfolds of aluminum as a bonus from all the surgical trays lying around. 10/10 can recommend Pharma Farma :P
---
&gt; But why come back?
---
I don't care what you do.  I am still interested in the game and play it, and don't mind taking a couple months break for other games to come back.  It's not like the game is going to go stale or something.
---
And the Enclave tour quest.
---
This game needs more checkpoints, for basically every quest stage.
---
Haha thats aweosme! Congratz now go and become a god of lighting that would make even zeus jelous!
---
Just did my first (and last) one. First the robot led me right to a scorchbeast. Then to the Whitespring, right after it had been nuked -- had to quickly throw on power armor/rad-x/radaway, while he conked out from radiation every 10 seconds, about a dozen times. Then he finally leads me right to a pack of about 20 level 50 legendary glowing ones. I finally ran away and let them have the damn robot -- mission failed, and the little turd deserved what he got too. 
---
I got the backpack version doing a random daily in the mire. 
---
You are a brave soul, neighboring that nasty mirelurk queen, I commend you :P Also: best of luck!
---
more stuff to slow down the servers even more alright!
---
The BoS aren't that bad.  They're isolationist because they've seen the damage people can do with technology, so they don't trust anyone not themselves.  Once you show your worth to them in F1 and F2 you can get some damn good stuff from them and they're a lot nicer to you.  In F3 they're damn well good people, I loved the Lyon's Pride and how they helped Project Purity provide water for the Capital Wasteland, wiped out the Enclave and started patrols to help keep the area safe.  Damn fine people, was happy to help them anytime.  FNV they're pretty good people just really clashed with the NCR as they were expansive arrogant jerks.  They're licking their wounds so not really being jerks to anyone too.  
---
F4, fuck that writing and turning the Maxson kid from F3 into a psychopath.
---
500 hours and just level 51. What are you doing when playing? Training for the Fallout marathon? 
---
I intend to that rifle is amazing and I have Commando maxed out I really want to see what it can do with full auto.
---
Me: Press F to Pay Respects
---
Also Me: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF...FFFFFF
---
But anyway, Rest in Peace Ben. I hope and pray that your buddy is up there watching and waiting for ya. It's hard to lose a close friend. It's harder to lose someone that was pretty much a brother. Just remember the good times you had with 'em, and keep livin' life for them. My respects, man, you have 'em.
---
There is magazine that increase tomahawks damage by 30% 
---
Can you do 800?
---
You are correct, "something" will happen, and you'll see some stat debuts occur, but nothing in the UI.  
---
From what I've been able to reproduce, is its more easy to get addicted to alcohol than chems, and so far all the addictions I have been able to cause, almost 9 to 1, was alcohol addiction.  
---
That said, it's not registering in the UI, and my "junkies" test weapon showed no change in damage, so I think the root of the issue is with the "addiction manager"
---
It reduces your luck by 2 :P Which is terrible! But mostly I was just happy because it was the last disease in the game I hadn't contracted (..for the atoms!).
---
Because many of us like the game more than those other games?  And we also buy and play multiple games?  I don't know why you think this is some big question that needs answering.  It's a big market.
---
Full Auto is my jam on that gun ! 
---
I stoped playing. At this Time for me it is like "seen this, done that". I will play again when they release new content (vaults!). I am not interested in PvP. I have other games for that.  
---
pretty much if it's not at least a 2 star it's not gonna be worth much
---
Damn Chicken Littles all up in here.  The sky is not falling, the game can pick back up, it's not like the player base is paying a sub and can't come back in a few months.  You all are so far up your own asses and can't even imagine being wrong about your circle-jerk.
---
That's not a bug, but intended as I understand it.  
---
Weapons with physical (like "cranking a wheel" interactions have their animations sped up by the same degree as melee.  
---
I could be wrong, but it seemed intended,
---
Miniguns are awful weak and heavy. You can carry significantly more clothing items (golf shirts) and still come out far ahead in caps.
---
I've noticed if I have other guns in my inventory with less than a full mag,it somehow limits my handmade mag.If I reload those guns to full,I can reload my handmade to 20 rounds.Another Beth made but imo.
---
Camden Park vendor always has a ton!
---
While I agree the cranking makes sense, I know it at least affects the Gatling laser too, so I'm pretty sure it's a bug.
---
Not this one. My rule of thumb is  only keep it if you would use it. Bloodied on a good gun, instigating on a good gun ect.
---
This game is what i wanted so long. Absolutly open world online TES/FO. Yeah it is buggy, but man, there are 20-30ppl that affect huge dynamic world. Of course it wont be stable.
---
People say there is no PvP, there is and in vault 76 there is note on oveseers computer, that there were 6? people in lockdown, so raiders are fukn canon! There is PvP, you just must find your way to it and don't be noob.
---
Also there is tones of things to do. My GF don't play becouse she get level 71, i gave her decent gear and she thinks, there is nothing to do. Casuals...... 
---
Should break with her (haha joking, after they introduce survival servers i hope she will join me again)
---
\*This\* is exactly what I was looking for validation of.... after hearing a Chinese coworker say "Fujiniya" and I literally thought he said "Virginia". He called me racist :(
---
Have a good time now!
---
Really?  
---
Only thought it effected the Gatling gun.  
---
All mods on the Gatling laser or a specific one?
---
I kinda dreamed up in my head that there was an epic battle between a scout ship and the space station that sent it hurtling to the toxic valley. I'd have recorded a few holotapes from someone on board to their loved one back on earth about how they saw purple flashes of light before being attacked. I'd have made it kinda emotional as they lost control and knew they were all going to crash and die and this was their goodbye.  Added in some mumbo jumbo about signals and such the station picked up which would tie into the trailer with the UFO nut. 
---
I would have had his trailer have a note with coordinates and ramblings that took you to the alien blaster, and mentioned something about his proof that scientists knew about alien existence and were hiding it. Then maybe utilized a holo tape.. I picture a really frantic crazy voice actor talking about keys he found to the TNT dome and how he hid them where no one would find them and he knew he was being watched etc. Like stark raving crazy voice here. 
---
Then track down the keys, and then find the scientists stuff in the dome, which confirmed they knew of the Zetas existence, and that there were sightings of the flatwoods monster already happening before the crash. That Appalachia was being watched. 
---
Sorry, I've thought about this a bit too much. Lol
---
I didn‚Äôt mean to haggle. But I can do 1000. Final. 
---
In my experience once you nuke, grab the plants then 5 minutes later they regrow as mutated still but you can not harvest them a second time.
---
I‚Äôve never had a three star not drop something for me. RNGesus has favored me since my first raid in Destiny though. 
---
I can  do 1000. Gamer tag?
---
Both standard barrels and charging barrels
---
Hmm I will have to try Charlie I have done alpha a couple times and it was a bit of a let down with how easy it was. Spent more time waiting around for the stupid bots to take their stations than anything else. 
---
I do. Especially when I go into a low level area and a level 69 appear and bring every enemy to level 70.
---
The only real option you have is to server hop. Or pay caps and loose your build. Neither of those are what I'd call "peaceful" options. 
---
And while yeah, you're a fucking idiot if you build at whitesprings, that's not _the only place that can get nuked_. Assholes are nuking _low level areas_ now because they're bored of whitesprings. 
---
Thanks, I'll try to muck about with it tomorrow if I get time.
---
I've researched some, it seems you should get heat flashes from honey bees :) Rattle hands I'm not finding any info on right away, will edit my comment if I do later today :) Best of luck!
---
Vault Tec could be such a great Company if they aint testing unmoraly stuff...  
---
What if Fallout 76 is just about a huge Social Experiment about how much Bethesda could fuck with their Fanbase?
---
Commenting with a tl;dr primarily to bump this post. When not gaming (or occasionally even when gaming)  I'm a researcher. Providing the theory + actions + data + related opinions summary is awesome. 
---
\\\[-\_-\]\\/\[-\_-\]/
---
This would have been really cool! The game definitely needed another year in development to add more story and fix all of the bugs.
---
Heck
---
so much this 
---
New gad. Grind kills 
---
Harper's ferry. Grind kills.
---
Whitesprings. Grind kills. 
---
I actually just got them. It seems rattle hands may be from mylurks as I got it using op‚Äôs start for woopsies (unsuccessfully). Heat flashes is indeed from honey beasts. Just a note to anyone reading this the monsters have to have ‚Äúdiseased‚Äù in their name to contract. May be obvious but it wasn‚Äôt for me
---
I'd suggest submitting a ticket. I did her quest line no problem, and the lack of people complaining about it suggests it isn't a global problem.
---
Just Google it, its not few people who have this problem.... 
---
Haven't played in over a month, still waiting for a reason to come back...
---
i see
---
Please do something about the stupid PvP Griefing-encouragement system. I'm sick of having to server hop to get away from shit-bags determined to disrupt my play and being verbally abused, with sexist, misogynistic remarks by these boys.  It must be very discouraging for the new, low-level players as morons seem to hang out in Flatwoods to attack them because they are easy targets.  It's not fun. It's not competitive. It's trolling.   
---
There's one called SONZ G (a level 44) who does this. He makes disgusting, sexist remarks to female players. Please ban his account from XBox 1X. 
---
&gt;It's seen as one of the worst games of all time, because it is.
---
No.. no. On an objective level I can pretty much assure you that it is not. 
---
Wack. It works for me just fine. Is it just fallout your experiencing difficulty with, or have you tested other games to see if it‚Äôs a hardware issue? 
---
But there are those rabid fanatics who are so fond of a thing that they long to share it with others who may or may not have been into it otherwise. &amp; so, if you're ideally hoping for someone else to experience some of the delight you did on an initial experience, you really want it to be smooth.   
---
For example, a person who isn't already super fond of a game might not want to keep playing if they get disconnected from servers fairly regularly. ;(
---
Heh, op here! :) I'm sad to see you've been unsuccessful in the hunt for the elusive woopsies though, I feel like it might just be a really low percentage to get it or something, which is why I was super-careful not to confirm anything fully and just over-did it while explaining every detail around when I got it, because it felt so unreal :P But yeah diseased-mobs are the way to go indeed, I think in Fallout 4 you can also contract diseases from "rabid" mobs as well, not sure if that works in F76 though :P
---
I can link you to a largely ignored thread that I have been updating every so often that has a list of every existing stash I have personally found since the last patch/hotfix. All I know is in that list, but it is absolutely guaranteed that all those stashes exist and spawn. Might take you some server hopping, but they WILL appear. My list is 8 replies down in the comments:  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am0chn/known\_caps\_stashes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am0chn/known_caps_stashes/)  
---
Trying to learn every plan and recipe possible. I'm a completionist, and I enjoy the challenge. :)
---
I'd just vendor it and move on. Miniguns aren't exactly sought after as is, and the legendary effect isn't one people tend to look for either. For 1* weapons unless it's Bloodied, Two Shot, Explosive or Anti Armor it isn't going to net anything. And even than finding a buyer isn't an easy thing to do. Only 2-3* weapons get you a profit.
---
Why did you even come into the thread If you don‚Äôt like what we are talking about?
---
You don‚Äôt care but you just HAD to leave a comment telling me that?
---
Oh, I saw that post and commented on it already lol... just gotta find some place that will shut up and take my money to put it on some damn stationary
---
This game is impressively bad. 
---
(mobile reddit is dumb and I didn‚Äôt thread this reply properly the first time, dangit)
---
Guess you didn't see the speech Todd Howard gave at E3 hyping up FO76.
---
Your own Gamma gun and rad shower maybe
---
There are workarounds around that. For example only scale monsterd to high level if there are no low level players around and instantly replace them when low level players enter the zone.
---
There is perk, that makes you do radiation damage the more you are radiated.
---
yea are you holding "select" while you back the camera out?
---
I usually use Emmett Mountain Disposal Site.  Inside the hanger is a lot of irradiated barrels and a decontamination shower.  Just rense and repeat.  
---
Also make sure to have starched genes to keep the ones you want if you have some already.  Just put starched genes on when in the shower, then take it off to get a mutation.  You can only aquire one mutation per server.  So you'll need to hop to get another one.
---
Okay. I just did and everything that turned up is from mid-late November. Again, I really suggest a ticket... It's not a persistent problem for most players, and searching this particular sub yields nothing of substance either. Not saying it's not a thing, and you've got every right to be pissed about it... But it's not something that effects the majority of players. 
---
They should improve flatwoods into a player hub. Its already in the greenzone so it cant be nuked. Making a player market/hub would be a few easy steps
---
Wtf
---
FYI, you can place plants indoors using the famous rug glitch.  Been around since Fallout 4.  But, I like your idea too.
---
In a persistent world, how do you handle harassment?   
---
b00bs420 is stalking me everywhere I go, destroying every camp I build -- but also, enlisting other people to aid in this process, etc. Each time I respawn, I am obliterated again. Currently I think I can hop servers to have some influence over deterring that situation. (Theoretical. I am sure the true owner of b00bs420 is a very kind person. I mostly play solo and the majority of my few experiences interacting with other players have been positive.) 
---
I love this idea. There's a ton of un-used space up on the 2nd floor of the whitespring. The player vendor bots could go up there.
---
Camp vending machines are a bad idea because camps are hard to find. And the whole griefing thing. I think that if you have a vending machine at your camp then it should be a fast travel icon for everyone on the map. And your camp should be indestructible. 
---
Especially considering what they had before, the new guys wouldn't exactly have a high bar to beat. Look at the amount of issues we had with patches breaking stuff due to typos, mass removing flags, or unfinished copy pasting
---
Sweet thank you
---
you claimed the lore was already broken. I assumed you were making the same complaint of super mutants and brotherhood of steel. the lore isnt broken.
---
I have the exact same issue on a Xbox here. I had a friends list on the B.E.T.A., but after launch it completely disappeared. For some reason team invites open to the friends list so I can‚Äôt accept them due to the bug. If I can find their name on the map before the invite times out to click their dot and accept the invite then it‚Äôs all good. 
---
They planned a patch towards the end of Feb, it could be the 19 or 26. My guess the 26. Hopefully they'll let us know on the next Inside The Vault.
---
Not really though.
---
Ore nodes don't deplete, so you can keep your character swinging at it while you do something else. Also, another player can't "steal" your ore by being better at mining and trying at the same spot.
---
Stuff like that, there's a detailed list on the website somewhere of all the changes. 
---
I'm beyond caring anymore, ohh what could of been....
---
West Tek. It's got a decon arc with toxic goo all over the ground. When you're at the decon arc just collect a few Toxic Goo and drink them. If you don't want the mutation just activate the arc, clear the rads, cure the mutation and relog. Wash, rinse, repeat..  Literally.
---
I really hope it's not taking that long just for the SB thing there better be a long list of more fixes , but then if there was they wouldnt have gave that half assed Inside The Vault  so i'm not sure what's up
---
Mirelurks die way way faster if you shoot them in the face, or somewhere not covered by it's shell.
---
What is the point of having 2 and 3 star enemies if they dont drop the corresponding level weapons? I've never understood that. 
---
Just make them rarer so when you do find a 3 star enemy you know you'll get something with 3 effects. It can still be a garbage roll but at least the reward matches the effort. 
---
I know, but sometimes they do that rush attack with their shell 
---
K
---
I've got an instigating(+40% power move DMG) Mole Miner Gauntlet and that thing instakills ghouls at whitespring without any perk. Those gauntlets are insane!
---
No?
---
My husband turned me into a pretty hardcore gamer, but it backfired a bit. My tastes are 70% different from his.
---
I agree. 3 stars are so rare that I was psyched to encounter so many. That excitement turned to bitter disappointment once I got to see the loot. 
---
I'm the Fallout fan. 76 was my shot with him, but we both gave up on it. We still have ESO though. Aside from that, I play shooters and he plays LEGO games.
---
Really good post.  I do think the Handmade is overrated. I like the aesthetics and the feel of the gun but perkwise Pipe Bolt action does ridiculous damage and is extremely durable especially work perks. I also think it's penetration is greater due to the .308 vs the 5.56 but if anyone has any data on bullets that would clear things up more. I've noticed certain guns with similar damages do vastly different with no perks.  Don't forget that the bolt action pipe rifle gets damage bonus from pistol and rifle cards. It also uses both cards status damage ( pistol &amp; rifle) if you spend the extra 3 points each. The weapon is a little cannon for being so cheap to make and maintain. Test out what I'm saying for yourself, same applies for the pipe revolver which uses 45.. is like a keyed up 45 with app those perks. The sound becomes very satisfying followed by the gore. Both weapons have no armor pen clips or mags yet they pop robot parts in one shot no sneak or vats, just 3 base rifleman tree and pistol tree combined.
---
I got it by scrapping a combat armor chest piece. My guess is that it can be learned by scrapping any combat armor piece you find. Friend got it by scrapping a leg.
---
I‚Äôm not a moder and don‚Äôt know much about Bethesda‚Äôs fossil game engine.
---
However it seems so trivial to me that a 50(or smaller if you want to make the already duped items/accounts less useful) count limit on the exact same weapons and armours should stop duping while have almost no significant impact on normal game play. 
---
The term exact means the same mod, legendary effects and maybe CND at any instance.
---
It is highly unlikely that someone will come across more than 50 the exact same item during normal gameplay. And if someone want to craft weapons or armours to be disassembled in pursuit of new mod, they still can.
---
All of the duping methods on YouTube(that I‚Äôm aware of) involve having ridiculous among of the same item to crash the server in order to trigger the roll back.
---
It is hard to believe that all the experience developers from Bethesda can‚Äôt figure this out. 
---
So it must be an engine limitation that prevents them from doing so and therefore it might take a really long time to hopefully eliminate duping.
---
If you were running around White springs, you should go back and read all the inside the vaults and patch notes. Then face palm. They had to Nerf all legendaries because the turbo Farmers and " OMG please Nerf!" Kids can't get along in the same sandbox. I bet on the PvP server they raise the drop rate .
---
Have certain areas on the map become settled by human and robot npcs. Have plots inside these cities where players can build a safe house (indestructible) that‚Äôs taxed for protection and can double as a store.
---
Naaawh, you are looking for mercenary? That's not my way. I got hunry i go to workshop, as guy if he have food for me, if he don't want share, i eat him and thats all drill. Sometimes you take over workshop, kill guy with bounty, because he have ugly face, but man, who cares. Most lucky day, is when you find bottle of vodka, with rest of vodka in it.
---
Nah they just don't have good work life balances and probably eat crap food or come from bad homes.
---
Even if you find a 3-star legendary it will almost never drop 3-star loot. Don‚Äôt bother looking for them.
---
I did. I seem to recall I was pretty excited about it. Not because of his speech but because of the game alone. I'm not terribly disappointed, maybe because I'd anticipated it being a bit bumpy. I'm still enjoying the game though.
---
Yao guai, 6springs 6acid. When you find group of 6+ fortune man. (if they dont shred you in shit)
---
I‚Äôve been wondering this for awhile, how do you get the Brotherhood tag beside your name?
---
They would won‚Äôt to do it before the 22nd when Anthem drops....and they would won‚Äôt to make it good to keep the players.
---
....seriously? Like, seriously? They're worried about *spoilers*?
---
The house is burning down, we're packing up to flee, and they're still worried about us finding out what was cooking in the oven before the house caught on fire?
---
Wow. Just...wow. This development team really is hopelessly out of touch with completely clueless priorities.
---
Ok, these ways people have suggested are useful. But if you want to farm your character with specific mutations and not others. It will take time and radaways. You can do the thing with the decontamination shower to start to get like 4-5 mutations you want, but after that maybe use radaway to roll the dice and remove only 1 mutation rather than all, hopefully removing the 1 you don't want just after you gain it. If you get like 6-7 mutations you want and only need a couple more, don't be greedy. Mutation serums are pretty cheap from people nowadays, like only 200 caps each. If you gain a mutation you don't want after you've gained like 7-8 that you wanted. You might end up needing to start all over again
---
I still agree with Ben, I just think some of you guys need to take a break and stop playing an RPG like it's a competitive shooter. If you want that experience reinstall CoD. I am almost certain they most of you who compassion due to the sheer intellect, independent thought and group speak probably are forever or current Fortnite players. Fallout isn't a Marquee game. It's a survival exploration, lore game. Just chilling in the wasteland. There is no real end game you can do what you want forget at your own pace. It's always been that. The story was for the bubblegum player.
---
Bobbleheads have random spawn, so they can be on different spot, but if you picked one in last 24hours, there wont be anothere near.
---
If you need, one spot is on absolute top of poseidon powerplant, next to red chest and minigun.
---
Second spot is in raiders camp near trainstation that is next to top of the world. Bobblehead in this camp spawn on 3differend places so you have to run around there.
---
Two shot flamers are fun, but making fuel isn't. I don't care about DMG as much as I care about playing with different weapons. But I wanna use flamer so much after I got the two shot one, but the fuel crafting is inefficient compared to other ammo crafting.
---
Killed a legendary mirelurk queen solo at level 32 for Swarm of Suitors, got a weightless wood arm. Fuck the legendary loot tables so hard.
---
'Vaccinated' does not provide it's stated bonus against acquiring Rad Worms and Glowing Pustules. I think this may be because the transmission of these particular 'diseases' (probably defined in the Ghoul race entry) is via an ability rather than a spell (or vice versa) and the perk seems to work by nullifying one but not the other. Even with Vaccinated at max rank plus Well Fed and Well Hydrated I can practically guarantee getting those diseases if hit by their carriers.
---
Yeah, I'm starting to think so too. It's all rockstar people. Everyone I know who got that is playing other stuff now
---
" **and its impossible to play the game!** "
---
Yeah i was absolutly impossible for me to play those 430hours lol.
---
I agree.  They'd need to remove the enemies and add a stash box, plus player vendors and done.  I believe all the crafting tables are already there.   
---
I think you talk past each other.
---
&gt; once you complete all her tasks
---
He thinks there should be radiant quests after you complete her story line.
---
&gt;everything that turned up is from mid-late November
---
See, if you are looking g for her radiant quests, you'll find threads. It's just that she doesn't have any. If you want to align with the raiders, well just do raider stuff (loot, destroy camps and kill players)
---
I hope this clears things up a little. There is no need for a ticket, because there is no bug.
---
Woaw someone who wasn't affected by a game breaking bug can play the game!
---
You are a genius man!
---
any place reliable to farm them? I REALLY find myself always in need of a lot of ACID.
---
Ever since the resource collectors started giving ore instead of raw junk that workshop up north with the 3 acid collectors has become priority number 1 for me.
---
I don't really care about the bobble head so must as I wasted my time lol
---
The ETA I got from the support ticket was like...6 months for replacement bag
---
That's actually often why people are mad at anything.
---
Some times they can spawn on the table next to the computer but its only one part at a time and i think its a rare drop but i have gotten an extra blueprint from there before
---
Oh boy.   
---
EVERY game looks good before release, how about don't trust the VIDEOS they show us and let's wait till the GAME comes out and WE could play them ourself? Rage 1 looked good in the Previews, that the game had several high impact issues is forgotten?   
---
No, let's just pre-order everything and cry when it derps.
---
We don't really care that you don't really care.
---
every server I get on that one NEVER seems to be claimed.
---
I'm sorry that people haven't been that friendly to you, when I started out people gave me free stuff all the time so it hurts me to hear that experience isn't universal. Though I think one of two things is going on in your situation: Due to the change to leveling people are now having to hold onto more of their stuff or you're unlucky and haven't been in servers with kind people.
---
Yeah it rarely is, I‚Äôm just ocd about unused ore and my stash space üòÇ
---
I think you're 100% right now that you've pointed that out.. Thank you! 
---
Sorry OP, I thought you were glitched out on her quest chain!
---
I would say scorchbeast queen fights, sometimes there is lots of them.
---
Also Enclave even where you setup antenes  and there it goes boom (event: enclave real blast?) can have yao guais as enemies. Once i got over 10 of them there.  
---
In casual gaming setup i never met more than 3at same place.
---
This would be *vastly* simple to do omg.
---
Make the 76 vault door we all stare at an entrance to a literally copy and pasted vault 76.
---
Are you on mobile? If so click the thread home page, too right you‚Äôll see be three little ‚Äòsettings dots‚Äô click this, should be an option to ‚Äòchange user flair‚Äô
---
There‚Äôs a similar way to do on pc too, check google for this ‚Äòchange user flair‚Äô. Did the same myself the other day! I find the platform flair the most helpful, cuts out all this ‚Äò which platform you on?‚Äô Chat.
---
Yeah but they also said bugs would be fixed with the last patch soooo...
---
Impossible to play? Then how did I complete that part of the quest line? Huh weird 
---
Level 38 here, killed the level 50 blocking Taggerdy today like it was a big flappy deathclaw.  Poor guy didn't even know I was there.  Sadly, my quest is glitched out so I'll be back when I get the motivation to try again.
---
Ya. I hope they fill that data analyst position, per the description, sounds like they would be looking for typos etc. (Looking at you modern renegade and your missing zeroes.)
---
Are you normally this bright?
---
It doesn't happen to everyone....
---
You guys are so awesome.
---
Thanks for reminding me that you were able to play the game! REALLY FIXING MY ISSUE. 
---
As I now see you already beat her story line and believe she should give out extra quests, she doesn't as someone else stated in this post it isn't a bug 
---
You just can't comprehend that 
---
"Good information, u/Aten_Ra!  We'll make sure to pass it along to the team! :)"
---
\~*Support team that will do nothing with this information*
---
&gt; she doesn't give you a new task once you complete all of her tasks
---
Stop thinking that you are the bright one, when you write stuff like this.
---
I cant even finish her quest so what he said really doesn't change anything.
---
After eating a ghoul, fixing the relay, and some other stuff, the next thing shown is gaining her trust, but nothing is pointed out nor marked on map but rose and she doesn't interact with you.
---
Even though marker is on her!!! 
---
You can test in-game, or you can look inside the .esm to see the actual adjustment values, I guess ...
---
You can also do it with campfires as well. Makes mutfruit trees real pretty.
---
Are you so daft? I said the quest is stuck on'' finish her tasks to gain her trust''  but nothing new comes up.
---
Learn to read first then talk. Jesus you are miserable

*"Alright, alright, listen close. There was a cold day by a golf course that I was swarmed by a horde of Ghouls and a Wendigo. Wave upon wave crashed upon me, and eventually, bodies strewn about, I was able to claim my prize."*

---
*"Was this board here. If you're really strung out, it hits a LOT harder."*
---
*"Son of a bitch. That explains a lot, Paps."*
---
I don't understand what their end goal is either. It's not like we can buy weapon drops with microtransactions, but they seem to be designing the game is if that was the case!
---
Why not make the game fun to save the reputation of the brand and company (as much as possible). Look at ESO, The Division, NMS, or Sea of Thieves. Those games also sucked at release, but they worked with the community to make them fun through patches. Bethesda seems to be doing the opposite. WHY?!
---
Although I've never crunched the numbers, the number of feminine outfits in the game feels lower to me than the number of masculine outfits. So adding more options for female characters is definitely in my areas of interest in the shop. :P
---
What does the mission description on your pip boy say? Sometimes the questmarkers are bugged, but you can still complete the mission, if you know where to go.
---
Find another player to buy them from. They go for like 200 to 300 caps a serum.
---
1st up. Sorry for the toxic community of people who think bashing someone with a legitimate problem with a buggy game will do anything but drive more people away. These hypocrits will be the downfall of the game.
---
And 2. Have you advanced through the responders questline? And Did you do the quests yet where you need to find all the codes/pieces (can't remember) from each of the raider leader camps.
---
No problem! If you didn't know, you often have to look at a cap stash, then go away about ten yards and look at it again before the "search" option will work properly. Cap Collector is wonky like that right now.
---
Bethesda should publish this and send copies to everyone that got shafted by the pre order shenanigans.
---
Have to say that I didn't think much of metro but Xbox store marked then down so I got them. Finally got around to playing then a few holy shit those games are amazing. I can't wait to see how exodus turns out. I have high hopes. It seems that many american developers are in a race to nickel and dime players to death. Hopefully these smaller foreign developers can supply old-school straight forward games.
---
I hate to say it but its gotta be intentional on there part, at the very least the loot rolls. I mean seriously, I've found about 75% of all wood and basic raider pieces of armor from legendary drops. Literally Have received two actual guns, and i mean any gun, as a legendary drop for probably the 50+ legendaries Ive gotten loot from. There's no way everyone has this bad of luck, its intentional on there part that the legendary drops are garbage. They intentionally make the crappy stuff have insanely high legendary drop rates. 
---
You can get mutations from a serum?
---
I really hate these vague bug claims.
---
where in the quest are you? what is the last thing she had you do how far did you get be for said glitch? are you trying to hand over an item or get a new quest? have you tried looking at your data tab to see if it has become unselected somehow? you don't really have to go back to here very often during the quest from what I remember.
---
It's because most of the enemies swarm you making guns basically useless. The only enemies I really need guns for are super mutants. 
---
I did not know that, thanks for the info
---
Thanks for kind words.
---
I cant progress to the retrieve the uplink part sadly.
---
 I have to talk to rose then she should give me the location of raiders cache but that happens after finishing 3 quests of '' signal strength '', flavor of mayhem'',''key to the past''.
---
I did all 3 but once i go back to rose she doesn't care! And doesn't say anything and still expects me to finish them! But i did. And i. Can't go any further... 
---
What level are you?
---
Even if they had the money to bring in other studio, they better off spending them on developing a new engine.
---
Update: still nothing after I re-installed the game. Shame,I was having a nice time walking around and exploring. 
---
what system are you on?
---
Man that hits way too close to home. My brother died four months ago, and I grew up from age 7 on always playing coop and splitscreen with him, all the way from Halo 1 to Halo 4. I booted up Halo Online the other day and it just felt empty. It sucks man. I hope you're alright these days.
---
PS4 
---
Its not vauge if you read and know whats up.
---
I said im stuck on the part '' gain her trust''
---
Which means i already did flavor of mayhem, signal strength, key to the past, after these 3 you supposed to go and talk to her and gain her trust, then she tells you to go to a raider camp to get the uplink!
---
BUT SHE DOESN'T TALK TO ME,  even though marker is on her, so i can't complete her trust part which is a simple interaction. Therefore i cant proceed. 
---
sorry. i am on pc. 
---
My Xbox crashes and powers off every time I fast travel to Harpers  Ferry, maybe about 11 times now trying different things to get it to not crash. In PA with calibrated shocks. Haven't been able to get my weight down to try without PA yet. I did log a ticket a week or two ago with Bethesda, but am not expecting a response, just wanted to let them know since I hadn't seen anyone else talking about it at the time.
---
I just completed the campaign at level 95, but I really took my time and didn‚Äôt really focus on it for a while. Level 30 is probably where you‚Äôll get comfortable with solo, and by then you will probably have a pretty nice perk build in the works. 
---
The scorchbeast can be a pain in the butt no matter what level you are, simply because of the mechanics of the enemy (in the air a lot, lots of screeching making it hard to see anything). When/if a scorchbeast lands (they need a clear area and even then they might not), that‚Äôs the easiest time to really let your fury loose upon them. 
---
How would I find said people that can craft the serums?
---
Thanks for responding though.
---
Game always crashes in no time when I claim that place. I finally found what is pretty much the only acid node without a Scorchbeast nearby and stuck my camp there. It helps that Grafton monsters and Snallygasters also spawn nearby. I got plenty now, and for once, no ores to smelt üòÖ
---
Go play RDR2 instead 
---
You‚Äôre def doing something wrong. I‚Äôm 2 handed melee and don‚Äôt even use the 3 different 2 handed cards maxed out and I do 300 dmg before nerd rage and unyielding kick in. 
---
Bit late to the party but bug with the Syringer. Once you fire it, there is a 4 second delay before you can use it again. This 4 second delay times exactly with how long the fire and reload animation takes on the Syringer.
---
Steps to reproduce are simple, fire Syringer and then hotswap to another weapon. You will be unable to attack until the four seconds are up.
---
[WEAP:0014D09E]
---
Gain her trust.....
---
Which is a simple interaction with rose but she is glitched and doesn't talk.... 
---
I will be on about 4 AM EST. Look me up. RB1955. No charges. Small trade will do.
---
Grafton monsters and Snallygasters have a lot, too. In the big dried lake bed by Hemlock Holes you can find at least a couple, sometimes 2 of each if you're lucky. There's also an acid node there you can put your camp on. What platform are you on?
---
Just wanted to add, I though maybe I was losing my mind. Maybe accidentally dropping things, perhaps not being careful when selling things etc. Basically trying to justify this issue. However I  literally just experienced it. 
---
So I figured I needed to go to Whitesprings and figured I‚Äôd sell while I was there. But I didn‚Äôt have enough to sell. So I spent like 30 minutes picking blackberries. I had exactly 163 blackberries in my inventory. I went to the enclave and sold some weapons and figured I‚Äôd sell the blackberries using grape mentats to the whitesprings vendor. I had to Piss, so I logged out and then relogged in 10 minutes later. Upon reloading, I now had lost every blackberry but one. Bullshit. 
---
ah. i read but couldnt get a grasp on exactly how far along you were. it seemed like you were just naming bits you did.
---
being glitch out there is odd, most people got stuck on handing here the holotapes to get in the broken uplink.
---
believe it or not i have seen people claim mashing the interact button while she is in different parts of her pathing might help. you said you already tried mashing the button but I am assuming it was in one spot. I don't see how myself, but that is the best I got.
---
What other missions are active may I ask. Maybe something is connected
---
It can help if you want to move/place something without physically moving your character around, so it‚Äôs nice for putting things high up, or in tight spaces, or just for a little more precision, but your mileage may vary
---
My son loves watching me roam the wastelands of Appalachia; however, any love I've held for the game has long since bled out. Feels bad I dislike the game enough not to want to game with my kid.
---
Bethesda screwed the pooch on this title. I hope they fix it, but until some qol rolls out I'm finished with it.
---
No main quesst is left, only this one and events. 
---
It‚Äôs not out of control. Bloodied is a glass cannon. High risk high reward. It‚Äôs nothing like a tse carrier at full health before the nerf. Stop acting like melee builds like this are easy and broken. Takes balls to run around at 10% health in this game and is not even close to any ranged build which is why no ranged builds even do decent damage. 
---
The OP is a toxic as this community, so it fits.
---
what really?! are you sure its not a mod?
---
That sucks! I had a crash on my very first run of a silo yesterday, but thankfully I wasn‚Äôt too far in. Good luck on your next run!
---
Try having him give the suit to you. Then do miner miracles again. That may give him the prints. You may have glitched the quest by not making the armor yourself.
---

Boom

Great post , thank you!
---
Now to sit and wait for the nerf to Tank Killer....
---
So i wanted to ask this question thats not really related to what your talking. How do i get good weapons. Im doing quests and just discovering places, i have no idea how to get caps or guns in this game. Legendary enemies dont always drop good weapons. Stuff sells for like 3 caps. Quests help. But my god they are dragged out so time for the caps dont feel worth it.
---
You can move camp there and build stairs to the bobblehead.
---
When he pressed the scan button it finished his quest as in it's listed under his completed quest section :(
---
Because they rely on the modding community to fix and balance their games. Then they repackage it and sell it to you as dlc. 
---
He means what quests do you have available to you in your data tab on your pipboy.  Bugs can be caused by many things so being as specific as possible towards any questions asked of you will help you out in the long run most likely.
---
This game is dead. 
---
Are you on PS4? I always travel to the queen when someone nukes prime. The last time I went there were like 4 of us and so many ground adds I couldn‚Äôt even focus on the queen so I just left. 
---
His comments say 69, but he‚Äôs a melee build. I can‚Äôt imagine dealing with turrets using melee

Are the silos all different inside?

I'm not sure if grinding should be in 60$ game. It's not TESO and neither F76 is MMO. Multiplayer, but not that massive to make this much grind.
---
Good bot.
---
Well said, this sums it up completely.
---
I looked up the other posts of other people (as you obviously have). The corresponding thing I noticed with people who have said it worked again after have said about following steps that they were last on/doing/or next step, specifically if there was a quest part you were doing and the server dropped it may have bugged your quest log to think you've completed a quest part without actually having done it or gotten a specific item.
---
If it's really important to you to fix it, you could try doing what was needed by the quest log before you had the problem (look on the internet for a walkthrough of the quest to know where/what do to do again).
---
I'm sorry if that sounds like a lengthy possible way without any real clarification if it would work or not, but it's the only thing I can think would work/have a connection to the problem. I see quests bug out for people all the time where the quest disappears, quest markers on the map, but they can still go to the location and pick up/see the relevant things to do with the quest
---
I thought you couldn‚Äôt nuke anywhere in the Forest area? 
---
'Soon' was in November, this turned into 'very soon' on Jan 1. And now halfway through February it's being 'finalized'. Wish my boss allowed deadlines like that. 4+ months to make a roadmap...
---
It's like we used to say when disciplinaries were handed out left, right, center and off center at my old work place. "We're not angry, we just want you to explain"

A decade ago we wouldn't of even needed to worry about being banned for such things.
---
Ok seams like I misunderstood you, but then the only thing you can do is submit a ticket. This really isn't a common problem (anymore).
---
Dude treating people like crap publicly is going to make *everyone* not want to help you.  Not their problem or fault, just because you're behind a screen doesn't mean you can treat them like crap.  Respond with some tact and respect and watch as the helpful people try to help.
---
As you are now you sound like a spoiled angry child and I highly doubt you are, I think you're just extremely angry and irrationally lashing out, *just take some time* and try for a solution when you're not fuming.
---
I've had luck avoiding this black screen bug by never fast traveling with power armor on to Harper's Ferry.
---
You can nuke parts of the Forest, Morgantown for example. You can't nuke a big area around the Vault. 
---
Damn. This is one comprehensive list.
---
Your are doing God's work.
---
How do you want people to speak nicely to other when they are the one who started assaulting them on no reason.

Imagine you being here asking the same question and i come out of nowhere and troll you and say bad things about you. I would not expect you to keep your cool as well. 
---
I thought I was the only one doing this type of thing. Nice job!

Storefronts and camp vending machines are a terrible idea. Put a terminal somewhere on the map and have it be a trading auction house. Look up how world of war craft handles trading and selling. Don‚Äôt make me look at a ton of shops or stores or vending machines. That‚Äôs super inefficient. 1 terminal, log in, view items available from every single player but don‚Äôt even tell me who is selling it. Just item, price, done.

If you want to talk demoralizing, I was in a nuked whitesprings this morning and found a bag with 1200 pounds of assorted junk. I waited 10 minutes for anyone to come for it and no one did, so its mine now. Im level 450, if I dropped 1200 pounds of junk, probably this guys literal entire collection, I'd never play again.
---
I had to make 2 alts to store it all, its literally all usable and in reasonable quantities.
---
Thanks for explaining. I‚Äôve only launched one nuke and it looked like the Forest was un-nukable. I totally forgot about Morgantown, haha
---
It is nigh impossible to zoom in or out in third person inside a camp or claimed workshop building zone.
---
However I notice I can't zoom in or out while moving *sometimes*, you'll know if you're clear to zoom in/out while holding down the touchpad because the compass icons will change for as long as the touchpad is held down.
---
The only way I can ever zoom about in building zones is by holding the touchpad down for like a second several times to avoid entering build mode.
---
I wonder what people will come up with and blame now? First they blamed the carryweight glitches...then the dupe glitches...but what are they speculating now?ü§îü§îü§î

Responder firefighter set is another, you can only get one piece a character and you get it as a reward for doing thirst things first, second helpings, and the first time you do back on the beat, project beanstalk, feed the people, and other responder events. With that being said you can have the full set on a character you'd just have to get a third party involved or buy it which is hard to do. Generally most people who have it don't know it's rare so 1-5k caps is usually enough to persuade them into selling however each piece can easily go for 15k and depending on buyers and other such can be worth over 25k caps. Personally got my full set for 7k caps (1k for helmet and 6k for uniform, though to be fair he was prepared to sell for 4k) 
---
It‚Äôs over guys. I don‚Äôt think anything is going to drastically change, and we need DRASTIC game overhaul changes. I gave it 3 months downtime hoping to come back to a smoother, more balanced game, only to find a whole new host of bugs which actually made it harder to play. there was a post here a while ago about most of the dev team having already moved on and I can‚Äôt help but feel that‚Äôs spot on. There‚Äôs just one guy in a dark room somewhere pulling his hair out trying to push balance patches with a little pip boy bobble head staring down at him until the wee hours of the morning. 
---
&gt;breaking it down
---
How ironic 
---
What level/platform are you?
---
You can check vendors for reasonable legendary weapons. You'll find some 1* legendaries players have sold there (I got an Anti-Armor hunting rifle I love). Try Artisans Corner (downstairs in the Whitespring hotel), Whitespring Station, and Watoga Station, since that's where a lot of people sell their mediocre loot after nukes and farming.
---
Okay I guess that's fair as far as opinions go, I myself didn't have a particularly bad experience with BF4 at launch, the netcode was kind of shit and it was considered a horrible launch at the time but IMO the quality of the product was miles ahead of launch Fo76 (even current actually) in technical performance despite that. 
---
As for the other games you pointed out they are Bethesda so to me it only further proves the point
---
I agree bugs can be funny but only if they are few and far between, don't fuck up the experience and have character i.e Roach spawning in bizarre places
---
Why does your vampire have so much damage? Is it two shot?

When it comes out on PC I'll be there.

I‚Äôd be fine if there was zero endgame if we had side quests like we did in previous fallouts. I haven‚Äôt found a new side quest in like a month and I‚Äôve been stopping at every location, every terminal, every note, etc.

"The weird thing about the Nuke generation table that I've noticed is that it doesn't seem to always check to see if you caused damage to the dead enemy, before running the check... if at all. I know I've gotten nuke materials off of corpses that were there before I was in the area to even hit the target. "  
---
I'm still relatively low level and have only even been to nuked zones a few times, but this seems consistent to me with every other area of the game. I've looted many enemies which were already long dead when I arrived at a location... and there are various ways in which this would make sense to me. (Exa: Attempting to join a teammate's server where the teammate deliberately left the loot for you.) 
---
I am absolutely ecstatic about your work here :) been wanting a brilliant mind like yourself to write up some damage tests like these... now if you could find the exact % increase furious brings and at what bullet it ramps to what% that would be great ^^ my tests indicate a 60% max cap increase at the 12th shot and a 10% increase starting at the 3 consecutive bullet hit but, you do your tests and we can compare ;p.
---
from my experience, you have around 90% chance of getting a armor piece. I would be Ok with it as long as a 3\* ennemy don't drop 1\* items. That make no sense for a looting game
---
But if it's unfair and you can stay connected to the same server consistently &amp; not regularly encounter frustrating bugs, is it worth the inequality? My frequent inability to complete tasks bothers me more than a person with more money having a more awesome camp or etc (and I say this as a person who loves crafting in-game).

Happen to me too, had to close all other quest to get that one to finish

That's par for course for any Bethesda game. Apologists and blind fanboys that probably have not picked up a game for the last decade, swearing somehow that Bethesda's games are "special" or "can't be done by anyone else". Defending them at any costs, as if Bethesda needs defending instead of getting critiqued on their tired-old design. They forget that with Skyrim and Fallout 4, people just barely put up with the flaws and the outdated combat, because the rest of the package was appealing. Several promiment websites called them out for using the same tired engine in FO4 and that it was the last time it was just barely acceptable.  
---
In the meantime, gaming has progressed light years ahead of anything Bethesda puts out. We have several iterations of Dark Souls, the amazing Bloodborne, our Horizon Zero Dawns, and even the new God of War puts everything else to shame. All Bethesda has managed is tack on a multiplayer mod onto Fallout 4. Gaming needs to move forwards and Bethesda either needs to revamp everything or die a stubborn death.
---
If grinding wasn't a thing in video games, you wouldn't get past 100 hours on them. Wonder why most people only play about 30 hours on their $60 dollar single player video game?
---
I had this happen too. I ran to whitesprings after a nuke and found lots of paper bags full of loot. I'm talking like I have 50 bulk steel, acid and lead stashed away rn. After an hour of sorting inventory I went to clear spawn points. They were all empty. As I was trying to figure out what was up, I checked my map only to notice that the only people on server were my team mates. Server crashed and it forgot to kick us?

Yeah too true. I've still not launched a nuke but I've done almost everything else. I just think new content couldnt come quick enough. There's only so many times I can and want to stop stumpy mole miners destroying uranium extractors or repair SAM turrets.
---
Where is it?
---
I've been having fun building inside existing structures and it seems like some could make it possible to utilize their basement/storage area. Hidden in plain sight can be more valuable in some situations. 
---
He spawns and isn't always in a real-time route. And he despawns when blocked.
---
I see Grahm very regularly (almost every play session) and most occassions, he just spawns around me.
---
If you kill them too quickly they don't drop anything, also happens if they run away from you (happens to my melee build often)
---
They will drop if you get them to agro and health regen.
---
Take your grind to a better game.
---
I am hugging ghouls once per hour since I've noticed this myself too.
---
The game is almost dead. Soon the devs will abadon it. The time for getting shit together is over. 
---
Cheers for thatvwas wondering if I should max out TK on my ranger build
---

When I did it again after a reset, I bypassed the beginning steps and went straight for her body, got the ID, and it checkpointed. Not guaranteeing it'll work, but it did for me. 
---
I'll definitely be giving this a try in the morning. I'm pretty sure I have most if not all of these mods unlocked and should be able to put this into use. Thank you for sharing, and for your rigorous research! 
---
I‚Äôm still subscribed to this subreddit just to receive the news of 76 map being launched for solo gameplay. Can‚Äôt wait, see the whole MP experience falling apart already! 
---
that's why you should get bird bones. Less iron man landings
---
Suggestion for CAMP decor:
---
Can we have a small refilling wood-pile for next to our building?  This adds character and would be useful in areas where there are few logs, like WhiteSpring. 
---
Not trainstation, in Park [camden park](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/b/b9/Camden_Park.png/revision/latest?cb=20181210213531) this bus
---
I'm still subscribed to this subreddit just to receive the news of 76 map made bigger and more people per map and joining friends not a hassle.
---
&gt;Noting that somehow there are 4 .50 ball shots loaded
---
Quick Hands Luck Perk?
---
I am not toxic one, i enjoy game. Not going on internet to tell everyone how bad it is. 
---
Btw: you are too not king of making perfectly sentence.
---
 Yeah the guy who made the PA and gave it to boyfriend, never registered it. When he hit scan that is the end of that quest, the of the guy, who made your boyfriend's PA. So I guess your boyfriend is stuck with having finished it, I dunno. ;(
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs an Atom Shop item. If so, it can‚Äôt be placed in someone else‚Äôs camp, just as items with Atom Shop skins can‚Äôt be traded, dropped, or sold. 
---
Gave you all an upvote..... I despise Negative Nancy‚Äôs .
---
Players also learn from their mistakes, a.k.a. Joining a fight that will most likely include :
---
- huge frame rate drop
---
- loot not showing up...
---
- ... and when it does it‚Äôs often very disappointing 
---
- being disconnected from the server which often lead to a lot of ammo wasted and junk lost
---
Yah I had that message warning happen several times during that time period also. It would come with huge spikes of lag and stuttering before it happened for me and hubby tho.
---
They've been talking about delays as bugs have been a primary issue. If there's an explicit "x hours of content will be released on y date" it'll stop the back and forth speculation
---
As already pointed out to you, you've posted this before. It's clear from your username that this is a promotional account. Read our rules and follow them going forward.
---
 Flatwood's Monster has quite a bit. ;)
---
In terms of an auction house, the most likely is the Whitesprings. There are a TON of rooms there that are currently unused which would be perfect. The theatre, for instance, would work like an auditorium, or one of the sealed rooms on the second and third floors. Heck, the entire fourth floor is currently unknown and off-limits! Tons of spots!  
---
So, you could have  acentral auction house there, but also have small player-vendorbots at your camp, letting the low-level players use CAMP shopping while teh mid-range and up hop to teh Whitesprings.   
---
Everybody wins!  
---
(And everyone wins MORE if you can get a refrigerator-like venodr that you could stock with food that wouldn't start to  go bad until purchased, letting people swing by and grab munchies before going out on adventure. Help those of us who love to cook out and provide a service for those who don't want to bother with teh survival aspects.)
---
What a strange, pointless comment.
---
Yes thats exactly what this game needs... more atom shop items....
---
They could fix it, but I doubt their will to do so.
---
Not a single person can understand a blatant joke 
---
Wow. Stay in school man.
---
Life's been good to him
---
Looks good, but to be fair most of these aren't bugs, they're just suggestions
---
I don't think camp vending is "terrible" but you are right. Make one market.
---
I feel ya. Doing the same Thing since Yesterday. Not using that many rounds bc of melee build and  almost no stimpaks bc of healing factor mutation.
---
Quit yesterday after 15 - 20 tries with 2-3 disconnects last attempt i finaly destroyed all mainframes pressed Activate on a Terminal where Hacker 3 was needed I only got Hacker 2 but my Charakter sat down and got stuck with no way to get out. Gona try again today anyway 
---
Where are you at (timezone)?
---
Also, r/fo76FilthyCasuals is a good place to find people to play together.
---
Can you really tell op is joking?
---
Totally missed the sarcarsm. Props to him.
---
Wow, i love it!
---
My only complaint about Country Roads is that it‚Äôs not the original. 
---
Can you show a picture so I can confirm the existence please? üòÅ
---
Will you be online soon?
---
Funny thing is hitting turrets with VATS melee will glitch you throught the celling 5/10 times 
---
Is there know bug, that makes quest markers in HUD to follow your view than disappearing when not faced directly to it. Also when after death, I drop my "doggybag" and then if I die again bofore I reach it, marked duplicates even by "doggybag" is in other location. This can happen multiple times if you die before you reach it again and you dropped loot is somewhere near skull symbol, not in any of diamond markers that are on my HUD and map
---
Thanks for putting in all this work! &lt;3
---
Level 450. If todays patch is scruffy I'm probably gonna try warframe. I enjoy PvE looting and shooting. And the Fallout universe. Plus my knowledge of 76 is fairly extensive now. Fingers crossed for content.
---
Bullshit. I have way more than 100h on Skyrim, none of it was grinding. It was exploring, questing, trying new builds, in short: playing the content.
---
Last three years I'm making documentation for devices used to automate rail crossings. For example that shiny shit that tells you, to stop, or you will be smacked by train. Why should i go to school?
---
Pretty sure they already abandoned it. 
---
Yeah imagine.... It'll shoot out lasers. You'll be like Cyclops
---
That's the craziest thing I've heard about this . I guess the only thing to do is avoid fast travelling there for now , but this doesn't seem like something they'll be able to fix earlier on since it's a slightly different issue in regards to each player . 
---
Thats usually what happens. They blame base employees and replace them. 
---
It gives positive feedback from costumers ("wow they fired the responsibles for this mess!"), and the corporates truly responsible for the direction the game took are left untouched.
---
Same.
---
Lol :D
---
Yeah, re-read your sentences. Fucking moron.
---
In Australia (7:25 pm.) And thanks! I‚Äôll check it out. (New to reddit) :) 
---
With regards to perk sharing:  
---
If I have a Charisma of 3, I can share a one point card. If I contract ‚Äúthe blight‚Äù, I stop sharing that card. 
---
The reverse is not true. If I boost my Charisma with, say, magnetic personality to a level of 6, I cannot share a 2 point card. 
---
You poor guy...
---
I was server-hopping the other day, while in my camp. 2 agro Mothmans, 1 Mythical Flatwoods Monster, in around 7 hops total. It felt weird.
---
Heeeey...one of those posts is mine! Glad to be rounded up in here, hopefully my statistic will prove useful. For the record, I don't think it has happened to me a second time. If it has, it was not one of my primary items. I now check every time I enter a world to make sure that the weapon I had equipped when I last logged out is still there, or I check my quick wheel. Thanks for the post, you are right, inventory stability is absolutely core.
---
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** MlhDowland! ^(hug)
---
Yea sure. Im toxic because people are being toxic in a thread that has no insult towards anyone and seeking help! Oh well that makes me toxic glad to no the PC culture growing too much that SEEKING help is being toxic but saying shit in the comments is not the issue it's always the OP who should be zen like a monk and dont react.
---
Great ideology.
---
Whitesprings is awesome for Fluorescent.  There‚Äôs a ton of it there. There‚Äôs also a large quantity of Yellowcake with a few silt beans and sap around for Cobalt. 
---
The two best places to get Violet are FSP and just south of the water park, though the latter lacks a large quantity of enemies so have your other mats before hitting it. There‚Äôs also a large amount of cobalt there (look in the water for the mutated bloodleaf). 
---
Morgantown has a fair amount of ghouls that spawn and plenty of mutfruit (Cobalt). 
---
So this evening I just wanted to launch a nuke with my buddies and try out my new Cryolater on the SBQ. Getting through the silo was effing HORRIBLE. Lag is so bad every time we go in there now. I mean, c'mon.  we even hopped servers, it was bad on every server. I didn't think we were going to make it through. AND we did make it through: 3 times! BUT. Never did get any loot off any enemy inside the silo, couldn't pick ANYTHING up.  Couldn't craft mainframe cores, had to look for the ones laying around and then wait to be able to pick those up. PRESS E , well yeah, but can't pick it up, gotta wait like 5 minutes.
---
Had to do the biometric card thing like 3x in one silo, because it kept telling me I needed a card when I"d already done that. IT was like the entire way through, each time we did it.
---
And when we killed the SBQ (the cryolater rocks on the SBQ by the way!), I got no loot. Was waitin for the loot to load and got discoed. NO LOOT FOR YOU!
---
UGH it's so hard to launch nukes now. The lag is just TERRIBLE. 
---
1200 lbs of junk doesn‚Äôt sound like reasonable quantities to me.
---
Also, holy crap, level 450. That‚Äôs either impressive or really sad. 
---
I love helping low level players also.  Ill be happy to grind whitespring with you all. Im level 91. Bored af, grinding for level 100.
---
Add me psn: paulofg1980
---
You can turn the noise down in settings. Used to annoy the crap out of me til I found this out. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúfootsteps‚Äù setting in audio. Doesn‚Äôt effect the footsteps from other players or enemies. 
---
I farm not enough ore to ever deplete my acid stash ... i have still over 1k.
---
Does that mean you can get unlimited caps via multiple transactions?
---
Kinda sounds like it‚Äôs real life equivalent (though the real life version is not man portable)  
---
Has anyone from the development team contacted you/thanked you? 
---
These lists are fantastic! They‚Äôre insightful, informative, and you are offering solution that will work. Thanks for your work. You should be thanked for what you do. 
---
I get the impression alot of computer engineers (engineers in general) don‚Äôt like to admit when they‚Äôre wrong or have made a mistake. When someone points out these mistakes, they act defensive and spiteful. Not sure what‚Äôs going on over there at Bethesda Austin, but it‚Äôs time they start talking to the members of this community who actually care and want to help them solve problems. 
---
I get the impression they ignore folks like you because they think they know better, when it is clear as day they don‚Äôt. 
---
Anyway, great write up. This game is truly lost if it alienates those who want to help it survive.
---
Ah ok
---
Well ive helped defend several workshop just for xp and rewards. I throw a thumbs up and go back to my Camp. 
---
That may be the case sometimes but I know for a fact my friend also had the perk and it didn‚Äôt work on me while mine worked for him. It just stops working for no good reason 
---
I think the best for selling to vendors is grabing marine helmet plans and crafting them : few mats for crafting and 28 caps per helmet with the selling perk maxed. 
---
Just wait for the jet pack. I‚Äôve got the plan for the T51 and it‚Äôs 5 Cobalt and 5 violet on top of the other mats. 
---
probably got more legendary wood armor than i have found normal wood armor.
---
That's also good. Might be hard at lower levels though. I'm level 101 and I still haven't found those plans üòÖ
---
I‚Äôm hoping these new hires are to help with development of the SINGLE PLAYER games.
---
Thank you! I needed this- saving this post!
---
sent request 
---
To be fair, they were experimenting with ultracite (and probably flux) before the war. This is made clear by the existence of the glassed caverns, a reference to the heat of the first nuclear blast turning the desert sand to a special glass known as trinitite.
---
There were also numerous holo tapes inside the caverns that made it clear they were detonating nukes down there. 
---
i think one exists on pc made by a bunch of modders. correct me if im wrong, fonline? i think is its name.
---
What‚Äôs funny is I‚Äôm sure nobody wants any part of working for BGS Austin and I wouldn‚Äôt blame them
---
What platform are you on? 
---
I've never heard of that happening so much in one go. Try checking your Internet connection (speed test/stability). That may be the problem.
---
Oh boy, a bit far away for me, haha.
---
But you'll find lots of people there!
---
You're very welcome, I'm glad it's useful to someone! üòÅ
---
Yesterday i took workshop, then i did Scorchebeast queen (we nuked fisure site) collected things from workshop, killed second queen, collected again, killed third queen, collected workshop and then done two events. Then we changed servers to be able to send another nuke. Is that stable egouth for you?
---
they're designing the game like a typical online experience but without any of the fun parts (engaging events, persistent world changes, end-game, group content, streamlined PvP, etc).
---
I have a god pc and god internet and it's DCing me as well. It's the servers/game, not us.
---
I am on PC. I just gave up after the 6th disconnect. 
---
My internet connection is fine and no interruptions at all, not on wifi either.
---
I just can't get out of the vault because I would get disconnected =\_=
---
This is no longer possible to do, or I would gladly build one for you.
---
I purchased mine when a friend said his friend built one for him in his camp,.  I said NOPE that item is an atomic shop exclusive camp item and cannot be placed in someone else‚Äôs camp.  But he assured me he did not own the sign.  I was so sure I was right I bought the sign on the spot to prove he was full of shit.  However, to my surprise, he was right and I built a second red rocket sign in his camp.
---
A few weeks back during one of the updates to fix the duping another friend who I built a red rocket sign for moved her camp.  When rebuilding she could no longer place the new stirred red rocket sign as she did not own the sign herself.  She too had purchased the red rocket door for her camp, and there is no longer anything I can do to help either of my friends but tell them to hold out hope that it will be back in the atomic shop again.
---
But trust me when I tell you, it will be back.  They are simply creating artificial demand for a product that really has no limited supply.
---
While I would like to get preachy and rant about why you should not support their cash grabby practices, who am I to talk, I didn't even buy it for my own use. ;p
---
Not really, it not usually that bad. The worst it has been for me is disconnects every 20-30 minutes for a few days. And on very odd occasion 3-4 disconnects in a row. I guess 6 is not that far from 4, heh, but I think its statistically rare. Unless you are taking like 3 hours to get out or something.
---
the worst game breaking  i've heard, sorry.
---
Oh... Trust me, after the 3rd or 4th, I just tried to rush out without looking around, which is a shame because usually I like to explore, and as I was trying to grab the pill bottles or whatever it just disconnected me...
---
Omg.. I just started playing, 200 caps a day is a lot? Jesus. Thanks for saving me the discoragment of thinking i would be getting low amounts lol.
---
the grind would be OK if it was leading up to something. right now there's nothing but perpetual roaming to do. it's fine, but it's also very simple and gets boring long-term.
---
other games that offer huge grind will also offer a lot of content beyond the grind that will allow you to really feel the reward and progression of your grind.
---
because enemies and damage scale here, even if you keep on leveling, you'll not notice any difference. after you've made your build and got all perk cards, there isn't anything left to do in terms of progression other than grinding legendaries for lucky affixes.
---
legendaries is a horrible end-game. end-game shouldn't consist of RNG solely; how are you supposed to feel/reap the benefits of your progress in an organic way if it's all gated by chance anyway?
---
i've played BDO for nearly 2000 hours, most of it active grinding, and i'm still relatively poor/don't have that good gear (it's a korean grind MMO). i don't mind at all, because they offer a lot of content (constant and consistent events, integrated guild system with guild missions, world PvP/node wars/siege wars, world bosses) and the grind in itself is very varied (you can grind 'reputation'/amenity with NPCs, complete/attain knowledge to unlock bonuses, buy houses/shops/workers to send out to your business in the world, and so on. this is apart from the typical killing grind.
---
i don't have a problem with the grind in this game either, but it quite obviously is not leading anywhere nor does it show any substantial progression. pretty sure my friends keep making new characters because it's the only way they can feel any progression in this game. which would also explain why i'm not playing as much after level 90 because i've already got all my perk cards.
---
&gt;That excitement turned to bitter disappointment 
---
That statement sums up FO76 quite nicely
---
Take it easy. You may have some anger managment issues. 
---
I was a stark defender of the game avoiding r/fallout they were right man
---
:D
---
Im not sure if you are trolling or you are just being naive.  Either way there is ni point to argue with you and waste my time 
---
Yes, there is "ni" point in this.
---
Exactly 
---
The Camp shop allows for easy griefing so thats really not a good idea. And you're totally right. People dont want to fast travel around just for trading. A central marketplace is just perfect.
---
This reminds me of the Black Market on Minecraft prison servers xD
---
Congrats dude. That‚Äôs a crazy weapon I think it‚Äôs one of a kind. 
---
There's a tiny swath you can't nuke...but Morgantown gets nuked semi-frequently because of the ghouls. That's a very low level zone. Just as one example. 
---
Thank you! I will treasure this weapon and will not let any trolls to get this gun :D
---
I have been using a lv50 Anti Armor Hunting Rifle with the Perforating modification, 9 perks in Rifleman and 3 in Tank Killer and even though I want an Instigating Hunting Rifle I honestly feel as if the AA HR may be better than the instigating against certain armored enemies.
---
Now that's a real fan
---
You'll be up to 600 in no time. I make 1400 a day right now, but I'm saving up for stuff like calibrated shocks and jetpacks for my power armor (and those damn Signs &amp; Letters at 9100 caps), so it's all relative üòâ
---
I can do the silos (they are all the same btw) in less than 15 minutes and that is with 50 HP (low life build).  
---
" 6 fusion cores 32 stimpacks 24 Radaway 1000 rounds .5mm 80‚Äù rounds .556 Repaired All Rise and Black Diamond 6-7 times 5 Nuka quantum 8 Nuka cherry 24 purified water 12 cans dog food ".....I cant even fathom how that is possible.  Something is wrong with your build or your playstyle or something.

I was a level 48 melee build going in completely blind so i was wondering about a bit
---
He despawns after a while. i have seen him spawn in and out everytime i have meet him.
---
Odd I was running around in the control room farming robots for steel at lvl 99, I did die once lol but all good. If I'm on just hit me up to help you clear the mobs, better yet I'll clear you do the rest. PSN RooBeeO
---
You guys should all just play wow vanilla on Lights Hope. 
---
If you are a meanderer, you are going to have great fun with the game, when it starts working. lulz. Are you getting lag as well? If so, check you have IPv6 enabled on your network adapter (it is by default), as the way they have the servers configured, they can send you to a far away server geographically if relying on IPv4 geo IP, which will increase instability.  I am in Australia and the kept connecting me to Germany (about as far away from Australia as you can get before you start coming back again) after a patch for about a week, until I worked it out. Yet after this most recent patch I always only connect to the US which is okayish. When I initially had this issue I tried to broach it with support, that flatly told me they had no way of telling me who connects to which server, and could not pass on my concerns to a networking team or whatever. Which is the equivalent of '&lt;shrug&gt; Bad luck Chuck'. Sorry for the rant, I hope things improve for you cause it can be a great adventure.
---
Sorry got on a bit later than planned.

GT blynn93
---
&gt; **Demolition Expert "Nerf" Destroyed the Build and made several Niche weapons worthless.**.  
---
This is just making drama for the sake of drama. Yes, the balance change can be felt ingame, but "destroyed" is big hyperbole. The buffed damage went from 200% to 160%. That means 20% decrease in total damage. How can this count as "worthless" or "destroyed" is beyond me. 
---
So the tldr is that when the Scorchbeast Queen lands you kill her fast as heck with that godly sword.
---
I haven't been having any issues lately.  4 hour+ login times with no disconnects.  I still do every once in awhile but it seems to have been cleared up quite a bit. 
---
Huh. TIL. That'd probably work. (Also magazines came up with Google on the term ü§£)
---
Can't inv to team, comms ban.
---
We're at our houses by the WV lumber co
---
First off, yes you should consider that, as the Austin team likely didn't want to be landed all of this hatred as their very first game and they're human beings too. Second, there won't be a class action lawsuit because of Bethesda's ToS and you're making a lot of assumptions.
---
Instigating Explosive Gauss one shots everything except scorchbeasts.
---
This won‚Äôt be changed good luck to the rest of this community honestly you guys are the dying light of the trust for Bethesda and this game stand proud cuz you all have a hell of a lot of moxxy 
---
That's why I quit, the first Nerf when it made workshops pretty shitastic I uninstalled.
---
Thanks for suggestions i look into these 
---
I may save this post (good job), but am just enjoying a new map for what is so far, fallout 5 for me (friends are stick on ark, rust, and atlas).
---
Wait... I'm meant to be using rifleman with the handmade? I thought it was an auto rifle so I only equip them with the lever. Fffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu. I live in australia and know fuck all about guns.
---
Oh Maxon is completely genocidal and nothing but a tyrant, but he's not the only problem. I'm pretty damn loyal to the Lyon's Pride, but they're not a representation of the true BoS. The mainland brotherhood actually branded Lyons a traitor for prioritising helping people over collecting technology and consider him a rogue variable who kidnapped the heir to their throne.
---
The BoS are guilty of a lot of crimes, for all their good intentions they also: 
---
- Kill any mutant without question, ghouls and intelligent super mutants are all fair game. Their end goal is the complete genocide of all mutants, ghouls, and synths alike.
---
- Brainwash and indoctrinate their children into the BoS without allowing them any contact with the outside world, ensuring they grow up with the same unwavering and uncompromising fanatical cult loyalty as their parents.
---
- Will happily strong-arm supplies away from settlers who need them to feed their own bellies rather than grow their own, much like a common raider gang.
---
- Have no respect or regard for common wastelanders, referring to them like cavemen who are beneath them.
---
- Will happily massacre anybody innocent or not who gets in their way, such as when Veronica tried to leave them for the followers of the apocalypse (a humanitarian aid faction) and the BoS showed up and vaporized them under the assumption Veronica would share BoS secrets to them.
---
Not even Lyon's Pride are immune to these issues, I love the Pride and still hope their are rebel members of the BoS somewhere in DC fighting for that ideal but even they weren't exempt. Knights of the pride have been reported and seen by the Lone Wanderer firing at Underworld without provocation simply because it's a ghoul settlement, refusing outside members and brainwashing their young much like the rest of the BoS, and killing settlers outside Megaton who dared complain about their water going missing.
---
The BoS mean well but their intensive cult like fanaticism has turned them into a faction not unlike the Enclave or a group of raiders in power armour.
---
Add in Ninja while sneaking and this sword should one shot pretty much anything except the queen
---
Water is the way to go early game.  It cannot be looted or dropped if you are killed or die.  Unlike other food products water never goes bad.  Chems of all types are good to sell, but it‚Äôs cheaper to just kill ghouls and sell their chems than to make the chems and sell them.  But hands down pure water is the most useful resource you will need anyway.
---
&gt; I don't understand what their end goal is either. It's not like we can buy weapon drops with microtransactions, but they seem to be designing the game is if that was the case!
---
This is what's truly baffling about Fallout 76. So much of the game feels designed to force you into buying microtransactions to get better gear and make the game easier. It's classic online game monetisation. Guide the game over successive updates and patches into being virtually unplayable for players unwilling to buy microtransactions.
---
Only... there are no microtransactions. 
---
It's bizarre. 
---
That's good news. Any update on the roadmap that was talked a few weeks ago?
---
Isn't there a maximum of 24 players per server? I also think people are wrongly assuming it's a server problem, I think it's a game engine problem, hence the carry limit, it also could be a network issue depending on traffic at the time although I don't have stats for this.
---
When you are having fun keep playing. When you stop having fun drop the game. We play the games for fun. Not because of some company, some roadmap or some franchise. Just for fun. Simple as that. I dropped the Witcher games because they weren't fun, for example. I had no need to force myself to play it just because the internet has some opinion of the game. 
---
Whatcha think?
---
We've currently got two other neighbors as well.
---
Hmm not entirely true.  I'm disabled to the point of being unable to work.  I live alone and games are an important outlet and form of entertainment to me but I can only one maybe every two months, and that's pushing it a bit.  So yeah, this has been a disappointment for me, that last patch did it.  I don't whinge I've just gone back to fallout 4 for now, but I do wish I'd chosen RDR2 instead of this one as it'll be the end of the month before I can afford another game.
---
Thought about this but some servers everyone and their mother shows up and she wont go down.
---
I suggest you validate the game files. Log out of the  launcher and log back in. Even if you are on a wired connection it could still be dropping due to an issue. Check your internet speed, reset your router and try again.
---
Thank you for bringing back server hopping mechanics, I bet everyone misses it!
---
The small problem with this is that, you know, it would actually favor dupers as well if not more than they already aresince they can now dupe the legendary weapon mods instead (And have a wider audience since not necessarily everyone is interested in, say, a TSE shotgun or a TSE Lever Action, but pretty much everyone would be interested in having their favorite weapon as a TSE, unless they are melee users, of course). 
---
It's a bit more complex, you are correct
---
Basically, there is a curve of weapon damage per shot relative to dps, and as dam increases dps generally decreases, with a few exceptions.
---
a machete with 500 damage is better than a super sledge with 1000 damage because both are so far above the 200 armor ideal zone that the faster attack speed is better, but if there were an enemy with 700 armor the machete would be dramatically worse. The minigun is trash because it is so far below the armor zone that it would need over three times it's current dps to compete at it's current damage rate, or about triple the fire rate. But if there was an enemy in the game that had enough health that you weren't one shotting it, and no armor, the dps of the minigun would be the best answer. But enemies are all between 100 and 200 armor, so there are specific weapons that work best, and the rest are completely unnecessary in this game.
---
So, basically they're preparing for a switch to f2p now that they've milked us suckers who actually bought the game. Looks that way at least.
---
Happens all the time when I play on a team and usually once a day when playing solo for a while.. maybe it's location based idk if they have regional servers
---
Sent you a friend request. 
---
Spot on!
---
same in every damn game. brilliant enemy AI doesn't fucking exist. 
---
You obviously never touched GTA Online or ARK: Survival Evolved. Now the grind there? that's fucking demoralizing. 
---
Or, and here's a better idea, make seperate PvP and PvE servers and don't nerf weapons because of PvP.
---
then play those.
---
Good point but bounty hunting is a thrill when playing PvP
---
Ex-act-f**king-ly! It's so bizarre!
---
&gt;I hope this exploit is dealt with and fast so I can get back to bounty hunting without losing all my junk and caps to a player who has the gauntlet and a tone of assassins and sentinel armor come at me with nothing stopping him.
---
Could you please explain how this is an exploit? By exploit I presume you mean something like bobblehead stacking. From my understanding the method you described above is simply using the ingame mechanics available to everyone. 
---
On that note, there are also numerous was to counter these players, including just not engaging in pvp with them. 
---
Game's over, this is the pinnacle of loot.
---
Mountebanks.
---
&gt; I do wish I'd chosen RDR2 instead of this one
---
You're better off renting it from gamefly or something. Outside of the main story, there's no content. The online mode is more barren than what the average detractor of fallout 76 believes is barren. And that's coming from someone who actually plays RDR2, beat the game, managed to get to level 24, and literally did everything outside of horse races, before they got bored of it.
---
I don't know why everybody has problem with pvp. I don't do pvp but if someone want pvp he had no chance. Just put out Gamma gun or radium rifle. The radiation does the rest. For Unyielding Enemys 1-2 shot with gamma gun for assassin sentinel enemys maybe 4-5 shoots depending on you gamma gun dmg 
---
Which is obviously how it became common building materials like in a Fusion Cores at your chem bench? Or for standard part for power armor like T-45 and T-51?  Sure sing what ever song lets you sleep at night, but this is just retconning in SHIT.  
---
But here‚Äôs the rub, I am not opposed to retconning in things to the game, just do it smartly.  So the art department wants to draw new power armor for fallout 4? No problem, but make it make MORE sense, tell us it was POST war developed by the BoS. But to add in T-60 that is widely available pre-war but never seen before Fallout 4. . . . More care should have been taken.
---
Yes it is technically not an exploit but when you encounter them for the first time (they usually have a bounty) and they one hit kill you it just builds up your rage and so you  attempt to kill them again but they just kill you and you end up losing a tone of caps
---
Thanks for the tip
---
I was wondering if this was the case. All of my unarmed weaponry is instigating, and I tend to punch things in the back of the skull. I'll have to try shooting them in the foot or something first.
---
well they released an embarrassing product.
---
It won't complete.... Not a bug I don't think. It's just not finished. think it's gonna continue on into the dlc. 
---
They have 19% hps.  Thats 57hps  on average. Just kill them. If they have sentinel/assasins. Use some high fire rate explosive / staggering melee. 
---
I will oneshot you with istagasting sniper rifle, you will die in one hit doing pvp anyway when you can't make tactic.
---
Othervise - pasive mode - they can't kill you thru slap damage. If you have workshop, don't.
---
Wow.  Where did you find it???
---
Again it is players choice to engage in pvp in the current pve servers. As far as I see this is the same style of complaints (not singling you out here at all just saying in general) that was stated about the tse weapons. Agree with previous comment I saw on this thread, nerfing is not the answer. It is player choice how to respond. If you or anyone else doesn't want to loose a tone of caps then do not engage a tone of times which is obviously being done to loose that many caps. There is a choice to not seek revenge for a reason.. 
---
oof
---
My first scorchbeast kill was at about the same level. At the Red Rocket in the Ash Heap. I was so thrilled, I took a screenshot. [My First Scorchbeast ](https://imgur.com/gallery/98uimQj) 
---
Me and 3 other players tried to kill this guy in whitesprings but we all failed, another player using this technique ended up joining the server and did the same thing to us
---
yet somehow apex legends released a week ago and already has a road map of content 
---
I uninstalled about a week ago but I'll still defend the game. It's a mess of a product but I got a good 150-200 hours out of it. Beyond that, it has a good base structure of a game. Given some time, I can absolutely see it becoming a really great game and I can't wait to return to it when that happens. The question is if they can turn it around fast enough. 
---
Thanks for the tip mate, I appreciate 
---
I play for 3 to 8 hours everyfuckinday since the beta doing everything possible to gain xp and I‚Äôm only lvl 145 so... i guess it is sad.
---
They dont always uses their "crop dusting" (I call it acid p*ss) attack in my experience. 
---
Maybe you just got good? Not everything has to be explained or answered by the dreaded word - nerf
---
I don't want to insult you, but you are weak and they are Best In Slot geared. Thats like complaining that players with high resilence in world of warcraft are hard to kill.
---
yeah i too try to avoid those people, but they earned that gear. (assasin/sentinel should be little nerfed tho)
---
I agree 100%. I see the point of those suggesting WS for utility reasons, but TBH, I'm burnt on WS as may be others. The map is large, &amp; it would be nice to give players somewhere else to frequent besides that damned resort. 
---
judging by fallout 76 being one of the most broken lack luster recent triple a release I guess Bethesda doesnt know how to manage it either
---
Blazemarko99 add me were u from
---
Ha! Acid P*ss. Love it, am calling it that from now on.
---
I'll take that I've gotten good. Makes me feel better.
---
Bethesda - for only 2000 atoms you can get a .05% chance of better drops from 3 star legendaries from 1am to 4am on mondays and wednesdays. 
---
nice idea! agreed.
---
Country Music circa 1952. Male vocal. A man's lament over love lost due to his unfaithfulness. No issues, I suspect the folks at Obsidian, who did the original fallout games understood why lore was important.  I don't have a problem with covers of old music, it lends to the idea of the split in the time line between our universe and the Fallout universe.
---
So while I don't care for country roads as I don't feel it represents the appropriate time periods, I am less bothered by the cover as it may have been written by someone else in the universe where things didn't play out quite the same.
---
I had it in my stash. Don't remember honestly
---
I stopped playing the game, but still listen to the music. Inon always writes real bangers.
---
I'd say level 30 is about where you can start killing the bullies.
---
A lot of it is just getting over the lack of confidence.
---
I believe some of all of the effects from strange in numbers can be reduced by opening the social tab after the teammate drops group, and clicking leave party.
---
I believe the real error is probably some formula that multiplies mutations based on x number of teammates, and the bug leaving the player as being considered in a group, with 0 actual teammates.
---
To prove this, if you click social, leave team, you can leave a team, even if you are solo, provided another player has previously left or disconnected, and many or all of the bugged effects are cured, or at the least, the negative values are diminished.
---
&gt; Sadly, my quest is glitched out 
---
How?
---
Given the ~3 months it's been out they've mostly treaded water. A lot of good fixes but it's still not close to where it needs to be to start adding meaningful content.
---
If potential buyers check in on the game months out and at least they have added content like Sea of Thieves or No Man's Sky (both launch disasters), at least they may think "maybe this is the time to jump in". But when people see the game has spent months solely to bug fix, and it still isn't fixed, I don't think a lot of people are going to bite at a sale.
---
There's been such a huge outflux of players that they really need some new content to get players back in and they just seem incapable of doing that.
---
I hope it improves but lack faith in them.
---
it is fun but pretty weak.
---
Yup. Played the beta, never purchased. Can't uninstall for the same reason. Had to track down the files manually and delete them. 
---
When I saw them I thought it was an Oblivion reference, the dialogue resembles the one from the npcs of that game. 
---
"Get their shit together"
---
"Bethesda"
---
Pick one.
---
Its just rng. Ive had 2 bloodied deathclaw gauntlets drop the past two days ( one 3* god roll, the other 2* level 40 so I hunted down the nearest lvl 40 player and dropped it for him haha)  and many other nice drops including a second explosive handmade. Ive had this problem plenty of killing 3* enemies and only getting 1* loot or nothing at all and its frustrating but it makes it far more satisfying imo when you recieve a good drop. I must say though once I got around lvl 140+ my legendary drops seemed to get a whole lot better...
---
&gt; oh goddamnit my quest reset.
---
This quest doesn't reset -- once you've got the quest you can start at any BoS transponder.  Hell, you can ignore them all and go straight for Taggerty, just using the very last transponder to get her message.
---
81 days post your post and it‚Äôs still bugged.. 
---
That's how it works.  No need to do all the steps at all.
---
I can't speak to the ammo and power armor issues, but if they are getting screwed by BGS in the game, then  the virginity thing is up for debate. ;)
---
Nerf Melee, that is all ;)
---
Hooray! Was good to see you and thanks for the gifts üòÑ
---
There is only 2 scortched beast far as im aware that due the "unlimited AP attack bug". 
---
1: The 1 specific scortched beast that spawns on DROP SITE V9 as a Quest enemy. Its suppose to do that to the bunker to make you shit your pants and take cover. Its even in the lore of the computer. 
---
2: Diseased scortched beasts will do the bug until they are no longer diseased. Ive seen one do its scream for 5 minutes straight but once the diseased status went away it stopped and landed. 
---
May be random but this is what i believe is the case. Being a beast hunter for awhile and all. 
---
My friend also has this happen to him, we have no answer 
---
Remove vats already
---
I carry an auto pipe pistol for this purpose, it is highly effective
---
Yeah its just luck and observation on the server befoer you nuke. No point nuking if everyone is under lvl 50 in my opinion. Usally low level players have no idea of the amount of armor or damage mitagtion the 
---
&gt; After all of that when I get the quest update to check Taggerty's corpse and loot her for her ID and everything else in the room, 
---
You used the last transponder?  (That is the only one you need to use at all!)
---
Another idea would be "gears by slots, junk by weight". You can choose to increase your slots, or to increase junk stash weight when you level up. That would be fair to all kinds of players, whether you're a heavy weapon build or pistol build. But I don't know if that is possible for the current engine.
---
I said this in another thread as well: I don't want every single container to be bursting with caps or anything, but when I've made some kind of effort I'd like to be rewarded for it. 
---
Picking a rank 2 locked door and only finding a paintbrush, a screwdriver and a can of turpentine on the other side isn't very fun, and killing a three-star Legendary and only finding some bullets and a few bits of fiberglass is correspondingly less fun. 
---
All they need to do is the following: 
---
Nerf the following mutations and legendary effects: 
---
Adrenline Reaction: 50% damage increase
---
Bloodied: 50% damage increase
---
Talons: 10%
---
Twisted Muscles: 10% 
---
If this was done, most melee wouldn't hit for over 1000 and would be much more balanced in my opinion. 
---
No it wouldn't.
---
How much project management and software engineering experience do you have?
---
Seriously, where do people get these ridiculous ideas?
---
this guy gets it. FUN&gt;Power. I use fatmans all day. 
---
I have an 50% anti-armor L45 handmade legendary that dropped from a three star legendary gutsy at the broken down trains north east of Whitesprings. Gave it an anti armor clip mod too. I'm a Slugger melee build but with the three rifleman perk cards that increase damage by 30%, I can honestly say that I do tear through scorchbeasts even when they are flying!
---
also have tank killer L3, I have 6 Perception and stack tank killer with Rifleman, but leave the Rifleman perk cards at one star (first 30% damage increase takes 3 cards, next 30% damage increase requires 6)
---
Good to know. 
---
Guess i'll head back to grafton tomorrow. 
---
I have the same issue. I never got a 3* gear from 3* enemies. Im lvl 80 now. Only queens gave me actual 3* gear but yeah. Although the 3* do not deop nothing just only 1*s.
---
They may want to consider remapping those keys or better yet...
---
Let us map our own keys to our liking. All of them. Like it's been requested during the early days of the beta back in October.
---
I dont know about you but imo they are pretty rare. Absolutly not worth hunring for 3* enemies with that current loot pool. 
---
30 minutes at reddit market, 2h of actual research put into game mechanics, 1h to implement those basic changes into your character, 10h of exping if you are lacking lots of levels - and you do not need any purchased loot, you are doing just fine.
---
I agree thay loot tables are shitty, RNG is a mofo, and I think legendary crafting is a must to save the game, but I just can't agree that you need microtransaction gear to play it.
---
I told myself I'd come back once content is here and game is fixed. Hell I didn't even finish the main quest, still at the "Kill scorchbeasts or starred enemies" on Enclave quest line.
---
Yesterday I uninstalled to free space on my drive for Anthem. I tried, I really did, but I probably won't come back to FO76. Got back in Elder Scrolls Online, got Insurgency : Sandstorm for my PvP cravings, got Anthem for a big open world coop.. And reinstalled Fallout 4 with a ton of mods for my Post Nuclear goodness.
---
Maybe in 6 months I'll reinstall and see if things got better, but right now I just can't bring myself to login.
---
And all my friends who played the game are the same and either uninstalled or switched back to other things.
---
It's a shame really, so much potential feels wasted.
---
Depends on which receiver you use. with an Automatic receiver you use commando perks, if not, use rifleman.
---
Adrenal Reaction buffs guns as well.  Tested and true.  I use it for my Rifle build, along with Bloodied for my Gatling gun and short range recon AR.  Been a while since any melee PVP'ers have gotten close enough without a stealthboy.  For Assasins Sentinels, Instigating Gamma gun, for Unyeilding Sentinels the same to equal effect due to low health anyway.  There's no exploit here, only strategies using known game mechanics.
---
I see you guys didn't grow up playing RuneScape if you think this is a grind! If I can go up a couple levels and maybe get some okay loot every time I play I'm happy!
---
The knockdown was worth it for me, but I modded it as well.
---
That is not correct. I have an instigating lever action rifle which can one shot mobs and regularly take out legendaries in a single shot. They still drop legendary items. I‚Äôve also tested by allowing the mob to heal and they‚Äôve then not dropped an item. Whatever‚Äôs going on it has nothing to do with healing. The ‚Äúlet their health drop and regenerate‚Äù thing is a superstition.
---
One of the easiest guns to build, mats wise.  Just build and scrap until you learn the plans.
---
Why are u still playing the game? Uninstall it and save yourself the headache and heartache.
---
Yesterday I killer numerous Legendary‚Äôs, several 3*. Most dropped nothing, that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve got nothing from a legendary. Is this a new bug? 
---
Removing VATS would be the same as removing Deathclaws or some other iconic fallout feature. 
---
Vats is one of the features that makes Fallout actually Fallout
---
This game needs the Final Fantasy 14 treatment. Go back and rethink everything.   
---
The gameplay loop of Fallout 4 while simpler it was more fun and if they double down on adding actual NPC's that roam the wasteland and create random battles like you can on Fallout 4 it would be awesome.
---
My ideas for this:  
---
   1) Call it Whitesprings Resort
---
   2) Implement it before people complain about it.  
---
Whitesprings is centralized and oh no someone blewedid up my camp after the worlds leaders ended the world as we knew it with nuclear weapons
---
Have you tried validating the files? It is an option on PC but not sure about PS4
---
Check your internet connection. If you are dropping connection it will kick you out
---
Nope, PC. 
---
Dang it.  Thanks for the info.  Hopefully they offer it again soon.
---
The Morgantown High-school is an amazing place for plastic. Last run I did I came out with 117 plastic in about 5 minutes.
---
Hopefully it shows up again.  I'd also be interested in that enclave power armor if it ever shows.
---
TSE gatling, 195 damage, 500 rounds in the clip, will last the full fight without breaking, cheap ammo to craft. With Stabilized perks I can hit Queen at her spawn from dropsite v9.
---
"Most melee" don't hit for over 1000.
---
I'm not sure how to do that tbh, but will have a look into it thanks. Connection is steady, can play other online games with no issues, so would be surprised if it is that... Will try a reset of the router again and checking my connection again. 
---
Thanks!! 
---
Hey don‚Äôt know if you found a solution and this is not a shit post, but I got stuck like you and out of frustration I shot her and she went red for a second and then back to yellow and gave me the quest
---
How about a 3 star item from a 3 star bad guy?
---
My girlfriend has the same issue with our bluetooth speaker, if it's not turned on and configured **before** launching the game the audio does not work or it cuts off after a while / loading screen, I am unsure if it is an issue with the OS (Win10) or the game itself, since we had the same issue during the Anthem beta.
---
I don‚Äôt even bother with lock picking anymore not worth switching out the perks
---
The thing is that normal wood armor can atleast be scrapped for wood.
---
Uninstalling from there will often open the programs own uninstaller so it can properly remove all files it may have scattered around
---
LOL
---
Not really judging the game just saying I had a bad experience and can understand why some people hate the game I for one love it along with all the other Fallout games. It just sucks when people that are three times your level and their Noob buddy gang up on you just so they can take your junk in my case two hours of farming to get much needed adhesive and it's gone in a instant.
---
There is also a new dupe method that everyone is just starting to learn that involves crafting until the server disconnect's.
---
Please explain 
---
you're sitting around posting on the FO76 acting like Hamlet. Of course you'll be back.
---
Enjoying it is what the game is all about, have fun!
---
Finally uninstalled it after leaving it sitting on my PS4 for two weeks untouched. Need the space for something I'll actually enjoy.
---
I've seen this sort of thing happen... however, I've also sat staring at the lootless legendary corpse , looking away for a moment and looking back only to see the legendary loot to appear before my eyes. I just figured that it was the weed, but you know Bethesda.
---
Nice, I prefer the medical googles and surgical mask with it though.
---
You are now being patronizing and shaming a person mostly because you think they must have their brain directly connected to the game, but the truth is that you must have been extremely ineffective. Extremely. I play just the amount of time you have described, I am not using any experience related perks nor bobbleheads, I am pretty much ignoring the experience since 2019 started, I never used a single exp bug, and mostly building glitched spaceship looking camps, and I am 210. I was 140 within first two-three weeks of playing a damned roleplay pistolero character. I farmed 140-160 in a single day, and it was not a day spent completely before the computer. What is sad is how easy you come to conclusion that its okay to insult people because they are less ineffective than you are.
---
Brilliant! Nice to know everyone else is enjoying the game haha! 
---
I agree on the chems, the only one generally worth making in large batches is the RadAway. The rest are too expensive.
---
I think that's just a glitch 
---
Will keep a better watch out next time as far as the game goes I'm good I'm a Fallout junkie. It did ruin my day though. I will be setting the passive option in my settings I didn't even know such a thing existed.
---
 thanks will try that I didn't knowI could do this, 
---
Fair point 
---
Yeah, I tried on some glasses and found that I liked the [welding goggles](https://imgur.com/a/i1MNWZL) the best :)
---
But then it is really easy to repair
---
 thing isI wasent trying to team up I was wanting to sell my junk and keep the adhesive that I so badly needed two hours of farming down the drain. And like you I have meet some some really great people but there's always flung to be the turd buckets that screw up things.
---
Why am I still clicking on post like this? I have fun. That's why I'm still here.
---
uh... what in the hell were you trying to say? because I have no clue.
---
I have played the game for a couple of hours and then, because it was so depressing reloaded FO4 for another play through. Having recordings from long dead people is really not that exciting and the only living things in the game just want to kill you. When it gets a follower/NPC's I will try it again but not until then. ESO is a much happier game.
---
While my method is not 100% it is the most effective that I have found. If you find a better method please share.
---
If the legendary runs away then it will not drop legendary loot.
---
Some times I can 1 shot a legendary and so get loot, some times I can 1 shot a non-legendary and get a legendary drop.
---
I get weapons all the time. My only complaint is why the he‚Äôll anyone would want a junkies rolling pin
---
No one only gets 30 hours out of a game they enjoy.
---
The loot isn't any less shit than the loot other 3* 50 legendaries drop, and if there are loads of high lvl players you're being kind of stupid for not going there because for me it's usually max 1min until it's dead, and maybe 5k exp from all the enemies you farm while everybody focuses on the queen.
---
I can literally just kill mobs and vendor their drops. Takes around 20min to get to all the vendors, including the killing of the mobs. 
---
Speaking of diseases, I'm pretty sure it uses the same mechanic as mutations. That is there's a cooldown on being able to catch a disease unless you server hop.
---
Pretty much every time I start a session I get a disease near instantly from the first "Diseased" enemy I encounter regardless of disease resists. After that I won't catch a disease again for 30-60 minutes afterwards.
---
It was actually fixed but got reintroduced in the last patch due to the rollback 
---
But...
---
*now hyperventilating*
---
Also, 'nothing to do with health Regen' is strong statement that have not proven
---
Here we go again, give me 80$ for atoms i got by playing.
---
&gt; I also think people are wrongly assuming it's a server problem
---
It's obviously not a server hardware problem -- AWS handles all that, and if a physical server is having problems can migrate the virtual server to another host.
---
When people say "server problem" they mean that the server side part of the game software has crashed.
---
Shamed? LOL. I‚Äôve got 380 hours in and I am ashamed. I could have written a novel or gotten buff or learned Spanish. But no, I stuck my ass to the couch. I am deeply ashamed, and so should be anyone who wastes that much life doing dumb shit.
---
This.  Over 1000 hours on Skyrim here between xbox360 and ps3.  One of the best games I ever played, even did an rp playthrough as a random stealth archer npc who had no clue they were the dragonborn on master difficulty.
---
Seriously though, some glitches in FO4 I recognized from Skyrim.  I recognize Skyrim elements in this game, especially the plant life.
---
One more content, as I run a bloodied melee build I find that getting a legendary drop is highly dependent on my weapon selection, the trend seems to be that anything too op will lead to non legendary drop.
---
I appreciate you comment but do not think that it adds much to the discussion
---
Thanks for this, and for posting what you ended up getting. I've been running Watoga for Legendaries and it's become pretty disheartening. Will try your loop tonight :).
---
If that was the case everyone would be kicked out at the same time. It's a common issue with online games, even more so when the game was a being run on thousands of virtual servers.
---
Queens (of both species, mirelurk and scorched) need a 90% chance to drop 2 or 3 2* or 3* legendaries considering how flippin hard it is to kill them.
---
They don‚Äôt need to nerf anything.  All builds have their pros and cons.  Bloodied builds run around with enough HP to die to a stray fart.  I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a good trade off for high damage output.
---
My claim was 'agro and health Regen' 
---
Here we go again, putting words in people's mouths.
---
"I got nothin to contribute but I'll assume this guy is whining and make a whiny comment about it." Really dude? I don't want $80 of atoms, I want good shit to spend it on. There's nothing in the store to really customize your character with. Camo paint is average at best and it's the only "decent" one.
---
But hey, keep whining about a sore spot you clearly have.
---
You do know that the servers are AWS, right?
---
If there are problems on the server side then it's with the code, not with the hardware.
---
This would make the game so much better players could sell unwanted items or purchase that special item they have been farming for with out luck. Players wouldn't have to worry about being killed while trying to sell their items to vendors and speaking of vendors you could increase their gold amount per 24 hour period. This could also be a place for Factions to have daily quests with special rewards for crafting weapons or armor etc.... use your Imagination. I would recommend checking out World of Warcraft and how they have these areas set up they work great and I think their system would work great in this situation.
---
Of those games mentioned I want like 3.
---
Of those 3, 2 of them release in the next 2 months. Which likely means in May we will be looking for another game to play preferably co op.
---
&gt; Certain quests require you to hit the check points in a single session or else you need to start them from scratch
---
If you're talking about Belly of the Beast, then no,  you can start the quest at any transponder, you don't need to start from the beginning.  The only transponder you *need* for the quest is the last one, next to Taggerdy's body.
---
He did say sell my car and buy it for 2,000.
---
The claim was "agro and health Regen" 
---
I also loved new vegas
---
I liked the one where you went to ghoul land or something
---
this is why being funny when attempting humor helps 
---
Doesn't work if your wanted
---
I've decided if I ever make an MMO everyone in the beginning is gonna get such awesome progress simply by design with a warning, after the first year drop rates for awesome, awesomer, and awesomest stuff will be drastically reduced, that way veteran players can have crazy fun and an advantage from anyone else coming in late.  And just to reward those latecomers, holidays will have events with those drop rates restored.
---
It's *not hard* making something fun and replayable.  The '*grind*' and '*progress*' shouldn't get in the way of that, they should be a part of it.
---
Rdr2 has great story and nothing else imo.
---
The side activities got boring. Online is awful, worse than fo76 at release. Graphics and sounds are good and single player wasn't super buggy but still had issues.
---
But yea I put 2 or 3 times more hours in fallout 76 before getting bored.
---
Still have hope they get online to a playable state though but they are months off since there is nothing to do in rdr2 online 
---
I'd wait for player vending and then list it for 500 caps. It might sell eventually.
---
They need to balance something. The legendary affix's are in no way balanced. 
---
I totally agree.
---
There is no other game like F76, this is a truly unique experience. Both artistic team and world design team did a tremendous job.   
---
Besides, I don't understand how quick modders can be  to fix simple stuff, and how slow bethesda is.   
---
This make no sense at all, unless they already dropped everything and just stand there hoping for some last sells...  
---
Not sure why everyone says it won't spawn if your camp is there, but it did for me.

&gt; If that was the case everyone would be kicked out at the same time.
---
Which is what people are complaining about.  "Everybody" being the up to 24 people on the same server instance.
---
there's a holotape next to a skeleton in the basement.

spoiler: nothing is coming

I‚Äôm a stealth sniper. All hail the wood!!! 
---
The question is why are YOU still here?
---
8 free stimpacks a day.
---
No.
---
Does flux spoil while you are away from the game?  Collected some, had to log out, does the timer pause it will the be expired by the time I log back on hours maybe days from now? 
---
You found the portal out of the simulation. You need to gather every person on the server there to access the real game not broken game. Good luck.
---
What does this mean?
---
The crafting for fuel needs to be like for the 50 cal. Ammos like 180 per craft.
---
I used to do this until one didn't have pacifist one and lost me my queen-junk.
---
Wow is all I can say I really enjoyed reading it and the art work is spectacular. I hope you keep these up maybe start a new play through and do a new journal for us.
---
It took you 300 levels to realize this?
---
Few rhinos
---
Could me your ISP at fault. They could be dropping packets to and from the game servers. 
---
Don't overclock your rig.  The game doesn't like it much. 
---
Disable processor speed step. This can be done via the power options and setting it to max performance. The changing of the clock speed of the cpu seems to affect it.
---
Have trouble getting someone to even pick up items from a bag. So Very good luck! 
---
Also do not fear the ban. It will free you from the simulation.
---
Works for every terminal but the one I'm trying to use.
---
Exactly, at 9-12 is impossible to have fun with. It ends in like a second
---
Flare gun! Haha
---
No seriously, they need to get their heads outta their arses.  QoL changes like simply balancing energy weapons can be done in a day, it's been *months*.  Their server issues should be fixed immediately, not *in the future*.  If it's hardware issues from rented servers, bloody git rid of those servers for better ones, if it's the game itself, then why tf you released an online only game with code that'll cause server crashes and disconnects?
---
There's a fix for all of this, they're just looking for the cheapest way which ironically is costing them so much.  So so much.  Stop adding stuff to the atomic shop on the current schedule, it looks very very bad, further if you want a decent atom shop put everything that was time sensitive back up, I know like 5 people who would buy the red and black PA paint job with actual money.
---
The entire execution of this game has basically executed this game before it could be further developed to stand on its own feet.  It's incredibly a learning lesson, from Watoga's incompetent automization to the Corporate Government conspiracy of Huntersville to Vault-Tec's social experiments, this game practically speaks of Bethesda's corporate situation.  Unable to make a game from scratch they copy-paste graphical and code IP, hype it up to be something it isn't, outright lie about it, then throw it out there and disappear to hide out the controversy.
---
Like, we get it, you're a corrupt inept greedy business, can you like, pull your head out of your arse for two minutes to see the actual state of your own product you destroyed in a quick bid for reputation and profit?  Had this game been given a year it would've been so much better, instead now we're all, consumers and developers, stuck with this 7 Days to Die blunder:
---
"Hey A, whatcha doin?"
---
"Jus tryin to fix dis 'er server disconnect issue, B."
---
"Ay, ey, A, dun'cha tink we should be working on QoL tweaks too?"
---
"QoL?  Q.  O.  L?!!  I'll have you know B, we aren't just some willy pushover sods, we're developers!  We don't *bow* to antagonism we don't-- ^ohhnoo the server crashed again.  I should really get this figured out B."
---
"Ookieedookiee, I'll jus be over here, tinking about how I'm supposed ta fix tis 'er infinite load screen and infinite loot loading, y'know, instead o' actually doin anyting, cause I have no bloody idear how to fix et."
---
"Me too, B!  Me, tooooo."
---
Can you explain what you mean by that last sentence
---
Perfect weapon for destroying the whitespring golf club bases. Just drag the ghouls out to the base and spam the shit out of the horde with that üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Do you all like to scrap weapons or sell them? When you get a perk from scrapping it's only for that specific weapon type right?
---
Most recent kingdom hearts was only about 40 hours doing everything that could be done except maybe the photo ops missions.
---
Depends on how good their HR is at taking down posts. Where I work some listing sit out on the line for months after the position is filled. 
---
/r/ihadastroke 
---
Woah. Great job! 
---
Thanks mate, seriously dont get it. Nothing offensive was ment, yet we are getting slaughtered by downvotes.
---
Like the phrase Negative Nancy's. Will use it now.
---
Decent artist team*
---
I feel ya, make sure you pull up the loot menu when you loot cause sometimes nothing will show up when you just look at the small dropdown menu. And you‚Äôre right if you‚Äôre below lvl 50 don‚Äôt expect to get dick from legendary drops
---
Are you suggesting that being asked to log in to your own account is somehow an evil deterrent put there on purpose by bethesda? This is getting ridiculous.
---
Yup, ur bannt
---
I guess I was lucky, but I'm 50% on SBQ takedowns as far as 3-star handy rifles go. It doesn't have TS or E, but at least it was a slight upgrade...
---
And then something else will be more powerful and everyone will call for that to be nerfed too. Soon everything will be nerfed and all weapons will do 1 damage...  where does it end
---
Sounds like a game glitch because I crafted a set of excavator for a guy and then took him there to get plans and register the armour he had no issues. 
---
Really?  I get 1* weapons more than I get the best loot in the game.  
---
This is why the Somerset rocks and why non melee folks enjoy the blade of bastet.
---
I run armor piercing all the time after picking up an anti armor assault rifle and using it in a non spec character and it killed faster than the usual. AA/explosive has been what I've been hunting for.
---
The claim was "agro AND health regen" which you have conveniently ignored and not tested. 
---
Yes, it is possible to 1-shot a legendary (or non-legendaries) for a legendary drop, but certainly, not 100% and I have found it to be less effective the higher my level gets. As a bloodied melee player, I find that the more damage that my toon can deal, the less legendary drops I get (certainly not 100%, but def a trend). 
---
My apologies for the many replies (I am cleaning them up with this one) but please read the claim more carefully before making your own bogus claims.
---
&gt;$18 for a single skin for a specific set of armor man
---
I think people comparing atoms to dollars are stupid. That's all.
---
For some fucking stupid reason this is how it's sposed to work, it's the most fucking annoying thing in the game. After last patch it reverted back to not scraping and ppl were crying a out it so they changed it in a hotfix. WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU WANT TO AUTO SCRAP JUNK
---
I've come accross a lot of stuff like this, I imagine its just a part of the game they didn't have time to finish and may add it in a future update
---
My entertainment and relaxation are investments, not waste. I do these things because I believe I function better as part of society because I am doing these things. I catalize all my aggression wherr its harmless, which makes it easier not to show it to people. The very idea of killing pixels is worthy of a peace Nobel prize. If you are ashamed of how you spend your time, this is your problem, judging people around by your own self-loathing is an ugly thing to do.
---
I have a two shot gauss rifle and an anti-armor, the ts does more base damage but sometimes the aa feels stronger. I don't know witch one to use.. they both have vats crit. And I'm a vats crit rifleman build
---
Obviously I knew it from the beginning, just wanted to reiterate the point hoping that Bethesda solves this.  
---
This is a big problem for both attackers and those attacked, an high level it's a walking sack of caps.  
---
They have to change this mechanic.  
---
Very nice just started reading will definitely finish thanks
---
And by 7 Days to Die blunder I do mean this exact loop of development:
---
Make part of a game, release it bugs and all, add stuff to game that introduces more bugs, patch other bugs that cause even more new bugs, make another part of the game, release that 'addition' bugs and all.  Add stuff to that part of the game that introduces more bugs, patch other bugs that causes even more new bugs, make another part of the game and release that addition bugs and all.
---
It used to go, make the whole damn bloody game, polish and debug, release, patch anything missed that's reported, begin releasing additional content aka Dlc and patches for any new issues that crop up.
---
If this is the new norm going forward, the 7 Days to Die model of releasing incomplete games and updating them partly part way drastically vastly increasing the time it'd take to just finish making the game, and exposing *paying consumers* to endless bugs that destroy their experience, then RIP gaming industry.
---
Let's hope bethesda'd behavior around FO76 and the stupid blokes that made 7dtd become distant fading blotches on the entertainment industry that is video games, fuck your 'video games as a service' cash grab bollocks, gtfo and make space for actual artwork and not trash.  Please, just please, get a bloody clue, we shouldn't have to tell you when you're making a horrendous mistake in the name of money.
---
You're not Dutch Van Der Linde out of RDR2, *SO STOP ACTING LIKE IT*, you don't need one more month, you don't need more money, you need to deliver what you promised, then all the time and money will come flowing in like that, voila.
---
(I'm sorry for shaking my salt container, but I've literally just sat through an infinite load screen typing all of this up and it fueled my sodium output.)
---
Yep that started after the last big FIX.
---
  Good news mods don't get auto scraped for steel while crafting anymore. 
---
good work. Take an upvote
---
Because from my experience you ‚Äúpvp‚Äù people are usually just douche bags who deserve to lose all your caps? Thought this was known
---
If some of these players are one-shotting legendaries and not allowing other players to get a hit in, just sit back from the cloud and heal the ghouls... it‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Does aa stack with tank killer? And mags?
---
empath...
---
How many run bloodied without need rage and serendipity or whatever the other massive damage reduce below x health? That glass is tempered, wire reinforced aquarium grade safety glass.
---
And alpha is king. Best defense is things being dead.
---
I see I am being downvoted for stating the obvious: that shaming people based on premises taken out of own ignorance is a stupid thing to do.
---
I do believe that people downvoting this are noobs in game and suckers in real life. Level 140 after three months of daily intensive, exp-focused gaming is an obvious example of noobishness, and thinking that people life must be sad if they have a bigger level is such a childish fallacy that anybody who believes that must grow up and stop being such a dumb person.
---
I don't bulk junk items worth only 40 caps.  I instead bulk items worth 70+ when bulked.
---
I had the same issue yesterday it didnt matter what type of legendary I found and killed the loot they dropped was garbage. 2 or 3 caps and the lead or aluminium. Oh and they were lvl 50, the best was a a lvl 50 glowing ML Queen. 
---
I'd give her a poke if the telly was broke
---
IDK I've only done one.
---
Keep telling yourself that. At least I‚Äôm being honest. Honestly, if you‚Äôve spent 300+ hours since launch, you are barely functioning in society.
---
I'm reminded of battlefield 1 where equipping Nino's or a gas mask did like 1 damage and had a range of 0. So if you were laying down inside someone's hitbox and whipped out Nino's you'd do damage. 
---
You know, it actually is hard. If it was so easy then every mmo would be fun. 
---
Yeah something about that last update just ruined the game for me. I've been playing since day one.
---
I‚Äôve got a question. For the previous major mmos, how long did they take before they released new pve content? Like for ESO or old republic? Geniunely curious
---
Totally agree
---
Yeah i am level 197now, and no way to i would attack something under level 100 without knowing i kill it. Like wtf you can get 50 caps or lose 200. Gg. If you want to do this, get bounty, then you lose only 10caps lol.
---
Was that an unintentional rhyme or did you just refer to her as a telly?  Wait, is this a sex joke?  Why only if it's broke?
---
*What is happening??*
---
I hope they are tracking the numbers.
---
No.  People were angry that they weren't auto consumed when crafting/repairing.  Not that they weren't automatically scrapped with "Scrap All Junk".
---
This is not something people cried that they wanted.  It's a bug introduced by the hotfix after the removal of the mods auto scraping during repair/crafting.
---
Update made it so Mods would not automatically be consumed when crafting/repairing.
---
In the process of doing so, Bulk Items no longer worked with crafting / repairing.  This is what people hated.  Prior to the mod update, bulk items did not auto scrap with "Scrap All Junk" but were still consumed when crafting and repairing.
---
The hotfix to make it so bulk items were consumed when Crafting / Repairing introduced the current bug of all Bulk items being consumed with "Scrap All Junk".
---
They just haven't fixed this new bug.
---
I find them pretty regularly in First Aid kits all over.
---
I've had this happen yesterday, but from 2 to 3. I only have the first 2 cards as i'm only level 27. Same thing with the Hacker cards. I had a glitch where i accidentally tried to hack a terminal beyond my skill and instead of telling me that i can't, it just showed me a blank terminal screen and i couldn't do anything anymore. Since that i got 3 skill points both on Lockpick and Hacker. I hope i won't get banned or anything. 
---
I legit would love a legendary binoculars that have recon scope capability (marks targets while binoculars are equipped), and has a stabilized status (no more swaying around like you're drunk), would legit pay 500 caps for a pair of Recon Stabilized Binoculars.
---
You missed her transformation, after she despawns, you're supposed to look for her red meat pile on the red soil, that's her final mode of attack. 
---
At Whitesprings Station I pick up every single vase, bottle and glass in the place and sell it back to the poor sap of a vendor.
---
Or Intelligence, either or.
---
Why? How can you not?
---
Remember fellas, while it is possible to sometimes not get loot from legendaries, sometimes the server just needs to update. After a kill where no legendary is given. Check the corpse for maybe a minute or two after. Don‚Äôt constantly stare at it either. 
---
And if you own workshop, someone can claim it and his teammates can instantly kill you wherever you are on map. And if that one guy claiming workshop interupt it by leaving green circle, he can trigger pvp with you infinite times this way. So yeah you are waling sack of caps.
---
Count me out on all future Bethesda launches, or any purchase of a Fallout game.
---
I paid full price at launch for PC physical media.  Got a paper disc with a code that I can't resell.  Bethesda, you suck.  I played it for less time than the Gigabit internet connection took to download it.
---
Sunk cost theory - why waste/spend more time in the game just because I already lost $60 on it?
---
I canceled my Doom Eternal pre order.  The next time I get a Bethesda game will be at 75% off.
---
What they did to the caps stashes ruined it for me. Because how I chose to spend my time and enjoy myself was such a big problem. Because every time I try to do anything else some crash or disconnect or freeze or black screen or infinite load screen would mess it all up. So I find some enjoyment doing something else, between the tedious server hopping for plans at vendors and Whitespring leveling. But farming caps stashes was such a big deal, it really needed "fixed" before everything else.
---
Very cool stuff, but looks like a massive copyright infringement. 
---
Okay. 
---
All this is telling me is Bethesda is still invested in this game and is not abandoning it (contrary to all those ‚Äúsky is falling‚Äù folks in other threads). Now whether it takes these new hires 30 or 90 days to get up to speed, i don‚Äôt care as long as improvements and new content are coming. I already bought the game, there‚Äôs nothing else left for me to do. 
---
I'll take a hookah.
---
I thought Eso Had a whole different team working on it.
---
Although you get a lot of loot from ghouls at Whitesprings, its almost all Junk, the best stuff I have got is mostly from Super Mutants and scorched. Again, your experience my vary. RNG is a fickle mistress. 
---
I crafted a handmade with a perforating mag on my main character and moved it to the rifle character I am leveling, currently level 20, that thing is obscene for a non-legendary. Forget farming whitesprings, I have that character farming Watoga solo to level.
---
I think I speak for many or all here when I say... we want spoilers **and** unexpected plot twists, like "the game is still being worked on..." or "no, we haven't fired/moved all the devs" or "yes, we're going to align the atom shop with what people actually want".
---
I see that you think that you are in position to judge my personal life based on the premises that you took out of your own ass as to what people live should look like.
---
If I told you that my favorite thing to do is to play online Fallout, while I am in top5% earners in my country and I just can spend lots of time playing because I am not forced to feed capitalist machine with my blood and my soul to guarantee own survival, you'd probably deny such possibility,  because, obviously, the very idea of living a life that is different from yours must be inferior.
---
Honestly, your opinion about my person is worthless, and considering how easy it is for such brat to judge people, your opinion on anything is worthless too.
---
From a technical standpoint, the initial BETA was a disaster as the servers had terrible connection issues, infinite loading screens and other game-breaking bugs. Your levels of enjoyment are subjective.
---
My point is, they have a roadmap and are engaged with the community when it comes to fixing it. 
---
Damn.  Moment of silence for you my friend.
---
Because i got atoms by playing? I do not remember anyone giving me dollars for playing this game. Atoms are free for doing challenges, you can give bethesda some moneys so they will continue on fixing game and also they will give you some atoms, but atoms=/=dollars.
---
"There is only Todd in bethesa."
---
thanks for sharing.
---
I think they need to turn WS back into what it was in November. At least it was fun grinding ghouls for the xp back then.
---
That‚Äôs true, but for me, with two kids, wife and full time job, it makes buying say, a power armour paint job, literally impossible in the time it would take to accrue them, I would HAVE to buy. The amount you need in atoms is ridiculously ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù for what you get also.
---
Doesn't ESO have a whole different team working on it?
---
If you have master hacker and robotics expert maxed out its easy af
---
If you do not find them before then, I will sell you the plan for 800C. It would be around 6pm eastern standard time before I would be on.
---
Killed a 3 star legendary deathclaw near the WS Golf Club yesterday after farming ghouls and when I went to check out the loot the damn thing disappeared. This has happened fairly often lately and it doesn‚Äôt appear Bethesda cares. 
---
I actually don‚Äôt mind the daily grind but to not be rewarded just flat out sucks.  Do something about it!!! 
---
90% West Tek? No way. Not for me.
---
I read this before here and went ther for a while. Maybe one legendary every 4 or 5 visits. 
---
Every patch I hoped "we can only go up from here!... r-right?" But aside from a handful of QoL additions we only got more bugs and instability.
---
If this game worked properly I'd be playing it every day, hell... I already got 300 hours in it, but it's been at 300 for a few weeks now and I have a feeling its gonna stay at 300 for a few months.
---
I've come around from "They are just being toxic like all the other game subreddits". While I wasn't wrong, they weren't wrong either. Love Bethesda, or I did? But I can't with 76 anymore. Not unless they do something drastic, but I don't see that happening. 
---
It's a shame i have an explosive one but for this reason i can't use it
---
The loot pisses me off, then there's the officer on deck mission. I'm not sure what satellite they're working with but if you take out more than one starred legendary at a time, the damned thing only registers one. I had a one and two star legendary feral ghoul run up on me, I got one step on the mission and a mutant slayers pool cue out of it. 
---
Well, what would we do anyways with a TSE everytime, they are pretty much worthless now. You should see my 50 cal... I am better using a wooden board without any melee perks.
---
&gt;its gotta be intentional on there part
---
Of course it's intentional. Any one that wanted players to enjoy drops would have given tiered percent chance at loot. These monsters gave them ***even*** chances to drop.
---
So for armor it'd be:
---
- Tier 4 60ish percent
---
- Tier 3 30ish percent
---
- Tier 2 8ish percent
---
- Tier 1 2ish percent
---
It‚Äôs simple ‚Äî make 3 star legendaries a bit rather than they are now, and make them guaranteed to drop a 3 star.  
---
Not a list but I personally have tamed two deathclaw and a sloth. 
---
But... 500 atoms = 5 USD. Independently from acquiring them in-game or not, they still have value equivalent to real world money. 
---
Anyway my beef isn't with acquisition, there's a steady ingress even just through playing each month. My main point is that there's lack of options both free and paid for. Why can't we have a generic 10 color palette? Why can't I walk around in full white PA? Maybe even full purple. If they're going to price it then fine- but don't eye-gouge. Specially not when this game is $60 USD. The only way an $18 skin is worth it imo is when they have unique models, sounds, effects and looks damn good. None of the paints do that in FO76.
---
People need to stop defending outrageous prices just for keeping servers online in a AAA $60 title. GGG, developers for the f2p game Path of Exile have said that even if they shut down, they could afford to keep servers up and they have around 40-50k players online at peak times accross PC and Xbox.
---
Yeah I was farming Whitesprings and then I saw a Legendary glowing one. Killed it to get a Legendary walking cane
---
How does this work? I'm new to legendary hunting - is there a defined route at each location to encounter the best enemies?
---
One the main things for me was that junk doesn't respawn anymore, not even in containers.
---
You‚Äôre only banned if you go about 30 feet east and type in the programming code written on the other purple rock. ;)
---
I found a pile on the floor of the church in helvetia. Middle of it, between the pews. :) 
---
Of course, if someone wants to do PvP on an half PvP game, must be a douche bag.
---
Look at it this way, an high level doing PvP will lose a lot of caps, but an innocent high level workshop owner will lose even more caps when he will be killed repeatedly.
---
&gt;90% West Tek? No way. Not for me.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I read this before here and went ther for a while. Maybe one legendary every 4 or 5 visits.
---
Of the 20 times, 18 times there was at least 1 and up to 3 legendaries at West Tek. Typically inside, sometimes outside or round the back.  I don't know what to tell you other than 20 times is no way enough data to give an accurate figures, its just what I observed. (flips a coin, heads again!) 
---
To punish you for grinding to level 300.
---
Daily challenges man, If you don't count level up, which is hardcore at high levels, rest of other challenges are doable in 30minutes. There are things like kill 5radroaches, collect bobblehead, read magazine, scrap 20concrete, ....   You need to put some effort to get cosmetic. Or there is T-51b nuka cola paintjob and T-60 Bos painjob ingame. 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a fair point, it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt do enough of, might have to look into them more!
---
The few I've played were fun, this game IS fun, *sometimes*.  Even Monster Hunter which relies on RNG is fun to grind despite basically the exact same gameplay loop.
---
The only real crutch to this game are the bugs and very broken balance designs.  I'm willing to bet if they up'd the loot tables to give us all great legendary gear, then in the future once the bugs and balancing are fixed reduced the loot tables to as they are now but gave the sbq crazy good loot tables, you'd see this game lasting for a decade easy.
---
It is easy, what's hard is making money out of it, but they already have a cosmetic shop which brings in money fairy well **if** it has good items that are decently priced.
---
You know how you really earn money with a $60 launch though?  You don't release an unfinished game.  Were this game properly polished it'd most definitely still be $60 and still selling.  Instead between the game itself, and it's promo stuff, and the company's various blunders in security, develop, communication, and production, AND sales, just holy shit.  Talk about wasted potential and a huge loss in profit.
---
FallOut online was never about shinies and trinkets, you are playing the wroooooong game, this is not the world of wooooow, go play the game the right way or get out. Take all the rest of loot whiners with you as well, please.
---
&gt; $18 skin 
---
Oh my god.
---
If you can't understand why  it is so hard to do recolour on this engine, you probably never did mod for any TES/FO game.
---
There‚Äôs just no end to these posts, is there?
---
I was going to say I've been having the same disconnects, but now this makes sense.  Also noticed the server performance is worse than it's ever been.  Inbreds duping would explain both though.
---
The lack of basic research/Google Searches from topic posters on this board is astounding.. different teams altogether. Stop adding to the troll toll
---
Hey! I'll try. 
---
1. White Springs - Lots of different ways, I start at the Clubhouse then clockwise through the chalets, once I have done the 2nd big house/chalet I cut across east to the Carpark, through the maintenance building and work back to the Clubhouse. I miss the golf course and few chalets doing it this way. 
---
2. West Tek - Just explore the building (depending on level this place can be hard)
---
3. Sugar Grove - Straight the front door, its pretty much 1 route.
---
4. Harpers Ferry  - Starting at the bridge I work counter clockwise around the town cutting back to the church and then through the town ending back at the bridge.
---
5. Generals Steak House  - 1 building to search.
---
6. Watago - Fast travel to the Vendor bot, round the corner there is 5 or 6 bots with a chance of legends, I don't scour the rest of Watago. 
---
7. NRA Repair Yard - (Usually Skip after the first one after checking for plans) Small area.
---
8. Appalachian Antiques 10% Small building.
---
The amount of times I've killed a 2 or 3 Star and they just do a magic trick on me.....hey presto! I'm invisible! Search all you want, I'm gone!
---
Killed a 2 star level 91 savage (?) deathclaw. Got a berserker‚Äôs pipe wrench, 1 star.
---
That is amazing I‚Äôm going to have to print it
---
Yes, as soon as they bring private servers where you can keep out the low IQ, basement dwelling dupers.
---
So the Explosive Flamers are now limited items? Since they stopped spawning with explosive mod?
---
Wrong sub
---
WOW!
---
Impressive stuff.
---
You are a true artist!

Are you using a targeting hud?

That getting stuck in a Terminal happend to me Yesterday to when i tried to launch a nuke really pissed me off

Yes, we need those BOS plans and mods!

Try the train car west of Watoga station, the rail yard a little further east, or the rail yard west of the station. 
---
If half the game was viewed as pvp on a wide scale it wouldn‚Äôt be getting its own game mode. Fact of the matter is usually, and again I use that word usually for people who slip in the cracks, people want to be just left alone to do their thing. People who primarily ‚Äúpvp‚Äù  are usually just griefing, stealing items they don‚Äôt need in a game they are truly bored of. Your time is coming bud, but the general consensus on pvp is just that. Griefing douches who aren‚Äôt even killing for material, but just to be dicks.
---
This and the loot spinning wheel of death are why I'm playing something else 90% of the time now.  I really like this game but it's gotten worse instead of better.  
---
My character runs around with 54 hp.   They both one-shot and get one-shotted.  
---
I have a TSE. Now I'm not complaining, just stating facts. It went from 434 damage to 130 damage in a day. From the best weapon to the worst! I only use it when my explosive lever has broken, and that only does 206 with full perks for rifleman and explosives. Just facts, the game is what it is. It's harder, but if it was too easy, I'd be finished sooner, and at the end of the day, that's why the changes were implemented.
---
You can build it, but if the camp owner ever places it into storage, it can‚Äôt be re-placed. It‚Äôs the same as any other unknown plan item. 
---
Why does "Junkies" even exist...
---
There's a non broken version of the game? üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ
---
Atom shop items CAN be placed in a friend's camp, but they cannot be placed again by the player if the camp is rebuilt.
---
Just to add, this morning I did Whitesprings twice and got nothing either time. I'd go as far to say that doing the 20 runs was almost worthless from a statistical point of view and the important information, imho, is that if you find a good server with plenty of spawns stick with it. 
---
Yeah I put a lot of time into bdo but don't think I passed level 55. Just spent a lot of time sailing and fishing.
---
Also echoing melee and strength perk. Also increase your intelligence and don't build your camp at the Whitespring Resort. It gets nuked a lot.
---
Yes
---
Red dead 1 and 2.  Gta 3 through 5.  That's just Rockstar.
---
Assassins creed series, Prince of Persia series
---
Dying Light.
---
Legend of Zelda series.  Mario series.  Pokemon series.
---
Final Fantasy series.
---
Gotcha Force on Gamecube (that was a crazy fun grind)
---
Halo series.  Gears of War series.  Portal 2.  Half life series.
---
Civilization.  Dawn of War.  Roller Coaster Tycoon.
---
Come on, you mean to tell me you never got lost in any of these games?
---
What about Skyrim, or Fallout 3, NV, or 4?
---
Don't you ever explore the game beyond playing it?  I scoured Dying Light looting every building, every location, I explored every nook and cranny, found ways nearly out of the playable map, got to places I clearly wasn't expected or intended to get to, secrets hidden away, hell I jumped off the largest tower, and survived by landing on a car.
---
If you really enjoy the game you'll manage more than a little over a day's worth combined total playing it.
---
This is why people duped items
---
You‚Äôre not impressing me. I live in NYC and am in the top 10% of wage earners and yet only work 6 hrs a week. And yet I am not so delusional as to fully comprehend the extravagant waste of time that hundreds of hours on FO76 represents. I could have spent time in the Met, MoMA, the Guggenheim, the Whitney, Central Park, AMNH... the opera, the symphony, the ballet... I could have seen every single one of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays, read at least 30 books‚ÄîMoby Dick? Homer? Hesiod? Virgil? But I didn‚Äôt. I wasted my life being a zombie on a couch. Just. Like. You.
---
The riot gear from lonesome road is prewar and looks the same, so that would be lore friendly 
---
Fuck em all to death!
---
It's poor game design. If games like diablo have taught us anything, it's that continual loot drops that 'feel' good keep gamers playing for the dopamine hit. I don't get a dopamine hit from wood armour.
---
You‚Äôre missing the point. The power-time curve that describes your character‚Äôs power against time spent to acquire it is basically the same shape in most games. Mostly the numbers change, but the curve remains the same. 
---
In this game, the curve itself is broken for a variety of interrelated reasons, including unbalanced items, poor drop rates, bad character progression design, etc that have all been hashed out on this subreddit. 
---
But a lot of smart people really did put a lot of time into designing all of these systems. They really did, but they didn‚Äôt do it as well as they wanted to. 
---
My point is this: optimising that curve is an extremely challenging task. It requires the concerted effort of technical designers, designers, programmers, producers, and a team environment where they can iterate as long as necessary. If you think you can do that better, then please please please try to do it. We always need more people with vision and drive in the games business. 
---
Source for all this: I work in AAA games and know people with all those jobs. 
---
But I want them to know it was me, and then get nothing from killing me ... but more grief.
---
That's all that will fit on 2 foundations, and it needs to be easy to quickly place nearby.
---
Got some "hack" hatemail for those kills ahah.
---
What are the recommended modifications if you want to use one to tag as many enemies as possible?   In situations where there are many players I would like to get my one hit in while letting everyone else tag the enemy as well.
---
xbox - everyday for a min of 2 hours
---
There was also a time we churned butter at home, times change and the development and business landscape for games is completely different then it was  back then. 
---
I am hoping for the cross-play soon, on XBOX but have a PS4 then I will get it and due just that.
---
Yes you need three simultaneous nuke launches overlapping that spot, with every person on the server there when they fall. We were all just too dumb to realize it. The real game was hidden behind a social experiment simulation on how far people can be pushed before they break.
---
Thanks, now Step 1, time to find the slimy bastards.
---
What mechanics does fo76 have that other multiplayer games with similar size servers don't have?
---
Do you perhaps cure it with antibiotics? Those give 50% lower disease chance.
---
He said "why *should* I lose" not "why *did* I lose".  
---
He's aware why he lost it, he's just curious why they designed it that way - I agree, there should be a limit - perhaps 50 Caps since level 50 is the max level for the items. 
---
We need legendary binoculars to spot the legendary enemies that continue to run away and hide from us. Or mark lootable corpses. The other day, I chased a legendary deathclaw all over the bog, only to have it despawn on me the moment it died...
---
Ya, I always get them from my Screw-farming runs.  What are they for?  I just drop / sell them.
---
Yes, without VATS, Fallout 76 becomes just another generic survival shoot ‚Äòem up. 
---
We need VATS but we need it to actually work. 
---
I am sure, there is no other game with so many teddy bears with different skins all over map, that can fly away when you shot them and be at that place for long time. Most games have everything in containers, some have models for guns (borderlands), but then it is not as open world, but just small maps. My brain can even render so much things lol. 
---
/u/Ladydevann delaying the roadma doesn't instill confidence in players. Considering a large portion of these issues it being delayed for are still unresolved (player loot disappearing, friends system is flat broken lmao, Power Armor weight bug *still*, energy weapons are useless), the excuse that 'We're fixing issues' doesnt really hold water, ya feel me? 
---
Now, 3 months into release, we dont have any idea of where the game is headed. How is it that there has been time found to add more horseshit to the atom store like bedsheets, but not fix plasma rifles and **the main endgame boss not giving loot**
---
Prity sure but i have only seen it once though so dont get your hopes up
---
Bethesda gives no f*cks. I left this burning train wreck two weeks ago. I suggest everyone else does the same.
---
How about fixing daily missions so you can actually do them on a daily basis? How does something like this leave a beta?
---
Makes sense... That's actually less trouble than servers disconnecting, patches being restored to previous version and the worst of all, just so many little things that make you waste your time. However I'm still playing, so the experiment continues. 
---
Oh there is? I only have the animal one, I thought it would be fun to pacify a deathclaw (still working on that)
---
I just defeated my first queen since the patch(on ps4 is super rare now).
---
I didn't launch it and just joined a group of 4 or 5 high level players(i'm 185 myself).
---
We just completely destroied her.the timer was over 20 minutes when we were done.
---
I was shocked. 
---
Oh and the loot loaded instantly...an instant explosive vent lol.
---
If that is the case then the clock is ticking, as E3 is D-Day for them. This game is hanging over the entire studio like a a sword. If they shut it down then they can simply apologize etc. and try to move on without affecting sales of their upcoming games. Or they can walk out and try and paint over the large uncontrolled blaze while announcing updates or roadmap for the entire rest of the year.
---
Best outcome is they pull a Final Fantasy and shut it down for a year to work and redevelop said game. And not have Todd Howard do the presentation.
---
Interesting, that would explain why I often find nuked plants but hitting E on PC doesn't work, they have already been harvested. Thanks for this :)
---
Thanks for the solid description for Woopsies.  
---
I could use similar enemy/location information for any of Buzz Brain, Jelly Fingers, Lock Joint, Shell Shock and Swamp Gas.  
---
Also could use any tips on how to get Sludge Lung to register for the challenge and not bug out.  
---
I've tanked any number of diseased creatures but most seem to only give me Parasites or Glowing Pustules.  
---
Any help gratefully accepted.  
---
All melee and not just 7narmed. 
---
Just another remnant from fo4 that haunts this game. PA doesn't give you a bonus, it sets your strength to 11 (or is it 10?). If you had 15, you would lose 4 points of strength. It just doesn't work with fo76 15 points perk cap. 
---
It's such an obscure thing, I think the devs weren't even aware that it was implemented that way.
---
So, you lose the same caps according to your level? Then what would happen if a player reached level 25001? 
---
TOTAL IMPUNITY!! :P
---
Couldnt have titled a post better myself.
---
I got a 1* nocturnal pole hook from the queen. 
---
It wasnt the only reason, but Thats the moment when I decided to play something else, until they make it worth my time.
---
They need to invert whatever shit RNG values they have assigned in those loot tables.
---
Oh I already hear their reply: "we hear you, and we're working hard to see what we can do to address this in a future patch later next year"
---
I remember I hit 328 caps once recently, and without using a bobblehead. Those are glorious moments, sure, but you still lose more than that money if you buy a (non-legendary) weapon off a vendor for scrapping. :-/
---
Keep training and one day you will be lockpicking Vault Doors
---
Just flex your AirPods and leave
---
It‚Äôs just that the rest of us aren‚Äôt delusional. We know full well that we are wasting our lives playing dumb games. You got a problem with a little self knowledge? Lack of self awareness is way worse than a little old fashioned guilt and regret. Now, fuck off, it‚Äôs a holiday and I‚Äôm going to vegetate and play some Fallout on my PS4.
---
The OP wasn't talking about the classic *disconnected from server* issue, I get those all the time, the subject is about fast travel and an infinite loading screen. An overloaded Wi-Fi network could definitely be a cause of these kind of issues, which is why I mention Ethernet.
---
Rad worms
---
Demo exp. only adds 20 damage total though.. but yea it's pretty decent still.
---
Are you a stealth build?  Don't sneak when you try to talk to her, you won't get the option. 
---
I honestly don't because I wouldn't and have not in the past since I've got an extremely short temper and little to no patience between my hatred towards God and my being abused by my parents.  I've been diagnosed with mild psychosis, that's how bad I get because I'm *damaged*.
---
However, I try to get it, and as sickening as it is, we live in a monstrous world, that's *my truth*, so when I get treated like crap I just dip and run because fighting is what destroyed decency in life and I see no point to making your point with a fist when I can make mine with a gun and everyone loses.
---
At least with words ideas get exchanged rather than injuries.
---
I try to not give back what they give, but honestly the golden rule has gotten me hurt more than helped me, and at least the not-so golden rule (treat others like they treat you) has made people leave me alone, it's amazing how fast people dip out of having to deal with their own behavior.
---
Defuse and empathize, being sly helps too, makes you look charismatic and freakishly enough if you're charismatic enough people will like you even if you're a fricken monster.  Humanity is a joke, and I honestly don't know how I'll ever make it anywhere in life with how society is with it's judgmental attitude, double standard hypocrisy, and discriminatory behavior.  Pretty sure I'll die homeless and destitute considering my luck and situation.  You don't need to deal with any of that though.  A few asshats on the internet?  They don't need a response, just downvote and if you must respond, try to reiterate or elaborate what your point is.
---
Don't start a fight you don't want to see through, you know?  You wouldn't jump into a pit with 3 deathclaws surrounded by a bunch of onlookers unless you were prepared, would you?
---
Fuck trolls, the irrational part of me says they need their hands broken so they can't harass people through a screen, but the nice part of me says we all need tools to censor and block trolls.
---
I don't know, all I ever wanted in my life was a simple happy life, instead my dreams were squashed, my plans ruined, and my hopes dashed, I'm pretty much just trash now between the mental illness and my bad physical health.  I just wanted to help create and test games, instead I'm basically a manual labor slave.  I just wanted a family, instead I'm the black sheep for being born to my mother and no one wants anything to do with me because of her.  I just wanted friends, instead my 'friends' really just use me and if I didn't let them do so they wouldn't be my friends.
---
My point is, things don't go right.  Sometimes nothing goes right, but if you can hold yourself together, manage what I failed to do, and just continue to push for something better, things will usually seem a bit better and less frustrating.
---
Rose?  Fuck her, she's glitched?  Bollocks that metal bitch, can't wait to dismantle her for 3 scraps of lead, 2 steel, and 2 aluminum and maybe a biometric scanner.  *Hopefully* she'll be unglitched next time you log in, or hopefully as you progress in the game something will change and make her respond.  Whenever I run into progress halting bugs I do get crazy annoyed and even frustrated, especially if I'm in the zone on a roll.  Why don't you go see about doing some other quests or exploring other events meanwhile if you don't want to stop playing?  Rose...Sadly, isn't going anywhere, so give her time to get her shit straight?
---
The grind in this game is worse than Diablo. At least in Diablo you get rewards. 
---
The reason there's a limit is because of needing to limit the number of trackable items on a given server. Splitting that amount between different boxes doesn't avoid that. 
---
It doesn't matter where you access your stash box. It's the number of items over all that matters. 
---
Nah mirelurk queens aren't really that tough. They do a lot of damage if you don't have any poison resist, but they're not anything near the damage sponge SBQ is.
---
Just did 3 runs (while doing one run the enemies  outside respawned, so I did this area 4 times.)
---
Legendaries: ZERO. Zipp. Nada.
---
At one time I heard a no-star legendary running away (you know the type, the cowards). Couldn't find him anymore, must have died in a grenade blast and I didn't find the meat pile.
---
I was low on gunpowder, so it wasn't a total waste of time. 
---
But this is one of my biggest problems with the game: The dependency on luck. My recent character has 15, I as a player have 1. Maybe. I basically have to play this game semi-professional if I want any good plans or legendary gear. I'm hunting underarmor plans or Heavy combat armor plans for weeks now. I use pistols only, I don't find a legendary one. I have one good legendary armor piece on my level. And I'm a player who logs in every day. But every day a little bit shorter. 
---
I cannot.  I believe the cap pool is still 200 because I eventually get the ‚Äúvendor does not have enough caps‚Äù message.
---
Like what though?
---
Why use binocs when a gun with a scope is as good or better?
---
I cant believe people actually still play this fundamentally flawed piece of garbage they call a game.
---
Youve all got rose tinted glasses and no self respect to still be playing this. 
---
I think op isn't talking about server stability, so much, as *persistent servers*. Everybody keeps joining people that are in the same world, do when you log back in the next day you are in the same world as you were the day before.
---
Just buy one on Ebay like everyone else man.
---
Nexus mods but there‚Äôs not a whole lot you can do. It‚Äôs an online game so you‚Äôre mostly limited to UI tweaks 
---
If you need shotgun shells I am your girl. I have at least 3k spare lol.    Similar amounts for other ammo types.  I currently only use 5.56 and .45 guns and occasionally use my perfect storm (? 10mm).
---
I've been waiting for people to catch on that it's actually pretty strong. Bethesda just throws chems at us and I find myself using them somewhat often on my melee.. If you could stack multiple chem types, but not the same one I think junkie would be a meta option. Either way, now that Bloodied is the big wolf on campus, I think Junkies is actually a pretty viable (although annoying) alternative.
---
I‚Äôve never seen them til now. Far as I can research they have no use. It‚Äôs weird they would creat an item for this game exclusively with no purpose. 
---
Hrmm not sure I realized that. Do you have to succeed in taking the workshop or just initiate? 
---
Some recent changes did not help the level plain.
---
So you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôll never get a good weapon. Level 65 and no legendary weapons worth keeping yet
---
&gt; PA doesn't give you a bonus, it sets your strength to 11 (or is it 10?). If you had 15, you would lose 4 points of strength.
---
I thought PA chassis just gave you a "+2 STR" bonus?  I'm pretty sure I don't lose STR for hopping in one, I just lose my +50 Deep Pocketed armor bonuses and go down in carry weight.
---
Bethesda either needs to state they've given up, or realize they need to spend money, to make it. 
---
This game could do so much, and there's literally nothing to be excited about so far.
---
Some servers just don't seem to produce legendary enemies as they should, and some seem to actually produce more than they should, if you aren't finding them, try server hopping.
---
I start with Watoga, it seems to be a good way to gauge server quality, if I find several Legendaries, I continue on to other locations, if not, I hop.
---
I only had 30 minutes to play this morning before leaving for work, got a good server 1st try, and killed 9 Legendary's, unfortunately 4 did not drop any legendary loot.
---
Lots of bad luck in this game since last patch
---
There is so many variables that we simply don't know, I'm level 196, does that make difference? I don't know.
---
Regarding gunpowder, you can certainly see why melee is regarded as O/P, and not just the damage, With the right perks I can do that loop twice with a baseball bat before it needs repairs, and all it costs me is 7 wood and 4 adhesive. 
---
Can't uninstall for the same reason? Meaning you refuse to just simply log in so it can uninstall? Out that you lost your login info and couldnt uninstall?
---
Sounds like it is working as intended.
---
And it should be at the consumer's expense? Even if you were right whose fault is that really?
---
&gt; without giving away too many spoilers
---
At this point, the spoilers would actually be beneficial to Bethesda. Unless, they don't want to be *too committed* to anything, in case they need to abandon it.  
---
Just use excavator with calibrated shocks... Carry weight heaven.
---
There should be a max cap threshold. Like 100. So if you're level 55 you still lose 55, but if you're level 194 you lose 100. By level 100 you've more likely than not have got pretty great stuff.
---
This sub has a lot more people which gives me a better chance at finding those items
---
Heck in 1, 2, 3, NV, power armor just gave you a strength bonus. In 4, it set your strength to 11, which meant it was possible for power armor to lower your strength. I believe in 76, it raises your strength to 11, if it's lower, but didn't lower your strength of it's higher.
---
I don't believe that malarky and am using their own stupid logic to push my own views. ;)
---
great job!
---
SBQ is such a major resource dump, especially with TSE nerfs, that no one really wants to kill her anymore due to lack of proper rewards. 
---
You are talking about my life and my life choices like you had any idea about them, and then you are saying you are not so delusional, and these two things contradict so much that the obviousness of this contradiction forces me to consider your opinion irrelevant. In my world having fun and self-development do not contradict. Also, haven't been trying to impress anybody, I'm pulling this out as a anecdotal evidence about having a good life and being a gamer, because, since my life is being commented by people who know shit about it, this anecdotal evidence remains the most powerful argument used in this discussion.
---
Philosophically, I'm a pacifist, but biologically, I'm a savage. My hormonal balance is pretty bonkers. It's easy to make me aggresive, and it's hard to calm me down. I channel all this aggresion into computer games, which helps me be a peaceful, friendly and cooperative person despite this internal aggresion. I despise actual aggresion against other human beings. Simultaneously, I love to fight, as a kid I sent several local bullies to hospital. Yet despite being violent is something natural to me, I disagree with my own nature, I don't want to be limited nor defined by meat. The time I spend playing is time I spent channeling out the aggresion thats within me. Having such a drain for all these emotions I am unwilling to be burdened with makes me a more effective individual there where it matters - at building relationships with people and building a good life for those around me. I hope by now you will step back a little and accept that judging people by own standards is an unfair thing to do. If not, don't bother responding.
---
Having to log into a launcher just to uninstall a program IS ridiculous, you tool
---
Another ex Tse user crying. This needs to be titled "the definition of insanity why I am an idiot." Doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result is insanity.  If u go up against some one and they kill you easily rework your build don't scream nerf. If u die and go back for more only to die again and again. That's not from OP weapon that's from you being a fucking idiot. I have an unarmed build, I put a lot of time and thought into. He is tanky as hell and doesn't die easy but will shred you and most of a team before he goes down. Not an assassins build. Not sentinel (and besides sentinel wouldn't work with melee since u have t be standing still, dipshit) Not a low health build. Lower his health gets harder it is to stop him. But never gets below half normaly. I never hit for more than 1 k consistently. Unlike the two shot ex weapons. That hit for 1k with a half assed build. 
---
On another note. Unarmed has one perk card.... That's it. One card that gives plus 20% damage. 
---
Plants are instanced like containers.  Each person should have no problem picking them once, but will have to wait x hours until you can pick them again.
---
&gt;I believe in 76, it raises your strength to 11, if it's lower, but didn't lower your strength of it's higher.
---
I don't believe this part to be true.  When I first started using the Power Armor in 76 I clearly saw a +2 STR bonus on my character menu for being in a power armor.  And the only carry weight I lose for hopping into one without passive carry weight bonuses is the loss of my Deep Pocketed normal armor.
---
I will double check when I get out of work today, but I am fairly certain on this one.
---
No it is just bad, the perk works its just it does almost nothing. 
---
I have one for when I need it.  Otherwise I just use my Deep Pocketed Heavy Combat and Leather armors.
---
Cool, can you fast travel to your camp once it has been tamed? And how do you tell it to stay at your camp?
---
Don‚Äôt you have to be logged in to steam to remove games from steam? And why are you resorting to name calling over a small internet discussion? You must be insecure. 
---
Ha exact same thing happened to me, epic fight took it down with a pick axe! 
---
Maybe make it so vats doesn't kick in until you instigate pvp. 
---
I can confirm the well vs. badly stacked servers thing. I found a legendary server last night and stayed on it for three hours, doing my own farming route (different from yours, see below). Found maybe a hundred pieces of legendary loot, sadly only one or two worth keeping, put the excess stuff into containers around Whitesprings and Watoga, where no one will have found them because I was alone on that server at the end. :-(
---
Notable differences: I don't do the supermutant farming locations (personal preference), but I wonder why you don't go for the two deathclaw spawns in the area you're covering (Emmett Mountain Disposal Site and Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02), or the ghouls at Camp Venture (minimal time investment).
---
Anecdotal: I had an abnormally high drop rate on Salvaged Assaultron Heads on that server and actually kept one of them: three diamonds, two VATS perks and the 90% weight reduction. If Bethesda finally makes those things *not* eat all the available ammo on its first shot, then I may use it someday. At 0.8 lb weight, it's a no-brainer to stash it.
---
Your tame walks to your camp, this takes some time and it can die on its way to your camp. It stays in your camp once it arrives and walks around it.
---
Do you have Enforcer?
---
lol... kind of feels that way doesn't it....   
---
Here is to hoping it's not a "black hole" and they are listening to us.
---
Never too late, great info, thanks!
---
LOL /r/Iamverybadass
---
Or she hides under the map or flies beyond the edge of the map, she is a wily adversary.
---
this. at low level enforcer got me out of a lot of shitty situations with its cripple effect 
---
Just started a new character without Hacker and Lockpicks, actually feels fine. I'll get these perks when I won't have anything useful at all, that's gonna happen somewhere after 80s.
---
Can't help, sorry as I haven't got there yet, but wanted to upvote and reply to show my appreciation for "I just blew the whole wad right in it's face. "
---
At high level it staggers people so people with sentinel assassin armor aren‚Äôt impossible to kill.
---
Rebuild Appalachia right? Towns would give us a sense of progression in the game after dealing with the SBQ.
---
Nope you've just stumbled onto a glitch in the matrix
---
Excuse me the proper terminology is:
---
frickin "laser" beams (air quotes around laser)
---
Also of note, it stays close to wherever your actual camp machine is placed.
---
Megasloth + camp indoors = giant clusterfuck
---
I run leather cause it actually looks cool in this one. It‚Äôs that or the enclave armor cause it‚Äôs camo and has a cool gas mask to go with it
---
Nah...vampire all day.   
---
Wasteland life got you down? Shoot something, you'll feel better!
---
You can't build camps next to each other but friends can build on the same camp, when you are on a team, the game registers most of the things you can do to your own camp to your team's camp too, essentially you can build a base together
---
That character is level 55, only pistols, no PA. Which is fun because it's challenging gameplay wise, but it is also infiuriating because you are even more dependent on luck.
---
My first character is level 140, doesn't see much legendaries either.
---
But you are right, all the things we don't know, starting with the stats. Some perks have percentages stated, some others don't. Some effects have a number, some others don't (higher chance of criticals???)
---
Bloody mess is key
---
Are you hitting search? It's not a passive effect
---
I pretty much said I consider the violent part of my nature savage, ugly, and something I do not wish to be defined by. I wonder why am I even discussing these things with beings that are not only unaware of their bad and primitive parts, but also defined mostly by those. Cya.
---
Why are you still playing this game. This is the exact reason I stopped - the game wasn't rewarding.
---
The term junkie came from drug addicts who junked scrap for money.

Its almost like Bethesda was thinking "What's the most annoying monsters in our past Elder Scrolls/ Fallout games? Dragons and cliff racers that's what. Lets recycle that code for our major endgame monsters in our new game."

Everything I go to Whitespring there is always a bunch of people nearby, due to people placing their camps there. The Whitespring has sort of become a city when I play, if I want to find players I always go there

More of a rubber duck.... Or is that just me?
---
Doesn't excuse 76 state nor make it exempt of criticism Simply because "there was worse before".
---
My wallet doesn't care about that detail. 
---
&gt;I wonder why you don't go for the two deathclaw spawns in the area you're covering (Emmett Mountain Disposal Site and Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02), or the ghouls at Camp Venture (minimal time investment).
---
This is what the selfish side of me was wanting from this post, I'll add that to my loot loop. Many thanks!
---
Yes.  But remember that eventually, you won't have any more perks to learn for that weapon type.
---
What type of build are you going for? Melee, crit/sneak/riflemen, unarmed?   
---
[Nukesdragons.com](https://Nukesdragons.com) can help you play with perks and decide what you want. My highest is melee, 2nd is shotgun/rifle sneak build and my 3 I haven't decided.
---
Lol who judged you? You are the one judging everyone indirectly by somehow thinking plays and books are better for you than video games.... I just said they aren't and basically said every entertainment hobby is fine as long as you don't overdo it..... But go ahead and think you are being judged when I wasn't even talking about you directly. I was talking about the common belief about the old entertainment somehow being better for you. If anything I was talking about my sister because she thinks that and lets me know all the time. But yeah, congrats, you just judged me and told me not to judge you in the same post.... The irony is astounding.
---
Oh, now I am excited. I will test that the next time I play. üòÅ
---
&gt;  Once you fire it, there is a 4 second delay before you can use any other weapon. This 4 second delay times exactly with how long the fire and reload animation takes on the Syringer.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Steps to reproduce are simple, fire Syringer and then hotswap to another weapon. You will be unable to attack until the four seconds are up.

That area has a tendency to spawn those two along with Rad Rats, Mole Rats, Mongrels, and Wolves. I have my camp there too lol.

Well, that's not the question I was asking, but the quick history lesson was much appreciated! Honestly didnt know that was why they were called junkies.

Have fun wasting your life.

He might have called you a sappy bitch, but if he's still out there in any way, he's probably also touched you're feeling this way.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  I lost a great friend a few months ago and it still hurts every morning.  Loss doesn't fade, it changes, and I hope you take really good care of yourself during the rollercoaster of your new loss.
---
As I noted, not everyone will agree, but something significantly effecting balance, most would classify as a bug. 
---
Clearer examples of a suggestion would be the Science user series

Try the Fallout 76 Filthy Casuals or something like that. Im in it but can't remember the exact name.

Anyway, I come here with the message: dont be ignorant and dont be rude to people because you are ignorant. Seems that this message hurts you, and people who are downvoting this. Well, get used to it, ignorance is only a bliss as long as its not pointed out to you.

Hoping they use the data...

My experience with griefers has resulted in me killing them on several occasions only to be rewarded with a few caps, as they most likely offloaded them to a mule before going into PvP mode.
---
I had one Dickhead run up a 450 cap Bounty for destroying my CAMP, but I only got 4 caps for killing him, he kept trying to revenge, and I killed him 4 times before he gave up, had he been lucky enough to kill me once, he would have gotten over 100 caps.
---
VitoriaRain playing on PS4. I‚Äôve been experiencing a lot of power armor glitches still. The past few days, it will randomly unequip my right leg on my excavator PA. It also isn‚Äôt always adding the extra carry weight to my character, which requires me to log out and back in. Please fix it. Thanks 
---
So I can shared a level 2 perk card (my base CHA is 3) when someone shared magnetic personality at max level and there are 4 people in the team, are you sure you don't have another debuff active?
---
They also attack anyone who isn‚Äôt you.
---
I wonder why people downvote general information. 
---
The unlimited damage glitch is the main thing that needs fixing atm imo
---
The legendaries spawn in the same places (if they're there), so once you learn the likely places for a given enemy, you'll be able to make your own routes pretty quickly.   
---
The biggest value of sharing isn't the precise route through the area, but to identify when you didn't get legendary enemies merely due to RNG. It helps to have a larger sample. For example, I've been through West Tek at least five times without a legendary. It's interesting to see that the OP had a 90% hit rate. 
---
Personally I‚Äôm willing to double down on the ammo problem. Slap a prime receiver on a Ultracite Gatling Laser and you‚Äôre melting anything scorched relates, literally and metaphorically. It‚Äôs definitely under rated since it has the durability of a toy made from China. The fun value outweighs this greatly though!

People have been complaining about this for a long time now.

---
Work on originality 
---
Yeah I use Nexus mods. Maybe I have to dig more. Are the tools for Fallout 4 what people use for 76? Or are they a good place to start to learn? 
---
I had a feeling.  I'm just a trashy person whose had stars in his eyes about designing games since the days of Spyro 1 on the Playstation.
---
I've never designed an entire game, my closest to that was when I made a Slenderman DnD game from scratch, beyond that I had some good times with Halo's forge mode, vastly different I know.  Level design and balancing is what I focused on next to storytelling and environment creation, or world-building.  My education was gonna be in video game design...  But that never had a chance in happening.
---
To me I practically see it all in my head, it's not hard to plan it out as much as it is refining it to me, and the hardest part is interconnectivity, making sure a balanced feature works both here and there.  For instance, does putting this short barrel mod on this type of weapon cause any unintended effects (like -6 range where the coding registers a negative value as infinity so suddenly you have a short barreled infinite range shotgun).  It takes time to figure it all out, but once you have a basic idea it shouldn't be hard designing around it.  For instance, online has no time-altering capabilities, the only way that could ever happen is to instance the effect when no one else is around you, that'd break the item which causes that effect should others ever be around, suddenly jet is nowhere in the game, fair enough.  Or say you need an endgame that's fun, provide the endgame with loot tables that completely justifies the challenge.  Progress and grind don't need to be a crawl, you can design a clear route of progression in that grind and progress. 
---
Like I have no clue what FO76's progression is, I have no clue where the main quest line progresses towards and no idea how I'm supposed to grind or power level.  I have no incentive to grind workshops, no incentive to really build anything except a basic functioning and safe spot, no incentive to do events, or seek out certain plans, no incentive to even buy most plans as they don't even explain what they are or show what they look like, the bloody hell is an electric chair??  Or a resort anything?
---
This game has a broken progress curve, I don't know what or where midgame and endgame occur, barely know the starter game.  I get the map divides these up a bit but what about an intended route?  Do I follow the highway through the forest from flatwoods to Whitesprings, top of the world, then into the mire and down to watoga?  There's no clear indication or direction.  In previous fallout games there was a pride to getting strong stuff early, fatman, power armor, in 76 I feel like there's no pride.  The creative team did great, the graphics team (for new stuff) did great.  But you can tell this product is copied and pasted, the originality is lacking in the sense of freshness, a new dragon shooting blasts, new raiders called scorched, some textures even feel like they were pulled from earlier games, and not that it's a problem, but overall the impression given off is one of uncertainty.
---
With some simple instructions and a few changes to loot tables, and bug fixes, this game could skyrocket in awesomeness.  The potential is buried under rubble, the rubble of neglect, from thrown together assets and lack of time.
---
I feel like I would very much enjoy troubleshooting balance issues, bugs, and unintended occurrences (5 scorchbeasts in one area, whaaaaat?) It just comes down to time, but changing, I imagine, 50-100+ lines of code to make energy weapons not broken shouldn't take months.  I can't say the same for server instability but then again I also wouldn't release a game that can't be played without crashing every hour.
---
I would have never of nerfed tse guns or removed them, they were pve gold, I would've nerfed pvp and eventually made a mode to compensate the change.  The first priority of every single game in creation is to *have fun*.  The formula for fun, to me, is easy.  Make a progression curve, startergame, midgame, endgame, then replayability, build a grind and the content of interaction around that curve.  You need to kill so and so but to do so have to travel here, or progress development here, or kill this or that there to access them.  They forward the story when met, and along the way the player should've encountered enemies and containers with the necessary loot to help them progress.  By endgame they should be nigh godly with radiant challenges suited specifically for their area of progress to ensure replayability and certain godtier highly sought after loot to fuel their playing.  Once they've hit that infinite mark of replaying certain things for loot, you need to give them the ability to go from there into new ways of playing, task them in challenges to help others in events or quests, give them various ways to make their build so one way they're combat medic, the next they're close range debuff, the next they're a trader, the next they're a guide, the next they're guzzling buffs and fine tuning their dps and defense for that ultimate challenge fight that requires a group just to initiate.
---
Fallout is ripe with potential, it just needs to be properly handled to be what we were all hoping, a fun multiplayer fallout experience, not a broken crawl or a warpspeed jump to the end.

Downvoted.

Visigoth!

Here's why I dont do the queen anymore....never mind that she doesn't drop any good loot or that she's a bullet sponge or even the fact guns and armor break so fast now....its because of low levels...not trying to sound like some big high level douche but I swear a nuke was dropped on fissure the other day and I just happened to be in Watoga at the time ....the launcher showed up he was level 220....the other ten who showed up no lie the highest next level was a 37 and as low as 13....needless to say you know how that went....

They spawn in the church in one of the forest towns, the same church that has a dead miner whos cloths you can take. I think said location is remenants of an old plan as it is the only area with a body you can strip.

You can use **[BSA](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17061)** to extract the archive files 76 uses
---
Hey I just wanted to write that you probably pressed a wrong reply button. No offense taken, we are kinda on the same side that says 'being rude to people because they have higher level is an immature thing to do'
---
Yes! It‚Äôs ruining pvp and that‚Äôs the only thing I can do at my level. When they release pvp servers it‚Äôs gonna be a shit because they always mess up and another glitch that gives people extremely big advantages will come.
---
Nope 
---
Because it just continues to reward bad behavior 
---
1 for 1 caps for whatever level you are at and over 100
---
2 caps for each level,  if you‚Äôre below 100.
---
It has to go beyond that. 
---
76 needs the same treatment FF14 1.0 received at this point, ie. being rebuilt entirely from the ground up again. 
---
That's genuinely the only way i see it being saved when you look at the amount of things that need to be redone (almost everything), and the speed they're working at to release patches. 
---
At this rate we're still at the same point in 6months.
---
So yeah better start over im fine waiting another year or 2 if they do that. 
---
Last thing those who have already purchased the current version should get to play the new better one for free of course, not gonna pay for it twice.  
---
Explosive weapons do not need a buff LOL. They are still very good guns and I still use my AAE. They don‚Äôt need to one-shot glowing ghouls.
---
So you want people who are negative to literally everything to dictate everything? you must be a politician. 
---
Ghouls at white springs were giving out exp at a much higher rate then intended. That was addressed in last patch. Since then the number of whitespring nukes has gone down

Anthems out soon don't worry.

Why? Do you want some one who has an ax to grind to ruin everything?

There's a lot of things that show Bethesda rarely thinks their systems through. Like the fact that in 4 and 76, armor reduction **never touches energy resist whatsoever**.
---
Thanks for doing this.   
---
Statistically 20 trials is pretty good for normally distributed outcomes, and a formal data collection is far better than anecdote, but in this case the outcome is dichotomous and the data is clustered (non-normal). For real predictive value, the dataset would need  additional predictors but most of the valuable factors are likely unknowable, such as whether another player looted the site just before you arrived. 
---
Similar just happened to me.  Just got my All Rise and just as quickly.... it‚Äôs gone. 
---
Yes and No, but mostly no. (And thanks)

When the post 3 weeks or so ago hit almost 3k Endorsements, calling out Bethesda for it's lack of response to bug reports and ModAuthors offers of assistance and sharing of Data a Community manager reached out, the longish conversation, where I asked for a better way to submit info to the Dev's resulted in "Submit a Ticket"...  
---
After a couple days of Frustration I decided to "Fight fire with fire", step up my game and give Bethesda exactly what they asked for, Tickets.  
---
I then submitted about 35 tickets in a single day, got chastised by someone on the Bethesda support side for submitting so many tickets, and had a number closed out as duplicates.    
---
That lead to a back and forth via email, a request for my phone number and a Call from "Dan", the Customer Support Manager the next day that lasted nearly an hour.  
---
Short of long, I made some people have a rough day, was submitting tickets via Support vs Dev ticket path (Intentional so I had ticket numbers), talked about Support styles and the fact they are locked into corp paths (They can't walk to someone's desk and give a note, they have to submit tickets to the Dev's like we do), etc.  
---
Some talk about streamlining the ticket submission and the lack of transparency was also had, I don't know what will come from it, but I hope they are using the data.  
---
Don't know if I'll be thanked, or acknowledged, but atleast I know I tried.   
---
Don't know and can't comment if they are "ignoring" us, are under orders not to respond, or something similar, but sometimes it can feel that way.   
---
Can't agree more, most the other author's I know who played have given up due to the lack of progress on Bugs, the (no offense to anyone) horrifically done Fixes and Rebalances, and lack of communication.  
---
Don't know how much longer I'll last, but trying to atleast finish compiling this both for us as a community and Bethesda to reference since we still haven't seen a complete list of issues as promised.
---
no enforcer yet, thanks for the advice!
---
They will, if bethesda communicates and we get something good for the base game soon. 
---
weird, submitting as a bug
---
What‚Äôs a TSE?
---
Well considering our latest patch provided just about jack shit compared to the numerous issues in the game and things that need to be fixed. Yeah most of us took off. I hope only one person is working on fallout 76 development otherwise it‚Äôs pathetic really.

Allow players an option to "use" while highlighting an object. For example: food, water, and aid objects.

Yeah I did.... I can't stand the "I am better because I use old entertainment and not modern entertainment" I have gotten that crap from my sister my whole life. I just misread the name when I replied. My bad! Lol
---
yes, loved it in fallout 4 but will have to wait for level 50.
---
Your the one trying to enact regulation because you don‚Äôt agree with someone.
---
Or do like they did in diablo and buy a bigger stash limit at the cost of caps.
---
Reddit is not an accurate metric...
---
Buy one from one of the trade subreddits.
---
I feel the same way...for me, I just get that feeling when a game is over for me.
---
I so wish the ideas from this sub actually existed in the game.
---
I found myself looking for another game last night.  I got more than my money's worth with this awesome game..still sad though.
---
I'm doing my part.
---
Ok sweet, assumed that the search area reset I had to hit them all again.  I'll try this tonight.  Thanks!
---
Loving the op melee .... I can solo whitesprings max level Gouls with my luv 20 toon lmao ü§£ 
---
Also if you're in pacifist mode and someone attacks your base it shouldn't initiate PvP and you shouldn't be able to get killed by said player and have your caps taken from you while you STILL HAVE PACIFIST MODE ON. IT MAKES NO GOD DAMNED SENSE WHY HAVE PACIFIST MODE TO BEGIN WITH?
---
Rough downvotes, but I don't disagree.  Pretty easy to solo after level 60ish and I think the more important factor is that they are guaranteed spawns in a few spots. 
---
You started with Dear Bethesda and I mentally read it as Austin from Shoddy Cast
---
Saying you understand why some people hate the game using an example of players being players is judging the game.
---
There seems to be a good number waiting for the first expansion now. Going to be another hype moment, probably last chance to save the game as a AAA.
---
There is a good non-legendary sitting on the table just north of top of the world (like 50 feet north). Look for the shooting range setup. 
---
eBay.
---
Nope, not sure what happened but it was really rad.   It felt like clip dumping on steel battalion
---
I know it's stupid. I could never find calibrated shocks for my X01 so I just got T60 Legs and put shocks on them. I found a calibrated shock mod for Power Raider armor which is like putting a Ferrari engine in a Pinto.
---
I can't believe the price. There are ways to search for the plan, plans spawn in different locations you might get lucky,
---
I‚Äôm giving them till next patch...if they don‚Äôt fix the shit up from the f ups from last patch....then Anthem it is.
---
Game looks damn interesting. I can't play it as I keep getting constant micro stuttering / freezing. Every 6-9 seconds. I'm down to try 1 last Reddit post which seems to had some success solving or easing the issue before giving up on this game for now. 
---
So I'm guessing others are like me, like the game but bugs and performance are preventing us from playing. So we leave.
---
Hopefully these things will be fixed at some point.
---
Power Armor sets your strength to 11 *if below that value*. Otherwise, you get no downside. It does not *not* lower it if above 11, lol.
---
will invest in enforcer.  other perks that i was thinking about getting: power user, lifegiver, scattershot. 
---
not sure about skeet shooter and if gunsmith level 4 and 5 are worth it. 
---
sucks that you only get 50 cards.  Picked some bad ones in the beginning  like can do level 3. will have to remove these ones once i get to level 50
---
I'm hoping to get my hands on an Lv.50 AAE 10mm Submachine Gun and put a Perforating Magazine on that baby and wooo! I can't wait to tear things apart commando style!
---
Thanks, I really think I've hindered my point by adding that data to be honest. This post should of been a list of sites where legendary may spawn, with the critical information being some servers spawn a lot more than others, if you find a good one, stick on it. 
---
Not sure why you were downvoted more than once; this is correct. PA doesn't lower strength values above 11; it only increase lower ones.
---
Downvoted on both of my accounts. 
---
There does seem to be a downvote brigade on this subreddit, but there's so many reasons to downvote: 
---
* Some people are mad. 
---
* Many of these topics and ideas have been discussed. 
---
* This subreddit has a serious issue with non-descriptive titles. 
---
* Some people's ideas are bad (and yes, worse than Bethesda Austin's ideas).  
---
* Some people want to discuss the game and not the meta. 
---
Complaining to the sort by new users isn't going to fix this. Join them and upvote the posts you think deserve it. Your vote counts the same as everyone else's.

believe it or not, just because it is posted, that doesn't make it quality content. i agree, there are some auto-downvoters, but they come a few at a time. people are downvoted into oblivion for shitposts. like this one.
---
Legendary Binoculars when equipped, should reveal the location of Stealth players on the map, and Highlight targets, including Chameleon Players.
---
Even though I'm a Stealth/Sniper Build myself, I believe this would be a good addition.
---
Just initiate, an back out of the green circle.

&gt;I know it can be set so that only registered users can downvote and that the amount is limited.

You need an account to voteat all, and mods have no way of setting any limit around downvotes.
---
Have since the beta round about 70 more people in my friendslist. Most of them always played fallout but since patch 5 I only have 5-8 of all these people how play constantly. It's really sad because this game has so much potential but I don't think Bethesda is getting it much better next time. 
---
This is far from a shit post. This is acknowledging a problem, stating a problem isn't a problem because it is minor doesn't stop it from being a problem. 
---
Actually, I was considering to respond to the guy regarding old/new info-sharing means, but I don't think he's worth the time. But we are all standing the shoulders of the giants, and while its cool to know the story of those giants, modern masterpieces are usually better than old masterpieces simply because they have advantage of perspective. I mean no matter how good Homer was, Lem took human cognition further than Homer ever could, and then we have those who stood on Lems shoulders, the archmasters that did not gained popularity and traction yet, despite the fact their literature already discusses the solutions to issues our civilization is unaware yet but that will faceroll our grandchildren.
---
I noticed that there is sometimes quite a bit of lag for any actual loot to "spawn" (rotating arrows, "wait" cursor basically) and I have a bad feeling (as a programmer) that if this "wait" times out, it just decides you get nothing. See, the loot is stored on the client, but it's the server that decides what you get
---
I am trying to get some regulation because something is better then chaos. 
---
You're welcome. The substation is within walking distance from Watoga, so it's easy to incorporate in a run.
---
No, you don't, because that'd be idiotic.
---
And yes, it is foolish to just accept that you need to send data to a company to remove their own product. Maybe you're used to that shit on consoles or phones or something but it's bullshit here.
---
So you're saying the cap penalty isn't extreme enough as it currently stands?
---
Who said anything about you doing something wrong. An error during download or a clean up program deleting a file it shouldn't have.
---
Actually a few Reddits do have downvote limits, I just don't know how they set it up. 
---
They definitely aren't on par with the sbq, but she **is** a bullet sponge.  I've found shooting her legs does the most easy damage (vs that small ass face) but beyond that if I can't properly sneak kill her and she spots me, unless I tactically retreat, she WILL kill me.  Poison damage does add up but honestly it's negligible as long as you have stimpacks.
---
But seriously, soloing the mirelurk queen is not fun or easy.  I can't head on her, I have to use sneak tactics and basically shoot her from one spot, displace myself to another spot and shoot, displace again and repeat until she's dead.  If she spots me I have to run, I can't take her head on.  Same with the mutant behemoth.
---
In fact I'm cheap, I'll get to a high spot where they can't get to me then shoot them.  From yao guai, radscorpions, and deathclaws, to behemoths, wendigo's and mirelurk kings and queens if I have cover, enemies in 76 are crazy strong compared to their prior game versions.  I only engage them at the same elevation when I have no other choice and even then I run and jump around like it's Battlefield.
---
So those enemies that make some of us run or adopt cheap tactics, really should have better loot tables to make them worthwhile.
---
And maybe when I can not get disconnected while killing a queen, I'll feel less strongly about this lol
---
Buying stash space with caps would buffs traders who mule low-level accounts, while a quest or level unlock for space gives more space to people playing the adventure portion of the game. Which way Bethesda goes will likely signal what sort of play-style they want to encourage and reward.  
---
Not hyperbole, it may be dramatic.  
---
With Additive and multiplicative effects 20% can represent 100 points of damage or more depending on build, but in this case the Max buff from Demotion Expert was greater than 20%.  
---
As reported in the Patch notes, Demotion Expert level 5 went from 100% DMG Buff to to 60%, which represents a 40% Loss in damage, not 20%.  
---
So 100 damage being increased to 200 points instead becomes 160%, and when you factor the Niche weapons that were already almost never used, that 40 points is massive.  
---
Additionally the "Rebalance" was done the hardest way possible, there are multiple posts (including a couple of mine) outline a much more streamlined option, including modifying the Legendary Explosive effect to not benefit from any Explosive perks at all, leaving it still a very powerful (debatably the most) effect and no longer OP.  
---
You can find the notes from the "Black Tuesday" (Trademark pending, lol) [here](https://www.newsweek.com/fallout-76-update-patch-notes-legendary-shotgun-weapons-nerf-carry-weight-1311507).
---
many of these have already been talked about by Bethesda.
---
The short answer is, you just have to wait. 
---
Some of these, like Explosive, seem self serving. Sure others might like them. But there never should have been the ability to increase damage as much as explosive or two shot did, before perks were even applied. That was the bad game design, not the change to balance it. 
---
I hear you but 1 capacity per level is really stingy. I'd be careful about what you wish for. 
---
Just make it stop targeting friendlies if there are enemies in range period. Using Gun Fu is aids when your chain gets blocked by switching to another player or friendly robot or even some camp turret 500 miles into the distance
---
Excellent, Smithers, excellent!
---
I‚Äôm constantly having bug after bug when I play on pc. Workstations will suddenly not allow me to use them, my best weapons will disappear (even though I never dropped them), I‚Äôll be unable to scrap perfectly scrappable materials, etc.
---
I‚Äôm also experiencing mutants changing to ridiculously high levels when a level 60+ player comes to the same location (even though the mutants were all around my level seconds before). I‚Äôm only level 23 myself and doing my best to level up but it‚Äôs hard when I‚Äôm faced with level 68 super mutants, wendigos and glowing ones. It‚Äôs hard enough defeating them when they‚Äôre close to my level, let alone even high level ones. 
---
This is my first time playing a Fallout game, and although I really enjoy playing, it‚Äôs a pain being unable to play properly (especially when the servers go down multiple times whenever I play). I play alongside my bf and he‚Äôs only a few levels ahead of me and he‚Äôs experiencing the exact same problems, but his experience with past fallout games can‚Äôt overcome the serious bugging issues.
---
I guess we can only hope that someone in charge of debugging will pull their finger out and address the bugs that people keep repeating and complaining about. If you‚Äôre not addressing fixable issues that your customers are complaining about then you really shouldn‚Äôt have released such a poorly put together game so early, or at all. 
---
You are correct there, if you're the last person in the group "leaving" it can sometimes fix it.  
---
But I've also seen strange in numbers stop working, or "negative" all mutations while still grouped with one or more people and someone with mutations leaves the group.
---
To punish you for leveling that high. It's clear from the multiple times that XP has been nerfed that Bethesda intends to slow everyone's advance down significantly.
---
At this point I think it's safe to say that Bethesda does not want you reaching 100+.
---
Quit posting stupid shit and you won't get downvoted. Problem solved.
---
Oh and since you asked for it downvoted
---
all great ideas, but not sure if/when they'd ever happen.  I'd recommend this game to anyone, but ive got that feeling i get when a game is just milked.
---
BGS is still playing catch-up with bug fixes...best thing they did in all those patches was stash increase.
---
As you mentioned, an increase in stash for those of us who put enough hours in to be paid as game testers, might rejuvenate my interest.
---
I always wanted a TSE, but never got one in over 500 hrs...sure, i could have bought one, but wheres the fun in that. Also, always having to sell or throw good stuff away
---
is so frustrating when later on I wish i could have kept it for a different build.
---
I had lots of fun tho...
---
I'm a bit of an academic, so I appreciate that you shared more! 
---
Riiiiight.
---
Yep my AAE .50 cal went missing a few days ago, it was the last straw and made me quit the game. Unfortunately, items have been disappearing from people‚Äôs inventory. Permanently.
---
A lot of people have gone over to other communities to talk about the game, because of the constant game bashers in this forum, which the mods do nothing about. In fact, one person was actually gloating about how most people have been driven out to the filthycasuals forum. Which he was glad for, because now he could bash the game all he wanted, without having to deal with fanbois to blind to see the truth. 
---
My universal solution to the durability problem: double-condition then and carry two. Or three. Or however many you need. Two 50 cals, two gatlings (down from three), one handmade, one 10mm SMG, two plasma flamers. 
---
My gatlings are in the process of being scaled down to one, for general purpose mob control. And the plasma kills so rapidly I found I only tap it for the shortest bursts that do the work, so I get decent mileage out of it. 
---
But... do that and you don‚Äôt have a weapon endurance problem. You have a carry 80-100
---
More weight problem, which is much easier to solve, particularly for a rad build with unyielding. 
---
Truth. 
---
Better call the whaaaabulance this ones going under real fast
---
Well, I encourage you to test that out. Because I can tell you multiple times that I went to uninstall a game, and steam prompted me for permission first. Sounds the same to me. The only data sent to them during the log in to uninstall, is the fact that you uninstalled. I can get that you don‚Äôt like that, but what do you think was happening every day when you had to log in to play the game??? Shouldn‚Äôt have had it in the first place if your gaming data matters that much to you.
---
Added notes w/ credit, thanks again.
---
*nod* try it sometime without mods... ugh
---
You can set it up to hide voting for a time, but votes still count.
---
You can control the threshold where comments are collapsed, but believe that's user-end not mod-end.
---
You can *hide* downvotes in CSS, but that doesn't work on mobile or if CSS is disabled.
---
You can't do anything like prevent a post from being downvoted below 0, that's not how reddit works.
---
I solo‚Äôd a 65 scorchbeast outside WS side bunker entrance with a Gatling plasma and it gooified in mid air and vanished. No loot for me. 
---
I disagree completely but respect your opinion. 
---
You are just going to have to wait till they increase the stash limit like they said they will. 
---
There isn't a level cap? 
---
Then yeah given how this game has run so far, I wouldn't be at all surprised if killing a level 25001:
---
* Crashed the server
---
* Crashed the level 25001 player
---
* Corrupted the save of the killer
---
* Auto-banned the killer for having an inventory out of acceptable bounds
---
* Gave the killer negative caps.
---
i think the real problem is the plethora of rants, "dear Bethesda's," "to the so-and-so's," rage quit letters, and other trash.
---
the solution is downvotes.
---
also, downvotes are people expressing their opinion. sure, some abuse it, but that is a reddit-wide issue and hardly this sub. it is completely unfair to say that those people cant express their opinions, but other people can come to this sub to cry and bitch, or jerk Bethesda off like they work for PR.
---
You know you get after lvl 50 more cards? With every level you are be able to choose between change a special point or take a new card.
---
Skeet shooter is your best friend in a Shotgun build. Craft mods that gives your guns more precision out of hips and Skeet shooter. My Double Barrel is better then every Sniper Rifle on every range :) 
---
*bows*  tea and crumpets for all!
---
My friends list has grown.
---
The intention being to drive people away from the game before they level past 100? Yeah you're right they nailed that one.
---
N00b amounts üòâ
---
Jeebus hasn't smiled upon you until you've obtained a sweet TSE without buying or cheating üòõ
---
You aren‚Äôt getting downvoted because they are ‚Äúnoobs in the game and suckers in real life‚Äù it‚Äôs because you sound like a complete asshole right now. Please reconsider your choice of words and think about what you are saying and not about the people downvoting.
---
if you‚Äôd like, i can sell you an all rise lvl 50 if you‚Äôre on xbox?
---
i have had friends get message this item is duped and have thusfor been removed, when they logged in. but probably not applicable in your case
---
Yup it lacks the typical instanced group content you would see in mmos or even mmos lites ala destiny, division and whatnot. 
---
So yeah i agree its an open world multiplayer and thats it.
---
Don't blame the messenger!
---
I mean, they hated the game for existing, vs actually getting a look at what's wrong with it here
---
Treetops will net you a nice one 
---
yeah, this is up there with one of the stupidest parts of PVP. makes zero sense. it doesn't discourage griefing. if anything, it encourages lower levels to grief high level players, while deterring high level players from wanting to pvp at all.
---
I played through the bugs, and still enjoyed the game...BGS never expected ppl to play as long as we did which is highlighted by the lvl display showing only up to 99.
---
If they rewarded ppl who play hard with stash increase or higher probability of legendaries etc...i'd still be into it.
---
We should get legendary crafting material and use that to affix legendary mods to guns.
---
Rad worms disease increases all values by 50% while active then breaks many mutations when cured. It's all over the place these days. You probably contracted it, then after it ran its course had it negatively impact your scaly skin.
---
I'm 100% aware that New Vegas wasn't made by Bethesda. That's why I said that in 3, 4, and 76 they never made any unique weapons
---
Try not to think too hard about it, the developers certainly didn't. Just imagine it as a nice piece of flavor text that expands the games compelling story.
---
Bugs I can handle it's the constant freezing. Game seems great otherwise.
---
I don't see why they couldn't make the power fist work with power armour, would be nice and make unarmed not worthless in PA
---
Great, thank you! 
---
the patch notes are so minimal that im very doubtful that there's anything good too bring ppl back.  
---
In case you're wondering, the reason it gets no traction here is because people are more interested in defending the game blindly than seeing it fixed. 
---
You're having inventory problems? Well you must be one of those dupers or exploiters! Downvote downvote downvote.
---
Why couldn‚Äôt you uninstall that way? Didn‚Äôt know your password?
---
That's okay, no loot if it hadn't disappeared either
---
One of the tricks with Watoga is that you have to *go up to the Protection stations*. Not just be in the vicinity, but go up to them. There's a lot higher chance that one will spawn in general, which obviously increases the odds of a legendary. Don't forget the ones around the school or up on the roof by the pool.
---
Oh, so saying that people life is sad because they have higher level is okay, but saying that its immature to be judging people you don't know anything about is suddenly asshole. My tone ain't the best one because I am dealing with rude arrogant ignorants, which is something as unacceptable as it is abundant. Its not my problem that other ignorants do not see ignorance, people are often stupid.
---
 Insulting people because they have higher level is a shitty thing to do. Calling shitty things by name is a fine thing to do. Fuck the opinions of people who think otherwise, because they are shitty people, and I'm basing this opinion on something relevant - i.e. their douche behaviour, not something completely irrelevant - how effective people are at gathering exp in a game.
---
Is this serious or just the canned "they break everything" response? I'd love to know what else these crawlers affect...
---
That's way too much common sense for this buffoon
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah... As other people mentioned, this message probably comes from the fact that PA adds a STR bonus, but doesn't distinguish between 1-2 handed and unarmed. 
---
You're doing the stuff all of us should be doing, you're an example to us all.
---
Please don't stop being this awesome, yeah?
---
If you're having fun, then continue playing and having fun. 
---
If you find yourself not having fun, being worn down by the glitches, the broken gameplay loop: Loot - Inventory Management - Repair - Inventory Management - Disconnected from server. Then it might be time to look for your fun elsewhere rather than struggling to find fun in a horribly broken game.
---
Thanks good to know. Still keeping it lol
---
lol thanks and I'll try.
---
I've been using All Rise\* as my go-to weapon since I got it.  I'm also glad that I got it after level 50.  I was going for more a sniper build (which is usually my preference) but have really gotten into melee since.  Running up and smashing Scortch Beasts on the nose is a lot of fun.   I would literally scream if I lost All Rise...  
---
As for junk disappearing, I've never seen that outside of being killed.  I've also never seen weapons disappearing except when dropping them.  I have had occasions where I drop a weapon and the brown paper bag doesn't appear.
---
It is quite possible that you accidentally traded it.  The way trading works between players is not that intuitive.  Personally, I prefer just dropping stuff and swapping that way.  I met a player the other day who's camp was close to mine.  I asked him what he needed and just dropped stuff, he did the same.  We both ended up with stuff we needed/wanted without having to go through the complicated menu of selecting items, setting a price, and waiting to see if it's accepted.
---
I do enjoy the game too, you are not alone. Sadly, there are salty vocal folks who came here and thought this was some loot pinata style game, it's not. It rewards the patient gamer. Enjoy the journey, explore new places, immerse yourself into a world ravaged by war and learn about the survivors' plight, help miss Annie find out the whereabouts of little Freddie...
---
I could care less about loot tables, legendary pixels, damage stats,  fancy camps or a giant bat in the sky spewing green puke. My biggest gripe is they butchered part of the lore and retconned too much of it, but I've got more than my money's worth out of this game.
---
Games are about having fun and my experience playing the game is thoroughly positive.
---
It might be a hardware issue or unstable mem oc (just run at default to test) but idk... I had a crazy amount of instability before getting my hardware sorted out
---
I'm kinda confused what you mean.
---
That is correct the bounties need to be more expensive and make jerks really consider their actions
---
Just got griefed yesterday some clown trashed my camp 
---
He didn‚Äôt think I saw his buddy hiding. Blocked them both and server hopped.
---
FWIW no one wants bethesdas survival PvP server more then me.
---
I am. Not heavy with caps tho.  How much can you let it go for?  May be back on tonight around 5:30p MST.  Thanks btw. 
---
Oh i absolutely agree. But would at lease show the intent to redeem themselves as company.
---
 It might not get alot of people to change their opinion about it cause a precedent as been set and should **not** be forgiven and forgotten but, they might be able to attract new people and get a portio of those who quit back into it.
---
Abandonning it would further solidify the current public opinion of "*76, is only a half assed cash grab therefore Bethesda sux *". 
---
Opinion which in the current state of the game 3months in has still not been proven wrong, considering the very limited amount of ressources that seem to have been put into maintaining and fixing the game.
---
So true! The goal posts were moved. Totally disregarding regular players in favour of new and casuals. They really don't care about hardcore fans like we used to think they did 
---
Hmm, someone should let Bethesda know then so that their community managers can stop browsing this sub for feedback.
---
500 caps ? 
---
Cool thanks guys 
---
I went into xEdit a few weeks ago and looked through the SQ_AnimalTaming0xAnimals lists, of which there are three.
---
Brahmins, Molerats, Mirelurks, Vicious Dogs, Rad Stags, Cats, Wolves, Rabbits, Chickens, Dogs, Rats, Opossums, and Beavers were in the first one.
---
Mirelurk Hunters, Yao Guais, Mirelurk Kings, Rad Toads, and Snallygasters were in the second.
---
Finally, Deathclaws and Mega Sloths were in the last.
---
I can personally confirm that Mirelurk Hunters/Kings Radtoads, Snallygasters, Deathclaws and Megasloths are tameable, but I haven't encountered tameable version of the others myself.
---
No.... the community has lost interest in posts about why people are bored, leaving, or posts about losing interest in the game...  
---
These types of posts tend to bury the more interesting ones...
---
Oh don‚Äôt worry, I carry three with beam focuser to max the durability. I haven‚Äôt found a decent plasma gatling to truly experiment with it. I‚Äôve heard it has worse durability than the gatling laser. I did learn something though, didn‚Äôt know I could get double ammo through Power Patcher. Thanks OP!
---
These people take criticism of the game personally. This user has internalized the game. They have made the game a integral part of their self-identity, so when someone criticizes the game, it is as if you criticized them directly.
---
To them, not only *should* the gme not be criticized, it *must not* be criticized, because allowing a criticism to go uncontested would be the same as accepting it. And since criticism of the game is the same as criticism of them personally, they don't want to accept personal criticism.
---
You are acting as if you are superior to someone because of your level in a fucking VIDEO GAME. Your level isn‚Äôt sad the tone in which you talk to people is, grow up man. Also, insulting people because they don‚Äôt feel like level grinding 24/7 and instead choose to actually ENJOY this game, aren‚Äôt inferior to you. BTW, having a thesaurus doesn‚Äôt make you sound any more intelligent. I 
---
You lose 25000 caps and get a penalty to damage for 3 hours for not having enough caps to cover your bounty.
---
Yea I've been tweaking and doing performance monitoring while I play. Nothing strange except I've noticed whenever it hangs or freezes for that 1 or 2 sec my video card suddenly draws more power and memory. Then goes back to normal. It happens a lot at initial loading the tapers off to every 6-9 sec.
---
Other than that everything else on the system is showing as fine.  Not even sure the thing I noticed with my GPU is the cause or a symptom of the problem.
---
I would switch to a hub model because their infrastructure is built around that idea. You get quests and other things to do in the hub, go out and do that thing, and then come back.
---
Well here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs fixed and fixed properly before the beta I‚Äôm in the same boat, but can‚Äôt even pvp atm without risking loosing caps too cheaters, got 1 shotted in my full assassin cavalier AP refresh set while sprinting the other day, shits ridiculous 
---
I prefer the swap as well but it‚Äôs hard to communicate that sometimes.  I try to keep my phone handy and chat with someone as soon as I‚Äôm able to initiate but they don‚Äôt always respond.   
---
I do think the negative mutations can be fixed by relogging.
---
Adding to the mystery, Rad worms is multiplying mutations by 50%.
---
Also, if you die overencumbered, and relog before spawning at a new location, it may still be bugging out the percentages.
---
The shielded upgrade i think I‚Äôm out right now cant look ..dang not the armor the Underarmor!!! Im sry bad wording
---
I want your weightless wooden armor
---
&gt; -Don't bother scrapping stuff like pipe weapons and raider/trapper armor to get mods. They're useless things and you'll never use them
---
A pipe bolt-action rifle is exactly as good as a hunting rifle and lighter  weight.
---
I definitely think that‚Äôs a possibility. 
---
I can even say I think I‚Äôve been the same way with a game before so I can‚Äôt blame them too much. 
---
I‚Äôve been defensive about The Last of Us because that game was amazing for me and I think it was a brilliantly designed game. The difference, to me, is that the game I defended is pretty universally lauded outside of a few detractors and Polygon reviewers unlike FO76 which struggles to get a review score over 7
---
I would have pretty much nothing to complain about.
---
1. Server Reconnect- option to rejoin last server while not losing our progress.
---
2. Stash size and junk management- bigger stash, reduced bulk sizes and better UI to view each weight i.e. current wight off all Weapons, aid, etc.
---
3. Fix legendary drops- enough said
---
4. Card manager- quick flip between quick presets.
---
It's working for me.  I hit search and I find extra ammo about 20% of the time with a single perk card.  I also have Pharma Farma maxed out and most time I find extra Chems after searching.
---
Only got about 200 right now.  Ended up buying a bunch of junk to finish off my ultracite armor.  Probably should have just farmed a while long but I was tired and wanted it done before I went to bed!   Lol.  Sorry.  But if that‚Äôs not enough, I appreciate the offer. 
---
PS - this is why I love the FO community way more than I love the game these days. 
---
Narrator:  They did not get their shit together.
---
&gt; highly recommend you take the Hard Bargain perk as soon as you can get it. Stuff like purified water is a good source of revenue, but base selling price is 2 caps without the perk, and at least 4 caps when you have rank 3 
---
3 points in charisma is a lot for a solo player.
---
So now we are comparing what others earn as if that‚Äôs some winning argument to make about how much time you spend on FO76.  I‚Äôm now level 102 and probably spend more time than I‚Äôd like to admit on a flawed game but I enjoy it otherwise why play?  
---
What‚Äôs AAE?
---
&gt;so that their community managers can stop browsing this sub for feedback.
---
They really should.
---
It's definitely Rad Worms.
---
Then implement a hard level cap? This game's design is so flawed it's ridiculous.
---
I hear the Brotherhood had a laser sword, but they threw it in the ocean.
---
My character is sneak so my handmade is ~500 with perks and sneak bonus. My 3* instigating power fist with all perks is around 600dmg if target is full health and if in sneak, 2.15x that. I usually roll around with a bloodied .38 suppressed semi auto pipe rifle. It's actually a really fun gun for lower level enemies and ammo is very cheap.
---
I have speed demon in storage haven't equipped it yet...my character is so thirsty now I can't imagine it being doubled...any feedback on what it's like with this current thirst bug?
---
200 hours is nothing for a Beth game. Most of those 200 hours will be spent doing repeatable tasks. Im talking about unique content. To add onto that, 76's content isn't engaging. It's uninspired. This makes it more forgettable. 
---
 That's pretty much universally agreed on. 
---
I feel like you don't have a good understanding of Fallout 76.
---
Look at how long a FO76 let's play lasts compared to a fallout new vegas let's play.
---
Not to mention most of of 76's content is filler quests that just want you to click E in one spot and then somewhere else. It's not interesting at all. It's barely content. Extremely low quality and honesty not worth mentioning. 
---
my main sits around 350~500 with a shotgun/harpoon. but I don't play with him anymore, because I don't want to risk losing my shit. a real goddamn shame.
---
my bloodied alt fluctuates because of adrenaline but usually hits for 250~350 with a .50 cal.
---
You need around level 60 to complete all perks for most builds. If you have a level 300 PvE character and a level 60 PvP character, chances are the level 60 has the best possible gear. In this situation,  its possible to be mathematically infinitely stronger than your opponent, yet receive only fraction of the punishment they get if they die.
---
Reward level must be strictly tied to maximum possible real levels, and real levels, disputably, end at 50 or at 70. Rest is besides any direct influence on PvP outcome.
---
Have you tried Phoenix vendor bot in Watoga for the 3rd one? Also I think the 4th one according to a Reddit post can be acquired from Census Violence event.
---
One would argue that currently, for a lot of people shit and Bethesda hold the same meaning.
---
Great write up.  Always take armor piercing with me before I hit up the silos.
---
170,395
---
 The game doesn't tell you this at all though. Quest markers definitely indicate that you must start over (even though you don't) 
---
And also remember that now Apex Legends is above Fortnite on Twitch viewer count that Twitch viewership means literally nothing and trend of published reviews are just 'some guys opinions'.
---
interesting... loading in always takes a bit of time before it stabilizes... maybe not enough vram (if you have less than 6gb maybe try lowering settings)?
---
Most of the legendary deathclaws I see around Whitesprings are non aggressive and run away when I try to kill them.  You can almost hear them saying, "Don't kill me, you'll just be disappointed!"
---
it really is more like a slot machine...you cannot predict this type of thing...toss a coin 20 times and it comes up heads 18 times...do it again, and you get the idea.
---
in general, ive found 3\* in the weirdest places..its just luck (RNG).
---
Anti armor explosive
---
It actually will not let me uninstall because I do not own the game.
---
&gt;This game needs the Final Fantasy 14 treatment. Go back and rethink everything. 
---
Finally someone saying the same thing as me.
---
I don't think it's logical to do a straight-across comparison like that, because the overarching structure of 76 is closer to 4 than an MMO.  An MMO is built to be played indefinitely.  76, while lacking a definitive ending, does run out of quest content and you are left with stuff you invent for yourself to do.
---
4 released back in November of 2015, and by February of 2016, we had something of a roadmap for the DLCs with the first piece, Automatron, releasing in March.  By the end of 2016, Nuka-World was released, so it was basically a year's worth of support.
---
The same was true of Doom 2016, which got a year of updates - mainly to multiplayer - before the plug was abruptly pulled.
---
how long are you holding him?
---
Legendaries I. 76 ain‚Äôt anything special.... 
---
Seems like this varies, on which wire to cut, to have the thing blow up or not. I've done it I think four times now, varying my choices between each (as well as a repeat), and each time it has blown up! Go figure. I wonder if there is a way to tell which one to cut each time you encounter this bomb, or if you just have to guess. Would be nice if there was some skill to it. Maybe something to observe first. 
---
That‚Äôs great! I didn‚Äôt add in sneak damage/crit damage. I should probably do that math with that. 
---
My quad 10mm with Gun-Fu is so fun with low level enemies. I basically never stop shooting. 
---
In my experience, when PvE people want to start participating in PvP discussions, they mix up holes through which they try to express their opinions, and end up farting instead.
---
Before some of the major nerfs it was possible to level up really quickly because of the TSEs and ability to just roam and do major damage without any consequences.  Just nuke an area, take down glowing ones, collect legendaries, rinse, repeat.  That‚Äôs not so easy to do anymore.  Leveling to 75 was easy for me but then the last 2-3 patches came which totally changed the game.  I didn‚Äôt benefit at all from duping or ridiculous buffed weapons or armor but a lot of others did.  
---
I have tried that bot that where i got the first two but i have not done that mission maybe it drops the third also ill try and see thanks 
---
True.  I found it out by accident, starting the quest in Watoga by clicking on the transponder near the downed vertibird.
---
Same thing happened to me on a question I just posted. Very strange.
---
Come now
---
Not sure why you're getting shitty with me...This post was made well before the media picked it up from another post. Also, when people were getting into the Vaults before, it was before people discovered the Dev room. Bethesda's response regarding the Dev room came off in their wording that anyone who enters a restricted area will be banned.
---
Also, when people were getting into the vaults months ago, it was just a few who were glitching in with power armor. Now people are getting in by way of a daily mission, not because they wanted to. Huge difference. Bethesda has already responded to me and other saying they won't get banned, hence this post was pretty mush dead and the topic dropped. Only one being a drama queen and having a hissy fit is the one coming on an old thread after the fact.
---
üò≥  Wow, Sweet.   There are so many sweet legendaries out there that I‚Äôve never seen.  Farmed Whitespring, Black Mine, Watoga... and all I get are one star legendary crap.  Even from three star Enemies...  one star BS armor, again.  I feel like they need to loosen the purse strings on the sweet legendaries a bit.  Especially since most are nerfed now anyway.  
---
gotcha. I have rad worms every 10 minutes... is there a workaround? i just dropped 500 caps on those mutations...
---
Oh, but did you know it doesn't work on pvp events? I had the monster mask on in monster mash and it wouldn't let me target people.
---
True...  drop swapping does require voice communication.  
---
A of people either don't have or don't use their mics.  I bought a new Astro Mixamp + Reference Headset + ModMic setup for Christmas so I'm a bit more open to playing with my new toy than others might be.
---
Bloodied Grognak axe with 40% Swingspeed more than 1000, with full adrenaline, Nerd Rage and adrenal reaction, twisted muscles and low hp 
---
i dont have empath and i'm a lone wanderer. Any chance i could be affected still?
---
Or they‚Äôll glitch out into taffy and you can‚Äôt get anything at all from them. 
---
Somebody thinks maybe they drop from all events in the Watoga area. Line in the Sand also maybe. So maybe just doing all events in that area and server hopping etc. will help get them.
---
My main character is a melee hammer wielding Power Armor jerk.
---
With high radiation and nerd rage etc I can get a 1200 ish power attack,
---
In the perfect perfect conditions I can one shot a level 50 scorch beast. 
---
But everything has to line up perfectly, has only happened once lol
---
I guess this sort of explains how I nearly one shot a 100+ dude at level 33ish with a sneak attack from my BP Rifle.  He was harassing a group of other players and then backed off real fast lol
---
Does it seem like more than coincidence that it's the "A"s?  Like, the thing that would sort to the top when selling, or worse the Mama Dolce's machine?
---
165 for a hardened level action and I‚Äôm still looking for a hardened .50 i it exists but I haven‚Äôt found any
---
Playing on PS4 and I‚Äôve experienced few performance issues.  I just completed 76 hours and I‚Äôve been disconnected maybe 20 times.  I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a lot.  Like somebody else said, I‚Äôve gotten more than my money‚Äôs worth, but I‚Äôll still continue to play as I‚Äôm only level 20.  I just hope they don‚Äôt shut it down.  If they could somehow turn it into an offline game for those of us who still wish to play but don‚Äôt care about the online stuff.  Another fear is with battle royales being so popular, Bethesda might make fallout battle royals next.
---
Hey guys! Do you hate the constant bashing of Fallout 76 on ~~/r/Fallout~~ /r/Fo76? Then come on down to ~~/r/Fo76~~ /r/Fo76FilthyCasuals!
---
Yeah, I never really like the TSE weapons, because of the glitch where it wouldn‚Äôt even do damage because of how high the damage scaling was, I have 3 different ones (Handmade, Lever Action, shotgun(can‚Äôt remember if it‚Äôs pump or double barrel because I sold one.)) I still love using the super sledge, man is it satisfying to wack a glowing one‚Äôs head off.
---
I have mentioned this in several comments, I usually start in Watoga, if I'm finding good legendary enemies, I continue through my favorite locations list, if not, I server hop, also for locations like Watoga, &amp; Whitesprings that have recurring spawns, if you find a lot, stay and kill everything, repeatedly.
---
Spent 2 hours in Watoga on one occasion finding that Legendaries were continuously spawning as robots were being replaced, and killed more than 60 legendary robots, most loot was unremarkable, but did get a few good drops.
---
Another occasion in Whitesprings yielded 47 legendary items in less than 1 hour, again, most loot was unremarkable, but did get a few good drops.
---
Several locations I have found that typically spawn a single legendary enemy, seem to provide better drops, ie.. West Tek, Pleasant Valley, Appalachian Antiques, this seems to be consistent with particular servers, if you get a good roll at one location, there's a better chance you will at others.
---
I don't have any real evidence to support this, just my observations from 500+ hours &amp; 2000+ legendary kills.
---
My 50 cal does 46. My leg semi auto handmade does 90. 
---
found the solution here: uninstall
---
Also, I have tested on a couple of systems and found that I need 6c/12t 4.0ghz with an old x58 Xeon to get a solid 60fps 1080p (3.4 GHz was not enough)
---
To be specific, the game menu appears in two different places, once before you login/start to play, and again after.
---
Pacifist mode does not appear under Settings/Game at the main menu screen.  
---
You have to select Play - once you are in, then (on ps4) go to the map, L1, Game, then select pacifist.

When a 3 star legendary wont recharge its health and then drops no loot makes me break down emotionally
---
400-500 is fine for me.
---
Probably why you can buy succulent plants in the Atom Shop for a mere $20.
---
melee != unarmed
---
This is one reason I hate the game but if you play something that use a random algorithm it‚Äôs never random there‚Äôs a pattern and find anything with luck and charisma and have a team with the same roughly and before you that‚Äôs making excuses for them I‚Äôve had more shit disappear fall through the earth then probably anybody but I grinder the shit out of it today and it went from two and three ‚≠êÔ∏è to shit that would be better  in fission site so no one can get to them with that said Bethesda you really do need to give us better loot when you drop legendary‚Äòs and quit giving the fucking armor every time it would make it better and yes being able to break down a legendary and mix the legendary‚Äòs together from the mods you have so you can make your own legendary weapons and armor so yes it would make it a lot funner and the Greitens wouldn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre being abused so give us this and bet you 3000 in caps it would work and bring more people back into this game or don‚Äôt and have crash and lost the best game f of postapocalyptic America so heed those warnings because they are real Mormor people don‚Äôt wanna play this game because of that shit and I‚Äôm about done with it
---
Thanks for the tips, I do appreciate your efforts. FPS overall is fine. Settings low or high the freezing happens. Doesn't happen with the map open or at least it's not noticeable. Rx 560 4g OC by manufacturer.
---
This other Reddit post talks about a custom config and trying to force Vsync off. That's my next step later today.
---
Ouch... I have never been shown that before thank you very much for posting it. 
---
It wasn't ah drill???
---
it just works
---
Hell yeah that's been my strategy, I've noticed sometimes it buffs perks and consumables too. The only problem is once the disease goes away it glitches out the carry weight perks.
---
I only trade with players I know, mostly because while I doubt the rumors of trade stealing are true, I have equal doubts that Bethesda has really ironed out all the kinks with the system.  It's something of an arms race between these two, and the former party is a lot more aggressive about it.
---
That said, I've ended up with two Lv. 50 All Rises through vendors.  I've never collected "my" All Rise from Mayor for a Day, but the precise reason is because of things like this.  If I could wait it out and get lucky, then I'll save mine.
---
Blackwater Mine is also an option. It's closer to Whitespring, but has a loading screen between the irradiated barrels and the deconamination shower, so Emmett is probably faster. 
---
Indeed, to use your analogy to get the main point of the thread, it the server is a slot machines then some pay out more than others, if you are on one that is paying out, stick on it.
---
 If After 20 spins it pays out 0, go to the next one, if it pays out 3 times keep playing as you are going to win another 3 times the next 20,  And because of RNG it sometimes pay out everytime, in which case Kaching! you are swimming in Leather arms and 1 star walking canes. 
---
My question is how you load in in four minutes? Lol
---
Seems like a couple patches ago maybe last one? Idk. I got an extra loading screen and get in but games still not loaded fully. Can't move or open pip boy. If I try I got to relog .
---
Trade steal was confirmed hoax. It is not possible to steal things out of other player.
---
In 430hours i had never weapon disapeared. 
---
Yes, the serums give specific mutations. No random luck required. 
---
does prepared food spoil?
---
I had 35 cooked glowing steaks yesterday, today I had zero
---
I only had 8 spoiled meat   
---
that doesn't add up
---
Melee = stick!
---
Unarmed = Fist based weapon 
---
Welcome to 76, your stay will not be pleasant at all! Enjoy!
---
Uninstall the launcher then uninstall FO76, worked for me
---
Melee builds are OP and next to be nerfed. 
---
I know this has been said before BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE ADD A TIMER ON THE MAP TO EVENTS/QUESTS IN THE NEXT PATCH.
---
Either that or make it not cost caps. I don't like paying 35 caps when I log on to travel to do enlightenment to find myself having two minutes to kill and harvest 50 fireflies.
---
I have this happen several times.
---
sometimes logging on and off will make it all come back. but not this last time
---
yesterday I had 35 grilled glowing steaks, today I had none  
---
I only had 8 spoiled meat in case anyone wants to go that route, so that doesn't add up.  
---
I also didn't think cooked food would spoil
---
Yeah I think it works pretty much like u/fatboyonsofa says.
---
I don't think anyone here is trying to micromanage their development. I'm an application developer so I do have a feeling for how complex it can be to track to down bugs in code. I also know how much work goes into making sure you release a code set that has undergone thorough review to address major bugs before release. No one here is saying that what the developers are going through isn't difficult. From a loyal gamer perspective we just really want more information so that we can make an informed decision. Do I keep logging in daily and checking forums for a hope for change or do I shelf it and check back in six months or so? Without communication players are left feeling abandoned. 
---
Do you die often? I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt like running a bloodied build. Kinda a glass cannon? 
---
Scorched BBQ Queen
---
&gt; Twitch viewer count
---
That's a nice strawman you've got there.
---
If you can't see the difference between what people are watching on an online streaming service versus less people whining on reddit, then I think we're done here.
---
And another guy working to fuck up the first guy's fixes.
---
Welp, add me to the list I guess.... fuck. 
---
class freak (3) mitigates most negative affects of mutations, I have all but three, and have no issues. They all add value is you suppress the neg affects. 
---
My behaviour is based on 'behave towards others as they behave towards others, be respectful be default, be fierce towards shitheads'. People who consider that they are in position to say that other people have sad lives because they have higher level are obviously inferior types of beings. People who say that they spent all their time exping and somehow achieved two weeks worth of output in a three months period are obviously less effective players. People who are less effective and are insulting other people for being more effective are the combo - not only noobs, but also douches. Inferior gamers, inferior people. If you do not like the harsh truth, I don't really care, but thats the truth: people grinding for three months for exp and achieving so little are bad players, and people who think they can judge others not by their behaviour, but by some abstract irrelevant shit they focused on are BAD people.
---
I die a lot, sometimes just from jumping from a very small height. I have a lot of min maxed stats. I don't really pay much attention to the numbers exactly so they could be off probably on the lower end, but it's exciting being so low health and needing to pretty much one shot enemies or die. I have all defense perks also like Serendipity, Nerd Rage, Ironclad, Barbarian, Evasive, Dodgy, Blocker, etc.
---
Didn't say it did excuse it. People seem to be responding to arguments I'm not making. I didn't say it excused 76 from any criticism I just think people have forgotten just how bad NV was on release on console.
---
Lovely isnt it? The best is when the game freezes at a load screen and you dont even die twice and yup still gone.....
---
its actually refreshing to have someone say out loud what we all must be thinking, somewhere in the back of our brain...
---
anything is good...in moderation
---
im also guilty of spending way too much time playing video games after a particularly bad breakup
---
I've gained a few pounds for sure as well.. cmon springtime! come already so i can go outside again!
---
Thanks ill try that fallout is fun anyway with the bugs or not 
---
Absolutely. Gun-Fu makes it 100x worse. Sorry for everyone I‚Äôve shot at Whitesprings! 
---

I am a PVE player, but I have a PVP player also in the house.  While I despise any pvp, I do get a thrill out of the whole is it a good/bad guy on the way over. He, as a pvp based player, couldn't care less about new content.  I feel like a large number of returning fallout players are more from my side, and many of the new, ie. younger, players fall in his category.
---
It is hard to wear each others shoes, even in house having a discussion.  His bare minimum enjoy-ability, to me, sounds like griefing.  He really does like killing a player and taking the stuff.  He is also all about weapon and armor skins. I spend unhealthy amounts of time making my house.
---
Fallout does an ok job catering to at least those 2 types, and probably more.  But each side hates each other. griefers and snowflakes.  Problem is other games are catering to one side or the other, and doing it well. 
---
PVP makes money, but the player base is extremely finicky.  Many of the remaining PVP players tend towards the "wow soft target PVP newbs" type, as competitive pvp games do real pvp better.  A fallout skin only goes so far.  Those players wont be super interested in a full PVP mode, and PVP players are playing other games now.
---
I think bethesdas plan was pretty good, but way too slow.  PVP servers a month ago would have been full, and a few new vaults opening soon would have worked. But now PVP is dead, and PVE expects a full DLC. I dont think the current efforts will change that now. 
---
I will interject with some advice - Scrap Pipe Revolvers and learn all the Mods for it as a Pipe Revolver Rifle can take advantage of Both Rifle and Pistol Perk Cards and can fill in really well Dps wise while Leveling. 
---
I've had very little griefing in this game, but all of it has come from players higher level than me. 
---
Had no idea it's really THAT broken... 
---
actually in most the game's instances, melee includes unarmed, but also means 1h and 2h too.
---
You can view how many caps you get by killing that person on the map
---
Also, FFS, read the discussion or go away. I'm defending a guy that was insulted, and I am being insulted for doing that by the very same people whose opinions are pure bullshit because they think they can judge people on premises they took out of their asses. Dont defend those people, don't join them, don't cover yourself in their shit.
---
I just got mine last night through the technical data quest. I run this about 7-8 times a night by server hoping the enclave. Grabbing one technical data at a time a fast traveling to fort Defiance to deposit it. In the past 3 days roughly 25 runs I‚Äôve obtained 2 engineer outfits, 1 army fatigues, BOS lab coat and now the science scribe one. It‚Äôs my favorite.  Lots of purified water and ammo as well. 
---
Well do my bum. You need some punctuation man. I gave up half way through. :)
---
I‚Äôm not going to read this whole thing, but you are calling someone AN INFERIOR BEING, stop being such a beta cuck.
---
Enforcer, as you already realize, is great.  Pretty much every enemy in the game short of the Scorchbeast Queen can fall prey to leg cripples while you finish them off.
---
Generally, you should get the first rank of each Shotgunner (the same of true of all cards like this for different weapons, like Slugger, Gladiator, etc).  You'll get a 30% bonus for 3 SPECIAL points, versus a 60% bonus for 9.  When you reach a very high level, you can think about whether you want to fully commit to the rest.  At Lv. 36, you probably don't have too many Legendaries, let alone 3\* Legendaries, and these can really influence the direction you go.  For example, I started with two-handed melee, but I gravitated into one-handed melee and unarmed because the Legendaries I found for each were so much better.  But the one thing I keep regretting was maxing out Slugger and Expert Slugger because you can't break them up and it costs so many SPECIAL points to equip them.
---
Fuck sake kiddos - the game is what you make it. There is no grind except the one you make of it. 
---
Gotta grind and it sucks? No you don't you fucking ninny. Garbage loot? Cry me a river.
---
If you're not having fun, PLEASE go live your life outside of it. Your life is short and spending countless hours on a game with no reward isn't healthy. 
---
Its never been accurate.  It showed at over 500 caps but I only got 5
---
Wish there was a SCREW deposit. 
---
Good luck! (With it happening on low and high it sounds like CPU/ram is more likely to be the problem... Fullscreen right?)
---
I'd debate that 3 is too low - I think 6 Ch is about right - Lone Wanderer with 2 Tenderizer:)
---
ahhh, those 3\* walking canes..if only!
---
No chance‚Ä¶ Make an alt and trade it through a friend to your main.
---
Tl;dr people are inferior people, cya
---
Yeah... I'm sadly also a gun fu user.. So frustrating 
---
I‚Äôm not defending anyone here, but I will not let you stand here like a fuckwad and insult people because you don‚Äôt have a girlfriend or a life.
---
Losing the Blade of Bastet was my biggest regret of the game. I have found decent melee weapons since, but I had no idea how good it was at the time, or that it could be reforged at higher levels. :(
---
What people are watching on an online service vs. what people are talking about on an online service.
---
Not a strawman, just pointing out that everyone is super gassed about how successful *their* game is on &lt;insert platform here&gt; until it isn't. Then suddenly that platform was always actually irrelevant.
---
Be honest, we want to like the game, and even with that inherent bias the game compared to anything like it out there is literally laughable. 
---
Thanks for asking this, the answers here helped me understand it also
---
There is a glitch that you only get half the caps. And if your with a team the caps split between everyone
---
Not at all. Level 3 Lone Wanderer is probably one of the best investments for most any solo player.
---
The thing that makes this worse is how poorly they have balanced the game. There probably isn't a world where wood armor would be something you'd want but by making armor essentially worthless it just means half the legendary drops have no use by default. 
---
I have found 58 Cap Stashes since the Patch and have strung together some epic runs of 2k+ caps
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
You can have someone make you one if they still have theirs 
---
Holy Shit I agree. I rarely get good weapons. I‚Äôve killed the queen and have gotten wooden armor which is downright stupid. Sometimes I‚Äôve gotten 1 stars from her. It‚Äôs all broken
---
as a pistol build i quite wonder how i even shoot my .44 in power armor.
---
I think thats it for "improvements" other than bug "fixes"
---
I know the glitch. What um saying is I got after a 500 cap bounty. Get close it becomes 250 kill them get 5 
---
Who knows? After the last hotfix the community people from Bethesda have been pretty quiet. The last couple of updates have really angered a lot of players. 
---
Hopefully they get a bunch of fixes working and start down the path of redemption.  Lol
---
Since the bombs dropped just before Halloween, it seems like all of the vendors in the game are stuck with jacked-up prices on Halloween costumes. So my go-to money maker is to craft Halloween witch outfits. I think they cost 5 plastic and 2 cloth, and sell for somewhere between 25 and 50 caps depending on your level of Hard Bargain and Charisma. Both plastic and cloth are pretty easy to come by -- you get cloth from the otherwise useless pre-war money that's lying around everywhere. Most importantly, like most outfits they weigh only a tenth of a pound or so. You get in the habit of just making a bunch whenever you pass by an armor workbench, and then you've always got something to sell at the vendors.
---
The only downside is that you need the plans, and I don't know where I found them in the first place.
---
In general outfits are one of the best cost-per-weight items in the game. Some, like the straight jacket and the golf outfit, are worth a fair bit of caps. Getting in the habit of picking up clothes when you see them is a decent money making strategy.
---
Furious is solid, but only works for niche weapons in any meaningful fashion, while bloodied is good on pretty much everything. Bloodied and AA are easily the best atm, with junkies furious and on the right weapons instigating coming in next. 
---
Executioner isn't really all that meaningful. I liked it when I first started, but meh, it's really only good for bullet sponges **and** if you have another weapon to use til 40% threshold. In other words it's useless if you have AA because you'll get more benefit from the armor pen on mobs where executioners is viable. If you don't have AA then executioners is a good stop gap.
---
For 2 handed melee you can't beat instigating for 1 shotting things, but sometimes you're not looking to 1 shot everything. That's why I carry around a vampiric/+40% swing speed super sledge.
---
yeah, it makes my head hurt as well, there really is no reason for it as it is
---
Check your connections 
---
If you‚Äôre wired vs WiFi 
---
And disable or tweak your AV and firewall rules
---
My mcaffee was screwing my connection issues
---
Allowed the firewall to run zenimax and bethesda works just fine 
---
 You can craft the Blade of Bastet after you complete that quest line. 
---
It's the old "take something off the shelves and carry it back to the return desk at Wal-mart" strategy.
---
"Yeah, this empty Nuka-cola bottle was a gift. I don't have a receipt, sorry."
---
I feel the same way.
---
I owned FFXIV at launch and the reboot was truly a phoenix.
---
Best traditional MMO out there IMO.
---
Relaunching FO76 would also give a good excuse to wipe all the duped garbage.
---
I have the same problem 
---
and here we are again, the community doing BethSofts job for them
---
What we need is enemies with high health and little to no armor. Those types of enemies are vulnerable to the higher dps of guns, where melee doesn't gain the benefit of their high natural ap.
---
I found this during the beta. It was hard as hell to clear at that level and there no real reward (story) for the effort.
---
You sure?
---
Send the ticket into bethesda ingame 
---
I had a similar issue w/order quest and didn‚Äôt get the holo tape to advance
---
You might also want to check w/updates and make sure you‚Äôre current 
---
Yup full screen
---
Oh sweet summer child.
---
I sprinted in there and activated all of them as fast as I could. Seemed to work. 
---
Be careful. Someone says the wrong thing and the fanboys will downvote ur comment into oblivion. I used to love Fallout, but this game blows dick for food stamps.
---
Dang, my new character is a melee build and I‚Äôve been all about the supersledge and war drum but I just forged the blade of bastet. Perhaps I won‚Äôt toss it aside like the garbage I thought it was. Are you on Xbox? I think my other character still has hers... 
---
One of the ingredients in making another blade of bastet is the actually sword so no one can give a spare 
---
Nothing about the game rewards continual play, especially with changing plan availability/cost now you have to farm caps, which have no other use... I play WOW, if I go grind for hours there I make actual progress....
---
There are no unarmored enemies after level 10, because beth balance mean giving every enemy extrodinary amounts of armor, the least armored enemy after level 50 is a charred ghould, with 85 armor, most enemies are almost 200.
---
On a related note - what perk actually does this?  Is it Animal Friend or Wasteland Whisperer?  How does the process actually work?  Do they start walking to your CAMP on their own, do you prompt them to go there somehow?
---
Positive.  Its happened many times 
---
Mutant slayer super sledge with perks is around 400+
---
Two shot Gauss rifle is 300 with rifleman perks. (fun gun)
---
Two shot Tesla is about 150 with above perks. (hits all targets..good for groups)
---
If im on a killing spree, i just use melee...soo much quicker.
---
&gt; But seriously, soloing the mirelurk queen is not fun or easy.
---
I have absolutely no issue with it...
---
That aside my point was that the mirelurk queen and the SBQ are not anywhere near the same level. The SBQ cannot be solo'd with current weapons without abusing game mechanics in unintended ways. The SBQ takes a solid 10 minutes (if you're hustling) of work to spawn then another 15 minutes to kill. 
---
Meanwhile mirelurk queens have guaranteed spawn locations, take no effort to spawn or find and are easily soloable. They should not, in any form or fashion, offer anywhere near the same loot, let alone 2-3 guaranteed legendaries. Otherwise people would literally just server hop their spawns and farm legendaries. Nukes would be a thing of the past and end game farming would be even shittier than it is now.
---
Hmmm I think your right. I think it‚Äôs craftable as a way to increase its level. 
---
I never tried making a second one. Just always saw this as an option, 
---
I gave up and uninstalled the game.  There's no point to grinding the wasteland when the game just gets worse with updates.
---
I looked this up simply because a once a week fluff post and once a month patches seemed crazy slow to me.
---
I wanted to know how long until this game could be considered polished.
---
Looks like 6 months out to me.
---
I also have no idea why they aren't patching the PC version as fast as possible since it doesn't carry the fees of console.
---
It would be very morale boosting to see patches land on PC that are substantial and successful as a console player.
---
Digital Extremes does this with Warframe and it's essentially free marketing and hype for console players.
---
I see no reason to avoid doing this. The game is cross platform. This again makes me believe they simply don't have the staff to push out bug fixes, let alone new content.
---
I have never had this problem. In fact, I have taken over Sunshine Meadows many times, just for the aluminum and had my character just sit there for hours, only moving a every 25 minutes or when I have to defend the place, which often the turrets do it for me. 
---
Me and my friends often take over workshops in a session. Whenever we are passing one, well take it over, and defend it at least once, for the plans we get. 
---
We don't get disconnected like this. Never have. 
---
My stealth rifle man is pretty good now against SBs 
---
Found a fissure site near savage divide and more where they hang out. Bogtown? Looted like a bandit! Lolz 
---
funny you should mention this, I didn't check reddit since I initially went on my computer today, and this is the first thing I tested :P Can confirm your statement :) Good tip (Y)
---
Why would you not always have starched genes on if you have mutations you don't want to lose? Sounds more like the guy was doing people a favor lol.
---
200000 atoms is the sale price.  Marked down from 400000 for 72 hours.
---
Just keep a small bounty like 20 caps, surely that‚Äôd be a better solution than losing 300 caps? 
---
I mean when people give solid critisms and want this game to be good only to see it stagnate and make changes that don't really make sense I guess you can call that "bashing the game".
---
Yes, mine did too. That was the best melee weapon I had.
---
I've seen planters with 3 crops at one of the farms.  So they're in the game.
---
There is a bit of complexity, if you drop armor below 2/3 of your weapon damage you will start seeing narrower differences in the effect of armor piercing, as you are only gaining a smaller percentage of damage reduction improvement, when armor = weapon damage you lose 50%, pulling armor lower or damage higher gives the most significant benefit if you can get past that critical point.
---
The handmade has a high base level damage, meaning armor effects it less, and the 50% armor reduction will pull most of the less armored enemies close to that benchmark with an apropriate build.
---
time for an alt.
---
I have spent 2 full days searching for a Tameable creature/animal, I have both Animal Friend &amp; Wasteland Whisperer maxed, I have read the guides, watched the YouTube videos, but had zero luck with finding anything tameable.
---
This person knows what time it is with the green laser light show.
---
Now if only I could find the !@#$ UGL plan...
---
Sarcastic humor didn't require sunshine to belly laugh plus comedy is subjective
---
because Lone Wanderer is such a crappy perk
---
I don't think they are influenced by tree cover.  Sometimes a Scorchbeast is just derpy and would rather hover in place than do anything else.
---
I've speculated it has to do with the terrain you fight them on.  If it's sloped, and has few flat patches, they won't land on it, even if their wings are crippled.  They'll choose some other location relatively far away and do it there.
---
F YES WOOD
---
I think you can still get it back
---
All Rise is a fantastic melee weapon as well. Its a rocket sledge with weight reduction. 
---
Been looking for one myself.  Good hunting
---
One strange side note to this point I've never really understood. . . You cannot sell disease cure. I've actually been to the point where I will not pick them up anymore, I have so many. Seems weird that you can vendor every-damn-thing else in the Aid category, but nor disease cure. Anyone have an idea as to why?
---
Thanks man you too
---
EVERYTHING
---
Enemies above level 50 have a huge amount of armor, charred ghouls are the least armored at 85, and most enemies get close to 200
---
if you guess enemies have 3 times their level in armor you are probably underestimating it on everything that isn't a ghoul or scorched, who are closer to 2 times.
---
Yeah, I'll cede the Trapper thing, especially given WV is land-locked!  Not convinced on the other three, though.  I'm just going to chalk it up to "didn't feel like doing new assets and just ported the old stuff".  Head's going to hurt too badly otherwise.
---
A hell of a lot of good those inferences did anyway. you wouldn't be one of those people just looking for a free trip out to WV would you?
---
&gt; Most of the Atom shop stuff was probably designed, created, and queued up from the day the game was launched.
---
Dataminers have already confirmed that *everything* so far is just pre-release content that has just been made available at an arbitrary time they felt would make for good scheduling of Atom Shop content. According to them there's still over a gigabyte in yet to be released Atom Shop assets.
---
You need the old one to make a new one same for 
---
Garb of mysteries, and voice of set
---
Yeah, I hadn't considered that.
---
Dammit im in class
---
Ya, why the fuck can't we scrap legendaries.
---
If there is even any logic behind that reatrictions, it's shit.
---
They are not a caring game company, passionate about their work. They are a corporation and this game is just a product, just a widget to them. They have certainly proved that. They built up a brand, hyped it, sold us on it, ripped us off, shipped a product they knew was inferior, failed to fix it, refused to refund our money, stopped allocating resources to it, failed to take ownership and will soon shut it down.
---
If they suddenly found their corporate cojones and decided to fix the game, cost be damned (and they do have the money), made this game into the stellar Fallout game they had sold us on, they still wouldn't get everyone back.
---
If they could get Angry Joe to give their rebuilt Fallout 76 a 9/10 with a Badass Seal of Approval, maybe.
---
Ain't gonna happen fellas.
---
That's a helluva way to spell scorch
---
LMAO
---
What you don't get 2+ months off work for every major holiday?
---
Logging camp. There‚Äôs one up top. 
---
Yes have the same problems.. I always have to try hard to get the SBQ when in Nuke Zone and trying to VATS. Always a pain in the ass.
---
A test server would make more sense to me.  People can see new content but know it's jacked up.  I think that would restore some confidence.  No need to spend money on an event.
---
&gt;It's because most of the enemies swarm you making guns basically useless.
---
Great point. 
---
And that is why bounty should be like a lien when the person doesn't have enough caps to cover it. Have a 450 cap bounty on your head but only 50 caps on you? Then every single cap you find or earn should go straight to the bounty hunter until that bounty is paid off.
---
Good to know!
---
The only ones who know are the change makers...
---
The most likely answer is it was brought over from the engine conversion from fallout 4.  Probably not removed properly.
---
I thought the harness and dog helmet were for wild mongrels that you pacify i could be wrong 
---
If you really wanna go overkill there is a perk that gives +50% damage when you get revived for 90 seconds. 
---
I've been able to get 4.6k damage on my deathclaw gauntlet before without chems so yeah it's not that hard to get that damage if you pay attention to the little things, like you did!
---
Didn't know that - great tip!
---
Absoutely!!!!
---
Love the gatkeeping:
---
More than one person will likely weigh in claiming this is QoL.I personally have a good amount of experience with "Balance" in the Modding side of things, and anyone who used one of the Niche weapons, or used a Demo Build could easily explain why this is not QoL but a bug.
---
lol that was the most naive statement I've ever read, fanboi.
---
Sorry. Also got the responder protection at Charleston but he wouldn‚Äôt let me trade
---
half the time in PVP, VATS doesn't work anyway.
---
"Well, I guess he's sneaking in plain sight, so VATS clearly can't target him"
---
i have a suppressor's gattling that i've been trying to slowly perk into. it's only 1\* but i have that heavy gun itch. 
---
I've done exactly nothing to help improve this game so if someone nominated me, I'd be very confused as to why. Lol.  
---
Also as I mentioned, it would make more sense if they did it at E3 or Quakecon
---
A few times recently, I've been bombarded with little animations showing that the "Serendipity" perk has procc'ed, but I don't even have that perk.
---
I see more low levels nowadays.  I think the people who rushed the end game are mostly done.  Now we've got some curious people buying on cheap.
---
dense armor is the way to go, so easy
---
Haha what are you, the 3rd community manager? Does Austin have more community managers than programmers? How much of the community is actually left to manage?
---
You've made a big assumption on what I might consider game bashing. 
---
However, I never gave anything that could be used for you or anyone to determine what I consider game bashing. 
---
Also, there's criticism, constructive criticism, and bashing. Here's example of all three. 
---
I don't like having to switch out perks just to be able to do things in the game. It's stupid and boring, I hate having to go into the pipboy, then to the perk system, and then switch out the cards I want. And then a few minutes later, have to switch it back.
---
I don't like having to switch out perks just to be able to do something in the game. Or at least, not the way it's currently set up to allow me to do so. It would be much easier if I could set up perk decks, that remember my perk set up. That way I can have decks labeled Crafting, Sniper, Melee, Sneak, whatever. It would also be great if I could switch these from the pipboy, rather than go into the perk system to switch. I think this could be done easily from the Status tab, and just add another submenu, Perk Decks. 
---
Todd Howard can suck my ass after i take a shit, but before I wipe for promoting this crap game. It's a fucking piece of shit and he must love the taste of shit, this has him written all over it.
---
And no, I'm not exaggerating about that last one. 
---
But also, people just don't read. They complain about Bethesda not having better communication. But at the top of this reddit, is a post, from Bethesda, about many of the issues that are most popular on here.
---
Every week many people ask to be able to rename items. This is something Bethesda has said they are going to do. Yet, still people post. Simply because they don't know that it's been talked about. Same with the stash limit. It's going to be increased. But you just have to wait. No amount of ideas and suggestions are going to change that. Nor is it going to move it up the list, as it's probably at the top now. 
---
Also, a lot of suggestions are clearly self serving. Saying things like, unnerf two shot or explosives, are self serving. It's not solid criticisms. It's just wanting things for yourself. Or like people saying no one wants PvP servers. 
---
Well yes, a lot of people do. And a lot of people have said so. Saying no one wants X isn't even criticism. It's just ignoring that which you don't like. 
---
Grimly amusing that the blurb about Bethesda to the left of all the job postings doesn't mention F76 at all.
---
I got used to manual scrapping when hardened mass was still auto scrapping.  Oh well.
---
very different game and genre, but forza has an auction house function which works incredibly well. loads of filters to pick from too
---
This is what I did, went in blind into Fallout 2 after finishing 3 again. Completely sucked in.
---
Totally.  I think I mostly want to see them to officially recognize the community members who have put legit work into the game (I am *not* one of those people, lol)
---
&gt; First off, yes you should consider that, as the Austin team likely didn't want to be landed all of this hatred as their very first game 
---
How many times does it need to be said that all of Bethesda had a hand in making this game? Even goddamn Todd Howard publicly said so several times. And that's besides the point: any company not run by complete dipshits wouldn't hand one of their most valuable properties to their newest and least equipped division and go "We'll be back in a few years hope you don't fuck it up without any overeight k, bye."
---
What color is the one you are looking for? 
---
Any to be honest
---
so they take up space in your CAMP.  I can pacify them, but I cannot tame them because my CAMP is maxed out.  
---
I agree.... the FO76 Market sub seems to be dead....  (not Dead Yet!  I can still walk!  ) 
---
Is it just less people are engaged... who knows....
---
Vault 76 would both be the logical and the ideal choice IMO. Free fast travel point, and we're all "vault 76 dweller's returning to share our stories with our extended family".
---
yo it's not a human npc! 
---
I have a 1\* instigating pump action and 3 ranks of enforcer. I just keep shooting it until it lands then it's two or three hits to the dome with my all rise. Trying to re-perk into heavies though so that's going to change. 
---
That's just bethesda's way of reminding you that you really want to do PVP even if you don't know it yet.
---
It means they copy and pasted a bunch of stuff from fallout 4 without thinking about it. 
---
I had this happen with a buddy I met on Borderlands 2.  We played the crap out of that game, maxxing all the characters, and then put a lot of time into the Pre-Sequel which we didn't like as much but was still fun cooping.  Then he stopped logging on and I learned through mutual friends that he'd had a condition he kept private and had passed away in his sleep.  If I hadn't had those other folks to reach out to, I never would have known and just would have wondered about it forever.  Life goes on but enjoy the time you have with your bros.
---
I can begin with shell shock, atleast :) I went back to the place I got woopsies yesterday and I met a pack of glowing diseased rad-rats there, one of them gave me shell shock. I had no idea sludge lung was bugged, sorry to hear that. Buzz brain is from ants, not quite sure which of them or if all the diseased ones have a chance of giving it. Swamp gas I can't find anything on and can't quite remember but I am taking a shot in the dark here and recommending that event, Heart of the Swamp I think it's called, try checking if the gas the heart spits out can make you sick (100% unconfirmed though!), try not to walk in the water before you inhale the smoke from the heart because the water can infect you as well :P Jelly fingers I can't remember either, sorry :/ Lots of unknowns and unsures' from me now, but it's the best I can do I think :P
---
"Fine Art" is a huge scam of people with lots of money gatekeeping what art is worth money irrespective of the actually quality. Visiting those museums is helping to perpetuate the tax avoidance scam that "donating art" represents.
---
Shakespeare was considered low art of the time. Cheap theater and fart jokes.
---
You sound like a pretentious asshole, when the better argument is that those hundreds of hours could have been spent on a better game.
---
Jesus christ 3 months after the game is live and you're describing what you should be experiencing in a beta test. Not like FO76 actually had a beta test or anything, but hypothetically if they did actually do one. 
---
Something would be nice at this point.  I don't want this game to fall.  I'm willing to stick with it for years if they are.
---
I have only seen one mothman since I started playing weeks ago....never seen a single flatwoods monster.
---
Related to this, Pharma Farma is a great source of numerous Chems.  I'd say about a third of my income is from Purified Water, a third from excess Chems, and a third from bulking/selling junk I don't need.  Also, things that aren't bulked, like Silver, Waste Asbestos, etc. tend to add up over time and weigh a lot.
---
I have Rank 3 Hard Bargain.  I'm almost able to afford Signs and Letters at this point.  Not sure what will be my target purchase after that.  Maybe a jetpack.
---
Has anyone ever explained to you how god damned dumb you are?
---
This is very appreciated! Thank you for your work, if you play on PC I'd donate to the cause.
---
real life one fires faster I got to fire one during a Military history of firearms demo at a gun range.
---
honestly me and Shia play really late so our judgement calls aren't the best ...I believe our discussion in game went " I'm not seeing any deathclaws , it's likely a island shaped like a deathclaw ....run away run away "
---
Oh damn I guess I never checked that thoroughly. If I still had mine I would  have given it away but I gave it away already to a buddy of mine.
---
One of my friends quit playing so gave me the login, easiest way I've found to transfer gear.
---
Item cap is 45/50 depending on the item tier. For example a 10mm pistol will always be 45 never 50. Because level cap is 50. Like marine armor caps at 45 but combat armor caps at 50.
---
It‚Äôs protection so people don‚Äôt accidentally scrap them. I see what they‚Äôre trying to do, but they could easily give a second confirmation instead providing a solution to both issues like ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to scrap this Legendary [item]?‚Äù
---
Considered that, scrapped a bunch of stuff, so I have 26% of budget available.
---
You are correct but let‚Äôs see how many people will overlook this comment 
---
You must be new here. Welcome to fallout 76 "end game" where the only thing to do is grind for materials to grind for ammo to grind killing creatures to grind for a legendary that probably sucks that you can't sell or dismantle. Also there's scorch beasts. Have fun! 
---
Items drop depending on the level of the enemy you killed.  For instance, a level 42 legendary wendigo will only drop at maximum a level 40 legendary item.
---
Thanks God the pvp has the "return fire to enable" feature... Otherwise just imagine trying to vats the SBQ and instead you end up killing all friendlies by mistake... 
---
Might be a little late to reply to you...
---
But I just looked in the directory the game was installed in... all 30 or 40 gb of files were still there.
---
It wasn't in my add-remove list any more, but the uninstall process literally didn't remove any files.
---
Some people are downvoting any post that isn‚Äôt pure salt. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø
---
Crafting them requires the item itself in the recipe.  It allows you to just change the level (up or down) of the items.  I wish all quest rewards did this, allowing you not to be punished for doing the quest before 50.
---
I believe that Beth has come out and said they were looking into this issue of people selling/dropping these specific rewards for Mistress of Mystery.  It would be nice if they let us return to the mansion and do another quest (repeatable, Daily, Weekly maybe?) to craft another one from the machines that made them for us originally.
---
I'm with you 100% but no company bankrolled by a multinational corporation will be allowed to 'throw good money after bad'.
---
It punishes you for playing.
---
I tried crafting it a bunch in a row to see if Super Duper would trigger.  It did not :(  No Super Dupering Blades of Basset for me...
---
No. You can easily find those on Attack Dogs. It's not suggesting that we may geg a Dog companion in the future
---
I agree. Anything that is considered a ‚Äòboss‚Äô or ‚Äòtough‚Äô enemy (basically that makes the high threat combat music start to play) definitely need this. Why waste the time otherwise? I used most of my ammo and a good chunk of my stimpaks, if I was a new player there was no way I could‚Äôve done it myself and the reward would probably have made me ragequit.
---
I like your name. Think I've told you before.
---
Unfortunately no, I'm on PC.  P.S. it's not junk, ignores 100% of enemy's damage resistance, pretty decent in my books :)
---
I have a bunch of bos outfits . A couple of the jumpsuits, bos lab coat, engineers outfit, scribe, etc. looking for a tse handmade we can work something out if you‚Äôre interested. 
---
Hmm actually apparently I do a little more than I thought. By the way I'm still working on this build so I know there are things wrong with it.

---
That‚Äôs because brilliant AI isn‚Äôt any fun. What players want is *managed stupidity.*
---
It's not an exploit it's called having an understanding of the perk cards and Legendary modifiers.
---
Everyone needs to stop asking for nerfs and calling weapons "op" just because you don't know how to set up your characters perks. Google builds educate yourself. No more nerfs the game is almost unplayable without a melee weapon let's not make it worse.
---
Let's work on buffing guns!! I really want to go back to using a gun melee is boring AF I miss shooting things. 
---
Deal man. I‚Äôm on now 
---
Just got there myself and googled for help and you seem to be the only other person stuck on this too. Really annoying as it took me ages to clear this place and now 1 terminal remains a mystery :(
---
The "Science" perks are sufficiently oddly structured in comparison to similar perks that I suspect they may have been meant to function differently--perhaps this was what was supposed to give buffs to energy weapons originally?  It would explain some of the issues with energy weapons.
---
Alas no.  I returned to the mansion and there is no option to start the quest over or refabricate it.
---

Yes you need the original :(:(:(

Nope. Constantly told the opposite. Just because you don't know what you're talking about, don't assume everyone doesn't.

I just hope they aren‚Äôt discouraged by all the salt and the bile and stick with it. 
---
Are you guys aware of the parameters required to tame a creature?
---
-Must be a random encounter. 
---
-Must spawn ALONE 
---
-Must be half your level. 
---
Hope this helps. 
---
That would be nice.  Perhaps I'll go to their forum and sign (what I hope will be) the petition :)
---
That's a pretty big committment but starting to kind of be worth it :)
---
Agreed :(
---
It has a 50% at MC.
---
especially because the base field-of-view settings are such trash that binoculars are just weight-spam compared to scopes.
---
This, and each time a new player is nearby, you can approach the station and a new bot should spawn. I've had cases where 2-4 of the stations between the train station and Phoenix are spawning legendaries, and depending on server traffic, you can just chill there and mop them up. Especially after a SBQ fight. I usually try to be courteous with the "come over here!" emote so the person responsible for the spawn gets a crack at it too.
---
Why are you holding bulk items 
---
&gt;	A delayed game is eventually good, 
---
...or cancelled. Not everyone has the runway Miyamoto has. 
---
Hell of a*
---
You can play solo if you like.    
---
You'll get the periodic team invites, but you dont have to accept them.
---
Formal teaming (as oppposed to just walking along with another player) makes some things easier, some more difficult.
---
So far, I haven't run across a situation where teaming would be required to complete a task.
---
So what are the best ways to always find level +50 enemies?
---
When we all stop playing the game.
---
Gt PURE K OS
---
Don‚Äôt go against the narrative. You aren‚Äôt allowed to enjoy the game. 
---
I loaded and my CAMP next to some water couldn't be placed because someone was already there on that server- they had a tame Radtoad. Cool as hell next to a pond.
---
Dupers: Wipe the servers and reset everyone after dupe holes are closed. If you bought TSEs from people you don't know, you DO know they were duped. No sympathy.
---
Disappearing corpses: #1 bullshit bug right now and never occurred before this last "hotfix"
---
Loading in: 50% chance I will disconnect after my first "action" when loading in. Only work around I have is letting pip boy fully load before moving.
---
Disconnects/inability to rejoin servers: Oh you just spent an hour powering up Poseidon, taking Grafton Steel and Hemlock Holes? Nope, do it again you little bitch.
---
Rad worms: Random stats and carry weight are not fun. As a PS4 player, why are you not fucking patching PC as fast as you can. At least then I know what's coming to console.
---
i used to have my camp right next to one, it was neat to watch them launch. This was in the Divide, between the bee on the map and a chem trailer that is a marked location, can't remember the name though. It was just south of the trailer. 
---
I‚Äôm sure I remember playing a game where PvP was somewhat level locked. If a player was within 5 or so levels of you, they were a ‚Äòworthy opponent‚Äô and either of you could kill the other for their bounty without penalty and with rewards on both sides. It encouraged a bounty hunter/criminal kinda gameplay, because the ‚Äòbad guys‚Äô would get various rewards for each person they killed or each item they stole, as well as exp. They had to pay the bounty from their own funds, but it was difficult to rack up a bounty higher than the value of what you earned. It was usually pretty even - the exp was the ‚Äòpermanent‚Äô reward, and if you could shake the bounty you got the spoils too. 
---
You chose role with very visible flags that changed the appearance of your character and gave you various skills and allegiances. Everything was balanced around risk/reward, could be done solo or in groups, and the best PvP was always unexpected. 
---
Higher levels could attack low levels but would generally get nothing for it, only an increase to their bounty. If a high level hunter killed a low level ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô, they get nothing and the bounty didn‚Äôt ‚Äòclaim‚Äô. 
---
If I remember right, this game didn‚Äôt have a hard level cap either. It was based around skill/spell trees rather than hard levelling, but to hit certain zones you realistically needed to be a certain level so as not to be 1-shot by the monsters. Generally meant people in your area were your level, and you knew where to go if you wanted a fight. Also made lower level zones a haven for higher levels wanting a break from the ‚Äòfront lines‚Äô, encouraging the lowbies to carry on. Many sold very cheap gear/potions in the starting areas just to help people out. 
---
Annoying how well I remember the game but can‚Äôt for the life of me remember what it was called. 
---
I‚Äôll be on in 15
---
They're way to busy debugging patches by typing with their elbows.
---
I'm sorry but this viewpoint is a very detracting and oversimplified way to look at the situation.
---
Most of time, it depends on who loads the area first.  I spend 99% of my time farming the watoga area. If I'm the one that loads the area (level 196) the bots will be max level.  The bots are mostly level 50(protections) and 52(gutsys).  Farming robots, I found, was the easiest way to get high level legendaries.  You can also find max level scorch and super Mutants in the cranberry bog area that can drop some good loot.
---
I balance that out, or attempt to, by downvoting salt and upvoting help.
---
I understand :)
---
i've only ever had 1 or 2 three stars drop for me and both were from WS nuke runs. 
---
Dear lord, are you Turtle?
---
Am on this quest also. Have gotten as far as the 4th transponder a few times before realizing you didn't have to hit them all again when the quest resets because of lost con, relogging, etc. Going to have to try to get to the cave again tonight. Last couple of runs have been met with skys swarming with SB or nukes launched on the SBQ.
---
Kuthorn on XBox.
---
They need to do a full reset to get rid of all the duped weapons.
---
Every Youtuber has one. It is fucking pathetic.
---
Close the dupe holes and reset everyone.  This was clearly a beta test.
---
One of the many QOL features that should be in the game but just isn't for no good reason. 
---
have you done this on a tamed mongrel?
---
As an explosive build that never used an explosive legendary, why the fuck did they nerf my perk?
---
Correct, the "Twisted Muscles" mutation says it increases melee damage and it increases unarmed as well.  "Melee" includes unarmed while "Unarmed" excludes 1h and 2h.
---
&gt; Of course an high level probably will have overall better equipment
---
Well this wouldn't still justify higher level losing more caps, because you can be level 50 and still have "best in slot" equipment. Another fundamental flaw of the game. Now I understand why people are rolling new characters for PVP.   
---
*^(I hoarded cat-meat in Fallout 4.)*
---
Maybe I should apply to bethesda, obviously don't need much experience. I'm sure I could do a better job balancing the weapons on my first day there than they have so far. 
---
i came across a behemoth at the pylon in the bog the other day. I was just exploring the map and did not expect that. Quite a fight though, lol
---
You have been boned already.
---
Really? The fucking atomic shop is what you are complaining about? Jesus.
---
Eh no big deal more stuff will be added in time. 
---
This is how they disavow all this shit to beg people to buy Fallout 5.
---
Them hitting the perk card was just sadism.
---
I've never had an explosive legendary, but my explosive character is an awesome tickler now.
---
r/market76
---
I had the same bug earlier this week. Both lockpick and hack bumped from 2 to 3. When I logged back on the next day,  both returned to normal. 
---
RE: Watoga In addition to the loop around/between the vendor bots, I usually head west along the north edge of the city to the NW corner, then head south two blocks, then back east along the road toward Phoenix. I think this passes by at least 10 more bot stations. There's often already a live bot spawned near some of them, and then they'll spawn another when you approach. This route still misses a few, but its pretty clear and simple and it avoids backtracking. I skip this part of the loop if any of the bot stations are spawning low level bots.
---
Adding Barbie-style furniture instead of raider or BOS-themed items
---
Literally every other post is already complaining about everything else, let the man complain about what he wants
---
The best gun I ever got was a Handmade with the furious mod (Like the Problem Solver from FO4) Great gun, but I've been using it for months and I'm sick of it. Legendary enemies barely drop anything of interest for me, most of the time it's an exterminators armor piece.
---
People tell you that you‚Äôre smart? Who the fuck does that after you‚Äôre 6?
---
Just because something is even more shitty doesn't make the grind here fun.
---
Why even bother? They are actively gutting anything enjoyable in the game. The decent loot is almost impossible to find, and it helps cut down on their grind any, they'll just nerf it anyways.
---
V.A.T.S. Stands for ‚ÄúVery Awful Targeting System.‚Äù
---
Thanks to Bethesda Austin.
---
There‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre base was leveled and you only got 5 caps for killing the person. It is 10 caps for every item destroyed and 5 for picking locks. If he leveled your base he would have had 100-1000 cap bounty depending on how much stuff you had. 
---
Stop lying to get your point across. 
---
How the fuck do you have the patience and resiliency to level upto 300? Holy cow I'm level 67 and it's become a huge slog.
---
If you look at the "known issues" list, there are a bunch that are flagged to be fixed next patch
---
I said this elsewhere, but being able to point out something else you think is worse doesn't make this good.
---
Remind me, though, was Runescape a $60 AAA game?
---
This is the best punctuation that you‚Äôre getting. With the Learning disability I have so feel free to make copy paste and fix if you would like 
---
If you edit your character's face to the size of a pug, you can make it fit.
---
But that isn't true at all. You will find a ton of people that think that fortnite is shit. But you will still find a lot of people streaming it. Either one doesn't' make the game good or shit.  Fallout games in general are not stream material. 
---
The caps for the bounty come out of the persons caps. If they have no caps or few caps you get what they have and they get a bankruptcy debuff. 
---
I feel like Fallout 76 was made with every single possible annoyance in mind to test how big of a fan of the series you truly are.
---
I'll put them on for 500 caps don't be taken by this guy!
---
&gt;A Bomber Jacket (not the BoS one just the jacket, nor the Vault Tec)
---
Can you help me with the difference?  I just got a Bomber Jacket yesterday from turning in Technical Data at the BoS Camp Venture.  Is that not the one you are looking for?
---
Having fun with a game doesn't means it's very flawed / broken. I enjoyed the game Paladins after all, but I still can recognize it's a flawed game with lots of bugs.   
---
So yeah, there's always going to be people that enjoy a game regardless of how bad it is (there was a very dedicated "Radical Heights" community before the studio closed for example), and that is fine. But to say "there's nothing wrong with the game because there's people that enjoy it" is not a good argument at all. 
---
When you see people who have never played the game calling it a shitty game. That is game bashing and it is fairly common on r/Fallout
---
I did some server hopping at the flooded trainyard a few days ago with no luck. I'll try the others as well, thanks!
---
R&amp;G (Silo Charlie) had always a legendary for me. You should check it out.
---
and who is to say your not going to take someones 500 caps, and give them nothing in return.
---
Yes and the debuff is significant, it makes them a noodle in terms of damage and armor. The only people with no caps are noobs and if you have your CAMP out in the open where noobs can get to it of course you‚Äôre going to get griefed. 
---
I keep my camp in the woods and I never have a problem. 
---
My handmade with the furious legendary starts at 94 per hit and goes up from there after every consecutive hit.
---
What reason do you see for both the numerous XP nerfs, in addition to higher level players losing more caps than lower level players despite no power gap existing past level 50?
---
And you'll let the dev team know?  Lol
---
I get ya, i think people and myself have responded that way, because  saying how bad something else has been before doesn't bring any relevant argument to the current discussion.
---
 If you elaborated a bit much on what was the point you're trying to make then maybe it wouldn't be misinterprested as much.
---
Eh, as far as I can discern, it's actually because illicit drugs (in particular heroin) was called junk. Thus, the users are junkies. 
---
Have you restarted computer since?
---
I don't play the raw damage game.  I have some Vampire knives and use bullet sponges like Super Mutants to keep my HP topped off, which feeds into my Vanguard armor.
---
My main weapon is a 3\* knife that only does about 110.  But it hits almost as fast as I can mash the button and does 2x damage on the first hit.  There's a pretty high chance that most enemies will outright die if my first hit is a power attack and they have full health.  At worst, it will bring the highest-level Super Mutants down to about 10% HP left.  I basically have the touch-of-death for all the robots in Watoga.
---
If Bethesda nerfs melee in the future, I'm pretty sure I'll still be resilient because I'm not relying on the builds that take players into the 1,000s.  Whether it takes 3 stabs or 5, doesn't make a big difference to me.
---
You'll hear no argument from me if someone wanted guns to be buffed up, though.  The amount of bullets typical gunners have to expend, only for me to come in and drop the enemy in one shot, is pretty ridiculous.
---
yeppers I'm turtle , me and Shia are likely the slowest players of  fallout 76 aka the filthiest of casuals and only played when the other one did and while we are well aware of the bugs I think we just got lucky and they affected our PC gameplay less than some others . I should point out Shia is a bit of a drawing  and art machine as they work on a paetron daily strip about a chibi deathclaw , doing commission work and making time to watercolor one of these each night for 76 nights  and duo the game with me for a hour or two  . (Shia  is the best but um keep that to yourself ) 
---
Right? I'm astounded by their quality, and they still hold up as solid games, even today.
---
Not just theoretically -- with the exception of a few perk cards that are level gated, a level 50 is the same as a level 300. In most games, when you level up, you get some additional HP or resistances or something. Not in FO76. And given the prevalence of duping that Bethesda didn't do anything about for weeks, chances are that level 50 is just as well geared.
---
PVP rewards against players need to be equalized as well. I'm level 225 and I run in pacifist mode, and when someone kills me, I have to change servers or else I'll end up bankrupt.
---
If you put it in perspective you probably have spent server/vendor hopping as long as it would take you to run the quest with an alt and you have little to show for your time.
---
Besides, if you pick up the right perks - by lvl 11 which takes mere hours, you can have travelling pharmacy, pack rat and thru-hiker which allows you to store quite a bit of stuff - you can have a mule.
---
It is risky but when I started playing the game I did in a pinch 'mule with myself' by using a world container with no weight restriction in a remote location - of which are many - and keeping track of who was in my lobby to rejoin. 
---
Yes let‚Äôs all complain about Bethesda‚Äôs micro transactions store not having enough stuff, matter fact let‚Äôs complain that the micro transaction store doesn‚Äôt have any items that provide an in-game advantage. 
---
Out of all the things that are ruining this game he‚Äôs complaining about not having enough micro transactions. 
---
Thought I would give it some more love nothing wrong with that üëç
---
That would be poor competitive business. I'll do one leg for 500 or both for 800 caps.
---
This isn't about griefers.  I only used my base to test this out. It's about how the game will show some huge bounty despite the person not having the caps. I know a few people who regularly try and get high bounties and spend all there caps so people dont get any off them. 
---
That is absolutely not what I am saying. What I am saying is the same crowd who used to crow that Fortnite was #1 on Twitch look how amazing it is are the same crowd that will now say 'Well Twitch viewership is not representative' now that Apex is around.
---
The exact same as happened here. 'Omg this sub is so positive what a good beacon of the community' to 'Guys it's literally Reddit no one here actually matters'.
---
yo he probably pressed drop instead of activate lol. I think I might have made that mistake once but uh, that guy will never do that again lol. 
---
Many people who go to the trouble of launching advertise first. If you want to join a discord and are on PC hit me up! We do group runs! 
---
True, appreciate the advice. :)
---
I've had that happen with the prize bot. It has given me my prize winnings, and I also watch as ammo is removed. Weird.
---
Charleston station. Every time i hop to try and get the rare vendorbot there, i run across the bride- probaly 3/4 of the time a grafton mosnter will spawn. Back across the bridge to get the encounter spawn to try and get the robot. Rinse and repeat.  
---
I‚Äôve never had this issue.
---
You aren't losing ammo.  Every time you fire a weapon, the game periodically updates your ammo quantities.  These messages are normally hidden.  But if you pick up or acquire other items at the same time, the message log will momentarily be visible, and the "ammo removed" message will be seen.
---
Next time, try cross-posting it in another subreddit, or at least wait more than a day before reposting it.
---
Its like everyone forgets a good story and tons of npcs were at least at launch for eso imo.
---
What color isBOS one? I bought the vault Tec one from atom store and it is brown..one of my favorites
---
You don't to searching, you go to X location and server hop until there is tamable monster. If monster is at X location and can't tame, then your level might be too low. I wasn't able to tame level 90 albino Deathclaw, but I was able to tame level 40 Deathclaw. 
---
I have seen one player mentioning that you can have one monster per skill- Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer, but as far as I know, when you meet tameable monster, there is prompt "Tame Monster" or something like that, when you aim at him. After you tame him, he walks to your base, but I don't remember if you had to give him command or he started walking to your base right after taming him. When you have one monster in base and tame other one, there is new prompt:"Taming this monster, will make one in your base leave" or something like that
---
So am I, often when I pick vegetables...
---
I's written at the top left of the screen that ammo is removed
---
I have which is why I dont go after bounties anymore. It's never been worth the time 
---
Did you see that tantalizing offer yesterday for the what was it half price croquet mallet? Just what I always wanted. Not.
---
There are only 4 settings in that menu. Invert Y, Look Sensitivity, Vibration and Controller. It will not scroll up or down beyond these four. Looked in every menu and it's not there.
---
Where do you find legendary robots in watoga? I walk the streets there and never see legendary or gutsy.
---
Drills, when modded up and repaired to 200 percent, wreck. When they fall below 150 repair or so they stop wrecking. Ditto chainsaw and Mr handy buzz blade 
---
Never said it wasn't flawed, yea there still some glitches but I dare you to name an mmorpg that didnt have a bunch of glitches on release. They all have glitches, plus in these most recent patches most of the bugs are fixed, and I rarely get disconnected.. like extremely rare. No more blue screen crashes. And btw this is my first fallout I'm not apart of some cult following from the first fallout 
---
I ran around with all the mutations for a while, but honestly it's better to just buy the specific serums on the trade subs now that they're fairly cheap and get exactly what you want.
---
Hey man I'm dyslexic, I was just poking a bit of fun. That's all. :)
---
Suggest a copy and paste of coding 
---
It will be 700 atoms for that bone though, maybe more
---
The jacket looks like a dirty brownish-tan?  But the bodysuit under it is almost a pink (or is it salmon?) with white.  I don‚Äôt like the look too much.  
---
Sounds right but this happened when I had just started the game....spawned into my base and went out collecting wood ...not a bullet fired
---
I just love how so many people complain and hate on this game.. mean while you all play it lol.. and deep down you love it
---
Thx
---
It's not  Melee being op, it's just guns being too weak. I ceep telling Bethesda that every week via ticket feedback.  Just think about it. By guns u invest a ridicoulus amount of bullets to get things down and get NOTHING but crappy Loot for it. Melee is not my only Charakter I'm playing, so I know what I'm talking about. Having a Gunslinger, shotgun build, medic and a commando build also. 
---
EA will never go away. Only thing to do is support them when they release something right.
---
My go-to is a lvl 45 furious handmade with increased rate of fire, it's basically carried me through the game and I have yet to find a more consistent weapon. I feel like furious is really only good on high rate of fire weapons 
---
You supply mats?   Or the customer?
---
To slow down players because Bethesda believes people are leveling too quickly.
---
And to prevent griefers. I agree that it's not the best way to do it, but it *does* prevent people from wanting to grief. Whether you think so or not, more levels = more time played = more chances for better and more refined loot.
---
The difference between a level 50 and a level 200 is many hours of gameplay, farming, and making stat/character efficient choices.
---
Btw, if they keep up nerfing things into the ground, they will loose even more players, all that will remain are people like u, constantly whinning about things being "op" and need to be nerfed ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm still enjoying the game..my rare outfit collection is growing 
---
The old glitch is back. Happened like 2 months ago. When you picked up anything, from quest items to food, it would say you you lost a few shots of some ammo. You don't lose the ammo, it's just a old glitch that's popped back up.
---
&gt; Fuck the legendary loot tables so hard.
---
Dear god you just brought back Nam-style flashbacks while playing The Division when it first came out. 
---
Yeah, having caps tied to levels is absurd.
---
I can understand maybe having a max of 75 caps for a level 75 player, but not a single cap higher than that.
---
By level 75 you should have a fully fleshed out PVP character with all the appropriate perks.  Going higher levels than that doesn't make you more powerful.  Most picks after level 75 are utility perks (white knight, fix it good, etc).
---
&gt;If that was the case everyone would be kicked out at the same time.
---
Not necessarily. If the whole server (software) crash then yeah, every one will get kicked out. But the server could very well have some bugs that leads to disconnecting individual players. A race condition somewhere that triggers once in a while would give you that effect.
---
or do what TONS of other games do and you "star/lock" it from being scrappable. 
---
"simple problems require simple solutions"
---
I server hopped whitespring all last night did not get one blast zone
---
I‚Äôm around level 140 and I‚Äôve for the most part would see guys ranging 50 -98 the ocasional 168 but who knows what obviously low level area would only spawn 5 or 15 with a crown at most.
---
Glowing radiant ones with a green aura seem to yield better loot 
---
Sorry if a color change is Soooo hard, then this game is beyond broken. There are a 1000 things this game needs just to be a mediocre game and those fixes are likely harder to accomplish than a recolor.
---
It was like he was in it, fighting me. Then disconnected by that bus.
---
Well maybe 
---
I think if you haven‚Äôt pitched the veil you could still get into ravendale to fab or redo quest line?
---
The tattered dress quest started the order
---
Maybe if you could make another garb you should be able to remake or redo
---
I don‚Äôt even play the game anymore it‚Äôs a pile of shit, melee is way more overpowered than any other build. It‚Äôs the truth and everyone agrees it‚Äôs just that you melee builds don‚Äôt like to admit that you have a huge advantage over other players.
---
Sorry but you aren‚Äôt good because you can one-shot every player and it takes 4 hits for them to kill you. 
---
I just want the handmade interested? I‚Äôll be online in about an hour I have plenty goodies as well 
---
In the best manner of thread necrosity, thanks for pointing out the connection between RadX and disease resistance, having Vaccinated 3\* I was confused as to the frequency I was becoming infected, of course RadX runs a long time and removes the benefit of the Vaccinated perk, so I now have 3 perk points to play with, now that card is removed, as a melee character RadX is essential.
---
Cheers.
---
Oh I lost the ammo... wasn't much but it took it...the only reason I know for sure is because I didn't have much of it to begin with
---
A designer may have intended for unarmed PA to be useful, given the available PA Arm mods. I'd really appreciate more variety, since three of the four are unarmed specific:
---
Hydraulic bracers - Increased Unarmed Damage.
---
Rusty knuckles - Unarmed attacks cause bleeding damage.
---
Tesla bracers - Adds Energy damage to Unarmed attacks.
---
Optimized bracers - Reduces Action Point cost for power attacks.
---
As is, I'll always go with Optimized or else not even bother.
---
You went into the terminal that makes the gear?
---
&gt; It's not like we can buy weapon drops with microtransactions
---
Not yet.
---
Added 
---
Yeah, I'm not THAT per se. Just wanted to see if an extractor worked on the surface as such more than anything.
---
&gt; game. That is game bashing and it is fairly common on 
---
Yes that does happen hear and on /r/fallout but those aren't the post (at least here) that get onto the front page. They'll sit on /new with 4 upvotes at best.
---
This makes me laugh, because there's so many posts where people complain about how the only new stuff put in the game is the Atomic Shop. 
---
"Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
---
I have been server hopping multiple times to Whitesprings golf club and have picked up countless legendary (mainly 1&amp;2* but the occasional 3*) items the last few nights. I do feel a little bit dirty each time, and the lag on loading is terrible, but it‚Äôs been quite fruitful. Mainly bloated scorched, but did have protectron‚Äôs spawning once last night. Am massively overencumbered, so very slowly dragging my loot around ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò¨
---
lol this is one of the most posted about things in random threads lol. I don't understand.
---
Yo use a fletchling harpoon gun and don't miss; you never loose ammo. That was in fallout 4, screw it though its OP nerf that shit
---
You can't put out patches that fast for Xbox and PS4. Those companies do like that. 
---
And some space on the hard drive 
---
Or stability 
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request. 
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited or however high they can get it (1,000, 10,000, etc). It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
I think a simpler solution. You just have the fabricator make you a new one, provided you don't have one in your inventory. At the lowest level. Then you can craft it up if you want. 
---
i have over 260 hours in the game, fought many legendary 3* adversaries, and still haven't been rewarded with a TSE weapon. but they're too weak now since the last update. 
---
I'm skeptical that the "reconnect to last server" is ever going to happen.  I have a sneaky suspicion that this is because the "last server" isn't there anymore because it crashed.  It just tells us we've disconnected because that is better PR than "our server crashed because we've made questionable programming decisions regarding database management".
---
A dark cola rum should fix that....oh wait
---
Please raise damage no more grind 
---
Good info!  
---
Going to add the Disease issues on a "Player" page, trying to avoid both Character limit per page and information overload!
---
*shrug*  
---
You could be correct, but comments like this are likely why Bethesda refuses to comment or even Acknowledge work done by the community now.
---
I got them. I appreciate everyones feedback though. 
---
Exiting is the only way to really 'pause' the game but I believe after most actions it autosaves..like if u just picked up loot etc
---
That's what I figured. The %50 AP is a huge boost and I am hoping that I can find a 3\* WR with Anti-Armor. That particular effect isn't as useful for other weapon builds since they can perk armor pen but for pistols it rises towards the top in my opinion.
---
Make it so "Daily" quest aren't map specific.  I hate doing 90% of a daily, get disconnected and lose that quest completely.  A daily quest isn't an event, why can't it stay with me on a new map?
---
Start one instance from the launcher and the other from the executable in the games folder.
---
The second will prompt for account login and you can enter your second account. It works for me quite well. 
---
omg: FOUR deaths in a row for me the other night while Waiting in load screens, forced to listen to my character getting attacked. Then when I finally loaded in and put my PA on, Those failed loads must‚Äôve created bugged PA, I literally could not take a hit. Then I noticed every time I fast travelled it would unequip my PA left leg... I logged out, logged back in to see if it would resolve, no luck, so I did my freakin taxes bc, *are you listening Bethesda* doing my taxes was more fun than trying to play your damn game.  
---
I‚Äôve got lvl 3 hack, I‚Äôm sure my build is shit. One of the traders saw my armor last night and he was like ‚Äúdude why are you wearing that armor‚Äù my dude is all over the place. I couldn‚Äôt find the terminal to turn off the control room turrets, and all the terminals in the silo take 50 seconds to load the next option screen on my PS4 the lag is so bad. And I‚Äôve got fast cable internet. 
---
The fact is they OP is right there are discussions that don't' get a lot of replies. And most of the people that like to shit on this game seem very reluctant to reply to comments.  When you get called a faggot for asking for proof that innocent people are being banned because they are crafting ammo to fast. Kind of helps support that.   
---
People aren't interested in discussion what they want to do is bitch. Or just farm karma. 
---
Other games have glitches, yes, but the problem is that the glitches are not the only problem, but all the other flaws as well that are not bugs:
---
*For starters, for leave bugs out the equation, there's still plenty of glitches and bugs, including some game breaking like dupping items. And they are present despite Bethesda has been using the same engine for a decade now... At this point, the amount of glitches and bugs should be minimal. It is not.  
---
* Prevalent grieffing because of the flawed PvP system (someone can start taking your camp, cancel that, and then attack you since you have been flawed for PvP for name one example). 
---
*Terrible enemy AI, since they don't have an AI. All they do is rush in bee line to you and shoot / attack, if their path-finding doesn't bugs out.  
---
*3 star enemies dropping shitty loot or no loot at all, making it so doing a great effort = shitty reward.  
---
*No end game whatsoever.  
---
* Dubious balancing that's all over the place and that turns a build that was strong into trash.  
---
And all that's just thinking from the top of my head. Not to mention, you can read people complaining if this same problems on this subreddit, so it is not like I'm the first one saying it. So yeah, the game is flawed if looking only at the bugs, and extremely flawed / broken if you look at the whole myriad of problems. 
---
Kudos to you if you enjoy the game, but reality is that it is not close to be a "good" game. 
---
Roger that my friend.  I moved from active to inactive status recently, due to frustration, but I still wish the game could become good and be fixed mechanically, so thought I‚Äôd share.
---
One other helpful thing to incorporate if you are up for it:
---
[Rad Worm Bugs (Mutations, Perks, Magazines, Bobbleheads, Food, etc)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amermo/bethesda_bug_rad_worms/?st=JS1YPYRI&amp;sh=13c0cf9c) 
---
Did you get the tape that's at the top of the locked elevator in a certain brotherhood location?
---
I don't remember completing the quest well, but "I think" it just kinda went away after I got the last tape.  There wasn't any big "quest completed" thing.  Just checked the pip boy and the quest line was listed under the "completed" area.
---
It's not actually hard though. The enemies are just bullet sponges.
---
And there is zero reward for dumping all that ammo into an enemy. Killing things is neither all that fun, and it's literally a waste of steel and lard in game.
---
Really? It made it to the front page several times about players being banned for just crafting items. with no proof. 
---
After the blast zone ends it seems the nuked flora is still there for a couple more hours 
---
Added and reported.
---
Sometimes I look for low level players near the vault who have just came out of the vault to give them water, stims and food to help them out
---
Speaking of binoculars... I would appreciate an overall reduction in sway. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trying to stabilise a six foot-long gauss rifle. 
---
**Honestly agree 100%!**    
---
However since people keep disagreeing with what is a "Suggestion" or a "Bug" I figured QoL was a good spot for it.
---
I didn't hack or lockpick much either and it felt fine.
---
As a relatively new player, thank you for your post. I'd like to see more posts like this one, targeted to new players, instead of so much moaning about loot and negativity.
---
Sometimes the benches "un-link" to your stash.  Go open your stash then try crafting again.
---
If that doesn't work put all the screws in your stash.
---
If that doesn't work put all the screws (and the other items you need to craft whatever) on your character.
---
Those 3 solutions fix 95% of the problems.

I figured he fucked up his set up so he dropped his armor fast traveled outta there and thats why the buddy sticks around to protect. but uh, I don't know dude, I rewatched n now I got chills. it's not even half as funny if it isn't their fault though
---
I was wondering the same, until I started a melee character. 
---
I enjoy base building, so I look forward to seeing what is new each week. There's nothing new, so I'm disappointed. Seeming more and more like Bethesda is down to one intern in a basement working on this game. At this point, they need to just hand the game over to the modders and create a crazy playground. 
---
So are the silos different? I did A solo at level 69.
---
I have about 2000 atom shop points saved up, so your point is not applicable. 
---
Its kind of a work around, kind of a pain.
---
Before I leave my pip-boy menu, I put the selection cursor on my PA suit, so that when ship hits the fan all I have to do is open the pip boy and hit place as the cursor is already highlighting my PA. It saves having to go through each menu and find the PA frame you want, the biggest issue is you have to set it up that way every time before you exit the pipboy.

Example of When a Hard Grind is OK = Pretty much every old school RPG where you play a magic user and get destroyed for 3/4 of the game only to become incredibly powerful.  Legends of Kesmai is a great example.
---
Example of When a Hard Grind is Not OK = Killing 40,000 3 star legendary enemies in FO76 to get a gun only to discover there's nothing worth shooting with said gun.
---
I went yesterday for the first time, it wasn't looted, so I assumed nobody inch the server cleaned up,  but I only found two ghouls inside. It was really empty. 
---
Strangely, I was ready for a fight to the teeth, but nothing jumped at me.
---
But all those skeletons where creepy. 
---
In the same boat....    
---
After a couple hours wasted trying to do WhiteSprings, then a Queen that refused to load after 12 minutes, I packed it in.  
---
 I am willing to bet significant sums of money the :Loading" we are seeing due to a memory leak on a server controlling the "World Instances" that won't be resolved until we have downtime. 
---
I understood your claim and thought I had covered it when I stated ‚ÄúI‚Äôve also tested by allowing the mob to heal‚Äù. Apologies if my language was unclear, but I did not ‚Äúconveniently‚Äù ignore anything. Your claim is still incorrect. 
---
They nerfed the legendary drops so they no longer scale to your level.
---
This sucks.  It makes some events like Uranium Fever completely useless to people who are level 50 or above.
---
They need to undo the nerf.  The legendary drops were already bad and the nerf just made it worse.
---
Huge huge huge fan of you two.
---
I've introduced a bunch of my friends to your series and we make constant toilet paper references to repeat plans...
---
Sometimes you can find a wendigo inside and you can here it while exploring the place. All of a sudden he jumps out of nowhere, quit creepy 
---
They weren't right, they were just being assholes for the sake of being assholes.
---
The game had promise, and most of us willing to give the game a chance saw that.
---
Bethesda just gave up.
---
If you have less than 11 points in strength, putting on power armor does indeed improve melee damage.  If you have 11 or more, it for sure does not.  Also, optimized bracers does NOT reduce AP cost for heavy attacks.  Perhaps it lowers fusion core drain, but for sure not AP cost.
---
Lol I got randomly sniped by someone doing this and I could not understand how he did it without slapping first. 
---
How do you lose caps in PvP? I thought only wanted people lose caps... normal PvP is accepted PvP by both players and that wouldn't make anyone wanted, right?
---
If my assumption is correct, the whole system just stops griefing, not PvP.
---
I've taken some workshops from other people without losing caps. I didn't lose anything when they killed me and I didn't become wanted by defending the workshop during the capturing or afterwards.
---
Just because they didn't provide proof doesn't mean they've never played the game.
---
How much time have you spent playing?  I looked past the flaws for a hundred hours or so, every Beth game had them.  I dragged on another hundred hours or so waiting for them to be fixed.  I no longer play, still waiting for fixes and content.
---
That's pretty much my suggestion (the machine in the mansion).
---
I only suggested it be a daily or weekly (not even sure a weekly quest is a thing, beyond challenges) quest, collect the component items, make item in fabricator, same as original quest.  Just so you weren't creating, then trading, then creating, then trading, constantly.  
---
I'd rather they spend that money on adding new content.
---
Getting 100 people out there for half a week would cost them $2,000 per person (food, lodging, air travel, car rental, etc), or $200,000 total.
---
That's 2-3 developer salaries for a YEAR of work.
---
Nice idea, but not going to help the game out.
---
I‚Äôd be happy just to play...
---
I logged in last night after taking a break, spawned at the munitions workshop so decided to claim it. 
---
Not even 5 minutes after I spend the caps to claim it the server disconnects and I get kicked. 
---
Bye bye workshop. 
---
Back to ESO I go. 
---
I have a nice weightless marine leg (also agi and reduced junk weight) but it interferes with chameleon mutation.  Is this a know bug?  Would be nice to have true zero weight armor on my sniper.
---
People like you are the reason why I still have hope for this game, and why I still love this community despite all its infighting.
---
I'm sorry that you're starting to get burnt out - I understand how tough it must be, between the work that you put in and the state of the game. However you decide to move forward, please put your own health and happiness first; at the end of the day, that's the most important thing.
---
Here's hoping that things will get better - for the game, for the community, and above all, for you.
---
You're right, at the time, i was just checking it to just see if i damaged it. Then i noticed the transfer option. I was shocked. Anyhow, they fixed the whole dropping power armour and others being able to take it. Unless when they rolled back that update, and the lockpins weights changed back, this rebroke again too. Back in the beginning you could drop other people full sets, along with paint jobs on them from the atomic shop.
---
Can't help but think this happened.
---
Dev team works hard for a couple years developing the framework for Fo76.
---
Dev team informed management that progress is doing well and that they will have a most ER hit ready for release Q4 2019.
---
Management says no fucken way get that shit ready for Nov 2018 release so we can cash in of Xmas sales.
---
Dev team has epic WTF moment and they have a secret meeting.
---
They look at all the options but they know it will not work, the game is simply not ready.
---
They start elimating any in game systems that are  overly buggy, eliminate human NPCs as it take up to much time. Create bare bones storyline to cover for no humans. 
---
Dev know this will be an epic bomb and that they will like be blamed for everything by the same execs that forced the new release date.
---
Major players on dev team start looking for new jobs before fo76 even releases.
---
1 month after release dev team is crippled and Beth must hire new people and it will take them months to get up to speed.
---
Push Atomic Store sells.
---
Release patches that the new dev team do not fully understand. Break more stuff requiring hotfix that break even more stuff requiring more hotfixs. 
---
Bandaid fix for stash, Bobby pins and now SBs. 
---
Push Atomic store sells.
---
Don't expect anything meaningful till around the 6 month post release period.

You're also level 300 apparently, which is ridiculous. Which means you are also a TON more experienced especially since you say you do a lot of PVP (which most of the player base doesn't do in my experience). You should have this risk.
---
There are much better melee weapons out there than that trash sword.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits and see what other players have available.  I see people selling wide varieties of weapons all day every day.
---
haha...yeah i have an explosive flamer...rare yes..fun, yes, but its not worth the ammo given the small dmg.
---
paints that apply for ALL armor and weapons (rather than just specific armors/weapons) is a MAJOR lost opportunity for Bethesda.
---
Found some pictures:

---
To me, the trimming on the undersuit looks kind of pink-ish.  Not very good to me.
---
Nah brah. All unarmed is melee but not all melee is unarmed. Unarmed even benefits from melee and unarmed bobbleheads but you can't you both at once so you'd almost always prefer unarmed bobbleheads as they do 30% more to the melee bobbleheads 20%.
---
&gt; Which is horribly dehumanizing for those who suffer from addiction
---
As someone who's both parents were on h his entire life and who did his own little vacation with the stuff - words are nowhere near as dehumanizing as the drugs themselves are. Once you've had to dig in your own ass because you haven't shit in almost 2 weeks "junkies" or other words dont quite have any weight behind them. 
---
It's not 'pretty much universally' anything. You have universality, and you have no universality. There is no 'pretty much'. Don't try to bend words to suit your disposition. xD
---
And my point stands. It's content. You don't like it? Your choice. But don't pretend it doesn't exist, that just makes you seem like you can't take reality. 
---
Last word: Most of 76's content is not filler quests. Most of the content is locations, which clearly outnumber repeatable quests (and you claim I don't have a good understanding of the game, rofl). If you want to keep ignoring reality because you don't like it, cool, but don't bother replying-- I block idiots fast these days. ;)
---
About 1k damage at 50% hp . No real need to go higher against normal enemies
---
Has anyone tried taming a mongrel and seeing if they can equip it?
---
Thank you, honestly...  
---
I got into modding a few years ago, after playing some Fallout 4, and was blown away by how amazing the Community was (and can still be) and the general "Inclusiveness" Bethesda showed by releasing tools for us to use.  
---
That is what keeps me invested, and I'm just hoping we see a 180 soon.  
---
i think Camden Park should be up there under dailies. it's my understanding that you should get one of the three per day. i do not get them daily, and when i do, they don't always give out Mr. Fuzzy Tokens, even though i complete the quest.
---
It can complete, mine did. However the holotapes are still all quest items I can't get rid of. 
---
Hmm, strange! I was hunting a player with a bounty and when I shot him I got wanted myself.. This has happend several times to both me and my friend before too. 
---
The **Death Blossoms** event will reward non-participants with corpse flower staments too. Not sure it is really server-wide or just random people get it.
---
**The Messenger (any location)**: the robot may glitch out on rocks, foliage, guardrail, etc. and stops moving. Since it is not damageable by the player, it is not possible to melee it out of this state. However, sometimes the environment will attack the robot and toss it a bit around so it may unglitch (and reglitch after a few feet).
---
**Power up Poseidon**: fast traveling to the quest marker won't trigger the quest. Fast traveling to it again from the workshop often places the player in the dried up river bed, where one has to run around to get back up to the NPP and possibly leave the event area in the process to do the whole thing over again.
---
I'm starting to lose faith in each upcoming patch.
---
I keep thinking "oh there will be some content in this one FOR SURE".
---
Then the patch comes out and it's nothing but bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL stuff.  They try to fix so many bugs that they create MORE bugs in the process.
---
My friends didn't quit because of bugs, nerfs, or small QOL stuff............they quit because they're BORED.
---
Today was the first day 100% of my friends were offline during prime time.  It sucks :(
---
That‚Äôs my build too!! Couldn‚Äôt have done the queen without those sneak damage perks
---
We don't blame the Messenger.  His shoddy coding is the thing that gets him stuck on rocks and branches, and makes that event unbearable.
---
\^\^This\^\^ so much this, why can't they do the simple things??
---
Lvl 238...without PA exept nuke zones. Last against enemies when i was about lvl 30
---
‚ÄúCritically, if you do the loop again, the same legendaries spawn at the same level at the same place. So If 3* spawns at the entrance of Watoga on the first loop, it'll appear again on the 2nd loop with different Loot.‚Äù
---
This has not been my experience at all. If I dont hop servers and continue the same loop the legendarys that respawn are almost guranteed to be 0 stars. What magic are you using to get 3* to respawn as 3*?
---
I ran a loop for a few hours awhile back that had 15 legendary enemies, many of them 2 or 3*, all but 1 respawned with 0 stars.
---
what have you got exactly?
---
Seriously. Play, or don‚Äôt play. I don‚Äôt get why people need Bethesda (or this sub) to somehow validate or even just acknowledge their choice. 
---
It doesnt work initially but does once you make actual contact with them if theyre sneaking. At least for me thats how it works.
---
Or you can have one of your buddies soup it up for you or give it to a low lvl in need that's what I've done with extras...
---
Cuddly Deathclaws with the player's best interests at heart :)
---
U are the man..wow it appears I will need to add that too lol
---
Would it have been better if they made levels harder to get and capped the level at 50?
---
I can confirm that it drops from Census Violence.  But it's a crazy rare drop, like 1 in 50 times or worse.  It took me forever and a day to farm it.
---
If you've got lots of caps or some really really good legendary items, you can always go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits and try to trade for it or buy it for caps.  Please be warned, people are going to want crazy amounts for it.  At a 1 in 50 or worse drop, it takes forever to farm.
---
sure it's nice but what are the odds of getting a FULL set of weightless marine armor...
---
I've seen more posts like this but it's just never gonna happen, unless you buy it from a duper i suppose. especially with the current situation if legendary's it's just not a realistic thing to grind for imo
---
or am i missing something? i Haven't checked the patch notes in a while, did they add some sort of legendary creation? 
---
But a good point, wood armor has it's place but why is there so much of it.
---
I was killing super mutants near grafton steel the other day, and 10 spawned in the same room as me while the bodies I just killed disappeared. I agree with you on the grind - it‚Äôs not a bad cycle and honestly it‚Äôs something that has kept me playing occasionally. But disappointing things like the endgame/loot drops have changed me from playing every night all week long to maybe just playing it once a week, if that
---
You could look at it this way... against an unarmored enemy, using AP perks/mods will do less damage to that enemy than if you swapped out the perks/mods for damage perks mods.  Using AP in this situation does decreased damage versus the potential damage from stacking damage perks/mods.  Flip this to a high armored target, stacking damage does less than stacking AP.  So while on a number to number basis, using AP against unarmored doesn't decrease damage, it only does decreased damage to what you could have potentially done.  This makes sense since you can't stack both damage and AP given the game's mod/perk limitations.
---
I haven‚Äôt tested this extensively, but it seems like if you stash all your legendaries (armor and weapons) then go looting, you get better drops. Anyone else tried this?
---
Yea gun fu is only good if youre not around people in whom are in your party. Even then, the swap to next target is a bit slow. 
---
I was so pissed off XD  F U C K
---
How about this. I think you are lying about this. You just got bored and decided to make a bullshit post about a game you aren't playing anymore. 
---
Maybe you felt your karma could use a boost or whatever, and thought, hate posts bout 76 are still popular.
---
Probably not massive, as quantities are apparently quite limited. If Id be B'da, Id try to hire this fan.
---
You know when I saw Fallout 3 the first time I was really underwhelmed (grew to accept it), but I was happy more people would get into Fallout 1 and 2 as a result.
---
um, let me repost your actual reply to another comment in this thread- but you  think MY comment is worse than what you actually did?
---
(btw, if you didnt realize, we are all happy you did this detailed reporting and we appreciate the time it took for you to compile it all, but its sad the community has to do this, as opposed to BethSoft simply listening to its own customers)
---
^"When the post 3 weeks or so ago hit almost 3k Endorsements, calling out Bethesda for it's lack of response to bug reports and ModAuthors offers of assistance and sharing of Data a Community manager reached out, the longish conversation, where I asked for a better way to submit info to the Dev's resulted in "Submit a Ticket"...
---
After a couple days of Frustration I decided to "Fight fire with fire", step up my game and give Bethesda exactly what they asked for, Tickets.
---
I then submitted about 35 tickets in a single day, got chastised by someone on the Bethesda support side for submitting so many tickets, and had a number closed out as duplicates.
---
That lead to a back and forth via email, a request for my phone number and a Call from "Dan", the Customer Support Manager the next day that lasted nearly an hour.
---
Short of long, I made some people have a rough day, was submitting tickets via Support vs Dev ticket path (Intentional so I had ticket numbers), talked about Support styles and the fact they are locked into corp paths (They can't walk to someone's desk and give a note, they have to submit tickets to the Dev's like we do), etc.
---
Some talk about streamlining the ticket submission and the lack of transparency was also had, I don't know what will come from it, but I hope they are using the data.
---
Don't know if I'll be thanked, or acknowledged, but atleast I know I tried.
---
Don't know and can't comment if they are "ignoring" us, are under orders not to respond, or something similar, but sometimes it can feel that way.
---
Can't agree more, most the other author's I know who played have given up due to the lack of progress on Bugs, the (no offense to anyone) horrifically done Fixes and Rebalances, and lack of communication.
---
Don't know how much longer I'll last, but trying to atleast finish compiling this both for us as a community and Bethesda to reference since we still haven't seen a complete list of issues as promised."
---
Oh lord, I think it‚Äôs a sword. I have more but I don‚Äôt keep track of them
---
LOL. You spent more time on this post then the game, and you want people to take you seriously?
---
You are literally wasting your life. And again, I think you are lying.
---
LYING. 
---
They said Fallout 76 was ‚Äòthe buggiest AAA
---
release in the last decade‚Äô I countered that NV was worse. Pretty straightforward 
---
What is the name of the quest / text that displays in the Pipboy?  
---
Not done this questline and didn't see it right away in the Daily list.
---
I had a 4 star hand made. Don‚Äôt know if I still have it?
---
I think they've already pulled resources away. This is why our weekly patches/hotfixes have stopped and why we're being sold on big things happening 'in the future'. 
---
Why not gather up a team and do it?
---
Thank you, and I hope you enjoy your time in Appalachia! If you're on PS4, hit me up :)
---
The un-balancing of the old games were fine. It was great to get totally OP weapons because it was hilarious and it really had no effect on you. In an MMO setting, it‚Äôs so much different..
---
Oh for sure. I was just lamenting the cynicism of this sub lately. xD
---
See the path of dedemption is great and all but Beth needs to at least step onto that path.
---
Instead, they seem to be looking at it with 2 middle fingers raised.
---
This is all a long con. Put this out. It's terrible. Then wait. Let it fester. Then put out a very slightly better single player that goes back to the original format and people buy it just to get the taste of this out of their mouth. Profit. Maybe.
---
Wood stuff isn't terrible if you only need the legendary effect from it. I'm building up ledge armour sets and about 1/4 of them are wood. -15% damage effect from super mutants mostly overrules the actual DR of the piece, against super mutants at least.
---
Other than that I can see the visual effect of wood armour not being great but with legendaries you're never gonna get the type you want. Outfits are great anyway, forget that Mad Max-goon aesthetic
---
Make sure you're hitting SEARCH on every container.  It's not just "open and see what's inside".  Depending on your console there will be another option on the container that says "Press to SEARCH".
---
I use Pharma Finder and find tons of good extra meds using the SEARCH button.
---
Also Pharma Finder is not limited to White Med Containers, it also works on Yellow Chem Containers, Blue Chem Containers, Doctors Bags, and Bathroom Mirrors.  So there may be more containers than just the one you're looking at for scrounger.
---
Hope that helps!
---
I‚Äôve had so many I can‚Äôt remember. I guess I should take screenshots just to prove it.
---
&gt;The loot isn't any less shit than the loot other 3\* 50 legendaries drop,
---
This guy is seriously  comparing the scorched beast queen to 3 star legendary enemies that can easily be killed solo.   I can only down vote him once so please, anyone else who knows what they hell they are talking about, please do your part. Thanks. 
---
Let me get back to you with that info when I get home. I can't recall if the T60s need flux or not.
---
The downvotes are probably against marriage. I also understand.
---
Anyway, the intention was clearly to make a big compliment. 
---
You sir, have mental problems and I suggest a year without the interwebz. Good day. 
---
There are 3 of them. From my understanding, one of the three should trigger for you once per day once you've completed the Mistaken Identity quest at Camden park.
---
Quest names:
---
Dross Toss
---
Lucky Mucker
---
Chow Line 
---
That isn‚Äôt what they‚Äôre asking. He wasn‚Äôt sure if the ap magazines shot ap rounds that functioned as new Vegas style ap rounds doing literal less damage while ignoring large amounts of armor.
---
I do believe Maryland made the game as we see it now, did no testing or even proofing, and handed it off to Austin for upkeep and maintenance. 
---
I would imagine the Austin staff were not thrilled about their first Bethesda project consisting of babysitting a game they didn't even make, and left.
---
No wonder the guy who founded Battlecry LLC left as soon as their first original game was cancelled. I seriously doubt there is even an original team member left in Austin. It's just a bunch of code janitors turning over weekly.
---
If you want one Il gift the plans for free. Have about 8 of the things.
---
You never been able to bulk you items, when you're nowhere near a stash box?
---
Never seen it on vendors and I have don't the Cenus Violence event 50 times now....Lots of Plan never anything related to marine underarmor.
---
I REALLY hate hooping around to find these events, paying to join, doing them again and again and getting plans I already know.
---
Like I said have done it 50 times at least 30 times I got plans I already know.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
This kind of sounds like Path of Exile.
---
How do you know it's the screws? Also, currently there is a bug where if you have some of the items on your and some in the stash box, you need to put it all in the stash box. 
---
If that doesn't work, make sure you have the needed perk. 
---
if that doesn't work, I don't know what to suggest. 
---
Short term gain while destroying any good will they have left as a company.
---
I fast travelled into a **horde** event on the west of the map yesterday but when I loaded in I was in the middle of the Converted Munitions factory in the far north east being shot to shit by mutants with a very confused sounding player trying to take the workshop in there also. 
---
There are ways to farm mutations, but it's really tiresome and you can get mutations you don't want, and then lose mutations you do want when trying to pull those bad mutations off your character.
---
It's better to go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and find a player selling serums for caps.  Top price you should pay is 500 caps per serum.  Many will have it available for less.  You get to pick and choose 100% of the serums you want, buy them / use them, and equip starched genes / class freak.  You're done working on it forever.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
I've never even found this fabled reddit market, I think this is just a myth.
---
 What I did wrong here is say that as fact, its clearly not.
---
I've said a few times on this thread there is nowhere near enough data to draw anything conclusive, my experience has been a 3\* respawn's as a 3\*, it could be I have been lucky in that respect, however it invariably drops a 1\* item so my magic is only so powerful. 
---
 The best 3\* weapon I got dropped randomly from a non legendary, so this entire loot loop thing could be a waste of time and should just wander about twatting things.  
---
Yes their loot drops are ass. Hence why duping became so big. They need borrow a few pages with what Diablo 3 did with reaper of souls.
---
1. Enable us to scrap legendary for mats we can use to craft more.
---
2. Let us use atoms like blood shards so we can gamble for legendaries
---
3. INCREASE THE QUALITY OF THE GODDAMN LOOT POOL so that dupers and online resellers dont have a purpose .
---
4. Get rid of any form of rng that requires any kind of server hopping while theyre at it
---
Yeah there is no reason for them to put money in this game, I'm assuming the laughable atom shop is not generating that much as well
---
Yeah so much advantage. When someone is sniping from the other side of the map.
---
PC? Maybe a CAMP bug? 
---
Cut content most likely.
---
What do you mean by explosive weapons? Missile launchers and grenade launchers, or legendary weapons with the explosive affix? 
---
If it's the former, I'm with you. If the later, explosive post-nerf is still the best secondary legendary affix. 
---
5x violet each
---
I don‚Äôt particularly care if the player base picks up or not, I‚Äôm playing it entirely as a single-player game.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
Most of these companies have a central QA team that's usually in the cheapest possible location - EA has one in Louisiana, and THQ used to outsource to Romania.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear that most of the QA is in Dallas or Maryland.  QA (expect for embedded QA) doesn't have to be on site in order to be effective.  You can also spin up outsourced QA in just a week or two.
---
Anything with + damage or - damage from a certain enemy type is typically garbage.  Vendor it.
---
There are rare exceptions to the rule when you get a -30% damage from Ghouls / +1 Strength / Sentinel -15% Damage While Standing Still.............because the last 2 perks are really good.
---
Hate posts have never been popular on this sub. I don‚Äôt have any proof of what happened, but it‚Äôs really not that far fetched.
---
Pure cringe there. Apparently you're in the Top 10% of wage earners in NYC, cites a bunch of "classic" intellectual buzzword noise to make yourself sound clever, yet here you are arguing with us dumb peasant gamers on a Fallout 76 subreddit. Shouldnt you be betting on the stock market instead?
---
The heavy artillery ones are there too above them.
---
Because they're already selling like hot cakes right?
---
ok, that is a bug... one of many...
---
One time I wanted to fight PvP with another player and we both accepted by shooting each other with slap damage, no-one became wanted AND PvP didn't start properly. We just engaged with slap damage until someone died... he died, I got 10 caps bounty on my head... I let him kill me afterwards to get rid of the bounty. That was really strange...
---
But in general it worked most of the times. What I don't get is people comparing the wanted system with the PvP system. AFAIK that should be seperated, if not bugged out... 
---
never been popular? Wrong. Just wrong. 
---
It's way to far fetched. All you left out was all your favorite weapons have magically disappeared. 
---
My honest guess is that there aren‚Äôt enough instance databases being rented from Amazon and that they‚Äôve shifted the number they are renting to other games in development, and that that is why the same loot lag / server crashes etc are the result of lack of financial investment that‚Äôs been the case since Beta and won‚Äôt be changing.
---
Didn‚Äôt know that, but it‚Äôs good info.
---
I noted several locations where people have said they tamed something, go to those and try, but only get Pacify option, server hop, try again, lather, rinse, repeat, same results over &amp; over again.
---
I also understand that you need to be at least double the level of the creature to tame it, I'm level 125, and tried on many level 22-48 Animals &amp; Creatures.
---
I suspect there is some glitch, Perk, SPECIAL, issue that's preventing me from being successful, but can't decipher the problem.
---
Thanks i have alot of capps and a couple legendaries but if i can grind and i like fallout then win win but u get both from census event or like the other guy said try all the events in the bog
---
While I have both a PC and a Mac, Mac can run games. And Bethesda has a mac client for Elder Scrolls Online, so it's not a company thing. It's a choice they make per game. And since the engine is quite dated at this point, there's no reason they couldn't build a Mac version from a technical standpoint. It's a business model and price decision they've made. Considering the drop in price and the lower number of players, I'm doubtful they would make a client for Mac at this point. 
---
You can buy them from vendors (I found White Springs &amp; Enclave to have them most frequently). That's how I got most of mine.
---
Fantastic details, thank you.  
---
Sorry Xbox 
---
I'm level 34 and I get all my caps taken away for one reason or another almost every time I play. It's almost like it's pointless to even bother once you can start crafting things.
---
Hope you're wrong, no offense!
---
Nope still there. Trade glitch was a thing though so even that isn‚Äôt very far fetched. Is that fixed yet?
---
Use Green Thumb to get 2 times the amount of raw flux.  When you craft stable flux use Super Duper (30% chance to craft double flux).
---
Yes the flux plants respawn, but you CANNOT grab them a second time.  Be careful how long you farm for flux before crafting stable flux............watch the decay timer on all your raw flux stacks.  If it gets low, head off to craft stable flux then come back.
---
Raw flux weighs 0.1 pound and when decays turns into Inert Flux that weighs 1 lb EACH.
---
Violet Flux is best gathered at Fissure Prime.
---
Every other type of flux is available at Whitesprings.  Check the road between the Main Whitesprings Building and the Whitesprings Train Station, all the different types of flux are there.
---
I can help! 
---
Check my submitted history I had a bunker there with a hidden front door.
---
&gt; launch it and just joined a group of 4 or 5 high level players
---
This is far more ideal than a server full of people where half of them are useless in the fight with her HP/armor scaling.
---
My gamertag is Galath11. Join the game
---
I was under the impression all the Calibrated Shocks required Flux.  Which is why the Mods are so useful for many users.  1000 for a mod vs 500-800 fee for someone to craft them using your (rare to many) own mats.
---
Not saying you don't deserve the fee for your services, just that a slightly more expensive mod item for something like this has it's value.
---
/u/Bethesdagamesstudios_
---
Y pc. I think some users find out exploits or using hacks
---
Thank you for taking the time to make these lists.
---
You're just the hypocritic other side of the coin.
---
Given that 2.3 percent of XBOX players have a PvP achievement, I would say there isn‚Äôt a burning desire for PvP in a broken game. 
---
What trading glitch? The one where people could steal from a persons inventory?
---
Cause that was debunked as false 
---
Like the rumor of going f2p
---
Reported and submitted, thanks!
---
It was the perk nerf that went to far.
---
The affix nerfs were spot on.
---
Thank you, costumer will definitely have to provide the flux.
---
Will do momentarily
---
I have probably 200+ at this point.
---
What you get in them is pretty much garbage.  Takes too long to track them down and the rewards aren't good.
---
I would gift them to noobies like I do with stimpacks, weapons, armor etc, but I can't troll someone that hard.  I try not to load noobies up with worthless things.
---
Now if you could call in multiple air drops from the same terminal (at the same time) and they had a chance to spawn a random plan..........NOW that would be worth it.
---
Agree, 100%
---
&gt;Issue: Missing from Legendary Reward 
---
&gt;All of them are missing from Legendary loot tables,
---
Hey I got a question for you- where can I find a copy of these loot tables? I found a list of all mods and all plans off incendar's website, but I havent been able to locate a datamined list of loot tables.
---
That is, if you these loot tables you refer to are datamined from the game files, and not from your empirical data gathering.
---
You have done an incredible job on detailing everything by the way, its a shame Bethesda isnt utilizing these bug round ups (maybe they are and im not seeing it)
---
Thanks Micah very cool
---
As do I, I‚Äôve waited since Beta to be proven wrong.  I‚Äôve put in almost 800 hours. 
---
I think the best stories are ones that are a shared experiance , I think everyone has or had 5 million of those pearl handled ivory pistols early on and realized they are more common than scorched or wandered into a area way too early and had to run from monsters or marveled at the gear some players are wielding when we are still rocking pipe pistols and sledge hammers (we've since found better weapons :) ) 
---
&gt; **Perk - Adrenaline currently has a Exploit**
---
Not sure if this is the same what I found with [radworms](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ap998x/radworms_adrenaline_perk_glitches_weapon_damage/) and [standalone](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apevy6/adrenaline_perk_glitch_can_boost_all_weapon_damage/). As far as I could test mine, these were client-side only bugs and did not actually result in an exploit. I could not check if the damage loss from radworms glitch is also mitigated on the server (i.e., the client sends the lower weapon damage but the server calculates with the correct damage number).
---
For some reason i was eagerly awaiting a powerfist, assuming it would work with PA. I was wrong.
---
Actually it encourages griefing. Lower level players are incentivized to attack higher level players for their cap payout.
---
You can't interact with Pacified animals, and I've had no luck Taming anything, that's the subject of another Post.
---
I have family that lives in Austin and I've heard from them that there is a big market for temp video game QA services there. They contract out the QA work to these businesses much like how many factories contract out their new hires to temp agencies.
---
I don't want any of the resources used on this game anywhere near ES6 or Starfield.
---
would be cool if you could build them legitly. the SAM turrets from a BOS quest. the Heavy artillery turrets from maybe a random military quest
---
Get a bloodied tesla rifle.
---
Also can we up the threshold of what it takes to agro the Whitesprings bots? 
---
Op needs to delete this before it gets patched or hotfixed
---
Aw I'm on PC but I wouldn't be much help.  I'm minmaxed into stealth so the Bravos don't even see me most of the time.  I just walk right under them.
---
Everything is stored and if you already know the place then it shouldnt be hard
---
It's always the melee or explosive shotty guys trying to start shit too.
---
Skeet Shooter :p
---
Honestly, just take it slow.  If youre having a hard time with PvP, avoid it.  It's a pretty broken system.  Just enjoy the game and play at your own pace.  Maybe find some like minded individuals to play with.  I rushed to 100% the game, and now just sitting around grinding things to sell to vendors.
---
My friends are quitting because they're BORED.  There's no new content.
---
Last night was the first night where 100% of my friends list was OFFLINE in prime time.  Normally now it's 95% offline, but last night broke the record.
---
Please add more content to the game.  Chill on the 100+ bug fix patches.  Nobody cares about 70% of those bugs and you re-introduce NEW bugs that are making people even more upset.
---
Content, content, content!
---
yeah since it looks like it's their camp. maybe they somehow stored those turrets
---
Would Grounded effect a Gauss rifle? 
---
I've had no luck at all with Taming anything, that's a whole other subject though.
---
The same exact thing happened to me. Just unlucky, I guess. Other people complain about the competition for silos, so bad luck can swing either way. 
---
Oh for sure, and when you're Patrick Melrose-ing it in a grimy fucking bathroom with a flashlight in your mouth and a needle between your toes, being called shit isn't really top of your worries.
---
However, terminology does have power, can stigmatize and dehumanize, and why make the horrible uphill battle against addiction any harder than it already is.
---
Absolutely get where you're coming from, through. I've been there myself. 
---
&gt;cut out half your characters "mandatory" weight.
---
/&gt;Carries no armor and only carries 1 PA set on hand which I wear and PA suits weigh 0 when worn or deployed
---
Half of 0 is still 0 m8
---
He will be grinding his hard drive on better things soon.
---
Your argument is a straw man and your counter claim is a hasty generalization. Sorry if I not make that clear.
---
Any of us can find ways to not get loot, please present a method that you find does work if you want to contribute something useful to this discussion.
---
yeah I try to take it with a grain of salt , I dont wont to downplay anyone else experiances with the game but so far mine have been pretty fun ( though being killed by invisible bees or finding your character model deformed after wearing power armor isnt top on my funometer list :p ) I do hope they flesh out some of the places you explore though , I love the exploration and stumbling over new things but some of the places I've explored feel so sparse . 
---
Play at your own pace and enjoy the game. It's not a race, it's not a competition. The end game isnt this grand reward and adventure that you think it is. Hell the endgame is worse than the climb to get to it. Enjoy the climb while you can. But if you REALLY want to level up, then do events, do quests, kill literally every enemy you see. Bethesda did a horrible job balancing this game so most low level players struggle pretty bad. Just take your time
---
Eh I don't give a fuck about PvP they get their own servers soon and can piss off. Just cause u couldn't adapt your playstile to compete against Melee players seems the only reason your crying to nerf them^^
---
Worst thing at all that you fucking PvP crybabies get us PvE players these nerfs.
---
It's fine that u and hopefully others like u stopped playing, I guess ur better served by playing some Battle Royale FPS Games 
---
I got the "invisible" thing from an armor piece.  My favorite piece of armor, since I have a sneak/sniper build.
---
Slight spoiler below
---
Maybe those are the ones we're supposed to befriend during Rose's quest. 
---
Thanks for the tip. I'm just happy I've finally found a spot to put my CAMP without fear of it being destroyed
---
It was never debunked as false but whatever.
---
Yeh a bloodied tesla with the charging barrel mod for more dmg was my first bloodied weapon for this exact reason, trying to pump out more dmg so I can do a bit more than kill scorched with it, but ultimately I wasn't overly impressed with the whole experiment so tried melee instead... 
---
I've heard it can be a very grueling job with little security.
---
I agree. I did the scorch Queen the other day. I used over 1000 .45 ammo and over 500 shotgun. I also broke 3 guns. We also failed.
---
I am extremely impressed! I don't know what you do for a living, but I hope it's related to your talents.
---
That is one thing I enjoy doing.  Finding a nice camping spot with a beautiful view.
---
That makes me feel so much better üò≠ I thought I was just bad at this game LMAO
---
Not all mutations are beneficial to all builds.
---
If you're a sneak sniper, don't get melee related mutations.  95% of the time you won't use them, you'll just suffer the downsides.
---
I generally pick 9 or so off the list.  My ranged character has around 9, and my melee character has around 9, but they're different mutations.  Some both characters have, like marsupial, speed demon, healing factor, adrenal, etc.
---
I've killed dogs that were wearing armor, but it was never lootable.
---
Have you gotten one of these?
---
Except it won't be placed down. Something will be "floating" because of the bugs in the build system. More of an annoyance than anything. I have stairs stacked because it's multi level 
---
Explain whats hypocritical? I dont understand your point.
---
Delete the blueprint and place everything manually?
---
More so battle Royale game
---
I have a question, how come when The Mysterious Stranger pops up during vats dude just stands there?  Is there something I'm supposed to be doing?
---
white spring is a good place to level up. 
---
Thanks for the heads up. Ill grab some screenshot
---
Lost 2 good legendary mele weapons and now I'm scared to play because I may lose other items 
---
I'm level 126 and have never gotten a two shot explosive anything, never gotten Sentinel's armor, never gotten weapon weight reduction armor (looted one piece of food weight reduction), and never seen a three star weapon with my preferred prefix Junkie's.  And for last Halloween all i got was a rock.
---
Thank you, kind stranger
---
Hi I have some video with such textures
---
[here ](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/manny-sandov/video/69051802) 
---
Killed on in The Mire and had it land up in a tree. I have a jetpack on my X01, so I was able to get to it. Not worth the effort it took. Got a legendary switchblade... 
---
When all the blind hate was going on, i still enjoyed 76. I was eager to play it before it came out. Even with all the problems, i still had fun, even after my friends stopped playing.
---
Normally, I trust a dev when they say they dont want to spoil future content... but with the way things have been going here lately, i think you might be right.
---
Perfect, thank you.  
---
Added and submitted
---
Wait a minute.  So players can attack your camp and take your caps?  I thought the only thing they get is junk and get a wanted mark on them.  Shit, should I pack my camp up everytime I'm done with it?
---
i tend to agree on the atom shop.. its all useless ugly lame ass shit
---
You're telling the PVE side of the game to pack it up.  While you're only wanting a PVP only game and catering to the PVPers.  Not even stopping to think that there are loyal PVEers who just want to play the game.  
---
but you need to server hop to keep creatures there generating.
---
I've done a lot of googling on it, and Marine Shielded seems to only come from Census Violence.  I believe I got Marine Protected there as well.
---
You can try to farm all the events, but if you're really power farming it would be better to server hop for Census Violence.  Also Census Violence is only 5 mins AND can be easily solo'd while you watch Youtube videos on a second monitor :)
---
Unless you're around a mirelurk queen or scorchbeast, then you actually have to try.....lol
---
I promise you're not, this game doesnt work like the other fallouts do. We dont get to become the borderline god heros we are used to being. We are simply another vault dweller that left the vault with everyone else, the only thing that makes us special is the choices we make and how we play the game. We dont get to be super OP like we are used to being 
---
Ooooo good tip!!!!
---
Don't forget this was Bethesda Austin and not Bethesda. Though that's not a big excuse 
---
well i spose you do have a point there.. the concepting and design of this game was straight up braindead
---
&gt; Would be nice to have true zero weight armor on my sniper.
---
Have you tried Shrouded Wood armor? Gets pretty close to 0 even before weightless and shouldn't interfere. Is best stealthwear anyway.
---
&gt; Most folks around here have been trying to make this game something it isnt. 
---
...but add this stuff that I want because I know what the game *really* is...
---
it's not the pve portion of the playerbase that's dying, it's the entire playerbase. you're deluding yourself if you think the survival mode is going to breath new, competitive life into the game.
---
that's on one hand. on the other, even if they nerf bloodied, melee and sentinel/cavalier to the ground like they did with TSE, Fallout was never meant to accommodate pvp. the mechanics are broken on a fundamental level. it'll never work properly. 
---
I'm not saying your comment is wrong, and yes I called them out... 
---
But after a few conversations "inside the modding community" I'm wondering if we, the fan base are not causing some of our own problems. The community "Shaming" them (Deserved or not) for taking the ModAuthors work and accusing them of plagiarism etc has to cause some fallout (not being Punny).
---
I am not trying to be an apologist, or forgive their lack of communication, just trying to keep an open mind and try and think of other angles, to avoid the Keyboard smashing rage fill tantrum I want to throw (and I know I'm not alone there)
---
No problem :)  I really wish they'd stop nerfing things EVERYONE likes :(
---
It's like going to McDonalds and finding out they don't have the Big Mac any more.  Just single patty hamburgers with ketchup.  What, why?  lol 
---
Im honestly fine with both sides.  If I'm getting annoyed enough by "raiders". I can just leave the server.  If they could just implement some bug fixes and then add new content, I would be then ecstatic for the game.
---
well...I suppose you got Bethesda'd too, gave them money and hoped they would care about what they give you back
---
Yup. Usually when you're in a popular spot and the other player has a camp there and wants to be a d-bag about it instead of changing servers. So far they've initiated PvP and then killed me and my cousin took them down before we decided to just switch servers after they spawned in again.
---
Two days ago I had an accidental 20 cap bounty ( for trying to defend camp) turrets went agro on me, 20 caps bounty...
---
I‚Äôve been attacked ( I would only defend myself ) and now my bounty is 120 I don‚Äôt remember damaging another player or camp without being provoked so I‚Äôm not sure how this system works.
---
The positive of it I‚Äôve collected over 500 caps in less then an hour from players 60-120 levels trying to cash in my bounty.
---
And if I get killed with this bounty in theory I would loose 120 caps rather then the caps corresponding to (my level 140) so I‚Äôm saving myself caps and making caps...
---
Or am I missing something ?
---
I am with you. I cant wait until this game gets a real PvP mode. I am also on the hype train for SM. I actually think buffing turrets and walls and locks for PvP reasons is a better way to go. Taking a CAMP should be a difficult and I agree with you rewarding experience. It shouldnt be something one player can do
---
This makes sense, and creates a few dynamic levels for gameplay. I've even just said "fuck it" and started over completely cuz I thought I was doing that poorly. I'm relieved to say the least I'm not the only one who found this game imbalanced
---
Huh? Not for me. Got that issue just recently with patch 5.
---
Two Shot Explosive. Whoever down voted, "There's no such thing as a stupid question."
---
But what is the game?
---
You can PvE with group content. Im not saying pack it up. Its just not a single player experience. Especially at "end game"
---
The single player content is finished. Add dungeons for PvE players. I put that in the post.  You misunderstood. 
---
This game is all about groups and player interaction. Thats where it shines. We all know it.
---
Happy to, I mean can't play atm due to the "Loading Corpses", and I should finish some FO4 Mods, but the love for what this game could be...
---
If nothing else it shows issues there for everyone.
---
My main sadness re:perks is that there is only one rank of iron fist but three ranks of Gladiator/Slugger. Why no love for my Power Fist and Death Tambo?
---
So you're the cancer killing the game we wanted to originally play. I'm glad it's all in one package. 
---
This is the worst topic ive read in this sub
---
Thanks for this psa op. I have a bloodied gatling laser and i wasnt sure if it was worth the 40 lbs it takes up. Ill try some of your pointers
---
They never releasee the game you wanted. They released the game i love!
---
When they were dumped by other players, yes. I found 3 Chameleon armour that way.
---
That neon sign is must have for murderers like me.
---
"Oh no the new event is pay 2 friend Bethesda is the worst"
---
IDK if it's a bug or not, but the overseers quest stops showing quest objectives after the first few, and there is no way to track progress. My character is level 91 and still has not completed it, despite having (I think) all the holotapes. I have listened to them again just to be sure, and checked off which ones I have. I have no idea how to complete the quest. 
---
guess they brought it back in a new way then.
---
"Hey previously you were just shown wrong log messages....We fixed that! Now you actually loose ammo!"
---
Off the players that ruined the game and made everyone lag and disconnect! No.....bad idea.
---
Yeah, was so excited when the game was announced. I still have a blast playing it but it could be so much more.
---
Bulk copper sells for tons and has very little uses.
---
You failed, but not because you guys were dying but because you ran out of time right? I've never failed from dying, only from running out of time. What a shit design.
---
Legendary enemies can heal once they hit like 50%. It's another "feature".
---
I have a discord if you want to play with a smaller group. Or there's the /r/fo76FilthyCasuals discord. It's in the sidebar of that sub 
---
Thanks for the feedback!  
---
[FO76Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/30)  
---
It's what the Modding Community uses to look at the game files and the base platform for mod creation.  
---
In the case of the Enclave Armor, they are not on the Legendary "Feeder" tables, and don't appear to be available as one of the rare legendary rewards from quest completion.
---
Or leave it. I just have to grind a little caps for pvp. 
---
The stuff they added to protect the carebear fallout fanbase was a disservice to the gameplay. 
---
Ugh I did not need that reminder.
---
Yes....we ran out of time. Because the Queen self healed when we got her down half way.
---
Yeah unfortunately that's what it looks like I'll have to do. Experienced tons of. I've but never this. Sigh. 
---
Legitimately using them would be a waste of time as they are so bugged i can't stand doing the Surface to Air quest anyway.
---
God dammit.  I already have enough issues with online bullies chasing me down now I gotta move my camp too?  Can they attack my camp if I'm not playing?  Or only when I'm playing?  Man, they really are upping the realism in this shit huh?
---
Afraid to look at my in game hours.... but I'm closing on 100 on these pages (yes yes I'm a OCD maniac and time the effort spent)
---
It's used in crafting and building quite a bit; I hang onto mine.
---
But the stuff they added is the game. So why are you trying to make the game something it isn't?
---
Different, and does not require RadWorms.
---
Aaaaand again nothing that really shouts out I must buy this with my atoms, free or bought.
---
Would it really hurt to actually put things in the atom shop that people would actually want and need?   
---
with that neon sign, you to can be basic in the apocalypse 
---
This is all true.  However, due to this game being what it is.  Not everyone has the luxury of playing in a group.  Being able to enjoy from a single player and multiplayer aspect is something the game should try to be.  But yeah, let the group of bored high levels raiders destroy some camps that people put up to help out the new players that this game desperately needs.
---
yeah noticed that too.
---
Even the CMs seem to have withdrawn too,haven't seen a single "Bethesda Replied" post since over a week
---
Not to mention the disappearing acts they do half the time immediately upon being killed......
---
Good question...   
---
Fist weapons are pretty amazing however...
---
That figure is tracked in one of the challenges, if you want to know the exact number of hours 
---
the pictures never loaded for me, not visited that place in weeks, my Atoms just keep adding up.
---
A Mr. Vendor, upgradeable through plans. Each one offering more item slots than the previous.
---
I did most of my levelling just by exploring.  I do quests just to break up the monotony of wandering around.  
---
You should have all got bonus loot for that effort. Having to put up with that mess for the mainframe cores and the biometric cards sounds so painful.
---
Nice! Looks like its at the same place. üòÇ
---
Not trying to be rude here but we can't answer that. We don't know you or have any idea of what games you like to play. 
---
Give it a spin and report back to us. 
---
I actually never noticed this. I use them pretty regularly, and give extras to my teammates. So I never tried to sell them. :O 
---
I wonder if this is true for all versions of them? Like the player made ones that you get from recipes too.
---
Same bullshit happened to me last night. I think I got one maybe two legendary items after slaughtering about five or six legendary ghouls. I'm prett sure I got better loot off the three scorchbeast and mirelurk queen I killed than most of the legendary ghouls.
---
Where is that pi k heart power armor skin from fo4 dammit!
---
Knowing Bethesda this is exactly what would happen.
---
Wordplay!
---
The point is this sub wants more punishment for pvp. I think we need to encourage it. Go the opposite way.
---
Subs dead anyway.
---
I added the description to the screenshot but i'll add them here in case you just wanna read them:
---
* Share the Love
---
Show how much you care by teaming up!
---
Through February 18, you'll gain +15 maximum health for each additional member on your team.
---
* Kill, Laugh, Love neon sign
---
let your neighbors know how you live you life.
---
* Pink Metal Armor paint
---
Who said armor has to be drab? Bring a little color to your fights with this Pink Paint for your metal armor.
---
* Pink Corvega pain
---
The days of automobile giant Chryslus might be over, but this Pink Corvega Paint for your Pip-Boy is a great reminder.
---
* Hearts and Rainbow frame
---
Spread some love and happiness with your photos with the Hearts and Rainbows Frame.
---
* Lover Girl player icon
---
Your enemies may be dead, but romance isn't.
---
* Lover Boy player icon
---
When you're totally smitten.
---
SOUNDS LIKE THAT WOULD BE QUITE FLOPPY
---
You had never fired a bullet in the game yet? Sometimes it happens a long time after you shoot.
---
I like the idea, but I think the bounty hunter should be paid immediately and the offending player has a debt to the game. 
---
Friend to win 
---
What a fantastic troll.
---
It‚Äôs still kind of a hot mess at the moment, but as a filthy casual like me it‚Äôs still gobs of fun.  There is so much wrong with it right now, so be prepared for that.  
---
If you enjoy exploring, gathering, crafting, and just sort of letting the experience happen it‚Äôs fine.    If you‚Äôre looking for PvP, bug free, or end game content then skip it.
---
You're supposed to use this forum to organize friendly PVP. Redditors don't make sense!
---
We also need breakable armor so that targeted shots always in the same spot reduce the enemy's resistance. 
---
nice point! Darn it! When only a simple copy and paste would have done it!
---
The PA version isn't difficult. The rads are easier to maintain, you don't take falling damage, PA has some built in damage reduction and Emergency Protocols is really strong.
---
Right? I'm hoping the pink flames paint is a limited item on Thursday. I need it!
---
They just flat out disappear from the aid category at vendors. While things look me antibiotics don't. . . Weird. Thought maybe some knew, and I've been dense these last 3.5 months, lol.
---
I think the real problem is how they thought this was okay ? Surely internal testing showed legendaries were not dropping proper items for the amount of time and ammunition it takes to kill a legendary. The whole thing is a bit sad  . I hate to say it but it seems like Bethesda did this on purpose or they are just really bad at their jobs
---
I didnt downvote, but i know this already for a month an didnt share it, because im scared Bethesda will see it and "fix" it.
---
crap, forgot about that one, it's caused by getting the tapes out of order.
---
Thanks for the reminder.
---
I know this is sarcasm but you get a down vote for even whispering this idea out loud XD
---
I've found the mod several times but I can't remember where at since the minigun is useless I never use it 
---
What happens when there is no bounty involved, just regular PvP?
---
Excellent photos! Love the Queen fight, especially when the fog crawlers , yao guai etc start showing up and blind siding people. It's one of the few times you can really open up as a heavy weapons build, get those stacks of adrenaline up and lay waste!
---
i kind of quit playing after doing that last mission...bethesda needs to invest in better server hardware
---
When you have a bounty every owned turret (of a Camp or a Workshop) will attack you.  
---
Sometimes being wanted is almost like a shield, if you are alone attacking a group of three high level players at their camp (for example), hit the wall one time, so if they manage to kill you, you will only lose 10 caps.  
---
Don't hold your breath.
---
Should have been included in hotter rod power armor set
---
If you get good ones, go sell them to other players on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.
---
The right combinations of perks on the right items can net you a LOT of caps.
---
That's not a proper spelling nor usage of catalyze, just fyi.
---
Maybe concentrate or direct or expel would be better words to use in that context.
---
Yeah it is kinda useless but I want it because of its aesthetics.
---
Every sunday i want to organize workshop PVP. It's got it all pinnacle of modern gaming.
---
Lately it's been taking quite a while for my camp to materialize when I spawn in, but the interesting thing is other players can see it before I get past the loading screen.
---
Good trade legit guy. Thanks man. 
---
I am holding on to mine hoping when they rebalance heavy weapons it gets a buff. Yeah, I know I am delusional. 
---
No 600 is more than enough for any reasonable player. Curb your hoarding.
---
&gt; high level probably will have overall better equipment (if he has been lucky)
---
with hundreds of dupers selling all the *** duped god weapons and armors in eBay, you can skip the luck factor.
---
its because they're only for certain items and their exorbitant price which is why its not common to buy it
---
I thought you just stumble across them through the game. I found one at Silo Beta maybe and the marker just stuck there since
---
See, here's how you can tell someone is lying. 
---
First, you've said this all happened in 3 minutes of playing the game. We all know you are exaggerating. But the thing is, exaggerating is a form of lying.
---
And when people exaggerate, it's often to try and make people feel more sympathetic towards the person. But if you have to exaggerate to try and be right, then you were never right.
---
Also, you are a little to angry and defensive. When people lie, or exaggerate or bend the truth, the also get defensive, because they know they are going to have to defend their lie. 
---
Tactics people use when they are called out. They get insulting and attack the person. This is to drive them away.
---
They switch subjects to something that isn't about the lie. Sometimes to something they feel they can score win points with, and then try and apply those win points to their lie. A strawman defense. 
---
or they just switch subjects in hopes of misdirection. You know, like bringing up the trade bug.
---
As for that. Several people tried to recreate this bug, following the steps others have described, and couldn't get it to work. They provided proof like videos. While the people making these claims never could provide any proof. They just wanted us to take their word for it.
---
But once people started posting proof about it not being a thing, all the claims of having something stolen from their inventory while trading strangely stopped being made.
---
So yes. Debunked. 
---
I would say 10 per level
---
The biggest tips I can give just incase you dont know:
---
1) Pick up every weapon you see and scrap it, this is how you unlock mods for weapons. Armor is the same.
---
2) The enemies in an area will scale to your level unless another player has gone through and dint kill them all, then they will be around whatever level that person was. If you see enemies that are way above your level either stay away or server hop.
---
3) Caps are actually pretty rare and MUCH harder to get than in previous games. Dont go spending them thinking it will be easy to get them back. You can only sell 200caps to a vendor and then it takes 24 hours for them to reset with more caps. Selling prices are MASSIVELY reduced, if an item says it is worth 200 caps, odds are you'll only sell it for about 20, maybe less.
---
4) Dont take harassment from other players personally, odds are they are just bored and there is nothing to do.
---
5) Invest in endurance perks that increase how much you recover hunger and thirst with the appropriate items.
---
6) Perk cards do not have to be permanent, you can swap perk cards whenever you want for whatever situation you need, as long as you have the cards.
---
7) Build a water purifier at your camp as soon as possible, it is an excellent supply of free purified water, be sure to check it often.
---
8) Inventory management is crucial in this game, use perk cards that reduce the weight of things if you need it. DO NOT carry more than what you need. Nobody needs 100 stimpacks or radaway on them all the time. If you arent using a weapon then dont keep it, same with ammo. Gunpowder can start to take up a lot of inventory weight when carrying it in large amounts, make sure to put it in your stash.
---
9) Your stash should not be used as a hoarding box. Put the extra things you have that you know you need or think you might need. Theres no reason to have 20 different guns in it unless they are legendary and of value to you or other players that may want to buy them.
---
10) Dont be afraid to ask people to help you, most high level players are friendly and dont mind helping you. I personally find enjoyment and satisfaction when someone asks me for help. We all got your back
---
What console you on
---
Nice pics, I've been building up some cryocells to try out on the queen but haven't got around to it yet. Looks super effective for helping the melee builds smash her up.
---
You can pacify dogs and put this on them, they hang out at your camp.
---
some you do, some you're directed to find, "Go to Location X" fetch quests
---
Still waiting for my fez. 
---
This is a feature. Ask Bethesda.
---
You had a bounty, some low levels came to claim it and then you stole their pa? You are the villain in this story. Enjoy being an asshole.
---
charisma needs to be atleast X level also.
---
Aha ! I knew it , it makes sense to me to have a 20 bounty all the time rather then having some dick head get close to me and attack me and single blow kill me , treat everyone as an enemy save my caps make some caps along the way lol 
---
Use market76 for some good trades
---
Yeah... I got it. It‚Äôs been a pain to find Bolt Action Pipe rifles to scrap. And in the past I never picked them up to scrap them‚Äîso it‚Äôs a time/efficiency thing. I spent a few hours already.
---
F
---
I'm hoping the same I want my 50 cal to just hit over 100 I think it would be useful then 
---
I mean it. And i play this game every day
---
Every thing else you guys are arguing about aside...
---
How is it that you only work 6 hours a week?
---
The only reasonable possibilities that come to mind involve inheriting a serious amount of money or property. Or perhaps you sold an interner startup and made a significant amount of money that way.
---
Maybe a youtube star? But even the minimalist channels that dont involve much editing i would think spend more than 6 hrs.
---
&gt; sure it's nice but what are the odds of getting a FULL set of weightless marine armor...
---
It's 100% if you're willing to trade with other players.
---
If someone was doing the mission at the same time, but you're not teamed up, strange things happen. I experienced that a week or two ago - The mission wasn't updating like it normally does, and the three of us entered the silo at roughly the same time, but it wouldn't let me team up with them. That could be why you had no turrets, but robots continue to spawn, I believe. 
---
I would recommend logging in and out of joke account, on the website and on Xbox, opening a support ticket, and if neither of those is successful, reinstalling the game completely. 
---
Assholes or not, they ended up being right. A sad truth, but a truth nonetheless.
---
It exists. Fast travel to forward station delta by fissure site prime out camp venture. There is always a minigun spawn at both locations. Scrap the guns and learn the mod.
---
Hahaha yes , I‚Äôve seen them at other locations as well , tbh just seems like somebody didn‚Äôt qa this area properly but other believe some other theories , like the game being a simulation in the characters eyes 
---

Cool thanks for the reply!

Im on xbox, so I dont have my own game files to dig into, (assuming thats a program that requires you to load in the esm file installed from the PC version).
---
What platform?
---
Maybe try it and find out?
---
It‚Äôs possible BoS plans may only be obtainable through BoS turn ins of technical plans now, or absent entirely.  I‚Äôm almost to the point where I‚Äôm going to go through the code if possible to see, but I hope someone else already has 
---
They stopped supporting for the most part already. Game is $11.99 for pc already and it has only been out a few months. They can't really make a whole lot more money on the game without microtransactions, problem is that without a player base micro transactions dont work. Honestly they fudged up trying to make this game pvp. They should have designed it around pve with endgame content in mind. Nobody even asked for pvp, they just wanted to play Fallout with their friends.
---
Lol this game will never be competetive. 
---
Do you give life advice too?
---
I truly appreciate you taking the time to fill me in. I've not played in a few days, but I feel like this comment put a little wind in my sails and I'm going to try again tonight. Thank you so much!
---
Tag the Bethesda employees imo in hopes of a response 
---
I plan to, but I‚Äôm curious to hear others‚Äô experiences with the game so far
---
^ this

Show a timer for quests. I am sick of travelling to the last minute of a fucking 30 minute event. 
---
If someone launches from the silo you are running through before you get into the control room the silo will go into offline mode so the nuke can be built and will no longer allow access. Best thing to do is to make sure no one is in the silo you want to run before you go there. But also watch this vid cos its got the good tips https://youtu.be/FkK4KEob-yU i show u how to negate having to do the fix the pipes etc
---
That always helps, most posts seem to think we all play together in servers :D
---
There is currently a glitch, where the game cannot recognize both Stash and Inventory items at the same time, either put everything in Stash, or everything in Inventory, that fixes it for me 100% of the time.
---
If that guy dosnt get banned then i dont know anymore ... thats clearly cheating.
---
Not professionally but I have on a few occasions lmao. Glad to help you feel encouraged tho! If you're on xbox feel free to add me and I'll help out any time
---
If /u ISeeInHD
---
Free compass, cool.
---
Ease vs mats certainly is a factor; but with high int I think you can negate a lot of the degradation to condition..? 
---
Wow, I can tell this took a lot of time and effort to create and I really appreciate that! This is so detailed and comprehensive thank you!

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

PS4, but I know who I can ask questions to!! Thank you again ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Lots of issue on Xbox (I play on X and it's not a clean performance for the visuals tradeoff). 
---
Make sure your connection is stable and don't rush it. If you encounter issues, record them using the guide and send it to Bethesda
---
The VIP beta a few weeks back was broken, yes.   But the last Beta was more or less what people would expect and ran well across the board minus minor bugs. 
---
Bethesda has done little to address major game issues in 3 months.   If anything aspects of the game are now arguably less enjoyable. 
---

If you aren't online then your CAMP isn't either.

Ah sorry you're sol, I'm on xbox
---
It wasn‚Äôt an exaggeration. It was an estimation. I was with a friend irl and he wanted to check it out. I loaded in, walked out of the city area, tried to plop down my house, and then crashed. It was about 3 minutes. Anyone will get defensive when they get called a liar about something so stupid. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm the angry one here either. You called me a liar in all caps bud. 
---
You should also get a chance to get a random disease while grouped...
---
Still crap
---
Okay thank you for the answer noble Responder
---
Fair is fair.
---
Drug addiction is displayed at the top left hand corner in a message stating you are addicted to all of that class of drugs (like psycho for example).
---
Here is a link to the types of addictions and the stat effects, [Addiction Table](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_4_addictions) 
---
One reason it may seem ‚Äúbugged‚Äù is that if you are addicted to something, and take the drug you are addicted to again, the symptoms disappear.  Symptoms are only active once you‚Äôve not consumed that drug within a certain amount of time.
---
Lol sounds good bud i sure do appreciate the help !! Sounds like its gonna be a come to ‚Äúcensus violence ‚Äú meeting at my house tonight or how ever long it takes ...again thanks alot
---
What no heart covered pj‚Äôs damn Bethesda you slacking.
---
üòÇüòÇ It's cool how people let their imagination go wild. That's one of the best things with Reddit, well internet as whole. Exchanging crazy fucking ideas! 
---
Don't forget to check out the Atom Store!
---
So go run a silo fool!!
---
I doubt anything further gets fixed anytime soon. They made most of the money to be made and the atom shop is largely unsuccessful. No real reason for them to continue with patches and new content.
---
Especially when you can kill a fat ghoul with one strike and get a 2* or 3* item, the rewards from killing scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens plainly suck.  Heck even the mirelurk kings are way harder to kill than cuddly ghouls yet they drop nothing but mirelurk meat. The game is fun but the balance is mindless. 
---
Yeah spend those perk points on another card. There's plenty in the luck tree that have more reliable damage
---
there's a difference between competitive and esport. Fo76 will never be an esport, that much is obvious, but competitiveness is inherent to pvp.
---
although, yeah. you cemented my point. pvp in this game will never work. so it's silly to focus on it.
---
Coming soon to the Atomic Shop....a dog.
---
i'll sell ya Plan: Minigun Tri Barrel for 1k if u wnat it :)
---
Where is it $11.99?
---
Just shows most games should be cross play
---
I agree
---
&gt; What the ever-living fuck were they thinking?
---
Making textures for PA is really hard OK? That's why they cost 18 USD each in the Atom Shop.
---
On #3, you can certainly enter a silo when other players are in it. I sometimes drop in to help when they're taking a while. This sounds like it's caught in some in-between state.
---
I can barely get enough bullets together to kill ghouls at Whitespring... I‚Äôm not launching anything soon man, and im at 75. I feel ya man, soloing that beast sucks. 
---
Once you‚Äôre in, can you backtrack out or are just ou stuck?
---
If you know where to kill or just go on a hunting walk up the right side of the map, you won‚Äôt have an issue finding armor. Weightless marine armor is not that hard to find as it is capped currently at lvl 45 and drops from even mole miners who spawn at lvl 40. Grinding a full set goes faster if you have friends and along the way you will most likely grind out a full set of other armor while you are looking. Your charisma is also tied to your team based rewards so if you are running around with 1-3 charisma you are more likely to get shit. 
---
Farm at whitesprings for marine armor and other sets that are overlooked/ great like robot and that hunting raider group. Farm the queen for combat armor and marine. Do a hunting walk up from watogo to the top of the map and you will (or should) get a nice stack of legendaries. I farmed all my two/three star weightless marine. I got a full set of bolstered marine, and I‚Äôm working on unyealding. Find friends, use charisma, join groups when doing large events to get better rewards. Hope that helps.
---
Unpopular opinion, but this game is pretty shit so y'all should stop playing it. Or not, and continue to make yourselves miserable.
---
No no it just means that lazy devs didnt take worthless assets out before copy pasting this game üòÇ
---
You poor, poor creature! Did some enemy give it to you? Are you a sinner trying to pay for your sins?
---
Join us in misery! 
---
If /u/ISeeInHD doesn't end up getting the hammer, would you still be interested in selling to someone else?
---
I didn't know any better and made the mistake of completing the quest before I hit 50.  All Rise I've got is the next lower level. Guess it would make too much sense for all unique reward weapons/armor to be upgradeable.
---
Kuthorn on XBox
---
I feel my biggest frustration is that we seem to be on a 3 week patch cycle - or the patch cycle is just not necessarily consistent. 
---
There's no test server for people to test out upcoming changes, we are almost midway through February with no set patch date with notes on upcoming changes. 
---
So we're all just kinda sitting here, reading the "inside the vault" from last week, which tells us absolutely nothing. 
---
You're right, how can players even have faith in "future update" when we don't know if a future update is even planned (based on lack of communication)
---
Fucking $6 for using the fill tool and a heart clipart.
---
Problem is the unarmed armor mods and power armor mods are broke. They dont actually effect unarmed damage at all. The hydraulic pa bracer says +15 str when equipped but does not increase your str or your unarmed damage. The brawling mods for normal armor have been broke since beta. They have been mentioned a few times but never really talked about
---
Choices aren't allowed in Fallout anymore, takes too much effort.
---
So the amount of caps you lose is equal to level? I am totally in favor of this for people who go around pvping, make it 5 times level :D I would vastly enjoy the game more if pvp was removed completly
---
The dev room is a seperate cell you have to load into correct me if I'm wrong but if this is the case then only hacking or ini file editing would work.
---
Well they said from the beginning it was not single player, It can be played that way but was not the focus, so you are playing the game the way it was designed, there is room for all types of players and everyone needs to realise that. Calling another player a cancer because they play the game the way they like and not the way you like is the real problem.
---
Damn idk why but i didnt realize this wasnt cross console lol
---
sure! would you like to buy it now?
---
Done
---
Experience is between fighting at Vietnan war and getting gangraped, thats how pleasant it is.
---
I honestly never saw a path for how hyper-realist slow paced horse simulator became a dynamic and engaging online multiplayer experience. In some ways it feels like Rockstar went the malicious compliance route with TakeTwo...
---
If I worked at Bethesda I'd hire you
---
I don't play on PC and that's incredibly overpriced. 
---
When you are in PA, your armor is unequipped and you should see no affect from it. Though I do recall there was some buggyness associated with various armor/underarmors that decreased PA stats, those could still be in play to various degrees.
---
Thanks. I think I shall make sure mission indicator shows up before proceed next time
---
let me know if u get/have extra shielded plans. ill pay 5k caps.
---
You do you, man; just gonna tell you you‚Äôre gonna get extremely ripped off if you sell them for that price.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Blame Sony.
---
Leather armor hasn't looked this cool since Oblivion
---
Hope for the best, plan for the worst...   
---
If nothing else, these compilations will help Authors when we get access to Private servers.
---
5?
---
I don't agree with most of what you said, but I'm still here. You believe that you speak for everyone when you don't. So stop trying. Maybe people like me are just being a bit more quiet since all  people like you do is bitch and we're tired of defending a game we enjoy.
---
The bundle was $100 off so I felt it was worth it lol
---
Yeah, its like sticking your face in boiling water, you cant know until you do it!
---
I totally understand.  Just making an observation.  The damage of AP vs non-AP in FO76 is handled similar to how it's handled in Planetside.
---
THEY'RE IN THE FUCKING TREES
---
That works too.
---
THIS!!! LOL
---
As far as I know, the benefits gained from armor is nullified once you enter power armor. This is not a big deal to me, I have tactics for with and without PA. A lot of my stats get hit once I enter power armor so I prefer staying out of PA, plus you can craft outside of it. 
---
The Handmade Rifle mods don't feel like much of a grind after trying to unlock them for the Radium Rifle. Your fix wouldn't help much at the point where you're literally scrapping 200 rifles to get one mod. Armor unlocks are similar.
---
The difficulty of unlocking mods shouldn't be as dependent on how many mods you have remaining.
---
He is going to need it...
---
Put a plant in front of the Love and you got your own psycho hell. Wear a clown suit and it's game over

Considering how explosive worked with energy weapons, it would probably make the binoculars very deadly.
---
Holy misinformation Batman!
---
You'll loose your lvl in caps when you die in mutual pvp. Don't believe me I'll happily Merc you a few times and we can watch your caps dwindle.
---
It's how I make caps when I'm done squeezing venders. Look for workshops owned by someone 100+ lvl, go start to claim workshop then Merc the owner and take his caps. If he seeks revenge it lets me double dip into his pockets.
---
Thanks for the advice! Far beats crafting them. 
---
Oh, I've tried hard... and I'm not the only one..  
---
Consumed about 50 Buffout at one point, one by one, over the course of a couple hours, and failed to get an addition, did the same with Psycho, etc.  
---
No UI flags, unhappy PipBoy... nada.
---
I PvP every day... 
---
I roleplay every day... 
---
I give quests with risk reward and moral choice. 
---
I exploit the mechanics to engage PvP with people doing my quests. So i am the bossfight. 
---
I kill everyone who owns a workshop. 
---
I shake people down for caps and booze. 
---
I threaten to destroy decon showers if they dont pay me.
---
What do you guys even do in this game. Me and my gang have so much fun. 
---
U guys out picking flowers and fighting the one boss over and over again while we are out making the best of the wasteland. 
---
The devs wanted people to play a certain way. The subreddit brigades folks playing that way. 
---
Just give it a rest already. There arent going to be any more quests for you. Its my game now. Encourage my point of view. We are the ones actually encouraging player interraction. 
---
Won't be able to get in game till later this evening (hoping around 9pm EST). And only if /u/ISeeInHD decides not to take you up on the deal.
---
A bit complex but if you like fallout 4 and/or skyrim, you would surely enjoy this one too since its a similar kind of bug fest (in the good way)
---
It‚Äôs like a fallout 4 big sandbox with others players and no humans NPC.
---
There‚Äôs alots of quests and the region is quite beautiful.
---
But if you lose patience over bugs or disconnects, i recommend to avoid this game.
---
I welcome other's too do that, but I've made a habit of not doing it myself due to lack of responses in the past.
---
Nah, I'm paying it forward.  They're just taking up 10lbs in my stash.  I build Excavator shocks for people for 100 caps plus mats.
---
Why don't you buy them from me and sell them at a profit?  Or trade me something?
---

PC, bro.
---
I been playing since launch, but not daily. I am in the low 30s and still having fun. I play, on average, 2 hours a week with the occassional long session
---
No problem üòä
---
How‚Äôs the lore in this game?
---
They should had paid you 100 bucks for it my friend.
---
Still it could be worse. I bought the CE edition (at least I like the helmet) AND a digital copy. It would be better paying to get waterboarded.
---
Yes, PC is required. :(  
---
Generally speaking, especially on this forum, if you have questions and post specifics, you can likely find someone willing to DataMine (or a mod author to look it up)...
---
the inconsistency of legendary items corresponding to the tier of the dropping monster is why I haven‚Äôt bothered updating this game
---
He obviously wasn't talking about a power armor build. Some of us find power armor very obnoxious to use. Terrible ui.
---
There is a team up bug that you send people invites but they don't receive then and they get hung up and decline later on. I spent 6hrs saturday trying to join teams and worked a few times after complete ps4 restarts but was so annoying
---
I remember when you could find a crashed Starfleet shuttle.
---
I remember when you could find a herd of talking brahmin.
---
I remember walking up on a dematerializing TARDIS.
---
I remember a bridge keeper asking me my favorite color.
---
I remember going back in time and breaking the Vault 13 water chip.
---
The player base and target audience has sadly changed over the decades of the franchise. Each iteration is becoming less Weird Atomic Wasteland and more Gritty Atomic Punk.
---
The gameplay has been objectively simplified over the years for the mass appeal of the console market. 
---
War never changes, but sadly the gameplay does.
---
Tbh.. glass armor in oblivion was fucking beautiful in the mid day sun. 
---
It was an entire focus for one of my play throughs and while ebony and even dragon armor had their time in the lime light. Glass armor still gives me that warm fuzzy.
---
Ever saw the movie Reign of Fire, from 2002? Main story is just that. It has some nice quests here and there but overall it is it.
---
What is a drill? Is it a weapon, or junk like every other tool in the game?
---
I'm about to hit level 200, so a whole lot of hours. The one thing I can I agree on is the topic of content. This game desperately needs more end game content, imo. I've mentioned this before countless times, we need dungeons, raids, quest lines with big strategic boss fights.. would make this game epic. From what I understand the first 5 updates were for bug fixes &amp; server stability. Now bathesda is changing course toward content. And really hope that's the case 
---
Brutal!  
---
Plan to include the Friends list and team issues on either the UI Bugs page, or the "Player" page, will try to include.
---
Thanks, not a native
---
Yes, having a SPECIAL stat scale melee with no equivalent for any kind of ranged weapon is a serious problem.
---
Bloodied + Unyielding on top of that is also a serious problem.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôve got the UGL twice as a gun drop from the SBQ and bought another from a friend.
---
90% of the people who bought the game are casuals or quit already .
---
10% are end game players. 
---
25% of them like PvP on xbox. 
---
Okay yeah. Horizon was single player open world, but grind there is super pleasant. 
---
I just find out that you can block stairs with rug. It is time to do trapbase.
---
I keep thinking about Silkroad. 
---
It may have been that. It‚Äôll not really sure though, as it went through an awful lot of changes, and I‚Äôve not really known anyone from the west that played it to confirm. 
---
The issue with Airpods:
---
There is a headphone and a headset setting in the audio control panel. I disconnected the headset and it now works. 
---
Sad thing is, the only things that make this game tolerable are the glitches and bugs, such as duping, carry weight trick, etc. Would like to see that myself really.
---
I appreciate your testing, but I by no means find complete and I think that you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
---
Ah darn, forgot to do this.
---
Trueeeee!! And a more receptive gaming company
---
Ive never seen anyone bitch about theae topics. The bitching is always I wAs gRiEfeD aT a WoRkShOp. NeRf StUfF PlZ
---
Been waiting for the pink pip-boy! Thanks
---
FR sent.
---
I thought they had fixed it, but I still encounter the issue at workshops when it says to clear the enemies that the enemies dont spawn. There will be the diamond marker showing me where they should be but it's on the ground and there are no enemies. 
---
Cheating is charging us for this game.
---
Stable?
---
 There is always a dichotomy in any MMO. The crafters vs the looters. I always take the crafter side as there's far more to it, and have quit games where the looters became too powerful compared to crafters. 
---
 tl:dr I make all my own stuff, fuck legendaries. ;)
---
Yes, and I've found multiple sources that suggest one area North of Abby's Bunker, and another to the South, I would start from Abby's, &amp; check both locations repeatedly, finding different spawns; South was Rad Toad, Gulper, Sloth, &amp; Yao Guai, North was Deathclaw, Sloth, Wolf, Yao Guai.
---
Found them multiple times, less than half my level, both Cards maxed &amp; equipped, but I have never even got the "Tame" option to display.
---
because of the situation entirely out of your control, i‚Äôll sell it to you at that price
---
You seen that video of the inviting place that players run into. Unbeknownst to them, the owner watches. He runs around the side, presses a button
---
The process shut the front door and start the oven. Next, you only hear screams that turns into ashes. Still sizzling
---
The game you want to play is called Rust.
---
As others have mentioned, base armor stats and benefits don't usually apply when wearing PA. So, I tend to save the power armor for places I'll need damage or radiation resistance, and I go for the stealth, damage and AP refresh boosts for my base armor. 
---
Man... Reddit is the best!   I need to figure out how to give gold!  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7jIva4ijGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7jIva4ijGE)
---
Yes!
---
The deliverer from fo4. With a tiny frame. And giant power armor hands. How right? It was tiny! 
---
But hands down one of the best non random legendaries you could get early on.
---
Why are you still playing this game? I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
---
People ran out of stuff to do in the first month, do you just play to farm legendaries that drop no loot? A problem that has been around since the beginning of the game? What the fuck is there to do in the game at this point why are people playing it
---
haha no problem! are you on now?

#SURVIVAL HYPE TRAIN
---
Unique skins since launch include Blackbird (limited time), Christmas T51 (limited time), Hot Rodder (limited time), Playtime.   
---
Mothman and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have not been issued yet.  
---
Xbox One X, digital download (if it matters)
---
Bloom lighting effects become disabled whenever i adjust my settings, use photomode, or do anything that means I have saved data.
---
  Reported this to bethesda support and got the generic Reset console, delete save data, reinstall game.
---
  Have done all 3 multiple times and the issue always resurfaces. I am now stuck with default game settings, unable to use photomode, and forces me to constantly check for and delete saved and reserved data before I play. Even this method is not 100% sometimes I get an hour of play before the bloom disappears, sometimes 5 mins, sometimes 30s. 
---
  I noticed this after seeing PS4 and PC stream footage of Fallout 76. It is unclear to me how those 2 platforms don't suffer from this issue.
---
  I am wondering if any other XBox One X users have noticed the same issue and know of a better work around than the one stated above.
---
  Now I know my game could look better it kinda gets on my nerve.
---
  Any help from anyone would be much appreciated.
---
Do you have any idea how incredibly rare that is? 95% of players don‚Äôt have that resource, the game is broken, and just keeps breaking even more. There is nothing to do in the game once you beat the main story line and reach level 50. 
---
Cool thanks what level are you?
---
What is nice so far, is that none of those item are time limited
---
Dude, are you seriously going to compare a game still in alpha with only a handful of people working on it to seven days?
---
i added you.
---
Time is money and since it's obly a small% chance drop of wvent since last patch i disagree. 1k is 15min of work to tap out vedors for the day.
---
The early game is boring but you then follow how each factions lost by gathering info and solutions to the threat that killed them all.
---
There‚Äôs alot of holotapes and the writing is quite good, but alots of quests are; go there, take this, bring it to this box, go there , obtain this, bring it back, ect...
---
So literally only Hot Rodder and Playtime (wait hold up, did I really hear that right?  wtf is this) came out?
---
Ill add you later when i get the chance thank you
---
California and I will 
---
Now the list adds more details to try and give proof. 
---
If it‚Äôs so stupid why are you spending so much time defending it and yourself?
---
I got you on the trade glitch because it revealed something about you. You‚Äôre just looking st the negative and only focused on the negative.
---
You want to get out of the hole? First put down the shovel. 
---
No worries. I wasnt trying to be a dick. Your english is very impressive.
---
Had look up Silkroad. The character overviews mention levels. PoE has no levels for your character per say just better equipment and items that attach to your equipment that levels up.
---
Any armor interferes with Chameleon unless it has the Weightless legendary mod.
---
Mostly a riflemen so far unless I find something else I like and thank you I'll look into it
---
It sucks. I've stood by their side this whole ordeal. Said that it'll get better. It always does with Bethesda games. They address the bugs and improve it. Unfortunately I'm losing faith. I feel like they've given up on the project and are giving it bare minimum attention.
---
this idea in general may allow for a cheat to create unlimited caps
---
Both Enclave gas masks do not allow for any hats or helmets. Does not appear to be a clipping issue.
---
I Agree so much!!
---
I roleplay. 
---
I need area mics, costumes, lore and the ability to log out. I got work and other stuff. 
---
I love Fallout games. Rust doesnt have what i need. 
---
My expectation with fo76 was FO VR CHAT with a tounge in cheek broken pvp. I got exactly that and i love this game.
---
Please, Bethesda, put us out of our misery. Take the game offline if you have to if it means you can give us a much more complete product a year from now. Fallout is too good a franchise for this.
---
Leveling scale issue anyone? I just passed level 280 (thanks to all the cuddly ghouls and handsome supermutants and flying mariah careys), and now suddenly everything is almost like being reset. I‚Äôm getting atom rewards such as  ‚Äòscrap metal material (1/1)‚Äô  and ‚Äòkill a super mutant (1/1)‚Äô. When i walk around Watoga the robots spawned next to me are mostly level 14 and 38. When I go to whitespring the ghouls are level 9 most of the time, with some 42 and a few 62. When I go to Uranium Fever the mole miners are all level 40, nothing higher, so the legendary loots are all level 35-40 items. Yesterday I did a super mutant hoard event, all of them were below level 20. Those all happened when I was the only player in the area, I saw the low level creatures spawned right before my eyes. Is there an internal setting in the game that resets players‚Äô level after certain figure? I saw a level 330 player the other day I can only imagine how easy his life must be! 
---
The game is foundering on a technical level, even 3 months in. That said, I enjoyed 76 a decent amount while I still had story missions to complete, which should take you a while. 
---
The metal armor and combat armor should all be one together, and include future additions (Lets say they add other kit with paint slot)
---
You buy pink, you can place it on any armor with paint slot.
---
so one and so forth. I am pretty sure people skip skins because they dont fit their need and kit
---
It's physically impossible not to be near a stash box in 76. I'm just saying it's not that hard to not have it in the first place with some proper management 
---
Wait what even is its place? Does it give stealth buffs?
---
This definitely! And make it available for ALL weapons/armor. I have a non lego grenade launcher that I use sometimes and I'm always afraid I'll accidentally scrap.
---
I've been *finding* multiple Technical Data--found 4 or 5 in the Enclave Military Wing just last night!--but you only ever show *one* in inventory.  That's probably where that issue lies.
---
I'm just trying to find something that works better for me a while the tactical hunting rifle was good for me but as I try to go to different regions I find that I have a hard time with the enemies
---
The price though! It's nice if you love it though :)
---
lol :D
---
It happens when you actually are smart.

They didn't fu#k it up with PVP, they fuc#ed it up with PVE- One f#cking SBQ that requires 0 teamwork. Even android RPG games provide more challenge that this. If anything, the game would lasted longer with more PVP, atleast then people wouldn't burnt out content so fast.
---
As always, this post needs the Attention of Bethesda.  Please see the OP.
---
You guys should just add the OP to your friends list and keep an eye out for his new posts.

Haven't found anything besides facts in ehat you have written, nothing even closely reminding an attack
---
I'd have to shitcan you from my team.
---
Why would they care, it is now about future buyers of the game and future micro-transactions on/or Free to Play
---
I'm with you with that, was confident back in the "official B.e.t.a" (even though it feels like we're still in that) and kept defending them after release for some time too.
---
Though as time progresses and we see little to no real development on the game other than "bugfixes and other fuckups" I more and more believe in the theory that Bethesda simply set this up to get a reason to shutdown their Austin studios and declare the whole "Coop/Multiplayer" part as not "wanted" by the community like some other companies did in the past
---
And whilst we are talking about scrapping weapons let us scrap legendary ones for a mod for for the weapon.
---
It's nice for people that loves pink. I personnaly dont but I can see the need. Prices wise, it's big for simple designs.
---
I still don't know the frames pricing model though. I would not pay 1$ for an Instagram filter that adds borders. They should be free and generate interest into other atomic items but people sharing screenshot
---
You evil person however, I am laughing at the thought of the person coming ‚Äúhome‚Äù and just freaking out at all the toilets 
---
PvP is for immature people who are really pathetic IRL, hence their need to bully people online just to give them a sense of self confidence and have the feeling of being empowered. Want to test your combat skills and tactics join the military, when you do hit me up im at NAS lemoore CA. And as far as this game goes, it is advertised as a PvE game and nowhere was it advertised as a PvP.  Straight from Bethesda's Amazon ad 
---
"Reclamation Day, 2102. Twenty-five years after the bombs fall, you and your fellow Vault Dwellers‚Äîchosen from the nation‚Äôs best and brightest ‚Äì emerge into post-nuclear America. Play solo or join together as you explore, quest, build, and triumph against the wasteland‚Äôs greatest threats." 
---
This along with the entirety of the product description can be used as a case of false advertising in a legal stand point if they continue to force PvP to its users who purchased their product based upon the product descriptions. Last but not least online bullying is a criminal offense which has varying consequences depending on your state and jurisdiction.  
---
Farm the Whitespring, you know you want to, or eBay...
---
That‚Äôs a feature!
---
pointless, sell it to vendors or just drop it.
---
Haven't played in a bit, but pre-nerf by 5\* demo expert perk + nuka cola grenades used against max level glow ghouls in whitespring often just crippled everything, not even a kill.  Some would die, but not all.  I imagine now nades are just mass-crippling devices, with or without the perk.
---
Sure but I'll take that over styrofoam durability armor.
---
Lv300?
---
Legit?
---
I see...
---
I‚Äôve killed 3 3* legendaries and none of have dropped anything. The 2* ones barely drop anything good either. Does make me sad indeed
---
I've posted something similar before and got downvoted to hell but I cant agree more with you. 
---
There are far too many perks dedicated to just making the game playable. Which leaves barely ant room to play with builds or fun cards.
---
Also the way the cards are grouped together is poorly done. 
---
Cards to help durability of weapons and armor should be tied to crafting cardss, not separate cards. 
---
There are multiple carry weight cards for foods, chems, junk. These should have been combined and leveled together. 
---
There are cards to increase your blast radius with grenades and then a separate card just to view the angle you throw them at? Why?
---
Basically just to be able to play somewhat comfortably you have to use most points in qol cards, and can usually level up one specific type of weapon which gives you very little reason to play around with new weapons or armor you may find. 
---
Theres also cards that are completely useless and no one will ever pick. A card just to penetrate insect armor? Really? So many cards just cant be used because you're using every slot just to squeak by a playable build. 
---
Once you level past 50 theres virtually no reward at all. Even if we only got an extra perk point every 5 level ups past 50 it would be nice to give us something to play with. 
---
I'd love a rework of the perk cards themselves but extra points would be an easy fix and make the game more rewarding. 
---
I'd like Tank Killer to work with Pistols. They are SO weak now. God damn it 
---
Here are some things about Horde events:
---
* Surrounding enemies sometimes will kill boss before you can even reach them.
---
* Cranberry Bog Horde events that are surrounded by level 68 enemies will have bosses that are level 25
---
* Level scaling in general for Horde events is terrible. All of the enemies/bosses are half the level of surrounding enemies making the events useless for farming legendaries. 
---
* Loot drops from 3\* bosses are totally bugged. This is what I got from a level 35 boss [https://i.imgur.com/v5TVtg4.png](https://i.imgur.com/v5TVtg4.png)
---
i hid wind chimes in my friends hluse
---
I would add to the QoL that all explosives(not the legendary mod) need a boost in damage. You have it incorrectly listed as a bug for the Demolition perk, even though it isnt a bug. Also I didnt see that the auto grenage launcher not being effected by Heavy weapons perks. 
---
I don't think that there should be a weight reduction perk for rifles, they just need to adjust their base weight permantly.
---
126
---
tried all of that it seems to be tied to my account somehow because i can log my wifes account on my xbox and her friends list pulls up fine in game
---
&gt;my playstyle is better than your playstyle
---
alright kid. just hope your """raider""" squad doesn't come across someone in full sentinel/cavalier.
---
&gt;There arent going to be any more quests for you.
---
&gt;We are the ones actually encouraging player interraction.
---
and that's wholly irrelevant because, like I said, interaction is an afterthought at best. the lack of content isn't because the devs are enabling you, it's because the devs are gone.
---
This is clearly a troll.
---
Like Romeo and Juliette.
---
Oh wow.   Ok i am out to lunch then, I thought they stacked.
---
isn't that just duplicated stuff though, with 2 characters over lvl 100 I've never even seem weightless marine gear so that feels really fishy.
---
i might just have had shit luck of course. 
---
Their needs to be a level cap in the new PvP mode if they want to to be remotely balanced so we don't have to deal with this.
---
Which is a shame. The idea is so much fun. I thourghly enjoy getting on and playing with my friends and helping low level guys. I enjoy Applachaia. I just rebuilt my camp last night. I'm just tires of the unbalanced updates and the constant stream of bugs I feel an intern could fix. I don't mind the atom shop either. When they said there would be a way to earn atoms in game, I was like oh yeah sure. But I was wrong. They really do. But everything in the shop is over inflated and not to mention there is no consistentcy. Why does one floor plan cost 400 and another 500? Why are the emotes and poses varied from 150-800? I'd be more inclined to buy more and actaull purchase real atoms if the content was fairly priced and good. But between that and having a hard time giving money to what I feel is a sinking ship is a waste imo.
---
Ok thank you.
---
sell a bobby pin and the vendor account total should refresh to 200
---
Absolutely. 
---
The inside the vault posts have potential but only just.
---
The patch notes are nice but don't tell the story of the the long term goals they have for the game
---
I'd love to see a description of specific short, medium and long term goals for the games development with the progress outlined each week.
---
We've already bought the game and you aren't selling us dlc so there is little reason for secrecy and more reason to share deeper info (keep us engaged to buy mtx)
---
I wish the unarmed mods did anything meaningful for PA.
---
Earlier on I managed to snag the plans for Excavator Rusty knuckles, it took my 15str unmodified unarmed damage in PA from ~26 to a whopping ~35. And naturally the bleed damage was negligible too.
---
Do you know if Hydraulic Bracers does any better?
---
Ya
---
It‚Äôs possible addiction is coded as disease resistance, because Bethesda.  
---
I for one routinely get addiction effects.  
---
Hell, I‚Äôll log in now and try. 
---
It has a pretty tiny range (relatively speaking) centered around your camp.  And it is nice and flashy.  But unless you are moving your camp around to where you use it, it doesn't do much good.
---
Occasionally I drop the targeting smoke grenades on the couple areas just outside my Camp location.  But it's more for fun than function.
---
There is a perk that makes you deal +120% damage to Camp and Workshop objects, a full assassin set of armor for killing players, PvP events, the entire workshop defence system and the Hunter/Hunted game mode...   
---
Now we get PvP servers because PvP players asked for them:  
---
"*Since the launch of Fallout 76, we‚Äôve received lots of feedback from  some of our more competitive players who requested greater challenge,  fewer restrictions, and more incentives when it comes to PVP combat.  With this in mind, we began developing Survival mode* "  
---
You are still saying that this isn't a game where PvP has a role?  
---
There is no endgame, farming the queen is useless, my build is completed and I've explored every place.  
---
PvP it's the only thing that makes me come back to this game, so I'm a "griefing douche".  
---
I do this with the pointing vault boy
---
Well if that's your opinion, but remember opinions are highly subjective. 
---
Again with the lying thing. You‚Äôre impossible. I spent 60 dollars and I‚Äôm unhappy with what I‚Äôve got. That‚Äôs why I complain about it. You however, have no reason to be getting pissed at me and calling me a liar. Y‚Äôall are a toxic bunch. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with discussing the game‚Äôs problems without making sure you mention a bunch of stuff it does right, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to agree as a person who goes on r/filthycasuals.
---
They've probably sorted out the new sbq loot drops. I bet the delay is due to them deciding which new bugs to add with the next update. 
---
You realize it has to exist in the first place for it to be duplicated, right?
---
damn, watoga never seems to spawn legendary's whenever i get there, tried it like 25 times and only 1 run had about 4 legendary's.
---
Maybe xbox sucks? mole miners seems a smart idea though I'll keep that in mind. uranium fever might be a good guess too
---
How is this even possible? 
---
Granted, the SAM turrets are a bit overkill but it would actually be kinda neat to be able to build the pre-war military turrets. 
---
It come with a box that auto refill smoke grenade for using it.
---
Byt you somehow 6 of electricity to make it work .
---
Like F4, it‚Äôs powerful but the enemies got eternity to get out of the range
---
Have you tried logging into to your Bethesda account from her Xbox?
---
Elevation seems to affect the range too.
---
Thanks, and that is what I was thinking, so I really doubt that I will make one then and save the resources for something else.
---
&gt; Could we have ~~it so that Level =~~ Increased stash capacity.
---
FTFY, no need to gate it.
---
It's a trade off. The perforating mag has higher burst DPS, but the larger size of the stinging mag will probably get you higher sustained DPS for things that take more than 10 shots to kill. That said, if you have speed demon and the perk that increases reload speed I would bet that the benefit of the larger ammo capacity mags diminishes significantly.
---
Yeah, the enemies do not really hit us hard they just take forever to kill with guns what is very upseting. In this game its better to use a wooden board than a gun. Even with full gun perks you will still do more dmg with a melee weapon. Its upseting really as first person SHOOTERS are not designed around melee, its so boring and not fun to use melee in this type of games but sadly its the way to go here if you want to kill stuff.
---
Tri-barrel isn't a scrap mod. You need to find the plan, which may be extremely difficult or impossible since patch 5. Most of the weapon and armor mod plans disappeared from the vendors.
---
It's the stackable benefits I'm after as I role with the Mysteries gear still for my sneak class character.
---
lMaO
---
The mechanic is basically the same as Fo4. The range is fairly limited but the firepower is devastating when it hits the target. If I recall correctly you get about four to five rounds on target with one gun and you can deploy multiple guns but I‚Äôm not sure if you get a 1/1 increase in rounds for each additional gun you deploy. 
---
of course, but if the drop chances are so low I'm sure a full set shouldn't just be available on the market. or I'd have to be stupidly expensive because of its rarity.
---
then again i guess the market prices have been ruined by dupers anyway.
---
i just don't like to obtain "fake" gear.. if that makes any sense
---
Cheers!  :)
---
Ok targetted harassment could be bullying which requires chasing someone to a different server.
---
If i walk up to you in game and attack you or shake you down... Im not targetting you, im a raider. I target everyone. 
---
Your an idiot.
---
Only chasing people into other servers could be interpretted that way. You have all the tools you need to be a wuss. Like server hopping
---
You are ruining america man.
---
I spent probably two weeks looking for the spiked walking cane mod, only slightly stronger than the common barbed mod. A wiki said the plan was a random reward for forest dailies/events, and the one I seemed to get the most was guarding that teapot for 8 minutes at a time.
---
I also crafted and scrapped about a hundred canes hoping to learn it that way and got nothing, not even barbed.
---
Eventually the spiked mod (though not the plan) showed up at the Whitespring station vendor.
---
Lol my sniper rifle do 160damage and it can oneshot most things, why should something firing 200x faster have nearly same damage?
---
I can confirm that Martial Artist doesn‚Äôt increase swing speed on Two-Handed weapons, at least my Grognak‚Äôs Axe
---
what kinda plastic's in watoga? is it a big place? I've avoided all the schools for some reason thus far
---
By the way...... whodunnit?
---
&gt; isn't that just duplicated stuff though?
---
Assuming you're content with 1* weightless marine armor, it's "common" enough that it's not necessarily duped (and wouldn't be worth the effort).
---
You alone are a small sample size. Multiply your efforts over a million players and there's bound to be plenty of legitimate 1* items on the market.
---
yes it doesnt show my in game friends list no matter whos xbox i log in on
---
Yes! I had my wife on a scavenger hunt for wind chimes in her base
---
There's still one in a display shelf, I don't know if she hasn't seen it or is just leaving it there, but I'm not saying anything!
---
Lets see what happens in 3 months when you dont get any new content
---
We are taking over. Its the whole point of the post. Bethesda made this game to be played like we play.
---
My squads in full sentinal cavaler assasin unyielding. We are end game. We own whatever server we play on.
---
Just quit. That game should've died before launch. You deserve better, and Bethesda can do better, but the won't if they can keep selling you trash.
---
I've owned and played the last 5 Bethesda games (I'm counting NV there, though) but I'm not touching 76. I wouldn't play it if it was free. And I won't get TES6 if they don't make a new engine first.
---
[well mine are already crafted and ready for anyone that wants them at 1000 caps.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4UsHuFM)  
---
approved
---
Playtime is pint-size-slasheresque
---
good stuff!!
---
Look you totally exaggerated about it all happening in 3 minutes. It wasn't an estimate. It was just you trying to make it seem like it's so bad, you can't even play for a few minutes before the game craps out. 
---
That's all you were doing. Why? Because you want to believe the worst about the game.
---
More so, you think your $60 dollars makes you right. But I paid $60 and you seem to think my money doesn't matter as much as yours. Why? 
---
You aren't discussing the games problems.
---
You're just lying to try and get attention and bait people. You have a real problem. I mean, look how much time you've spent talking about a game you played for 3 minutes.
---
You don't think there's something kind of fucked up on your end when you do that?
---
Honest people just walk away. You have a need to get people to believe your lies. 
---
oh yeah 1* will be fine.. if this is true (and i do believe you) is this also true for unyielding gear? because I'm currently running an absolute garbage unyielding set and I'd love an upgrade.
---
how would i go about getting such a thing? posting on the trading subreddits usually yields a dead post with no replies in my experience. or do you just have spend a lot of time waiting for the perfect offer? 
---
I really want to see one of the reactions from this lol
---
Seems like the pr department can¬¥t give out any Information about things that are not definitely in development. In some way I can understand their strategy because anything coming from Bethesda is going to be looked at from a negative side until they delivery meaningful changes. Maybe with the upcoming roadmap they open up more and start to tell us which request are even possible from a technical standpoint and where they are on a priority list.
---
Repeating a buff, they are trying as little as possible everywhere.
---
I can make you a hunting rifle with scope, compensator etc up to level 50 if you want it.
---
&gt; I feel like furious is really only good on high rate of fire weapons
---
That's because it is only good on high RoF weapons, and even then it's has the potential to be so-so. If a stray bullet hits another mob your damage bonus gets reset. There are just too many draw backs and caveats to furious that holds it back from actually being one of the best. It's still strong though.
---
This has been discussed a long time ago, and currently it seems to more of a "planned" content but currently has no access through legit means.
---
Thanks for confirming my suspicions!
---
sadly the whole game feels a bit like not much thought went into things because apparently the game is supposed to be in development since Fallout 4 release but we all see how much has come to fruition of it... and with the current amount of "progress" the devs make with each "update" we already can see why and also why the next "asked by the community" feature is a relaunch of the map with a few features removed called "Survival Update"...
---
My god the Playtime ones were horrible. Blue pink and white stripes with freakin Comic Sans on the chest plate. COMIC SANS!
---
Dude, there's only one guy left working on FO76, he doesn't have time to be chatting to us.
---
lol, killed around 30 legendary robits in about an hour just waiting around phoenix.
---
My friend put six flamingos around my camp when I was building mine. When he was building his I put the bronze baseball statue at the top of the stairs. I heard him scream as he thought it was a scorched. 
---
Melee is overwhelmingly superior for anything that doesn't fly, for sure.
---
The problem is that you need a lot of shooters to do enough DPS to the SBQ in the time allotted. 
---
The gameplay design is just...horrible in this title. They took all of the worst design issues from FO3/FO4/Skyrim and then put them at the forefront of FO76.
---
That's my only explanation for what happened with this game: these problems have been present in Beth titles for ages, but only finally blew up on them with this title.
---
Well that's annoying. I had it bugged a while ago as well. All vendors showed 0 caps, couldnt sell anything for days. Eventually fixed itself.
---
Wood armor also hits 0 weight with weightless and the shrouded mod. You should also get the stealth benefits unless it is still bugged and not working properly.
---
Aww, I was hoping you had a trick to get them to stay at their original *level. Id rather not server hop constantly but I feel like I have to.
---
Holy shit what that‚Äôs crazy. 
---
I think she lands eventually by herself, doesnt she? Still I agree with everything else you said, couldnt have said any better.
---
I must have missed that post about the Devs. If you could spare a minute or two today, any chance you could track that down for me? I‚Äôd be sincerely appreciative of such a thing.
---
It's Chally, not Shelly! Have you even played this game?
---
Hahaha nice üëå what location did u meet it?
---
There‚Äôs something to be said about a game that doesn‚Äôt respect the player bases time. As much as I enjoy the grind for rewarding items, it just doesn‚Äôt appear that the ‚Äúgrind‚Äù in this game respects my time. 
---
It's not great, but it's better than the 52% on MC. A big part of the reason it's so low is that salty PC fanboys review bombed the game because BGS didn't release it on Steam, as well as hundreds of other people overreacting to glitches during the beta and giving reviews of "0/10, literally unplayable."
---
After the hate train starts chugging along it's hard to stop, and shit just spiraled out of control at that point.
---
r/fo76bazaar or r/market76
---
Do yourself a favor and learn the definition of harrassment, both in general and legal terms.
---
A person should not be subjected to the inconvenience of having to server hop due to being harrassed by another player, they have paid for the game just like everyone else and are entitled to having a pleasant experience with their game. If i wanted PvP i would have bought a PvP game that is advertised as such. Heck i would rather play fortnite since its free.
---
I am doing my fair share of serving this country, what are you doing aside from causing grief to the people we protect? 
---
Hey no disrespect, just friendly advice. If you want something, and it's only going to cost you caps, just get it. Especially if it's a situation like this, where the total cost can be replaced in very short order. I do understand you can't buy from this seller because of differing platforms but 1K caps ain't shit, especially for something you aren't going to get otherwise. It's just fake money. 
---
The PvP vision of FO76 will never happen. But neither will any other vision. It's a dead game.
---
Kiss my ass my Princess bed is the shit(I‚Äôm being super serious here) my PA with Christmas lights hell yeah all day
---
Uh, when I have the brawling mod on armor, it increases the listed damage of my power fist. 
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers
---
Seems like you know where the trade subs are already, so get browsing. Posting "WTB" threads isn't usually that productive but as a buyer you can look at other player's posted "WTS" lists for what you want. It should be pretty easy to find what you're looking for if you really just want 1* armors.
---
I don't know it it's OK to post my own trade thread here but if you look at my post history it's there and I have a few pieces of basic unyielding gear.
---
We‚Äôre in desperate need of a road map. We need something that shows that they care about the game and will continue to fix it over time. 
---
They have to update PC and console at the same time otherwise the community will RIP them to shreds. Just imagine the backlash that would ensue from favoritism, hate videos on YouTube would florish, there would be numerous online articles claiming bgs only cares about PC players ect. Any possible action they do related to this game will be turned negative in any way possible. I'm not defending bgs this is just what I would see happening. 
---
Why do you want a pipe bolt? Wouldn‚Äôt you like to have a lever action instead?
---
Not sure, never done a fight where someone (usually me) wasn't trying to crit her in the air. She also has fucking absurd damage resistance that turns basically everything into chip damage.
---
Anyway, its horribly balance. The fight lacks the intricacy of boss fights with huge health pools because you just sit there and shoot her. Teams with rad sponge and ghoulish shared are also insanely tanky so basically nobody in the fight can actually die.
---
"Why can't they do the simple things??"   
---
I feel like I say this a lot while playing FO76.
---
Except there would still be a massive database managing those separate baby stashes at your camp.
---
Using the heart expression should increase damage and exp by 5% while in a group from the morale boost.
---
Fantastic list!
---
I‚Äôve played about 100 hours not just those 3 minutes. Don‚Äôt know why you assumed that. I did walk away that first month. Just tried it again cause my friend wanted to see and I wanted to see if I‚Äôd finally get my 60 dollars worth. Still not lying though. Don‚Äôt need you to believe me you‚Äôre clearly being ridiculous. Also never said anything about my money being more important or whatever the fuck kinda words your putting in my mouth. I am talking about the game‚Äôs problems. Specifically the lag, disconnects, and camp glitches. 
---
I down vote rage salt thats just random anger if they are salty and trying to help I upvote but lets be honest thats few and far between even noticed several of the I quit people are the same people I saw the last 5 times they quit....
---
Princess bed and PA with Christmas lights and bells ftwüëç
---
There're Yao Guai near the cemetery up in the northeast down the road going east from Prickett's Fort. My bf and I were trying to complete a mission at the cemetery and two of them spawned. You might need to go down the hill from the cemetery a bit to get them to spawn. I don't know what triggers them.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I feel the system should have every possible mix of prefix and item available to make the good ones worthwhile. If every high level player could just run around one shotting mirelurk queens and collecting explosive shotguns it would be a pretty rubbish system. 
---
I can totally see that, until the RNG gods bless me and I get a two-shot or explosive this'll have to do
---
Bullshit.
---
Warframe does this just fine.
---
Again as a console player I would rather see progress on other platforms than be left completely in the dark.
---
DOA
---
Unfortunately I get that same sense. Unless Bethesda‚Äôs next patch is a homerun, the game will die. 
---
Cheating is the only fun left.
---
It's their robobrains...
---
yeah but look at how many times they posted something coming up and then the rage of random people when it wasn't exactly as they thought it would be - not as promised just thought 
---
I mean if I said hey guys were getting pizza and I walk in with the pizza but not the one they wanted and get shot with a tazer for it I'd be worried to about telling anyone anything 
---
at same time we need a balance of info and pr released so its kind of a balancing act 
---
I agree with all this.   i feel like the communication has been very poor even after they said they wanted it to be better.    I kinda gave them they benefit of the doubt with Christmas and New Years.  but since they it's like they just stopped communicating with us in any meaningful way,    Don't get me wrong the CM that are in here have been acknowledging on passing on info but i feel like it's been a one way street.   we give em all this feedback and then we don't hear anything.   But for all the hype this game has gotten.  i still feel like i'm playing the beta still sometimes from back in OCT.    All these Cool events were supposed to be coming and all these "great" cool things we were supposed to be getting and there's been nothing of real note.    This games been out for several months now and i feel the lack of information and the lack on what the hell is even going on is what's killing me.    I can Deal with the bugs.   i can deal with the same game play loop but for the love of god.   tell me what's coming.   tell me something to get me excited at least a little bit.
---
Jokes on you. My camp budget is maxed. 
---
Nooo! My only weakness!
---
I met in around abbys bunker it had a cigarette!!
---
so it comes down browsing, not really a fan of that but i guess i could give that a shot. thank for all the info! 
---
Nice find... I never noticed the directions, just that it would freaking spin around whenever I would leave camp and come back. Double annoying since this is a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù item...
---
So I guess the solution is to place the workbench first, let it orient itself to the galactic plane and tachyon vortex, then construct the rest of the camp around it ;-)
---
My All Rise gets about 280 on a team with herd mentality and no twisted muscles. My instigating war drum is 250, if they're full health its 500. I also spread my perks out to cover different weapons and explosives, I like to have options.

Give me back my Hunter's Hood, I'll buy in the Atom store. Why isn't it "in the game" when I bought it from a vendor bot? It was removed with the latest patch because it was a dev room item, but it has no stats so it doesn't effect gameplay
---
Surprisingly no! Go ahead and play with [the formula](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance):  
---
DamageCoeff = Min(0.99,(PaperDamage/DamageResist)^0.366 √ó0.5)  
---
You'll notice that, other when your DamageCoeff is already &gt;= 0.99*, decreasing the DamageResist by a percentage always raises the DamageCoeff by a set amount.
---
^*Requires ^that ^you ^already ^deal ^massively ^more ^damage ^than ^the ^target's ^resistance.
---
Yeah, it would be instantly abused if implemented.
---
&gt;We've already bought the game and you aren't selling us dlc so there is little reason for secrecy and more reason to share deeper info (keep us engaged to buy mtx)
---
Also, there are some of us gamers who will learn from this experience and decide not to purchase further bethesda products, I've already stopped buying Rockstar and EA products, won't to be too hard to add Bethesda to that mix too. 
---
The single biggest mistake, in my opinion, was not launching with dedicated PvE and PvP servers. They could have coop on PvE and whatever flavor of PvP in the other.  Instead they tried to be everyone‚Äôs everything and did none of it well. 
---
Personally I feel like what it needs even more badly is an actually usable ironsight, or moddable sight.
---
I have mixed feelings on the survival mode. First being, that's a awfully big task to implement into the game. A game that's already not (in my eyes at 100%). I feel the time and energy could be invested in patching and balancing. My biggest defense of it is this. Everyone is saying that we didn't ask for it. Realistically we did. Plenty of people have complained about pvp. No one wanted it etc. They aren't realistically going to remove pvp. Instead they're focusing on getting the majority of pvp'ers into their own grief based server, essentially removing them from us. It's not a 100% fix but will help in my opinion. I just don't think the game is ready for something so large yet.
---
Hey come on man. Todd promised a glow in the dark map, We got a glow in the dark map.   Stop being so ungrateful. 
---
Sarcasm aside, I agree. 
---
I'd wish they had a  BOS sentinel paint job.  I'd buy one if they did.
---
Yeah here's hoping for an in-game trading option.
---
Also most of the subs have a corresponding Discord if you use that.
---
Huh
---
No but it is a negative opinion that gets to the front page based on he said she said. Which is the same basis as someone never playing the game shitting on it just because they read about it. 
---
I think they gave up on the game.
---
I love the PA feature where it doesn't show the up/down indicator on map markers.
---
The game was advertised as pvp. Im pvp roleplaying. I only bought the game for the pvp aspect. Consider other consumers too.
---
You are one opting out of a portion of the game. Yes, you should totally hop servers if you dont want to take part in a harmless fun pvp aspect. I am allowed to play this way. 
---
God you are awful. You wouldnt believe who i am behind this fake reddit account either. No one cares about your career.
---
I didnt think the fat boy program is still going on. Glad to hear they still have that going in our military. Great program.
---
I design and manufacture spine implants. Ive spent 5 years on defense manufacturing prior to moving to medical. I worked on CH47s and JSFs. 
---
Then i go home and roleplay and pvp on fallout like a freedom loving american. 
---
Server hop like a bitch when you see me. 
---
Hold up, I read your comment entirely wrong. I agree with your initial post that they're missing out on my money by not making it a package deal (unlocking a paint pattern for all weaps/armor).
---
Initially I read it as them losing out on money if they followed through with this. My bad.
---
My XB1 is hardwired and I get "infinite loading screens" frequently enough that it's put me off from claiming most workshops. The only thing I typically claim any more is Poseidon and the Landfill because I can walk back and forth between them in a couple minutes, and there's plenty of enemies scattered around Charleston that I can keep busy fighting stuff without risking loading into an interior cell or fast traveling. 
---
I agree! I don‚Äôt really play PvP at all. So seeing that as thing in this wasn‚Äôt exciting or fun for me. If they had a dedicated PvP server, my Faction battle idea could fit perfectly in there and make the game feel different from the regular game mode.
---
The thing is that Bethesda try and do little wacky things and the player base kicks off about it, like the kid in a fridge, a quest in FO4 clearly designed to just be a bit of a joke, but loads of people kick off about it and complain
---
Oh but there are microtransactions, just with Ebay and not Bethesda. Because of their shit loot tables they created the duppers themselves(glitch or not) and a black market. I just checked, you can easily get most 3\* legendaries for $10 or less, a lot less. Which is cheap enough for even a 10 year old with a shit allowance and a PayPal account.
---
I dont know dude, they respond alot in reddit, if anything I feel like our issues that we have are ignored instead of prioritized 
---
Store all of your scrapped junk in your stash and then try again - fixes mine
---
I think Bethesda doesn't really understand how MMO's work. They are too content on releasing a single player game, and reaping the rewards of their franchises.
---
Yeah, my friend really wants Log Cabin Walls.
---
I'd like to see some camo Enclave or Brotherhood Over-Armor.
---
Enough of the hello kitty my little pony stuff.  Nobody in the apocalypse would wear that crap.  Or if they did, they wouldn't be alive long while wearing hot pink.....lol
---
Unfortunately the best weapon I‚Äôve ever picked up is an AAE pipe rifle (amongst a sea of lead pipes and Spears...). I run a rifleman build. I think I‚Äôm stuck with it until I can find/afford an AAE hunting.
---
That's exactly what I did last night. I rebuild my camp around this. I PAID FOR THIS WORKBENCH AND DAMNIT ILL USE IT IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION. lol
---
The superhero costumes from a week or two back seem pretty popular.
---
That's the one.
---
Max damage on Shotgun: 60%
---
Max damage on rifle: 60%
---
Max damage on heavy weapons: 60%
---
Max damage on Automatic weapons: 60%
---
Max damage on pistols: 60%
---
Max damage on explosives: 60% 
---
Yeah.... no, they clearly made a mistake...lol!!!
---
Max damage reduction on PA: 60%
---
Max damage reduction on regular armor: 60%
---
Yep, clearly beth didn't want it to be 60%......
---
Johnny Toiletseed, you are the hero we need right now.
---
My friends got tired of me doing this exact thing. All of their camps budgets are maxed out to prevent me from putting anymore toilets in. 
---
My easiest explanation is FALLOUT 3,4, and 76 all take place in New England they‚Äôre all just connected somehow.
---
IF there even is a roadmap! 
---
because looking at how it currently is there's no reason to not have released it yet as there's not much more to loose anyway, they showed the next "DLC"is gonna be a lazy relaunch of the map which nobody asked for (but is cheap to develope, so we see where they are coming from)  and with the recent lack of hotfixes for their messed up hotfixes showed they have no desire to fix hot bugs until they actually effect their own economy (duping)...
---
Even if they couldn't keep ALL the promises of a roadmap it would still show they had actual plans for this game....but until then I even doubt they do
---
I'd love the blue quantum nuka cola skin from f4 doc. That looks sweet and they have the files there already. Or stick on the end of a quest for rose
---
Yes - Must be Crafted with a Rifle Stock such as 'Forceful'
---
West Virginia is not in New England
---
There‚Äôs lots of choices we‚Äôll figure something out 
---
Haven‚Äôt found harness but the helm yes. And if it dies RIP helm 
---
Physics?
---
Most likely an oversight.
---
I'd love for it to be related to the monorail time machine but my hope for the choo-choo time machine will most likely let me down :(
---
And choices were the reason we loved Fallout games, and games made by Bethesda in general, the gameplay was always secondary to their unique ‚Äúbe whatever you want to be‚Äù RPG style. I don‚Äôt know how they forgot that reason for their success while making this game.
---
Forward Station Alpha, but they aren't that rare if you travel allot, not fast travel.
---
East coast same shit , not California or Las Vegas where other games take place 
---
It helps to remember that the Atom shop items are on a set release schedule stretching way back to the early days of game development.  What you are seeing are time capsules from a distant past when the devs figured the choice of pastel croquet mallet skin would be one of the most important issues facing players.
---
At least half of the user name checks out üòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah, I'd love to see TOUGHER enemies and events that drop better rewards!
---
Every event and creature except the SBQ can be EASILY solo'd right now.  That's why people are bored.  No challenge, and the current rewards are crap.
---
Give me an enemy that it takes 30 mins to kill and drops a guaranteed GOOD 3 STAR legendary item!  I'll gladlly waste 30 stimpacks, tons of ammo, and repairing all my armor to kill that.  Then I'll feel good that I got GOOD rewards for that fight, and feel justified in farming the mats, meds, and repair items needed to prepare for the next battle!
---
I'm one of those in the "Hurry up and give us something" camp, but I do agree with you. Dropping new content on top of a shaky foundation won't do us any good really. I don't expect new content for a while. Just want to get high level communication to say this is what you can expect in the next couple weeks, then the next few months. Once a week someone posting a communication to say this is where we are, this is what we are working on now. 
---
Sorry just a sarcastic comment on a free bonus ‚Äúfeature‚Äù from Bethesda (skinned workbench acting as a compass)...
---
Yesterday I was looking back at all the inside the vaults dating back to the first one.
---
One thing I noticed is the first month's newsletters bulleted hard dates and what to expect on those patch days.
---
Maybe its me, but they have gotten progressively more coy about whats coming down the pipeline. Particularly this last one, which didnt even specify an estimated date for patch 6. To be fair, two of them did go into detail about survival mode (couldnt be any less excited about that), another was damage control on patch 5.
---
This was a good quote: 
---
&gt;We welcome your feedback about the game and will continue to prioritize based on what you‚Äôre sharing
---
I guess that explains why they increased the event cooldown timers *everyone* was complaining about before getting to the scorchbeast attack, which itv 2/7 is the first time ive *ever* heard *anyone* ever complain about it. *Ever*... 
---
(I couldve used any sarcastic example of unrequested nerfs, but I chose event timers because both of those solutions were changing a single variable.)
---
Totally wearing the tropical short suit haha
---
No you're totally good bud. It just went over my head lol
---
I been doing census violence for a week now all day hopping servers and havent got protected or shielded yet i got treated and resistant from a vendor the drop rate must be crazy rare it seems.
---
\#3 I disagree on the survival elements, though perhaps making a third server that got rid of it would be an option.
---
Survival mods are super popular on not only the Fallout games but also on Elder Scrolls games.  I know that it was a driving factor for me enjoying NV and was a welcome addition to Fallout 4.  
---
So I think a not-so-small portion of the community does enjoy the survival aspects, and there were plenty of perks and mutations that could easily make it less of a hassle   
---
&gt;Lets see what happens in 3 months when you dont get any new content
---
none of us is getting any new content at this rate because the game is dying.
---
&gt;We are taking over. Its the whole point of the post. Bethesda made this game to be played like we play.
---
do you even understand game design? if anything, they designed the game with solo players in mind.
---
&gt;My squads in full sentinal cavaler assasin unyielding. We are end game. We own whatever server we play on.
---
you know what's more op than that? esc - quit - play
---
Historical accuracy who needs it, thanks 
---
I thought the only thing that mattered for VATS was your Perception, not your gun‚Äôs accuracy. Have you tested this further? 
---
Your claim was this: ‚ÄúThey will drop if you get them to agro and health regen‚Äù. 
---
You don‚Äôt seem to understand that all you‚Äôve proved is that legendary mobs drop legendary gear. You haven‚Äôt linked agro and health regen to guaranteed drops in any way. That is why it‚Äôs a superstition. My experience is that even when following your advice you sometimes will still not get a drop. That debunks your claim.
---
‚ÄúAny of us can find ways to not get loot, please present a method that you find does work if you want to contribute something useful to this discussion.‚Äù
---
That is a ridiculous argument. Contributing incorrect information is not useful. Debunking incorrect information is useful. How can you not understand that? If people follow your advice they will waste time and ammo for no reason. Preventing them from doing that is a useful contribution. 
---
Your accusation about straw men and generalisations are equally ridiculous. You have made a specific claim and I have specifically rebutted it. There are no straw men or generalisations that I can see. We are trading anecdotal evidence. The difference is that my anecdotal evidence describes an event outside the norm (legendary enemies should drop legendary gear) and therefore adds new information, while your anecdotal evidence just describes the norm and therefore contributes nothing.
---
This is my last comment as I don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre arguing in good faith. 
---
I do feel small in this, and I think my ego IS still inflated from Fallout 4. Asking for help in Reddit was definitely a great idea, and I've picked up some great tips. 
---
I don't feel like I offer very much assistance to others being on a team, and this partially dampens my irl moral compass, but I've been getting used to staying at a low level. 
---
Lol had to do it 
---
I was literally thinking about this yesterday except I think it should scale with level like everything else and max out at lvl 50.  So have a Base Stash of 500 lb.  Then for each level you add 10 lbs up to a max of 1000 (lvl 50).
---
Not only would this makes sense but follows everything else (maxing out at lvl 50) and at max your stash limit is also the same as the now hard character limit of 1000 lbs. 
---
There is a city in my state called New London...doesn‚Äôt that sound better 
---
at least you can find legendaries. no events are up EVER lately. wonder why?
---
Thanks, I was not aware of that.
---
I think they knew they'd need more staff, but didn't have the money or didn't want to invest it in new staff until they new the game had a following. Even if they may have known it would work out, they weren't willing to put up any extra money. They waited for the game to make money to support itself. Which means, hopefully, we  can only go up from here.
---
Playtime is the only one I‚Äôve purchased with real money haha! (shameful I know, but I loved it)
---
Literally just go to vendors in watoga and server hop.  People sell things all of the time.  
---
This thursday is Valentine's Day
---
Wow, what a surprise they put Valentine-themed items in the store!
---
I have all those perks. But it sucks that a lot of my perk space is dedicated to making the game normal to me. I did survival in NV, and never touched it in Fallout 4. I don‚Äôt mind the radiation and stuff. It‚Äôs the hunger and thirst mechanics are so unwanted and such a chore that they aren‚Äôt fun. I think like in NV and 4, it should be optional, not the standard.
---
I have seen many posts that say Uranium Fever only drops low level stuff, but that is simply not true.
---
I will agree that you get more low level stuff from certain events (UF included), but I have personally gotten both level 35 &amp; 45 TSE Handmades from Uranium Fever, as well as several decent max level armor drops.
---
I have also gotten low level drops from everywhere, even well past level 100, I recently got a level 20 Furious Explosive Gatling during a SBQ battle from a Mirelurk Queen, RNG can be aa fickle bitch sometimes, and very rewarding on rare occasions. 
---
I often wonder what this game would be like if not for all the Duping and other exploits.
---
If you play on Xbox, I‚Äôll build the tri barrel for you for just the Materials needed. 
---
Honestly I just got bored. There‚Äôs not much left to do and since they nerfed demolition expert my heavy explosive character is shit. Plus the fact that when I‚Äôm grinding for legendary‚Äôs all I usually get is wood armor from a 3 star legendary 
---
Seriously, the one thing keeping me from enjoying this game now is that my VATS build character is super struggling right now because the system is so broken.
---
I sadly don't think it would help much tbh because those that want to do "normal" PvP are just gonna come and ask if you want to fight and aren't the ones you want gone....griefers on the other hand aren't gonna move a inch towards the PvP servers as they solely thrive on the feeling of hurting other people that decided against PvP.
---
The thing Bethesda had (and still has) to do was refine PvP so griefers can't annoy you anymore and those that want PvP can still have it.
---
If you pre-ordered, you should know better than to pre-order games by now, especially from Bethesda.  
---
If you bought at after launch, you knew what you were getting yourself into.
---
If you bought it at launch, there was *some* indication this would be a rocky game leading up to that point. But ultimately, you couldn't have known and I get it. But there's definitely $60 worth of entertainment in the game to be experienced. 
---
The endgame is crap, but since when is that an important part of Fallout games? Yes, it has online features (PVP, co-op), but that doesn't mean you're supposed to treat it like an MMO where there's a near infinite supply of endgame content for you to do. And they're not charging you a subscription so it's not like you're continually wasting money to play a game you don't find engaging. Just stop playing for a while, come back to it later, and go on with your life. and inb4 "but atom shop"--just don't use it if it offends you so much. If there's something you really want, the game gives you plenty of atom just from casual gameplay alone to afford literally anything in the shop. 
---
You can offer your teammates free perk cards by sharing them. You need 3 charisma to share a rank 1 card üëç You could even share Inspirational so they get bonus xp too. 
---
I like the enthusiasm
---
are you even sure they're full-time?
---
I appreciate the response and willingness to assist. I‚Äôll be on hopefully for a bit this afternoon and definitely after 10 PST.
---
üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
You'll get a lot more responses if you post this in FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  People there buy and sell stuff like this for caps all the time.  You're looking at the 5k to 13k range for that type of gun.
---
A weapon that is junk. Haha
---
I tried everything I could including forceful on my Explosive pipe rifle but no luck. I did get it to work on a pipe bolt action though. 
---
Does the marine armor still weigh 0 when buttressed and ultra-light? I have a full set of weightless marine limbs banked and they used to not apply the weightless mod to the weight from upgrades.
---
Way to pull random stats out of your ass and spout them like it's true. 
---
I 100% deserved it. 
---
It's just a byproduct of having extremely complex lore lines that span between different titles.
---
I bet if you looked at their lore flow charts, it must look like the electrical diagram for a nuclear power plant....lol
---
With all the problems in the game, I'm not worried about this one :)
---
So now you can look at your lady and inform her you just got legendary wood and if she smiles you can go play fun games instead.
---
You're going to have to lock your doors well! I guess the problem with items sitting about in your camp house, outside the stash box is increased risk of theft.
---
Thank you very much for your help / effort.  Wasnt aware you did not have to max out the perk card to move from shotgunner to expert shotgunner for example (in other words that you could get master shotgunner without having all three levels of expert shotgunner)
---
Sadly, I already knew this wouldn‚Äôt work from experience in their previous titles. It‚Äôs sad that the arm modifications are beyond awful, my character is a boxer type (based upon myself) and I was hoping power armour would work. But alas, Bethesda.
---
In the realm of fuck ups, that's impressive 
---
If I make you a hardened lever action or hardened sniper that should be better than what you have. Someone destroyed my base so I‚Äôm moving anyway. Either way you‚Äôll have something.
---
Unless it is Hot Pink X01 with emergency protocols....which my character dearly needs.   
---
Gimmick* immersion*
---
No, it's not Luck or Charisma dependent, it's simple RNG, and the only way to get better stuff, is to get more rolls, with well over 2000 legendary kills, I would say you can expect 1 out of every 200 to be great, 5 out of 100 to be OK, and the rest are just vendor fodder.
---
They seem to spawn randomly but a good place to lv sniper is harpers ferry u can make your way above the first house infront of spawn location and just snipe like 10 enemies on the right side of map and if u get closer to the other half more enemies spawn all while your above same house rarely get hit. Theres a sniper rifle spawn on one of the outlooks there. 
---
Sorry I should have posted that these are at least 1 star weapons too. What do I require to repair them?
---
Is there even a slight way to avoid PvP altogether in F76? 
---
Think they are like 0.7 and 1.2 or something when fully upgraded. But still that is almost nothing. 
---
I would need a calculator to play with that formula. The last time I looked at the fo4 wiki page for damage resistance, it showed that lower damage vs higher armor had its damage reduced more than higher damage vs that same amount of armor.
---
I guess I took that to mean that there was an armor curve that changes based on these two numbers, and maximizing the damage boost from AP would be putting those two numbers in optimal position with each other.  If that's not at all the case, then that makes AA universally appealing.
---
VATs isn't sure if you wanted to make some quick enemies or not... just saying...
---
I want one. Level 4 home defense perk
---
I agree. Actually ran into it last night rebuilding. Guy came over to my half built camp. Walls and stairs were all I had. Went to town on it. My buddy and I killed him easily. Matter of fact. He really didn't even try to fight back. Just do as much damage as possible. He came back 4x before I messaged him and finally left the server.
---
I see your rational and reasonable minds can disagree.
---
My opinion is based on observations of 100+levels of legendary farming. I'm not going to write a thesis on it.
---
I'm not sure why you seem bent on scoring an easy victory and while I admit that there may holes if my hypothesis you can't seem to see the obvious one in yours. 
---
I do not believe that you are arguing in good faith.
---
Good day sir.
---
Yeah that's what I mean about the target audience changing. This younger generation that didn't grow up with the original Fallouts in my ***opinion*** wants a post apocalyptic grim dark Call of Duty.
---
I know it really isn't represenative of the player base in total but take a look at the top mods on the Nexus and you will see where this ***opinion*** can form from.
---
lol don't ask me I'm not Bethesda dude, I'm just telling people what happened. If you want to debate me if its real or not go ahead idgaf. Doesn't matter me and like 10 other people stopped playing fallout 76 because of the bugs and the random bans, and the stupid nerfs. Hes getting his account back but like i said we all stopped.  Also the community is becoming garbage. People who will attack people and defend Bethesda like everything they make is gold lol.  Also ususally they want the game to work or be a win so they are willing to over look things and tear down people to make them feel like they didn't just waste 60$.
---
I just romped the wasteland with it and i can‚Äôt complain! I appreciate your input today!
---
I have it, it just takes a ton of weapons. Same with the gauss rifle mods.
---
If it was the real apocolypse you'd catch a bullet and be gone in the first 30 minutes....lol
---
I don't care if they add "some" of that, but holy cow add some serious "camo and military" options as well.
---
The fact that they are hiring three producers screams to me that a mass exodus took place.
---
This is exactly why we don't have a roadmap. The producer is the one in charge of the direction of the game, development priorities and future content. They can't show us this information because there isn't anyone at the reigns.
---
Cheers, my auto correct on my phone by the looks of it doesn't change it to the correct spelling lol
---
No, it's a scrap mod
---
Source: I literally learned the mod the first time I scrapped a Minigun
---
I have a noob question.  What do the diamonds mean?  Can you upgrade it to full diamonds?
---
Yeah, I think an additional 5 lbs of stash weight per level would be large enough to be noticeable but still limited enough to force decisions about what to keep. 
---
I would have appreciated 100 more space at level 20 or 250 more space at level 50. 
---
Serious problem? 
---
I'm starting to think they are just going to let this game go silently into the night and bet on other upcoming titles to save their name.
---
I play on PS4 but thanks anyway 
---
the closest thing is to switch on Pacifist Mode under settings &gt; game. 
---
And just don‚Äôt become Wanted. üòÇ
---
Oh and be aware that if your teammate engages in pvp, the whole team is flagged as fair game. So you‚Äôll either have to quickly turn off pacific mode (good luck) or quickly leave the team (probably faster). 
---
This is why I came here and am looking for the answer to this. Did you ever confirm if it increases drops?
---
good to know, to bad wood is well pretty weak for most builds. Still if it works it works and wood is common as hell almost always find weightless wood on vendors do to people trashing it for being wood.
---
Not only that, but the Atom Store is a different team.  If that team were reading the comments on Reddit they could have readily monetized easy things like basic colors for power armors and regular armors, or clean versions of each weapon type.  Pink metal armor?  Why not pink leather, combat, etc?  The failure to add easy, demanded Atom Store content shows a lack of attention and business acumen.   
---
Auto-incorrect lol.
---
Anyway, good luck with Beth adding items that aren't lulFortnite quality. What's sad is that if they add the mothman paints I would definitely be spending atoms
---
Best way to farm Watoga is stealth build with Gauss rifle one shots them, as for it not spawning legenadaries. The more players there the more Legendary enemies it spawns.  
---
You also want to kill any robot that spawns nomater what to force the bot build locations to make new ones. Watoga is unique in it keeps a constant amount of robots even if players wipe it. It is also the only farm location that can be done so from safety once mayor for a day is done.
---
Such a well written post, good job OP... and I wholeheartedly agree. Truth to be told, I feel like 76 still needs a lot of polish... I jumped in on the action when it launched, but sort of stopped playing when I reached around level 20, awaiting some progress from the developers. Cheers!
---
Hmm... Now I'm intrigued. I've heard of this mode but didn't really understand the benefits of it. How do you become Wanted? I'm guessing if someone (multiple?) has a hit out on you...
---
There is so much I don't know about this game, no WONDER I'm having such a hard time.
---
wow, yeah i guess that works too, don't even have to kill anything haha
---
It only takes that many weapons to unlock every last mod.
---
You can unlock the majority of the mods with far fewer weapons I found I had to craft maybe 50 or so of any one gun before I had all the mods I felt I needed.
---
But yeah I agree it shouldn't become progressively harder to unlock mods as you go though I think that's a different discussion.
---
I have several BOS Outfits, &amp; Under Armors, message me on XBL, I won't be on till around 5pm CST
---
GT= Medieval Paul
---
I just think of them as a bug gun that's about to get scrapped. I've seen lots of them. 
---
i get more or less regular visits from it at my camp close to Solomonds pond, great guy :D
---
Tbh even some of the fortnite skins are better than what were getting, at least some of them are original and cool looking ( i dont play fortnite, my son does tho so have seen some lol)
---
Will do 
---
the more players thing i didn't know, might give that a shot, thanks 
---
The fact that they have not offered camo versions of each armor type irritates me.   They could also easily reskin guns‚Äîmake the 10mm look like a Colt Model 1911, as an example.  
---
&gt;I had a 4 star hand made
---
What are the effects?
---
I break into people's camps, drop a single unit of fertilizer (on their bed, preferably) along with a molotov cocktail and the I.O.U Toilet Paper note.
---
I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt added a respec token (like ESO) and stash increase on the atom store.
---
No idea 
---
I want a level 1000 molerat!
---
What % are end game? 
---
Is there an achievment someone can check on xbox that would tie it together?
---
R&amp;g station had the cot this morning... xb1
---
i don't really use discord because I'm on xbox but i do have it installed on my laptop so might give that a shot
---
Means the amount of stats the item has, can drop 1, 2 or 3 statted legendaries
---
Gilded wall clock plans are at studio 58 in whitesprings mall.  Unless you're looking for a player that would sell them for less.  I don't have any but I've seen them there.
---
If the effects are good and you decide to sell it, don‚Äôt get lowballed
---
Damn, should have guessed Studio 58! Thank you!
---
Nice! Thank you!
---
It‚Äôs easy, quick and effective and a good way to gear up alts, or mains if you haven‚Äôt been lucky.  You can check both vendors, do a circuit and kill any legendaries, server hop and repeat 
---
I played for a couple months and slowly plodded my way to level 60. The nihilistic endgame experience disappoints me greatly and made me quit playing altogether. Playing FNV again with a few choice mods and having a great time. Might revisit 76 in a year or so.
---
Haven't had any problems. Just fixed a 50 caliber machine gun this morning for one character. And later logged on with my other character that's still sitting in flatwoods and repaired a 10mm pistol to keep the molerats away. 
---
So yeah, its the player's fault for trusting they would deliver a good game. Got it.
---
You hit the nail in the head frankly.
---
Like I get that people are disapointed with the game, hell Im disapointed too, but we have to remenber that like, raging at them, while it does show you're not happy with the current situation, can also have that effect. 
---
Credit is due where credit is due. Dont get upset when they fix something, get upset when they break something else. Which, has happened in this sub, but i've seen more of the former than the latter. And the straight up missinformation too, "duping is back after the patch" or "ive been banned for mass crafting" stuff.
---
Im sure someone will acuse me of being a fanboy, a shill or whatever, defending Bethesda means you are, but honestly, the fuck up is already done, dont get angry at them for trying to fix things, you can just wait the game to get better, or press for a refund/uninstall, and move on.
---
Life is too short to get upset over a game like this, there are better games and things to do out there.
---
I agree with you, but I'm trying to think of a way to make PvP rewarding, while scaling well to power scaling, and isn't too exploitable (generating caps out of thin air, etc). 
---
Serious. Problem.
---
Why? 
---
I started at FO3 and to me at least, Fallout is a dark world with innapropiate humour placed into it, like when you see the teddy bears or at the time, knomes doing stupid things
---
I would easily drop 1800 Atoms on pink PA.   However, no such items exist in prior data mines, so I am not getting my hopes up.  
---
A set spawns in the locked room under the New River Gorge bridge. Its only accessible with a key that can be gotten in Camden Park. 
---
Level 116 and a full STASH figure this is a more constructive way to give away some scrap to other players. 
---
Awesome!
---
But there should still be a penalty for being in debt. Otherwise they'll stay in the red forever.
---
I love when randos add me to their party. I always leave a toilet in their camp 
---
I explain it as both technology already existing on firefighting Protectrons, the Cryolator not being the Overseer's first attempt at it, and "Cryolator" being a generic term for "freeze gun."
---
So apparently it's not just our team that has this problem. Killing 3 stars in a nuke zone just to get ZERO rewards, or possibly worse. A 1 star chameleon wood armor piece. 
---
yeah...that's your basic griefer....most of them aren't interested in "PvP" at all...just deal most damage asap and Alt+F4 or relog before retaliation...so creating PvP servers with the hope of getting rid of griefers is like hoping to get Half-Life 3 released in a month
---
That's insane. I didn't know that.
---
He is, but he has had to take a lot of time-off lately because of his kids' snow days. He doesn't live in Austin, he remotes in from Minneapolis. He also drives for Uber in his spare time.
---
It's really weird to me that there's a croquet mallot skin, but not a classic Super Sledge. Or that there are pink and camo suits, but none of the clean suit variants from FO4. Isn't the purpose of the shop to make money?
---
Yes all pipe weapons are effected by both pistol and non auto rifle perks.
---
I have a pipe revolver and pipe pistol that uses them, I'm hoping it's a feature and not a bug because I don't want Bethesda to nerf this effect ( although I have a sneaking suspicion they'll do it anyway :( ) 
---
True. Still seems better than getting squat for playing as intended.
---
Or could go with the original idea of putting a lien on all characters on the offender's account. With the change that the player collects after 30 days if the lien hasn't been paid off? With the lien being permanent on all characters of the account until paid.
---
Usually they start adding in the time limited stuff after the first day of the new week, either tonight or tomorrow around 7pm est they‚Äôll put something up.
---
This would be awesome. 
---
I hate seeking people running around wearing bobbleheads and grognak costumes. 
---
How I got my base set that and trading. 
---
How do you know what 3 star goes for? Is it solely based on what it can do?
---
Fallout 76 is just the dream of the Vault Dweller after being woken up and then being put back into cryostasis.
---
We appreciate the feedback and will pass this along to the dev team. 
---
I agree - I would totally sport some pink Combat / Marine armor
---
Wonder if this topic just inadvertently raised the price of weightless legendary armors.
---
But with all the negative will of the players from this game will their next title even be able to save them?  I admit I got screwed and preordered 76 for the beta, but I know for  a fact I won't be doing that with Starfield.  Hell, I might not even get Starfield if Outer Worlds is good.
---
There seem to be some downvote bots here and on /r/fallout.  Either that or really petty haters AND fanbois are just collectively downvoting EVERYTHING.
---
It's not just the usual downvote fuzzing either, it's posts going negative for no reason in completely innocuous topics.
---
This would be something I'd be down for. I just posted earlier of my complaints in leveling, and to limp back to my CAMP only to see it's been decorated by a stylish stranger would be the highlight of the wasteland. 
---
I still come around semi regurlarly to add my central feedback to posts that have to do with any of the areas-
---
* containers as a means of player impact on the world and other players
---
* team system that can level, gain perks, and build more permanently as a unit
---
* perk and UI/action bar customization, responsiveness improvement and usability streamlining
---
* fixing trade and death bags
---
* new container types for display, utility, and item transfer/bartering to replace the placeholder feeling drop bag, both for building in CAMP and portable style (which only is power armor frames as of now in the game)
---
* modding for the standard game and a workshop like system with server browsing to take this game forward on the power of the most creative fans and the ongoing interaction with the rest of the fanbase
---
* but I stopped expecting to get any indication my feedback has reached someone who brought the game to us in this kind of classic analog adventure RP game state.
---
* Its purity for character and base building is wonderfully smashed with the multiplayer elements that remind me of the original oldschool creator driven small server multiplayer experiences we were having before the age of persistent MMO and the fullness of battle net, discord, and steam for multiplayer grouping..
---
* it's like they don't realize the magic, they don't understand what they did right, so my feedback was originally focused on calling attention to that, so the most obvious ways of finishing it and fixing player frustrations would be clearly communicated in the frame of what the game already is, its core identity and vision we already enjoy.
---
While you're not wrong, I'd like to point out that listening does not require speaking. They are two seperate actions. 
---
I killed a lvl 170 at level 25 with mistress dress, eye of ra, and the sword of bastet. He was in full X-01 and it took 3 swings.
---
They are not rare items. I have like 7 that i have been saving up for a reason to use them lol i wouldn't worry about some salty soy bous.
---
Was gonna say exactly this. I quit in January but I've been keeping up with the Inside the Vault posts and this subreddit. Nothing I've seen from Bethesda so far has tempted me to come back. If I knew long term plans and whether private servers and player generated content were more than just words, it'd go a long way in bringing me back
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound bannable at all
---
Having a particular build dealing disproportionately more damage than others isn't desirable. Especially with a PvP mode coming.
---
Although once you cross the threshold of one-shotting another player regardless of their defenses the rest of the damage becomes superfluous.
---
"Why is my camp full of vault boys!?"
---
there have been strong assertions that a roadmap exists and will be shared. Soon. the community managers posting on our threads continue to claim this is the case.
---
the stealthboy mk3's have never worked for me in this game i click it and nothing happens the regular ones seem to work fine
---
I do love my silver shroud coat, sunglasses and enclave officer hat, and blacck pip-boy, but yeah I would rather they add setting-appropriate stuff. Give me a rusted paint job for power armor, or gunmetal paint for combat armor. Disciples or operators raider outfits would be nice.
---
I know :( But I‚Äôm a loser and wrote a list of what stuff from the datamines I want so long ago I resigned myself to paying 600-700 atoms for a pip-boy skin and a stash skin (earned atoms, ofc). At least it‚Äôs not 800+ atoms. I thought they might inflate the price cos they have a target market (women) like they did with ‚ÄúTough Girl‚Äù photo pose which costs almost double what ‚ÄúTough Guy‚Äù did.
---
While I agree, having all those new SPECIAL points would also increase the amount of fun obtainable in game.  Fun is something that is frowned upon by BGS in FO76.  The ability to use pistols, rifles AND melee?  At the same time?!  While also being able to pick locks and hack terminals!??!!1!one!!  No way dude.
---
Look for the fluff posts that don't say anything negative about Bethesda. You'll find them there every so often.
---
My experience is that without the survival aspects, food and drink was basically pointless.  Why carry food when you have stimpacks that heal you to full? 
---
Immersion to an extent, but I can take a few shotgun blasts to the face anyways, so that kinda gets thrown out the window. 
---
I completely agree that it's not necessarily enjoyable by everyone - they could retool it so that keeping fed and hydrated was more of a buff than a requirement. 
---
Cause they don't really care. They are just placating us right now while the people in charge try to figure out how to salvage this mess.
---
I have had people add me to their party just so I could fix their damn floating camp.... surprisingly I have had three people accept that. 
---
Private servers + modding would probably sell it for many of us who did not buy the game. We know modders can fix the issues most likely and I would rather have a private server to roll with my friends anyways.
---
I digress I have little if any faith that we will get either of those areas until they fix this game up...
---
No you won't be banned, they are an in game item that you can find quite easily, these people don't like others having an advantage by the sound of it.
---
I have at least 4 mk3's myself and 9 others plus 5 phantom devices, all of which I have either found or crafted ( in the case of phantom devices)
---
It depends on the effects of each individual star. Inspect the item while looking at it in your stash or inventory (X on PC, not sure on other consoles) Generally Bloodied, Furious, Anti-armor, and Two-shot are the best first star effects. Fire rate, explosive, vats criticals, and +10% damage while aiming are great second star effects. Any third effects are usually decent. 
---
I hope they plan something big. But its Bethesda so i dont know... 
---
I've gotten this with not a huge amount of farming at whitespring. Weightless seems to drop all the time for me
---
Point out where the game is advertised as PvP. 
---
And if it's PvP you want then PvP with players who would want to play that way and leave players who don't want to PvP alone. Courtesy, it's that simple. 
---
I'm not even going to respond to your comments as far as real life choices and belittle you and your career,  the only point i am trying to get across is not everybody wants to PvP, some people would rather rebuild and go through the story line. When you have seen so much destruction IRL you would rather see a world in peace that is trying to heal, even if its just in a virtual setting. 
---
I write silly words in people's bases if possible. Labelling their bedside table 'pills and porn' or writing poo in strange places.
---
I‚Äôm running as a Heavy.  It‚Äôs insane fun. 
---
All perk cards maxed when possible:
---
STR
---
Heavy Gunner 
---
Expert Heavy Gunner 
---
Master Heavy Gunner 
---
Bullet Shield
---
Lock and Load
---
INT
---
Power User
---
Stabilized 
---
Gunsmith
---
Batteries Included (only at 1)
---
LUCK
---
One Gun Army
---
Bloody Mess
---
I switch between a 3* TSE .50 Cal and a 1* Mutant‚Äôs Gatling Laser.
---
The .50 Cal is much more expensive to get ammo for, as I‚Äôm always farming lead and steel. But that Gatling Laser... Take Poseidon, power it up, farm cores. 1k shots per core with the fast reload speed between Lock and Load and Speed Demon, the damage comes FAST. 
---
The only thing you should be accused of is............getting absolutely screwed on a trade deal......lol
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  If you can't buy them for 100 caps or less there, you're not trying hard enough :)
---
John Tams had a version in Sharpe.... 
---
https://youtu.be/8y3NTTBA9bg
---
Im going to kill everyone i meet in the game. Thanks for trying to tell me how to play tho. 
---
Ill keep an eye out for icedtee84
---
It's Pretty random. Some days I can play for hours without issues (well, sorta) and today I had 3 disconnects in half an hour. 
---
The first time was unique, though. Was smashing through whitesprings, had loads of flux plants there, and nothing but bloated glowing ones, as if it was nuked, but it wasn't. Had fun for about 10 minutes, collected a bunch of flux, and in the middle of a 3 star legendary fight the server kicked me out. Goddamn.
---
Reload, fast travel to camp, scrap junk, stash materials, open pip boy because thirsty, poof disconnected from server. Again.
---
Reloaded again, started walking towards whitesprings (camp is not far off) I cross the street, minding my own business, poof, disconnected. AGAIN.
---
I gave up then. I'll try again tomorrow.
---
Obviously there are either time travellers or parallel dimension jumpers in west virginia.....Zetans?
---
I have a silver shroud outfit but even that is buggy as f, it glitches with my enclave underarmor, I bought it with free atoms because everything else is meh
---
This makes some sense, would be nice if it was hidden in a terminal somewhere within FO76
---
You're fucked. I got banned for using them.
---
I hoping it's not over yet.  If it is after just 2 or 3 months there better be refunds coming or a class action to get some money back.  I probably wouldn't buy another Bethesda game again if this happens.
---
Haha! Nice one. I should start saving up caps for my own vandalism schemes, it's just so expensive!
---
It is, or at least was, because I certainly got it through scrapping Super Mutant miniguns as I found them.
---
I would like to see a Vendor Run mapped out that is efficient on Caps travel costs and makes you the most money.
---
Enjoy the grind that ruined the game then.
---
I‚Äôm convinced the entire dev team is two interns arguing about the best way forward but without the authority to make a decision. 
---
Unbelievable. 
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll pay more attention.
---
Only if said mob shows up on the mini map like a bounty would. That way those who want to fight can and those who don't know to stay clear.  
---
My main is a Stealth/Sniper build, but since the Nerf patch, my best weapon is an instigating Death Tambo (Base Damage=242 at 200% repair) x 2 for 1st hit, x2.15 sneak, +incisor = well over 1000, 1 shots level 68 Ghouls with ease, and nearly 1 shots a level 91 Deathclaw. 
---
Why are you still playing this game?!
---
hmm....one could think that Bethesda is actively trying to ignore in what state the game currently is....CMs keeping to "positive threads",twitter saying the usual bla bla advertisement, timed patches as if the game currently is in no urgent need of fixing and they merely add "content" to an finished game...
---
I bought every one as I love roleplaying characters
---
Who is we? I think you mean you...
---
This is another post about a person with personal preference, that projects that personal preference onto the entire community. They assume what they want, what all their friends want, is what everybody wants. 
---
Bethesda ain't perfect here, they have bungled a lot of things with this game. But as a general rule, this sub isn't the majority of players. They have meta data on who has bought the game, who is playing the game and they are targeting the bigger picture. The atom shop is being populated with mass appeal items for a reason. I am not saying it is right, or it is wrong... but I am arguing that they ARE putting out the types of things \*most\* people want. 
---
article on the subject: [LINK](http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/149466049419/80-20-5) as well as [Link](http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/128047058096/the-masses-the-myth-the-metrics) 
---
They're probably planning on loot-boxes or micro-transaction weapons.  They just can't launch them now because they don't really have any good will from the player-base.
---
My prediction : At the first hint that the player-base is happy about something, anything, they'll announce *"We understand that some people don't have time to hunt down every last legendary, so in the interest of giving players more choices on how to experience the game, we've put the high-level weapons in the Atom Store as a completely optional purchase!"*
---
But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they'll do something more clever.
---
Nah, this is high damage yes but of course you have to get in close to your target to light them up which evens the playing field some what, you also need patience to get to this stage of a build which puts a lot of people off, patience and many levels, a lot of research and farming, a lot of gathering and time consuming restraints, you don't just stumble upon this kind of build and this one is still not even finished. There is reward for your patience and the reward is strong but you much pick your shots carefully, you must choose when to fight and know when you are beaten, and as previously stated the flip side to the coin is I'm going into the most dangerous situations in the game as a solo player with not a lot more than 10% health and a Chinese officers sword. If I'm going against 2 or 3 tse donkeys then it evens out. 
---
I really like the idea of it being a buff! That hadn‚Äôt even occurred to me! I would imagine that was a simple retooling rather than an overhaul like I suggested. Maybe each of the meats you get give you something related to that animal. Wolf meat has you run faster, scotchbeast let‚Äôs you jump higher/or minimizes fall damage, etc
---
I‚Äôve always had some food on me, but I‚Äôm the pack mule kind of player. My points go into string back and fast travel while over encumbered in the normal Fallouts haha. So I usually have some food and water and other junk on me haha
---
I think I know the problem with escape artist:
---
* In fo4 and fo76 before the most recent patch, the whole "enemies lose sight of you when you run away" mechanic was handled by temporarily adding a "chameleon" effect to the player when you first enter stealth. 
---
* The effect lasts maybe half a second, and this breaks enemy awareness, placing you back into "hidden" so long as enemies are not in very close proximity.
---
* You can tell this is what happens by calling up your pip boy immediately after entering stealth: If you do this fast enough you will notice the "chameleon" effect prevents you from seeing the pip boy correctly (in fo76 you need to use the pip boy mode where it shows the animation of the player raising their arm to their face, not the one where it pulls up the ui without the arm animation).
---
* After the latest patch this no longer happens, ever.
---
* Thus I believe the latest patch removed the temporary chameleon effect from escape artist which is why enemies don't lose awareness when you run off and then re-enter stealth.
---
this is my best guess whats going on
---
Is it the pizza guy from DICE?
---
This whole game is just one bad QOL experience, in general. Your post is spot on, but you missed possibly the most annoying aspect of cards: you constantly have to swap between your play cards, your crafting cards (durab, duper, chem, etc), and then you have to swap your hacker/lockpicking in all of the time.
---
Another major issue is that end game enemies are such massive damage sponges, that you really, really, really want to stack that DPS, which means no QOL cards.
---
Isn't this game fun (I stopped playing)?
---
The Terminal on the wall to the right of Fort Defiance entrance, you can download the schematics to build the BOS Recon Rifle.
---
Level 1 version is 49 base damage, level 5=78.
---
I outfit my new characters with these.
---
I agree.  It takes so little effort to make these things.  At least do it for all armors that accept paint.
---
I'd totally rock pink, but I have no use for Metal Armor.
---
Vats biggest issue is the stuttering and lag. I enjoy the IDEA of it, but it‚Äôs difficult when 20 freaks are swarming you and you‚Äôre only getting 10 fps.
---
The pip boy holds similar issues since it doesn‚Äôt pause the game but takes forever to load sometimes
---
While there is only one found in Fallout 4, the terminal entry that details its creation doesn't necessarily imply that he was the sole creator of the idea.
---
"I've long dreamed of making cryogenic freezing available in a portable, on-demand form. The Cryolator is my latest attempt. Thankfully, we're in no short supply of the chemicals and components I need to tinker with the prototype. It's a nice way to occupy the time as we wait for the All-Clear Signal. "
---
The way I see it, the Overseer really just rigged a flamethrower that shoots cryogenic spray.  He definitely created the cryolator that was in Vault 111, but he probably wasn't the only person with the idea.  People are creative and ambitious in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, so my guess is that other people had the same idea of making a portable cryogenic freeze-gun.  
---
Don't forget all the faces all over the [Enclave Oil Rig](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave_Oil_Rig)
---
I mean every time they do say something they always get told shit like how the game is dead and how to do their job better. Or when they talk about upcoming stuff people complain about it not being done yet so they just talk when the update comes out
---
most of the """"feedback"""" given on this sub is useless 
---
Nope wouldn't show on the map screen. After about 20 minutes. Then charged me 100 plus caps to "move" it
---
Lol ok.
---
A certain type of gamer (you know, "idiots") will "report" anybody they don't like.
---
On the day he reported you, he probably reported a dozen other people.
---
I'm sure Bethesda is aware that those idiots exist and send their reports right to the bit bucket.  Don't lose sleep over it.
---
He said 1 out of 50 stones maybe he was right i just might have to purchase !!
---
yeah but that's also the case whenever somebody asks for a Half-Life 3 release..
---
I just hope Bethesda has an roadmap for 76 and will release it rather soon than too late for their own sake and credibility before we reach the point of no return
---
Me and a friend tried to do a nuke run earlier today. All of the turrets were offline for us as well. We had mission indicators to make our way through. We got as far as defending the bots making the nuke before the server kicked us. Never went back for a 2nd try.
---
I have been running with it as "rediscovered lost tech", like if we finally figured out Greek Fire or the Antikythera mechanism. But your definition is way easier to agree with. Thumbs up.
---
yeah, making the good items more rare just makes the problem worse because if someone has them then they know that the other person doesn't, leaving them defenseless. The real solution is to actually nerf the fucking weapons 
---
Wow, that is really a bad system... and for what reason is that in place? Paying bountys is perfectly fine to stop griefing, but paying caps in mutual PvP... I guess it is meant as some sort of bet, like a arena battle with a buy-in for the fighters? 
---
Didn't Bethesda state, that you will not lose anything if you die, but scrap?
---
Oh well... I've deinstalled the game anyway. I'm waiting for new PvE content and don't really care for PvP anyway.
---
But reading this stuff makes me shake my head even more about lots of design decisions.
---
Any positive posts should go to the fo76FilthyCasuals sub...
---
Probably just as fun too.
---
Really  i have like 5 i buy them for cheap 
---
I'd love to see improvement of any kind. The constant back and forth with errors and such doesn't help things.
---
I'd like to see a board of "these are the hot items we're focusing on right not". A page I can go to and see what fixes they're working on and which ones are up after that. 
---
I don't even expect for them to listen to all the players here that have been posting the "in my perfect vision of fallout 76 you would change _________ to be like ________." Lots of people seem to be posting their Christmas wish list for what they want in the game. I'd just like to see an active list of bugs and glitches they're working diligently to fix. I love the game. I just want to see the glitches and stability fixed. 
---
Okay im sooooo scared now, mr. Internet tough guy. Your Daddy must be soo proud for having such a sore looser like you. 
---
Sure, i don't mind PvP... i may be a bit rusty but I'll play, give me end game content. I've been bored of this game for weeks now. 
---
Pop up on the map and ill hunt you since you're likely to have a bounty, I'll be the bounty hunter. I'll be on 10ish PST. 
---
My friends tag their names on my base. Jokes on them now, my budget is maxed! 
---
Right, the base/Expert/Master cards are all separate.  They become available based on your level, though.
---
Yes, those are suspicious. But right now I'm interested on that asset group from Fallout 4. I think later we can go back and study things in F1, F2 and F3.  =]]]]]
---
Yep yep, on to other games atm that have more rewarding grind. :/ I kinda wish i didn't feel this way towards a fallout game, but heyyyy...pobody's nerfect.... they have my money,  what can i do? Lol
---
Defend Work shop quests sometimes doesn't say what's attacking, like it will be 
---
Defeat the : wave 2/3
---
Has mostly happened when the waves are cave crickets, but I can't say forsure it's always been the blasted crickets.
---
So, I have noticed when doing the event "Bots on Parade" that some of the enemies become friendly (i.e. show up white on my VATS) and I either end up targeting one of the Assaultrons or other bots that are closest since they are Friendly too.  
---
Just leave this mess. Bethesda have to learn through pain.
---
Really curious to see where this rabbit hole ends.
---
At this point I have more faith in FC5's cult than Bethesda to even give a rat's ass about the players. Bankrupt in 5 years, more or less if this is the standard going forward. Listen to your users/clients or you will fail. 
---
I got a friend who will fill your house up with strobe lights if you don't keep an eye on him.
---
Hopefully they are saving everything for E3 that's 4 months away lol. I'm taking a break from Fallout 76 until something major happens. Got to many games I have to beat still.
---
Free to play is how
---
When I get added to a team by randoms, I go to their CAMP and build a flock of Flamingos. As many as the plastic I have on hand will allow. 
---
I have some of that, I will be on around 5pm CST shoot me a message on XBL @ Medieval Paul
---
Hi and weclome to pvp 101 for any game that has pvp and people who don‚Äôt understand the game. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to report you!‚Äù Has been a tactic of salty noobs, stupid people who don‚Äôt know how to pvp, and even ‚Äúseasoned‚Äù pvpers who just don‚Äôt understand why you are not dead in the presents of their AWESOME power!!! This is a ‚Äúphysic out‚Äù method used to make you hopefully lose your edge and thus start making mistakes!
---
To combat it you simply need to remember these simple things!
---
Ignore all pvp chat that isn‚Äôt coming from your team. Note this only applies to tactical information and so you should ignore your teammate if he or she is being a stupid noob( but that is an advanced class so we won‚Äôt cover it)
---
2: major game developers don‚Äôt give a shit about you or your pvp skills. They only care if everyone is bitching and crying about it and even then they might never look down from Mount Olympus to see the suffering below. 
---
And 3 if the enemy is threatening you over chat, you are spending way to much time chatting when you should be killing them for chatting on a battlefield! 
---
Yup 
---
HL3 CONFIRMED. HEARD IT HERE FIRST
---
This would be A.W.E.SO.M.E!!!! I have a pretty generic little camp. I want a cool camp like some of you guys have but I don't have plans for neat stuff like roll up doors, security gates, Brahman pens, or 4 poster beds. I can't afford to spend caps on those plans and I never seem to find them. 
---
I'd love to come home and see some creative decorating. 
---
&gt;Surely internal testing showed.....
---
That's your first wrong assumption... This game needed a proper 6 months in open beta testing (not the server load BS we got for a month) to hammer all these issues out.
---
It's like it went straight from concept -&gt; office testing -&gt; release.
---
"Atoms to gamble for legendaries" 
---
Nah, that would be pay to win loot boxes ...keep that shit out.
---
Honestly? I love a lot of the items they have in the store, it's the cost that dissuades me from buying anything. $10 for a single outfit, or $5 for a single skin for a single weapon type? Packs of PA skins don't even include Ultracite/Excavator armors? 'Clean' variants of things costing $5?
---
These costs are outlandish, and it's pretty clear to me how naive Bethesda is in handling these sorts of microtransactions. I barely even buy items with my free atoms because of how much things cost.
---
Well poop. Thanks for letting me know anyways! im not experienced in modding games or familiar with whatever language this was programmed in, but I do have a coding background, so I like to poke around :)
---
I figured some modder wouldve posted the loot tables by now, but I guess thats not as easy if its all determined server side. Really I just want to confirm my suspicions that RNGesus is a fraud and the deck is stacked against us. The way that so called RNG works hardly seems random at all. Its like rolling a 20 sided dice, where 18 sides are all numbered "ultracite explosive vents"
---
FYI in my experience the way to trigger one of the three is to fast travel to a location in the Ash Heap. I always get one of them to pop up when I travel to a random mine or something. Sometimes it doesn't even show up on the screen but it appears in my pip-boy.
---
Only for playing guitar
---
PS: please understand that I am not trying to argue with you personal, but am instead trying to find a solution to common problem and share it with the community so that they can enjoy the game as I do.
---
Noice! I'll take "Crappers of the Wasteland" for 1000 Alex"
---
This cold work - and tie in with a previous comment about it being MacGyver'd from a Fire Protectron..
---
\&gt; Four didn‚Äôt drop any loot
---
Make sure you wait a few seconds, often the legendary mob loot list will initially show regular junk (lead scrap, etc) then after a while will also show a legendary item.
---
ABANDON THIS GAME, its fucking not worth your effort, the developers don't give a shit, why do you?
---
Stop holding on, its done, its over, we are four months past launch, NO ONE WILL COME BACK TO THIS GAME.
---
 Yup. There's a dead one on in the Savage Divide. Jumped me on my way to The Whitespring. 
---
Bethesda... giiivee these poor souls a good, fun, rewarding game. I mean look at them... they are so confused, hungry,  in pain,  and in need of some tender, tender loving loot. If you donate just a penny a day... these gamers will probably stop coming in reddit to voice their hunger for that loot... come on.. do it.
---
What is missing at the moment is Bethesda¬¥s big picture for the game. There are so many bugs and things that could change and everyone has a different priority list. If they manage to release a comprehensive road-map people could actually understand why they are changing things and in which order. 
---
Give me a Warhawk hairstyle to buy! 
---
I was so disappointed that that was taken out!
---
I think they've come to the conclusion that Fallout 76 was largely a failure for a list of reasons, and will focus on the latest Elder Scrolls and future titles.  
---
I've moved on myself, I haven't played FO76 since November honestly.
---
It's generally pretty easy to tell which sellers have duped gear and which ones are just selling stuff they've earned. You won't be able to buy everything from one person but if you spend some time on the market subs you could find an entire set in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Internships don't last forever so they need to get all the coding out of him they can.
---
A bit of slack huh at least he put some thought into it lol
---
Come on now, if you work in the industry... the code word 'feedback' really means 'yes yes cry your heart out now we'll see if what you want is even worth the time to recode/fix/techdebt is worth even considering'.
---
Ooo! Stealing this one
---
Instakilling players all over map, great idea
---
Can't be that rare. I've had at least a couple dozen and even stopped collecting them for a while. I was saving them up for use later in the game then finally decided to just sell them to the vendor bots. Started picking them again if I have room but only to vendor them.
---
EA I understand, but why Rockstar?
---
I sent a ticket to BGS about this the first week of launch after I realized GUN FU was targetting everything friendly.  I was told to forward my ports.
---
I'm not OP, but the first time I saw it was around Senecca Rocks. The second time was last night, and managed to kill it near the water park in the NW.
---
Just plant piles of blackberry bushes in the woods around the house.  They always blend right in.
---
No roadmap, low trust, community dwindling, less than minimal communication... I have been an advocate for this game since day 1 because its fun, but man, they are making this hard...
---
So happy I decided to skip this game.
---
Sounds like a bunch of whiners that got merced.
---
That pretty much sums it up.
---
Rage?  This isn't even a sample of rage, it's disappointment.  But plenty of games for everyone, carry on, enjoy your game.  
---
U would think the white springs lobby would be that safe haven but I was attacked there yesterday during a nuke event while crafting !!! I‚Äôm making 556 ammo one second the next I‚Äôm taking massive slap damage from some asshat and I die !!! I come back all my hardened mass, nuclear waste and springs are gone from my loot !!!! Seriously !!! So now I have to wear armor under my power armor to keep from getting butt fucked from a griefer ??!!!! I wasnt engaging in pvp -I never do I‚Äôm always on passive but that means dick in this game , I wasn‚Äôt competing for loot I was looking for flux and I got set up plain and simple !!! This needs to be addressed .  I can understand the pvp danger aspect involved in the game it adds to the excitement but  there needs to be a hub where you can‚Äôt get sucker punched !!!
---
I get weapons fine enough, but theyre almost always melee weapons. I never seem to get any guns
---
How is the atom shop being populated by mass appeal items? Have they asked the vocal community on here or any other social media related to this game on things people want? No, they are putting items in to a schedule they did before the game ever came out ( as shown in the data-mines people have done)
---
I have asked countless friends that play or did play fo76 before i even thought of posting this and have seen others rant about the atom shop items on here and on bethesda's forum, they all say the same thing that the items are pointless tat not worth the free atoms to get.
---
Yes I am portraying my personal preference here but I'm also voicing an opinion that many many others have voiced themselves and at least I am trying to put items that lore wise would actually be fitting.
---
If it's *most* people then why have I NEVER seen anyone wear the vast majority of items in the atom shop? Because yeah why would anyone need a clean clown costume when you can get the item in game or the multitude of dresses and lazely  reskinned suits.
---
Best case scenario, theyre buisy
---
Yeah man. I have not spent one cent on the ATOM shop. I have everything I want from it really. The camo paint for the hunting rifle. Camo paint for combat armor, and the wooden floors for my camp. A couple of other things too. All paid for through earned atomes in game. If they want me to pay 15 bucks for somthing put a gillie suit in the shop
---
1st time my alt has seen it @lvl45. It was dead, unlootable and outside Harpers ferry. Suicide?
---
Print screen my dude.
---
or if you have an Nvidia GPU, use shadowplay to take screencaps
---
Some people really, really don't like GTA or RDR online. Personally, I ignore that and focus on the single player. 
---
What armor were you able to put the splashed on? I bought it but it's no an option anywhere
---
It has bothered me a bit that enemies still improve their stats on higher levels but past 50 there really is no increase you yourself can get
---
They are probably evaluating how much funding the team will continue to have and holding off on any communication until then. Then they need to figure out what direction the game goes with minimal support and how to communicate that without pissing everyone off more than necessary. This is what happens when you kick the game out the door and then it has poor sales and reception. 
---
This has happened to me on multiple occasions. I‚Äôm usually low on stimpaks because I used all of them on clearing the place out in the first place when everyone respawns. Then when I inevitably die and try to get back to my dropped loot it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. On top of that I‚Äôve had it where my dropped loot has just straight up disappeared. 
---
I agree that grinding can be used effectively, but this is tedium at its best. I‚Äôve gone from playing every night to haven‚Äôt played in over a week. 
---
GTA Online wasn't universally adored. Shark Cards are poison.
---
No, but I will give you a downvote.
---
Battlefront 2 is still kicking. Sadly this likely will be too for  some time. 
---
It seems that white springs is the unofficial hub. I always find people there. 
---
I mostly go there for the bar. 
---
Right, those get plenty of attention, but GTAV and RDR still have a shitton of singleplayer to make the $60 price tag worth it
---
u/ladydevann
---
OMG nocturnal sucks, why would anyone bother with that? "It's fine, I only explore at night". Ugh.
---
You won't be banned. 800 caps for a stealthboy seems very high. 
---
Next time haggle a bit more. 
---
One of the (many) barriers for communication is the avoidance of future content spoilers. Teasing future content has been classic way to generate hype. However, it's just not the star method anymore. Plenty of games now take to roadmaps and commits to reveal content while maintaining a simple tone to not give it all away. No need to promise "big things on the horizon!", just show the horizon and let the hype generate as the sun reveals itself. Get rid of the soon^(tm) and show your cards. There's still plenty of game after the flop.
---
Just the one mind! They know how *not* to indulge.
---
Maybe they don't respond because they genuinely don't know what to say or have nothing to say.  I believe they are still shell-shocked right now by the game's reaction.  I believe that they genuinely believed they had made a great game, just as they had thought Fallout 4 was their best game up to that time.  That is the gamble of trying something different: your vision of what is great is not tested and could backfire.  Same thing can happen in other fields from movies to stand-up comedy.  Older folks may remember that the great Johnny Carson once had to end a monologue early on live TV because his jokes completely bombed.  Even the best of the best make turkeys once in a while.
---
"Who has time for that? We're busy adding server variants for the least popular aspect of our game, and adding more poses."  - that one dev still supporting FO76
---
Peep hate you enjoying this game. Everything gets downvoted.
---
Please!!! Even though I know your comment was sarcasm, Please give us a dog - yes, even if it is an Atomic Shop purchase - Hell, I would even take a Protectron companion or Mr Handy.
---
Must be the game then, I do hope they improve the stability over future updates.
---
Thank you so much 
---
I loved how all (if not most) of the illustrations looked like coffee stains! That's some wasteland realism right there.
---
This whole project of yours would have made a wonderful little book, reminded me a lot of [Day by Day Armageddon, by J.L. Bourne!](https://books.google.com/books/about/Day_by_Day_Armageddon.html?id=-dY2nUMdyw8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button)
---
Perhaps they could even add a bonus aside the free to play, like one of those cheap Nuka Rum bottles or something.
---
also, please understand that I am not trying to argue with you personally. 
---
I am simply interested in finding a solution/cause to this common problem and sharing it (or at least my observations) with the community so that they may enjoy the game as I do (I find my method of legendary farming to be quite effective, although I admit I do not fully understand the problem). 
---
r/Fallout76Settlements
---
Yes, my favorite part was the Brotherhood of Seals.
---
It's not the sword that's godly, it's the build of the person picking it up.
---
Fallout 4 had the same "problem." The water hoppers would cap at a certain point.
---
1p
---
That sucks, haven't experienced that one, but lately my CAMP can not be placed a lot, even when there is nothing else in the area. 
---
Well... me too! =]
---
Quantum X-01 ftw &lt;3
---
I dunno, these seem... not great and kind of vague and difficult to execute. How about instead:
---
1. Allow players to rejoin their last server OR find other ways to mitigate the at times devastating demoralization of a disconnect in the middle of a high-stakes endgame activity.  
---
2. FIX THE USER INTERFACE. Give us better feedback on which buffs are active, actual timers and stack counts (for example, I want to know how many stacks of Adrenaline I've got active and how much time I have left BEFORE I decide whether to engage an enemy), ditch the pipboy for a more modern and user-friendly inventory management system, etc.  
---
3. Create more engaging bosses. All the game has right now are bullet sponges, which are hugely anti-fun. Give us some boss fight mechanics, some technical fights that actually require coordination, positioning, different roles, etc.  
---
4. Don't let players destroy other players' camps unless the player whose camp is getting attacked is Wanted.  
---
5. BAN ALL DUPERS.
---
Their next title will probably do just fine. Look at Anthem, it's probably gonna do well. This is after a similar situation where a b team made a title in a major series, and it flopped. People will say "oh well that was Bethesda Austin, this is the main Bethesda guys, so it'll be fine." 
---
It's all Atom's will, friendo. 
---
Two of my posts never posted or got deleted... I'm so done trying to stay faithful to this game.
---
Don't tell Lorespade lol.
---
Lots of people aren‚Äôt happy with RDR2 online mainly for pvp. All it takes is for a large posse to decide to rampage for an entire city to be cut off from other players that just wanted to sell shit. Now we have to fight back for control of the city or hike it all the way to the next one. 
---
Also there‚Äôs not much to do. You do the story mission and then it‚Äôs just repeating side quests, hunting, or killing other players.
---
I think it is save to say that the roadmap will release in the next two weeks or else they would not mention it. What matters now is the actual content of the roadmap and if they are trying to play it save by not making any specific points. I am not concert that they are not aware of the state of the game but rather that they have to limited resources to salvage the game.
---
Keep doing the Enclave quests, and you'll get a quest to launch a nuke. I solo launched at level 69. Haven't done SBQ yet.
---
I have recently started unlocking the radium rifle mods. I went 34 in a row without a mod at one point, I think I have close to half of them unlocked so far. Its only going to get worse lol. Radiums have a crazy low chance.
---
My hobo looking character sleeps in a princess bed.
---
I didn't like how microtransactions went down on GTA Online, which basically (to me) felt like there would never be another GTA game since they had that cash cow, and I feel like RDR 2 is going to go the same way. 
---
I completed on of the entire story's by the time I was level 30
---
I've had this happen several times, and I can only guess it's related to an addiction, as I have had no diseases when it happened.
---
Also sometimes have an issue where it won't let me pick a level 2 lock, even though I have 2 cards equipped.
---
Exactly, they gave us \[Known\] for learned plans &amp; recipes and an actual PTT key soooo what's the snag here?
---
#big facts
---
But then again I shouldn't need to hit a radroach 3 times with my minigun.
---
Hey where I come from those would make awesome planters. Get enough of them and could do a whole raised garden. 
---
If you have a gun that can deal with high level robot easy then go and do it alone, my first try was a fail as i died so many times i got irritated, but then i got a shotgun with high robot damage and was able to take out asultrons with 5 shots, there is allot down there and they keep coming, also get all the mutations
---
The only reason to allow the apparent infinitely leveling is because "lazy."  I mean seriously... there is no realistic reason that I am aware of for allowing us to level to 100, 200, 500, etc when there is almost no gain other than just being fucking lazy.
---
Bethesda was too lazy to properly implement builds, because some builds can't even get the proper perks until past level 50.
---
Also, by allowing/requiring us to continue to pick perks after level 50, they don't have to properly implement a system for passives, like lock pick and hacker.
---
Another sign of lazy design is that they apparently don't need to properly implement the ability to respec, because "just get 60 more levels" and you can change special and perks around.
---
I don‚Äôt know how my list was vague. 
---
But for your feedback, the main one that I agree with is #3. Bullet Sponges don‚Äôt provide a challenge, they‚Äôre just a chore. Maybe I play fallout wrong, but I tend to go in guns blazing, so the only difference with bullet sponges is the fact it now takes longer. No extra challenge, no more reward, I always spend more ammo than I gain now. An enemy half my level shouldn‚Äôt be able to take more shots than me.
---
I heard the devs were in the process of banning you but the banning tool bugged out.
---
Lost me at #1 first sentence. As far as I‚Äôm concerned you‚Äôre just another cry baby that wants to play a single player. PvP most definitely needs to be reworked but to call for it to be completely removed is a nonstarter. Good bye. 
---
1K caps for a Mod that doesnt use Flux is pretty insane. Especially when things like syrums go for 500 caps a piece. I first thought he was joking about the price, but his follow up just shows he is trying to rip people off.
---
i don't mind the stuff they have put in. But i agree, time to see some more wasteland gritty stuff. 
---
Heard that as well. Didn't work for me. Spent some time over the weekend fast traveling in and out of Camden and surrounding places with no luck. Server hopped as well. Did get Mucker to trigger, but someone had dropped a nuke on Camden (horrible btw). I server hopped to do it outside of the nuke zone and couldn't get it to trigger after that. Had the same problem on Sunday, and I finally got dross toss to trigger. I did it, made every shot, got no tokens. Just stimpacks,,purified water and 20 caps, I believe.
---
And yes, I am certain it wasn't on my pip boy. Checked each time. Spoke to each robot as well.
---
Suspiciously, I think it was the same time as the world canvass shortage... hmmmm...ü§î 
---
Yeah that's fine. Effort -&gt; reward and risk -&gt; reward.
---
Melee should deal more damage than ranged attacks, but not quite literally 10x more.
---
There should be other paths to strong damage besides bloodied+unyielding but currently there are not.
---
Here are some that I have encountered at least once, hopefully others can confirm. I did a quick search on this sub and linked relevant posts.
---
**Event: The Path to Enlightenment** - Unable to interact with the bioluminescent fluid container at the top of the lighthouse, making it impossible to deposit the fluid and complete the event.
---
* Doesn't seem to be any posts mentioning this in the sub. 
---
**Event: It's a Trap** - Unable to interact with the lure, thus it cannot be "activated" and the event cannot be completed (or even started, for that matter).
---
* ["... the button doesn't activate."](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aotoj5/its_a_trap_starting_the_event_that_is/eg3h2n8/) (3 days ago)
---
**Event: Protest March** - Protesters do not spawn at the designated meeting point, making the event impossible to complete. 
---
* [Is Protest March still broken?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7do3k/is_protest_march_still_broken/) (1 month ago)
---
* [Event: Protest March bugged?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0k74o/event_protest_march_bugged/) (2 months go)
---
&gt;There's been such a huge outflux of players
---
Where are people getting this from, is there published data of player numbers over time somewhere?
---
I only bought this game like 3 weeks ago. I heard about all the hate but i was in a gaming slump so I decided to try it. I enjoyed it at first but once you play for a bit you realize how flawed this game is mainly due to technical and lack of QOL/ vusion changes they should have made from FO4 and i'm honestly surprised more than anything that this game was released as is.
---
Im on PS4, I can check when I get home of I have the plans
---
Wish there were a lot more events going on I'll usually do 2 or three and then nothing at all, would love be to see massive hordes of enemies as well for a good friend for higher level characters
---
That‚Äôs for the insight and reading all of what I said. Because I totally don‚Äôt go into that further. 
---
Interesting work. It looks like from your numbers that the base of Perforating really does go up when it's by itself and then sharply declines when included with other AP mods. A shame, it would really almost negate armor if allowed to be consistent. 
---
Have you tried the same tests on a high ballistic PA set up with 513 ballistic resist?
---
They don‚Äôt say anything cause everything they say is taken as a blood oath, twisted, distorted and taken out of context. Over dramatic fans have made silence the best option.
---
They are not going to respond with a date and time for a bug fix for every issue. Things are rapidly changing for them and committing to something may be more damaging to them. Also they are not going to respond to every request to make the game harder, easier, buff this nerf that with a request for an in-depth interview for your perspective. Bethesda bit off more than they can chew and they are figuring it out. 
---
Chill out.
---
I found it for the 1st time last night at camp venture in the locked ammo supply Room. I'm level 139 so they took quite a while!
---
Well anti armor and explosive dont share the same affix spot...... one is a primary the other is secondary
---
 I soloed the room in a Hazmat suit at level 40. ;)
---
My prediction for Bethesda reply:
---
We're making an effort to compile all the data provided by the community and passing to the devs. I know ***\[insert condescend phrase\]*** but ***\[insert hopeful false statement\]***.
---
I just got a military cot plan from taking gorge junkyard. You can have it if you‚Äôre on xbox
---
In my opinion if someone wanted a good PvP it should be a different game; Fortnite, apex, PUBG. They just do it so much better and Fallout doesn‚Äôt really have that much to offer PvP wise. But I understand 
---
Ironically they are under the ground / in a wall...  
---
Thanks for the reminder, Adding and submitting 
---
Yes very true it most likely be small ideas to take from the community üòâ
---
I said you lost but I didn‚Äôt say I stopped reading. PvP is part of the game. Get over it. It should be more faction based but w/e that‚Äôs not how they did it. 
---
I found a beer cap with straws on a corpse and I‚Äôve been rocking that for a few days. I love the gimmicky stuff
---
You clearly didn‚Äôt read anything I wrote. 
---
My pleasure
---
Lol, no worries
---
Communication is a two way street. Right now it just feels like we're screaming into the void.
---
Welp, my Harley Quinn needs that neon sign, so goodbye atoms.
---
Cry some more about PvP I‚Äôm sure Beth is going to change it for you. 
---
Looks nice. I need to move since mine was destroyed
---
Oh well.
---
It's only two of the three pipe guns that this works for.   I forget which one it doesn't work for though
---
My emote wheel is blank and I am missing the custom poses I purchased in the atom shop. It all worked for the first 97 levels I reached them stopped around the recent patch.  I was enjoying the game despite it many bugs. I‚Äôm eagerly awaiting anthem and division. They had bugs but nothing like fallout 
---
It says canvas but you know.....that's the new word for nylon.
---
I'm thinking that this is a "No Man's Sky" sort of situation. Granted, they were a much smaller team back then, and still smaller than Bethesda. Despite what anyone thinks about the game there's a huge team of people that worked very hard on this product and it's failing. That's pretty taxing, considering how hard people are being about it. I like to think they're busy assessing what needs to be reworked in order to "save the game," pulling in feedback in large quantities and being mindful not to overstate what's possible within the game. 
---
this is why my feedback post responding to the Jan 1 inside the vault call for feedback was framed in the context of what uniquely works for the game in a surprising and deep way, the 4 identity elements it presents in the gameplay from a long heritage of classic gaming. I just don't feel heard yet.
---
I'm always down if I'm on. Gt: beakflats
---
This game has potential still I think, it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs going to take a long time to get there however. It does almost feel like they‚Äôve nearly abandoned it. My friends and I stopped playing it because of lack of content, walking around looting junk and shooting braindead AI is only fun for so long.
---
We need private servers, mods, more build space, vendors, NPCs, more end game content, a better co op player building system, and potentially a player hub. Just to name a few off the top of my head. Looking forward to see what they do with it one day assuming that day ever comes!
---
I like the beer signs..
---
Lol I was thinking same thing. 
---
Pair it up with the C&amp;K block. 
---
I really want to see this come to the game, but 9 upvotes won't get their attention 
---
Welcome to West Virginia. 
---
Oh yea no doubt the lag is the worst part. They fixed the stuttering but the time it takes me to get a single hit in vats makes me dead in seconds on this character, which is aggravating because she plays with no power armor sometimes. The fast boy feature is super nice though and mitigates a lot of the pip boy lag.
---
Well technically he‚Äôs just an intern, So they don‚Äôt give him the passwords to the social media accounts.
---
Ten rounds is barely enough to kill one Protectron with these tests. I would not use a Piercing magazine simply because I don't care if I reload faster, not having to reload 3.5 fewer times is automatically faster. 
---
I will be using Perforating from now on because the 20 shot capacity is livable and you get more damage on top of it. More damage = less bullets needed. When I'm sneak shotting, I want the most power per shot as I typically only have a second or two to burn them down. 
---
If you like a bit more capacity, Stinging is just fine and comparable to Perforating. 
---
Don't worry. Its "coming soon".... :(
---
While I am not a fan of PvP in this game, I can understand that people are more interested in natural open world PvP than an assassination game mode that sets your target.
---
Left this forum at the end of December. Wanted to see if Bethesda could improve stuff in a few months time. Coming back to the forums and seeing this post just makes me sigh. ‚ÄúAnd the groundhog returns to his hole, awaiting the day Fallout 76‚Äôs devs get their shit together‚Äù see y‚Äôall in another 3 months good luck to ya! 
---
They know they are fu*kted
---
Royally. If you were totally screwed and no way back, this is one way to be. I‚Äôve seen worse though. 
---
Well I may do a few continuation posts in the future, but nothing like the once a day thing again. I've always wanted to do a FF14 one but could never get the steam in me to do it. I did one for Wild star once that was all color, and a sketch a day for a bit for The Secret World.
---
Agreed my dude, that's the core point of this post, a dmg buff to energy weapons (or maybe ranged in general?) because they're useless but I historically love them. I tired to experiment with a  bloodied tesla with charging barrel but it wasn't much more than useless, it's taken me 225 levels and ALOT of research to try and find a work around for this issue but the best I found was melee, now im kind of obsessed with getting big damage from meager weapons, it's all an experiment. 
---
Partially why I did it, people can datamine and theorize but I'd prefer to see for myself. 
---
I really am looking forward to how this game will look after a years release.
---
I‚Äôm enjoying it despite the random difficulties. 
---
Just curious where it will all be.
---
Am I the only one concerned that they are only producing a roadmap (which is still WIP) three months after the game was released thus suggesting they never had one in the first place?
---
I do assorted things
---
Slot usage issue, thanks for the reminder, submitted.
---
40lbs? 
---
You have the right to arm bears. And to beat arms too :)
---
Agree. It is made worse that they are silent on the most contentious issues. For example, if you aren't a melee player, the game is now severely gimped thanks to the various nerfs that effect DPS and durability (since you shoot more often and take more damage then need to repair more often). Some indication of what they are thinking would be nice. At least there isn't a subscription involved so I can watch in vain to hear some news while playing other games. 
---
Agreed and they really need to have Todd Howard or Pete Hines like address this whole situation. Something above and beyond Inside the Vault. 
---
You're not supposed to play alone! You need a team like a crappy action movie. The big brute black guy, knife throwing Asian/Native American, super smart mousey nerd girl to pick locks/hack terminals, and the white guy that thinks he's in charge all while trying to bang the nerd girl that really just thinks he's funny. 
---
That looks interesting.... and I did use coffee for this, I found it can do a lot of interesting things in a painting depending on when its applied.
---
This is witchhunting. You should be banned for this. Yes, what he did was pretty desperate and pathetic but dont put his username
---
Good info, Reports vary on what happens and if you can collect more.
---
I tried hunter vs hunted twice, just to see what it was. It seems interesting, as my understanding is that it seems to be an assasination mode where you are given an ID and you have to eliminate that person. It does not seem to be free for all PVP. 
---
FWIW, they're actually pretty awesome for taking down cancer bats. You can freeze them (or slow them to an utter crawl) so instead of scream spamming you they just hover there while you pump them full of bullets.
---
I would really like to know from personal experience, when I get my hands on AA and Explosive stuff I'll test it myself. I'm willing to be a Two-Shot AA gun is the most effective in the game for anything that has armor. 
---
I have it not sure where I got it. Was a plan in the world or a event reward cuz I'd have never bought it
---
Awesome, I‚Äôll ad you next time I‚Äôm on. 
---
I was talking about **hip-fire accuracy**, which controls the size of your reticle when you‚Äôre not looking through sights. 
---
General Accuracy is PER driven and controls your VATS perception, yes. 
---
The entire story at lvl 30? Is that abnormal? 
---
Are you talking strictly about Perforating? Do you know the values for the other two as well?
---
I'm actually kinda shocked there was not a patch today! 
---
Wow - what weapons were you using? 
---
Same here, can always help you out, but want be on before about 30 min's
---
If you are not at a high level just keep clear of all the Sb's, you dont have to engage them at all, not even the main one (spoiler).
---
Just run from them, and sneak past the last one, lol
---
Then when you get at higher level's you can always go back to get you full revenge :D
---
We're screaming, but I don't think it's into a void. 
---
I liked my black fishing suit and the duster and cowboy hat. I swap between the duster and the Confederate uniform and always keep my cowboy hat on, except when in my PA gear. Too bad I can't have some cigarillos to chew on, I would never wear a helmet even in PA gear. 
---
They are not quiet at all, you fools. There are legitimately over TWO HUNDRED assholes in an office responding to negative comments and criticism. Bethesda LEGITIMATELY IS USING AN AMERICAN TROLL FARM! They are SUPER vocal! Every time you post a complaint and someone responds going ‚Äúyeah well Disney world is blah blah‚Äù or ‚Äú you got your money‚Äôs worth‚Äù it is 90% going to be one of the troll farm employees. It‚Äôs literally their script.   
---
Stop saying they are silent. They aren‚Äôt silent. They are disguised as consumers trying to counter the genuine consumer complaints. Stop being so fucking dumb, I‚Äôve been trying to tell this community what‚Äôs going on for 2 month now...
---
I have a few good weapons, but my only two shot is a .44 pistol that's like lvl 30 so not great. I'll try to get some more powerful weapons before I go into a silo. Thanks for the tips. 
---
What about weapons with the explosive legendary mod?  I have heard that anti-armor effect does not work with explosive.  Could that also apply to all armor piercing weapon mods and perks?
---
Great info, added and submitted.
---
Totally agree. The point system is kind of a mess since you mix crafting, convenience and combat abilities. Then the combat abilities are split so you have to pick one style or another based on points that you can't move around. At level 200, I shouldn't be constrained by S or P focused abilities due to the point cap. I should be able to freely go back and forth because I have enough points (or they should have kept the combat abilities all in one bin). Anyway.
---
What do you use the AA Gauntlet for? Instigating gibs almost everything on the first try. I keep an AA for thing I know I can't one shot (a very fucking short list) but I usually main Instigating Knuckles/Mole Miner's for everyday clean up. 
---
Wow. The whole second point I have is for PvP, including factions. But sure I‚Äôm crying about the PvP. You are something special. 
---
My bad B. 
---
üëç
---
Use tenderizer in CHA for more damage, even if you‚Äôre solo. 
---
Glow sights (3 in PER) and adrenaline (5 in AGI) will also significantly increase your damage output for this build.
---
I'm on ps4 and never joined but lately I have seen people using it a few times. 
---
Games like this require a road map. I don't want to chip through the salt mines in here to figure out when the best time to come back to this game is. 
---
I found it is actually just the enclave under armor that is glitchy. I think it has to do with the gloves. My BoS under armor works just fine with the silver shroud outfit. I havnt gotten my hands on the hunters longcoat yet. Also, marine tactical helmet looks good with silver shroud coat.
---
I'm looking forward to Outer Worlds, but I'm also trying to keep my expectations in check. A ton of people are hoping for NV in space but Obsidian is making sure to tell people it's not really going to be like that. They keep comparing it to KOTOR 2's structure - A handful of contained hubs to explore, and maybe 40 hours for a playthrough. 
---
One thing that actually has me a little worried is that they're saying the lower play time is okay because of the game being extremely replayable. They said this with Tyranny as well and I could never shake the feeling that it was a game that was *almost there*, and replaying wasn't really all that fun.
---
I actually was missing the Perforating just before starting the test, so I had to make about 20 (+6 from Super Duper) to unlock it. Goodbye stock I was saving up for Ultracite Lasers. 
---
I got the Suppressor too though so it was worth it. 
---
That's cool, stay in la-la land and belive Bethesda hasn't ditched this game and enjoy wasting time with something you clearly don't enjoy doing.
---
&gt;I feel my biggest frustration is that we seem to be on a 3 week patch cycle
---
Not to mention how small the patches are and usually break something else.
---
Grand total 13 t-60 MAservos 4 t-60 hydraulic bracers, 3 shishkabobs 1 excavators rusty knuckles, and 4 cooking/drug recipes...not quitting but farming/hopping is done for now.  If you still want to trade HMU between 5-9pst this evening, if not gimmi the ol thumbs down and Yab will promise to stop bugging you üòâ
---
They've already said they don't want to "spoil too much". I take that to mean that their roadmap will be very vague and limited, because they don't actually have long term plans for this failure of an online game
---
They'll allow us to buy unnerfed TSEs from the Atom Shop.
---
Definitively better. You're looking at 20 vs 35 shots, but your Perforating is likely to shave off a shot here and there because it is simply more effective. 
---
So in essence the shot disparity won't be as high because your per shot damage will be better, thus requiring less of them to begin with. I've switched over to Perforating for good. 
---
 Black Power Pistol and explosives. Among other things. ;)
---
 I just winged it. You get, to some extent, some leveling through being solo, and being repetitively low level. I had a lot of stim packs and the 20%, hit me now, save went off quite a bit. ;)
---
 I so silly things like this quite a lot.
---
Man, he's working double duty.
---
Ikr there‚Äôs literally no reason to pvp, I‚Äôm around level 150 and I decided to pvp for the first time in since I was like level 20 and I basically went bankrupt
---
"had potential"
---
ftfy, its shovelware at this point. The changes needed would make it a completely new game in its entirety. 
---
I'm just a simple servant of Atom trying to make his way in the world, spreading radiation and facts, friendo. 
---
This needs more upvotes/visibility.  We ABSOLUTELY need something that can show us how they plan to progressively fix the game or, dare I say, provide a product on par with their capabilities!
---
Those sound like wasted hours to me, oh wait..those are things you like to spend YOUR free time on, and other people have things they like to spend THEIR free time on.
---
How dare you
---
If you do I'll buy it
---
Thanks for that post that seems to mean nothing. You took some stuff other people have used to slam this game because and stuck them in a headline.
---
Idk, i did the enclave one btw
---
yeah no. If a level 60 and a level 300 are equal (and they are), there's absolutely no way this is fair. If your idea were implemented, the griefing of high level characters would get even worse (and believe it or not, it is an issue for non-pvp spec'ed players at high levels). As it is, I don't dare take a workshop because I know how that can be exploited. 
---
Your idea would make sense if -- and only if -- characters got more powerful in some way after level 60. They don't. And the only more power between levels 50 - 60 is the ability to complete builds.
---
The only actual use case for such a situation is pvp unless the queen stats I saw are wrong. All of the effects seem to be multiplicative rather than additive at the very least. I definitely could, but it didn't seem productive at the time since everyone was asking about magazines and legendary qualities.
---
And one analogy doesn't speak for the other.
---
I have the plan for the port a johns and try to hide one in every base I visit.
---
Played since beta,the game was far from a finished product and they released it anyway found a way to monetize it.months later the game is worse off than beta with no hope for a positive change in the foreseeable future,I would like, to commend the artists who worked on this game as for the devs who thought a fallout game without npcs or a story or a single player option you put money over reputation you put greed over pride in a game you could stand behind.you have been called out over and over without response.i foresee like ea bgs will fall from the graces of the loyal fan base who pays them,such a shame they were what other game companies aspired to be.
---
It is not. For the tests I used standard receivers (the Vampire is actually the first gun in the testing reverted back to standard specs) exclusively. For the bonus test I upgraded it to the receiver I typically use (Hardened) and put on all the damage perks I normally use (9/9 Rifleman + 3/3 Bloody Mess). You should see the same results from any Handmade with the same receiver and perks. 
---
The original Fallouts were arguably darker than the Bethesda Fallouts. I mean the Master is literal nightmare fuel, there are more mature gameplay elements like joining a slavers guild, etc. The ambience and music when exploring is grim and dark. They just peppered it in with some goofy shit here and there because they can. 
---
The big thing Bethesda did to the aesthetic of the series was amp the retrofuturistism up the Nth degree. 
---
How much feed back do you need? They have a Inside the vault post every week talking about what they‚Äôre doing and asking for more input. They‚Äôre doing what you ask. What do you want from them, personal texts? 
---
*groan* I'll add it to the To-Do list =p
---
1000%
---
It's probably the best Rifle perk in the game. 
---
Good god man, I don't know how you do it. But I admire it!
---
This is the second time I‚Äôve heard a comment along these lines mentioned. Is this a just a community joke or is there some truth to it?
---
Thanks for reading, friendo. Atom's glow guide you. 
---
Is outer worlds the coop rpg?
---
I‚Äôve noticed the mass amount of negativity from this post and honestly it‚Äôs amusing 
---
Don't feel, test it out thoroughly and come back to us with the results =)
---
I think that the " Big Stuff Soon^tm" in this case is to hide the fact that they have no funding and aren't planning shit, but they can't say that or their playerbase will die even more.
---
So they'll string players along as much as they can with this "Soon" buisiness so they can sell a bit more Atoms before the game is fully dead and shut down
---
Thank god the coolest outfits is obtainable in game
---
**Regarding Demolition Expert:**
---
The "Balance" (no offense to those involved) was clumsily handled, the 40% Reduction in max benefit from having the perk crippled the Demo Builds, and made the Linked weapons actually worthless.    
---
Bad balance issues are generally classified as Bugs in any common definition when handling these things, be a mod or a core game.
---
I do agree, the Missile Launcher, AutoGrenade Launcher and Fatman need buffs beyond that point however.  
---
**Regarding Rifles:**  
---
I agree, the Weights of all ranged weapons needs to be fixed, Long Barrels weigh less than Short in almost every instance, the base weights are significantly higher than their real world example, and the upgrades should add a fixed number vs random Multiply+Add.   
---
As for no weight reduction perk, why would every weapon class BUT Rifles get one?
---
Weak compared to what and in what circumstances?
---
I‚Äôve got my 50 cal just as decked out, and I find it on-par with the Gatling Laser. 
---
Right? Like that whole we are going to be transparent with you in the future bullshit
---
When I heard they were fixing the infinite carry weight glitch, I went back to my base and saved.  I haven't loaded the game back up since then because I have like 2k weight on my character and my box is full and I don't know what to do with everything... so I'm waiting for at least a small storage increase before scrapping everything. 
---
I used to set that when I load in and hope someone else joins, but the most I've ever seen is 2/4, only once. I remember before the game launched and I said I wanted PvP everyone told me they had a hunter mode type thing and I can just do that. As you already know, that didn't work out.
---
looooool
---
I know fuck all about *actual* guns, but I know Fallout guns. If your Handmade is semi-auto, you'll be able to see a drastic increase in damage when you put the Rifleman perks on. 
---
I am also looking for a friend :3
---
They most likely always had a roadmap/plan at least for the planned dlc¬¥s. They also need some time figure out how to deal with the current state of the game if they want to do bigger changes.

The Silver Shroud trench coat finished off my [look](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/comments/al3bfg/shame_the_scarf_clips_through_the_hood/?st=JS26QNJX&amp;sh=318b25ba) nicely
---
Let me know, and curious if that is the case.
---
That was an explosive comment, but I think this thread has really been mined out...
---
Hmm okay thanks, all of my required items show in the list that I have what is required and I am lvl 5 weaponsmith as well. This is strange...
---
I've honestly never seen one but I'd really like an AA Handmade. I was fucking overjoyed to see that some idiot had sold a AA Assault Rifle to a Watoga vendor. 
---
Okay thank you, Im not sure why I am seeing this I have all of the required materials in the list showing as well....
---
The low and med levels and story are good and loads of fun but the high level and "END GAME" is so far a lost cause
---
I think the  Grognak‚Äôs Axe might be a different issue, it's missing the "Weapon" Keyword that is also preventing it from being repaired to 200%.  
---
Will log and report.  
---
The trick is to take over workshops and defend them at least once.  You get plans for rewards.  
---
I‚Äôve been taking over two at a time recently to farm aluminum (somehow ended up with a huge shortage), concrete (used it all up rebuilding my camp), junk, etc.  and got a bunch of plans.
---
The drawback is server disconnects.   But I‚Äôve found that they happen less often on the PS4. 
---
I fought my way all the way down there and my chest felt heavy from my jaw resting on it. Multiple attempts at sneaking by where foiled by our winged friends. LoL. 
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
I got the AA Assault from a Watoga vendor. Can't believe someone sold it. 
---
I'd like TSE and TS AA weapons to see which is actually the best in the game. 
---
&gt; *Right? Like that whole we are going to be transparent with you in the future bullshit* 
---
*\[Still in character\]* Thank you for your reply, I'll be passing it to the devsI
---
Thank you auto mod
---
I have lost 45% of everything I invested in this year because I'm an idiot.
---
Flying molerats sounds like nightmare fuel but at the same time I‚Äôd be all for it 
---
Ah yes I just forgot to put that in, I do run Tenderizer. 
---
You want a Troubleshooter's weapon for the Silos
---
This is a very good point... Perhaps the show pieces themselves can be locked, like we can lock our resource items at public camps? That way, if they are stolen, the player is at least wanted. Might be a high enough deterrence if the reward is high enough, though it will still be a problem.
---
&gt; I can't wait to tear things apart commando style!
---
Arnold himself would be proud. 
---
Thanks, trying to make it better for us all...
---
I wouldn't mind a change of gameplay, as long as its well done. An idea of mine which I proposed some friends was well received - let them make a Battlefield: Fallout with Battlefield gameplay and Fallout Artwork in the Frostbite engine. With completely destroyable environment of course. But as a spin-off ofc.
---
Personally, I never played Fallout for its gameplay. FO3 is one of the worst shooters (when it comes to gunplay) of all time. I also don't mind that they tried to create a spin-off as an MMO. 
---
They could appeal to the younger generation with awesome gun-based massive action gameplay and to the elder with RPG elements, skill-tress, quests with multiple outcomes, dialogue options, etc. 
---
Sadly, the game fails at both currently.
---
Thanks for reading, friendo. Instead, donate to Atom's cause and irradiate some heathens for me on PC.
---
Press X to doubt.
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
Nope carnivore doesn‚Äôt help with spoiled meat. Only raw meat. Salisbury steak does not seem to have the bonus either.
---
yup pretty upset at pre-ordering and seeing instant price drops. That's like saying "sucker". The thing is when you screw over people, they tend to remember. Never gonna pre-order again
---
Needs to be fresh, can be raw but not spoiled
---
You're welcome friendo, may Atom's warm glow guide you. 
---
yeah, it's 40 lbs after all the upgrades. I'd use Bear Arms but I don't have room for it.
---
Ionized meat and glowing meat work with it too.
---
After last patch it will anounce to everyone on server, that someone joined H/H. I had some of them but yeah people were like it was accidentaly. And funniest was in middle of scorchbeast queen fight.
---
https://youtu.be/eN0hbQALkag  they didnt even know they are being hunter probably, whatever i had my food.
---
Hehe thank you ;)
---
BIG SPOILER ALERT !
---
Just sneak and keep as close to the left wall as you can, it shouldn't see you before you are about 10-20 feet from you final transponder an the corps, then, just run, hit the transponder and grab what you need from the corps and head for the exit straight ahead.
---
No for the fun part, if you want to :)
---
When you are at the exit point, look back, you will see your friend glaring at you and it will be on the ground, it cant get in to that passage, so if you want a quick revenge you can go a bit back towards it and empty every clip of ammo you have into it, lol
---
Sheeeeeeit, I don't see why not. Maybe the auto ones fire too fast? I had an AA + Troubleshooting 10mm that chewed robots the fuck up when sneak shot (and a lot of other things too tbh). The burst damage potential might be too much balance wise. 
---
I had some in my junk ages ago and assumed it was for a recipe. I think i sold them to a venor
---
Oh I don't know, I kinda liked giving you a downvote for suggesting we give money to people who've violated the terms of service.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
oh, you've seen one?  I been kill 3star legendaries at Whitespring and wherever else I can find them and all I ever get is 1star crap like wood armor.
---
Drugs are bad. Put them down.
---
well, they didn't mean THAT kind of communication...
---
&gt;I dont know dude, they respond alot in reddit
---
Canned "I'll pass this on to the dev team" responses from their community managers are a sad excuse for "communication."
---
&gt; Also, marine tactical helmet looks good with silver shroud coat.
---
That's what I've been doing, too.  It's a hell of a look.
---
Yeah, you're right. I was thinking of the functional equivalent of Diablo 3's Blood Shards but you can't pay real money for those. You can only earn them through gameplay, similar to how the in-game earned atoms work. The ability to pay for atoms would turn this into another Diablo 3 auction house situation and that was WHACK. 
---
In fact, that would explain Bethesda's shitty loot pool. When D3's auction house was active, the legendary loot pool was abysmal to encourage the use of the auction house. I bet you a dollar that if Bethesda hadn't gotten so much bad press, we'd be spending real monies for legendaries and have an even worse loot pool than we already have today
---
Yes. Do you run in a team ? I run alone but notice drops are better in a group 
---
9/10 Perks were directly imported from Fallout 4, and Demolition line on it's own is not "OP" at 100%.  
---
It becomes OP when combined with the Legendary Explosive Effect, especially with "Shotgun" type weapons.  
---
If the end goal was a more perfect balance I think we would have seen a significant buff to Missile Launchers and Fatmen at the least, which didn't occur.
---
While Ubisoft has its share of issues, man they do a good job hyping their games roadmaps.

Every week, I get excited to read the "Inside The Vaults", but honestly, they're full of so much fluff, I feel like I could write them. 
---
* Paragraph about us listening (keep writing in **Bethesda** forums!)
---
* Paragraph about three mysterious vaults opening
---
* Paragraph teasing upcoming changes to PVP (no more information than that)
---
* Paragraph saying all new content and balances, and we are listening (repeated)
---
Boom! You've got yourself an inside the vault! 
---
Here's what I'd love to see on "Inside The Vaults":
---
* Concept Art
---
* Gifs/screens of new areas
---
* More description of upcoming mechanics
---
* Larger, year long road maps that discuss (even in the loosest terms) what kind of additional content we should expect
---
I get it. The PR is so bad they're staying tight lipped. Basically, anything they've been saying has been perceived as negative up to this point. 
---
But player excitement and interest needs to take priority. I played regularly with five friends for weeks. In early January? It all fell apart. 
---
Let's get some news that gets us pumped to get playing again! 
---
I don‚Äôt have it, but I saw it on somebody with combat armor. 
---
Legit give up on this shit and so should everyone else.
---
I worried about that too. But my thirst seems slower than Pre speed demon' put i do have class freak lvl 3
---
Bethesda: "We've noticed that armor piercing magazines were over performing in their slot so their values have been reduced by 80% to be more in line with the others."
---
Were the launch site robots similar level to you? Just curious.
---
&gt; In fo4 and fo76 before the most recent patch, the whole "enemies lose sight of you when you run away" mechanic was handled by temporarily adding a "chameleon" effect to the player when you first enter stealth.
---
&gt; The effect lasts maybe half a second, and this breaks enemy awareness, placing you back into "hidden" so long as enemies are not in very close proximity.
---
&gt; You can tell this is what happens by calling up your pip boy immediately after entering stealth: If you do this fast enough you will notice the "chameleon" effect prevents you from seeing the pip boy correctly (in fo76 you need to use the pip boy mode where it shows the animation of the player raising their arm to their face, not the one where it pulls up the ui without the arm animation).
---
&gt; After the latest patch this no longer happens, ever.
---
&gt; Thus I believe the latest patch removed the temporary chameleon effect from escape artist which is why enemies don't lose awareness when you run off and then re-enter stealth.
---
Great Info, I'll add the note and submit a modification of the ticket.
---
The game even has a roadmap, even if its not super detailed, people know whats coming all of 2019
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm logging on now to give that a try. 
---
Not that I can remember, sorry. Haven't played the game in quite a while so I don't remember much.
---
&gt; dmg buff to energy weapons (or maybe ranged in general?) 
---
Double agreed. Specifically:
---
Energy weapons currently consider only their base damage in the damage formula, which makes damage resistance and the mysterious decision to make certain armors give even more energy resistance double damning.
---
There is no damage scaling from SPECIAL for any ranged attack, which automatically gives melee a 75% damage head-start (15 STR x 5%) and makes unyielding or even just +1 SPECIAL legendary affixes pointless for ranged use.
---
A bunch of melee increasing consumables stack with each-other for... reasons.
---
The totals will show correctly on the screen, but if the items are split between Stash and Inventory it won't allow you to do it.  Repair or Craft.
---
Just a bug.  Hopefully it gets fixed in the next update.
---
I've got a buddy that's my usual crash test dummy for these kinds of things and he has a hard on for PA so I'll eventually shoot him a bunch myself. Typically I'm using a Handmade on other players so if the AA Assault is better on PA universally or just the high armor PAs I'm keen to find out. 
---
The last bastion of hope for me is dwindling. I've been trading weapons armor and junk while waiting for new content. I do queen runs most days but it gets monotonous at times. I'm actually leveling an alt character which I didn't think I'd ever do (sorry for new players leveling used to be much easier), just because what else can I do? So I have my trading and leveling/gearing my next character for a while...though I've noticed the last month or two trades have slowed down a lot. Much less posting over all the trade mediums. Please just tell us what to look forward too. Bethesda is starting to be the parent that promises stuff and doesnt come through. Eventually the kids give up.
---
I remarked that it was interesting to me that the bot that posted Bethesda's replies only ever shows up in threads where it is a patch explanation or something positive about the game. 
---
Got downvoted.
---
Its evident to me that the fans wont let it happen, at least not here on reddit.  They might be able to get away with an announcement on the Bethesda website, but there is no way they can have an actual discussion.  Too much time and too much silence has passed.
---
you, me, pretty much everyone has been shouting that since it was known it would not be supported (at start,.. they say...)
---
but yeah.. somethin' tells me thats a no-go for them.. they would lose control of the piggybank
---
That's a u/idamnedit move
---
Good question, get me some high quality legendaries and I'll get you some answers. =p
---
I can't believe you've done this
---
It‚Äôs more of the last part than the first and the lack of passive mode. I can go out hunting for an hour and some asshole posse comes up and attacks me. It still has a nice player base. Possibly larger than FO76
---
&gt;I think they've come to the conclusion that Fallout 76 was largely a failure for a list of reasons, and will focus on the latest Elder Scrolls and future titles.
---
I would honestly be OK with that, but they still need to come out and say *something*. Give me the following things and I could continue having fun leveling up alts and playing with my friends:
---
* private, stable p2p servers so I don't have to rely on the Pentium 486 servers they're apparently using
---
* infinite stash space
---
* a much larger CAMP budget
---
* mod support for all platforms like FO4
---
Give the modders a couple weeks and they would have 90% of the bugs squashed, loot tables fixed, etc. Within a couple months they could easily have NPC's implemented, and before long you'd probably see new quest lines.
---
I uninstalled in January but I still hang around here to see the news because I really want to come back. Honestly the only thing that could bring me back is they drop one HUGE patch with tons of changes, fixes, and new stuff. They won't though. 
---
Pleasant valley cabins. That row with the crafting benches has plan spawns for armor and mods
---
I doubt they have one that they have any comfort in releasing for general consumption. 
---
I imagine that if this sold about as well as I guess (poorly) the staff has already been thinned, or moved to other projects. You're stuck with a skeleton crew doing non-stop production support on what I imagine is a 2 week cycle/1 week test. Or something similar. 
---
Missed roadmap items would only lead to more customer frustration, the perception of missed commitments is already through the roof on this game and rightfully so. At this point, I don't see much avenue for recovery on this game given the state it was released in. I'm sure they have a plan, but until they get past a cycle of constant production support. Which I'm not convinced will happen anytime soon. 
---
I have run across the same dead deathclaw.  I wonder if he sold his supply of dog helmets (which is my favorite queen drop of all time)
---
Hail Aten\_Ra, full of grace. Pray for us now in the hour of our bugs, Amen.
---
Seriously, though, I was wondering why I was getting Glowing Pusstuals(sp) so often!
---
Ionized meat are my new stimpacks.
---
Has Todd ever even publicly acknowledged the game after launch?
---
They aren't even going to apologize.
---
Pretty fucked up.
---
100% agree w/ you honestly.
---
because they have to keep many little things for the next months so they can make it look like they're actually working on the game
---
Optimized doesn‚Äôt even work. Seriously. Open your pip boy to your stats page, where you can see numeric AP. close it. Start a power attack and reopen your pip boy. Check the value change. Remove (or add, depending) your optimized bracers. Repeat. 
---
Same amount of AP used.
---
I'm pretty sure that the "always in Caution" bug going around currently is because of the near infinite detection range of Molerats.  It's really that molerat over by Watoga that senses you around when you walk thru the Mothman Museum.
---
Just imagine if they had wings...
---
All I want is more X-01 skins. Been hoarding my atoms for some good ones to come out 
---
That it did.
---
I'm usually in a Drifter outfit with either a cowboy hat and patrolman sunglasses or the assault gas mask. 
---
I was the one who shot the queen a few times, and I shit you not, I did almost nothing, and just watched the Queen's health tick down.  Took less than 10 minutes for him to kill her.
---
You'd think they would have reached out to the Zenimax Online division to see what they did to make ESO successful, but nooooooo....
---
Yeah right, if I worked there I wouldn't try and communicate with this toxic viper pit either.  
---
Oof.  If Bethesda wishes to restore my confidence in this game, they must do two things:  1) revert Feed the People back to when it actually fed all the people and made everyone feel good while playing for once, and 2) fix the Nuka Girl outfit.  My demands are non-negotiable, unlike my pants.
---
You're fine. I run around with 10 on me and keep 5 in the stash at all times. I either sell or just don't pick them up if I'm at my pre determined max.
---
I have found the tri-barrel mod for the mini gun a few times, but I don't remember where. I can also craft it. Just scrap a lot of mini guns and you'll eventually learn it. That is how I learn most of my weapon mods.
---
Stealthboy mark 3‚Äôs can be bought from enclave vendors for...I‚Äôm not sure how much but far less than 800 caps. Only thing you are guilty of is being a sucker ;)
---
Firstly warframe is f2p so it's a little lower on rage scale. For example I downloaded it and did not like it at all but I wasnt angry because I didn't pay for it so I wasnt at a loss. Back to fo76 where people paid $60 or more for a broken game, anger is pretty much the top reaction. Now if the average console player finds out that PC got a patch while they are stuck with glitches and crashes that would piss off alot of people (obviously not everyone like you or me). Plus you need to take into consideration that most of the 76 players are already grumpy, so it doesnt take much to set off the community. Now I agree bgs doesnt care alot about bad press but even they are walking on eggshells right now, a good example is the promised roadmap. I bet they are hesitant about releasing it due to the backlash of disapproval for the plans for 76.
---
I think that if a player's cap balance goes negative due to PvP, they should receive an "Over-Encumbered With Debt" debuff until that debt is paid.  Mirror being over-encumbered with weight, but also add a damage debuff.
---
Here is a post I made yesterday on the subject:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apnubn
---
Apparently they don't even have any producers, which is like the first big picture position you would want to fill.
---
The producer is the only one who could give us a roadmap, since that is essentially exactly what the job entails.
---
Can't give us what they don't have.
---
Maybe. I sunk a lot of time into 76 and came across a ton of caps, never did find a tri-barrel minigun mod. Caps are a lot easier to get ahold of that's for sure.
---
They don‚Äôt give a shit. Otherwise this game wouldn‚Äôt have been released back when it was.
---
Well this community is like an abusive girlfriend. I wouldn't say much either.
---
I was thinking that you would be able to use a caravan someone in the sever make in your faction and be able to fast travel along. But you are right I was thinking about it but forgot to put it in
---
Talking =\= Doing
---
I can't tell you how jealous I get from the Anthem subreddit. EA has shit policies but they sure can hype a game.
---
Outside of legendaries, do you actually see anyone doing that?
---
If so, I bet it‚Äôs for aesthetic reasons. This game is easy enough you reaaallly don‚Äôt need to minmax to still be good in a fight.
---
I would prefer a relaunch ala FFXIV.
---
Asked Bethesda and they answered
---
Greetings!
---
Thank you for contacting Bethesda Customer Support.  My name is Rebecca and I'd be happy to help you today!
---
Thank you for reaching out to us about this matter at hand.
---
The Zealot Legendary Armor Effect reduces the damage taken from the Scorched by -15% .
---
The Scorched are a type of ghoul that contracted the Scorched Plague.
---
The Scorched are a different enemy than the Scorchedbeast and the Scorchedbeast Queen.
---
This means that the Zealot Legendary Armor Effect will not have an effect against Scorchedbeast and the Scorchedbeast Queen.
---
I hope this helps to clear up some confusion. If not, feel free to message us back through this ticket and our team will gladly assist you further!
---
Warm Regards,
---
Rebecca
---
Bethesda Customer Support
---
i agree.  i think they are starting to see a loss on the game, overall. 
---
The profits they made from the initial sales are now starting to hit with the amount of time they spent fixing the game (programmers cost$).   And I am sure the store isn't doing so hot right now. 
---
of course they will use this as an example of how the entire fallout franchise isn't as profitable and then not make fallout 5. 
---
I'm told the Perforating bonus by itself is 40% when no other armor mods are in play, yet Perforating alone did not do better than Tank Killer alone. 
---
So either game files/data mining is inaccurate or there's something else in play that isn't being accounted for. I don't know, but I don't have to because I've seen for myself. 
---
Not just anthem, also apex legends, its by a studio owned by EA and theyve had a roadmap and future season content confirmed, the games been out just a few days 
---
That makes no sense, especially since you already have a copy, you should have a choice to rank it up. Running mods? Try removing (or updating) them.
---
I don't think they are any stars.  Pretty sure you get Enclave Commendation for 1-3 Star legendary enemies.  If you kill a Legendary with no stars, it doesn't give you any commendation.  Like the regular legendary watoga robots.
---
I've killed it twice (or killed two of them?  I don't know monsters).  The best item it dropped was 4 caps, I wish I were kidding.
---
well balanced?? hahaha i wish. it's somewhat balanced, but now every weapon is just shit unless you get really lucky ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
That's odd, maybe they used the armor formula for that gun?  Did you get a mod everytime the first 20 or so or was it rare to learn them even from the start? 
---
A roadmap would come from the game's producers.
---
They don't have any producers on staff right now.
---
Can't give you what doesn't exist.
---
What if its just the asset they use when they want a giant face or art deco design? No offense meant as you've obviously put.... a lot of work into this theory but Occam's razor right?
---
I'm planning to go for that big mag tonight üòâ I think I have a decent amount of screws right now.
---
I feel like the kid next door to the new kid in town with all his new toys. 
---
I found a bloody level 50 bolt action pipe pistol. Modded to a rifle, it definitely is affected by both perks (verified yesterday).
---
It‚Äôs my new love, even if I can‚Äôt mod it with armor piercing magazines, until I find a bloody hunting rifle, it is vicious.
---
[valve time](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time)
---
The pipe one does not.
---
What it needs is a perk card profile system where you can save a particular set of cards under a name and the select and instantly apply it.  That would make swapping less of a chore and the cards more manageable.  
---
How many of us should up at a nuke event, temporarily join a team and forget to apply a team perk simply because you‚Äôre too busy?  If you had a preset card profile for that then it would be quick and easy. 
---
They mention working with an artist on it.
---
Not a producer, which tells me it's going to be a nice looking jpeg that tells us nothing.
---
BGSA is hiring 3 producers right now. No one has the reigns:
---
It is necessary because 40% would make a stand alone AP mag better than Tank Killer straight up. My testing showed that it is actually worse than Tank Killer straight up. 
---
So despite what is documented a simple test showed it to be inaccurate. Not a lot, but inaccurate. 
---
Yeah, all sugar bombs in the game should be the radiation version that can be used in the recipe...  the "clean" variety aren't really necessary.  It's nice having clean varieties of some other food items, but it is just annoying when it is a component of another product. 
---
Yes, but they DO give a legendary item. I seem to pretty much get 100% (totally anecdotal, have not measured or counted) a 1* item, but has anyone seen 2* or 3* dropping from these enemies?
---
Useful info on the Enclave commendations for sure, but I'm more asking a loot question :)
---
Just checked again and I got a rank 1 card while already having the perk rank 2 and only the rank 1 version showed up until I equipped it, makes sense I can‚Äôt choose the card again oops
---
I‚Äôve got 8 t-60 calibrated shock mods I found in the game world/bought off vendors... I should sell them, huh?
---
What system are you on?
---
 The random trouble you get into by walking everywhere is just pure gold. Makes the game so much more real.
---
Why don't people understand d if there was a road map we'd see it. If they had any idea of what they're planning for the future past a month they'd share it. They understand just as well as we do how bad their communication is right now. The fact that they're still not communicating means there's nothing good to communicate.
---
 Like seriously I don't understand where this obsession with having unfounded faith in companies comes from 
---
Everyone quit. Need to change employment before they have too big a gap to fill on their resume, cause FO76 definitely won't be going on it.
---
I posted about this yesterday:
---
Don't bother. Bethesda doesn't bother either.  
---
The fact that they're silent is a good indication that there's little positive to talk about.
---
Happened to me in my one and only queen fight so far lol.
---
Sounds like you should.  LOL
---
Agreed:
---
But it should also have "passive" perk cards that are always activated like the crafting ones and the hacking ones.
---
Like it makes sense that you have to chose between perk cards that support or make you tanky, and ones that increase your DPS. But it makes no sense that you suddenly forget how to lockpick.
---
I like the perk card system over the FO4 system, but it wasn't implemented all that well when it comes to things like this.
---
Calm down satan. I wonder if this is considered griefing a base.
---
The problem people have with no NPCs is actually no conversation. Would it really feel that incredible to have unnamed settlers wandering around saying the same dialogue or even if it was a NPC like Modus, Grahm or Rose then not being able to really interact with them? What people actually miss is the conversational input. They just think they want NPCs
---
Who exactly do you think cares?
---
This game deserves to be slammed. It‚Äôs a copy and paste of fallout 4 with only a handful of new mechanics and STILL a complete and utter failure 
---
I've got a similar buddy, only he seems to really enjoy shooting me lol. All PA is higher armor than what I was wearing I think. At least ballistic resistance. Armor piercing is only going to be more important the more armor your target has. Good luck with your testing though. Shooting players is the best method though, because you have a hit point number instead of shots to kill, and trying to find the same enemy at the same level etc.
---
"I wish Bethesda gave a fuck like EA." PPPPpffffffffffffttttttttt BWAHAHAHAHA
---
I mean, the 0* Legendary Creatures do drop 1* Legendary items.  I may have even received (poor quality) 2* Legendaries from Watoga 0* Legendary robots.  (Can't be certain, I wasn't tracking them, and just noticed a crappy golf club or baton that I just turned around and sold).
---
So... I guess I don't know what you are asking.  You asked if the Legendaries with no stars were 1, 2, or 3*.  I don't think they are any star... just 0* Legendaries.  It's not that they are just not showing their stars, it's just that they are the lowest form of Legendary, so low they don't even count for the Enclave quest.
---
Haha agreed. Molerats definitely seem to be the cause (and as someone with a sneak build, they now infuriate me even more).
---
Even though you described it flying towards you, I‚Äôm imagining them burrowing as normal, but then bursting through the surface only to fly around you after you‚Äôve already shit yourself
---
What an intuitive mechanic!
---
Like i said I have an instigating puncturing power fist and thats usually my go to
---
however to extend shelf life, i switch out my unarmeds. I carry 3* zealots knuckles, a 3 star troubleshooters boxing glove, my AA and Instigating. Depending on who im fighting. I keep makeshift 5 star on as well and always repair with weapon artisan 3.
---
Bethesda Games Austin is hiring 3 producers and a multitude of other critical positions that should already need to be in place before a game even begins development.
---
This hints that the majority of staff left post launch.
---
They still add seasonal Atom Shop items, which is nice I guess, but we need content!
---
I've never died in a nuke zone once because I ground out rad sponge + ghoulish and lvl 25 power armor first. This game is actually ridiculously easy, it's just made difficult by grind and damage sponging enemies.
---
Which boils down to sloppy/lazy design. I've never died fighting SBQ, but I've failed to kill her because of time limitation so many times. I just gave up playing this game at that point. The end game is profoundly un-fun, but I actually enjoyed getting there. But after 5-6 runs of nuked white springs, clubbing glowing ones with a hammer gets pretty boring.
---
EA even had an AMA.
---
On XBox. 
---
1. When loading into the game or fast travelling if you look at your pip boy too soon then quite likely you will get frozen looking at your pip boy or the game will crash. If you get frozen you can get unfrozen if enemies kill you.
---
2. There have been many posts about infinite loot load or no loot from high level and legendaries.
---
3. bodies/meat piles can despawn too quickly, preventing you from looting.
---
4. Rad sponge doesn't always work since last update.
---
5. Powering up Poseidon doesn't always give a power plan. there can be very lame rewards
---
6. Fertile soil event. After removing humans from being targeted and completing the event, the Mr Handys are still attacking.
---
7. Graham can have 0 or 2 caps on him even if you don't trade with him for several days.
---
8. Antibiotics are supposed to prevent new disease after it cures one. It doesn't always work. I have gotten one right after.
---
9. Bulk items now auto scrap if you hit scrap all junk, since last update, it's very frustrating when you just bulked them up to sell.
---
10. Watoga station vendor can have 0 caps even if you haven't traded with it for a day. Can sometimes be fixed by repeatedly trying to trade.
---
11. Event rewards don't always come after completing the event. sometimes it is much later.
---
12. Actual cap rewards can be much lower than bounties on players. sometimes as low as 2 caps on players with a 300 cap bounty.
---
13. This is probably intentional. Weapons seems to be breaking a lot faster and fusion cores are being used up a lot faster since last update. QOL issue. quite annoying
---
Take stock of yourself.
---
It‚Äôs a video game. 
---
You‚Äôve lost perspective and need to get s grip on yourself. 
---
Not that simple, there are more than **five thousand leveled lists**, with multiple items in each, would be a fairly major undertaking to export and post all of that data.
---
The plans are given as progress during the quest. Your boyfriend managed to skip that progress part and complete the quest.
---
Since you can‚Äôt restart the quest, you get get back to that progress point.
---
No, there isn‚Äôt another way, at least not currently. 
---
Sorry. 
---
It took me literally 3 weeks to complete this quest. Half the time, the server would crash between getting to the relay towers, and the other half of the time, would crash when I used fast travel to get to the last two relays. Then it would crash near the glassed cavern entrance, resetting all my progress. At one point, it seemed like the difficulty of the enemy mobs in the glassed cavern was tripled, which made me exit the dungeon before finding Taggerdy. 
---
I only finally completed the quest sometime last week, at level 65. 
---
I play solo, which seems to be harder than I had anticipated when I began. 
---
Now, I'm stuck with the Modus commendation quest not updating when I kill starred creatures... :(
---
The request for feedback was stalling/diversion.  Bethesda has moved on and hopes you will too. 
---
Went crazy, updated bios, reinstall video drivers, turned off Vsync,  reduced resolution to  1600x900 
---
And with everything on Low and some config tweaking I can now play the game. My fans are roaring more than they were before and it freezes much less. Usually when taking fire or attacking.
---
I've run what seems like heavier games, I'm going to say it's a mix of my hardware and game optimization, at least I can sorta play üôÇ
---
I never paid attention, but once someone mentioned it, yes it made perfect sense!
---
Pretty sure it's insanity, or OCD...  
---
Maybe both? ;)
---
Some bad info on this thread.
---
The level range on dropped items from legendaries is +/-15.
---
This is why Uranium Fever (with its level 40 Mole Miners) is such a consistent source of level 50 loot. Don't believe me? Try it.
---
If you REALLY don't believe me, here's my tradelist, 90% from this one event:
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xXxufYNIb1Z97btPYF0YOzlfh4TKPKN-tv1egQB_Ys4/edit?usp=sharing
---
(This is not a trade list plug!)
---
Interesting set up! I'm a bit weapon heavy as is (also a sniper/rifleman, hence the post) so I'm struggling to keep my weapon weight down as is. 
---
lol
---
That‚Äôs not totally accurate (that‚Äôs not exactly how the quest programming works) but ultimately, the final answer is correct. 
---
The biggest issue to me is not that they're not talking to us, it's that they're not talking to us regularly. It doesn't need to be every day but it needs to be consistently and comprehensively. 
---
Less talking through the mouth piece of the cold, overly filtered PR apparatus like Inside the Vault and less of the powerless platitudes of the very well meaning community managers. The communication should come from real people - the game lead, senior dev, head QA person (if they exist). Some identifiable with authority behind their words we can relate to.
---
I can't think of a popular online game that doesn't have their devs communicating directly with the community, particularly on hot topic issue. This one way communication needs to become a two way street. Right now, I feel very reluctant to give any feedback because it feels like I'm wasting my precious time for my comments to fall on deaf ears.
---
You may be listened but we don't know it.
---
Sorry you‚Äôre getting downvoted.  I‚Äôd be shocked to learn this game has 200 % FTE assigned (full time engineer)
---
I'm level 89.  I have a level 45 Legendary Handmade (I don't remember the effect right now. It isn't exploding. It's something else.)  with some decent mods on it.  When 100 critical shots takes off less than 1/10th of the health of a level 80 regular scorch beast, the game balance is broken.  When you add the fact that I have 3 10% boosts to my rifle damage for an extra 30% of oomph, that is ridiculous.     (Yes, if you read between the lines I was using multiple crits and still not able to do 10% of damage to this scorch beast even after killing 2 other scorch beasts that just spawned in that same area...the whole thing is broken.  Too many scorch beasts spawn (it used to be just 2 of them at that fissure site) and they are increasingly too powerful at the top end.
---
Even my two shot legendary black powder rifle barely did any damage on the scorch beast.  Scorch beasts should be tougher than the 20 to 40 scorched that spawn... The scorched I can usually kill in a couple/few shots to the head or 1 or 2 criticals with the handmade rifle.   It shouldn't take 100 bullets with criticals to do less than 10% damage.  What a waste of time and they never drop anything good.  What is the point of having them if all you do is ignore them because they aren't worth your time?   I killed the first two because I wanted to pickup the ultracite ad soak in the radiation.
---
What does this even mean, because it‚Äôs a game I‚Äôm not allowed to have an opinion on it? You make no sense lmao 
---
Sure they are canned, they would not have time to type out personalized heartfelt responses. Hell I would actually complain about that waste of time. Fix this game already!
---
Do you have a list of gameplay bugs coming soon? 
---
I‚Äôve seen mod plans for t-45 there, never excavator.
---
Just transfer all your caps to another account.
---
I‚Äôd really like if they posted the numbers of how many people have done the different missions and we could really tell them why the popular ones are popular and how the others are broken. 
---
Well whichever it turns out to be in the long run, we wub you &lt;3 :)
---
No, you answered it in your post. ‚ÄúTo get plans and register the armor...‚Äù. As long as you get the plans before you register the armor, you‚Äôre fine. Problem is the boyfriend registered first, so the quest is complete, the option to get plans is now gone.
---
Don't forget to check the the atom shop for South facing workbenches!
---
&gt; My testing showed that it is actually worse than Tank Killer straight up.  
---
Alternately your test methodology and/or observation are flawed. It would be really surprising if you accurately observed a difference between 36% and 40% armor piercing with your current methodology of shooting robots and counting hits to kill.
---
You really can't argue with the game code. 40% &gt; 36%.
---
You can have an opinion.
---
But i think your rage and anger as evident in your words is waaaay out of proportion for a video game.
---
Most of you hand haters with your less than honest opinions are way to angry over a video game.
---
Now comes the claim you aren‚Äôt angry and insults to me.
---
/yawn 
---
Until there's no one left to buy stuff at the atom store, which won't happen. The Crown store is the only thing that kept ESO afloat in the beginning. It will probably be the same with 76. I don't know why people want the game to fail so hard. Is it because they predicted it would and so if it improves then they would be wrong?
---
FWIW I‚Äôve noticed that lately the game thinks I‚Äôm overencumbered when trying to fast travel sometimes, even when I‚Äôm not. Even 100 lbs under. 
---
If you increase the special that much, you lose the reasoning in making a build. While i agree its hella tedious and nerve wracking to have to stop and swap points around just to unlock/hack something, it nulls the reasoning into making a build for something. 
---
I personally would like a rework in how equipping perk cards would work. Like maybe a different bar to slot thing for ease of life cards like picklock, hacker, green thumb, etc. That would free up space in which you could slot other cards and not have to constantly have to un slot and reslot stuff. Like maybe make it work off of you same special you already have attained to 50. 
---
Lore friendly quest chains with different outcomes and more story-driven content would be my number 1 quality of life improvement, even though I'm a slow-leveling player who barely scratched the main story surface (level 17, so far) I've come across some very well designed, touching and immersive quests. I would want more of those for future Dlc's. Not everything is as bad in Fallout 76 as this elitist subreddit makes it out to be.
---
I'd be great if they focus on more roleplay, more immersion, getting back to the roots and not turning this into another loot fiesta generic MMo. If people wanna get into the hamster wheel, I've heard WoW is still online...
---
Oh I didnt forget. It's the bane of my existence. I hate swapping. But I think it would be far easier to allow more points than to create custom decks. I just dont have faith in Bethesda to implement a new system. So I'd rather go with this. 
---
Lockpick and hacking not being passive is absolutely insane. 
---
Having 20 different cards for crafting is ridiculous. 
---
Having a card to repair guns to 200% and a SEPARATE card for guns breaking slower is ridiculous. 
---
And the thing that really boils me is I have to keep 6 in charisma in order to share any decent cards but those are probably the cards I could most easily go down in points with. 
---
I hate that sharing cards is tied to charisma. It should be tied to level as well as lock pick and hacking. 
---
Level 15= lock pick 1, hacking 1 and sharing a 1pt card.
---
Level 30 = next levels and 50 all 3
---
I always try to pick armor with the most protection, and for some reason that usually ends up being leather armor. I thought for sure Combat Armor would be an upgrade from leather, but I knew so many upgrades for leather everything else seemed like crap in comparison. I don't get it. For example, I'd have a leather chest that does 33/72 vs combat armor chest that did something like 40/40. Yeah, it's got a bit more damage resistance, but I prefer the overall stats. I have finally found some legendary combat armor that's been worth using, but stuff that I assumed would be the best of the best (e.g., urban scout), the base stats are laughably bad. I must be doing something wrong.
---
Graham and Watoga train station actually share a cap pool, so if you're seeing 0 caps at one you'll also be seeing 0 caps at the other.
---
Meh really don‚Äôt care for PvP I just care that my camp or I get griefed.
---
By the way I didn‚Äôt say lvl60 and lvl300 are the same just how their bounties are assessed.
---
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think my question is unclear.
---
Let me rephrase it perhaps.
---
"Has anyone received a 2* or 3* legendary from a no-star legendary enemy, e.g. the Whitespring ghouls?"
---
I don't buy that idea of 0* legendaries.
---
I think it would be neat to see the base armors that would go on to become the armors we've seen in previous games. Imagine being able to get some basic football pad armor at the the schools? Or riot gear in the larger police stations? It could even just be cosmetic. 
---
Speaking of cosmetic "armor", howabout a classic Armored Vault Suit or other such "armored" clothing to cover up whatever mishmash of armor parts you may not want showing?
---
Have you not looked at the rest of this thread?
---
A producer would have to be involved with any road map. There aren't any producers on this game.
---
The only mention from a CM on a road map is that they were working with an artist on it.
---
An artist...
---
Yes I think it‚Äôs lag. Mine does it all the time. Because I get in and out of power Armor I see it a lot.
---
As a player who has officially given up, I cannot stress enough how much active communication from the devs would have alleviated my frustration and kept me checking up or even actively playing. 
---
Ye I know but I don't have much free time to play so I wish there was vehicle to get around quickly. There would be no need to fast travel and be much more fun getting in to trouble along the way 
---
That's why everyone wants it to fail, it's the only way to get their money back lol
---
For things like lock picking and hacking you should be able to combine the cards but they just take one slot, not three.  
---
I get the passive skill idea, I just don‚Äôt see it being easily applied to the game.  Being able to combine cards and have them take one slot should be easily programmed.  Just my thought.

"Wow, some idiot really put toilets everywhere in my house. Fuck this game, goodbye post to reddit incoming."
---
I could see it lmao
---
Yeah totally agree tho I feel if you have a bloody explosive the calculus changes a little. Now trying to figure out if perforating is better than stinging :) 
---
If they really wanted to save the game quickly they would post the numbers for how many people have done what missions. 
---
We could then go though that list and give them specific reasons the good missions are good, and the bad missions are bad. 
---
While the actual costs if you paid for Atoms is pretty crazy, you can get plenty of Atoms in game by completing challenges. 
---
Thank you so kindly for lending me your time. Hell of a read, and a little dismaying. 
---
Whenever I read stuff like this, I just feel more and more of a push to head back to Fallout 4. Same game, just single player with fleshed out content.
---
I‚Äôm not angry, I‚Äôm not insulting you. The games shit. It had bugs from like 5 years ago still in the engine. I didn‚Äôt buy a beta, I bought a full priced, RELEASED game. This game was barely an early access and it was hyped up to be ‚Äúfallout multiplayer‚Äù when half of what made fallout diverse and feel like a world was removed, in favor for a grind expierience with no challenge and even worse one boss total for end game content. I was really excited for this game on announcement, had I know it was going to be this poor of a product, I‚Äôd have never bought it. 
---
Get Martial Artist for your Gatling gun. Trust me on this.
---
The packaged foods don't count for or against the eating mutations I have herbivore but can still eat and benefit from Salisbury steaks 
---
It's the same parent company that put out ESO, if they didn't take that out behind the shed five years ago then I have high hopes for this
---
I've been getting a lot of disconnects on PS4 the last 2 days... rebooted everything and did a bit of testing, turns out my ping times are way slower than usual on all devices, likely due to the freezing cold &amp; snow keeping everyone inside causing the Internet usage across the whole region/country to be much higher than usual.  
---
Holy shyt what an upbeat community!
---
I have starched genes at full power.  I had marsupial mutation for many weeks at this point.  Yesterday my marsupial mutation disappeared.   I might have taken a buffout yesterday.  (I think I took something next to buffout and the cursor changed to buffout and I ended up taking that too but I cannot swear to it.)
---
I don't recall having rad worms, but I do end up having it a lot of the time I'm playing.   I went from jumping around everywhere like I always do to returning back to "how the rest of the people live" and having to run around fences that I usually just jumped over.
---
The marsupial mutation was gone as far as I could see it.   I did not take any RadX and even if I had, it would have said that the mutation is suppressed.  It didn't say that.  It was gone.   I just so happened to meet someone later that day that could make some serums and he sold me several mutations so I got Marsupial back later, but no number of relogs or amount of time brought my mutation back to me until I took the new serum.
---
I'm getting tired of having my character screwed over by some of these more lossy bugs.  Losing my best chameleon armor to the bugged hopper at Momma Dolce's quest, losing my marsupial, and having a mutation flat f-ing disappear weeks ago just before I got marsupial is really ticking me off.  It's hard enough to get some of these things even once, but when the game just freakin' steals them from you with no recourse to get it back, it really sucks.
---
Possibly meant to be added in later via Atom Store or DLC?
---
My heavies are only for nuke runs. Anti armor Gatling, Furious .50 cal usually get the job done against SBQ and Whitespring bloateds.
---
But i also rock a 2 shot lever action and a two shot sniper rifle. Ive always been a rifleman in every fallout
---
Regarding the Halloween costume plans: Below the Crevasse Dam (South of the Thunder Mountain Power Plant), there is a 65 sign on the road on the map. Where that 65 sign is, there is possible spawning spot for a dead trick or treater body to appear there with the possibility of the plans spawning on them (sometimes it's a holotape ad talking about the pumpkin house but don't take it with you cause it ceases the body from spawning there till you get rid of it). Took me about an hour of server hopping to finally get the plans for the witches outfit (:
---
Hazmat suits sell good as well!
---
Will have to disagree here - there's already far too much in the way of stacking and super powerful builds even with SPECIAL capped at 50.  The hard cap should remain as is today, it still forces some choices.
---
What the game needs instead of SPECIAL stats power creep is for certain perks to be passive perks - ie. always in effect and you don't have to equip them.
---
Some people like the look of certain armor pieces.
---
I have a friend that wears a combat armor chest and leather legs.  Just likes the look of it.
---
After watching the Rage 2 gameplay, we now know where the budgets for Just Cause 4 (Avalanche) and Fallout 76 went to.
---
Like I said in the post, there's 539 points you can invest into perks. Getting access to another 26 (Meaning roughly 9 more 3 rank perks) isn't going to hurt build variety in the slightest. The fact that we need so many perks just to manage stuff, like Traveling Pharmacy or Gunsmith, is what actually hurts build diversity. 
---
Never for me.
---
0 stars commonly give me nothing and sometimes 1*
---
Well I'm waiting lol
---
Mutations shouldn't just disappear even when you exit and log back into the game.  My marsupial was flat fucking gone yesterday.  I forgot to add that when I logged back in:  I had Carnivore on my character.  I think Carnivore was the first mutation I got just before marsupial MORE than 3 weeks ago!   Whatever mutation I got before Marsupial was flat gone when I got that second mutation.   I'll go edit my reply because I realize that having another mutation show up that wasn't there for many weeks is also part of the possibly related issue that I experienced.
---
Don‚Äôt know if you are adding these yet, but the Anti-Armor legendary modifier does not apply to energy damage so it has no effect as a modifier on lasers and energy damage of plasma weapons.
---
That would look really nice. I wish there were more options when it came to Power Armor paint customization. However, I really want them to fix the game first.
---
This one is just mean! But props for the creativity haha
---
Are your sure?
---
Point is: times change and what it takes to make something changes as well. 
---
What‚Äôs so hard to understand?
---
I wouldnt mind my 70 levels reseted at all at this point id rather have it reseted for everyone.
---
Not sure if anyone else has the same experience, but for me, the non-star legendaries tend not to regenerate health. One notable exception for me was a legendary glowing hermit crab. It definitely regenerated while I was plugging it with my Gatling gun. 
---
I do get starred legendaries that don‚Äôt regenerate, but it is usually because I did damage too quickly. 
---
on stop with that fantasy. they already committed to private servers and mods.
---
Soon...*I hope*.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for them. I want them. 
---
So you don‚Äôt like the game. I do. Lots and lots of people do.
---
Answer this. Why do you need to keep talking about something you don‚Äôt like? 
---
Move on. It‚Äôs not the game for you. It doesn‚Äôt say anything about you if you don‚Äôt like the game. 
---
But it says a lot about you that you have to go and look at posts about a game you don‚Äôt like, and not playing, just do you can comment about the game.
---
Yup. Seen that one a few times. 
---
That may explain it then. However that does not make sense as there is no relation between the two.
---
Fantastic, thank you.  
---
Added and Reported.
---
Gonna match the mods and try that on super mutants when I log in, cause I have the same 3 star gauss, the only difference is 1 is aa and the other is ts.
---
Anthem is pretty important to bioware overall.
---
It does highlight how 76 isn't that important to bethesda
---
I find them very inconsistent also. I often get 1* from no-prefix and no legendary from "legendary" (no star) prefix, so I am trying to work out if there's any rhyme or reason to it at all tbh. I probably need a new thread, tbh, I don't think I phrased this one very well :/
---
IDK man, so many reused assets on a already existing engine, i dont think it was that much investment at all. They just dont see how to profit and are abandoning it, of course i have nothing to back that up, just my crazy mind.
---
Part of these I've addressed on the other pages.  
---
Both the Vendors you mentioned share cap pools with other factions. 
---
Rest will be addressed on related pages once ready.
---
Careful, don't let anyone who bought a TSE with real money off a Chinese website see this, you'll drown in downvotes.
---
The game needs a full reset even without a relaunch.
---
Every Youtuber and griefer shouldn't have a TSE weapon.
---
Yes, but the other way around would be a lot better to discourage hoarding and mindless levelling, which takes you nowhere. The higher the level, the smaller the stash space. Down to a minimum of 100.
---
its knives and forks etc in the cafeteria..and morgantown school has a lot of plastic pumpkins
---
Soloing a silo at level 55 is going to be tough.  If you go, bring 2-3 other people.
---
Soloing a silo after you min/max your build at 100, not so tough.
---
You must be trolling. Honestly I‚Äôve moved on a while ago, what I‚Äôm upset about is the fact that I LOVE fallout as a franchise and if this is what we will come to expect, I‚Äôll continue putting 1k+ hours on the old games and not the garbage being rushed out. I understand you must not pay for your games (based on the fact that you seem to think people having differing opinions should just not talk about it) but I got one don‚Äôt think this game was worth $60. And that‚Äôs why it was one of the single worst releases I‚Äôve ever seen in my 10+ years of gaming. Hands down worst
---
No-no... "Thank you for your reply, I'll be passing it to the dev."
---
What is your definition of "GamePlay"?
---
All 4 of these pages could qualify
---
Yep, same. It seems as long as they don't have stars they don't regen. And yet at the same time they can drop legendary items.
---
I am trying to figure out what category these creatures fit it, tbh.
---
Losing caps or items in PvP is ridiculous. Make a new currency and make it "PvP  exclusive", you can gain some or lose some depending on the outcome. 
---
The problem is they DONT care. Just move on, the FO76 team is probably reduced down to a skeleton crew now and all hands are on deck for Starfield. This game failed miserably for them so they‚Äôre probably going to leave a skeleton crew on it to support it just enough to say they haven‚Äôt abandoned it. I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything substantial moving forward just small updates fixing and breaking things
---
They've been reading the threads and replying.  There isn't much else they can do without updating the game which hopefully they do and we get more of.
---
Yes I know this requires patience of a gaming community and that's asking a lot.  But I have accepted this and it's easier that way.
---
I found the chest plan using a treasure map in the savage divide. They still exist, just really hard to find. 
---
You need to have a weapon drawn for the Chameleon mutation to activate while wearing Weightless armor. 
---
Welcome brother. Enjoy.
---
This is simply not correct. It's +/-15 levels.
---
This is why Uranium Fever is one of the most popular events in the game.
---
If that was the case, then none of the other tests would have worked out either. Yet every time more AP was added, the shot count fell at a commensurate rate. 
---
But I'm not trying to observe a 4% difference. I'm observing a 6% difference *going the other way*. If the AP is 30%, it would be just a tiny bit worse. If it was 40%, it would be just a tiny bit better or dead even. It was worse. If you're arguing game code, go for it. I'll go with my actual in game testing and not what someone else on the internet said. 
---
No offence, but its because y'all will bitch about anything.
---
"My thumb is sore, fuck you Todd Howard"
---
"I just grinded bosses everyone knows don't yield good results, I got bad results. Wtf!?!?!"
---
"This guy walked into my camp. REEEEE"
---
Guys. Shut the fuck up. I'm so sick of this subreddit, it's become a 600 person circlejerk.
---
I don‚Äôt think the 0* legendary robots in Watoga regenerate when ever I kill them.
---
i only had enough atoms for 1 so i went with silver shroud
---
Yep. There are actually recipes for breaded chicken that is then dredged in cereal and either baked crisp or fried.  It's pretty good.  (I prefer baked when it is done right.)  Cereals I've had:  Honey Bunches of O's  (I thought it would be too sweet, but it was good), Corn Flakes,  and one more but the name isn't coming to me...     Something similar to Sugar Bombs might be questionable but to your question about cooking with cereal: It is quite plausible in general.
---
No, hate to tell people they are wrong.  But you're wrong.  If you can give me video evidence of a level 40 mole miner dropping anything above level 40, I will eat my words.
---
See, insults. I knew you'd get there. And yes, saying something along the lines of i must not pay for my games is trying to insult me. 
---
You haven't moved on. You've been making posts and comments every few days. 
---
Surviving. Day to day survival. Been surviving since day one of the beta. Between scorched and disconnects.........  surviving.
---
I hit level 50 and quit.
---
I wish the enclave mask can be used with the brotherhood hood!  Currently I rock Marine Wetsuit Helmet, and Reinforced Combat armor chest and arms (red).  Studded Stealth Leather legs.  (level 26 on current playthru)
---
Did you see any UGL specimens drop with legendary effects?
---
Same as with the more powerful enclave plasma gun, the UGL/EP variants represent an alternative that rocks a ~~~x1.2 damage modifier. 
---
I‚Äôd love to substitute my regular one but a regular specimen with a bloodied effect is a x1.9 damage modifier. 
---
Could you provide me a link to an article or post on it?  
---
The effect, when drilled down uses a generic bypass "Mod Target Damage Resistance", and there is no "Mod Target Energy Resistance" which makes me think it does all resistances.
---
I agree vats should prefer enemies, but will also point out that the reason it currently switches to another friendly after a kill is due to a perk you've equipped.  Yes it increases your damage, but at the price of disorientation if there are nearby enemies around you.  Imo, this perk is not worth the small damage boost (unless you're ok with the spinning).
---
Lol. I do not see why not. Either you didn‚Äôt read my post where I state giving us the option to have concentrated fire in it‚Äôs old state or the new state, or you are just trolling trying to prevent progression in a hurting game.
---
So, I just made a master list of the Faces, take a look later:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apwgj6/fallout_metal_faces_catalogue/
---
I'd love to see if we can find more of those six statues! =]]
---
Amen to that. I like me some thorough discussions that aren't full of salt (warranted or otherwise). 
---
Also this makes me feel good about my Anti-Armor 10mm SMG. Tried and true, that baby. Also when you give it a perforating mag it becomes an Armor-Piercing Anti-Armor 10mm SMG. lol
---
Are they really rare? I have/see them all the time, found 17 on me when I was wondering where all my weight was coming from.
---
Don't know about you guys, but i feel Anthem will have even less content than 76 had on release. They want to have some control of what people can expect (something that bethesda missed at launch), so they know they can expect new content "AT THE FUTURE". I don't know what's really stopping bethesda from trying to hype a few things up here and there with what we can EXPECT in the near future as much as content goes by.
---
I've been disappointed by the Lever Action so far. I feel like I need a Legendary to really do it justice but I'm super happy they fixed the reloading. 
---
Another reason why Pistols are garbage.
---
So, I just made a new master list with all the Faces locations! Take a look later! 
---
Road map? That map will be filled with cul-de-sacs. This game is dead. Bethesda doesn't want to invest in it as it will forever be known as a huge joke so even if they poured in millions, it wouldn't translate into amazing sales. It's dead. The end.
---
Great stuff! lmk
---
No, I read it. I simply think this isn‚Äôt worth an iota of developer time.
---
Good luck adapting.
---
This is not true.
---
Uranium Fever drops +/-15 the mole miner's level, which is 40. So 25-55 (50 because cap) items drop.
---
I can show you recent items dropped if you'd like?
---
(Am not soliciting trades)
---
I tend to have this problem when I take more than one workshop, though I play on XB1. Charleston Landfill is a particularly troublesome workshop for disconnects. 
---
I havent played in a while now but thats just because I feel like ive done all there is to do. Im always waiting for a good update to drop to get me playing again but I mean I guess they have to iron out all the kinks and bugs before adding new content. Im definitely down to play when vaults open and factions start playing a larger role. Until then I guess I can just be patient. There are a lot of games coming that can occupy me until then. Hopefully it isnt too long though. I understand all the concerns for diehard fans and people who want to play fo76.
---
It's also wrong info.
---
Count yourself luck.  The one I fought had a ladle ... a LADLE!!!  
---
You could just add a passive slot bar that shows you the passive cards you have unlocked.
---
IMO, all crafting perks should be passives. They shouldn't have added perk cards that do crafting AND give you combat/gameplay bonuses like durability. Makes no sense we have cards that have multiple abilities, but then you have all those hacking cards that aren't combined.
---
They are the same, which is why there's a serious flaw with the way bounties are accessed. A level 300 has no advantages at all over a level 60. There's no added damage, no added resistances, no better gear, etc. And before you mention gear, remember that wide-spread duping for weeks has made the top gear accessible to just about everyone.
---
Maybe you could explain to me how a level 300 is more powerful than a level 60, especially to the point where you feel a level 60 should get double the reward on a level 300. 
---
That's what I'm trying to determine. But I think the evidence is pointing to being deliberate. Did you see the Kirby Head in Fort Hagen and the Whitespring Resort? Don't you think it's suspicious?
---
I think a remarketed relaunch could work like FFXIV.
---
FFXIV was a toxic joke before the relaunch.
---
It is a top tier MMO now.
---
I will agree with a part of your statement.  They can, and regularly, drop items 5/10 levels lower than the enemy level.
---
Exactly! 
---
It‚Äôs more than a little self serving and entitled. 
---
Just do your thing and move on, OP doesn‚Äôt even have a firm grasp of the industry and wants to ‚Äúspeak for the community.‚Äù
---
You can all quit creating these posts because Bethesda doesn't give a fuck.
---
 I'm deeply saddened by all of this. Just wow. I used to love bethesda games, I grew up playing the entire Elder scrolls and fallout series, every damn title. Unfortunately, the only reason I even play this game anymore is just so that I don't feel I was robbed entirely of the fallout experience. 
---
 Think about the potential experience this game could have been, this *a fallout game:* I wanted to experience this game with mods and maybe even play on my own server with some friends to avoid overall griefing and some of the more toxic members of the community that are going around duping, hacking, picking on individual players and/or destroying bases for a quick laugh. This is not the game any of us wanted at all... we're just getting stepped on by the corporate boot of Bethesda people.
---
 This brings us to the modding &amp; private server problem: As long as I don't have an unfair advantage over other people that purchased the game (as that would compromise the integrity of the online experience) then I should be able to use the product I paid for how I see fit, as should others.
---
 To add insult to injury with this purchase, even if I attempted to host a private server again, with my own game that I paid for with my own cash and should be able to play how I see fit bethesda will threaten legal action and a cease and desist order.  Think I'm joking? Go and try it yourself.
---
 I wanted a true *fallout* game that *happened* to be online, not a shitty mtx filled online game branded as fallout. It's honestly a shame too because the voice acting, large map, actual combat, leveling system, and events are actually enjoyable, and would love to modify the game further on a private platform that shows these enjoyable components off and remove bugs and problems from the game.
---
My life is already a mess, it's tough to pay rent, my partner's grandfather passed away this month, I failed an entire course in university, and all I god damn needed was a solid fallout title to play, modify, and enjoy to help me get through it, but this game literally just makes it all much worse. 
---
My friends online keep asking about the private server, I have to remind them I could get into real legal trouble and I barely have enough cash as is. Bethesda continues to feed us bullshit, and prosecute their own customer base. Please Bethesda just reach out to the community like you promised to, fix your puke stain of a fallout title and give us a real fucking game that we not only asked for, *WE PAID YOU FOR THIS SHIT*.
---
TLDR; Don't further support companies with your hard earned money that don't support or care for the overall experience of their customers. Bethesda has joined that list unfortunately.
---
The Mythical ladle, destroyer of worlds, vanquisher of soup O\_o 
---
Because there is *nothing* to hype.
---
I can actually do that if you really want :) Shadowplay is a wonderful thing :)
---
The question is how HARD will you eat your words? :)
---
Here's my tradelist (I am not interested in trading at this time, so this is not a plug), which is pretty much exclusively from UF:
---
it is, its the third or fourth thread hes made trying to plug his youtube for lore that isn't really in game at all.
---
You seem to be under the impression that this quality of life change would take a lot of time.
---
I think we need more points AND we need a revamped perk card management system like passives, etc.
---
Charisma for sharing is just a way of balancing out your character, since perk combos can be insanely OP: eg rad sponge + ghoulish.
---
The only thing I disagree with is repair/crafting perks and durability perks being one card. I think that things that help you craft or repair guns should be always on passives (that still need required specials), but things that modify your combat or gameplay like damage, durability, carry, damage resistance, etc should be cards you slot in.
---
&gt; I wish Bethesda gave a fuck like EA. I can't believe I just wrote that. 
---
woof, that hurt to read.
---
Weightless + Ultra Light should make any type of armor have 0 weight, seeing as I had a Weightless Ultra Light Heavy Metal Chest that had 0 weight.
---
Things like that are ease of life perks. Special stats arent just for equipping cards. They have other effects as well. Increasing them would def hurt build variety since everyone would be close to having near max stats across the board. 
---
However, having a seperate allotment for ease of life cards, would keep special at a point to where it has the player choose what kind of character he/she wants to make. If people have the high special points, they will still undeniably pick combat related perks because they want to make it an all around build. So it nulls having more special to make things easier for ease of life cards. We would still have a situation of having to swap cards out all the time anyways.
---
Level 189, got a game going once, crashed before I met my mark.  
---
Standard procedure for this garbage game.
---
They're probably getting so much hate that they can't win no matter what they say until they actually put out a patch worth a damn
---
I ... I can't talk about it.  Its still too soon.  
---
Run the circuit at Whitespring, kill robots in Watoga, do Uranium Fever and AWOL Armaments 
---
A radius marker will show up on the map that follows your target.
---
I thought this about the holotapes from the sensor collection terminals, but then found they were connected to a mission. It's possible it's hidden elsewhere, or as you said is for DLC where we can activate the weather machine.
---
I'll keep looking. Thanks for your reply
---
Just like how they committed to making a good fallout game...
---
Here's the problem.  You can not just put up a list of items you claim to have gotten from Uranium fever and expect for someone to not call you out.  But please, show me in real time you getting a higher level drop from a mole miner.  I actually love being proved wrong.
---
I saw a excavator left leg there
---
Tell you what.
---
How's about you join me and we server hop til we get the event. We'lll get 6 legendaries between us.
---
If none of them is level 50, I'll put up a new post (and update this one) about how I'm a dickhead that gets everything wrong.
---
If ONE of them is level 50, though, you get to do the same.
---
Up for it?
---
My IGN is Istaria :)
---
[17 days ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajp8a5/please_release_a_planned_roadmap/eeymseh/) they were "laying it out."
---
[Yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apgfhr/sowhats_up_with_that_roadmap/eg90kai/?context=0) they said they were "finalizing" it.
---
Maybe we'll see it, but I have a feeling it's not going to be what any of us want.
---
I never got the Mark III's to work at all.
---
I got a prompt saying I learned it but I can't craft it may have happened to you 
---
I‚Äôm under the impression it would take a non-zero amount of time.
---
Given the amount of serious bugs, missing QOL features and the amount of end game content that needs development, I just think that your request isn‚Äôt worth spending any time on.
---
But that‚Äôs just my opinion.
---
Sure, you on Xbox?
---
Not sure about the 300 but I am 70 and am still leveling by just doing stuff I like in FO76. My build is complete so I have no need to level anymore, it just happens as I play now.
---
Anyhow I play FO76 for other reasons than most on this reddit from what I can tell.
---
I use combat armor but after reading this, I might have to actually start looking at the stats. I just figured combat was top of the line besides PA. but I don't use PA (unless I am being forced to in a nuke zone) because it's too bulky and not for me.
---
Right now I'm grabbing everything not bolted to the ground, saving resources, collecting ammo.. then I'm going to do more of the brotherhood and enclave quests. I'm not grinding through the game and over two months I've made it to level 35. I've built and rebuilt my camp three times because I love camp building. I went from a copper ore to an acid resource and I plan on bulking up on acid for a while once I smelt all my copper. Sometimes I'll set up Poseidon to generate cores and set it up free for anyone to take (how I like to rebuild). 
---
It's been a chill ride throughout. 
---
You might have your posts mixed up
---
Nope, I'm on PC. Looks like this can't work. Pity.
---
If you are level 10 do the leader of the pack event near the fairgrounds.
---
Not sure how to explain this one. When using the perks for slower degrading durability and faster reload for heavy weapons.
---
If you get out of your PA and go back in they will not work until they have been removed and reapplied in the perk menu. This may be why most heavy weapons feel like they degrade ridiculously fast sometimes and not others. 
---
Same for the reload speed perk. [have video evidence of this one occurring and maybe the degraded one as well]
---
You mean the people how crafted to many weapons also violated the terms of service. Nice try pal.
---
I'll easily give money to people who prove Bethesda doesn't know what the fuck they are doing with a mp title. Only microtransaction I'll pay tbh.
---
‚ÄúHey honey, you want to see if we can find any legendary wood tonight? üòè‚Äù ‚Äúoh god oh fuck what are you doing that‚Äôs not what I meant‚Äù

Nah this is an insult, whatever snowflake 
---
I got a prompt , thought the same thing, then I grabbed a combat armor helmet out of my box. I can put it on the helmet. After scrapping nearly 1000 I've learned most available mods for combat armor, just not the legs
---
Primarily shopping. Some junk runs for components that are low. Usually a stop in Flatwoods to drop off some supplies for newbies. Maybe explore a new area every now and then.

There isn't a lot to do nowadays now that most of the main quest is done.
---
Yup. Add speed demon and youre reloading in the blink of an eye. I always carry about 1000 rounds on me.
---
Yea i had a regular one that where i favored my .308 but the legendary is my go to.
---
they can hire me, i'll move for free
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the beta, and just hit 100 finally.
---
I‚Äôm currently spending my time making my camp look purty, and helping out low level players.
---
Currently working towards getting enough caps to buy the mutation serum recipes :)
---
Shame, but if youd still like to send me a video of you doing the event today.  I'll gladly watch it and send one of my own once I get back on.üòä
---
Fair enough
---
You should try to solo a silo once you have decent weapons and armor. I recommend a full set of X-01 and several good weapons for your build, such as super sledges for melee, gauss rifle/handmade for rifleman, 50 cal/ Gatling for heavy gunner, etc. make sure all of your weapons and armor are max level, and you should be fine. Make sure to bring lots of ammo and stimpacks.
---
Shit. Look what you‚Äôve done to me. 
---
Now I‚Äôm gonna go do this. 
---
no worries :3
---
Craft one from the hunting rifle plan and mod it; 78 damage, 200 accuracy. I usually recraft with every level increment of 10, which improves the stats slightly. 
---
Yep, I'll link it here. It's 9pm where I live (Ireland) and I haven't eaten yet, so I may post tomorrow. I hope this doesn't invalidate the vid :)
---
For me the only times it's mattered was if the armour was too heavy or too expensive to repair. Stuck with leather for the longest time because of these reasons.
---
Yea, this post right here Todd. May your name forever be praised!!! Hail Todd, the one and only deity. Please bless me with atoms.
---
Sure, that's fine
---
I think they stack multiplicatively to each other rather than additional, at least that is what i have heard and thats what it feels like, and i heard that tenderizer is a debuff to the enemy so that 5% to 7% gets taken into account after the damage has been reduced by armor rather than influencing the base damage
---
Might be selfish but I honestly never touch the online potion and the main game is easily worth the launch price of admission. I‚Äôm so pleased with the purchase.
---
BoS mod for combat armor isn't sold (currently) at any vendor since the update.  Same with the Pocketed/Deep Pocketed mods.
---
And as far as I know, you cannot learn the BoS mod by scrapping combat armor.  I think it can only be learned by plan.
---
I've not been lucky enough to find the BOS mod plan in the wild yet.  I haven't server hopped locations, just checking standard mod spawn locations every time I am near them during my normal daily routine.
---
I appreciate it, but I am content to die on this hill. 
---
&gt;Gun Fu: V.A.T.S. swaps targets on kill with +10%, +20%, then +30% damage to your next 3 target.
---
No disorientation debuffs mentioned and it's not really an excuse for a messed up VATS system. I can simply just press Q and it'll target a friendly instead of any ghouls in that huge pile of enemies. 
---
30% isn't really that small...
---
&gt;Dev team informed management that progress is doing well and that they will have a monster  hit ready for release Q4 2019.
---
Doesnt work that way. Budgets are allocated time frame wise. Only Legendary figures like Kojima would be given the advantage of not getting one. A project is exactly like a tender where the milestones and schedule is prepared before they even begin.
---
Unfortunately, I don't believe Bethesda will ever recover from this. If Bethesda was the (1st Century) HRE, Fallout 76 was the 4th Crusade. Not only have they failed to communicate what the game was at launch, but they've failed to communicate to buyers of the Power Armor addition with the canvas stuff, they failed to communicate with and through their own game launcher (which is VERY anti-consumer), they failed to communicate for patches and updates, and the list goes on, and on, and Nuka Rum-on. If Bethesda was going to fix this, they would have done it from day 1. Now we're in the next year and they remain silent. Even their useless public relations guy is silent on all accounts (he should be fired since he isn't doing his job lmho). Unless they update their engine (which they said they wouldn't, even for ES6), and unless new management comes into play, we're on a decline baby. Bethesda's reputation is like uranium radiation: can't stop the half-life
---
Funny thing is that, the more I play, the less I need storage capacity.
---
at first I didnt know what to keep and I quickly ran out of storage, my first levels were really harsh and frustrating.
---
now, I always have &gt;100lb of free space in my stash all the time.
---
After a while you learn how to deal with the restriction.
---
This week on Inside the Vault: 'We are doing things, stay tuned'
---
Some people on this sub: 'Wow thanks Bethesda so hyped can't wait to see it'
---
I always like to hear about the kind things players are doing for each other. I've got some of my best legendaries through players leaving them in containers for someone else to find and I've started adopting the practice myself (especially with plans now the known tag is in the game).
---
&lt;troll&gt;All servers are the test server&lt;/troll&gt;
---
Just don‚Äôt use them , trash damage all around.
---
I got called aggressive and antagonistic the other day for suggesting they simply add some NPCs and people would be MUCH happier. 
---
you make a great point about modders though. give modders the reigns and I guarantee you will have fun quests and interesting NPCs before the week is out. 
---
It does require speaking - it requires repeating what was heard, that is the thing they absolutely ARE NOT doing. It's a bad relationship.
---
I think the vault 111 doctor shared the plans with vault tech somehow, and then the other vaults built them and used them as weapons when they opened. You can find dead vault dwellers around Appalachia, so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much of a stretch.
---
If I get told day after day that I suck, eventually it would affect me. 
---
Well, stuff like the Camden Park dailies are defiantly character, not account, specific, so you don‚Äôt need a second for those. 
---
Sorry for my initial short reply. I think I‚Äôve got some bitterness to work through.
---
If I had my wish each body part would have an associated hot key so we didn‚Äôt have to cycle through each of them.
---
Yes,  I've received 1, 2, and 3 star legendaries from non legendary kills when I loot.  RNG
---
Can you describe the process how that would be implemented?
---
Yes, let's feel pity for the people pushing out garbage like Fallout 76 and then spending three months making it worse.
---
&gt; I don't buy that idea of 0* legendaries.
---
It's basically what they are.  Legendary, but not quite 1*.  Not legendary enough to count for the Enclave, but will drop 1* Legendary items.
---
Whether or not you want to call them a no-star legendary is kind of moot at that point.  Cause they aren't a "hidden" 1, 2, or 3-star legendary.
---
I find a lot at whitesprings. The key is to wait until no one is around the golf course. Then you fast travel there and enemies will always spawn if its the first visit for you on that server. Also hit up the cottages and the side parking lot. Ive 
---
Maximum 4 so far, have seen one but never looted one.
---
I think we hoped for too much. Expecting weekly/monthly content? I was. 
---
Because if this game succeeds (by that I mean 'makes a load of money', not 'be a good game') then guess what's in store for the Elder Scrolls franchise. Another polarising, franchise killing cash grab. And guess what direction the new IP Starfield will go in.
---
I have a feeling the whole system might be a little busted right now but I think I've only ever got a 1 star item from legendary enemies without any stars by their name.
---
&gt; that level 50 is just as well geared.
---
I'm not really a min/max type person, I just play a lot.  My friend is significantly more casual minded than I am, were both about level 140.  An hour ago a level 47 with an explosive rifle one-shotted both of us and with my friend not knowing how PvP works went for revenge and got us each one-shotted again.  Not sure about my buddy's exact numbers but we were both in power armor and I had 305hp and 335dr.  
---
Despite all the salt here and in other forums those guns are still basically a prerequisite for PvP.  The dude made over 500 caps on 4 pulls of the trigger and would need to die 10 times over to lose it, seems really unbalanced considering the level 47 can clearly spec themselves to be equally viable.  
---
I haven't heard of anyone successfully taming robots.
---
"Between this, and literally NOBODY fighting in that "Civil War Fortnite Event" I really wonder why so much time and money has been put into developing PVP further when almost nobody wants it or uses what is already there "
---
\-Everyone
---
I‚Äôm really in two minds. I may give this another go. 
---
My primary concern is that like with the Gatling (where prime does +25% damage and -25% fire rate, as compared to the speedy receiver), here prime does x1.15 or so damage, but means losing a receiver that keeps the hit rate Uber-high. If the prime as compared to that means you miss many of your shots, you didn‚Äôt gain DPS, just flux hassle and fresher cores. 
---
Your negativity is worth a block.
---
The only thing I haven‚Äôt been able to solo is the scorch beast queen.
---
If only they had a Beta or something to work out the bugs before release... hmmm....
---
PS4, unfortunately for me. I appreciate it, though!
---
isn't it obvious by now this game is just a cash grab? I think it's time to wise up fam
---
Think plans to learn @ Grafton &amp; Watoga (BOS Vendor) maybe..?
---
Nuuuuu that guy is wrong those are great weapons in the right builds..use slugger and gladiator..I rip bases apart with chainsaw and ripper
---
This is awesome. Creative trolling without destroying the CAMP. 
---
Did you factor in the fact that Melee and Energy Weapons cannot get the Explosive trait?  Or that Melee in general cannot get a lot of the ranged traits?
---
No.  They are no longer available at the vendors since the last update that changed Vendor plans.
---
That would honestly be great. Yeah I feel you man, this game has so much potential and I do enjoy it so to see it in the state it is is just disappointing. Glad we could come to a common ground hahah
---
Nice one, will add to my list.
---
As to luck on loot spawning I find the same thing in my other looter addiction TD1. Some nights I get great loot from enemies on my loot runs and other nights I get junk gear. Luck of the draw with RNG.
---
Lucky for me I get enjoyment out of the runs itself and not just the loot at the end of the run.
---
Based on the past 4 months, they are providing a product that is on par with their capabilities. Sadly.
---
I tuned to it in the early days but never had anything come about from it. The game doesn't really do a great job of highlighting what it does (honestly I'm still not certain about the specifics of it). 
---
I have a feeling Survival Mode will be where all the people who want PvP go in the future.
---
soft cap*
---
hard cap implies leveling stops completely 
---
Elder scrolls already has the franchise killing cash grab lol. Have you played ESO yet?
---
Apply lol.
---
I think this is one of those suggestions that everyone is in favor of simply because people like "more" no matter what that means but from a game design perspective I think balance would become very difficult.  Those nerfs to perks you rattled off were all an attempt to balance the game (something that mattered less in prior single player outings of this franchise).  
---
There is already a large disparity between the amount of damage a player can output with the right legendary equipment and perks.  More SPECIAL points would either allow players to patch up 100% of the holes in their builds and not have to make many, if any sacrifices.  
---
Please note I'm not using the above to argue against your suggestion.  I'm just pointing out that there will be ultra powerful characters that come out of an increase to max level 76.  If the devs are cool with that then game on. :)  
---
Some examples: 
---
1. In order to make a true "alpha strike" character you need 9 ranks in whatever weapon you specialize in and also supporting perks. A lot of people stop at 3 ranks in weapon bonus because of the diminishing returns you get from the rest of the ranks but 26 extra SPECIAL makes picking those extra 6 ranks up no biggie.
---
2. If you didn't already have it you'd have plenty of room for luck.  Better criticals, critical savvy, grim reapers sprint and 4 leaf clover magnify damage output by a very substantial amount ESPECIALLY when combined with the right legendary effects and chems.
---
3. Take a non PA build, a lot of these must sacrifice damage for defense or vice versa.  Now all non pa builds can max out damage AND also take plenty of perk based defense skills like evasive, ironclad etc.  You'd see a huge uptick in people rocking hazmat suits in nuke zones as they'd all have decent damage and energy resist (200+) and top end RR, to the point where it would make PA a lot less worth it (hazmat is 1000 radiation resist).  
---
There are plenty of other options out there but the moral of the story is players will become dramatically more powerful.  Maybe not a bad thing at this point but players might get bored once optimized builds become well known.
---
Eat..grab loot to sell at vendors and currently working on buying all the plans each vendor sells..so far got 3 vendors down..at white springs atm and need like 4 more plans from there and I‚Äôll be done
---
Hi u/spectral000,
---
The feedback we receive on Reddit, and forums, and social continue to be the most valued and helpful in determining what gets fixed and implemented when and where. Patch 6 is currently scheduled for next week and should address several issues we‚Äôve been seeing people post about (and more) including:
---
* Scorchbeast scream frequency
---
* Dead tamed creatures causing C.A.M.P. budget to increase and never decrease
---
* Rad worms increasing all player effects by 50%
---
* Accidental damage to another player‚Äôs C.A.M.P. causing a WANTED status
---
* Items accidentally being lost in the hopper during ‚ÄúFeed the People‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs to name a few. Beyond that, we are working on getting the roadmap up so everyone knows what we‚Äôre planning through 2019. We are aiming to get that posted by end of the month at the very latest. 
---
No, but they seemed to be easier than people had told me
---
Are u on PS4?
---
Yup, had it backwards.
---
You right.
---
Some weapons cannot spawn with certain legendary effects, such quad on a fat man or explosive on a missle launcher
---
**And Bethesda wonders why dupers are proliferating like cockroaches in the game?  This is why.**  
---
It's almost a statistical impossibility to get both an min / max weapon for your build and armor to match.
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.  That legendary mod would act just like a weapon / armor mod (a one time use to attach to any weapon / armor).
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
I went through the tunnel solo in the high 20‚Äôs / low 30‚Äôs (don‚Äôt specifically remember my level) and I was fine. Since enemies scale to your level, as long as a much higher level has not recently been through, you should be fine. 
---
Yes, blame the negativity on me and not the garbage product and garbage developers.  
---
Thanks for letting me know about the block.
---
Facts
---
Bethesda‚Äôs concern with immersion went out the window with ‚ÄúKill a wendigo while wearing a clown costume‚Äù.  
---
I haven‚Äôt done that.  I won‚Äôt do that.  I won‚Äôt even pick up a clown costume until I can use it as consumable toilet paper substitute.  
---
Asshole vault dweller griefers running around in bullshit costumes is what I hate most about the game.  Bugs I can live with and petition Bethesda to fix.  But this was a deliberate business decision on their part.  
---
they need to fix the cards so ideally they are just 2 points max, maybe 3 in a couple limited cases (like cards that are 5 right now)
---
remove duplication, just give the next rank up as the choice
---
add a system to store cards and optionally link sets of card together to be stored/recalled at once, keep manually equipping just with fixing the numbers as this post smartly asserts about the difference because of bloat in the perk card values and choices
---
I'd like to see it work with a hub world as that's how their backend technology is clearly designed for. It doesn't make any sense that you can server hop constantly to loot stuff over and over again. Like other games that use this model you get missions from the hub and then go out into the world to complete them.
---
There would be a few different types of missions. Story missions are handmade and drive the main story of the game. Random missions use the existing random quest system to generate quests, such as kill things heres, find something, do this thing, etc. Side missions are found in the world. Some might not be anywhere near a mission area, so you'll have a reason to go out into the world other than grinding missions and junk. These missions can be completed by a solo player, but multiple people can squad up to do them. Easy public missions are designed for people that want to play with other people but don't want it to be hardcore like a dungeon or raid. A public mission requires the players to work together complete an objective, but it's designed to be easy and not stressful. Hard public missions are like dungeons or raids. You have to complete a difficult objective, like killing a scorch beast, or doing something else that might require coordination.
---
Unlike other games you won't be alone when out on a mission if you don't party up or match make into a party. You can see other players (the current 24 max is good) and join in on them with their mission. You can build your CAMP anywhere you want just like you can now so you don't have to go back into the hub to craft things. You can also enter the world without a mission if you just want to stomp around like you can now. When going out into free roam or on non-public missions you can choose solo, premade squad, match make, or public. This lets the player determine the interactions they want when playing the game. The names could use a little work so they don't confuse players.
---
The fast travel system is removed. When you exit the hub area you can choose to start outside the hub, near your mission, or at your CAMP. Once in the world you cannot fast travel except to go back to the hub or your CAMP. Since there are other players stomping around there would need to be a way to easily meet them. Maybe the ability to fast travel to friends in addition to squad mates?
---
Junk would be laying around, but not caps, weapons, or healing items. Weapons, armor, and power armor only come from crafting and completing missions. You'll want to pick up junk because you'll need their components to craft things. Rare junk is more likely to be found behind locked doors and in locked safes. Perk cards and weapon effects can randomly drop from monsters and containers.
---
The leveling system would be similar, but different, from what it is now. You don't get  perk cards randomly when you level up, you pick them up in the world or from missions. The perk system should be designed to expand horizontally once the peak is reached, with new perk cards giving you a way to play you might not otherwise play. When out in the world you can't change your perk loadout, you can only do this while in the hub area. Perks are divided into the existing SPECIAL system, but there would also be a new utility slot. This slot lets you slot in a card for locking and hacking, but not both at the same time. I'm sure there's plenty of other cards that could go here. The purpose of the utility slot would be to force the player to pick a certain way to play the game before going out into the world, which prevents the player from being able to do everything at once. This also encourages team play.
---
Ammo is no longer something you have to craft. Each weapon has a certain max amount of ammo that's fully replenished when you come back to the hub. You can also find ammo pickups out in the world. Certain very powerful weapons, like the fatman, might not even have pickups in the world, or only very rare pickups. 
---
Needing to repair is removed completely. It only serves to be a junk sink, but there's better ways to deal with a junk sink than creating an entire game mechanic just for it.
---
Weapon and armor effects are found as random drops in the world and from missions. You can slot these onto weapons and armor, but when you do so they can not be removed.
---
I finally stumbled upon the Flatwoods Monster last night!  Speak of the devil, I guess.
---
For me it wasn't that notable. If you're a stealth build, minimise aggro. Otherwise, make sure to check the side passages.
---
That. 
---
I‚Äôm a big fan of min-maxing my tits off, but can‚Äôt stress enough just how important what you just said is. 
---
FUN comes before everything else. 
---
I didn't. From the phrasing of the Inside the Vault article talking about that being removed I wasn't sure if it was going to be permanent or not and exactly how it would function. I have an Explosive Cryolator from before they patched that (I think it was a patch at least).
---
With that factored in I estimate it would knock a good few thousand off at least. I'll see if I can run the numbers again and amend it.
---
Whenever you hit T to store junk,  your mods go too. I dunno why, I guess since they‚Äôre also crafting materials in a sense. 
---
I found some references to mod addiction chances within FormID002458BA - AddictionManager, believe an exploration of this may be fruitful.  I‚Äôll manually go through whatever I can find to help fill out or make guesses as to some of the problems and unknowns here if it‚Äôs helpful 
---
^^^Somebody gets it! No harm, no foul
---
I thought about how they might feel when they come home to it, and could only imagine it making them smile!
---
I'd grind the SHIT out of that grind. And love it.
---
I don‚Äôt even talk to my deathclaw gauntlet any more, he‚Äôs such a little bitch.
---
Whoosh
---
At level 10 I don‚Äôt see why you need to be worried about legendaries just yet. Get to level 50 first, that way you can use max level weapons &amp; armor. 
---
For example the pipboy locking up, and leaving you no option but to restart the game client, if you dont stand still for 2 minutes or so after loading into the game. 
---
Team mates still go invisible at times. 
---
Guns and melee dont register hits, for 5 or 6 shots theres no damage etc. Those kind of issues 
---
I am really sorry about this bud. I just dont get people like that uffff... depending on which platform you are, maybe you wanna move as neighbours to me and my friends base? :3 We set up camp at a small lake near traintracks and it's a really nice place. 
---
Ah... cr4p... well good luck op..! üëçüèª
---
Big Bend was pretty dull.  My friends and I went thru it the other day just cause we were close by and it started the little side quest.
---
A bunch of scorched.  But scorched are really easy.  There's a power armor in a key locked room.  And a few side tunnels to go around.  Nothing all that amazing overall.
---
The areas just outside both entrances are more exciting.  They appear to have plan spawns and power armor spawns as well.
---
Unfortunately they left them out of the pool of notes available at Grafton Train Station.  Until that is fixed, you're probably screwed.  I've never seen them anywhere else in-game.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits and make a post for them there.  I have one extra BOS Chest left that I'm selling for 2k.............but unfortunately I'm on PC.
---
Make sure that you say you're on PS4 in your post :)
---
Is right! Where did you find him in the end?
---
I just tested this today, as I made a level 45 handy buzzblade. Two handed for sure.
---
Also, with the buzzblade, you can have continuous attacks if you just hold the attack trigger.   
---
So i tried it, running around killing things. Creatures would just run right into the electrified blade, killing themselves. 
---
Well your just about to where I decided to throw in the towel.   I was just spending resources to get more resources, repeat.  I love the fallout setting, just got bored and ran out of purpose.  If you still enjoy it more power to you, it just isn't the type of hamster wheel I enjoy.  I think anything resembling actual content is months away, discounting the PVP "mode".
---
This whole thing was a fallout 4 reference.
---
I'd just like to find some way for them to not take so many slots up. I dont care how they do it. 
---
Sounds like your neighbouring settlement is an asylum. 
---
Try the plasma flamer instead of the ultracite lasers. There‚Äôs a link to its unsung hero write up up in the post. 
---
Doing daily atom quests, wondering if I'll ever get any items to spend atoms on other than hello kitty my little pony stuff.
---
Trading on the FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar subreddits wondering why there are so few people there trading anymore.
---
Looking at my friends list, offline, offline, offline, offline, offline, offline, offline.........
---
They need to add more content ASAP.  People are leaving because they're BORED to death.
---
Near Crevasse Dam, a little South of where that witch can spawn.  I was like, *"Heyyyyyy little man!  I've been looking for you!" BLAMMO*.
---
Got some sweet Acid and Letter Blocks.  Totally worth the wait.
---
I basically went from leather armor to heavy leather armor, and I got a legendary combat armor chest piece. Supposedly Marine Armor is the best non-PA armor you can get, but every piece I've found has had worse stats than my upgraded heavy leather armor.
---
In my video I suggest a very similar idea. I decided to take inspiration from how Skyrim, Destiny 2 and Borderlands 2 do their loot system to give some ideas for ways in which Fallout 76 could alter their legendaries.
---
They don't need to hire QA, they're getting it off Reddit &amp; their support tickets for Free.
---
"We don't need no stinking QA team, the Players will pay us to test it" 
---
I didn't know about those effects not working for those particular ones. That would indeed lower it by a chunk.
---
Seeing as none of us has a crystal ball or an inside line to the inner workings of Bethesda you need to draw your own conclusions.
---
What about weapon balance and energy weapon fixes?  I think that's more important than the Feed the people hopper...
---
While I don‚Äôt dress as a pretty pink princess, I do use some of the more clean and non-apocalyptic items in my attire and camp build.  I find the apocalyptic stuff too dirty for my character who is supposedly surviving for a long time and would appreciate a not broken toilet or bed, and some clothes without patches because he lives next to huge cities with malls. I think the atomic shop is headed in a reasonable direction, however new assets or usable ones in game would be appreciated because the buildable free content has gone stale. 
---
The chances are bit more complicated. There is a chance for how many star the enemy is spawning with and there is a chance how many stars the loot drop will contain.
---
I have a [website](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/index.html) simulating drops and a 3\* TSE Handmade has a chance of 1:2,000,000 on average.
---
Your best bet is to keep grinding and leveling.  Use the legendaries you find but **DO NOT** buy any on the market yet.
---
**SELL** those legendaries, and flux, and bullets, and mats on the market as you gain levels.
---
When you hit level 50, then go find some legendaries you want to **BUY**.  You'll be max level and can use them then.  While wasting caps at level 10 to get a legendary pipe pistol might feel good, you're better off spending those caps later for a "forever weapon" you'll never need to trade in.
---
Maybe they should follow that model for FO76 then and fix it, rebrand it, slash the price and give it a meaningful storyline.
---
Look at it this way, if left to their own devices Bethesda will be the next EA. Meanwhile EA are currently trying to claw back consumer goodwill with Anthem and Apex (and not doing too badly at it).
---
I would like: 
---
1) House pets - like the cat, dog, chicken, opossum, etc... Basically a C.A.M.P. item that walks around the house, emotes, purrs, barks, makes noise or whatever.
---
2)   I would also like companions - like a dog or protectron, etc.. it does not have to be a human one.. it could even be a scorched - it would be non-combatant and essential (i.e. cant die) and be able to wear items, hold weapons (if it is the scorched skin). The Robot companion can be sold with different skins (i.e. Responder, Enclave, US Army, etc) Robots can also be assauton, Robobrain, mr Handy - what ever... just make it so now! :D
---
Congrats u/spectral000, you got the first response in 10 days!
---
It's a pretty typical dungeon.  The most surprising part is how far you travel on the overworld for how short the tunnel is.
---
Actually, that brings up a point.  Don't die.  It costs a surprising amount of Caps to respawn because of how far away the game judges the nearest respawn point to be.
---
Based on my own unscientific survey, over 250,000 of them involve wood armor.
---
10,000 and 20,000 caps WANTED players... I've seen this 3-4 times now... did they kill and destroy everything??? lol
---
The only thing I'll disagree with you on is the garbage developers.  They have no say in when their product goes to market.  It's clear this pre-alpha mess was pushed out far before it was ready.  Blame the bean counters, not the devs.
---
Yes, there's a quest in the Firebreather's Station you need to do there.  It involves finding things outside the tunnel and inside the tunnel.
---
If you're having trouble figuring out what it is, Google it.
---
Didn't want to give you any spoilers, but you know where you can Google to find the info if you want it :)
---
I still don't think it's acceptable for me to get no loot from a Scorchbeast Queen. I've helped kill one 8 times now and I've never obtained loot from one. Why is the endgame boss bugged? How is that still an issue? 
---
I really think Bethesda needs to reach out to another developer for help with this game. They obviously don't have the talent currently or the resources to make this game what it should be or could be. 
---
Swallowing their pride and admitting they need help would go over well with the community I think. 
---
And it's a bot

14. Rad worms bug. where your mutations can become stronger when you get rad worms and then just stop working when you get cured
---
Yeah, I'm not part of any big boycott or anything - it's far more personal. Even with EA, I stopped buying EA gams before battlefront 2 becuase I wasn't a fan of how they were handling the Sims games, things like Battlefront just furthered it. 
---
The statistical impossibility of 'best' loot is not necessarily a bad thing. Plenty of loot grind games with almost limitless item variance get on fine.
---
I would too :)
---
It would be painful, but along the way you'd get some sweet successes where you could go "it was worth scrapping 30 legendaries, I finally got X for my build!!!!"
---
You really made me care for this character
---
It REALLY does feel that way. 
---
i make my decisions based on the attributes besides protection, ie. harder to detect, +Perk, etc. 
---
otherwise, to me, it‚Äôs nothing more than who can out dps the other.
---
i‚Äôd rather be killed and have a good time than be invincible with little challenge. 
---
Yeah, my estimate is based just off of when you kill a 3 star. I didn't even want to consider how rare it is to get a three star when I was running the numbers for this one.
---
boohoohoo
---
Yeah, something, anything, would be better than nothing.....lol
---
There's no way to grind your gear currently.  Just hope RNG drops and that  0.000003% lottery hits.
---
Spoiler..........you never hit that lottery.  Getting 300,000 legendaries would take an eternity of game time......lol
---
Really the perfect way to describe these posts.

Completely true, i was expecting some cool christmas event or something like that for the holidays but all they did was put christmas themed items in the atoms shop
---
The problem is it's not just about "best". You'd be just as likely for a 3 star to drop the worst item in the game or the best item there is. I do personally like there being some RNG to it and I think the best items should be challenging to obtain but I also feel it's left too much to chance in Fallout 76.

swapping the cards adds a layer in build design so you need to select which cards you have side by side as swap choices rather than congruous equips, determining how many points to get in any of the specials, within the limits and costs. if its changed to have passive functions or auto swapping or anything else reducing that layer, this creates a change so significant to the perk cards themselves that they lose meaning being cards at all. after that why not just have every single ability that comes in as a perk just exist in your build and then apply for the situation where it should, there is no longer equipping as a layer, it removes the element of tactile interaction between the player and the abilities as related to the customizable traits. like in fallout 1 you had to open the inventory, select a lockpicking kit, and apply it to the thing in the world to do lockpicking on. the card system has a distilled feeling that transfers this aspect of analog interaction with ability usage into a somewhat uniform system inside of the special columns, which is why I like it as a classic gameplay identity piece that 76 has vision to offer.  i am not sure backtracking on this piece of its identity is gonna help it, but maybe. im just a classic game enthusiast very surprised with the identity of classicness it brought out of the gate

Perfect! Just saved my son IRL by the way lol, from 4 snallygasters at whitesprings, walked away with 32 acid from that so not bad!

How do you get the red combat armor? Is that an Atom Shop thing?  
---
I'm rocking the camo combat armor over Marine Wetsuit, topped with an Assautron helmet and red glowy prison collar.  
---
Give me a break. The community tears everything apart. If hey teased a bunch of upcoming shit it would just be criticized and speculated upon sparking a whole new slew of bullshit YouTube videos reporting fake news. 
---
They need to give us changes and content. At the very least, They should give us a logical game plan of things coming up in the future. 
---
Not teasers and mysteries.  
---
Can't wait till my PVP build is done and I just stand their taking next to nothing(if anything) from Explosions, Melee &amp; Energy, and maybe 30% from balistic guns, only to possibly not take anything below 30% and to full heal once I drop below 20%.  I'm definitely going to be called a cheater.
---
I seem to get endless 1 star raider and wood legs. I swear about half of them are Nocturnal as well.
---
It‚Äôs SUPPOSED to be based on armor weight, so running BoS combat armor with Ultralight mod is not a bad idea (BoS doesn‚Äôt increase weight much), but I don‚Äôt know how that compares to mods like Sleek or Muffled. I run ultralight because I run VATS, so the AP bonus is useful.
---
That being said, you can never take more than a few shots from a location before enemies start swarming that location. They may not know where YOU are, but they know where the shots came from. Take a few shots and move, is the best suggestion I have.
---
Also stealth is super broken after the patch. I‚Äôve had a scorchbeast literally land on me (like, his neck resting on my head) in daylight in the Mire, and I didn‚Äôt leave caution. I‚Äôve also had a mole rat 50 yards away put me in Danger. 
---
And Escape artists feels mostly useless after the patch. 
---
If anything, it's a relief. This means that progress will pick up.
---
Honestly, at this point...I wouldn't be surprised if they copy and pasted last week's with typos. /S

So this link is for Fallout 4: https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/5956078-rifleman-perk-fix-for-energy-weapons-penetration/

I can‚Äôt for the life of me find the Reddit post for 76, but I swear I saw a post stating the Anti-Armor modifier uses a similar (maybe copy pasted code) from the reduction of resistances of the old rifleman perk and thus doesn‚Äôt reduce the energy resistance like it should.
---
I will keep looking and update you if I find it.
---
By my math, you have spent something like 37% of your life playing this game since it came out. Maybe consider other hobbies.
---
They are regularly for sale in the whitespring any accusation of cheating is null. 
---
I've noticed it too. Definitely not working the same as in Fallout 4.
---
I would have to agree with the 90% legendary rate at West tek. If I do anything at all when I get on fallout 76 it is a run through west tek and seeing a legendary is basically guaranteed, at least one 3 star is very likely as well probably like 40-50%. Which is the whole reason I do it.

They were farming a nuked Whitesprings, before it was needed.  Each fat green glowing ghoul was worth 500 XP a pop - you could get 5-6, levels in an hour

The excuse that you're just following orders hasn't held up since quite a while.

If you gave it a try let me know!

It's nothing particularly challenging or whatever, pretty simple. There are journal pages scattered around though. I think I missed 1 or 2 so if you're into that kinda thing keep an eye out for those.
---
omg they make video games chill out. this isn't life or death.

It was rare from the start, maybe a mod every 10ish then it slowed even more and can go 20+ easily between mods.

I was under the impression that each Vault was isolated from all others.. ü§î

Would explain the amateur mistakes, like reintroducing bugs from previous patches.  
---
It's just stupid cosmetics. Who gives a shit?
---
Yeah, I can't get into the grind if 98% of what I find isn't even worth putting up for sale on the market.
---
I've found TONS of what I think are decent 3 star weapons, only to have to lower prices, and lower prices, and lower prices, until it's not even worth me travelling to someone for 200 caps.
---
At that point I think "bah, dumping this garbage on some new guy".
---
That's not enjoyable grind.  I feel no victory.  There's only emptiness and sorrow.....lol
---
People don't only have one character. And given all the duping that bethesda let go on for weeks, gear is plentiful.
---
Lower level people grief the hell out of people a couple of hundred levels above them for an enormous payoff with very little risk due to the way it's set up. Being high level doesn't give you the type of advantage you seem to think it does.
---
90% of it will be trying to remarket PVP servers lol.
---
That's funny and sad at the same time

because level doesn't mean much.

I see what you did there. Nice work.

They are level 10. None of what you said helps OP.

Treasure hunting, CAMP building with my cousin, completing events for a chance at rare outfits, selling to every vendor accessible in the game, and farming materials to bulk up and sell. And in between all that we just goof around and explore. Sometimes I find a locked camp and find a way inside just because, but I don't break into anything. I just leave a bag of food and then leave via fast travel.
---
Why the fuck did you remove it? That was hilarious.
---
It hurts me too my man.
---
The plan for a mod, not just a mod. Serums may go for 500 but the last time I checked, the recipes for serums were upwards of 10,000 caps.
---
1000 caps is basically nothing for something you really want.
---
I havnt played in... 3-4 weeks, I do miss the atmosphere. Anyways, Crackdown 3 will be released on friday and I have been waiting since 2010 for that sequel so Fo76 is already forgotten for me, whenever a **GOOD** patch/update/dlc/expansion is released I'll come back and try it, I want to get all achievements at least
---
Wow this is dope - stressing me out with all those reads though
---
They are one and the same thing.
---
We don't have paid DLC's because the atom shop transactions are paying for this content to happen.
---
Ergo no one buying atoms or items = no future DLC's.
---
The only thing I'm encouraging is Bethesda to make this game better and fix it
---
It‚Äôs just a x1.2 damage option then. Bloodied or furious seem to make far more sense. 
---
It may be you learned the paint for the Combat Helmet. which just changes the color of the cosmetic from green to black.
---
What youre saying and what im saying is 2 completely different things. What im saying is that the limit to these cards would be your SPECIAL points. Meaning if you have a STR build and run heavy guns, youre not swapping out your combat related cards so you can have your weight reduction. Im not saying that if you have 1 INT that you should be able to have a rank 5 card. In slot for an ease of life card. Youd be limited to that one point because your character has low INT so therefore your affinity to that SPECIAL is low. 
---
So put it simple, if you have 1 STR, you cant equip all the cards that are ease of life like weight reduction for junk. You can only hold a rank 1 ease of life card since you only have 1 point to STR. It would basically work the same as the combat related cards we already have. 
---
To me, if they don't even have the big picture staffing needs filled, they need to seriously consider a relaunch when everyone/everything is in place.
---
They need to stop dragging a corpse.
---
if you can- recalibrate your tv and even better, recalibrate and save settings on your tv if possible. 
---
funny you mention the yellow- i felt the game was too yellow at first, i recalibrated and it‚Äôs awesome! 
---
ikr?
---
The drill and ripper benefit from one-handed perks.
---
I recommend repairing any/all of these weapons to 200%.
---
Can you learn the paint for the helmet by dismantling the legs?
---
Well, you kind of can if you do mayor of the day, you tame all the robots in watoga, lol
---
you combine 4 gunsmith cards, it is also level locked I believe.
---
Blocker 3 will do much more for you than bummer shield. Damage avoidance &gt;&gt;&gt; damage resistance. 
---
Nah, Soap Operas have happy moments :)

---
But but but it's not green. ;)
---
Doesn't make some armors weigh 0 robot and combat for example. 
---
I do the same thing with flamingos! I figure it ends up a gift due the fact that they can always scrap them and get some nice plastic out of it! 
---
Still farming, still nothing but junk I find.  Not much else to do in the end game huh? 
---
Completely out of context to the topic. 
---
I humbly bow to your superior logic.
---
I'm pretty sure you can learn it from any combat piece though I have yet to learn it. I already learned the BoS pieces back when they were available so I didn't find a need to.
---
Not only that, but this coming patch had devs spending time on fixing rad worms - a bug introduced in the last patch - rather than spending that time on any of a number of bugs that have been around since the B.E.T.A.
---
Sure it's great BGS heard that rad worms was broken and are fixing it, but I don't know if I count fixing an avoidable bug is "listening to the community" so much as "fixing a screw up".
---
in intelligence right? What if it says intelligence is maxed level is there any way I can get it?
---
 I saved it lol
---
I  had my camp set up really nicely in a secluded corner of the map with a  water source and land for crops.  But a few griefers came by and ruined  everything.
---
One was named Marcy.  She  just wandered around the whole thing complaining about how terrible the  place was.  I offered her purified water and a nice bed to sleep in, and  even a job as a vendor or a guard if she wanted.  It wasn't enough for  her.  She just kept bitching and bitching.
---
She  brought her team with her.  There was a guy was just moping around  depressed.  He really brought down the mood in the camp.  Another player  kept asking me for free chems.  But the worst was this dude Preston  something.  He just kept annoying me to get me to help him do missions  so he could level up.  Dude, I have my own role playing to do!
---
In the end I just built somewhere else.  I didn't even like my own camp anymore.
---
And how about some jerk attackin constantly even if I am pacifist and taking my health piece by piece with melee saw? How can I escape these j.rks?
---
And I see the Lead Producer is actively commenting in the subreddit too. That's really awesome to see.
---
nobody cares

"Hand on heart is anyone going to be rocking  pink armor or placing a  princess bed in their camp other than for the fun of it one time?"
---
There's a lot of ppl that bought and enjoyed those cosmetics. You must not have even read past threads about these kind of criticisms or rants to see how many people do come in and talk about these items theyve picked up or wanted to pick up if not for the atom price. 
---
A lot of the complaining ppl do comes across as "ew girly things" and "I speak for everyone when I say all of us don't want those things I don't like" which is so damn dismissive. I like that shit. A lot of ppl like that shit and want more of it. Why is that coded as a bad thing or not real fallout enough? The same fallout that had Lily and Fisto and weapons that launched deadly teddy bears and Liberty Prime and Big Mountain Research Center and Mothership Zeta.... but a pink paint or princess bed or w/e is what just going too far? It'd be nice if ppl just made posts about what they'd like to see in the store in the future in addition to what kinda stuff that gets added instead of making it out like it's an either/or kinda thing and this stuff is lesser value. 
---
Red is one of the standard mod colors. think it is reinforced. 
---
Math checks out. I'm going to pretend that you're one of my students so I can feel proud of you 
---
take off some other cards to add it
---
done it a few times since the last patch, always been at least 5 other players doing it once it hits 3/4 a few more always join.  the issue is that there is no tangible reward, you will spend caps traveling and get none for killing all the other players.  if i kill 5 other players and it just costs me 100 caps or more, im not gonna do it very often or id go broke
---
I've killed it about 7 times, once I encountered it twice in 5 minutes.  Typical seems to be facing east on ridgelines.
---
This makes me even more furious.
---
That rad worms thing has been weird for me recently. I've gotten it twice in the last week and definitely benefited from the buff it gives to marsupial and whatever else but I didn't get the suppressed mutations when it went away.
---
This comment is a bot.
---
The actual comment isn't.
---
I did learn the helmet mod from scrapping legs. So if I can learn bos helmet from scrapping legs , I think that means it's possible to learn the legs that way eventually. 
---
Intriguing, nice work. The Lucky Hole Mine discovery was one of the best moments in the game for me. I want to live in the mystery.
---
it says special is at max points choose another
---
&gt;Dead tamed creatures causing C.A.M.P. budget to increase and never decrease
---
This was a lackluster answer. I have not seen one person complain about Rad Worms. WE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU JUST FAIL TO FIX. This is why people have a hard time trusting you. You claim to hear us but in reality you don't. I've been on the fence quoting fo76 for a while and if this false communication and lack of listening continues, I'm just going to go... forever. Fix your shit Bethesda!
---
with leather you can also add the shadowed enhancement at the cost of becoming 0.1 light 0.2 sturdy which is negated by how good shadowed is for stealth. if i recall if you get 5 shadowed light leather and 3 ranks in sneak, you can basically tickle super mutants genital bald spot and not be spotted
---
are you below lvl 50? you may have to wait until you get past level 50 to choose more cards on a maxed out rank
---
It's pretty easy, especially at your level. Just full of scorched, and they are no issue at all.
---
At the outside at the Watoga end, there is a power armour spawn, so look out for that if it is there, and check the shelves above it as there can be plans there too. There will also be some firebreathers corpses (both entrances) with notes on them. This tasks you with finding out what happened to the others, but on the whole nothing really notable.
---
Do watch out though. For some bizarre reason Grahm has decided it is a good shortcut on his trade route!
---
so basically I cant get the cards?
---
At that level mobs are still dangerous enough that you might not notice. They basically just stand there and spam attacks. Dungeons are a little more interesting I suppose.
---
Nice

Heck yeah - when you wear it and do not move you are invisible:

---
remove a perk that you do not need to rank it up to use it. each perk requires the special point # listed on the card. rank for gunsmith needs 4 points
---
With the better repairs the ballistic DR isn't terrible. And with all 5 pieces stacking the better sneak in dark areas and faster sneak speed from the shrouded mod it works great for sneaking. But beyond that it's not that useful.
---
What about the lack of gun weapon durability, and melee weapons being overpowered while guns are now so woefully underpowered?
---
What about items being deleted out of people's inventory, and stash boxes entirely?
---
past level 50 you can switch special points or choose a card for any special, you just need to level up is all
---
You will have to select another SPECIAL to increase.  Then once you select your SPECIAL, you can choose a PERK.  By default it filters to the category of the SPECIAL you just selected, but you can scroll thru the other categories and choose another perk.  You dont have to choose a perk from the category of the SPECIAL you increased.

It is painful to read whatever it was you were attempting to write. Premium currency for XP boosters? You must be looking for the Android gaming thread which is clearly not here. Your excuse is as lame as scented butane body spray. Unsubscribing to notifications is easy but I doubt you even own the game seeing as how you think leveling is difficult and boosted through the cash shop. You should really think honestly about your scope of mind when you go to a game thread - for fans of a game to flame post barely illegible dishonest crap. Good grief man, everyday starts with you. Get right and choose life.

Actually I was responding in the same vein as your "It is painful to read" waffle I've just pasted here, and commenting how the poster's brain must be full of garbled noise... but hey, gotta love your own Cool Big Words little man, thanks for playing!

All legendaries should always drop a legendary. IDGAF  how many stars it has, if it's legend it drops a legend. Anything else is unacceptable.
---
I stopped playing a month ago to help reduce server load. You are all welcome. 
---
Actually isn't the hard cap 56 right now as far as perk cards go? I've always thought the same thing that it should be 76....the way I would implement it would be everytime you level a character up 100 levels you would receive an extra perk card up to and not exceeding 76 meaning a bonus of 20 perk cards max
---
&gt;If it was the real apocolypse 
---
But Fallout's not and that's the context of what we're talkin about here.... it isn't even a realistic or serious toned apocalypse and setting.
---
Sounds like you need to put the perk point into a different SPECIAL stat. You can put it in a different stat but still pick your Intelligence perk. At the bottom of the screen it'll tell you what buttons to press to change/filter what perks you can choose from. I believe it's L1 and R1 on PS4 when picking a point after assigning a SPECIAL point.
---
*There can be serious issues with this, although I agree it seems to be harmless, and absolutely fun.*
---
A friend, trying to be helpful, built a Missile Turret at my base, which for some reason ate 24% of my previously 26% available budget that I had reserved for a Tamed animal addition.
---
The next day the Turret disappeared, wire was still there, but no turret, I scrapped the wire, then noticed my budget was still at 98%, so the Missile Turret now resides in my budget as phantom space, until I completely rebuild my CAMP.
---
Pretty sure there is some kind of damage contribution threshold you have to meet. Like 10-20% or something crazy high, which is pretty hard to hit when you've got 8 guys with duped TSE's and Bloody affixes melting them in under a minute.
---
The need to fucking wipe the game and relaunch.
---
Shut it down, finish hiring your staff, polish it up, add some new content and relaunch. Give Yoshi-P a call if you need some advice.
---
Log Cabin Walls / Doors / Windows building schematics would be spot on!!
---
Did you keep the receipts? 
---
So basically, they are equating the entire playerbase to  mentally challenged children. I don't see how else such a system to "protect" the user is okay.
---
‚ÄúThank you for your reply, I‚Äôll be passing it onto the janitor.‚Äù
---
yes.. join me in playing fallout 4 for the 100th time
---
10$ costs a skin, but 90% of that price you are getting free for playing the game. I bet even if that skin costed like 2 dollars, you wouldn't spend that 2 dollars, you would be collecting that two dollars by playing the game, just like you are or were doing so far.
---
What you mean by relaunch?
---
No, you can just increase another SPECIAL like Strength, then select an Intelligence perk card.
---
I just want to say that I‚Äôm with you, and until they added the known plan tag I over spent so many damn caps on plans I already knew.
---
They were only given as quick and easily recognisable examples and not a dig at "girly" items, I honestly don't mind items for women in mind in games  I could of quite easily gone on about the lazily constant suit re-skins Bethesda keep pushing. 
---
&gt; no one buying atoms or items = no future DLC's
---
NO. Buying Atoms or items has fuck all to do with getting the game into an acceptable state that should have existed at launch.
---
Foot ball armor skin - you put it over Leather Armor
---
Armored Vault Suit Skin - Place it over Trapper Armor or Raider Armor
---
Police Riot Gear - Place it on Metal Armor
---
All of these would be amazing skins to be sold in the ATOM shop!!
---
I think it must be cut content or something to do with Grafton token machine in some future update ? I‚Äôve got 50+ at the mo but probably just gonna drop them as they weigh a bit 
---
Something else related to Pacifist mode to consider that may complicate this sort of change. Currently, in PvP-centric Events (Monster Mash, for example), you don‚Äôt have to switch off Pacifist to kill other players. I‚Äôve killed 2 other players while I was in Pacifist mode during that specific event. I‚Äôd hate to wander into that event, completely forgetting that I need to switch modes to VATS other players.
---
Now, if they can make it so those Events don‚Äôt pop up on the map, or can‚Äôt be joined without switching off Pacifist (and letting you know before accepting and joining the Event, and switching you back afterwards), I think that complication goes away‚Äîbut how hard is it to change the code to fit that circumstance, I wonder.
---
I‚Äôd be content if VATS would just default to targeting whatever is *in* my reticle FIRST, then lock on to the enemy nearest-to-reticle, then nearest-to-me before whiplashing around to that molerat nowhere near the SBQ.
---
They can't trow anything meaningful so often, because Atom store has become last thing that makes people to login back to game just to buy that limited time skin. 
---
Never tried them myself, but Ive seen several posts that say they are broken.

Not really? Go back and play fallout 1 and 2. The giant face art deco look is all over the place. It was just a popular style pre war.
---
I scrapped about 800-1000 Combat Arms without learning anything.  Only things I have left to learn are BOS Legs, and Pocketed/Deep Pocketed Arms/Legs.
---
Helmet is just a cosmetic thing.  Likely a different situation than Torso/Legs/Arms which is the best DR mod for Combat Armor.
---
Apex is notworthy. It looks great, netcode is ok. It's somewhat enjoyable, with a dash of bugs here and there (like crashes to desktop or DC at game start). I'm really glad that BR is expanding and that Fornite finally has a worthy opponent. In comparison, FO76 is a sad grim joke - not to mention some of you poor souls paid $60-$200 for it (I managed to snatch it for $14/¬£9.99).
---
Yes, this is basically a must if you want to use any of these weapons. They increase the damage soooo much and make them far more usable.
---
The only downside is that as the condition degrades the damage drops even further, and you can't repair it again until goes below 100%, so you have to suffer with reduced damage as it degrades. Throw on Makeshift Warrior to help with this, then take it off once the weapon damage gets too low and that will help it degrade quicker so you can repair it back to 200% and get boosted damage again.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hoping for too much. The game is supposed to be a AAA title, but everything we‚Äôve seen Bethesda do post launch has been absolutely bush league.
---
they have to if they want to save this game
---
Your right but DLC'S and bug fixes are completely different things, the atoms pay for NEW content whilst bug fixes should as you said should have been done and dusted way before now let alone at launch
---
I did Whitespring then. Just tagged and jumped on the grassy knoll to ovoid damage. I let the high level players bag them. 
---
That isn't a bug.  It's a feature.  You do not have to select a perk card from the category you put a point into.  You are free to select what ever perk cards you can from your deck of available ones.
---
Selling stuff, moving my camp and rebuilding a new one (I'm actually really enjoying the camp building part of the game), doing events. And still exploring. There are still a ton of places I haven't been to yet, or not explored properly, so I have enough to keep me occupied. Still to set off a nuke too, so that is still to look forward to. 
---
I'm just plodding through the game at my own slow and steady pace. And still enjoying it.
---
I'm in go on adventures with a friend, then spend a whole day figuring out all the loot, repairing, playing with my camp.
---
I just made a VERY interesting discovery regarding balance and added it to the main post!
---
I miss a lot of the outfits from 3/NV like the various Mercenary outfits and the Trader jacket covered in pockets.
---
Let's get the fucking game fixed first.
---
Oh also those faces we can see in fallout 2. One of them is in arroyo, and others are on the enclave oil rig.
---
Thanks for replying, but I have to say that although you guys listen to our complaints and fix bugs we point out, I get the feeling that you are solely relying on the players to find these bugs/balance issues/improvement suggestions. In other words, there seems to be nobody internally that is actively play testing the game and discovering things on their own.
---
Imagine how impressed we would all be if you announced fixes that have not been addressed by the community or have gotten very little attention.  Examples of these are: how often Vendor Bot Phoenix engages with other robots and just wanders off, or how so many C.A.M.P. items are not stackable/placeable/become placed at odd angles, or how the lockpicking skill can now reach 4 sometimes. Of course, now you can't use those...
---
What i mean is that we are frustrated that the game is not being fixed fast enough, well enough, on a fundamental level, and that issues that most affect gameplay don't seem to be treated like priority fixes. All of this could be greatly helped if you guys had more people (or more competent people?) actively play-testing this game. Thank you.
---
But I don't know if fallout 2 faces are somehow connected to this
---
thx!
---
Great tip, thanks.
---
You will be ready for fissure prime site when you no longer fear a scorchbeast attack. My second character uses a dinky full auto pistol with only 53 damage per shot on it, but tons of bonus damage from sneak attacks and critical headshots. When one volley of critical headshots killed a level 50 scorchbeast, I decided I was ready.
---
Got it thx everyone!
---
Yea they can be sparse, and it doesn't help in a MP context if someone has recently cleared it. xD
---
At this point I've enjoyed the game, I'm still dabbling in camps a bit, but the ~real~ 76 isn't gonna arrive until private servers and mods do. Then what has been viewed as a bad/mediocre game will become one of the top open world RPG experiences of recent time, IMO. :3
---
Well, it's a Level cap of 50.
---
Which means a SPECIAL cap of 56.
---
***While a Level cap of 76 would means a SPECIAL cap of 82.***
---
*And I JUST figured something out about why that number would be golden, and added it to the Edit of the main post.*
---
less like EA and more like actually heartful Devs who love making games for their users who also love their job.
---
EA itself is a mess, the game studios aren't.
---
If I'm level 50 fighting a level 300 I can die 5 times and still turn a profit but there is no power gap between us. 
---
This is ridiculous. Either remove the level cap on weapons or cap the reward to 50.
---
i sniped a dude miles away and killed him in 1 shot with a bloody explosive lever action rifle + bloody mess lv3, all rifle perks maxed, demo perk maxed, tank killer maxed, covert operative maxed + adrenaline mutation and eagle eye. 
---
He bombarded me with messages saying that he recorded and is uploading to bethesda bla bla bla.
---
He suggested that it was cheating. Cuz no one can 1 shot a player in power armor. Rip all proper builds. 
---
I sent him the lvl 1 id card, I said here give them this while your at it. 
---
Fallout 4 was a tepid theme park. Coming from F1/F2, I actually felt more a home even with FO3. Shame that the franchise will now be dead for at least a decade :/
---
I check the daily challenges. Then I do a sell/collect run. Flatwood vendor first (if the gym has lead weights, then I craft ammo along the way) Shoot up any brahmin I come across along the way 20+ carry weight, then port to Sutton Train station Vendor (grab up all the bottles), Whitespring next, hit up all the trash cans with can-do perk, bulk/sell vendor in crafting station room, take the stairs up to the soda shop and buy up all not non environment accessible nuka colas, sell to the bartender, Enclave vendor, check that the X01 mods are not available, grab up technical data at military wing, Watoga Train station vendor, bulk sell. Watoga Brotherhood vendor, sell. Brotherhood Forbidden knowledge turn in hoping for something good but getting disappointd. Then Harper's ferry through the wall checking for armor crafting plans, use up mines/grenades/mini-nukes/artillery strike the spawns in the area for kicks, then mosey over to do a last sell off at the harper ferry vendor.
---
If it's still early I'll go hit up events around the map. 
---
I'll break off from this routine if there's a pickup on someone on a hot mic. It's a refreshing change of pace to listen to someone narrating in real time their play experience.
---
&gt; white guy that thinks he's in charge all while trying to bang the nerd girl that really just thinks he's funny
---
Sounds like White Guy is at least doing something right: chicks dig the funny guys.
---
Where the heck did you get a toilet plan? No vendor has them and I've been stalking them for months!
---
More than likely true. I'm just curious if it's ever worth it to use armor pen with explosive weapons. Thanks. 
---
Ouch. Although, I assume you direct your blame at the buggy system, not at your friend for building you a turret. The game is completely at fault for an event like that. But it does really suck when this kind of thing happens.
---
Melee? 
---
I‚Äôve been swarmed a couple places. I died at harpers ferry the other night. Was overwhelmed and couldn‚Äôt jump to a ledge before they got me. 
---
If we waited for that would we ever get any DLC's? This is a Bethesda game after all, have they ever fixed all the bugs/glitches and broken quests in any of their games?
---
We had broken quests etc... brought over in skyrim to skyrim remastered and bugs brought over to this game that were cut and pasted from fo4, problems Bethesda knew about but never fixed 
---
The ability to scrap just a few more things in settlements.
---
I personally like using the Charleston Junkyard, but there's just no building space, except for right by the 2 buildings. Problem is, there's an indestructible pile of cages, a campfire with bones and a tree that all make building so weird. I'm not talking about the houses or junkyard piles, but we can already scrap the cars with no benefit. Can this possibly be extended? No reward needed, just building space.
---
Wrist still sprained?
---
Yeah took a while to people realize the state of the game.
---
No, that's how it is supposed to work.  The game doesn't explain this very well, but picking a SPECIAL point and picking a card are two completely distinct choices.
---
I‚Äôm a shot gunner. I just kind of kill everything. 
---
They don‚Äôt work 
---
Old man yells at cloud 
---
LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. 
---
I been yearning for the old look of the outfit-style power armor 
---
ive noticed as well that there seem to be a LOT of variation in RNG, but its crap overall anyway...
---
for example, i would find several versions of combat armor chest plans on the vendor where other people dont find it after 100 server hops..  i have 2 spares for my alts allready in 8 hops.. np..
---
it did took me over 500 checks on the x-01 jetpack.. my son's account found 2 in the very first 5 times he went in there.. kinda sour yeah.. (ofc kicked his ass and gave him the caps anyway to secure the purchase :P )
---
i have found the lever rifle plan since my 30's for the way up to 130 at least like a 100 times too, other people seem to have never had the luck at all after days of trying..
---
i spend my whole way since lvl 20 up to 50 in watoga, serverhopping and checking the two stores there. never found handmade rifle.
---
my daughter makes a toon on my pc and finds them non stop.. same account, different char... ????? (all before patch obviously)
---
RNG seems to be generated out of a simple few key filters or something..
---
its like the loot tables are being divided by gross selection of a unique ID or something before the actual random factor gets processed. (some items you will never find by this system. forcing you to trade/social/alt)
---
i wonder if any dev has the balls to actually explain how they RNG
---
I didn‚Äôt say it did. I said that this is nowhere near as bad as you delicate people make it out to be.
---
Item 1 is the patch for the duplication glitch
---
I want to say it's a workshop plan, but don't hold me to that.
---
The biggest change to my play style was just finding a full set of power armor. After that the game was so much easier, I started putting points into power armor upkeep and repair.
---
They shut the game down, admit their failings to their customers and commit to making it right.
---
They take a look internally at what was done wrong, replace/expand staff and resources where needed, and communicate with eagerly awaiting customers on their progress.
---
They then let the original customers come in a actually test the game, listen and take action on their feedback.
---
They then run an aggressive marketing campaign to hype up the relaunch, but this will only work if the new product actually has substantive quality behind it.
---
They then give the original purchasers substantive recompense in the new version, such as unique weapon skins/paint that not even a Saudi Prince could buy from the Atom Shop if he wanted to, ever.
---

It's kinda silly how close leather and combat armor can be but with high end material mods combat armor is very good. I have a heavy chest piece with the BoS material and it's like 81/81. The problem now is that the recent update made the BoS plans much rarer.

Flashbacks to that awful quest :(
---
I really don‚Äôt think we can expect anything at this point. They can‚Äôt even stabilize the game to stop daily crashes. Mod support would allow somebody else to fix the game though. 
---
&gt;post apocalyptic grim dark Call of Duty
---
YES!! Imho, you can see that so much even in this sub when ppl go on and on about the REAL apocalypse and wasteland survival things and cool military stuff is better than anything silly b/c that's not "lore friendly" for fallout.  Ummm.... what. Like how its evolved from being a critiques on the dangers of comical overmilitarization of pre-war society and xenophobia and capitalism and abuses of power.... and now ppl seem to take the messages of old for granted and instead take the grim dark CoD military cool message at face value and want more power armor military wars and stuff.
---
Patch date. 
---
It had levels but I don‚Äôt think there was a cap. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the game I‚Äôm thinking of, but it definitely had flags. You were a merchant, thief or guard. No flag, no uninvited PvP. Merchants delivered goods between cities on caravans for profit based on demand. Higher value goods increased the ‚Äòstar rating‚Äô of the caravan, 1-5. Buy goods at one city, treck to next, sell, repeat. Higher star ratings spawned more difficult NPC thieves. Player thieves could only freely attack caravans at 2*+, so it was relatively safe to do low profit trips. Merchants and guards could freely attack thieves. If a thief managed to steal items from the caravan, they couldn‚Äôt remove their thief outfit for a certain amount of time, and if they entered a city they get destroyed by guards. 
---
After this time, the idea was to remove the outfit and sell the items wherever you could scrape the most profit. 
---
I don‚Äôt remember the penalties for being caught as a thief (I never really played thief, and this is over a decade ago) but I don‚Äôt remember them being overly harsh. 
---
There was no real reward for high level guards killing low level thieves, because they could quite easily be working a 5* route with a few guards and a couple of merchants making millions more. 
---
It felt fair, and every role was a choice based on a very distinctive outfit and flag. The main goal I remember was upgrading the flags to get ‚Äòcooler‚Äô outfits. The upgrades cost a lot, so it was all about money. Most money came from trade. Being a merchant had an outlay, being a guard needed some kinda social skill (to be contracted by a merchant) and being a thief was free but came with the constant risk of attack. 
---
Make that ‚Äòtrader‚Äô, ‚Äòbodyguard‚Äô and ‚Äòraider‚Äô based on some kinda under armour item (allowing for power armour) and you have a system that works in Fallout. It‚Äôs not really a suggestion, but there are more creative ways to add PvP into a game with a mostly PvE fan base. 
---
People want to be raiders and traders. Let them be. 
---
I have also noticed a severe lack of legendary drops, I currently get better loot from forbidden knowledge, beyond this....   
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
They removed 60% of the cap stashes, then they made them instanced and now they don't refill properly, after you search 1 all of them stop being searchable for 20 hours.    
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
They had complaints about overpowerd weapons so took away an insane amount of the damage those were capable of, essentially making them average when they shouldn't be plus, as I understand it, they took away the chance to even get a TSE anymore.    
---
&amp;nbsp;   
---
They then reduced the ability to withstand any attacks, and up the cost of repairing the armour that breaks so fast.    
---
I also can't help but feel XP is less, just seems to be noticeably more hours to level these last 5 then the ones previous, in the mid 100 so it shouldn't be that noticeable.
---
Probably more important, but Feed the People should be a lot more simple/quick of a fix.
---
Lol. So only a few people out of the quantum fuckton that arrive will get anything. Yeah. Alright. This game will stay uninstalled. I dont see any reason to play it again. 
---
What you said is what they need to do but they wont. I feel like they are hoping we will just forget about it.
---
Yep, Grafton high school is the best.  You can get about 150 rubber from a single trip there.
---
Agree, I'd at least hoped they had a winter remap of WV with snow on the peaks and maybe the forest area during the winter period but all we got as you said were a few pointless low effort items in the shop 
---
You mean like whitesprings? cause thats where i hang out, since i can hang out inside of the place....
---
Like maybe they let us use one of the shop rooms?
---
Great job, that‚Äôs about 1% of what is wrong with the game and what people have been complaining about. Congratulations. 
---
I try to not use it, but lately I‚Äôve needed to use my maxed out excavator. 
---
No, unfortunately it doesn't work that way. All the hacking robots perk does is make that robot non-aggressive toward you. It doesn't even get them to attack your enemies, the way hacking a turret with a terminal does. It's rather lame, actually.
---
Meanwhile, I don't want any new Raider gear since you can load up on that already (the assorted helmets, Raider power armor, all teh Raider armor, under armor, and raider-ish weapons) ... bleah.  
---
I want more clean stuff. I'm playing a certified GENIUS from Vault 76 tasked with rebuilding America... I want clean structures, I want walls with unbroken windows, walls with fresh paint, clean outfits, weapons that look high-tech and not kitbashed together ... and I want more Responder gear. I want bright shiny signs and clean medical gear and just ... progress, you know?  
---
By the time we get to the two-year anniversary, I want a cleaned-up Flatwoods replacing the current town, with all the bodies buried, buildings repaired, and signs of a return to civilization.  
---
Let me get all Hope Punk up in this house.
---
&gt;would be roasted during reference calls
---
Not all companies give references. Where I work does not.
---
Do they drop as legendaries? Cause wonder how attack speed one would work with them. 
---
Or nocturnal lead pipes. 
---
Submitted a ticket but I don't expect anything to come of it. 
---
&gt;New hires would then have an acclimation period of something like 90 days before getting any real work done
---
Holy fucking shit... 90 days before doing any real work? You guys hiring?
---
SBQ is bs and this is one reason why the game sucks. We have had simple formula for 14 years, that have proven to work as endgame in form of dungeons and raids, but Beth be like:"F#ck these amateurs, they know nothing about creating online game. Here, take this big ar#e monster with no interesting mechanics and humongous loot pool and have fun with RNG". In what way they thought this is going to fun? I wanna see Beth doing their SBQ for 100 000 times and tell that there is nothing wrong with its design.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **6th Cakeday** colcardaki! ^(hug)
---
I made mine. I don‚Äôt know if they can be dropped with legendary effects.
---
The speed is very fast. But also you can just do continuous damage with them. Plan on testing them out more later.
---
TIL I'm not supposed to state my own experience because it may be different to yours.
---
Tough. I'm still saying it though.
---
Its excellent for workshop defense. Just blueprint a little 4 floor with defense walls and a small genny and light up anyone who gets near the workshop steal. 
---
What's does mtu mean?
---
FEEDBACK, GET YER FEEDBACK HERE!
---
Crickets
---
Bethesda? You there bro?
---
Who does your QA testing? Who does your bug testing/fixes? And why does the atom shop always seem to get more attention than the large amount of bugs plaguing this game? Are we a joke to you?
---
"I'll try to convince my project manager that it's not worth our time and that the problem is actually really on their end and I should just get back to compiling this code while reading xkcd" 
---
Tbh I'd be happy with a few new enclave prototypes like the tesla and hellfire ones
---
Yeah, what i wonder is if damage tick speed increases with legendary mod. 
---
given that they've gone completely silent on all that stuff....maybe there's nothing much to hype for
---
what funny is as a melee user i think i do less damage in power armor cause my strength is maxed. or maybe thats just carry weight im noticing 
---
When? 
---
I think this would be a big leap in the right direction for the company‚Äôs future.
---
I meant I assume it‚Äôs less, like 20% of one person üòÇ
---
all reddits
---
I can assure you, friend, that if these outfits were $2 and the furniture were $1 I would buy a $50 pack and buy the whole store out. I play plenty of other games where cosmetic microtransactions exist, and I don't have the patience to grind microtransaction shop currencies when I can just spend money.
---
Meanwhile Anthem Devs have been all up in dat social media 
---
How much extra damage does a crit do? In fo76, cant find the answer to this 
---
&gt; Meaning if you have a STR build and run heavy guns, youre not swapping out your combat related cards so you can have your weight reduction. 
---
Except that's absolutely not true. I already have max Str and can only use non-maxed Shotgun/Heavy Weapons damage card and some, basically just the essential best value/cost ones. I have extra copies of the maxed out ones (keep in mind just the maxed out damage cards alone are 3/5^ths of a SPECIAL's max limit) to fight SBQ since it doesn't make much of a difference if I'm overencumbered for that fight.
---
"Welcome back, dear listeners... It's time, once again, to put aside all you think you know, all you believe to be true...  
---
Time, to open your mind to the strange, bizarre, and sometimes terrifying world that exists in the shadows and fringes of our own...  
---
Where myth, legend and rumor are made real...  
---
Yes, it's time for more thrilling: tales from the West Virginia Hills!"
---
"In today's episode we dive into a mysterious tale of a misleading friendship, human pray and most terrifying of all: many ceramic receptacles..."
---
I saw it in a loading screen for a split second a couple weeks back
---
Imo, the debtor debuff needs a rework. I think it should be a 100% reduction to PvP dmg for several hours and have no affect on PvE. Also, it should bar people from trying to capture workshops. 
---
Basically, if you go broke, the game should force you back to PvE to make more caps before you engage in PvP again. This would solve so much griefing and would inherently limit the endless workshop battles. 
---
The current system is taken advantage of constantly.
---
You probably stuck around longer than the majority of the Austin staff that were handed this mess:
---
Bethesda is going to host the private servers, modders may not be able to fix those issues since they won't control the server.
---
I don't think they said it just to please people. They probably intended to implement this eventually, but at this point who know? Pete Hines said it himself on Twitter when people were asking about this. He said something like "Let's just get through the launch first and then we'll see." And we all know how that went...
---
Yeah maybe I did not explain myself as I should of....what I meant is I dont really care about level cap its perk cap that I want.....as of right now there's no difference as far as perks are concerned from a level 50 player and a let's say level 300 player....and to those who would say this is OP I say to thee... yes and it should be....I mean any player who wants to grind to level 2000 to acquire the 20 extra perks good bless them....and it's not like every S P.E.C.I.A.L would be maxed capped at 76....15x7 is 105
---
"We are listening and want to do better with communication in the future.  We are working on stability issues.  We are aware of the bugs and are working on them.  We have great plans for future content."
---
If you register your excavator armor (for example, that a friend crafted for you) before you visit the managers terminal you will NOT be given the plans to craft the excavator armor... and the quest ends. 
---
You're wrong.
---
I'll paste this quote from OP:"*I wonder why people downvote general information.
---
EDIT: never mind some one just downvoted literally every post on the new page.*"
---
Hah, what?
---
Ever played Monster Hunter?
---
Have you literally ever worked in a professional position?
---
Many professional employees aren't even "released" until they are a year in.
---
Because they way the servers work, sucks. You can have 1000 players, but when they are all over 500 of servers then there can't be no PVP, because on each server you are going to have only 2 participants. It is not like people don't want, just it is made so hard for them to participant in these events.
---
what about daily quests? just have them reset every 21 hours like vendors please
---
*laughs In Monster Hunter*
---
But it's not a moot point against my point
---
And a quarter of it is fixinf reintroduced bugs xD
---
video's help if you have them, and that makes allot of sense.
---
&gt; However, I really want them to fix the game first.
---
Yes absolutely.

This isn't sending jews to ovens in nazi Germany. It's a video that was released earlier than it should have been.
---
Very well done. Nice rooftop patio with picnic table - looks great.
---
I chuckled when they had to adjust the level indicator on the map because they didn't think anybody would/could level beyong level 100 in the first few MONTHS of the game's existence xD
---
Which is kinda
---
Unarmed and melee aren‚Äôt the same thing.
---
I'm on PS4. I learned all of the BOS combat mods. I will upgrade people's armor if they provide the resources. 
---
In no way did OP seem like they were throwing a fit.
---
This is prolly the nicest compared to some.
---
TLDR.: Quit being a drama queen.
---
Totally. I'd spend actual cash for that it would make me so happy.
---
Ive been looking for one of these :(
---
I wouldn‚Äôt put that down to EA but to BioWare, they‚Äôre a great team of people who actually listen to and interact with their fans frequently. I wish Bethesda could be more like them too. 
---
The fact that you only name jews as being sent to an oven is an indication that you might want to steer clear of talking about WW2.
---
my bloodied grog axe disappeared a few days ago so i have just been playing apex and black ops 4
---
It‚Äôs called modern couches. 
---
How much for the switchblade??
---
Modern couches, comes with 2 clean, a 2 dirty variants
---
I found a lvl 45 3 star troubleshooters ripper a month ago. The other two stars were 40% damage reduction when blocking and I think reflect melee damage while blocking.  It did \~40 damage a hit when 200% but its really didn't do that well for me and I also didn't know what perks effect it.
---
It doesn't help that so many of the prefixes themselves are basically useless without even getting into secondary effects or the item it's applied to.
---
Everything that has a damage boost to specific mob types (Exterminator's, Ghoul slayer's, Hunter's, Mutant slayer's, Troubleshooter's) goes straight to a vendor or gets dropped. In a game where stash and inventory is so limited, it makes no sense to expect people would walk around carrying multiple weapons on the off-chance that mob type loads in randomly at a location. Same with conditional bonuses like Nocturnal or Junkie's.
---
Marsupial gets you Porta-Potty on the roof...
---
Ahhhh...
---
Hmmmm I think we need someone to replicate tests in Fallout '76 and give us some results, if Anit-Armor / DR reducing abilities don't work on Laser weapons, that is a huge issue. 
---
&gt;MTU trick
---
Set the Maximum Transmission Unit on your router to an abnormally low level. Game will decide your connection can't handle the bandwidth of updating with a bunch of other players' data and give you a solo experience.  Worked on GTA Online for PS4 (not sure if it ever worked in other games or other platforms). 
---
Ea and bioware have gone all in with Anthem. They have so much invested in the game, it's marketing and showcasing it that they have to do well with it or you may see them selling off bioware. 
---
Bethesda does not seem very invested. They are quiet and making mistakes that make them look like amateurs.  Beth just seems ready to cut and run. Then reuse assets for a Fo5 game or depending on licencing maybe a FO3/NV remaster.
---
I can see them doing that as a fast cash grab, look how many times the re-release Skyrim. 
---
If we will be able to include "Gameplay" mods, then we should be ok.
---
Game Dev Employees are rarely judged by the success of the game they worked on unless they are executives or live ops (in which case relatively better is generally still ok, ie: I added this event/sale and DAU/RPU went up 50%). 
---
I interview about 3 game designers a week and we only hold people accountable for decisions or directions they spearheaded at their previous company. 
---
If a designer had worked on fallout 76, I‚Äôd want them to be able to answer ‚Äúif you were Lead Designer of fallout 76, what would you have done differently?‚Äù If they can express what was bad and why, in addition to how it could have been done better, that‚Äôs all you can really hope for. 
---
I would bet basically all of these devs would list FO76 on their resume. 
---
I always get loot from queen and I have played with more than 8 players and I‚Äôm pretty sure especially early in my game I did not get in much damage. What I never get from her kill is XP. 
---
Determining random vs deliberate is the whole point of the exercise - it even says that right in the post lol. You must be the guy that answers product questions on Amazon with "I don't know".
---
We're building worlds here people, and short of any new content from Bethesda this is what we do. And don't try to pretend that you're somehow cooler than all the rest of us because we're all just nerds posting in a forum about a video game.
---
Also - u/33Games, I didnt know you had a YouTube! What's it called?
---
This happens a lot to me too.  But more specifically when I get close to my target.
---
They could probably disable running console commands with just a one-line // comment.
---
But I think they'd want to give text chat its own interface instead of reusing the console. There's also the temptation to make it use the pip-boy, which would present a bunch of other difficulties with making it user-friendly. Players might even want to chat with friends who are online but on other servers. Perfect is the enemy of good. The desire to do something just right often leads to abandoning the idea altogether.

Turn around and publish it on amazon docs and see if you get any bites

Not had a chance to compare the Fo4 vs the Fo76 one.
---
I think we should only be able to switch perks while in a bed or in our camp.
---
It'd be an immersive way to encourage players to camp and seek out others'. It would introduce the need to sleep in a non-invasive way in a survival game where all other needs except sleep must be constantly managed.
---
It'd encourage you to camp and seek out other players' camps.
---
It would prevent you from swapping out on the fly and encourage you to plan ahead carefully. It would limit you to a role in a team.
---
Lockpicking and hacking provide shortcuts in the game but all we do is open our menu to switch around then switch back.
---
There is a mod that allows you to switch build at the press of a button. This is arguably a massive advantage given that perk hot-swapping has become such a core part of the game. 
---
Imagine how bad it could get if in the future mods allow swapping builds from a hotkey directly.
---
I would definitely try it but I don‚Äôt have nearly enough plasma cartridges to keep it going for more than 10 minutes haha. I would have to hunt down a decent legendary version + the barrel since I haven‚Äôt found it yet. Its definitely something I want to see!
---
Rad worms bug? It adds an extra 100 carry weight to pa, and has been involved in a bunch of weird stuff.
---
I met a cool guy a few minutes ago. He explained he stopped playing 76 at one point to play RD2, but gave up because it was nothing but PVP the whole time so he came back to 76 for co-op and friendlies. Gave him a tour of my camp before he set off for the Atoms store to get the tuxedo since he wanted a new outfit.
---
Last night I decided to go to check out the Excelsior (I think that's what it's called) model home in the Mire. Went there by myself, at night in the game, and was nearly killed by a Deranged (?) Mothman, several glowing Gulpers, a blazing Scorched (I think?), and several other hard to see things that were all set on killing me. It was spooky and I didn't get close enough to the house to see it. 
---
I'm pretty much just shit posting at this point trying to illicit a substantive, transparent response from Bethesda.
---
Don't take me too seriously.
---
yep, i use a anti armor buzzblade with the 2handed perks, its not super OP but its pretty strong. 
---
False. The facile impressions of intellectual layabouts are of little relevance.
---
looks pretty cool ! 
---
1000th, lol.  I keep checking in with this sub but after the last depatch issue I have just gone back to Fallout 4 yet again.  Some things still make me laugh even after so many playthroughs and soooooo many hours.  Strong saying "Thought you knew" to Rex.  Heh, still raises a snort.
---
&gt;  Maybe not a bad thing at this point but players might get bored once optimized builds become well known
---
They're already known. The only difference is under the new system you'd have more points to differentiate your personal "optimized" VATS critical or melee build from all the other ones. So how would that kill diversity again?
---
I'd like to see loot improved, but 4/5 legendaries not dropping loot sounds like bad luck, not design, and I don't see how it has anything to do with balancing.
---
And yes, I know some oblivious people like to pretend that all balancing is nerfing. But your inability to understand the networks that are being adjusted is not a designer's problem. Something something forest and trees.
---
I like it. 
---
You‚Äôre in this sub, so i assume you‚Äôve bought the game as well. We‚Äôre in the same boat. What else are you going to do? Whine away? Okay i hope that makes you feel better. 
---
I choose to view it a little more ‚Äúoptimistically‚Äù. What have i got to lose? Heck i‚Äôm not even playing the game anymore. I stopped at 100 hours a couple of weeks ago. I know it has problems and needs more content. 
---
did you have a large friends list? like 80+ People?
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be so insulting if every crown enemy didn‚Äôt throw a useless grenade launcher and a pile of heavy 40mm grenades at you. I used to be so excited the the regular, and auto, grenade launchers but they suck so bad it‚Äôs just kinda depressing now. 
---
You would think but adjusting the energy damage is one value change then a bit of testing. And we all know they don't actually test these patches so just one value change.
---
the BoS Combat Armor plans are still on the Vendors leveled lists but won't display, it's a bug.
---
Enemy swarms are my shit with lever action + gun fu. I just pull the trigger a few times and everything's dead from headshots lol. 
---
"Thank you for your reply, I'll be passing it onto the junk folder."
---
Yeah that. not sure if it would work to keep people from disconnecting since it would load nearby people only. That is, if it works.
---
OMFG! This, so much this! 
---
Why?
---
I haven‚Äôt looked through it yet, but is it the same for raider armor plans?
---
I vendored it. It was only level 30 or 35. And it was a Hunters, so only bonus against animals. 
---
I'll add you next time I'm on. 
---
I get your point, it's far from ideal and yeah RuneScape isn't a pay to play game as standard but I solely meant that it doesn't bother me so much as I'm used to a worse grind. Personally it doesn't make any difference whether the game is made by a AAA producer or not I'd hope the issues didn't extend as far as fallout 76 currently; I can excuse bugs on launch but reintroducing old bugs is careless.
---
They always give that generic ass response. That they‚Äôll pass it along to the devs. Yet update after update. Nothing is fixed.
---
I don‚Äôt believe they can focus on pc first as well. There‚Äôs just too much potential backlash. Everything that Bethesda does from this point is magnified 100x. Every small step is nitpicked. Something as small as ‚Äúfavoritism‚Äù can turn over the entire ship. Their best bet is slow and steady progress. Avoid mistakes (easier said than done for them it seems)
---
I have never seen a legendary UGL either. While a bloodied/curious would be better, the fun factor kicks in again. I like having green pew pew beams. Plus the UGL has a red/black skin to it, almost like you‚Äôre an elite gunner!
---
Top on this list should have read ‚Äúfix all the bugs we introduced last patch‚Äù you guys really got no idea what the fuck is going on!
---
Currently playing with my wife and daughter. We wander the wasteland, exploring as we go. This past weekend we finished the first part of the Enclave questline and now have started the second part (unlocking the military wing.) We try to help out lowbies as often as we can. 
---
Ah ok don‚Äôt mind me then. Continue. 
---
If memory serves it somehow becomes a quest, so switching back to another station does nothing.  You have to go into your quests and abandon it.
---
I know this won't be a popular response, but one thing you should know is that a lot of people DO buy these tart items on cash shops. I played another game and we had the same situation, updates that offered us these weird or kitschy stuff, and I'd always be like "Why are you selling us this shit?"  But in the end, some of that junk sells really well. You might be surprised by how many people are into it... though you shouldn't be surprised that they don't want to flag themselves over it. xD
---
So what I'm saying is, I agree, the cash shop updates are bad. But they're going to keep doing what sells, not what's cool, which is why it's a different team and not a bunch of devs deciding what goes on it. It's pure marketing and will be driven by marketing principles to make sales-- anything beyond that, those guys don't give a SHIT lol.
---
Personally, I've been content to mostly ignore the atom shop. I save my currency and spend it on the rare occasion I like something, like the modern fireplace, succulent plants, etc. And the reason why I'm content to ignore it is because I know that once mods hit the real MVPs will likely be unlocking a LOT of assets for us to work with. So fuck the atom shop for now. xD 
---
They can drop as legendary. Left a 1* one in the whitesprings station suitcase after last whitesprings run.
---
Just read! This is great data. I'm going to try to hit all of the places that I can in game. A couple of us went out last night and checked out a few places. Didn't get too much data, but I've got some leads of places to investigate the mothman/interloper connection that I'd like to follow up on this weekend. 
---
Great post! Keep em coming!
---
It also seems the rng is "preferring some items and prefixes above others, so not every item has the same spawn chance. Think of how many walking canes, Raider armor, and other crap u get 
---
Yes! I held on for so long but what finally pushed me off was the fact that Bethesda seems to not care at all about it's fans or players major frustrations or concerns. I've said it before but it only feels more and more true, Bethesda doesn't really care about Fallout anymore it's just something they put out between ES games. 
---
My hype is all in on Cyberpunk 2077 personally
---
You are going to want at least one part of your swanky armor to have poison resistance and radiation resistance maybe... one other part. Reason being is low hp builds will die from radiation resistance if they are not in power armor and poison stat weapons will melt past damage reduction.
---
This an excellent dissertation on the perk/point system,and makes perfect sense. thank you for the time it must have taken to get these figures together, hard cap at 76 is what it should have been and now the numbers agree.    
---
  Just a note though, your special cap calculation is wrong, you don't remove 5 from each you would multiply each stat by 2/3 or 0.67. Giving you 13/7/14/9/14/11/14 becoming 9/5/9/6/9/7/9.
---
Yeah that's what I noticed, I'll try and see if I can abandon it. By memory I couldn't seem to find it but I'll give it a second crack, cheers.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this but it would save a lot of heartache and time. Anyone try it yet?
---
Well yeah it‚Äôs not a success. But this is in hindsight. Bethesda probably didn‚Äôt think that when they released in November this would be a shitshow. At worst maybe complaints from the bugs, So there was no urgency from that point and maybe they thought they had some time. 
---
I agree that more communication would be good. Skimpy ITVs like last week don‚Äôt help.
---
However, all Bethesda can do is put information out there. People need to read it. I don‚Äôt know how many times someone claims there hasn‚Äôt been an ITV for weeks.
---
Or people making suggestions that Bethesda has addressed saying its coming. Like stash box increase. It will come. 
---
All the suggestions of how to do it are pointless. They will increase it when they do. 
---
Now I repeat the part about how I agree Bethesda needs more communication, but get attacked for saying something people see as defending Bethesda. 
---
I see why you dont write for video games
---
Needing that much time to provide a road map means you never and don‚Äôt have a road map. You just winging it at best.
---
That would literally make this game even worse. It doesn't need to be more fiddly and grindy. It needs to be streamlined, smooth, fun, and challenging.
---
Currently it is none of those things.
---
Shoot. Kill. *Rinse &amp; repeat*
---
As others have commented, too many Stat points would result in builds that aren't really varied.. at least from a Stat Point Perspective.  Currently, we can get 56 out of 105 total max stats, which gives some room for hard choices.  So that is balanced well.
---
The issue is not the stat points, but the sheer number of Perk Cards vieing for our limited slots. If they were all combat cards, then it'd be ok. It'd be interesting choices to make. And you wouldn't feel cheated cause you had to give up 30% Armor Pen to reduce the weight of your junk!
---
Frankly, I feel like they should have handled this like Magazines in Fallout 4. Take all the QoL, Crafting, Lockpicking, etc Perks and remove them from the cards.. Instead, have them be attached to magazines out in the wilds we have to go somewhere to collect, or that drop from a quest.  
---
Magazines were one of the best damn things about the Perk System in F4. It turned what is normally a simple boring choice between "5% Extra Crit" and "5% Extra Damage" and turned it into an *adventure*. You didn't have to *choose* them, you had to *find* them.
---
I've found that no star legendaries can be part of a legendaries group. I wonder if something with the last patch is giving all of them the wrong misnomer? May explain why so many "legendaries" don't drop anything.
---
Bethesda Needs to unban all players already
---
I've shown up in fully crafting setup and wondered why I was dying so much, just forgot I logged out while making crap and logged in to a SBQ fight starting.
---
As all would know many, but not all, players are mad about the recent patches and we all see what they are asking for them to change but I'm pretty sure Bethesda just doesn't wanna look like they made the wrong decision and go back on some of the things they changed. 
---
One being the tse weapons but I'm not very peculiar about that since I like a fair difficulty. Honestly the tse weapons were making the game too easy for me. I like the damage output as it is now.....Although idk why the two shot weapons got nerfed as well. 
---
It's just the fact that they are trying to make the game harder and harder (mainly the world itself) to the point where it's not even a challenge or even fun, its just grind for many hours and repeat. 
---
Plus the game never really had a story to it so there's no point in it. No real feelings toward the game unless you roleplay something but even that's fading as the content for everyone is reaching its max already.
---
****I just wanna be able to play the game to where I don't spend most of my time looking for materials for my weapons and armor just to actually play the game for only a quarter of the time I spend collecting scrap. I wanna just be able to play a shooter for most the time.
---
**Also that mainly it's the SB that can just wail on you with their ranged attack none stop and also even if they are facing the opposite direction is also a main killer for me.
---
Where in my post did I say it would kill diversity?  All I said on a roundabout way is players would become vastly stronger, and that would heavily impact balance.
---
Yeah one of my alt characters grabbed a story holotape at the responders airport and I went on to kill scorch then the server disconnected me few minutes later. Apparently it didn't save the holotape in my inventory yet the game thinks I got the holotape even though the questline still shows the objective arrow at the table to grab the holotape. I tried disconnecting, restarting the game, waiting couple days nothing works. And this is a main storyline quest too; so that character is completely screwed.
---
This sums it up perfectly. To put it another way -
---
Fallout then: Heavy Metal (the magazine - sex, drugs, murder, stories, crazy shit against a backdrop of a ruined world)
---
Fallout now: Memes on Imgur (mature content filter on).
---
Apex also released without an extensive Beta as a virtual surprise and it fucking worked right out of the gate.
---
Well, considering they simply added 5 to each cap, I figured subtracting 5 from each would be the logical step.
---
Considering it's a flat adjustment, I opted for addition rather than multiplication.
---
i go to goodneighbor and drink irl like its my local bar
---
after picking up cait again and giving her half the psycho from the drug dealers i robbed outside diamond city
---
ok one more play through...
---
sounds like a bog to be honest.  I'd wager it uses the "armor" mod learn % instead of the "weapon" one.
---
Which seems kind of ass backwards but hey, given the state of everything else in the game I guess I shouldn't be super surprised :P
---
0.001
---
Yep.  Before release Bethesda claimed they'd traveled all over WV and wanted to be respectful of its history and rich culture, and then 20 feet outside Vault 76 I ran into a moonshine shack followed by needing a gas mask to explore half the map.  So my guess is they never tried the local cuisine because they were in hazmat suits the whole time and then burned their clothing once they got back to the natural and social paradise of Maryland.
---
why didn't they just make the hacker &amp; lockpick cards with three ranks?
---
You totally understand the issue, but not that I am kidding. =)
---
Are you a Bethesda employee by any chance? This kind of reads like it's come from a frustrated employee.
---
No, you're right, feedback isn't a dialogue. However, it's not one sided either.
---
It's very reasonable to:
---
1. Receive acknowledge and response for popular feedback. Not directly and not for every single instance but for those that warrant a response, either some indication that the feedback thing will be implemented, think about implementing or in some rare cases (like they did in their very first feedback response post back during beta), indication that it won't be implemented.  
---
Bethesda has already done this on numerous occasions. It's no unreasonable to expect this trend to continue.
---
2. Expect your feedback to be implemented. Maybe not your specific one but someone's feedback. If not, there's absolutely no incentive to provide feedback. **You provide feedback for the very expectation of it to be implemented**.
---
You're on the wrong side of this issue.
---
Agree totally....and at least when playing solo, the game is engrossing and beautiful and frustrating...no mods (other than a few ENB thingies) so starting out you have nothing but a knife, pistol and a few shells...constantly hungry, thirsty, radiation all over the place, etc. Overall it's great ):
---
I think you can just go to the list of quests in your pip boy and abandon it there.  That's what I had to do the first and only time I clicked on that "radio station".
---
One handed or if just melee then it applies. Dunno with the robots resistances if troubleshooters would help much honestly.
---
But they do drop then, so maybe i will switch from my wolverine melee to these as a backup weapon. 
---
The Producer, the Lead Sound Guy and a few others are super active.
---
And having a seperate tree for your ease of life cards cards that scale off of what special you already have would help that. Increasing your Special isnt going to solve that if you have a max str character. At least with having a different tree of cards soley for the ease of life cards, you could finally equip those weight reduction perks. Increasing special points by 26 is what will kill diversity. 
---
"Legendary Wood." That's what she said.
---
Ok but its not.
---
It would be very easy for them to use Austin as a scape goat for 76 if anyone even mentions it in regards to Starfiled and TES6.
---
No one who plans to buy those games is going to be deterred by the failings of a newly acquired staff on a spin off that has likely already turned over a few times.
---
They can also easily shift blame to Sony and Microsoft and call them out on their distribution fees. Everyone knows this is the reason console updates are carefully planned.
---
Finally, Bethesda doesn't give a mother fuck about press. If this hasn't been clear since November, I have no clue what you are looking at. The cavalry should have been called in a week after launch.
---
Do one for psycho :)!
---
Sure.
---
Fallout 76 has become extremely entertaining to me. Not the game itself, but the slow motion train wreck that is Betheada moving forward. 
---
Has 76 gone F2P? If not, then I'll continue being content waiting. 
---
In 76's current state (I do a lot of reading and watching gameplay.), I don't feel comfortable paying for a subpar product that has MTXs prioritized over community/player feedback, with a demoralizing grind, and broken gameplay that makes me feel like an alpha was shoved out of the door without QA testing. 
---
No private servers and mod support is twisting a thorn in my side as I enjoy FO4 (along with FO3/NV) modded to heck in a handbasket. 
---
I feel uncomfortable paying because that says I condone shady, greedy, disgusting, and un-consumer-friendly business practices. (I don't, I have patiently waited and watched controversy after controversy.  Read community feedback. And REFUSE to play without it being F2P to start first.)
---
( Controversial Opinion Addition) 
---
As a player that started with Fallout 3 and its DLCs, worked my way through New Vegas and its DLCs (My favorite), and Fallout 4 and its DLCs. 76 doesn't feel like a mainline entry (regardless of it being a spinoff since everything done is canon.) It feels like an EA-style cashgrab from the abysmal launch, to reselling assets from Fallout 4, to prioritizing MTXs and making the grind disgustingly long. (If I want to grind a 9am-5pm job, I'd go back to playing GTA: Online.)
---
Bethesda if you read this, axe your greedy shareholders, and make a good game. We're YOUR fanbase and customers. If you keep down this path, bankruptcy is imminent. 
---
Shape up, or don't. 
---
Keep prioritizing MTXs and ignoring the community. 
---
At the end of the day, us players pay your wages. 
---
Keep us happy, or find another job.
---
(Done from a cellphone, I apologize for any formatting errors.)

The only people who refer to the east coast ‚ÄúNew England‚Äù anymore are patriots fans. History not geography.
---
&gt;it's a holotape ad talking about the pumpkin house but don't take it with you cause it ceases the body from spawning there till you get rid of it
---
Son of a bitch. I only recently got rid of that holotape, after I gave up trying to get those plans. 
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
If I get some more requests I might do the whole set. :)
---
&gt; Like 10-20% or something crazy high
---
No it's not that high. I've gotten ~5 shots in with a normal rifleman build using a AAE Handmade, had my game freeze until she's dead and earned loot.
---
i had someone hide carrots in my base that were impossible to find. so i could never repair my camp at the workshop thing since i never had carrots. 
---
Sounds like it could streamline the game and might make the grind a little more manageable. Beth won't go for it.
---
Anthem will kill this game because you are so dam lazy and careless .... nice work 
---
Riot Armor
---
Which engine? Please don't tell me there are going to use the FO76 engine for FO5? They need to throw FO76 engine in the trash heap and start over. 
---
I was just going to post this. Come! Be with us. 
---
For the lolz
---
This in the only thing that makes me badly want the ability to repair stuff over 100% durability 
---
Good call! I've never gotten marsupial, but never tried for it specifically.
---
Do you have the card activated?
---
Just a terrible day with this game. Was trying to create the excavator suit, got killed lost all the components. Went to get them back but I was over my head with a wendingo. Used another miner map to get more black ore. Dig up the ore. Nothing. Nothing comes out of the hole. Later break into a safe, the safe just sits there. Server drops. I stopped playing for awhile and tried today because I was stuck in the house. Regret it.
---
How would you do that? Get rid of half the perks and replace it with just combat-affecting ones? There should still be some restriction in character build hot-swapping.
---
I can't think of any mainstream online rpg with pvp elements that allows you to radically change your build on the fly.
---
If you are happy with your SPECIAL point distribution and available perks, and feel that you have enough good gear, aid, and ammo to get through it, go ahead whenever you‚Äôre on a well-populated server. 
---
I waited until I had the X-01 suit, a strong melee weapon (the All Rise* from the Mayor for a Day quest at Watoga Municipal Building is good enough) and some guns that are good against robots that can still reach the scorchbeast and went for it. 
---
I was nearly through the pre-launch check and got disconnected, then had to start over on a new server and happened to spawn in with a 3 player team that was about to go for it as well. We teamed up and got through it with a few revives, there are A LOT of robots in there.
---
Nice, it's very mischievous!
---
I assume that stuff you build in a team mate's base stays after you log off by the way? I haven't teamed up much and I don't have any regulars I play with so I've not got a lot a experience with this. 
---
&gt; The feedback we receive on Reddit, and forums, and social continue to be the most valued and helpful in determining what gets fixed and implemented when and where
---
Why this this though? Why are you relying on public mediums like Reddit? These require you to have presence 24/7 and have someone manually curate the noise.
---
Why don't you instead have an actual bug report process available? An issue tracker where we can report an issue, click the "I have this issue too" button, post additional information / screenshots / logs for you and *actually have some two-way communication* specific to the issue?
---
How much easier would it have been for you and the community to have one report for "Dead tamed creatures causing C.A.M.P. budget to increase and never decrease"? A moderator could merge duplicate reports, get a response from the developers and tag it "Known issue - to be resolved in patch February 19th".
---
I am the OP, you posted this with out context as a responce to the topic as a hole, not as a response to that comment. 
---
I see where you‚Äôre getting at. And for you or me who are following this game through multiple channels, we would hear any of those ‚Äúexplanations‚Äù and would probably understand (begrudgingly) 
---
But I don‚Äôt believe we represent most gamers. There‚Äôs a significant chunk out there that doesn‚Äôt follow reddit or watch youtube of the game they‚Äôre already playing. They don‚Äôt care which studio made it or which company handles distribution. All they know is they bought the game, it has bugs, but still want to play. And when they hear that their console game is not getting patches while the pc is, well that‚Äôll just add fuel to the fire.
---
cute
---
...the end of the month? 
---
By then NONE of my friends will play this game anymore! 
---
A roadmap should take less than a day to workout. Especially as it is only going to be a guideline. 
---
This is ridiculous. 
---
‚ÄúWe are aiming to get that posted by the end of the month‚Äù
---
Does that mean you have no content coming anytime soon?
---
julius campbell, julius randle plays for the pelicans if anyone else was taken aback 
---
It is great to hear patch 6 is scheduled for next week!
---
However, I'm not sure if the actual message from most posts is clear enough. People are uncertain of the future of the product they paid a good amount of money for.
---
With the amount of money people paid, and the actual state of the product. People feel they have become a major stakeholder in the product and I can't blame them. Bethesda needs fun players to sell the product and the people who bought the game need fun players to continue enjoying the game. Both parties actually want to reach the same goal.
---
Since the players are now important stakeholders of the product, they at least need to be much much more up-to-date on the plans of the product.
---
Your stakeholders shouldn't have to be asking when the next patch is. You should tell them as soon you know.
---
For the roadmap your stakeholders need to see an initial plan now, just the things you are thinking of. So your stakeholders can give advice to get a good final roadmap at the end of the month.
---
In a project stakeholders are usually able to know what is going on on a daily basis (e.g. even attend daily scrum). That is what your player stakeholders want! They don't need to have influence on the sprint, but they want to know what is going on.
---
Stakeholders are usually best to be taken seriously as I am sure the business people at Bethesda already know. Many good examples from other games have already been given. Most kickstarter projects send good updates and to be honest, Fallout 76 has (said since the beginning by Bethesda) always been a new concept and experiment. So please take example from similar concepts.
---
I know it does if they're your friend, and I assume it does if they're not as well. I tend to log out right after vandalizing lol
---
How can a game be unbalanced when every player gets the same thing eventually, the ONLY reason anyone is whining about balancing issues is because they added PvP to a PvE series. I doubt a single player would have complained about any over powered weapon if there was no PvP and ability to murder another player so easily in the game. That, like, just my opinion man.
---
I find myself working my vegetable starch farm more than engaging in combat. Make a ribeye steak, drink an old possum and relax.
---
Fallout 76 farming edition. 
---
Yes, I would assume. Would be a good time for a VATS crit as well
---
Yo know damn well this aint the first time the servers went down for you stop lyin
---
With what repercussion though?
---
They stop playing for a month, hear console versions are fixed, and subsequently come back?
---
There are seemingly no substantive consequences to updating PC versions as soon as possible, and only net gains.
---
I truly believe they are stalling while they try to meet staffing needs. The last ITV and lack of a roadmap are pretty blatant indicators of their stalling tactics.
---
Lol wut, I've been disconnected plenty but never had a error code.
---
Allow us to discard perk cards that the packs just gave us, I don't need 3 separate cards of Fix it Good at rank 1 2 and 3, not to mention the dozen other doubles of maxed cards I have.
---
I wonder if Ryan Reynolds likes Fallout or would like Fallout.  I'd love to play some rounds with him narrating his thoughts the whole time.
---
&gt;But if I see one more post whining about popular ideas not being added into the game, or personal grievances not being addressed, or conversations between devs and players not happening, so help me god I will turn this bus around and drive the whole damn sub into oncoming traffic.
---
While you do that you can watch the Anthem bus merrily drive past. Saying 'they don't have to' is perfectly valid but don't act as if people expecting it are in some way naive for doing so when even EA seems to manage this particular PR tactic.
---
Well you need to start showing it then because FO76 is dying off. I‚Äôm not even to level 50 and I have nothing left to do in the game
---
Spoiler flags are for the sentence I wrote below it üòÇ
---
They **have** to be quiet.
---
They can't say *anything* until they're 100% sure about it.
---
Imagine if they said *"We're thinking about implementing [feature X]."*  Within 24hrs the news on social media would be *"Bethesda promises [Feature X] coming in next patch!!!"*
---
Then, if they decide not to implement [Feature X], perhaps because they tried it and didn't like it, the internet will erupt with social media and youtube videos shouting that *"Bethesda lied to player about [Feature X]"*
---
There's really no way a big studio, or even a small one, can say *"We're thinking about this and that, but no promises."* without the entire fanbase going insane.
---
Honestly, what does that have to do with items being exponentially over-priced? It's a lazy, cynical way for a developer to artificially bloat the time you spend with their product.
---
*OLD MAN YELLS AT CLOUD*
---
Wishful thinking but get used to it. They are gonna push Starfield out now and it is one to one small team to work on 76. A team that's never made s game. So keep hoping 
---
congrats on your loot, sorry for your exp loss. Just shows that no matter what there are bugs. I'm sick of waiting on the infinite loot screen just for her body to disappear.  They need to fix their shit.
---
It‚Äôs a gentle tap crowd control weapon. A mere lick of the flame melts L68‚Äôs. Using it sparingly, double-conditioning and carrying two makes the plastic to craft plasma cartridges bottleneck you before all weapons break. 
---
Yes, but to convert you have to work in ratio, your trying to show the equivalency of a 15 point cap to a 10/11 point cap system.
---
If duplication is properly eliminates the ui would have two remaining ways of functioning - 1 - no lower rank cards exist , and you can select to lower the rank (this strikes me as a sort of troublesome ui design despite it working pretty well for mouse pointer interaction at nukesdragons perk card build tool)
---
2- lower rank cards are gathered in a collect them all aesthetic. Just no doubles of anything, so packs also never give something we already had, unless it‚Äôs giving us a rank higher to fill out the collection. We then store them standalone if we don‚Äôt have an equip use case, bring back from stored backburner if we change our mind about the card with our build. 
---
Normally wander around trying to find springs and completeing quests for about an hour until it crashes to desktop then I just go play Forza Horizon 4. :P
---
OK, thanks. A friend of mine is gonna buy it the next time it's on sale, so I'll see if I can do this trick on him.
---
Anyhoo, why not stay, hide somewhere away from their base and wait for them to show up and then film it while watching through a long scope? Would love to see if people react to this and run around their camo frantically trying to find all the toilets :p
---
shit man i don't want it to fail but I would say for all practicality it has though
---
How do totally optional and inconsequential items bloat the time spent on the actual game? I‚Äôve yet to go out of my way to specifically complete challenges just to get atoms to spend. I just play the game while unknowingly completing whatever arbitrary challenges they‚Äôve set for the day. 
---
Aww, he's dreaming of chasing down vault dwellers.
---
If they wanted to follow ESO's model, it would mean the first dlc came out a year later and was PvP oriented. To me that sounds like what we're getting lol
---
Yeah... No Man's Sky was made by a handful of people that over promised. Not a 3 billion dollar development studio that just copy and pasted source code from a previous game. Then spent less than a year removing NPC's, and tweaking audio and art styles.
---
The Atom Shop gets more updates that this game has gotten since release.
---
Worst case, they leave and they never come back. As i was saying, slow and steady might retain most people (but that‚Äôs just me). So I see your point, either way they‚Äôre bound to lose players. 
---
I don‚Äôt doubt they are stalling. Again, they didnt think it would be a damned disaster so probably had a near skeleton crew for the entire team. So if they take from the enhancements team to the bug fixes, it‚Äôll cripple teams. 
---
My bestie does this to me but with the plastic flamingos.
---
From your last sentence it seemed like you were saying that everyone would be using the same optimized builds if we had more points. But anyway very few damage perks are universal damage boosters, like Bloody Mess, that everyone would pick up just because free damage when there are mostly only conditional or weapon type exclusive perks that can already be used together if you're goal is to min-max. Also barely anyone as is uses Hazmat suits. Even in nuke zones they seem like unicorns amongst the crowd of people donning PA. So this would at least make it seem like an option that doesn't completely screw you over just because you want to use a little less rad meds than when in PA.
---
It just shouldn't target friendlies at all, never, not once. I'm tired of aiming at the damn surface to air guns behind me when I'm trying to shoot the incoming enemies in front of me.
---
Do you have an instagram or anything of your art? I always wanted to be an art teacher... not because I'm good, but because I just love art so much and I love seeing what others create. Your style is really cool, and it really fits with the theme of the game. I hope someone at Bethesda sees it and offers you something.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a double durability weapon, and I‚Äôve had some pretty good luck on drops. I‚Äôll have to keep an eye out on the bazaar for someone selling one.
---
all they have so far is words, and thats the exact thing that has a foundation issue going on atm.
---
I‚Äôll give you a full body set of unyielding/sentinel armor for your Gatling Laser with the ‚ÄúCurious‚Äù legendary effect. 
---
Sorry for the late reply but I'm not on here much. I bought the bolt on calibrated shocks for the Excavator from the Harpers Ferry vendor. The trick with the bolt on Excavator mods is that they won't explicitly say Excavator. They will be listed as calibrated shocks only. The way you tell that they are for the Excavator is that when highlighted it shows that they scrap down to black titanium. 
---
Have you found a way around this?
---
Ahh I know where that is.. I must inform my fellow raiders
---
What nonsense is this? I routinely complain online when I decide to quit using my favorite toilet paper, or brand of socks! Why should a video game company be any different?
---
How are you supposed to share in my grandiose, angst-ridden narcissism, unless I post into online forums to express my displeasure, and swear that *this*, will be the last straw! That my overpowered toilet paper was nerfed untill it was no longer worth the paper it was made from?
---
No longer, will you be graced with my omnipotent presence disussing the intricacies of toiletries! Never more, shall I show my disdain for something I didn't buy anyway, but am glad now that I didn't buy, because everyone left already, and I wouldn't want to be in an empty place, all by my pontificating lonesome!
---
I think it's possible it's actually &lt;0.001. The game rounds the display to 0. Don't know if that actually makes a difference.
---
Bring some junk, preferably steel. I'm running low.
---
Yay :)
---
If you're a teacher you should feel proud, it's a respectable job to have and I'm sure a lot of your students appreciate you.
---
Does it address the previously fixed bugs that were brought back on the last patch?
---
Troubleshooter‚Äôs wood armor?
---
I'm still addressing you about something you said to explain why it happens but, seeing as you've come across abrupt / rude / strangely petty about it; I hope it massively bothers you that I didn't reply to that comment and instead replied to the post. Really, really bothers you and you remember it again in a week, look up the comment and it bothers you even more.
---
Edited my comment above to say *you* instead of *OP*.
---
I hope you think about it randomly. And it bothers you more than it should.
---
As we asking the mods this, or are they asking us?:
---
"Please, stop this madness. The cycle of destruction has to stop.  
---
I... I haven't lost faith in you. I know you are GOOD people, and will do the right thing. If anything I've... lost my faith in Bethesda.  
---
They gave me a mission I could never accomplish on my own. They must have known I'd need your help.  
---
Did they also know what you'd do? It's just so hard not to feel... manipulated."
---
I really like the idea of the situational effects but they generally aren't powerful enough to make them desirable compared to the really strong effects like Instigating, Furious and the like which are just as powerful (if not more) without being so specific.
---
I think it's a bug, he never aims at anything till it's dead for me. He used to work very well, I could vats a target, he would pop in and shoot right away and I could move to the next. Probably another stealth nerf by BGS
---
They were saying the same about ESO, google 'ESO failure' or 'boycott ESO', even something specific like "ESO controversy at release." The shareholders only care if it's making money, not if it's getting good reviews. The crown store numbers is what kept the lights on
---
Heres the real question. A sneak vats crit with instigating. 
---
For 100 damage sniper shot. Is it 2x, 2x, 2x, so 800 damage? 
---
I didn‚Äôt mean an extra durability legendary effect. 
---
I meant repair the weapon with weapon artisan 3 perk. You get two bars on top of each other and twice the durability out of your gear. 
---
Fix it good perk does same for armor. 
---
Then adress it in the right area not with an out of context post that is obvious attention whoring. 
---
Yeah I do, double checked it twice...
---
Ahh thank you, this could be it!
---
Xbox One.
---
GT: FaCe Emo (i remember seeing this as a requirement at some point)
---
First of all, why no Compensation rewards, via caps, respecs, rare junk, or random loot? That might calm some people down.
---
Here are some bugs I found while playing.
---
Cannibal perk sometimes lag and allows players to cannibalize non-humanoid creatures.
---
Cannibalizing causes player to leave sneak mode.
---
Sneak attacking online players is broken. They must attack you first.
---
Perks utilizing carry weight don‚Äôt apply to chests, making the carry weight shown on items inside the chest to appear much lighter than they actually are.
---
Bobbleheads should weight 0.25, not 1. Hazmat suits way too little. Gun weight is terribly unbalanced.
---
Enemy loot despawns quickly, and sometimes takes multiple minutes to load.
---
Weapons and armor break way too easily.
---
Broken weapons and armor should reduce in weight.
---
Repairing armor and weapons consume way too much materials, wood armor should only be repaired with wood, robot with aluminum and robot related material, metal with steel.
---
Armors stay equipped after breaking, until taken off.
---
Repairing flux utilizing items shouldn‚Äôt consume flux, but their base material such as aluminum or steel.
---
Prisoner Collar can‚Äôt be equipped with bandanas other than Veil of Secrets.
---
Game crashes from opening the pipboy immediately after spawning.
---
Card repeats are only a detriment to the player; if they want to reduce their card value, they should simply be able to revert their card combinations.
---
Golden cards have absolutely no use.
---
Perception should help determine how much items can be stored in a chest.
---
Disease Cure should be craftable and have a value.
---
Player should be able to have perk sets so that they can change a large amount of perks instantly via ‚ÄúSTAT‚Äù on the pipboy.
---
Vendor Box Pheonix in Watoga Shopping Plaza constantly initiates battles with local hostile units, making it hard to shop.
---
3 starred enemies should be guaranteed to drop at least 3 star legendary items. 
---
Legendary enemies should always drop legendary items.
---
Mole miners should spawn with missle launchers at the same rate as super mutant suiciders do.
---
Plagued enemies should have a much higher rate of bringing diseases or poisoning.
---
Perk ideas: 
---
(STR level 50 ) Nurtured: When both hunger and thirst is satiated, STR increases by 2. 3 tiers.
---
(STR level 25) ???: Equipped armor weighs nothing. Costs 2 S.
---
(PER level 25) Efficient Looter: Highlighted items appear more vibrant.
---
(END level 55) Vampiric: Can drink the blood of humanoid NPC‚Äôs. 3 tiers. Maybe even produce blood packs from corpses.
---
(CHR level 60) Patient: When down, survive for 15 seconds longer. 2 tiers. When not initiated in combat (all hostiles are gone, automatically revive with low HP?)
---
(INT level 15) Resourceful: Repairing items costs less. 3 tiers. Can craft screws and springs with steel?
---
(AGL level 30) Stretchy: Ranged attacks hit at a farther range.
---
(LCK level 75-100) Magic Toolbox: Crafted items have a 5% chance of gaining a random legendary effect. 3 tiers. Maybe a perk specific for armor and for weapons.
---
you forgot "Don't forget to check out the Atom shop!"
---
November 2019, the same time frame for pvp servers ... wait
---
Okay thank you all for that, I didnt realize...My mistake then...Need to eat quickly or cooks my meats.... :)
---
You caught me, autocorrect gets me sometimes.  It‚Äôs really refreshing to see a post that doesn‚Äôt have handmade or shotgun in it. Good to see a fellow GL user.
---
I'm wondering the same. If everything stacks... i tried to test it but can't really make something of it...
---
The feedback we receive on \[INSERT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM\]  and forums, and social continue to be the most valued and helpful in \[INSERT THESAURUS FOR DECISION MAKING\] what gets \[INSERT VERB\]
---
Im either farming legendaries with friends, helping them with stuff, completing challenges. Do events cause thats best way to generate mobs. Although some really suck. 
---
I was hyped too. Watched every making of, documentary and let's play of the game. And yes, I actually did have a great time. But now it's time to get new content since I finished everything 
---
EA Pump massive amounts of money into Anthem, so they have no other choices but to communicate with their's player based.  I don't know how much Bethesda actually spent on Fallout 76, probably a lots less. 
---
Most are still duped 
---
All good my friend, like I said initially and I'll repeat: I'm not arguing against the idea, just pointing out the consequences.
---
imo it would be fun, I'd enjoy this change.  I'm an unrepentant powergamer and min/maxing new builds is what I most enjoy about any game with rpg elements like this one.
---
When you see the Fat Man come raining out the sky from different directions don't despair!! You can always rebuild into something new!
---
It‚Äôs happened to me a lot especially on scorchbeasts. I have used so many bullets only to have a team member put in the killing blow and I get no credit. Also along your lines I‚Äôve killed quite a few legendary enemies whose body disappears before I get a chance to loot them.  
---
Nah fam we all know exactly what you meant.
---
Ha 
---
Wonder what it would look like. 
---
‚ÄúDoes more damage depending on your enemy‚Äôs opinions‚Äù.
---
The further away from your own; the more damage it inflicts. 
---
I can see a huge market for this. In real life too. 
---
This! The tag line of the game is ‚Äúrebuild america‚Äù but there is no permanence in what we‚Äôre building. Just some elaborate shacks in the middle of the forest or the edge of the cliff. How about we rebuild charleston or watoga? 
---
Thank you :-)
---
So then....nobody would see it?
---
If you see it again and are on PS4 i'll. Gladly buy it from you. 
---
Yeah, yeah, that's what you people always say. 
---
Only found him once, he was watching me pick pumpkins at the Pumpkin House, wasn't a mythical unfortunately, but he stood nice and still while I killed him, for a toothbrush.
---
Just because they are hiring 3 producers does not mean the dont have any on the game, that's pure speculation. They said they where working on a roadmap that would be released in the future, the artist part is news to me tho.
---
I definitely need to start waiting to see the conclusion! Something in me always tells me to bail at a certain point
---
Oh thanks, there is a snowstorm passing through where I am. Maybe that is causing the problem.
---
He's "flushing down" the game
---
"I am looking for a demolitions expert well versed in knowledge of pulse  explosives to incapacitate the silos automated forces. I am also looking  for an expert hacker to access subroutines and bypass the compounds  automated systems. Finally I am looking for a brute of a human with  access to power armor to soak up damage from the incoming waves of  enemies proceeding our insertion."   --  Nice Wish List.  Quite the team you're attempting to put together there.  Plot Twist:  Instead you end up with a guy that has one piece of chameleon armor and thinks he's going to sneak in there and throw some grenades at the forces.  The Hacker ends up being a guy with a Fire Axe, but hey at least it has those cool spikes on it.  The Power Armor Brute is just a guy with bare power armor and a fetish for gaming while telling you all about his favorite cologne...   I mean you could still get 'er done.  I strongly suggest you bring plenty of stimpacks and maybe even a few chems while you're at it.   
---
I kid, I kid.  I enjoyed your call to arms and had to envision my own twist on it where you get 3 twits to show up and say "screw it, we're going in anyway.... ffooooorrrrrr llllllleeeeeeEEEEEERRRRRROOOOOOYYYYYYYY  JEEEEENNNNNNKKIIIIIINNNNNNNNSSSSSS!!!!!!"
---
"This game is *SHIT* anyway huhuh..."
---
Ok but why would Bethesda waste time doing this when they have other projects in the works? They‚Äôve yet to do anything game changing yet plus new games are coming out that 76 can‚Äôt compete with (because they‚Äôll be finished games). 
---
Posts like these are cute but I hope you don‚Äôt honestly think Bethesda is going to do any of this. They won‚Äôt even show us a vague road map they just say ‚Äúnew content‚Äù and add shitty atomic items for camps. 
---
Nothing is going to be fundamentally different in this game because it‚Äôs going to be very hard to justify putting effort into a game that people already stopped playing not even 6 months after launch. It‚Äôs just a flop from Bethesda it‚Äôs not a big deal they‚Äôre working on other titles that will hopefully be much better than 76 
---
I feel like Strong would‚Äôve rocked it.
---
I think I found my plan around the raider arena near Top of the World
---
It's coming from someone annoyed by people whining about their feedback being ignored and expecting a response when shitloads of us submit feedback every day. Because that's who I am. :P
---
If I was an employee for Bethesda I sure as hell wouldn't be here pleading with or arguing with a huge base of people. I'd be enjoying my job and my life as a game creator.
---
To your points:
---
1. Totally agree. Especially glad to see you note that Bethesda has done this, not because I love Bethesda, but because it's **the truth**. A lot of people are criticizing the CMs here for doing their job, and a lot of that criticism amounts to "you didn't tailor a reply to my specifics thoughts!", which is complete BS. The CMs use generic language about passing on info because that's commonly how it's done in this type of feedback environment. They're part of a large network and their job has limits, and those limits exist for very good reason, not the least of which is that people employed in creative don't need a bunch of angry neckbeards breathing down their neck, demanding they interact and talk about their jobs' processes in detail. xD
---
2. The thing about this is that feedback *does* get implemented. It happens for sure. But expectation leads to disappointment. And on your last point, I respectfully disagree. I don't think people generally provide feedback with the expectation of it being implemented... away from the insanity of the internet, I think they provide it with the *hope* of such, which is far different and makes more sense if you don't want to be relentlessly disappointed in life. Especially considering some people's feedback just plain sucks. Even if it's popular. So as far as incentive, I think the desire to express ourselves is more than enough reason for most people to submit feedback. And if you don't submit feedback, it's really not a big deal... we have a long history of creatives making good shit without any feedback at all. xD  Trial by fire makes some great products.
---
The issue I'm addressing is unreasonable demands for communication that rarely exists between the creative/business world and the client/consumer world. I've outlined my reasons for this, and they're personal insights, so I don't think I'm on the wrong side.
---
Yes please!! :D
---
*‚ÄùWe are aware of this subreddit and will pass it along to our devs.‚Äù* 
---
You're bizarre, desperate attempt to somehow take offence and be shitty is the only '*attention whoring*' here. It's genuinely pathetic to say I'm attention whoring when I pointed out everything gets downvoted when posted.
---
I don't want your attention. You're shitty, petty and rude about stuff that doesn't matter. So I'll be petty too: I still hope it bothers you that I *replied to you wrong*.
---
The power fist should be a mod that works as a weapon without power armor or as a mod that can be loaded on power armor for a modest damage increase because a fist with a ton of steel behind it has a lot more momentum to bring to the whole inelastic collision thing.
---
Do you know when the jobs were listed? If you do not know that then, you are ranting for no reason. Infact the quest designer job was posted before the game even came out. Just stop man...you are just making only assumptions based on no evidences.
---
Not sure if serious.
---
If you ignore the people day after day and never do anything about it, it would affect me. 
---
People regularly lose their shit just from the fact the Atom Shop regularly gets new items in the first place.  If they started releasing new stuff based directly on player feedback do you not understand the shitstorm that would follow?
---
Every controversy hungry youtuber and gaming "news" site would instantly jump in with "BETHESDA WON'T LISTEN TO PLAYER FEEDBACK ABOUT BUGS, BUT THEY'LL LISTEN WHEN ITS ABOUT MICROTRANSACTIONS!"
---
I don't think weapon durability is a problem except for weapons with huge ROF.
---
Exactly. How many times do we have to do the 'Feed the People' event? Imagine doing it once, and then that mission would provide food to every player on the server for good, until ghouls or scorched would wreck it and it would have to be done again, instead of arbitrarily resetting?
---
you should check out the [filthy casual subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals)
---
Maybe it's because they're so incredibly busy working hard to turn this game around and make it actually somewhat enjoyable?  
---
LOL.
---
So they basically slit a deer's throat, riddled its body with lead bullets, let the body decompose for two months at a 100 degrees outside...  
---
...and now they're dragging the corpse and trying to enlist industry vets to revive their dear game?  
---
Ha!
---
Then it must've been changed from months ago, read patch notes don't practice necromancy.
---
Launched my first nuke solo a few nights ago. Even though I can 2-3 shot most things with my sledge it was still pretty grueling. Would be happy to help, tag VousDeux.
---
Lost me at "fear of getting griefed by players". Jesus Christ you people are pussies. Fearing a game with the weakest pvp in the history of gaming.
---
Sorry if my post offended you. Next time I'll gripe and complain if that'll make you feel better.
---
Why do you say that..... Nothing about it makes it seem not serious...
---
Since the game is effectively a full price* beta, you're actually correct.  
---
* Except in markets where retailers are giving the shitty game away for free. My favorite is the story of the retailer in Germany giving the game away with the purchase of a used controller. LOL.
---
Hes running away from u
---
I say it every day.
---
Today is the first day I haven't been downvoted into oblivion.
---
Hopefully the idea is gaining momentum.
---
STRONG GETTING HUNGRY. 
---
WANT SOMEONE TO EAT. 
---
"This isnt to be able to equip ALL cards that involve said things."
---
No.  All quality of life (non-combat character ability cards) should be slotted at once in their own section.  You should never have to trade out lockpicking for hacking.  That is just stupid design.  If you have the perks to do those things, to craft higher types of weapons/armor, then you should be able to do that at any point without having to change your load out.   
---
This is the wasteland.  The players in a post apocalyptic scenario might be thrilled to gather trading cards as they reminisce about days of old, but they sure as hell aren't going to be digging through their card deck just to make a freakin' missile turret.  The card is there.  Why do I have to put it somewhere special just to be able to use it and THEN I have to put my regular cards back in its place when I'm done.  
---
So, I strongly disagree with you:  All said cards that involve fundamental non-combat skills should be running at all times after you earn them.
---
or stick a lot of this small letters onto the side of a foundation until the limit and then snap another foundation in front of it so they have a foundation-letter sandwich taking up their space without knowing it
---
Forget this game, go play sea of thieves or some other "complete" game.
---
I now care more about that character than any entity present in the FO76 world, LOL.
---
You stated that the item cost is mitigated with "plenty of ATOMS" given out through challenges. First, that's false. One can earn a few hundred by intentionally completing challenges, or a buck and some change the way you're doing it. I know it the same way you know it because I do exactly the same thing.
---
Second, $20 for a Red Rocket sign? $5 for a lamp? $7 for a Vault Boy statue? Earning enough ATOMS for those through challenges, *as you suggested* is exactly the artificially bloated grind I described.
---
Bethesda: "Wait, there are other engines?"
---
You ever notice that there's only 1 flavor of chips?
---
There's a trash can with a "Dev Team" sticky note on it.
---
I have a 3 star legendary.  I do not recall the boosts off hand as it stays in my stash most of the time.   A friend of mine picked up a regular one and realized that it doesn't take any ammo.   That's pretty cool.
---
That's a lot of not going into detail.
---
1 flavor of everything.
---
First post in ten days... 
---
Funnily enough there is a visual glitch that allows you to seemingly equip the Power Fist and Mole Miner Gauntlet. But only them two weapons, Deathclaw Gauntlet is out and so is Knuckles and Boxing Glove too I think - it just auto unequips them when you try my trick below. 
---
You unsheathe or ready either of them two so you can see it on your hand, then you enter PA (not sure if all PA, I've only tested with Excavator). When I attack it looks like I'm using the Power Fist or Mole Miner Gauntlet, whether in first or third person. If you unequip either with PA on, you would need to get out of PA, re-equip either weapon and re-enter your PA again.
---
It's visual though. Because the damage I was doing needed about 20+ punches to kill a level 68 supermutant, when 2 or 3 All Rise hits killed another level 68 mutant. 
---
Funnily enough, in third person, as soon as you start moving forward instead of standing still, the fist weapon goes 90 degrees to the left, as though you are holding a gun against your chest with both hands, or that maybe your hand is badly broken.
---
6 sentences, I guess you don't like to read much.  
---
Amber armour was the most beaut though, from shivering isles. Wanted them to bring it into Skyrim
---
Well see, the rad worms bug typically buffs your character's stats, and we simply can't have that....
---
Cool, thanks for the info
---
Another tree specifically to minimize card swapping is what im getting at. If you have the special for said perk, you should be able to use it without having to swap out combat related perks.
---
However your only limit, would be that of your said special. If you only have 1 str, you shouldn't be able to equip all rank 3 ease of life cards that is in that tree. Or if you only have 1 Per, you cant equip all 3 lockpicks in this seperate tree. 
---
I have to disagree.  If the game is too easy or too hard then balance becomes a problem and this applies as much to PvE as anything else.
---
Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go organize my papers.  Business papers, man.
---
why can't we plant a ham tree and produce our own vegetarian ham OP?
---
FYI watoga medical center always spawns a leader or legendary mob, 100% of the time. Often times it will be a 2-3 star legendary.
---
I appreciate what your doing, I've uninstalled and actually reinstalled but at this point I feel Bethesda need to pull the game and redo it, a little like FFXIV of that makes sense. Not as hardcore as that but hopefully those that have played it +40 hours will understand. Yes I've had my monies worth I know that but for a AAA mmo I expect more. I love West Virginia and wanted nothing more than a fallout mmo but at the moment this isn't it. All th best to you fellow Vault dweller. Here's to fallout 7.6 1.1
---
Need a director to make a movie.
---
Need a producer to make a roadmap.
---
Apparently Bethesda Austin is currently in need of 3:
---
I guess I'm just used to stuff that makes sense.
---
Yes it is, I have to have pipe weapon duribility with a level 5 the gun durability perk or none of my guns last past 4 mags before they are broke affer 200%. I can't run the again nerfed and underpowered demolitions becuase I have to run the perk to extend my power core.
---
The latest "fixes and balances" have entirely negated the style of play I and my friends enjoy, medium to long range GUN combat. I hate melee, I mean really hate melee it's not the sgyle of combat I want anything to do with. But as it is all enemies are such bullet sponges that you almost have to.
---
There are mods for PC right now, some people are even using bodyslide and CBBE 
---
No, it means they just hired a new producer and this is their first project.
---
So dumb. Keep on downvoting me people. I speak the truth, regardless of how t makes you feel! 
---
Bethesda is NOT silent!!! They hired over 200 people to man their in house troll farm in December! They have 200 people who work full time jobs responding to comments on throwaway accounts to downplay the importance of customers‚Äô negative feedback! 
---
I‚Äôve been telling you people for two fucking months! Keep downvoting me, over and over, I‚Äôll keep screaming this shit at you until you pull your heads out of your assholes and accept it! 
---
Dataisbeaitiful did a chart showing troll farm activity and one of the ones with a serpate pie chart was fo76. They are here, other Reddit recognize what‚Äôs happened here, but this community is so fucking stuck on Bethesda that y‚Äôall are refusing to see the horrible shit Bethesda is doing...
---
Gosh. I am frustrated. 
---
I never noticed him.  Now I'm going to have to roll a new character and find him.  
---
I'm sure he's fine.
---
Try my trick from my other post, you can see the power fist model seems to fit the PA hand perfectly. Shame that it is a visual glitch and it doesn't recognise the power fist as a valid weapon or something as you only seem to do empty handed punching damage.
---
FFXIV is a great analogue actually. 
---
Oh, they are hiring for that.
---
Apply to the Data Analyst position at Bethesda Game Studios Austin today!
---
Wtf?
---
Oof $80. You got ripped off hard.
---
Don't forget to comment on this subreddit every day about how bad this game is now that you are officially done with it.
---
Agreed
---
Thanks everyone for the comments. I guess my fantasy of the mk 2 sentry bot on the ouskirts of watoga will have to wait
---
Bought the tricentennial edition, I was a fan!
---
what?  If you mean necroposting, ffs, a month isn't that old, and no I don't believe it has changed. 
---
I generally just like covering random workshops with stacks of Bear Skin Rugs, Bear Proof Trash Cans and Cat/Dog paintings everywhere. Otherwise only a few in someones' house on their bear walls.
---
You get what you deserve. This game was destined to fail. 
---
First you choose your SPECIAL point (If you see perks, you've gone too far), then you choose your perk card (which can be under a different SPECIAL category). They are separate steps.
---
A lot of people make the mistake of skipping through the point selection, which gives them whatever happened to be selected by default (Strength), and assuming that the perk card decides which SPECIAL point they get.
---
How do you determine random from deliberate if its all speculation? We aren't building anything, its been built by someone else already and we're at best exploring it. If you're saying you want to spend your time fabricating made up lore so the game seems deeper then it is, go ahead keep deluding yourself. 
---
Dude, it's $30 to $60. The same price as Super Mario Brothers in the 1980's (which was actually $100 adjusting for inflation).
---
The "investment/stakeholder" argument is ridiculous. 
---
I want the game to be good because I want to play a good game.
---
That is all there is to it. 
---
I literally shit out $60 today when I passed last night's dinner. I don't need to salvage it and make a sculpture.
---
if only you where on PC, i can craft both the calibrated shocks and motion assist servos 
---
Maybe EA learnt from previous failures ?
---
Nah, we can totally break the lore, the game is already more than willing to do that by itself. If we have paint-splattered metal armor and FNAF-themed power armor paint, there is no reason why we can't use ulysses's duster or the NCR ranger combat armor.
---
He just wanted to make sure you were taking care of your teeth 
---
It is beyond obvious none of them play the game whatsoever. 
---
The would be frustrated into working overtime just to make the game playable for themselves if that were the case.
---
I've shot a test nuke at nearly every Queen I've killed, she never takes damage from them. Pretty sure she is either immune to the Fat Man or has a very weird hitbox that makes it always miss. 
---
You probably can find a mirror in the nearest bathroom.
---
...should of been fixed already, it's annoying.
---
Oh boy can‚Äôt wait to play fallout with my frie- damnit we‚Äôre on different servers.
---
Haha no honestly I had the time off my life, but then it hit me, one day I found myself saying I'm bored, This was supposed to me my go to after an awful day at work and... Well it wasn't and for an mmo, I thought it would have been. Don't get me wrong please buy the game support the Devs, enjoy yourself bit this is no FFXIV, ESO or warcraft. You will be done in a few months in my opinion. 
---
Can't tell if sarcasm or not, but I sure as hell gonna do my job and let everyone I can know that this game is trash.
---
Love the Anthem fanboys that show up in here.
---
76 and Anthem are nothing alike.
---
But have you heard of this free game called Warframe?
---
Apparently EA and Bioware think it's pretty awesome.
---
I provided the best feedback I could: I uninstalled it. I'll check back in 6-12 months from now. But, frankly, I doubt it will be around. This ship has sunk and will hopefully serve as a lesson on how not to launch a game.
---
How do you equip it on them? There's no equip menu for tames?
---
March isn't that far off. 
---
Though when did they say they were going to give us a roadmap?
---
missile launcher, rendered completely useless after the perk card balance change. it breaks extremely fast. trying to use it is absurd, when it should be usable against higher health targets that are difficult to fight in melee. tactically i would prefer to launch missiles at it and capitalize on my own mobility and positioning. but the weapon breaks, so we can't do that. even with gunsmith 5 in play, artisan repair level, luck of the draw. these are considerable bugs in the design of the game to have these weapons and find that the tactical situations we would apply them and build our characters around applying them, only to be unable to. /u/aten_ra has compiled these types of issues in the unofficial bug list threads he has compiled.
---
The game has been completely unplayable for me since the last patch (quest markers don‚Äôt appear inside buildings among other things). I‚Äôve sent support tickets but no response and now my friend is having the same issue. Was hoping we might get an update today but nope. I‚Äôm about done now - it‚Äôs frustrating and there‚Äôs lots of games out there without these issues.
---
The conclusion I‚Äôve come to is that bug fixes and balances are all we will see as far as ‚Äúlistening to us‚Äù goes. When they eventually get this right. 
---
As far as added content or dlc goes I keep seeing a lot of roadmap talk. All the doors and rooms in WS with hand scanners and vaults is already set. The post about presidential events listed how it would work with a pvp aspect.
---
I feel like they announced the pvp mode to keep it off the roadmap knowing it would divide (the already divided) player base and as a way to test the waters for further content that‚Äôs already been planned.
---
Also trying to cater to hardcore fallout fans and fortnite players at the same time with wacky outfits and b.s. instead of some good looking armor or raider gear.
---
If you're on xbox, I can help you out with all mutations. 
---
Just that you need level 30-31 to keep them with Starched Genes. 
---
DM me if you're on xbox. 
---
Very legal, very cool.
---
Slap a lil banner on a psycho one that just says "FUCKING KILL" 
---
I think everyone are happy that our feedback is helpful, but the issue is that communication seems to be a one-way street with you guys now. While patch notes are getting better, they were horrible at first. Inside the Vault articles are inconsistent and disappointing. Pete Hines and Todd Howard are ghosts now. We don't get to see any enthusiasm from you guys. We don't know if you guys are sticking by the game, if it's a lost cause, if anyone at Bethesda cares at all anymore. Because you're silent. About everything.  Whoever has decided that "waiting till things blow over, then talking" is the right course of action is wrong. Talking to us is how you help this blow over. Your silence makes you seem arrogant and elitist. As if we are not worthy to hear how things are going. If you actually talk to us a little candidly for once. Just once. Then I think you will find a lot of people being more sympathetic towards any trials and tribulations that you are going through.
---
I've said this before. Zenimax did it so well. ESO had such a rough start. But you could really tell that they changed the game based on player feedback and that bugs and issues were squashed quickly. We don't see that here. Their support team was great, they posted relevant information and frequent updates. Their excellent live streams brought in members of the development team to talk about everything, which really humanized the company and helped everyone understand decisions.
---
I don't know. I find the continued silence so frustrating, but I guess you have community managers and PR people smarter than me, who has made this silence strategy. I believe that more openness and candidness would serve you well. Showing a little humility in accepting that everything hasn't exactly gone well wouldn't hurt either. We all know it hasn't all gone well, so if you would just talk to us, we could get on the same page and move forward together. A lot of us  want 76 to succeed, because the potential is vast. But you give us no reason to trust you. 
---
But one of the problems with the game, and why it seems so empty, is that only a small fraction of players have friends who are still playing the game. My model would reward the diehard F76 player with a more populated and consistent world.
---
Tell that to No Man's Sky. Of course, that was a different situation, but they proved that rushed games AREN'T unsalvageable. Whether you're with us or not, stay optimistic.
---
I like to spam bone chimes. They go everywhere, are obnoxiously loud, and have the tendency to clip through items and then can't be removed by themselves.
---
I think they should just shut the dam servers down and out money towards a better project at the point.
---
Fury did.....fantastic game plagued by server issues and bugs.  They closed the game less then 2 months after launch.
---
The fact this game continues the way it currently is, its absolutely sad.  The one response from a community manager proves they are not actually fixing crap just trying to throw out damage control.
---
I think at this point a game that was supposed to last years will be dead in less then 1, most people who really played a lot have moved on or are just waiting for games such as anthem to release to move on.....there isnt anything left for people who have beat the single player aspect of FO76.
---
What I have seen in my way to many years in online gaming is that games that lose players very very rarely get those players back.  You either do well out the door, or you do jack all until the first major game update comes out that actually gives players a new game worth the time.
---
Great idea, horrible execution.....this could be Bethesdas running header for the last few years.
---
This is pretty much how I saw this whole game going down. Its sad as Fallout is one of my top series but Beth has been dropping quality for a while now with their releases while relying on the mod community to pick up the slack. 
---
You are the one talking about downvotes in a topic on ultra light weapons, when a minor comment bellow mentions the Downvotes. Instead of posting there you posted here.  
---
You obviously know how to reply but decided to make your own section hence the attention whoring statement. What bothers me is the fact you are outright insulting and obviously just here to start a fight.   
---
Ok just checked through you posts get the hell out of here troll.   
---
the game will become AMAZING in the hands of the creatives that love this universe and the game itself. we will build the rest of it. All the best classic multiplayer games thrived this way, and there are many modern games being driven forward in the feedback loop between the general fans and the creators in workshop sky-is-the-limit type content creation
---
I have it but haven't ran into random mongrel spawn and when have I forget lol
---
I‚Äôm on PS4....there really ain‚Äôt many options for mmo co op games on the platform :( All my friends and I are so depressed about the state of f76. 
---
Great! Less lag for the rest of us.
---
I must admit that I love that map!
---
really? That's how you are spending your life? Bitching to no end about a game you aren't even playing?
---
And you want to be seen as intelligent and smart too, I bet.
---
Get some help. You are fucked up. 
---
And they hardly take up any budget!
---
:(
---
it is great, they just arent listening to the fans that feel this way. they havent shown that they are listening to either the supportive RP/ casuals or the meta endgamers who also really liked it and just play differently than the RPers
---
52% is not  user reviews. Those are from professional critics.
---
Hey, some of us are legitimate players who got a wonderful and lucky drop. Like me and my tse drill.
---
it was to long after the first word. BY@!!
---
"copy and pasted source code"
---
Firstly, thanks for letting me know outright that you don't know what you're talking about. 
---
But you're right about the Atom Shop, which is a pretty easy thing to iterate on, so no surprise there. Bethesda is a company that has never attempted a game like this, and there aren't really any other games like it in existence. People are looking for the depth and role-playing found in New Vegas, but in an online environment... I'm not saying that's impossible, but a lot more difficult to pull off than something trivial or surface level like adding or retaining NPCs.
---
But as a whole, you're missing my point in the first place. Everyone was very convinced that No Man's Sky was a sham and dead in the water, and now it's moderately successful. Fallout 76 is in a similar situation (probably worse), and also very much salvageable. 
---
Probably be the pvp mode beta
---
I only check the CC to snag whatever is free, and I will continue to only take what is free. Absolutely shitty to ram these transactions into a "completed" (LMAO) full-price AAA title.
---
Not my pics. Our community user take a picture and upload like these :(
---
That's excellent.  I work as a graphic designer and do freelance illustration, and it's high quality work.
---
Fucking nailed it. 
---
There were a couple posts I think but here's one from today
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apvn1u/bethesda_is_very_quiet_for_a_team_that_has_been/egc0ssn/?context=1000
---
Yeah they sure did. Bethesda has a lot to learn.
---
Are you picking agility or an agility perk card?
---
A roadmap doesnt show they actually care just that someone at Bethesda took 10 minutes to type something up.  The roadmap is already there, whether its executed as shown is an entirely different subject. 
---
They want to give the illusion that they're interested in our feedback
---
Lol, even so, would it really break your heart to start over with everyone on a clean slate?
---
They're just trying to appeal to cosplayers. It's their game now.
---
How about righting a wrong? Bethesda did me wrong, so I'll pay it right back.  And is not bitching to no end, I've posted twice, why? Your butt is hurt?
---
are you talking about giving someone the rad worms!?!?!
---
Lol, all it takes is one dupper on the server, and there's plenty of those since they still can't fix it. Lol
---
Thanks you!
---
My background is in design and there's a lot of cross over with tattooing. It's crazy how tattoing has improved my overall design skill though.
---
I know off-topic, but what is with the metalheads you can find in fo76 but can't wear, Quest related?
---
It seems like a lot, but most of the time the only thing on armor and weapons that matters is the primary modifier, such as bloodied or unyielding. 
---
" Patch 6 is currently scheduled for next week "  -- Seriously, no patch this week?  Not even a hotfix? And you only posted six bullet points.  That's not a compelling and looking-forward-to information.  I strongly believe that BGS are just lazy in releasing fixes and contents!  I know you can do better.
---
Bye!
---
Omg seriously? You‚Äôve been wronged?
---
Omg you are so messed up! Block me. I‚Äôll block you. 
---
Lol, creative spelling.  All these people butt hurt over me uninstalling my game. 
---
Now I'm wishing I didn't trade an AA/vats acc handmade for a 2-shot version.  (considering the second shot is only 20% additional stock damage and doesn't benefit from an armor piercing mag mod.)
---
The mod that adds radioactive damage to the weapon is interesting in that as it is taking away health, the target can't heal until they do away with the radiation.   Then again I run with Ghoulish so radiation heals me to a degree. 
---
Oh nice! Thanks for that. Really appreciate it.
---
No need to block you, you are more entertaining than this AAA game.
---
Didn't you quit?
---
I was walking along picking Blackberries. The notification I got 2 Blackberries showed on the upper left of the screen.  Then below it showed I used two .308 rounds. I selected the shotgun and it did the same thing but it was shotgun shells. Happen all the time but only while picking the damn Blackberries with a ballistic weapon selected. 
---
Wish I could say it's been fun! Bye
---
Thanks
---
That‚Äôs a good measure 
---
The melee in this game doesn‚Äôt have any depth. There are three buttons. You never really need to block, and depending on your legendary weapon‚Äôs rolls, you‚Äôre only really using one attack. So one button. 
---
This I did not know - thank you kind sir!
---
No one gives a shit
---
Good info, thanks. I have excavator armor right now and after reading the comments here I definitely need to re-evaluate my perk card load out. 
---
Thank you all for your advice and tips! 
---
because damage systems of energy weapons? it is not bad in low level but it is bad in endgame. i have all of bloodied explosive heavy weapons. also i have bloodied 25% faster fire laser gatling and bloodied 25% faster fire plasma gatling. i used 9 heavy weapon perks and martial artist. also used stabilized nerd rage with emergency protocol. in this circumstances laser gatling is worse even compared minigun. but im using laser gatling because fun.
---
You did, enough to reply! Thanks.
---
I think they were pretty upfront that they gave most of this project to BGS Austin. Individually they had experience, but as a studio they had never shipped a full game, and their past projects involved different game engines (Doom and CryEngine).
---
On the bright side it probably only cost you 50 cents per hour played. Most of the games in my Steam library haven't reached hour 1.
---
rippers benefit from 1h, buzzblades from 2, don't even bother with the chainsaw
---
I've got a bloodied buzz blade, with my 2h perks and the rest of my build it does 300 a tick
---
This is something I've wanted to say every time I see people complaining about lack of new content. The Automatron DLC for Fallout 4 didn't come out until mid-march 2016, and that was rather small compared to Far Harbor, which launched in June 2016.
---
I think it's very likely we'll see something similar here: mid-sized DLC in March, followed by maybe something bite-sized in April, and a larger FH esque DLC in the early summer.
---
In other words, if you're already bored of the game, don't wait around for DLC, because you'll be waiting quite some time for anything substantial. Go play something else and come back in the summer.
---
1. What does your tooltip DPH number on it say? 
---
2. At how much health do you spend most of your time?
---
I wish they would bring back the blackbird paintjob
---
Lordy it‚Äôs as if different play styles don‚Äôt exist with you people. ‚ÄúPlenty of Atoms‚Äù is my personal take based on what I‚Äôve played. 
---
I don‚Äôt play for the sake of atoms and the atoms I have gained through my play were never for the sake of buying anything. Nor do I play with the aim of being able to purchase every stupid item in the store. I just enjoy the game.  But fuck it just downvote me anyways for not joining the ‚Äúshit on BGS‚Äù party. 
---
yes, buzz blades or rippers. i have an anti armor swing speed ripper and a bloodied buzz blade
---
no legendary chainsaws to my knowledge.
---
If you don't want your pet to attack everyone, "re-pacify" once at your camp and log off. It will stay pemanently peaceful...
---
I know exactly what you are asking for.  I understand it.  I disagree with the limitation you are asking for.
---
I don't consider perks that let you move around with more weight to be eligible for working all the time.  
---
I want all cards that I consider to be passive skills...learned and earned from being in the wasteland, to be active all the time:  Hack, Lockpick, AmmoSmith, PowerPatcher (just the passive portion of that skill...the active portion could still need to be slotted for a benefit when in combat), Home Defense (really, I have to put on a card to build higher level and disarm turrets?  That's dumb,)  and any others that should just be passive abilities because they are things you learned how to do.   Things that affect your damage output or other active abilities that you use all the time should just be part of the current slot system.     
---
Why are you still here then?
---
The disorientation is when you kill the thing in front of you and then the perk spins you around when it automatically locks onto the next target.  Play however you want, but that downside was enough for me to remove the perk on my build.
---
Also, it's disingenuous to claim it's a thirty percent buff when it's really a 0/10/20/30 percent buff (60/4=15% against groups of 4 enemies) assuming it works without any quirks.
---
Make the non-combat or "questing" related ones passive abilities, including basic hacking/lockpicking.
---
Why did you even bother posting this? We see a ton of these every day, it's not like urs is any different
---
I tamed a megasloth while camp was maxed out. Still appeared at camp, but put it over budget. Had to scrap a lot to build again...
---
You are right, I did at least get a good value, but that is the nature of videogames in general, not this title in particular.
---
Indeed.  I've been writing graffiti as a hobby for over 20 years, and the crossover between tattoo art and modern illustration is basically a degree unto itself.  I briefly went into tattooing, and all the drawing definitely gave me an advantage early on.  I managed to land a relatively lucrative and enjoyable job slightly related to my field, so I ditched the hustle of an apprentice tattooer for something more regimented but more stable.  I left on very good terms, and there were dozens of new guys waiting to be taken on as an apprentice, so the shop didn't suffer at all.  I'm still good friends with several of my mentors, and had the pleasure of sitting for my friend to get a great and free tattoo on the back of my calf while he was doing a seminar about bio-mech at Colorado tattoo convention in 2013.
---
I was reading about the Division 2 bus. Apparently solo play in the Dark Zone will be viable, so I think I might be playing that when it comes out. At first when I heard about the new pink items in the atom store I thought oh cool as I do like pink, but then when I went and looked at them and imagined my character wearing them I was just like, no, just no. Some games I have liked so much I would buy, and this is one of them. But on the other hand the issues have been the worst of any game I have on PS4. No other game has had so many problems. There just seems to be some level of complete mismanagement. Nobody is forced to stay on this bus. Pretending like it's going in the right direction when it's driving off a cliff isn't good for anyone.
---
I had an issue where all my planted plants  and water purifiers disappeared on moving my camp.
---
This happened a couple days ago. Just getting around to reporting it. 
---
I logged in to see the can‚Äôt place camp message and decided it would be a good time to move anyways. 
---
Upon placing my new camp I look at my stored items in the build menu to see no plants or purifiers. I scrapped all my stored blueprints and checked my stash box but they were nowhere to be found.
---
I had a large garden going with 6 or more of every plantable thing and about 6 of the small purifiers.
---
I still haven‚Äôt repopulated my garden :(
---
Oh hey looks like you're in the wrong subreddit, you should be here: r/iamverybadass
---
If someone has an anti armor laser gun and wants to run a side by side with a normal laser gun same mods plus awareness and damage % check on an enemy that should do it. Or I can borrow one and do it myself.
---
I've held out a long time, waiting for content and bug fixes, just felt like sharing, as is customary here on Reddit.
---
Same situation here. 
---
I can‚Äôt wait
---
For doors to be blocked. 
---
Honestly, I haven't played since before Christmas. I got past 50 and got tired of getting trash drops and rewards for events, getting bombarded by scorchbeasts, and the updates I have seen since then haven't been fixes, but increases to the tedium of the game, like the ever dwindling crafted ammo amount.
---
I want to come back, I just feel like I have no reason to right now, unless there's some massive uodate where everyone is like "Yes. This is it. This was the patch we needed." I know Zenimax is for ES, but I feel like they could really take some notes from ZoS. ESO is a great game, and they actually fix what the community agrees needs fixing instead of saying "Oh yeah, we'll get to that, but how about for now we decrease how many materials you harvest or mine at a time while increasing the amount needed to craft an item? Yeah? Have fun!"
---
I have too and I still play. No one wants to hear u bitch about it
---
Attack speed does do anything (it increases swing speed and it doesn't swing)
---
I have a bloodied one, trying to get bloodied + limb damage
---
good catch!
---
If they had a Road Map‚Ä¶ why don't show it now?
---
Rockstar was worse when GTA Online launched. They kept making promises that they didn't deliver on, everything was delayed and buggy, characters were deleted (including content people paid for with real money). After a couple of months, they just stopped saying anything until a couple of days before an update was released. Heists, which were supposed to be a couple of weeks after launch took, what, a year and a half to come out? Online heists we're the main reason I bought the game.
---
Maybe I've picked a lot of overly ambitious games to play, but nothing about this has been surprising at all to me. Not really even the community's response, which although more intense than the backlash against most games, still includes the exact same talking points surrounded every other ambitious open world multiplayer game I've ever played.
---
This kind of proves the fact that Bethesda wants new audiences. They want the young crowds who play fortnite obsessively and spend money on cartoon wares to join this game. Not realizing the crowd that are fans of fallout have been fans for years because of the mad max esq "a boy and his dog" feel. We want savage leather armor. Tactical gear. Useful stuff that fits the esthetic Bethesda themselves have brought so much colour to. And we have jobs, and will buy stuff if it's worth it. I have spent a stupid amount of money on gta online. Because its fun. Because to me it's worth it. I haven't even spent the free atoms I have let alone spent money on anything here yet. And I actually love 76. I think it's great when it works. 
---
That reads like the synopsis of silkroad.
---
&gt; everyone knows what we‚Äôre planning through 2019. We are aiming to get that posted by end of the month at the very latest.
---
i can take a fat guess:
---
"we don't know"
---
