Soooooo, is this actual source code, or something you found, somewhere?
---
---
---
 I think I would have to buy it, if it was anywhere near reasonable. ;)
---
Yes there are only 3!
---
Ah so you just jumped in to be rude.
---
Or those of us waiting for the game to \*\*\*\*ing update.
---
So the info is outdated. And because it‚Äôs outdated,It‚Äôs false
---
Thanks for the advice. I have kinda dug through these Reddit to see what is good right now. I am not too interested the the bloodied builds. I did draft this up on the builder website. I made this build more towards how i always played the fallout series. [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQLBgMNBAgBAQEAKugBA8EBArIBAfABA3sDfAOHAQPQAQJrA4MBA6UBA7ABA4kBA3QDcQOsAQEXA7sBA9UBA9cBAdsBAwA=](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQLBgMNBAgBAQEAKugBA8EBArIBAfABA3sDfAOHAQPQAQJrA4MBA6UBA7ABA4kBA3QDcQOsAQEXA7sBA9UBA9cBAdsBAwA=)
---
Actual code.
---
Not everyone who gilded the post is just here to trash 76. I play every single day, even after all of my friends left to play other games like Borderlands or Outer-wolds. I‚Äôm still here supporting the game and trying to influence where the games future is headed.
---

---
I‚Äôm not very vocal in posts or comments, but I‚Äôm here casting my vote on posts to show that people still care.
---
bro, you admitted you didnt know about the hacker forum until you read a kotaku article that linked to it. lmao sit down
---
At least u can get the santa suit separate this year i paid 2k for it last year

Christmas rewards starting in a bit. Wait till later on and kill two birds with one mini nuke.
---
(PS4) ;)
---
From... the source of the game?
---
&gt;What do you do when you hit max caps from selling items?
---
My vending machines are in a 1x3 area that has a garage door and a regular door with a level 3 lock. The garage door and vendors are wired to a switch located in my locked bedroom. When I get too close to max I simply flip the switch, which closes the garage door and turns off the machines. This means that even if people stumble across my camp they can't access the machines. 
---
The small locked door allows me to access the area to add or remove stuff from the machines without having them powered on and worrying about people buying crap while I'm trying to adjust my inventory or prices.
---
A link to the Twitch rewards?

Says the man acting like a prick because someone else doesn‚Äôt have the same options you have. I spent 3 years in a hell hole of a job because it was the only thing available. I didn‚Äôt make nearly enough to even get a car. I walked a mile in the heat, the rain, the snow, when it was 5:30 am and 14 below. It‚Äôs the only job within walking distance of my apartment. So my QoL was shit. Being able to make money off of playing game sure as hell beats any job if you ask me. And whether you like it or not, anything can be a job, yes including games. It‚Äôs called grind. And 76 has it.
---
Nope the top comment in that thread from the dataminers that shows they still are doing the "look at exe names" but now they are going with a whitening instead of blacklist. Still same thing.
---
Try glass caverns. Go through it once then go back to beginning and this time pick a piece of ultracite. Scorch will spawn. Kill them then pick another. This also works around fissures but I find going through here twice then hopping servers is the best.
---
Yes.
---
See!!! That‚Äôs a holotape I would follow!!
---
How is that relevant?
---
I had to drop the link to twich and reenable it, that worked
---
Console players didn't get a complete patch when they rolled back that armor/reload problem.  Today's update on console only was apparently to finish that.
---
We have settlements already, they are called C.A.M.P.s
---
its relevant because you are a noob that doesnt know anything about the anticheat, you only just learned about this stuff and you havent learned it all yet. watch this video for starters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD9RMEb5Urw
---
The anti-cheat code is in the first 30 lines of the program?
---
would you be willing to sell one to me I'm on ps4 too
---
The gift boxes are distinct from Legendaries... I don't think they ever said the Santatron would deposit actual Legendaries.
---
I think you can only get 1 per server. So if you get something you don't want purge it and log to main and jump back in.
---
Removing them is random so get at least one set. Speed demon and marsupial seem to come often enough it's not too hard to lock them in the "natural" way.
---
Ps4
---
This is going to be a repeat of last December when they went radio silent for a month and a half right when the dupes went public in middle of December but didn't put out a patch or say anything until last January.
---
So don't expect this to change. Also almost all of the hackers were using free smurf accounts because they expect them to be banned. But they won't ban those with just the items as they've been giving them away in the gift boxes to innocent players. So basically they have no way to track these items and ban the hackers.
---
&gt;Visit JUG on Youtube.
---
Good call. Watching one of his videos is what helped me figure out the trick to building curves and creating enclosed spaces without foundation support.
---
They should give us free shit for Christmas. Am I broke? Yes. Do I want shit but have no money? Also yesüòî
---
Hey man. If you can get more recent info id totally back you up.
---
But you didnt. And your info is bad. Your username fits you btw. Only a person like you can get mad over the internet
---
I'll give that a try thanks
---
Thanks was wanting to see the 2nd drop any link for that?
---
I know. Literally if I had a choice between a holiday scorched dropping 10x large presents OR taking his blue-snowflake suit I‚Äôd take the suit so hard I‚Äôm sure I would rip one of his limbs off lol.
---
So, current anticheat blocks cheat engine, you're saying?
---
They are just using basic cheat engine. This is nothing but script kiddies. Literally anyone could do it with the program.
---
Then I guess it doesn't work. üòê
---
No i dont think so either, but still cant carry anymore
---
I appreciate the advice greatly as I had no idea it was only one per server, but I tend to server hop to switch up the player vendors to get a wide option for plans so that‚Äôs not too inconvenient.
---
Seriously idgi but i got a few?
---
Does it take an hour to dispense one dirty water, like the pump?
---
As someone who was around and had minor involvement with d2 item sites. 20k is easily on the low end. Look up the mansion witha moat the owner of lewt bought after selling items on d2.
---
That's what I have been trying to say, instead the shills swarm me saying this is outdated, as if the new one is so revolutionary that it is the best piece of code in the world.
---
No problem thanks for the link finally read it and it looks like they are dropping 1 bundle per week
---
what does writing code for a living have to do with grabbing a year old screenshot and actually believing its the only anticheat just because a hacker forum said so? this video from june lays out 3 methods of anticheat that bethesda uses. you covered one of them with your screenshot.
---
even if you do write code for a living, how did that help you copy and paste a screenshot from a hacking website? did you even verify anything or are you just as dumb as those guys that used the dupe code with the keylogger in it? use that website at your own risk
---
Truth is no anti-cheats are bulletproof. The real defense is to handle processing server side, which is what most MMO's do. Unfortunately, that costs. I don't see Bethesda rewriting their server software. So a better anti cheat would be good, but it won't stop everything. Sorry. Never going to happen.  Move to consoles.
---
You‚Äôre making assumptions with no proof. If someone gets access to the dev room and duplicates to high hell then they could make money off a few hours work. The lack of decent anti cheat makes this incredibly feasible. Also I would be rich if I made even half of that per year. I don‚Äôt need much. My food per month is about $30-60, my bills about $550 in total. I make $780 a month. If I made 55k I‚Äôd have more money than I‚Äôd know what to do with and could take some serious time on vacations or doing literally whatever. It‚Äôs all circumstantial.
---
Think they just started
---
If they understood things like this they wouldn't be bending over backwards to defend Bethesda. Doing that and a lack of IQ are definitely correlated.
---
No. I explained why I didn't mean for them to be misleading and would update the exchange because there are numerous other things which substantiate the point I'm making. Do you not remember that?
---
still doesn't change the fact that it can snow in the mountains during October
---
This still works, did it today lol
---
If you are curious for more information regarding the cheating, this thread has what they are actively doing as of this week and how they are doing it. Many of them planned on using free weekend accounts to cheat and then try to move the items to mules to make them harder to track. 
---
https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-fps-games/366670-fallout-76-item-plan-object-spawner-legendary-item-creation.html#post2640139
---
Youll need to register at that forum to view this thread, but when you do you can see whats up. They are literally creating items and spawning npcs.
---
It doesn‚Äôt change the fact it would be very abnormal.
---
Because I've seen the new code and it does the exact same thing. There are three ways it does the scan now, but it ends up doing the exact same things, just in more lines of code.
---
Maybe it's tied but, have yoi check the cdkey country? You need to activate the key in Bethesda's launcher, and you need a vpn for that, once it's redeemed you can turn it off.
---
I learned my lesson the first time this happened. Also they will credit you. File a report
---
Because this is not an exclusive subreddit for people who enjoy the game.
---
Ayyyyyyy lmao
---
Im on for an hour or 2
---
No, you didn‚Äôt. I asked if you would update it and you said you didn‚Äôt need to. Now here you are again being insincere. Again, good luck. I look forward to you being able to move on. Remember to tell them how many hours a week you play the game.
---
I use my survival tent all the time, and I would be 100% fine with a player‚Äôs camp packing up my tent. Camp should always override the tent. 
---
I‚Äôve been running into more issues lately with players putting tents down next to whitespring station, preventing camps from loading in.
---
I want a six armed scorched that can fire dual miniguns at you while lobbing grenades and keeping automatic saws or rippers or something in case you get too close
---
That would be an awesome raid boss if raids didn't blow donkey dicks in this game
---
you realize you are commenting right under the link to a 24 minute long video explaining exactly how the 3 anticheat systems work? its clear that you just cant admit you were wrong
---
...thats not how that works.
---
It‚Äôs the actual selling that takes the time, not the illicit acquisition of the weapons. 
---
You would be rich if you make 27k/year? Where do you live? How can you possibly have a place to live for that price, let alone spend $1-2 per day on food.
---
somebody posted a similar thing  on here months ago after release of the game
---
Man a quad would hold 1200 in a plasma flamer. Better get batteries perk for that weight.
---
Assuming it is related: with the crossbow, if the first shot in vats misses, every other shot while still in vats misses no matter what. It is very obvious with a quad crossbow. Happens literally every time you miss a shot. I have never noticed it get fixed, but I stopped playing for a while.
---
watch out.  Someone might mistake you for scorched legendary
---
It does auto update. I have my PS4 always on rest mode &amp; when I turn it back on after waking up or getting home from work I see that everything has updated including Fallout 76. Double check your auto-update settings if it's on or off. Also, it could be because you have insufficient space on either your internal or hard drive. Sometimes, there can be some problems if it's on a hard drive where it won't update randomly. If so you should probably look up "Certain games won't auto-update on PS4, why?"
---
Ya gotta post the rest of the source to back a claim up like that lmao come on buddy.
---
&gt; They posted pictures of network traffic and said they could kill you across the map
---
That part at least they can do, as has been proven out by Nuclear Winter cheaters.
---
Southeastern Ohio, disability, and I only eat once a day usually. If I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôm surprised I have half the shit I do

Need to craft Plasma Grenades to complete the Possum badge.

This is even worse than each individually.  I just did one matchno other rewards.  This is literal bullshit.  F NW  chalanges

Where is a location for a tameable deathclaw?
---
Fuck Bethesda and their goddamn bullshit 
---
Just want to play and a goddamn 500mb patch are you fucking kidding me?
---
Thanks. Is it worth putting points into ironclad in endurance? 5 stars of that is 50 damage and energy resistance while not wearing power armor.
---
Also, what are the damage numbers ill be getting from your build compared to a pa build with stablizsd?
---
I wrestled with customer support for nearly a week asking to be credited for the wrongfully completed dailies. They do not credit the atoms.

Wow.....I didn't seem to have an issue. Sorry to hear.

Yep and no double xp for this like they had this past weekend for the 2nd Halloween event

NW just increased the chance, Bethesda has acknowledged the issue as far back as March. I don't play NW, neither does my girlfriend, but it still keeps happening to both of us. It's utter bullshit.

Not even defending the game, but this is clickbait bullshit. This could be true, but you have nothing to back it up. You got to show a link of how just changing a filename could enable whatever a hacker would want to modify.

Doesn't matter your whole troll is based on a technicality which we can already see the days change despite what your fancy cassette player says which relies entirely on holotapes and radio towers that it can't even pick up a signal from until you leave the vault. 
---
At that if you really want it to reset your stuff every 24 hrs more power to you but I'm happy with my progress
---
Really!? I really freaking hope so. 32 players on a tiny map in the middle of freaking nowhere in flatwoods with 3 like crates is *sooo* fun :/

He thinks Fallout 76 news Youtubers (who‚Äôs main source of income is to create drama and over exaggerate shit to get views ) at all reflect the gameplay experience a normal player would get.

This post also was in response to all those people who threw nasty commentary back at me from my original post (each of () symbols pertained to each person indicating what I did wrong with my comments - but I used sarcasm to highlight each point in this post).

I hear you, fuck a stigma they don‚Äôt walk in your shoes that other 22 hours of the day.  New age is good for the pot community but horrible for just about every other, someone gets offended if you so much as think differently than their closed minded opinion. Then tries to sue you for having your own.
---
Smooth over my ass 
---
Takes like a full hour to download what bullshit
---
I try and do the same whenever I can. If someone is buying ammo from me I fast travel over and gift them whatever extras I'm carrying.
---
I moved camps and can‚Äôt place it anymore. It says ‚Äúexceeds maximum build count‚Äù can you help?
---
I just want minecraft style private servers. If I want to run a server on my homes server then that should be up to me. Yes characters shouldn't be able to jump from one server to another.
---
Same when I swapped my PS4 Pro's drive for an SSD.  Load, Fast Travel, going through doors, and respawn time all halved.  I'd never go back!
---
At this point, im honestly waiting to see "smelling salts" rebranded. Lol.
---
Agreed, old PC stuttered a lot, it was better when I moved FO76 onto a small SSD.  Still not great but the SSD helped
---
I followed the activation  instructions and it clearly stated it was an european key, I bought it from Spain.
---
If u wanna run vats, use a stealth commando or riffle build. I use uny armor to get better sneak and  more ap for longer vats. Look up some vats stealth builds on YouTube or the internet. U can find some inspiration from those.
---
It‚Äôs not a troll. You said it wouldn‚Äôt be uncommon... that‚Äôs wrong.
---
It will cripple everything, allowing you to collect what you need without being bothered.
---
Id wait until Wastelanders. Nothing is different except the santa scorched event that drop goodies.
---
AND you have to unlock each one before doing the next one, AND the XP for one challenge doesn't carry over to the next one. Super Duper lame.
---
Believe someone above posted a map of Random Encounter Locations. Which is the only place to tame animals IF they spawn and IF they spawn alone. You will also need 3 animal friend and atleast 1 wasteland whisperer, both in charisma. Your best options are below abbies bunker, on the road, past the truck in the tree and wendigo. Another option is south mountain lookout, just past the tower to the left, before the cliffs, , if you cant find them then I suggest watching a few vids on youtube of tame locations! Good luck!
---
VATS ftw.
---
Oh, ok...thanks!
---
I attack your character because you have made clear you aren‚Äôt acting in good faith. What exactly is your end game here? What are you looking to achieve? Maybe I have you all wrong, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like you are acting in good faith.
---
Some people don't know you can do this, don't think of doing it themselves, don't realise how easy it is, or don't realise how much benefit there is.   I think it's worth mentioning from time to time that it's cheap, pretty easy, definitely doable by anyone, and does have a worthwhile pay-off in performance.

Thanks, but none of that helps.

All other apps ever on this PS4 auto-update.  When we sign on, it updates, but never until we do so.  Never has.

Hoping someone has a similar issue they solved.

Well the net said first snowfall in west Virginia was on October 16th this year so must not be that uncommon either

You do realize that he can‚Äôt just straight up show you how to cheat or how to bypass the anti cheat, right? That is definitely against the subreddit rules and would get his post removed and possibly get him banned.
---
Of course it‚Äôs fucked it‚Äôs Bugthesda what do you expect?
---
 I dunno, you guys don't have a launcher? I know zip about consoles.
---
And get fucking banned for that? No thank you. Do it yourself or forever hold your peace.
---
What is the definition of uncommon?
---
I‚Äôm the same way. I also find it hard to take out large groups of high levels.  That kinda sucks. I want to run west tek but I stay away.
---
If you're on PC - I have Speed Demon and Marsupial for sale at my camp for 200 caps each. Doubt you'll find them cheaper anywhere else.
---
Try:
---
renewing the license In settings and then power off your PS4. Unplug the power cord for 1 minute to clear the cache from your system. 
---
Then plug back in the power cord and hold down the power button until you hear a ‚Äú beep ‚Äú sound. It should then bring you into safety mode. 
---
Go to ‚Äú rebuild database ‚Äú.and initiate it.
---
Theres a very good chance that‚Äôll fix it.
---
If it doesn‚Äôt fix it , uninstall and reinstall. 
---
Goodluck, that‚Äôs my two sense ! Merry Christmas and I hope that helps.
---
I‚Äôve traded hundreds of times never got scammed
---
Thx a bunch for the info! Been meaning to try this fir a while now!
---
Absolutely agree.  I'm a 1ster and I try to be considerate of my fellow Wastelanders and always place my tent in places where you won't usually find CAMPs.

Hoping they actually fix the +250 DR while reloading this time
---
Biggest miss and some mouth breather mentions fucking apparel 
---
That‚Äôs so SIMS like but so FO76
---
When CCP discovered 60 players exploiting a bug that allowed continuous production of rare materials for free, they disbanded the player alliance and permabanned all 60 members.  No one was left in any way uncertain that if you messed with their game, there would be consequences.  That's what missing - people don't fear Bethesda in the least so are willing to use those scripts.
---
No.  Fuck no.  Why?
---
Wish we could edit the price of an items instead of having to cancel the sale, scroll down to the item again, and reup it
---
That's really cool thank you I'll check yall out
---
I only started my programming class this semester and even i see that it's horrifying. And i usually love bethesda games but damn i didn't realise it was thus bad.
---
You‚Äôll have a much deeper AP pool as you level, and there‚Äôs a lot of perks that extend AP and VATS usage.  Grim Reapers Sprint on a bloody commando build is as close to limitless AP as you can get.  It‚Äôs usually no trouble to mow down everything and never have to wait for an AP regen.
---
There's something funky going on with the tallying of the xp. I've gotten close to 1k xp so far, and only unlocked the wreath. From 3 or 4 matches so far.

There‚Äôs nothing sweet about any of it

Look I‚Äôve paid real money for weapons, caps, atoms.  But for a subscription?  Fuck that. 
---
I‚Äôm not a builder or grinder so fuck the extra storage it‚Äôs pathetic they eliminate survival but cater to the duckies and bunnies pretty up my camp crowd.  Fuck to the that
---
Exactly. They just added Multiplayer to FO4 and added some anticheat lines. And FO4 was built on top of FO3.
---

---
honestly the reason why i love fallout 76 is the community , I was playing solo when the game launched and just having my mic open after setting up my first camp talking to people it was a great way to enjoy fallout with others . From giving people a heads up to the PA spawn down a ways from my camp to the free honey by the beehive and just talking about hope for what the game can become. 
---
I've met alot of fun people along the way from traders, to pvpers to casuals .  It's fun seeing what aspects of Fallout brings people in from young to old . The group I met after launch plays daily even if we aren't always all on we still follow up when one another do log and see how their build is going or if they are still hunting for that one armor or weapon or if they found something cool in the vendor or purveyor.
---
its funny but it's nice not being all alone in the wasteland for once...even with the game still becoming what it can truly be .
---
Of course you do
---

No worries! The vids will deff help on the specifics!

---
I built a wall and decorated it with those little triangle vtu flags,about 50 of them. Blueprinted it and then went at workshops. I could place like 4-5 of them each shop. Got to 7600 in like an hour. You can do the same for the structure and the other 7600. 
---
From a fellow challenge completionist.
---
I agree. It's kind of odd how they're doing, though i get it... just seems like making people feel the urgency isn't as effective in the long run as actually having the item up all month... but hey... maybe it's just us? lol.
---
thank you. ive said this multiple times in comments already. they just like bashing on the game and arguing with everyone.
---
\&gt; Continues arguing with people despite being proved wrong
---
\&gt; Claims its possible but refuses to provide proof that this is the only anti cheat
---
Give it up already man :)
---
I'm sure none of the hackers ever thought of this...
---
You should still update your post. Both of them.
---
I couldn't get it to work on my phone. Worked on my office phone
---
Are you for real?   Do you play this game or are you working for Bugthesda and just fucking with us?
---
The best piece of advice I can give for the early game is to remember to stash your junk constantly. As long as you do that, there is basically zero consequence to dying. Basically, you don‚Äôt need to try so hard to avoid death. The first 30 or so levels are tough for everybody. 
---
I‚Äôm terrible at manual aiming, so I built all my characters into VATS‚Äîthat means max out Agility and Perception and/or Luck. VATS takes some time to get used to in 76, but once you do, it‚Äôs a lot of fun. Being real time, it‚Äôs a bit of a challenge to master it, but you will. 
---
One other tip for VATS...I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs lag, a bug or what, but sometimes you‚Äôll see 95% and no shots will land. If that happens, don‚Äôt keep pumping shots. Back out of VATS, retarget and try again. You should be good. Also, when you target an enemy, don‚Äôt shoot right away. Wait a second, I‚Äôve found that seems to overcome those occasional first shots missing.
---
Yeah i think my wife got all of ours through the large ones, i give her all of my presents, she divides up the loot. She really enjoys the random prizes. But crafting the large seems to be the best bet. Glad i horded about 90k on alts lol.
---
Dude in those pics was the raider in the cell the guy from the article for the trial in the wasteland?
---
What do you mean by that?
---
Only 1 reward unlocks each day until all of them are available. After which you have roughly 3 weeks to grind them all
---
It's such a shame. All I want for Christmas is a normal looking Christmas tree.. lol

No idea. Wiki could be wrong.
---
Do a sneaky commando build, and once you find a decent handmade/fixer/etc. with -25% AP use, you can make a 0 AP use gun with the right mods.
---

---
Wreath is the only one currently available
---
Scorched Kali
---
Wait, what?! xD They don't release all rewards day 1? I thought the accumulated xp nerf was enough lol..
---
Oh no, that's not us. That's pretty cool though!
---
I know right,  and they act like they're the smart one
---
Try Fallout 1st! Only $100 per annum.
---
So if it‚Äôs from a reverse code tool...could it interpret a for each loop based on an external file from the web into those lines?
---
It‚Äôs a high level/build quest so save it or find others on reddit or wherever that can help you complete. Busy servers help too!
---
This would be great. Just being able to invite anyone on any server, public or private seems like a low bar. Yet they still didn't reach it.
---
Do you really think Bethesda coild afford so many shills?
---
Of course there is no perfect anticheat but bethesda can probably make a way better anticheat then two potatoes and a stick of celery.
---
‚ÄúUny armor‚Äù?
---
Hmm, weird. It does for me for some reason. Hopefully you can find a resolvement on the application "YouTube" they usually have solvable stuff about that kind of stuff. If theres absolutely no way you can to resolve it I'd suggest just leaving on your ps4 at a time you think there will be a update.
---
They are like if jawas from star wars had a baby with hunchback from notre dame.
---
Unyielding, gives +3 to all stats at low health except endurance.
---
It‚Äôs not. But here I am getting a wreath. ^^
---
No idea but sounds like you need better internet and computer if it's taking even half that long
---
I like it
---
Check my post about it, a guy in there helped me.
---
Just because the new code is newer doesnt mean its better.
---
They don't need to. Players are doing it for free.
---
What if I'm actively using part of it?  Sleeping in my bag, cooking, playing an instrument.
---
Why should I get yanked out of my shit just because you log in?  The system should stay the same as it is - first come, first serve.  Just pick a new server - why should I be inconvenienced just because you log in?
---
You missed out on some scrap crystal and adhesive.  Maybe a couple fusion cells.
---
Well the update that brought the Christmas item rewards to nuclear winter started today so that‚Äôs probably what it is
---
So many bugs compared to fo4
---
Doesn't matter at this point if it wasn't a troll you wouldn't still be trying to get the last word.
---
Its December 17th not October and it does happen so uncommon is irrelevant.
---
Wow
---
The release notes said it was to fully roll back the weapon fix they partially rolled back earlier in the week.
---
Ha yeah that's true. This was back in the stress tests though and, at the time, was made up. From memory I think they even said they could take control of your character too.
---
Looks like reality was inspired by fiction with the aimbot in NW.
---
Really don't know why people bother making up all this stuff about the game. It has issues. We don't need fake ones added.
---
Internet is the best I can get in my area and the only thing I can upgrade in the PS4 is the hard drive which other PS4 players only provides a marginal reduction in copy time.
---
I hope the Excavator PA carry weight bug comes back.
---
What are you talking about Skipper?
---
Under normal circumstances I‚Äôd say no, but it does sound like the designs are ready and could‚Äôve been pushed with Patch 16, so possibly? It‚Äôs entirely possible they might remove some atom challenges and replace them with other obtainable like badges or other stuff. I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôd increase atom drops for normal challenges then though. All in all I don‚Äôt know when it comes to Bethesda anymore. I feel used
---
Sad that so many people have been burned by assholes they teamed up with in the past.  I only send team invites because you're halfway across the map and I don't want to pay 40 caps to shop at your place if I don't have to.
---
But I'd say 85-90% of my team requests get turned down.
---
Here‚Äôs the forum post on the update:
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376573/complete-small-update-for-consoles-december-17-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
Oops, I meant office pc. Sorry about that
---
You can get an item off vendors called an Assaultron Recall Curcuitboard or something like that and then craft it into a new keycard.  Try getting a team that knows what they're doing and then start the event.  One person per pylon and other people from the server showing up to at least deal damage should work out.
---
Are the only ways to restart the event by joining an existing one or to build a new assaultron recall keycard at the Tinker Workbench?
---
Try to activate it in the launcher. Where I bought mine in was stated to active it in the launcher
---
When Wastelanders launches a bunch of players who bought FO76 at release will hop into the game,  realize the games it's still too buggy to enjoy and then never touch it again.
---
Thank you
---
Even just what you said is pretty fucking bad for a company as big and (at least used to be) renowned as Bethesda.
---
I'm just salty they have it ready and I still have to server hop for stupid radscorpions.  I'm going to just hammer their servers out of spite!
---
Thank you for this advice! Just put 400 pounds on my first mule.
---
You are my new favorite person, one dude, multiple upvotes!
---
You have to buy a recall keycard circuit board. Train station vendors have them and they run from 1650-2200 caps depending on your charisma, equipped perks, and chem effects.
---
Then you go to tinkers workbench and craft a Assultron recall keycard. Then you go to the ambush site and do the computer thing over.
---
Make sure people are aware that Encrypted is taking place. Dont do like I do fuck it and send it (blindly launch the event). No one will show up and if someone does show up its not enough to do it.
---
Why do you come here why are you even here you clearly hate the Game why come here
---
Don‚Äôt rely on stims for that event, unless you have a stack of Super Stims, you get faster and fuller healing from Scorchbeast foods and Nuka Quantums. 
---
Remember too, that most people who show up will be jumping from whatever they‚Äôre doing, so they may not have a bunch of healing items on them. If you trigger the event, expect to be the one to tank the pylons. Obviously, you wouldn‚Äôt have known that the first time through, but hopefully it helps going forward.
---
So In order to get the holiday tree, do I have to get all 750XP in one match or can It be multiple matches?
---
Summary of what you said: "Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
---
My bad wrong conversation sorry
---
Do you mean like a mule or functioning carry weight?
---
I'm not defending them, I just don't care. It's just a game, and I come here to enjoy it with others not read whiny posts about how there are bugs in a videogame. You bought a buggy product from a company known to make buggy products, then waste precious mental effort enraging yourselves over it? Go play a different game, chalk the purchase up to a learning experience you should have learned the last time you bought from Bethesda. This is exactly the product I expected, and yet I enjoy it all the same.
---
To add, perhaps I am lucky but I have only once encountered someone hacking in F76 and I have been playing since launch. Contrast that to Rockstars GTA Online where every second session is completely ruined by someone spawning explosions or a dozen aggressive clones on everyone and I don't see their subreddit full of negative nancies every day.
---
Its the americans
---
The game is, still, on a moral metric, not good. Does having slightly better, but still bad, anti-cheat, make any difference?
---
Just trying to be positive, seems everything around this game is negative right now.
---
This issue has been in the game since... day one? Have you submitted a ticket??
---
It should tell you to go to the pioneer scout camp or something and find the robot playing the trumpet. It‚Äôs the place up north, east of grafton below the cemetery I think. East edge of the big lake
---
I‚Äôm just curios if you just do it for fun to troll that‚Äôs fine I just want to know the reason
---
Exposing Bethesda's incompetence is not trolling.
---
VATS supported by lots of Agility, Action Boy/Girl, Critical Shot, and any AP bonus armor you can acquire.  
---
A focus on vanilla leather crafting will unlock AP mods pretty quick...
---
Hey no problem! Happy it still works :)
---
Perhaps they support the game then.
---
guess im blind

---
Functioning carry weight. Like if I wanted to not be overemcumbered.
---
I have a quad ffr plasma flamer. It holds the standard amount unless you switch it back to a rifle, then its quad ammo.
---
 But why what‚Äôs the point what are you trying to do fallout 76 will die faster and be shut down like you want if you don‚Äôt report issues
---
My FE plasma gatling creates Godmode also when I go acid runs, always at toxic larrys. Dam energy weapons.
---
Use a drawer beside a train station workbench. Has worked flawlessly a dozen times.
---
&gt; Hit detection is client side but there are server side checks.
---
Does this causes the explosive shotgun "ghost damage" thing?
---
Also, IIRC total ammo count is server-side yet current clip ammo count is client-side.
---
Yea you can do as many matches as you need to get it. shouldn't take long. Even if you're not good at Pvp you can earn around 250-300 xp per match just by surviving. Get into the top 10 &amp; you'll get around 500-600xp...on average.
---
Because I play the fucking game and therefore have al the legal rights to say whatever I want about it? Who are you to tell me what I am allowes to post about?
---
voila?
---
Super bummed but happy I don't have to grind nw this go around. I'll just stick around for the fallout Charlie brown tree and presents
---
Once I was setup with a carry capacity of 520 lbs.  that was being a bloodied build, unyielding armour with deep pockets and the HC backpack. It could of been much higher as I didn‚Äôt aim to tweak it as far as it could go.. there were other perk cards I‚Äôm sure I could of used plus chems and food
---
Bluffs are awesome spots. Usually nice and flat, have great walk ups, and amazing views.
---
It's the same.
---
bend tunnel should do.
---
I can't have a scrap bot on one of my characters. No matter what it's under attack, even if I scrap it all and start fresh.
---
To be fair the update takes like an hour to copy over and install
---
Who is that? I know that name
---
I agree, first come, first served. 
---
Bethesda needs to find a better way to manage camp location duplication. One way to do it is to open up more servers so there's less chance for duplication. They're not going to because it costs more and it makes the game look dead.
---
Nobody has proved him wrong, all they say is "it's old code". That doesn't have any facts or evidence to back it up now does it? Bethesda has run this game, their company and their shit engine into the ground, stop defending awful EA like business practices and shit quality of game development.
---
Yes.  I was already expecting to pay for the private servers.  everything else - especially the monthly atoms - are just a bonus.
---
Actress: Escape From New York, Swamp Thing.
---
Yeah, you need a busy server and click around on peeps and make sure there are plenty of highs and not just 150s, often it‚Äôs us in 200 and 300s that need to come in and kick some ass.
---
I'd imagine well over 600. I can do 550 bloodied with 2 perks for additional carryweight, full unyeilding gear and radicool. You could add rad ant lager for an additional 50 and that's already at 600.
---
Yesss! That‚Äôs badass I love carpenter,  I knew I recognized her name
---
Considering how much atom challenges have improved I‚Äôm ok with this delay.  I haven‚Äôt had to take a picture with Grahm and the responder bot underwater and naked in a long time.   Boy was that a wild  night.
---
Yeah. She‚Äôs kind of an icon.
---
Forgot to mention with deep pocketed armor and high capacity backpack.
---
Chances are those dudes came in just to farm the robots for scrap and did not care about the event at all.
---
This is why I put mine as close to existing locations as I can I've noticed you can place them much closer then camps but that bubble size needs reduced for the tents
---
Hell yeah dude well I didn‚Äôt  know that. Pretty cool thing to find out
---
For the outside, I play on the game on console, it sure seems like Fallout 76 on PC is done.
---
I think the naked picture in nuke zone was around not too long ago though.
---
Spank live
---
Not the gumdrop buttons!!!
---
Todd howard made sure its unlimited, buy as many as you can afford and then a couple more
---
I swear I heard one tell me to run. As if it didn't want to attack me but the hivemind forced it to. I have noticed their new posture and walk as well. Maybe we are imagining things or they are slowly breaking fra from the bitch's influence.
---
&gt;Maybe wastelanders will be that turn idk.
---
Wastelanders will be the end I think of any attempt to rectify this game in Bethesda's eyes. Can you imagine what an absolute clusterfuck that update is going to be, when they've got people spawning in *Preston Garvey &amp; the fucking Prydwen* right now?
---
Yeah right, the important things.
---
Oops. Almost forgot the original The Fog.
---
If it is im happy about it. It will be a huge challenge.
---
&gt;The community is to blame as well for encouraging this crud.
---
Exactly, these things wouldn't be happening if this community didn't keep giving Bethesda the benefit of the doubt for the nth time.
---
Hit 'em where it hurts people, their wallets, and expect to see a seachange from them in the coming years. Keep accepting this sort of laziness and cynicism, and the futures of Starfield, Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5 are not shining too brightly.
---
You don't need to read the poster. Just head to the Grafton dam and keep following the road. Other side of the lake you will hear where to go.
---
You won‚Äôt have enough info as of today to crack the code
---
I tried it but it did not work.
---
Damn thanks man
---
Making anti-cheat software is hard.  Bethesda did the right thing by making a fairly robust client/server model instead of relying on AC.  I spent weeks reverse engineering FO4 prior to the launch of FO76 because I expected FO76's netcode to be a mess and I thought I'd be able to spawn items and give myself God mode and stuff like that, but in the end all I was able to do was noclip and sometimes kill stuff without having ammo.  They did a pretty good job, not counting all the bugs.
---
Compare that to GTA5 which lets you shoot airplanes out of your gun, or the Arma series which lets me tell the server that YOU shot the OP and the server just accepts that as truth and carries out the killing.  Or, my magnum opus in the Arma games - you can send a message to the server to apply an instantaneous force to an object, so I made a system to throw cars at people from the sky.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vChZI4Xbh3U
---
I have done that one a couple times, and people avoid the pylons like the plague. So many people want to play as a bloody build with 20% health, and won't last or won't use their stimpaks. 
---
What system are you on?  You can probably find people here to join in.
---
Its possibly something wrong with the update they rolled out today. My game won't even make it to the main menu before crashing to dashboard and I've tried everything
---
If you aren‚Äôt cheating you need a keyword cypher to decrypt the code, and the cyphers aren‚Äôt really available until day 5-7.
---
I just got that plan today along with the plasma grenade plan.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat thank you hughesnet üòÇüòÇ
---
Anyone one with even a passing interest in this industry should realize the fact that this even shipped with a game is ridiculous. And that the 1 year later change is doing the same thing in a slightly different way. But glad you can shit all over him for something you don't understand.
---
25001 XP, I believe.
---
I get it, they do exagerate stuff but that doesn't mean that they're actually lying. 
---
Taking everything with a grain of salt is a great idea.
---
Which one of these issues is a misrepresentation of fo76 gameplay?
---
1. New subscription thingy. 
---
2. Loss of armor while reloading.
---
3. More and more gameplay affecting items being sold in the atomic shop.
---
4. Item spawning cheats.
---
Yeah if I have 5 bullets in my inventory I can set my clip ammo to 99 and fire 99 times, but those first 5 shots will eat up those 5 bullets.  This ended up not being super useful except for the double barreled shotgun since I didn't have to reload every 2 shots, so I could kill stuff really quickly whether with real or ghost ammo.
---
I don't know what you're referring to with regards to the explosive shotgun ghost damage thing.  If I'm using ghost damage and it doesn't work, what happens is the shot goes off, the enemy's health bar goes down, but then goes back up as if it had healed.  In reality it never actually went down at all, the mob doesn't die in this case even if I appear to lower its HP way below 0.
---
I like it!üëçüèº I love seeing what people do with the increased budget at workshops!
---
So some background, basically what happened was I joined a server with my friends. It was laggy so I went to go reset my internet and could not get back on after
---
(a) Have the base model Fridge and junk collectron made free
---
(b) make the tent and scrapbox available to all players who bought the game
---
(c) have an injunction against non cosmetic items for a period deemed reasonable by the courts given their pre launch commitments. I know you dislike the Pete Hines tweet example, but it was referenced in several places:
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s00w_8YrDcxwVYlgCkjQxKr5dS42v47E/view?usp=drivesdk
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a7MY_OOR1su0dhVx-9PoGaCEV8KI5x7P/view?usp=drivesdk
---
It'd be cool to have a camp guestbook with maybe some preset messages you can send like "cool camp!"
---
no one has maxed it yet
---
Yeah I know but thought Reddit or the internet would have solved it by Now
---
Ok, Todd.
---
It is old code, that portion of the code has changed a bit(which he admitted himself in another post) the purpose is still the same. To check for programs such as cheat engine that are running.
---
Hes just acting like its the *only* code that is dedicated to preventing cheating, which is false. The rest of the anti-cheat code is still pretty shit but its better than what the guy is claiming.
---
The top comment itself links to [this post](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/2493051-post1.html) that goes over some of the other anti-cheat functions in the game.
---
I‚Äôve seen them saying new things too!
---
Crops seem to take up a quite a bit of budget also.
---
And i'm afraid that even if every single bug gets squashed, Wastelanders won't be enough to fix the bad reputation this game has.
---
I'm also doubting that the quests are going to be on par with the ones in FO3/NV/4... At this point playing Fallout 4 is a better idea... You can even get extra content from mods...
---
No one gives a shit about there free stuff? Wow, I didn‚Äôt realize you talked for everyone.
---
This is like GTA Online all over again, at least GTA kinda tries to catch people.
---
No, but I am not saying it is. OP here seems to want to intentionally spread misinformation to make people dislike Bethesda which is silly when the reality would be enough. 
---
I mean even the dude to originally write the post about the cheat has this to say about his post and claims: 
---
&gt;OP is full of it. The anti cheat is bad, but not as bad as op is claiming. Lots of people lie about how bad the client server model of the game is with regards to cheating...
---
I think Bethesda deserves criticism for their anti-cheat and other things like Fallout 1st, etc. But it really isn't that hard to stay honest whilst doing so, there is enough genuinely bad stuff that we don't have to resort to misleading people
---
So many white knights defending bugthesda. Pathetic
---
I drop in about once every month or two, and I always experience games breaking bugs with 15 minutes of play.  It's sad because I was 100% a true believer.
---
Well, thing is, we KNOW it does this, so usually whomever gets home first on Tuesdays just fires up the PS4.   But we forgot the last two weeks.
---
These updates, tiny updates, have taken an HOUR to complete, because the PS4 is a crappy installation machine!!!  So, we're partly to blame. :D
---
I'm trying to finish the PA sets also, but the Raider plans refuse to drop.  1 Plasma Grenade, 3 Plasma Mine so far along with other assorted rares from the list.
---
Bloodied anything...Bloodied Fixer Explosive...Bloodied Explosive AR...Bloodied Swing Speed Gauntlet...Bloodied Swing Speed Meathook...Bloodied Swing Speed Super Sledge
---
Settlement DLC? Nothing is persistent yet.
---
Where are you at now? If you‚Äôre asking this you may have more than anyone else so YOUR max might help solve THE max.
---
What is there to support? A cash grab?
---
im not a programmer or anything but the "revised" version just looks the same as the anti cheat they had a year ago. OP you should update your post because rather than admit the new anti cheat is no better and pretty much the same, shills seem to want to nail you with the inaccurate info as a way to discredit you rather than actually dispute your post. its easier to pick apart a post's "inaccuracies" than it is to prove OP is wrong.
---
Touch√©, one upvote to you.
---
Replace your console's drive with an SSD or even just get an external SSD.  Decimates the time :)
---
If I take off my armor and undo the cards, I'm well over 1800lbs.  With them on I'm at 140.
---
Weapon weight gear, armor, aid, food, and energy weight reduction cards.
---
Armored backpack, no deep pockets.
---
Fallout 76 is a great experiment from a development perspective, but they really should treat it as such and not as a big, high quality product because it is anything but.
---
Best bet is to scrip legendaries and try your luck with the legendary vendor.
---
The "new" one is pretty much the same thing save from some hex.
---
&gt;At what point can we have a hacking Olympics? 
---
I mean it seems like they're already off to the raes.
---
Best to run sneak with suppressed weapons. U get up to 3.75x dmg at night and 2.5x during the day. Just a normal combat riffle with a suppressor or a Fixer
---
It works fine for me.
---
Everything is RNG. Just take all Legendary items to the Purveyor for a better chance at good weapons. Try Blackpowder rifles for damage.
---
I love your answer. You got my up vote.
---
What do you use
---
I'll try that since I can easily get low level lehendaries bevaude of the Christmas event
---
Thanks I'll try that didn't know about the night sneak multiplyer
---
I forgot about blackpowder rifles... üòì I'll try those
---
Some have this problem, yes, but if you don't get it right in year 1 you might as well forget about it, theres no turning the economy around and the game is permanently fucked.
---
See David Brevik talk about D1.
---
I'm still after gorilla, glowing one, and radscorpion.  Have multiples of basically everything else.
---
^ honestly you want a squad
---
Junkies is also popular.
---
I‚Äôve got 9800 currently.
---
You might be on to something. I've noticed the same behavior.
---
You don‚Äôt lose armour when reloading and whoever said that is just flat out lying. Also any ‚Äúgameplay affecting items‚Äù have almost no value whatsoever for examplethe robot that collects scrap is a cosmetic first item as it give the ability to have another entity besides yourself at the CAMP and the scrap/repair kits can all be earned ingame and intact are better than the ones found in the store.
---
ayyyyy
---
they open up at 1 per day
---
These multipliers are perk based.  The base is 2x sneak dmg.
---
They buffed acid damage a ton when the raids first came out, probably to add some artificial difficulty
---
Bloodied is king of all effects rn. Riffles with sneak are my favorite and they give very good dmg. Melee is the only thing that out dmgs it tho.
---
Laterns and the small potted plants as well as mounted heads
---
wait until you go for the emote like the few of us that have, thats true suffering right there
---
Thats kinda wack, id expect them to at least release the first 2 together seeing as the wreath is only 1xp
---
Have you 'found' any better/HUDless shots by chance? I want some of those for my Fallout folder. I can't help but imagine a crusade into Appalachia after the end of FO4 now. A shame about the tower clipping but eh, nothing is perfect.
---
Instigating Knuckles, with 40% power attack damage. Getting one with +1 Strength as well would be even better.
---
That would be perfect, since Bethesda's servers aren't the best
---
It depends on how fast your internet actually is. Mine only takes about 10~15min to complete for a 20gb update or up. But yeah the ps4 system does get more slow the more stuff you have on it. Gallery, games act.
---
Can you wait until the end like the Halloween ones or do you actually have to get one a day?
---
Sounds good! I'll PM some of my availability and we can see when to meet up
---
Believe it or not but some people like challenge and when you do hit the mark you will be one of a few who did it.
---
Game wants to be an mmo it needs more hard to get Grundy stuff.
---
There are so many fucking Bethesda white knights in these comments.
---
Challenge =/= Grind.
---
There's nothing challenging about sitting in a bush for 20 mins.
---
Personally with the high cap back back I can carry 560 as of right now. That‚Äôs with deep pocketed everything and level 3 of strong back
---
The game kind of bashes itself these days.
---
This post is underappreciated. I dig it.
---
Use unarmed melee if you can it does more dmg than anything
---
I thought a dude who was almost level 800‚Äôs camp look kinda meh for such a high level but I still told him it looked nice and he was really happy about it. Told me why he made it the way he did and what he was going for.
---
Blackpowders are the most powerful outside of specialty builds like bloodied. If you get a BE Blackpowder rifle, you can reach 1300 damage and 2600 sneak. Or, a BE The Dragon can do 2100 or 4200 damage sneak.
---
I love building and after building several different types of houses on my main character, I finally settled on a simple two story house. Kitchen and living room downstairs, bedroom upstairs with a little porch too.
---
My "garage" holds all the workbenches (except my brewing station since it won't fit...I just have it on the side). I used the garage door and the metal walls (not the heavy ones but the ratty looking ones) to really make it feel like a garage/workshop.
---
Connected to my garage (since my house isn't connected to it, but nearby it) is a small 4x4 room. It's my Nuka Cola museum. I have all the flavors on display as well as the junk items like the Quantum Bear. I also have the posters/clock and lights up. And outside I have a vendor selling the Nuka World outfits as well as Nuka Cola and Nuka Cola Cherry.
---
Originally I had it as a toy museum because I love collecting the bears and board games but I really love Nuka Cola so I switched it out.
---
So some tips...if you can call them that...is to keep it simple. Build something that makes you happy. Don't build to impress others.
---
Unless you're into roleplaying, you don't need a bathroom. So save space and don't put one in. And really unless you're a low level/don't have healing factor...you don't need a bed to heal so cut the bedroom out too.
---
Watch out on displays, they take up a TON of space in your camp and in your stash. Every single item takes up room.
---
The forest is a good place to build, low level enemies if they spawn in...and wide open/flat spaces.
---
Crops take up a TON of space...so unless you really need a glue farm, don't plant crops.
---
And not sure if this is true or not but at least it seems to be...wires cost less then conduits. I tried to fix my wiring so it would look better in my camp but I wasn't able to do it because my budget was too full.
---
Just wanted to double check, it‚Äôs sometimes hard to tell on mobile. The body of your posts shows removed for me. Looks like your post was deleted by a mod or the auto mod. You may want to look into it if you have a chance.
---
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what did the body of your post say about the bat?
---
I need 200 more I have done it like 20 time the 2and 3 vault raid.

*continues weeping*

It's there a trick? Even this week you've got to do the robots first before you get to them
---
It's going to be a trash movie anyway

You pop serums instead of just running starched genes makes no sense whatsoever...  DCG with 976 base damage is horrible...You need to work on that build....Blocker is terrible and you only need 1 point in perception,  move those points to endurance where you are missing rejuvenated, max ironclad and life giver (all damage, hp and agi boosts)....Your grenade build makes no sense with all of those cards being wasted (put them for starched genes)....Sorry, I just do not see a great build here...Needs some major tweeks....Just so you have a base to look at....I run a Unstoppable Monster (1240 base dmg) and a Bloodied Boxing glove (puncturing at 852 base damage)....My HP is 460...My base dmg resist is 507 and carry weight is 500..... I also carry a BE Lever action that does 350 dmg with 1 point in rifleman...I know people have different builds for different things but I just think you are missing out on a tom of the perks of running a bloodied melee build...I can sneak through Westec with my boxing glove one punching every super mutant and not have one shot fired at me.....have a great day!!
---
It just be like that sometimes; they say it don't be like it is, but it do.
---
5 pieces of weapon weight reduction gear. 2 points in bandolier, 2 in sturdy frame, 3 for stims, sometimes 2 in pack rat, all in strength, 3 for energy ammo in per., and 3 for thru hiker in agility.
---
for the emote at least i went in meltdowns reactor room solo in novice, 0-3 ants/wave and you can get about 20 before respawns stop, then id hop out and reset.
---
for the frame, we just had to bite the bullet and work through robots -&gt; residential -&gt; reset.  both the frame and emote were painful even with those two ant strategies
---
Hey u/MisterWoodhouse why was this post removed? Seems like the community was fairly interested in it and having rather civil discussion compared to some other posts.
---
&gt;shills
---
Shut. Up.
---
There's no need to dismiss people as shills just because you don't like what they're saying. Stop being insecure and ignorant.
---
You are the least reliable opinion on this - you constantly use Reddit as your source materials. Go back to making knee-jerk videos on YouTube, fraud.
---
It is wack, this is how they did the Halloween rewards as well. I think the rewards system when Morgantown first came out was the best implementation.
---
You never lost your armor when reloading. The legendary effect just stopped working and they hotfixed it already.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.

To add for those who don‚Äôt want to venture clear to drop site V9, harpers ferry right at the entrance of train tunnel is a super irradiated spot between the forklift and the yellow barrels, over 127 rads per second, a camp can be dropped here as well to make mutation farming relatively easy

 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2019 experienced snow in October five out the last eight years.  Doesn't seem very uncommon to me.

What is your damage with those?  My bloodied boxing glove does about 860 base damage.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Yet another classic example of the Reddit hive mind at work and why you shouldn't believe ANYTHING you see on this website, let alone the media, without doing your own research.

This even got gilded hahahahahah
---
What? Several of the recent topics had reddit posts that were citing my videos as examples. Not sure where your response is coming from man
---
&gt;I'm the author of the writeup.
---
Ahem. Source?
---
I love this idea
---
I do love that. I always like to let people know i like their camp. i know how much work goes into them :) I build and rebuild my camp often and its always nice to know people enjoy what i end up with
---
I have 16k.
---
Blocker is not terrible, especially on what looks like a bloodied build. I agree with the perception thing though.
---
Yes I just noticed that when logging on today!
---
Awh I‚Äôm over here scratching my head why I don‚Äôt see any challanges to do how much xp for first one?
---
I am not going to read that incoherent novel.
---
Find a location that has potential.  Bad spot = mediocre build.
---
Don't build on a floating staircase.
---
After that .... you can't do any wrong.  Enjoy what you do.  Love being at your CAMP.  Best part of this game over FO4 settlements?  You get to show off what you build, and visit an unbelievable assortment of creativity and incredible wealth of clever design.

What was about the camp that looked odd? Out of curiosity
---
Long before release of the game, you dished out video after video of attention-grabbing content with thumbnails and video titles. I couldn't stomach you by month 6 of 76's release. If you had a change of heart, I'm down to hear/see it, but I'll keep a packet of salt to go along with it.
---
I pretty much stick to one spot and constantly edit.
---
Oh well
---
Wait, so, the only currency in this game that isn't capped is the hardest to earn in game? Is it just me or does that seem backwards?
---
Bug started at patch 15. Relogging should fix it.
---
But why would that lead you to referring to me as a fraud now and stating something that you're not totally sure is true? I understand how I kind of went over board at release with the game, but that was quite literally over a year ago now and I think my content has come a long way since then. 
---
It feels like you read my comment and saw my name and made a knee jerk reaction just to try to be hurtful even though you don't know if what you are saying in the comment is true at all (anymore). I imagine you would be pretty frustrated if you saw someone evaluating Fallout 76 based off the state it was in 1 year ago, so why would you not apply that to my channel also?
---
Then why bother writing robust client side cheat detection when it should be on the server anyway?
---
There I fixed it for you...Don't get your feelings hurt if you did not like not having paragraphs....I am trying to help you out....

---
I was just thinking where the snow machine at, as I was placing down a dozen aluminum trees aimlessly in my back yard.
---
Bloodied if you are a bloodied rifle build...It is not even close
---
9140, I am just curious if there is a, well, cap on atoms lol. Looks like I am not alone in hoarding atoms.
---
ü§°
---
Lol well that's my handle which is the same as my Reddit username. 
---
You can see the writeup on my shitty blog here: https://douggemhax.wordpress.com/2019/06/13/how-to-get-caught-by-fallouts-anti-cheat/  which was posted on the same day as the UC post
---

You can see submissions from that Youtube channel going back 7 years in my Reddit history.  
---
If you have a UC account you could PM me if you REALLY want to be sure.
---
 wow, just wow lol
---
What legendary effects on the armor?
---
Big bend tunnel and the Galleria should level for you...
---
Much better to do it at Blackwater mine, that place even has a rad scrubber.
---
Instigating explosive if you are like me and run a full Health build with sneak.
---
1xp for the first one, which is a wreath.
---
Getting regular floors down at foundation level
---
You'll need two sets of stairs leading to the second floor. First set attached to the foundation, and a second set that goes down from the second floor. Once you attach a regular floor to the second set of stairs, you can keep attaching floors to it to expand the first level. Can be really handy for suspended camp designs, or for hiding resource extractors/purifiers inside of a building.
---
What now? Increased budget?is that what the update is I'm DL?
---
Wastelanders will never drop
---
Didn't she also voice Delphine from Skyrim and the railroad lady in FO4?
---
The difference between this and the halloween one being, according to the wording of the announcement, you HAVE to unlock ome rewars to get the next thing. You can't leave it for seven days and then do it all cumulatively. Which is stupid, considering how high the xp will probably end up being for each one.
---
You're right, the VTU morgantown rewards were the best system.
---
How do you switch?
---
apparently
---
If they want it to be challenging they should base it off NW wins, or "reach last 10 players alive X amount of times." Making it XP based is just a time sink, barely a grind.
---
Alright, I'm a believer
---
Moonshiner would be a nice one üòÇ
---
Yeah we need that. Like a mail box would be cool
---
Why farm mutations? You can find the exact ones you want relatively cheap in player vendors. 200-500 caps to get the exact ones you want is worth it.
---
Because I‚Äôm saving caps for plans
---
Alright just got it so one will be unlocked each day for the next six days, do we have clue how much the last one will require I‚Äôm reading from other people it‚Äôs 25k do you know anything about that
---
Also, i suppose mutation recommendations would be nice
---
Based on the way they worded it, no. Which makes it even stupider than the halloween event.
---
It checks nearly every single box, and I'm saying nearly not because I can think of anything, but because I'm sure you have some contradictions.
---
I think it's 25k total to get all the rewards, not 25k to just get the last one. But I could be wrong.
---
Was like this during beta too
---
So no improvement
---
I don‚Äôt see those under her credits, but could be.
---
Scrap kits cannot be earned in game, only repair kits. Also cosmetic "first" or not, it definitely is a non-cosmetic item.
---
Also I am sure he meant loss of armor effects when reloading guns, which patch 16 originally broke.
---
It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt really odd. It‚Äôs was just a sort of generic log cabin. Nothing wrong with that. When I saw his level I teleported to his base because I was expecting something crazy. My expectations were just really high lol.
---
My bad yeah that‚Äôs what I meant 25k to get all of them were has that number came from? Has it been data mined or confirmed I can‚Äôt seem find to find it anywhere
---
Nope.
---
What about drinks and chems?
---
Congrats! So that‚Äôs how it looks like in the rewards...
---
Ah yeah I know what you mean. Someone with that high a level probably doesn't spend much time at camp.
---
No max. I've seen the BGS community managers stream and they have like 35k or more. 
---
Considering you can buy atoms with actual money, they would be stupid to cap it.
---
Look in the Red Rocket workshop, I think? It's in one of the store areas on a bottom shelf.
---
Workshop budget not C. A. M. P budget
---
So if I‚Äôm running windbg, it will flag me as a cheater?  Shit
---
Vault boy on the shelf
---
Don't do Encryptid without a proper team, most randos don't activate pylons because they're selfish jerks.
---
I gave up. I was feeling like a sucker, after 4 months of maining the game. I held out hope that it was going to get better over time, because it was Bethesda. It didn't, I wasted money on it.  As someone who picks up a MMO and plays for years I won't be going back. People are now paying for premium features that should have been available from the launch. 
---
Fuck Bethesda, I won't pay for another release.
---
You can also display the drumstick.
---
Thank you for the clarification.
---
Not really a fan of the Vault Boy cutouts since they seem out of place. Maybe if there were also distressed versions available?
---
I run full bloodied, but if I turn up at Encryptid I'm always a plylon because I have loads of Stimpaks so why not use them. No point being bloodied at that event anyway, you'll just die repeatedly and end up taking a minute to repawn every time.
---
As a Punching build I NEEEEED Candy Claw Paws. It looks sick
---
I run bloody build as a low level when I‚Äôm leveling and I still do pretty decent :) lose out on radicool tho
---
There is a distressed one if you count the scared running away vault boy cut out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Where is any other faction stuff besides Free States?
---
Thank you, both for saving me the atoms, and for the laugh! :)
---
I would run handmade cuz u can make it commando with sneak. I use bloodied with unyielding armor for bonuses to sneak, ap, and carry weight. Mutation wise I would run adrenal, birdbones, Marsupial, eagle eyes, scaly skin, and speed demon.
---
Was the wreath only 1 xp for everyone else?
---
This is how I feel about the Santatron collector. üò£ He's so loud and talks all the time.
---
What exactly is wrong with this post?
---
Praise the Todd Man.
---
Can anyone tell me where to find the Souvenir Teddy Bear? I thought it was in one of the school busses behind Watoga Station, but now that I want one to display, I can't find it.
---
Because they're features you should have had from the start. If it was F2P, sure. But players buy atoms, they've spent a lot on the game, they'll spend a lot on the upcoming dlc and do it because it's a franchise they love. But nothing worked the way it was supposed to. The game failed to make money like it was supposed to, and rather than rewarding loyal, loving players whole have stuck with it, they are offering to make the game better by charging a subscription. I think that blows.
---
Addressed this in an earlier comment
---
Not a huge PVPer. I run into hackers majority of the time playing monster mash.
---
Was just wondering if there was anything new I hadn't heard of. Doesn't look like it
---
Depends
---
How much money do you have?
---
Sure.  I'm an evangelical gamer the same way you are. I get convinced that fortnite players are invading the destiny subreddit, just like you are convinced that someone asking about your game, is a conspiratorial snake.
---
At this point, if you're defending Fallout 76 you're just a shill.
---
You can get it as a reward from the ‚Äúplaytime‚Äù daily in Berkeley Springs...also usually one in the doghouse at Losthome in the bog
---
Check out you custom ini. If you have any mods listed, just comment them out (put a ;  before the list).
---
I got the Santa
---
It's an unmentioned part of the Santa outfit in the atomic shop.
---
I liked the idea of a faster closing circle. That way still lots of loot to be had and still faster play.
---
If you have a perk equipped that someone else shares, you don‚Äôt get double the effects. If you equip heavy gunner and your friend shares it, you still only get a 20% increase.
---
We've all read that Kotaku post about hackers spawning in NPCs. It seems bad and very scummy, which in a sense it is, but you gotta realize how sad it is that hackers were able to add in NPCs faster than Bethesda can. Yeah they're not complete NPCs but they've got the framework and the foundation for something promising while Bethesda is just adding overpriced stuff to the atom shop. I honestly can't help but side with the hackers on this one since they're more or less just showing everyone how sloppy Bethesda is getting with their anti-cheat.   
---
Now I won't side with the ones who ruin Nuclear Winter since they've got unfair advantages against people with no counter to them. Doesn't help anyone just ruins people's days.
---
No, you are capped at 3 points.
---
It doesn't hurt any build, but most of the other third effects are a lot more useful. That being said, I don't think it stacks with any other speed buff
---
Learn it, then if you get another sell it.  They seems to be pretty common so the price has gone down a lot.
---
It works out to the net benefit
---
I thought that it was still ultra rare. I have not seen one forever. Thank you for the information.
---
He is using screenshots that come from an article from over a year ago talking about the anticheat in the game, and trying to stir things up for some reason. He dodges anyone who asks why he wouldn't use up to date information by basically saying its "too complicated for people to understand."
---
I just got it for a good price since I'm not on long enough to farm a lot of presents.  I read it for that exact reason....for that badge. Now I have an armored backpack as a result too!
---
Well... it's not quite additive the way you were expecting **BUT** there was a trick benefit for having multiple teammates share Super-Duper while crafting.  
---
The way the trick works, is you get say a full team of four, all with Super Duper.  When they craft, the game engine treats each shared version as a separate check for proccing Super-Duper.  So each person crafts something in the bench, and the game checks four times for each individual crafting.  Statistically speaking the chances of a proc when checked four times, become practically assured and so you benefit from the extra crafted result.
---
Thanks. How is DC, Rectum and the gang?
---
It was ultra rare. But now all the rare event plans drop pretty commonly from presents. Like the ultracite Gatling laser plan was a rare reward from the line in the sand event And was pretty valuable. I‚Äôve already gotten three between two characters. After the event though the price will rise back up slowly.
---
That is one of the most sought after plans in the game. SUPER RARE! At one point there were loads of players trying to get that plan. If price check if I were you to get a feel for the market.   Good luck!
---
Damn, wish I had that available right now, I guess I'm spending a lot too, have 12 @ the moment
---
I have a ton of Fox heads. My friend got a Mothman head. The strangest one I have gotten so far is the honey beast head.
---
Chameleon doesn‚Äôt work in this game, other than visually, so you want armor with sneak on it. 
---
If you are going for max stealth damage, I‚Äôd go with a Bloodied Rifleman build.  Get a BE Lever Action as your long range weapon and a B25 (faster fire rate) Handmade for everything else.  If bloodied, get a full set of Unyielding armor,and your stats will be off the charts (meaning you will sneak VERY well). So with this build you don‚Äôt really need sneak bonuses on your armor unless you are having issues with breaking stealth. 
---
If you prefer to play full health, get an Instigating Lever and the best Handmade you can afford (AA, Quad, Furious, Instigating, Vampires, etc.) The key to a full health build is you *need* an Instigating Lever, even just a 1* one.
---
lmao "If cheating... stop it"
---
Why scaly skin?  I wouldn‚Äôt want to give up 50 AP myself.
---
Are you kidding? I wanted it for that veru reason lol
---
Not too bad.  I just got back on after moving and my connection up in the mountains is pretty shitty.  As a result, my communication with them is limited at best. It seems the microphone is the first to go, lol
---
My feelings aren't hurt I posted this for DeathGod your opinion means nothing to me.
---
Through hiker also does drinks, the part where he said 3 for stims is the traveling pharmacy Park and it does all chems not just stims
---
All of the wood armour.
---
Totally agree.  Considering the tent can be plopped down anywhere at will, a camp should take precedence over a tent.
---
A simple notification in the upper left saying your tent was displaced would be totally fine.
---
I still think the tent should have a cool down, say once an hour.  It‚Äôs way too easy to treat as a pack mule and abuse as a mobile platform for SBQ.  I say this as a 1st subscriber.
---
It gives u 50dr and 50er, turns to 62 with strange in numbers. Use class freak to loose the negative effects.
---
Same here. I go up to 50% health, take a pylon or two and spam away at the stimpaks. Jump up on the roof and get a few potshots in. On some random moments when the imposter is low I can drop down and deal some real damage. It‚Äôs my favorite event!
---
How many AP do you lose with Class Freak up?
---
12 ap is what I loose but I sit at 450 ish ap with uny armor
---
I recall the listed weapon damage as being 166, though I'm not sure if that's really accurate. This is without a knuckle mod. There's no modifiers from armor since I fight naked on this character, as well as  none from food or beverage since I rely on cannibalism and the odd stimpak for healing. No drugs as well. 
---
I do have Iron Fist and Bloody Mess equipped, as well the the Talons and Twisted Muscles mutations. Other damage perks and mutations are things like Tenderizer, Adrenaline, and Adrenal Reaction, though those wouldn't affect the listed damage until they kick in I'm guessing.
---
All attacks I do are either regular or power attacks; no sneak attacks whatsoever.
---
Right on man. It's a walk in the park with a partner. I can solo them, but it takes a minute.
---
I appreciate the info and know most want a vats, reload or RW on ranged but I feel it‚Äôs better than the plus perception and crit fill/ap on heavies. Especially when dealing with large mobs or SB that love to dart around I feel it‚Äôd be a useful third. As a heavy user weight isn‚Äôt a big deal and and speed demon covers the rld so maybe it‚Äôs better suited for heavy builds if it stacks with speed demon.
---
A TSE harpoon gives me 1569 damage with full health.  It's a beast.
---
I feel the same way when it comes to supporting the game.  So much of the gaming community is made up of young people with no money and penny pinching adults who enjoy complaining on the internet.
---
We don't know how much work is going on in the back round.  It's easy for people to criticize and complain the first opportunity they get while sitting behind a computer screen.  That seems to be my generations calling card.
---
They took a risk on this game.  It was met with harsh criticism, largely due to the single player crowd and people not understanding that this genre isn't prefect.  
---
Survival mmo's with basebuilding is still in it's early stages.  Ark, H1 and most of the big name games were a hot mess at launch and took years to get to decent state (if ever).
---
I personally do not have a problem with devs trying to make money (via cosmetics) in a game that is being supported in the long run.  
---
I wouldn't recommend spending too much unless you're well off, but I think most people should spend a couple bucks here and there...and fallout 1st is a must for serious players.  Personal lobby when you want, stash increase, bonuses, ect.  The atoms alone are worth it.  $100 for a year and you receive 19,800 atoms.   Meanwhile in the store its $40 for 4100.
---
Again, even if you don't think it's a tremendous value, you're supporting the devs and encouraging the VPs to invest in the next mmo survival game.
---
That's something at least. Still sure the guy who told me this is a compulsive liar. He told me he had a full team of people sharing Super Duper and he turned 6 wrapping papers into 48 presents, because Super Dupers would double up on each other. Knew that was wrong already because Super Duper doesn't work with wrapping paper. 
---
He also told me that swing speed was super rare on pickaxes, which I also found to be untrue. 
---
Says he has the record for fastest SBQ solo, and when I fight with him, he goes "okay here I go" and then doesn't do much more if any more damage than me, and I'm a Junkie build.
---
Said he solo'd the Vault Raid on Expert right around the time it first came out, then last week I do the Expert Raid with him and we complete it (my first time successfully) and he says "What is this? I got this new thing called a Vault 94 mask" and I say "Yeah you get that for completing the raid on Expert". So, that was obviously his first time completing Expert.
---
Gotta have a talk with him I guess.
---
Lol. This pic is soooooo old!  Did you even bother running strings on the esm or exe and grepping for stuff with similar naming conventions?!?  Of course your being downvoted.  U may think it‚Äôs because u are shedding light on their incompetence, but is actually because this post is irrelevant due to the age of your screenshot and not likely doing any reversing or disassembly yourself while posting other people‚Äôs very dated work. 
---
Bethesda has additional anti cheat built in server side that has caught my friends for exploring dev cells, etc (rightfully) and has likely modified this portion of the esm/exe since that was originally posted.
---
that is good, I was starting to worry that I'd get up to 9999 atoms and could not earn anymore. I don't see anything in the atomic shop that I want, and if there is, I wait for it to go on sale
---
I have the perk maxed for scoped rifles accuracy and the vats increase when shooting the same area, and I have 95% to hit CONSTANTLY and it takes a full magazine of my lever action before I even hit, so I have DEFINITELY noticed. Just like a month ago I was able to sneak kill multiple things purely with vats and the grim reaper card
---
I mean caps are redundant, legacy weapons are just fun to own they aren't "viable" just use it I'd say nothing in the game is worth more than that plan
---
I haven't played the game in a long time, but the constant bitching about the downvotes is the most fucking cringy thing
---
But it goes with the touque with flames.
---
Around Todd never fold
---
1400 beautiful hours...
---
A big problem with Encryptid is that most people run Bloodied or low endurance builds, and won‚Äôt make effective pylon conduits. There‚Äôs also the issue that in order to get drops from the Imposter you need to do enough damage to her, and that becomes difficult to do while trying to mitigate the heavy pylon damage (especially as a melee build).
---
Honestly, I think they should nerf the amount of damage the pylons do, and allow everyone participating in the event to get her drops.
---
Shouldn't be the case no
---
I just cleared out the Morgantown train yard and airport about 2-3 times And got maybe 8 1* legendaries.
---
I found 8 festive scorched too*
---
This is misleading. That's not an anti-cheat, that's a pretty common anti-debug implementation.
---
Oh fuck off you don't intimidate anyone.
---
I have a dozen dev teams at my work who are testaments that you don't need to know HOW to code to write code.
---
Wait... So after the wreath does xp just stop until tomorrow? I'm super confused as I missed Halloween.
---
Can you provide a detailed analysis of why you're not wrong?
---
There are two things certain in life, my dear Martin, that are death and taxes.
---
It does not stack with speed demon. I have speed demon, and weapons with fmswa, and I move the same speed while aiming as I do with weapons without fmswa. Youre already moving as fast as the game allows with speed demon.
---
Like someone else said, there'd need to be an exception when someone is in the tent using it. But for some of us, we can't just server hop to place our camp. Most the time when I play late at night I can only find one server (lol).
---
Idk if you wanna keep doing melee but power armor + heavy weapons = tank , your unstoppable to everything but also bloodied melee builds
---
Maybe wastelanders explores the idea that once the queen is gone the scorch can think clearly ?
---
Well that‚Äôs saddening to hear. I appreciate your input and guess I‚Äôll have to pass on the FMSWA stuff.
---
This exact thing happened to me a few day ago also.
---
And still no player hosted custom servers with mods tho.
---
Having been through an IT degree program and subsequently declining to hire considerably more Comp Sci grads than I have elected to hire, I strongly disagree with your statement that college freshmen are expected to write better. 90% of my bachelor interviews would be unable to understand the decompiled/reconstructed from asm code in your screenshot, let alone write anything better.
---
That out of the way, one coder to another, how exactly would you elect to go about writing better cheat protection? I haven't gone about analyzing the cheat protection approach since Punkbuster was a thing, but I seem to recall back then there was indeed a search for running process names involved. As time progressed their code became more sophisticated and Punkbuster itself began to work just like Cheat Engine in that it scanned process memory for "known signatures" aka familiar code. That sounds shockingly similar to anti-virus software.
---
It does.   You just have to turn it on.  It doesn't even require any power.... üòâ

Dumb question, but once you installed you did hit activate. That make the logs glow like a fire. Have to turn on like a light. In may be misunderstanding what you mean by glow, if so my apologies for answering incorrectly.
---
After reading some of the reddit posts I think I'll be going power armor and laser rifle. I have my build in the above chat.
---
This is really not the first time this sort of thing has happened, a lot of companies that go and try make a multiplayer game after doing SP have shit anti cheat, doubly so when you take an existing, singeplayer focused engine and re-purpose it to be multiplayer.
---
People have been doing stuff like this in gta4 and then even in 5 since day 1 of their launch but no one seems to bat an eyelid at that.
---
Sounds good bro , a legendary laser rifle could be quite expensive so save yo caps fool!
---
I meant what chems and drinks increase carry weight? Either by adding strength or directly increasing carry weight.
---
Seen this before, it was flying around outside the borders and sometimes clipping back in. I remember it was very weird interacting with the regular one that spawns in and is grounded. I think they fought or something? Or I was fighting both at once. Something like that. I think it made the regular one bug out too
---
101(st)% agreed.
---
I've got 1st, and it would make all the logical sense to me to just get a notification that my tent just got packed up due to a camp being placed. There's absolutely no justification, other than because of code - which in that case can, and should, be changed - to have the tent block C.A.M.P. placement.
---
Furthermore, players existing in the C.A.M.P. area should not block placement, and if they do, this should also be changed. There is absolutely a way to make it so that the player is moved to the fast travel point, even if they're in the Pip-Boy. If the area has workstations and the player is in one of those, then it should not be an issue of any kind to place the C.A.M.P. around them. Also, on a tangent to this as it needs to be reminded to Beth devs over and over again, the fast travel mats need to be given back to us, so we can designate the fast travel point. It was working in the B.E.T.A., and whatever bugs it caused can be fixed instead of removing the entire thing.
---
Also, PA frames should also not block C.A.M.P. placement, and if they do, that needs to be fixed; just throw the PA frame back in the player's inventory when the C.A.M.P. arrives.
---
Finally, I know it probably requires the developers to spend a few extra hours on this, but C.A.M.P. placement should be checked *before* loading into the game. Just run a script/function when a game is found to check if the player's C.A.M.P. is placeable, and if it is, allow the game to load. If then during that load-in period someone else managed to plop their C.A.M.P. down, give the notification and offer a new game instance, fair enough.
---
Run the sneak perks: covert operatives, sneak, escape artist, and mr. Sandman I think. Those are all under agility and boost ur sneak dmg
---
.....because obfuscation has such a high success rate of thwarting programmers who are usually well versed in obfuscation
---
But hey now! he‚Äôs free!
---
what event do you get it from
---
Bethesda won't understand this, "test" is not in their vocabulary.
---
Everything you said, except it's a disaster area of bugs, and they don't give us anything for free.
---
Oh lord. I remember.
---
I remember doing the events an average of 10 times per day for 5-6 months until i got one drop. Then a week later, i got a second.
---
Kudos, Brother, on your drop :) only 2 more to go!
---
Didn't even think of that!! That would be sooo good.
---
Gonna get the new fireplace addition from atom shop today?
---
Mr. Pebbles of course. Everywhere. And toilet sculptures.
---
Congratulations!! 
---
I nearly cried when my travelling leather coat dropped...1724 hours of grinding, 100s of events...totally worth it!
---
Honestly if they want wastelanders to truly succeed... they will realise a test server in January/February about a month/2weeks before the launch of update.. and give restricted access to a certain amount of players.. (would probably be FO1st members at this point) but I‚Äôm okay with that.. 
---
Get a test server out before wastelanders! And we should 100% get a better update than if they release without one!
---
Wrong
---
Do you mean:
---
Do the thing that they should have done all along?
---
It may be due to mismatched terminology; I was refering to the "self-healing enemies when blasted with explosive shotgun" thing.
---
If you just need any backpack, there‚Äôs a plan for a small backpack in the Morgantown Airport. You can craft it at an armor workbench I think?
---
You haven't gotten all of the free stuff cuz it does go away when u got all the free stuff.
---
When you say impatience to load, are you referring to server hopping? Because some of us have very few servers in our region - I sometimes can't find more than one server when I'm playing late at night. It's a minor inconvenience for you to re- place your tent a few feet away, but it's a huge inconvenience for players like me who can't just move their camp so easily.
---
Been farming scorched,  when you spawn second beast from ultracite it does it.  Run out in middle of cavern or to other end and after a while it gets loose
---
It drops from certain events in the Mire.
---
Refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drmsuy/guide_complete_list_ingame_obtainable_apparel_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Unyielding armor with harder to detect for the win. It can't be beaten. Except for serendipity I don't even run defense cards. Wood armor is the best if you can get ahold of any. People in the know don't let go of unyielding wood armor easily. Also I spent a while figuring out how say that instead of "get your hands on some unyielding wood" haha. You won't need to worry about defense because (ideally) nothing will ever see you.
---
Not a dumb question. One of my team members secretly turned off each wall light in my house. I came in and thought my power was messed up. I spent 30 mins rewiring before I hear him laughing his butt off over chat. I look at one of the wall lights, click 'Activate', and on it goes.
---
Thank you so much, I'll have a look and let you know!! I really appreciate it. üíô‚ùÑüíô
---
It's incredibly dark though even turned on. I want that glow that fire pits, fire trash cans, candle sticks and the fireplace gives.
---
Now that is classic. Good shit there.....
---
After a while it crashed my game because it kept on going further into the void
---
???
---
I know some people who sell items on GameFlip and eBay. $20k is casual selling. One of these guys offered to buy all of my gear I've collected since BETA for $750 so that he could turn around and sell it for $2k or more. Haven't taken him up on it, but they take this seller stuff seriously.
---
Ah yes.  Have to say that I am 100% in agreement with you.
---
Not to defend the state of Nuclear Winter, which is something I don't play, and thus have no real first-hand experience running into any situations where I would've noticed a hack or a cheat of any kind being used in Fallout 76, aside from reading about them on the subreddit, but for me personally, my experience with GTA:O - the little that I could stomache that utter piece of crap ultra greed cash grab mode of an otherwise entertaining game - was infinitely worse.
---
GTA:O gets, by far, by being lightyears ahead, the #1 spot as the worst online experience that a human being has ever created, not only by being completely and utterly unplayable due to the hackers, but also by the company, Rockstar, being one of the worst cash grabbing companies I've ever seen.
---
Also, not for nothing, but I've been playing World of Warcraft for 15 years now, and you'd think with all the hundreds of billions of dollars Activision has made through Blizzard, they'd have a better handle on certain things, hackers included. But, nope. Constantly seeing hackers in WoW after 15 years of development.
---
Having said that, of course it would be awesome if Beth devs could find a way to stop hackers, but the engine just isn't built for that. It was relatively fine before they added a "competitive" mode, Nuclear Winter, since it was basically still a single player game, just with a few other people, and online.
---
Also, they did have people from id working with them on the net code and stuff like that, but I guess the people from id didn't volunteer any information on this, or they were just as unable to make changes in the engine to stop stuff like this from happening.
---
I mean, Nuclear Winter would be fine as a fun little attempt at a competitive online game with this engine. It's just the people who play it who ruin it, once again.
---
It just doesn't glow very bright at all. I have mine in a darker part of my camp where it's not too dark but dark enough for objects that glow to stick out and this doesn't stick out well enough. It doesn't radiate a glow around it, just on it.
---
What does this coat do?
---
Guy with a tent pays money, guy with a camp doesn‚Äôt, you should expect this behavior to always go this way
---
Maybe late next year?
---
What platform
---
What lead you to believing it‚Äôs a DDOS attack?
---
We're getting one [sometime in 2020](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again).
---
Is there a list of what we can get?
---
I guess I shouldn't generalize, not everyone who plays bloodied is like that. I play with full health, and have no issue taking a pylon. Like you guys said, might as well use the stimpaks.
---
Been killing level 65 scorch beasts all day in glass cavern with a .38 combat rifle.
---
Just gotta find a spot they cant go and unload on them.
---
If they played like i do a faster circle wouldnt have mattered
---
The new Xmas Tent maybe?
---
I couldn't agree more
---
Lol like GTA could on ps3
---
&gt; Are there only 3 servers running?
---
Fallout 76 is being hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/gaming/game-server/), so stuff like the number of available game instances that have been spun up, as well as lag and so on may have to do with Amazon and AWS more than what Bethesda is doing. AWS will also attempt to, as far as I'm aware, connect you with people in your region, and not 100% globally (unless you party up with people through your friend list of course), which would mean that for example, if you're playing at 4-5 in the morning your time, there might be much less people around to spin up server instances for.
---
I'm not an expert on AWS and how it works by no means, but as far as I'm aware, it's not quite the same as renting servers from a company and then booting up those servers via a web interface, and what the situation definitely isn't, is Bethesda running those servers themselves.
---
Like GTA does on every platform
---
I suggest we try to handle this by being smart about where we place our tent.   Pick odd spots where it is less likely to have a camp.
---
Where a camp really would not fit well.  Yes a barebones camp can fit anywhere, but those aren‚Äôt the players really mad at this. It‚Äôs the elaborate and merchant camps that need their location more.   
---
I rarely run into the problem anymore, but then I have my camp far from Whitesprings.
---
You're not hunting ducks, its meant for point blank AoE dmg.  Think of it as a room sweeper weapon.
---
Awesome! I became impatient and paid too caps for one lol already made 10 fold the same caps back lol
---
Your internet would have shit it‚Äôs self if it was

---
I wish that the camp radius was the only boundary for someone else‚Äôs camp. So occasionally you could have 2 camps right next to eachother.
---
Lol for real I‚Äôve already spent 50k or more
---
Lol reading this made me think of the turrets from Portal haha
---
JAJAJA does his dad also works at nintendo?
---
Our current world it seems is in a constant state of damage control to appease the vocal minority.
---
Who whines the loudest get the most attention.
---
For a damn coat?
---
I got a samsung t5
---
I got the 500gb. I can get 5 games on it depending on size.  Usually what I'm currently playing.
---
I‚Äôm on XB1, wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing what you got after the event. Needing a few still of the mounted plans.
---
Congrats!  Welcome to the club.
---
Took me about 1500, but I wasn‚Äôt really grinding specific events until mid-summer.  I‚Äôm still waiting on the shielded raider plan.
---
I may be in the tiny minority, but I actually like how this game has super rare stuff that can take 1000 hours to acquire.  It actually feels special when you get it.
---
Honestly two good nights and you can have it done.
---
Quite liked it actually.
---
If you're on Xbox I'll help you out with the revive
---
GTA has had invite only sessions since day one
---
Agree
---
My laser weapons always have this problem
---
They would keep spawning when I got the ultracite for scorched.  I would go into smaller cave by the elevator and it would get stuck in a loop inside the wall.
---
I'd start walking to the other sides small cave mouth and it would after a bit get unstuck. 
---
But if you go out of the big chamber it gets stuck in the wall.
---
I had one follow me all the way back to the entrance inside the wall
---
Fallout 76 servers are hosted on Amazon's AWS, who have excellent DDoS mitigation. Not to say it isn't possible, especially with poorly configured servers, but a DDoS attack is unlikely.
---
During combat,no and for rad-x i really don't know i don't really use them because I'm mutated.
---
Did you get through the mission?
---
Not the toxicity
---
I learn everything from researching videos and tutorials online. If you‚Äôre new, I highly recommend Kamui‚Äôs Cosplay Community group of Facebook!
---
Nearly done after I restarted the game I just had my left leg for my excavator power armour break and now I am over encumbered and slowly waddling to survey camp alpha to get it fixed so I can then get to fort defiance to do the last steps
---
What system are you on? If Xbox, I can help if you need it.
---
From the experience i have had with the Community in FO76, I can easily say it is the least toxic community i have been apart of. Higher levels will help out the low levels by giving them aid and low level guns and armor. So I believe if they were to introduce cross platform, i believe that it will work out just fine.
---
you can through a glitch but it takes up more budget
---
Im mot saying there not a little overpriced but that hat comes with the outfit
---
Not too bad. The easiest challenges to me were Archery, Hunter, and Athlete. Only difficulties are in waiting for your crossbow to be damaged enough to repair 3 times and killing a Yao Guai with a syringer (AKA grenading it to death while holding a syringer). If your revive didn't count, just stalk boss events like SBQ and Imposter and rez the first person to eat it.
---
This has been a thing since last November. They've done nothing except 1 wipe of all the dupped items and dup came back twice and they didn't do more wipes. Pc is the worst platform to play this on.
---
I have healing factor too but it regenerates out of combat.
---
I never really got the whole fixation with up/down votes either.
---
Funny until it scares the s**t out of you when it flys through a wall to drop poison or acid on you
---
I get the same problem. It wont let me place my canoe, and there isnt one in my spot. Sometimes theres one down the way a little bit, but definitely not that close.  It's annoying, especially when I have to hop 3-4 times, and then my friends have to hop with me
---
Yup I'm having the same issue on ps4
---
It still happens, but less often, in my experience.  Worse: the bug where your carry weight is lowered is still a possibility.
---
Its the price per bullet
---
I‚Äôm really happy for this (the third edit), the support of the big industries is never good, they are ‚Äúbusy‚Äù like 30 hours a day, they can‚Äôt respond to the ticket for stupid reason, wish these big industries will learn from small industries...
---
So you can never sell less than 1 cap per bullet? Seems expensive, but ok.
---
Yup
---
1 item = 1 unit example, 15 stims and you sell all for 10 caps it will sell 1 stimpak for 10 caps. Hope this helps. ü§ôüèΩ
---
No, it's the easiest to earn. Just apply some WD-40 to your wallet, and watch those Atoms soar!
---
Probably never.
---
This game is bethesda austins first multiplayer game.  I doubt they are capable of doing it considering how shakey the netcode is this late after launch.
---
I noticed that I can't have multiple stacks of the same rounds - they all merge into one stack. Can players buy however many bullets they want, or is the only option to buy the whole stack?
---
Lol you have to press the button first. It will look like electricity shooting out but it will give you a ton of rads.
---
Even better than "Mercenary: you are tasked with guarding an NPC's caravan" would be if people's roles triggered new Events where other players were tasked with helping out.
---
This way, you can have an Ammosmith, Chemist, and Weaponsmith create goods, a Caravan Leader purchase the goods in bulk from those players, and Mercenaries hired by the Caravan Leader to guard her as she travels from player camp to player camp to sell the wares.
---
We need more ways for players to create quests/events and content that can involve ‚Äì and at higher difficulties \*\*require\*\* ‚Äì other players to be successful.
---
If you ever heard of a game named GTA Online, that game has everything you just mentioned but at worse capacity like 5 times worse I'm not even kidding. But the game is 4 years old on PC and still has 60k+ players.
---
I did press the button, in fact I tried multiple times after dying and still got no rads at all, there was actually another reddit thread back in April 2019 where a person mentioned they experienced the same thing.
---
Awesome! Glad it's working for you now! I'm gonna try tomorrow, if I get on now I'll be playing all night again.
---
Xbox it was just a loading issue of how the game can‚Äôt load the stuff fast enough and probably happens on other platforms as well
---
Maybe Bethesda can bring back the GOAT test to help us decide which specialization/job is best for us
---
They can slide like when you put them in the vendor so they can buy how many hy want
---
So a level 300+ players, who is playing with a premade squad says small maps are fun and all who disagree are either 0 IQ or bush hiders.  
---
I remember your squad reviving you 2 times when you died to my turrets and mines and 3rd time when I downed you and they killed me.
---
Rawr.  Still hot after all these years.
---
Radiated snow?
---
Check your "stored" items as well. I believe having too many items stored that you're not using takes up budget space.
---
i have seen that twice already.
---
I wouldn't mind either if more items were actually highly desirable. The cost is nice but some of the ultra rare jumpsuits and many of the other rarer cosmetics are just ugly.
---
No but lmk if you find it and ik a way we can farm it for rare items
---
Just go to blackwater mine. Ya know the place where uranium fever is. There is a radiation shower on the right at the entrance and tons of radiation in the water.
---
Just remember you can only get one mutation per hour unless you server hop to reset the timer.
---
Let em buy, if people are crazy enough to pay that kinda money, why not capitalize? 
---
The duping is and has been an issue for a long time but it has made a lot of really hard items players play tons of hours for and still don‚Äôt get available, for example say a traveling leather coat. 
---
It also made getting a weapon you desire possible, though everyone plays the game there own way and has their own style. I pick up weapons that benefit me and my play style. Every now and then I come across a very rare weapon like a bloodied something, since I only PvP in NW bloodied builds do nothing for me. I recently sold a Bloodied explosive handmade with damage resist for 30k. Could have got more but 30k is the cap and I‚Äôm not really trying to get rich. Honestly a Cap on caps is something they really should change, most game don‚Äôt even have a cap. I like to save my caps up without making a million characters. 
---
Duper folks will continue to dupe as long as there is a way but I did take a break and haven‚Äôt heard much about duping still going on at least on console.
---
Game still can be fun if you do you. I like Camp building personally and have built some for people for caps as part of my shops business.  
---
Try not to get sucked into any shady stuff going on, I like my character I‚Äôve had since launch and don‚Äôt want to even be associated with people doing crazy stuff. 
---
Hope it gets better!
---
As impressed as I've been by people creating their own fireplaces out of a combination of campfires and boxes and such, it really is nice to finally have a real one available. After the kitchen sink they released a week or two ago, this is one of those "must-have" home decor items that we've been waiting for for a long time. What's next? Some proper bathroom items like a non-garbage toilet and bathtub?
---
This is lme of the best parts of the game.
---
Interesting
---
Too bad the game is barely playable.
---
will do
---
The maximum is your normal carry weight + 1500. Once you hit that number you get a message saying "you cannot pick up any more items"
---
So as long as you don't otherwise make it public (screenshots, blatant NW cheating, trading &amp;c) you're basically safe with your cheat gear? Great-o...
---
Just talked about this today. Agreed
---
Sure I get that, I'm just telling OP, if they are they type of player who wants to look around a fairly big Fallout themed map that is difficult enough it will keep their interest for a couple hundred hours but if they take the game seriously it's going to be a bad time.
---
I
---
I have this problem too, its funny that one of the main quests is bugged for me, I collected the last holotape a few months ago and still refuses to leave my pipboy
---
This will forever be my favorite community. There are so many amazingly nice people.
---
Hopefully but how did you get that enclave title?
---
Meanwhile im just over here on console having a grand ole time.
---
Like tears in the rain.
---
Pvp peaks at level 35. You get enough perks to have a viable build and nobody has a Tesla or a legacy. Endgame pvp is literally off the scale in terms of balance. I don't want to have to chug down 5 buffs before each fight.
---
If it‚Äôs a camp from a fallout first person- sure. A peasant camp tho? My tent stays.
---
(A joke just incase no one sees that)
---
I don't know if it's lucky or not that you crashed out. I went through most of the cavern with that bug going on, and I've never gone back because of it.
---
the only messages I get are people complaining how cheap I‚Äôm selling my legendary gear, lowering their value or some such rubbish. If I‚Äôm not using it I don‚Äôt want it taking space in my stash, feel free to buy it all and resell üëç
---
Iirc rifleman, but it's easy to test this, just test the damage before and after equipping one of the perks
---
Cant you just turn it off by Activating it?
---
It‚Äôs not lucky I spent 100 caps on workshops in that server
---
Huh, is that a price for whole account? Or cherry picking certain items?
---
It‚Äôs not bugged... just not completed
---
The Overseer will return in the Wastelanders
---
Only if it's on a hard drive.
---
Taking a serum again will temporarily remove all the downsides of the mutation, did you not know that? All your advice is wrong and you should study builds before trying to correct people.
---
If not a snow machine, maybe snow patches you can place on the ground?
---
Genius
---
Man, I hate those woodchuckers! Always clearing forests ahead of me...
---
Clear cache maybe? I'm lost on this one.
---
You forgot all the other weapons, mate. Seriously, there is quite more to it.
---
Uhhh? Blizzard didn't make Destiny.
---
I run a stealth commando/rifleman that's pretty tanky. Much different than that. I use a Furious and a VE handmade primarily. Its something like 12 st, 12 per, 1 end, 1 chr, 5 int, 14 agi, 10 luk. It's to late for me to check but I'll post it tomorrow.
---
It also allows me to run heavy guns for the queen or swap for some melee perks of I'm goofing off. Stealth is a huge deal damage wise and its preferred but without it I can get myself out if any mess. Highly reccomend it.
---
Your advice is horribly wrong with and incoherent. Why stack up to 500 armor when you get diminishing returns after 300 on a sneak build that "one shots everything". You shouldn't be getting hit, armor and health perks are a total waste for any build.
---
They should of remarketed this game as a social experiment on perception vs delusion.
---
Try diluted Rad-x
---
You are talking about adventure mode?
---
There are ways to perma ban people regardless of IP, Blizzard does it with Overwatch.
---
Well we know that a tavern is going to be placed near Vault 76, and everyone thinks the bartender is a woman named Dutchess.
---
I actually found a holotape from Dutchess under that bar/tavern in the ash heap.
---
There may be more, but this is the only one I have found.
---
All the important stuff!
---
Its so odd that it isnt possible to put wallpaper on both sides
---
Did you find it?
---
True. Bloodied would be higher damage with a bloodied build
---
PS. Harpoon is a heavy weapon
---
They take the whole account, so that would kill off any purchases you have on beth.net associated on the same account even for other games but I'd you have some decent outfitting and rare items most could sell the account for 250$ min up to a few grand if you've been around leveling since beta assuming higher level and better gear.
---
Can confirm it didn‚Äôt work for me, have a feeling it‚Äôs just buggy and only works on some servers. Idk feel like Bethesda should get it together
---
I think the leather coat and traveling version are the exception to the rule.  They look wasteland AF.
---
Make sure you are logged into the right Bethesda account. Some people have multiple accounts. 
---
But support can easily determine what's up quickly and see if someone somehow got access to your account via hack or misuse and see if it can be restored to last state. 
---
There's been a few people who were able to get accounts recovered this way.
---
I agree. Same with the strangler heart PA. It's an insane grind but the pay off actually feels worth it.
---
https://music.apple.com/us/album/fallout-76/1434657630?i=1434657793
---
1400 hours? In this trash game? I'm impressed
---
Its a whole " to be continued..." thing.  We'll get more with Wastelanders.
---
SAD!
---
Ight
---
Already bought and installed!
---
Sadly true
---
I have 2000 hours in game, with fixer and bear arm plans unlocked on multiple characters and I've never gotten a single one from the purveyor. Nothing. Zero. 
---
My best world drop was a BE handmade I got at 1700 hours into the game and I know that I will never ever find an upgrade, and I know if I buy an upgrade, it's gonna be from a duper. What do? I'd love a BFFR25 fixer or handmade but that's asking for a miracle.
---
Yes it‚Äôs rifleman cards :) at least it was when I tested it out a month ago lol
---
Ghoulish only works out of combat? Really? Then why am I never needing to heal in Nuke zones?
---
The bottlecap mine glitch was from meat week till patch 15. It was a glitch related to being overencumbered and not a cheat engine thing. I was that guy making mischief at the Halloween event. It was fun while it lasted
---
&gt; They whine when someone like Bethesda does pay-to-win, but in the same breath, some will go and spend real money on eBay for gear and think nothing of it.
---
lmao.
---
bugthestards are funny!
---
We never negotiated the full terms, but it would have been something along the lines of a full dump of every armor, weapon, and rare outfit I had. Not the account itself. Another friend of mine did agree to a similar buyout, and that's how it went.
---
Lazy people will pay real money for stupid shit if I wasn't so lazy I'd make money of it.
---
A fool and their money is easily parted.
---
Bethesda released FO76 knowing the duping issues before hand so ultimately they didn't care or it was within their design plans.
---
So can it really be considered cheating or whatever if the game design had it built in, or are the people who play legitimately just cheating themselves.
---
Either way if you enjoy the game to each their own. 
---
Personally I just am overall disgusted how badly the game still plays a year later. And for the record I have tried to positively support this game for the last year.
---
Maybe you unequip a piece. The bonus works as intended.
---
Heh?
---
Does it disappear at the end of xmas?
---
Maybe to add the Christmas decor to NW lobby?
---
nah
---
What happened? Did it get removed from your build item list or something?
---
I‚Äôm pretty positive i have all the pieces equipped properly.  But i‚Äôll take a look later.
---
Finally! I'm glad you found a way to solve your own problems, rather than asking Bethesda to nerf something else like most people do. This is how adults act, and I genuinely commend you for drawing a line in the sand.
---
Naw this bug will help then get more revenue from atoms. 
---
It is deemed a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù at that point
---
Surely that is not legal, thi game other than the FO 1st sub is not a service I thought.
---
I‚Äôve been experiencing the blue screen of death a lot since this patch. I‚Äôve tried everything to fix it. Is this an issue with the game or me?
---
It's lke the most common coat in fo4 but the most rare one in fo76
---
Anyone find the "Grey and Gould lighter"? I can go to valley Galleria and find the store Grey and Gould and you can find lighters inside of the display cases but I was hoping there was a specialty named one.
---
I usually get the vendor to spawn at least once a night. I'll hit you up the next time I've got him
---
A buggy mess that crashes constantly. I want it to be good but I can't shake this thought.
---
You lose your tent when first expires. So you'll lose the new tent  too.
---
I had about 600 - 700h on Fallout 4, and it occurred to me that it's great value for money if you compare it to most other forms of entertainment. Even streaming like netflix, in my country we have expensive and slow internet (it's better now). Movie tickets are easy to convert.
---
Likewise. Just need to work out what I want on the mantlepiece.
---
cool, i also had pvp encounter and posted about it 
---
feels good to own noobs
---
The impact is super minimum and as long as Beth doesn't encourage it (Which they don't) I'm fine with them on that aspect.  Sure cheaters are assholes, stop being assholes cheating community.  My personal opinion is that cheaters aren't effecting anyone unless you are super serious into the game or high leveled.
---
You totally can have multiple stacks of the same ammo rounds in the vendor, provided you price them differently. And there is no reason to have multiple stacks of the same ammo rounds for the same price - people can simply buy the amount of bullets they want using the amount-adjustment sliders used in every inventory screen in the game.
---
Nah cus money
---
Any fixes? I have the same problem on PS4 108 GB free??
---
Logging out of my Bethesda account and logging back in fixed it for me on PC.
---
or be happy with a thumbs up
---
I think the plasma grenade is quite common, already had it drop twice
---
Look in your wallet
---
I got that coat by accident doing queen of the hunt... Although I then found out Marine Body clips through it and looks all kind of weird, so it lives in my Stash now. What a waste.
---
I know this may sound silly, but for when I do not have my tent placed, I would love the option to be able to drop it at my camp. It would be a nice little addition to my camp in the meantime, then I could always move it somewhere when required. 
---
I was genuinely surprised this was not an option.
---
Thought the problems for this game stopped but then I realised that won't happen because people (who for unknown reason) still play this god awful game and they keep discovering these huge issues that can literally ruin the whole game. Why the fuck are billion dollar companies relying on us to report such big issues that any capable developer should have noticed and fixed immediately? The management at Bethesda is an absolute trainwreck. Even if their playerbase consisted majority of hackers, they wouldn't do shit because atleast people are playing their game. That'll be enough to keep them satisfied.
---
What are people paying for these out of interest?
---
I‚Äôm really confused.  What‚Äôs your gripe?
---
The tent is part of the subscription, the holiday skin was included as part of the subscription as long as you click to claim it.
---
If you no longer subscribe you no longer have a tent....
---
I upvoted your comment but it's sadly, still in the negative. You stated the truth yet they deny the facts because it hurts their feelings.
---
Level 500 is effectively no different to level 50
---
How?
---
You can't allocate any more social points after level 50, so you don't really get any stronger past that point aside from gear
---
lol you‚Äôll end up having snowflakes t-shirt and shorts üòÇ
---
that would be great i gave up for tonight
---
Happened to me last night.
---
Killed everything in the main cavern and was busy looting scorched cave cricket bodies for acid and a scorch beast crawls out of the fissure then promptly flies through the wall, disappears, reappears back over the fissure, then repeats until I‚Äôve had enough and head shot crit it in VATS to kill the stupid thing.
---
Does the game still stay tough even with good gear?
---
I'm Aussie. Going to be grinding raid the next week for the photoframe. NW for rewards if you're interested psn is dtb7591
---
Been getting the blue screen so much I can‚Äôt really play the game. Never had this issue before.
---
Does it at least have any stat buffs
---
I‚Äôll still take it!
---
The thing is, i dont want to one shot enemies, where is the fun in that?
---
So this way i get forced to either also have a duped weapon that one shots everything or anywhere where i have to compete with another player for ressources i will lose.
---
Thats my point.
---
The game isnt PvP but to some degree you still compete with others and cheating kills any effort a legitimate player makes.
---
Once you get certain gear the game can become fairly easy. You'll still get groups of enemies and certain enemies that kick your ass but you can still take out a group of ten max level super mutants.
---
agreed, i would think there are bigger issues to trigger you
---
Yes, I‚Äôve been getting the blue screen so much I cant really play the game now. This last patch did something to screw it up, I‚Äôve never had the blue screen problem before.
---
Explosive actually does very little damage when you‚Äôre wearing dense. Even at 10% health I never have to worry about killing myself.
---

Lots and lots of bugs

Now, ctrl-F and search the words "Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:" and you'll find them on the sidebar to the right side of the page. Below it will be a little "edit" button you can click to change your own flair and choose one for yourself!
---
Ah, that's always been my trouble with fallout games, any suggestions on a difficult build to do but which still has progression? Im trying to make it as hard as possible for myself
---
I did heart of the swamp and got that coat first try, had to have been just a few days in. Pretty sure I tossed it because I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the way it looked
---
I can play a little then I get the blue screen of death. It‚Äôs become unplayable :(
---
how much does that subscription cost?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the sandals! üòÇ
---
Awesome! Congrats!! :)
---
Bethesda is very lenient with returns, just ask for a refund and you get your atoms back and keep the atomic shop item
---
It was a joke, since it's not a new struggle

And...you heard that the 10* is a fake...?

Settlers are bound to make it over, there is no real boarder just a lack of outward contact, no trade means no people.  Maybe a large convoy has been nomadically moving across America and is just about to reach WV.  Settlers could then break into factions when they realise how crazy WV is.
---
1. Find a flat plot of land which isnt on a slope or a hilly surface.
---
2. Dont just build one giant box and then sporadically place objects inside it. Start with one small room then slowly add other rooms as you go. It'll make the overall shape and composition of the structure seem more natural.
---
3. Bigger isnt always better. In my opinion, Id rather have a small house with alot of attention to detail and realistic clutter than to have a giant mansion and be left with such little budget that my furniture will have wide open spaces between them.
---
4. Structure and decorate your player home as if it were a real house. Do real houses have a railed staircase leading directly into the front door? No  they have a porch w/ a small leisure area. When you open your front door is there a staircase smack dab right by the entrance so that you have no choice but to walk up to the second floor? No, the staircase is usually out of the way and flush with one of the walls. Just look at real world houses and see the way that they're set up and copy that.
---
I got a ton of other tips, but I'd be here all day if I dont keep it short.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea and instead of bats it could be snowflake shapes.
---
A build with no legendaries
---
Honestly something I think about doing
---
Congrats you have wastee 1400hours on shitties game ever made!
---
Gotcha, cheers for your insanely insightful input üëå
---
Tbh aside from decoding which weapon youll use the build is all down to rng. Unless you trade there's no way to guarantee the legendary effects you'll get. A non legendary build would defo struggle with the later areas
---
I got that the very first time I did that event. I didn't even know it was rare until someone pointed it out.
---
I remember my Bloodied 15% FR 25% AS M79 dropped from SM or something similarly scary (maybe a Deathclaw?). I wear it only for my Bear Arms perk and this weapon's weight less than 1 pound. Dunno if it's useful (lvl 45) i don't use it often, only for fun.

Although i can't say shady business is good, Beth can control it, if they want. It can be something like auction in Diablo 2/Diablo 3. Of course, this market has to has it's own prices and commission.

Can u post a pic in said coat?
---
hO Ho hO
---
At least he hasn‚Äôt wasted a second of his life posting about a game he doesn‚Äôt like. That‚Äôs way worse, way fucking worse.
---
It is not mine as a permenant addition to my atom shop collection. It replaced the original. This would not be the case if it was a skin I owned.
---
if many people suffer this problem on ps4(As do I) its beyond the ps4, its literally the game ruining the ps4 imo, people even report that the game kills its disc drive üòÇ
---
Put your support wherever.
---
No it will go away when they switch it vback to the original in a few weeks but obviously if Im not subbed I couldnt use the skin either way.
---
Way to go, brother!
---
I didn't even know that people can buy a robot that collects scrap... 
---
You may claim it's a cosmetic item first and a utility one second but you're kinda missing the point. 
---
The robot is still an utility item.
---
It's tiny bit of extra help that a paying customer gets.
---
And heres me, breaking into camps and leaving toilet roll and spoiled meat on people's beds....
---
There‚Äôs a free version of the robot available right now that serves the same function.
---
Nice dude
---
Logically speaking, fighting a noob doesn't mean that he can ONLY fight a noob. His capabilities are unknown.
---
I think you are right. I always play "sneak and snipe the head" so I am used to one shooting things.
---
So when I loose my cover I suddenly feel quite weak !
---
Adding to that, when I play with someone I feel more "in charge". So I don't flee from battle to regain cover and I stay with my budy (and revive him alot since it plays "bloody" with low health). That probably adds to the feeling of "things are harder".
---
Yes
---
At more reasonable prices, too, usually.
---
Hopefully there will be some nice xmas decorations released. I'm hopong for a wreath or some fairy lights
---
&gt;grind for your gear!
---
That's typically why people spend real money on games like this. So they don't have to rely on gifts from RNGsus and save LOTS of time grinding.
---
Hell, that's the entire point of most F2P microtransaction business models. This is just player-to-player microtransactions.
---
Lol, much better
---
Good learning kid
---
Like way more micro transactions or p2w shit etc, u know the usual shit they pull off
---
yes, like the santa.
---
I appreciate this thread, I was almost going to purchase it.
---
Continuing improvements regardless of any of the news you have seen. Frankly it seems like heavily reporting any bad news and ignoreing any good is just how it goes.
---
That's actually really nice. Is it the same with the fridges?
---
Best flux farming is at white springs. Cranberry bog is a nightmare to walk through because of the trenches and you get way less of the other materials. Clean nuke placements save resources and time for sbq. If you just want flux there is waaay better areas then down there.
---
The last i heard was about players lyching 1st users. But now after seeing the holiday stuff i kinda want to come back
---
Nothing is really p2w. You can now subscribe for Fallout 1st which is an unlimited junk stash, private servers and cosmetic Atomic Shop items, but it's not an advantage over other players.
---
I use a Samsung T5 that‚Äôs works great got it for $99 could be on sale for the holidays
---
I actually have 2 or 3 unyielding wood pieces that are 3 star with harder to detect so that is good news! Thank you
---
I rename the weapon with the quick bar value enclosed in curly braces and they appear in the right order and at the end of the invotory list: so I have {1} Rifle, {2} Handmade {3} Minigun.
---
I also rename armors, so for exemple a Left Leg Combat Armor with Camouflage and +25 rad resistance is renamed "{LLca} 27 27 cam rad+25" (values are DR &amp; ER ) so I can quickly check if a newly looted armor piece would be better than what I have. And with the braces they are at the end of the list with Under Armor as {UA}, Backpack as {BP} and Pipboy as {PB 2000} and Antirad suit as {AS}. I also set those as favorite to avoid scrapping by accident.
---
Thank you for all the info. So if i went bloodied/sneak, what should my perk loadout look like?
---
Yeah. That never was a issue.
---
Yeah, but wasn't that something they made after? Like a legitimate piece of DLC? Because this suit was literally part of Fallout 4, the clothes were already in Fallout 76, but Bethesda took them out to sell them back.
---
At least the horse armor took some effort! It was a stupid item, but this is frigging robbery!
---
And that's the problem.
---
Haha. It does. My friend had to take the hat off because people kept thinking she was a holiday  scorched.
---
I played during beta and quit after a few weeks due to bugs and what not. I‚Äôm amazed this is still an issue. Why on earth is it possible to load into a server where your camp won‚Äôt load in with you. Fix the damn game.
---
check the 1st menu in the atom shop and equip the tent you want
---
I usually just store them then place them back down if I'm gonna be at the camp for a while. Its annoying but no biggy
---
Are you honestly upset you need a prime membership to wear a striped suit?
---
Honestly I wouldn't say much right now with the event still going on. I've got like 6 of the plans. Hold onto them until the end and they'll easily fetch between 2K &amp; 3K.
---
I didnt even know you could get a plan for it. Gotta be worth a pretty penny for sure.
---
Congrats! I got the Leather Coat about 1300 hours in.
---
Thx, had no ideia how rare it was on the event
---
I run stealth rifle, just back to the game this month, rubbish items, lv 90 now
---
Im from hong kong if you dont mind 
---
will send you an invitation when I"m on
---
chat like this would need some kind of moderation and I think they do not want that.
---
They aren't a common drop but also not super rare.
---
Fallout 1st Chat - Coming soon to your Private World
---
Sweet!
---
Good for you! I‚Äôm a level 77 and I still get my butt kicked because I‚Äôm strictly melee. I got tired of it though so I just put the game is passive mode and it‚Äôs made 76 so much easier. I‚Äôve had one too many bad experiences with workshops so I just avoid them because it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
I play on PC, except for the duping that I've heard about, I haven't seen any cheating that I'm aware of. Came to this thread to find out what its all about?
---
Looks like you rolled a used one, usually brand new is given as a reward. Still looks good though :P
---
The only part o disagree with here is the scrap box which personally would want to see go away
---
Still isn't.
---
I promise you they'll never reply.
---
I think you can find at least one reply last year, and they vaguely say they'll look into it.
---
No prob, shoot me a message when you're ready to look, and you can browse what I have.
---
No i doesnt, if anyony is spamming or have bad language, users can report this guy and after 10 or 15 reports that guy will be muted for sometime, its simply as easy. They just need to look at the Star Trek Online Chat-system and do so, they dont either too moderate the chat, and they have nealry zero problems with that method.
---
Thanks üòÑüëç
---
Np.who else to share my tricks with, if not with atom farmers?
---
I have 10400 and never paid for any....
---
Sitting here, wondering the same thing.
---
If they do it right, FO76 is saved. If they do usual, unfortunately it's over and the last of the hold outs will be keeping the game on life support.
---
That sounds like a bad nukashine trip. I‚Äôve never experienced that. Were you on a team? It‚Äôs weird to be put back on the same server.
---
I'm on PC, I haven't seen any cheating, that I'm aware of. Came here to find out what its all about. I've only heard about the duping.
---
I keep seeing people say this but haven't delt with any more cheaters then any other game, and even then only in NW matches. Mabey I'm just lucky but I just haven't seen it.
---
I haven't seen a lot. But enough to make be want to avoid NW. And enough to piss me off occasionally in Adventure.
---
No the 2nd Amendment says "keep and bear arms." Nothing about actually using them. üòÇüòÇ
---
I agree 100%.
---
Y u no post pics of camp
---
Also please ,since it's considered a light,make it so that it stays on by default like other lights.
---
They still haven‚Äôt fixed that bug lmao? Ive bad two spawn in there. One would come out of the fissure and the other would strafe run me.
---
I've learned the plan , but i have no no lotion to craft it unless i'm derp and have missed something
---
No you can't turn the laughing off. Clicking activate does nothing.
---
people who still like this game are just the fanboys who like to get abused. The game is trash and has been since day 1.
---
They hack NW hard.
---
But as a PvP I agree we should be kept away from most of players: you don‚Äôt enjoy these interactions and we don‚Äôt enjoy server slots taken over by pacifists as they dilute the experience. This game would be way better if servers kept track of nonpacifist/pacifist ratio of connected players, and if players press ‚Äúplay game‚Äù (not load to friends) the loadbalancer (serverside mechanic to take players from main menu to world server) should take this players to world that is either mostly pacific or non pacific, depending on their setting. Easy win for all parts of the community.
---
Great work, keep the info coming:)
---
Shut up, just leave then cry baby.
---
I'm at about 40k, best I've done is two icicle lights one after the other.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yes it will whenever they decide to go back to the original. That might be fine but I still have yet to see the exclusive sales they promised. It just seems petty to take it back and not give me the option to use this tent after christmas as a paying subscriber.
---
Thank you :)
---
You need to use stealth for sneak critical bonus, just check my post below yours if you want to know more about sneaking. For the very basic info: sneak and escape artist perks under agility, armor modded for shadowed and suppressor on your weapon it what let you start adventure towards op stealth build
---
If you're getting downvoted it's because there's a lot of misinformation in this post and you basically copy pasted someone else's research from over a year ago as if it's something you discovered from your own understanding about the current version just recently. The anti-cheat is however lacking but this isn't current information about why. Also I wouldn't put the blame solely on Austin since they were handed the Frankenstein'd multiplayer-ready engine I believe. If anything they've been the ones steadily fixing and improving all of these things.
---
These videos were great. The escape artist/armor weight issue was especially enlightening as I was worried about all the heavy combat armor I'm wearing. Now if the in danger with nothing for miles issue would go away, that would be nice as well.
---
I see people asking for this a lot, but I don't understand the advantage text chat has over voice.
---
You think?
---
On top of that the axe itself drops like crazy. Scrapper a big bunch of them.
---
I only use VATS for flying bugs, in my experience I almost always hit. So I'll do one shot in VATS then exit. Is it possible that it goes bad if you stay in VATS for a longer time?
---
Mine has been laughing for a whole year HAHAHAHA! 
---
Welcome to the club! üñ§
---
You need to level up more, a sniper rifle is better than a handmade, that‚Äôs what I use and it does the job enough
---
You're on the cusp of greatness. You just likely need to get into your 40s. Not sure what perks you're using but bloody mess is in your head future, and a couple of points in adrenaline later on wouldn't hurt either.
---
you need to be in range to speak with other, with a chat you global chat with all
---
Xbox? Ifso ill buy one for 5k?
---
Yeah. Well as a person you suck though
---
May I ask two things regarding your research:
---
* in point 5 you said that chameleon mutation works with non-weightless armors (i.e. Unyielding), but does it benefit even with the slightest way to have that mutation? I'm little lost here...
---
* I'm very interested about better sneak affix - I've read that it's bugged (or maybe it's a feature) and doesn't stack, so it's pointless to use more than one piece.
---
* is it true, that Shadowed mod works (is useful) only in dark areas and doesn't provide any benefits when sneaking in light?
---
Yeah what‚Äôs said here. Also forgot to mention for highest rifleman output typically a Lever wins in that regard
---
I agree. seen multiple videos where in game items ar elsited on ebay for ¬£70
---
Depends what you are doing. Most of the game is pretty easy at that point. There are some challenging vault raids that will remain a challenge at higher levels. There is a big expansion coming in a few months and none of us know what that will bring for high level players.
---
How many how much and xbox???
---
This is the best advice.
---
1) Chameleon mutation seems to have two benefits, main one is stealth field activated when unarmored with a weapon drawn and stationary and secondary something like additional level of sneak perk that only requires a weapon to be drawn.
---
2) I‚Äôm collecting armor pieces to test that
---
3) yes
---
oh bethesda reads this reddit. have you seen the features of fallout 1st??
---
And just those innerwalls could have half width walls. It would make it possible to make reasonably sized bathrooms and corridors that wouldn't use have your floorspace. I would also love to make my generator room smaller.
---

Lol

Till the next event?!? :/
---
I never had this problem but I saw it more then once while visiting other player bases. It was funny and sad in the same time... They were so confused about it and me too...
---
One time I had a missile turret firing at my santatron üòÇ. I‚Äôm assuming the santatron gave the turret coal for Christmas.

Honestly I'd be happy just to see it snow wouldn't even have to accumulate just snow like a slightly heavier ash heap but white... Hell I wouldn't even care if it was ash as long as it was white and resembled snow.

Lately I've heard (and read) them say, "can't stop" and "it hurts."

It happened when Bethesda fixed the game with the last patch

Ah yes, the surgical baseball bat. Nice to say the medical community to keeping up the good work in the Wasteland.

It‚Äôs not that bad. For the 3 world challenges you need to complete I recommend archer, athlete and mamologist. They all are pretty easy and don‚Äôt take that long to complete, assuming you know the required map locations.
---
I say mamologist over hunter but hunter is good too
---
That's about the dirtiest tactic out there just seeing that game's name makes me want my own eyewashing station
---
Yea because ps4 sucks
---
Ommgggggggg
---
this has been the case for months it dosent affect the player base. wich is funny eveyrone is complaning right now... lol i know people who got in to rmt 3 months after the game cameout .. bethesda dosent care.
---
That's some mighty nice looking pictures!
---
Yea the axe has been dropping a lot but most players don't care about the axe itself being that its not legendary but still a decent weapon. A lot if gamers are completionists. I myself am one. We want as many plans as we can get even if we probably will never use it but still knowing it just in case. Hardcore players will pay big caps for stuff they never use. The rarer it is the more they need it. lol
---
Bethesda is relying on 3rd party chat. It‚Äôs lazy and not the best solution.
---
I dont see the problem with selling items on ebay or wherever. That has been going on long before this game. Cheating i have a problem with mainly around duped gear because eventually that person who unknowingly buys a duped weapon and then has it taken by bethesda doesnt deserve that. 
---
For the most part it is mainly PC'S that have the biggest issues with cheats. I play PS4 and i do know that not to long ago they had issues across all platform but slowly it has turned more towards PC'S 
---
To clarify buying anything on ebay to me is the same as buying anything in game including the atomic shop. I see no difference just currency. I could go pay 100k caps in game on an AAE PG or 35.00 on ebay either way i didnt grind for it, i didnt earn it. This is the same with all other items. I love trading, i dont sell on ebay only in game and thats more than enough for me.
---
LMFAO. You were right, they were wrong.
---
I remember death god in the great PvP days lol
---
Yes until the next event I'll be in the nude
---
It‚Äôs confirmed fake, dude was speaking truth
---
I have it :)
---
I would be for this xbox and ps4. It will be nice to have an influx of trades or just the ability to trade between platforms.
---
The fact that these Youtubers claim that the whole of fo76 is riddled with this new Item spawning cheat , when in reality it‚Äôs only on PC and it‚Äôs not even widespread at all so you‚Äôd have to purposely go out of your way to be affected by these new item spawning cheats , and even then Bethesda is able to track literally every item so the tiny amount of players spawning in these weapons and items will just be banned and their items removed so it‚Äôs really not deep at all.
---
I briefly played with a young guy that turned out to be super power hungry.  One night he bought a TSE plasma gatling for $80usd, not even ashamed at all about paying to win.  I shrugged it off because he can do whatever he wants with his money, until he let slip that it was his girlfriends card.  I was so disgusted I just blocked the dude after telling him to grow the fuck up.
---
I'd appreciate that and display settings such as colorblind mode, brightness, and antiglare.
---
I'm colorblind and it makes sight hell in some areas.
---
Also text would help a lot when you're in a party and want to communicate with someone who isn't
---
so luckily the revive an ally was already done,  I am to the badge part.
---
Do I do the computer tests first or after the world challenges?   Taking a break right now then gonna try finish it in a bit
---
Okay, now I understand. Thanks for explaining :) again lol..
---
Or just add the mute already in place for text too.
---
Elder scrolls online has it as well
---
The computer tests are part of the challenges, so if you wanted to complete your archery section you need to take the test and do the world challenges.
---
I used this website to help,
---
https://www.gameskinny.com/oxbv3/fallout-76-scout-world-challenge-badge-exam-answers
---
The tests are randomised from a question pool, so you wont always get the same 5 questions
---
Don‚Äôt the weapons have level requirements? I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong I have a lvl 170 main but all I play is NW now. Every once in a while I‚Äôll go to the regular world map and check out my camp and maybe farm a few legendary ghouls here and there but for the most part I barely remember the tiny details of the game. I don‚Äôt really remember it being excessively challenging in fact I did my entire play through on survival mode before it got canned. Anyways thx for sharing your story with me that‚Äôs crazy that he‚Äôs just dandy about letting $80 usd go for a weapon lol.
---
How much damage can u get from this build per hit? I picked up a BE sniper rifle a while back but have never been a bloodied build.
---
I'd imagine in the tables section? Maybe you have to scroll through each table to see if the skin is there.
---
I‚Äôve looked through all of them, as you‚Äôd expect it to be there. Even looked through every other tab just incase it‚Äôs listed as something else.
---
you will probably find a hand made in berkely springs, if you hunt for it. BUT , you will need plans to make it really effective. as with the hunting 50, install the perforating mags to further increase its armour penetration. steer clear of the lever (unless legendary) which has NO penetration at all. as other replys, sneak bonus is effective until your detected.
---
I wouldn't go bananas as yet because your going to out grow what youve got very shortly. If you can, all 9 rifle perks ( or 1 of each as a stop gap) 3 in tank, at least 1 in sniper and long shot will help with stand off shots.
---
that anti armour 50 is a cracker, your going to miss that......cheers.
---
It‚Äôs really funny how bad most of the instigators are at actually fighting.  Even with their friend lurking in a bush, most are utterly bewildered when you pop a MK III stealthboy and start spamming crits.  A half decent gun and reasonably sensible build will tear through most players in a second or two.
---
I typically give them finger guns and pretend they don‚Äôt exist, but once in a while I‚Äôll indulge someone.
---
Lol who downvoted me again.
---
You should start a service where you help players that get grieved.
---
Yeah all the energy shotguns are still rifleman as far as I'm aware I really wish they would fix it though to give shotguns more variety and I can't even get loot from scorched earth because I can't get much damage on her while she's flying this would be an easy solution to that
---
Unfortunately the coat was extremely heavily duped. I've seen it a lot more than the droprate would likely imply
---
Was this on XBox? Cause if it was then I was the noob , lol
---
I am assuming you also selected table options and then scrolled left/right?
---
Yes loads of times, it‚Äôs just not there. Hoping someone else had got it and could just confirm I‚Äôm not going mad.
---
Welcome back!   I say just pick up where you left off, and keep exploring.  You can always learn new things, nothing stops you from going back and revisiting old places.  Many times I myself have found things I overlooked.
---
You can turn it off an on just like loot bags. Just click on it in the Atom Shop.
---
Archery isn't too bad considering the plan is at the archery range for the crossbow at the pioneer scout camp. That's one but I heard the athletes isn't hard either.
---
Yea I found all that out when I got home &amp; was finally able to get it so now I'm thinking we do get to keep it which is pretty cool. I dig the look of it &amp; hope Bethesda do more of them. A Saint Pattys tent would be rad. lol
---
Wtf are you on about?
---
Yea, it's definitely a good looking tent. I enjoy collecting all of the seasonal items so if they do more tents I'd be extremely pleased.
---
I had it happen a couple of times, now I have no turrets, I seem to get attacked less now.
---
You can equip/unequip from the Atom Shop...
---
I am pretty sure, that if you leave your Xmas tent in place, it will stay looking like that.  It only changes if you move it after it's removed from the First Tab in the Atom store.
---
My record of put to the same server is four times.
---
i do this too, but with no chat bc i don't play with mic on since i need to put my headset and i don't like to use them for long period of time
---
this one was some of the best i saw last week 
---

---
Yes and no. It's nice that there's super rare stuff. I just wish it was super rare stuff that did something. Cosmetics should be reserved for the cash shop. In-game rarities should, at least some of them, be something that affects gameplay.
---
Like back when Vampire weapons were bugged. You know, when you could swing it at the air and still get the health regen. I found a Vampire Meat Hook. It felt like I had actually found a treasure. And it didn't really break the game. That's the ONLY time I've had that feeling on 76, that I found a rare thing.
---
Go to grafton pawn shop
---
Not discounting OPs achievement, but damn that's ugly. I wouldn't wear it anyway.
---
Define silence. They‚Äôve mentioned in at least one or two of the recent inside the vaults.
---
Nope, 1st players get all the benefits. Shouldn't be that way, but of course Bethesda is gonna do it that way.
---
You can totally get through the main quest and do just about anything in the game with a vanilla combat rifle.  Adding legendary effects means that it no longer takes half a magazine to put down a plain lvl 68 super mutant.
---
I think everyone has a different definition of end game.  Finishing the main story was where the game really began for me.  I like to solo stuff like V94, so soloing Scorched Earth is fairly easy by comparison.
---
U can easily regain the caps back.
---
Unfortunately the quad flamer only holds an additional 100 cartridges to the usual 300 cartridges. Battery Pack is a necessity, however.
---
Happened to me to. We just left the cave and finished the quest. It was legendary so we would've liked to kill it, but Bethesda had other ideas.
---
Like a lot in 76.
---
Did you happen to catch Dysentery?
---
I don‚Äôt know why people Downvoted you buddy! I‚Äôll upvote to make it right and even it out
---
Yep. It's a looong time bug. Worse is when a turret goes mental and starts attacking your own camp. Truly stellar stuff Bethesda.
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware. I don‚Äôt have any diseases listed in the effects section of the Pip-boy
---
Really nice work. I was wondering why my sneak wasn't working as well as it used too. I removed my chameleon mutation not thinking I would need it.  Thanks!
---
It is a global game some people can type perfectly in English but speaking is still difficult, or awkward because of accent.
---
I am on pc... so it does feel like this item spawning cheat would affect me.
---
Bethesda isn't able to literally track every item. Remember when the big old duping ban wave happened? They removed only the large stacks of items leaving 2x of each. If they were able to track literally every item they would have done so back then.
---
They are able to detect the accounts that spawned those items but since december 12 -&gt; december 16 was a free weekend literally everyone on pc could create a random account, boot 2 fo76 instances and go nuts duping stuff.
---
Downplaying an issue won't make it go away.
---
If this small change is enough to make someone buy 1st, while Bethesda has year old bugs in 76 that have yet to be fixed, I really have to question people's judgment.
---
I‚Äôm having the same issues since the update. I can be well hydrated, fast travel and be dehydrated.
---
Just tedious
---
I see your point I haven‚Äôt even done vault 94 yet. I‚Äôve probably missed tons of events too. I‚Äôll check it out sometime.
---
I think a lot of players would argue that it‚Äôs better for some cosmetics to be behind an effort barrier, rather than opening up your wallet.  If it weren‚Äôt for the exclusivity, this entire thread would not exist.
---
If you don‚Äôt feel like you got a treasure when a Mr. Gutsy drops a b/ss/str meat hook, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
---
Nope, on PC
---
Those numbers are pretty decent for your level actually, especially if that's non sneak damage. Like others have said get sneak shots when possible.  If it's unlocked drop points into adrenaline to boost your damage as you kill things.  If you don't have the plans yet for the handmade head to Harper's ferry and pick them up.  Build and scrap them to unlock mods.  Use a hardened receiver and perforating mag and suppressor.  Better yet is a powerful auto reciever if you are doing auto because dps gets things dead. I would ditch the 50 cal if you can, plenty of people would be willing to mod it for you.
---
A lot of gaming companies have a policy of not talking about exploits too much. The most you'll see is a "we are aware of an issue" or "this patch addresses an exploit".
---
Well, there is also the Chat Mod people actually are using, coordinating groups, nuke events &amp; trade.
---
Exactly the attitude I want to see more of
---
Thought i saw a post that data mined chameleon data and saw it had no impact on pve
---
I heard the games had a bunch of hackers recently
---
Oh I agree. Cosmetics should be behind an effort barrier. But if they're not going to be, since 76 has a cash shop, then give us some useful items behind the effort barrier.
---
I've never had a 'god drop' as people say. Even if I got the drop you mentioned, I don't have a Bloodied build, nor do I have any interest in making one. So no, that item wouldn't be treasure for me anyway.
---
On Xbox too? I thought that was only on PC?
---
I actually kind of like it. If they are going to have thirst and hunger in the game it needs to effect gameplay. I know it is easy to get water but you do have to plan a little bit more.
---
2S HM for 8k caps.  Thats the thievery right their.
---
They‚Äôre downvoting me as it is in the table bit. Omg I‚Äôve looked so many times and couldn‚Äôt see it. But to be fair was looking for a table and not some tiny thing. Thanks for the upvote though lol.
---
I‚Äôm not a big fun of data mining, Experimentation is my way to go, even Bethesda devs have no idea what they data meant and which one is actually applying (to don‚Äôt look far 250dr while reloading)üòÖ
---
It does seem to have kicked up a notch to me. I'm scanning around for nuka colas all the time now. Wish someone would nuke whitespring so I could get a ton of inert flux again (yeah, bad on me, I'm lazy).
---
No problem! Have a good one!
---
Potentially a pvp alt account for someone.
---
By any chance were you born in 1920? If so, I hope your 100th birthday rocks next year!!
---
Thanks
---
Yeah, but 90% of the players are not.
---
Levels do not matter in this game.  There may have been lag on your side where it seemed like he only shot once but may have mag dumped on your face.  Lessons learned: yes.....keep swinging until they are down and no longer moving.
---
Ok I'll check that out. Is there anything else? Like more PA paints or cool outfits?
---
Congrats welcome to the club
---
My eating and drinking habits are terrible in FO76, so I contract dysentery and parasites every 10 minutes üòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah, ever since patch 16 im getting thirsty alot faster, seems around every 15 min I'm parched, and have to drink 3 times, hunger seems to be the same as always though...
---
Yeah!! Makes it a true survival game! So in between scorchbeast fights and vault raids, gotta be sure to pop some canned dog food and some purified water lol
---
Try two brick walls next to each other in the same spot: bam! Wallpaper on both sides
---
If you're on PS4, I can make you a handmade that will get you over this hump.
---
This is something I've seen as well. I'm out in the mire and regularly get attacked by max level enemies. I recently knock my turrets down from 6 to 2 and rarely see enemies now.
---
They never really killed anything in the past anyway so now I just use them as an early warning system. Repairing things in my camp takes two seconds if anything gets destroyed so it's not much of a burden.
---
Yeah, but... 90% of the players would not chat anyway if there was a built in chat, but 100% of the people who get a chat mod wants to chat!
---
please use than instead of then all the time, otherwise interesting info
---
Sorry, misunderstood the question
---
TYVM, I'm waiting for part 3 with better sneak research.
---
In your opinion, what would be useful and worth grinding for?  If it‚Äôs not a weapon or silly outfit that basically says ‚ÄúI survived Appalachia‚Äù, your motivations are very different from the overwhelming majority of the player base.
---
That is one of the nicest things I have ever heard of in this game! I would lose my mind is someone came up to me and dropped me a little present üéÅ
---
Weapon or armor yes. Outfit, sure, just so long as the majority of the rewards aren't outfits. I'm OK with a grind, so long as it's a controlled grind of some sort. The grind for the coat, you're grinding events. But the reward is just a coat so it doesn't really interest me. Weapon and armor grinding, you're just grinding legendary enemies forever until the RNG gods, if ever, line up and you get exactly what you want.
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Hilarious and original !
---
Thank you, fixed.
---
I made a post like this and many people told me that missing 10 shots in a row at 95% hit chance is just bad luck, and not a statistical anomaly. Glad to see people finally agreeing something is up. Not to mention I feel like my rank 3 sneak perk isn't working as intended a lot of the time.
---
There's a nuka quantum paint and still the original nuka cola one
---
If we had an item, say a suit of power armor that‚Äôs better than the regular sets, that could be acquired through collecting a special resource and crafting it once you‚Äôve earned enough, that would be better than RNG?
---
Conclusion: Never go into PvP with a melee weapon.
---
Nice one, congrats
---
You're describing the Strangler Heart PA. And yes, even with the technical issues that PA has, and even how unenjoyable the "Raid" itself is, yes that's a better grind for me. Because it's somewhat controlled instead of running around like a chicken with its head cut off hoping for a drop. Not every rare thing has to be controlled like that, but I feel that most should be. You know, like an RPG. Complete quests or goals or whatnot for special stuff.
---
Issue with users in build zone though is that they can get trapped in your walls.  Heck, you can get trapped in your own walls as it loads in.  Ask me how I know.
---
I never said anything about one shots being good  the way they jacked up pvp already pretty much forces you to ignore certain weapons for pvp but yes i agree as for the cheating thing sure but so does a certain box to an extent
---
The problem is that I‚Äôm drinking purified water every 5 minutes, if not more often! I usually carry a minimum of 20 around with me at all times and within a half hour last night, I‚Äôd gone through 10.
---
Impossible to 1 shot a person. You can't do more than 110 damage per shot. Maybe they have a really good level 5 automatic pistol, like anti armor faster fire rate or something and you just have low health? Not a knock on you or your build just a suggestion.
---
Im doing pistols right now and let me tell you it's actually kinda fun , because compared to my heavy power armor build that would destroy groups in seconds the pistol build is kinda ass , so i actually got to take time and find cover and jump on shit
---
I found challey in there the other day but no graham to be found.
---
I can never find anything in those darn menus lol.
---
Yea, but as far as we know, the new Wastelanders moving back to the area can't live there &amp; we can't make them homes like in FO4.
---
Love it. I am was so pumped to get Santa outfit since I missed out last year. I pumped my weight up to max to capitalize on the outfit.
---
DAAAAAAMMMMNNN look at that level! 510! What do you do all day play on 76?
---
Love that!! Yes I missed it last year aswell !! Was super hyped so I could do this üíï
---
They already said scorchbeasts are here to stay
---
A couple of people mentioned this in passing, here's the details. Build a wall that has foundations on both sides. Build a door. Build another door on the other side of the wall. Using the menu you would to store or scrap, notice the edit button. Here you can change it from door to wall.
---
Concerning budget: I have wallpaper on all sides of my house, including outside. I have a bedroom, family room, living room, kitchen, bathroom and a workshop with every workbench, interior steel extractor and interior collection. Every room has lights (50 total), decorations, and in 3 rooms I have displays that help make the room (Kitchen stuff displayed in the kitchen for example). 
---
This something that can and is being done... good luck!
---
That's not the best photo angle either
---
Depends on the target, everything dies in one-shot except like an 80 SB, 91 DC, etc...I only have a BE lever + handmade, iirc a hunting rifle (and Gauss I'm sure) do more damage than the lever, so you would probably get even better results.
---
Unless u get a glitched node and u can spawn unlimited scorches.  Lol
---
Does this damage cap apply in normal adventure mode as well? I was under the impression it was just in NW.
---
It doesn‚Äôt sound like you enjoy F76 very much.
---
I want to be an Adrienne Barbeaubot.
---
Absolutely impressive
---
He might have fired twice. But it was not auto fire. Looked like a combat rifle. And I was in PA at the time, ultracite. I was full health at the time, just junking stuff.
---
There's a button to filter only things you can build. (Q on PC) if you haven't tried it already that might make it easier to find the table
---
Unrelated, but I love looking for pre-made structures to set up CAMP in. Where's yours located (in the third picture)?
---
Thanks, i do understand there are many factors so i appreciate the what u gave me. Might try a bloodied build and see how it works for. Thanks again
---
Its nice to see someone doing a comprehensive analysis. there is something incredibly odd going on with sneak with specific legendary effects and AI audio detection, that are not easily explained, especially after the last change to stealth in patch 15.
---
My assumption is that unmodified character weight is affecting stealth. my main has 5 20% WW reductions, level 2 traveling pharmacy and level 3 thru-hiker.
---
I guess i should finally clear out my stash and put together a set of legendary wood armors and do some testing.
---
That‚Äôs hilarious üòÑ
---
Certain aspects of it, no. Mostly it's the technical issues that I dislike.
---
I think I saw you last night at WS train station around 1900ish est. A few high lvls were shooting everyone while we played dress up with red dresses and Halloween outfits with party hats.
---
NW does not have the pvp cap, semi auto rifleman can easily hit 150+ depending on weapon (as a NW shotgunner i hit 118 with a bolt lever, and the 44 i have hit for 140 before)
---
What timezone are you? I got some stuff you can add to your giant sack üòÇ Message my GT (Badgerist), I'll prob be on from about 6pm GMT :)
---
Sadly that was not me!! However atleast you had a good time!
---
Lots of posts about weapons, armour and water/food deterioration increases since last patch.   Any regular has noticed the need to repair more often, and eat and drink more often since last patch.  It‚Äôs like they went from one side of the spectrum to the other.  I think they need to slide it back a little.  Or maybe they changed to increase our annoyance in another area of the game, to take our minds off other issues they haven‚Äôt addressed.
---
Mutations will to that.  So will a variety of chems.
---
Workaround to weight issues is switch to inert flux.  It is lighter than purified water
---
I‚Äôm EST! I‚Äôll message you :) thanks for the help of holiday fun ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification.
---
They didn‚Äôt remove all the duped items because loads of players bought these weapons without knowing they where duped , they wiped the inventories of the actual dupes , they literally said this.
---
&gt;
---
And also , I guarantee you that if you where to go on fallout 76 right now and stayed on it for 5 days consecutively you wouldn‚Äôt encounter any of these item spawning cheats , I‚Äôm aware downplaying an issue won‚Äôt make it go away , but these are  Youtubers Who are blowing a relatively rare issue completely out of proportion so of course I will downplay it.
---
If they admit it‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken‚Äù they have to offer a refund...
---
The game isn't broken.
---
Yes!
---
Idk, I‚Äôve been having a lot of fun lately fucking people up with a bloodied buzz blade. Trading commando headshots got a bit old...
---
I got my first one at around level 40, and traded it for 1000 .556 rounds to feed my newly looted level 35 TSE Handmade, the 2nd one came around level 150, I sold it for 10K to a friend that wanted one, now with my main at 350+ and another at 225+, I've never gotten another.
---
Many, MANY advantages and literally no disadvantages...I use no chems, rarely fix my weapons, never my armor, have a surplus of materials, never miss out on hitting legendaries, etc...
---
I sure did lol. I got a nice picture with a thicc boi in a red dress and heels.
---
360-450 with a headshot from lever-action and crossbow for a riflemen like me, depends on buff and armor ofc.
---
TIME TO SHIT
---
How about some actual game content instead for once? There are 100 requests a day for useless nonsense. Plushy dolls, wallpaper, etc... not one mention of immersion, enemies, nothing. Just bubble gum silly stuff. The whole fallout series will soon become Disney-fallout for 8yr olds. I miss the old fallout.
---
To stop the rampant cheating they could easily do it but requires resources and by the looks of massive content drop for Christmas event(scorch wear 3 different outfits, 3 new aid items(gift boxes), 3 new wrapping papers, and 2 Christmas decorations) we won't be seeing anything new in this game till February.
---
I always report every such listing I see on a ebay and similar websites, not just 76 either, Borderlands as well, these shitstains give dupers a bad name and worsen the ingame economy.
---
Yep, now we need paints for the tommy gun and tesla!
---
I grabbed it yesterday. Looks good on my Furious FSS gauntlet. Paired it with the Inspectors outfit...I'm diggin it.
---
Yes, I see this too, since the latest updates/fixes.
---
Same. Wasn't always the case.
---
I'm on console too. That doesn't mean I don't care about how the game is doing on other platforms.
---
Wasn't there also a new survival camp thats christmas themed?
---
I don't know all of the details on how it works, but I'd assume it's only copying the files and folders used by the game being updated.  So if there are 20g of files in a game, and you have a 15g update, it first downloads 15g, then copies 20g to backup, then does an install.
---
&gt; I've got a .50 cal handmade as my main weapon which has the anti-armor  legendary perk. I think it's only doing around 102 damage though 
---
What Level is it? A Max level .50 Hunting rifle  with just 3x 1 Rifleman perks (Ie +30%) should be doing more than that.
---
(Though Not sure Master Rifleman is available at your level)
---
That‚Äôs gotta be a site haha
---
Simplistic view, perhaps, but I'd figure it goes something like this:
---
1. any sold unit is good. 
---
2. Seller accepts a fraction of players will game the game.
---
3. Seller may have anti-abuse policy in place, which may or may not be pubicized.
---
4. Publicity, even if negative, is usually good
---
5. actively/openly stating "violators will be punished" may attract "good" gamers, and may be interpreted as a challenge by "bad players" 
---
6. see rule 1.
---
The underwear are glued on.
---
Hahahaha
---
This exactly.  Somehow I‚Äôve managed to get almost everything I‚Äôve set my mind to in the game, without the aid of cheating or whining.  It sounds miraculous if you were to believe this subreddit, but it‚Äôs true.  It‚Äôs almost as if the system was designed to reward persistence and dedication.
---
I've never seen someone so excited for 8 purified water.
---
Ooooo nice!
---
Every interface in this game is so clumsy.
---
Only message I ever got was from a mad 10 year old calling me a fucking retard for doing the one violent night to fast for his liking. Dude there was 2 minutes left calm down killer.
---
And they are fully functional (except for the fact that they have no clothes) and protect the player who spawned them.
---
I have found it now and it was with something weird and I was looking for a bigger table. The other things was with the old lady furniture.
---
That would be nice! For the tommy gun I would love to see a Sliver Shroud theme to it.
---
Wow just wow, how entitled are you that you just expect every game just to come a in game chat. Fallout isn't a game like Minecraft, Wow, Mabinogi, (insert generic MMO), Fortnite, or Elder Scrolls Online. Now if your good and buy 12 Power Armor skins from Atomic shop maybe they can hire the guys who made Elder Scrolls Online to add an in game chat.
---
If you check, you would realize that my post is older than that one. So no.
---
I own almost everything so that wouldn‚Äôt of help but thanks.
---
you are in the zone where you feel overpowered for the forest and underpowered for the divide and eastward.
---
It'll change in about 10 levels.
---
It does. You haven‚Äôt gotten all your free stuff. Complaining about free stuff is curious indeed.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
Woohoo! Also if it's ok I'll check out your plans, if we can trade any that would be great too :)
---
I have pacifist on because one of my characters is a grenadier who only uses explosives, but my commando sometimes fights back. Bloodied faster fire handmade usually cuts through them. Worst case scenario, I have an anti-armor faster fire auto Tesla. 
---
I would enjoy PvP if it was more "skill-based" and less "chem-flying kangaroo" oriented.
---
but did you know you can stay invisible, even if you move? 
---
for example: 
---
stand still until invisible, then jump 
---
you move upwards, yet still invisible 
---
same goes for shooting / reloading etc as long as you stay on your spot 
---
move, as in walk any direction, and invisibility will stop
---
You can't compare Star Trek Online to Fallout 76, ones a full game and ones a alpha version of a game.
---
&gt; stuff that can take 1000 hours to acquire. It actually feels special when you get it.
---
I agree. That is gold. 
---
So bad uncontrolled duping ruinied this mechanic, in most cases.
---
Given that a lot of us are hanging around fissure sites and sucking down rad chems these days, it makes sense.
---
I don‚Äôt really have awesome plans but sure !! They are just basic ones lower levels might not have !
---
Players have found a way to spawn in any entity. They have already spawned the Prdywen and a bunch of NPCs. They also have the ability to add any legendary effects they want to any weapon they want (I've seen an explosive baseball bat, as useless as that is, but it certainly proves a point).
---
Lvl 5 Combat Rifle? don't think they go that low
---
Hunting Rifle does, but even fully modded it won't do enough.
---
Are you sure they were alone? No one hiding out of sight and on their team?
---
Do you need the tadpole bag plan for the atomic shop bags

[its never to late to learn how to take better screenshots](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/windows.html)
---
As a 1st member myself, I really wouldn't care if my Tent got removed as long as I wasn't there and using it.
---
For some reason, it's possible for a Tent to load in right next to my camp sometimes, I literally had one blocking the steps to my Gun Shop a few days ago, it spawned in right in front of me.
---
Whats new? Bethesda always relied on others to fix their games for free.
---
I didn‚Äôt see you online last night but I can do it today atfer school at 12:10 around there
---
It's not just about NW. Players are spawning NPCs and the fucking Prydwen into Adventure mode. They can spawn anything they want from Fallout 4. They can add any legendary effects they want, up to 5, to any weapon they want - and they are starting to flood the market.
---
Wish there were some body guards out there.
---
With the holiday event going on it's a pretty good time to start a new character if you are inclined. Until the 31st there are holiday scorched which drop presents and a guaranteed legendary. You'll see a fair amount of them and the ones in the forest will drop level 1-10 items.  Your new character will be decked out in legendary gear pretty quick making the grind a little easier.
---
with regard to 'shockwave's, reply. is that 102 *actual* damage, or 102 in your stats ?
---
Lol i am going to try this build after this christmas event have been cleaning up like crazy suck an easy event. I spend most my time at the fissure sites and big bend tunnel with all the high level scorched. Thanks again
---
Dupers can‚Äôt manipulate your quest rewards, at least as far as I know.  If someone buys a coat from a trade forum, they didn‚Äôt exactly earn it to begin with.  It would be nice if more future ultrarare items were bound to character or account, which seems to be the trend.  The Arktos backpack paint is a good example.  Anyone who wears one legitimately ground that event.  The same with the strangler mask.  More of that would be nice.
---
That dusty old thing?!
---
&gt; Lazy people
---
hmmm‚Ä¶ call them however you want, but for some rl MVP game users it is more important to save a few minutes of his precios time than to spend some pocket money (5 bucks, 10, 20, 50...)
---
I dint see how its rare ive gotten that coat probably 20 times now
---
Or even if the entire map just had hidden ‚Äòhexes‚Äô that each one was a predesignated CAMP build area. Meaning that it didn‚Äôt matter where you placed your CAMP device, the build area was already pre-set. And if they were hexes, you could have ‚Äòneighbor borders‚Äô without any overlap. 
---
While you wouldn‚Äôt be able to finesse the edge of your border to just *barely* have that sign or tree or whatever inside your build area, it would make everything much more organized.
---
I saw a variation of this during the dark duping ages a year ago... a fat Santa running around dropping gifts of TSE‚Äôs to everyone. It was a very odd experience
---
lolll that is but atleast he was nice !!
---
How about they fix the game first?
---
OP linked to a trading sub in an edit, which we don't allow. I'll message them to get the edit removed.

And don't forget the cheated legendarys from PC...
---
No, thank you.
---
The whole sub: "hackers are ruining the game!! Bethesda plz!!1"
---
Also the whole sub: "let's give gold and silver and upvotes to one of the hackers!"
---
The duality of shill.
---
L159 melee, and completely understand you point.  
---
Don't think I've taken and stayed in a workshop since I was about L20.
---
I gather plenty of mats (to include fusion cores) in my normal roaming, so have no real need.
---
  I Just recently started taking workshops again, but only for the plans.  Then I get out of the zone.
---
Ps4 and xbox yes with pc i would say no only because they need to take care of the cheating first then it might be good. Im not saying cheating doesn't happen on console but not as bad as pc and that sucks because that is a lot of good gear that could be traded and there are good people on pc.
---
I only saw the one guy. And I think it was a combat rifle. As soon as I swung the hammer, his life went down to a little bit less than half, he jumped straight while shooting. I died right away.
---
it'd be yeah man
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Haven‚Äôt tried any outfits that would go great with it yet.
---
you should praising bethesda and THAN ask your real question, that is a sure way to get upvotes around these parts
---
Congrats! That‚Äôs no easy task!
---
nothing much, theres this grafton pawn show thing but its way too "well" hidden for regular players so better watch a 10 min video of it and be done with it - its not like there are any rewards for that trail
---
Congrats that‚Äôs amazingüëçüèª Can you earn more badges after you‚Äôve completed everything?
---
The fact that it keeps happening isn't an indication that the developer "isn't concerned" about it.
---
I wouldn't if I were you, wait for at least January
---
Thats some friend.  /smh
---
Decided to move my CAMP today and it was driving me crazy how often I was starving and getting dehydrated whole just trying to relax and build. I‚Äôm literally standing still or walking around my CAMP so there‚Äôs no reason why my dude should be dying after 10 minutes, it‚Äôs completely absurd and a waste of resources. Something is definitely going on, it feels like with every patch they increase the need for food and water.
---
This comment is under appreciated
---
No kidding dysentery almost ended me, what is this Oregon Trail?
---
Lots of people do. Hell, go look at how much item sellers made selling d2 items, owner of the item selling sites literally bought a 5mil$ mansion from selling items.
---
Lol I didn‚Äôt want upvotes just some help. Don‚Äôt understand why it would get downvoted though. But I do find it funny that someone is annoyed with my silly question.
---
I'm not sure. I'm gonna guess a new challenge drops every 24 hours, so most likely 7 PM ET each day.
---
Why they picked 7 PM I don't understand, everything else updates before 12 PM.
---
Maybe someone who paid attention to the Halloween challenges can weigh in on how that worked, I wouldn't know. I waited til all the challenges were live and then grinded them out at once. I'm a little ticked I can't do that this time üòñ
---
We have daily posts about it here, and *no one* from Bethesda has even acknowledged the issue. But they respond to things about the Atom Shop with way less upvotes, so we know they are seeing them.
---
So yeah, I think it's a pretty good indication that they don't really care. Either that, or they are unable to do anything - and knowing Bethesda, I think it's a combination of both.
---
That is because it is a peer 2 peer online game. There are no "servers".
---
Yes. You can still earn Possum badges from the Scout daily quests and Campfire Tales event
---
The daily scout quest and the event will drop badges at times.
---
I know what you mean. 
---
I've been collecting all the in-game outfits (got all but 9, atm) during +1 year, under two rules: 
---
to win the item via quest/world drop
---
to buy the item absurdly cheap (TS vendor-bot or player vendor).
---
For me, what it counts is the effort.
---
I could easily buy all those 9 missing √≠tems today (I swim in caps like most veterans) but I was going to miss all the future fun and emotion to randonly find any of them, here or there.
---
Oh well, for other users that does not count. it's all about to own it or not. That's fine, I don't share that pow, but I respect it.
---
I get this a lot too.  It's usually kids complaining that the prices of things should be X, like bobbles shouldn't sell for more than 100c.  Sometimes I try to explain them the way supply and demand works, and when they argue it should just be fixed, I tell them that's communism/socialism, and I'm just not into that.  It's kindof entertaining actually, and a little sad, to see how uneducated some of these people can be.
---
Oh i see, i saw there‚Äôs 500 badges displayed in the vending machine, I was like ‚Äòhow in the world can someone get so many‚Äô lol
---
üëçüëç
---
Thanks! I always wondered why I had a few badges that I didn‚Äôt know where they came from.
---
I actually rather enjoy PvP in this game. My Junkie's heavy guns/power armor build puts in a surprising amount of work. I can hold my own versus nearly any build, but it can be rough facing teslas. There's no equivalent gun for any other weapon class, so everything not Commando is second class at best.
---
That's my only real issue there: there's no variety in the current PvP meta. Hoping for a tesla nerf. That would at least make things more interesting at least for me.
---
Glad to see you enjoying this side of the game. Hope you get lots of entertainment out of it. Just remember to be a good sport. No need to be hostile just because you're PvPing.
---
Poor design? Give the players a sense of accomplishment? Because power armors were implemented and launch and backpacks after the fact?
---
Give it
---
got a penny
---
They added in monotonous task so its pads out how long the update was so it seems like it has more content than it really does.
---
 Now that we have private servers I‚Äôm begging for crossplay. My friends here play on PC but my PS4 character is stacked and I couldn‚Äôt imagine working my way back up to where I‚Äôm at now, especially with all the caps and trades I‚Äôve done to get all my unique gear from Reddit.
---
I haven't bought any either, and, I really didn't start doing daily/weekly challenges till much later in leveling up, as I was doing too many other quests. It would have been too much.
---
Worse, simply because at launch and during Wild Appalachia we had the hope that they would focus on good content instead of microtransactions. But they've shown their cards already, and it isn't looking good.
---
I expect Wastelanders will fail hard, and Bethesda will stop supporting the game entirely shortly after.
---
I've been running Stealth Characters for over a year now, and done a lot of testing with different armors, here's what I know from experience;
---
* Chameleon Armor effect does stack, but with diminishing returns (2nd helps, 3rd helps less.... 5th does hardly anything).
---
* Lighter Armor is better than heavy, and modding to Ultralight is just as affective as shadowed.
---
* High Agility has a very significant effect
---
   * Vanguard's/Chameleon Heavy Combat build with all 5 +AGI (Total Agility = 26), and Deep Pocketing on all pieces is better than my Character with Bolstering/Chameleon Heavy leather with Ultralight Mods  at 19-20 Agility, I recently swapped one piece with an Unyielding, HTD, + AGI heavy leather piece pushing my total Agility to 23, and it's working much better, but still not as good as my Vanguard's.
---
* I run Chameleon mutation on my characters, not sure if it does any good, but I do frequently go invisible when standing still, and the mutation has no undesirable side effects, so why not use it.
---
I'm hoping it's the pawn you got wrong there coz I'm liking the sound of that show lol I'll have an inquire and see if I need to watch a video on it
---
PA was in the game at launch. Much of the game revolves around it.
---
Backpacks came with the first major "dlc" as a utility item.
---
Small backpack can be picked up at lvl 2 now.
---
Honestly those numbers are extremely low. Look up the 5mil$ mansion the owner of "lewt inc" bought from Diablo 2 item selling.
---
  Athletes is difficult if you are overencumbered, as you may not move fast enough to complete the course in time.
---
I did Archer, codebreaker...and I don't remember which of these I finished first: mammologist or entomologist
---
Congrats! I finally got my Plans: Plasma Grenades from Lode Baring event. And that same day, I opened a Large Holiday Box, and got Plans: Plasma Mines. I am still after that outfit though, I'm jealous lol.
---
Big Bend is one of my go to farming spots especially now with the new holiday event. It‚Äôs hilarious following him and watching him fight off all the scorched on his own. If you‚Äôre ever looking for Grahm specifically there‚Äôs a chance he‚Äôll be bye or inside the tunnel, seems to be part of his dedicated route.
---
Something like this:

---
Cheaters and dupes suck, but crossplay would be a huge net good for the game. Maybe prioritize NW matchmaking so console players aren't frequently matched with PC, but being able to play with my brother on PS4 would be awesome.
---
Most likely he had a friend hiding and shot you a few times and the game is glitched to hell so it didn't seem like you got hit a few times. Bloodied sneak or just bloodied can kill you in 3 shots most times.
---
I‚Äôm definitely against that I like the freeness to place the camp anywhere and slightly nudge the boundaries to be on top of as many resources or to have a great view etc. I put a lot of thought into camp placement.
---
I‚Äôm pretty amazed to see it all completed. Congrats! You deserve a perfectly preserved pie!
---
Right!?
---
As much as I'd like the backpack with the options like armored, colled, etc. I so far have not been able to bring myself to go through the trouble if grinding my way through that whole thing to get it. I grabbed the free one at Morgantown airport and crafted it at level 50 for  an extra 30 lbs. carry weight and I'm ok with that for now.
---
So I'm making a deductive argument. Essentially to substantiate the claim I have to prove:
---
That it is more likely than not a reasonable person would understand all Fallout 76 microtransactions would be cosmetic, (something BGS has affirmatively stated), and hence all future non-cosmetic content would be free.The fridge and the junk collectron are 'utility items', definitionally non-cosmetic. Therefore they are expected to be part of the free DLC/content.
---
BGS can then argue 'unforeseeability', which is essentially what the 'ItV' update on the atomic shop did. However this has a few problems. the Australian Consumer Law explicitly says *the party or other person is taken not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation, unless evidence is adduced to the contrary*. Essentially they have to prove that they had every intention of keeping the Atomic Shop cosmetic but were surprised by the backlash. But this is undermine by 
---
(a)Todd Howard taking about the B.E.T.A. at E3 2018 saying "it's going to break". Following up in 2019 by talking about the industry wide trends:  "this is not going to be a high metacritic game, that‚Äôs not what this is, given what it is. And all of the games like this, whether it‚Äôs us or somebody else, ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a period once you launch, it‚Äôs not how you launch, it‚Äôs what it becomes". He then goes on to talk about ESO launching "within our own company" and acting as a point of reference.
---
(b) Pete Hines continuing to say in a stream during the B.E.T.A. when it became clear how broken the game was, and apparent fixing it would be a long term (read costly) process, that "if, you know, you want to buy stuff that you don‚Äôt have enough atoms for, yes you can use money to buy those things; it‚Äôs all cosmetic". He was involved in launching ESO, including the tumultuous path to what it is today.
---
It was forseeable.
---
They 'advertised' (promised) private servers at launch. It wasn't explicitly called Fallout 1st, but charging a subscription fee for them is completely standard and reasonable. I'd have paid the subscription just for the Christmas tent. I'd have paid for the arktos fridge if the grey one was free. They're not going to go bankrupt. Atoms and private server are worth the price
---
If it still helps, I instantly found an Indigo level 5 after reading the comment above. I had fast travelled to the collision event but it had ended as I arrived but the three reward crates were still full for me and it was the last item in the final crate.
---
The scorched that are acting like statues don‚Äôt jingle until they ‚Äúwake up‚Äù
---
I frequently kill them by shooting at the same time that I vats, and sometimes don‚Äôt realize I got one.
---
My problem is even if I wanted to do the quest line, my friends are never online, So I can't have one of em down themselves for part of the quest
---
Hopefully this weekend that will change
---
Yeah at times, been stuck at 8 badges for over two weeks. 
---
Mind you I can't play everyday and campfire tales is so much rarer now. But I will get that backpack mod one of these years...
---
Indeed, playing this way since FO3 and found CB around level 20-30 haven't left since(405).Enjoy!üòÅ
---
Fast traveling increases your thirst and hunger a bit each time. If you're hopping all over the map hunting Scorched for the holidays, that'll do the trick. 
---
This question has been brought up once or twice before with previous patches, and both those times nothing actually changed about the hunger/thirst rates.
---
Here I was impressed I got enough to get the backpack. Congrats Master Possum Scout!
---
Well, agree to disagree. What's the point of debating this.
---
I dont understand how having an unlimited scrap stash isn't an advantage. So as I got it 80% of my stashes was emptied. Now I have more room to decorate camp and sell stuff but ok.
---
Post here when you're ready, someone will help you. I can help if on xbox when I'm on.
---
Oh no I forgot about that. RIP
---
I think they are downplaying how much they actually make. 20 to 50k is extremely low for RMT sellers. 
---
&gt;If you doubt, even for a moment, if even a shred of you doesn't believe me, that there's this much money to be made off Diablo items, just look at this slipup from his partner in crime getting a little public spotlight time

---
&gt;Back in 2009 Aaron Cicchelli, "listed as a contact person for d2legit.com", bought a $5,000,000 mansion. Now, anyone who was that much into D2 knows that d2legit.com is just another part of the large family of websites run by "lewt inc". Lewt is sorta like the Diablo mafia, and they make a LOT and a LOT of money feeding off the addiction of blizzard gamers
---
Pvp melee used to be possible before the damage cap. You could stay sprinting with Cavaliers armor protecting you, then vats teleport melee someone and one hit them
---
Mostly every Tuesday for timed items. Sometimes it‚Äôs 2 weeks.
---
The only logical thing I can think of is his buddy was chameleon stealthed and you didn't notice him. People do this all the time using a wanted guy or a low level guy as bait.
---
Change that to console players not get matched with PC at all, at least in NW. (sorry to those that are giving it a fair run) I like the way NW is without all those cheating bastards. I would like to see PS4 and Xbox pitted against each other in NW especially.
---
It would help to explain it, but when I‚Äôm standing still (due to being AFK or on the pip-boy etc.) or not moving around much, my thirst levels drop far too quickly. 
---
After playing since almost day one, it hasn‚Äôt been an issue until now.
---
I‚Äôll have to keep this in mind hopefully it‚Äôs the same on Console
---
Then don't comment?
---
Dude I'm a stealth commando pvp guy and randomly sparked pvp with someone who pulled out a death claw gauntlet and we fought for like 20 mins and it was actually a lot of fun.
---
for the "Battery" weapons i would say so, since you can convert near empty cores into fresh ones. with ammo smith 2 cores becomes 3 cores, and even more with super duper
---
Took me less time to get the backpack than getting a full set of power armor.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be as disturbing if the RMT people making bank off this game weren‚Äôt also largely duping their products so they can infinitely resell their goods at no personal cost. 
---
Still disturbing, though. The people who praise RMT as an acceptable practice are a different breed, to be certain, since it‚Äôs p2w. While I get that the game is flawed, RNG is a jerk, and not everyone has time to grind, the people supporting RMT stuff are (bitter pill time) sticking up for people who shamelessly duplicate and massively overcharge for their gear. 
---
And some of it definitely shouldn‚Äôt be able to be sold, like strangler power armor.
---
I'll have to try and get a good one. It's difficult because my camp is 3 structures. 2 small buildings dedicated to crafting and vending. With the glass dome in the middle.
---
&gt; these shitstains give dupers a bad name
---
what????
---
dupers are trash in any case!
---
It's irrelevant if they sell the duped trash in eBay or don't.
---
Trash is trash.
---
Look out! You've got the taste for blood now!!
---
Most importantly, did you have fun?
---
Yeah the terminal is free and could be used for something like that. Even if it was limited to preselect messages.
---
I actually enjoy a bit of PvP, and typically hold my own very well, even when outnumbered, but the QFFR Tesla is a game breaking, no skill piece of Crap that I would like to see removed from the game completely, I have one, but only use it if others do 1st.
---
I had a session a few days ago with 2 players that started out using ballistic weapons but switched to Teslas after I killed them several times, they finally got a kill on me then messaged good game, I messaged back that it was until they started using the Teslas, and the guy said they only did that because I was using Stealthboys.
---
I also wouldn't mind seeing Vats completely disabled in PvP.
---
That's what I like to hear! When I take a shop and they put up a fight it's so much fun. How many super mutants, ghouls, and scorched can you kill? I like fighting a real thinking human.
---
But is the non-prime Ultracite weapons worth using? Sorry meant to clarify that in the post
---
Yes that will be 500 atoms please, you wanted IT
---
- BGS
---
When I sweep the floor with a whole crew it makes me feel like a regular wasteland badass.
---
If you're going to use Gatling Lasers in the first place, then yes, the Ultracite is largely worth it.  
---
The biggest downside is how rare the plans and mods for it are, so you may be rocking a fairly basic configuration for a while.
---
IIRC Grahm isn't a random encounter, he follows a trade route.
---
Says the person trolling these boards? Lol. I'll hand you a jangles and you just point at where Bethesda hurt you.
---
Yeah thats what i fear the most tbh, tho some events like Line in the sand drop the plan for it, so hoping to get it from that
---
He was out bid several times at over 15K trying to buy one on here, and offered 15K for it, but I always discount things heavily to friends.
---
See I never knew that, I‚Äôve never been a fan of PVP to be honest. I usually play with my husband and brother (lvl 65 and 100 and something) and we came across a couple people that had almost no health, had explosive weapons, lower level, did not take any damage at all, and you they couldn‚Äôt even get a single shot in before getting killed with one hit. I like a challenge in games, but now I know when I have no chance.
---
Just go there at night time and the event will start it's not rare
---
I'm stuck on that same stupid one. Which platform?
---
Well that is just insane. People are bonkers. Next time I'll just ignore the provocation

TS is not good for shotguns. At least I haven't found a way. Instigating is amazing with the high damage of a double barrel.
---
My shotgun guy 1 taps most things I'm the chest with only warlords needing to be hit in the head.
---
I/E is amazing for any shotgun.

I commented about hackers in Fallout 76, pointing out that it isn't in any way the worst case that I've personally come across in, well, for as long as there has been online gaming, nor that Bethesda would somehow be the only company whose game has suffered from this, or that it would even be in any way rare. It's absolutely commonplace, and happens all the time, in a multitude of games, from even bigger companies than Bethesda, ones that should have years and years more experience with combating these things.
---
I commented that because sometimes it's good to have some discord in the bubble, so that it doesn't become a complete echo chamber, which is what has happened to some other subreddits.
---
I'm not, however, going to debate whether game developers care about what they're doing, when there's absolutely nothing actual and concrete to show that they don't, because that's not a conversation worth having, and not really a conversation at all, but simple emotional bashing of a company and a game.
---
I've been rocking mine for months now, since before the update that made Vendor plans less random. You used to be able to occasionally find Mod Plans in Harper's Ferry.
---
Still haven't managed to get the base plans to drop, but hopefully you'll be luckier than I am.
---
I had to remove my turrets because they kept killing my poor Brahmin.
---
It doesn't require a microphone?  you can just shoot small msgs as needed, focused to individuals, different groups, etc.  It sucks having to drop to the Playstation chat to do that.
---
Instant fix, thx!
---
People who say there's no skill to it are the ones who seem to lose a lot. If I spend countless hours tweaking a build, farming chems, bobble heads, high voltage hefe, whatever the case is to make me do more damage and live longer is that not in itself a skill? I figured out a better build than the other guy, and now I can kill him even though we have same weapons. There's also stealthy aspects, keeping a distance and choosing different weapons for situations, etc.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me once. Mr. Fuzzy didn‚Äôt appear in display for me but players on my team could still see it. Re-log fixed it for me.  Hope that helps.
---
Why would core functions of the game change?
---
Such as?

Trolling? Never before have I heard that speaking The truth is trolling...

There's at least one intelligent ghoul coming named [Mort](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5POGB2AdrZDMt1vR9LXQNf/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-happy-thanksgiving).
---
I like the idea of bringing back Karma, but I'd rather it be tied to the individual actions, not other players. I also don't want any more situational passive perks that I'm gonna have to be swapping out. It's bad enough already with lockpicking, hacking, chemist, scrapper, super duper and so on.... 
---
But  yeah, Ghoul towns would be really cool. I'd do something with Mosstown in the Mire. It's really not used for anything, and it's close to Dyer Chemical, a location that has a notable ghoul history.
---
That‚Äôs a really good idea for the workshops, I‚Äôm a casual player and there‚Äôs a lot of plans that I still want to get so I‚Äôll try this out. Thank you!
---
I am guilty of owning a quad tesla. What will fix the Tesla is making it so if your shot arcs within range you will damage yourself too. So closing the gap one someone using the gun will make it useless. Makes no sense to be invincible against arcing electricity just because it came out of your own gun, when you're not immune to your own explosions.
---
Is now a public event no longer triggers that way.
---
Level 510 incredible :) only 484 levels to go.
---
Cooool! I just got the ultracite gat laser prime mod last night. I've had a *** zealots ffr sitting in a wall display until I could mod it!
---
Wasnt that king of like talon company? A group of "bounty hunters" that would continually get their asses handed to them when they turned up to collect?
---
&gt;Hey Bethesda, do yourselves a favor and prove this guy wrong and show your community that you do care, because right now from where I am sitting it sure as hell looks like he is correct here.
---
You're right they do care, they care he bought the game a dozen times. They want more people to do that.
---
Have a swim in the Toxic Valley waters and you will pick up mutations quick.
---
I have a quad auto Tesla with FFR.  I have one because at this point in the game I enjoy collecting or acquiring rare or unique weapons and I consider that to be one of them.   That being said, I know it‚Äôs glitched and like to PvP but rarely bring it out because quite honestly it‚Äôs not fair.  Neither are the overpowered explosive plasmas or lasers.
---
Yup major issue on the PS4. No fix from Beth yet, the best way to avoid it is to clear out your Aid section. Keep essentials only.
---
I haven't been actively looking for ultracite weapon plans. However, I play since beta and only have a handfull of available mods for my ultracite laser. So I guess plans are rare.
---
To be perfectly honest, I don't play FO76 and have no real intention to. Not out of some consumer activist corporate spite, but because it simply doesn't look good/interesting enough for me to invest what little free time I have into another videogame treadmill. 
---
I don't ascribe any kind of maliciousness to OP or hold him to some standard of truthfulness and that's because we're so far out from the release of the game if he was trying to get brownie points from the internet for beating a dead and buggy horse he's long past the prime-time to do so.
---
I'm taking OP at face value, he doesn't seem like he's a programmer or even has that much knowledge about cheats or anti-cheats. He said he saw a post on a forum and posted it here, not checking to see that what he posted was 100% up-to-date and accurate, and that happens all the time. I mean heck i've done it. Seems like OP is genuine and not trying to rile everyone up.
---
Thanks, for now I think I‚Äôll stay away from the display cases for now to avoid any problematic bugs.
---
This post is, obviously, my experience. And I personally haven't seen anything this bad - not even in WoW custom servers. I'm sure there have been other games out there with a worse hacking problem, but I haven't been there. Still, I appreciate other opinions.
---
Bethesda can show that they care by actually doing something instead of letting hackers run rampant for months. Just as you don't have anything concrete to show that they *don't* care, I don't have anything concrete to show that they do. Thing is, clock is ticking.
---
I never liked using a mic!I prefer to write down what i have to say(plus i'm pretty shy).So a chat would be super nice and comfortable
---
He's too powerful to be kept alive!
---
This is the type of exchange I enjoy as well.  
---
I‚Äôm predominately an auto rifle build so have a number of weapons to test drive but mostly lean on auto FFR handmades or auto FFR combat rifles.  Once in a once it‚Äôs fun to bust out an radium rifle or gamma gun or explosive harpoon or railway rifle just to work in some variety.  My bloodied FFR gamma gun in particular is a hoot.
---
If you are on PC I have all the mods unlocked.
---
I don't mind modding it for you.
---
They used to.
---
Sound more like mods. But I can see how that can be a problem.
---
This happened to me before where my Xbox thought it was not installed anymore. So it started that huge download but I canceled and restarted Xbox and it was normal again. Hopefully this works for you.
---
Lol you are definitely wrong. It's the same as people who buy boosted accounts for ranked games like LoL or whatever. People want to be "good" at games without putting the effort in.
---
Its just like the Halloween event friend you can wait until the last item is available then grind and you can unlock everything in a good run not having to do it daily.
---
What does that mean? Faster circle forces people to move, well faster. I didn't mind the small circle but it needed 3 setting instead of 2. Being 1 player short of a full map was cramped as fuck.
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
They are simple scripts run with a cheat such as Cheat Engine (yes, a multiplayer game in 2019 is letting players use Cheat Engine). Anyone can do it.
---
If you need to revive someone, use a spike trap in your camp to launch them. Itll down them when they hit the ground. Then theres no need to let low level enemies chew on you for a bit
---
Most give Scrip.
---
I loved the talon company, supplied me with new gear in the early game.
---
Thanks, think I‚Äôll stay away from display cases for now to avoid future problems.
---
Not true.. Same thing happens to me..
---
Congrats!
---
The Christmas event has been a godsend for this.
---
I have managed to finally complete Chemist in two more accounts.
---
Need to check if they have fixed the issue with 'Cook' not 'registering' the chef hat and Electrician not registering the powering on events.
---
If they have soon I will have done this x3 :)
---
In the early days they balenced the economy, made things affordable, now that people are selling with real money it balloons the cost of everything!
---
Can you put it on the small back pack plans you get from the overseer stash at the air port?
---
I thought that a few weeks ago but I then found the thing that was free and it dissapeared. Then the same yesterday.
---
I find this entire debate and discussion a bit funny because what‚Äôs the difference of someone spending real money to buy a BE handmade on EBay or paying real money to buy atoms or paying real money to be a FO1 member?  Personally, it‚Äôs their money and they can do what they want with it. 
---
I‚Äôve said this from the beginning having played the game for a year now that if they made god tier drops a little more common you wouldn‚Äôt see the dupers or sellers profiting from this the way they are.  Quite frankly, I‚Äôm surprised Bethesda didn‚Äôt start selling high level weapons and armor (for atoms) in their shop.  Increase cap limits to 100K and let it rip.
---
That's hilarious. I love turning off people's lights if I can sneak into their locked up camps.. if I have them on me, I drop a few empty beer bottles and a raw rubber on their bed as well.. lol ü•¥
---
You are going to also provide a legal definition for the word cosmetic, there isn‚Äôt one to my knowledge. The definition of cosmetic I like is ‚Äúnot substantial‚Äù.
---
Yeah can you imagine what kind of shithead you would have to be to sell a item that takes very little work to make a infinite amount of for like $20. It would be like if a game company used lots of already made items in a new game and locked them behind a paywall because "fuck you give me money if you want a game with options".
---
Well, unfortunately, I for one don't see them being *able* to fix things, at least not all of them, what with how the engine is built. That's just the engine we're playing on, and it isn't in any way secure against abuse like this.
---
The engine worked fine as a fun co-op mode with occasional casual PvP, and I'm sure the people at Bethesda foolishly assumed that people aren't complete degenerates but that's what people are, and people are the reason why multiplayer games almost always get ruined. I count myself a part of that group, since even though I don't use hacks, I'm sure there are some ways I, too, have made the game worse for others.
---
Nuclear Winter just simply shouldn't have been made, it's never going to be secure and free from hackers since there will always be hackers out there. In Adventure mode, it's less of an issue, since those hackers aren't at least instakilling everyone on the server with some hack command, or putting people in cages where they can't get out of, or stealing all of your shit, which is what happens 24/7 in GTA:O.
---
Cheat Engine, now that's something I haven't heard in a while. They might as well let us have modes.
---
i would say so yes, only downside is it is a HUGE pain to find mods for it. but you can prime it farther to increase the damage per shot.. plus green beams
---
I don't care about the one shot thing. I have weapons that dropped for me, lots of them, that will one shot most enemies. 
---
The thing that annoys me with it is that it's so badly screwing with vendor sales of weapons and armor that actually drop legitimately.
---
What‚Äôs the deal with the free one again?  How do you acquire at the airport?   I recall having to access the overseers computer or something to that effect.
---
I'm sure this is an item that will return at some point.
---
üëç
---
Maybe insane but I've done it before. Sometimes it's fun to do bad things in the Wasteland, and personally I think it's kind of fun when people do the same to me. At the end of the day people can't do anything to you that you won't allow.
---
Maybe they changed the fast travel rules back to how they were before? I can say for sure it's not any worse standing still, because I went AFK yesterday for nearly an hour, just walking past to bump the controls every so often and I only lost half a thirst and food bar.
---
You can get a small backpack just by going to morgantown airport. 
---
The standard backpack quest takes about 3 hours. Maybe less.
---
Im just gna hug the edge the whole time small or not if bullets fly at me and i panic which i probly will im heading into the death zone
---
Its in an overseers cashe you just gotta pick it up at the airport
---
Fuck no, not until the PC cheating is fixed.
---
This is incorrect sorry. The xp doesnt stack like it did with halloween.
---
If you earn more xp than your current challenge, it wont carry over to the next one
---
Just go to any event and revive anyone who goes down. Find low level players and follow them around.. they are always being downed. You don‚Äôt need a friend online for this particular task.
---
There are also non-holiday legendary scorched. AND decapitated invincible docile scorched! Tis‚Äô the season.
---
Yeah, so I haven't been interested in PVP since before they neutered survival but have found myself really enjoying it the past few days. I've been doing pretty good using a melee character with crap gear and [an appearance](https://imgur.com/a/R9Ho9aN) that makes people want to fight me. Agro dudes are always easy to spot and bait because they are always wearing skeleton costumes for some reason. 
---
I think a mix of new players that aren't totally geared is part of it. It's really hard to get close enough to take down a stealth commando with just melee, especially in an open area with no cover,  but my buzz blade usually out DPSs everything else once I've closed in.
---
There's probably some cool people like that but there's also a chunk of people who would roll up spouting bs and calling bad names to try and provoke you into fighting, rarely 1 on 1, and then get mad when they got zipped up.
---
There's a big difference between anecdotal experience and empirical evidence.  Running tests, recording the results, then analyzing the data tends to lead to more reliable interpretation (especially as the amount of gathered data increases) than datamined formulas in a very buggy code base.
---
"Research" üòÇüòÇ
---
You provide no usefull info on anything a chimp can figure out More in 5 minutes. You truely have proveb how fucking stupid FO76 players are
---
Got archer done,  hunter one says I have all but kill yugio with syringer and a wolf with a knife.
---
Not sure for third yet.  Just finding a specific creature looks like the pain in the butt part of the rest.
---
Have 3 of 6 for hacker done it says but haven't launched nuke yet so not sure if I should skip that one as I dont know about it
---
NP.  
---
For initial takeover:
---
Check the map for other players in the area.  If none, or if they are low level (very little threat) Clear the CG enemies, recheck the map.  If still clear, Initiate takeover.   While the dish is ratcheting up, head to the green line/edge of the zone.  Watch the takeover progress bar.  As soon as takeover is complete, step out o the zone.
---
Mission complete, and you'll get the rewards.
---
For defend, do you have a scoped rifle?
---
If you are still nearby when the defend event pops up, check the map - if not a player takeover, head back, stay outside zone, and snipe the CG enemies.   
---
  I know for certain Posiedon, Charleston junkyard, and the one near new gad can be defended from outside the zone.  New gad and the junkyard have some good sniper spots on the adjacent hill.  
---
Posiedon is tedious, because there is no elevated sniper position, and you have to deal with whatever is in the trainyard.
---
  Hemlock holes can also be defended from outside the zone, but that one is often another player, not CG.
---
I'd think Beckley can also be defended from outside, as the hill behind it should have a good sniper spot, but I haven't tried it there.
---
Lol very well said agree...
---
Been saying much the same thing since launch. An still get flammed for saying this game is shit tier at best. The game is broken beyond repair, an  now I'm just waiting for the inevitable player base wipe, or the game shutting down.
---
That looks dope!!
---
I clicked that picture and literally laughed out loud at work. That's a very hateable look lol
---
I will not be seeking out more PVP, but I did enjoy being able to fight back.
---
If you give them a minute, they will turn legendary. Don‚Äôt kill them right away! Saw one in the tunnel last night. I ran back while he chased me. Eventually he started to glow, then he gained a star, and finally said legendary next to his name.
---
The decapitated ones are the worst haha
---
Has happened to me with the magazine rack. I thought the one in the upper right corner was missing but my teammate saw it just fine.
---
So you have to take on radiation to heal and your previous radiation accumulated on your hp bar doesn‚Äôt affect it?
---
I'm sure they could at least make a fog machine that had snowflakes, like the bats in that fly out of the halloween one. And maybe white smoke..?
---
I'm not nearly that good!
---
When I was playing without rad X it looked like I wasn‚Äôt regenerating.
---
Don't you just want to pummel my face? :)
---
So if I played 1 NW match... All xp stops? Or can I get to the next tier and play one match to roll over when the time comes?
---
So confused. Didn't play Halloween at all.
---
It really is not that bad.  Hardest part is reviving someone but post here and someone will almost certainly help. I put it off for a really long time because so many people said it was so grindy and took forever.  Once I decided I wanted to get it done it took one single 2 hour play session to do 3 badges and everything other than the revive, which a friend helped me with a day or two later.  Archery, the athletics, and Hunter were all easy.  Half of the 2 hour session was because 2 of the athletics courses were in places I had not discovered yet and ended up exploring while I was there.
---
Possum badges are grindy though but then again I don't really like any of the mods personally. The only one that interests me is the high capacity but I don't want the defense hit so haven't bothered with it
---
That‚Äôs absolutely the case 
---
I once came across a lvl 4 at Whitesprings and initiated a trade and this person had high level weapons and gear so glad I didn‚Äôt PvP because he or she would have worked me over!
---
Gotta get it now, for the same reason I got the Liberty Prime Skin. it annoys others, ho! ho! ho!
---
I am having the same problem in game and also when I log out with full health, next time I log in I am down by half on both food and water also I am getting the old glitch of the weapons not loading in with a full mag have to reload each time and occasionly it does it to me when I fast travel.
---
It looked like without Rad X that my hp bar didn‚Äôt go up unless you heal when taking on radiation and not when you already have radiation damage.
---
He just wants some structure to the pointlessness of loot. It makes sense to me. Old fallouts you knew where the rare guns and armor  were. In mmos you go to a dungeon and that weapons in there. Instead for us we can kill a million legendaries get no god roll. Turn it into script and get ten thousand walking canes with stupid effects. Hell we could get a god roll on one and it would be the useless ironic hell that is the grind. That‚Äôs just for a weapon you then have to do armor and power armor.  I wish the raid wasn‚Äôt so incredibly tedious. Only one of the sections is worth doing and their aren‚Äôt that many groups Diving into it. I also don‚Äôt know anyone that does it after they get a set.  To top it off the sets  been broken the entire time. But At least the static items in the game are a good opener for new players.  I always wished the star system was a craft based system. Rare Matt‚Äôs from dungeons and grinds to build them up. So you‚Äôd still have to put time in but not a potentially infinite time frame.
---
Ultracite won't make a bad gun good, but it will make a good gun better. 3 more damage per shot, with the ROF of that gun (about 27 rounds per second), adds up to 100-something additional DPS over a regular gatling laser. That ain't nothing.
---
And you want to prime it.
---
Yea but scrip just pours into legendary gamble time. I'd much rather have a trophy from doing a daily quest repeatably. At least to make it seem like your making progress lore wise.
---
You log data for cryptids and what not and dont see any sort of results or benifits.
---
You can get the ultra cite Gatling laser plans from presents right now. They are expensive to craft though if I remember from when I was crafting and scrapping to learn the mods.
---
FOR SURE
---
It sounds like a good build but I don‚Äôt wanna drop endurance charisma or intelligence any lower than they already are.
---
The Chat mod hasn't needed an update since august 20th. So, if you update SFE you would have needed exactly 0 updates of the chat mod in the last 4 months. Not an awful big bother to be honest. But hey, I'll go back to chatting and organizing stuff with fellow chatters and you go back to complaining that there is no good chat and we'll see who is more happy about their individual results. 
---
I would prefer a built in chat, of course. But we have what we have and I prefer to enjoy it.
---
I have a quad explosive with fletchettes mod and it‚Äôs pushing 800dmg without any chems or most perks activated.  That weapon is bananas
---
My weapon of choice is a BFFR LMG, it out ranges most other FFRs significantly, and range is great when facing Tesla wielding wanna-bees so often.
---
My sons character has chameleon and it doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything more then hiding does.  At least against the average scorched or super mutant.   I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth giving up armor to have it.
---
Got some bugs in your panties huh?
---
Me too!
---
Edit: my bad.  Just realized your talking about an armor type.  Nvm
---
Awesome
---
I got it too, not from a small one though.
---
Because PA is garbage. I killed a lvl 80 in PA at lvl 6. 4 swings with a standard meat hook.
---
Happened to me as well during double XP.  i ran out of ammo and just ran. lol
---
Contact bethseda is what i would recommend
---
That was when Sony still didn‚Äôt fully support cross-platform. They fully support it now
---
Ever upwards!
---
There is also a "clean" version in the data mined files, so I hope that release that one soon.
---
Where are you seeing otherwise?
---
Just 3 badges
---
To unlock the Standard Backpack, only complete 3 Tadpole challenges.
---
Damn. Which ones are easy? I have been failing so hard at all of them. The athletics course and coding ones are what I am targetting. I have the swimming one.
---
Athletic and archery are fairly easy, so is hunter.
---
The other challenges will award you badges to trade at dedicated machines. This allows to get the hat, posters and such.
---
The plan is moderately rare but the mods cost a ton of ultracite (among other things) to learn so start hoarding it haha
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can mod your laser for ya
---
I actually got the Plasma Grenade plan before the Christmas event started, but didn't complete the challenge until today. Chemist was my last badge
---
Back in the day I remember that some badges where bugged
---
Heck. Yes.
---
I got the Plasma mine and the Torso Combat Armor Dense lining plan too^^
---
Haha, that is a very instigating appearance....i love it!  Fuckin chomo!
---
Only if you can explain to me why I'm not allowed to sell them in the vendor or make them for friends, but inexplicably can sell plans for their mods.
---
I use this post a lot to compare weapon damages. It has damage vs each enemy as well, including the SBQ. Very handy tool.

I carry all the different backpacks to fit the need. When I'm going to West Tek for example I wear the armor backpack after I kill all the super mutants I switch to high capacity for the trip home. Same when I'm collecting something that will spoil or if I'm in a rad area I just switch them around. Works beautifully.
---
It sounds like a great idea that would add to immersion and interesting design, but I have no faith right now that the devs could implement it without breaking fundamentals of the game. They can't even import FO4 code that lets us place stairs on the (non centered) sides of the floor squares for crap's sake.
---
My gf occasionally has her displayed items fall through the display case and sometimes through floors after that.  Only happens on her screen but they are either on the floor under the case or a story down on the floor directly underneath where they should be.  Never happens on my screen just hers.  Its weird.
---
i ran into him here as well a long time back
---
one of my lower leveled friends drank nukashine and woke up in the bog near the tunnel so i fast traveled to him along with another friend to help him out, heard Grahm talking while walking through big bend tunnel it was quiet amusing.
---
What servers, East or west? I‚Äôd be happy to help, but I can‚Äôt play much except on weekends.
---
I compared damage numbers last night from an AA Prime Gatling Plasma, Hunters Prime Gatling Plasma and Zealots Prime LMG on the Queen.  AA was best at average of 12 per hit, Hunters 11 and LMG at 4-5.
---
good thing The Children of Atom aren't around, there would be a cult war for sure!
---
hot take: I really like the Pioneer Scout challenges. The only bad ones (other than the broken ones) are the ones that require you collect a bunch of magazines, or craft items with unnecessarily rare plans, since your only control over getting them to spawn is to just scour random spawns until you finally get lucky.

Some people do not want to/cannot use a microphone and emotes are cumbersome for communication.

My camp is on the edge of Whitespring, and sometimes I come in and the nearby robots are hostile to me. I wonder if my turrets are attacking them. Maybe I should get rid of them?
---
I have the backpack on 2 characters, along with the armor mod on 1, and the armor and energy on another. Not horrible to do considering there's not much else to do
---
Agree with comment above, but swimming was easy too, I believe.
---
Once all rewards are available, you can do challenges in order. Any XP over that 1Xp for the wreath will apply to the second challenge. 
---
The difference between this and Halloween event is that XP is earned consecutively, not concurrently.
---
I have noticed this also but I don‚Äôt seem to run out of lootable water or food.  Fusion cores seem to burn out so fast that half my time feels like I‚Äôm doing loot runs just for those.  Same as everyone it seems because they are hard to get sometimes.  Had to actually buy some last night
---
Fully close the launcher and restart the application.

Ride it out. Maybe it goes forever.

Most players have been hopping all over he map hunting scorched since the update, and most scorched are found in irradiated areas, so consider these things, and you will realize nothing has changed;

First, I wish the camp limit was bigger, then I wish for everything else I can pug into it without hacking the game.  LOL..

I Thought there would be a TF2 Reference in the comments i guess not

isn't the Laser Gun Medium Scope also an exceedingly rare plan that they added to the holiday gift pool? I'd bank that one too if you aren't keen on learning it yourself.

Honnestly this looks surprisingly... good

Athletics is hard because it lags so much.

Oh, right. Another game is also bad. Yeah, then it's fine.

Come on, man.

That's sad.

It still triggers this way in my experience.

Have you received any rewards for completing all of them?

Are you able to build the squirrel banner at your camp?
---
Did you get a squirrel hat and uniform?
---
Maybe. I just dont want to be charged again @ $13. The subscription is not on auto renewal and there were no more atoms dropped into my account, so I think I'm ok.
---
Fireproof under Endurance is one of the best cards out there imo. Almost completely negates scorchbeast sonic attacks and if you ever have an explosive weapon you wont kill yourself with it. Also Radicool gives more value than most any other card in the game but its not for a tanky build. Rejuvenated gives you more hp and pairs pretty well with Dodgy.
---
Ash Heap is one of my favorite locals in any Fallout game, I just love how it feels like an alien planet. Toxic Valley is a close second. And I hate how both of these cool areas seem kind of like afterthoughts in the game. I haven't even finished the main quest yet but I feel like I'm spending entirely too much time in Cranberry bog, which I don't hate but it does certainly feel unequal. I hope Wastelanders fixes this.
---
That's my thought. Which is why I didn't contact them just yet.
---
That's good for everyone except you I guess.
---
wow thats some dedication
---
Understandable. As long as the subscription doesn't show active, I think you're ok. Enjoy the "free" benefits!
---
Are you sure you were awake, must be minimum lvl 20 to have a combat rifle.
---
Yeah...I'm kinda blown away that they dropped the ball on this.
---
Did we just solve your issue?
---
I am pretty sure all my best gift scores came from the small gifts too, numerous prime reciever plans, plasma grenade, dense combat torso
---
What's the connection like with them?
---
My Bloody Explosive Gatling Plasma is even more of a monster now.
---
I already had the plans as "known" and got the plans in my second large gift after the event started....I sold that one for 20K caps....I am level 407
---
Not really efficient honestly, but I've used them as an easy way to throw caps at alts I dont play
---
For my main I usually farm west tek a few times easier to just sell all the crap the muts drop plus I get extra caps for downing them anyway and if I'm lucky a decent legendary drop
---
And here I am with my plasma 'nade plan after I think my fourth small gift... I had no idea it was that hard to get. Thanks for confirming the low-level theory though, I'm going to shoot for a few more plans for my buddies!
---
I saw somebody with 5 in their vendor yesterday!!? I really want the icicle lights though.. I dont not want the santa crash.. but the lights are way cooler..
---
After opening 30 some large gifts I got it on my first small one lol
---
Tl;dr Plasma Grenade Plans drop from Christmas Gifts
---
It's a thing, I started it this morning.
---
This would actually ruin the game for many people.  PC has too many issues with hackers and cheaters.
---
She has a flat 70% damage reduction plus 300 DR and ER and around 32k health, good luck calculating your damage.
---
Is using 3 Stimpak Diffusers still a requirement for the Medic badge (or whatever badge it was)? If so, what the hell is a Stimpak Diffuser and where do I get one?
---
This is a rare item? I got it randomly when I was doing some events early game and have been wearing it ever since.
---
Got mine at 100 in vendor üòÅ
---
...wait...did it just *say* something?
---
I stopped trying awhile back maybe they messed up in one of the patches and re introduced that method. Will have to try it again I guess.
---
Just ran a connection test and its 42.2 down / 5.0 up
---
And that's a wired connection
---
A Metric Shit Ton, I'm sure, I've already dropped around 130K, I hit the WS Station Vendor &amp; the Faction vendors in the Resort market area every time I log in for 7 of each.
---
I heard a lot of people talking about how they immediately got the plans when the event first started... and was so damn jealous.  I just kept getting duplicate mounted brahman and ultracite laser plans
---
Even better!
---
At least we have backpacks in 76. Without mods none of the other Fallouts have them at all.
---
Considering they're basically the first piece of gear any post-apoc survivor would need I've never understood the oversight.
---
Backpacks were always some of the first mods I sought out.
---
They really need to start adding video clips of these things in the Atom shop.
---
so the chameleon mutation is must for the stealth build...!  
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I actually don't like using it, and only use it if the person I'm fighting uses it, or is popping stealth boys. My go to was the explosive laser but I'm finding now with proper perks and dense mods at a distance the thing is actually no longer much of a threat in PvP. It knocks you around a little bit which is annoying. I've been liking my handmade for pvp again. If you get caught in VATs it's over.
---
Yeah they spawn at the cabin highest up the hill, they never make it down to me.
---
Yeah, I have two characters just missing the 'power on power plant' and 'Cook with a chef hat on' left after getting two Plasma Grenade plans from the Christmas event so far.
---
When I originally attempted them it just wouldn't work.
---
My original 'main' finished the badges quite a while ago :)
---
The current event has also broken my unhealthy pattern of create new char &gt; complete Signal Strength as quick as possible &gt; delete char &gt; rinse, repeat.
---
I have gotten thee Raider Armour plans so far from gifts.
---
Is hard to find praise when it was the devs that burdened us with this absurd level of scarcity to start with but hey, I will take the relief.
---
I said ‚Äúpainlessly,‚Äù lol.
---
Now wait for the third rank (as the flags promised).
---
Please don't paint all PC players in a negative light. I do not cheat, nor do I use the keyboard; I use an Xbox controller.
---
Crossplay with my partner who's on Xbox? Hell, yes!
---
Very nice!
---
I can confirm that the powering on in is still bugged. I have powered up 3 different powerplants, all full repairs and done solo, with out it triggering. 3 different days, 3 different servers, all within the past week. I'm on ps4
---
yep, and he was smashing the Scorched inside the tunnel...
---
Or like a body pillow with him printed on it.
---
Great job! lvl 510 is a big achievement!
---
If you have some time, I recommend reading the linked article. Good read and fascinating stuff. I hope they crack down on people who do this.
---
There are too many apologists in the world. Starts to look like a corporation controlled sci-fi future.
---
THIS IS THE WAY.
---
Thank you so much, I never thought to use a low level alt!
---
Much appreciated buddy, though i am from the other side of the tracks (PS4), but I bit the bullet and started clearing the mutations. Now im only healing factor, speed demon and marsupial :/
---
Does anyone know if plague walker can allow PvP to i initiate? It is just an aura, so in theory even of someone punches me, if i dont fight back i should be safe, right? Ita not like unstable isotope that causes explosion, just a dangerous aura to hostiles. Can anyone confirm if this is a safe one or will it screw me over as well?
---
I would think that exploits are bad for shared world performance at a minimum. This should be justification alone for better BGS oversight. Meanwhile... Just think of the Atom Shop monetization opportunities this gun running crew have demonstrated for BGS. Talk about a proof of concept. :P
---
Some days it crashes a lot, most days it doesn't crash.
---
Never said it was absolutely necessary, but that it made it more accessible for more players, and made runs end more consistently in a victory so people can farm the drops!
---
The only thing is that there really isn't a "Tesla" build. It's a commando build, so I get a bit bothered when PvPers pull them out in the wrong situations, because that's why everyone groans at them. If you're 1v1, nobody is in stealth and you pull out a Tesla, I'm laughing AT you. Like, alright, you win, I guess? But honestly, most PvP players are aware of the whole "time and place" thing. I'm not touching my Tesla until you're stealth, because chances are you're about to your own out or if I'm outnumbered. And I'm not going to do it when I'm aware it would be overkill. (I had a level 15 and their similarly leveled friends claim the workshop I was in, I had a moment of "I should really just walk away" but then decided "nah, this is fallout 76, chances are they have a ton of junk and I'm going to be one of the few willing to let them keep it." (any time this happens, I'll saunter over to their bags, drop some additional things and message them something like "please stash everything as often as possible if you even consider owning a workshop. Most aren't going to give anything back" unless they shoot off a nasty message before they can get it. Then I'm just like well, thanks for the junk I guess?)
---
I have a regular ps4 and a ps4 pro, and the pro undoubtedly blue screens more frequently.
---
Great, I have the Santatron on 6 characters, 2 are almost always on for 5-6 hours a day, 12+ on the weekend, and I have not yet received a single gift, just lots of Coal &amp; Fertilizer mostly, I don't blame my Turrets for attacking him.
---
Main character is lvl 190 and I still have not launched a nuke. Get all ready find a card then get distracted by a legendary or building my base. Someday I'm going to do it and nuke a complete odd spot on the map.
---
Because you will get your ass handed to you at places like WS club and the radiation they give off....Also, Health or HP (hit points)...If you do not understand these then you do not know the game and a bloodied build....At 20% if I have 450 HP that means that I can take a HIT from a creature of up to 90 (20% of 450)...If your build has 340 then you can only withstand a hit of 68....  That is a huge difference if you look at the creatures and what their DMG output is....  You are going to get hit with a melee build (inside Westec's locked room).....I am tired of hearing the diminishing returns, I disagree with that statement.  My guy is much, much more resilient and armor lasts longer the higher my DMG resist.....Have a nice day!!
---
Ditch all the crafting perks because you can always switch to those when you use them.
---
White knight and Adamantal Skeleton are not related to PA.
---
PA breaks slowly so you don't need Power Patcher on always.
---
Traveller perk in Cha is not needed as you will be swimming in caps.
---
Good with salt is also not needed because of the abundance of food.
---
Scrounger is debatable but fusion cells are not hard to find or craft, and you can always buy a lot from players because these tend to not sell well.
---
&gt; you can convert near empty cores into fresh ones
---
Seems like it was always my turrets getting destroyed and they are a lot more pricy to fix than most other things.
---
perks that could increase damage of rifles:
---
* tormentor (luck)
---
* bloody mess (luck)
---
* better criticals (luck)
---
* grim reapers sprint (luck)
---
* tank killer (perception)
---
* concentrated fire (perception)
---
* tenderizer (charisma)
---
* Covert operative (agility)
---
* Nerd rage (intelligence)
---
* Demolition expert (intelligence, need an explosive weapon of course)
---
* Adrenaline (agility)
---
* and probably some others I forget...
---
If you‚Äôre ever taking stuff from your stash in quick succession there is a chance with every click it will bug and remove display items. I cleared my stash to farm this event and ended up having to replace half my magazines, bobble heads, and fasnacht masks. Been around since they released displays, hopefully they fix it eventually.
---
Makes perfect sense to keep everyone in a similar playing field.  If a level 200 attacks a level 15 that level 15 should at least have the potential to win.  Most times they do not win but they shouldn't have the deck stacked so far against them they cant.
---
Well it's not your connection then.
---
I know this game has issues with reconciling people's different connection speeds. I've tested it with a friend of mine that runs DSL. Because the game is constantly trying to sync everyone in an area, if one of those people has a slower connection it will cause everyone else to stutter and lag. Literally as soon as he left the area my connection would improve. I have 300 down/150 up, AT&amp;T Uverse.
---
Some problems can be written off by the connection, but it would seem that you're having a different issue. Are there any other issues going on?
---
Happening on PC too.
---
Exactly. You can choose to spend 26 dollars on Atoms for the Freestates bundle or 26 dollars on the god roll weapon.
---
One of us. One of us.
---
I love the design, very groovy indeed. Now I gotta redesign my pad.
---
Hahaha! Funniest looking character I've seen to date.
---
Keep that shit to PC. Us console dweebs don't need PC guys bullshit. Wipe the PC players.. leave consoles alone.
---
As long as I‚Äôm crouching it says hidden, caution, or danger. It‚Äôs kinda hard to see the hidden one imo it tends to blend but caution and danger is read always noticeable to me.
---
But there is no skill to it you just fire tesla into the ground and jump like idiot. Rest is just grind for gear.
---
Got it in my first small holiday gift, felt like a blessing from Atom!
---
Fuck I couldn't agree with you more.
---
I once snuck up on another player in the wendigo cave, "what's going on in here?" I asked innocently over area chat while their character did an obvious real world jumpy double take of my sudden appearance.
---
Then I murdered some crabs.
---
*red not read. Lol
---
Food buffs+liquor buffs+stims+bobble head+probably instigating.  You can stack stats sky high in this game even at level 7.
---
Don't underestimate people, if they are trying to goad you into pvp they are probably way more prepared than you.
---
The pain still comes, just in the form of only profiting 800 caps instead of 1400 caps
---
Carrying around a bunch of mutation serums when you can move cards from grenadier (using grenades as a sneak build?) is just dumb when you can just take the Starched Genes card...I have never seen one person ever not have Starched Genes with mutations...Sorry pal, I am on my 5th different build, my 4th different bloodied at level 407...I switch them out to try different weapons and so on that I get or buy.... He has many flaws with his build
---
BGS can't sell weapons/armor without everyone shitting themselves, crying P2W, and quitting the game for good... some people will gladly fill that void. I don't blame them, some stuff I seen is more reasonably priced than atomic shop garbage and well worth buying to bypass grind.
---
You can legit charge people for guide services on this quest line.
---
I hate it but I ultimately want to mod my backpack (for the skins i wasted a lot of atomic points on). everyone i have come across has said how tedious and frustrating the tadpole quests are.  hell, i only have the archery one done and im still traumatized
---
Same! I run with thru hiker on 3 and carry about 200+ purified waters on me. Been drinking water like crazy! You‚Äôd think he would have to take a leak every 10 min.
---
On all my characters I always did archers, athlete and swimming quickly for the badge. They were all quick to do and complete.
---
Did the arc come on?  Stand in the arc until you are almost dead and then jump off...Unless they patched it it should still work....Who cares about dying?  Just do not have anything on you....
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs not smart. Each challenge only appears if you complete the previous one, so if you get say, 250 XP per round, your first round would only count for the wreath, therefore wasting 249 XP, compared to playing one match on the first day and coming back the next. I probably didn‚Äôt explain it that well, but whatever.
---
I would love to see raids that aren't bound to a vault. 
---
I want an Enclave raid where we storm the Whitespring and bunker, and have to destroy/disable/take control of MODUS.
---
I want a raid where the remnants of the automated US Army see us as a threat for storming the silos and launching nukes, so they hunt us down.
---
I would also like to see a raid near Harper's Ferry where the ghouls that were chased off have gathered together and come back for revenge.
---
Just a couple idea.
---
i never seem to get badges from that one /:
---
It's not fair
---
Grats! Now go forth and lay the righteous smacketh down in the wasteland with no future hesitation!
---
Id probably say it's one of the worst performances of any game on my pro. I get a lot of stutter and frame rate drops as well as frequent blue screens. The most annoying issue is switching weapons in a tricky situation has this weird stutter and lag before you can fire. I just don't think it's very well optimised but it's passable if you can look past the issues like I do. Resolution wise If you have a 4k screen it renders at 1440p but I find the game to be sore on the eyes even at that resolution.
---
Still bugged unfortunately, I made a second character and found abandoned bog town still didn't count for the cranberry bog challenge. Did it a few days ago too.
---
Lmao that's awesome
---
Agreed
---
Trolls like to lure robots to your camp then they get your turret to shoot them so your camp becomes a threat. I used to camp there but it happened far too often on ps4 about 6 months ago.
---
Ah, I didn't play from right before that until this Christmas event started.
---
I thought this would be useful at first, but the title is somewhat misleading. The chess pieces are pretty common knowledge, but the actual model robots are harder to come across. Was hoping for an easy video on where to grab those.
---
Thanks for the feedback I'm sure I'll be able to look past the issues as it's a fun game for me personally and I hope they can keep improving so it doesnt have these issues anymore or atleast less frequently
---
It‚Äôs a new reward unlocked each day, and we have about 3 weeks to complete.
---
I strongly beg to differ.
---
The only reason I put my camp there is cause it was pretty :(
---
When's the next atom bundle going to come out..? They released they paint sized slasher one a while ago now.. in so glad I got the santa outfit though. I love how the beard looks with the short jackolantern suit ski hat &amp; 3d glasses!
---
Daaamn I got both of them legit the first 2/3 weeks the game came out got one from finishing the brother hood story and got the other from a mission/daily
---
There's no rush, I didn't drop my first nuke until around level 350.
---
There's much less of that going in than ever these days. A lot of people dip when teslas come out so people aren't using them like they used to.
---
Isn't it just like Fallout 4, where the brackets around [caution] indicate how close they are to finding you? ie the closer the brackets are to the text, the closer the enemies are to finding you
---
I can understand wanting the plans, but if you'd settle for buying a set of shielded raider underarmor, I have a pal that can make em. PC
---
Definitely worth testing. Same with being overencumbered - worth testing to see if that could effect things.
---
He makes things
---
No problem! I'm sure they will improve stability and performance eventually. Just a shame that having the pro doesn't benefit the experience that much as it stands üëä
---
serves you right for trying to make a disneyland on the post-apocalypse.
---
Let me just start by thanking you for taking the time to help me.
---
I'm not really having any other issues. I have 2200 fallout hrs with probably 2100 of them being on the gen 1. The mrs plays simultaneously on a tv next to me and I have more issues than her (shes gen 1). We are both wired using a switch. 
---
I will admit my router could use an upgrade as it's a bit old but current firmware. But like I said gen 1's have no issue, nor my sons xbone
---
Oh damn I didn‚Äôt even think of wearing beard without the suit. That‚Äôs awesome.
---
Nope, I was having the same problem today. Fast travel seems to fix it. If you don't see it you're out of sneak squatting or not. Flaky is the perfect word to describe sneak at the moment since the last patch.
---
The defense hit isn't that bad, and it's just Rad resist if I remember right. The value can't be negative, so 0-60=0
---
Those were 3 of the easy ones and I believe the swimming one is fairly easy too, but that requires reviving someone in the water.  Some of the other tadpole badges are super grindy though so just stick with the easy ones as you only need 3.  I was surprised it was that easy to get based on some of the complaining I had seen about getting it, but I can see how it would be a pain if you chose to do some of the crappier badges. 
---
If you have access to a private server use it for the athletics courses, they can be very laggy.  I did them with lag and had to redo most of them due to checkpoints not registering.  They are pretty short though so if you do have to redo them you are only wasting about 2 minutes.
---
This is genius!
---
The AMS headquarters in Watoga. There are a couple of them in there.
---
I'm noticing that the [Hidden] indicator will randomly disappear.
---
I have the speed demon mutation, and it doesn't seem any different to me
---
FO76 is such a beautiful game!
---
I agree, open 96, open 96.
---
*grabs pitch fork and tour torch
---
Stings N Things &amp; Operation Tidy are repeatable quests you can start on your own and they can drop possum badges
---
For "defend workshop" mission, I've read about another tactics:
---
1) If there's no timer then it's another player. Don't go there, let them have it (and then optionally claim/attack when the moment is right for you, not for them).
---
2) If there is a timer it means that is an NPC attack but if you arrive there while the event is on you might be attacked by other players as they can see the event on the map. So don't go there to defend, wait until it fails and the quest "Retake workshop" starts. It will not be shown on map for other players and you get the same reward for retaking as you would get for defending while being relatively safe.
---
The majority are. I did run into a few total dbags but thankfully that's rare.
---
I never really considered carrying multiples and swapping them out.  Thanks for the info, guess I will be spending some badges now!
---
Its funny, before this event I had never seen a legendary scorched. Now, I see regular and Christmas ones
---
They can be done. Most don't have the patience to try one,two or three times,but they totally can be done.
---
I just bought a guy out of alot last night that was selling them for 100, gotta have some way to build my caps back up since people aren't even buying legendaries rn
---
Ya no worries.
---
At this point I don't really have an answer for what is going on. There's no reason that the upgraded system should be having more issues. Odd. Was it new or used when you got it?
---
I‚Äôm still temp banned from feb 18 because I bought the game and after I exited the vault there was a paper bag with a lot of stuff so I picked it all up and got flagged and banned
---
Because it hates you like everyone else
---
Here's a guide that a friend and I put together: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ea64ac/complete\_guide\_to\_the\_holiday\_event\_with\_drop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ea64ac/complete_guide_to_the_holiday_event_with_drop/)
---
The 200 times thing doesnt mean what is says..its 200 seconds..idk why they worded it that way..look it up..it on youtube...i also was scared at first for that one
---
Is the plasma mine rare? I got 2 back to back from presents and I saw someone on the Xbox "looking for group" area trying to sell it for 20k but it can't be THAT rare
---
I need a couple of healing serum on Xbox if anyone has them. GT MagnumForce357.
---
It reminds me of those enormous trees they put up in malls! Well done! Mine's just out front because I couldn't fit that thing sideways in my living room letalone upright. üòÇ
---
Bruh archery was fun...the crossbow needs mods..i love that thing
---
I had this issue yesterday. 
---
Completed the scorched earth event got the achievement but no rewards or xp
---
you finally purified your water
---
The robot models can be found at rondo research center. So far I‚Äôve found 5 different ones, sometimes in a single run.
---
I‚Äôm going to do another video with the proper models but just wanted to get the chess ones up first
---
A lot of the events have stopped the completion animation that shows rewards, however, you still get the reward. Just check your inventory
---
The arc was on when I approached it, the generator in the monorail car is on, the arc does super minimal damage, gives no radiation.
---
theres nothing to figure out, the skill cap for pvp is low, dont kid yourself into thinking your build is special.
---
I got it 2 hours after completing it
---
Its not like people are hacking so I don't see it as cheating unless the weapon its self without any perks is like above 1k damage.   Then its cheating but if people feel like getting things early then they are paying a price for it still not cheating unless they have like infinite health and stuff.
---
I also buy cheap higher-level legendaries from vending machines for scrip.
---
Can't you pc guys just just make anything you want?  Explosive plasma rifle and so on
---
Because people buy them to resell at vendors is why I don‚Äôt sell mine cheap.
---
Ooooooh, well that changes a lot. Still hate the event. Don't think I've ever completed it even with my lvl 98.
---
Yes. This. :-(
---
I find load times faster and lag better on my pro, but it definitely blue screens more frequently.
---
This was such a fun video - love the idea of a tour of all the random unique items in a location.
---

Usually like 4 hours.
---
3 hours usually, rarely less.
---
Thanks okay
---
You son of a B, I'm in!
---
It will last the same length as all the other maintenances. Until they are done. Usually around 1 to 24 hours, somewhere in between.
---
they never say how long it takes, usually hotfixes last about an hour or so and planned maintenance can take anywere from 2-4 hours in my experience
---
not sure if this maintenance was planned or not though
---
They never say how long it‚Äôs going to take, it‚Äôs done when it‚Äôs done. Typically goes on for roughly 2 hours but it‚Äôs been longer too.
---
Did you look at yourself in the mirror again? We did warn you.
---
Hahahaha ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Same here. I must hunt and kill them all now!
---
I keep getting stuck on the quest where you have to clean the Kiddie corner cabins.......
---
Imma let you finish, but MIRV grenades are the best grenades of all time.
---
I'm not sure if this gets a mark in the "win" or the "no life" column, for it takes true dedication of both mental capacity and time to achieve this üòâ
---
Seriously though, congratulations... I'm trying my best, but a lot of these I really don't see me doing... Ever üòè
---
The Purveyor dropped a BE15R Fixer for me the other week and that particular version was duped on PC.
---
What a kick in the nuts. 2,000+ hours in the game since BETA and I finally get a God drop and it's a fucking dupe..... they're literally all over the place and I saw one selling for $4.50 on eBay the other day.
---
I honestly don't know why I'm playing this game anymore. Finding rare items was really the only thing this game had going for it......but nothing is rare.....there is no such thing as a unique build/load out.
---
Why does it matter to you what they do with it after they buy it?
---
If you‚Äôre maxing our your own 1400 vendor caps daily, anything you sell in your machines is profit. 
---
If they want to take a dent in their own daily income for the sake of speed &amp; convenience, let them. 
---
What do you list yours for?
---
hahaha I've gotten into the "I wish someone would nuke...." because I hate running through the silos and I need flux and I am lazy.
---
Brand new. Might have to try other games to verify. A new router wouldn't hurt either. But either way I'm sticking with fo76
---
It sucks, just refreshed the daily challenges and then the ticking starts!
---
Don‚Äôt worry purified water bottle 6 packs coming to atomic shop soon
---
I‚Äôll watch closer, I‚Äôll do another daily when servers come back up. It‚Äôs been a week or so since it‚Äôs shown the loot and xp after the event. May be my mistake
---
Hoping it's fast! Watching impeachment proceeding banging my head against the wall.
---
Before this event 20k would have been a really good cheap price for it.  Not sure what the market will be for it after the event.  Time will tell.
---
Ever done construction irl? I want to see you do 20/30m of work without water/food for energy...now imagin doing construction irl post nuclear apocalypse.
---
Same... I'm also on PS4...
---
Congrats! That's awesome! What did you spend all your tokens on?
---
I'm not gonna lie it took me a while to find too. I was scrolling left and right in every single table menu for what felt like forever.
---
and just think .. we've had events killing them by the millions. Beth gonna turn around and say they are the good guys. LOL. The SHAME !
---
I got one when the event started, not realizing its rarity I ate it right away lol
---
That is daft if that's the case, the survival tent is all about portability, it should have been a free Christmas skin in that case.
---
Really, this is taking *milking the player base* a step too far.
---
Doesn't matter, it would force Bethesdas hand to fix it
---
Yeah that's weird, check and make sure that there's not a system update or something I guess. I can't really think of any reason why it would perform worse on APS pro. Good luck I hope you solve your problem
---
When the brackets move away from the word hidden it means your status is about to go to caution. It does the same thing going from caution to detected.
---
With the right perks, chems, weapons you can get non negligible dmg ranges. My stealth commando usually gets 300-600 per shot with handmade so... that's nice. 
---
Properly perked melee with dcg/mmg/PF should be getting 1-5k per hit depending on perks. Up to 10-15k per hit with fully perked meat hook. Even if I put on zealots gear i can still get 5k per hit with a bss meathook as long as stealth holds and I prep with food and some chems. 
---
I normally use melee now to save ammo but I definitely would say stealth commando dmg can be non-jokey.
---
I used to know a guy. He duped some stuff, not an obscene amount of items. When the items were removed he got to keep 2 of each item...
---
He never got banned.
---
Here are some people talking about this kind of stuff... You can see the date and the funny thing is that particular discord server is against external apps. The newest cheating method uses some external thingy...
---

---
Maybe you're just unaware of how widespread exploiting, duping and spawning in items actually is? 
---
Look buddy, i get it, you're enjoying the game and that's great. You're not wrong for enjoying it and i'm not wrong for not enjoying it either. We're different people, we have different needs.
---
I generally never fault people for using what's available to win. The game is unbalanced. That's not on them. Teslas aren't to my preference, but that's okay. I use things that others don't like.
---
For instance, I don't have a problem with Stealth Boy use and use them liberally as it's the only real counter to VATS. When opponents can use LVC and other mods to enable aimbot nearly constantly, there's not much of another option. It's often get tapped once then immediate death by VATS. I think SB usage is important to combat this.
---
I think a lot of people view teslas as the counter to SB use, but I think that's missing the mark. Teslas are basically always the best option, so naturally it'll get the job done. It tends to work like this: try to VATS opponent, opponent pops SB, switch to tesla. The Commando player nearly never aims in this scenario. I don't blame them for doing what works, though. It's just not my preference which is fine.
---
Personally, I'd see teslas nerfed and VATS removed from PvP. That's my ideal meta. Along with some tweaks to the damage cap. For now, I just play and don't sweat it.
---
Why bother shutting the game down? hot fix's and patch's don't fix much and usually create new bugs.
---
Hmm...Good point.  I never really paid attention to the timer (or lack thereof.)
---
Same thing happened to me on the first day of the event! Then a Santa Scorch knocked his ass out. Felt kinda bad for him but I wanted that gift.
---
Why is it so small. It‚Äôs more like a footstool than a table.
---
I've had this since patch 16. I still get the rewards they just don't pop up on screen
---
Ah, I thought only the grenade was the rare one. Guess il keep it on me for when this is over
---
Yea not like in PvE where you can legit go into any of the area of the map basically unspecced for your weapon in a suit of excavator power armor and wrap up literally any enemy at all besides the 2 bosses in the game with 100 of every bulk junk and 85 glowing meat steaks in your bag...       
---
If you wanna think real hard about it its 100x easier to survive in pve than pvp, no matter the scenario at all.
---
Lol Yea like I have speed demon mutation on but I had it on for like..  Idk a very long time till recent updates ago it got worse.   I always have about 70 to 100 waters on me so I just deal with it
---
Good thing I bought that new rustic water fountain before it went away. That thing replenish 2/3x more then purified water.. Only have to hit it 2/3 times without any perk cards to be full.. Best purchase ever especially since this thirst thing going around.. But it's mostly due to fast traveling and using radaway from hunting scorch near fissure sites and glass cavern radaway drains your water SUPER fast
---
yea.  I took over the workshop there....and still didn't get credit for discovering the place...
---
You're not the only one here xD few effigies around my camp and the creepiest rise to the first floor of my camp and even an offering bowl
---
You'd probably pull the tesla on me then. I use SBs pretty often. VATS is a nasty animal. Like I said, though, I'm not bothered by folks using teslas. It's just not interesting to me which is just a preference.
---
by using only those ones in crafting. example you have 50 full ones, and 10 near dead ones. drop the fresh ones so they are not used and use the dead ones for crafting.
---
For Prime UGL, you need 2 cores to make the Ultracite cores, the base FC's can be any charge.
---
With Ammosmith, instead of 2 for 2, it's 2 for 3
---
Uggh welp gotta love fantastic game developing.
---
I was doing that for awhile. Either cheap high level, or cheap low level. Same script, it's always nice to find those people's vending machines where everything is pretty cheap, it's like Christmas for my caps(usually)
---
anything is possible when you are chugging quantums. tesla pvp is noskill and you know it.
---
I like the tree, but I'm severely disappointed that I cannot hang any lights on it.
---
I've discovered Abandoned Bog town with all 5 characters &amp; still haven't got the completion. So though not effecting everyone its still bugged for many it seems.
---
I got a guy around this time last year, right after finding and donning the faschnat man mask. I had to pee, so I found a nice dark corner to hunch down in while I went and did my business, came back to find another player looting the room I was chilling in. He was too focused on his scavenging and didn't notice me, so I crept up right behind him and stood up, and just waited for him to turn around. All I hear over area chat was a high pitched "the fuck??" followed by the telltale laughter of someone that wasn't prepared to have a jump scare after realizing there's no actual danger. It was great
---
I bought the present loot bag just to do this..got my festive suit on and doing the present emote...just need the presents bag
---
Just an FYI, if you leave a private server and join a public one, it still seems to keep your private server for the allotted 5 minutes. Tested this by building structures in a workshop, leaving to public, then back to private and I joined the original server I was on
---
I like going to low level camps to see if they find anything of interest I've gotten some nice stuff out of the vending machines
---
Quite correct. 
---
18 Ultracite for each crafting.
---
Praise be! May his great wings shroud us from danger! Praise be!
---
i went to cancel auto-renew after the 1st week, that's when i noticed that i had actually been charged twice. because of course. sony refunded me for the error... and i actually got months two atoms. but definitely was not charged again and still have access.
---
well the maintenance falls into european prime time 95% of the time and my usual days to get online are...
---
you guessed it tuesdays and thursdays so im fucked üòÇ
---
gotten better though but i can remember that over the summertime there was a period of like 6 weeks or so were it seemed as every time i would have had time to play i couldnt because of updates üòÖ
---
It's not hard. You should give it another look. Takes a couple hours maybe. Easy enough to hop servers for a queen drop and revive someone there if you don't want to post on here for someone to revive. So far I have always just did the rest of the items and usually find someone to revive along the way. I think I have done it on.... maybe 5 characters across two accounts? It's a bit tedious but well worth it. 
---
Grinding badges for the mods is arguable for sure but 60 extra carry weight for free is tough to pass up. Lots of guides out there on how to do it pretty quickly.
---
Havent noticed it
---
Thanks Angry Turtle! 
---
You have some great videos on your channel.
---
I have a stealth commando that is modeled around your YT build.
---
No it's faster or the same if you know how to do it
---
He used to trade with the settlers there
---
&gt;  Cosmetics should be behind an effort barrier. But if they're not going to be, since 76 has a cash shop
---
76 *doesn't* have a cash shop.  It has an atom shop.  You *can* buy atoms, or you can get them through "effort".
---
Not all PC players are cheaters.
---
If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that they weren‚Äôt already attempting to bash my brains in with a sledgehammer or axe, I probably would‚Äôve.
---
about this long:
---
(&lt;------------------------------------&gt;)    üòÇü§£
---
Maybe do it like sea of theives. Where console players have the option to disable crossplay.
---
I‚Äôve thought the same thing with this games quirks. Makes you question your own sanity sometimes. Worst part is if none of my teammates notice or have these issues I jump to I guess I‚Äôm just high AF.
---
For 1 it replenishs 2/3x more thirst then purified water..it also heals I can go from red to full is 3 sips without any perk cards.. And if you know how to do it right you can collect water as fast or faster then any water source on the land
---
I run speed demon with the card to reduce the negatives and the past couple days I noticed that I was losing food and water way faster than I normally do
---
The best DR, not factoring in radiation, is a Heavy Combat BOS Torso and Studded Heavy Leather arms and legs
---
I thought it was gonna be a small pokey tree to go at the side of a room. I didn't think it was going to be that high O.o
---
Good thinking, SB. I have that link bookmarked for easy (and frequent) access. 
---
And for our amigos on Xbox, this is another useful bookmark (I'm sure there's a similar one for Playstation):  [https://beta.support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status](https://beta.support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status)
---
Sorry I wasn't trying to say everyone was. I should of said is it possible that it could be programmed in? My apologies and happy holidays
---
BoS Combat Torso gets you 81/81
---
Scout Polymer Limbs are 45/30 (I think)
---
If you want ER (Why?) then Leather all the way, 
---
Highest DR and damn the negatives? Metal
---
Please no. Duper‚Äôs are enough on console. Please don‚Äôt open the hellgates to the cheaters too.
---
Same but I am on PC :(
---
What!?!? Haven't seen one yet
---
As others have said, you (Almost certainly) got the rewards, just not "Listed"
---
You are wrong and must not know the trick..i can collect water as fast or faster on my fountain and when I drink from it it restores 3x more thirst then purified water and heals
---
[It's not just you. Since this patch it's been far worse. ](https://i.imgur.com/0jUywKX.jpg)
---
I only blue screen occasionally on my pro. I experience more lag issues than anything else. I have 1 Gbps internet, but PS4 speed tests at 54 Mbps on Wi-Fi üòï
---
all this talk about being a certain level when opening gifts is hooey. i‚Äôve been getting ALL the plans while level 395-404.
---
it‚Äôs just rng.
---
Moments like these are pretty cool.
---
You complete the quest if a nuke is launched.
---
What's getting broken now?
---
That's not how this works, you cant mod items into the game
---
Maybe one day we'll get a dummy to display clothes...
---
100% agree. My pro blue screens waaaay more than my slim
---
There are so many ways to deal with a tesla rifle user. Just get super high energy resist with the right build. My buddy's anti armor tesla rifle does about 25 each hit...And hes maxed rifle build when he looks at tesla rifles he says for him they deal just slightly over 100 damage each hit. My character under the right circumstances can have almost 500hp. He needs multiple clips to kill me and if I stim up I can easily down him with my handmade.
---
I got everything and it was a good/bad choice lol !! However Christmas is my favorite time so I want to share the love ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
If you drink then spam the collect you can collect as fast or faster then a pond/river... How do people not know these tricks that have been here for a year...
---
I got the grenade plan early in the event and the mine plan last night. SO RELIEVED not to have to do BB and Breach at every opportunity. They are still good events, just being able to do them when I feel like it rather than grinding them is sweet relief. And great idea about the low level profile!
---
Hey remember when you had to take a training course before you could get in power armor.
---
&gt;A lot of the plans on the rewards list are level locked, meaning you have to be a certain level to get them. So we can actually remove these plans from the pool by creating a new alt account and making sure that it stays at level four or below once leaving the account.
---
I'll be damn. Why didn't I think of that? Oh that's right I'm an idiot that's why. 
---
Thanks for this tip!
---
I got them all too. I must have gotten 30+ badges since the Ever upwards quests came out.  
---
Now we need a new rank. I really enjoyed the challenges minus 3 things.....plasma grenade, robot armor crafting,  and the royal jelly.
---
A big thanks to you and your friend for putting that list together! 
---
It's very helpful.
---
I never mentioned teslas I don't think. Its definitely the least skillful of all, but if you. Kth have them doing more damage and surviving longer is a type or skill. It's a rather lame way to play though.
---
I know two players on XBL, one sells routinely for 111C, and the other sells at 90C, (obviously I had to make these two my friends asap lol), ..when I'm too lazy to make my own I'm always visiting their shops.
---
You are wrong drink then spam collect its as fast or faster.. This trick has been around for a year now... And when you drink it replenishs 2/3x more then purified water and heals you
---
I love my tesla for 1 very specific reason. Stealth boy users.  I'm not complaining, It's just simply my Achilles heel and that's ok since I'm not perfect but I am particularly weak against stealth boy users and that's just a fact.
---
I did not. Thank you
---
Obviously Idk how it works but, I've seen weapons that never ever existed created on PC and it can only be done on PC, correct?
---
Should talk trash about stuff you don't own or know nothing about it..
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to be either. It‚Äôs just what will probably happen
---
I think we should be able to pick up our tents after we are done using it so it isn‚Äôt in the way for anyone. I only use my tent for things that I know I need to fast travel from place to place and it will cost me too much to travel around.
---
I'm the same way. I don't consider myself a good aim and was a little worried about how I would do in Fallout76. I would suggest a VATS build or melee. One good thing about VATS is that when your VATS runs out you are still pointed at the enemy so just keep firing! Some things that might also help are 
---
SERENDIPITY - Luck card
---
BORN SURVIVOR - Agility card
---
When you hit 50 you can get Legendary armor with Auto Stim and Life Saving
---
Level 8 is hard as a newb with basic equipment too! What platform are you on maybe I can help?
---
Honestly more likely people getting into the dev area. It's not hacking per se. It's also not possible anymore i dont think. Most that abused it got banned as well
---
One small correction, you have a lower chance with the large gifts. Large presents are the only one you can get the rare taxedermy and holiday plans with. So if you open small or medium you eliminate those from the drop pool
---
Best is a relative term.  
---
I personally prefer Robot Armor for the better Rad Resist.  A lot comes down to what you expect to be fighting.  PVP-ers were all about leather for a while, because the meta was rapid fire lasers and teslas for a good term.  
---
There's also the aesthetics to consider.  Some people enjoy theming.  I know many BoS themed groups that will only allow Combat Armor.  I know may Raider roleplayers that only were Raider, Trapper, or Leather.
---
In the end, it's a toolbox where means adjust to the needs.
---
Yup annoying as shit when it does the acid attack too. Sucks when the entire tunnel becomes acid covered and scorch beast is protected by the damn walls and ceiling.
---
I noticed something different about this behavior last night.  I initially had my tent set up on the golf course so I have easy access to those vendors and easy access to my scrap box while doing my daily circuit of the grounds.  When I tried to change to the decorated version of the tent, I got a message about it conflicting with "an existing build space".  I then did some experiments, and I THINK that what was happening was that game knew that someone's primary camp was there in some incarnation of the world, so wouldn't let me place it.  I sort of convinced myself this was the case, anyway,  by walking all around the golf course with my tent all set to deploy &amp; I would periodically see the red/ green boundary circle you see when building a camp.  It was the inverse,  though - red when inside the bounds &amp; green when outside of it.  I could place my tent anywhere I pleased outside of those areas, but was actively blocked from interfering with an existing camp location (or so it seemed to me.)  I ended up tucking my tent up near the wall by one of the streams,  so I should be out of anyone's way from here on out.  
---
I hope.  
---
The last thing I want to do is inconvenience others. This is part of the reason I built my primary camp way up in the Mire. I have only had it conflict with someone else's camp once.
---
Does a true scout picklock 750 locks ....????!!!! No he doesn't........ You just lost all you're possum bagdes ..... You need to start allover again ....
---
We def need more content, but hopefully nothing like timer mechanics in current vault.
---
Cant tell how many times when learning or even now we fail steps after doing everything because of server lag? Even have probs with the firsr door or even the vault door not opening for a member.
---
The timer mechanic is very bad in this game, think about how many ppl complained about the obstacle course in Back to Basic quest. The timer is not to tight but if you do the course correctly and server does not recognize you hit a checkmark you have to go back for it and will prob fail. Tried it on an alt other day and realized right away to hop to a more stable server, unfortunately a new player may not and will become frustrated.
---
You forgot that it replenishs 2/3 more then purified water and heals... And the drink then collect trick works with it so no need to go to a river or pond because it collects faster lol
---
That's good news! Thanks on PS4 so only hear/say and a few pictures posted.  Appreciate the knowledge
---
The only good choice is to concentrate on rifles fully and skip wasting performance and time for backup melee weapons. You‚Äôll have to sacrifice rifles to make room for melee perks, or else the melee will underperform compared to ranged. If you do, ranged will underperform.
---
If you really really need a side weapon to decluster the situation, one level enforcer perk, explosive shotty, shoot at the feet. You‚Äôll break all legs and will get some space for clear repositioning.
---
yup, only the first item though, and then 1 every day the next 5? days
---
Or save time by opening gifts under a target level to avoid an inflated loot table of undesirable plans. EG: why open gifts on a level 200+ that likely has all the prime receiver plans when you could open them on a level 49 and exclude yourself by eliminating the level 50 requirement for prime receiver plans to drop from the loot table. That's 38 plans dropped from the loot table.
---
It can be tailored even further for targeting specific armor plans and weapon plans.
---
I guess it might be related to the recent hack, unless it was already announced that something else is being fixed.
---
Yes, this. Still get rewards but doesn‚Äôt show on screen.
---
I run a Full Heavy leather Armor Set with an ER of 829, so I can tank a few hits from a tesla with no problem, but the QFFR is just crazy OP'd in PvP, fortunately they are very range limited.
---
900. I get nearly 3000.
---
Started last night.
---
Yeah
---
Define basic. Walls and doors? Or accessories. Because I‚Äôm level 104 and I‚Äôm still constantly buying camp accessories. I‚Äôm looking for plans for the small table that has the granite top on it right now.
---
I'm not even using a fast or particularly good SSD. 
---
I found one thing that also helps is your OS / main Paging / cache file needs to be on an SSD too.
---
If everything is still on a HDD and your running F76 off a SSD - its gonna still bottleneck on the HDD where everything is being cached/paged - more or less stored off CPU/GPU.
---
Praying for no download. Their servers were slow last night so took forever to get the small patch..
---
I found turning HDR off on the Pro for playing FO76 seemed to help it crash less.... No clue why, and it may just be anecdotal.
---
Same :)
---
Are we certain we still get the rewards? What about the XP?
---
Yea I noticed my cores going out way too fast. I thought it was just me.
---
It was announced yesterday.
---
We know they intend to change the rate gifts drop at the Santatron.  I think the theory is that they're also going to address the blatant spawn-anything-you-want exploit.
---
Is this confirmed though ? I don't think it makes a difference after 50+ would suggest .. what if I wanted more chances of a the icicle lights or santa crash, lower level ?
---
I can accept bugs, but certain obvious things still not fixed a year later, idk .. however they keep over populating the Atomic shop
---
Santatron will (actually) give you gifts from now on. More frequent at least :)
---
What‚Äôs wrong with it? I haven‚Äôt unlocked it yet but I‚Äôm hoping to put it in my house. Is it really big or something?
---
I'm not overencumbered. I even have speed demon. But the markers lag so much.
---
I have that one but I want the good one.
---
As a console player, I'm all up for playing with the other console... But not PC. 
---
I got away from PC due to hacks and cheats being a problem, and I don't want to have to worry about anything imbalanced. I joined console because it was a lot more "worry free" in that regard, and I'd like to keep it that way :P
---
What? That‚Äôs kinda strange/ dumb
---
My setup does all I need without additional purchase, so I'm good.
---
Some of them have been sneaking. Some have been *sniping*.
---
They are evolving.
---
I guess we‚Äôll all be checking next time we play but it sound like we get both, I hadn‚Äôt seen any one ask the question. Hope this helps others that were of the same thought
---
I like you. You've obviously taken the time to understand different scenarios and can understand even when you don't agree. 
---
But I just can't pull out a Tesla 1v1 and NOT feel silly. Like, I've walked up and claimed a workshop, and notice in my favorites wheel as I equip my handmade that I only had 4 .556 left and I go back and forth on if I just need to accept defeat or if I pull out that Tesla and look/feel ridiculous. The answer usually depends on how badly I need that resource. 
---
Teslas being nerfed would honestly be the way to go, but the question would be "in which way?" like, I think if they did it in a way that would discourage them when they would be a ridiculous/unnecessary advantage would be the ideal way but that would require some super specific parameters. I would hate for Tesla/SB super smash to end because I'm late to this party and it's way too much fun to end. But I also have started to use my quad when I'm attempting mob control on pacifist, it's so satisfying to see that arc travel through 10+ glowing ones you've got parading around the tennis court in the Whitespring. 
---
I think we've all got ideas as to what should happen, but I'm just still thinking they should have never done survival mode, but instead PvP friendly servers and totally pacifist servers. Survival was too much of a free-for-all that would make me have to log out if I had to run to the bathroom, and removing additional aspects of PvP is going to disrupt a larger-than-most realize subset of the community. I know strictly PvE players that love the idea of workshops being PvP, not because they necessarily want to participate, but because they recognize that they're getting resources that they wouldn't be getting, there needs to be some sort of risk there. 
---
I'm off on a tangent now, but anything they do at this point, someone is going to find something to be mad about. So when I see posts like this and responses like yours, I'm relieved that not everybody has decided they're just going to complain about everything that pops into their mind.
---
Sweet.
---
Silly Redditor, every single build is *S.P.E.C.I.A.L.*
---
Yeah my internet download speed has been awful lately. I'm dreading today's call of duty update.
---
Hell yeah more workshops to contest
---
No, you're not.
---
It seems like it's along the same lines where I don't see the Scorchbeast Queen's health bar while I'm actively hitting the Queen.  The game kind of "forgets" to put it on the screen, or something.
---
As far as I know you can
---
It's not broken.  It's a feature.  
---
And yes...  the perks still stack.
---
but the thing is tho i didn't personally launch it, i wasn't anywhere near any silo when it popped up.
---
if its not a glitch the only thing i can assume is that it was because i was on the same team as the person who actually did launch it. a few weeks ago i participated in a nuke launch but I was not on any team and when the nuke launch was completed, nothing popped up.
---
What did it cost?
---
The quest completes if someone on ur team launches a nuke.
---
Just started searching after I couldn‚Äôt log in
---
is this confirmed to be working, though? my buddy has been leveling an alt and he‚Äôs still under 50 yet he seems to be getting prime plans as well. we drop our extras and then check each others‚Äô drops for plans we don‚Äôt have yet he already has the prime plans. (basically, neither of us gain by checking each others‚Äô cuz we already know them).
---
Well that's a bummer
---
\*angry completionist noises\*
---
Found the best way to deal with these provocateurs, just get on the mic, area chat, and eat or make annoying little noises... Ignore what they do, but be as annoying as you can without putting much effort into it... They will leave you alone very quickly normally.
---
I‚Äôm definitely testing this theory today
---
PvP can be fun if you are up against people who don't obsess and run around with all the meta duped armor and weapons.
---
Unfortunately the majority of people attacking workshops are also the people who are running around in the best armor and weapons in the game and have super tweaked builds. You basically won't stand a chance in a fight.
---
[ hidden ] 
---
even tho im right in front of enemy
---
It stacks for all pipe weapons that are modded to be rifles, as long as the icon for it still shows up as a pistol on the favorites wheel. So bolt action, revolver, and regular pipe rifle. All can benefit from it. You can get a level 5 bolt action up to just under 200 damage a shot.
---
829 wow that's impressive! I just use t51b. I end up with 633 ER resist + the dodgy perk rank 3 that stacks with the lone wander 20% damage reduction + the emergency protocols on my t51 torso that ignores 50% incoming damage when below 20% health, if I get desperate I pop a phsycobuff for the +65hp which gives my character usually just over 500hp. Which makes the emergency protocols kick in at almost 100 hp. I cant be extremely hard to kill at the end. I can usually tank tesla rifles but there are a few out there that get me super easily..
---
&gt;wer chance with the large gifts. Large presents are the only one you can get the rare taxedermy and holiday plans with
---
Not sure if you mean the crashed santa and icicle lights but if you do my wife found 3 of them in small and medium presents. 
---
IDK about taxidermi plans if so that's good to know!
---
they‚Äôre specifically referring to prime plans and armor plans. i have a friend in an alt under 50 and he‚Äôs getting ALL the plans just like I am.
---
Really i want the best armor for PVP, do you recommend leather? I just see people with explosive LMGs  or explosive AKs
---
congrats! a small part of me had wished there was a tiny hidden reward for completing them all, but alas I didn't get one.
---
Same
---
Noted.  
---
Once I got to the point I could get out of PA, even simple ones like Gorge bridge took me several tries because some of the markers would take their own sweet time to ding.
---
I LOVE that it's weird and annoying. It cracks me up.
---
Well, I knew nothing about it so thanks for the heads up.
---
I just saw a 4:8:200x error and my blood immediately started to boil. Then I saw it was a 2006 and not a 2000 and it cooled down.
---
So if I do it on a lower level alt, I have a better chance of getting the raider/metal plans?
---
&gt; Bethesdas response is neither to balance the loot nor meaningfully ban or punish the cheaters and cheated items.
---
I expect those to happen at or shortly before the launch of Wastelanders. That is, a major ban wave, mass deletion of "illegal" (unobtainable by normal gameplay) items, and a general balance overhaul and nerfs that make currently "meta" builds and gear obsolete. In other words, something similar to what happened to all the duped TSE shotguns around February, shortly before the road map was revealed. Obviously, these kinds of actions are rather unpopular, so it is best to time them for when the outrage can be best kept under control.
---
In order to keep the muling of duped or hacked items under control, I would personally also restrict the trading of rare or end game loot, definitely for players who have only a trial version of the game obtained during a free weekend, but possibly also require a certain level of content completion for entirely unlimited trading (e.g. trial accounts cannot trade legendaries at all, new paid accounts can trade at most 1 per day, full trading is unlocked for an account where at least one character completed the main story and reached level 50).
---
I think he means from a believability standpoint
---
Because I can sell them to a robot for 500, I will buy from players that sell cheap. Yes.
---
However, I usually try to grab the less desirable ones (empath, talons, etc) first. I also never clear out all of any one type. Because I don't want some guy who actually wants to use Marsupial to miss out.
---
I need to do my scout quests, imma do them over Xmas break
---
Alright, thx, I don't care for either ..
---
Studded Heavy Leather limbs give the same DR and over twice the ER
---
I have a hard time believing your first two claims, as when I tried the sink it functioned just like a water pump. 
---
As far as the point about land sources, I don't know who would bother with that tedious task in the first place. Going to a water source you can get plenty of water many times faster than pumps, and it's not like it's hard to fast travel to a river.
---
I bought mine from a vendor for 3500.  I saved the heartache, LOL.  Seen it listed a few other times in vendors, but never at that cost.  I do love it!
---
yes, same.
---
I‚Äôm probably getting close to 300 opened and still haven‚Äôt got either plasma plan or any of the 5 or 6 rare mounted heads. It‚Äôs sort of frustrating, but that‚Äôs how it goes I guess.
---
I‚Äôve gotten every prime plan under the sun, armor plans and hit at least 10 with a 1000 caps in it. 
---
I did get the crash Santa and lights though.
---
PS4 and Xbox would be awesome! maybe PC in the future if they can actually get a handle on the cartels of cheaters and hackers
---
Put Dense on the torso and take the perk that also mitigates explosive damages and explosive weapons/grenades/exploding robots and cars do almost nothing to you.
---
Not sure when it happened. But something changed with locks since release. Month 1 everyone had everything in their base under lock and key. You'd be lucky if you could find that a tato plant that wasn't in some player made vault. Now everything is unlocked. Every player base i find normally means 10-20 free purified waters.
---
that is what i was wondering about. thank you for the clarification. i have been on countless amounts of teams but none of them ever do any quest lines, they only do random events or nuked legendary farming.
---
Servers are up.
---
;dr part is true at least. Possibly because it's TL even. 
---
FYI This one is out of the box thinking and probably something you haven't thought of and should go ahead and read if you like certain gifts :)
---
I just fail to understand for such a large game, why can't get get something like this
---
[https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system)
---
As opposed to them seemingly making decisions on a whim, when it is convenient or when they "feel like it".
---
Guess I've been lucky. I've gotten 4 plasma grenades so far. Now I just need to find the plasma mine.
---
What's matinence? :P
---
It doesn't work on the regular pipe gun, just the revolver and bolt action.
---
Yeah a lot were locked but a lot were also unlocked.  Hope they were intentional and I didn't abscond with someone's water!
---
yeah, they did the same thing with halloween items, first time around anyway
---
I've been away awhile, and PVP was never something that interested me much, but I did love to theorycraft and test ideas.  
---
The current popular meta as I understand things are now, is to stack as many synergized effects with as fast a rate of fire weapon as possible.  That means that the high rate-of-fire weapons like the LMG and Handmade are very powerful when stacked with explosives.  Before, there were particular weapons that completely bypassed defenses and resistances, such as the Railway Rifle and the Tesla Rifle.  Before Rippers and Buzzblades got gimped, a Bloodied Build using Overly Generous perks was a guaranteed death sentence once they got to you.  Most of the above technically could still work, so long as you have the proper gear and perks to make them viable.
---
In the end, what someone said below about combining Leather limbs with Combat torso is probably the best overall stat-spread in terms of armor.  but you'll still get hosed by someone using Rad-damage.
---
Yes. Myself and several people I play with have been using various levelled characters to better pad our chances on getting specific plans. RNG still plays a role, but you can greatly persuade it to your favor.
---
Use this as a guide for targeting specific plans: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0
---
I don't think the plans are actually that rare from gifts, based on the fact that I already got 2. Also I'm level 200+
---
that is what has been datamined and is what people are claiming works. but whether it‚Äôs actually WORKING that way...
---
It does if you put the right stock on it. Set it to the favorites wheel, and make sure it has a rifle stock but the icon still shows it as a pistol. I can't remember which stock I ended up using but one of them works.
---
It's done
---
Definitely blue screens more but the picture quality is so much better.
---
For people with a decent job, it can take less time to earn the price of sold gear with real life work, than to grind for it in game. The same principle makes "time saver" type microtransactions successful.
---
And you expect MVPs or MLGs are playing Fallout 76?
---
Even if nobody seems to believe you, I actually sympathize with you on the basis that 
---
1. They let it go on for so long 
---
2. The method they used provides a benefit of a doubt via just finding them or trading for them.
---
3. Doesn't intentionally or maliciously impede on everyone else's enjoyment where as people who got banned from NW just got 3 days suspensions at first.
---
Yeah I found the camp by accident exploring but no mission. Read the poster multiple times and still nothing
---
Well, can't hurt. Besides, my pipe weapon raider dude needs some love anyway.
---
I'm level 20 currently, started playing this past weekend and have farmed scorch since I started. I have gotten lucky so far on the gifts. I opened the plasma grenade and mounted mothman as well as a good amount of the other mounts from small gifts I got while under level 20.  I dont think it relates to your level or the size of the gift. it's all luck.
---
Ultralight Sturdy Leather is likely a good way to go.
---
The free states icon next to your name is a nice touch
---
Don't use hacked stuff then, could have been easily avoidable
---
Yea,  I frequently get accused of being in god mode by players using energy weapons, Explosive lasers hardly scratch me.
---
Yes; at a minimum level 10 as the heavy raider and metal plans require that level as minimum to drop.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0
---
This game is broken on PS4 after this patch. I had 5 blue screens in one hour, I can‚Äôt play this game anymore.
---
What hacked stuff did he/she use?
---
What kind of protection does it give? Does stury leather give significantly more than reg leather?
---
Like lights, creepy laugh though
---
SMART.
---
Its over!
---
Lower level and large handmade gifts only for lights and santa crash.
---
If you opened everything on say, a level 2, you will exclude anything that requires a minimum level of 5 to drop.
---
Use this as a reference:
---
Find some good Weightless pieces and you'll be good to go.
---
Valid point. You're not really getting the full 1400 if you're buying serums.
---
I got my Adrenal Reaction serum recipe as a reward for finishing the enclave questline way back when. I just make those if I need to.
---
How can I activate the mission for the tadpole ?! I read the poster and nothing happens. I even go to the camp without the mission but still nothing
---
so thats what that was üòÇüòÇ damn snowman. thanks!
---
Well, there were people on here fussing about higher levels buying cheap lower level legendaries and not saving them for new players, so I started leaving those. I don‚Äôt need any rustled jimmies in my life!
---
Stuff spawned in then sold in vendors, simply owning the stuff will flag you as a cheater.
---
Basically the 4-5 star items and wrong legendary effects on stuff which can't have it.
---
I run ultralite on my armor so it doesn't weigh a lot. The weight of armor also effects that. Light armor gives less dr and er but weighs less. Heavy gives more dr and er but weighs more.
---
Oh my bad, thought you meant the grenade!!  The mine isn't quite so rare, no idea what it goes for. My bad.
---
a thanks for the info üòÅüëçüèº
---
Is there any data verification on the chameleon mutation working even with normal armor?
---
That‚Äôs a very interesting find and I‚Äôm gonna pick one up on all chars anyways even for a chance to benefit! Thanks for sharing
---
Lol, good idea. Thanks.
---
Do you know if thats the case here?
---
You obviously didn't even read the post.
---
Try not playing with armour at all, it‚Äôs a whole new way to play. You‚Äôd be surprised at how dangerous ghouls can be a higher levels when you don‚Äôt have any armour on!
---
GammEagle Scout
---
Fairy dust
---
Not sure what one that is. If you know the plan name I can check. I do have walls and doors though
---
Finally awesome thanks for letting me know dude
---
No, if anyone launches a nuke, it should complete.
---
At 7PM EST each day starting last night a reward will become available. The last rewards (14000 Overseer XP Fur-Lined Jacket) will be available at 7PM EST Sunday....after that you've got until the 6th to get them all. Happy Hunting!
---
*Human NPC
---
I have a MODUS bot on discord that send a message in a channel each time a Bethesda community manager says something on the forums or on reddit. It also gives the nukes codes, just so you know this also exists.
---
I've got tons of duplicate blueprints for sale at half off or more. I'll pop on the public servers later tonight. Im on pc as ndmonkey.
---
"During today‚Äôs downtime, we removed items that could only be obtained by cheating through abuse of an exploit. We also implemented additional measures to address that exploit."
---
So anyone getting banned have either spawned stuff in themselves or own said stuff which triggers bans under the new measures.
---
The Santa is kind of similar, it doesn't stop doing that jingle, but I appreciate the waving. I shut it off after the first few minutes, oh my god. lol
---
I am going to move all my gifts to my level 15 today and see how it goes.
---
I‚Äôll report what happens for me. Honestly, I hope it‚Äôs working exactly as you suggest.
---
Ah yes, silly me for forgetting wildlife exists
---
1) I wanted an online Fallout game long ago. Now my dream came true, not perfectly, but still ok.
---
2) The Enclave is joinable. I hope there will be more new quests.
---
I have the water fountain and it gives more water then purified and also heals like purified... And the drink first then collect is the same speed or faster.. beats leaving my camp to collect water when all I want to do is craft and go back to what I was doing my water fountain is 10 feet away from my cooking station takes seconds to seconds to collect 100 water or I can fast travel cost caps spend 5/10min in loading times for the same amout
---
If your on Xbox join me and take a look for yourself or use someone's at thier camp
---
Why would you want to steal gifts? Man... Porch thieves are the lowest of low.
---
Okay
---
I tried selling serums cheap. I couldn‚Äôt keep up with the materials to farm them and most people bought them to resell. I finalized at 350 and only one of each type at a time so people wouldn‚Äôt take more than they need
---
Yep and a lot of comments that are reasonable and advocate for more rules and harsher punishments get downvotes while "its just a game" gets upvoted... seems like there are almost more cheaters than honest players around :(

There are a few posts with datamined info that I believe says she ignores around 70% damage. In my experience that is fairly accurate. Gatling lasers and plasmas do well enough with the right prefixes. Most people use bloodied and junkies for the Queen nowadays.
---
Yep, i was flabbergasted when i saw that one of the sellers made nearly 50k this year alone, thats ridiculous...
---
What do you mean ‚Äòfixed‚Äô
---
No, Bessie stays her milk shake brings all the boys to the yard!
---
Yeah whatever floats your boat I use to live on a lake but got tired of it so I moved and I don't have to rely on a natural water source
---
Interesting, that's the first I've heard of serum recipes dropping as a quest reward. Are you sure it didn't drop from the queen before they changed that way back?
---
Sorry don't want to seem like a dick, but do you have confirmation of this? I personally haven't seen anything. I hope that it's the case though!
---
I forgot how to spell üòÇ
---
I didn't mean to be harsh to the OP but that's how it is.
---
Though they're welcome to submit an appeal explaining their story.
---
How in the world did you do the one where you kill a yao guai with a syringe gun?  Cause I've been working on that sucker for a while.
---
theft has been a working mechanic of Fallout games since the beginning.
---
Is it worth it though as a high level?  I just a furious explosive revolver I was thinking about modding out and switch around some perk cards for.  I have enough points in agility and perception to max out pistol and rifle.  Guess I‚Äôll try it and see.
---
So you can get out of your power armor (PVE set) and PVP
---
Not sure why you're getting down-voted, it's your opinion.
---
Congratulations!! That is amazing scout
---
They were not collecting gifts :(
---
This happens to me from time to time. There is no on screen reward message for some reason, but I have verified that we still receive the reward items.
---
in my neighborhood, Turrets are much more important.
---
I‚Äôve only been playing for a month and feel like I need to google every item I get as a quest reward before junking it in case it‚Äôs rare. 
---
While doing the BOS quest line I came across a red asylum outfit, I didn‚Äôt even bother to pick it up.
---
Mysterious Savior is better, Stranger is trash in this outing :(
---
There are plenty of dirtbags playing too. Hopefully you don't run into them but they are out there.
---
I'm having the same issue.
---
I am lvl 234 and got both lights and Santa from large handmade.
---
They don't show up in the reward screen, so you probably got one and never noticed it
---
Yeah i got it, was just wondering if you knew the case for this ban
---
I think they're absolutely worth it. But that could just be my two shot Ultracite Gatling Laser talking for me...
---
Same DR as what?
---
For we are all motes of dust beat forth from his dusty wings, and when we perish, like a moth to the flame, we shall return to him.
---
Maybe cross-console play, but even if they fix the cheating, PC players have an advantage with the mouse.
---
Console and PC should remain seperate, IMO
---
Remember to lock your Santatron Collection Boxes
---
The scout polymer.
---
As did I, the reason I say lower level is because any plan requiring a minimum level of 5 to drop will be eliminated from the drop table and allow a higher chance for the lights/santa plans to drop.
---
Side note, I saw a person I think on One of the 76 pages  on Facebook saying that there needs to be a group for order of mysteries, if you are looking for players you my want to post invites, unless it was your post I was seeing, hope this doesn‚Äôt sound rude
---
üòÇ I had to, my b
---
I usually set my prices at 25% of the ¬´value¬ª how is that considered on the cheap/expensive scale?
---
Can you? Yes.  
---
Should you? No.  
---
Will you? I dunno... maybe? I don't know you.
---
I'm not saying that they should totally nerf Charleston capital but you have to admit that 2 dozen+ level 62 charred feral ghouls is a bit overwhelming to anyone
---
That damn bot keeps saying that I'm a tadpole...
---
Positive, it was a really long time ago, but I hadn't done the queen even once yet.
---
Ah oke yeah makes sense
---
a lot of ppl saying they did not. i think i had a few appear in my Stash BUT i had also stashed some gifts so I really can‚Äôt say.
---
but they‚Äôre there today!
---
cool thanks, i would way rather grind the event than work the missions!
---
Maybe I just like a challenge? The game seems so easy in most places these days.
---
I will attempt but I‚Äôm going to let my ‚ÄúRaider role play‚Äù simmer cuz irl I want everyone to get everything they want from the event.
---
But come January 1st, it‚Äôs back to ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs
---
mine is mine and what‚Äôs yours is mine, too.‚Äù
---
I'm not arguing that, it is just my opinion
---
It has in real life too, doesn't make it right.
---
It can‚Äôt be completed
---
You can't finish it yet, even after collecting all the holotapes
---
What about Graham?
---
Dont forget those poor robots who are the real b
---
Npc's in 76
---
I don't know how it compares with a rifle or commando build, but the Bloodied Pipe Revolver with a rifle stock has been my daily driver on my alt for quite a while.  It'll one shot pretty much every mob enemy and hits around the 1,800-2,800 range.
---
At least it's good to hear they improved water needs without being on a river.  I could have used that when I lived in the toxic valley.  I'm just too lazy to rebuild my camp again.
---
Way ahead of you lol
---
Super mutants arent considered humans
---
So is anyone else noticing that they keep adjusting the spawn rate for the holiday scorched?  When the event started they were everywhere, then it got nerfed, then it was raised back up slightly and yesterday it was nerfed again.  Yesterday morning the route I was doing would give 4-6 a server hop.  Last night and today 2-3.  Same route the day the event started was 6-8.  I've been doing this on multiple servers every day with basically the same yeilds on every server.  Pretty sure it's not just bad RNG or the returns wouldn't be so consistent day by day.
---
Definitely agree.  I noticed this happening to me too, a long with the armor and gun degradation issues. My stuff is breaking so fast now that I just don't even want to play.
---
I personally believe it depends more on people‚Äôs connections, but if you say that be prepared to be burned at the stake.
---
I am absolutely consuming more water than normal, like ridiculously fast. And nothing has changed.
---
I love that tower! Wouldnt mind seeing more pics of your camp if you dont mind sharing
---
Honestly miss that feature. It made PA feel much more special.
---
Do you have to set it to collect junk to get one ? I think I have mine on scrap
---
I sell my toxic water at 25,000.
---
So my serums can sell for 50.
---
Bad weapon strength armor and thirst now my armor breaks daily almost after being repaired
---
Just quick question, do you know that OP for certain had items like this, or are you just making the assumption that if he got banned there had to be a good reason?
---
What they said. Unsure why, but for some reason it doesn't complete after you collect the last of the holotapes. Maybe there's another loose one, way off the beaten path that no one has found yet, but so far everyone had the same side quest stuck in their log.
---
You poor soul
---
set it to collect gifts
---
I use party boy and carry around a 12er of beer. There's also plenty of booze out there for the takin'.
---
Need a Wasteland Ring Doorbell to keep an eye on the Santatron
---
I completely agree. Silly bugs are one thing, but challenges completely broken, hacking/duping at an all time high, and the over emphasizing on the Atomic shop. And let's not forget about a 12.99 premium membership, that rolled out broken. 
---
I miss the old Bethesda.
---
how about they fix the current one first. the timer is terrible. if they need a timer to up the difficulty, just give rewards based on completion time. 
---
if they keep the same bad mechanics, each raid will add 3 20 minute tasks, this will just take too much time and continue to not be fun
---
It‚Äôs rad and energy resist
---
Unfortunately this time it's worse as you  need to unlock one after the other even if all are visible, no retroactive xp gain on all.
---
Well I had all my 3* sentinel armour I've had for a while, which took fucking ages to get, they honestly can't do anything fucking right.
---
I got the rest of the badges a while ago too.
---
So no idea if there are new bugged challenges or they reintroduced old bugs (it wouldn't be a surprise...), but I was able to get all of them without any major problem (again, after the patch).
---
I remember now that one of the bugged challenges was "get X Strenght points". For me was impossible to get. No matter how many strenght points I had in my character, never seemed enough to complete it.
---
Without hackers, who would reverse engineer the anti-cheat?  Without hackers, who would tell you that the fearmongers that say nonsense like comms are unencrypted and inventory is client side authoritative is bullshit?
---
&gt; I saw this dilemma pooping up
---
Hehehe.
---
Word. I'm gonna making a PvP build, so I will try again. Still high as a kite
---
I understand your point but in all honesty it doesnt affect anything. If I share a server with someone that paid for a 3*Fixer and a full set of 3* unyielding heavy combat armor and is wearing a red asylum uniform while having every other "god" weapon or armor in his inventory, it doesnt affect me in the slightest. I play as normal and I turn on pacifist mode. Nothing about my game is affected by that individual. 
---
Even then, any "real" fallout 76 player knows how to manipulate the game anyway to be OP. By that I mean they are way past lvl 50 and use a bloodied or junkie build and probably use the trading Reddit anyway to get what they want.
---
And so what if someone buys stuff for real money. It doesnt make them indestructible. It just shows that
---
they're an idiot, has disposable income or impatient. Many people have the same equipment and they've gotten them through normal gameplay, luck and legit trades. 
---
PVP is a joke anyway in this game and the only people that are really into it are people who are just bored of it and are just going through the motions of the game just for the sake of playing.
---
People take this stuff way to seriously and need to get over it. So many ways to avoid this issue (if there was a legit issue to begin with). Fallout 1st provides the player with their own server, block the player you suspect is "cheating" whether its their gamertag or in game, switch servers, ignore them all together, so many ways to avoid the "cheating" issue.
---
Or is push comes to shove, report them and move on to something else.
---
i think it‚Äôs alright to deviate from social norms while playing a video game.
---
No kidding.
---
Holy shit did someone tame the queen??
---
Death from Above yes I fully agree I see it all the time. But I'm referring to the personal quest line "I am become death"
---
now i wanna see mark rober: fallout edition
---
Nothing. No reward after completing all of them (well, actually the personal reward for beeing able to complete all of them, but you understand me)
---
So.. getting placement (final 10) want to say nets around 300 xp from time. With couple kills probably getting 350 - 450 for a good game without winning. So you need around 30 good games to get the final unlock! How long do we have to do that?
---
Thanks :) I enjoyed this challenges a lot
---
Without hackers, we could actually get decent NW matches and not this joke. Without hackers, the market wouldn't be flooded with overpowered 5 star weapons.
---
Grind campfire tales. You can get fixer plan from that as well
---
And wooby
---
With all that‚Äôs been going all lately, I‚Äôd say you are correct
---
Her quest isn't complete yet. Hopefully it will wrap up in Wastelanders. She's got some answering to do.
---
It was bugged for my friends and I saying we couldn‚Äôt complete certain ones. Is this finally fixed? Or was it just not bugged for some people?
---
I work on weekends, but I can definitely fit time in since it‚Äôs slower
---
So many thirsty gamer boizzz.
---
Have you run it before on the higher levels?
---
Talk too the scoutmaster Mr Handy robot at the main camp up in the Ash Heap.  If that doesn't work, your quest may be bugged.
---
Last time I tried, well I was restoring it from a backup, the launcher absolutely refused to play ball. Eventually just had to re-download it unfortunately. Was especially disappointing as other launchers can deal with this no problem. 
---
Things could've changed though, this was months ago.
---
Weightless Heavy Combat
---
If you're looking for a challenge, you can actually build at that house too :P
---
Eh, energy resist isn't really major either. Between Evasive, Barbarian, and heavy leather arms and legs I still have over 400 with the high capacity backpack on.
---
It absolutely is, but you are still stealing a gift from a real person, which has its own consequences.
---
Is that on PC?
---
If they appeared in your stash they're not from Santratron.
---
Ya it‚Äôs just borked right now. The caps animation in particular has been broken for months.
---
Easiest way to tell is if you get a legendary armor piece as a reward. You‚Äôll still get the legendary animation without seeing the quest completion rewards.
---
Until the 6th. The final reward is unlocked at 7PM EST Sunday...so basically 2 weeks after that.
---
This may not be the most efficient or correct move process but i did just did a new install on a new laptop and this was the process i used (modified slightly for this situation). Backup the entire Fallout 76 folder, just to be safe i would backup the Fallout 76 folder in the My Documents location as well. Uninstall the game. Re-Install the game to the new location so the Launcher setups the folder how it likes then cancel the install. Move your files to the new location and tell it to install if you got the folder structure correct it should recognize the files check them and skip redownloading the entire thing.
---
very true. i noted on another comment i‚Äôm actually going to give pause and not steal gifts because i actually want other players to get the plans and stuff they‚Äôd like.
---
i still think it‚Äôs a fantastic mechanic.
---
Sadly this is where we run into game mechanic limitations. I would love it if we could rig explosives into trapped gifts to leave as surprises for theives. But alas we cannot.
---
Ya I run the grounded mutation which negates it.
---
At this point I‚Äôm so used to using the high capacity backpack I rarely take if off.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt consider a prime plan one of the best gifts. Barley sell for 500 caps as is
---
Damn. I had 6 blue screens in under two hours.
---
Same.
---
Also just noticed your user name. Hello cousin!
---
Great to hear! During maintenance today, we increased the chances that Santatron will find Holiday Gifts during the Holiday Scorched event. So through the end of the month, you should get at least 1 gift per hour on average, if not more. It's still possible to have a bad string of luck, but Santatron should be much more generous overall now.
---
So i've just started playing again and have no idea what's a rare plan and whats common (I'm level 76 funnily enough).
---
What are the *practical* plans i should be looking out for, or keep farming until i obtain?
---

I don't think Plague Walker can initiate PvP, but very few people actually use it. It can hurt your teammates and make non-hostile creatures turn hostile. I believe this unintended harm to teammates and friendly creatures was fixed a while ago, but every now and then these fixes are broken in an update. Since the mutation has very little positive impact, I'd recommend going without Plague Walker anyway.

If you ever do run into a situation where someone is able to force you into PvP through mutations, take a Rad-X. This suppresses your mutations for 10 minutes, giving you time to find a way out of the situation.
---
this would have been brilliant! maybe next year
---
Damn, I had 6 of those in just under two hours. This really sucks and does not give me any type of hope whatsoever for wastelanders. I‚Äôve never had the game be actually broken for me.
---
It's a Christmas Miracle!
---
oh? never bothered with them before so I thought they were slighly more valuable. good to know
---
You get the recipe from completing the Arktos Pharma event, then you can craft them. It's a rare drop I think. I have all the plans/rewards that can drop from that event, but that one I still don't have it.
---
I was able to complete that challenge because some time ago I found 3 Stimpak Diffusers in a random player's vending machine and bought them.
---
And I think "be a condiut X times" challenge is written wrong or bugged, because for me was only necessary to do it a couple of times.
---
this a BGS official? name looks familiar
---
Hacker have been able to spawn NPC's for some time, even the SBQ, but that might have been stop'd after the maintenance today...
---
This was probably spawned by a hacker.
---
Yeah, I hope they add more ranks in the future. I like this type of challenges
---
Not sure that it was a glitch , it‚Äôs just the percentage chance of the santatron finding one was very low
---
I dunno man, I fast travel in less than 1 minute lol. Scoop up about 30-40 water and that will last me for the next 3-4 sessions. It's not remotely a problem from my view.
---
I own the sink so I'll try it out when I log next and compare the things you mention.
---
That's my question also, nothing in the post implies that the OP had any of that, nor does it even mention what platform he was on.
---
With chainsaw hands! Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz!
---
Sparkimus Prime will not allow it!
---
I came in here to make the same reference. Finally a fellow Redditor with taste
---
Nice, congrats.
---
This was literally minutes after the servers came back up from maintenance
---
Save your picture folder (games/fallout76/etc.), reinstall on new drive, load game, take at least 1 picture, copy backup pictures to the new picture folder.
---
All character data is online, so if you dont care about photos, just uninstall, reinstall on new drive. 
---
Fo76 is a "sensitive" game, and easy to break. You are much better off reinstalling than trying to move it.
---
I‚Äôm actually really hoping crossplay (if it ever is made) includes PC, then not only will you have to deal with this shit like the rest of us, but we‚Äôll also get Bethesda to give a shit.
---
Go with ultra light heavy leather, not sturdy. Better overall, and weighs like 5lbs all together if I remember right.
---
It's a hacker. They've been doing this for over a week now. They gained access to the data files (well done on cyber security Bethesda) &amp; basically anything in those files they have been able to place in game. Human NPC's, The Prydwen, &amp; The scorched queen to name a few. Thing is they are uncoded &amp; as of right now harness placements....for now. lol
---
I haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôve only done it once so far.. no one ever really cared to do it..
---
Ha same. My first nuke was when I was like 250. If this was yesterday and on PS4 it sounds like me and my boys. They are 200 and 70. I'm level 340 and did not go in the silo.  But they did help someone launch a nuke but it was only the three of us that took down the Queen. lol If Kronic and Puffers sound familiar it was us...
---
Hopefully long enough to fix whatever they did in the last update and patch. It broke my game, and I‚Äôm not one of those people who complain about FO76 just to complain I actually like the game. I get a blue screen crash about every 15 minutes, sometimes longer sometimes sooner. Had 5 crashes in one hour. I did all the trouble shooting stuff and it‚Äôs still crashing consistently.
---
crap, that means they still can, if it wasn't a real glitch :/
---
I dipped out right after getting the backpack Tryin to make a change :-\
---
Scout Polymer IS 54/30, Hvy Studded is 32/77
---
I wish stolen presents turned into glitter bombs....
---
I was just thinking about this last night.  I've been fortunate to get 2 Plasma Grenade plans at this point.  
---
But I'm really after 3 pieces of Raider PA to finish my sets.  Not sure it is worth leveling an alt to 15-16 just to remove the other PA pieces.  There's still a lot of other stuff in the pool but if I go another few days without any signs of hope, I may take a run at it LOL&gt;
---
Nah im on pc mate but its good you were helping someone out
---
During today‚Äôs downtime, we removed items that could only be obtained by cheating through abuse of an exploit. We also implemented additional measures to address that exploit.
---
Additionally, the community has let us know loud and clear that Santatron wasn‚Äôt being generous enough with its Holiday Gifts. 
---
Thanks to your feedback, we‚Äôve significantly increased the chances that your Santatron will find a Holiday Gift when it goes out to scavenge. 
---
You should (on average) receive at least one per hour.
---
Well that‚Äôs definitely strange! I‚Äôm surprised no one else has any input on this. I only have my main and 1 alt character and it worked fine for me on both. Bummer man that backpack is an absolute game changer for me!
---
If you believe you've done nothing wrong you could try sending a ticket to Bethesda to see if they can look into it for you.
---
Roasted rad ant adds 10 carry weight. I think Brahmin ribeye steak adds 20 carry weight. Deathclaw steak adds 2 strength. Psychobuff adds 3 strength. Whiskey with party boy adds 6 strength. Nuka dark with party boy and cola nut also adds 6 strength. There's a few others I'm probably missing like xcell adds 2 to each special, but chems and alcohol don't stack very well.
---
Every time it snows the game will break and delete your settlement.
---
We tested this on a level 2 character, and it‚Äôs definitely confirmed.  My buddy got two plasma grenade plans just opening 14 packages.
---
Did that the moment I built one, damn pesky raiders
---
This is me too üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
So how would you decide? If its just your friends then wouldn't they already be on your team? It just sounds like a useless feature/mechanic. I personally wouldn't want that. My teammates already have that right &amp; I'm cool with that. Just my opinion though, no disrespect intended to your idea.
---
I have  friends who would draw a penis on my camp, and label it with bright  neon letters.
---
I like not being able to get anything in the tent other than the wreath
---
So what was the exploit and what did they do? Not very descriptive.
---
They're like superman, need time to change into the outfit.
---
Yeah, Arktos Pharma is a hard event to complete (specially if nobody else is there helping you). I recommend you to find some friends to do it or you can just buy them like I did
---
Take a look at replacing your purified water with inert flux. Same thirst, half the weight. But you trade 25hp for 5rad + 5 disease 
---

FYI Class Freak doesn't help with Speed Demon. You'll burn through food/water the same with or without it, unfortunately.
---
Ok listen. It's like you go to the social tab, you select a person ( on the server ), and you'll see an option ( which you'll have to check it ) that allows that player to be able to edit your CAMP. this can be deactivated aswell
---
If you still play Fallout 76, you deserve this. You WANT to play a  broken game. You WANT to continue paying Bethesda for their fuck-ups.  You DESERVE to be scammed. You DESERVE your stats to be cut. You made  your bed, now you sleep in it. You keep playing this trash, you keep  telling Bethesda it's okay to run this business model. Congratulations,  you get what you asked for. How about instead of complaining that fire  burns, you actually stop putting your hands into it? How about you stop  playing Bethesda games? How about you stop shooting yourself in the  foot? Oh, what's that? It's too much to ask? Well then, enjoy bashing  your skull against a wall some more. Not like you have any brain in  there anyway.
---
Did these show up in the F1st section of the atomic shop or are all tents automatically converted?
---
Hell yeah it did! I felt like a real commando when I did the training for it lol.
---
You will see the overseer again in wastelanders.  
---
The quest isnt over yet, they planned to have it continue through the DLC.
---
We might get an end to it in a few more months.  Or not.
---
Definitely have hit multiple public and private servers and the spawn rate is consistent across all servers for me every day.  Yesterday I ran collision course four times on four separate servers and all runs ended with anywhere from 2 to 3 gifts.  Did the same this morning and 2 runs gave 1, 2 runs had zero.  Seems way to consistent to me.  Maybe I should get out the tin foil hat for my dude.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. I didn‚Äôt hack/ spawn anything in. I just crafted some Large Holiday gifts
---
I was going to give them hours to figure out a way around whatever Bethesda did,  not minutes.
---
People were hacking in 5 star legendary items through a script injector afaik. Good to see they got that one cleared up before the studio packs up for holidays.
---
I don‚Äôt lock anything and never will... no water, junk or even a present is worth it...
---
PC only most likely as it‚Äôs pretty rampant atm such as 5* explosive plasma rifles and clean Mr Fuzzy outfits.
---
I know it's complicated but you can see all the legendary effects at:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) 
---
They're just acronyms for those.
---
The one you mention is damage resistance while reloading.
---
I never got that far I couldn't get into it knowing the backpack was all I wanted from it
---
Since they changed it to a public event and now it appears randomly isn't that easy. Back in the day was the best way (and easiest) to farm Possum badges, but I think no longer is
---
Yea still a hard pass for me mate. But I am curious WHY would you want that? Letting people build &amp; destroy things in your camp? If you're wanting that option so you can give it to your friends then why not just add them to the team?
---
You can't participate in PvP until level 5 anyway so he wouldn't have been able to fight you even if he wanted to.
---
Can anyone confirm that this works on PS4 ? I had a buddy build balloons in my base last night but it did not work.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ckwrhi/im_lvl_150_and_i_have_no_idea_what_the_acronyms/
---
A quick search brought that up.
---
To be fair, I'm level 300+ and I wouldn't have been able to come up with the meaning of some of those.  It's a pretty decent summary.
---
You're complaining.  Me and my friend can pull of the raids and we took the challenge, I'm sure anyone else can do it if they are willing. I'm tired killing shit easily
---
I saw some neat stuff in a datamine that looks like New Years is getting atom shop love tho. Not sure if they released all the Christmas stuff yet.
---
I love the reaction when McNamara finds out you already have training.
---
no one owning any of that stuff got banned so for dont spit out any bs please
---
DIE CHEATAH
---
If it was me,  you're welcome. I spent my play session yesterday dressed as Santa visiting players alone in their CAMP, buying up their spare 5.56 ammo and dropping off gift boxes with at least a toy inside and (sometimes) a scrip level legendary. Gotta do something with all my Mr. Fuzzies and level 1 furious lead pipes.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who wants to  nuke a random location, I was thinking about nuking Vault 76 or Watonga (my character is a raider)
---
ooh thank you!
---
You can only get so many through effort though. And yea, you can buy Atoms. So it's a cash shop.
---
lol u mad
---
If you build camps for people and get kicked or blue screen you can‚Äôt touch anything you laid down previously. It‚Äôs a huge pain in the ass. Most people don‚Äôt build camps for others though so for 99% of people this wouldn‚Äôt matter.
---
Tangentially related fun fact, that is a much more male sentiment than male.
---
Or if you get into a NW match, you can get mutations from radiation.
---
I used symbolic links. You don't need reinstall.
---
Symlinks are very useful (not only games) and done in seconds.
---

---
Any idea if it give gifts when set to junk mode instead of the default setting?  I changed it to junk last night because it seems to collect faster and gives me more useful stuff in scraptron mode.
---
Okay Todd, were not buying it.
---
I completely overlooked that..... I already have the waste.... I just need to deposit it
---
Cannot instigate pvp with you by unlocking your stuff.. they just incur a bounty.
---
If you have a mutation like electrically charged a person with a bounty can spark you into pvp which is prob what you‚Äôre thinking about..  but they could get the bounty anywhere it doesn‚Äôt have to be your stuff
---
I buy under 200, but I have them in my vendor for 275 to 300. I figure that's cheap enough people will buy them to use them, or they can resell to vendors and I still make something off of them. 
---
I found a guy on Xbox last month that advertised in the official club that he was selling for 200 caps. I get to his camp, he set all of his Marsupial to 20 caps. I bought him out. I think I still have 75 of them from that purchase, and I sell a few a day out of my vendors.
---
Bet OP will be first in line for Fallout 5 and TES6.
---
oh duh im on PC
---
Just went and looked checked the stats for Robot since the wikia doesn't have a full compilation.
---
Heavy Robot Limbs are 17DR/17ER/15RR and weigh 2.4 lb apiece.  The Chest I think is 42DR/42ER/25RR and likewise weighs about 4.8 lb (I don't have the recipe for Heavy, but based on my Sturdy/Heavy recipes, I think those are the ballpark figures).  So on average it weighs about .9 lbs more than the Leather equivalent, has better all around protection across all damage types, and weighs roughly 1-2 lb less than Combat/Marine.
---
I'm unsure how it's incoherent. Everybody I've spoken to besides you understands the argument, it's just about whether they agree with it. I'm actually making an effort to try and explain what I'm arguing and why, given you've called me disingenuous and a liar. The latter of which you still haven't taken responsibility for given clear evidence you were wrong.
---
Find out yourself how it went. Given your tone, and the ad hominems, I don't owe anything to you.
---
That's not in my evidence. It's just a personal supposition. Zenimax bought a new studio a month ago. They settled for several hundred million dollars with Facebook. Skyrim is on switch now. They'll be fine.
---
No. Bethesda doesn't spend time and money fixing bugs, and then launches a massive update and introduces 200 more. Bethesda does this. Other developers, especially other Triple A developers, don't have 200 bugs that need fixing to begin with. And when they release massive updates, there's no worry of introducing 200 more. It's a non-issues for the vast majority of other developers. That's the standard I hold Bethesda to. To be at least as good or close to as good at this as other developers. Which they clearly are falling very short of and to be quite honest, I'm gonna keep calling them out on it until they improve. You don't like it? Tough. Block me I guess.
---
I expected it. Opinions get down voted. I was just wondering if I'm the only one. But no one would probably speak up in fear of getting down voted üòÇ
---
Back in the day I remember that some badges where bugged and I couldn't complete, but they fixed them some time after that and thank God I was able to get them.
---
This was a while ago, so no idea if it remains the same. Some people are saying that some challenges are still bugged for them, but wasn't my case. I don't know if this are new bugged challenges or they reintroduced old bugs (it wouldn't be a surprise...)
---
Man speakin the truth, they wont listen tho. Let them play their shit game. They will see it for what it is eventually haha
---
if you are some crafty dweller, take super duper, farm dogwood bleach, get some coal and make water filters
---
then just collect dirty water and craft as many purified water as you can and proc super duper, this helped me to get rid of those water purifiers that take a lot of my camp budget
---
Oh look, a brand new bot account.
---
He follows his trade winds.
---
NICE.
---
I get that... it‚Äôs just a start of the process... they pic to start crap... which ultimately ends in what they want. 
---
Sorry but if you are stealing water or scrap or anything else that you can farm 10x more in 10 minutes or less... your bored with the game... move on to something else... 
---
I leave all mine unlocked... never had an issue and my stuff isn‚Äôt messed with since most are looking for locked ones.
---
That seems dumb.
---
I guess I should test it out. After weeks of trying we gave up on certain ones cuz of bugs. So I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I didn‚Äôt notice they were fixed a while back lol.
---
The flux to make the serum costs more than 100 caps. You‚Äôd be better off selling straight flux than serums if you‚Äôre going that cheap.
---
I may be an idiot
---
But how does one do this
---
Stop having a blast! - üêëOP
---
Must have crashed on his scorched beast run... lol
---
I honestly have not had near the amount of issues I hear about on here.. I have a good time on this game not many crashes, but also this is my first online game I ever played and honestly the fallout series is about the only games I have played in years so maybe I just cant nerd out enough to see what all these problems are these people keep bitching about.. ya know wife kids and work and all that shit dont have time for anger towards people I will never meet
---
That's ok. Actually there's no reason to complete all the challenges once you unlock the backpack and a mod for it (unless you are completionist like me xD)
---
Nope. That was patched long ago.
---
Suddenly I like the overseer much more!
---
Then none of them would still work? They all do though, I have an alt that's a pure weapon build
---
i just got a small gift!
---
sorry I‚Äôm having a good time
---
You want examples? Or do you want to just believe what you want to believe?
---
You know actually nevermind. I can give you a list of bugs I've experienced just in this last week, and you wouldn't believe me anyway.
---
It is :D
---
neato!

I want to hear to fallout take of the arrow in the knee line

that Nuka bottle decoration tho
---
Am I? Merely contemplating. I've got rid of FO 76 a long, long time ago. I'm playing outer worlds now. Enjoying myself. And I'm also enjoying FO 76, by looking at the outrage which happens, oh, but about every week?   
---
In the past week alone, I've watched people be pissed about hackers importing FO4 items and NPCs. And Bethesda breaking armor and weapons. Both major incidents, in just a week. In fact .. I'm getting more entertainment out of FO76 than you do. By watching all y'all willingly being scammed. Best of all? For free.
---
Maybe not you, but a bunch of people did
---
I'm trying to figure out what is better for stealth,  I have a full set of unyielding sneak armor, and also a full set of chameleon sneak armor.  I think the unyielding armor is better due to the extra agility.
---
Solo?  Or Team?
---
If solo, then the only way to go is sneak/VATS Crits sniper IMO.  The trick is if using VATS, your VATS effectiveness is based heavily on weapon weight, so big heavy rifles like the Handmade, Level-Action, and so forth are counter-productive to how rapidly and efficiently you can VATS.  You need either a reduced weight weapon or consider doing what I did, and go for a double-dipped Pipe Bolt/Revolver rifle, because of the  way pistol and rifle perks stack for them.  A fully tricked out Pipe-Bolt for sniping weighs about... 8-9 lbs, compared with a fully tricked out Handmade weighing almost 19 lb.
---
you should be able to see it in game
---
&gt; Still, I blame Bethesda for being incompetent.
---
That's the thing - from the hacking perspective, the game is really solid.  They slipped up in *this one place* (not properly vetting items clients claim to place during base building) and trust the client's position and that's about it.  And as far as trusting the client's position, if you check hacking forums you'll see that everyone **to this day** still thinks position is server authoritative because they haven't figured out how to manipulate position yet, because it's not as straight forward as other games.
---
The game's anti-cheat is amateur hour but it's not really even necessary because the game's not that hackable.  This isn't PUBG, Arma, DayZ, Ark, or any of those client authoritative games that need Orwellian anti-cheats with kernel modules and spyware to protect the game because even with complete control over the client there isn't a whole lot you can do.  Todd Howard, for all his failings in making this game, did the right thing from a security perspective and made a sane client/server model for a multiplayer game.  Supposedly they worked with the guys at Id to do the networking so kudos to them.
---
O.o.  Does anyone really care about this?
---
I know I don‚Äôt.
---
Nope. Through and through with all Bethesda games. Won't even be playing Doom Eternal. I'll stick to Doom 1 and 2. Unlike you, I've learned my lesson.
---
This is a hard no/pass from me, guy
---
And the gane of never-ending whack-a-mole continues. I hope they'll do another pass to delete hacked/duped items, but I doubt it'll happen before they take their holiday break.
---
Good for you.  Here's a gold star.

LT/L2 on console. I can‚Äôt say what it is for PC.

---
Im goiing to throw you a few of the more common abbreviations that will help you understand more posts  until the Mods do something like this.
---
DRWR = +250 Damage Reduction while Reloading.
---
FFR = Faster Fire Rate
---
FSS = Faster Swing Speed
---
TSE = Two Shot Explosive
---
Some people also use numbers to designate effects, for example
---
B3325 = Bloodied, 33% Vats accuracy, 25% less vats.
---
To understand the numbers you have to know all the effects and what slots they occupy.  Here is a list of all the legendary effects and what slots they occupy
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)

Nope, it only shows owned stuff in the F1st section
---
nice, that should make the odds better for the others
---
play minecraft

It sucks having to spend stash space on alternate power armor, future use power armor pieces and regular armor pieces for when I have to do a ‚Äúnaked‚Äù core loot run.  Seems wasteful

Try to login again you might just got the maintenance message

That happened to me yesterday. Spawned in to TWO SBQ at my camp right across from overseer camp. (PC)
---
Hacking for sure
---
Oh, look somebody who hates the game and doesn't play yelling at others for what they do! What an original post idea!!! My entire viewpoint is now changed!!! /s
---
You misunderstand. Far away from me anger and hatred. I'm merely having fun with FO76 ... For free. Maybe you haven't progressed far enough into FO76 to have legendary armor/weapons but ... That reload bug? Chances are, you didn't experience it because you didn't make it that far.  
---
Which is fine if you have money to throw away. Not everybody can be shrewd. Not everyone wants some band for their buck. And that is fine. I can respect that. What I do find funny, however, is people complaining about the very same thing they keep pouring money into. The solution is simple, yet they refuse to take it.
---
I mean I doubt they‚Äôll try to get rid of duped items at this point, but they did get rid of anything with 4 or 5 stars. But they didn‚Äôt get rid of the stuff that had unobtainable legendary effects
---
Are you telling him to use 'Inseminator Armor?'
---
I learned that lesson the hard way. Not going to happen again. I'm not into PVP, just wanna sell my wares and grind levels.
---
Hell yeah mate! Having a blast removing and re-equipping your armor every time you reload a weapon! When life gives you lemons, amirite?
---
Do you think I should move things around to add better criticals?
---
so players that dont have F1st cannot see others‚Äô xmas tents???
---
What's your available times u can be on
---
Yeah I just gave up. I did like ten with no badges so that‚Äôs it for me.
---
No I mean the item doesn't show in the store unless you have FO1st
---
Hopefully, since her quest doesn‚Äôt seem to have completed, she‚Äôll come back. :)
---
I didn't even go after the mod because they nerfed campfire tales before I got one and since then it breaks half the time.
---
Then I was told all the mods have penalties to them so I just said meh
---
Yell? By no means. I've been nothing but cordial. I'm merely chuckling at the people who do complain about this game, yet continue to sink money into it. Entertaining indeed!
---
So much coal.   
---
I wonder if it‚Äôs because I keep shooting the random robots giving me prizes or insulting me...
---
It would be pretty cool if they added a new opening narration for Wastelanders.
---
oh ok. yeah that‚Äôs weird because being able to see items in the store would convert to more sales. wild
---
Nop. They don't.
---
They patched the pipe gun, but no the pipe revolver/bolt action.
---
Can't be that solid when it can be influenced by a simple cheating tool.
---
I saw that banner. Hopefully they add it!!
---
It may be rare, but it does happen occasionally.  
---
When I was a sub level 15, my first "real" camp was built by another player who "adopted me" for a few play sessions.
---
  Brick walls w/ windows, roof, windmill generator, couple of workbenches, some wall decorations, locked door, and a heavy turret to try and protect it all.
---
  Many levels later, I have been know do bestow large camp items once in a while....built a fusion generator for one, and workbenches for another.
---
===
---
That said, I'm OK with allowing team members to build,  Allowing them to destroy of anything they didn't place....nah, I'll pass on that one.
---
Dave Foley because i‚Äôm a big Kids in the Hall fan

Suit yourselves. I'll just keep using it, since it works.
---
No man, PC is the *best* platform to play 76 on, it's just the worst to enjoy it on.
---
Yeah I talked to him but he just says the same thing over and over :(
---
Or you could play Nuclear Winter that has a skill ceiling hundreds of times above Adventure Mode PvP.
---
Insulting? Can you please quote where I've actually insulted anyone? There was no ad hominem in this post. Or do you, perhaps, think that telling people that fire burns is an insult? In that case, I apologize for pointing out simple facts. Would you, mayhaps, like an explanation as to why it is unhealthy to play with fire?

This game is awesome. I'm loving it. You said I made my bed &amp; now I have to lay in it...well you got it half right...I bought my bed from the Atomic shop...haven't made it once though.
---
Yes this game has a truckload of issues. Player DO have every right to be upset/mad about the state the game is in. Are we partially to blame...maybe/probably. BUT one major thing you need to look at is this...do the negatives outweigh the positives? Clearly for you the answer is yes. But for thousands of other who play the game evetyday they still find more enjoyment in it than the issues surround it.

I get pissed every time I see a blue screen. I get mad every time a glitch occurs &amp; messes me up....But I LOVE the teamwork, I love the shared fun of doing events, I find great joy in the endless ways I can build a camp/base. I look forward to the future of this game. It is broken but it is far from shit. Tens of thousands of gamers find genuine joy &amp; fun inside the fucked up made up disaster of a world &amp; that's not gunna change anytime soon.
---
Yeah I read the poster in two different places and nothing starts :( I just got into this game after all the bad rep and this isn‚Äôt helping that a whole quest is bugged so I can‚Äôt even get the backpack
---
I'll send you a link to a earlier baseline version of my build before I started playing with Bloodied.
---
Or at least a fallout variation. 
---
However there will be arrows in Wastelanders.
---
Yeah! I‚Äôm bummed and you can‚Äôt even get that poster on the atom store either since I wanted to try that. And Bethesda has been no help
---
I don't know, but as of right this second I am no longer overweight; I'm a Waistlander.
---
People still got to keep all the rare items they spawned that are obtainable in-game. What a joke.
---
They already fixed that bug though
---
For a non bloodied sniper build, you hit all the important stuff. 
---
I would only make one recommendation here, drop Evasive and Mr Sandman and spread those points out between Gun Fu and Adrenaline.
---
As a sniper, stuff shouldnt get close, and since you are a full health build, you will be able to take a hit or 2 without worry, so evasive is redundant, and you can squeeze more damage out of the build with Gun Fu and Adrenaline
---
Ive tested both in a bloodied build, and dont use evasive anymore due to this.  Mr Sandman only works at night, and is awesome at night, but its 2 points that could be used elsewhere, the extra damage from adrenaline/GunFu will make up for it.
---
You did a great job - did you have any plushies to put around the tree?
---
They fixed some of them. For example one of the bugged challenges was "get X Strenght points". For me was impossible to get. No matter how many strenght points I had in my character, never seemed enough to complete it
---
Great, you just saved few hours of my life :D Thanks!
---
No shit but the original tent should be listed just as it was before selecting the christmas tent. Watch after the new year this tent will be unavailable to fo 1st members also.
---
"Go play a totally different game!" No I like PvP in adventure mode. NW has a huge aspect of where you spawn and what you find as well. I like using things I know I have
---
Thsy got rid of 4-5 star gear? Huh.
---
It was probably easy enough to write a script that automatically deleted gear with more than three stars, and just run that on everyone's inventory. Running a check for "illegal" legendary effects on types of items, like TSE Rolling Pins, is probably a bit more complicated. And if they ever get around to that, explosive energy weapons will most likely bite the dust.
---
I was able to complete that one as soon as the challenges were introduced. I was never able to get the frog jar one. Hopefully that one was fixed.
---
All the rare legendaries and recipes that were spawned were not removed though. Only things that were impossible to get normally were removed...
---
I wouldn't mind if you couldn't VATs other people at all, like in NW.
---
The point is that at this stage of developement, that bug shouldn't have happened in the first place. FO76 is almost two years old. And do you remember how that bug came to be in the first place? It was introduced while fixing another one.  
---
More importantly, those were two game breaking bugs, in under a single week. Take a step back and look at the sheer number of such bugs Bethesda introduced in the past year and then some. Such fickleness would be understandable coming from an early access project developed by a small indie team, sure.  
---
But what's the excuse of a AAA studio, still unable to figure out their own game after nearly two years of being in service? Let alone that they should know their engine much better, because that is even older than the game itself.  
---
At what point does incompetence stops being forgivable?
---
I appreciate that, my dude. I like that you took the time to understand my position instead of just disregarding it while saying your points. Good conversation. 
---
If you get a chance, check out TurdPartyCandidate's suggestion for teslas above. It's an interesting idea. I'm going to mull it over myself and may adopt it as my position.
---
bye felicia
---
Being more aggressive with Bans would help things as well.
---
I alwas run with the high capacity mod. +120 carry capacity is huge boost. And I play a stealth build, so for me the -60 energy and radiation resistance  penalty is not that bad
---
I followed him in the other day He's usually somewhere along the road but he passed by me just outside of Morgantown airport the other day.
---
He also likes to hang out in flatwoods inside the restaurant I'm not even sure he's random anymore. I wish they'd give him a chance to have the rare spawn vendors stuff it'd give him a point again.
---
A good player will make use of what they get as starting loot in the best possible manner. The TTK for all weapons is low enough, frankly. It is true that sometimes you get "shafted" in terms of loot, but even with weak loot you can get ahead if you know what you are doing. I have clips where I wipe squads at a spawn point with me having no armor and cycling through random trash weapons. It makes it more exhilarating if anything.
---
I've played it for hundreds of hours and it's been fine. Definitely not anywhere close to what you'd call 'broken.'
---
Explosives are bad for instigating snipers, as your first shot's AOE will remove your primary damage from any mobs caught in the explodive radius (ghoul mobs). Instigating with 50% crit may be better, and as non-bloody focusing on proccing crits is how you can still do serious damage.
---
This is **only** my opinion, but here's my recommendation based on my experience:
---
Drop strong back for one of the %weight reduction perks (traveling pharmacy), +20 extra weight is literally, not even enough to cover your handmade.
---
Drop perception to 13, and concentrated fire to 1‚òÜ, at 3, it only does like 4% extra damage over a single point. Use those points in luck to take crit perks.
---
Get rid of demo expert, 5‚òÜ only gives 12% extra explosive damage, 1‚òÜ isn't worth it.
---
I personally dislike the sandman perk, it's a waste of 2 points 50% of the time, and as a stealth rifleman, dmg is your best defense, drop evasive as well. Use those points to increase Adrenaline and Gun smith, these two perks will *significantly* increase your damage against subsequent mobs, can mean life/death against multiple mobs (vault raids, SBQ fights)
---
I'd recommend increasing luck as much as you can, it improves how fast your crit meter fills, as well as perks to increase crit damage (better crits, four leaf clover)
---
Stacking damage is how you start 1 shotting SB'S and mirelurk queens. And when you can proc a crit every other shot, even end game mobs drop fast.
---
Just remember B is always bloodied, berserkers gets typed out completely lol...
---
And did you talk with the bot at the Pioneer Scout in the Toxic Valley? Hopefully you can start the quest by doing it that way
---
Ah, a good argument. A valuable one. Unlike most here, you're actually willing to have a critical look and acknowledge problems when you see them. I appreciate and greatly respect your earnest and honest response.  
---
However, I'd like to ask you one simple question ... What positives does FO76 have, which no other game has? Teamwork, Events, even base building, all of this is done much, much better by a plethora of other games, with fewer bugs and a much more stable experience.  
---
Why settle on a mediocre game for it's positives, if you could get those same positives out of a decent one, while sidestepping the negatives, too?
---
You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be able to track who spawned in items easily, but should they ban anyone who touched any spawned in items? I‚Äôm sure things got spread around, and I‚Äôm sure people went into dev room containers they found in camps. They‚Äôd have to ban a lot of people if you want them to be aggressive and a lot of those banned people may not deserve it
---
They don't tweet often, so another option would be following Fallout on Twitter, and getting tweet notifications. You won't be notified if they reply to another one, just a regular standalone tweet, and they're on the ball when it comes to giving a heads up, when it actually does go down, and when it pops back up
---
So because you haven't experienced any issues (which I highly doubt anyway) that means that no one is experiencing issues?
---
Veronica Cartwright.
---
Does anyone here remember when the map read ‚ÄúSheepsqatch Horde Event,‚Äù but was actually a ghoul horde? Yeah that was a mistake. So is this. Notice how it doesn‚Äôt have any stars next to it? You give Bugthesda too much credit if you think this was done by a hacker.
---
Oh! Can‚Äôt wait!
---
Either 0% or 100% like everything
---
Drop strong back, you're better off with a weight reduction perk for ammo or chems or pretty much anything else.
---
Aquaboy is kind of a waste, you can equip it as needed instead of wearing it all the time.  Sun kissed will be useless (or nearly) when you're bigger and have the radiation scrubber arch thingy (whatever it's called).  Fireproof is OK at times, I run that and a couple points in radiation resistance when I'm doing scorchbeasts, but other times you'd be better off with ironclad.
---
4 in Lone wanderer is a bit much, but it's not bad.  Get a few spare cards in charisma when you're bigger, and swap things around as needed (field surgeon is nice, travel agent and hard bargain are useful too, as needed).
---
Demo expert is a waste.  Drop that point, or drop that perk and get something like first aid (if needed).
---
IMO, 3 points in sneak is too much, but that's debatable.  Evasive is not great, you shouldn't be getting hit that much.  Mister sandman is situational, only use that when needed.  I'd run some points in Action Boy unless you decide to build a commando (more on that later) with a 0 AP use gun.
---
You *could* run 2 points in class freak, or even 1, if depending on what mutation you use.  That's up to you though.  You could consider a few options in luck depending on how much you depend on VATS, and swap around as appropriate (four leaf clover, grim reaper's sprint, critical savvy, and better criticals all have their uses in certain circumstances).
---
IMO, use rifleman to get you leveled up, but consider swapping to commando once you have a bunch of perks banked (probably *well* past level 50).  Keep an eye out for nice handmades/fixers/combat rifles as you're gaining levels, and think about swapping over.  Bloodied (or junkie's if you don't want to go low health, instigating as a distant 3rd choice) with a decent 2nd stat, and (importantly) -25% AP cost for the 3rd.  It's a game changer, but only when you are well kitted out.
---
This comment was so well constructed and argumented that I am speechless. Do, praytell, good sir, what is your secret?
---
They removed every 4 and 5 star and the unobtainable stuff.
---
Because it‚Äôs a waste of hard to obtain flux imo. I sell mine for 300 if I do put them in vendor but I sell for 100 each to friends who are buying just a few for actual use
---
Would wait personally
---
I built a platform under the living room and glitch it out through the floor. The foliage starts right at floor level. I am happy.
---
I've played enough hours to do be able to make a pretty assessment that the game isn't 'broken'.
---
And forgot to say that you can actually get a [small backpack](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Small_backpack) without need to do the Scout quest. The bad thing about that one is that it has less carrying capacity and you can't mod it or add a skin from the Atomic Shop.
---
That one was bugged for me too
---
So yes then. Got it.
---
&gt;they didn‚Äôt get rid of the stuff that had unobtainable legendary effects
---
Easy to do, look for that when they have a little spare time.
---
That's the issue, if you put the fear in people in the first place "innocent" bystanders wouldn't have helped themselves to any hacked in content if they ran across it.
---
If they deleted all duped items a lot of people would lose a lot of stuff. It's also hard to know which items are legit anymore unless you got it from a drop yourself. For people that do a lot of trading and vendor hopping like myself we have no way of knowing.
---
Definitely read this as "Scot" instead of "Scout". All I could think was "Is there some Scottish obsession with possums that I don't know about?"
---
I watched Friday.
---
What is yours?  Did you get touched in the no no spot as a child?
---
If you can not see how this is insulting then i dont think you are capable of having a well thought, intellegent, and mature discussion/debate which is unfortunate.
---
But as i said, you do you. Hopefully eventually you can find enjoyment in something past hating on a game and flaming its player base. Gl.
---
&gt;t close, and since you are a full health build, you will be able to take a hit or 2 without worry, so evasive is redundant, and you can squeeze more damage out of the build with Gun Fu and Adrenaline  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Ive tested both in a bloodied build, and dont use evasive anymore due to this.  Mr Sandman only works at night, and is awesome at night, but its 2 points that could be used elsewhere, the extra damage from adrenaline/GunFu will make up for it.
---
That is good to know! Dropping evasive and Mr. Sandman gets me 5 open points to play with. As far as the gun-fu/adrenaline split, would you go 2/5 or 3/4?
---
Wow, you actually found five deathclaw hides? I'm level 68 and have found exactly two of them.
---
I would wait until Wastelanders when most of the current bugs have been fixed and then see if you are still interested.
---
If you have other people to play the game with you then yes, if your going in alone then no
---
I can confirm/support this statement, I got this plan on my level 10 Shotgunner alt, a few days ago. Went to transfer it to my main and "learned" it by accident. At least ONE of my characters knows it!
---
I would max Gun Fu, 3/4
---
Data mining-no, experimental proof in video 1
---
Not really, no.
---
Yes it does stack
---
I get 5k sneak shots on my raider that‚Äôs built for pipe rifles. Hit the queen for about 460 each shot.
---
Very impressive my friend üëç
---
Its a perk in AGI, but you'll need 9 Agility to equip it, and it costs 10 overseer tickets to buy.
---
If you look at the trees in the build menu there are some decorated ones so maybe they come next week?
---
Oh, most impressive! So much ad-hominem, so much meaningful debate and discussion! Good sir, I am in awe! Your ability to hold a courteous and gentlemanly conversation is truly peerless!
---
I personally use only one point in Gun Fu just to unlock the auto target swap. I put the rest of the points into Adrenaline. The reasoning is that you only get the bonus dmg from Gun Fu while you are in VATS, while the Adrenaline bonus last for 30 sec and refreshes every kill.
---
I preordered it and I regret it. I‚Äôd like a refund. Fuck this greedy ass company and their game.
---
You cannot nuke Vault 76 (it is a safe zone alongside flatwoods).
---
I fell in love with Deacon in FO4 and Ryan Alosio seems like a really nice person so I'd be very happy if he made an appearance!
---
Mark Robers a proper lad
---
I can run the first raid on standard by myself (stealth commando build) and have completed on expert with a team many times. The second raid is a good bit tougher and the 3rd isnt too bad. I'm confident that could prly get ya through standard if not, my team sometimes does need a fourth. Shoot me a request n we'll try to work something out! RECTUM42629
---
I‚Äôm on most days after work (around 3-4 PST) and can be up as late as midnight before I need to catch some Z‚Äôs for work. Monday‚Äôs and Tuesday‚Äôs are my days off.
---
If it‚Äôs easy to do, why didn‚Äôt they do it when they did the maintenance? They fixed the exploit and got rid of 4 and 5 stars, but couldn‚Äôt find the time to also get rid of the weapons with the unobtainable prefixes?
---
It's a good game but Wastelanders is right around the corner.  It's a fun game especially with friends but not sure if the current content would last you til Wastelanders comes out.
---
You genuinely can't play the game because it's broken? Have you tried to reinstalling it? Could be a hardware error.
---
Alone or in a group, the game is fulfilling. 
---
After more than 1000 hours in game, I keep coming back because the fun is endless, and I find new things about once a week. 
---
If you like the fallout universe, and you are ok with a few minor bugs (nothing game braking, those usually get fixed super fast) then its worth it.
---
A lot of people will tell you to wait till wastelanders releases, these are usually people who have been playing a long time and have exhausted gameplay options.   Why wait.  The wasteland awaits. 
---
There is plenty to do until the new expansion comes out, especially if you are a new player.  Even for veterans, there are still things to do, places to visit, secrets to find.
---
Yeah finally, since it came out i got more rewards from santa scorched than the bot itself. And with that i mean the bot never gave anything
---
Sure. I can do that after I get home from work.
---
the thought of taking an arrow to the knee almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter ;)
---
That's an excellent point regarding the explosive prefix vs the mob.  Will consider that.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs what ‚Äúnot obtainable in-game‚Äù means. Market is still ruined and RWTs all jumped on this exploit to fill their stock.
---
Idk most people don't even realize bos gives ultracite power armor and its plans yet either though.
---
Probably their way of getting even with the pocketed glitchers
---
That's what you get keeping that watch up your ass for 5 years /nod
---
 Danny Shorago please ‚ô•
---
I skimmed through the video it‚Äôs a little long. This is a pvp build right?
---
So ... Let me re-iterate. If you purposefully take a knife to your throat and stab yourself, and then I tell you that maybe stabbing yourself isn't the brightest idea ... It is an insult? Pointing out the truth, is an insult?  
---
As said, could you actually quote me attacking or otherwise insulting anyone? The only thing I said is:  
---
"If you pay for a broken game, then complain that it is broken, yet continue paying for it, then you deserve exactly what you paid for". What part of it is an insult?
---
We agree there most definitely.
---
No I have a level 230 with fullest of heavy uny combat armor and a few of best weapons in game and I'm still not seeing it
---
Deacon was a good bean. I loved playing thru a second time and noticing him everywhere spying on me.
---
Thats all I do. I tend to select flatwoods cause theres more hiding spots.
---
Another thing do the tiers drop daily like yesterday was for the wreath, today for the wrapped presants, tomorrow for the holiday tre, etc?
---
as a rifles build, he is crazy to not use vats.  Rifles thrive on vats.
---
Gun Fu is a much larger increase to damage. 
---
I used to only use Gun Fu 1.   Then I tried 3 and the difference is crazy noticable.   With Gun Fu 1 your uptime is 50%, with Gun fu 3, your uptime is 75%
---
Although I do agree with you on the pouring money into something your just gonna bitch about, could not see myself doing that either
---
it may surprise you but some people with the hearing skill unlocked can pick up the voices of actors and remember them and like them and enjoy hearing them again in future projects. there might even be dozens of us.
---
I'd drop strong back for something like traveling pharmacy or bandolier.
---
And better rewards or exp. I dont do the raids cause the feel like a waste of materials.
---
Yeah in the extremely rare case of Mysterious Savior working, it's better... I have it fully ranked up, but I'd say 90% of the time he shows up, it's after I'm already on the respawn screen... Indoors is the worst. I can only think of one time that it worked in an interior location.
---
Its not the downloading its the copying. The CPU inside the PS4 sucks for file operations.
---
Then, here you go: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0tMArV58GQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0tMArV58GQ)  
---
You might only be an occasional player then. If you do play once a week, you're bound to miss a few SNAFUs every now and then. But please remember, if you do not see something, it does not mean it is not there.
---
Because both of the trained code monkeys were busy with other things.
---
Seriously though, they're understaffed, and can only do so much at one time.  You triage, tackle the worst things, and get to the 'less worst' things later on.
---
Also seriously, it's not at all hard to put together a filter to flag a couple combinations of item variable values and act on that info (whether it's flagging some specific item ID numbers for deletion, or flagging the account with them for deletion).  HOW they act is a question, but getting to the point where they make that decision is very simple from a data standpoint.
---
Not even a shit post.  
---
I‚Äôve been a fallout fan since troika made this game and I‚Äôve never encountered a particular ‚Äúvoice‚Äù in game that left an impression on me. 
---
I see what your saying but I never really expected anyone to have a favorite or anything- they all just seemed unexceptional to me.
---
How do you get it?! And yes I talked to the bot and nothing happens
---
Angry turtle, indeed lolol
---
The first part is familiarity...I love the Fallout worlds. I have always loved Bethesda's way of having a player "Discover" a location &amp; it pop up on the map. On top of that they make fun exiting worlds. You didn't know what you'd discover over the next hill or in the next building. The Devs have always done a great job with littering their world with cool Easter eggs. Something I don't always find in other worlds.
---
Teamwork is important but not necessary. I'm my opinion they make it simple in this game to understand &amp; get use too. As far as survival games go I enjoy it far better than games like Ark or Conan Excile. This again is partially because I'm use to the surroundings. 
---
Building camps bases. When playing games like Ark or Conan I found it an extreme chore &amp; tedious...in 76 it feels less so. I pick up scrap &amp; building material AS I'm doing other things do it feels less forced. 
---
The Atom shop. It gets a lot of heat &amp; I agree with many that a lot of the stuff is over priced...but...I thoroughly enjoy knowing that new things are always coming. I like that they at least give up ways to earn Atoms..though that to I think could be increased but I also understand that employees need to get paid, planning &amp; creation cost money &amp; one of the biggest reason the Wastelanders DLC will be free is because of the Atom shop purchases. 
---
I could go on but I'm pretty sure this is akready fairly long. in short though, even with all the bugs &amp; issues I did enjoy most of the Quests, the discovery, the plethora of upgrade choices &amp; character customization this game offers.
---
If you're only doing combat in PA, just stick with underarmor... I'd recommend a shielded Brotherhood Uniform... Otherwise, grind for a Weightless armor set.
---
Sounds like a story from the squeaker squad
---
So if you're looking to drop the most hurt on a single target, you use VATS, target the head, and select a crit?  That's  . . . less fun than doing it manually, but I suppose there is still some skill in the positioning.
---
Welcome to being a year late to this complaint.
---
25% less or more than the value? I usually don't pay mind to the value because some items are rare but yet say they are worth like 20-150 caps. But it all depends. Like maps, I usually sell at about 65-75ish, most plans I get from events and stuff I sell cheap. Like those power armor plans from the queen I usually sell at about 70-100 because they are so common usually people don't buy it them or they buy them thinking they can resell. Traveling around the vendors will get you a good range. People sell too low or too high. I usually buy out those who sell low. And resell at a medium range of prices to least make money back. Also remember that Bethesda takes I think 5% of every vending transaction. It's something low but I hate it either way
---
Back in the day was really hard to get them. Don't ask me why, but originally Deathclaws couldn't drop... Deathclaw hides. Yes, doesn't make any sense, I know.
---
Thanks God they added Deathclaw hides to Deathclaws loot pool with a patch. Since then you can find Deathclaw hides in Deathclaws corpses very easily.
---
If you wanna find some I recommend you to go to the Fissure site Prime. You can find a bunch of dead Deathclaws around the biggest Fissure. Or you can just farm some locations with Deathclaw spawns, like Deathclaw Island, Hopewell cave, Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02, Emmett Mountain Disposal Site or Sam Blackwell's Bunker
---
Leave in the "pooping" part tho it's funny cuz you're angry turtle
---
Oh no you're all good I just saw a post on how to get that plan fast though so I'm going to have to do that. (Lvl 4 character and give them all your presents since alot of the items are locked at levels)
---
I just went to playing The Outer Worlds.
---
I paid 80 bucks (IIRC) for the Tricentennial Edition.  I have just over 500 hours in the game.  That's roughly 16 cents per hour of entertainment, which I consider pretty damn good by any standard.
---
Yes, there are bugs but they aren't nearly as bad as The Internet‚Ñ¢ makes them out to be.
---
I have lots of games, but I keep coming back to this one because I enjoy it.  Looking for plans, collecting outfits, finding interesting stories told by the environment.  It's worth playing if you like Fallout, and Wastelanders will just make it all the better.
---
Thanks!
---
Can we get  three dog as an AI DJ?
---
Ah, I forgot about all that honestly. Well, it's good that no one's had any lately and I haven't been on too much in the last month! Lol
---
Well damn... there goes my plans.
---
Maybe I'll drop a nuke on rose instead, she is very infuriating. I know it wont kill her but it will be a personal victory
---
Let me clarify. These drop like hot cakes from scotch beasts... when you learn the plan they are no longer in the loot pool. For holiday packages this rule is ignored and all plans are in the loot table
---
No... Dumb..
---
Just any of the narrators from any of the fallout games especially the NV one
---
I work as well during the day and I'm on CST USA. How i/we usually do it with new raid(ers) is we'll run ya through novice a couple times just so u can learn all the pipes and get a good routine and strategy down, then we'll work our way up to standard and hopefully expert. Running with a team, your cards mean a world of difference, exterminator, blocker, evasive, escape artist, first aid, at least one team medic, radicool, (rad sponge-depending on everyone's build) all are really useful. Solo is a whole other world, basically need any and all sneak capabilities!
---
B is normally for Bloody - AA is anti armor - E is for explosive  etc
---
shit, well thanks for clarifying, I thought it was the other way around
---
This is the reply I hopped in to give. The game is fun but you run out of things to do after a while. Having a group to make your own fun with extends the play time dramatically.
---
Maybe you need to be X level in order to start the quest? I really don't know, I've never had that problem before.
---
You can find the plan for the small backpack at the [Morgantown Airport terminal](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Morgantown_Airport_terminal).  It's inside the [overseer's cache](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_cache), near the end.
---
Do you have red dead 2
---
Yeah, that's about it. Using VATS os the only way to get an actual crit, but when you stack enough dmg, you can do thousands of dmg per hit. You won't need to use it all the time, but it's useful when you do.
---
I don't really use VATS anymore on my main, but I also run a bloodied rifleman, so don't need the extra dmg. The only time I still use it, is to cripple wings on SB's.
---
Usually I do this with one friend that is high health super tanky and he runs around grabbing the pylons while I stalk the Sheepsquash. I heard players have solod it with junkie builds. It is a good idea to either bring friends you know can take a lot of dmg and have at least one person that can output a lot of dmg. Fireproof is a good perk for this event.
---
What a waste of development time and effort
---
I have two toxic waters. Am I potentially rich?
---
I‚Äôm a heavy gunner in PA as well as slight commando. TSE .50 cal and an AAE Handmade. But for the sake of sticking to one, my PER cards can be swapped for exterminator, glow sights, etc. I‚Äôd love to meet your team. Sounds like a good chance for me to meet new people while also getting me closer to my strangler heart PA!
---
I wish we had mods, I find the noise chameleon armor makes too annoying for me to use it.
---
Lock them if your a Scrooge
---
Love it. Thanks for sharing!
---
Don't forget AI xp. You can add 100+ xp per game easily, by hunting AI around the rim of the fire.
---
This can't be any more correct
---
Nice.
---
Problem is when I jump in power armor about to head to scorched earth with the normal backpack and the sad hitchhiking music starts. 
---
That killed it for me
---
Wow downvoted for having an idea. Nice. Clearly there are a lot of haters of The Stadia in this sub. Very sad to see.
---
Absolutely should using VATS, not saying he shouldn't, but the bonus dmg only lasts while your in VATS when you auto swap to a 2nd target, then a 3rd, then a 4th(Max 30%). As soon as you run out of AP or the target you are focusing on runs between wall or a column and VATS auto exits your out of the bonus dmg from Gun Fu.
---
Other than bug fixes, what is wastelanders?
---
Can you explain how bloodied works with ranged damage? I didn't think ranged damage scaled with SPECIAL increases, so what is it about bloodied builds that causes more damage?
---
Using a new 3rd party software that would let you spawn anything into the game that is in the 76 game files. Including stuff from fallout 4.
---
 Your not implying that u use stadia right? Hopefully your also not implying that u would happily pay another 60 dollars to stadia especially for shit like fallout 76.
---
Lock8ngbisnt good enough, someone will pick the lock and plunder your gifts. 
---
Better to put your sent a from on a single concrete foundation and then close it in with four walls. Swap out one wall when you collect.
---
also considering. Though Rockstar is going into its own controversies, but not as deep shit as Bethesda is in.
---
Oh sweet man! Thanks! ;P
---
Yes, I need a *basic* metal picnic table plan...
---
The Stadia is my exclusive gaming console now. I had an Xbox One X but I sold it after seeing how well The Stadia works. People hate on it but the technology is really amazing. Unfortunately I got bit pretty hard yesterday when Borderlands 3 came out and it runs at 30fps instead of a silky smooth 4k60fps like we were promised. But FO76 would be amazing on this platform!
---
I'm using healing factor, adrenal reaction, chameleon, and marsupial.
---
So question, do you used the hacked stuff and do you semi-side with hackers?
---
I took your advice. an came up with this build. [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQLAQULCgcBAQEAJk8DQAXwAQN7Az8DfAMNA9ABAqUBA/EBA7ABA4gBA3EDqgECUQM2AlkDuwED1QEDAA==](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQLAQULCgcBAQEAJk8DQAXwAQN7Az8DfAMNA9ABAqUBA/EBA7ABA4gBA3EDqgECUQM2AlkDuwED1QEDAA==)
---
Same here. 350 is a good price, and I'll happily lower that if someone asks. If they bring their own materials it's absurdly cheap.
---
Well that's one way to get single player F76 ü§£
---
Got lucky once and a guy was selling serums for 50c wish I bought alot more would‚Äôve made bank.
---
Unfortunately your in the minority here. I see your point but remember that games need difficulty. Without a challenge, what are you conquering? It's like playing through all the fallouts in full godmode
---
Damn thing is massie
---
At least in red dead you can earn your online currency by playing the game and not just get pay walled like Bethesda.
---
I got the plasma grenade on my level 150 alt. It's not level locked, none of them are. 
---
I've gotten every plan on the list but the tomahawk, on two characters, one 150, one 234.
---
If you head over to the IMDB page for 76 you can get an idea on who will be involved. I was very happy to see Peter Jessop listed, but it‚Äôs not confirmed what voice he‚Äôs doing or if it‚Äôs even for Wastelanders.
---
So that means the Prydwen is the F76 files?  Wtf!?!
---
I am not talking about their other products. If a business has a service that is unprofitable, they kill it. You don‚Äôt keep a service running because you are making money with other products. That‚Äôs just bad for the bottom lime. 
---
I want to know how it turns or because I want to know where you donate my $50.
---
I think this question is asked at least 10 times a week and literally no one who asks must no how to search Reddit or use Google which will literally bring up dozens of Reddit posts asking this same question...
---
What they did last time was simply delete all but one of each identical weapon/armor in peoples' inventories. So dupers with stacks of TSE Gatling Plasmas, etc. got knocked down to just one, but if you only had one to begin with you'd be fine.
---
That seems to be the consensus.  I probably will only carry a few stimpacks for emergencies (I have the healing factor mutation).  Ammo is so light I figured I'd have to carry thousands of rounds before I got to 20 pounds.  How much ammo are you guys carrying?
---
My first icicle plan was from a small gift, just lower chances of getting them, but not excluded entirely.
---
There's a separate tab for Fallout 1st that only appears if you're actively subbed.
---
A year's worth of research to find something you can sneak past server side checks to write 700 lines of C to hook game functions to finally actually be able to do a hack worthwhile isn't "a simple cheating tool and a couple of scripts".
---
We both know you don't know what you're talking about, I don't know who you're trying to fool.  Look, I hate the game too, my hatred just isn't irrational and I'm not shitting it all over the place where it doesn't belong.
---
Yeah that's ridiculously dumb, why wouldn't they want to show the new stuff on sale? Thought that was the point of adding the F1st section to the store. I think it would get them more subscriptions
---
I just got my plasma grenade plans last night after blowing all my caps on medium and large gift wraps last night!
---
I was level 11 at the time, I saw this player had all their serums at 200c. I barely had 50c at the time so I went on this huge spree to scrounge up enough caps to buy the serum. When I got back, They we‚Äôre gone... ;(
---
Agreed, I picked it up recently for the atoms and it popped up for me.

Put him on a concrete foundation with 4 walls and a roof
---
Alright thank you, didn't pay attention to last column ..
---
.......you can earn atoms in game, by just playing.
---
Im really hoping we get companions
---
FYI, adrenal reaction only works at low health, so kind of mostly pointless unless you're bloodied.  Not a huge problem, you lose 50 health, but that's manageable.  And chameleon is mostly worthless without the proper armor.
---
You'll get more later, at that point evaluate if a 50% reduction in the bad effects is worth freeing up the point.  It's a small difference probably, so personal choice.  And you'll probably run more mutations later, so decide later.
---
I have never tried to min/max mine, but I run chameleon (accidentally), eagle eyes, grounded, healing factor, herbivore, marsupial, scaly skin, and speed demon.  Probably should be running bird bones, but I'm a hoarder and I can't imagine dealing with any more -str (though I should).
---
If I can set permission sure, especially if I can let no one build at my base.
---
Where is it the small backpack?
---
Almost all of 76 is ported over stuff from 4 so that didnt surprise me
---
This you are 100% correct on.  I used to be part of an achievement site for gaming.  Won't mention the name, not worth promoting, point is, this site was proclaiming/advertising to be about legitimacy.  However, the blatant cheating promoted and deemed acceptable in a lot of cases involving various games was just a joke.  And when I confronted them on an example of which most sane people would consider blatant cheating, I was just ignored basically.  
---
I'll give an example, some guy, who admitted to being a  programmer had found a way to use a certain game controller (which specifically was made for players with disabilities), he programmed this device to actually slow down the game, essentially dropping the frame rate of the game, because he just wasn't good enough to get an achievement (Geometry Wars - Score 1 Million Achievement, whatever it's called.)  
---
Anyway, he'd slow down the game to a snail pace just so he could "legitimately" obtain this.  And the site that supposedly promotes fair play saw nothing wrong with this.  This was considered not cheating- because "technically" he's not manipulating the actual software (hacking into the game files, changing settings etc.), however since he used a peripheral which he programmed that achieved the same desired effect - manipulating the software, this was somehow considered ok.  SMH.  I left that dumb site, I cringe every single time I see someone promote it.  Honest players are a rare species these days.
---
The effort need to port this game to a platform which has essentially been received as dead on arrival would be a poor investment for Bethesda.  Stadia is, regardless of it's potential, incapable of delivering upon it's promises.  Coupled with the fact it's actually more expensive to buy games for Stadia than for consoles or PC, it's essentially a failure at launch.  I just don't see Bethesda hitching their cart to that dead horse.
---
I imagine that is a much harder problem to correct without also harming the innocent.
---
I carry way too much ammo and chems mostly because I am lazy and forgetful. I personally am not a fan of Healing Factor as it reduces the effects of chems. When I fight the sbq I'm popping chems like it's a Hollywood party. I'd probably go with bandolier just so you can loot and sell all the ammo. 
---
Also another option is a backup shotgun for crippling things if you do get ambushed. Even without perks a decent shotgun in vats is pretty deadly against most mobs.
---
Setting yourself up for disappointment I see.
---
Just give me the goddamn one in Whitesprings
---
200 is fair especially since it seems like everyone is selling them anymore.
---
Companions are confirmed but not in the open world.
---
Yeah ain't no way stadia can run fallout 76 with multiplayer
---
Oh really? I didnt know that lol
---
Here's how I did something similar a couple of weeks ago:
---
- Copy (not move) your game files to their new location on the SSD. 
---
- Rename the NEW folder a little different (Fallout76 --&gt; Falluot76NEW or something)
---
- Rename the OLD file folder a little (Fallout76 --&gt; Fallout76old or something)
---
Probably wouldn't hurt to restart your computer at this point. You probably don't have to. I did.
---
- Launch Bethesda game launcher. It'll probably still say 'Play' on the big teal button. Click Play and it will scan and repair your Fallout 76 folder. Let it run for about 5 seconds then abort the procedure. It will have created a new folder and maybe a few new files.
---
- Close Bethesda Game Launcher. Make sure it's not running in the background either.
---
- MOVE the files from Fallout76NEW to the Fallout76 folder in the Bethesda game launcher. REPLACE and files or folders Beth has downloaded already.
---
- Re-launch Bethesda Game launcher. The Game should be in a playable state right out of the box but you can launch Scan and Repair to make sure.
---
- Once you've verified the game is playable you can delete your OLD game files
---
A variant of this you might want to consider is re-downloading the Bethesda launcher onto your new SSD first, launching it, setting it up, downloading 76 for about 5 seconds, closing the launcher (possibly restarting your PC) and THEN moving the OLD 76 files into the NEW 76 folder, restarting the Bethesda launcher and then verifying your files. (I didn't have to do that step because my BGS launcher was already on a teeny tiny 128GB HDD I had that's almost solely Windows and a handful of critical apps.)
---
Not a good amount do you work for Bethesda
---
You get the decorated ones with the aluminium one.
---
these are the ones I did in a day
---
I was thinking about something like that. I'd like to have him further away from my base as I am not a fan of the santatron voice.
---
They will mainly chill at your camp to give you quests and can only join you on specific quests in instanced areas
---
Oh ok, thats cool tho. Itd be nice to see npcs roaming my camp
---
They've actually talked about companions a fair bit in interviews, but they said they'll mostly hang out at your camp except for during certain quests and not follow you around like in past games.  They'll apparently be romanceable as well.
---
Stadia is like Googles pathetic effort to be the first streaming service available. Nothing about it is reliable or consumer friendly.
---
lol
---
It would just be Dog, or maybe One Dog.
---
Even if it could, since the game isnt crossplay, there would have to be an active player base specific to Stadia.  I don't see that going well.
---
prob means the aluminum are the tree's we'll get
---
In my experience it works great -- no lag, no discernible latency, easy to switch from one screen to another, etc. Of course it's all internet-dependent. But the one thing they really need is more great games. That's where FO76 comes in! Trust me if they get more GREAT games they will be able to succeed, I think, as long as they do not LIE to me again about resolution and framerate stuff like they did with Borderlands 3.
---
Oh, that wasn‚Äôt clear in the Atom shop pictures
---
Did somebody say private world santa farming? ...oh ouch that's pretty op
---
Wastelanders is the release of NPCs to the game, there's hints of factions such as settlers and raiders - there's not too much information just yet but it should be coming out in the next month or two - it was supposed to come out already but got pushed back for bug fixes etc.
---
Based on that description, I'm guessing they won't be combat buddies, but just some kind of service provider that lives at your camp and offers a benefit for keeping around. And I bet their solution to "what if two players in the same world have the same companion?" is to just have them be instanced, and be invisible to any strangers that visit your camp.
---
I bought them and didn‚Äôt realise till after I‚Äôd placed one. The decorated ones do look nice.
---
Hey man! Don‚Äôt kill our fun! ;(
---
SPECIALS don't affect dmg, just VATS hit chance and AP pool. It's not just the bloodied prefix, it's the stacking with the Nerd Rage perk, and the Adrenal Reaction mutation that gives the OP boosts. At &lt;20% health (50~ health or so), you get an 80% increase from bloodied, 20% increase from Nerd Rage, and a 60% increase from Adrenal, that all stack consecutively. You can have 400-800  per shot base damage, depending on the rifle. 
---
These also stack with the crit/sneak bonuses, so you can get shots that do 4k-8k dmg. I don't bother with VATS anymore, and switch between rifleman/commando, depending on how I want to play. My build is **much** more utilitarian than it used to be, and has more QOL perks, instead of solely dmg. 
---
I would recommend trying running around at &lt;20% health, before investing in full bloodied/low health gear. Rage and Adrenal works with any weapon, and it takes some getting used to.
---
Activate it until it sounds sad, (like an awwww) sound. It does shut off.
---
Youre awesome!
---
Hopefully not lol
---
Instead of nukashine, we can smoke blunts
---
Just delete the electrical wire, then reattach it.
---
I can definitely agree with this since I've been playing since beta I just worry that some people will get bored once they blow thru the main quest which is why I suggest waiting for Wastelanders. Some people in this sub don't seem to be into anything other than the quests and don't take the time to find things to do without a quest holding their hand. But you're absolutely right - there's always things to do. Even more so when you bring your friends into the mix.
---
Well, maybe I‚Äôll need to grind up some more atoms then....
---
Thank you random citizen. I‚Äôd like to join, but I‚Äôm on PS4. Good luck with your Christmas giveaway. *thumbs up*
---
Go through until you find a crack in the wall to the left of the terminal locked double doors.  
---
Grab the keycard  in the dead guys hand and go through the double doors and the push button door.  That'll lead you to the area with the metal detector, go past that and to the back where there is a Responders sigil painted on the wall.  To the left of the dead girl responder is a cache with the plan in it
---
Rad weed, -2 all SPECIAL attributes, increases hunger and thirst.
---
Food build food build food build
---
Counter suggestion: Fix the game first, deliver content, update anticheat measures and ban cheaters.
---
There‚Äôs always a reason to grind more Atoms.
---
Dude it would be -2 to all SPECIAL except Charisma which would be +10. ü§ó
---
No it is not.  Low level characters will not have prime or power armor plans drop, giving them better odds at the rest.  Yes, its rng, only with a smaller pool to choose from.  There are probably others that a low level cannot get like the grog axe and ultracite laser, but for the plasma stuff it definitely increases the odds..
---
And you KNOW that are cheating how? I've been playing for over a year and haven't found a good weapon yet. Bad luck on my part so yeah, if someone is selling it for $10 on eBay or whatever yeah I'll buy it.
---
they would also break what little economy we have as gold generators are game killers.
---
The only people I wouldn't recommend this game to are people who are always looking for something to complain about.
---
i had the same reaction when i seen my first scortchbeast at level 15 lol
---
\*looks down at level 10 pipe pistol, aiight imma head out\*
---
And a 5 second delay using weapons.
---
Just couldn't let him be excited could ya?  Smh
---
I'll do the same :p got enough rare plans so I could trade for a legacy finally :)
---
I don't get how people can do that I get already overwhelmed my defend events if I have like three workshops. If I would take them all. O.O
---
I usually have my powered turrets on a hidden switch - just turning the power off and then back on works as well.
---
I hate you....lol....jk....but seriously i have played all the fallout games and i don't think I ever got a PIE....still hoping I will get one in the future
---
It‚Äôs all RNG. Congrats on your first!! Hope you bought a lottery ticket too!  Ha ha
---
Same for all the teddy bear scenes but we love those
---
I can, and I am. How am I stopping anybody?
---
They aren‚Äôt worth my time as a super high level player except for the occasional challenge to earn atoms. I can farm to things I need faster and have fun doing it.
---
I see - thanks for the detailed explanation!
---
Yeah, as the guy said above. FO76 is running FO4 as a base for the game. Bethesda just didn‚Äôt bother taking the cording out for the fallout 4 stuff.
---
I‚Äôd like to think that it means that they will introduce some of the fallout 4 content, rather then just being lazy lol
---
Yeah. I've learned its better to not be excited and be surprised, than getting excited and then be disappointed :P
---
That was good!
---
100% if you go to West Tek, and get it off the roof. 
---
If you want to do it the long way however....
---
The perfectly preserved pie can be obtained from any¬†Port-A-Diner, with a small chance of dispensing. Obtaining the pie on any particular attempt is determined by the formula...
---
chance=(luck√ó4)+attempts20chance=(luck√ó4)+attempts20...where...chancethe percentage chance of obtaining the pieluckthe¬†Resident's¬†Luckattemptsthe number of previous attempts made to obtain the pie
---
...thus, even with a Luck of 10, there is still only a 2% chance of obtaining the pie on the first attempt.
---
By cumulative probabilities, a player character with Luck 5 has a 50% chance of obtaining the pie within the first 36 attempts. Luck 10 reduces that to 26 attempts, while Luck 1 doesn't reach those odds until 49 attempts.
---
Depending on the player character's Luck, it takes between 75 and 105 attempts to reach a 95% chance of getting the pie, and 109 to 140 attempts to reach a 99.5% chance of getting the pie. In any case it should not take anywhere near 2000 attempts.
---
 
---
According to the Fallout wiki.
---
Oh great I was wondering why I had him if he never found anything üòÄ
---
Played fallout 4 for an ungodly amount of hours, and I never got one , almost a week into FO76 and first machine I try it I get one...Thanks Fallout gods!
---
Cut him a break. That's where the scorchbass queen spawns.
---
I was a vault dweller like you until I took a pip boy in the knee
---
Stadia being released in its state is sad in itself.
---
The guard in Morrowind who always told me to "keep moving"
---
I don't know. All I know is that I am jealous of you.
---
I'm gonna go take out that emotion on the next body of water I see.
---
Like Ceasar.
---
The Italian one.
---
I posted info above, but for ease of finding it, just watch her video.  Hope that helps!

---
Lets port fo76 so OP can be the only player in a multiplayer game.  Lol.
---
Danny Shorago and Stephen Russell not exactly classic but definitely hoping for them to voice in it because of how much time I spent with them in 4.
---
Any corrupt character has the chance to walk right past the world boundaries. Im on xbox and I can confirm it happens to my characters at random times. Still cant figure out how to trigger it, but I test to see everytime I login.
---
Funny enough i think Wasteland 3 coming out next year is set there.
---
 Btw the wasteland games have a pretty wild rl history in gaming and very close ties to fallout.
---
It says it‚Äôs in a plan called ‚Äòend tables‚Äô
---
Yeah, I spend 30K also on plans, mainly because I can't play for the next 2 weeks so I only got like a week of the event while everyone else gets 3.
---
And I still didn't get the damn plasma grenade plans
---
I'm on Xbox and I'm selling a couple in my vending machines. gamertag is Dabeanzfynest07
---
Guess he was just trying to help his friend get his feet wet.
---
I had the same thing and got one at the very beginning of the game. 85 levels later I just assumed that was the only one you could actually get and the rest were just a joke.
---
They said so in the maintenance topic, you can find it on the bethesda forums
---
What are campfire trails
---
You usually just ignore/hide the defensive(or in my case retake) events and leave as is, if done right you can easily have stuff going on without the enemy destroying stuff.
---
Say like the cannery for instance, just power up Poseidon, use the powerbox there to hook to the canning machine and even if the workshop is in retake mode it'll still produce food, though ore/junk extractors are a pain in the butt.
---
In case of santatron, just put somewhere with an engine where the enemies can't touch and bobs your uncle.
---
Can‚Äôt you get toxic water from the white springs in the bathhouse?
---
Well it's difficult. Some guys are hackers. So they take thier tools and knowledge and search for holes in game security system. So once they find this hole they creating cheats for noobs and sell it or just use it. Basically it's hacking. To prevent this devs using anticheat protection, they ban hackers and cheaters, etc. But sadly for fair players Bethesda have no protection and this is why you have seen impossible weapons in fo76 on PC.
---
But there is exists games with a WAY worse situations. GTA online on PC it's literally cheaters paradise. I mean game just fucked up completely and fair players really can't play it and Rockstar games don't cares
---
I spent a lot on them too, in addition to grinding for presents.
---
I now have a buttload of duplicate plans.  I've learned all of the camp ones available at this point.
---
Well im a pacifist i like to let the map do most of the work for me
---
Side note, walking as far out as you can will initiate a quick error message, a loadscreen, and then a server disconnect!
---
Thank you so much!!!!! I appreciate it
---
Silent protag lol.
---
I got one that way once, then someone showed me where it's a guaranteed spawn in world and I felt less proud
---
You saw me hanging at my roof bar yesterday. I was looking at the new(old) Christmas stuff so I didn‚Äôt notice you right away. Spent the rest of the time rushing to get my mic on for a thank you. Clearly you are on a schedule. I‚Äôm gonna keep that mr.fuzzy on display.
---
Search, child. C'mon man this is asked EVERYDAY.  
---
Your going to get yes and no on the internet. What are you expecting from this, you just going to take the most convincing answer from a stranger online and run with it? Try it or don't try it.  
---
The game is great. If you like fallout, get it.
---
That image is as far out as you can go, it is litterally the map boarder.  
---
The difference in bugs. And yes I am reporting this. IF you fast travel to a camp on the border and end up out of the map you do not disconnect when the game detects you are to far out.
---
Unless Bethesda pulled their thumbs out of their arses and sorted this games performance and stability(or even just optimised) then this will never happen.
---
Personally I think that if they did there would be nobody playing it due to the thing flopping heavily.
---
When extremely skilled players can lose to a dice roll....or worse, a basement rat with daddies credit card...it becomes a LOT less fun to play.
---
Sure, big fancy weapons are a great equalizer...but they are supposed to be exactly that, an *equalizer*, not the be-all end-all of "I don't need to git gud, I need to git gud gear".  Never did like that.  Not in FO3.  Not in FNV.  Not in FO4.  And not in FO76.  At least in the single player games you can still choose to make it harder on yourself by not optimizing or focusing on stupid awesome gear.  But in 76...well...if you don't git gud gear, you don't get to compete.
---
Yea, you can ignore pvp if you want...I know I do....but a lot of B's focus is on enhancing pvp modes (nuclear winter ring a bell?).  Not to mention it also means you can basically never take a workshop, removing what to me is honestly a big and fun part of the wastelands.  That and there are a few events that you can never compete in.  Makes the raids harder too.
---
How would I fix it you ask?  Well...honestly I'm not 100% sure, but scaling back the sheer power of the legendary weapons would be one way.  Make is that a decently skilled player can actually still compete with the dude who got a lot of lucky drops (or spent a lot of money).  I suppose you can also boost normal damage instead, but the near invulnerable armor builds, as well as the super glass cannon builds, are both rather hard to deal with.  Another way would be to strip legendaries entirely.  Give us MORE weapons, but take away legendary effects entirely.  Make condition mean something, make variances in build actually important, and make skill mean something again.  I'd love to see more variety in the game (at the moment you're either inefficient, or pigeonholed).
---
That's my opinion at least.  Take it with some salt.
---
I know, I was a Kickstarter for wasteland 2 - about as close to f1 and 2 as you can get nowadays
---
Hell yeah. Would be great if we found him as a human or ghoul traveling through Appalachia. Some gullible dude that you end up directing to new Vegas. House got the voice from somewhere....
---
Yeah mine as well, it's getting at the annoying level, i have to feed my character every 3 minutes.
---
I love Marsupial, but the -4 int takes me all the way down to one, which I hate because my leveling already feels slow.  Love healing reaction as a great QOL pick and barely use chems anyway (though I made need to start using psycho).   Chameleon doesn't seem to have any negatives, so why not, right?  Maybe I should get rid of adrenal reaction, but if I'm running 2 perks worth of class freak gaining 25% of damage is worth losing 12.5 hit points.  
---
That was my thought process at least. Always open to suggestions.
---
I would like to see the challenges go beyond just grinding XP. Rewards for #kills, #wins, etc
---
60k spent so far lol
---
It sounds lazy üòë
---
haha that would be fun
---
I think even that is too much.  I'd go so far as simply making all legendaries untradeable.  Make it actually impossible to give them to someone else.  That'll kill the duping problem real fast.  It'll also do some REAL damage to the in-game economy.  But it would successfully kill the duping problem.
---
Honestly, thats a better idea
---
You're very welcome.
---
I just recieved two small presents in mine. It took awhile but it definitely works
---
I've been wondering what to do with overseer tickets once I have all the perk cards..? ive had all the ones I want for a while now, and I'm getting close to having them all..
---
Well, it's great you're having a positive experience, but there have recorded tests by both consumers and journalists demonstrating the variable input delay problems of Stadia, even in a fiber connected network.  
---
The other issue is that Google made a lot of false promises, flat out lying to promote the platform.  It's gotten a lot of negative press because of that, as well as the simple economics involved with paying more for games on a platform that hasn't been able to fulfil it's claims under objective scrutiny or demonstrate reliable and consistent service.
---
Hmm.. that's a very good point. I'd like to know the answer to your question as well.
---
Okay well I tried shutting if off repeatedly and it still kept doing it. I heard the sound you're referring to, but it just kept going.
---
Damn I was hoping for a 20 star combat knife
---
I humbly bow to your superior search skills. No, seriously. I really did try finding a post about it, but I think my search terms didn't help.
---
I'd say PC is the easiest platform to have OTHER cheats on....meaning its the hardest to enjoy with other people.  But I would still say its the best platform to play the game itself on.  Kind of a wash I suppose.
---
Ive never gotten a pie in all the fallout games lmfao

First off, played Fallout before? Mainly 3, New Vegas, or Fallout 4? If you're a fan of that style of game, you'll probably enjoy Fo76, minor changes that might take a while to get your head around, I took a while to get used to the new style of V.A.T.S, but that was pretty much my only issue at the start. The camp building is as simple, or complex as you want it to be. Just want a basic campsite to eat, sleep, and do repairs in, you shouldn't have too much trouble doing that. Want a bitching mansion with golden turrets on the roof, you'll eventually be able to do that, or be able to hire someone to do it for you.
---
The trading scene is still active, you should be able to trade for most of the lower tier weapons pretty quickly. Always check if the random weapon you just found is worth something before you dispose of it.
---
Scrap everything for parts, you need certain junk for weapons, another batch for armor, and another bunch for building. You'll be close to over encumbered a lot at the beginning of the game.
---
It's worth your time, and it's pretty cheap to buy at the moment, call it an Xmas gift for yourself.
---
Dude...holy shit lol.
---
How?!
---
So many of these are freaking impossible for me. Like take the electrician one. It's bugged out. I can complete the "restore power to the power plant" till I'm blue in the face but it won't take for me. Driving me nuts.
---
I've been completing the magazines slowly...I just finished two of the collections...I forget which ones. It's always exciting to find a new magazine.
---
they are flushing perk cards out in wastelanders more iirc, so we may see some new cards or a rework for NW
---
You can't do anything with them. It's a little disappointing they didn't offer more ways to use them. We could cash them in for XP, caps, or Atoms.
---
Um... what are you talking about? Since when can‚Äôt you earn atoms in game?
---
I havent seen anybody selling the icicle light plans yet... I did see someone yesterday selling 5 santa crash plans though!!
---
Nick Valentine.  ‚ÄúMore stairs.. Who build this damn vault? A fitness instructor?‚Äù
---
how on earth do they get 35k atoms, sounds fishy too me
---
They need to add skill and merit based rewards. Rewards for # of kills, getting kills with different weapons, etc. Not just perk cards, but cosmetic rewards for reaching specific goals.
---
&gt;The other issue is that Google made a lot of false promises, flat out lying to promote the platform.
---
Yes I agree with this point 100%. For example they lied to me when they told me that Borderlands 3 would run in silky smooth 4k60fps, which is a main reason that I bought it yesterday as I don't even LIKE shooters (too violent). And yet when I booted it up, what happens? Yes the graphics are 4k, very colorful and crisp, it seems promising. But then I start to play, and I notice that I am only getting 30fps. Huge disappointment and a definite fail on Google's part.
---
Happens to bobbles and magazines for me all the time. If you can tell which it is, remove and replace in the case and it will fix it. Otherwise, relog. I've seen the items lying on the ground but not able to interact with them, sometimes.
---
I bought the collectors edition and consider myself an avid fallout fan... the game is fun but I feel like it lacks the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù the other games have and I check back every couple of updates but after running around I usually get bored.
---
I‚Äôll probably check the wastelanders update bc of npcs are being added, and should‚Äôve been added prior to the games release, but at least we‚Äôre getting them which is what counts.
---
I have a few people who I played with and a few people who I‚Äôve met in game and holy shit the best thing about the game is literally the people... take this subreddit everyone is really chill and helpful but at the same time I can never seem to actually get into the game which goes back to the game not having the same ‚Äúsoul‚Äù as the other games... 
---
I know people can get defensive sometimes so I‚Äôm putting this last tid bit out:
---
I do not hate the game although I was expecting more, I do think the game has a lot to offer and it‚Äôs worth it if you can find it for around $20.00
---
I remembered reading that post a while back, otherwise I wouldn't even have thought to do a search :P
---
The Pioneer Scouts are more responsible with their gear than the military complex that is the Brotherhood of Steel?
---
Womp.
---
Was nothing :)
---
I have 3 extra icicle plans, and 2 santas ATM. Don't plan on stopping, so I'll probably end up with more.
---
It surprises me how many people don't know about the West Tek pie at this point. I have one piece of pie I actually got from a machine as a souvenir.  Occasionally I will grab the West Tek pie and toss it in the vending machine for like 75 caps.  Weirdos always have the pie for sale for like 10-25k so I think some people assume it's super rare based on that.  Random people will see I'm selling it for 75 and think they've hit the jackpot or something, thats the best explanation I can come up with anyways.  Someone always ends up buying it from me eventually if it's in there.
---
Anything to make workshops more desirable would be great. As it stands, they are only useful to first-time, low-level players. More incentives would help smooth out the dynamic currently in play which is, ‚ÄúLow level on workshop, must destroy.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt fruitful for either party and leaves workshops unoccupied even if they‚Äôre contested.
---
Not even a game achievement trophy? Like on ps4 or xbox? That's lame. I'd at least want a platinum trophy.
---
I feel your pain.  I have rebuilt my base a few times because of some limitation or error message.  Disappearing turrets are a pain in the butt too.
---
It's more of a hassle than it's worth. In the time it takes me to setup 4-5 workshops with Santatrons, I could have just farmed the popular Scorched locations. 
---
That said, if you were going to take a workshop anyway, definitely drop that Santatron down, it helps! It's just not worth claiming workshops _just_ for this, too time consuming.
---
No I think you're on the right track, just weight the pluses and minuses and decide.
---
I haven't gotten bird bones yet because I run 2* class freak, and honestly the -2 str just seems rough to me :P
---
And yeah, chameleon doesn't really have a downside (and adrenal reaction's is pretty mild), so having them isn't bad, but if some day you decide to wipe them out and start fresh, I wouldn't spend the caps on them (personally), just something to keep in mind.  Mind you, at that point you'll probably find that the 200ish caps for a serum is trivial, so no big deal either way.
---
FYI I‚Äôm pretty sure better criticals is broken. Use four leaf clover instead. Also invest into getting a plasma rifle with flamer mod. The plasma gun benefits from rifleman and will get you out of sticky situations when you‚Äôre mobbed and you can‚Äôt get enough DPS out of your lever or handmade.
---
I would keep an open ear to the controversies but also have an open mind...
---
Remember star wars battlefront two EA? Remember how shitty the coverage of the game was and how they basically fucked up the entire launch? 
---
That game is actually really fun to play and if you can find it on sale for around 20.00 it‚Äôs waaaaay worth it
---
Anyway the point is that even if something is ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt like it and a lot of game journalists try to clickbait consumers like us although at the same time a subreddit for a specific game is usually going to be full of people who enjoy the game and will 9/10 tell you it‚Äôs worth...
---
I‚Äôd watch some gameplay and see what dev posts people have made, maybe lurk a bit and see if the community is for you.
---
I definitely would get a mutation plan if I were you. I have the carnivore one and with a little flux sand bone I can easily fill my daily limit
---
Lock em all you want. I‚Äôm picking them. Idc about a bounty come get me.
---
Id like crossplay between the consoles but definitely not with PC due to m&amp;k, increased fps, fov etc and hackers.
---
Yes you can steal them I stole one from someone and got a dcg extra claw from it lol
---
My lead collector never has legendary gear or presents.
---
Crane caught pie is life! Spawn pie eaters deserve a traitors death
---
You've only spent 25k? I did that the first day...I'm probably 40-50k in at this point. In this game, caps aren't worth much of anything. 
---
I think I've gotten all the special plans, and I'm still buying as many small and medium plans as I can get for the godamn fucking plasma grenade plan for that one horribly implemented possum challenge.
---
*Tegridy Farms*
---
Where it dosent show the lead...
---
Mamologist is nice. I just don't like how it floods my gallery with all the camera shots.
---
Thanks for the break down seems intense and crazy smart busting into a game like that.
---
If it was Santa with an eye patch I‚Äôm your guy.
---
Should be under wall decor in C.A.M.P building
---
This is really interesting, how old is your ps4 pro?
---
I've spend a lot of game time finding things to spend money on...I already buy all my ammo, and have scoured the server for plans I don't know (excluding serums, because I'll likely never make any).  My vendors bring in a lot of cash, so I'm frequently capped.
---
I'm loving having the option to buy the wrapping paper, any time I get close to 20K I buy out whitespring.  I figure the extra plans may be worth a little later on, so it's not a total waste...and what else is there to buy?
---
Literally everybody with the ability to think for themselves: Don't buy Fallout 76, Bethesda is being shady
---
r/fo76: reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
**Fallout 76 proceeds to be objectively bad**
---
r/fo76: best game ever lulzz 
---
also r/fo76: Bethesda is ignoring ussss :( :(
---
Almost forgot Danny Trejo
---
I had 11 toxic waters. :(
---
Yeah as Xantagr said, but, if you go in to edit mode in camp, not placement mode, and highlight a lockable object, it'll show you the key to press to lock based on platform.  Then you just select the lock level shown in the upper left of the screen.
---
LOL fallout 76 is not skill based. Its hack based get rekt fan boi LOL
---
In the desert by Grafton dam you can get some.
---
All my lead is legendary.
---
Enter Build mode in your CAMP, and then switch to Modify mode. Next, highlight the container attached to your Santatron Station, and then choose the "Lock" option to choose what level of lock you want to add. You'll need to use a few crafting materials to create the lock. Hope that helps!
---
Is it really worth introducing 10 new unrelated bugs for this?
---
Yeah I thought it would be there but I can't see it in the menu. Cool stuff
---
I used to love defending workshops I passed by, helping people out, and sometimes taking one for myself if I was bored.  But no, not now.  I don't care if j see someone emoting "help me" as I am nearby, the deceptive griefing nowadays means I will only play workshops in private servers.
---
I have both PS4 and PS4 Pro, the biggest game play improvement by far was replacing the spinning disk with SSD.
---
I'll see more blue screens on the Pro than on the regular one, but it's become less frequent over time. Annoying when it happens, but not as rage-quit worthy as it used to be.
---
As a bonus if you have two PS4's, you can run two separate PSN accounts using only one PS+ subscription. It makes self muling super easy and way less risky.
---
I don't plan on spending any caps on them. I got most of the plans already and the other rewards aren't really worth the caps. There's still two weeks of santa scorched too... I doubt any plan will be worth more than 1k by the time the event is over.
---
My lead comes wrapped in presents
---
And Fred Melamed as Senator Chambers!
---
Sure thing do you get off work at 9Pm again?
---
When it happened to me I stored my display case thinking the items would just appear back under my junk tab but they weren‚Äôt. I never tried the log back in method which seems to be the solution.
---
I met a Santa last week, in costume ran around my camp and dropped a bunch of legendaries (one was an upgrade of the weapon I was using) a bunch of toys and a propaganda poster on my bed. I didn't get his name but if you're reading this thank you communist Santa you're the best!
---
No no no, you're supposed to spend your caps at my vendors üòã
---
Jessica, I have a spare pirate suit. It did not go into my player vendors as I thought no-one would be interested. Well I was wrong! I am on PC in Australia. If you want it you can have it for free. Please message if you are still interested. I will be on after 7pm Thursday 19 Dec AEDT or 16 hours ahead of ET.
---
Since you are on the PS4, I reccomend also asking on the Communities there too, they can be quite helpful.  
---
Raiding is not my thing, but good luck to you.
---
I cant get the restore power to power plant to conplete...  I've done each power plant atleast 5 times never works... anyone else have this issue???? Also congrats!!!
---
25K....pftt....spent that in the first 45 minutes.  Spent 150K thus far and will spend another 150K this weekend.  Must...have...them...ALL!
---
Adolf Hitler
---
Jet packs dont sell as much maybe 100c ive droped mine down to 5c and no one buys so idk. Serum is plans or the pot? The plans go for like 15k e and the drink its self i see for 350 to 1k (average i see is between 300 to 500c)
---
I heard 4/5 star legendaries were removed, but if you had a custom 3 star even with a 4/5 star only effect it remain untouched.
---
Jetpacks not worth much they drop alot now
---
Hm...I guess I should try again just to see if it's still bugged...I bet it will be lol.
---
Well consider yourself lucky you completed them.
---
What about a full set of unyielding?
---
They finally added hides to their drop table? I had no idea. The few I've killed so far haven't dropped one, so I presumed it was still the way it used to be. I guess I need to start killing more deathclaws now. Thanks for the info.
---
I play on PC, so I don't know if there's any trophy/achievement in those platforms. All I can say is in PC there's no reward for completing all the challenges
---
you wont, because that would require bethesda to do actual real work
---
Are you on ps4? I have a couple for sale at my vendor I'll give to you
---
People are selling rare plans for 10k?! I sell mine for 500 and everything else at 199. Oh and the Santa and winter lights are 2000
---
Its bloodied, bloodied just about anything really, junkies is good too, and while not the meta anymore two shot explaouve still deals high damage for a sort of middle man
---
I meant to get the sink and water fountain but feel asleep in the last hours. Luckily, it meant I could afford the fireplace this week. Still wishing I had at least snagged the water fountain.
---
I really wish Bethesda could hammer down on the RWTs.
---
I'm coming for you all tonight.
---
Only other thought is it could be grouped in with another wall decor item and you need to scroll right or left to see the other options.
---
Can someone screenshot the fo1st section I want to see what they are offering at the moment.
---
Why wouldn't I spend my caps on it? I have all the Serum recipes. Not really hunting for any godtier items. (Part because I find it ridiculous people are asking more than the caps limit of a single character for a item.) My other option is to do Encrypted a lot..
---
And if you're on PC I can mod.  Also have have extra base UGL plans knocking about from the event.
---
I unlocked it before leaving for work and spent a few minutes looking. Couldn't find it.
---
PRESTON GARVEY!!! (waving fist in the air). I don't know about all of you but I hate clutter in the form of incomplete quests. In Fallout 4, I was driven MAD by accidentally running into Preston and having him tell me about a settlement needing my help. I want to find the developer who programmed him and mail him a paper bag with the contents of toilet paper, a bag of fertilizer and a 'You've Been Insulted!' paper note!
---
Gotcha I‚Äôll check out the video :)
---
Yeah they broke it with team only update. team only is the only option that works for me now unless I want to solo
---
Can I buy it and cancel it the same day to make sure it doesn‚Äôt renew or should I wait a week or so?
---
Yes, I prefer sticking needles in my eyes
---
Follow Miller's advice, you'll be winning in no time!
---
I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm currently playing with no mutations but if I do use any, it‚Äôs the Marsupial Mutation anyway.
---
Oh i can't wait to check mine when i get home!
---
I don't want to log off in case this disappears!
---
does this offer just apply to Amy's body, or anyone named Amy Body?
---
Yea I know.. but a explosive laser is good no matter what.. anything can and might be duped at some point :p
---
You relize that in 2 weeks plasma grenade plans will be as common as mole miner gauntlet plans?
---
Or have them only last like a week unless you save or favourite them.
---
The FO76 equivalent of porch pirates
---
I have a few friends that I do that with, I have others that I sell things to at deeply reduced prices, and others that because of their own behavior pay full price like anyone else. I have a very large amount of caps &amp; gear, so many try to take advantage of that when they have something I want, others simply give me things I want, I treat both as they treat me and others.
---
A fool and his money are soon parted.
---
Have you ever tried to slide down a dry water slide?  They're not as frictionless as you'd hope.
---
I am checking them all. All.
---
Unknown. Probably a bug, since there isn't really a compelling reason to make this ONE mutation immune to Class Freak. There has been some speculation that it has to do with the way the "drawback" is coded - since it's an increase in the rate of food/water consumption instead of a decrease in a stat, it doesn't trigger the "drawback" reduction.
---
Hacks!
---
Oh how awesome - really hoping I can replicate when I get home but I have a feeling I wont be able to ü§£
---
My first couple hours in I was scavenging in the responders church in Flatwoods when a level 80 something gave me 300 plus rounds of ammo, basic plans, level 1 guns and more. Sent them a message thanking them and since then I always find low level players around the area and give them a hand.  And I still see quite a few others doing the same.
---
I‚Äôve ran into the occasional dick like any other online game but for the most part the community  is very friendly. I don‚Äôt know if just luck on my part or what but I‚Äôve had some good experiences.
---
It was bugged there was an update this morning to fix it so now you should be receiving at least one gift an hour
---
Yah i deserve it a bit should of been a bit clear oh well xD
---
Not quite that common, but I didn't realize how easy they would be to come by, so long as you understand the drop pool.
---
It really is tiny, it‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt buy it. I always find the items in the build menu and just see what they would look like IRL before purchasing based on the pictures in the Atom Shop. Hence why I got the Christmas Trees because it wasn‚Äôt clear in the pictures but they have decorations on them if you keep scrolling through the variations.
---
I'm private world workshop santatron farming right now, kills the glass cavern exploit and this isnt even an exploit.
---
Exactly how I did it.
---
You racist!
---
Both Jetpack and Serum should be priced at a maximum of 500, but you should go lower than that.
---
And yet I still haven‚Äôt had any sales üò≠
---
Why? it reduces your PER by 2. I have one on PC, I never use it.
---
yup
---
Toxic water. Now with murelurk taste. Ask Grafton's mayor.
---
Lucky you - now go buy that lotto ticket!
---
Been playing almost a year now...finally got my first one from a port-o-diner last weekend :)
---
Want to complete the uniform
---
You got it?
---
Hm wondering if anyone got stuck in the red tube..
---
He... will never come back.
---
Yes, I don‚Äôt understand the point in being able to craft it though.
---
Put the 3 points into agility for action boy until u get ap refresh on your Armour, u can drop strength to two and use bandolier if u want the extra weight, don't get quality of life perks, learn to manage your weight. Weapon wise anti armor would be good but there's shouldn't be a reason for not using Bloodied or junkies
---
Tbh if tthey dont lock theirs they deserve to have their gifts stolen.
---
Locking mine was the first thing i did.
---
It's on the list. Row 119
---
Sadly with this workaround it ends costing more on budget then having a single wall doing the same.
---
I believe you can only get the legendary versions of it from the purveyor if you know the plan.
---
It's called grognak axe replica
---
Really? 0.o
---
Damn, guess I should up my prices. I feel kind of bad when people only waste 75 on them, not bad enough to stop doing it though lol
---
Definitely in wall decoration
---
Thank you!
---
It DOES NOT SHHHHHHHHH
---
I still keep my main house locked behind a powered keypad door because I think it‚Äôs cool and makes me feel safe when I step away from the game for a couple mins. 
---
However I have a separate guest house complete with beds, workbenches, and I also keep all my crops and water assessable to all.
---
If they add it I hope they keep it optional like everything else does
---
"THIS IS GRAFTONS MAYOR TELLING YOU TO DRINK UP! GOTTA KEEP THOSE FLUIDS TOPPED UP HEY? Mmmhmhmmmhmm..."
---
I honestly think people just want to feel special that the community directly addressed them even if it's the same exact answer that wa as given 9 times prior that week.
---
And wearing Power Armor as an armor, not a vehicle that needs gas and un-equips your cool legendary gear.
---
It literally spawns on every server
---
Yes , however most are either from the atom shop or rewards from limited time events.
---
Those pesky christmas wrapping papers making us all piss poor...welcome to the great recession üòÇ
---
It isn't a good deal though.
---
If you buy 3 and sell 3 you're getting this profit: (-600c +1500c) = 900c daily. (even though you can't sell all 3 without buying something else)
---
You could've get 1400c daily by hoarding trash weapons and selling it, without costs. What I like to do is 1~3 server hop in a populated (scorched/supermutant)  place and grab every weapon they drop.
---
I completely understand that logic :)
---
  I loot everything I can while I am hunting santas....sell it back to the local bot, then buy both med and large wrapping paper.  Think of it as extra chances to get the plans I really want, and with crafting 2 per paper, might ultimately be cheaper than trying to buy the plan later.  :)
---
No reason to spend time grinding for loot legitimately when this stuff can be done. I haven't played adventure mode since NW came out. I hope others realize this too.
---
B5090 lever action, VE minigun and a BE pipe bolt action of we aren't counting the Purveyor.
---
Hey wonder if you could empty it and refill it with raw fertilizer and "you have been insulted" note? I am going to find out tonight.
---
Looks pretty strong. It is worthwhile to grab Mister Sandman for the extra night time sneak attacks. If you equip Covert Operative after Mister Sandman, you can glitch the modifier up to 3.75√ó sneak attack damage.
---
My build is pretty similar except I don't go full 15 PER weapon perks and instead max out AGI and LCK for better PVPing.
---
For your issues with carry weight, I run full weightless gear and chameleon mutation. Weightless plus Ultra-light armor mods makes most of my armor weight zero pounds. At that point, just play smart. Don't carry tons of junk, hold between 10-20 stimpaks, drop unused ammo, etc.
---
A neat tip, if you find a legendary automatic rifle with -25% AP cost in VATS, using the appropriate AP reduction weapon mods can completely reduce Vats cost to zero. Doing this will give you a lot more mileage out of Gunfu. 
---
Also, weak point modifiers, like a 2x head shot, occur at the end of the damage formula meaning it doubles your critical hits too. Concentrated Fire is a correct choice. I've personally tested this to death and am debating writing a full article on it.

Yeah I've noticed a big increase as well, I get a lot of people are trying to make sense but this is the 3rd or so time they have increased thrist and hunger. So I don't know if it's a unintentional side effect of some bug fix or them trying to push atom shop items.
---
You can vount mama drops in!

Thanks for the reply, shame that, just want a regular new outfit! Dont wanna be a witch, or somit like that, just more general choice! Chance to be more individual ya know

You only need 2 ranks in strength (to carry all that ammo you're going to burn through). One rank in Gun fu will make you wish you tried the build earlier üòâ.

Certain parts of the game.do not work, no. I can't play those parts.
---
I have tried reinstalling. Nothing. I have three friends that play and they also experience similar or the same issues as me. We all have no other issues playing any other games.
---
Yeah actually the unlimited scrap box is an advantage. I was able to free up 2 mule characters. 
---
And I don't really sell stuff from my vendor so I didn't think about it like that.

But yeah the scrap stash is an advantage.

Thanks, I did about 3 double takes when it dropped from the queen. You've got some great rolls yourself. I've been searching for a bloodied fixer since they started dropping

Pie snatcher tip: on an attempt where you won't get a pie, the claw will go straight down. Of course, on an attempt you *will* get a pie, the claw repositions slightly (to the right, facing the side with the door) before descending to collect your reward for your patience.
---
I‚Äôll trade complete pirate outfit for a BFFR handmade max lvl
---
beware of high level players, they may cause the game to become too easy by giving you starting packages.
---
Does it actually do 793 dmg? I can‚Äôt check as I‚Äôm grounded
---
Those handmades are epic. Top rifles in the game. How many hours do you have in game?
---
And moldy food
---
People have bases underground nothing normal if you have a camp next to a mountain sometimes you can spawn in the mountains.
---
Is there a smaller tree with lights?
---
Clothes? Where we‚Äôre going we doing need clothes.
---
Tried to edit it and clicked delete instead lol.
---
I've had it happen when I load in with a Gatling laser(or similar) then quick swap to a handmade.
---
Got it along with the Tomahawk plan from a couple of the large handmade gifts.
---
So she can give good loot after all. It was my graduating day when mama dropped the b25 fixer to me, was kind of shoked. Traded that for a nice legacy and was hoping for be or b10 fixer in the future. Few weeks later the b10 dropped. Not one fixer after that tho
---
This is true. I don't go vendor hopping looking for cheap serums. If I see them, I will probably grab some.
---
My play time is usually spent grabbing the ammo factory, playing with my camp, and maybe an event or two. If I do Uranium Fever and load up on mole miner crap, I can hit 1400 easy.
---
Serums are just a quick, easy way to increase caps. Log on, go to vendor, sell, move on with my day. Solely farming for my 1400 would take up half my play time each night.
---
Two pieces of advice: plan your character build ([nukesdragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) is a good planner, but can be overwhelming for a new player), and don't rush things.
---
Well, 3 weeks ago i was in the same place as you. I  bought the game used for 9‚Ç¨ (!) and thought to my self "if it's shit, i'd have wasted only 9‚Ç¨ on it". Turns out i haven't been able to stop playing! Roaming, scraping, building..they work for me. I like the game as it is and Wastelanders is only gonna make it better. I even consider getting Fo1st (my quickly filling stash box makes me anxious)!
---
It seems quite likely that [Stephen Russell](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Stephen_Russell) (actor of Nick Valentine and many others in BGS titles) will voice some characters in Wastelanders, and also [Wes Johnson](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wes_Johnson).
---
How many of those challenges do you need to complete to get the Backpack?
---
The B5090 lever action was my favourite of them :)

Honestly I would just explore. The main quest line can be done whenever. Don‚Äôt rush to complete it, and just enjoy the game. At first stay to the west side of the map. These areas will be lower level, and level locked so us higher level players don‚Äôt use you to run into mobs you are way to low of a level to deal with. 
---
Also don‚Äôt be scared of higher level players. Most of us don‚Äôt mind helping with supplies, and if you have a mic and need some help ask a higher level. And if you want people to play with who don‚Äôt care about meta gaming, and just having fun check out the Filthy Casuals. We have a subreddit, and discord that cover PC and console.
---
Confirmed. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúreplica‚Äù.
---
Also got the extra claw mod plan for the DCG in the same group of packages.
---
B5090 lever, BE bolt action pipe rifle, BE25 pipe revolver, B2515r combat rifle, VE minigun, VE250 gatling gun, AAE250 lmg, Uny AP Cav metal leg, and lots of Uny and Assassin's Sent pieces.
---
it is death claw mating season buddy, he has gone off to find a mate to produce more of his kind. sadly when finished he will forget he ever lived with you and wander the wastes.
---
Just kind of jump in - I would say to start in a live server with other players since you're just getting started- I know a lot of players like myself enjoy giving things to new players, so if a player comes up to you spamming the gift emote and then shoots at a bag on the ground -they are trying to give you things! 
---
I would recommend staying in the forest area and the toxic valley. Nothing wrong with exploring but if you head into the savage divide (the middle) or the mire (the teal) or the bog (red) you're going to have a hard time as a low level. Just explore and follow the quest for a bit but take time to level up if you can. Don't worry about buying plans early on - it's not worth the caps at your level. You can earn plans by doing quests and eventually claiming and protecting workshops but keep in mind that workshops will flag you for  PVP so watch your back. 
---
Scrap your junk before you stash it and stash it often - this will be much easier to do if you do go ahead and get the sub because you can place your tent most anywhere and it has a stash and a scrap box - so you can put all of your junk in the scrap box. 
---
As far as PVP - in adventure mode there's no slap damage anymore so people can shoot at you all day long but they cannot hurt you if you don't fight back. So don't get baited into hitting people just because they hit you first. They just want your junk/caps. 
---
If you have questions feel free to let me know. I hope you have fun!
---
Junkies explosive combat rifle has been good to me
---
Most of the issues you had at launch have been resolved. There are still a few bugs out there, but nothing that will impact normal day to day play.
---
For Meta, its now bloodied.  Pick a bloodied thing, any bloodied thing.
---
for PVP Commando seems to be the way to go. 
---
For PVE, any bloodied build.
---
It makes sense. I guess we just play the game differently. I don't have a lot of time to play as well, so I spend my time killing things.
---
Yeah I've actually had great luck with the queen. I dont hardcore farm her, I just join in when someone launches on site prime and I've gotten several good rolls. Got a AA/FFR/+1 agility gauss from her too
---
There was a patch today
---
Are you using that be pipe revolver or bolt action  with the rifleman and gunslinger perks?
---
Ahhhh I see.
---
Yeah I no longer have the junkies unfortunately, let‚Äôs just say it was in a whitesprings trash can lol I have almost 1k hours in, took a break for about 5 months after fasnacht event. Happy I came back to play :)
---
Amazing. Rng gods have been good to you
---
Bethesda needs to patch out this weird bug where PVE players keep taking workshops.
---
What kind of thing are you after ? I could probably recommend something lmao , there‚Äôs also a lot of hat and mask choices and many more have been added , as well as backpacks , so you can easily become unique .
---
Welcome back! Lets cross our fingers for Wastelanders
---
If you need caps just save up for a recipe (5-8k) and then buy flux at like 100 per it‚Äôs much cheaper and you get super duper
---
I've used them both from time to time. I just converted my pistol character to rifleman since I have so many rifles. They both hit pretty hard but I need to tweak my cards so I can get the sneak bonuses as well.
---
Good find!
---
Makes sense he uses the Big Bend to get between the Ash Heap and Cranberry Big so fast!
---
This is not true as I have received legendary versions well before this event.
---
\^this
---
I'll add at ... level 5, i think....turn on pacifist mode.
---
3 badges. You also need to do other objectives, like revive another player. [Here's a walkthrough of the quest](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Order_of_the_Tadpole) with all the objectives.
---
From the purveyor?
---
I have friends who specifically make minimum-level accounts with optimized builds to be able to kill a high-level player with a low-level account. I'm not sure if this exploit still exists, but they also used to be able to use a specific weapon on a level 4 character to kill another player without being in PvP at all, since PvP isn't possible on a level 4.
---
It takes like 12 in perception and 12 in agility to get those numbers up. Not that many QoL perks to fiddle in there
---
From the purveyor and as loot on killed enemies
---
They're all replicas since Grognax is a comic book character in Fallout lore.
---
I‚Äôve never paid a single cap for flux.
---
And my standard price for serums is 299. 
---
If someone wants to buy them to resell to a vendor, that‚Äôs not relevant to me. What the consumer does with an item after purchase is irrelevant in about 99% of all real world transactions. No different here.
---
So...killing other players is your thing then?  I'm mostly grinding for better legendaries and rare stuff.  Don't see much reason to bother low levels and newbies, much faster ways to accumulate junk üòâ.
---
2* BFFR railway, 2* BE pump, 2* BFFR gatling laser, 3* VSS+1end miner gauntlet, 1* J handmade
---
my irl luck must be stuck on like -4
---
and that's why people wanted private servers. Thanks for making them $100 a year Bethesda!
---
Those Possum badges drop in campfire tales at a rate of %25 if I remember correctly.
---
7 rad x nice üëçüëç
---
Seems like this is an issue for the Gauss Rifle as well. Sometimes it doesn't cause damage at all, though I haven't tested if this is only for charged shots or not.
---
I disagree.  Ever drop a lvl 30something in a workshop they just took?   9 out of 10 times they have 50-100 pounds of junk on them.
---
Yup quite common, got at least 3 plans
---
Welcome to the wasteland. The fallout first is a good idea as this will eliminate a lot of grief for you literally and figuratively. Use you private servers to gather xp/resources/farming  from workshops . Use public servers for interaction with other wastelanders,trading public events etc. Just always remember to be careful out there.
---
I‚Äôve never had issues with obtaining flux. Anytime I‚Äôm over 20 stored, I usually make some serums. 
---
If someone wants to flip them to a vendor, that doesn‚Äôt concern me.  What a buyer does with their property after purchase isn‚Äôt relevant in about 99% of all real world transactions. No different here.
---
it unlocks 1 per day at 7pm EST
---
Yeah, I have my PvP commando character that I attempted to do it on but didn't want to be that strict with my perks so I switched the pistol character since all the good sneak damage perks are in agility.
---
The drop rate changes were server-side, so I can't give exact numbers, but it's supposed to be around 1 per hour.
---
Turn the nuka cola factory into a cap printing workshop!
---
That BE pump with silenced sneak attacks was devastating before the shotgun nerf. Kind of miss that. I know one friend that seem to be SUPER lucky in everything so he must have charisma buffs
---
Jumpsuit and mask set from Uranium Fever (sold for +50k)
---
Quad Explosive RW Handmade (sold for 50k 5.56) Got from Mmurgh 
---
BE Lever 2* (sold for 30k) Got from Super Mutant at West Tek 
---
Bloodied Handmade 2* (still use) Got from a Super Mutant at Sunnytop when I was level 46
---
Unyielding Marine armor Right leg 3* +1luck WWR  for 500caps at a vendor (still use)
---
Yes, there's a weapon swap bug that does this, I used to run into it occasionally but wasn't sure the exact steps to reproduce it.
---
I haven't seen it in a while, I thought maybe it had gotten fixed.  Apparently not.
---
I wish that survival servers would come back. Good pvp figths in adventure are kind of rare
---
If you are on Xbox, I‚Äôll give you those two magazines
---
I might re design my camp so I can hide my santatron because of this. Even if its locked, someone steals from it, they get wanted and no matter what you've lost the gift. Time for santatron to be relegated to the basement and sealed in lol.
---
Even locked, dont forget teammates can freely access it.
---
You can defend it and not lose it. Otherwise, it's not "your" workshop. It's a public workshop.
---
In the future, Bethesda plans on allowing Fallout 1st subscribers to keep the workshops on private servers. Those would be "your" workshops.
---
Waiting for enemies to respawn is an exploit?
---
BE Pipe Rifle, JFFR Handmade, VFFR RW Gatling Plasma, VFFR RW Radium, BFFR 10mm, AAE Handmade, BFFR Vats Crit Pump Shotgun, Quad 10%WA Gamma Gun, FE LVC LMG, QFFR RW Plasma Rifle.
---
There's others, I'm sure, but these spring to mind. More than 5 but y'know. Lol
---
oh i'm a scrooge! get off my lawn.
---
Ooooo TY!
---
It‚Äôs 10%, rounded down. It‚Äôs intended as a cap sink to stabilize the economy.  That‚Äôs why I price almost everything with a ‚Äò9‚Äô at the end. Keeps that one extra cap (that I wouldn‚Äôt get anyway) in the buyer‚Äôs pocket.
---
And 25% of listed base value pretty fair for the majority of items. There are a few that you have to figure out the fair market price (like, no one should be trying to sell a Tinker‚Äôs Workbench plan for 50 caps...), but it‚Äôs not a bad default. 
---
When in doubt, do some research or set prices on the high side. If it doesn‚Äôt sell after about a day, drop the price a bit. Repeat until it starts selling with good frequency.
---
Valiant effort
---
This is great, thanks a lot man. I thought there would be a lot of trolls and toxic players online but it sounds that I might be wrong here. I can't wait!
---
Daisy from Goodneighbor! But she grew up in the commonwealth but she was 70 when the bombs fell so maybe she did some travelling. I would love to bump into her at least maybe. &lt;3
---
I thought it came with the enclave outfit
---
Very good stuff there. I have yet to get zero be drops and those are the guns that I love.
---
As mentioned by other people it's a perk Frog legs
---
And it's absolutely ruins the great gamemode
---
It shouldn't belong as a perk.
---
I was noticing this, too.  Started spamming the "take all" option on every enemy just to be sure I got everything.
---
How has that gamma gun served you?
---
Everyone is using their caps to buy wrapping paper. Lol
---
do you automatically unlock the 2nd prize once it unlocks if you accrue enough points during the first day?
---
I still get traffic - Guessing b/c my camp is near a known scorched spawn point.
---
Doubt they have a ton of stable flux, ultracite, screws, and acid (the only stuff I seem to run low on).  So taking their wood &amp; steel seems just....mean...I guess.
---
What rare plans are going for over 10k? 
---
I did the Halloween event and obtained and sold every single rare outfit - in fact some several times over (including the pirate).  Didn‚Äôt come close to 10k not even the WS jumpsuit. 
---
I‚Äôve already acquired and sold several plasma grenade plans, icicle light plans, crash Santa‚Äôs, all the rare critter mounts and nothing, I repeat nothing went for 10k.  
---
I do have a prime auto handmade receiver plan (actually 2) for sale for 5000 caps.  That‚Äôs way more valuable than a stupid crash Santa IMHO.
---
I was unable to actually place the Santatron last night. I kept seeing something about it blocking the structure entrance or whatever. I had to put it at the edge of my CAMP.
---
Yeah, I've had a few but they usually end with someone getting the god mode bug. I've got a bunch of buddies that PvP with each other just for fun. If you ever want to join hit me up. I believe you are still on my friends list from our last trade.
---
Right but I don‚Äôt think other grognak axes say replica on them... do they? Maybe I never noticed.
---
Agreed, I hardly ever take workshops but it is a PVP mechanic. If you do then there is always that chance. Be prepared or face the consequences lol
---
I've been playing since beta and I've only had a handful of experiences with trolls. They're definitely out there but it's not the majority by far. Most people are pretty chill and willing to help.
---
Yeah my camp is in the forest east of the Alpine river cabins.
---
That's awesome news. Guess I'm staying on the private server to make sure I keep my gifts.
---
It's a nice piece of kit when I'm PvPing. It's fun to use to boot. Haven't tried it PvE. I imagine it's pretty worthless.
---
Yeah lol. I had 25k, now I‚Äôm down to 12k üòÄ.
---
Thanks. I will have a think on this.
---
What do you mean by persistent like after you log off or?...
---
Cool! That actually sounds fun, I will join your server some time :)
---
Marine Tactical Helmets (once you have the plans to craft) and Mothman Egg Omelets.
---
A quick run to Grafton Middle School will net you enough Rubber to craft about 35 MTHs, which can sell for up to 31 caps each (1085c). 
---
A quick run to Point Pleasant gets you enough Mothman Eggs to craft 36 MMEOs, which sell for up to 10 caps each (360c). 
---
Both runs combined and the related crafting usually takes me less than 10 minutes, and generate some XP &amp; loot along the way.  No server hopping needed.
---
When this happens you should bring them some super mutants to keep them company.
---
I'm at about 1300 hours and I've only gotten 2 legit drops that were good.  
---
* Bloody Swing Speed +1 Strength Baseball Bat 
---
* Anti Armor Faster Fire Rate 25% Vats Handmade
---
Maybe I'm missing something... but how? Don't you have to collect a bunch of possum badges? Doing enough of those to get the backpack took me quite a bit of time unless you wait until the end game. 
---
You get a full set of PA at multiple points on your way through the main quest. Meanwhile I have a level 100 character that doesn't have backpacks because I just haven't set aside the time to do it.
---
The Fallout 4 pie is easy to get. If you have Nuka-World, go to the junkyard. In the building, there is a Port-a-Diner inside that always gives a Perfectly Preserved Pie the first time you use it.
---
is that like a trick so they dont get afk kicked?
---
Is it like vats only in pvp? I remember that the blasts has bullet time of a snail so from a distance you can dodge?
---
I'm not afk I swear, I'm just playing Wastelad and I don't have my mic plugged in
---
I‚Äôve sold the winter lights for 750 each, crash Santa for 2500, and rare critter mounts for 500-800 each.  I have 4 Plasma grenade plans including one for sale that‚Äôs sitting there for 1500 caps.  No takers yet. 
---
The icicle lights go like hotcakes (sold 5) as did my crash Santa‚Äôs (sold 3).  The non rare critter mounts (I sell for 150 each) have moved pretty well also.
---
Right!
---
You can lock it. When you first place it down, give it a minute for the robot to exit, then place a lock on it. It won't allow a lock until the exiting animation is complete. Mine is behind 3 level 3 locks. If you can get past the defenses that held off every attack in Survival for 4 hours straight, you deserve the junk in there.
---
Lol. Is it possible to kite a scorchbeast?
---
What platform are you on :eyes:
---
I would say those are god like weapons so you got your share of the rng ;)
---
A little trick with rubber bands, I think. :)
---
I have actually gotten more customers since Santa launched his scorched hoard on the wasteland.
---
Truth be told, most of those sales have been for mounted plans.  But the ammo and armor/weapons has been selling steady too. 
---
If you dont have customers, maybe you dont have enough stuff on sale to pull customers to your camp.    Try to have a good supply of armors and weapons (legendaries, not outfits), and right now, plans.    Serums can bring in shoppers too.    To get customers, you have to sell stuff customers want.
---
Thanks, but I'm on PC. And it wouldn't work neither.
---
To complete the magazine challenges you need to pick them up from the world. I actually have all the magazines, but as I said, this challenges only register the ones that you take from a magazine spawn. That's what it makes this challenges so hard
---
I‚Äôm 80% helping, 20% hurting.
---
Mine are pretty poor. From Purveyor, I got a Unyielding, WWR, STR chest piece (Robot) and recently I got a TSE Submachine off of a ghould. Other than that, my RNG on legendaries has been extremely poor.
---
im abit late but here is a crappy photo of where it was located for me if yoi have not found it yet. (wall decor, between fasnacht ribbons and the pictures)
---
https://ibb.co/McskZkf
---
This is a great time to be a buyer.  Picked up several things yesterday that you do not normally see for sale for caps.  Plan on doing a lot of shopping over the next 13 days üëç
---
Wow. People are...creative. I just gonna kind my business, moving forward. No interest in PVP.
---
I sold a snallgaster explosion for 10k once. Not to forget the the 100s of recipes for growth enhancer ive sold to people :D
---
Sadly you will have to tame a new one. If he disappeared he probably died. Players shouldn't be able to damage them but if a bunch of low level mobs ganged up on him they could easily kill him. My deathclaw was killed by a level 10 Liberator and there's frequently ghouls/protectrons and mr handys in flatwoods. Also afaik it was changed so that pets do not require budget.
---
I am still salty that Deacon was not a romance option in FO4.
---
It'd be more like MacCready's great-great-great-great grandparents LOL
---
In all seriousness though, seeing some pre-war ghouls we already know before they became ghoulified would be fantastic! I personally would love to see Kent Connolly, he was one of my favorite characters in Fallout 4 and already has a mention in 76 through fan mail he sent to Shannon Rivers (The Mistress of Mystery).
---
I mostly use it as a support weapon. Thanks to it's AoE it's a nice choice for flushing out Chameleon users. I also reach for it when someone is pogoing with Assassin's Sentinel. It's easy to predict where they're going to land and the rads cut right through them.
---
SO SALTY. no fair. also wtf why? you could romance a ghoul and at least two synths, but not my sassy boy deacon??
---
Yes, it is.  Tag it, run it to whichever camp needs company, hide somewhere in the camp, then fast travel out (hiding is necessary so your 15 second FT Timer doesnt reset)
---
Yeah I was pretty happy and shocked with both of them. I was with my friends when I got the bats and I started to yell because I was so excited. I like to collect weird bloody weapons - I just got a bloody pitchfork in a trade but nothing tops my bloody shovel
---
I would increase agility to 15 with the remaining points, and move one from intelligence to luck. You do not need gunsmith equipped all the time, and rank 4 of gunsmith should be enough for any gun that is useful to your character. Without mutations, and with 12 luck, I would use bloody mess, grim reaper's sprint, critical savvy, and better criticals, each at rank 3. But with 5 points already spent on mutation perks, it is harder to decide, maybe more points would need to be moved from other attributes.
---
Contrary to others' suggestions, I would keep blocker 3 under strength, that can help a lot when swarmed by melee enemies. Fireproof should not be needed in theory if you have dense armor, although it is safer to have it equipped (it is easy to get killed unexpectedly by explosions, and there is a glitch that causes random enemies to explode after death as if they were legendary robots). But strength, endurance, and intelligence perks can be swapped depending on the situation.
---
yes, when you rubberband your right stick so your toon spins to prevent the game from Idling out and kicking you offline.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve got heaps of plans and lots of chameleon armour. I rarely sold legendary weapons and never any serums (don‚Äôt have the recipes) but business was always fine for me. It only recently that‚Äôs it abruptly slowed down.
---
Better that they learn the perils of carrying junk on them in a PvP zone *now* (when they‚Äôre only going to lose some ‚Äòwood &amp; steel‚Äô) than later when they‚Äôre carrying a bunch of flux, Ultracite and screws...
---
And you‚Äôd be surprised what some of them are actually carrying. I had a level 30 try to take my workshop. 120 Acid, 80 Ballistic Fiber, and 50 Screws were some of the choice items he dropped about five seconds later. Which went into my Scrapbox about 3 seconds later. 
---
Now... where can I get that much junk in 8 seconds anywhere else, outside of buying it from a vending machine?
---
I‚Äôve probably bought 25 large and medium wrapping papers each and then with chemist x2 have opened close to 100.  I still have about a dozen of each sitting in my stash. 
---
For me, it‚Äôs about acquiring the rare weapon plans and mods as the drops have become so much harder to come by with the SBQ events less and less.  Just in this week I‚Äôve landed two prime auto handmade receiver plans through opening presents.  I farmed the queen probably 150 times and never got that drop.  The standard auto (tweaked) handmade receiver is almost as rare yet bought one off a player at their vendor for 25 caps!!  This was several months ago.  Was able to retrofit my AAE handmade.  I already have two other primed handmades - a BE auto and B25 FFR auto - but to me it‚Äôs about hunting for those rare items or weapons or gear as I‚Äôm not a collector of outfits or camp builder type.
---
Aside from the really bright suits that were popular there's a Pirate Costume from the Halloween event. Don't think they added any other than atom shop outfits for Christmas
---
If you try to get it out of a pie vending machine, there's an instant way to tell if you'll get it or not. You don't have to wait for the animation.
---
If you've "won" the pie lottery, the claw will gently jerk to the side before moving left or right. If you've "lost," it will move to the left or right smoothly, drop, and miss.
---
Yes. Well 8pm, but the drive home and getting situated... I'll send you a message. Do you have power armor or a hazmat suit? There's one part that has radiation within the silo. If not, I think my lv 3 rad sponge should do the trick.
---
Nice!  
---
I'm just a nuke launch away, myself. Seemed like a hassle, so I've avoided it up 'til now.
---
The issue comes from if you leave the server after you've capt a workshop, you have to do it again on the next server. Unless by the gawds you rejoin the one you were on. I wish there was a "rejoin last server" option. Especially when you go thru the trouble of launching a nuke, just to dc when some asshole uses the poison PA and lags everyone out. Itd be nice to rejoin and not lose all that work
---
IKR!
---
Chameleon armor doesnt tend to sell too well as people only really look for 1 peice to use with another prefix.  I kept full chameleon sets in my vendor for a few months straight with no sales.  Ended up scriping them.
---
If you are looking to sell armors, what sells best are Vanguards, Unyielding, Bolstering and Troubleshooters (people like this for encryptid and silos), at least in my experience.
---
yes
---
I agree with waiting to jump to a private server for a bit. Whenever you need help, you will almost always find a higher level to help you out and answer questions you may have or direct you to where you need to go. If you want to learn the game before jumping into pvp, use private servers for workshops.
---
The scrap box is really nice. I got the sub for 1 month (for the emotes because I love mothman) and I went ahead and used the tent and the scrap box and now that my sub ended I really miss them. The extra free fast travel point was really handy for farming and now that I don't have the scrap box I am loathe to pick up more junk because I don't wanna put it in my stash.
---
It was mentioned before in a ITV I believe but that is all that is known. That they are looking into it.
---
QE Harpoons (ghoul and murmur), BE Pipe Revolvers (ghoul and murmur) BE Railway (murmrgh), TSE Laser (ghoul), BE MG42 (murmrgh), BE Pump (ghoul), Be/Ie/Je Handmades (ghoul and murmur), TSE DB Shotty (scorched, gutsy, murmrgh) and quite a few other useful ones.
---
There‚Äôs a trading implement in fallout, ‚Äútrade for caps‚Äù. Not real $$! The duper‚Äôs aren‚Äôt going to quit if they‚Äôre making money off it. And more my point is I‚Äôve seen the ads on eBay e.g the nuka quantum power armor paint- seller just paints your armor for you. Wanting $40 per paint job. 5 available 2 had already been sold! On this particular ad. Heck come to my camp pay 400 caps  for the plan do it whenever you want ( I have the dome key ‚Äúfrom grinding‚Äù) so I can continue to grab the plans! I‚Äôd never charge anyone real $$ for an item in a game!
---
I would make me laugh in the Santatron had lines for when the box was broken into/presents stolen. If only.
---
I think it is completely acceptable pvp event as long as high level guy's don't come off as bullies.. make it fun .. I got goo-ified by some OP weapon a player who was way over my level .. 267 vs 20 .. they got nothing cause I stored my junk.. guess what, it is no fun being the loser who has no chance to ever get a shot off or has no chance to do damage against a level 267 in power armor.  How this could have been fun for the level 267 I have no idea.  They just seemed like a jerk.  Makes ya wonder what they are like in real life?
---
Yes 1000 times yes!
---
Healing factor is a good one for sure if you don't use chems often, however it also reduces the potency of stims and rad aways so keep that in mind as well. My first playthrough, I farmed mutations at the waste disposal site near deathclaw Island. I would rad up, gain mutation, server hop. If I got one I didn't like, then I used a rad away to *hopefully* lose the ones I didn't want. It was a very long process to get to where I wanted. Now I can just craft the ones I want.

Yea no problem. I'm sure there are a few others but these seem to be the more easier things to acquire.
---
People with it in their vendor for 25k are doing it for the meme...
---
Thanks, it definitely wasn't there.  I'll check back again tomorrow, maybe a restart will work it's magic.
---
You'd die the moment you disembark.
---
Just lock it! Sorted.
---
I played fallout 4 and never got one. Then I was clearing the hospital and I was like "why not" and IT PICKED UP THE PIE. I was so excited... then the pie did not dispense. Turns out that pie machine is bugged and picks up the pie but doesn't give it.
---
ah its a console thing, the other guy said rubber bands too, and i was eyeing my rubber bands and my keyboard like... what?
---
I am definitely in favor of destroying as much of the value as possible for people buying things with real money for this game. 
---
On the other hand I don't really see how it impacts me very much. However they are duping it no longer seems to cause server problems and other people having better weapons has no real impact on the game.
---
Bethesda should do better at dealing with cheating but I think there are other things that are far more important to fix at this point.
---
You only need 3 tadpole badges to get the backpack. Possum badges are for the modifications for the backpack. You can get possum badges from doing the daily scout missions, so you don't necessarily need to earn them the hard way.
---
That's what they've been doing. Some of the atom shop stuff was assets from Fallout 4 that they expected people to pay for.
---
Instigating Gauss Rifle. 243 base damage (after mods), doubled if enemy is at full health, which is then doubled again with the sneak bonus. It's my favorite weapon.
---
I'd love to hear me some more Liam Neeson

I wish I could craft them but I am nowhere near ready enough to take on the queen. Unless I happen to find a nuke being dropped with a ton of high level players down there to work her so I could get in my shot and then go into a defensive mode
---
Why would anyone adopt a believability standpoint regarding Fallout?
---
You can do this on PC too, you just need to get a gamepad
---
Just found one. From Camp Adams, run south-south-west. If you look at the map, you should be directly south of the mountain next to Camp Adams, and almost directly west (a little north) of the line tree south of Camp Adams lookout.
---
There's some large wooden structure with a tree going through it (which you can use to climb up the structure), and, on the north side of the structure, there is an outhouse seat. Next to the seat is a sealed Charleston Herald, and on top of that is the Empty Can.
---
No they screw you over
---
ohhhhhhhhhh.
---
and putting it in a container, and then picking back up wouldnt work i guess?
---
I got one two days ago I was just rapidly snatching shit up after my massacre and found it in my loot later it wasn't legendary or the plan but the weapon itself plain
---
I thought as much!
---
Tell me about it brother. It's just getting old.
---
It could just be me, but was that a Secret Squirrel reference?
---
My friend has one how much do you offer?
---
I really hope this isn‚Äôt a joke and people are running around with lead pipes
---
I've been getting a ton of duplicate plans. The gifts are definitely worth it - would definitely recommend a little bit of farming if you have time but the gifts are great.
---
Don't worry, the raiding business is still booming!
---
Oh, man, my armor unequipped and I can't reload anymore.  Somebody must have slid down the slide at Wavy Willards!
---
Specifically on the AP cost, any automatic receiver is -50%, aligned barrel is -5%, and so is an aligned or forceful stock. A reflex sight saves 15%. So, with additive stacking, all those with the legendary effect should be enough for 100% reduction. Magazines are trickier, those that improve reload speed reduce AP cost by 5%, but anything that increases ammo capacity or armor penetration makes the AP cost worse. So, the quick magazine is best for making VATS cheaper, but it gives up the advantages of something like the stinging magazine of the handmade rifle.
---
Concentrated fire increases the hit chance by 10%, 15%, or 20% with each shot, depending on the rank (the third one makes it 95% after the fifth shot, even if it was only 1% initially). It also adds a small amount of extra damage.
---
Ok I thought that it was just me too. I powered up two power plants and the completion didn't trigger. Pisses me off because that is the last thing for me to complete to get that Badge. I'm on the PS4 too.
---
The game is fun but also a glitchy buggy mess at times which will lead   to levels of frustration. As long as you are prepared for that you should be okay. Equally frustrating at times are those brand ambassador that are so Pollyannaish in there support of the game that it is embarrassing. The opposite end of the spectrum is also present who will tell you the game is just terrible and unplayable, of course the extremes are rarely correct and at times will find yourself both praising and criticizing the game.
---
Just drink some Nukashine before going down. Eventually you‚Äôll end up at the bottom in water.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt even use melee cards I keep rifle cards and heavy weapon cards in place.  It still one shots most stuff. But the trade in value is only 5 scrip. No way.
---
Just finish the quest to turn on the water in the park, then the slides will work!
---
Unfortunately the queen no longer drops serum recipes. They pulled them out of the loot pool a while ago, I assume so people will have a cap sink and buy them at the bunker. I've been grinding caps for months and now almost have all of the recipes unlocked. Would not recommend the grind, but it is nice to have something useful to use the Flux on that only people can use as well. If you do decide to go for it then I suggest the top 3 of adrenal reaction, marsupial, and speed demon.
---
For only a great deal price of $25.00 you too, can hang 4 WHOLE baubles on your tree.
---
Oh. I didn't know about this.
---
8k
---
A fishing weight works for keyboards.
---
(but seriously, I've thought this would be a fun quest to do, if they had it, even just to see water flying everywhere)
---
And I just got another one :) What would be a reasonable prize? 1000 caps?
---
Finally! Thank you!
---
Purveyor gave me a BE15R Fixer which would have been pretty awesome if that gun didn't get duped and I could by one on eBay for $4.
---
Turns out the quad explosive radium that dropped for me when I was level 40 a year ago was the most awesome weapon that I got because it's the only weapon that didn't get duped and can't be bought on eBay. Kind of crazy since I built my entire character around that weapon and spent weeks farming springs, screws, circuits, and nuclear material to mod it. Hopefully Wastelanders will bring it the justice it deserves.
---
Enjoy wandering .. it is the really cool thing about the game ... Get the ability to build an in dirt water purifier by taking a workshop and building a water purifier.. remember taking a workshop is a pvp event so store your junk in the stash box you can place when you take the workshop.. this will prevent you loosing anything but caps if somebody kills you to take it from you.
---
Is raider power armor plans still rare considering they were rare before the event
---
I take workshops becuase of the pvp it‚Äôs a lot harder then the queen
---
Did you check your storage
---
Good idea I will surely try that out as I rarely move mine.
---
I stand corrected haha. I was going off of the spreadsheet that got linked in the comments already. The rest still should be correct though
---
I locked mine with lvl 3 the moment I placed it down.
---
Why lie bro?
---
I've not shopped at another Camp since this event began, but I've been getting plenty custom at mine. Which just gets spent on Wrapping Paper! Yass.
---
If your on Xbox I‚Äôm more then happy to just run around and help show you around
---
K but it's been common knowledge for over 5 months that they patched the pipe gun and not the revolver or bolt-action.
---
Is it in the light section I couldn‚Äôt find it after I bought it
---
Ah ok, I‚Äôve been away from the game for a while.
---
You sound like a COMMIE MAGGOT!
---
It doesn't. Neither buying it from a vending machine
---
My character isnt built around PvP.
---
Not from mine.
---
He is completely enclosed in a 4x4 room of his own, whenever he goes on a public servdr.
---
Also consider shielded brotherhood or shielded marine underarmor. I believe they add +3 strength. (could be +2, can't remember off the top of my head)
---
I still use the ammo factory from time to time because i don't wanna try to gather all the different resources to make my own but other than that workshops are pretty useless sadly other than quick XP when leveling. Since you can't pvp outside of the workshop I just claim and abandon them for plans and xp.
---
I only use and need my BE Handmade, it tears through everything!! (purchased for 25k and 10k 5.56)

Of course a Dense modded chest piece and Fireproof stop me from killing my self every 2 minutes. üëçüèª

It's not too new - people build entire camps under the map.
---
All you hear through your headset is the guy playing all star at full volume while whacking everything
---
Hey now you hush now with that info... if you leave your resource collectors or scrap bots open. It's free grabs. I love getting goodies from ppls camps. Plus it refills while the owner is distracted. It's like water purifications.
---
It's definitely good for the shills!
---
The easiest way for me to make my daily 1400 is one run of West Tek with my high luck character. Each assault rifle/laser rifle I loot comes at full durability and sells for 30-37 caps (with hard bargain and grape mentats). Toss in whatever chems you looted and it's all done in about 15 minutes!
---
They work for BGS, it's their job to show off the game. They're given atoms as part of that.
---
Wait so you lose those if you end your sub? It's not a purchase, more like a rent to own thing? That's bs if it is
---
um, because its not a lie. 
---
Most of the launch bugs are gone. 
---
If you think they are not, maybe you should play the game instead of listing to idiot view farmers on YouTube.

How do I revive someone with no friends that play the game lol
---
Agreed 100%. The Battle Royale genre is supposed to entail... Well, a BATTLE. Nuclear Winter is more of a Survival Royale in the sense that it doesn't necessarily reward victory in battle. It rewards survival of any sort, which encourages less skilled players to hide and sometimes literally even go AFK and WALK AWAY FROM THE GAME.
---
In addition to rewards for participating in battle, I believe there should be consequences to encourage players to actually play the game. For example, if a player stands in place for more than 60 seconds, light them up with a visual beacon and place them on the map for all players to see. Or maybe give them constant slap damage until they've moved at least 50 paces. Or send them back to the lobby with 0 XP for the round and disable the default team fill for that player.
---
This would encourage more active participation from all players, end the punishment that bush campers inflict on their teammates, and solve the problem that some players run into - being unable to find bush campers. It would also decrease server load by discouraging inactive players from using up server resources.
---
Thus post might get a lot of hate, but I say this only in the spirit of encouraging a more vibrant NW community and keeping the game true to its Battle Royale nature.

I play the game, shill. I just don't feel the need to lie to others and trick them into buying a dumpster fire.
---
So you're upset that people are upset you're attacking them when you're a higher level? Cussing and bitching seems an extremely appropriate response to being killed especially if it's obvious you're new and the person who just screwed you is not. Like if you like tormenting people for taking workshops so much their bitching should be music to your ears.
---
Honestly, nope. 
---
I was on for 5 hours today with no issues. They even fixed the santatron and it now correctly gives presents.

Food drains quickly.

I have some good armors but for weapons:

Tse 10mm smg,  my first tse ever from murmgh. 
---
JE lever action.  My first explosive gun ever back before the nerf. Still melts and its a level 35 dropped at uranium fever. 
---
BE pipe revolver. Just got this from a random legendary SB last month.
---
BSS mole gauntlet,  another random sbq drop
---
BSS +1 strength switchblade. Got this back in the whitesprings heyday.
---
Rarest plan ever was a tomahawk one last January and didn't realize it until I joined the trade sub. Too bad I learned it.ü§£

Rarest cosmetic was a white responder helmet I sold to someone way back last winter not knowing the value. ü§£
---
Today is Day 2.
---
Add more rewards to adventure mode instead. Enough with the nuclear winter crap, there is already too much you can get there
---
today will be day 2, the day 2 item unlocks in ~2 hours
---
Day 2 but didn‚Äôt start until 7pm EDT
---
PvP is broken I'm this game . Workshops aren't for pvp anymore
---
darn
---
Where did you get the plan to make the plasma grenades from? I need this and I'll be one badge from completion.
---
How
---
The tent disappears and cannot be placed down yes. But the scrap box if you keep but you cannot place things in it any more. You can still take things out of it and it will be used for when you're building/crafting but you cannot add more junk to it. You have to put new junk in your stash. It tells you all of this in the FO1st info.
---
why do you play if you dont like it?
---
I am too. Companions are one of my favorite parts of fallout. Spent all my time protecting Charon and doing chems with Hancock. I hope there's a new ghoul in town to hang out with.
---
I am cautiously optimistic. Trying to not get my hopes up too much but also really eager to see what they bring to the game.
---
They just disappear or die on their own sometimes (I think the latter might be caused by them getting stuck in geometry while the base is loading in). As far as I can tell, once they are gone they are gone for good. You gotta tame a new buddy.
---
Making a killing here, brother!
---
My piano is labeled AFK so I can be at my keyboard when I'm away from keyboard.
---
Thank you x
---
Damn... I actually laughed out loud at this, thanks for that.
---
Can you equip them?
---
They're releasing 1 a day until they're all out.
---
You are welcome.
---
It‚Äôs not broken. Unless you have a stealthboy and blue shooty thing. And workshops are pvp all day long....
---
You can always ask for help here in Reddit. That's how I did it. If you are on PC I will be glad to help you
---
You can hang lights on it, just have to get *creative*. Grab a horizontal power connector, place on side of trunk near base of limbs, continue 5 more times each one higher up and a bit clockwise each time, get your colored lights out and they can now hang off the power connectors. *Ta-da!*
---
Pro-tip: Use blinking colored lights, they look the best under the foliage.
---
You can get it from Christmas gifts
---
I got it.
---
Might check if you have a bunch of turrets or lights. They eat budget for breakfast.
---
I dropped them after drinking 1
---
Day 1 isn‚Äôt showing up in the Challenged tab (unless I‚Äôm blind) do I just need to get 10xp for the first one?
---
The plan says replica. The axe doesn't when you craft it
---
&gt;\-Non-mutated Miners that are STRONGLY opposed to robots and automation...
---
either that or some Mole Miners that don't shoot on sight like their brethren
---
What exactly does multiple ranks in concentrated fire do? I only run 1 rank right now. Should I be maxxing it?
---
100% broken. When a guy one kills me in a second what's the point. This simply isn't the mmo they wanted it to be and PvP on workshops is just denying a large section of content and gameplay from players.
---
Awesome thanks for clarification ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
How long do you wait for a game to matchmake roughly bro?
---
there's literally been 5 posts about this within the last 2 hours, use search instead of this redundancy
---
Iv just been looking for anyone selling dirt cheap scrip from farming scorched.
---
60% of the time, it works *every* time.
---
Xbox, but thanks. =)
---
Yeah, I got a Fox Head. ;)
---
Depends on where your camp is too. Not sure where you're camped at but I chock really out of the way camps as not worth hopping to unless I happen to be in the area for something else.
---
That's usually what il do. Il drop higher prices items by the 100s and lower priced by 10s. I can usually get rid of things that way. I have been away for awhile so I have to get back into the pricing since things have gone up and down. I don't even bother with the workbenchs cause even at 1 cap, no one ever grabs them. I resort to just hiding them in suitcases and all. 
---
I don't see why it would be needed to stabilize a infinite "fake" economy. It's the same thing as a player selling an item to another player from themselves, just with vending machine being the person with the items for sale. Id rather it be something that goes to new players cause I know I struggled with caps for a long time, and there's others out there who do also that I've felt the need to help
---
nope. i would like to hear it thought
---
I can't even get the wallpapers I have to work.  Where are they on the build menu?
---
Take multiple workshops in your server and build santas there too ;)
---
I think that changed with the last patch. Inert flux and purified water now weigh the same amount.
---
there's a holotape for that.
---
Yep. I can equip and use everything with no issues. It all does damage properly too and degrades with use.
---
As others have already pointed out Ron Perlman. Fucking legend.
---
Also Sophie Cortina (Curie/Miss Nannys in FO4).
---
&gt;Mole miners - purveyor proves they aren't all evil - is there more of them? Who are they whats a mole miner town look like. Do they all dress in cool versions of the mole miner suit? So much design and cool ideas could have gone into making their outfits unique so you could recognize them from a distance.
---
I'm throwing money at the screen but it's not working.
---
It‚Äôs more of a ‚Äòhigh end‚Äô tax on the players that have strong steady regular incomes of thousands upon thousands of caps each day. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me either, but that the ‚Äòexplanation‚Äô.
---
Crops can add up too!
---
LMAO yes! People don't get this at all. The workshop is PUBLIC. Claiming it means you are stealing it from everyone else on the server and hoarding it for yourself. Someone might have a problem with that.
---
A workshop is also a shortcut to get desirable materials. You know what else is a shortcut to get desirable materials? Killing the hoarder and taking it.
---
When someone claims a workshop, it already gives them a warning that they are agreeing to PvP. Maybe the following additional pop-ups need to be agreed to before a workshop can be taken over:
---
"You saw the message about player vs player, right? You're OK with this? I mean... Someone can kill you and take your stuff. Really think about this. Are you SURE you want to do this?"
---
"OK, pal, you seem adamant that you are OK with PvP. Not just OK, but you clearly WANT PvP. If you click OK again, you waive all rights to complain about this."
---
"You clicked OK AGAIN. You understand that your life is over now, right? People can kill you. To death. It's over. You're done. Enjoy the Workshop. You asked for this."
---
Anyone know how to get rid of one? Iv been thinking about doing it since mine keeps spawning in my living room.
---
You‚Äôve wildly miscalculated.
---
I disagree water is everywhere as long as u dont mind dirty water as far as food ive mostly eaten spoiled food since the game came out the water and food bar is just a minor annoyance even now
---
Anything stored takes up budget
---
Easy choice. 
---
"Everything is for sale friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second." -Belethor (Whiterun)
---
Yeah, totally better than just leaving them alone.
---
It's a dumb way to do it because your net gain is less than 1400 caps per day. With loot you get 1400. With serums you get 1400 - what you spent on serums.
---
People constantly complain about raising the daily cap cap, why make it even less efficient for yourself?
---
I‚Äôm a terrible person and like to push afk people into the nearest body of water or off a cliff. For some reason it just doesn‚Äôt get old.
---
Why would you want it?
---
*SPOILERS*
---
Her journey isnt over bud.  Come wastelanders you will pick up where the last one (the one from the bed and breakfast) leaves off.  We know she isn't dead cause she's in the trailer for Wastelanders ;)
---
They only returned for a limited time only last week, while yes it was scummy but that's just how it is.
---
Yep they do. It's where I've gotten all the ones I have.  Plenty of completionists out there who want to do the badge challenges though.  Just look at the price of plasma grenade plans, all because some people want to grind out that badge...
---
Yup I thought it was just my ps4 freezing up but it's done it alot the past two days. Always fun to see what gets screwed up from something being fixed. I got killed by a critter and dropped my loot when it froze up which was pretty frustrating since I had a ton of scrap.
---
Everyone should be making at least 2 Large Handmade Gifts per day with their 1400 caps. It's the best way to get the rare plans, and making caps isn't terribly hard.
---
Buy it for cheap
---
There's just no difference, none whatsoever, between paying for "1st" or paying the same amount on Ebay for your dream-item. It's the same morons who are paying. It might as well be someone in need, who takes this whale gamer-noob money.
---
&gt; simply making all legendaries untradeable. 
---
Sure it would kill the cheating, for the most part (maybe), but would also reduce social interaction. Trading is important to more than just cheaters. More than just for the economy, too. It's important for the social aspect and general fun in the game. As well as part of the entire point of the dearth NPCs in the game. If I want to give a legendary I'm not using to a friend, which I have done many times, I should be able to. And vice versa. It really helps with the grindy part of things. 
---
In short, I think that is just cutting off the nose to spite the face.
---
I've noticed this, but I assumed it was because I am pretty far from a scorched spawn location. I am way down south in the savage divide. I usually have a decent flow of customers because I usually have full machines with a large variety. I have had maybe 5 sales in the past 2 days, and I want to say 2 or 3 of those sales were mutation serums. I am holding off putting the plans from the event in my machines, hoping the value will go up when the event ends.
---
I know that, it's a pretty stale one at that.  Apparently it's either fooled enough new people that they think it's valuable, or the people buying mine want to carry on the dumb meme themselves.   I'm not too sure that's the case generally though or they would just go grab their own roof pies I would think.
---
I believe they can "attach" to windchimes too... WAY easier on the budget!
---
I took 400lbs of loot from one player, mostly lead. She kept attacking me and dying, again and again and again. Unbeknownst to her, I had already dropped the loot and had a friend come scoop it up to prevent it from being lost or weighing me down. She and her friends kept attacking me until they finally called in 2 PvP mercenaries to help them. Once they had me in a 5v1 fight with one of them in God Mode from the start, they managed to kill me. They quickly realized that I lacked any loot. At that point, she started sending me messages about what a horrible person I am, I had stolen loot from a kid, etc, etc.
---
Problem was, I knew who she was. She wasn't a kid, she was an incredibly toxic griefer who likes to pick on the helpless. I like to pick on the griefers and defend the helpless. She is exactly the kind of person who comes to Reddit and complains about "griefers" like me.
---
That is soooooo stupid... I say that because the scrap box IS AND WAS the only reason I got it. My stash went down like 500lbs after that. The tent is nice but I can live without it. Since then, we've gotten jack crap for FO1st. Just new colors for the same skin they gave us in the beginning. Sigh, sorry for the venting lol
---
So write your own post with your own concerns and stop being negative on mine. Respectfully saying.
---
Atleast they should fix up some roads and stuff with the caps we give them lol I bet they all go into Pete's/Todd's  character and he's just the richest man in the wastes right now.
---
I don't see anything called End Tables
---
0 seconds on Xbox. Probably several minutes on PC.
---
Right, right. Like the old proverb says: "give a man a fish, he eats for a day.  Teach a man to fish, he can hunt for giant irradiated bats."  It goes something like that.
---
Repair kits?
---
I have
---
Metal tables
---
Patio Table
---
Picnic Table
---
That option doesn't show up either.
---
Me too. I have a full on Mothman Church in my base. So eager to join them when Wastelanders rolls around
---
I'm looking for something cute to be fair lol a dress, or a nice outfit, some sort of accessory, am thinking of getting the prison collar, got tattered dress atm, cute and deadly feel to it
---
Building in Appalachia is a chore with all the egregious landscaping... let's move it to the Rocky Mountains! More steep unbuildable terrain but with the persistent bugs I'm sure we can all use the Bass glitch and clip into the mountain face :)
---
There's also a picture of what looks like the crashed space station converted into a city and a building in ash heap stating anyone that sets up in a place like this is up to no good which implies raider to me but also that those areas may finally have a purpose
---
It doesn't feel good when you need to rearrange a character completely (especially at high level) just to stand a chance because this game's developers don't seem to care about balance.
---
The guy who played The King in FO NV
---
"Skill" would be killing other players without needing to buff yourself up to god levels so you simply have higher numbers, and using an OP build. Farming chems and bobbleheads doesn't make you a better PVPer.
---
Maybe you have to activate it from the Atom shop?
---
Congrats, and welcome to the club :)
---
Can't wait till we get squirrel scout update!
---
I remember that quest!  I used to get that all the time!  Whatever happened to it??
---
Check out the fo76 Filthy Casuals sub reddit. We have a link to our discord in it. Lots of people to play with, and an active community that‚Äôs willing to help.
---
Or just more rewards all around? I would really like to see more skins added, but not just thru the atom shop
---
Oh God, I completely forgot about that lmao
---
Shit is it really that big üò≤üò≤üò≤
---
I highly recommend Filthy Casuals' Discord.  It's all about taking things easy, not getting worked up, and being sociable.
---
I met a guy that used wood armor with the weightless legendary effect and ultralight mods on it.  Ran a junkies sniper build with only 1 str when all was said and done and it was only a 1 because it couldnt go any lower.  Told me he needed everything to be less than two pounds all together and that was the only way.
---
Congrats I'm one mag away from it my self
---
It‚Äôs happening so bad for me it‚Äôs made the game unplayable. Blue screen every 10-25 minutes.
---
&gt;But honestly, most PvP players are aware of the whole "time and place" thing.
---
You mean, whatever you want to face off against? Like there's some honorable BS code you expect out of open world PVP. If it works, that's the "time and place" to use it.
---
Happening on PS4 too. This is the worst I‚Äôve seen the game since it launched.
---
As I have said in previous posts, it seems to be a dammed if they do, and dammed if they don't situation.  
---
I would love to see, a honest balance in this game, but after 2000+ hours in game. I have gotten to the point, of just playing the game, and whatever the outcome is, it is what it is!
---
I have experienced these issues, I have reported these issues, I have bitched and complained about these issues. And at the end of the day, it seems to useless. 
---
I just try to accept it as it is, make the best of my time, I  avoid what seems to be trouble, which is groups of people hanging around train stations, because I been grieved several times in those situations. 
---
I think my best experience in game was the beginning, before shit hit the fan, with all the controversys. 
---
I still think that this game has alot of potential. And I will always have a place in my heart for it. Even though I have my moments of hatred at times with it. 
---
At the end of the day, I have to remember it just a game. 
---
Nonetheless, I wish you and everyone the best!
---
No you're fine too. That's why I only wanted the one month - because I wasn't sure what would be coming / if the next month outfit would be worth and I'm glad I did because yeah I was kind of expecting a NEW outfit every month. I think I was expecting too much. And yeah my stash is so roomy. I don't wanna clutter it up haha. But holding out on getting another month until they release something I actually like.
---
Oh yeah I never thought of that.
---
I love all the mothman bits and pieces in this game. I will have something to say if they ruin my cult with Wastelanders.
---
I'd love a mole miner costume as well - I mean with so many cool concepts to be run with we got vanilla..... sigh....
---
Yeah I agree, I doubt I'd turn one down, just a shame what's happening to the game right now
---
You are suffering from dehydration.
---
You are suffering from starvation.
---
I kinda proves that hunting down a cannibal is a joke.
---
Why do people still have hope in Wastelanders? Lmao
---
Agreed wastelanders has been definitely been built up
---
If you take a workshop, it should be universally understood it‚Äôs a PvP zone. 
---
I suck at PvP, fortunately, I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt had anyone try and take it. Do the turrets help?  Or do they not target players? Idk.
---
So hard to get a food balance between decorations and stuff you interact with. Foundations and Roofs take up loads too!
---
I cant tell you how much this pisses me off. The minigun not firing has killed me in NW over and over because it wont fire LIKE ITS SUPPOSED TO. fix it bethesda
---
True. But that‚Äôs the whole point of the game, grinding for certain things. It‚Äôs exciting for me to grind for the rewards I get! There is still no need for real money transactions P2P. Caps exist in the game for a reason. Trade with caps or swap your weapons etc. If you don‚Äôt want to grind in game, what‚Äôs the point of even playing? Those type of players are probably the ones crying out they have nothing to do/ bored! I think it‚Äôs ridiculous, the duper‚Äôs/ cheaters aren‚Äôt going to stop if they‚Äôre making the money! Example I‚Äôve seen an ad on eBay where the seller was offering the nuka quantum power armor paint for $40 per job- they had 5 available with 2 sold. Heck come to my camp buy the plans from me for 400 caps and do it whenever you want. ( I have the dome key ‚Äúfrom grinding‚Äù) so I can grab the plans whenever! I would never buy/sell any items from the game for real $$.  It‚Äôs just a fucking game lol !!

We all have diabeetus

Congratulations!!üéâüéâü¶Ñ
---
I'm still a tadpole
---
I got shielded road leathers from a friend ages ago, probably this time last year, just haven‚Äôt landed the plan myself.  I appreciate the offer!
---
In the game files, they are the same item. Try crafting the Replica Grognak's Axe, and what you'll get is the Grognak's Axe (not a Replica Grognak's Axe).
---
I‚Äôve gotten 3 so far.
---
This is the way.
---
Unless they are gutting the game and returning to the base and starting over, I have no hope after this game breaking update.
---
Also nice. That's assuming I'm in my camp.
---
Sales are down a bit, but still doing ok.
---
1. TSE The Fixer (Murmgh)
---
2. TSE 10mm Pistol (Murmgh)
---
3. EE Harpoon Gun (Random Drop)
---
4. Plan: Plasma Granade (Small Holiday Gift today!)
---
**That's** some dedication right there! Excellent work! &lt;3
---
Im on xbox happend again 2 mins after i.posted that
---
I did testing on this a long time ago and I even mentioned it on this forum. Chameleon does impact PvE. As far as I surmise each piece granted a 20% ‚Äústealth field bonus‚Äù but most enemies do not require more than 3 pieces. I concluded that some enemies like the mutated crickets and assaultrons have higher perception and you can benefit from having more than 3 but not much.
---
I‚Äôve been away for awhile so I don‚Äôt know about the data mine but from my own evidence I would say that what was mined may not be correct
---
I can finally say the game is broken ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I lost hope in this game ages ago sadly
---
It is craftable on the armor bench once you buy the Mr. Claus outfit. You get the hat, beard, and suit.
---
After 7PM tonight, you'll beable to unlock theb2nd reward. Then 1, each day hence.
---
There hasn‚Äôt been an update today, or was there a special one for console?
---
Fair points. I, for one, am not near max caps, nor am I particularly worried about hitting the cap.
---
My way still gets me a profit for about 5 minutes of work every few game sessions. Farming enough random weapons and other junk to hit the 1400 cap cap is at least 15-20 minutes per session. If someone wants to spend their time farming west-tek or blackwater for scrap to sell, then that's great. I utilize that method when I have other reasons to be in the area (Uranium Fever, an urge to smash super mutants with a pick axe). But I have lots of things I want to do with my limited game time, and I like my method of increasing my caps. It's not pure profit, but it's a lot more time and effort efficient than farming a bunch of junk and crawling to a vendor.
---
I'll be online.  Hope I see you.
---
You have to physically go to the House of Scares to trigger it.
---
I earned the first one (wreath) yesterday and today at 7 pm EST, the second one will be released. 
---
Tomorrow 12/19 at 7 pm EST the third challenge will be released. So on and so on. And so forth. And so on.
---
Thanks to the both of you. This is what I was looking for
---
It's an unlisted part of the santa hat. Once you buy the outfit, you can amke the beard.
---
Can't wear it and the hat together in NW, though.
---
FO76 is a serious problem and Bethesda doesn't do enough. End thread.
---
It's beyond dev room right now. There are ways on PC to spawn in anything in the game files, even the FO4 assets that are not used in FO76 at all. You can spawn in NPCs or some blimp or the nuke animation. Or 5\* weapons/armor.
---
This is true. I got zero before maintenance, three since.
---
I heard they fixed the drop rates in the patch but I haven't been able to find any official info confirming it though
---
Heck no, I catch someone picking my locks they are facing the business end of my bloodied handmade :p
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Your example with your buddy's Tesla doesn't account for any of the factors that most people would come across. For example, no PvP player worth their salt uses a rifle build with a Tesla... The Tesla is a DPS weapon with a bugged arc function, so Automatic is the way to go... 
---
So just some rough math here... An AA Tesla that does 25 damage per hit AFTER energy resistance is taken into account could be converted into an automatic equivalent, which would do about 220 damage per second AFTER energy resistance without any perks. That would kill you in 2 seconds, assuming the attacker didn't warn you of their intentions so that you could get the "right circumstances" going.
---
Now, here's an example of something that might actually happen... A PvP player with a PvP Tesla... Let's go with a Bloodied FFR Tesla, would come at you with a little over 3,000 DPS without even arcing. Can you get yourself to 3100HP to survive that first second? If not, you aren't "dealing with a Tesla." You're a sparkly, blue ash pile on the floor.
---
It‚Äôs like Pok√©mon... gotta catch em all
---
No, I have my friends join a team, and they get kicked out in about 1 minute with that message.
---
Yeah, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really not. And I don‚Äôt mind the extra few dollars because I‚Äôd rather pay a little extra and only get what I want- than pay for a year and get stuff I don‚Äôt want or use.
---
tried the official site?
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376722/complete-fallout-76-maintenance-december-18-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
I have gone through the entire menu.  Page by page, slowly.  There's nothing there.
---
Not complaining about free stuff, complaining about being drawn to the Shop.
---
He has it automatic and he has the commando perks which is what you need to run the auto tesla rifle. I just typed it wrong is all. Idk anyone in their right mind that would dare run I to a pvp situation with a non automatic tesla rifle..lol.
---
That's how to help, thanks!
---
Assault Gas Mask is ugly too!
---
I up voted you, but there's only so many people in this subreddit with any connection to reality. Thanks for speaking the truth.
---
He should be under resources
---
Also you are aware that there is a cap damage that you can do in PVP, right? If your weapon says it does 5k damage. That's not what you can do to a person.
---
Especially if your companion guards your C.A.M.P.  imagine dogmeat destroying super mutants and such before your turrets lock on
---
Legendary SBs don‚Äôt get enough praise. I used to avoid them just to save ammo.  Now it‚Äôs ‚Äúeat lead cancer bat rarrrrrrrr‚Äù
---
Say what you will about a lot of the game, but the holiday events have so far all been good imho.
---
For wild drops the best was probably a B25 .50 cal. Had a TSE Handmade and Railway, but after the nerf. Other BE, B25, AAE, VE, but not on the best weapons. For some reason Mumbles loves giving me really nice pistols, but not so much with the rifles or heavies, which is what my characters use.
---
That's awesome! There's definitely a precedent for him making an appearance then, I can see him making the trip for memorabilia or something along those lines. I'd so enjoy a nod to that quest in a new one for 76.
---
They definitely fixed the issue were armor didn't take durability damage which sucks. I feel like now it breaks soo fast, its ridiculous.
---
I ran down a wanted level 20 player last night. Welcome to Appalachia, you dirty thief.
---
There‚Äôs only the other robot and the cow
---
Especially if your companion guards your C.A.M.P!!! Imagine dogmeat zeroing in on super mutants and such before your turrets lock on
---
Me too! I'd love to come visit, if that's cool with you. You'll get a gift coming to mine too! HeHe
---
Bloodied SS 90% reduced weight Grognak's Axe is my best world drop.
---
Mama Murmur gave me a QE Railway Rifle.
---
Two nights ago in Glassed Cavern I was being decimated by the SBs acid attack and wished for poison resist armor. The very next Santa Scorched I killed dropped a Zealots Scout Chest Piece with poison resist. Merry Christmas!
---
Don‚Äôt start shit you can‚Äôt finish, i.e. workshops and stealing.
---
Until someone fast travels to your camp and the walls don‚Äôt load so they can clip through them :‚Äô(
---
I spend 54k on large holiday gift wrap and made 74 large handmade holiday gifts.
---
You look like the main man from Shooglenifty!!
---
Yeah I‚Äôd be down! Not gonna be tonight because I just moved my base and it‚Äôs literally just a floor so I have to hop on and rebuild it because I got the ‚Äúobject is floating‚Äù bug but soon! If you want to add me tho my gamertag is Sinfirmitas :)
---
To be fair, I used DPS. A FFR Tesla hits over 11 times per second, so he's still a cool-looking pile of ash within a second.
---
Did you get the Santatron skin out of the Atomic Shop?
---
I believe you have to move right, to the alternate skin it is the same thing.
---
Yeah hopefully they‚Äôll have protections like in fallout 4 so they can‚Äôt be killed.  That was a life saver for me. I can‚Äôt tell you how much extra time I spent redoing quests in fallout 3 if Charon died and I hadn‚Äôt recently saved or if he bugged out. Would be nice if they extend those to our current camp pets too
---
Do u have to get the stuff the other robot I did get the skin
---
Wow, that must've taken a loooong time.
---
Nice one! I can help you out too, if you need. GT JaggersLips13
---
Appreciate the post üòÅüëç now he's being way more generous lol large gifts üéÅthank you üôè
---
His Tesla wouldn't be the kind you'd run into in combat, but any legit "PvP Tesla" would still have a player dead in the first second. The DPS is absurd even without the weird arcing damage effect.
---
Challenges will only show once they are unlocked. I also didnt see the Wreath challenge until i joined a NW match.
---
It just depends on what you hit per shot. You sound like your pretty good we should meet up for some tesla rifle testing...always looking to better my build for pvp it's all me and my friends do. I'd consider sider us top tier when it comes to pvp and only a few ppl we come across beat us. But who k ow if some of those are dupers of quantum and are spamming them...
---
Yea I'm sorry friend I'm confused at this point. Ppl run I to my friend all the time. So that is the kind of situation a lot of ppl are running into when it comes to me and my friends.
---
Big bend tunnel, glassed cavern, Camden park
---
Lock it up folks! I'll be on soon... ;)
---
Do you have a ton of space to store it all or something.  The last thing I have wanted since the event started is more scrip haha.  Keep finding myself saying " damn it , have to go see mmurrgh again"
---
Morgantown airport, Camden park, wavy Willards, glassed cavern.
---
What level are you?
---
I'm still looking for Unstoppables #3 and #4 to complete the Collector badge.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Had me rolling
---
I deleted everything i had stored.
---
Dumping it on a mule for after the event when I won‚Äôt have time to farm much.
---
1. Instigating explosive 90RW Tesla rifle (whitesprings)
---
2. Bloodied explosive minigun (purveyor)
---
3. Bloodied 50% vats crit lever action (purveyor)
---
4. Junkies explosive minigun (whitesprings)
---
5. Junkies explosive .50 Cal (glowing one near scorched earth)
---
I do have a lot of gourds, mutfruit and razorgrain.
---
When they attack me first?
---
Yeah, no. 
---
Don‚Äôt start none, won‚Äôt be none.
---
First go to the edit mode and on ps4 it is R1 I think. You see it on the top of the screen, you can switch between edit and wallpaper when you look at the wall
---
I haven't seen SNT drop Possum badges but I've only gotten through the base Tadpole quests (and gotten the backpack plan). I've just started working on Possum badge challenges.
---
My first two checks of the santatron junk box showed.... 2 small and 2 medium gifts.  I'm loving this.
---
I've got 4 Corn, 1 Mutfruit and 3 Gourds. Had a lot more but this keeps me stable with what I use.
---
What? I've never come across a full set of PA. Every frame has like 2 or 3 pieces, thas it.
---
You Xbox?
---
Kind of what I figured, makes sense.  I'm just too lazy to run multiple characters and don't care about caps enough to but I get it. I've been tempted to start a mule but....lazy like I said.
---
That's true but now it's like this SB ain't even legendary why waste the ammo or time
---
This event has been great. I've gotten more legendary gear than I can script. Haven't started opening the gifts yet &amp; already have a ton of those. I almost feel like Bethesda is rewarding us for sticking with the game. Even the daily &amp; weekly challenges have been very easy to burn through.
---
Your response actually helps to prove his point - he's arguing that NW requires more actual skill rather than gear. Your response is that you prefer being able to rely on your gear. Since gear isn't skill, you technically aren't disagreeing with him. 
---
As someone who is/was active in Adventure/Survival PvP and is active in Nuclear Winter, I can say with certainty that raw skill IS necessary in NW, whereas it is NOT necessary in Adventure. Most Adventure PvP players won't risk their reputations in NW. While they may be seen as gods in Adventure, getting wrecked in NW again and again makes people question why their Adventure "skill" doesn't carry over into NW. The answer is simple: VATS and legendary gear are crutches. If you want to see if a player has skill, take those away and see what's left.
---
NW isn't a different game. It's the next level. Show the world what you have when you don't have anything.
---
@ rockynotch
---
So increased from 0 to 1 per hour? Because literally that whole time zero were given
---
It will be posted everywhere when we know.
---
What do they do when they run into your friend?
---
No there were reports that during the first week not 1 single gift was given. It was a bug
---
Yea I always look forward to the holiday events for sure! And making SBs legendary should of happened right off the bat but better late than never. The community bitched that they were a resource dump with no benefit and they listened I guess which is kind of refreshing. I feel like I‚Äôve seen more legendaries in the past 3 days than I have in 3 months!
---
But the large wrap costs like 1200 caps, so you can buy only 25 or so before you run out of caps, no?
---
Nope. Every time someone asks, the date is pushed back another day.
---
I might try to reduce my mutfruit and razorgrain. In the end I must keep mo gourds cause its needed for cranberry relish.
---
The only mandatory mutation for a Bloodied build is ***Adrenal Reaction***. It stacks with the Bloodied effects of weapons and increases your damage at low HP to astronomical levels! It does have a big drawback of -50 hp that can be reduced to 12.5 hp with "***Class Freak 3"***
---
Some other mutations give added benefits though like ***Bird Bones*** will prevent you from dying every time you jump off a roof and ***Speed Demon*** will increase your movement &amp; reload speed. ***Scaly Skin*** adds DMG &amp; Energy Resistance. ***Healing Factor*** will stop you from going through Diluted Stimpacks like crazy, it gives 300% Health Regen and after you've cleared a group of enemies your health will just refill. ***Grounded*** is useful if you don't plan on using Energy weapons as it will reduce your energy gun damage but give you +100 energy resist. Others I recommend just for convenience would be ***Marsupial*** for the carry weight and jump height &amp;  ***Carnivore*** for eating all that raw meat you'll be collecting with no negative effects. Optional for team play would be ***Herd Mentality*** and ***Egg Head*** but make sure you pick the "***Strange In Numbers***" perk card under Charisma for maximum benefits. 
---
I believe I listed every mutation that I currently have and why, but I'm sure you can pick and choose your own if you decide to go down that path!
---
They did an emergency patch to take out exploited weapons (the 5 stars) and also GREATLY raised the chances of getting a gift from the Santatrons
---
When is it due?
---
What time can i expect it?
---
Does it have an eta ;)
---
I actually don't use Teslas lol. I consider them a sign of a trash player. Using them in PvP is ko better than hacking NW on PC. It doesn't make you good, it makes you trash. My primary is a FFR Handmade. I don't carry Quantums, Stealth Boys, or anything of that nature. I can aim without VATS. I hold myself to a higher standard when it comes to PvP.
---
Morgantown airport and high-school has plenty of scorched.
---
Lol figured. Just felt like a good old circlejerk of wtf when is this delayed product due. Ty for the answer
---
If you're on PS4 and willing to trade for them, I'd be interested.
---
I have only played about 2 hours, two 1 hour sessions with no gift
---
Digging where? It‚Äôs a fucking space ship.
---
After 4 attempts and 4 crashes I gave up on it
---
Talking Mothman biblical-ishness is my specialty :)
---
Those who do not walk the path, fear not. You are but a young directionless moth, fooled by the summer's full moon. Open your heart and he will find you and you shall walk the path.
---
Me too xbox worst ive seen it in along time
---
Nobody is running around with vanilla lead pipes, they need to be modded and nocturnal.
---
I assumed this is the case
---
Yup this was a good idea for sure. I also like that it‚Äôs not a timid event so you don‚Äôt have to drop everything to rush to somewhere ASAP because the damn thing is over in 2 minutes! Also it was good how they put a lot of rare and expensive plans in the loot pool! Yea an outfit would of been cool but getting access to plans that otherwise are damn near impossible to get is actually nice (if your a player like me who just likes to learn all the plans that is, even if you have 0 intention of ever crafting any of them!).
---
Alright then, my bad. I'm so used to people complaining about people in bushes. If you see a bush that you don't like, just shoot it. These bush wookies are scared little rabbits by nature. They'll run at the first sign of danger. Usually all it takes is the sound of gunfire or an explosion, and they're running for their lives.
---
quarter 1 of 2020. So anytime between january thru march is what bethesda is hoping to have it done
---
Can I buy one of those plasma grenade plans? I'm on PS4.
---
I think I‚Äôm holding either or 11 or 12 badges on my main character right now, almost all exclusively from those two quests.
---
Any time I get bored I grind those for a little while just to give me a savings account that doesn‚Äôt weigh anything in my stash lol.
---
Ok, thanks, I'm on PC but I'll try the same general process.
---
PC sorry.
---
So is my junk
---
I feel yah my main 3 spots i go to i may get 4 with out the airport event
---
Yes. That is the solution.
---
I have 15 agility and a full set of unyielding armour and no chameleon mutation.
---
I can have the SBQ directly in front of me, shoot her in the face and remain undetected.
---
Since the raids dropped they upped poison damage a bunch and ghouls hit harder than before.  Once you get used to the changes though it's still super easy not to die and the game is still too fricken easy.
---
I can craft you a regular heavy left leg, that way the style matches up
---
Any update on this? Also why was OP banned? This doesn‚Äôt seem to break any of the posted rules. This is all old information that has no bearing on the current patch version of the game.
---
u/MisterWoodhouse
---
Yes that's cool. Thanks.
---
I'm offline now and i go to sleepüëã gn8
---
Good luck. I hope you are not successful because I honestly cannot stand frivolous lawsuits. But respect your right to have your day. I hope you are honest and include all facts, not just those that fit your narrative. I‚Äôve been hard on you but don‚Äôt take that personally. We live in an overly litigious society and I have a fundamental problem with people overreacting and wanting to a sue a service provider who decides they want to add or alter services. It‚Äôs anti innovation. This isn‚Äôt the same as going into a store, asking to buy a mario game and them giving you something completely different and refusing to refund your money. That would be a breach.
---
Anyway i really am done arguing. I‚Äôll wait to see this thrown out. I promise I won‚Äôt gloat. I hope you continue to enjoy the game.
---
Wow man that's SO AWESOME
---
I, for one, have killed more Scorchbeasts in the last 36 hours than I have previously killed in total, and I have been playing since the game launched.   (Of course,  at le level 162, they aren't quite as fearsome at they once were, but still....  üòâ)
---
I thought they always collected gifts but it was a 1% chance
---
I gotchu homie
---
Lol I use to run from them but yea they only take a mag or 2 to bring down, well worth the ammo if you ask me. Gotta love that sweet sweet scrip! Even tho your going to get total shit in return for it anyways. The endless cycle of scrip, buy, rescrip... but what else are we going to do?!
---
Your loot list is 200 items long. You have to run around and loot 200 other items to push the items off the list and have then available again. Since I started have 1st and the scrap box, I just pick up literally everything, everywhere I go.
---
Loot states are frequently character-based.  It's not universal, but it's pretty prevalent.  So yes, there are some things that will stay looted when you hop servers, and that does include 'private servers' (which are just regular servers with added security).
---
That‚Äôs not a glitch I‚Äôve seen but I‚Äôm on Xbox.  No, I can see them go down in percentage.  Some have said fast travel spends them a bit faster.  Maybe but the pace seems faster than it has been.  It also might be the traffic on the servers now.  More people doing more equals more people needing more cores means any one person has to search longer and cover more of the map.
---
I brought my caps down to 5 k from just getting the gifts so I didn't have to grind as much. Plan on making a level 4 next to try for that plasma plan
---
They shouldn‚Äôt have messed with spawn rates if they did. It‚Äôs not like every single scorched was a holiday version.
---
Ok I didn't know about a stacking loot list. That would make sense. I guess logs are considered containers just like others.
---
Big Bend Tunnel.
---
Camden Park (a few dailies for extra scrip here too)
---
Glassed Cavern (run it, then mine an ultracite node and they will respawn, rinse, repeat)  
---
These are the 3 areas I use.
---
I learned that lesson a couple of weeks ago.  Now if the game freezes and there were any enemies nearby I log out ASAP.
---
It's just RNG. Sometimes I'll get 10 from poseidon/thunder mountain, sometimes I get 2 or 3. It's the same process that decides legendaries, just with a higher spawn rate. I ran for like 10 minutes when I got home and found 4 at poseidon, didn't even go inside.
---
