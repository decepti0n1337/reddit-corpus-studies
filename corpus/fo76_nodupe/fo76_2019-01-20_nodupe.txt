A side.... Distraction.
---
---
---
SO Im good with my TSE Shotgun? Sweet, thanks
---
Photomode was one of the best additions. Really hope they keep it for future Fallout and Elder Scrolls games.
---
That won't be a problem soon, you just have to outrun melee users now
---
&gt;I will keep MY account. 
---

---
As you've already hinted at having multiple accounts, and the ones to get banned won't be yours, I'm sure you've acquired them legally without fucking over other people.
---
Omw
---
Can't stop won't stop!
---
Yes? Which type of block? The option exists as I’ve accidentally blocked friends before but it’s on the basis that you still have access to their name to select the option
---
Not a duper.  I just have the recipe.
---
Thank for that info, just hopefully they wont be dropped every blue moon
---
why then there's another option: to block for session?
---
That's true. The DPR differential to, say, a 2S Gatling is large. Still fun. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrt!
---
I have the plan...
---
Yeah the screech is totally broken, and is even worse when you getvstuck in a chain of being instantly spawn killed by them while trying to retrieve your loot, or simply get away because of the spawn locarion bug.
---
Im fine with the lore stuff, but they are really broken right now.
---
Stop being condescending and help me out. Gatling plasma is like the heavy weapon gatling gun but uses plasma instead of bullets -- does that mean gating plasma is a heavy weapon?
---
I've seen this once before, weeks ago on this sub. And I've never been able to find it myself in game.
---
Can you tell me which fridge this in op? I'm not sure if I'm blind or haven't been to the location yet
---
Just message me...
---
No, I'm making fun of the fact there are several plans with the same or similar name, no one knows if they have them, and no one can see what they make in the purchase menu.
---
Sell for more, youll get it. Especially with people moving to bloodied. 
---
Well hell..
---
What about the stripper pole? If he gonna need a license for that too?
---
What is your problem if I do enter it and get my account banned.
---
Why does my decision impact you in any way?
---
I know the consequences, and dont feel like risking it. I find this whole thing pretty funny though.
---
It’s Still an issue! Just got robbed yesterday for a bunch of plans!!!!!!
---
:(
---
I carry 4 or 5 melee weapons for different situations. Most are only a pound or less. With faster swing speed perks a medium weapon can swing super fast and do really good damage. Plus you wont hog all the kills and no bullets. 
---
I found with the right Mods T60 is just as high and more balanced.
---
I see that and all I can think is "Secret basement?". I need to know for sure.
---
Oh! There should SO be an Elmer Fudd shotgun! It would be wery, wery quiet (suppressed) of course, do double damage to animals but there'd be a 5% chance that you'll shoot yourself in the face!
---
It's pretty obvious yes.
---
Oh shit that’s awesome. My camp is on the edge of the golf course. 
---
I have a gauss rifle that I use to get the keycard, I look up the code on nuka crypt and at this point I'm so used to running the silos Its the easiest part. 
---
I've been posting occasionally.  Yours is the first response I've gotten.  If that's any indication I'm right where I think is fair.
---
Factions can work as it is. Players would be Raiders, or Responders, or Brotherhood, or Enclave, etc. There could be PvP Events where different factions, which players on the server have aligned themselves with, fight over resource points to control areas of the map, which then grants a bonus to all players of that faction. 
---
There was a game, and it was a MMO so many more players, but Rising Force Online had Chip Wars 3 times a day where 3 factions would fight it out for control of the mining resources in the game. After the Chip War all players of that faction would be able to mine in peace, though it did encourage AFK mining, which may not be such a great thing. But the idea in essence is good. Another was in World of Warcraft when your faction defeated a certain raid boss the whole faction if present in the capital at the time got a buff. 
---
They could do a lot with the factions, and it wouldn't need to be all PvP focused, but that could play a role at least. It is difficult because the servers are small and with crashes and disconnects, and people joining and leaving, nothing has any kind of permanence. Maybe there could be a way to tie all servers together. Like events happening on all servers at the same time, and things you can do to gain points for your faction. But then there are the issues of faction imbalance. What if most people like to be Brotherhood or Raiders. Then in something where numbers matter they win most of the time, so there would have to be some way to account for that also. 
---
It's tricky stuff to balance. I honestly don't know and I  just use some examples I have seen and some thoughts of my own but I'm sure if people really sat down and thought about it for a while there are a lot of cool things that could be done.
---
An exploding electric smoke ring.
---
Mirelurk King has a more reasonable sonic attack. Or maybe it's wind? I have no idea.
---
Yes I am. GT is statesidellama. I'm not on atm but I'll send you a message when I am. 
---
Yeah I just wanted to know that because I already have starched genes rank 2
---
Ah nice! I'd love marsupial 
---
Can't disagree there. It just seems like that is the opposite devs want currently by putting pve and pvp players together. Personally I think the devs are dumb as shit if they truly think pve players want to play with pvp players. They must think somehow its a good idea or else they would be quick to say it's clearly not a good idea.
---
End of the day, separate servers would be a better idea for sure. 
---
That makes your opinion trash and not count 
---
It's any TSE or TS or E or Bloodied or that one guy...what was he called?...Ben! I think it was Ben.
---
I am over way over level 100 and I still love checking out the bases other people build. I also do a lot of workshop defense missions to get plans but I have never taken over a workshop from someone else. I always see a lot of worried lower level players when I am checking things out :P
---
I havent actually seen anyone really blow up other peoples base unless they build at the Whitesprings. I am not saying those kinds of people dont exsist I am just saying unless you have actually experienced it then there is no need to jump to conclusions. You might miss out on meeting some really interesting people.
---
In regards to nuking your base, are you talking about getting an actual nuke sent to your base? I mean that seems like a lot of effort and you get A LOT of notice before it actually drops so I dont understand how that is a thing.
---
If you want to grief, go play Minecraft or Rust.  Fallout 76 is designed specifically to make that sort of gameplay undesirable.  The dev's have come out and said that that was their intention.  They're not going to make a special server for all the sad losers who get a kick from hindering other players' progress and just generally rustling jimmies.
---
I love sightseeing. Exploring. In games or real life. Just walk everywhere, see every nook and corner. Old houses. Vistas. Alleyways. Hidden spaces. 
---
The Assassins Creed series is a gold mine for me. Never finished Fallout 3 and Oblivion because stuff there was too repeating, not enough variation. GTAV was grand, as long as I was in a car. Being on foot or going offroad and I found the world lacking details. Contrast to Watch Dogs 1 &amp; 2 where being a pedestrian was a lot more enjoyable. Even non-open-world games like Dishonored has a lot of exploration. And I REALLY want RDR2 for PC because the first one was pure art.
---
The games become even more playable the more dynamic the levels are. Various weather effects and day-night cycle makes it even more exiting to wander trough places I've already been. Varying enemies, abilities, weapons and difficulties makes the gameplay more fun (but too much randomness can ruin a game too). And having other players in the game makes it even more unpredictable and enjoyable. But if the only interactivity I get with other players is shooting (or avoiding) them, it kinda negates the fun of meeting them.
---
So thats why I love Fallout 76.
---
I have the quest done, I can kill bots in front of other bots and they dont attack me. 
---
Yeah sounds like you didn't play previous FO4 games, you need to pick points for your build. Best to look at some youtube videos before you start, I don't think you can go too wrong unless you a perfectionist, I suppose you can but you would have to try hard to. 
---
I personally went with Melee and decided to build my Strength and Charisma trees earlier on. Problem is once you pick a tree is hard to correct your errors. At level 50 you can respec, but it will take a very long time, so best to try get it right in the beginning.
---
Also search this sub for builds, people have suggest different things.
---
Also go here, you can do a pre build and ask peoples advice once you think you know which direction you going to go. Strength is going to be key in this game, it can get rough early on with the lack of weapons, but by the time you level 15, you should be able to be in a position to take care of yourself.

---
new bug then, i guess.
---
Wow you caught me fair and square, I have 500 accounts and over 6 million gold and im planning over on taking the game with my army of duped instant kill items using a bunch of multiboxers, this will completely derail the fallout 76 servers and bethesda will retire and all become movie stars in robot porn.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But no to be serious, I have one account, havent played in quite a while, and at this point am just speculating. You can keep witch hunting me man, but uhhh guess you caught me.
---
Also there are iron nodes all over the mountains there too. You can get about 12 nodes (×4 if u use power armor)
---
And if you server hop they respawn. So tons of steel in a few hops. 
---
Youll just need acid to smelt. But uts not that hard to get. Anglers drop 6 at a time i believe. 
---
I dedicate one day a week to collecting all the materials and making bullets. Its made things so so much better. 
---
the extractors were like 90 workshop resources im mainyl mad i lost my fertilizers
---
Haha...thought my looting instead of reloading was bad. This sounds worse.
---
Nah, I accidentally found out how strong adrenal reaction was when I was trying to farm up marsupial on my melee toon. I noticed my hammer was suddenly doing almost 3x the damage it was before and I nearly shat myself. The mutation is overtuned and I love it. It's also how you saw all those TSE weapons sitting at like 3k damage that were posted all over this subreddit a while back. TSE with the right perks is essentially a 6x damage weapon so multiply that by 2.8 ish and you're looking at a 16-17x damage weapon.
---
Lol why are so many people REEEEing post patch by making posts saying “I’m going to actively try to break the game even more than it already is because the devs aren’t moving fast enough.”
---
I'm no longer concerned about your account being banned.
---
I'm now concerned about the players you've stolen your alternate accounts from.
---
You are a verified total piece of shit.
---
Like that exactly. I’ve had so many moments where I simply have to look away because I feel like I’ll have a seizure
---
I also had a sweey 4 hour run this morning. Took Graf steel, Poseidon, and gorge junkyard. Ran every event I could find in between "defend the..." missions. Teamed up with some level 20 somethings and helped them with Violent Night.
---
Then Patrol Duty popped up, and after a 106 levels I finally got the handmade plans.
---
To paraphrase Ice T, "Today was a good day, cause I can finally build an AK." 
---
Thes One and Double K Easter egg confirmed. 
---
&gt; So of course, he knew how to dupe bobbleheads, in order to stack them  and be able to one-shot players, even ignoring this "slap damage"  system! 
---
I thought that was debunked?
---
You and I could have some amazing conversations.
---
Unfortunately, you have to express yourself here monosyllabically, and always punch down. Anything less gets you downvoted to oblivion.
---
That in itself means nothing of course, if you have a healthy sense of detachment between internalized self-worth and the perception of strangers. But it can mean offering a plea of reason to an abyss dominated by the lord of the flies.
---
I though the block players was simply to option to block for a session
---
What is TS/E?
---
Dude this post was 2 months ago. How'd ya find it? 
---
the first time it happened in my head i was thinking i was dead but they gave me 4 mini nukes
---
Imagine your buddy is getting wrecked by a player who keeps healing due to his ghoulish mutation and the area. You snipe his ass with a anti mutation syringe and they lose ghoulish completely. LOL
---
Legendary Glowing Behemoth or something -- exactly. And guarantee 3-star drops please.
---
To make them move fast enough, of course!
---
"  **Today was a Good Day**  "

and yet...

" C'mon Beth, get your shit together!! "
---
Combat all the way. Put a drum magazine and hardened receiver on it.
---
I'll be on later and will take 5 of them if you've got that many. 
---
I have the quest done and bots auto aggro me. Interesting.
---
I can look the other way on that one... as long as the other way is in the direction of the dancer. 
---
Post it at fo76bazaar
---
Debunked? I just tested it lol.
---
P.S. sorry, level 42 player at Munitions Factory.
---
Of course, a lot of work needs to be done. That was a key part of bethesdas roadmap considering its the first multiplayer game theyve done
---
Get the fuck out of here dude.
---
Go back to you edgy af exploit community.
---
I think the halloween costume is from a dead trick or treater which is a random encounter
---
I never stole any accounts bro, and you have thrown new assumptions at me every time your old one falls through, All I am trying to do is have a civil discussion, I will not be responding to any more of your posts, we will let the mods deal with you.
---
Great. Should be easy enough for you to post a video then, right?
---
Wait it's capped at 30?!  I thought it was 30%
---
Can we just renamed Whitesprings golf club to Whitesprings casino?
---
For real why do PvP players and the slot machine junkies need to ruin the game for the other 98% of Fallout 76 players?
---
It must've been something else... did they specifically state this in an email I'm a hoarder who's constantly dumping crap because I obsesively compusivly pick up and scrap everything I see (I have issues) I've found myself with over 4k wood before (never 5k)
---
your secret's safe with me 😉
---
It's on the Data tab, plus, if you're not in Quick-Boy view, it's below the screen on the right, next to the in game date. See this pic, says 23 Oct 2102 **1131**.

---
And nobody I know got killed in south central LA.
---
Hiw does anti armor stack anyway?  If you had both stabilized and the legendary effect, I assume it would be something like 60% pen?
---
Nothing about you is civil.
---
Burden of proof is on the accuser. You claim Heavy Weapons are good. So prove it bitch. I'll wait baby
---
Why on earth anyone would make a 2.5 hour review of a video game let alone watch one is beyond me.  Play the game, don't play the game, there's more to life than this.
---
No. No, no, no. No! Don't you fucking dare put an idea like that into the heads of BGS. I already paid $60 for what feels like less than half a game sometimes, and have decided never to preorder another one of their games in the future due to it. If they add anything but cosmetics to the Atom Shop (which IMO has no place in FO to begin with) I can guarantee I won't be the only one boycotting this game.
---
"Excuse me what the fuck" isn't expressing raw confusion though. 
---
It is expressing complete and utter astonishment/disbelief. It is kind of like an exaggerated what the fuck.
---
Interesting. I’ve had a 3* handmade for a couple weeks and it gets say 200ish damage. That’s with rifleman perks. Everyone bitching about how superior they are I was like...umm yeah it’s double better again being a two shot but it is not  gods hammer.   If I had perks, mutations and even a single bobble head stacked it does sound pretty crazy. Lol. They should have just max capped it.  But that’s just like my opinion man. I sure as heck wasn’t one shorting any scorchbeasts with 200 damage!  I was blowing myself up occasionally though. LOL   And man if there is a car anywhere near anything you shoot towards it blows up my team and damn enemy will still be alive. LOL.  
---
I wasnt aware of that tbh. Private servers with whatever future content we may get will be great for the solo old school fallout fans. Personally I dig the multi player aspects. I'm curious of what the new pvp will be I hope it's as hardcore as ark or rust lol
---
Same build, and I have a combat shotgun with piercing mag which had bailed me out several times when being swarmed by glowing ones
---
Yes furious is capped to about 15% I have tested it myself.
---
By nerfing two shot AND explosive they started digging a hole. If they had JUST nerfed explosive this wouldn’t be an issue.
---
I crashed out right after nuke fell. Good luck guys!
---
&gt; Also, nice more interesting PA skins and character apparell that is immersive and not stupid.
---
The question though is how much of that stuff should be cash shop item-only and how much of that stuff should be obtainable in-game.  The goofier stuff that doesn't fit with the game normally makes sense to have in the Atom Shop.  Making badass outfits or such Atom Shop only when they look like they should fit in the game world and be obtainable in the game world would be potentially irritating/bothersome.

I asked a level 238 at Whitesprings to please share and he laughed and told me that they respawn. 
---
People just don’t care. They act like this is a single player game and you’re an extra and of no consequence to them. 
---
In Fallout 4 I always rename my armor, e.g. a set of leather with various effects:
---
     HD Leather Sharp
---
    .CH Leather
---
    :AL Leather Chameleon
---
    :AR Leather Sentinel
---
    :LL Leather Acrobat
---
Now, granted, it's pretty terse and ugly and not very easy to read if you're new to it, but it makes life so much better.
---
(Note that the first character is either a space, a period, or a colon, to force the head/chest/arms/legs order in spite of alphabetical order.)
---
I'm not saying BGS ought to do this, but there has to be some happy medium between what I do and what this game does that would work a lot better.
---
To be fair here, I am level 102 on my main, 70 on an alt and have 140 hours since beta launched. 
---
I have never done this quest yet. 
---
Well... can't think of *anybody* that'd be thrilled with wood armor; but damn: I'd do some *things* for a decent legendary hunting rifle!
---
I'd like to see a Syringer that shoots the hallucinogenic stuff from the palace of the winding path. It would be pretty funny to shoot someone and make them see a Deathclaw or Goul chase them that isn't there or even a non existent Mothman/Flatwoods monster for them to chase through the woods. No loot on them of course, just a client side only apparition to mess with them.

Here you go.

Yesterday while wearing PA. Fast traveled from Lewisburg to 3 places black screen except hud
---
Rebooted each time and corrected it but still reoccurred.
---
Finally logging off and hadn’t seen it since 
---
Fingers crossed 🤞 
---
If you're only level 35 you really don't need to farm legendaries. Wait until you're 50 so there's a better chance they'll drop at a high level.
---
I have terrible luck with everything in this game. Rarely find plans, haven't seen a TSE despite being level 90+. But one day, I decided to try farm this dude, and got it on the 3rd server hop, AND he had the hunter's coat which is what I wanted. I only JUST had enough caps to buy it, but I was so happy and ignore my shitty luck from then on. Lol. 
---
Over the course of the seasons they could make humans return to the area, reclaiming what they've lost to the scorched. Slowly repopulating towns and farms again until in the end the last scorched threats would come from the fissure sites with large invasion events where players help the human NPCs defend towns.
---
Tensions would ride between BoS, enclave, responders and the free States and eventually faction warfare could be reintroduced next to the lesser scorch threat.
---
Hey
---
No... Bethesda has our informations so let's hope they'll fix it soon.
---
Until then don't move your camp! We gained +10% phantom budget with moving, I've read some people are at 80% and even more.
---
I was at 30% before I noticed. Somehow it went back to 10% tho when I first build, then stored, something new, but Idk if this is reproducable. I don't wanna try.
---
I'll let you know if something new is coming up and I'd appreciate any new informations, too.
---
Sure thing, here you go: https://youtu.be/X-6MCkUOftI

Hunter v hunted can be a good time, need 4 people though. That might be tough for you after this post.
---
Yeah I finally got sick of it and found a guy on reddit who builds ultracite calibrated shocks for 2000 caps.  I consider that a steal, because even if I finally go the plans from the queen,  I probably wouldn't have enough of the right flux to build the damn things. 
---
This type of RNG crap is why duping is so rampant. 
---
When you create a game world where characters become powerful by just getting lucky enough to  and find the right mods/ weapons (as opposed to smart perk investment and grinding), of course people are going to try to find a way around it. 
---
Imagine of two- shot explosive weapons were very expensive vendor items only obtainable after killing X number of queens, (as opposed to  random drops). 
---
Would duping be as rampant?   
---
It's possible that it would not be. 
---
Ok
---
Molotov is a lifesaver. Toss, tag enemies, pick up loot after the TSE is done. Easy peezy.
---
Wait...scorchbeasts inside the nuke zone drop plans?
---
If they're quitting, what does it matter?
---
I picked that door 
---
It multiplies the remaining armor together--Stabilized has 45% AP, for 55% effective armor, while the AP legendary effect has 50%. Taken together, the target takes damage as if they had only 27.5% (50% of 55%) of their normal armor.
---
Hit me up on PC, i got the plans
---
&gt;new assumptions at me every time your old one falls through
---
My third comment on this thread accused you of acquiring accounts illegally.
---
Which one of my accusations fell through exactly?
---
Your feeling is correct. 3 3 tier shotgun cards. One 3 tier for weight and another for spread, I think. Plus enforcer.
---
Don’t buy it if you plan to do other things like buy groceries, work or have a life lolz
---
This freaking game eats a lot of my time. A lot of time lolz
---
Or you could have zero turrets and a big sexy house
---
I’m building weapons for new players if you’d like one!
---
On the roof of watoga high school, too (or whatever the big red building next to the train station is).
---
I didn't know about the one at transit behind a locked door, though. Thanks for the heads up
---
I spent last night building a pyramid so I don't see why not. I'd say go for it!
---
I no longer need Hunter Hunted. I can kill anyone.
---
I've only ever seen them from Modus. Got both calibrated shocks, stealth boy, targeting hud, and the bracers I was after (can't remember which now) from just a few hours of server hopping one day. I must have been pretty lucky, but it wasn't right at server reset or anything, so it is attainable.
---
Where do you learn serums?
---
I felt like I was just in that situation 
---
I agree with many of your points. I happen to think dealing with Demo Perk would be the easiest way to tone down TSE. Running without Demo is huge I noticed it right away when I forget to put it on in nuke zones.  I think the cut is way to harsh. They need to put the effort into see what changing perk cards will do for damage. While they may have to nerf explosive damage which I'm ok with, I think nerfing 2 shot down 75% for second shot is overkill.
---
I have noticed many subtle changes already made in recent patches not because of patch notes told us so but because I can see them in game. I'm getting thirstier and hungrier within the last patch or two. Is just one of the subtle differences I've noticed in my 400-500 hours of game play. They need to put time MONEY and patience into the game. Bethesda we have been patient with you-you need to show the same respect for your consumers.
---
Twoshot and explosive
---
Obviously auto correct, were you really not able to decipher that? But yeah, there already is a question mark emote. Is that not good enough for you? 
---
I guess my point is, I feel like the engine knows what works good with your build and gives you the opposite. Like it's trying to force collaboration or something. 
---
Hardly unique enough to deserve it's own emote though and like I said the confused emote is sufficient enough. There is easily dozens of more deserving emotes than some meme.
---
The rat horde event just teleported me into the 4th floor of Fort Defiance. All the rats spawned within a couple meters of each other in a pile. The event's map marker was at Appalachian Antiques to the east.
---
Kind of scary since teleporting to the wrong place could get you banned now.

What? They have the same layout? I’ve only ever  hit Alpha
---
&gt;Ask me any questions.
---
Yeah, I'm just getting to end game, just need the ten commendations. What type of content should I be looking at before I start killing batdragons en masse, as well as furry Alduin? I play mostly shotgun, with most of my points in strength and intelligence. Have been thinking anti-armor was the way to go with my side spiked fire axe, which is great whenever I have ammo concerns.
---
I agree I've seen this countless times in my 400-500 hours of gameplay
---
Yeah.  Almost out of bullets, opened a box that litterally dropped *right at the lead vein I was farming.  10 cap wanted.
---
Not 3 minutes later some dude insta gibbed me with what looked like a sparkle gun.
---
10 second run back to my body, stranger logged out with my 300 oil, 150 adhesive etc I'd scrounged up trying to find bullets.
---
Sure am glad i gave up all my fo76 storyline for the thrill of unwanted pvp. :/
---
Ya.. just wondering how silly you feel trying to justify your made up story to a random jerk on Reddit 
---
Probably pretty silly I bet. Haha
---
I normally don't use mine. But then melee 1 shotters come in and snatch everything.
---
I got a tagging gun I'll use first if others are involved but if it's one shot then i go full tse
---
Well said, we all can agree. I also find it funny, this OP beast is high level, sends sonic booms and if that isn't enough, sends high level scorch to distract you and then finally if those two don't kill you, it poisons you.
---
Yes. This would not be a hard mod to make.
---
How'd you go about that?
---
I just got booted after spending 90min getting to the control room and while defending the bots got disconnected. Getting real sick of that shit 
---
I want to see checkers but with a supersledge and the player reaching the other side gets Power Armor to signify being kinged.
---
I switch between my Anti Armor Gatling and my Furious .50 cal when going after the SBQ. Even when theres only 6-7 others there, she goes down in 3-5 mins tops
---
Appreciate it, you passed by the oppurtunity for a shitty joke obviously caused by auto correct (never done before). 
---
Like I said to OP though, the '???' Imo means exactly what OP wanted.

Start a good sized farm. I usually have 300 to 400 caps worth of tatos every time I log in... google Power Armor locations grab any Armor you don’t need and sell it.
---
Motion Assist chest plate and Calibrated Shocks be cause they boost strength.
---
Screenshot it next time. I want to see that.

***No, I don't want no scrub.***

They could literally sell all Skyrim haircuts as Atom Shop options. 
---
Yes! Thank you. Building character atm, so many ugly presets😩
---
I loved [snow in Fallout 4](https://youtu.be/1LxbPirdyt4), would love to have it in Fo76 too.
---
Bad game is bad 
---
Would've been my second guess. :)
---
Oh, we might be on to something.
---
Sounds good! Glad to hear I'm not alone in this issue.
---
Thanks for all the info and I'll be sure to keep an eye on what's going on!
---
I have never seen X01 plans only mods sold at Vendor.
---
I should be on in a couple hours. If you want help and a tour guide just send me your GT. 
---
If you didn't know when you are building and you don't have the required materials it scraps mods
---
19% off from what tough ? It was never sold once 
---
I have a TSE Gauss I use, but I don't charge the shots if I'm farming something like the golf course with others, so it doesn't one hit kill. I try to just shoot the floor usually for some splash damage, too.
---
Filthy Bethesda peasants 
---
Never fought the queen myself, no real interest to be honest, but I agree, it should be a level requirement and more than a few shots to get the loot.
---
Np, I thought it was stupid you were getting downvoted even though you were completely right.
---
It would definitely bring some balance to mutations in pvp.
---
You are the one who barges in, starts gravedigging comments, and then insists that heavy weapons are terrible in every way. You are the accuser here, so as you said, burden of proof is on the accuser. So provide that proof bitch.
---
My experience with MMo style economies is all from Neverwinter on Xb1. I know that you could be banned for trading in-game items for anything that isnt another in-game item.
---
You are right, it is virtual currency but I should have specified "something with real-world value". Something that has a real currency value attached to it.
---
I like to think everyone's weapon breaks as has happened to me before
---
Why? What junk would you want to avoid scrapping? 
---
sssufferin sssychopaths!
---
General's stake house isn't garunteed, just a higher rate. There hasn't been a legendary there for me for a few days. 
---
Well that’s stupid has heck there. I hope they put it to where that doesn’t happen. Nearly half my mods were for power armors 
---
Building, repairing, doing an event that has you repair (ex: Uranium Fever)....
---
You get *something* from regular scorchbeasts?
---
Bullshit!

It was in the store since launch... 
---
I’ve collected your bounty once 👋
---
Here's how far I've gotten:
---
* Step 1. Find a REALLY Large, flat, and open area to build on.
---
* Step 2. Lay down a 9x9 square of concrete foundations.
---
* Step 3. Use slanted brick wall on one side to make an opening into what will be the pyramid. 
---
* Step 4. Using slanted ceilings, form the sides of the pyramid from bottom to top. (Each layer will need a new slanted wall to snap to)
---
* Step 5. Go inside the pyramid and delete all of the supporting walls. (You should now have an empty shell that looks like a pyramid from the outside)
---
* Step 6. There is no step six. You are now out of building room. 👍
---
The nerf is to both 2shot as well as explosive. 
---
Yeah, I have found one. It gave me the skeleton plan, but no witch so far from route 65. :(
---
I remember you! 😂😂😂
---
The first (and only) time I cleared the silo, it took me 1h30. How much time do you need once well geared?
---
... those do not boost DR. And both are available on T-51 as well. 
---
I’ll give you that T-60 wins “best overall” in my book, but it’s not the highest DR. I like it for being balanced, cheap to repair, somewhat classic looking, and able to use BoS paint 
---
Not a lot to say on the sale threads, but I'll keep making them in case anyone's interested in these items. 
---
19% off would be 567 Atoms. Typo probably? 
---
  
---
Remember guys, I only post the updates here. Don't hurt me pls.
---
This made me laugh. 
---
There's an older bug where the game doesn't load your stash contents until you look at it. I think the new bug just has trouble with stash/loadout split, so the workaround is to throw junk into your stash instead.
---
It’s pretty insignificant, but right now you might not want to scrap toys, for instance.  
---
This mechanic would also be useful if you could apply it to weapons/armor so you don’t get scrap happy and lose something valuable. 
---
You are so goddamn wrong
---
I don't know what that guy is doing wrong, it's a pretty straightforward method 😂
---
Hey, better for me if the devs think it doesn't work!
---
I've picked up 3 prime plans within an hour just killing them near fissure prime. Drop rates are trash, but sometimes RNG blesses you 
---
I have 2.  Can have more at a lower rate if you have pure cobalt.
---
It looks like a mechanical diaper 
---
Haha. Yeah I wish you could build higher! The most ambitious build I have ever taken up was a four layer house. 
---
You just changed the life of many players there. I never noticed SBs had anything interesting.  
---
There should 100% be a level cap.
---
I just had 2 fight w about half the people were under lvl 50, mist under or about lvl 35.
---
They did absolutely nothing except hide.
---
POS leeches. 
---
Didn’t power armor used to be considered a vehicle though? Like in older games? 
---
Cool, what state/ country are you in? (Time zones are annoying)
---
They have a chance to drop them anytime, anywhere. Killed one near the Investigator’s Cabin last night and scored a Prime .50 cal receiver plan.
---
Starched genes doesn’t prevent rad-x from suppressing your mutations. It’s not about taking them away from the other player, it’s about disabling them for a period of time.
---
I ran into ten on my last world all griefers taking caps I just started ignoring them I just need a dense armor mod lol 
---
I ended up buying the tuxedos with saved up earned atoms.  Why?  So I can go around looking like a made man occasionally.  Many of the items hold no interest for me though.
---
Thats not hacking. Its just a mutation and good weapons.
---
It was !? Jesus I haven’t gone trough half of them since most of them go over armor rather then under 
---
Excuse me what the fuck?
---
well its like cancer right, anyone he gives any of those items too will also be put on a list. Don't deal with scammers, their dirt tends to rub off.
---
I don't remember where exactly, but there's also a sliding door somewhere that spawns locked open.
---
That would be amazing. I love not having to download mods to take good screenshots.
---
This is a change I would love to see!

In order for trading to be "dead" everyone would have to stop doing it.

I cant find good plans for building stuff at my camp anywhere 😔
---
Shit I wish I could've read this comment yesterday. Spent about 30 minutes dicking around with the 7 frames I had accidentally acquired, trying to find the ones with PA pieces I wanted to take off lol. When I could have just scrapped them all and gotten the same result instantly!?
---
Also isn’t adding his name breaching the witch-hunting rules?
---
Why? 
---
Ahh the good old days. I miss having cabinets full of legendary weapons and armour!
---
Try capturing workshops, then defending them. 2 guaranteed plans.
---
I keep my tse cryolater on me always. It has practical uses outside of queen fights. 
---
The explosive legendary mod makes its range incredibly huge (this is probably a bug but meh)
---
Normally freeze queen mirelurks or behemoths. 
---
Freezing scorchbeast as well makes em shut up for a bit, but this is only possible due to the explosive affix since normally it wont reach. 
---
It was fun before they fixed it to freeze players draining all their AP.
---
On the patch notes for the next patch btw
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019
---
It’s frustrating they get rewarded for making the fight harder.
---
They mentioned this in the latest “inside the vault” that there would be a patch for this. Very stupid bug though. I’ve lost some good stuff because of it.
---
They have all these teddy bears. Yet no way to display them. 
---
Na man. Prove you can kill a person in pacifist mode.
---
That's how basic logic works.
---
I fought the queen right after BETA ended and she was WAY easier to deal with.
---
Now if i take the Spruce Workshop i get 3 SoBs all spamming the sonic boom. 
---
also come to find out energy resistence doesnt matter, because *sonic* booms are explosive! not energetic!
---
I say duper duper
---
added
---
Well aren't you SPECIAL.
---
Just an FYI, my experience of SBQ runs is a bunch of melee and low level leeches standing around (maybe being useful occasionally by killing adds), while those of us with gunner/sniper spec builds do the lions' share of the damage-dealing.  So I guess your mileage may vary.
---
What, when did t get nerfed? The only patchnotes I’ve seen for overdrive was a bug fix for a bug that prevented the critical hits from applying. Literally a buff from its previous state.
---
Too bad I’m on PS4. But thanks anyway
---
Yes they have mentioned it in an Inside the Vault and will he fixing this issue. 
---
Yeah I've noticed the thirst and hunger thing. Do you use Speed Demon? I wondered if Class Freak was not reducing the debuff anymore. 
---
Lol, fucking wrecked. I guess bobbleheads are the problem!!
---
I’m glad they’re gonna patch. Guess I’m server hopping till I find the bright head lamp again and put it on there asap 
---
Ghoul’s Rush In
---
Ill consider which one is that again?
---
Ooo ok, never dont that yet, thanks! Any suggestions on which one to do first? I'm level 38
---
theres a go away emote in the files
---
To hell with the whole mall/ elevator music. Wtf? Bring on the raider stuff, I want corpses on spikes and severed heads, to make it at least LOOK like engaging in PVP is a worthwhile aspect of the game.  To make it SEEM like my character is tough. But no. Even after the bombs have dropped, my house looks like it could pass for a photoshoot in a lifestyle magazine. And nobody likes you when you stand there doing the taunt emote, everyone wants to be so respectfull like they are just too scared to offend or something. God, I promise I won't take your loot ok?! Maybe just a few screws though. I feel like Olivia Rivers. I wanted to play the badass raider chick but everyone is too buzy on a mission to play dress-ups.
---
I personnally don’t block that much so I’m not sure about the effectiveness of Blocker. I don’t have this perk in my build.
---
It depends on how you define “mod”. If it goes in the classic “mods” folder, for the most part, you are fine (aside from possible texture cheats to make things like cap stashes bright pink). If it uses any kind of outside files, be very wary. 
---
Those are smart drops, once you learn enough of them, they stop dropping, also they dont repeat 
---
Yes i agree as well I have lost many mods due to it, they also scrap before anything else so it's prioritised before other items
---
You're a bit off.  T-51 has the highest DR and ER of all PA's at level 50.
---
The 10 guys who sent me a DM already know (or soon will know) the truth. That's what matters!
---
Maybe I will make another 10 tomorrow, I'm getting lots of DMs.
---
She takes more damage on the ground.

Crippling her wings makes her land.

I want to see the TSE nerf come into effect and hear the kids cry once they realise it’s the bobblehead stacks that are killing them lol

Not just building I thought it was only building yikes
---
They're banning people who have had absurdly high numbers of single items go through their inventories, and who have accessed dev rooms or the items contained in them. Also some PC-related mod stuff, but as a console player, I don't know much about that.
---
Have you read anything official that Bethesda has out out recently? Read any of the posts of people who have been banned?
---
Xbox here thanks for the offer though.
---
Joining.
---
It definitely is. 
---
Thanks 
---
Certainly, but even to a solo player seeing a guy run around in a clown suit should be slightly amusing. Clowns existed and is it hard to believe in an irradiated wasteland some nutjob lost their mind and started running around in a clown suit?
---
You’re correct. If there’s an event to defend a workshop, that means someone owns it. It will also display the name of the owner on the map. 
---
If the workshop isn’t owned, you’ll receive a quest to claim it upon entering the area. 
---
It’s not just when blocking it’s always-45% melee damage 
---
Ah, did not know that, thank you!
---
Ive had OVN attempts where every wave had at least a crown or 3 star legendary charred ghoul dropping some awesome loot. I spend a lot of time now going to that event or UF. But sometimes just randomly roaming the mire and harpers ferry youll get legendary supermutants. also a behemoth if you go to the workshop by abandoned bog town
---
My explosive combat shotgun is basically a sniper so idk what you saying bout range 
---
This is why Legendries not damaging players would be a good step, along with private servers. This would've bought them the time they needed to decide what to do. The PVP/PVE situation is not an easy fix. Either way Bethesda has chosen what they will do so I guess none of this conversation is relevant.
---
Wait what!! But I just got a 2 shot instigating hunting rifle!! Why bethesda!
---
100% needed.
---
Also, it would be nice if they fixed how affixes are used in other languages. In French they don't write the whole thing and use brackets instead, so "Zealot's automatic combat rifle" is displayed as "[Zealot] [Auto] Combat rifle" instead. It's weird. 
---
I'd be banned, shithead.
---
The wasteland is unforgiving.
---
I already bring her down with enforcer.
---
That doesn’t suddenly make a leecher usefull.
---
Anyway to visually see that the item you're about to take belongs to someone?  Or do you just need to know that the container is in the workshop and that the workshop is owned?
---
Now begins the reign of.... The Sloth Queen! 
---
The horde events are weird/bugged. People have gotten teleported into vaults. I got teleported into the top floor of Fort Defiance.
---
Yeah!
---
Oh my
---
And I wouldn't bother thinking too long term about this game. It released with way too many issues, and server not responding, disconnects and crashes have probably already made a large part of potential players quit to play games that just don't have these problems. I guess they chose the wrong type of servers, or the game code is just not equipped to deal with it. Either way, it was a failure to launch and I don't think there's much they can do to save it at this point. Every new patch that releases nerfing stuff and taking things away from the little the players already have is just another nail in the coffin. And the die hard braindead fanboys will defend it against any criticism and downvote anything or anyone who steps out of line. So yeah. Looks like they're going to have their "perfect" little game all to themselves.
---
I suspect even active dupers are pretty safe unless they're careless. Biggest risk with trading is that you spend 15k on an item that gets nerfed in the next patch.
---
Was playing on my second character today. Ran into someone who was around my level. I give him a wave, he gives me one and off we go. Fight some Socrched and start looting, this dick starts unloading his shotgun on me. As I said, second character, so I have very little in the way of damage. My first character is shotgun and two handed melee, this one is a cowgirl gunslinger. 
---
Needless to say when I got annoyed enough to VATS and unload on the guy, his double barrel took me down and he swiped all the junk I had just acquired. Now this wouldn't annoy me so much if it weren't for the fact that we were being friendly, fighting alongside each other, and then he goes and kills me for a bunch of steel and wood. Would really love a middle finger emote for these moments. 
---
:)
---
What are you agility perks to get Adrenaline? Would like to compare.
---
I try, but consistently fail. I've done several solo nuke launches, so I'm not an awful player, but I'm just hopeless at getting the keycards
---
I've done it, I can't say it spawns nearly as much as Whitesprings, it's all right. But pretty good flora. I mean an all right amount spawned outside but I was the only one there, so it was great. Then went inside the power plant and it was meh. Had a hard time getting em to respawn. 
---
yes it procs it i also think legendary armor that revives you procs it as well so if you’re running a revenant build you should get every piece of armor with that effect because each price has a 50/50 chance of reviving you so get 5 50/50 chances or reviving yourself
---
Nice prices man 
---
How does it break immersion? It breaks YOUR immersion. There is no official set in stone image of the wasteland. Previous fallouts have had silly items/characters. In real life it is entirely possible even in a post apocalyptic situation you'll run into someone out there who is a nut job. 
---
It is not immersive however seeing a guy clearly in his mid 20s/30s wearing a suit of power armor with no training.
---
And if you do manage to put 500 rounds into one, when it dies, you get.. a wing. 
---
If you have any you'd like to sell, I'd buy them from you
---
I think what you need to realize is that lots of players are children. 10, 12, 14. They are silly, impulsive, and act crazy. I recently got a mic, and like 50% of the the people I talk to are under 18....... I try to help lower level player, but if they act sketchy I just leave.
---
hope that helps but in essence yes they do go hand in hand
---
I wish the Sinlge Action had more mods =/  The western is nice tho.
---
Heart emote
---
Holland, so the time zones will be quite screwed up, hahaha. 
---
Ill join as well. GT wonderpuddle25 
---
Me too
---
If you want adds cleared you can't make a minimum damage requirement for the queen. That will insure no one would help clear adds. I think the main problem is lack of situational awareness or knowledge on the fight. Educating lower level and inexperienced players would the right way to go. Try popping into local chat or invite to party and kindly explain that clearing adds would really be helpful and that as long as they have tagged the queen they will get loot. Text chat in game would also help immensely if Bethesda would implement it.
---
should be a boss version of each cryptid 
---
Would also trade for 3 Pure Violet Flux
---
Ah thanks for letting me know. I was there once but got chased out by a whole lot of badness which is how I probably missed it
---
I'll be home in around 6 hours, I'm more than happy to help you 
---
Haha, what’s the time over there
---
Turn pacifist mode on asap especially if you fighting in nuke zones, this can avoid shooting someone by accident. Don't pick a lock in someones camp or shoot it or pick somebody's supply drop. Also if you have a. workshop, you basically agreeing to pvp in that session, always always store you most valuable junk you don't want to lose, never carry junk on you that you can't afford to lose. Just expect to die at anytime and if that happens if you lose your junk so be it.
---
I feel this is directed at me so thats why i ll answer.
---
Imo there is a difference between pvp and griefing. I, for one, sometimes like to pvp as an interaction with other players. As I said above, if I dont feel they appreciate it I ll leave (and since chems are abundant when you have the chemistry perk I drop everyone a lot of stms and radaway). 
---
For me, why i wrote this post above, pvp is not really present in fo76. P1rties is 1 huge plus, but pvp is broken. For both the agressors as the defenders.
---
Physical cores or hyper threads?
---
At the moment almost 0200 am
---
Only on Xbox
---
I have two left I think but I need them myself. If youre on during the week I'll see if I can help you get one
---
Try Sunshine Meadows industrial farm. It's west of Flatwoods. If you can also power up it's Food Processing machine it will provide you with food(you can choose between 5 different food using the terminal inside the building to the right).
---
It's a good place to start. After you clear the enemies and capture it you'll get a plan, a few minutes later it's gonna be attacked by enemies and you'll have to defend it, after you finish the waves you will get one more plan.
---
Or a "pls go away" one.
---
but knowing that you're probably buying a duped weapon, the trade loses its value
---
Thanks alot! I'll do that tonight 
---
doing 10,000 damage cause you have the right perks and a TSE is the problem, then being able to do 15000 cause of bobbleheads and magazines completely ruins the game...
---
Yea I’m just figuring if I want to keep it or not, I have a tse pump and a ts hunter 
---
I just hate losing my death bag when I’m disconnected a few feet away from it
---
Get lucky with a Queen drop
---
This wasnt a kid. 
---
Because they’re still doing loads of damage even if you’re not using bobbleheads.
---
I think it's just check to see if the workshop is owned.  That one got me once too.  Now I just avoid all workshops.
---
If your on Xbox can you give me 3 😏
---
&gt; your friends
---
Cries in the corner
---
GT is the same as name, send an inv
---
I was unaware that perks did that much. Although two shot seems fine as is because the accuracy of those guns are quite bad.
---
I mean between that and savior I think itll be enough
---
Plus I run PA 
---
Aww you want to play dress up as a big mean raider while everyone else has their own fun. 
---
Quit discrediting others fun because it isn't your vision of fun. Acting out a raider is just as much dressup lol.
---
All of them are problems. They are just taking care of weapons first expect bobbleheads and magazines nerfs to follow. 
---
Those screenshots look like the results of a duper with cheated bobbleheads, not bloodied.
---
At workshops , your turrets do slap damage to anyone trying to take over. So they Xanadu’s take the shop from you ; you can take the shop from them etc etc. 
---
I put things in the cash register at Artisan's Corner in Whitespring. I have also put stuff in the Overseers Cache at Flatwood. There are a few place people regularly go at different stages of the game. You never know if anyone will see it but maybe they will.
---
Was ready to launch my first nuke, got to the targeting computer and crashed. Done for the day. 
---
You cant do 10k on a tse fully perked out, dont pull numbers out of your ass. The only way to get in the thousands like this is with bobblehead and exploits, not tse. At 20% health adrenal reaction and full perk loadout my tse shotgun does around 1900.
---
Most of mine is aid, 30 stim packs 12 supers 27 healing salves, 30 purified waters and 18 dog foods. That could also be what it is. 
---
You're running those without Starched Genes? You're crazy.
---
What if you accidentally open your inventory and hit the RadX key? Or walk into a shower and someone turns it on, or even walk through one that you thought was off, but it was only a client side bug and it was actually on.
---
Someone help me out here.. what does the endangerol syringer do? 
---
My GT is the same as my name. Send an inv
---
You just have to know. You can tell the workshop is owned by looking at it on the map.
---
Knowing what falls within the workshop, unfortunately is up to you.
---
Thank you.
---
It is getting balanced in next patch.
---
Is there an actual decent use for the syringer? I've never used it since FO4
---
I was helping out a lvl 7 the other night cause I was between quests and saw him wandering the golf course around where my camp is. Helped him with some supplies, built him a little shack with some workbenches so he could get started scrapping and repairing. Felt nice to get this guy started up. Plus it was a good use of all the excess ammo I have. 
---
I think PA mods are categorized into "tiers". For the same reason certain mods for the same slot are more expensive, you receive certain mods more often as drops than others.
---
Low tier mods have low vendor cost/high drop rate
---
mid tier mods have mid vendor cost/mid drop rate
---
high tier mods have high vendor cost/low drop rate
---
We see so many Explosive Vents because that "pool" that it's rolling the loot from is very small due to only containing mods for 1 PA type. 
---
If low tier drops had a tiny pool for weapons, we'd see a stupid amount of them while mid and high tier kept variability.
---
Hm I had saved 3, wasn't sure if it was just me and they'd be worth something.  Now I know it's dead weight
---
I wish I had that many Bobbles💀 just try any Bloodied it’s increase is insane then comp that up with Adrenal Reaction, nerdrage, Weapon cards (in your case pistols), a Bobble Head (big gun higher scaling than Explosive for some reason at least in my testing). 
---
those who cant use simple needs to get better computer to run them
---
Honestly they are more my concern since I don't want to shoot them and they are always running in front of me.
---
I know your pain.  50ish kills and I just tossed 41 of them.  To me it's not the fact that they drop so frequently, it's the fact the Jet Pack to properly utilize them isn't implemented that annoys me.
---
I'm almost curious, is their high drop rate possibly a bug and that portion of the SBQ loot is supposed to have a equal chance at dropping the MODs for the power armor?  I mean she pretty much has a set loot always dropping 1 piece of the set, 1 legendary, the vents, 2 pieces of "food", 2 items to be broken down into components, and a random amount of ultracite...
---
I had the same problem. My right mouse button was failing (wouldn't stay clicked down when I pressed it). I have a Logitech though, but same symptoms. Try checking your mouse function outside of FO76 with a mouse test program to make sure press and hold on your right mouse button actually works.
---
I just did the typical thing and beat on my right mouse button a bit, and it started working for awhile. Failed again and and I replaced my mouse. All is working well now.
---
I’m not disagreeing that buying items in game for cash isn’t supporting because I use to agree but at the same time isn’t it supporting the idea that we are ok with all the micro transactions? Again I can’t say much because I’ve dropped some serious cash on games.. 
---
Twice in a couple hundred hours for me.  Darn shame, it makes SB an easy kill.
---
Theyll be back with more once their melee builds get nerfed too. 
---
Once your at endgame and start working out how to sustain a supply of steel and lead, ammo really stops being a concern. There really isn't much in between the difficulty of regular content to scorchbeasts but a good in-between is farming a whitespring nuke zone for legendaries that seem like you would like. TS/E is strong at the moment but is getting a heavy nerf probably by the time early feb rolls around. Also start working on building up some high end legendary sets, as the super end game actually has armor that is much stronger than PA. 
---
Has that nice black and white tux allready come out? That was the ONLY nice outfit and I’ve allready seen someone wearing it
---
He loot table sucks! And the RNG has made killing her remarkably unsatisfying.
---
Really? Because in 2009 when I was leaving the Army my "new" 670-1 was revised back in 2005 when ACUs we're becoming standard issue. I'm not super college-educated but 2009 - 2005 is a little bit more than 18 months.
---
You only become wanted for picking player-owned locks.  I
---
They recently made the aid drops tied to the player who requested them, but I have never received a wanted level for picking the lock on a keycard box.
---
Yeah and not everyone mix maxes or can reach those kind of numbers.
---
Send this to avril!! Epic 😂
---
Random Scorchbeast queen drop, or you can buy it in enclave science wing. It's very rare, and you have to server hop A LOT, and it costs about 25k if you don't have perks and charisma buffs
---
I have one if you're interested. 
---
Only from the command wing of the Enclave Bunker (i.e. MODUS).
---
Yeah it sucks, wish thay would be lore friendly and just allow us to use them. 
---
You have a favorite item that isn’t unable to be scrapped because it’s legendary??
---
Wait there’s going to be a new stash limit hope it’s 800 or 1000
---
I have gotten mine to 3400, but I agree 10,000 is a horrible exaggeration.
---
I'd gladly take more story depth and a distinct lack of lame ass robot vendors over pvp. I never pvp it's lame who's idea was it to take a single player action rpg and make it mmo?
---
In fact I'll server hop if someone starts acting like a dofus by either trying to initiate pvp or just annoying blowing up every car.
---
Now I'm not downing them or even saying they're wrong. In fact they're playing exactly like they should which is anyway you like.
---
I just don't like it when I'm next to those cars and as far as pvp goes I don't want to get one-shotted (or one-shot them) there is absolutely no fun in that.
---
Are you using a power armor with targeting HUD by any chance? If you look at my post history I was having a ridiculous amount of blue screens. They were very literally every 10 minutes. 
---
I took off the X01 power armor with targeting HUD and put on the excavator armor and I have had zero blue screens since. Went from 60 in 2 days, to none. 
---
My problem is I hit the 25000 cap limit.
---
I wish there was a ranger outfit like the NCR one (but without all the NCR stuff because, ya' know, timeline stuff, and from what I remember the armor itself existed pre-war), and maybe a unisex bob haircut.
---
I don't even care about nerfs. I just want to see a queen with 80% gray life from a legit melee toon.
---
Then melee will follow, alonh with bloodied it will be a never ending cycle
---
I use that one too, just weird to heart emote other players in front of my wife. She says I've cheapened it for her... 
---
There's a big difference between witch hunting and seeing a guy covered in blood and satanic symbols eating a child alive.
---
Yeah I had like 50 pounds of weight from Gunpowder when I was new. 
---
[removed]
---
I don't mind the shit items being released. It gives me ample time to collect atoms in game, so that when something decent comes along, I have 2-3x the atoms to buy it.
---
I rebuilt it in the same spot.  Working fine so far.  But so did the old one.
---
Sorry I don't mean to but in but where are you getting this 30% out of curiosity. From experience furious seems useless and this may explain it but I haven't seen anything talking about the math of furious
---
Yes to this.  
---
T-51 is a typo for T-51b. There's no T-51 in the game, only T-51b.
---
Aye, would actually make sense if they worked like SAM sites
---
That's just explosive doing that.
---
My explosive flamer shoots further than a gauss rifle
---
Alright, thanks
---
Worth a shot.
---
Yea the next thing people are going to say alot is melee is op now that tseis getting nerfed 
---
Hey my legendary western revolver is excellent against mirelurks and it has no explosive on it. It has +30% dmg against mirelurks and bugs, 15% faster reload, and +40% bashing damage. Wendigo cave not friendly to boom booms
---
Tried about five minutes before you were gonna let loose, but the server was full.
---
Haha, it’s 10:52 here, I only just woke up. I’ll try and wake up earlier next time,
---
Less than 30 min for sure.
---
(Lovers Embrase activated)
---
yeah with the right weapon and everything you can do a lot, and it’s accurate against a SBQ, so it ruins the game for us sub 100s who have terrible guns and can’t get more than a hit off on her.
---
There have been lots of posts from people testing it. Each hit does more and more damage but the damage boost caps at 30%. 
---
only somehow good mod is reduce target damage resistance by 25
---
Miner Miracles.  Just look at an excavator poster and press x.  Happens at Garrahan Minimg
---
Also the “hol up” meme, now that we are on it
---
I'd like a 'sorry' emote
---
I just blatantly ignore them as well I have two Tse weapons and there's no point in greifing people with them. It doesn't even remotely feel fair in pvp if someone else doesn't have one. They need to fix fireproof. On the subject of Ops post I shoot the ceiling in whitesprings or just swap to a different weapon. Stealing xp is one thing (pointless late game because their is waaay better places) but stealing the chance for decent gear is a dick move. 
---
Yes, do you have a link?
---
I crafted two sets of level 10 pocketed leather armor and shotguns with all the bells and whistles and 500 rounds of ammo each. Then I server hopped for about two and a half hours trying to give it away because somebody did something similar for me when I started. 
---
I ended up leaving them in the overseer chest across five servers because I couldn't get anybody to understand that I wanted to give them shit with voice, emotes and running in circles around the bag and whatnot. I may just stop trying to help. 
---
Had one drop the Prime Automatic Radium Rifle Receiver plans for me once.  Used to think they were a nuisance but after that drop I go ahead and kill them if I'm not occupied.
---
Platform?
---
That would terrify me to no end 
---
Keep it on at all times unless you want to add a mutation. Then you remove it breifly to take the new serum ans then reequip it  
---
You only lose a mutation if you use radaway or a decontamination arch with the card off. 
---
xbox one
---
This is a pain as I have been using the plasma core weapons and they break before emptying a core. They are expensive to repair and heavy. So why bother with them?
---
Yup, I have 3 explosive vent plans.... If armor plan spawns are supposed to be random, they aren't. Maybe it's another thing broken.
---
Doesnt stop them from adding items in the stom shop
---
Its the same stuff that makes all builds op. Bloody mess, adrenal reaction low health, full 9 perk cards, and tse or bloodied on a legendary weapon. This is why the nerfs will continue, the tse is not the problem, the stacking of bonuses is. 
---
All that had to be done for an acceptable nerf to tse was to remove the ability for demo expert to increase damage for anything other than grenades, fat mans, and missile launchers.
---
The bobblehead stacking and magazines and chem stacking are what was causing players to be one shot in pacifist and is the root of the problem. This is where the crazy damage numbers such as 15k were coming from, not the weapons and perks.
---
They need to make quests to kill x amount of a creature or to make area bosses and thise are the rewards
---
I am jelly af
---
Because the bobbleheads aren't a problem
---
This, 1 billion times this. I keep 2 PAs, An excavator for when I am getting scrap and one for going into Nuke zones.  It is a pain sorting through them in my stash to get the right one while a nuke timer counts down and iI am rushing to adjust my character since I am a non-PA build stealth sniper, except in nuke zones.
---
Who said they were adding pvp servers?
---
Bethesda did. 
---
I wanna be a medic main! How do you do this? What is your setup like?
---
And you will soon for just 800 caps (it’ll be a static image that appears above your head with no animation).
---
Don't tell Beth... she'll take it away from us 😥
---
Recently?
---
Another successful drop, thanks everyone!  Will be doing another one shortly.
---
Logical cores suffice. 
---
Thanks for the invite. That was a great group. And  I got a mutation serum recipe drop!
---
Yeah, the tagging system kinda sucks. It stops players from afk power leveling with a team, though. 
---
At the bottom. 
---
Awesome!
---
So you’re saying my current bankroll of 250 caps isn’t gonna cut it... 
---
I just want to put some fucking pool balls on the pool table 
---
Your temper tantrums will solve nothing. 
---
It's terrible design. It's nigh impossible to avoid the screeches and the wing mist so fighting a scorchbeast means tanking damage rather than using cover intelligently. Imagine how much cooler fighting scorchbeasts would be if it was an intense battle of moving between cover and taking shots when you can. Instead it's just constantly jabbing yourself with stimpacks while you take potshots at it or wait for it to land.   
---
If I were designing them I'd make the screeches not do direct damage and instead create a glowing effect on the ground. A couple of seconds later the glow detonates with a small explosion. So the fight would be avoiding screech mines while you fight the scorched on the ground and then you can focus on the beast.
---
dang you dont got it
---
I kinda wish I had one but it's OK hopefully I'll get drop I do have good weapons but they are just to op for anything I have. So I'd play a bit cause well it's a game and then ignore cause why lose all my caps.  Once I get the dense armor mod and fireproof I'll be alright with my melee stuff I just learned how to negate their damage unless their bobbling. 
---
Kek
---
Ill take "Things Mohammed's lovers have never said before"
---
By nuke i mean them blowing the fuck outta it using explosives who would realistically waste a nuke to drop in the middle of bumfuck nowhere
---
Nope sorry im on pc
---
r/fo76bazaar and r/fo76marketplace
---
Cheers mate, we’ll find someone eventually
---
No, don't really feel like digging for it. It's fairly common knowledge in the endgame community. It makes sense, too. All of the other damage boosting traits are +30% as well. If you really need your proof you can dig in and research. 
---
Haven't played yet today, but I got a nice explosive harpoon gun last night kn my heavy guns character, so I'm gonna spend some time looking for plans and getting some mods. 
---
I tested a bunch today and haven’t figured out what is causing it yet. 
---
He was in a group and someone would dashboard quit and sign back on and rejoin team and they would respawn 
---
I honestly encounter more people with one shot melee weapons than anything else now in white springs, TSE is still a big thing but not nearly as much as previously in my experience 
---
Yes, one thing that I have missed as games have evolved through the years is the disappearance of good boss battles. But, this.....this would put a smile on my face.
---
Woah that's aggressive man, you should smoke a bit and chill out. 
---
We would've definitely taken you along if you would've been available earlier. We found someone willing to help just after I made this post, haha. Thank you for the offer, and good luck when you decide to run it yourself! :)
---
Sure thanks!
---
Hey, I'm having fun now. No need to solve anything!
---
TSE shotguns do nothing against the queen in the air. Bad accuracy, range, and damage spread. At 961 damage, cant even see the health bar move when I hit the queen so I use a 50 cal wtlith tse and 3 other guys with high dps and we can normally take but its a challenge. 
---
On that note if you cant push high dps then you dont need to show up to the queen until you get your build right. You make it harder on everyone else. With the nerfs there wont be any good guns left.
---
Why are people still playing this game?
---
I've found a few things of use on lower level characters in the suitcases at vendors, so it does help! 
---
GT: Silverwolf294 thanks!
---
Because they don't actually play the game at high levels. They just read what angry noobs on Reddit whine about.
---
If you're on PC send me an invite, username is the same as it is here. I'll do it for free if you have the materials. 500 caps if you need me to supply them. It takes a pure crimson flux, one ultracite, three fiberglass, and five oil.
---
It's not griefing I'd they fight back, right?
---
Back when i was level ~15, I failed to protect a high level AFK player at the Lewisburg station. idk why, but this dude had just about all of his junk on him. I left most of the junk I had no use for untouched (ie black titanium, etc), but I'll admit to taking about half of everything else lmao
---
Theyd have to have stable servers first 
---
Oh they already have 
---
I don't know...
---
I bought the tuxedo. Probably getting the space suit.
---
Idk why you got downvoted, what you said is true. I prefer the modding community take over
---
They needed a nerf, imo shouldn't even had been in the game because of how unbalanced it is compared to any other legendary its obvious that the dev's never tested anything
---
**"(UPDATE):** We’ve received questions about our new mode and want to clarify that this mode will be playable separately – **it will be a new option accessed from the Main Menu.** This mode will be designed for fans that want a more hardcore PvP experience. The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode."
---
This does not mean pvp servers. 
---
Turn on passive
---
Easy but tedious :/ I stopped nuking queen because the loot isn't worth the time it takes to run the silo. Only thing that keeps me coming back is I'm a completionist for power armor mod plans, because power armor is the only thing worth crafting vs finding
---
My first legendary I got as a drop was a stalkers baton. Thought it was a fluke so I kept it. My second legendary drop was a ghoul slayers gamma gun. It was then that I decided BGS is messing with me.
---
"And don't even get me started on the stupid mall music of the shop itself. "
---
Not a fan of Bewitched? I kind of like the music, but I agree with you on the play time cosmetics. 
---
Again, making some weapons simply unusable like that isnt something you can really do. Youre trying to apply a solution that would only work ina totally different type of game
---
Sure but given the state of the game, probably priority 9999
---
Yes. This would improve inventory management greatly.  
---
In my experiences, unless you set up camp on a pathway or something, if they're coming to your camp they're coming to wreck your shit.
---
In the only two instances I've had of someone finding my camp, one of them killed me, and the other killed me and started destroying my base (which I just built and didn't have enough left over to repair)
---
I'm now paranoid of literally anyone who is above level from me. And at Level 30, that's practically everyone...
---
Nobody would get this mad if they actually were telling the truth
---
I got it
---
Why are you on the sub if you aren’t playing the game?
---
the black blue and white one and your on xbox
---
“Playable separately”
---
I take that to mean that it’s separate from normal gameplay. Only way I can think to do that is to have separate servers. 
---
How do you interpret it?
---
A lot of quests are daily quests and can be done over and over again but disappear the next day. Try going to the teapot or the pumpkins for some
---
Yeah, against some of the dullest enemies with one of the least exciting events to work through. Only one I can think that is more tedious for the same length of time is patrol duty. 
---
You're wrong :)
---
There’s no reason there can’t be epic versions of the Grafton Monster, Mirelurk Queen, Deathclaw, Fog Crawler, Mothman even.
---
I'm on PC, but just wanted to let you know that 8k is cheap for it, i paid 18k and TSE Harpoon Gun.
---
Because no one ever says/reads something wrong in real life right?
---
What ate you talking about? It nearly means "PvP servers"
---
You can't give people an option for a "hardcore PvP experience" and then drop them into the pve servers with everyone who didn't opt into that mode. 
---
I always keep my Quad Explosive Cryolator on me, just keep farming for ammo lol
---
Bah! Bethesda has better things to do, like nerfing explosive weapons by nerfing two shot weapons and other things that no one asked for. 
---
Honestly thought about doing that to some dude today. Couldn't pull through with it though. He was nearly at the end, surprised he did it though. I asked do you know the launch code? No. Do you have a nuclear keycard? What? So I told him the code, put in my keycard and had him nuke Whitesprings. Dude was so grateful we ended up playing for a bit, guy was chill.
---
I'll help you out sometime, takes me about 10-15mins. 
---
oh so ill never get one
---
It triggers for me a helmlock holes maintenance workshop has done 3 days in a row when I claim workshop.
---
Yeah wtf. Beth has alot to do still if they want ANY good will back. 
---
Twin middle fingers please
---
Well I know of a lot of these but I’m looking like better ones, I guess I’ll do more dailys if they are different but I’m looking for more in depth ones I guess
---
There’s one under a power line. Found it once while scouting for a place to camp. It’s just a door, standing up, without a single wall anywhere in sight. Its kicked. 
---
Well, you can also farm them yourself.
---
If you are Xbox I have an All Rise I am not using. Third time is a charm.
---
Right.  Captured my first workshop on a new build. at lvl 20.  First defend the workshop was a lvl 50 Scortchbeast.
---
Everytime I log in I look at the vault to overseers area for low level players and fast travel there to try to give them water and healing salve I've made. Usually 20 water and 20 healing.  Most just run away.  I just thought it would be nice to help lower levels.  I usually run across some basic plans also.
---
What do you mean? Im confused how you worded that.
---
So basically:
---
-Look for ammo material farms. Any place that can give steel or lead. What about plastic, as I need that for shotguns? Or should I start looking at other weapons? I mentioned melee, but I know in order to bring batdragons down you need to break their wings.
---
-Start hunting for Nuked Whitesprings, trying to kill as many legendaries as possible to get better gear. Depending on nerfs probably don't keep anything TS/E.
---
-Start keeping any good level 50 legendary armor. But what do I do about nuke zones? I'm guessing I should still keep a set of supped up power armor around for those?
---
how?
---
But did you hide in the toilet though.
---
That’s where I hide
---
Not gonna happen without exploiting magazines and bobbleheads which is why the videos for queen speed runs are mostly melee.
---
Yeah it will only be 500 atomic points it’s so overpriced
---
Yeah ok sure
---
Literally every time. I purposely put away my armor and weapon so I look less “intimidating” and they just walk away
---
Oh, like the paramedic? Cause I'm not quite sure which your talking about now
---
Scrochbeast king doesn’t fly does massive damage but less tanky
---
roflcopter
---
Let me guess, you never won the lottery.
---
I'm inclined to agree, I love the random interactions of other players. Especially the machete wielding clowns that watch over me when I'm afk sleeping. I also love the loneliness of it Roll playing the actual lone wanderer is quite immersive for me. That being said, if done the right way, the introduction of npcs could work well. But until then at least 400 caps for the vendors. Please!!! 
---
Next time have a chainsaw and constantly rev it.  
---
It’s the universal sign of peace 
---
It’s risky but you can trade between your alts by putting items in a container then logging out and logging back into the same server with your alt and collecting said items. Only done this on Xbox, write down a few names of people in your server then join off of them. 
---
I don't know why it wasn't just the static damage value (10?) From fo4.
---
Like 3 times for me today... :\\
---
Unusable in pvp, not unusable. It is something that could be done quite easily. PVP players would base their builds around armor instead of weapons. Not a hard concept.
---
now watch the idiots cry revolver is too OP and needs nerf
---
That. Is. Amazing.
---
Serious boyfriend points!
---
I have a theory!!!! I believe this is going to be a playable map in the new pvp mode!!!! I'm totally going to save this post and possibly make a post with this link to ask if other people think the same thing. 
---
Sadly it doesnt. A tse back in the day was work 20k easy. Duped or not. Now not even worth 5k with th3 nerf bat coming in hard 
---
Really like this idea
---
The black blue and white fireman outfit with the american flag on the arm
---
Rifle Gaming is a duper tho, it makes me kinda mad to see everyone give him so much credit after he openly showed himself exploiting the game
---
Either by farminhmg an ungodly amount of Events in The Forest.
---
Or by comlpleting first several responder main quests like thirst things first over and over by creating a ton of alts.
---
A list (not made by me) of events that lead to rare apparel, including Responder Fireman apparel: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview
---
if you have a picture of it send it over
---
15 through 30 with Demo.
---
I don't understand it either. Doing double the damage of a super sledge with a pump action at long range?
---
Sometimes glass caverncis filled with protectrons or liberators.
---
Grinding at high levels is terrible right now. Not only is it pointless, but it's also tedious.
---
Glad that Beth has asked about events... Hopefully they get beefed up. These days I log in.. look for an event, if I don't find a good one I just log back out again.
---
It tracks everyones damage, not just yours.
---
Yup yup. It's crazy that bobbing gives that big of a damage increase. Can't wait for that to be patched. 
---
Definitely the most common suggestion I am seeing lots besides rejoining a server if we had a crash or connection issue, I placed it first in my official response to the inside the vault call for feedback (After positive feedback). Containers, some kind of multi character / level progressing BASE, and displaying items so we can do both decorating and container types that are inherently enhanced by a display, like this armor stand. 
---
US Timezones, not sure on time played. I’m level 19 but I’ve spent ton of time messing around with my base. Playing the PC version 
---
Do you have the perks to be able to build it?
---
Sadly your wrong, Example: Conan Exiles. Crappy, buggy , broken, discounted within a well of launch. Thanks to PvP that game sold so we'll it was able to get that studio out of debt. PvP keeps players and attracts new ones. Humans are mostly competitive. The drive to Compete is natural. It generates more revenue because different mechanics can be implemented to apply pressure to buy, log on at X time, and partake in X activities. It's the end game that never ends. The online games that have the highest population and revenues have PvP and competitive aspects. Do you by chance work?  a have you ever wanted to punch someone at work in the face? 
---
I rest my case
---
Absolutely. 
---
It's a balance thing, typically pve viable weapons and skills get nerfed to uselessness due to pve balancing.  Traditionally a power scaling game need separate pve/pvp stats to not have significant issues.
---
Yeah....it is not a perfect game.   But its fun.   
---
Just take it slow and do missions....you'll get the stories and know where to start gathering resources...
---
And..have fun :)
---
Yeah and then melee gets nerfed.. Then we find a new good weapon... then that one gets nerfed.  
---
The cycle will never end there. Only chance is to quit the game it seems.
---
Lol, I too have found the infamous ghoul slayer gamma, I wish I would have kept it for fun.
---
I saw a guy on the 76 bazaar last night trying to sell a stalkers combat knife for 300 caps. Dont know if he was serious or not but I had a good laugh regardless.
---
The obnoxious spinning of a revolver's barrels drives me **NUTS**
---
"Scrap all junk" at a workstation before dumping scrap in your stash box. it'll save a lot of space.
---
The quests are a lot of fun. Make sure to read the terminals and find all the hidden lore. 
---
Ok to clarify I meant unusable in certain situations*
---
Why would you restrict builds to just armor? That negates a big chunk of the game. Yeah, its not a hard concept, but it would be poor game design. Just balance the weapons.
---
It's more than half a game, it's like 80% of a game. That last 20% just happens to be the last 20% of the game!
---
Real talk, friends asked what I do end game as they approach it
---
Typically I do my vendor run then cycle through about a dozen plan spawn locations while checking if a number of events or the queen are up. 
---
Them: "that sounds... Discouraging"
---
If you find a fire tower. Walk to the top. Tap interact and it’ll show you close by places you probably haven’t discovered. 
---
What perks are required 
---
How can I send it to you?
---
Unless you crash, then the recent players list is blank. At least it is for me.
---
I imagine it is, like I said previously I received a serum instead of a vent once so I think they are supposed to drop high end loot in that place and for some reason just drop vents consistently, I think Beth will have to look at the loot table and change it from like 33% to 10-15% or something. (not the actual numbers but it's the best I can think of. )
---
So, update. Just logged in, and got one that's been plaguing me forever, 'Kill Different Kinds of Animals.' It never logged Yao Guai. Ever. I would fast travel to Dolly Sods a few times a week in November/December to nail that one and out of nowhere I get it today after all this bitching. That, and like a few others adding up to like 130 atoms or something crazy, from like an hour of gameplay. The game gives, not a lot, and it takes a lot more, but oh well. I guess one day I'll just walk into Wavy Willards and get it all of a sudden!?
---
OK
---
though private messages
---
Take my upvote. Great idea.
---
does it make or store nuka cola?
---
I tried hiding in a porty-potty from Scorched once and found out that the bullets go right through the wall
---
Definitely
---
It's actually not too far from it.  Outside of the occasional person trying to grief it's coop fallout.
---
That is sweet idea - especially if they show a dna symbol next to your name so the mutant hunters could identity their prey.
---
I hold mine also just because I think they're worth selling in bulk one day. Not sure honestly. Maybe start an explosive vent shop hahaha
---
Balancing is expected in any open world mutliplayer game with consistent player interaction across gear curves... if you have no pvp but playres two shotting end game bosses and using really broken tactics to progress/wipe areas it still make the game worse for everyone that there are broken systems
---
I used a weak weapon, a pipe I think, on a Robot in Watoga, because they are passive. I did a normal attack to see how much, and then a power attack to see how much. It looked like a little over double damage. I would say about 2.5x.
---
If you can snag it for around $30, I'd say yes. I was able to pick up the tricentennial edition for $30 at my local Costco, ymmv.
---
Lol did.the same thing...except one was beating me up...and I couldn't cancel it
---
No.
---
If you are that picky keep plying whatever you are currently playing.
---
If you want to have fun and enjoy the game for what it is you can still buy it.
---
Sounds good till you realize that in the time it takes to shoot at someone with the syringer and switch weapons, you are already dead to a TSE gun. 
---
I'm sure I could do it with my melee but it ain't right 
---
I bet you totally love being told that something that did happen couldn’t happen lol
---
Yeah I'm more excited about the flux. Never got anything good from her. 
---
I'd like to see medical syringers in general - like a revive rifle that costs stimpacks to repair that can revive a downed player 
---
Last 2 times her body has vanished completely while the loot loaded. So I only got what the quest gave me.
---
Agreed I get way too many Melee weapons, wooden armor and Junkie effect stuff....4/5 legendary drops for me are one of those.
---
I’ve been wandering around just looking for all the towers. 
---
Mode does not equal server. It means a new game mode. Many games separate game modes. Think zombies with COD. Still COD just a separate game mode.

---
Spent an hour dueling someone over the Lakeside workshop. Came out about 100 caps up from when I started, but left him control of the workshop when I left. 
---
Ah yeah I googled it. Sorry i dont have that one. 
---
Dear God patrol duty, I made a post awhile back saying my best time for a clear was 16 minutes or so (originally I said ten but I miss calculated) I think it can be done in about 15 mins or less with a full team all using squad maneuvers and speed demon. Just my guess tho. Also quick tip you can just shoot the pieces you have to break or blow them up. No more clicking a for me. Just a quick sweep with my lmg.

I haven't been able to find much information on bag despawns. My guess is it's [whenever the cell unloads/resets](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wqggn/cautionary_advice_for_all_dropped_weapons_will/) (when no players are around, though death drops might last longer), and if you've left multiple bags, the previous bags can despawn sooner.
---
A lot of people leave things in the containers around train stations, rather than in bags.
---
Watoga train station and the Artisan's Corner are frequently visited. The Overseer's cache in Flatwoods might be a good spot to drop plans and recipes.
---
I have tested anti armor out and it (when I tested it several weeks/2 patches ago) it did 0 extra damage on the deathclaws I tested it on. Maybe its been fixed, maybe all your damage is coming from vats. My guess is vats.
---
I'd unlock it to see if I could open it
---
Did a lot of junk and ore gathering (breach and clear event and workshops).
---
Did as many as possible  different events, help defend other people's workshop,
---
Killed a few Scorchedbeast (50 and 80)
---
And I found a single shot explosive weapon; I kind of like it; but still holding on to my non legendary combat shotgun which is my main weapon.
---
Yep.
---
Every time I claim the hemlock holes workshop the it triggers the quest. Since I haven't completed the quest it keeps triggering the arrest warrant bots
---
Yes.
---
Spent the morning trying to get some levels. Redesigning my support character for pvp and it's looking like I'll need about 30 levels for the full respec. 
---
Only 28 more to go haha... 😭
---
Ah interesting I will have to see this
---
Crashed to Desktop 16 fucking times
---
Ya their are a number of inconsistent flags on uniforms.  Thought it would have been fix cause players noticed that week one.
---
Can't fault Beth too much as this is a very low priority issue but one that should have been fixed by now.
---
It’s under intelligence, and has a picture of power armor on it
---
My medic build is primarily Team Medic and First Aid. You can also run rad sponge. I keep photosynthetic  and sun kissed on hand for sharing to my team, as well as always using suppressor to minimize incoming damage. I have chemist and super duper so I can hand out lots of diluted stimpaks and radaway to my team mates, and I keep rad shields on hand. Traveling pharmacy 3 means I can carry enough stim packs to drop one every 30 seconds for hours. 
---
Friendly fire is garbage BTW. Flamers and their ammo are too damn heavy, and they break so fast you'd think they came out of a claw machine.
---
If they wanna get the fun sucked out of a coop game, I really don't care, but I wanna have my fun.
---
After nuke sbs have an increased drop rate, about 8/10 for every SB. Usually SBs have a droprate of around 1/25 for a lvl 50 and 2/10 for a lvl 80 (I farm sbs cause I sell ultracite ammo) 
---
If you're not playing it, what the hell are you doing here???
---
I would live it if she had a better loot drop chance or if maybe the lvl 80 scorchbeasts or maybe the mirelurk queens and high tear enemies dropped plans everytime. Not five like she does, just one, any random one, shit just give me a chance to find some chairs or something. Especially after the soon nerf to Tse weapons those enemies will actually be a bit more of a challenge for everyone so the loot should reflect that. No more three shotting queens and stuff. 
---
Well I have movement speed on my handmade it works but it seems to work whether I'm aiming or not just having it out period 
---
I have two pieces of 50% reduced falling damage armor. I never take falling damage :D
---
I like the idea of clothing items having some unique properties. It's a great idea.
---
Wait, there's a Caps limit?!
---
At a dollar an hour you’ll get your moneys worth, afterwards though not so much. It’s not like destiny where I snuck over a thousand hours into 
---
Flatwoods controlled enemies have a purple aura around them. They don’t hack just turrets, it’s anything in the range they’ll “control” to fight for them. 
---
I need to do two things when I log in in about five minutes. Priority issues must be adressed. I will be first obtaining a recon scope for my gauss rifle. I will do this however necessary, for instance collecting materials to build many gauss rifles. I will then scrap these. My secondary objective is to secure exactly two increases to my level. I require this to obtain the armorer perk third rank. I need this perk so I can put the dense mod I have acquired onto my chest armor. That is what I will be doing. NOT exploring or getting side tracked this time, I have a mission.
---
Nope, I didn't take any workshops. Just chilling at my house.
---
Apparently a 25000 limit I found today.
---
Yeah. Unfortunately the highlighted border is a cylinder. I was trying to put a lamp post at the outer edge of my build zone and getting really frustrated until I worked that out. 
---
I understand completely, I'll mention this on the forum sometime before then and see if they will listen. I think uranium fever should be a solo one. 
---
Lol the trilby one...
---
The costumes, not the plans sorry.
---
Well seeing that my game crashed on pc for the 6th time in 2 hours at a very annoying time and I'm kinda annoyed, I'm going to say no. This game is still very buggy and crashy, enough so that major parts of the game aren't worth doing because as soon as you get things started you crash and lose all progress. 
---
It’s supposed to be called a “Deathclaw Matriarch” or something like that but the title gets mixed with the traveling merchant 
---
That's rough. I've heard about it happening and have been lucky so far. Worst time for me was when she just flew into the out of bounds and we all had to watch her from a distance as the clock counted down. Even if we did drop her the loot would have been gone. We didn't waste the ammo that time. 
---
I am working on lvl 100, then boosting the pvp kills for my plat and calling it quits till a major content update. Grinding out the last few lvls and running SBQ is getting old fast
---
To offer a clearer recent example, take destiny 2.  To balance out shotguns and sniper rifles in pvp they made ammo count and damage too small to be useful in pve.  Warfare is another example where they gave up and made separate kit for pve/pvp.  FFXIV had to do so as well to finally get things in balance.
---
Hmm you be may right, looking at all my weapons and they have the prime receiver option.
---
are you alright man
---
Bout 15 mins tops, you can ignore the enemies till last part of your build allows it, or just splash everything with a tse. 
---
More like the whole game.
---
If they're telling the truth this is awesome 😁
---
praise be
---
I usually tell them to go away.
---
Granted I'm only level 30 and they can mess me up if they wanted to, but they usually leave.
---
Balancing gone wrong in some games doesnt justify simply turning off problem weapons in certain situations. If they altered the pvp damage the weapons did and kept the pve damage thered be no problem
---
I had my 1st PvP experience today. I'm level 94, the other was much lower. It was at Grafton station. He started by hitting me several times and backing off, I waved, he waved back, I dropped my junk off and engaged with a basic 2 shot speedy receiver gatling gun, he took cover and switched to a TSE shotgun, i ended up winning do to dense and fireproof. It was still a good close fight. I didn't touch his bag, he respawned in, we both gave the thumbs up emote and went about our business. He was cool and it was fun. 
---
Best steel farming is vendors
---
When I saw my first one .... I was like, it’s a dragon!!
---
Every scorch beast does. They just have increased drop rate if they are inside a nuke zone or in an after nuke zone https://xboxclips.com/dart1014/a1bf204e-afc8-4357-b50b-bb0e84b0ab4f
---
one of us! r/templeoftodd
---
For me the big thing was percent damage boost further invalidated low damage weapons.  
---
Granted scatter guns will always be broken if they don't average bonus damage across pellets.
---
Pointing your gun at something is still aiming it even if you aren't looking down the barrel. The damage/DR while aiming effects are the same way, so long as your gun is drawn you get the bonus.
---
Awesome info, thanks! 
---
Oh, I thought I was having a bad day with 6 crash to desktop.
---
Where at? I cant find it
---
I feel like it's my Targeting HUD on my PA helmet. I'm going to take it off and see what that does.
---
It reduces the target’s armor by 25% for 2 minutes
---
Yeah, the assholes with duped TSE's 
---
Featured category for me.  Last item on the right.
---
yes, you have to find couple of caps somewhere
---
Yeah, this! Why should I buy the greaser jacket and jeans that look brand new, if I can get the ruffed up version that looks 10 times cooler for free in-game?
---
I dont want to look brand new. I want to look like I live in the post apocalypse.
---
A dangerous path they are treading here.
---
But hey! TSE nerf incoming next week
---
Pins on maps in buildings (train stations, fire station, etc) add locations to your map. 
---
This man is cray.  This perk is so good I would spend atoms on it to keep it.  Water and food are easy to come by.
---
Thank you!
---
I'd be willing to bet they all get patched together but only released details about the legendary mod fixes to show they're putting thought into the game changes rather than just addressing clear bugs. I'm pretty sure bobbleheads should never have been self stacking.
---
About the same for me, which was frequently to begin with.
---
Exit out of the trade window and then back in and you should be able to buy it back.
---
A bridge? Simple yet amazing idea. 
---
Yeah I like to do random quests when I have nothing else to do and end up with low level legendaries sometimes.
---
Most the time I drop them in front of a level 15 and spend 5 minutes trying to get them to look at the damn bag. Jumping. Shooting it. Crouching and circling it. Waving to come here. Pointing at it with the taunt (closest I have to pointing).
---
Eventually they walk off all confused and it's like come ooooooon.
---
One in particular was bad yesterday. He'd made a big set of wooden walls around a workshop he'd taken. Obviously, being level 12 or something, he was a little worried about a level 150 in his place. But I spent so long trying to show him the bag of low level stuff. Just TAKE THE DAMN GIFTS!
---
A little sleepy but I'll be fine, thank you
---
I like this door! The building got destroyed somehow but the lock didnt magically unlock. Stuff like this can happen. 
---
Yep, it is.
---
Agreed this guy obviously is ignorant as hell, the highest I've achieved on paper, before any drugs or buffs, as in when I load in and don't use any consumables is 2521 on my bloodied explosive gauss rifle, with drugs I can get 3.5k but nowhere near 10k that's melee territory there....
---
There's a lot of salty tse people in this thread lol.
---
I am a melee build and what I do is clear the adds as the gunners get her to land so there not being hit and staggered while shooting. 
---
   She lands and the I do my damage then back to adds when she flies again. 
---
    Best way I know how to help as a melee build. 
---
Hmmm, I also have a targeting HUD.
---
Note that repair cost was with level 2 contractor.
---
Sooo currently there isn’t much paint for the Xo1?
---
But how is Western any different than the other .44? They are almost identical. Really want them all to have distinct identities.
---
It's easy to find CAMPs. If there are any Raiders interested just look at the map and take a screen shot or use your photographic memory if that's your thing. After a while take another. If people are in the middle of nowhere for a little while they are probably at their CAMP.
---
What platform? 
---
&lt;3
---
Welp, deal with the leechers then if you're so vital
---
If some player with a much higher level approaches, he may be trying to offload stuff and help you. Don't run away.  Look on the ground for a paper bag. 
---
Shishkebab is the way to go with friendly fire. 
---
Thats the fun part though isnt it?
---
Think I got all but the pure crimson flux. And for sure. Ty
---
Nuke Harpers Ferry or hendersonville and get a Super Mutant boss would be pretty cool. 
---
He’s gotta do all the enclave stuff before he can go down there but I don’t see why not
---
This!
---
Here is that attention you wanted. 
---
If you don't want people to see you hovering around your CAMP crouch down it will remove you from the map.
---
Sniper rifle is a modification to hunting rifle so yeah.
---
Street lamp, but build below the light part
---
Also make sure to check all suitcases around vendors , a lot of higher level players will dump supplies in there for lower levels ... enjoy the game :)
---
Not sure if anyone would buy it for that price. There are better medical clothes found for free.
---
Still looking for people !
---
You are inventing an issue that wouldn't exist. Having a hold on a server puts no extra strain on it, it would actually reduce the "strain" on the machine because it wouldn't be processing that players data. It would be no different then if the server had 23/24 players. The problem is managing the communications side of figuring out where a player is and where they have been, and where they have gone to in-order to avoid holds building up for each player. Which would cause more servers to be used then necessary.
---
You would need a separate system from the world servers to maintain the information needed so the world servers aren't processing unnecessary information. Having each server machine talking to each other to figure out if a player joined a new server or not would cause a lot of latency with server and client information. Not just bandwidth wise but processing as well. So having a dedicated machine to process all that information and relay it to the necessary machines would be more efficient. That way you have all the machines communicating to one, instead of all of them communicating to all of them. It would also speed up the process of removing holds on servers so there wouldn't be a problem with excess servers being created to accommodate the rollover caused by a hold. 
---
All of that in conjunction with a default hold time limit of 5 minutes or so (in-case of a full computer crash situations) should make the impact of the new system pretty minimal. All it would take is a new server with decent processing, a new route of connections to the server, and maybe a new world server machine for potential rollover flow during peak activity times.
---
How do you know its duped? Also rank 3 fireproof and torso dense mod will prevent that.
---
You’re just arguing semantics, and this is completely off topic. 
---
As it is right now I clear silos for the XP, and drop nukes on people's C.A.M.P. when they build on my spot.  Thats about it.
---
I'm sorry you were born a ginger it's not your fault
---
Events give plenty of stimpacks and purified water, as well as radaways and the likes. 
---
I would suggest to not buy into the Two shot explosive builds you might see all over the place as they are getting nerfed soon enough.
---
I mean, I could see someone doing it. Maybe to make a point to somebody specific.
---
Shit, I forgot that part.
---
It happens haha
---
Can the bloatfly mod spawn legendary bloatflies like in FO4?
---
Also understand the things in the still dont give tremendous so.  Even after the xp nerf the whitesprings still gives better xp than a silo farm.
---
Because theirs a ridiculous amount of people with massively over powered two shot weapons from asshole dupers (who are not only ruining the game but also making real money witch they should be getting introuble for) who sell them. So in turn Bethesda has to respond to that by nerfing the two shot weapons for all you fuck heads out their who bought duped guns and didn't just do it the right way. Because all those duped weapons is ruining the games economy more then it already is, so the people u should be mad at are asshole, cheating, fuck wad duplicaters who can't just play the game and have fun they have to ruin it for everybody. 
---
Does.this qualify as an automatic rifle then? What perks should I be looking at. Already going for fireproof. The explosive range is bigger than I thought.
---
Np, couldn't make it earlier and will get around to it eventually :)
---
Yeah, the first scorcheast kill was pretty intense and satisfying, Nice work Friend!
---
I’m sorry you’re a virgin and need a stripper pole for your video game house so you can get off since you can’t do it in reality. 
---
Probably because I was wearing stacked X1 armor and I was killed in 1 shot 
---
I’m ok with it because I love stealth. Just seems like all the TSE rifles are the way to go when you get to the endgame. I’m considering staying pistol/shotgun but I’m not sold yet. 
---
I also like PvP. I have an Assassins Black Powder Pistol that one shots anyone I want to mess with. I’ve not found any other pistol yet that I’d consider remotely OP. 
---
Fucking nice man! Great gun for the next update!
---
So accurate.... it hurts me 
---
That's absolutely true, but silo runs are a lot more fun than waiting for ghoul respawns.  I wanna make it more fun.
---
I actually laughed at this
---
Power-armor or Hazmat both work. For plastic, if you wanna stick with shotguns, the watoga high school cafe always has a couple hundred worth in plastic dinnerware.
---
When you get a plan or recipe, check the notes tab of inventory. Use these like consumables to learn the plans. And breaking down weapons will unlock new mods.
---
and the rest of the crew he was playing with all had TSE's.  Lets not act like these are legit floating around.  Most are duped 
---
You can make one with the girter poles or use the power conduit post I seen people use
---
I actually tried that! I'm shit at editing so I was gonna make a text post about it. 
---
I actually found it by accident, saw a guy with the username "Mohamad" something at the power plant.
---
It was okay, not as good as Whitesprings but often doesn't attract the crowd. This isn't a promise, though. It does have tonnes of yellow flux for when you want to destroy camps tho. 
---
No friends to use for transfer purposes sadly or I would’ve done that already lol
---
Well that's not the worst idea. I tried plasma flamer barrel and it didn't work so I gave up on non-flamer weapons. Still, hot garbage without some sort of ranged component other than topping up between fights.
---
I made a possibly stupid decision and would like some help about that quest. So I got it, and then I put it off. After a while, I accidentally hit to stop tracking it on the map and it stopped tracking. I couldn’t get it to restart tracking. 
---
Is the quest just over for me, or is there a way I could get it to restart.
---
You have no soul.
---
:) 
---
There are still less extreme duping exploits in the game. I just reported one to Bethesda a few days ago by submitting a ticket. I hope one day this game will have a somewhat healthy economy.
---
Sigh, 7 times. I'm done with this turd.
---
That does not solve the issue.
---
You have no sex life. 
---
They spawn together pretty often, I've seen the bug multiple times now.
---
Berserkers is literally the worst legendary effect it does more damage the lower you damage resistance and literally everybody uses armor rendering it useless
---
What are the main events you keep an eye out for if you don’t mind sharing?
---
&gt;(how he found mine, I dunno)
---
Would Perfect Storm work with friendly fire?
---
Good song. 
---
Bump the level requirement to 75 and all enemies scale (way) past lvl100 and I'm in
---
This is extremely cozy. [This pic](https://i.imgur.com/ozko8Et.png) is particular reminds me of my student flat. 
---
Nah you should be able to go back, but the other users bring a valid point, do it at lv50. Since it also ends up weighing about 9 instead of 20, so it works out well. 
---
Yeah. I think keeping Molotovs out of it was a mistake honestly. It would be useful as a slow passive heal over AoE and make Molotov’s more than a way to mark enemies for so.
---
Why "sadly I'm rifles"? (I'm fairly new/ lvl 25).
---
it's all the problem, the balence in this game is awful, with half the items being way too weak and like 5 weapons being way too strong and almost no weapons matching what makes sense
---
A way to favorite them at least and then sort by favorites or show them first..
---
Hahahaha i laughed out loud 
---
You’re going to explore and get sidetracked again, aren’t you?
---
Yes it will be buffed by automatic rifle perks however, dont go changing your whole build yet. 
---
Once the nerf goes into effect youll only be doing base damage of 41. Add in bloodied mess for an extra 15%, get adrenal reaction, and all commando perk cards for 60% increase. So the numbers are as follows:  
---
Base 34. 
---
Explosive 7.  
---
Commando perks 21.  
---
Bloodied Mess 5.  
---
Total damage prior to running low health is 66. Look at all that investment after the nerf.
---
Agree, scrapped mine for that reason 
---
&gt; It does have tonnes of yellow flux for when you want to destroy camps tho. 
---
For me the limiting resource is optical fiber rather than yellow flux. 
---
I did my first asshole act today and wrecked another players camp. I hate it when people build their camps next to Whitespring, so that when killing ghouls inside the building, the missile launchers from the camp shoot through the windows at ghouls. 
---
The game can barely handle all the players and ghouls, and when you insert exploding missiles to that situation, my PS4 screams with pain and the only way to do anything is with VATS.
---
After all the chaos, I was surprised that the game was still running, so I took my explosive dragon and my mirv grenades and destroyed that camp(and the owner twice).
---
I wish he/she undrstood what I was trying to say: "Please don't build your missile launchers next to that ghoul spawning building."
---
I still felt like an asshole, and that's because I was.
---
They have SO many toys and cool props yet we can’t display them.
---
They could also pulled a Diablo and have different levels of difficulty with scaled enemies? 
---
I just added a new helm without the HUD on it... We'll see if I have fewer DC's tomorrow.
---
Today I ran for about 5 hours with ~3 crashes per hour.
---
Will re: tomorrow evening
---
Wha...what happened to the old Appalachian Mafia?
---
You can't take a joke.
---
Jesus you sound like a miserable piece of shit.
---
downvoted because there isn't a deathclaw merchant, just another example of this being a broken buggy game 
---
The bombs destroyed em
---
A tip, run pacifist in sqb fights.
---
You're bound to miss a shot and open yourself up to that.
---
Sadly on a team everyone has to do it.
---
Btw one shot from a tse has nothing to do with duping.
---
Explosive two shot is naturally like that without bobble heads
---
Bethesda has made it obvious math is not their strong suit. 
---
I like how they datamine all this winter / Christmas stuff and we get none of it.
---
Well considering what they're doing to TSE's in the next patch - I would wait a couple weeks before changing out your build. 
---
I do exactly that too, also i throw some DR reduction Syringes every now and then if no adds are present.
---
The thing i hate most is Fat Man  users not using pacifist too. Today I lost my junk cause players killed me, not the queen :)
---
I found a dude's camp where he locked his gate, but I could easily hop over the fence because he build it on a decline. Thanks for the workshops, crops and water!
---
I think what matters is the information, not who delivers it. 
---
PS4?
---
Deal
---
I agree. 
---
Be on in 30
---
Whoops forgot to mention I’m on xbox 😂
---
Thissss. I've got dupes of cards that I already maxed out 😭
---
While we're on this topic, I kinda wish that we could trade cards.
---
Bethesda fanboys will excuse anything.
---
What platform do you play on? It's been a long time since I've done any testing, but I did a lot of testing with anti armor and it provided 0 actual damage increase. Tests were against deathclaws and mirelurks.
---
Stop posting on Reddit and get back to scissoring your lover OP
---
I think you mixed up rad-x and radaway
---
Meh, incorrect. Sorry. I only PvE and TSE is stupid over powered. I can three shot scorchbeast and one shot everything else with my TSE combat shotgun.  It's so OP that half the time I don't even run with it because there is litterally no challenge. I point in the "general direction" and things melt.
---
I dont know man, I have found several but then again I am level 300 with almost 600 hours in. 
---
SovietunioninWW2.exe
---
No, you were the hero, the guy with his base there using turrets was the asshole.
---
I saw it happen in a video clip once. Seemed uncomfortable, frankly.
---
Just something to do with these unwanted space/time-takers
---
Is the one at the very beginning still possible or was that patched? I’ve not really tried that hard and never actually used it before, just saw another player do it. 
---
Obviously there’s an issue in the silos with this. 
---
I'm probably missing over 100 atoms at this point. Bethesda claimed to fix them in the last patch, but that was once again a lie. Several bugs they've claimed to fix still exist.
---
I agree that teams should share bounties. Not a perfect solution but better. Any two jackasses working together can run amok with virtually no consequences.
---
I think the ability to destroy camps / moderate griefing has to remain. It's one of the few credible threats we have. 
---
My CAMP is a floor with crafting, a bed, and water pumps.
---
I stopped caring about CAMPS because shit breaks when I'm not around.
---
You're right. He was talking about not wanting to lose mutations, rad-x only ever temporarily suppresses. 
---
Yeah theres a few that were hung up i noticed cleared and i just think they got checked off, but no atoms. Bugs bug me!
---
A bathtub full of prewar money would be awesome 
---
Indeed!   Why do we need the second part!
---
You can be 1 shot by a level 15 with a regular pipe pistol too, sorry you just sound really salty. If you are on xbox I can show you the power of dense and fireproof against tse. The stuff is there but you have to be willing to put perk points into it.  
---
I'm not arguing, I'm just saying not to expect something we may not be getting. Many games have separate modes, and I was just wanting to clarify that new game mode does not equal same game just different pvp rules. I'm not saying we won't get pvp servers, I'm just saying this don't confirm it 100%. Just beware is all I'm saying, take it for what it is.
---
FFFFUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu  Sorry, man.
---
Or just increases the negatives by like 200%.
---
This reminds me of PAYDAY 2.
---
For a really long time, if you were level XXV-100 people would just assume you were a cheater or a troll and kick you from their lobbies.
---
But Fallout 76 has one of the most friendly communities I've been a part of...
---
I do Mutants on all My armor for +50/50, dense in chest, fireproof 3, and its really good .I am immune to scortched beast screams.  My ballistic and energy damage reduction both over 500 sometimes I break 600 in groups. I can face tank almost ever mobs. For ghouls a friend shares ghoulish. and I share radspongs.  There are some amazing non power armor builds!
---
Lol drat oh well sounded interesting 
---
To the far right it’ll say what level perk you need and if it has a lock sign on it you need to equip the card, or level it up.
---
Yeah I hate it when explosives are used it makes it hard find and search adds you kill. 
---
I know you're joking, but INT is tied to XP gains.
---
Well whatever you want to call it, a High Level “Mode” or server would be great. 
---
Meh, I only use one of two heavy weapons .50 cal or gatling gun. The others are a waste of resources for damage dealt. Gatling plasma would have been good but they break too quickly.
---
Dude, if it was about 1 pm eastern in the bog, that was my first nuke I dropped filthy solo style!  Was very excited to see so many people jumping in, even tho we didn't ki the queen.  
---
At least let us have the option to hide the unwanted/used perk cards. 
---
There's a holotape of someone turning scorched, and of course I forget where it is, of someone turning. It was far from instant.
---
An ignore button would be awesome. Tab to ignored filter to find again.
---
It does not stop damage. You can still get a bounty from hitting a camp in Pacifist. Been there, done that, cursed Bethesda's incompetence.
---
Really?
---
I never like to be an asshole in games, because I see the person and don't want to ruin their experience. But more and more I'm starting to see most people are assholes. So whatever. Time to get the Wrecking Ball on.
---
We're probably thinking of two different things. I'm not talking about lore, or RP. I'm talking about the way that games are programmed. For my purposes, I am considering a vehicle as something that you 'attach' to, like a car, or a motorcycle. You get on it, and the way that it is animated has nothing to do with your character animations. Character models have a skeleton composed of  all the points of articulation (hands, elbows, shoulders, etc) that dictates how they can be animated, and power armor attaches to that.  
---
I actually have a lvl 89 power armourless build. I can take three lvl 80 scorchbeats  on my own. 
---
That’s what I was hoping for.  Thank you!
---
I never said I wanted a game balanced around pvp only, whether you like it or not this game is not a traditional fallout experience and should be balanced for both pve and pvp. Just because there going to be pvp server does not make my point invalid melee can still output WAY more damage than TSE can without bobblehead exploits, being able to gap close without risk to yourself is just one advange melee has, there is also no ammo, you burn through so much ammo in this game without ridiculous damage weapons, so much so that as a ranged character(heavy guns/shotguns) I mostly used melee from levels 1-50 simply because it doesn't drain your resources nearly as much.
---
Apparently Monongah has as many ghouls as Whitespring
---
I have found pink, blue, white, brown, and yellow outfits. I have matching hats for white, pink, blue, and yellow. However, I have never seen (or found) a brown hat.
---
I would love to find the Forrest (green one) that someone posted a picture of here. It is really cool looking. I will post some pics from the PC.
---
No, but you probably have to use a combination of high-end and highly modified armour.  
---
The Marine and Combat armour sets can be found in legendary format, and can be made really strong defensively.  
---
It's much easier to just cobble together PA sets, but it can be done with top-quality armour.  But full sets are difficult to accumulate.
---
Its a dead meme
---
Make a bunch of essential communication emotes that don't cost 1000 atoms each, please. Thanks.
---
Ya it’s pretty good useless against scorch beasts but that’s why I took fire proof does some sort of a explosive or fire affect with the sonic blasts
---
Looks really good. It honestly kinda has that Megaton feel to it!
---
Yeah but the problem with TSE isn’t the shot that they’re nerfing, it’s the explosive damage. In particular I think shotguns will notice next to zero change. 
---
On the flip side,  my group has one melee-only player who is the highest level of the group and has a super strength build so he one-shots almost everything before we can shoot them, even legendaries. Tagging system is definitely not ideal. 
---
The pvp system is bad, in fact I'm going to go as far to as to say it is the worst. The pvp system in fo76 is the worst pvp system I have ever seen in a game.
---
Adrenal reaction is the big one here. Bloodied hardly adds much tbh. It's still one of the best but my bloodied gatling gun (with no other buffs or mutations) goes from like 215 ish damage at full hp up to about 280-290 at low hp.
---
Oh my god who gives a fuck 
---
If you find out let me know. 
---
I would like an Account-Wide Stash implimented.
---
Each character is 600 stash. ADD an Account wide  STASH with a limit of 1200 that is completely separate to the Character Stash. This would make moving items around easier and allow us to give items we don't need to an Alt.
---
To balance this a bit make the Account Stash accessible only at 1 place in game.
---
It is something we can already do it is just a real pain organizing it. So you fix several problem with one added item.
---
Got that one. It looks good in the workshop area.  Hope they bring it back for more people to buy.
---
I’ve given up on workshops because of the amount of times the server disconnects or the game crashes. This would fix that and make it worth while. Great suggestion
---
All of it is a problem, I think. I agree that making it so bobble-heads don't stack should be their primary concern (I mean *come on*),  but the fact that one set of legendary prefixes is so powerful that using any other build or legendary type is not just rare but completely impractical damage-wise is clearly an issue with balancing.  In any multiplayer game, no one build or playstyle should completely deprecate or otherwise make obsolete every other build or playstyle.
---
I'm not surprised they're nerfing TSE's, I'm surprised they waited this long. Squeaky wheel gets the kick.
---
You can already crouch to do that. The game has already provided that, if people don't know or don't want to or find it too inconvenient that's their problem.
---
Pretty awesome 
---
Does contractor work on camps? The card only says Workshops so I assumed that was all it worked on.
---
That naked girl is a tall drink of water. 
---
I don’t know why there isn’t a a server chat thing like in arc or I think dayz. I play on Xbox and would Ike it. 
---
Keep checking all the power armor locations. I always end my sessions with more cores than I started, without going out of my way.
---
I want to nuke vault 76 for some reason. 
---
Now it's saying I lack the materials to create the item
---
Somebody downvoted you, but I upvoted you. Because you're not wrong.
---
one of my ideas officially sent in response to the inside the vault call for feedback - a faction like system for player collaborative base ownership leveling - the potential for this to exist when a group of characters accomplishes a base, establishing it at level 1 enabling it to persist in one world, where those players that built it now join to the same place every time, and then allowing them to continue leveling it and add more characters to it if they want to (characters join by contributing to the minimum requirement to be at the lowest level rank member of the base). they could just build it at level 1 and play normal or play the whole game around making their HQ / town cooler and cooler and gaining "real community" recognition as players pass through their server or its posted here (like the cool camps people have made that are towns or are unique ideas built into a specific existing piece of the world)
---
I would rather have the fallout 4 perk system when selecting new perks or equipping them for a specific loadout. 
---
Fallout 4s system was organized, 76s card system right now is 52 card pick up every time I want to do something. 
---
I just tried it and it didnt work.
---
will do good sir
---
You realize I'm not the OP right?
---
And why are you acting like being a homosexual is an insult?
---
Do you have an issue w that? Sounds to me like someone is in the closet. 
---
Today went really well for me. No lag right out of the gate and I even went into a nuke zone with no frame rate issues. Very unusual in my experience. 
---
Wouldn't it be even better if it disconnected the player from the server and gave them a ban. Of course, players could appeal the ban by writing a 1000 word essay on Why it is Bad to make silly suggestions on Reddit.
---
Built a 2nd Industrial Water Purifier (IWP) and hunted down fans for some screws 😂
---
They’re not the only problem. Stop pretending they are. Stop gobbling up other comments and spreading them around as fact. 
---
that's how it is during weekends when the game servers are shit.
---
Heh, I, uh, actually wasn't joking :p  I honestly didn't know what it did so I looked it up, didn't see anything about xp gains.
---
I don't know how accurate it is but one of those wikis says: "Intelligence is a measure of your overall mental acuity, and effects your ability to hack terminals, the condition and durability of items that you craft, and the return you get from scrapping."
---
Just sent you a friend request, it should show as Muldrotha
---
Hey its me :3
---
I don't even play this game, nor do i think it's good.
---
Is it the one you get from doing the BoS quest?
---
You can get plans to make them.  Is this from the Quest reward set?
---
This Nerf is also going to make certain players like myself immortal with the right build to most ranged characters because you don't have enough damage to kill me. This balance change imo has been done to appease the newbies who either don't know anything about the mechanics of the game or know knowing about pvp. Yes it will make pve more of a challenge for ranged but has the effect on pvp I mentioned before.
---
Oh. Yeah. That was your point. Sorry. 
---
Yes same. And the issue is, you can't rediscover a place, or relearn a receipe you know, so there's potential these will never ping unless you start a new character.
---
S post.
---
Two-shot damage is being reduced from +100% to +25% I believe, according to the updated Inside the Vault article, in addition to Explosive damage bonus and range being reduced from +100% of base weapon damage to +20%. It should balance them out quite a bit so that they aren't the only practical weapon/build.
---
[Chillin with the mrs.](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/tempest-storm27/screenshot/11254784)
---
Yeah the water park
---
huh?
---
You dont fuck with Flamingos.
---
I came across a farm close to Cranberry Bog Area and there was battle between garden gnomes and Flamingos. The Flamingos ripped the garden gnomes apart.
---
Again mode and server are not the same thing. They  could have a high level server like you said. All I am saying is that we are getting a new game mode not a separate server type. These are two different things. I don't presume to understand Bethesda and their intentions but the wording suggests something other than what you may be expecting. For what it is worth a server for high level players would be great, and in no way was I disputing that.
---
Do you mind sharing your build and how you achieved it?
---
do you think they will ultimately have to come up wth something a lot more complex and phased mega-server like than the 24 player system that's in use now in order to solve the fact that you just lose the progress of most activities if you have an internet hiccup or game/PC crash?
---
God yes, if only. Lol. 
---
My potentially unpopular opinion. You're level 27. You're not even into mid-game content. Go play the game. You'll come across power armor along the way. Also, farming caps shouldn't be an objective yet. Use perks like pharma farma and scrounger. Explore some places, shoot some super mutants, smash a ghouls head in with a regular sledge hammer. I spent HOURS scraping together the materials to build my excavator armor legs (stupid springs).
---
I was level 60+ before I stopped bumbling into high level enemies and getting myself killed. I was level 80+ before I stopped hoping I had enough healing items to play through the night. I was level 100+ before I stopped struggling to find materials to repair my armor. I was level 120+ before I had a big enough pile of caps to start buying all kinds of random plans and stuff.
---
If you need guns, kill super mutants and scorched and loot the bodies. What you can't use, scrap for mods to make your other guns better. If you need materials then scour buildings. You should be in the ash heap brawling with mole miners and running like hell from scorch beasts.
---
I've spent a hell of a lot of time hauling 300 pounds of weapons to the last workbench I saw so I could break them down to make my friend a drum mag for his shiny new level 30 combat shotgun or whatever we wanted to do. Hey man, how many shotgun shells do you have? 150. I really hope there's plastic in that house or we are screwed. I've got 6 stimpaks and no water.  
---
You realize I am referring to you including the OP as your scissor buddy? Or is your empty teenage mind too slow to comprehend?  Why are you acting like being gay is a bad thing now, too? 
---
When BGS actually hasn't said anything about this but people are making stuff up.
---
Bestbuy, EB, and Gamestop are all sending copies back.
---
Why would they announce something before they have to?
---
Heya ^_^
---
Wait... that's not a thing? What? So many weird little things that this game is missing.
---
I got my first 'Wanted!' by lockpicking someone else's Aid Drop. I didn't take anything, but I put a bunch of ammo inside. Still tho, didn't want anyone hunting me down when I was loaded with junk, so I dropped it all except for one piece of junk. Then I waited at Flatwoods for a level 6 with a pipe pistol to come walking by, I asked him to kill me. 
---
Hope you enjoyed your (1) Raw Rubber and a funny welcome to the game Mr level 6. 
---
Thank you for saying this. You can't have it both ways
---
Something happened I don't get: Sorcery.
---
Today, I did a low-level quest at Morgantown Airport on my new character right before hopping off to play League. As I was leaving the airport, Collision Course started. There was no warning. There was no help. There were just 15 scorched and me, a level 8 vault dweller. I had already started up League since I was almost done, so the event lagged my game out. I died right before it crashed.
---
I'm afraid to go back.
---
Seems legit. By the way, if you think cheating is bad in a game you have to buy, you haven't seen anything yet with free to play games that are easily exploitable. I don't believe it is going free to play from a few images posted on Reddit, but yeah....
---
Jumped online when I got home from work this morning to sell to all the vendors.  Then I prepped some stuff for tomorrow morning's sale run.  
---
I made a post about this too. Stacking bobbleheads is completely broken and OP, more so than any TSE gun. People use a shitload of bobbleheads and pretend like they're better at the game than everyone else somehow
---
I'm impressed by your lack of will to do that quest mate. 
---
Normally i don't like exploits but almost every part of the bunker mission is bugged so fuck it may give this a try or the wall clipping from the start if that hasnt been patched  
---
idk what their plans are but i was thinking regional bosses though,
---
Forest(whereever you can anyways): Critter Army Revenge? Like giant Chickens, Mega Brahmin, Super Radstags? Idk how hard it is to size the character models up but i ferl like it would be as easy as reskinning deathclaws with the chicken model?! Id fuck with it if it was already in the game so why not add it!?
---
Toxic Valley: Super Grafton Monster, just as difficult as SBQ(seemed like a no brainer but i saw somebody stream a Wavy Willards nuke and it was bunk.
---
Savage Divide: Behemoth Army(squad?)
---
Ash Heap: Mole Miner CEO? Idfk
---
The Mire: rotate between Fog Crawler Frenzy/Angler Army/ Giant Gulper Group?!
---
Alot could be done there for sure, even with a Deathclaw horde if you nuke Watoga but not FSP would at least let you change it up when nuking the C. Bog!
---
Turn on Push to talk in all situations. No one wants to hear you cought, sneeze or fart.
---
I am, you still have it? 
---
PS4? 
---
On PS4 I got 4 plans and a (albeit crap) 2* from the Queen this morning. Two times before that just junk/food.
---
How does a lvl 7 not get murdered at the golf course? I'm lvl 25 and too scared to go there still haha :(
---
I don't know if my game is glitched, or if I'm doing it wrong, but I can spend 150+ shells and completely break a brand new shotgun without a noticeable increase in landings, and getting hit with the seizure simulator the entire time one is in range.
---
Yes I've been there!
---
It was on my mini map 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
I agree with alot of what you are saying here. TSE should one shot most things with the correct build, but I think they have nerfed the damage way to much (150%?).
---
Thanks, I hope they allow 2 bases eventually or something..I'd love to have a trader/Inn kinda place.  Even upping the limit would be sweet.
---
Short for "Shit Post", as in "sensationalist title with links to text messages as proof." 
---
It's plausible. Especially with how the game is performing.
---
FO76 is already full of cheaters because they're using an engine that's older than most of their fans.
---
I could help, im level 68 and i got a tse handmade you can use,il provide keycard and everything and please bring healing items and i got ps4,
---
Psn: mat gar  or  Steelking78
---
I have 9 of those [XB1] 
---
For most players, builds, and playstyles, the end game is impracticable without power armor. This wasn't true in Fallout 4, but the high-end challenges and loot rewards in this game are in blast zones, and while there may be exotic gear and builds that let you survive there for extended periods — in which you're very distracted by the game's toughest mobs — almost everyone ends up finding power armor more practical for those fights.
---
you're too kind but I'm on pc.
---
If I could afford to buy the 18 stacks I saw earlier I would have. 
---
Wanting to punch someone in the face has nothing to do with competition, unless it's a fighting sport. Random brawls are done out of aggression and anger and aren't sporting. Also not everyone seeks to prove themselves superior, most just want to play the game. Pvp should definitely be on the back burner for this game and should definitly be focused more on it's own server. The coop part of the game for pvp is solid for the most part and is the experience a lot of fans have wanted for a while. Fallout has always been pve until this game was kind enough to let that kind of community in. 
---
Tl;dr pve should be main focus, pvp on backburner 
---
I am basing this on my own experience and those gathered by others as well as my friends.  I believe I have a right to share others experiences as “fact” because they happened. I am also learning more about this matter by listening to the new commentsIi am getting. Please try to be more considerate.
---
Thats the sad part. I still got the xp boost and I felt dirty about even having it tbh
---
Considering that my camp is around a junk pile that it not anywhere interesting enough for someone above level 10 or so to wander by? Yeah, pretty paranoid.
---
That's not bad! We're pretty light on architectural features, but you might try some fancy roof lines or something if you wanna get a little fancier.
---
[Disco Hall!](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/tempest-storm27/screenshot/11245447)
---
Ok, thought so, just making sure.
---
I think it's more than plausible. Given how the game is performing.
---
Idk about the first one since I figured this one out by accident. 
---
Can’t believe no one said this...
---
THATS HOW MAFIA WORKS XDXDXDXD
---
yes
---
Yep
---
I’d love to see that!
---
Esham is probably meaning "I have perks set up for using Rifles, not Pistols".
---
You are right. I am happy to see that dupers are getting banned and i have submitted tickets on the matter as well.
---
Heyyyy babe nah sorry, Explosive was just so obscenely powerful that it had to go.
---
Sry m8. 
---
Doing 200+ per hit on a machine gun with AoE is just wrong.
---
Mine has always been crash infested. Now it's laggy and crash infested after patch.
---
Must be those dupers and not the shit servers /s
---
Oh I totally agree that it is plausible. Thing is that people come to this sub posting all kinds of crazy stuff and rarely does it end up being true. At this point there needs to be solid proof before anything is believed.
---
Forever and 0 seconds at the same time
---
TSE isnt the problem if you are running pacifist. Duped TSE doesnt mean they can 1 shot you in pacifist. Its the duped bobbleheads which Bethesda decided it was ok for them to stack so you stack enough you can 1 shot anything even if it was just like a pipe rifle. It works the same for melee as well.
---
Could you break down how to get this at the earliest stage? I thought you couldn't get a jet pack until lvl 45 :(. And how do u make sure you get the mutation you want? I want to fly around too! 
---
it's kinda fucked how this sub cover its eyes and ears and pretends everything's alright.
---
I'm not saying the game **is** going f2p but pretending it's not a possibility is asinine. "Bethesda said so", so what? it's not like they care about letting their fans into the loop. or known to be honest for that matter.
---
I'm a level 66 woman, always in fashionable glasses and a clean tuxedo, with short grey hair. 
---
It doesn't help. 
---
I have never successfully given anything away to a lowbie - they either just wave back (and don't take the paper bag of goodies) or they just run away.
---
Went to a Defend Workshop event at a level 16's. She wouldn't stop running from me long enough to notice my waving or the fact that I didn't have a weapon out.
---
You and your friend are fucking idiots
---
Not a single crash or server shutdown ever since the latest patch for me. So it could be something regarding your rig
---
Magazines do not stack. Please do not spread new rumors.
---
Thanks mate! Very kind. I'm level 67 and have some decent gear so it's not that, it's just this guy swooped in at the final control room.
---
..?
---
Haven't played the game, subbed because I love Fallout but.. What emotes are there if there isn't vital emotes such as thanks and sorry? 
---
Nice, I keep hoping to find one. I still think it would be awesome to dual wield them so i can go spinning around spraying and praying like in the commercial. 
---
Anyone who's run the queen much can craft them. The ultracite armor plans drop from the queen. If you're on PS4 I can help you out later tonight.
---
Finally someone with some common sense. There are many games that go FtP after poor performance.
---
If you're on Xbox I can make you a set for free just supply the material cost.
---
5 hp and 95% dad's. Wtf my dude? You okay?
---
Yes. Plus, if I want some pvp action, I can log onto a pvp server today. Then when I get bored of pvp and want uninterrupted quest time, I log on a pve server. 
---
mm if that is the case, I'm pretty much done with fallout 76
---
I lose death bags the most when there are a lot of enemies and I have to keep dying some more times to kill them all to try to get back near the first one.
---
I'll just never use anything in my CAMP great suggestion
---
Hard to be considerate when there are hourly comments of exactly the same thing. It’s not fact because TSE’s were also a problem. You’re trying to minimize their impact by placing all of the blame elsewhere. 
---
Can't speak for consoles but it sure does on PC. 
---
It does work on camps, both on build and repair costs.
---
A reasonable stance to take.
---
It's funny, I played it since almost the beginning and haven't experienced many glitches and didn't crash at all since these new updates, playing the other day experienced three crashes in a hour and a half play through and my wife got caught in an infinite load screen. 
---
Finished belly of the beast,  gathered the silo code pieces for alpha,  crafted 3k 5.56 rounds.
---
I wouldn't call 17 shots "destroying" when tse does it in 3-4.
---
Worked👌👍
---
I just checked out your link.  
---
I agree, nothing note worthy in there, at least nothing interested enough for to spend real money on imo.
---
I do not sort by new so I have not seen them. But I believe that dupers stacking items is more damaging than the item themselves 
---
a quick google got me this [https://www.falloutroleplay.com/](https://www.falloutroleplay.com/)
---
M'lady.
---
Yeah, I'm itching to get more concentrated fire cards and more four leaf clover cards. I can take high level enemies down in 4 seconds with my 10mm-- base damage is only 29 but repeated VATS crits to the head are super powerful. 
---
Any addictions affect junkies, I'm not so sure about starving, diseases or the like, but I know addictions affect it.
---
Strength 15 maxed gladiator end 5 maxed iron skin (or what ever it's called), agility 4 or 5 with maxed agility (or what ever it called) oh and charisma of 9 with maxed lone wanderer. Never once wore power armour and am able to go into nuke zones wearing a hazmat suit. 
---
Mostly created it by accident by being stubborn about wearing power armour. 
---
I had the same thing happen. I got broke just about all my weapons and she was just about defeated... and disconnected. When I came back, I was in a new world next to the Prime Fissure with a couple of healthy scorchbeasts and no help. Same thing... run... run... run. They finally gave up chase, but the glowing mole rats didn't. I lived but barely.
---
The other issue is spawning in a new world where you appear in a blast zone. Yup... I couldn't get in power armor fast enough and Rad-X and RadAway... so I died and came back to repeat until I managed to pick up my stuff and drop the server. I felt like the comment in Moira's shop in FO3 for the Wasteland Survival Guide... 
---
&gt;"If I listen closely, I can hear my genes crying."
---
A) Not me
---
B) Why? There is a huge precedent for games going free when they fail to meet expectations.
---
Oh he got murdered quite a bit haha but I was able to keep some of the ferals away from him. He also decided to set his camp a little too close to the clubhouse even tho I warned him not to. He’s gonna get a nasty surprise when that first nuke hits. 
---
My trick for SB is Shotgun w/ Enforcer
---
I do. I sit there thinking, should I go close my doors? Because you other vault dwellers seem to have been BORN IN A BARN!!!
---
Close my front door at least. Please.
---
Overdrive used to state that it increased critical chance by 15%, now it just buffs critical damage by 15%. I'm not sure if it ever worked, but it sounded like it would have been useful for crits outside of VATS, something I was hoping could be useful in a gatling gun/minigun build since rapid fire weapons don't scale well in VATS.  
---
Nuke deathclaw island, get a two headed deathclaw the sice of a building. Boo! 
---
Yeah I knew you would come back with some whiny response to solid advice. Crouch down and cower in fear like the coward you are or deal with your CAMP getting levelled whenever a Raider stops by.
---
I love Picking this door only to see it open Into the ground, #mothmancultforever
---
TSE doesnt make you able to 1shot people in pacifist. I have a TSE Gauss amongst others that I've either found or traded for and i tested it on my friend using all rifle perks and chems to make my gauss go over 2.5k base damge and I barely took off any health. Duped bobbleheads is the problem thats where it doesnt matter if you have a lvl1 normal pipe rifle or a combat knife you can 1 shot everything. Bobbleheads stack and if you stack enough even the SBQ will go down in 1 shot. I know I've seen it a few times now.
---
It's not a bad thing. That's why I'm wondering why you keep using gay sexual positions as an insult.
---
And if you were referring to me as well as the OP then you should have mentioned me instead of just "OP". It's really not that hard. 
---
I'm starting to see why you are so miserable. You're not very smart are you? 
---
Not smart, funny enough somehow a homophobe - I unfortunately checked your post history - which means you are ultra confused since you're making homophobic statements for insults. Must mean you're not very comfortable w yourself. 
---
Jesus you are just one big confused miserable mess aren't you?
---
Hope that works out for you chief.
---
That argument is getting really old (irony intended). Would it surprise you to know that UE4 is infact older. (Built on technology going back to UE1). And that most games built on established engines are built on "old" engines. The age of the engine has nothing to do with the issues present. And yes im not saying the game is perfect and that there is no issues, but that the issues have nothing to do with an "old" engine.
---
you're dead to me
---
😂😂😂😂
---
My camp is just east of there by the unmarked trapper hut. As long as I don’t get nuked I’d be cool to see people try this place 
---
As a stealth build character, I wholeheartedly agree. 
---
It's whiny to want to use my CAMP?  How's that logic work?
---
Yea hope so, the black bird even more so however!
---
How exciting..../s
---
... Then why are you even here dude? 
---
You pick one perk card of your choice every level, and get a random pack at levels 4, 6, 8, 10, and then every 5 levels after.
---
Scrapping junk puts components in your inventory. Then you can stash them all in your stash box.
---
The game saves automatically, so don't worry about that. Some quests will also pop up a "Checkpointed" notification to let you know your progress in that specific quest was saved. 
---
Not reading all that detritus. You can have the last word, you toddler. 
---
Haha..so im guessing his plan is to set up turrets and lvl up really quickly. Ì got a hazmat suit and ran over there while nuked once but cowered behind the 100 plus dudes. It was touch and go I almost died twice and leveled once but all drops were too high it was pretty stressful but fun as fuck
---
  I'll be going back on my own soon what is a good lvl? 
---
Pvp is the future of the game as it only takes a short time to do all the pve stuff and it doesnt seem like content is being/will be added to keep up with the rate people can beat it
---
After 3 months playing single player you can finish pretty much everything
---
Only player interaction will keep people logging in
---
Legendary clothing
---
Where do they go in the inventory when scrapped at a work station? I've been wondering this...
---
It does. Because they don't improve on its stability. You still can't go above 60 fps without everything fucking breaking. 
---
Comparing this to UE is hilariously off base.
---
Were you using an explosive weapon? Explosive weapons have this awkward bug where damage initially shown can be wrong. They don't properly display damage fall off or explosion resistance and will sometimes make it look like someone in pvp should be dead when in reality you did a lot less damage than you thought
---
Because screenshots of random text messages with your friend are totally solid evidence. 
---
I like how you did the roof on your original camp. I'm stealing that. 
---
 I always forget too.

I felt the same way and didn't go until I was in the high 30s. Finally screwed up my courage and went because I was desperate to get the bearskin rug plan, haha. It was fun and a nice way to level quickly and I was kind of sad I hadn't gone earlier. 
---
Just make sure you don't have junk on you in case you die, have some stimpaks ready to go in your inventory wheel and go. Explore the grounds closest to the resort hotel first. If you start to feel overwhelmed you can always sprint back closer to the robots, who will start attacking any ghouls that get too close to the property.
---
Go have fun!
---
I don't think it's a typo, but perhaps rounding?

Two times today I've launched a nuke and was disconnected from the server. Yesterday I launched with a team, was disconnected and when I returned the nuke disappeared for everyone. I've gotten used to be disconnected but it would be nice if you could reconnect to the world you were disconnected from. I'm not sure how difficult of a code it would be though, so more of a suggestion.
---
I've also had multiple mods disappear from my inventory. The calibrated shocks have been the most disappointing by far. Just an FYI. 
---
I feel like it may be alot also but honestly we cant tell until the patch.
---
The junk tab.
---
The repair cost isn’t that big though. I see nothing there that would be difficult to replace. The 7 screws is probably the most annoying, but even then not too big of a deal. 
---
Got a friend with me that wants it as well. 1k caps for two marsupials? 
---
😂😂😂😂😂 I know games never go free to play after they have proven to be financial failures 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Mine was delayed a bit before it registered the kills
---
I ran around in a damn clown costume for hours. Never found the wendingo.
---
I'm interested in Fallout. 
---
F2P done right is fine. More players pumping money into the game only benefits me, and everyone else continuing to play.
---
F2P done wrong would be the same disaster as the game no longer being worked on, or shut down.
---
If the game is going F2P, im going to wait to see how that is done, before burning the house down.
---
B) There is plenty of precedent for this happening. It's more than plausible.
---
Not at all, just goes to show u really dont have a clue what your talking about. Since I am not actually comparing the two engines technologically, but based on age. Nor will I get into an argument over which engine is better, dont really care. But the fact remains that UE4 is built on a core older than Bethesdas engine, and therefore according to your argument should have a lot of issues if age was the only determining matter.
---
I have been able to activate multiple ones and the rumor does not seem new given other discussions. But I will take your word for it
---
It’s a common mistake. Definitely not something a maniac would do.
---
End game armor can pretty easily rival power armor in terms of resistances, and then you stack legendary effects on top of that. Non power armor builds are reliant on good legendary rolls, pretty expensive to maintain, and really bulk you down on weight since you need to be wearing heavy variants of your armor. That being said on the flip side non power armor builds will generally get more damage mitigation than non power armor builds 
---
Not to mention, every location discovered is logged to your character for exp and progression stats. 
---
It would be so easy to scan and say, hey, this guy has discovered "QAsmokeroom" (or w/e it's called).
---
It's only a matter of time before these exploiters are out.
---
I'm biding my time till the servers are cleaner. 
---
This is amazing.
---
You get perk packs every 5 levels (I believe)
---
After scrapping you will have to put the items in your Stash
---
For the most part just stick near Flatwoods and The Forest area, its the low level part of the map and will usually have low level players
---
And for forcing a save i don’t think there is a way, i just leave the server and i haven’t had any progress get rolled back.. at least that Ive noticed
---
I'm a level 66 and play with a level 54. We just like checking out other peoples' camps. Our biggest problem is getting lower levels to accept our gifts of chems, armor and plans.
---
Did it then disappear from your stash?? I don't have room to spare for random mods, and I can't figure out how to use them.... i feel super lame.
---
This game sucks solo. If you want to play solo, you might as well play/replay fallout 4 which had way more content, had interesting characters, infinite stash etc.

---
You skip the whole process if this still works 
---
Is there a specific server we choose? I just kinda started the game and have been going. 
---
The age is important because it's basically the same as it was 15 years ago. UE isn't. The proof is right in front of your face because of how hilariously broken Bethesda games are.
---
It doesn't matter how old the platform is, it matters what they've done in that time. That was the point. A point that wasn't that hard to follow.
---
Well I got 5 of 5,56 and 5 of .45 ammo... And that's it
---
Wait, you mean the game whose hitboxes are good enough on objects that you can sneak a bullet in a tiny gap and hit an enemy, doesn't make your hitbox smaller when you CROUCH?
---
come on bethesda wtf lmao
---
Hehe...I did that to a level 2 fresh out of the vault but I used friendly emotes.
---
No, there isn’t a way to pick a server. If you want to find low levels just try server hopping until you find some.
---
Hardened Mass scraps into Ultracite and isn't protected, so that's another thing.
---
F
---
Again u talk out of ur arse. You have no idea how engines work. The engine is not basically the same as it was 15 years ago, I could go ahead and list the thousands of differences that exist, but im sure you wouldn't even understand 1% of them. 
---
And i am not at all arguing over whether they are bug riddled games or not. I am just proving ur points are completely invalid and that you shouldn't trying arguing what you do not understand.
---
And you care because...?
---
On Bethesda plz list. Reported.
---
I doubt it. Seems like he just didn’t know which way was up and slapped his camp down somewhere he thought was nice. I started rushing nukes around level 20. I would just dump my junk and go in to peck at bloats and get xp. There’s a little ledge in the clubhouse parking lot that I’d stand on to keep safe and use my black powder rifle. I’d easily level up twice or three times per nuke zone just by landing shots. But my camp is right in the golf course, just outside the usual nuke zone, so it’s easy to run back and forth. 
---
"You're a blizzard, Dairy." \~Hairy King
---
Or just have an option to sort by type instead of by weight or value. 
---
Difference is I've provided examples, and you keep blabbing about how smart you are.
---
Go ahead and bump the game past 60 fps and tell me how stable that old ass engine is lmfao.
---
They mentioned on the last stash increase that they were basically going to see how it affected server stability. 
---
Here's the problem with that: Right when they did that, everyone started duping all the fucking time and WRECKING the servers.
---
So, until they get that under control completely, and manage to actually observe how server stability is affected by the increased stash sizes, I wouldn't expect any increases in the stash limit just yet.
---
This makes sense. I mean it's not like we couldn't be able to tell if another player was mutated in some way. The only ones I think wouldn't have any actual physical changes associated with it are Empath, Herd Mentality, Carnivore, and Herbivore. (I might be leaving one or two out)
---
Hmmm from what I tried so far I havnt seen Bloodied get less than a TSE yet tbh the difference is usually like 200 dmg fully buffed up 
---
Why you gotta be such a creep mr. E? ;) Sorry I missed ya today. I may be around tomorrow. 
---
Ah shit, you’re right. It just has poor RR
---
I have the same set up for some reason saying we all float down here makes people run away.
---
Enola Walker, very end of glassed cavern
---
PVE has basically no challenge, with TSEs it's a joke. In an open world rpg, other humans have the potential to be the most unpredictable and dangerous enemies. We kill and betray, form and break alliances to be on top, pvp should absolutely be an important part of the game unless some drastic changes are made to PVE content
---
... Most people were asking for TSE to be nerfed, at least to some extent
---
Thanks man, hope you guys enjoy!

Let me clarify - I'm waiting for a moddable single player, not online version. Basically what I want is a new FO4 map that modders can fill with awesome content!
---
All three would be fabulous.
---
Absolutely! Thanks again man! Not sure if you could hear me or nah, but we both thanked you! 
---
I was just about to suggest his series on him nuking places other than Whitespring. Monongah seemed very promising.
---
FTP done right. Coming from the people who brought us the $5 bush decoration. Let's just say I'm not confident.
---
Thank you
---
For steel farms, go to the golfclub and take the can chimes hanging and the side entrance, they give about 9 cans each and each can gives 2 steel,  
---
for lead. head to the gym in the charlestone fire department and take the weights in there.
---
server hopping at these places makes it a cakewalk to farm houndreads of each in a short time.
---
It was the same for me. Used to never crash and now after each patch it gets worse. Got on for the first time in a week or so today since I’ve been busy and wanted to kill the SBQ but after wasting my time going through Silo Alpha 4 times only to be reset every time I’m done for the night. 
---
Super cool! I'm on PS4 as well, if you're ever looking for a teammate or to trade hit me up :)
---
Lol. Itll still be good. 
---
That’s over repairing. I can do the same to my T-51b, do I really need to post a screenshot to prove you wrong? You can look up all the PA stats on various Wiki pages, anything you can do to T-60 you can do to T-51b
---
So does this mean you'll come here and shit on people playing the game after it goes ftp?
---
Shit good tip I may do that tonight
---
I agree!
---
That would be amazeballs.
---
This is where wood armour shines.
---
You still get the legendary effects of armour but next to no damage resistance 
---
That's not true. I have seen a bunch of players in the Train Station after killing the queen. Usually a team + some random bits like me. So 5+ players is not that uncommon. I also noted that while people are waiting for the Vendor Bot they are on their pip boys. Not unreasonable to assume at all. I have been killed by another player fighting robots and blowing up car next to me along with another player. That sucked. Fortunately we respawned and the player fighting robots had kept running and left our stuff.
---
No you keep dragging up a single point that u go on as evidence, and to a point that im not even arguing on, I never once argued your point that the engine is stable/unstable at different FPS, so why you keep dragging that point up, is beyond me, coz again, this has nothing to do with the age of the engine. 
---
I do a lot of work with different engines, so I understand how complex they can be, and also how fickle they can be, especially given the ages of some of these engines by now.
---
yeah there was a post on the fo76 forums by Jurassica about how they have started a temp suspension / ban wave on anyone who has exploited excessively. On phone so can’t find link again, but I’m sure you’ll find it if you dig enough
---
What makes you think I'd do that?
---
Make sure it is all in your stash not on u it's a new bug

Foundation, stairs, 64 small tiles, white curio (whitesprings resort) and black curio (default, everyone has them) end tables with busts on them to represent black and white chess pieces.

Let my opponents create their own pieces.

I've been playing since November and have only run into two outright jerks in the game. Most people are friendly and helpful.

It would be cool if we could find different tapes around the map and load em into the jukebox
---
It just might.

It’s been the exact same since FO3. I don’t expect that to change anytime soon. 
---
I'm not sure, I'm yet to use them 
---
Me too.
---
Keep a list of the plans you learn. It'll save you a lot of caps/frustration later on. Any chance you're on PS4? I always have extra plans and am happy to make armor or weapons for new players.
---
I was able to pick up a machete off the first body down the stairs to the left outside the vault. There's also the farm at the first intersection you could probably pillage for one. There were scorched there the last several times i went by.
---
You keep on saying so many games have gone free 2 play, but you haven't mentioned which ones?
---
The sever mod on the western does more damage and the western goes up to level 50, where the 44 stops at 45.  Other then that, not much difference. 
---
What's nice about it tho, is crits always hit.
---
Yup that was it thank you so much
---
Lmfao don't try to revive him you might accidentally fast travel somewhere lol

Please post his response when you tell him hes been banned for duping

I just want to be able to display my Bobbleheads!! Lol

Right now I'm using a gatling with 6 points worth of heavy gunner and 12% cripple from luck and working on the armor pen. Its pretty decent too for ghoul farming, until they get close.
---
300 caps bluntnote. I will buy
---
You seemed orgasmic at the thought of the game going ftp and that would somehow negate the idea of people actually playing a game they enjoy.
---
Persistence turns this game into a full time job. No thanks. 
---
Yes... Yes we do
---
If I can get the 10mm plans and get some mods that should help too I suppose. It's all standard right now
---
If only, i mean scorch beasts dont pose a threat really, they are just annoying, and we should have something to battle the annoyance.

---
Ah I play on Xbox, but thanks anyways!
---
Cool, thanks for the info. Temp suspension huh? Did it say how long? He is a good friend IRL and I generally like playing the game with him. His arguement is "I paid the same amount as everyone else for the game, its Bethesda fault for not fixing the issue beforehand or even sooner, like buying a TV and telling me I can only watch certain channels." Which I understand and agree with to a degree, but I dont see the fun in it playing that way.
---
And to add they seem to be doing it based on having more of a given item than is feasible. So if OP was gifted a dupped item from their friend they should be fine.
---
There’s a workshop in the mire too that gets attacked by anglers. At least the 2 times I took it it did. 
---
I did, see response to 1st comment
---
I had a bad experience and it has made me paranoid too. Now when I play, I'm constantly checking my base to see if anyone is around it. Otherwise I don't worry too much when I'm out and about. Level 67. 
---
Gotta agree. It’s a dumb mechanic.
---
I unlocked it... I regret it
---
It's getting out of hand really is, but I also agree that bobble heads are pointless I haven't even used one I just keep em stuck in my stash 😂
---
I did some basic testing and couldn’t get anything faster than 20%, which is what all the speed mods add. Even strange in numbers didn’t seem to boost speed demon any faster. It was pretty basic testing but all my results were within a few percent of each other, no where near enough for anything to stack beyond 20%.
---
I agree with you that they need to not let PvP ruin the PvE (and co-op) game. This is a Fallout game not C.O.D. or Fortnite. And most of us Fallout fans wanted a co-op game that we could play with our friends, and show off what we've built.
---
But the TSE needed needed because it was OP. Yes us Fallout fans are used to something like that but we're playing multiplayer now and it can mess up other players gaming (killing a bunch of mobs in one shot that other people can't get hits on). 
---
Been happening to me quite a lot too. I had to jump servers three times the other night because people kept following me around and stealing kills, attacking me, etc. Super irritating, to say the least.
---
Seeing as how some "trophies" like this are already in game assets (check the hunting lodge), should be an easy addition.

If this was the Steven Universe fandom I'd say that it's really a sapient deathclaw vendor, and it's possible (maybe now, maybe only at some point in the future) to meet it alive. And I'd probably be right!
---
But it isn't, so that's likely just a pipe dream and it's likely just a bug.
---
Look, what I'm saying is I want to date a deathclaw.
---
You'll have to do some tinkering. Addictions don't show up in your status page, so you can only tell if you have an addiction because of phantom negatives to your stats. Good luck!
---
We do. It’s called the attack button. 
---
"IT JUSTS WORKS"!
---
Yeah I hear ya. 
---
Dude the pve in this game is awful right now. Everything dies super fast besides sbq which is just a bullet sink.
---
And I know you read it. And you know that I know that I'm right.
---
Sad. 
---
Someone got their base wrecked lol
---
Apparently you have to nuke it while Scorched are spawning there though, otherwise you'd get a bunch of mole miners instead. So it's pretty situational.
---
Thanks I had no idea about that
---
\+1% per mutation is how I would do that
---
To actually combat your friend, Jurassica actually even made a comment on people like your friend using that excuse. Somewhat word for word: “We are aware that people seem to think ‘it’s a part of the game’ and continue to do it. But doing so violates our code of conduct and does not give you the excuse to do so.” But yeah, they seem to be doing a temp suspension in that if you submit some type of reply to them that you won’t do it again or something then they’ll give you a chance again. Don’t really know how strict they’ll be with this but there’s a decent chance your friend might get his acc back
---
&gt;I just want to plant my corn and tatos in a nice neat level area.
---
I would pay Atoms for this!
---
AFAIK, if you get the ban email it is indefinite but you can appeal. As for his opinion, it's just that. In the TOS they outline how they can terminate your account at their sole discretion. As they mentioned in the recent "inside the vault" they take exploits "very seriously" and will continue to "identify and remove problem players"
---
are you on PC?
---
Im ok if it only suppresses the mutations effects **temporarily** like 1 or 2mins, not completely remove it.
---
If it doesn't attract a crowd then more loot for you.
---
Even with the overwhelming evidence of copies being sent back, the Stockholm syndrome here is still strong
---
There's no such things as Factions in this game.
---
Just 4 guys you do a couple of quests for and move on.
---
The constant disconnects is why I don't bother launching nukes anymore. Fix that first.
---
That was my thought. I know I've seen music stores in the map on my first run around and it would make since that the world would be left with more music. Kinda wish we could find time capsules... I know it's a bit cheesy or treasure map like but just music and news/plans related would be cool 
---
Why are you not running in Pacifist mode while fighting the Queen? 
---
This. Take an upvote!
---
Yeah, I was so sure as to why you needed a specific type of enemies, I'm assuming because the Scorched turn into ghouls in a blast zone where as mole miners turn into glowing ones. But it was awesome to see nonetheless.
---
While I completely agree the atom shop items are well overpriced, if they continue down the same path (except maybe add items at a higher rate), I can live with that.
---
I can’t get it to progress from the elevator 
---
Interesting, I guess I didn’t notice that in game, although I have like 30 of them hotkeyed so I haven't really seen the item description since I made my last batch awhile back. I wonder if there is a way to confirm if still affects crit chance outside of vats or not.
---
Under Application Errors within Event Viewer it states the faulting module was “MsiGamingOSDx64.dll_unloaded”. Exception code was “0xc0000005 “. Checked all my recent errors and found them to be caused by this. Disabled the OSD and have been crash free since. Obviously can’t confirm that this will be the same for other systems but it has certainly improved stability for me.
---
I also made sure all drivers were up to date, verified the game files and restarted the computer.
---
You can go more than four levels high if you build both above and under the camp’s placement spot (a ledge or a bridge for exanple)

Didn't realize I needed to, but alright, just a few off the top of my head.

The power armor storage IS confusing. In your inventory or stash, all power armor is shown as 'power armor chassis' and just looks like a naked frame with no armor. There's no way to differentiate them in your inventory; you have to select them and set them on the ground to see which is which. I really thoroughly enjoy doing this with 8 different chassis every time I need to find one specific suit or change out a piece...
---
Just don't ever scrap a chassis from your inventory without setting it out and checking it first, because it may well have armor pieces on it, which are then lost forever. Any fusion cores also vanish then, so if you want to scrap an extra frame at some point be sure to empty it out first!
---
I think you're projecting. I simply posted evidence that suggested what most considered inevitable for a while.
---
That’s what makes gift giving fun, fire a few rounds in the air to get their attention, run full speed at em and wave, I personally like to fast travel ahead of em and wait see how many times I can make em run back and forth before they get the picture I’ve got a gift for them
---
Oh and there  is a marketplace, it's r/fo76bazaar

Not with the current "you must be a duper and I must harrass you" meta that is going on and perpetuated by this sub.

You literally can't play with anyone lower level than you lest you get harrassed.
---
Gotcha, and no for the record I've taken nothing from him but a regular old lvl 25 power armor arm I couldn't find server hoping for hours
---
yep..
---
If it does go FTP what would you be doing differently now?
---
True on both points
---
We've got the same camp location.  I think it's a perfect spot as it's right in the middle on the opposite side of the vault.  Makes fast travelling around a little cheaper.
---
Also the view of the big radar dishes is amazing.
---
A guy in our group uses endangerol syringes on the SBQ. Lowering the damage resistance of a boss by 75% for a few minutes, definitely isn't a bad idea.

Just made YongYea and his sheep happy.

Doooode! This corn bread is going to make my food truck blow up! Cahpow!

Yes! Right as they complain, take out the blueprint, and say "checkmate".

Yeah don’t justify dupers. They’d do that regardless because it’s the only thing in their meaningless little bitch lives that makes them feel powerful.

I’d actually play a little bit more after being underwhelmed by the beta, if it becomes F2P.
---
But I shouldn’t be surprised given the tepid response to this game. 
---
Today I took over 2 workshops. Farmed some much needed lead and aluminum. Did some Enclave quests, and mostly got sidetracked, and collected way too much too carry around. Let go of some old faithful weapons and got some new ones. Every day is an adventure in Appalachia. 
---
Not fully inevitable.  Game could have shut down or go full maintenance mode which it still may.
---
I wonder why people like you are so concerned that any FO76 players are made to feel bad about this.
---
Agreed
---
Ive spent the last 2 days hauling my aid items around from vendor to vendor to clear my stash.
---
Today I am at 500/600 pounds. Granted I have 2 almost complete sets of power armor in it that I am saving — but we neeeed more room.  
---
I would love to see a single shot, bolt-action pipe shotgun.  Or a blunderbuss style shotgun with trumpet barrel.  
---
Did you mean video or video game?
---
If someone hit me with a radx, rad away combo syringe I would be a sitting suck. Instantly over encumbered and cant even jump out of the way of bullets

I said the T51 has best DR but I said T60 best all around. And that’s not over repaired I need to repair it just haven’t did it yet..

The same thing happened to me. Another group entered as I was doing this event. If you aren’t teamed you won’t get credit, even if you are inside. I spent hours when it happened to me. I have since completed it. 
---
Thank you!! I’ve been trying to piece together how these work lol I miss being able to just display my power armor in my base in fo4. I’ll check it all out!

I've said it plenty of times im in favor for this change because of random dcs it some crucial moments but i want it to be added at one non negotiable condition: Make it optional only.
---
Like a when you hit Play it asks you if you want to go on the previous world or find a new one *every time*.
---
If i want to server hop because im trying to find something and it's not there, i don't want to be forced to go back into the world i just was in.

PS4 I can build you one.
---
We should be able to trade them in perk card points so we don't have to worry as much about clutter and making sure our build is heading in the right direction so we can go back to rebuilding MERICA!
---
As a heavily mutated enclave member, I think this is a good idea
---
I wanted FO76 to be good and succeed just like anyone else. There aren't factions here. Just gamers wanting good games.
---
Some people are more willing to accept reality than others though.
---
I think you need to learn to let go... If you're not using it you probably don't need it. This is the adjustment I've had to make from other FOs.
---
I don't have any guns in my stash... Experiment with them if you need and sell/give them away if they don't benefit your playstyle/character 
---
Agree. I have three sets. Such a pain. 
---
I hope you have those power armors on a frame and stowed that way, as the frames with or without armor are 10
---
Awe, so adorable! 
---
I wait for my friends to get a shot in before I attack, but with only five or six levels difference I could see how that would happen though. 
---
I'm at 21 and just feel like I'm grinding. Explored most of the low level areas but I cant move to higher areas. Using a shotgun. With 88 damage, nodded ski sword, and fire axe. 
---
Only 1500 atoms each👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

Sorry :-(

I was trying to team with the guy but they wouldn't.
---
Oh well, I'm resigned now to doing it again and doing it honestly, and that guy won't be able to claim it honestly.
---
Ah ok so you meant to imply I hate people who smack talk video games I may like.
---
No I just don't respect people who don't actually play or have any knowledge of what they talk about.
---
Yong is the same as the Cleanprincegaming and downward thrust.

I’m up for it, if you don’t mind a nuke greenie (lvl 80+ and never launched a nuke before =p)
---
Umm...they are already handling the TSE situation. By the end of the month, TSE will receive a huge Nerf. You solution of trading them for PA paints would only reward the dupers that created the problem.
---
I couldn't agree more. The game needs a reason for people to play long-term or come back to the game after they stop playing.
---
Took 4 workshops when I first entered the game today. Spent the next couple of hours defending them til I gave up on all but Grafton Steel and ammo factory. 
---
I use western revolver as a primary on one of my guys lol, thing smacks, but I want a 10mm for sure now I just gotta find one lmao 
---
I can definitely agree and in the next update Bethesda told us two shit is only going to be 30% more damage and explosive is 1 fifth of the power 
---
I think mod support needs to come as soon as possible for the future of this game.
---
But then if you only have a single mutation or two it won't even be a full point of damage for many weapons, and would just be pointless unless using mutations that are not optimal for your build.
---
I think it's because it was designed as a survival game akin to Conan Exiles and Ark which really don't really allow for proper questlines and other factors of single palyer rpgs.
---
I was on a server when Poisidon powerplant area was nuked. So many glowing dogs. That’s about the only thing worth mentioning. 
---
The flamer healing people would be amazing, but yeah could never use it as a primary weapon
---
They increase the passive bonus of the stats. 
---
I disagree. Embrace it for a while. I have been over encumbered for over a month. Only using 3 weight reducing perks and speed demon mutation. As long as I stay under 1360 I get around pretty well. I spend more time in locations that I used to skip over fast traveling. I find all kinds of things I previously missed and random encounters. I have everything I could possibly need and more. Gifting ammo weapons and aid to low levels is a plus. My stash is filled exclusively with junk. In case I get killed and DC before picking up my bag. 
---
Honestly I’d work on scraping together a full set of PA. I’m currently a lvl 42, and it was tough for me around lvl 25 too because everything was either leveled way below me or way above me. Once you get PA everything becomes way easier. Trash mobs are no problem. You can carry more weapons and aid and important shit and work your way through higher level areas even if the enemies are supposedly 2x or more your level. 
---
I’ve enjoyed about 120 hours at $40.  That’s 30 cents an hour so far.
---
Seems like an absolutely terrible arguement from  Bethesda or Jurassica imo, it definitely gives you the right the issue shouldn't have been allowed to stand this long, MONTHS after the release. Not that I advocate for duping or agree with the idea because I dont but that's just a lazy argument to me. I get maybe I'm defensive because he is a friend but if you allow it to happen this long and turn a blind eye you are just as guilty as the accused party
---
Metal Gear style.
---
What about :
---
A-HD
---
A-CH
---
A-LA
---
A-LL
---
A-RA
---
A-RL
---
O-HD
---
O-CH
---
Etc..
---
Using A for armors, O for outfits, or C for costumes etc.
---
And using LA, LL, RA, RL, etc feels more natural when I read it out loud as "unabbreviated." (left arm, instead of arm, left)
---
They stated in their last inside the vault thier plan for tse. Ts is being reduced from 100% bonus to 25% . and E is bwing reduced from 100% to 20%. This will bring them more iin line with the rest of the effects and help with making other effects more desirable.
---
Actually I use pretty much all of them, because I'm just now getting to the point of being able to consistently make ammo for myself. It's all rifles and heavy weapons. I was originally spec-d as a rifle PA build, but after seeing how well the OG Gatling gun is, that might be what I start using. The .50 hmg just burns ammo too fast. 
---
At least you got loot. Mine usually get stuck loading it. Or I crash before I can loot her.
---
I found garage door plans at the entrance to one of the silos. It was before you get in the elevator.
---
It was shitty practice sure but you're still stuck on that ? Move on man. They lowered prices.
---
That's not really a lot is it and which one off those are aaa? I like to think back to no man's sky and think of the mess that was when it was released, no support was given and nothing was said for a long time. It never when free to play and now look at it. You say fallout 76 is failing, but they have made massive improvements since it's release two months ago.
---
thanks!
---
I guess the perks that reduce weapon and ammo weight would be your friend then
---
So far so good, just remember quests once done are done and are level based, so if you finish a quest that rewards a weapon that weapon will be the level you completed it at .. also hit up whiterun for some ghoul on ghoul action and some quick levels especially if some higher levels are there .. and to the east uranium fever usually 3 legendary miners per run, again let the high levels run in first. Another good place for legendary enemies is monogoh and watoga high school(put on the mask), plus the med center I think it is, seems like every time you enter that particular building you get a legendary.
---
I've been over since the beta. I have a few, non maxed weight reducing perks, and I'd like to get rid of them other than probably bandolier. 
---
I'm sure someone will correct me, but most of MMO's I can think of have shared banks.  Mules are not PITA and every game I've played has some version of a mule it's pretty much inescapable.  Friends transfer stuff to each other NP.  Also,game is like $30 or something - not even a big deal to have another account run it on a laptop.  I am fairly certain they will share bank accounts just like most of the MMO's out there.  
---
That would be pretty shitty to me. Honestly I’m running out of reasons to play as my friends all dropped it for games that don’t crash.
---
Sucks...I was so excited to play fo multiplayer 
---
Awesome CAMP... terrible video. 
---
Turrets eat up a ton of your camp budget and aren’t really that helpful.  If you find your camp being attacked often, move.
---
Also equip ‘Good with Salt 3’ so they take forever to spoil. Makes it good to gather hundreds and them sell them thr next day and the day after that too.
---
This has been a staple in other fallout games why is it a problem now?  Invest in weight perks: bandolier, pack rat, traveling pharmacy, batteries included.  It helps a lot 
---
Nah. I paid $60 for a AAA title. I want the full game. Not cut out items sold at a THIRD of the full game price. I understand why you gave up the fight but I won’t let down on these scummy practices. 
---
Yes, you definitely can do this.  For whatever reason, I've never seen the red HUD indicator in Watoga.  Things just seem to explode from out of nowhere.
---
If it is the case that the cars die too quickly for the indicator, I don't know why instant-exploding cars need to be a thing.  I know this is a common griefing tactic as well - to shoot the car next to a player.  It feels like both problems would be solved if the car, on health depletion, unconditionally gave a 2-3 second warning before exploding.  They make a big deal out of robots exploding, after all.
---
No way, you are telling me people will cheat to get BiS gear instead of actually doing work to get it? Everyone needs to stop acting like people abusing exploits has anything to do with game mechanics. If the exploits are in the game people are going to use them, it has nothing to do with the rng on sbq drops and that is so silly to think that. 
---
Basically, anyone can attack but their damage output is reduced until you attack them. If you do, there will be no damage restriction. Turning Pacifist on means you won’t be able to « engage » PvP (or full damage) because you can’t hurt others. There are exceptions though (e.g. claiming a workshop already owned). 
---
Most people.
---
More weapons = more cool
---
We need one that says "hey you oblivious idiot I'm not trying to bother you there's a pile of free shit over here that might interest you".
---
Thanks for the offer but the guy above helped me figure it out :)
---
\*Laughs in Fireproof 3 + Dense mod + Dodgy + Lone Wanderer\*
---
I thought that was the one this thread was about :p
---
You and me both. The game is actively trying to make me not play it and I'm running out of fight. Soon enough I'm just going to take the hint and shelve this p.o.s.
---
Wish I had
---
Navigate to your ini files and in Fallout76.ini make this part like this … (user/documents/games/fallout76)
---
\[General\]
---
sMainMenuMusic=
---
bPlayMainMenuMusic=0
---
Thanks!
---
Other games had separate storage containers. And unfortunately the percent increase damage perks are preferred. 
---
Is that enough to make you suicide-proof? 
---
Yep someone did the same thing to me a week ago after I had just spent hours and tons of resources on building it and since I used all my wood and steel on building it and I can't repair until I get more, I just haven't played. Yeah it's easy to get both, but when I need a ton to fix every wall, every floor, every door, every workbench, the desire is gone. Thanks Bethesda. 
---
Just block them and reload into another server next time if it bothered you THAT much. 
---
Trying to get the door open again? I feel ya. 
---
I can do the silos by myself no problem but the last one I definitely kept checking my map at least ten times throughout.
---
True but that’s where strategy becomes involved.  You have to decide which perks are more important to your play through 
---
I have half a raider set :). I'll look up where to complete it. These tips are great thanks pals
---
Yep, I did the same thing once back when I was new  - looted a toolbox at someone's workshop and got myself wanted. Picking other people's locks (workshops or camps), hacking workshop terminals, and of course breaking something in those places are all things that will get you wanted.
---
Fast travel before logging to force a save. Ive never had a huge loss, but sometimes you might crash and miss out on the last few minutes of looting
---
1 strategically placed can be helpful, especially a missile turret.
---
More than enough so.  
---
At a CAMP, nah. At a Power Plant, 🤨
---
Ive tried looking for information on furious and the only post I found was really old and said something about a stacking 10 or 15% bonus up to 100%. It said you could miss shots and be fine, just dont hit other targets.
---
Thats really disappointing if it is indeed capped at 30. I wish bethesda would just reveal the mechanics behind legendary effects.
---
Have you done the fire breathers quest ? Or The Mistresses quest line ?
---
Also I wouldn't worry about farming legendarys or gear until you hit 50. Seems like your doing fine, just enjoy it, there's not much in terms of end game yet besides dropping nukes, which is fun dont get me wrong but if i were you I would not be in any rush to get to that point and just have fun in learning the map, developing your character and maybe finding a cool spot for your camp.
---
This is the kind of shit that makes me worry for the future of this have. This has been present for three months and reported for two. It seems like a *simple* fix, yet it hasn't been addressed. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of things like this in the game.
---
The you’re not trying hard enough to crank up your damage. 
---
Just use Scrapper and pick up everything during Uranium Fever.  9 steel for each gun.  I literally get hundreds of steel each time I do the event.
---
I already did
---
I've had many beers and doobies and am in no way trying to be pro so the video may be a bit rubbish.
---
neato
---
Another issue, if you die you get sent outside. If another group enters the silo after you you will need to do the whole card thing again in the silo. The red energy gate blocks you. Also, if they start the launch while you are outside the whole silo locks and you can’t get in. Depending on what junk you dropped it might be an issue.  
---
I was the exact same. A big game changer for me was making sure I had as much lvl 20 stuff as possible.  I ditched my old guns and lost some scopes but after a little more time my new guns are better than my old and it made a world of difference. 
---
you can tell a marsupial from a mile away.
---
The only thing that makes it a little bit easier is if your PA has a paint job from the Atomic Shop - then it shows in tour inventory with the little icon next to it, so I can keep my Excavator armor (no paint job available) and my Hotter Rod X-O1 in my inventory and easily tell them apart.
---
Also feel free to suggest names for what the group would be called. Merchant's Guild is kinda boring.
---
The one good thing to look forward to is once .. down the road .. all duping is taken care of and people don't have 50 million bobblehead and magazines to stack damage .. and if hopefully assassin weapons don't increase slap damage they won't eventually do much damage to you at all … however CAMP stuff is, unless this is changed, really weak, plus there is a perk to increase damage to CAMP items .. says workshops but it still applies.
---
So keep your chin up champ, in like 2-3 years, once the market clears of bobbleheads and magazines and damage stacking obtained illegitimately we'll be alllriiighhtttt
---
If ya don't mind a suggestion .... add what system you are on, might make peeps more amenable :)
---
Total click bait don't fall for it 
---
Pc seems to have way more problems than Xbox.  I crash once every 20 hours or so.
---
I want to put my balls in the pool table too. 
---
I run heavy Guns build or melee/unarmed build depending on my mood. Around lvl 240 atm on my main with no items or mods that i really miss. I do not farm XP anymore since it has no function. I do play alot with others but I do not need Melees/unarmed if i am Rolling heavy Guns for the Queen and the same goes for my mates. 
---
I play with a lot of different people with more or less maxed gear and builds and I do not see your point. Sure melee/unarmed is great when she is down on the ground but ranged is very handy overall and if you have ok end game gear and build you do great dmg. 
---
I do agree that some Queen runs can have a lot of players that seem to do close to zero dmg.
---
I only use explosive 50 cal MG on trash. For the Queen i use different versions of regular TS 50 cal and TS gatling gun with or without prime receiver.
---
And I do not want to discuss dupers with stacked bobbleheads and magazines, we all know they can one punch the planet with a crappy boxing glove 😁
---
No, I have it on Xbox two accounts and pc, it’s all totally separate
---
They should just take PvP out of the game or at least make a PvP server so they can have their fun 
---
Sound advice and exactly how I'm gonna do it. I just want a tich more dmg output so I'm gonna start exploring more outside my comfort zone. I just killed a bloated ghoul at the golf course for 104xp and it was only 5 headshots so I'm gonna throw on my PA and go back
---
From what I've heard the damage you get can get up to 60%, usually its between 40% and 60%  not sure how many addictions you need tho 
---
It works from ps4 to ps4, not sure about cross-platform though.
---
Okay. Thanks. 
---
those asaultors only lvl24 just few shot even with non legendary gaus..
---
Yo. Explain this to me, where is your proof, anybody can take their friends phone and make shit up, (there are literally fake text subreddit) it's still $50 at my local game stores in the states where game sales reflect market value (yes that's a bit of a lower price but that's because it got shoddy reviews by people who played for a day or never played), also, again, where is the proof? Give me a link, give me anything other than a random post. Yes it's most likely going to be part of the game pass bundle or whatever because it's a Bethesda game, hell fo5 will be and so will es6 or whatever new one they are releasing. You have no valid point and just like every other post like this you will wind up deleting it before the sun comes up because of the downvotes. Proof or it's bs. I'll call my local gamestop right now. One random screenshot doesn't mean anything. 
---
Yes. I ran the numbers manually with a friend. They all stack. My post is actually linked below.
---
I remember my duct tape tub in Boston fondly 
---
It’s rare that happens man. I’m level 150 and knock on wood, haven’t been killed by another player my whole time playing. Easiest thing to do is quickly log out and log back in, it’s a pain to do that, but it’s better than being griefed. 
---
That is good to know. Thanks. 
---
The problem is I had claimed several workshops, placed extractors and completed the Power Up events. Once I jump to another server, I lose all my progress.
---
In game yeah, but I'm talking more along the lines of lorewise.
---
i had 10+ donated to picnic box at watoga station.
---
Once you hit lvl 30 you will gain access to "tank killer" which is a huge boost for rifle users and a must have, so you'll probably come into your build a lot more by 34ish 
---
I agree completely with you. 
---
My vote is no, I played it in a decent gaming pc, yes it’s worse on Xbox one s but I really don’t recommend the x, there are some increases but they aren’t crazemazing
---
Not that I have noticed.
---
My melee party girl, who is obsessed with buying plans, is always drunk. Good for fighting monsters AND shopping.
---
I completely agree with you on the PvP, I was told (by Bethesda) to block them and fast travel or move to another sever. You can't fast travel with someone attacking you and it's a complete waste of time going to another sever. I end up attacking back so they can kill me with their stacked bobbleheads or magazines and then respawn somewhere else. It's a bit ridiculous that a low level can one hit someone 50+ levels higher using stacked mods and force them to another part of the map.  
---
It doesn't increase move speed when actually aiming, but just having the weapon out gives me a considerable boost in move speed. 
---
There's no proof, I doubt Bethesda will offer it f2p outside of game pass or something. Fo4 and eso are both f2p technically same with battlefield 1 and every other bgs game that has a contract with them. This post is a joke and the person will delete it. Idk if you have checked into the vault lately but they are definetly being alot more transparent. What I don't understand is this wouldn't be happening if it was another elder scrolls game with the same bugs. Its just "in" to hate the game right now. I'll say it again, there's no proof. 
---
I'm not sure how u can say it's a terrible argument, when u paid for and ran that game, u agreed to a set of conditions that you would abide by when playing the game, these are the terms of conditions, by using an exploit to dupe items, your friend broke these terms and it is in Bethesdas full rights to ban him, regardless of how easy they made it, heck a debug menu could exist with a button saying "dupe items" and if u were to find this and use it, u would be breaking  the same terms and up for a ban/suspension regardless if u paid for said game or not
---
So much for no griefing! 
---
Why else would they ask you to take a seat.
---
If I see a CAMP setup I try to visit, I’m usually carrying some lower level weapons or gear from scavenging, which is what I like to do. I don’t wear power armor much and run around without weapons drawn to help ease any concerns. I also have my mic on all the time and use friendly emotes as much as possible. 
---
Right now I’m trying to find a good high traffic area to build a CAMP so people can stop by and trade. I’ve built up a decent inventory of plans, mods, recipes, etc this point.
---
I had not engaged them and the damage they were doing to me was enough to require stimpacks. 
---
What Lake? ^(jk this is a great looking base)
---
Nope, it's free
---
I didn't know about this. I have carnivore, and all my other mutations are working fine.
---
What is the bug? Having carnivore basically suppresses all other mutations?
---
Not when I tried. I think the fire procs with damage, but who knows.
---
Launched a nuke twice solo.  Saw a couple of guys at a silo so I joined them and launched a third.  I like to find the most people and drop the nuke right on top of them.  Help them get that achievement.
---
I'm not sure if this method works. I found someone crouched not moving in a camp and was showing on the map.
---
Yeah that's perfect for me, thanks for that! I didn't pre plan my build at all , I just let my play style and the drop of the cards shape my load out. I'm all rifles vats gunsmith armorer cannibal. I only regret taking any in lockpick because I can't be bothered to swap it out all the time. 
---
 I would love to see a Legendary Severe Glowing Hermit Crab
---
lmao, fantastic.
---
Some people are dickheads, but trust me you'll meet way more nice people than you will these orcs
---
Make it where if we are in passive mode they can’t even see us and if they find our can’t and shoot it they get insta killed 
---
I lost my favourite gun to this at level 25 or so, was so bummed haha
---
That's find its okay if you waste perk cards, but you just want to not waste special points. 
---
I have all the same paintings after receiving Modern Paintings that I had before, no addtional animal paintings. I already got the animal paintings, like the bear for example, along with some portraits and landscapes when I acquired ‘Resort Paintings.’  Modern Paintings unlocked zero new items.
---
PvP itself is optional, yes.
---
Pacifist itself only changes the damage you do to other players/Camps to 0, others still can attack you or destroy your Camp although they receive a bounty for vandalism. As long as you don't fight back/engage in PvP, the damage you receive is reduced by 90% so if they attack you with a fully upgraded gun with perk enhancements (times 3 because gankers) it adds up to, and I'm quoting Phil Swift here, "a lot of damage".
---
Should you encounter people like that, block them via the Social tab or map, go back to the title screen and join another server, don't let griefers ruin your experience, mate.
---
If you have a full set of the same it should say excavator power armor or t50 power armor 
---
Rule #9
---
Dont forget building a twin bed out of a tin can and a cigarette.
---
Hardened mass no longer auto-scraps as of the last patch
---
I really wish it was useful. I thought I'd use it with my two shot explosive flamer with faster reload, but it doesn't even F****** SHOOT F******* FIRE!?!?
---
What happens if I use a crafting table while in sneak at my base? Is my position given away for that brief time? I actually don't know the answer to this and I tend to not bother hiding when I'm at my base anyways just curious
---
nerf  revolver!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is too op its bad for game economy... :D
---
The problem with hazmat suits is they break too quickly.
---
My brother is actually having this same exact issue right now
---
ik its rule #9
---
Wouldn't count on it.
---
It's even less useful as a secondary weapon. My Max modded one is over 30 pounds, and a pound of ammo is gone in under a second.
---
Add ChrisGetsMoneyy looking for people to chill with!
---
I don't think the first part is true? I was travelling back to my camp to get supplies and also in-between deaths, and my original card worked the entire time.
---
Nope, it's just there for show. Doesn't even have fake nuka colas in it. You can open and close the small glass thingy, that's it.
---
But if you are a nuka nut you must have it for decorations and role playing reasons.
---
Lmao yeah vault boy ripping the wings off the queen and attaching them to his PA. If you can't find a jetpack, simply take the enemies ability to fly and make it your own. 
---
Um, have you tried playing stealth? You dont need PA
---
14 dollars for that mess, too. Truly out of touch with reality.
---
I've also found that raiding the horn Wright mansion is a great way to farm lead. 
---
"That's totally barbaric!"
---
"That's wizard's chess."
---
Hornwright Test Site #3.
---
Spawn in and immediately look at the wall on the left. 3 Iron nodes, 2 broken (don't worry it gets better!)
---
Directly above those three on a ledge are 7 Iron nodes. Slightly higher 3 more. On the top 1 more. Drop down cliff-face from there. Face cliff and collect from 9 Lead nodes.
---
Head back to spawn point, walk forwards and slightly right, jump over (or walk around) fence. Head towards large red machine. One the way 1 iron node on left. Head downhill on right side of red machinery and follow path winding to the right, picking up 6 (maybe 7) iron nodes, last one is on side of burning mound.
---
Relog, repeat.
---
That place averages 2 iron to every 1 lead. Ideal for most ammo
---
He is talking about serums...as in the items you buy or make to get mutations...not the mutations themselves.  
---
Definitely classical
---
Good point..I mostly go to farm materials, XP, and lead, steel, acid, etc to make ammo.
---
Were they using melee weapons?
---
Did you claim a workshop?
---
Did you have any locked container in your CAMP?
---
I've noticed the same thing. I travel around in third person then switch to first when I'm in combat. 
---
95 foot tall glowing Sanjay with spiked ladle when you nuke Mama Dolces
---
Must be nice to be evenly matched in PVP. Every PVP encounter I've had has been some guy 2 times my level that levels me (and the workshop they usually take) with a few shots of a TSE. Man, I cant wait for this patch.
---
That would be a horrifying way to start a brand new online only game lol. You go through the clip and spend an extrene amount of unnecessary time working on an avatar, listen to the bots and finally get a chance to go outside. But you are welcomed with a hellish nightmare full of extreme radiation and high level enemies just to die till you server hop.
---
Gotcha
---
no becuase the gatling never will hit him. only from close range...
---
I was wondering why the robots stopped attacking me.Wow thats the best quest in the game.
---
I have two characters at a combined level 170 and never use power armor. I do nuke zones in a hazmat suit with just a shotgun and mm gauntlet and except for the Wueen, can easily do them myself without hiding. I have max or almost max Strength and Agility (Barbarian + Evasive give dmg resistance), Lone Wanderer (take 20% less dmg), and some in Ironclad. I use legendary metal armor pieces that give stuff like ‘take 15% less dmg from ghouls or robots’ or ‘more dmg resistance at low and high health’. 
---
*facepalm*
---
I thought I couldn’t do that because the armor level was too high. Gonna log in later tonight and check now.  
---
I miss filling my bed with skulls. No, there isn't a reason other than I started doing it in fo3 and it became tradition.
---
Also a shelf of pa helmets.
---
🔮🙌🔮
---
I rather see a hardcore server where you can not bring your characters, no fast traveling, and is permadeath but you can revive but it coasts more caps each time, and if you dont have the caps you have to restart. Would have to really think about it more but I would deff want new characters for everyone. Enemies can still be stronger as well.
---
Yes i know about the nerf, All im suggesting is that the current total amount of flooded tse weapons find a way to become trashed in a way that doesnt penalize legitimate non duping players who spent alot of caps on those guns already just so they could keep up with everyone else in game, alot of those players might have spent 2k-5k caps or more on their gear, now they will have to throw them away because bethesda waited so long making their gear absolutely worthless, that same gear will now sell at a fraction of the price leaving many players pissed for grinding away for hours to get them. yes it would appear that dupers would be rewarded but that is bethesdas issue to deal with them separately for exploiting and creating a major grievance for the players im concerned about.  Part of the bigger issue is the fact that we are shifting blame from bethesda solely to the dupers, greed is a common thing it might make us duplicate items or release games too early without actually taking into account repercussions that could occur from actions that led us to here now.  Hopefully whatever bethesda does will be in the best interest of the loyal player base who played solely for enjoyment and did not contribute to the shit storm that has ensued.  People will react regardless to whatever bethesda does.  
---
Wierd flex but ok
---
No. Server stability is OP. 
---
Yeah, deleted, I thought so. Anyway for those worried i just called the game stop 1888 number and they said that fo76 will be on store shelf for the foreseeable future and that if anything changes they will let the customers know first. (yknow so people can start calling bullshit on people like this for real) the person assisting me said he will be keeping an eye out for any news on this because he personally plays the game. 
---
Same here,  I'm missing something. 
---
The stats armor gives you is only for the PASSIVE stats. Strength for Carry Capacity and Melee damage, Perception for VATS accuracy, Endurance for HP and so on.
---
PvP is where the whales are
---
make that 10k now
---
Bethesda took the term "endgame" too literally and they think that is when the game ends and you stop playing.
---
I would love this.  We need a whole card management system though.  I am so sick of wading through all of them to get what I need for a specific situation.
---
 Yep, i was doing the one just behind, plenty of supermutants, i was down to the last couple. 
---
Xbone froze....

---
Looks great! I particularly like the architectural layout. 
---
My own tip would be to splurge and buy the succulents for 200 (I think?) Atoms. You get like nine different ones and having different house plants on surfaces makes such a difference, I think. 
---
No fun then. 
---
That's actually pretty funny.
---
btw a regular gaus make more damage than the two shot hunting rifle...
---
I'm Lv. 77 or 78 now and I'm completely viable against Scorchbeasts and pretty much anything *except* a Nuke Zone battle, due to the immense Rads.
---
That said, one thing I've noticed lately is that people will often nuke Fissure Site Prime in such a way that everyone can hang out at Drop Site V9 and shoot the Queen without being in the radiation zone.
---
I've basically set up (my numbers may be off by 1 or 2 here): STR 15 (Incisor, Martial Artist, and I'm gravitating into one-handed and unarmed now because of the Legendaries I've found - I was two-handed), PER 5 (Concentrated Fire for VATS and lockpicking), END 5 (Miscellaneous thirst and hunger), CHA 1 (Fast travel cost reduction and Hard Bargain), INT 10 (to max out Makeshift Warrior and Gunsmith, but also swap in Armorer, Fix It Good, and hacking as needed), Agility 10 (Marathoner, Action Girl, Enforcer, White Knight), Luck 9 (Bloody Mess, Starched Genes, Pharma Farma).
---
For the most part, my melee can kill things very quickly.  For anything tough, like a Deathclaw or a typical Scorchbeast, Enforcer will cripple the limbs in order to finish them off with melee.
---
The world is usually not pitch black at night.  Moon and whatnot.
---
I can confirm that Herbivore is working properly now, at least for me.  I bought three serums after getting my Herbivore mutation and they all stuck.
---
Don't bulk your junk.
---
By doing so I lost my X01 stealth boy mod and a T51 CS mod. Because they use mod before bulk material when craft or repair
---
So keeping them as is is a good way in current circumstances.
---
If I find a loophole to get more money back on my tax return I'm going to use it. Bethesda knew people would use it and did and they pretended it didnt exist for this long. Not that I read the terms of service as I'm sure NO ONE did, but I'm also pretty sure it didn't mention duplicating items found in game. It gave some broad and vague spectrum as to what is acceptable and ended with "we reserve the right to..." I dont understand how the blame is on anyone but them. I like the game, I play it as its intended to be played but also can see why people wanted to take advantage of a widely known exploit to reproduce the best/valuable items. 
---
I'm never standing at a train station bar like a schmuck again. 
---
Oh yeah, I remember the first time I used my first explosive weapon...
---
Like lighting a cigarette while fueling your car at a gas station.
---
Good times.
---
Not really sure what the best is. I liked FNV but honestly I liked 3 and 4 a lot too. 
---
r/FO76enclave
---
Or
---
r/FO76roleplay
---
Papa nailed it. I thought the character looked like Tommy wiseau.
---
I'm referring to end game. Like blasts zone.
---
People use to nuke morganstown too around launch. It seems like a solid area with all the ghouls north of VTU. Dunno why it's not being targeted anymore
---
Seriously, I would totally play for hours but after 15 min. and a disconnect, I just close application and move on to something else.
---
I liked that so much I downvoted my own comment
---
Nice. 
---
I have plans, you want?
---
Because there isn't a single problem. Bobble head and magazine stacking is a problem. Two shot and explosive stacking is a problem. The difference is that the bobble heads and magazines are a problem more or less limited to the dupers they're already dealing with while TSE weapons effect everyone that can get their hands on one. 
---
Anti Armor has *always* been the secret. My grail drop 3* AA handmade takes down scorchbeasts just as fast as my TSE, with the added bonus of actually being able to hit them in VATS
---
It have anything good?
---
Same boat. Gave up at 97. Build is mostly finalised and I was just picking up utility perks (Super Duper, Chemist etc), got myself a good Bloodied DCG, some decent Bolstering armour and got most of the mutations I want.  
---
Now I’m just waiting till... something — anything really — happens to progress the story or available content.
---
Thanks for the reply, I'll give it a shot without getting rid of it and hope for the best.
---
You saw him only level 15, but guy may has multiple tse shotguns in his inventory already. And maybe 50487383 bobbleheads
---
My permadeath character turned level 28 today, the only problem is I was shooting a mole rat and this guy apparently put his camp down on the side of the road and built a random set up stairs, I shot his stair unknowingly and now I have 20 caps on my head and I'm afraid the run might be over, gotta try to rush through tho but it's pretty tough cuz this is a no fast travel run as well.  
---
Hopefully I can talk people out of fighting me or just fight them and kill them, not wearing power armor this run either so if it is a high level player or anyone with a explosive weapon I'm as good as dead. 
---
I tried Nuking that part of the map. It’s a no go for some reason. 
---
I have both, the one x in my livingroom on a 4k and a one s on a 1080. I honestly see little difference in graphics or lag (to make the difference as big as possible I also have the one s on wifi and X wired)
---
Thank you :)
---
I agree, it can be a problem. I also hate that I can't just go out there in my sniper cowgirl outfit with her two shot Gatling gun...
---
Happened to me too yesterday.  Had to log out and back on to fix it.
---
Miner bosses sound awesome. A massive fire fight against the miners and then some badass massive Miner Boss comes out and then you know shit is going down. 
---
I found out look in the comments below
---
I feel like I'm judged whenever I pull out a shotgun...it's not two shot or explosive...it's just a fun weapon.
---
Maybe a glitch but it happened to me about a month ago. 
---
Fucking paper bags. You know the world has gone to shite when there are neatly folded sacks all over the place. 
---
Check The Rusty Pick in the Ash Heap. I've had luck finding some raider armor in the basement there, and it's not hard to clear the place to get to it. Additionally, there's a safe and a bunch of cans you can collect for lead. Sometimes a bobble head or some plans, too, if I recall.
---
I've logged out.  Doesn't fix it.
---
With a stealth build, wearing a hazmat suit is perfectly fine for armor because the whole idea is that you sneak shot every attack and kill them before they detect you, 2.5x damage bonus on all of your shots is a lot of extra damage
---
this post is so disconnected with reality that its practically a shitpost.
---
But...but a youtuber said it might happen!  They NEVER lie! :0
---
I'm pretty obsessed with CAMPing and this is the best one I've seen so far. Love the combination of brick with barn - fab idea. :)
---
So nicely decorated and laid out. It's really well done.
---
(Jealous of that working stove. I've been looking for that plan for about 40 levels now.)
---
honestly its not their fault u didnt read the terms, all games have terms, regardless of how broad, vague, or technical they are, it gives them complete rights to do what they want when it has determined u have breached them. If you do not accept that, uninstall the game, move on. 
---
This isnt about pointing blame at anyone, but u understanding that ur friend did wrong based on the terms set by the game (dont quote me on this but im 99% sure it has a clause about exploits, which duping is). and therefore Bethesda, as set out by the terms, are in their full rights to do what they want.
---
Using ur example of a loophole to get more money back from your tax, this is not even remotely the same. Expoiting (as it is against the terms) is more like lying on your tax return to get more money back, only to be found out and be audited.
---
Or call the main offices customer support and see what they say, it's the 1800 number and then press 2 to speak with someone. Quit your bullshit. 
---
Yes, just yes!
---
Just like salvaged assualtron head. Been around since beta, no doubt reported thousands of times, they still haven't fixed it.
---
It may have been a staple in the other games but this it the first time our stash has a cap limit.
---
Bang on! Thanks man
---
I think around that level I tried doing some events, and tried to make sure whenever I was going to be on that I'd start out by picking up a workshop. Even if you don't necessarily need what it's collecting, it'll give you a quest to capture it, then a quest two minutes later to defend it, and then about every 45-60 minutes after that another quest to protect it. In addition to all those enemy waves it spawns, it'll also give you some nice camp plans as rewards sometimes, as well as a nice chunk of XP.
---
There's a few loose groups of Traders already.  
---
Tuck the Black, HeroJoker, and myself network a lot with other traders.  Joker and myself have sort of consolidated with our Brotherhood of Steel group, and we act as quartermasters of a sort.  
---
Also I know Tuck is planning a sort of Traders Faire and looking for interested parties.  Maybe you might reach out if you find either idea up your alley?
---
This comunity sucks
---
Yaaas. Good point. 
---
May I ask if you have mutations? The electric and radiation mutations both damage the owner for a bit of damage when they trigger. Unfortunately this doesn't get reduced in pvp even if you arent fighting back. Generally you can kill a player crazy fast who has either of these mutations 
---
It just isn’t viable to launch a nuke on PS4. Last six times I’ve crashed twice in the silo and crashed four times in the nuke zone. Rejoined a server and someone else ended up launching a nuke. I crashed during the countdown. This is just straight up unplayable.
---
Yeah bud it is free but some people just want to buy it instead,  it is up to them what they want to spend their caps on. That's why I'm selling it for a very low price
---
That's a really good idea, but I would like it if other passive players can still see each other and interact. As others have mentioned there are some really nice people in the game.
---
Did you finish the sub-quest given to you? It involves getting a plan for... something (can't remember the name right now)
---
It's north from Top Of The World.
---
Completed. 
---
Saw 3 or 4 people show up.
---
Oh well, only 2 to 3 years. That's totally reasonable /s
---
I’m on Xbox and having similar issues every time I load in now. Freeze instantly. Have to dashboard. Still haven’t gotten it to load smoothly yet. 
---
Yeah I'm camped right near a couple and always take one first thing. I like it as a way to kinda stretch my legs.
---
I mean they could do a unlimited secondary stash that is not tracked by the server your on its only loaded through a secondary server and your client and then is simply put into your inventory. The easiest way to make sure that people dont get everything out at once would be to only allow you to take as much as you can cary at that time or only allow you to take 2x your max so you can have plenty for crafting ect. This would be extremely simple to implement minus the secondary server communicating with the primary one for transfer of items or however you handle that. This would prevent server lag and instability while giving us an unlimited stash.
---
Now this is not the way that you would want to go about a permanent fix but this would be a good bandaid for the issue untill you could optimize your code to allow for better entity tracking.
---
Yup, Vault boy, then his hand comes up to his face and shoes you away, with that classic "squeeksqueek" effect. 
---
A Traders Faire would be interesting, I’ll have to message him. Thanks for reaching out and telling me, otherwise I would’ve missed that entirely! :)
---
more like unuke bosses
---
there is no endgame. killing sbq is mostly waste of of amo. what can u do?
---
1. farm decent 3start armor-&gt; u never need them in power armor ur just unkillable in pve and the pvp is just broken and non revarding. and repairing non power armor is expensive becuase ballistic shit.
---
2. farm legendaries from 3star legendary bosses-&gt; ts and tse nerfed to ground the rest legendary perk just junk
---
3. u can farm underarmor plans
---
4. u can farm camp plans
---
5. u can farm jetpack calibrated shock plans with server hopping
---
or just quit gameing and make something usefull with ur life.
---
Or the option to rename stuff so we can differentiate them our self like in FO4.
---
You need the monocle for that outfit.
---
I have a legendary two-shot handmade but have never gotten the plans over either of my two characters, yet it’s still letting me unlock handmade mods when I scrap them?
---
Yes, please.
---
That's not possible. Currently TSE is 6x damage if you have the demolitions perk. Bloodied caps at a 40% damage increase. 40% does not beat 600%. You're full of shit
---
Go to a workbench. Weapons or chemistry to scrap all. 
---
If you're looking around an area that has a workshop that has already been claimed by another player (you can see this on your game map), don't take anything or pick any lock on anything in that general workshop area. If you do, you'll get a bounty and the game for some stupid reason won't warn you first. Once you have a bounty, you won't be able to check your game map to see where other players are and you might find yourself killed at any random moment and any junk you're carrying taken by the player who kills you. Of course once someone kills you, the bounty goes away.
---
lol and for them to let us known when it's not actually a new emote at all would be swell. Like seriously, who cares if I get a dif picture ... I just wanna dance.
---
Oh wow, your total shot in the dark assumption is totally correct!
---
THIS. \^\^\^\^\^
---
Well of course it's still locked that's why they blew it off the hinges. Fully immersive.
---
&gt; Why is bethesda nerfing explosive and two shot when the bobbleheads and magazines are the problem?
---
The nerf kills 2 birds with one stone
---
1) TSE gives a 200% damage bonus. Compare to executioners which gives +50% when the enemy is below 40% health. Or furious which gives +30% after a few hits. Or instigating which gives +100% if they're at full health. Perhaps if TSE was ultra rare this discrepency could be justified.  As many people have stated, TSE is incredibly rare to loot off a mob.  But dupers have made the weapon into a common item so +45% with added splash damage is a respectable bonus for a common item.
---
2) Incidentally, by nerfing TSE they are going to cripple the EBAY economy that has sprung up from duping. Dupers have been primarily duping and selling TSE.  This move also allows Bethesda to hurt ebay sellers without Bethesda having to confront Ebay about their intellectual property being sold on Ebay.
---
You need to put them in the chassis and let it auto recall
---
One of the best perks imo. Even when overcumbered you can still move at a brisk pace. If you are not you can run seemingly forever and cover twice as much ground.
---
Gamestop also has stock they need to unload. If the game were to go F2P, they sure as fuck aren't gonna tell people until it's time. 
---
For 3.5 hours this morning I had a blessed server. 9 different locations all spawning legendaries, 3 of them spawning 2 leggos. Plus a nuked whitespring. Found many 3 star awesome pieces before i crashed while playing the piano for the well tuned buff.
---
Got 2 different 3 star pieces with 15% reduced damage while standing still. Planned on spending all sunday in that server. Cannot wait to be able to rejoin server.
---
Or perhaps a fountain full of teddy bears.
---
I'll admit, I've never tried it, and never read it was patched, so I have no clue.
---
+karma
---
Try speaking ffs
---
For sure lol
---
There is soooo much BS on this sub...all the fake ban warnings trying to spread fear and now this. 
---
Slothzilla, a 3 times as big sloth. 
---
Yeah I know.
---
What bullshit? Numerous people have already done it, and all the stores are pulling their stock.
---
I'm sure it's nothing. Buy some more premium currency. 
---
I have an anti armor 50 cal with vats crit damage and less vats cost. I was thinking of trying it out. I think 3 perception for concentrated fire is more than enough for accuracy. 9 str for damage perks, 3 int stabilized, max agi and luck.
---
Still leaves 9 points to distribute, could use them for convienence perks like gunsmith I suppose.
---
Not sure what to do with all that agility since power armor + full auto weapon with no silencer means sneak attacks are out of the question. Action boy, adrenaline and gun fu still leaves 4 unused points. Maybe just take the action point hit and put them somewhere else, but eh. I think you may be right, it just doesnt seem efficient compared to a similar rifleman/commando build that can utilize sneak attacks easily.

^ Must be one of Caesars men...

Maybe because the only content is dupiing?
---
This worked for me as well. Thanks.
---
Nuking a vault to start a 1hr ish raid....
---
People only nuke whitesprngs because F questing.  Whiteprings nuked is 10-15 lvls in xp. And in a group easy 30 lvls. Join the club legendaries are only fun to hey at high lvl. 
---
Yeah I forget where exactly but it was in the southwest somewhere. At one of the dig sites near the giant excavator there is a small building with mole miners and it was just sitting on s shelf or something.
---
Yup I have one.  I wore it for quite a while with the grey knit cap, eyeglasses, veil of secrets, and prisoner collar.
---
Has this actually been proven? All i see are people claiming that her dr goes up but i havent seen anyone provide proof
---
I just laughed and moved on.
---
and yes I'm aware that TSE is 2 effects. I don't have numbers for the combined damage value of Explosive plus the primary effects I listed but I suspect they were worse than Two Shot 
---
or run behind cover and leave the server
---
They sell RL Bobbleheads? damn..where do you get them?
---
I guess but I really don't think that's happening. Bethesda has been doing nothing but being honest at this point and actually banning people who have been cheating. Call Walmart I guess? They don't give a shit. Also where I work if we are going to stop selling a product and if it's performing badly enough we just send it back for our price. Yeah we lose profit but other than that it's almost an immediate process. People aren't buying this product? Send it back. 
---
I hate the rain, and I hate the sleet, man I sure do hate the snow
---
My camp is right next to this place to the north. Just walk down the cliffs and you're there. It looks like my camps gonna be destroyed quite often now 
---
Nobody cares if you use a regular shotgun,
---
And nobody cares if it’s two-shot or not. 
---
It’s the explosive, coupling environmental
---
mess that affects those around you and, an unpleasant sound effect, and an already bad rap of the darling weapon type held by a much larger than intended cohort of players, who obtained access to it grats to (usually indirect) duping activities. 
---
You’re stepping on a lot of sores pulling that thing out. 
---
No intelligence does
---
What do you need so much bulk junk for though? Personally I only bulk items that reduce in weight when bulked( aluminum and lead) or stuff I'm about to sell to a vendor, otherwise you're just wasting plastic. For repairs or crafting you'll never need 10 bulk stacks either, unless you plan to craft and scrap stacks of weapons to unlock mods. I keep 5 different sets of power armor, 2 full sets of regular armor(weightless and assassin's) and about 10 different weapons, and still have spare space for whatever junk I need on hand. I wouldn't mind more stash space, but I think you stashing strategy needs a change more than the stash size itself
---
I’ve played solo for 140 levels perfectly fine. It’s not meant to be played strictly in groups some people just think it might be mote enjoyable that way.
---
Even console has fov option now 
---
“Gamerkid” “infanint” “im get” lol 
---
I just lost a freaking x-01 jet pack mod to this... 🤬
---
Bloodied explosive shotgun. I literally 1 shot them in the feet with a crit. Unyielding meta is gonna come in full swing.
---
Ohhh imma look for it! I pretty much just spawn at the Gorge then take Lakeside, Airport, Poseiden, and the landfill but 99% I get disconnected after taking the landfill right as I start heading back north to harvest
---
I mean, the stairs it should be the door to leads to a basement, but you can check. Its at the mothman museum at point pleasant 
---
I did this just the other week I. Fo4 and then threw a grenade in. Made it rain.
---
whats your name I added someone, not sure if its you.
---
you can also press SPACE on PC to pickup a deployed frame/suit
---
Refrigerator would be nice.
---
HAZMAT Suit over armor would be cool as well but the rad resist would have to be no more than 400 for balance.
---
Maybe off topic but I want a 45 cal. 1911 and some kind of .38 non pipe pistol for pistol only builds as well as a .44 cal. Lever action rifle. Would love a .50 cal. Desert Eagle but not sure how they would balance that with how  much .50 ammo you can make.
---
Ah interesting thanks for the info, does anything affect workshop XP?
---
Any tips for being stuck in areas with way over leveled enemies?
---
I think intelligence affects all xp
---
I get more wood from 4 pencils than a giant pile of logs I harvested the other day
---
I was wondering how tse is going to interact with the second bullet after this nerf. If explosive is supposed to do 20% then does it mean you get that 20% twice? Or will it only do 20% of the 25% the second bullet does?
---
I want private servers so I can co-op with friends like Borderlands.
---
They did say In the vault that they are going to finally start taking the people "using exploits and duping seriously" I forget the word for word but they did say they are going to start doing something about it and even asking people to start recording game play of people acting suspicious and sent it to the support team. They did mention filing a ticket but they now have a secondary link for stuff like that. There are alot of bs reports here as well, including but not limited to-people saying they are being banned for buying duped weapons, picking up duped weapons or items, and for no reason at all. I think it takes some effort on someone's part and then I'm sure Bethesda looks into it before acting rash. I agree with you 100%
---
Them guys weren’t wearing leather/combat armour huh, you don’t need grounded to shrug of energy damage with that armour. 
---
To be fair the minor miner boss is harder than the boss miner boss.
---
Just change servers. A high level person was there recently, so they’re high as well. If you change servers they’ll be your level 
---
He removed most of what he said already. 
---
you'd have to do a lot better than a crummy PA paint to get me to trade in my TSE.
---
Haven't bought any... I just called the main office. Your post is a sham. 
---
I’ll go do some test here in a bit and I’ll link you the results fair enough? 
---
Loot drops amount and conditions is Luck
---
mmhmm
---
that's really their problem. go blame Todd for making this mess always online.
---
in fact, now that they're nerfing my fun, I'll do everything in my power to make everyone's experience as crappy as possible.
---
Been on an 8 hour play marathon today on ps4 not one crash or disconnect.  Lagged a bit in moments but never lost connection

It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
I have carnivore and recently took marsupial serum and it worked fine. Make sure to take off starched genes
---
If you are 156 I don't think you can get a refund. Have you tried restarting your PC?
---
? You even asked us to before you removed it. I did. They called your bs. I'm. Not arguing with you over this. 
---
 **How do I scrap junk on Xbox One?**  START BY UNPLUGGING IT 
---
No the only thing affecting XP is buffs that state it.
---
Unlike previous fallouts, this one , doesn’t matter what level of intelligence you have it would be the same for special levels  1-15 
---
It does actually shorten your hitbox, not by much grunted but occasionally you can get through spaces that you couldn’t otherwise walk through. 
---
Same 
---
It's just frustrating that I lost my Workshop progress.
---
Beat me to it.
---
Either it’s a glitch or a coincidence. It’s probably a glitch 
---
Thanks for that. What exactly does the blocking a player do?
---
It sounds like Todd "It Just Works" Howard
---
Yeah, maybe then we could put those freaks back under the ground where they belong.
---
I removed nothing. I said call your local stores. 
---
Thanks for that. It was a frustrating experience.
---
Would love to see a details guide on finding this guy. Anyone find the witch by the lake yet? She is dead but has the witch costume plans in her pocket. Found her last night while out just exploring the map.
---
The typical “I’ll behave like an arsehole to everyone around me, and it’s THAT OTHER PERSON’s fault”. 
---
Right. 
---
Where?
---
Seems you arent understanding what I'm trying to say, apparently we just dont see it the same, which is fine. A loophole seems exactly the same, because that's what it was, a loophole in the game to extract more resources. It's not like a PC modder who goes in and changes coding (that I would equate to exploitation and lying on a tax return in my example) to get the desired effect. IF there is that clause then fine, no argument but if not then it's just a vague explanation of the terms they set forth and if it doesnt specifically mention it they are just arbitrarily banning because A. They just dont like it or B. They are pressed to respond to player complaints. Either way I'm not saying he should have done it, but I am saying they are acting innocent in the scenario when they should've handled it before it came to this. They have essentially ruined many aspects of the game by letting it continue, game economy is jacked and is too far gone to be repaired
---
All cool ideas, but naming attacks is kinda odd. 
---
You are awesome!
---
it's mostly thanks to reddit that TSEs are getting nerfed so there's that.
---
They used a Fatman to destroy my camp, then attacked me with PVP weapons. I had claimed a workshop and had a locked door, but no containers. 
---
Random drops.
---
Yeeeeeeeeees
---
Such inglish. 
---
It would have a massive mushroom that encompasses it’s back, and it would drop other megasloths from Its back. 5 to 10 times the size of a mega sloth. 
---
shaaaaaaame
---
this kid should go back to playing Call of Duty: Infanint Warfare
---
Intelligence doesnt affect xp in this game
---
Hold down the select button and move the right stick down. 
---
I have all 3 Xbox’s all over the house all connected different ways and locations.
---
Xbox one x is notable superior , on regular display ,4K or anything else.
---
Wired or wireless seem to work perfectly fine other then when there’s servers issues but those are notable since ( if in a team you hear your teammates cursing at the server lol )
---
Acceptable
---
I didn't have any mutations. 
---
If they tried to claim your workshop, it turns PvP (full damage) automatically.
---
Ehh, I am okay with the weird shit, just wish it cost about %25 less across the board. Especially with their love of short sales.
---
Dont bother eith the gatling plasma. Im a lvl 170 heavy gunner and the gatling plasma bolt's get stuck on your character's legs and reduce the damage output and the gstling plasma breaks after 2 clips.
---
🤔 also curious because please buff wazer wifles
---
Thanks man. It was quite fulfilling to say the least 
---
Legendaries, all of them, are guaranteed drops from killing rare legendary enemies. (Legendaries sometime have stars next to their name. This means you can get weapons with two or three legendary effects, coordinating with the amount of stars that it has.)
---
I was board and it helps to describe how each attack works.
---
I play on xbox I should be a little mad but this was golden lol
---
I find it weird that you have the same amount of downvotes on each comment as he has upvotes.
---
Looks like someone is jumping through accounts.
---
Don’t think it was me, I haven’t added you yet. My ign is ariyx. When’re you planning to launch the nuke?
---
Right now I'm experiencing a bug where whenever I log in, if I use my Pipboy I get soft locked and can't move. I can fast travel but still can't move. The only fix it to use a container then I can use my Pipboy without a softlock. Prevented me from doing scorch queen earlier. So frustrating. On ps4 btw. 
---
Those of us who use range but contribute get a really bad rep because of the leaches.  I know when I go after the queen I swap out my perks to do more damage and grab my best heavy weapons and have All Rise with me as a backup.  
---
I do everything I can to get her on the ground for the melee guys and, as I keep pacifist on, I try to watch their backs when the "smaller" creatures come out to play and mow down the small creatures while still trying to do damage to the queen.  I fully admit I don't have the best gear but I will be damned if I don't give 100% every time I join the fight. 
---
Yes
---
Yeah I give up on this stuff till they come out with a gift emote. I just dump the stuff in the trash can in flatwoods red rocket or sell it to the flatwoods vendor. Even the stubborn "I don't need hand outs" players like me are usually willing to take cool low level legendary stuff if they buy it from a vendor.
---
As a non melee build I’m disappointed w my anti-armor shishkebab so far. I need to find a good mod. 
---
How about nuking the Uncanny Caverns and have something super awesome come out that's fucing hard to kill!
---
Doesn't really sound like a glitch as that's just how the game is. It just takes one item to mess things up. Why did he have to rebuild it? At least now if your space is used by another player you can switch servers and everything goes back to normal. 
---
So you want them to do what exactly? Make you as strong as four people so you can feel good about yourself?
---
It's a Multiplayer game. You're playing solo. No shit you're at a disadvantage against a group of people. 
---
A logical well versed response... naturally you’ll be downvoted into oblivion but I’ll give ya a sympathetic thumbs up chap 
---
Cool! I’m always looking for teammates since most of my friends stopped playing :’( I’ll DM you
---
Well if you want to consider a loophole the same thing (i dont agree) however in that case loophole == exploit, and therefore breaks the below clause
---

Have an explosive shotty here , while not the best it was obtain by a 1 star enemy last week or more ago , 240 damage as my actual build.( could go to greater damage with the right tools )
---
Conservative , effective , and almost suicide proof.
---
It would also be cool to have preset classes for cards. So I could quickly swap between crafting mode and combat 
---
Like most of this. Honestly what we're lacking right now is half the map. The forest, ash heap and toxic waste dont spawn max level enemies, rendering half the map mostly useless for high level players. 
---
There is also a Clean Miner's Hat that goes with it
---
Cool! I’m always looking for teammates since most of my friends stopped playing :’(
---
No idea, just won't. either they over looked it or its intentional for some reason.
---
Or at least on the army ghouls that are clearly wearing Kevlar vests. 
---
I've had a ton of those, not a Pristine hat huh?
---
This is good... it's time to accept it. This isn't going to change anytime soon. we gotta accept that this just isn't a game worth playing long term... 
---
You’re not wrong though... well to be fair there’s still a *little* bit of water left lmao. And thanks! 
---
Totally agree I find it annoying to have to keep going back for more. Wasting caps or walking can be annoying. 
---
Please stop posting about it. Just downvote and move along.
---
More posts, especially title Gore like this one, only feeds the rumor.
---
Don't think so, just normal and clean, lol.
---
that was great
---
You are aware that magazines don't stack right? This does not work. It's been tested. It is not like the explosive bobblehead stacking.
---
Would up the number of accidentally-shot camp bounties
---
That only works in third person from what I've looked up. I should have clarified I only play first person.
---
I agree. Bethesda cannot go on a ban spree, they lose customers and present and future profit. It’s bad for business. The game is in an early beta phase and had oversights that Bethesda I’m sure is taking responsibility for. Like the ability to duplicate items using no 3rd party software. On the other hand, using a cheat engine to get into the dev room is a ban worthy offense as it manipulates the actual game software. If they banned everyone with a duplicated item, they would have banned 60-70% of their customers imo. Whether it is a duplicated purified water that a high level gifted a new player just outside the vault or a mass duplicated TSE Handmade, those items have made their way into a large percentage of inventories.
---
And a clean bucket if I recall . Makes quite the set. If only the bucket would double as melee.
---
Sorry, my bad.
---
Thank you! If I remember correctly I got the Cooking Stove plan from the Grafton train station? I’d try there. I server hopped maybe twice to get it in the bot’s inventory. 
---
You think a game issue is a "FML" moment? Oh, bless your heart you naive little idiot. Just wait until you grow up a bit and have real life problems. You'll wish it was only a game.
---
Aim low when they're on you to keep hitting
---
They will not be able to see your name on the map anymore, you'll be incognito the whole time (they still can join the same server as you and see your character but you're invisible in the map)
---
Yeah in the post Jurrassica is quoted saying something like, "just because it's inn the game doesn't mean you should exploit it. This is the literal reason we make players agree to a ToS"
---
I think it has to do with whether or not you have on the bomb collar. Had some vita try to nab me last night, and the warden mentions me wearing the prisoner collar. Pretty sure that was what he said, also had music going
---
Would love to see all of this or some versions of this in game! Good job
---
I agree they are pretty OP however I think they need to fucking fix the broken screeching of SBs before this nerf goes through because as of right now the only reason i dont mind SBs is because i can take them out in seconds with TSE. With my old weapons it could take minutes for a fucking lung and part of its wing to drop.
---
I don’t have any mods in storage either 
---
I'm curious with the current design where camp items are able to be destroyed, what happens when a PA or armor is displayed and gets destroyed? Would the armor also receive damage? 🤔
---
The easiest place I've seen to farm Legendaries is just by killing Ghouls around Whitesprings.
---
Now, bear in mind that you could get anything, so expect 9/10 things to be something along the lines of the exact same Leather Left Leg.
---
I'll try that! The spread is insane
---
One day we'll get raider armors from F3/NV. One day...
---
Don’t mean to bother you, but what’s Whitesprings?
---
After he mentioned intelligence affected XP and a quick Google I found that even though the game doesn't say anywhere, INT does affect XP.
---
Good eats if you’re coming down off a chem high and have the munchies 
---
You can but the timing is very tight. It is the same button for both. This is a common issue.
---
I have this strategy 
---
Equip power armor - intelligence changes from portable power to - power user remove the perk that removes armor weight , store armor in stash and change several cards around depending on situation ( explosives , aid , etc)
---
Never keep more then 60 of anything in junk tab.
---
Never more then 5 salt , spice or sugar.
---
Never use that ammo ? Dump in a lake 
---
Keep in mind that perk cards that help weight only help on yourself sometimes is better to carry all your heavy stuff with you , since if you die you’ll only loose your junk if you have any.
---
I don't know ow if its a machine pistol or a rifle. But grab the armor penetration perk for whatever effects it
---
We need to have a way to save a "profile" of perks. 3 setups would be great.
---
it was the mod. To install X-01 jet pack you need 5 pure cobalt flux and 5 violet flux with the regular junk. The flux may only harvested in fissure when nuked. It must be refined and converted or it vanishes away within 2 hours.

Same goes with high end weapons plans dropped from queen.
---
Grand. I scrapped it within this week, but guess the last patch really did. Nevermind, then.
---
What?
---
It's chill.
---
Is that your turrets shooting at my ghouls? Lol
---
Niggtron is my friend!
---
Neither, afaik you can only get an ultracite gatling laser from crafting and I believe the plan drops from scorchbeast queens. Legendary ones do not exist and putting a prime receiver gives you a prime gatling laser that uses ultracite ammo, while an ultracite gatling laser uses regular fusion cores. Make of that what you will
---
I just use a malee, it's cake.
---
Bad bait, either that or you're a literal infant
---
Ash heap- that grey area in the south is good for your level if you are looking to explore a new area. Events are a decent way to kill time and rack up some levels. Try to see how many workshops you can take over at any given time: XP for killing stuff to take it, XP for killing the stuff during the defend quest, bonus XP for successfully defending it. Can usually get 3 or 4 before the need to redefend- but don’t feel the need to actually go back.
---
I'm all for this resolution to the Stash issue.
---
Got an infinite loading screen once, quit the game, restarted it, never happened again, why does one loading screen mean the game never be played again?  Then again, judging by you're spelling you're not too intelligent. 
---
Fair enough. However in that description almost every player is then guilty and subject to banishment. As almost everyone is aware of the bug and I'm certain most didnt report it. Many have traded or were given a duped item and would be part of the "encouragement" part described or "distribution of virtual items." Again I'm not arguing against you, I'm only trying to make the point Bethesda isn't innocent here and is now playing judge, jury, and executioner. Fix the problem when it became known and it wouldn't be at this point
---
Totally seen it and took pics, I'll post 'em in a minute. 
---
I have played all the way day 1 of the beta, and I think I have 1(?) 3-star.  And it's level 35.  I'm just holding onto it until I find someone cool to give it to.  For now it's just encumbrance.
---
I disagree with your identical silos being lazy thought.  That would be more of a realistic thing. As they would have been built that way. 
---
But I agree the quests could be a little different for each one.
---
Took a level 4 today and we went to Camden (he hit all enemies once with pipe pistol and I finished them), the hunters Schack , Morgantown , that robot dye factory place , and then finally at his level 15 somebody had nuked Whitespring and he “dipped” his toes on some rad and I lured some glowing zeds to him a legendary with lots of booze and stimpacks he should be able to hold ( quack surgeon all the way lol ) just make sure he doesn’t have junk on him makes it easier in case he dies.
---
For steel, a good advice is to server hop at the whitespring golf club, get the can chimes at the side door, each chime has around 9 cans, each can is 2 steel.
---
for lead, server hop at the charlston fire department(firebreather base). go in to their gym and take the weights in there. you can break it down to lead scrap at the workbenches in the same building.
---
I always have 10 tons of steel in stash. Both my friend I have had our mods disapear and for last 4 days our food also..lol but not funny!
---
For some reason, the assaultrons in West Virginia can fire Laser after Laser without needing to recharge. Annoying asf, and it drains stimpacks 
---
Firebreather station for lead
---
Pause game , display , fov slider should show in one of those 
---
Pump deals more damage per shell. Efficiency weapons are good for adventuring while you save up junk and other resources.
---
Doesn't add up... I am below 500 with that much scrap. Did you try taking all your stuff from your stash to see if it goes to zero?  Do you have a pile of missiles, 2mmEC, mini nukes, or gunpowder? Those are the usual culprits for mystery weight. Also if you have weight loss perks they don't apply to the stash, so if you have perks that drop ammo weight to zero for some calibers then make sure you have all that ammo on you if you're using those perks. Same goes for food and explosives weight perks.
---
And 2 shot? 
---
Tell me.. what's a good legendary effect for pistols.
---
Yes. Yes. Yes. 
---
As far as 2 shot goes I hope they at least remove the accuracy/spread hit that the effect has on the 2S weapons.
---
Do you keep gaining cards past level 50?
---
It actually needs it? I thought it was just a typo in the crafting menu. Oh boy....
---
it is a dead meme though, it was from like 3 months ago
---
I have played on both PC and Xbox One X, but I have  decided to stay on Xbox strictly because In my case the players on console are way nicer in general and not in to PvP. And I hate the PvP aspect of the game at least as it it right now. 
---
Just had that problem earlier today, death claw got me too.  :/ all I did was exit then get back in and it was fixed. 
---
Yeah the shills and fanboys sure like to bully and force any differing opinions out with their downvoting. Not saying this OP is credible in any way, but you see this trend everywhere on this subreddit, and many others. It's no secret PR companies and others use fake reddit accounts to control the narrative. There was even an exposé on it.
---
[Reddit For Sale.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SAkUs3urrg)
---
But if they think they can get away with that, then I have news for them. Anyone can do it. And the more people that are made aware of it the more will take advantage of it. So they better be real careful about their bullying tactics, or like some bullies learned the hard way, they might themselves get a bloody nose.
---
Just use the map menu to send invites. 
---
So if Intelligence does nothing but let you choose higher intelligence  perks..what does intelligence- boosting chems do for you?  
---
I nuked the converted munitions factory today in an act of revenge. A couple dudes stole it from me, so I nuked that shit so no one could use it 
---
I got the silo stuff down to a science so it only takes me about 15 minutes from start to finish to get a nuke in the air.
---
The funny thing is, I was about to log off when they stole it from me, but they were kind of jackasses about it after, hence the nuke.
---
Felt pretty good.

Honestly I just make a small shack and expand slowly into a home

theres a fedora too iirc, would be good fort he second thing

It's not a true story.. that's how.
---
Weird kids like to role play and write lame stories on Reddit for attention.
---
Very little ammo. Only 10mm and .44 and shotgun shells but not rarely any of that in storage. I have about 500 gunpowder. 
---
20+ bunker runs with no dead friendlies
---
They are in fo4, should be pretty easy to add in there, yeah?
---
Dropped by Poseidon today to drop off a half suit of L15 Raider Power Armor for a L17.  He was not at the workshop, not sure if hiding or just busy, I think he was inside the plant.
---
lol too bad explosive is about to get nerfed :P
---
I believe you could also fast travel if you maxed Strongback in FO4.. It's been awhile since I played though could be wrong. 🤗
---
Thats why im concerned about ES6. 
---
How am I a hypocrite?
---
You see, people do this thing.... You get older, and you become different. Your moral compass evolves. You learn from past experiences. Your opinions change.
---
Just because I did something a decade ago doesn't mean I have to still think it's okay. Or sympathize/empathize with those doing it now. 
---
I was also a Presbyterian then. Does that mean I'm disqualified to be an atheist now? 
---
Blizzard could have and should have banned me if they had ever caught me. 16 year old me would have been pissy about it. Present me knows I would have deserved it. I don't do it now. I don't think it's right. 
---
You see a hypocrite claims to hold an opinion or belief, when they do not. When their actions contradict those opinions or beliefs. 
---
Mistakes/behavior from the past, that you no longer partake in? That does not forever contradict your future beliefs, opinions or moral compass.
---
We all liked as children, does that make some 34 year old mom telling her kids that honesty is important, a hypocrite? Because she liked as a child? 
---
When someone says they value fair play, are they a hypocrite because they cheated on a spelling test in grade 3?
---
I think you misunderstand the basic criteria for not being a hypocrite. Never making a bad choice/mistake is not one of them. 
---
It's not a massive help but if you put an Atom store paint job on an armour it has the Atom store logo next to the chassis, i put the Vault Tec paint on my X-01 and can now tell that one apart from my other 4 chassis.

Because players don't understand the cause only the effect. 
---
their store

MUMMMA
---
It's twisty the clown 🤡
---
As someone who hasn't launched a nuke yet, I'm curious do the other fissure sites not offer anything decent?
---
If they ever do add any extra mutated bosses to nukes site I hope its something like super behemoths, mirelurk queens, snallygasters, and grafton monsters.
---
Not 100% related but I’m
---
Hoping to find voice acting credits. Like for colonel in flatwoods, the super duper mart / watoga girl (I have a crush)... just a general credits list. 
---
did you test it? is it true?
---
GIANT.. FUCKING.. CAVE CRICKETS!!!! 
---
Ahh perfect for the munitions factory
---
"I am the Underminer! I have always been beneath you, but nothing is beneath me!" 
---
Yes, the game is not near as bad as people say. It looks bad on the surface because people only talk about or post about the bad instances no the other 90% of their play time. I’ve been playing since the BETA haven’t encountered a glitch that was more than slightly annoying like graphical errors. See you out there. I’m on pc
---
Im optimistic at this point.
---
Sounds like a conversation a heard on some guys , come to look you see a level 4 telling another high level guy to build him some power armor station and stuff.
---
Later I found out the lower level was a duper/cheater and was making the other guy pretty much his bitch for weapons lol 
---
I tried moving my camp multiple times today and was getting constant server disconnects. There's clearly a camp placement bug going on. I filled out a ticket with Bethesda, but no response yet.
---
Yeah, I wait till my camp loads in before I try to access my Pip-Boy to avoid this.  Been happening since the last update 
---
Sixteen tons, what do ya get?
---
The consensus is either Nothing, or affects crafted and
---
Scrapped
---
Yeah, but if there is high level power armor on it, you cannot pick it up.
---
Hi get a refund I’m Menacing
---
This made me laugh way too hard.
---
Balance it by magazine type I suppose? Have a .50 Cal (Large) for the Machine Gun and .50 Cal (Small) for the Deagle?
---
Yeah I agree with the Hazmat suit dropping down to maybe 400 or 500 Rad Resist would make it more balanced.
---
I need more serious PA paints.
---
I'll pay for:
---
* Olive Drab
---
* Flat Dark Earth
---
* Urban Camo
---
* Blue Camo
---
* Dark Red
---
I want to see more Faction-specific paints in game (like the BoS stuff that's already in). To be clear: the faction stuff should not be from the atom store at all. It should be unlocked via quests/events.
---
Molotov cocktails from far , do as little and spread damage and , you get an executioner.
---
( medic , support , executioner, EXPLOSOOOSIVEEE)
---
Stop bulking, its heavier than scrap. Don't store any flux that isn't pure.
---
Thanks for being one of the few smart people on here.
---
The bobble head stacking problem is an indirect result of duping. If you are banned then you can’t stack the 500 bobblehead damage. 
---
That is how it is being addressed
---
Hell ya, I think they will do something eventually. As of now I think they're is minimal content for solo duo style play which may change in time. I guess we gotta wait lol
---
get one from a duper while you still can
---
I’m new to the flux game. I’ve got some stable flux in storage. Is that how I want it stored?
---
I had this happen way too many times in a row, it was hilarious. My level 48 did the quest and had level 23 enemies. 
---
Honestly I think the reason Whitespring is so good is the combination of lots of enemies respawning fairly rapidly and a wide variety and amount of flora. You can get a large number of different colored fluxes there, along with the stuff to make them stable, plus tons of enemies and legendaries. 
---
This is what makes it such a valuable site to Nuke, and if more areas had the same or similar levels of flora and enemy spawns it would greatly encourage a wider variety of Nuke Zones. Especially since just launching a Nuke is kind of a time consuming process, so you don't want to drop it just anywhere and feel like you wasted it. 
---
It even weakens the weapon if you have armor!
---
You could be over encumbered and the diseases look like they came from being attacked by ferals and/or something from the Mire. 
---
Maybe they don’t actually read and just skim.
---
Or accidentally loot his body...

I have a video of this happening.  It was kinda neat to be half outside the matrix, looking in.

Yeah you actually did it, and here you are ranting at people who didn't even do it. As if you have some kind of moral high ground. You're a complete idiot, and your post history here proves it. You were made to feel so small and insignificant you started making up more elaborate job titles for yourself. You're the ToS question answering support installing and maintaining fiber optics. Right then. People like you talk so much shit online, and make up so much shit to try and validate their opinion, they can't even keep their stories straight or coherent.

Have around 10 tses and never duped. Traded and bought them all. Even the ammo. These are the best and funniest weapons IMO.
---
I never used Reddit before and jumped right into the trade marked. After several bought tses I then found out duping existed. 
---
From my point of view you are the bitch. More on instead of ruining your life with revenge.
---
A person with 1000000000 of the same or 20000 of the same weapon is a the problem.

Not the guy with a few rarities in his collection all gotten the Grindy way.

Offer to trade be friendly :) and sell me all your Mr. fuzzy tokens 1 cap per token lol

Was nuked in a game I was in a couple days ago. It wasn't all that, but wasn't terrible. Great place to farm cobalt flux. Would be an awesome place if it had more spawns and a boss. Yes, I think that would be awesome!

This is where I miss renaming my armor, just for inventory management

Yeah I use Commando and I Have TanKiller maxed. I'm just wondering if i can get that 24 fire damage higher
---
Oh no doubt about it. I just honestly wanted proof and as far as the bullying with downvotes I've definetly noticed it as well. Honestly if they just left the post alone and downvoted the negative stuff the Ops say then it would show alot more of what's going on. People check comments for the posters feedback on the subject at hand.
---
Oh yeah. Definetly saw the reddit for sale thing before. Shits crazy. 
---
That's kinda on you for not seeing this coming. 
---
The best place for lead is Lucky Hole Mine. It's on the southern side of the map, not far from the asylum. In extractor armor, you get 4 lead everytime you extract from a lead node. I walk out of there with about 200 lead ore every time, and you can server hop and do it over and over. Each 200 ore turns into 500 scrap, and if you have super super you'll probably end up with about 700 lead scrap each time. Screws are easy to find in any office setting having typewriters and fans. The DMV/courthouse in Charleston, VTU, and in Bogtown there's a tall office building with lots of typewriters and fans on desks. Gears, fusion cells, power armor/fusion cores,and lead, aluminum, and steal can all be farmed pretty easily at Watoga. Lots of robots that respawn quickly there.
---
I dropped a 3* mole miner faster swing speed etc. And then someone told me it was a God roll. Only decent thing I've gotten from her apparently other than a ts non explosive lmg I gave to a low level that was helping me run whitesprings once. 
---
Also seems to increase distance the higher your camp is located.  Have noticed much less use out of it from lowlands but get high up enough and the range is anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 better

I got one a day or two ago, I don’t remember the exact location, but I was doing the Rose quest where you kill the Yao Guai, I think it was in a big “national park” type of area.

Oh, I'm sure you could come up with a system you'd find more suitable to your needs or tastes. Point is, there are many ways of writing the armor name and the most natural one, the one that Bethesda tries to use, is about the least friendly to perusing in a long list sorted alphabetically.
---
It's almost like they should have more than one name. One name for display as a natural description in the local language, one that's better for using in sorted lists, and maybe some optional ones that prioritize body part, armor type, legendary effect, etc.
---
I have screenshots from friends
---
Lucky. My last Queen run was friday in which I got 14 shotgun shells and a screwdriver. 
---
Additionally, make half height stairs. And change the build volume from a sphere to a column of infinite height
---
I saw it was a typo, it says it takes 44 but it actually takes 45. 
---
Watoga vendors and sometimes harpers ferry.
---
There are two underarmors listed with Atom Shop prefixes (ATX) on their editor IDs but I've never seen them in the Atom Shop or game: Grafton Track Suit and VTU Track Suit.
---
gunpowder is .05 per unit so that's 25 pounds of gunpowder. I try to use the gunpowder up asap because there's no perk card that lower it's weight AFAIK.
---
Each area of the map should have a place to nuke, with Whitesprings being the 'neutral' nuke zone--a great place for varied high level enemies and good flux farming. Each should have a major boss and lots of spawns. That right there my friends, would be awesome.
---
Once those vaults open up, they would be prime targets for 'dungeon raids,' with a mini boss. 'Mini' makes it sound bad, but they should contain a significant boss, not on the extreme level of a nuke zone, but significant. Maybe great places to farm 3\* legendaries, while the nuke zones offer more.
---
I joined the super mutant horde event in ash heap for the first time. 
---
I thought the scorch beast that was attacking the super mutants was the boss. 
---
So I ignored the super mutants and focused on the scorch beast. Eventually, the SB killed the actual super mutant boss, ending the event. 
---
Since I never shot a single super mutant, i didn’t get any credit for the event. 
---
I did finish off the SB so I got an enclave commendation thing though. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
This, I got both mine from Phoenix
---
What bothers me most is there can be no diversity of thought. You have to be 100% positive, or 1200% negative, depending on where you are, or your posts get downvoted. I know I'm hard on the game sometimes. And sometimes some people just rub me up the wrong way and set me off. And downvotes shouldn't bother me, or anyone, but it does bother people. It's toxic. All of this social media BS with upvotes and downvotes. And people just waiting for that little kick of dopamine when someone replies or they get a few upvotes. Peoples opinions being molded by how many upvotes or downvotes they get. People trying to control what people think and say. It really annoys me, and the worst part is when it's being manipulated by companies, agencies, or even individuals with an agenda, and it's not even real. People fight fire with fire and I get that. If everyone in the game is using duped TSE and you're the only person who doesn't have one and you're getting killed repeatedly by them are you going to buy a duped TSE? If everyone is doing something that puts you at a disadvantage, are you going to respond by doing the same thing? It's these vicious cycles. I really hate social media. I analyze it, what it does to people, what it does to me, and I hate it.
---
The fewer the people the better. Unfortunately when that siren sounds and the red circle is over Fissure Prime, everyone comes runnin.
---
Im level 382. Ive launched 3 nukes this month. Morgantown, Monongah and Lewisburg. Each of them mostly spawned ghouls and scorched. All of them are good nuke spots, if my only interest was quantity over quality. On two of those occasions I was the only person on the server. 
---
Just isn't really worth it to drop nukes, I'd prefer to farm locations. Having to use power armor has a bit to do with it. Ive got at least 80 queen kills and only have 1 serum recipe from her. 
---
Thanks dude I appreciate that. 
---
From level 51 on, you can either take another perk card, or move 1 SPECIAL point to a different stat.
---
I just want to ability to put the heads of my kills on spikes outside my settlement.
---
How about a Zohan invasion? You don't wanna mess with them
---
What makes you think that they haven't ALREADY invaded?...
---
Your acting like Bethesda has some kind of vendetta against the players or something, the clause is a standard clause in just about any online game.
---
 "just because it's inn the game doesn't mean you should exploit it. This is the literal reason we make players agree to a ToS" 
---
I think says it perfectly, at this point, you are arguing for the sake of arguing, it is very clear that duping is exploiting, everyone knows this, and if u exploit in any online game and are caught, ur banned, simple.
---
Have never gotten death claws for this event. at least 2 dozen times.
---
1:) PS4 Pro - RDR2 Edition(Newest model PS4 Pro)
---
2:) JudgeGray
---
3:) Unable to capture video of issue
---
4:) Blue Screened followed by locked up system. I can play on the same server for hours. I can go into a Prime Fissure nuked 3 times back to back, however every single time I go into a White Springs nuke zone I get Blue Screened. My system will not recover from this issue and I have to reset my system every time. 
---
\*Note\*- I was asked if it was my internet several times. I have a fiber connection with 250/250 speeds. I dont know if its something to do with the PS4 Pro specifically but its starting to get annoying.
---
Only have seen the dead one in the dumpster haha 
---
Ahh. I was wondering that implied there was something I didn't know about that makes rifles suck or something. 
---
 `In cases where you are contacted, there will be leniency towards folks that cease participation in these activities. There will be greater consequences – including permanent bans from the game – for players that continue take advantage of these exploits.` 
---
I wonder if that means they are giving them warnings manually or if the post itself was considered the warning.
---
Are you on xb1?  I’ve got two extra shocks I think. 
---
If you can wait for me to go out, buy an Xbox, level up a bit, and get a decent weapon, then I'll help. &lt;3
---
Nah PS4, thanks though!
---
A
---
I fell victim to this last night. I spawned in at my camp, up near the WV Lumber Mill, and that area was nuked. Without my PA or hazmat suit I died instantly. 
---
I’m not saying this is bad, just makes me paranoid to leave the game without one or the other on. 
---
Now somebody is downvoting your post. It went to 0 I put it to +1 and now it's at -2. They also play reverse psychology mind games. Bunch of assholes.
---
Her armor scales with the amount of players nearby 
---
World full :(
---
Sludge Lung reduces your AP. It might the reason why you can’t run or use VATS.
---
For what it's worth, there is also a (separate) prime receiver for the ultracite gatling laser. I assume that one uses the ultracite fusion cores too.
---
Did your autocorrect switch shot to shit? Lol you must type a lot of curse words. Upvoting for two shit nerf
---
Lol 
---
My end game is to help many low levels till i die
---
Helping people, Showing first time nukers what to do, ^^^erp, exploring, looking for neat weapons, and building neat things.
---
I'm really enjoying the need of ballistic fiber to repair items that didn't use it for crafting said item in the first place.
---
I made a raider camp.
---
You are the definition of a keyboard hero you fat bitch 
---
its such a cool weapon tho. too bad it breaks easily
---
That's what I was thinking, I don't use PA at all. If I could trade for another rifle of equal value that I want I *might* consider it. 
---
I want to do it in the next day or two
---
Level 170, around 300 hours.
---
And the only thing left for me to do is farm for rare outfits and building the C.A.M.P.
---
Waiting for new content :(
---
It's the lawn gnomes you should worry about...
---
How many items have you sold on your eBay store?
---
Been playing since the beta. Not even close to the end game yet. Been enjoying exploring too much. 
---
Yeah stable/pure are the same things. You are good.  Just don't keep raw. Use what you can at the chemistry station and sell the rest. Raw Flux eventually becomes inert flux, and it is heavy.
---
I suspect something along those lines is planned at some point, because in the files, there are alien NPCs (enemies) and more than just one like F4, but different ranked ones, like how other enemies are ranked by their level. Now this again could just be CUT content, but they are not prepended with CUT, so i'll leave it up to you, but my opinion is, something is planned.
---
from my point of view, you would run from a real human as opposed to talk shit, you bitch fuck 
---
I doubt it will happen because the world wasn't tested with that in mind. You would suddenly have players getting stuck in all kinds of things or getting into places they shouldn't be.
---
Fallout 4s system was massively limited and easily the worst compared to 3 and New Vegas. 
---
Yeah lawn gnomes are kinda creepy in this game
---
They nerf TSE because people that did not get them are whining.
---
Anti-armor for melee
---
Nuking Charleston spawns a glowing blue 50 foot Deathclaw with glowing yellow eyes named Vaultzilla.
---
Nocturnal, since its worse than useless
---
If something like that will be, it's gonna come with alien DLC.
---
Was walking around flatwoods and I heard a guy coughing his lungs out. Emersive.
---
Tfw I forgot to specify for armor, oh well. 
---
Nocturnal.

Area damage will still be very useful for tagging
---
Yours is at - 3 if I put it at - 2 our math adds up once again. I'm not sure about you but I'm going to bet that if I check my old posts they will have been reduced by roughly -3. Well he has to do something with his free time I guess. 
---
You notice supply crates have their own different loot for each player.... 
---
That's what they do. Just not thru a fast travel.
---
Scorched Killer 
---
Depending on mouse and software, you may be able to disable it that way. 
---
Water ninjas bro...
---
Auto Stim has to one of my least favorite 
---
Nope not even using PA!
---
Isn't the Super Sledge louder though and maybe even less sneaky though ??  Granted if your rolling the right build your probably not sneaking but rather jingling the hanging cans like a dinner bell LOL
---
I wait for new content while playing other games.
---
Those 5 people must be very very low level because... The assaultron lasers isn't really that strong anymore, especially to players that are suppose to be there... So all of those deaths on are on their heads, not yours. They went somewhere that they shouldn't have at their low level.
---
&gt; No way, you are telling me people will cheat to get BiS gear instead of actually doing work to get it? 
---
You make it sound as if getting the best gear is a reward for hard work.  That's laughable.  
---
A guy I played with got a level 50 two-shot gatling gun on his second time farming white springs and killing a dozen or so ghouls. 
---
I've farmed white springs 20 times or more for hours on end, killed ghouls by the hundreds and farmed every location/ event  where legendaries spawn countless times and never once gotten that weapon. 
---
To say high-level legendary gear is simply a reward for putting in work is just laughable. 
---
I have the latest drivers installed too :(
---
My luck would be after an extensive search of the vault and an even longer time creating my character, the game crashes from the nuke as you're leaving and your character doesn't get saved! 
---
Yeah but why be a water Ninja when I could be an aqua boy which gives me rad and disease resistant as well?
---
Another day older and deeper in debt
---
Lol I wasnt serious, yeah it sucks bad 
---
You cant drop or trade Items painted with atomic shop paint
---
Nuka cola cap wars..like tiddly winks
---
I’ve always thought the Mayor of Grafton sounds a little like Nathan Fillion.
---
That would be awesome, tournament style cross server unique rewards
---
trophy hunting just need to pvp 20 players( hate pvp) and revive 20 players,that and just build on camp and just started server hopping for hunters longcoat outfit
---
You know I've never understand this, we have nocturnal. Why don't we have like solar powered or some shit that works during the day?
---
C'mon Bethesda you slacking boys
---
Really? The only atom store paint I have is the tricentenial so I never noticed. Thanks for the heads up! Kinda sucks.
---
At lvl250 on my main im not feeling it. I have a alt melee im working on though since range is getting nerfed.
---
Updated eta? Already been double your original lol
---
Junkies
---
And today babeh.
---
Sorry punching in code rn, game froze earlier
---
There will be...it's all
---
 coming
---
Deathclaw Island- A baby deathclaw unbeknowingly surrounded by a dozen legendary chameleon deathclaws.
---
Mongrel dog races?
---
Ow. That hurts to read. 
---
Probably Junkies or Assassins 
---
I kinda figured and yeah I'd say so.
---
What's even more sucky is when you get a nice peice of armor but an effect doesn't work thanks to another.
---
Like I'm pretty sure rad resist is broken with any of the ones that increase damage. Like mutants, Vanguard, bolstering and nocturnal
---
Silly isn't so bad...
---
Damn I want to get 2 copies of this game for my wife and I to play together.
---
But I don't want it to be like. Terrible. I wanna have fun. How's the current state of the game for casual coop between two people? 
---
Or eat him
---
We also need this as an icon
---
Yeah it says if dropped out will destroy it and you dont have an option to sell it to another player
---
I am lvl 118 and 300 plus hours I rp now as one of the wastes most prolific serial killers..up to 13 kills with my current base

Seven upvotes in 2 minutes?  Why do you maintain that many alt accounts?
---
Ive only been holding 10 max bulk of adhesive and gears and around 6 of everything thing else. I go thru aluminum, steel, lead and plastic too quickly to keep much more than 2 or 3 bulk of each of those around however. I also only keep one power armor set. That alows me more weapons and armor in my stash and i also keep some aid as well
---
I wasnt aware of rad res being broken. I have a vanguard with rad res and it appears to work as intended? 
---

---
No. It would be mainly used for griefing.
---
I have a sniper also and you have my kind of luck.  Tonight I finally got a piece of 3 star armor that I thought was something a little special, but it still isn't top-tier.
---
Yup. The turrets are largely useless anyways.

Intelligence effects XP game and durability and condition of items crafted

I was on the other end of this kind of encounter on my first trip to Watoga Station on my second character. Only I was the only person there before someone lured an assaultron there. It was too busy with the other player, so I snuck out, leaving the other player to die.
---
What are you looking to pay for a pair of shocks?
---
Items dropped in group events is also affected by charisma
---
not on my end, I crafted some ultracite .45, tried to load, still nothing.
---
I too live in 2013

No, because I can still do that in the games I could do that in.

Also a 15ft tall Yao Guai, with big glowing mane of rank fur, and massive deathclaw-like paws, and it roars like a Wendigo!!
---
Pants = shat!
---
Why did you use your real name? 
---
There should be Decks!!!
---
We get 5 or 6 decks.  Each deck of Cards is saved and we can name the decks. Each deck of cards automatically changes all perks currently active and which perks we can see on screen.
---
You can have a Crafting deck, a Sniper Deck, 10mm deck, LP/Hack Deck, etc.
---
Select a deck and press Edit.  Each deck will be a Character build you customise. So a deck would start with all cards and you place the cards you want active in your build and any cards you do not want to see you discard them, when happy you name the Deck and press Save".
---
There will however also be a Master Deck that has all you perk cards for reference that can not be altered.
---
Now these Decks should be able to be placed in a quick slot or keybind for easy switching.
---
Perks like LP, hacking, merchant ?? And travel agent should simply be made into 100% active not requiring cards to used.

It’s my street name, keeping up with the cred.

Pickaxe Pilsner Pong
---
Really? That sucks then! 
---
They are provided by the workshop until the structure goes from a white outline to a green one. 
---
Seriously. I've started switching to first person just to pick up items when i need to. I have to aim like 8 in-game inches away from a thing to pick it up in third person sometimes. 
---
You're lucky then. I switched servers and restarted the game and it still didn't fix it. The bug is still affects me right when I open the game. I found I need to open a container before opening my Pipboy otherwise it soft locks me. 
---
So much is provided then you begin using yours
---
idk about pvp but gambling would be sick. Have a town with a roulette wheel and other stuff you could try your luck with.

Backing out of the "Pick a Perk" or " Move a Point" screen every time is annoying too. 
---
For real?
---
Only trouble with this is everyone seems to have TSE weapons, which right now are a straight up one shot if you accept the PvP battle with them! Not hating on TSE weapons, I just don’t have/never have had an explosive weapon!
---
From what I've seen it has some problem's from time to time. Then again I might just be confused.
---
Well im just saying in general alot of people are gonna be upset that all their hard earned caps spent on TSE will feel like it was for nothing especially if they recently bought, bethesdas debuff hurts players who recently spent caps there might as well be some sort of variety of compensation for the trouble the average wastelander had to go through to get their hands on one.  
---
only him?
---
Get good. Never had a TSE in my life 
---
Flatwoods monster that can use it's telepathy to call ALL the mobs in the nuke zone towards it's defense.
---
Now THAT is how we get some endgame slaughterhouse goin on!!
---
I knew that, but didn't know that it was so limited! Thanks.
---
I’d legit give my right... kidney... for PvE only servers.  
---
Same. Todd howard
---
put in 176 hours into this game and never knew about it this... though i do run plaugue walker mutation still embarrasing
---
*”First time?”*
---
ok yeah after i cured the diseases at whitesprings like the other guy said. all is well. thanks.
---
Sorry I dragged you into it. It's probably somebody I was just arguing with being the absolute tool that he is.
---
This is one of many reasons before going to a nuke zone, i put on a hazmat suit before getting into my power armor. 
---
I want Gold Bars I can place around for decoration. I want a secret room that has 500 gold bars, 100 silver bars, cash etc.
---
I would but a pallet in there so I could sleep on top of my wealth pile.
---
Well, no more drunk crafting for my character.
---
Lol you say get good, but when you are a melee build and an explosive round does insane damage just by hitting the ground near you, you are dead before you even get close. In fact, only yesterday I was helping my friend build his base when we were both killed by ONE explosive round. But yeah, thats not the problem :)
---
That's the trick with Whitesprings I reckon.
---
Everyone sees it's nuked, and they fast travel there, and the ghouls JUST KEEP SPAWNING!!!
---
It's a self perpetuating XPfest.
---
Plz no not my welcome house
---
I find the six basic ones I use to work well for the area I'm in. I can basically do all my crafting w/o any worry.
---
Hell even passing through.
---
Nothing worse than some level 150 passing near by and all the spawns are like level 50+ all of a sudden.
---
It's getting to the point between the constant server disconnects thanks to the dupers, and the insane disparity in player levels it's getting kind of pointless to play.
---
Ghoul slayer on a gamma gun. Yes,  I've gotten one of those. 
---
Overall,  though, anti-scorched. It's the only specialized modifier that carries a penalty with it. 
---
Claiming yes. Defending no
---
The only ones really worth it ever are the junk ones right now.
---
Might be from a dev room but I'm pretty sure i seen a player wearing it in-game
---
I'm really surprised this hasn't been brought up more often and up voted. People just VATS only I guess 
---
Yes. Plans are rewarded for both.
---
I found them at the raider vendor bot inside the hotel at top of the world
---
Yes, most ppl high lvl players will leave you alone since they have just about everything.  You get plans for you build when u capture a workshop and defend it. 
---
Damn I wanted one too...
---
Personally don't think the current server design could ever do this. Servers would collapse under the weight of some peoples OCD induced collections.
---
Yes both great way to get a lot of camp plans fast and good ones like warehouse and barn set as well
---
Rad-X and Chill..
---
I love how you just slipped erp in there...i almost didn't notice it lol
---
As others have said, the bulking isn't helping you out. Only bulk Lead and Aluminum (some people will say to bulk a few other things, but those people aren't taking into consideration the fact that they have ranks of Pack Rat).
---
Also you can craft new Voice's of Set, so I'd recommend either selling it or dropping it.
---
And why the two PA chassis? Do you regularly use two different suits of PA?
---
That's not really true. You can get by fine with marine armor that's not legendary especially if you modify it with leaded and that sort of stuff. As for build I personally maxed out strength because I like melee, but it also helps with carry weight. Your build will honestly just depend on your play style. If you're not focusing on legendaries yet just max out damage and try out some mutations. I have healing factor+marsupial, and I usually finish fights without dying. 
---
I am a melee build, and am more powerful than anyone in the wasteland. I put my caps on it
---
I’d say Caravan too but I doubt BGS would want that here. 
---
Why to take off genes? 
---
Made me laugh

---
I took out Psychopath, put the higher level perks later (Genes/Class). Swapped for Ghoulish after playing a while I tend to run a lot with radiation so I may as well make it useful until I get up to using mutations. After repairing my gun 3 times in a half hour swapped to Gunsmith and put some survivability perks in (Born/Serendipity).

We just killed the Queen...She was 3 stared...The loot was Vanguards lether armour 1 star legendary and 2 stimpacs. and some other unusable stuffs..... This is sad... Why even bother 45 mins with a kill when it drops the same shit some deathclavs has.
---
You get some rewards including camp plans from claiming and another from defending. If you can spare the 25 caps I think it's worth it. Claim it and then throw up a few turrets. The first defense will usually happen shortly after claiming. After defending I usually hop servers and it will revert to unowned. There's also an 80 atom challange for taking each workshop at least once. I just finished that yesterday at level 70 but it could be done much earlier.
---
Yeah but with the mod you shouldn’t need anything. Did you actually click on attach mod? Cuz when you put a mod on it still shows what it takes to make it. 
---
I never noticed how much glowing meat steak weighs until i had 15 of them on me yesterday and wondered where all my weight went. 
---
For a while I was actually decently lucky with armor then, for the past couple weeks, nothing.
---
I've got level 50 and 40 three-star auto-stim leather armor legs. Each of them raise a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. one point. One decreases the weight of all weapons by 20%, the other the weight of all food and drugs by 20% - for a hoarder like me, they're a dream. Sadly the level 40 piece is fragile as all hell (only about a quarter the durability of the other).
---
Wouldn't mind something as cool for my torso and arms tho'!
---
I'd rather take a drill.

Yeah that happens when you haven't loaded everything yet. I usually wait for my mutations to appear under my AP bar to open my pipboy.
---
Unless you want to spend 10,000 caps on a single item charisma items are great for buying and selling. Other things you dont notice as much.
---
I am trying with the 6% chance on empty clip and haven't gotten it to proc in over 100 shots could be unlucky i guess
---
You sick bastard! 
---
Never agreed with something so much in my life
---
- Slowly discovering locations and doing events. 
---
It took me two months to get around to going to Camden Park. 
---
- Playing the game with my friend and helping him.
---
He taught me that Fallout isn't all about doing the quests. Going to locations, killing the enemies, looting, and just looking around is the main staying power. I basically finished the main quest of the game as soon as I was able to wear X-01 and Ultracite PA, maybe ten levels after. He's around level 35 and all he's really done to my knowledge is the Enclave stuff up to the point you have to do the agility course. He tried that a few times, failed and said screw it. 
---
Did they have a bounty?
---
Actually, when you own a workshop, you are in PVP, full stop. Anywhere on the map. There have been PSA's about this. You were receiving full damage. Most of the posts about this say, IF you own a workshop, never go back to camp. They can see you own a workshop, then they see you idle in the middle of nowhere, and thus where your camp is. The only way to avoid this is to block everyone on the server, or stay crouched the entire time you are in your CAMP, or not claim a workshop. The same goes for Watoga High school, when you are there and the event is running (as I think it automatically always does?), you are in PVP, so, stash your junk if you want to farm plastic there.

1. They don't give a fuck or 2. They don't know what they are doing. 
---
I already sugested it so much times but the tread got closed on their forums..... .They  could atleast make a itemlist  when you hoover over chasis... That would be awsome..
---
I have had this happening when the items are split between the Stash and your inventory and you are not using a craft station near a Stash crate.
---
Tell him to have all the Mats in his inventory or in the Stash. Don't use the craft station at the bunker go to the WS mansion or at his CAMP.
---
I prefer non legendary items as they can be modified.
---
What time zone are you? We're happy to do it. 
---
There's not a chance in hell they would ever consider something like that. 
---
I ran into this problem at a workshop. 
---
Any info on the constant error ce34878 on ps4? After they fixed the game they broke it even worse. My crew is experiencing this error every 10 or so minutes. We have all deleted and reinstalled the game and its the same crap. 
---
4s was the best, you had every perk on your screen right away!
---
That's a bummer. The vanguard would have been awesome would it not have been leather. I recently got 3 diluted stimpacks from her for health items after a fight. Wtf am I going to do with that. I mean it would be nice if I was lvl 20 or something. I have noticed a great thing to get from her is the queen scorchbeast meats but then again why cook them for the extra health when I would only use it for another queen fight? It would be a waste any other time. I also hate that it's the best place to nuke for violet flux. Anywhere else would have been amazing. Literally anywhere. 
---
That is true but I like to mod weapons, unless I am missing something obvious and we *can* modify legendary items and I've not seen how.
---
Just take my caps
---
Dunno, but on pc it does
---
People are lvl 300??? I dropped the game after completing the story at lvl 30!
---
Visually, sure. But the actual system was terrible. They took a perk system with virtually endless expandability and reduced it to a max of 10 perks per special. 
---
I just wish we could see our followers, I have 6 who I'm pretty sure downvote me often. I think atleast three are extra accounts by the first person I made mad and the rest are just because I brought it up in a post. I could be wrong but idk because we can't tell. 
---
This I why the Daisycutter was made.
---
It's well worth the Wanted status.
---
I can see you shooting rigged aerosol cans and wrecking things.
---
On ps4? I can help you tomorrow if you help me. I need those too and not much of a pvp person either. 
---
I did a similar thing in fallout 4 but not quite as in depth as you.  Every armor piece got a number at the beginning, 1 for helmets, 2 for chests, 3 for arms, and 4 for legs.  The arms and legs all had a L or R depending on it being for left or right and it organized everything similar to what OP is suggesting.
---
 happy cake day! 
---
&gt;Would really love a middle finger emote for these moments.
---
You were dead and why would he stick around after killing and looting you.
---
This is an awesome bit of advice, good share. 
---
actual am have you started or no? if not ill make another toon dont want to keep losing all my caps lvl 114
---
Wouldn't the dupers have pretty much crowd sourced that data for them. I mean. If the server can stand up to 500,000,000 lbs of TSE shot guns and people with 55,000,000 lbs of Nuka Cola. They damn well should be able to handle my whopping 500lb of junk...
---
I wouldn’t say that
---
nothing 
---
   
---
the game became very boring since you launched the second nuclear missile 
---
Stop the main quest and just donsome adventuring you will lvl up then move on with the story
---
PA paint above initiate is exploited in.
---
Log out to the main menu and then log in again. You'll hop to a different server and the enemies will spawn at your level (unless someone got there first on that server)
---
Crap 
---
&gt;Then they will use other methods. All you are doing is make it so they will find other ways to do it, and probably focus on the PVE server. Killing based on trapping people, luring mobs, ect. It isn't new and people find ways in each game to do and abuse it. You are not fixing the problem, you would just be applying a dollar store bandaid on it. 
---
Look up how go get the excavator power armor.
---
only a very small minority, I've encountered two the past few weeks.
---
Pick axe Pilsner pharaoh

Do random co op with new players, or get a high bounty and pvp with assassins+sentinel+ap armor :)
---
1) PC
---
2) Jay911
---
3) nope
---
4) When equipping the Gatling Plasma, the ammo remaining on the 'currently loaded' plasma core shows as equal to the number of cores you are carrying. So if you have 8 cores, you only get 8 shots on your first core - although this can be reset to the correct value of 200-300 (whatever it is) by doing a reload immediately after equipping the weapon. However, reload takes an insane amount of time due to its lengthy animation cycle.
---
Hes a busy bugger
---
Tonight I've been on the game for 38 mins. Blue screen of death 5 times. Walking, standing, fighting...doesn't matter what I do. Biggest wast of money in a long time. Bethesda is going the way of the dodo. Absolute trash
---
Make it able to bipod for recoil control, now im dreaming.
---
Same for reasons above. Just be ready to server hop if you have griefers. It's possible to exploit the PVP defend quest repeatedly to give them fair grounds to kill you over and over again if they intentionally fail the quest. It's rare but if you search this sub for it there's a story or two 
---
Again, don't let it dissuade you. You can get good plans without spending hundreds of caps. Just be ready to server jump if you get targeted 
---
?
---
that's hot
---
Mirelurks, I think
---
Some one nuked that super mutant area in the far north west end of the map...I took my t60 armor into the zone and sadly nada.  
---
I have been saving my first nuke for something special....fuck I sound like a virgin tease.....fuck.... 
---
Don't be too scared of the level thing, it's pretty common to fight stuff higher than you. Remember to use chems and have a build in mind, and you'll do fine. 
---
If you use pistols, quite a lot more than that. Their DPS will be far too low w/out TSE carrying them.
---
No you just waste it 
---
I spend more time naming any MMO characters than I do making them look nice.
---
Names are super important to me. So ya I was pissed when I realized the Character name did not show up on screen. I am just happy I didn't make an account name like A1B2C3 or some otherwise meaningless mash if letters and numbers.
---
Damn, that quick huh

He's a man on a mission

I accidentally sold my Assault Rifle with explosive. I cried inside when I realized it after a disconnect :'(
---
A rogue Liberty Prime perhaps?
---
It negates the negative effects for 1 hour.
---
End game pvm is basically popping like 13/19 mutation serums every hour so you’re a super human 
---
I think i have 1 or 2 kills. Have done very little killing, ive revived several people though. Psn: elsuicid0 currently rebuilding my hdd to see if it helps with my errors so might not be playing tonight. But will be on tomorrow for sure.
---
Does it really change the price? I took a chem that gave me more charisma while at a Trading Post and didn't see a change in sell price. The grape mentats do effect trading but it says that in the description.
---
Furious, sound good on paper, but the damage gain per hit is useless. 
---
Who says they aren’t? 
---
They just told us about one thing they are changing. 
---
Probably so that the duper’s will try and get rid of all of them as they start banning people with inventories that are obviously dupers
---
Telling us about one thing doesn’t mean other changes won’t happen 
---
Technically, you're right.  If you buy from a dealership with a warranty.  If you buy from a citizen, it's "as-is" by default.  Either way, the analogy is totally flawed, pretty sure no one got a warranty with their game purchase lmao
---
50 rounds for .308 is a bit excessive, that's just shy of 10 reloads for the hunting rifle.
---
Sexually 
---
Old card game
---
Compared to 180 for .50 when you slap the .50 receiver onto a rifle? 
---
Scorched Grafton tentacle monster that shoots out mole rats with mines strapped to them and hardens into a damage proof ball and rolls around squishing people leaving a trail of toxic sludge that sets you on fire!
---
And also drops a "skin of grafton monster" and you can wear him as a suit offering no bonuses but being scary as hell.
---
Id launch them more often but going through the silos are such a nuisance for me; specially how they just keep on re spawning. That aspect is just an  amateur way of making a challenging dungeon.
---
been killing every now and then wanted players as well as friends for shits and giggles lol think ive killed like 3 players who shot at me first but thats about it 
---
Yeah if the text is green it means it's the workshop resources. Use Contractor perk to lower the amount to get the most pout of it also. When the text turns white that's when it starts using your own  materials. Be careful it doesn't eat up any stashed mods if it starts using your own steel.
---
For the Forest you can do a Mothman boss named "True Mothman". It can fly around spitting acid at you and causing hallucinations. One grounded it creates a smoke screen with its red eyes being the only way to find it. All the while ghouls, and scorched flood the area.
---
Lmfao.....oh yeah good times for sure
---
It's a game design flaw. Everything from the Savage Divide onward will be scaled up to max level if any higher-level players are nearby. Worked ok for the first wave of players, but not now.
---
Ignore the quests for a bit, hang around in the Ash Heap or Toxic Wastes. Do events, murder stuff and farm resources.
---
Get the stool!
---
With mireclaws 
---
... You craft 180 .50 rounds per hit? Jesus that's a lot, I need to pay more attention.
---
Indeed. And also perk load outs.
---
One for crafting and selling
---
One for nine zones

One for my sneaky sniper

Reginald Buy...Mr. Buy as he is more commonly known, comes from a wealthy family who owned the best electronics company of it's era. Donning a crisp tuxedo, top hat and monocle (to better read old copies of The Herald) he is first and foremost a business man, scavenging the world to regain his lost fortune. He a is compassionate, older gentleman looking to spread wealth, knowledge and well-being to his fellow Appalacianites.
---
One night, he was exploring the southern putting courses of the Whitespring Resort when he came upon 2 glowing purple eyes. Mr. Buy slowly approached the shadowy creature, almost as if he was drawn to it. Before he could get close enough to exam it, it shot into the pitch sky in a pillar of smoke.
---
Mr. Buy looked around to notice his surroundings: a cliffside to provide high ground protection...the lushest, greenest grass in all of the Wasteland...close proximity to an economic hub. He took this chance meeting with the mysterious being as a good omen and decided to set up his home there, waiting for the day that he would get to meet the fascinating creature again.
---
Thats usually what i get, have about 43 lol 
---
If your thinking of spending $400+ upgrading just for F76 I'd vote no also. I've played it on both types of Xbox's also and haven't noticed a drastic difference. It does seem to play smoother on a One X model, but that's about it.
---
However there are a lot of other games that it does make a big difference with. Red Dead 2 and Far Cry 5 are noticeably nicer on a X model. Also several original Xbox and 360 games are dramatically improved. 
---
I experienced this today, as well.
---
I was north of Watoga...I'd just survived one Bravo with my combat rifle and found Deathclaw gauntlet and was in the middle of defeating my second.   
---
I kept on taking unexpected damage that would make the air around me shimmer, but I could never get a bead on where it was coming from. I figured it must just be the Bravo hammering me with energy attacks, but since I've got pretty good resistance, I was wondering why I kept seeming to take another BIG slug in there. I had plenty of Stims, so no worries. I'm taking out another one of those demons, so I can take a few punches while doing so.
---
But then after I took down number two, I was still getting damage. It wasn't that little snag where my shoes hit the curb sometimes in the middle of nowhere that just kinda surprises me...I was taking REAL damage. Some mysterious invisible beast was hitting me, and no matter how hard I swing, I can't hit it.
---
Eventually I gave up and left the world behind. Perhaps there's some life-form we are just not yet aware of, and cannot see, who is the real threat to our world...the nukes, plagues, and mutated abominations may just be the start of our problems.
---
What gallery? All I see is the one picture on mobile. 
---
I’m lvl 118 played since beta on PS4 I now rp a lot and rack up my kill count as one of the wastes most prolific serial killers 
---
I had one for all of the Nuka quantums giving a nice blue night light
---
O' no that nerf is coming. But they're leaving it in for the time being. They need to scan more accounts to find more exploiters. Since we all currently have TSE weapons. Thanks to duping. They are holding this nerf back. As I have no doubt the duper mules are all static and off-line. Once the TSE nerfs hit. These shit heads will turn to bobble heads to cheat. Need to log that mule, thinking the danger has passed. Then Bethesda can hand out permanent bans to substantiated exploiters. 
---
Vmi? 
---
They messed so much up with the last patch again...... its frustrating.
---
I'm 210 and I think I'm finally done for now. I guess what kept me going was the grind for TSE weapons. That's a waste of time now though.
---
that gives me a idea, im going to make my next character look like trump and build the best wall I can for the memes maybe some anti obama care signs ect.
---
Claw jobs
---
Yeah. Real observant. Ever heard of Fortnite?
---
The game that was created exclusively as a cooperative, PvE game that died before it even launched was transformed into the single most profitable game ever for the time it’s been up once PvP was introduced. 
---
I abhor the game and its mechanics but there is no denying its success. And it is due EXCLUSIVELY to a developer listening to PvP’ers. 
---
Click on the imgur link

The decontamination arch should wipe all mutations.

I want to see some tears.

Even after I had all the materials on me and out of the workshop inventory,  I still had to get extra of a couple things.

You can try the [Order of Mysteries](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Into_the_Mystery) quests.
---
Might get crabs 🦀 
---
I mean that's not proof. I could say right now that "I was banned for duping" doesn't make it true 
---
&gt; But dupers have made the weapon into a common 
---
So punish everyone else.  I don't have a TSE.  I have a couple of 2 shot weapons and I finally got my first explosive weapon last night.  Instead of helping me, they are about to be barely better than a normal gun.
---
Bags despawn after like 5 minutes anyway, so...
---
Nothing is safe in the train station. I've seen the Mr Handy's and the other robots come in and light up the station vendor.

That's what she said.

...wait...
---
Had a legendary protectron explode and kill me as I thought I was out of blast range, some jerk stole my junk as I was heading back. Wooden legendary armour on protectron.
---
Found 2 more legendarys together killed one &amp; wounded the other it then died in the first ones explosion. Brain tells me bot has already gone nuke so go loot, just looted the second when it went boom &amp; I died again - cursed brain for stupidity. Some single star robot armour &amp; single star cultist blade. Entertaining now when I look back on it all. 
---
Maybe rad chicken fights?
---
Who's saying this is going to free to play
---
Add the option to nuke my hairy ass hole
---
This guy has the right idea. Now if only they had a sombrero and a poncho in the game 
---
They already killed there game.  Let them put it out of our misery.
---
Overdrive + automatic rifle or heavy weapon = you crit a lot. You also might run into situations where psycho or overdrive can save you a shot or two, which can help.
---
What's wrong with making it free to play? 
---
There isn't one? All I see is: [removed]
---
100 base, 180 with level 2 ammosmith
---
My anti SB weapon is a 1* Anti Armour  M2 machine-gun it roxors my boxors. It is only level 35 or something but it is the best anti SB and SBQ weapon I have.
---
I mean I love my TSE Gatt and my 1SE Gatt for mobs and general mayhem but for SBs and the Queens.
---
It also just LOOKS epic. The power armour and BMG go so nicely. 
---
Monster Hunter : World. 
---
Oh wow, that sucks, sorry. 
---
I found one of these deathclaws out side the Galleria by the Red Rocket. He was alive and fighting a gang of scorch. Before I could come over to investigate and kill who ever was the winner, another deathclaw spawned behind me and had to be dealt with. By the time I got over to him, he and all the scorch where dead. 
---
For which weapon?
---
I played passive until I see a base right outside White Springs golf coarse.
---
lol
---
I agree with you an extent but i also feel like it is a big hit to dupers so while not worth it as an adjustment based on pvp alone with the hit to dupers it is worth the increase in difficulty in pve in you used ranged. Melee is still op so only some are impacted anyway that were pigeon holed into one playstyle . 
---
It requires Marsupial. Basically, you’re jumping through the ceiling to be outside of the map. Evidently, once outside of the map, you can bounce around a little and wind up inside the control room without firing a single shot. 
---
Like i said. I’ve seen it done, but don’t have the details on how, other than I know it worked for the guy. Did it right in front of me. 
---
The slap damage taken should be a static value. Certainly not a percentage. I for one think the slap damage just doesn't belong in the game at all. They could still walk up and punch you signifying they want to duel, and just not do any damage. That way we wouldn't have the problem of griefers being able to kill pacifists with their illegitimate bobblehead stacking.
---
God damn. Wish they'd release a better ballistic sniper in that case. I'm gonna be dreaming of Barrett 50cal's now. 
---
My TSE weapons. As they are getting nerfed next patch I might just quit, enemies in this game are massive bullet spounges without said weapons and the only viable builds Will be the melee ones (I cant stand melee in FPS games plus its boring).
---
There was one in FO3 (at least) which was still in the frame, but had a huge hole in the wall right next to it. 
---
They really freak me out a lot.
---
Wait, the Toxic Goos from West tek? They'll give you a random mutation every time you consume one?
---
Seeing is you are making weapons from scratch, there should be pipe weapons of any caliber(except energy, of course). I am in full agreement with this.
---
This
---
And this
---
I'm almost lv90 and nobody has ever griefed me.

I preordered Tricentennial Edition and played it since B.E.T.A . I can understand them for cutting the price just 1 week after launch. But If it go F2P ,without any sort of compensation (not 500 atoms... 5000 atoms would be reasonable) I would be very pissed ...
---
\^\^
---
Hell, I haven't even seen a single syringer mod in this game yet (besides the quest given temporary ones) and I'm over lvl 100. Where do you get them?
---
Virginia Military Institute. There was speculation about it being in the game on this post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/8olkse/interesting\_locations\_for\_fallout\_76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/8olkse/interesting_locations_for_fallout_76/)) but I wasn't sure if it made it in. 
---
What were you mainly doing for the past 100 levels?
---
"—16 times the detail."
---
Get the dense mod on your armor, it reduces explosions damage by 50%, if you also have rank 3 fireproof (45% resist) you are for lack of a better word immune to explosions.
---
If explosive weapons ruin pvp then adapt and throw it back in their face. You got this.
---
What level are you?
---
If they instigate the fight and lose "revenge" shouldn't be an option. Revenging what? Their poor life decisions?
---
There's so few boss mobs in the game. It's disturbing how much content kinda just doesn't exist in terms of enemies. They made the liberators and stopped at that, why? Introducing a new robot faction to only make 1 bot?
---
I'm also curious. I tend to crouch most of the time, as well.
---
There are emotes like Trade, Follow Me, Hungry, Thirsty, Lost, a Heart (which is generally considered to be "Thanks"), Startled, Thumbs Up, Offer Party, Thumbs Down, No Way, Irradiated, Let's Cook, Confused, Frown, and Taunt.
---
You're not offering any reasoning, this "rant" is like 20 words man you gotta do more than that
---
Nice I never thought of that
---
If only there was an industrial strength cleaner available. 
---
I think they were going to have one bullet be full strength and the 2nd be 25%.
---
If it were split evenly it might actually do less damage than a single shot once armor is factored in.
---
On PC, it's pretty decent  Some of the bugs that exist on console don't exist on PC, but there still are bugs.  However, all the ones I've encountered are pretty minor and don't affect gameplay.
---
Seems to be for me. While I felt guilty during the first month of play. Because my game was stable, never crashed, and was relatively bug free. Why? No clue. I honestly couldn't wrap my head around the complaints as the game worked well for me. Since that time. As it's improved for others, It's gotten worse for me. My burden to bear I guess.
---
the heart emotes conveys thanks pretty well imo
---
If you're on PC, I'll trade you a two-shot explosive .50 cal, handmade or shotgun for that.
---
In fo4 I had stacked so much prewar money I built an extractor with conveyor belt on the second floor to dump pre war money into a glass 1x1 "room" .. when that filled up ..it ran like 76 does now. . laggy as all fuck.  Totally worth it 
---
Terrible post ... This is why we cannot have nice things ... and who are you to tell anyone what is fun!?
---
Maybe he thought you weren’t worth the bullets 
---
“Oh it’s just a Giant Rat, wearing a hat and orange jumpsuit”
---
Dude I was probably selling to him when you pots this. Just left him
---
That is what happened to him 
---
I agree. Doesn't feel even. The methods to initiate or force someone is outright terribly implemented. They need full PVP and PVE servers to help mitigate the ganking issue.
---
Two Shot rifles won’t fair too well since the second bullet has no guarantee of hitting the target. It just kinda heads off in any direction meaning a sniper rifle with two shot would do less damage than a normal one
---
That damn dmv quest lol.  
---
Also did this with a weed mod..dropped a billion nugs in said room. 
---
Ohhh. I don't think it is, sorry. Granted, I haven't explored every square inch of the game, but I've put in quite a few hours and haven't seen it. Maybe they called it something different? 
---
Well, the game takes place in West Virginia, not Virginia so I see no reason why VMI would be in the game. 
---
Embarrassingly I was over lvl 25 before I figured this out. I now wort my inventory by weight when  at my C.A.M.P.  
---
Pity it doesn't give you total weight of stacks.
---
There’s one on top of the roof at West Tek you can just pick up
---
It stays even after you have left but not for long 
---
Talk about a grind fest. Great game but my god 
---
Bulk junk weighs more than loose junk. Also, why do you need that much bulk stuff anyways? I keep no more than 50 of every type of junk. 
---
I had some tool 15 levels higher than me love tapping me after a queen kill trying to get me to pvp. I wasn't about to fall for that shit. I walked off. He followed and kept shooting me with his explosive shotty. Until I walked into a shot and blew it up on his face. He gave me some nice loot.
---
No worries, and I’m just sitting on the launch mission so why not mess with the fresh dwellers? 
---
This.
---
Op if you want your message to have a chance to be heard include some reasoning and logic.
---
I legit dreamt about this exact thing the other day, was you in my dream? :) 
---
Did you fucking read it? I kill them. Multiple times but they just keep respawning and automatically dealing full dmg because the revenge is broken.
---
Incorrect ... most of the PvP playerbase (and there small attention span) will move onto the next big thing if there demands are not meet and leave the loyal with a broken over-nerfed game
---
Upvote for '2 birds' quote :)
---
Not anymore.
---
I'm pretty sure I saw somewhere that Mole Miners are somewhat based on him.
---
Sweet sweet revenge. Haven't got that lucky. Had some decent fellas out there tonight though. One guy kept swatting me with a cane knowing full well he could fuck right off. Then he gave me 400 rounds and bounced. Fair trade.
---
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
---
I've never had my base wrecked. I had a wall destroyed by a super mutant down the cliff once.. and trust me, I was crushed.. scarred for life even. The whole 1 wood scrap it took me to repair it damn near ruined my life.
---
And.. that had nothing to do with another player, oddly enough.
---
Does your mommy know you're using her Kindle to spew nonsense on reddit?
---
Keep it up and she might ground you from Pokemon too.
---
Nah, a Sloth King named Sid. 
---
Fallout was always about the exploration ... there are some very subtle beautiful things in this game! You just have to be a reader \*shrugs\*
---
No, if everything constantly has to be loaded into the game, I don’t want the server crashing cause xXpUssYslAyEr420Xx and all his friends want to have one of every power armor on display in each of their camps. 
---
Exactly.
---
they work hard to ruin the game completly...
---
If it doesn't say Nocturnal, I don't even pick it up.
---
They where likely exploiting. Stacking bobbleheads and magazines. As that is the only way to currently FORCE pvp on a person. Don't log next time, record it, write down the names and report it, with the attached videos. Don't say anything to them. Just report it. You'll be surprised that Bethesda is quite keen on banning these people. As most of them are dupers and will happily know they're names and have their account information.  
---
Maybe one day they could add alternate character starts. e.g. you're a remnant of the Responders, a Raider, a resident of Vault 94 perhaps.
---
Less viable builds is what im getting from inside the vault. Oh well ive been enjoying working on my melee lately.
---
Luck points improve odds on some or most luck perks, int is crafting durability, endurance bonus hp is decent enough, perception is vats range still I believe tho I wouldn't be surprised if they gutted that
---
I want someone to nuka Tanagra Town.
---
Yes they are non movable 
---
Why?
---

It removes you from their map so they can't follow you around though

Maybe we could just play one of the many board games we find littered around the ruins?

but u know this going to nerfed to useless level?

Nuking Grafton Steel could be interesting, considering there's already like 19 million super mutants living there.
---
Thanks to all that came
---
The black powder rifle afaik is the only weapon that you can put the bayonet on
---
I mean his point still stands. Cuz their is literally ZERO downside to fixing the typos.
---
I generally try and be nice. I was cleaning stash space earlier, just hopping vendor bots, and I see two 30ishs in my camp. They were just utilizing the facilities, so I gave one a weightless junkies minigun at his level and 3k 5mm rounds.
---
You clearly do not understand what the phrase silent majority means ... I hope you are sufficient to know the irony of being a moron and a narcissist at the same time :-)
---
This is an example of the toxicity I would expect ... ad hominim ftw, lolz 
---
I am only level 53 and haven’t done all quests yet
---
But I find it enjoyable to roam the waste without armor, empath mutation and only a hunting rifle
---
And occasionally I do quests with this equipment setup 
---
No but he’s had them pretty consistently for me
---
Nah, if you are so inclined to be nasty you can. once you see someone is at their camp in say the bog, but has a workshop at Poseidon, you can start a claim on the workshop to get in pvp. After that you can fast travel to them at their camp and still be in pvp. Since you are in pvp and at their camp, any damage you do to destroy camp things won’t earn a bounty.
---
This allows players to stalk other players to find their base, force pvp, and fast travel to and level said players base earning no bounty.
---
With Ammosmith at 2, UC 308 is 86 per batch I think. Apart from the flux and ultracite, the material costs are the same. 
---
Get shot by a lvl 200 rocket turret, ripperoni.
---
I dont want to compete ... I want a quiet moment from the universe ... \*sigh\*
---
Okay, if you feel that way, try going up against two bears at once with melee...  they are like tanks...  You'll quickly find out why power armour is needed.  
---
You can find bears on the very bottom right of the map.  
---
I’m sure the reason some of us didn’t experience any crashes soon after launch was because duping hadn’t been exploited yet. But what I can’t understand is why disconnects seem to get especially worse right after each and every patch. 
---
What would you like for the lawn flamingo? :)
---
where else can I find it my thick thighed friend?
---
I’m running into this too. I think it is bad design. 
---
There definitely needs to be incentive for nuking areas but I still think rifle should be banned (promoting and participating in duping). 
---
It is the large resort in the middle of the map surrounded by a golf course. The basement has a large hall that is full of every type of vendor and a workshop with all of the benches &amp; stash boxes. It is a a popular nuclear strike spot as it is an easy place to farm legendaries from enemies and irradiated flora to make end game items with.
---
Action boy does work in PA
---
I just want to be able to display all my paper bags.
---
I'll make you one. Ign esimpson212
---
two shoot weapons just fine, when two-shot explosive not. but they ruin the two shot weapons too....
---
I’ve got it from diseased deathclaws as well
---
My problem is when It become extremely resource intensive when compared to melee and does less damage to boot. It's a step forward step back kind of thing. Hope the can properly balance it as a whole, will see. 
---
trying to offload dupes for legit items?
---
Plan hunting. Atom farming. Plan hunting, while arguably a mindless dredge of time. I know that sweeping changes to the loot and legendary systems are coming. Since I'm a 15 int build and focused on crafting and modding. Being one of the few who can make full heavy combat armor, and full Marine armor sets with all mods will come in handy.(I'm HOPEING, well I am betting)Just like it did leveling LOL. Once the duping crap passes and they add a new tier of itemization. One I think can only be crafted. I'll be sitting pretty. But I certainly am not sinking hours and hours in the game atm, I do my stuff then go and play another game.
---
Yep. Anyone high enough level to don a hazmat suit heads down, takes a few pot shots at her, then runs and hides in the shed. 
---
Oh, it was sentinel armor, he was standing still.  I've been trying to find dense marine armor for a while.  Thanks!
---
So I cannot play in 'PVE mode' and claim a workshop? That is a ridiculous design decision. It removes a large section of the for those that do not want to participate in PVP. 
---
It's bloodied, and explosive is still going to be one of the best secondary affixes.  People are fear-mongering hard over these nerfs lol
---
lol too bad explosive will still be one of the best secondary affixes post-nerf
---
ESO has new character selection for each 'Chapter', so maybe when 76 gets something bigger than a DLC (viz. a new map) perhaps we'll get to see faction selection. 
---
If you are on pc I learned the plan and can craft you it
---
You have 0 AP. Between the penalties for your diseases and mutations, your AP has been reduced to 0. 
---
Platform and gamer tag?
---
Helm - Player's choice really. I like having the Targeting HUD so i know where the stealth mode assaultrons are
---
Chest - Motion Assist Servos (+2 Str) , or Jetpack if you have cores to burn. Some say Medic Pump for the Auto Stim effect
---
Arms - Optimized Bracers (reduced AP cost for power attacks), the other mods are all for Unarmed 
---
Legs - Calibrated Shocks (+50 Carry Weight per leg) 
---
Paint - Nuka-Cola is a classic, or buy an atom shop paint job. T-51 w/o the paint is an eyesore.
---
I'm on PS4. Will be free in an hour if you'd like

Lol I was going to say monster hunter world but someone beat me to it

looks like you have to wash your hands with that water pump outside until they do
---
I’ve heard:
---
* 20 real time hours
---
* independently for each faction
---
* apparently counted from the first point when you sell to them.
---
i run my serum shop on my alt and spend the money on different items
---
They really need to do something with this stupid madness when u have a legendary heavy gun with 90% weight reduction it’s still around 10lb .-. Wtf is the whole point 
---
explosive nerfed to 25% too...
---
Does your ego feel better after your poorly thought out insults? You seem very bitter.

i use steam overlay by adding fo76 to steam and opening it on my browser

I am a level 100 player. If you see me I will be glad to trade or drop stuff off. If you are being attach by a -fill in the blank- that is a higher level than you I will lower their health for you to finish them off and so that we both get the XP. 
---
Is each white spring wing it’s own faction because I know I sold today and the ones in the bunker have restocked 
---
Got to admit I had a awful experience today with queen crashings. Had to set the game down before I smashed my monitor. 
---
Trying to complete game 100% before DLC
---
Yes, I agree. I think in this particular issue they need to adjust the repair costs of ranged weapons much lower, raise the repair costs of melee and lower the durability (makes sense if you think about it, like how many times can you whack a hunk of metal robot with a hammer before it breaks). Maybe offset it by increasing the costs of crafting and modding ranged equipment. I don’t know exactly but like you said I’m sure a balance can be found.
---
Just sell off most of that bulked junk every time vendors reset.  that's a ridiculous amount of bulked junk.  you really don't need more than 100-150 non-bulked of any junk at a time, and many types of junk that are rarely used even less is fine.  When you need to make ammo, just server hop the can chimes in the penitentiary (there are 9 of them) that's 81 lead and 162 steel every server hop and you can scrap the cans and craft the ammo right there.  Takes maybe 30 minutes to get several thousand rounds.
---
stop make post about fun things because the bethesde will nerf it.
---
Not sure if it was a common drop be I found mine on a dead scorched beast in Glassed cavern 
---
To be fair I had like 1k guns on my mule but the notice basically accuses me of duping and I never did. I was trading with someone who dropped them and logged out. I sent them screenshots of our psn messages showing that I never made them or went out of my way to get them. I know I should not have picked them up to begin with but that’s easy to say in hind sight I guess.

The guass rifle plan is sold by the Enclave Military Vendor and the BoS vendor in Watoga. Not sure about circuits, never needed to farm them.
---
He’s an upvote for someone who not only fully understands the current state of Fallout 76 but who also has a firm grip on the realities of gaming in general.
---
I definitely agree that Uranium Fever is one of the best Events in terms of player engagement and enemy spawns.  I run with crews 40-90 and we consistently get rank 2 &amp; 3 legendary spawns.  Got my only rank 3 gear from doing so.  
---
Powering Up events would be a dead ringer too if had the same legendary spawn rate.  Great XP with number of enemies spawning plus their are multiple ones for different leveled areas so that’s good.  A few tweaks and this would be an excellent place for random team ups.
---
I personally don’t like the hoping around and clearing every enemy part of Horde.  I always seem to get some numbskull glitched in the geometry or just stuck somewhere.
---
No, you get pans for claiming and defending, random, based on rarity.
---
I'm just curious: How do you know this? Common sense, and I do believe Bethesda has engineers that know the math (or at least they should, that is the least they should do as a professional game corporation). What you are describing is not merely a "nerf," it is pure punishment. The guns would be worthless. :) This would only be done if Bethesda wanted to eliminate the gun from broad use. But they would probably have expensive perks that could remove these restrictions. Yeah, it's the death of a gun. Why worry when you have 100 different others you can play with? Yeah, the one-shot is no longer possible. Sure, but now you need to play the game like you were supposed to. No magical tricks, no godsent exploits turning people into demigods in the game. 
---
Have you ever seen someone who could shoot down the queen in less than a minute? The guy in a blast-zone let the rest of us bring her health down during self-imposed pauses, and then he would blitz with something that sounded terrifyingly big and bring the Queen down a quarter at a time. It was ridiculous, god-like. But the Queen sometimes just locks up and gets beaten down without any resistance. It is really sad. Like a "what the fuck?" moment. It is so ridiculously easy. I get to shoot the spawned scorched and prick the Queen, but other than that, I'm a spectator that pays with stimpaks and radaways, and chipped armor and weapons in a crazy environment where you are attacked by all kinds of shit. But it should take roughly 20 minutes, quickest possible with everyone having their specials and perks optimized should be 10 minutes to take her down. Yeah, minmaxing should not add much to damage. Now be forced to go fight a deathclaw. Now you will enjoy the game.
---
I know it's not listed, but do you have any nuclear keycards?
---
added just waiting a bit to see if I can get more people to help 
---
Bunker and whitespring are separate.

Can’t help ya buddy sorry

Sunshine Foods: junk and fertilizer

Always rewarded for taking and defending.  If you miss the defense, you get plans for retaking, too.

Eh, they were like that in FO4 too. Nothing new.

---
Double reward when picking nose
---
Great job. I used to have my CAMP there, but moved a little further away in order to place a larger purifier.   What defenses do you have?  I used to get a ton of scorched and super mutants tearing down structures.  
---
Let me know if you need help to go through the silo
---
Some will say it will open the doors to unwanted demographics, cheaters and squeakers mainly. The fo community so far has been anti-social, anti-pvp, while asking easy-mode(no junk drop/ infinite storage/easier enemies/free fast travel). Having an increase of players not expecting much more than a light survival game, and relying on atom shop cosmetics for revenue would improve the games standing, since its now  in a "release ready" state.  I paid for the tricentennial but would be fine if they ever went f2p, anything to increase the playerbase. 
---
Well, a lot of people may have the voice mode on team so they won't hear you.
---
 If would be nice to have it on area or team which works in area mode when you are not in team, but then, you'd hear all sorts of random weird sounds from other players, and their game, and from the game their discord friends, that, well, might make you want to turn it off from area mode.
---
In the past I've tried to keep it in area or team mode but as I got no mic myself the random small benefits don't really outweight the disadvantages. I haven't hear people intentionally trying to do distruptive or nasty sounds or speak anything nasty or foul, but the unintentional and unaware sounds you end up randomly hearing, particularly combined with the fact that the sound direction seems to be bugged, they often sound from direction the player transmitting is not in. All other ingame sounds seem to come from right direction so I don't know what's that about.
---
I'd do it for the experience points
---
[Disconnected from Server]
---
Although I've been wanting an account-wide stash option for a while, I doubt they would make it twice the size of your current stash - that would literally triple everyone's available storage space.  Even 100-200 would be plenty sufficient, even if it requires you to swap characters more often to retrieve the loot.
---
I know that I am talking about the wings in the bunker are those each there own thing?
---
See that all would be fine and dandy if my particular build (or the lack thereof as I play and stack what I need as needed) didn’t require an entire clip and a half of a purely only two shot 10mm sub to kill a single enemy. Sure you can make some builds that build into it but that’s not what I wanted to do. This was my viable option. And to be fair two shot never one shot a Queen. Explosive did. Two shot was never over powered. Simply doing twice the damage you normally did never would’ve one shot the Queen. It was being able to boost explosive to ungodly levels with bobble head stacking and Demolition Expert. Two shot gets to pay for the crime of being an accomplice and not the perpetrator. So while I’m sorry you couldn’t find fun with things the way they are I certainly did and I’m gonna be pissed to have to return to unloading hundreds of rounds into a single enemy in a nuke zone because I can’t have a Powerfist and armor on top of a hazmat suit
---
Or a huge nuka cola boss for the factory
---
They are connected. 
---
Nah you can put it on a bunch of weapons
---
It’s not even two shot it’s two shot with explosive and people’s perk setup. The two shot effect on its own isn’t the problem. It’s just the easy way out for Bethesda. 
---
its possible there is a tons of damage reduction perks. but too costly. the regular amro brake so fast and expensive to repair becuase lack of ballistic fiber.
---
Grats ive been looking for one of those since launch. I would be doing none power armor my self, iron clad, serendipity, doggy, junk shield. For power armor, emergency protocols and vats focused build and or sneak. Serendipity, doggy, being main highlights for any low health build.
---
Weird I sold 7x today and only the bunker restocked and it’s been under 20hrs
---
I believe the main problem for Melee being so OP is how easy it is to get them to practically ignore armor.  Is there anything comparable to Incisor for any other weapon types?  Add stagger chance you become a wrecking ball in no time.
---
Why not make the screech look like Fus Ro Dah from Skyrim? That'd fix the visual aspect at least, I think.
---
You’ll benefit from bloodied weapons starting at 60%, another spike at 40%-50% which I usually hang around, and the glass cannons at 20%.
---
Wow, so relavent to my fallout 4 life. I used to wake up each morning on spectacle island to a bathtub full of quantum. Gone are the good ol days
---
Ahhh...the carrot on a stick issue. Yes, you're playing the game wrong. Frankly, Ignore quests until level 50. Since all the rewards are tied to your level all those sweet legendries you get could all be lvl 50 legendries. Here is what you do, make a crap load of ammo, fix up your favorite pig sticker, head to the nearest Mutant infested shit hole, murder, explore, grab goodies, go home. Come back do it again. you'll be 50 in no time. It's fallout. Despite what fake Fallout fans say while blowing each other to the sound of Cold Iron on his hip. Fallout quests and stories are fucking stupid. Don't bother. One quest line, in one expansion was good, like a decade ago and their still swooning over it. Like their super hot biology lab partner. You're here for cookies, goodies, loot and murder. It's not Hemmingway, it's Mad magazine at best. LOL. Once you accept this, you'll love the game. So throw on your tin foil hat and beat irradiated monsters to death with a boxing glove.
---
Currently I do not 
---
already did it thanks tho 
---
Workshops are limited resources designed to be highly contested.  This is why you are given a pvp warning when you claim one.
---
Thanks.  
---
I totally forgot about the “powering up” events because I just run posiedon until I get the fusion generator plans and don’t mess with them any more. Yeah, it does seem like a wasted opportunity now that you say it. Some boss should come out and be like “NAH, THIS MINE”.  
---
And yeah, once I figured out that the horde events were somewhat predictable (at least some of them) I started doing them more often.
---
Do the enclave questline and get yourself elected President.
---
I don’t know I bet they can do a decent job in the normal system. But yeah you will never be able to have a pile of anything. I think they will eventually let you convert junk to a replica settlement item you can place anywhere but it will count towards your settlement budget. It would also be static. 
---
Another possibility with teddy bears is a display case that automatically populates when you sacrifice a junk bear to it. It would just need to keep a list of what ones you gave it. 
---
I guess I’m really hated with my auto 40mm then. 
---
This sounds like something I would do.
---
It’s only 5 caps after you kill the enemies at the shop. You are rewarded with 20 caps for clearing it so you only net a 5 cap loss. You come out ahead of the enemies occupying the shop have more than 5 caps. 
---
Sometimes I go around clearing workshops in the area I’m in just for the caps. 
---
Jamaica plain town hall in fallout 4 has this too.
---
Nocturnal has a penalty.
---
Yeah I'm always under 20% cus im using sentinels pieces ty for the info!
---
Which perk is doggy? And do you recommend using serendipity if I'm running a full sentinel set?
---
Don’t listen to some of these fucktards. Explosive is still going to be the best secondary mod even after the nerf followed closely by fire rate
---
You are going to want to use my VATS build. I’ll message it to you later 
---
It’s like nukes among the world’s superpowers. As long as others have them, we’re not giving ours up. 
---
Totally agree. I think the easiest thing for Bethesda to implement would be to randomly name each generated chassis as one of ["Power armor chassis alpha", "Power armor chassis beta", ..., "Power armor chassis zeta"]
---
This game seems to lack quite a lot of fairly simplistic content
---
Yup, just craft that ammo.  You'll free up a good 50lbs or so just from that alone, plus with Bandolier it weighs next to nothing.
---
Nope flap limb is that disease.
---
I use full sentinel too but still stay where I’m at, constantly gauging low hp and having to maintain 20% isn’t for me I guess lol.
---
What’s really crappy about it is when you look at a chassis in your Apparel section, it lists the various damage resistances, but all at 0. 
---
Simply having these values show up according to what’s on the chassis would make differentiation infinitely easier. 
---
Going area to area finding all locations to take in the lore, piecing together what happened before Vault 76 opened
---
launching soon join my world 
---
The problem is that you didn’t pay attention to the pvp warning.  You made yourself a target.
---
Yeah its especially a pain to have low health all the time, my camp is in whitesprings and I come into like 70% of servers nuked
---
That would be redundant to assassin. Make it do 2% more damage per mutation effect. That way it ends up stronger than assassin for high mutation players but don't overlap with assassin's more general, less risky advantage. 
---
Its seems like they never expected anyone to level past 50. Id love this idea considering Im level 300, Id hide in my camp with a single turret.
---
sorry dodgy\*, ap cost to avoid a % of dmg taken. More damage mitigation the better imo. If sentinel isnt active you wont get ko'd.
---
billowing pillars of flame and smoke as everything ignites. I was pretty sure mushroom clouds themselves caused acid rain long term and ash snow short term. honestly even if it could be a thing we're already past christmas so it might be better to put on the backlog. 
---
the ash heap does have ash mechanics but is there a lore reason why it would always fall there?
---
as well I've  not spent to much time with that stuff. I still want to know if it is all possible to ditch dive.
---
Yeah, it happens. Seems every update it happens less and less though. Maybe that’s just personal experience.
---
Got the plan. Circuitry is required to build them though.
---
It specifically has to pop near the power substation where there's a .... Deathclaw spawn.
---
It seems to spawn whatever is nearby. If the event starts near bog town you'll get Snallygasters, etc.
---
Damn I've honestly never even heard of that perk and it sounds good! should I get rid of scaly skin for more ap?
---
I like the pole hook and it is basic steel, adhesive and wood to repair
---
That isn’t how you say hi in this game?
---
20% actually.  doesn't change the fact that it's still going to be one of the best secondary affixes still
---
Don't bulk everything. Some junk actually ADDS weight when bulked...it's dumb...I know. 
---
Nuked forest - Hogger
---
Finally a reason to role play as 100% weight slider body type!
---
lmao you are not doing any special damage. Scorchbeast are low tier mobs anyway that everyone can kill
---
There's plenty of things they can do for people that paid for the game if it does go free to play. Going the route of a stripped down free version with the option to upgrade to a paid version would be the best route to go. 
---
Free players: 400 stash limit, 1 character slot, no ability to earn atoms in-game only through microtransactions, level cap (50? Would essentially lock them out of high level content), lower build budget, etc.
---
It would allow the playerbase to grow while not making the people who bought it feel like they got screwed, and also give incentive for the free players to upgrade. I wouldn't mind it this way, but if it were to go free to play and the free version had no drawbacks, I'd be pretty pissed. 
---
I actually find out why that was happening, I had the Empath mutation as a Lone wondere
---
That's a bummer.
---
I think it helps if you have a team. I was with two other players last night and jumped two levels just claiming workshops and doing events. What platform do you play on?
---
It would probably be ok with class freak, especially if running action boy/girl. I dont find ap being A big problem running it.
---
Better to take the work shop back, a lot easier.
---
I agree on the bankable currency.  I played WoW a long time(too long some would say) and having vendor specific currency that can be traded for gear would be amazing.  The system exists for it in game(monster mash candies) so implementing it in the world shouldn’t be too large of a leap.  I think some faction paints or plans would be a good start with more later as the game grows.  
---
Also, on the note of how WoW did it, I think server wide buffs would encourage participation.  Maybe if you defend the munitions factory you get increased ammo drops for an hour.  Defend a power plant and +10% to energy damage.  And not just for those that participate but for everyone on server.  If people do the events then even new characters enjoy better things when they log in, if not well it’s simply a small benefit lost. 
---
Strange. I was at WS yesterday and some ass holes kept throwing Artillery strikes at me and beating the shit out of me while I tried to sell. Humm. Musta been a different server.
---
You can't. That's the legendary effect so no gun mods/perks affect it. If it was an explosive then demo expert would increase it but there are no fire damage boosting perks. So just focus on automatic rifle perks.
---
A giant mothman the size of a scorched beast. Grafton monster the size of a mirelurk queen.
---
Mutated mole miners that look like a supermutant behemoth hybrid.
---
Ps4
---
I try to team when I can,
---
Are workshops worth it though? I claimed a few but they only seem to be good for using your caps to own them and getting junk.
---
25% flat bonus on weapon damage with preserved AoE effect and its increase from perks? Fine with me. I'd rather have to hit something with my shotgun than just bet on one pellet coming within 3 feet of an enemy. Will still absolutely wreck.
---
As many times as I’ve been hit by a TSE, I’d guess that was the proper way to say hi. 
---
I can craft them, and have a spare plan you can buy. Look me up. PC IGN: jchamlin
---
I wholely agree. I think that people only picked it because frenchtomahawk nuked it during the beta.
---
Which is dumb.  I just noticed it on a crate, and it is a pointless change.
---
Oh, see, if that was your ONLY viable option, then you’re out of luck. If you’re less rigid then that, then you know that you can just move on with many other options. Very good point to bring up for discussion, thanks!
---
It shows you are off
---
Actually, this is a good point. Of all the ammo types, a pipe shotgun is without a doubt the easiest to make.
---
Problem with this is the smart ones duped everything. Most people I think did not dupe, but couldn't keep the average weapons with such limited storage space. Do you really expect them to grind new weapons?
---
In 150ish levels I got 2 tse weapons, and I was very lucky I think. This doesn't hurt dupers, they literally have everything if they have half a brain cell, and were going after other weapons foreseeing the coming nerfs. Saw plenty of traders saying, offering any tse for aa/etc.
---
Dupers actually benefit in the sense they will have new stock for old customers looking for the best of the best weapons.
---
was appearing offline my bad I’m on now or just join from social 
---
Yes. This is the kinda stuff I was hoping to hear. The foundation for a not just good, but fantastic game is there, it just needs fleshing out. 
---
And mini nukes, rail spikes, and fusion cores
---
Weird I'm Xbox haven't ran into this problem yet but I'll let you now 
---
Yeah, don't listen to those scamming click baiting rumor mongers on youtube. They'll float any theory if it helps em hit that 10 minute mark for their dollar doo's
---
lol wait until u see what they have instore for liberators. POST content includes liberator sentry bots, liberator assualtrons, liberator &lt;insert robot name here&gt; basically the same robot with a liberator head. Yes this sounds like a joke, i assure u it is not, and if u want i will take pictures. (usual clause, content in the files may not come to fruition, however this is marked as POST, not CUT, so chances are it is coming at some point)
---
I'm just shocked that they wasted the opportunity to make some kind of an ultracite barrel. The ones we have are either gimmicks or useless, with the exception of the DR-reducing one. Even the scorpion venom one deals like what, 4 damage a second? On top of the 5 damage from the actual syringer? That's just pathetic, and even that requires 10 of a rare drop from a rare enemy, that I'm pretty sure gets scrapped by the "scrap all" button anyway.
---
Imagine if we had a syringer barrel that wasn't garbage. -25hp for 10 seconds, crafted with scorchbeast bones. Maybe one that severely poisons, using mirelurk queen meat or bloodbug probiosomething. Another barrel to make the actual impact damage viable, like the needler pistol from fallout 2. Your idea is nice, but we could have one that lets you just shoot any chem - you could buff up your teammates with psycho or like you said cancel mutations with rad-x. Incendiary chemicals, explosive compounds, some kind of electric one that affects robots. Literally anything other than the worthless barrels we have right now
---
I painstakingly recreated Adrien Brody's face for nothing 
---
Fix for Powering Up could be pretty simple.  Spawn a level appropriate boss that shows up in area after something is “fixed” then the next tier boss when you “fully repair” it.  Then highest rank in Control Room for final stage.
---

I named mine George. Because a George started the 300 years off. Why not have a George continue the future? 
---
This has been suggested a lot.  Just hoping to bring more attention to it.
---
It would also be a good point that the level 50 TSE handmade I have is so underpowered that it takes at least 4 shots to kill anything over level 40 so while sure you can say it’s overpowered all you want the weapons in and of themselves never actually were. Only the constant buffs from specific cards and way, way more specifically bobble head stacking made it overpowered. Either way two shot should never have been effected as it was never a part of the issue. A normal explosive weapon could do the same. Hell a mininuke has done the same. Now when they apply a nerf to that then you can stop saying it’s not fair but truth be told you can do everything they do with tse to that fatman and get the same results with a much bigger bang

Weapon balancing should have happened before the full launch. Players have gotten to spend enough time with their weapons and loadout to really be upset by these changes. There are two sides here and clearly not everyone will be happy with the outcome. Bethesda has made their choice so it kinda don't matter how you or I feel about it. I will say I feel like this choice will have more impact than any other changes they have made since launch, good or bad. Either way my concern for this issue is fading as fast as my interest in this game. They have removed the only thing I had left to do in this game. Not complaining just stating facts. Farming for TSE weapons was all I had left to do. Now that is pointless. So now melee will be the next to be nerfed. After all it is just as powerful, even more powerful against the SBQ. Melee is what people will be switching to without a doubt. This nerf won't help build diversity. All it will do is force people into the only good remaining endgame build.

Luck effects container loot, Int effects crafted items. Int and Luck effect drops for events and quests. In the case of containers and world loot, luck only impacts the starting durability and the overall durability bar. Same fundamental rule applies to Int and crafted items, they come with higher overall durability. In the case of drops and rewards, Int effects the drop chance, and the overall durability and Luck effects the number of possible effects on legendries and the number of items a quest can afford. Effectively if you are seeking ot maximize your reward potential, it's best to go 15 intelligence and a min of 10 luck. While 15 luck is better, the odds of dropping items being better is only SLIGHTLY higher, but at 10 luck the overall durability appears to be maxed at 10 luck with found items. Yes, I've tested this far to much than I'd like to admit.

Dodgy is under the Agility tree and doesn't unlock until level 45

On my way!

I feel ya. I’m lvl 28 rn and have come into a few scenarios where things get wonky with quests sending me to places that I’m way under lvl. I just finished the Free States line today and started the BoS line and it sent me to a camp with some level 60 ghouls lol. 
---
The best things I’ve done: 
---
 -Switching to mainly melee with rifles on the side
---
 -Max first aid, get the industrial water purifier, and chem bench plans, and start diluting stimpaks. Way more efficient use of meds.
---
 -Getting ~most~ of the excavator armor. Made the last 2 pieces today but started the quest as soon as I was 25, didn’t have the Springs/gears to make it all at once.
---
 -Tag steel and lead for search and always pick up gunpowder to constantly keep ~300 rounds of .556 on me for my handmade rifle. Really if you aren’t tagging things for search you really should. It’s a big QoL improvement for crafting.
---
I really do wish we had ways not just for at our camps but in the world to let people know we need help or found something interesting. I found grahm the other day but there’s no way for me to let people on my server know I’m on him.
---
Coulda shoulda woulda!
---
Ty bro, I was planning on grinding to 100 soon, and I know what I'm gonna spend my points on now
---
Always thought it would be cool if there were super secret uber bosses that required coordination with another player to spawn. 
---
**Example:** In order to spawn a Legendary Mothman King/Queen you have to have a person complete the Event Quest at the Lighthouse that spawns the Mothman at the end of it. Then have another player simultaneously nuke it. The person “holding” the Mothman there dies to the nuke and the Mothman mutates into the boss version. 
---
Thanks.
---
Well I became a serial killer and weed out the weak 
---
Well the foundation is definitely there.  I mean vaults could be dungeons with different gear types as potential drops(looking at you Tesla armor), maybe more word bosses like the SBQ to help get gear and better weapon upgrades, faction currencies for world events, player hubs that allow you to stock goods at a vendor so no one is murdering your base, Vertibot fast travel/mailing system, etc.  I think the game has tremendous potential, I just wonder how long it will take for it all to come to fruition.  They’re doing good on bugs, hopefully now they double down on building content.
---
Not a problem, my man. Good luck with the grind and have fun 
---
Don't worry dude, it's highly doubtful they will go F2P anytime soon or at all for that matter. Especially since the recent ban waves. Going f2p would make that effort nearly inconsequential. Anyways, this idea has been pushed since beta. People also say 76 will dead within a year and that they will introduce p2w loot boxes despite clear evidence to suggest otherwise. The unfortunate truth is that there are a lot of people who want 76 to fail and they will fabricate  evidence to support that narrative. Know your sources and always ask for evidence
---
Just scrapping. It's somewhat rare though, and you have like ten billion sights/stocks that dilute the pool of barrels

You mean Fallout 5.  Fallout 76 will never be that.

On the contrary, I feel like it's a positive change. TSE's just suck all the variety out of end game right now. I'm not saying they should be nerfed into oblivion - I'm just saying that they should be adjusted. 
---
When a shotgun fired from 50 yards deals more damage than a mini nuke, there is a balancing issue.
---
Hah good luck my dude. If your running low health for that perk AND its explosive... well i have killed myself soooo many times with my explosive gun.
---
I run 1 END and 15 Luck / AGI / PER. Using Gunfu and holding space bar I crit ever other shot and the gam auto targets for me even through walls. Its silly, you even Kill things that show a 0% hit chance just chain critting. THe down side... one mob gets close behind you and your char pivots 180% to pump explosive rounds at point blank. You die VERY fast even at full health.
---
My gun is an explosive medic piperifle. Even healing on every crit which is every 2nd shot it cannot heal me fast enough.
---
Pc master race with xbox controller is the way to go

The DMV building has a TON of ghouls/Super mutants that you can just farm. Decent amount of loot (Ammo/Stimpacks) to be earned. Super mutants give alot of XP so yo should level up pretty quick

There was one in the Fo4 creation club. It looked really cool and definitely fit the pipe aesthetic.

You're right. They could have, they should have and if they would have we would not have this conversation.
---
This is such a a original idea great job /s
---
same to you
---
I feel that with these changes, any accuracy penalties should be dropped.
---
Opposite at Watoga but same as another reply.
---
Was selling a whole bunch of single items and some idiot kept beating me with a sledge. I finished my sale and healed, then turned pacifist off. Bear in mind that I look very non-threatening. I wear a bathrobe and slippers around. 
---
So I tell the dude to chill out and stop acting like a spaz and he whacks me again. 
---
Bad choice. Lit him up with a Furious 10mm and damn near one clipped him. Reload and a few more ballets nets me 59 caps plus the junk he didn’t sell.

The custom name could be “Come Wreck My House!”

Not against the idea, especially once played vending becomes a thing, but as is, it’s an enticement for jackasses to come cause trouble.

Good job killing those dupers.

---
Would only be redundant if your target has no mutations. And with 18 mutations in the game the bonus damage would be +36%. Post TSE nerf patch that would be one of the best legendary effects. (Depending on the number of mutations you have of course.)
---
No, can’t join, you are offline:(
---
You can also just buy a Gauss rifle from Modus. 
---
before the buff to super mutants, it was very much worth it. you could take the workshop there and nuked workshop defense, which was pretty cool. everything that spawned turned glowing or was escalated in one manner or another. but since super mutants have been buffed, the ammo/exp ratio may be bad.
---
Challenge yourself and get all the key cards and get the launch code yourself. I was going to do that, and still am. One day I went to Silo Alpha just to see what's up, and I ended up doing the whole thing. It was a struggle but then I got the the part where I needed the code. Until that point I had my 10+ cards wiped every week before I got a chance to do them. This time I only had 1 so I looked up the code and launched it. I still need to do the whole thing by myself. I also have a few of the main quests to do that I have been saving, because I like to not 100% a game, because then I know I will really have nothing left to do. Sometimes I look at the items in the CAMP menu and say I need some statues for my house. Some busts etc. I need to track down those plans. Or the radiation emitter trap. Still need to get that one. I'd like to get Heavy Combat Armor with all the perfect stats that I want. That's something for me to grind for if I get around to it. Somebody said the targeting HUD on PA causes crashing, so I guess I'll be removing that from my Excavator helm. Maybe that will help my game crash less. I need to get a bunch of levels still to perfect my build. Still have a bunch of cards I haven't maxed, and a few weapon perks I haven't even started putting points into yet. There are still some Events I haven't done yet also. I'm over level 110 and have played over 300 hours. I can get really tough on the game sometimes because of crashes or disconnects but take that out of the equation and I really like the game and there is still so much to do, if you don't rush everything.

Nice Try, Bethesda
---
Time will tell, but if I was a betting man (I am) I’d say that there is no chance that they won’t throw at least the same amount of support and content behind this as ESO which had a waaaayyyy worse launch. It would be foolish to do otherwise, it’s a legacy franchise that’s older than a large portion of its playerbase.
---
So I've worked alot of jobs in various industries? 
---
Why is support for the installation and maintenance of fibre op systems across elaborate? I worked for a large telecommute at the time? Previously I had worked as an auditor(quality testing) for them....
---
I've also been;
---
A tech support person. A cashier. A Program Manager (small call centre that handled donations for a conservation group), a Volunteer Coordinator after being a supervisor for a Charitable Organization, a Gas station attendant, worked in a food processing plant plus a slew of others, including snow removal (which was actually solid money as the city contracts out snow plow owners. Lots of snow in the maritimes.)
---
None of those are some elaborate, super high tier job. I've lived in various parts of two provinces. About the only job I haven't done was worked at Tim Hortons
---
It's not to invalidate an opinion, but simply to point out that there are in fact times when ToS or T&amp;C actually do matter. 
---
And again. Yes I did it. I was 16 and sold Diablo 2 accounts. Because I was a moron child who justified what I was doing with statements like "They aren't stopping me so why should I stop?" Or "Why shouldn't I be able to sell my accounts. I bought the game. It's mine. I can do what I want with it"
---
And they made billions of dollars, yet you say this was a bad move from Rockstar
---
Added!
---
Great write up.  The game is most definitely best when played slowly.  Exploring everywhere and finding all of the side stories; even if they aren't quests; has always been a huge strength of Fallout games and 76 continues that.  
---
My one complaint is the notes.  Most of them are hard to read and some are completely illegible.(subtitles maybe?)  If they lead to nothing, then whatever, but some of them make me wonder where the story goes.  
---
Happy exploring!
---
Find a place like the prison that has a lot of super mutants. They always have caps, gun and ammo on them. Take the caps and sell the guns.
---
Forgive me if I'm wrong but Isn't it suppose to be 1 extra "projectile" which does 25% of damage and not an even split between the two? Last time I checked two shot shotguns add one additional pellet which does 100% of the damage of all the other pellets combined. I assume despite the nerf the bullet logic will remain the same
---
really? I’m online 
---
It crashes all the time cos Amazon cloud servers are just trash, they needed to implement proper server roll outs like WOW. I mean even the stupid mega server crap that ESO runs on is more stable with less lag
---
Now if they could release a clean version that would be great
---
Agreed. I have a bunch of two shot (non explosive) pistols that I can’t even really use on my pistol/chit build because the don’t connect half the time. They might actually still be viable.  
---
That being said I’m going to be real and assume that they won’t becuase two shot has been relegated to history.
---
I bet you five bears. 
---
Sad but I think they should have kept them at 1* only from the start
---
Nerf this, remove that, its getting old as hell. Its a never ending cycle.
---
Oh noooooo😢
---
So, after 5 minutes of scrolling I found this comment!!  
---
This is on a stage found on the outskirts of Lewisburg. Just north of the station.  
---
I hope you find it. 
---
I think it would be a good thing generally speaking. Crafting weapons would actually be useful besides scrapping for mods, they wouldn't have the monopoly of the in game market and the idea of a self sufficient craftsman and traded would be possible 
---
That would of been awesome. The great debate between explosive vs two shot rather than what we have now.
---
Just remove all damage. Problem solved.
---
I don't believe they should get removed I just think it would be a vastly different game 
---
Most times my TSES heal enemies :/
---
20 ft tall and runs faster than the scorch queen flies and is invincible to stun. Also, drops 1 bulk spring, a fabled thing of legend. 
---
That's a lot of work to be an ass.
---
They have multiple display cases you can build that are completely useless. Its bizarre. Why add in an item specifically made for displaying things and not give us any way to use it?
---
"And this is where I'd display my teddy bear collection... IF I COULD PLACE THEM!"
---
Lol too bad i didn't say otherwise :)
---
I think this would really help the balance of some of these legendary items.  I would love to see these proposed changes.
---
Did you buy it on reddit ?
---
What do we play games for? Many play to chase that carrot. That 3 star legendary OP item. That is the reason they do nuke Whitespring multiple times a day. Or SBQ multiple times a day. Or for those less hardcore once in a while. Take it away and what is the motivation? What will keep people moving forward? What will keep them playing? Make those items no better than any other, and suddenly there is no motivation.
---
k, then was what even the point of your comment?
---
I want mega sentry bot that shoots nukes. 
---
An anti-armor armor piercing pipe pistol with all 15 luck in crit perk cards works pretty well for me.  Finally get to use those 1000s of .38!
---
Total Noob here, just started GT: Silverwolf294
---
Indeed. Molotovs are great for tagging, great point!
---
Im gonna make a fatman build and solely pvp people so they will all scream for a nerf. 
---
no from g2a
---
And this post directly goes against the subreddit rules.
---
Maybe have it scale based on how mutated they are? So like 5-8% with only a couple mutations, but if they have like, all of them, maybe up around 20-25%? I dunno. 
---
Idk, I've been getting it more and more on ps4
---
Besides the grind for super powerful gear ie TSE or explosive there is no content in the game currently that is interesting enough to keep me playing. 
---
If you’re going to take away the main incentive to play at least make the game interesting with quests and challenges.. which is does not do in any sense of the imagination.
---
So, then, ask there.
---
I honestly do hope that I’m wrong about this and Bethesda knows what they’re doing but those words don’t really go along well in a sentence. They’ve proven from the start they don’t really know what they’re doing. And seeing as it took since the release of Fallout 4 until now to simply fix things like FOV, framerates that don’t link to the animations, and even a simple reloading animation, I really truly believe that this simple system is how the computer runs. Why? Because it’s easiest. Here’s how I think it most likely works. (Again this whole post is just speculation and a discussion.) I truly believe the game determines that any physical projectiles linked to any weapon do an equal amount of damage totaling the weapons total damage output. So basically if you’re hit with three of ten pellets of a shotgun you absorb 30% of the damage. But if it is that format then reducing a weapons damage output will reduce all parts of it. The question here is do you truly believe that Bethesda has thought this far ahead to code weapons and bullets so that they can easily reduce the damage output of one projectile but not the other?
---
Agreed, if I wanted to hack and slash id choose a different game it gets old quick.
---
Being an adult and all? Yeah, typing things without paying attention and then not having time to fix them is a staple of adulthood for sure. 
---
Yea I read it, and the first thing you started bitching about was how unfair it is that people playing 4v1 are able to beat you.
---
So what the fuck does removing Revenge actually accomplish in your scenario?  You kill them, they respawn normally, they go right back to trying to claim your workshop, you have to attack them again anyway.
---
Anti-Heal bio-nade would make pvp pretty spicy.
---
Dont forget to hide in someone else's base too that way they get wanted for trying to get to you.
---
There’s a lot to like in the game. One thing I do like is they did seem to do a little digging into the state’s history/attractions and included a lot in the game (enough for the WV tourism board to put up a site showing where fallout related attractions were)
---
The Gutsy Strikebreakers are a reference to the horrid treatment of miners in the early 20th century.  Two songs on the radio from Tennessee Ernie Ford (“16 tons” and “Dark as a Dungeon”) also reflect this troubled past, resurrected by the Fallout universe’s disregard for human life in favor of profit. 
---
Numerous attractions like the Greenbrier (Whitesprings resort), Cranberry Glades (the bog region), Camden Park (same name IRL), and the New River Gorge Bridge are included.  Many myths and bits of folklore are included too, the most recognizable being the Mothman of Point Pleasant.  The inclusion of Gad was a small bit that even some inside WV are unaware of (it used to be a small town, but is now at the bottom of Summersville Lake).  The giant radio telescopes Rose sends you to mess with are a reference to the Green Banks Observatory. 
---
My one gripe?  Evidently no one at Bethesda owns a map of the state. When I first started I was regularly lost looking for places.  Did they need to copy it exactly?  Hell no. There’s tons of dead space in the state. Could they have at least gotten stuff in place relative to where it really is?  Would have been nice. 
---
Very good point man
---
Agree. As much as everyone hated it Creation Club was well priced and has awesome content appropriate to the nuclear apocalypse. They did so well most cooled off after the (imo) ridiculous ferour surrounding it and they now by CC content. If Bethesda can steady the ship and copy that then everyone wins.
---
Yep, you can report them https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44235/~/how-do-i-report-a-player-in-fallout-76%3F
---
However that necessitates flux, and a prime receiver. For my anti mutant weapon. Id prefer a solution that doesn't relegate it to one specific model being viable. 
---
Same boat as you. I switch to meale if others are around just because of the hate for tse owners. Had surgery at the beta and this is how I spend my days, grinding. 5 hrs daily since beta and I feel like a leaper if I use something I earned. Also, yes folks, there are some legit lvl 130s out there. I'm one.

That's where 90% of my plans come from. It really is the best way to just get a bunch of plans. As long as you can stay connected.

I think items are at server resets and mobs spawn when you enter server but I could be wrong

thank you! 
---
You ever play destiny?  They did this in destiny 2 with weapons and completely ruined everything.  Not being able to customize to your playstyle and chase your favorite 3 star legendary set up will destroy fo76.  
---
Yep for sure. Some new content or even stability should have been worked out before a new pvp mode. I dont think anyone at bethesda even has 100 hours in the game.
---
It's partly a usability / interface issue. People don't immediately understand how to trade...
---
Anyway, if ya'll are on PS4 and need a lower level player to trade with, xa0t1ca will be happy to accept ;P I'm up in the 30s now though

It's probably wouldn't fully work, because sometimes, the WHOLE server crash, not just you, but everyone who was in.

I saw all the protest signs for sale listed as weapons tonight at Watoga.  I kind of regret not buying them now.

Lmfao
---
Not what I meant. If you look at 50 or 5mm ammo, you get the same amount when making UC ammo, but for some reason 308 and some of the others get a huge buff in the quantity made, despite requiring the same amount of lead, steel, and powder. 
---
Why wouldn't it just be 20% off then?
---
Yeah happening to me smh😔
---
Does that event actually work?  I've done everything but launch and the queen, been trying to hit all the events but the president one is nowhere to be found.  Do I have to finish the game to do it?

Lucky. I found two Two Shot Gatling Guns, but I don't even use heavy guns.

Did you get an email from Bethesda?

2 shot fatman for the win. I dont care what level you are or your excuse, I'll destroy your base and kill whoever comes after me. Made a guy rage quit last night since I have full sentinel armor and all perks against tse. I hate pvp with a passion but this is one of the few things that makes me turn off pacifist and go for it.

Not for long!

Your name suits you. Unfortunately that’s actually possible
---
But why though?
---
I know you PC guys like to beat up on us console peasants, but isn’t there a feature for PCs where you can grab the last few minutes of play?  I can do this on PS4. It even has its own button on the controller. Makes reporting sooooo much easier when someone uses an exploit like that or lets their mouth get them into trouble (like the idiot yesterday throwing racial slurs after trying to “seek revenge” after I accidentally killed him with splash damage). 
---
I'd be down for it in pvp otherwise you have to give me something to deal with the broken scorchbeasts
---
Me and my buddies were talking about this tonight. It's cool to set off a nuke and all that, but there are literally two places to launch it at on the whole map that yield anything worthwhile. Each zone should have a place where you can fire it off to. Would be especially cool when all three nukes get launched at once. You could hop between zones and try to maximize your return on investment. 
---
This game needs Bosses. Not just one Boss and some legendary's. Actual bosses unique to each zone. The Cryptids are cool to find and all, but  they should be mobs you have to summon just like the Queen. They should be hard as fuck to defeat and the loot should scale to the level of your character or to the zone.
---
Did the payment get chargebacked or something?
---
Yeah the fact that you can't even the scorchbeasts through their excessive sonic attacks bugs me 
---
I see that, but like you pointed out, those rounds also require flux and ultracite to make, and thus require a prime receiver to fire. I think the intent for the quantity buff on ultracite rounds is to make it more worthwhile on precision weapons, but for my gatling and .50 MG I'd burn through enough rounds to make crafting UC rounds more of a tactical decision. 
---
Something like selling exploited game items for real money and promoting those services is kind of one of those things that's a morality check on the first go around.
---
He was putting physical money in his pocket by having his FAN BASE buy shit from con-artists.
---
Don't really feel like I'd need to much more info to make a valid judgement call.

Fuck him, sorry. He didn't start making those videos to be a community asset. He was there making pointlessly long 10 minute videos looking for a pay out like everyone else.
---
Monetize a hobby, sure. Monetize a hobby by taking advantage of your audience? Meh. 
---
No offence, it's just going to kill you.
---
Just one of the lines they say. Ask bethesda why
---
If someone or if you buys from a vendor their caps will reset. For instance, If you buy something for 100 caps they may have 20 caps to buy something from you. So try back later at one of the popular vendors like whitesprings. 
---
Lol. The funny part is I hate pvp but am more upset about the crybabies against tse when its exploits making crazy damage possible. 
---
Past five queen attempts I've only gotten swarms of low level players swarming the place and boosting her HP to impossible levels.
---
Unfortunately no there isn't a way, it would be nice 5o have that though for sure!
---
Tattered Field Jacket and Traveling Leather Coat are rare drops from the mire, NOT from the dev room. Don't start spreading this shit.
---
So you're role playing frank horrigan?
---
Keep them. Then have legendary +4, +5 gained by crafting only. This way anybody can attain these items and pending on your level determines the items level.
---
Always hate people complaining about TSE being stupid and OP, but won't ever have a decent counter argument to me being bonked once with a super sledge while I dump 30+ rounds into a guy. 
---
Didn't know they nerfed TSE, guess I'll have to go back to giving up on any PVP engagement with someone in Excavator PA sporting a Super Sledge. 
---
 So you're role playing frank horrigan?
---
Just within 24 hrs after so-called maintenance my game lagged into infinite loading screen 3times I don’t even know what Bethesda was doing said increase server stability but all I see is new items in cash shop. This is literally the only game crashes or lag so much among all the games in my ps. 
---
Me tree
---
Buisness and money behind this. No one love fallout saga more than me, and this is the reason why is unacceptable how bethesda destroying this awesome game. I was in power armor today and i cant get out again AFTER BETHESDA SUPPOSING FIXED THIS BUG 10 DAYS AGO! Who is destroing is not me, wasting my free time play here and sending lots of useless tikets to bethesda.net tikets been all ignored! 
---
So if I seek and they have 2 caps and have a friend buy from them they will restock to 200?
---
That too

You just never add anything of value to the conversation do you? Why are you still talking if you dont olay?
---
That's robbaz's name 
---
I know your secret
---
Dunno, I like to pretend I'm a firebreather. People look at me weird when I refuse to use power armor, and mainly use an axe :0
---
You probably got killed by something after you crashed, cause leaving in an abnormal way, like Alt+f4 or crashing leaves your character up for like 40 or so seconds, you must've died.

Workshops give very little in terms of resources. Do the workshop events log off rinse and repeat.  IF you want to avoid the PvP. The PvP over workshops has been fun for me. Had a 4v4v3v2 Last night at the Airport Workshop. I don't think any of us really wanted it, just wanted to duke it out. Thankfully no one was oneshotting and it was actually a intense battle.
---
Here are some other quotes from the wiki.
---
* *"You could run? I'm trying to kill you, you know."*
---
* *"Please believe me when I say I'm not enjoying this."*
---
* *"I calculate your chance of success to be...well, I don't want to be morbid..."*
---
* *"I'm not programmed to fail, just so you know..."*
---
* *"They could have programmed me to love, to forgive; but noooooo."*
---
* *"Please come back. I'm sorry about all that recent unpleasantness."*
---
*It seems they are quite nice, and don't really want to harm you, but they are programmed to.*
---
That’s the point. And honestly the worst part is this nerf won’t fix the game or even balance it because it won’t fix the issues. The bobble head problem can still work after the nerf, just drop a couple more. It’s such a broken game
---
Please do more research before posting nonesense.. some of those items are just rare drops
---
Good write up bro i agree with everything but your first part. Because i won't ever be ok with accepting a game in such a bad release state. In the past modders were quick to fix the bugs and issues for us on pc. But this time its very noticeable difference when they cant get give us that.
---
I think Fallout 76 is an amazing idea and i can't wait for the future dlcs. But i won't forget the past few months. Even now i deal with alot of crashes and issues still. I want to get some of my rl mates into the game. But the launch created such a stir its hard to change their minds.
---
Hoping they get better at testing their games with Starfield , Elder Scrolls six and future dlcs for 76.
---
Yes you're the *only one*. 
---
Too long 
---
Like the lvl 8 guy I saw tonight in a hazmat suit trying to leech off the SBQ event? There were so many players there below lvl 50 she never got below 75% health.
---
I've noticed some people dropping serperate nukes as a team so the lower levels will just flock to whitesprings. A nuke there first and then the queen, most of the high levels go to the queen and the low levels use up their radaways and stims there so they don't even bother
---
Sentry Bot helmet reduces damage from robots.
---
Thing would be dope then.

I became an ac130 and am now trying to change into something more stealthy like an f22, especially now that they are nerfing my cannons

Well they do have brains

Put the game down. Step away for a couple of months. Look at the patch notes and see if they've possibly done enough to get you to try it again. I understand the frustration and that it's not fair that you have to wait that long to play the game you spent money on, but honestly it's the best way to keep stress and unhappiness out of your game time.
---
I feel like with every patch, they flip a switch back and forth. First it's working good, then patch, not so good, then patch, back to ok. Its like being in a never ending argument with my girlfriend.
---
If you are asking what I think you are then nope. Gotta run it again if you crash. 
---
No shit? 
---
Easy tiger...the suggested list is the point, the fact that the average joe player don’t know which items are in game and which are not would make this list useful.  I’m not suggesting those very rare outfits are illegal, but I have noticed that they’re are a lot more of them out there now since the dev room fiasco which makes me hesitant to trade for them.
---
Ease up in the caffeine M8
---
 My solution was to slap a paint job on my t60. One chassis has the atom symbol, the other doesn't. 
---
Im just happy knowing I have it! Its so cool looking!
---
But whyyyyyyy. I just finished Alpha when the server went buck wild with “Not Responding”
---
I think a good idea would be: you get a random dropped weapon just vanilla weapon or you craft a weapon and the more you use it, it levels with you sort of thing 
---
Yeah, was running through Whitesprings when it happened. 
---
Thanks for the link :)
---
Me and my buddy have discussed this extensively. My first character(lvl 136) is maxed out melee. My buddy's character(lvl 100+) is rifle/vats/Crit. Here's what we have noticed:
---
When it comes to PvE damage on one target, I do more.
---
When it comes to fighting multiple targets, his gun-fu allows him to kill more enemies. I have to use explosives to tag consistently.
---
When it comes to fighting scorched beasts, he can kill them before they ever land, but if they do land I can shred them faster.
---
When it comes to PvP, whoever hits first loses. In a server with no PvP restrictions he would win almost every time simply because of his range.
---
I think these two builds are pretty balanced since they have their pro's and cons. However, I more recently made a pistol character and a big guns character. Both are viable but not nearly as optimal in my experience. These are the things that need love imo(by love I mean buffs xD)
---
It could've turned inert. Wouldn't hurt to check. 
---
No it is nerfed by 20% so down to 80%
---
I’m on Xbox so I achievement hunt to kill time until new content 
---
Whatcha mean? Like stayed in the same spot? 
---
Thats what they should change the name to as that is what they are going to be.
---
Nice well thought out piece 
---
If it's in the TOS and you choose to ignore you. You deserve the ban. Plain and simple. there is no argument for breaking TOS. Just like when you get pulled over by a officer, just cause the stop sign is no longer there does not mean you can just drive past it. And claiming you didn't know a law or the TOS doesn't excuse you either.
---
I don't want to see them removed or needed just interested in what other people think 
---
Put a Dense mod on your chest and you won't even feel those attacks. With Fireproof perk even less.
---
Nerfed*
---
flux spoils after a while if you don't make it stable flux, it changes its name to *inert flux* and its in aid.
---
Razer uses an amazingly cheap mechanical micro switch under those buttons,I gave up on Razer several years ago due to problems like that.
---
I haven't seen a nuke on whitespring since the exp nerf. Everything has been queen or random a few times.
---
Good shout man 
---
Just remove all conflict. Only charisma special and no weapons, armor, or confrontation. No enemies, just everyone suttinf at a tabke in vault 76 with no conversation or communication as that could cause controversy.
---
do it im interested !!!!
---
No it doesn't. it has depth of field.
---
Which is why they need to change the pvp all together. For example if you fail to claim a workshop you should get cooldown before you can try to claim it again. And if one player in team has wanted and you kill him that shouldn't automatically start the pvp between you and his teammates. Also players with wanted shouldn't get the revenge option. And player who strike first wouldn't get the revenge option. Player calming workshop of another player shouldn't get the revenge option. The revenge should be only for players getting attacked. Like what is the instigator revenging? He attacked he died his problem. Bethesda claimed how they created anti griefing system but the revenge system is allowing griefing pretty hard.

I believe there are different dresses. Can't find any myself. Got all the hats for it though. But they are the same location yeah.
---
This is a good suggestion.  You get at least 2 decent unique weapons that you can upgrade to at least lvl 45 regardless of when you get them. 
---

---
So then that's the issue. The seller probably illegally purchased the game for resale with a stolen card.

Go talk to G2A. If you don't have Shield, you're fucked.

Maybe you know too im right because i know how is frustrating see your favorite game begin abandoned day by day from players because bethesda just ignoring bugs, glitches, crashes and server disconnected and also infinite loading screen, that pushing me to close the app game and switch off my ps4. And no more wish to llay again.. You just should admit it to yourself, is unacceptable bethesda dont fix all those problems. If u want to see fallout 76 desert, well continue in this way, all my friends day by day play ever less because crashes and other problems. I GOT 17 APP CRASHES AND BLUE SCREEN IN MY PS4 IN LESS THAN 30 MINUTES! Including loading time!! And i got today again the bug of power armor i cant get out, after bethesda "fixed it". They are just liars, only want money.
---
Still dont admit to urself. While im texting im ingo an infinite loading screen. Everything is okay!
---
I didn’t go into detail but I did allude to exactly what you said about melee in a PvE environment, and yeah slap damage mechanic favors melee heavily.
---
Rip that sucks definitely remember to store it in stash box next time. Although they need to do something like invulnerability when u don’t have any control over ur character like after game crashes or log in loading . Same log on loading into whitespring just so happen being nuke zone after screen finish loading character dead by radiation already.... or when screen still loading getting attacked by invisible ghoul that’s bs
---
This stinks but you are breaking the rules of the sub with this post.

Found the plans on a table at a large temple ( can't recall the name ) far north of top of the world near B silo. Table was in the garden area with archery targets.

Most important is adrenal reaction mutation. After that I would say dodgy, serendipity, strange in numbers, nerd rage.

I'm turning my low health build into a low health sneak build. Unyielding armour gives you +3 to all specials other than endurance while at low health. With 4 of those pieces, a chameleon piece and escape artist perk you can sneak past almost anything and keep getting that sexy 2x damage
---
You talk to your mother with that mouth? Everyone watch out, we got a tough guy over here!
---
Tell me how to fix the problem. It's honestly amazing how many people think it's a quick fix. This is a very complex issue that if done wrong could break EVERYTHING else. You think the game's possibly buggy and broken now? Just think what would happen if they just jury rigged some code in there without checking to see what else it could effect. One line of code can corrupt the entire source causing everything to freak out. 
---
Don't get me wrong Bethesda released a buggy title and it should of been put on hold till they got the big problems out of the way. This is why Betas are such a huge issue now-a-days. They aren't being used as Testing periods anymore they are being used for Cash grabs now.
---
Hardly. I can make 5 at a time at a tinker’s bench. 
---
I'm not 100% sure on the item reset at this point, originally I read a post saying they are server side but in my experience I've looted some random ass items and they were still gone when I came back through the next day (10 hours later or so) . Mobs supposedly reset every 30 mins or so or when a new player enters the game. Remember nothing I've said are backed up by facts, just my personal experiences. 
---
[Plays.TV](https://Plays.TV) and Shadowplay can both do this.
---
Was it an automatic gamma gun or standard?
---
Nope. Really sucks too if you’re just starting to do them.  Even with OP weapons/armor they’re tedious (though not difficult). 
---
Damn I really need to start checking to see what they have for sale there.  
---
Y’all are missing the point...feel free to actually read what I say rather than freaking out 
---
Its gotten harder but I still try to make my own adventures. I go for walks while listening to the radio. I find really difficult areas for camps.. And i build there. I sneak around the map and watch other players, see what their up to. I play guardian of all newly made Ex vault dwellers. I hide in the cranberry bog and watch big baddies duke it out. I find new legendaries that make me rethink my build, giving me reason to scrap and fight.
---
But i hear ya, man. There really is only so much to do in the game. Maybe take a little break from it for a while?
---
That’s a normal experience sadly.

Oh, gotcha. No, everything in my junk dropped sadly :(

They said it was going from 600 to 800 to 1000 as long as the server could handle it 
---
That can't be real lmao
---
Marsupials to the rescue
---
Raw flux is also in aid. 
---
You’ll know if it went inert too, as your weight will balloon. Raw flux is 1/5th the weight of inert. 
---
You mean the game would be? 
---
Yeah.. Oh well. Now I know I guess :( 
---
Absolutely yes
---
Not a bad post/idea IMHO..  
---
I know for a fact some of the dupers/exploiters have been running around GIVING the stuff away, and logically the only reason to do this is to mask their own activities and make it so Bethesda has trouble effectively banning anyone.
---
I hear ya on Big Guns but in my eyes going pistol is like going knife instead of Super Sledge, it’s an overall weaker damage choice unless you have special effects like Vampire or Bleed.
---
For me because Lone Wanderer has much greater impact on survivability than Strange in Numbers.
---
I agree 
---
I know where I can almost regularly find a few out in the world. Wouldnt pay a dime for them given they are heavy as shit.
---
Lol, so you think the whole non-stop gripe fest regarding OP melee is people pissed they kill themselves with their own TSE's and melee doesn't have the same drawback?
---
You probably already have that 75% armor penetration melee perk, so an extra AA on the weapon probably isn’t significant.
---
Yeah It does, oh and how so? I tried to follow the guidelines as much as possible. If I went to far from the rules I am sorry, all I intended was to ensure others do not make the same mistakes as i.
---
Cool I was unaware of either, thanks!
---
Just let us fucking rename whatever we want with our equip.
---
I mean it's a huge moronic step backwards from FO4 where you could.
---
/r/whoosh
---
Do you blow yourself up with melee? The point is that bethesda said its for balance. People will complain once its done about the next op build and then it will get nerfed too. The cycle will not stop until everything is nerfed.
---
Automatic gamma is OP af in pvp, I think it will shine more when tse are nerfed, I got killed in Full powerarmor in less than a second with it

Go to whitespring golf course and find a buddy or a random who will play with you at a high level. You can just tag stuff while the other person kills it. Also look for mining posters and start the excavator power armor quest.
---
Drop it anytime. Should show up in side quests if you pick some up. 
---
100 is way to much. Id pay around 15 caps each.
---
Yeah probably this next stash limit will be the last so the server dont crash

Haha that's awesome, thanks!  I'll have a wander 'round!

Ooh you look like Paladin Danse!

You arent supposed to post peoples tags on here. Not trying to be a jerk, jist saying.

Try to keep your distance from higher level player, and do the overseers mission to basically have a walkthrough of the main quests.

Fair, but many of the posts go on at length about the inability for ranged builds to compete, at all, with melee, without TSE weapons.  I'm more than willing to agree that it's nonsense, especially after spending a good deal of time swapping to a ranged build for kicks, but wanted to make sure I'm not missing something / being an idiot.
---
I believe it also enhances the positive effect by 25% as well.
---
Is that the clean spacesuit from the atom store? Can you wear the suit without the helmet and can you wear other masks with the suit?
---
I always hear that complaint, melee is broken, but I don't understand it at all. It seems balanced to me. A melee fighter does absolutely no damage until they can get right next to a target. If they cannot do a lot of damage quickly, they die. I am not sure what people want because frankly, if melee damage we're reduced more than 5%, I feel like it would be totally useless. 
---
oopsie!
---
Actually just saw that happen for the first time tonight, and hadn't even realized it was an option (haven't gotten to the point of launching a nuke yet)
---
The other big thing being melee gets -75%of armor ignored
---
As far as I know, ranged has nothing like this?
---
Melee is OP because my guy, with a bunch of strength for heavy weapons and All Rise can fend off any mobs who get within TSE self damage range. I have zero melee Perks.
---
While I can't fight, say, a Mirelurk Queen or a level millionty Deathclaw hand to hand I can smack mobs around if they get too close.
---
I can only imagine how OP it is if they spec for melee.
---
Sure I *can* mow most creatures down before you get into HTH but once in HTH it is click click click. 
---
20-35 is a grind.  It seemed like I started to get a little more variety and a few legendaries around 35.  
---
At 20-25 you're running around with no ammo, stimpacks, shitty armor and farming water.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of level 15-35 legendary gear out there, so either you use low level stuff or have stuff you can't use.  
---
Use melee to save ammo, food to heal, don't worry if you die, do events, fast travel and shop the vendors during/after nuke zones.  
---
E
---
Well fluxes are used for nearly all the good PA upgrades, Mutation serums and the shielded under armor linings..
---
You also use stable flux in mutation serum recipes
---
You know, now that I've laughed my ass off I can actually see this working. It seems kinda lazy though, and now I'm sad I probably won't laugh as hard when it comes out in game.
---
serums for flux
---
outside of what you listed, I haven't found further use for ultracite
---
I have no idea. But you could try taking the required materials out of your stash into your inventory, if you haven't tried that already.
---
All from the asylum. I have slowly been collecting them over time. I am very proud ofy collection! :)
---
Yes, can confirm. I feel like it's the only thing that Tech Data turn-in gives me these days. 
---
The commendation system would be even easier.  Continue collecting combat commendations to use towards legendary weapons or armor. Have the cost high enough that it doesn’t become an quick easy grind though. 
---
I crashed once every hour or two before patch, now it's crashing every 10-15 minutes.
---
I still play, has about 800 hours logged now.
---
In your underwear, whilst wearing a hat.
---
That's only when players sell them items though. 
---
The the vendors closest to the golf course door are usually the go to's.
---
You’re suggesting crippling one of the only innovated new features added
---
And probably because you’re too poor to get serums or lack the time to just farm them.
---
I think there may be a glowing Behemoth, but I don't think it is particularly different.  We need a 3-star Giant Super Behemoth
---
I probably wont touch it again until theres some sort of relaunch a year from now.
---
You spend the same amount of perks on dmg and you are sacrificing at least 9 points in agility which hurts more then 9 points from perception imo
---
I have not heard of this existing, personally
---
Yawn...
---
I get the same thing with him with the revive version of the mysterious stranger. See him spawn yet he just stands there and I die anyway.
---
Bro its destroyed now what are u even saying nothing is getting fix they are nerfing tse gun that i farm for more than 400+ hour just like that and they will nerf melee to ..what else oh wait explosive weapons still broken when you hit any enemy he get full health back mmm nuck to its always 100% will crash ur game.. quean still bugs it doesn't take dmg from explosive weapon everything is just shit in this game and they just try to nerf the fun thing and ban people but not even trying to fix this stupid game 
---
Don't totally buy that explanation... I assume your running around in PA with a nice high DR?  
---
Only ask because I run the clubhouse often, and will grab every glowing one, while shepherding lower levels there for XP and loot, and those glowing ones, In PA,'specced for melee, in numbers they can fairly easily kill you...  
---
Bottle necked and controlled, sure they are fairly easy, but PA is supposed to be like walking around in a mini-tank, so I have no problem with a non-melee build holding their own vs some scorched or Moleminers.  
---
The fact you can fend off and kill off the mobs that closed to CC range doesn't mean melee is overpowered, but maybe PowerArmor's Strength buff  + high DR is and makes anyone a low end melee character. 
---
Also Watoga, the RobCo facility, or anywhere else where you would expect to see a lot of electronics.
---
Level 70 with 130 hrs and I haven't done it either.
---
But to be fair, I only started messing around in Cranberry bog for the last dozen or so hours. I actually prefer to leave things hostile, even turrets. I'd rather get the XP and loot for killing them. Eventually I will do the quest when they get too annoying.
---
But since non-hostile robots are what Bethesda decided to give us as NPCs I have no desire to make any more "good" ones.
---
Now if only there was a perk that allowed cannibalizing robots...
---
There is a tank killer or something related perk card that does somethings similar if memory serves..
---
They can sometimes show up in vendor inventories. Rare item, but obtainable legitimately
---
I just pot shot their feet. And say no a lot. It doesn't work.
---
Yeah supermutants give more XP, nuking is a waste of time tbh. Unless u wanna hunt for the SBQ
---
No gun perks affect it as far as I can see. Also there is a mod for it that can not be applied
---
Fireproof + Dense torso mod
---
Skip step 4.
---
Not sure 5% would make us useless, but I feel you...  
---
Generally melee has very high repair costs due to the number of durability checks our gear takes, armor wise.. Which helps balance the ranged weapon repair argument..
---
Actually there is a perk for rifles to ignore up to 36% armor definitely not as much as melee but they do have a perk for it.
---
Let me put it this way...when I get one of the Uber rare outfits I mentioned from an event I’ll be stoked...but I’m personally not comfortable trading for them.  Probably waaaay over careful, and I believe they are available in game, but it would be handy for Beth to say: here is a list of items we will ban you for having in your inventory 
---
You nuke the Red Rocket Mega Stop and all the trucks come alive like in Maximum Overdrive...
---
That's what happens in pretty much every online game
---
that explosive is getting a large nerf?  
---
Do you dispute that?  
---
I'm not invested in any specific outcome here, just pointing out the irony in the op finally finding what was the best suffix on the eve of it getting nerfed 80%... It turns out that irony is ironic! :)
---
The queen pumps out the babies, maybe the king guards the scorchbeast tunnels underground and so doesn't have wings and stuff. Enclosed fight underground with a mutant attack dog of a scorchbeast? Yes please.
---
Step 1:  Find wanted player.  
---
Step 2:  Kill wanted player 
---
I wish every nuke came with a guaranteed random boss fight or even two bosses working as team. That would be sick. 
---
But like I said, you choose to go with the lesser weapon class.  You got 9 Perk Cards for Melee but run with a knife you’re gonna do less damage.
---
yeah I call BS you don't even show you being killed in the video and as there has been a video disproving slap damage bobblehead stack on pacifist before... either A) you or your friend where wanted/had a workshop or B) since this on PC the guy had some form of hacking tools on to nullify pacifist
---
It's worth 6 caps each. You also need it to repair Ultracite-based items or restock Ultracite ammo for weapons using Prime receivers.
---
I though Nukes were going to be this really rare thing players would have to work towards. First time I emerged from Vault 76 there was a nuke warning telling me to evacuate the area. I was trying to get back in again in a panic before I realised it was aimed at the other end of the map.
---
Like a raid mission that would be sick
---
I mean realistically yeah but this is a video game. There needs to be balance. If pistol is going to be inherently weaker then it should be less taxing on your build
---
Ammo. I was burning all mine up making ammo. 
---
I sell to vendors for good amount of caps and keep 50ish for repairs 👍🏻
---
I sell them.
---
All i have is the ultracite PA  which is fully repaired. 
---
I respect being careful, I do a good amount of trading and do the same, but if your on PC, really want the outfits and have the time download FO76Edit and look in the ESM yourself, not that hard :)   
---
The MEGAFOX!
---
Does a helmet exist?
---
Is that mission about shooting down a drone for a nuclear key card? I never did the mission because I already shot them down a bunch of times already.
---
So yes it moves around quick but if you are able to see it on a map you should hopefully be able to see the direction it is going and try to fast travel ahead of it. If you cant do that they definatley fly all over the map and are constantly over the whitesprings so a backup plan would be to camp out and wait for it to come to you.
---
Once you are at the drone you will see it fly pass really quick but rather then you chasing it, make it come to you. So the drone is always escorted by 3 veribirds which are much easier to hit. Shoot one to get its attention and its name will turn ready and they will come to you to attack. Shoot them down and just stay in the area you are in and the cargo bot will just do circles around you. Dont worry if it flies away because it should wrap back around and come back.
---
Not sure what you mean by 'one shot' the thing though, those things take a lot of bullets to shoot it down unless you have an way over powered weapon so it's normal
---
If you have a weapons that you can use a scope on a shoot from a distance it works best. If you can, aim for each of its propellers individually until you see them explode and smoke. The cargo bots go through phases of flying up in the air or stopping in the same place for short amounts of time. Once all the propellers are blown up it is just a sitting duck you can fill it full of bullets and shoot it down.
---
Hopefully that helps otherwise I totally missed the question and spent a lot of timing typing in something completely different...
---
Yeah i am thinking of  of keeping the amount of ultracite to 50 like most junk
---
I am selling a set of calibrated shocks level 45 for the Excavator if anyone interested (PS4)
---
Please list the colours for me &lt;3
---
I will quite this stupid game now after all the hard work played more than 600+ and farming legend weapons they are going to nerf them from 100% to 20% i mean just throw the weapon away not worth even to keep it.. Still alot of bugs server crash every half hour.. My 3* legendary weapon disappear 3 time on me gone!! Its really not worth even try to play  🤮🤢
---
Just got that today at the Camden park vendor.
---
Also doesn't help that their's a volume slider specifically for footstep volume that I have turned all the way up... you can't hide for shit in pvp.
---
Travel ahead of it, you’ll never catch it running behind it. 
---
Once you see it, shoot for the engines. Shotguns with the enforcer perk are a good help here for the crippling effect. Once all 4 engines are crippled, it’ll stay put. 
---
Don’t cripple it too close to Top of the World though. Stupid bastard has gotten stuck on the roof every time I’ve done that. 
---
Same, even if it was just the display cases that they forgot to add in the game (even though you can buy the plans from vendors) 
---
Do you have the correct perk cards equipped?
---
Man, I was at a scorchbeast Queen fight today where she literally died after 10 seconds of fire from a handful of guys. TSEs are a problem. 
---
The lesser tax comes in weight and a few other special perks like movement speed.  It’s a specialty not an outright damage choice.
---
True I dont show the footage of the death itself so take the video for what it is. I can be straight up with you and say no neither of us were wanted and I did not attack the player to see what they're intentions were and died from the gun shot blast radius.
---
I’m guessing a duper trying to drop his cache of TSEs before he gets caught. 
---
workshops are contested pvp areas though
---
Lol, yeah someone definitely sold that one by accident.
---
So yes they are getting nerfed but they will be far from useless even after the nerf so if you use rifles its probably still a keeper.
---
I just drop mininukes at trainstation they are a pain to carry around

No offence, but you have zero proof of your claim, so for all we know you would be throwing their name under the buss for no reason.
---
Bro, test all you want, facts are facts. TSE is 6x damage if you have the demolitions perk. Bloodied caps at a 40% damage increase vs TSE 600%. Testing won't change that. If you get bloodied showing more damage than TSE then you manipulated it to.
---
I can only support everything you say!
---
Would be better if the vaults were spread out more.
---
You had me at minge 
---
i can swear on my life it is true, if you don't think it's true then you have nothing to worry about. i'm aware of what happen to me and if this was a lie trust me i wouldn't make such a big deal warning other plays of it.
---
YOU ARE THE MAN
---
Vendor Bot Phoenix in watoga. I find them often but it is random
---
I did not ask other players to go after this person, but this player is a known hacker and I'm only warning other players to stay clear and  not fall for any of their tricks.
---
Y'all make a good point they weigh a small communist child, but you never know when you can jip griefers into buying them. that said they'd prolly just nuke my shop with it
---
Are you running them solo? I've noticed that solo it almost never spawns anything, and as you add more players, you get more enemies.
---
no, as someone that does a vendor run every day I can tell you
---
* Vendors reset every 20 hours after being reduced to zero caps (must be to reset)
---
* sometimes they will glitch and you will have to buy something to make them update to 200 (can be anything buy the cheapest item or something you need)
---
* responder's, raider's, whitespring's, whitespring's bunker/Enclave, watoga station/grahm, watoga shopping plaza/BOS, Harper's ferry/Free States are the factions with separate caps (either look up fallout 76 map or you can tell the responder's and the raider's apart by the protectron and aesthetics of the station)
---
* vendor inventories are server specific and can be server hopped
---
 Like clockwork. :(
---
Are they funny?
---
It's  rude  to tease people like that and  not have the  courtesy to show your work.
---
This just happened to me... 1500 fusion cells... i simply fired it at a wall in my base to see what it was like...
---
1500 fucking cells gone.
---
ur proteins
---
can i haev them
---
Actually the Whitespring and Enclave (military wing) have a TON of telephones = circuits.
---
Upvoted to Morrowind.
---
It’s a shitton better than when it launched and I’m confident it’s going to get a shitton better than it is now.
---
I have resentment about this game, but it’s not about the 60 bucks I paid to preorder, it’s about the obvious failure of Bethesda to do the necessary play and server testing they should have done.
---
It’s worth it.
---
This needs to happen for the game to survive but more important is an end to the server crashes or an option to rejoin last server or these new unique nuke areas won’t matter a bit.
---
Trust me, you can't afford to use gun runner on a pistol build. There are too many better options in agility (action boy, adrenaline, white Knight, evasive, to name a few). It also doesn't stack with speed demon so it becomes null if you use that mutation. Which you should because it increase reload speed which is especially good for pistols. 
---
Weight is good and all but it doesn't help with dmg which is more important. Not to mention, there are plenty of other perks that can help with that. 
---
This camp is maddeningly close to a steel deposit
---
Yes it's playable right now. Cut the damage in half and a stealth vats build will be the only option. Personally I like to aim my gun and would prefer to continue to be able to. 10+ shots to kill a super mutant will not be playable in any fashion. 
---
Likely not in game yet as the Presidential suite is not accessible except by glitching. 
---
Wooo! Another one! You realize that the more attention you give the game even if its hate keeps the game in the talks and keeps people looking at it. IF you want this game to die, then stop talking about it. Drop it and never even look at it.
---
They just need to make it so that bobbleheads don't stack, make slap damage is a small static value or even 0 instead of a percentage and the issue is resolved.
---
I doubt they would even bother updating the model and animation to pick the other slots, though I could see them adding a pop-up menu to select.
---
Not sure if youre the one whi downvoted my comments but i was just trying to inform you. Whatever though. Not my problem.
---
I once bought a jetpack from a site (I didn't want to but my connection time is already in the minutes and server hopping for hours is not viable for me as I don't have the free time to do it), his inventory had millions of weapons junk and aid and the TSE weapons were only 30% of his weapons stock, the rest were different combos but mostly the bloodied and other mele effects. Hurting TSE still only destroys a very insegnificant part of their business.
---
Certain cards that is actually good for. I have rank 5 gunsmith for crafting, but rank 3 for when im running around. 
---
Has anyone ever come across T-51 Calibrated Shocks yet, I've had T-51 from level 160 and I'm now level 304, never seen them once. I've also never seen or heard of anyone finding them.
---
It would be nice to have even more traveling merchants like Grahm. We just need a wise-cracking ghoul and then an all-business deathclaw. They could all know each other 
---
You can do workshop events to try to get them.
---
Standard
---
This one hurts me.
---
I just want a weapon and armor rack and display tables....a fully decked out Armory would be nice.
---
My Camp would have a Crafting station a bed and 100 weapons and explosives.  That's all a real man needs lol.
---
Please make it so the game doesn't crash five times a session too 
---
His signature move is throwing you off of the top of a cage into an announcers table
---
Dupers have ruined the item's rarity and thereby invalidated the huge damage discrepency between TSE and everything else. Without rarity it has no reason to exist in it's current state. and if you played the game while duping was going on then you must have at some point realized that an official response to the influx of ultra rare duped items into the game's as well as real-world economy was inevitable. 
---
It should. But it doesn’t sadly. 
---
Should be either the 2nd or 3rd star of Travel Agent
---
It will do exactly as it does now, the damage is getting reduced, nothing about the behavior is changing. The way TS works is that it shoots 1 more projectile and splits the total damage dealt between all projectiles. So if you shoot a shotgun instead of 8 pellets at 100% damage it shoots 9 pellets at 200% damage, then split that % evenly between bullets. The 2nd bullet will do 62.5% damage on single shot weapons. Explosive is calculated on weapon damage, so it'll do 20% of 125% unless I've been misinformed.
---
It's not always about XP, it's about triggering legendary drops. They keep better stuff in their fat bloated bellies
---
Easter Egg:  If you send your dish of potatoes back four times in a row, the assaultron chef comes out and fries you to a crisp.
---
Yup, it will be soul crushing, but you can vendor hop Camden Park and Welch Station.  It will appear eventually.
---
I didn't think it even had an auto mod, it shoots pretty fast with standard
---
Yeah, or that
---
Sorry I’m a bit confused but where’s the 600% coming from? Also does this 600% show up on the Weapon if you were to inspect it or is this a situation like Brawler on a Fist Weapon (doesn’t show but adds the DMG)? 
---
Would take the fun out of it. I like build diversity, options to make unconventional builds work. if your left with just perk development you don't have much to work with. Even in it's current state you don't have much to work with compared to some other games, but those kind of games are far and few for me unfortunately. 
---
I gave your comment an upvote but I did see it's in the negative.
---
 I know you were being friendly and I noted your advice.
---
 I am sorry for those downvoting it, keep doing you friend and thank you for the heads up!
---
No it tracks everyones damage while you're doing damage. It only tracks while you're doing damage, yes, but it tracks all damage dealt.
---
Well considering this update isn't live yet of course you can nothing has changed yet. After this update low health/junkie and or a stealth vats build will be the only option and that will still suck. I'm not saying the explosive isn't OP nerfing explosive would be just fine. However nerfing TS when rifle base damage is like shooting a rubber bullet will make non vats rifle unplayable. Iv tested it and shooting 10+ rounds from a hunting rifle to kill a super mutant is what I would consider unplayable. 
---
the whitespring's camp vendor often has it
---
I enjoy the community more then the game it is part of
---
Just noticed after reading your topic 
---
You might have to get a mule or just make a new character that you can split resources between by running different builds.
---
Just need a beer now and your or one of those redneck hunters ;-)
---
Ok, ty
---
I just want to be able to decorate with junk. What's the point of shelves if we can't put toys, books, and other household items in them?
---
Old Possum*
---
Accidental scrapped mine yesterday.   Been farming tech data since with no luck.  :(
---
But did he die though
---
You missed my point.  If you were interested in damage you go with two handed Melee like Fire Axe or Two Handed gun like a Rifle.  If you don’t, if you choose to go one handed Melee (sword) or one handed gun (pistol) it must be for other reasons like lower weight or better speed (running or reloading).
---
Let’s go to the other end of spectrum and talk Sniper then.  You can sink a ton of points into that and while your single shot damage will be fantastic your overall damage output groups with a sniper rifle won’t compare to the standard rifles because of fire rate and reload speed.  It’s a specialty.
---
I’ve gotten medical goggles and bos hood.  Both from the ranger station in cranberry bog   The locked room with a terminal 
---
Player heads like Minecraft would be so cool.
---
Speaking of nukes, i hope they take some time to buff explosives Mini Nukes are already useless in the game, i have a two shot fatman and anti armor fatman currently fully specced in explosives, still weaker than my TSE harpoon gun in terms of dps lol. Those weapons should make a huge difference in battles but they dont.  I even have a two shot rocket launcher but that dps is weak too.  
---
I tried it with pistols on a non pistol toon (somerset vs normal 44). I also tried it via equipping and unequipping my armor pen perks.
---
Balance by nerf doesn't fix issues, it just makes it so no builds work. So right now you have 3 options, melee, which is awesome against anything that doesn't fly, TSE which works against everything, and everything else which doesn't really work. So lets nerf TSE so all we have is melee which doesn't work to well against flying stuff, in a game where the end boss flies. 
---
You can also get the Ultracite Gatling Laser Plan from the Event quests in the Bog like Surface to Air.
---
As for the items themselves, there are 2 distinct guns:
---
Gatling Laser
---
and
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser
---
Both of them can be fitted with a Prime receiver.  Each has its own sets of plans and mods you can attach.  They are not interchangeable.
---
It only seems lazy because there is no context. Depends on what reason these abominations exist, is there a good plot around them, or will they just be plopped into the game with no reasoning.
---
Not that I'm aware of. Most people I see wearing the uniform (myself included) wear the welding mask since it matches the motif of the outfit pretty good.
---
&gt; Weapon balancing should have happened before the full launch
---
They told us they didnt know how and were going to work on it the months/years after launch. Thats part of what we signed up for
---
&gt;don't matter how you or I feel about it
---
Disagree, theyve been very active at responding and listening to the community
---
if all you had to do in game was farm tse weapons so you could one shot stuff, and now youre upset that theyre taking your broken toys away... well then I cant say I have a ton of sympathy to be honest
---
1. You were trying to trade for a Tattered Field Jacket an hour ago.
---
2. You are replying to yourself.
---
Ahhh yes, the glories of FO76's current state.
---
I gave a level 6 some gear in Flatwoods and then I had a pack of level &lt;10s chasing me.
---
Yup, sad, but true.  I have a bunch of Ultracite .45 I have no gun to use with.  Had to go back and craft Ultracite .44 to use the Prime Lever Action.
---
I didn't say it was a bad move, chief, just that pve suffers at the hands of pvp. 
---
Not really. Those items are all stacked. Giving us more stash side gives us the opportunity to have more unique items. That being said, I have hundreds of unique notes and shit so I dunno if that actually matters or if people have just decided that it does. Which is really common with this game. 
---
I claimed a bounty off of a guy, and I was going to let him get his loot back but he was trash talking me. Took his junk and he had tons of screws, gears, springs and nuclear material.
---
Queen takes dmg from Explosive. She's been getting one shotted by it currently.... 
---
The 600% comes from off the top of my head math. Explosion adds 100% weapon damage in the explosion. TS adds 100% weapon damage. Demolition doubles explosion damage. 200% explosion x 2 = 400% and ts is 200%. 
---
I know it's not accurate and ultimately TSE is actually higher because explosion damage is calculated from weapon damage, so really it calculates post TS 100% damage increase. It was just an off the cuff statement from not having put much thought into it.
---
Yea, I tried New Gad the other day. Mostly got a bunch of glowing mongrels and some Super Mutant Overlords (warlords? Both?).  Was very meh. 
---
Picked up a TS missile launcher this morning. Says it only does 320, with maxed demo expert.
---
West Tek has been spawning a 2 or 3 star every server jump. Whitesprings just gives shit armor and rolling pins/golf clubs  majority of the time. 
---
Why do we need fucking settlements in Fallout anyways? I'd rather play 76 without building
---
Eh. The first wave of bans was for youtubers and also people that accessed the dev room
---
I have seen plenty of screens out the ridiculous carry weights some dupers get to.... in the millions. With thousands of weapons.
---
Phase 2 could be banning people with excessive duped items. I'm not talking about someone with 50,000 steel on a mule. I get that there are hoarders of that type. I'm talking about people with improbable amount of ultra rare items
---
I don't think 1200 is too much. We already have 3000 STASH (5 characters per account). It just is not easy to access this, and require a lot of hard work.
---
I said 1200 since I can see it being a place for components to be stored to free up a characters main STASH.  1200 would be shared between all characters on the account. I do believe that when crafting the game should withdraw from the characters inventory first, character Stash second and finally the Account wide Stash. It should never access another account characters main Stash.
---
I still feel it's a good compromise between what we currently have, and all the people asking for unlimited STASH. 5 characters per account that is 3000 plus 1200 is 4200 account wide possible STASH should be enough to shut most people up.
---
Lol but you know some people will always want more.
---
PS4: Couple of issues:
---
1: Ok, may I suggest some sort of internal timer preventing enemies respawning until that timer hits 0? 5 minutes sounds nice to at least give someone time do what they want to, 10 minutes maximum because as it stands I just had to clear the SAME location 4 times in the same server because the game respawned EVERYTHING right on top of me.
---
There also was no one else in the immediate area so I don’t think that caused it.
---
I even saw the boss Super Mutant I just killed literally 10 seconds prior start shooting me in the back as he respawned which had me waste even more resources on my character. What’s worse is he had a rocket launcher so... He hurt!
---
2: Sometimes, if the server hasn’t loaded in for you that a door is closed, enemies can and will see you through an apparently closed door, even being able to shoot you while you physically cannot retaliate until YOU open the door.
---
As I mostly play stealth builds, this can get frustrating as normally I’m pretty squishy, especially early on where this just happened to me.
---
Side comment: as for the TSE nerfs, I don’t have one myself but, how about making two shot 50% weaker instead, or 25% weaker instead of 75%? After all the real busted part is that each bullet from a TSE weapon benefits from the explosive effect and from the perk card.
---
As a result, may I suggest instead making the Explosive effect only benefit 1 projectile instead of them all? That would VASTLY depower it while still being a semi decent weapon. 
---
As for shotguns, turn them into a single shot slug with the effect to stop that insane ‘Nuke’ that happens from all the exploding pellets?
---
Ground zero would be just not having the explosive effect being boostable by perk cards but even that sounds stupid to me.
---
Pretty good today but yesterday had 4 or 5 in an hour, frustrating.
---
Any experience on their functionality?  I would guess a prime 3* legendary GatLaser would have more umph than a crafted prime Ultracite Gatling Laser.  I haven’t messed with the big guns much and am pretty sure I have learned the prime receiver plans for both (without the Ultracite GL plans I have no way to know for sure)....but disappointed to learn the Ultracite won’t drop as a legendary 
---
My brother said the same thing. We finally got time to launch my first nuke in a team and he was surprised at how many robots we got, he said he'd solod about half a dozen silos and hardly got any robots after the initial spawns. 
---
Okay, so your "friend" is you, and you're butthurt.  How can I tell?  You're making all the usual rationales and excuses cheaters have done since people started playing online games that could be cheated.
---
This is consequence and it's a direct result of your actions.  Learn from this, now, or you're going to be learning this lesson, over and over again.
---
It should have an option that when you pick it up you can send it to your camp storage so that way it would be similar to putting a plant down or a lamp. Since it would take up storage you wouldn’t have to worry about people overloading on top of their already full bases.
---
100 is all you really need, if you have to swap back and forth a few times oh well the goal isn't to make it so you can swap your entire stash in one shot, its so you can move stuff reliably. if stash size affects server stability then I'd even be ok with my stash being only 500 and 100 shared, I can make more alts. 
---
It is a cut content, there’s a whole Zetan event locked in the files. I don’t know if it was cut or something to be implemented in the future, but it was basically just an event to farm alien blaster ammo
---
Asymmetrical PvP mode. Players have to perform tasks in an area in a time limit while one opposing player has to do tasks to launch a nuke in said area.
---
Thanks.  I found a list of alll the events/daily/mic. and have been trying to do them all.  'Race for the Presidency' is the event, but I've never seen it.
---
It also lists 'Barnyard Brawl', 'Super Mutant Invasion', 'The Battle That Never Was', 'Dogwood Die Off; 'A Mine of Her Own' and 'A Habitat for Beasts'.  
---
Working on a new character that's unarmed and pretty much designed with extremely high explosive resist and the ability to one shot pop people for explosive weapon users.
---
K.  The way you phrased it combined with all the people proclaiming that explosive is going to be useless post-nerf just kind of led me to believe that's what you were implying.  My bad.
---
Came here to say this, I know it's not ideal but it works for now.
---
Perhaps have some manner of Vault-Tec themed mission where this is the reward?  Could be coupled with the eventual opening of the vaults, as a resident of 76 (thereby the best and brightest Vault-Tec “saved”) you become an ambassador to the other vaults, giving you free fast travel to them.
---
Yup...and that got me thinking, and here we are  
---
I think they stealth changed this and didn't tell anyone. Saw a youtube video made the other day where it seemed like they fixed this. Have to try it myself to verify though.
---
All we would need is a case for specific items; its basically just a skin as you add items after that. Toys, Bears, Magazine Rack, etc. A decent amount of work but very doable and wont hurt the server. 
---
Usually when approaching people lower lvl than me I just repeat friendly over and over again on the in game mic. I usually start with something like man let’s update your wardrobe give them some article of clothing then, if they take they I’ll give them other things if not there lost
---
I think that deserves its own post. I'm not sure how it would work unless selecting a target several minutes before launch.
---
You are 100% right. 
---
The trick is a properly specced melee *can* output a lot of damage quickly. Someone just a few days ago posted an institgating sledge that did over 1000 Dmg. On the first hit of a fresh enemy, that's over 2000 Dmg. Throw in the ignore 50% armour, and you get the idea.
---
The second benefit is no ammo cost, with similar perks to affect the rate of decay of the weapon and armour.
---
Tragic.
---
Absolutely
---
1) That's similiar to real life
---
2) Find a good medium
---
3) You just have to stand there like a moron and wait for the loot to load. Sometimes when it displays empty, you have to wait for it to place. If you wait so long that her body disappears, that means she has changed from a body into a meat pile. If you find her meat pile, you can loot it. It's very hard and it's usually located at the place she died - not where the body was placed upon death.
---
The spread can be useful on a fatman, effectively increasing the total size of the explosion, albeit the second shot is pretty wild. I know this from seeing in slowmo VATS in fallout 4. Two mini nukes would come out, one where you wanted, the other at a random forward angle.  The random factor, at least with this weapon, i thought was pretty fun. 
---
I was trying to get it as close as I could to my own likeness.. But I ended up with danse 😂 Bethesda character creator is hard lol
---
*Todd Howard:*
---
Shit fam u want a job as head of fallout 76?
---
It was my very first attempt.
---
I think you're missing the point here. There is no significant advantage that the pistol has which the rifle doesn't. Rifle can have a great reload speed, bigger mag, a perk for armor penetration, more damage, and the same run speed. The weight of our weapons is not a good trade-off especially when there are so many good options for reducing weight. 
---
cleanse the mutants
---
Because thats what they have been doing since launch, instead of fixing things for balance they nerf so nothing works. 
---
I’ve seen them every so often with the vendor bot @ Harper’s ferry.
---
Then how my 500 dmg super slege do more dmg than my anti armor compat shotgun full mod with 1500 dmg ??? 
---
Sure can! I spent hours searching for the fabled BOS hood and it matches this suit perfectly, 10/10 time well spent 😂
---
its me, chickenfrieddeep, i dont use bobbleheads
---
thanks for the junk
---
Very helpful! I was confused with the lack of menu option to lock the terminal. Came in handy when a guy kept changing munitions factory!
---
 to the company store 
---
I was in the lobby, I fought Chickenfrieddeep, he killed me a few times but I was able to kill him. Hes using sentinel / with assassin or vanguard and an explosive shotgun with stagger, an annoying combo to be sure but not a cheater. I run sentinel as well, and it took him a minute to kill me, if he was using a bobblehead exploit he would have easily killed me in one shot regardless of my build.
---
TL;DR OP is a liar and part of the problem with this community.
---
Wish I could trade for a two shot Gatling plasma, but I'm sure it's garbage.
---
I still enjoy the game because my friends play and its fun. It could be better, but right now its entertaining so I play. 
---
So you think it was a wise decision by Rockstar, skipper?
---
instant loss of thirst or hunger would make for two dif effects making for interesting strategy also making cards like philanthropy suddenly super raid worthy for builds.
---
I had to use a third-party program so 76 can run without me getting [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) login screen with the overlay. But I'm not asking what you use, I'm asking for those who have Discord to help me solve why it doesn't work.
---
Sorry.
---
haha, thinking that bethesda would add interesting content to the game. so naive
---
Now this is here is what a smart shill does. No, the lesson here is not to buy from the grey market with a "shield" like you are trying to make it, the lesson is don't buy from these thugs at all.
---
Sorry, I wasn't aware of that.  I think we all just assumed that nuking other areas would have a purpose, and after nuking a different location for myself where nothing interesting happened, I also saw in his videos that he hasn't found anything of note either.
---
Pipe weapons really strong when you combine gunslinger and rifleman perks 
---
Only if there's a lot of them
---
Watoga Super Duper.
---
Yeah, and it also makes them easy to find in a database. Bethesda may have been slow in dealing with this bullshit but at least they're making an effort now. I don't know what comes next. Another exploit? More bans? Bans on people with millions of weapons? Turning a blind eye? We'll just have to see what happens. 
---
I don't think it was a decision of rocstars at all, champ, but a directive from their profit minded publishers. 
---
are you 100% sure it's 2 shot weapons that are "massively overpowered"?  I'm honestly not trying to be combative, but  can you provide actual examples and data to support that?  
---
As far as I can see 2 shot alone is not remotely op.  The only case for 2 shot being op is maybe at the extreme upper end of weapons like fat man, dragon, maybe gauss/ black powder but even in those cases the weapons are limited by super low rof, high recoil, poor accuracy, lack of decent mods, and other factors never mind they can already 1 or 2 shot players in pvp and most mobs in pve even without 2 shot.  
---
2 shot combined with explosive I feel is op, and explosive alone is op, and shotguns with explosive is especially op.  But 2 shot all by itself?  no, not really op given it's less accurate than base weapons and in over 95% of the cases it just boosts weapons that otherwise are useless into the same category as useful guns.
---
3 perk cards for -36% armor. Thats less than half of what melee does with no perks. My friend can one shot mobs with non-god mode melee weapons that i can't one shot with a tse lever action and I'm specced into rifles. And he doesn't kill himself when mobs get 10 feet away. 
---
I like checking out random bases, if a low level owner stops by I drop them 20 diluted stims.
---
OP framing it as mutually exlusive doesn't ring true with me either.
---
I want a combination of the Skyrim levelling system and the New Vegas levelling system. 
---
Dude 
---
Nuclear mothman
---
Nuclear crab thing (forgot name)
---
Plz Bethesda
---
it will probably be a while or people will bitch about marking it as "limited"
---
I nuked mononagh and morgantown yesterday, both were a waste of time
---
Community manager mentioned that that the devs were made aware and looking into it.
---
Try it with wave splitter.. A scorched guy killed me in legit 0.9 seconds with it
---
I have a windmill that's just there for decoration. After about 20 minutes in my camp it always breaks for no reason.
---
Super rare. Almost as rare as the T60 jetpack plans. 
---
could be, should be 
---
but my money is on the cheapest option for bethesda, big words, zero cost
---
banning these dupers would be expensive for a title that I would wager is hemorrhaging in more ways than one
---
lets wait a few days and see who is right, if the dupers aren't gone by the tse patch it will already be too late
---
but truly, it was too late when they let dupers have there way for a month
---
I've gotten my money's worth, and as long as we get more players I wouldn't mind. I'd be easier to convince my friends to tag along anyways.
---
SIX TURRETS? That's like a third of your budget!
---
Also found this plan at Camden park vendor.
---
I nuked it with scorched there yesterday, and guess what was there.... Higher level scorched. About ten of them. Nothing else
---
It doesn't all weigh more. A couple things like lead and aluminum weigh less. Unless they changed it. 
---
The only things you should be bulking are aluminium and lead, unless you are immediately going to sell it. Don't waste your time or plastic on anything else. Also you cannot bulk a few select items, they sell directly to merchants, like circuits, nuclear material, silver, gold, asbestos, fiberglass, and a few more. You shouldn't be keeping more than even 100 of those specifically, and I'm happy with 80. You obviously need to work on your possessiveness game, padawan.
---
And don't switch over your entire build for a non-legendary gauss rifle, especially if you aren't REALLY into sniping. And don't even keep any non-legendary weapons in your stash. Let go, Luke.
---
I spent $200 :(
---
True. A damn shame I missed it the first time
---
That's true........
---
Lol price. 5 caps. You make a shitload for cheap with ammosmith and super duper. I toss them regularly and I keep 2 incase I see something worth bombing with the instigating fatman.

I ran some tests with dropped items and how long they stay in the world: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/aaguu9/the_science_of_fallout_76_experiment_1_how_long/?st=JR4NFB19&amp;sh=bfba1ade

no, it isn't a never ending cycle. Eventually stuff is mostly balanced, and the big changes stop happening.

If this is upsetting, quite for the next year, and then come back.

yup.

Whaaat. I'm level 40 and had no ideas there's chainsaws in this game.
---
Have a pic of weapon I though 40% swing speed was 2nd tier while furious first? But could be wrong? 
---
Don’t know man. I can’t run servers. I’m sure that will cause some animosity with the 2 or 3 employees that know how. 
---
Bethesda has seriously misunderstood it's fanbase with the atom shop. They're trying to be like fortnite
---
There was two raider facepaints of many that were added in the first item leak have been waiting ever since for them
---
Inspect the item to see all the effects. Don't trust the summary it shows when the item's highlighted in inventory.
---
Faster swing speed is a secondary effect. You won't find it on its own without a 1st effect.

I’d play with him a bit ;) definetly a duper have a bit of fun and then drop his loot down a ultracite hole :D

duping or a extreme hording problem, he needs to let that stuff go.

I would love to see a unique boss for each fissure site you can nuke, and even hidden ones in other sites that arent fissures. Heres some ideas for nuke site bosses:
---
***unique irradiated Behemoth that throws barrels of toxic nuclear waste.
---
***A legendary glowing, giant and pissed off 
---
Mothman.
---
***A giant glowing mutated FEV monstrosity like a giant snallygaster or something even more grotesque.
---
***An even bigger and tougher Grafton Monster
---
***A Kraken-like giant Octopus/squid thing in the mire or cranberry bog
---
***A giant strangler or colossal carnivorous plant that has multiple parts you have to kill to take out the whole thing.
---
***Scorched in power armor with energy and heavy guns (50 cal, minigun, plasma guns, gatling plasma, LMG, or even a fatman) who were former BOS/Enclave or something that crawl their way out of a fissure.
---
***An experimental pre war Battle Robot similar to Liberty Prime that activates when a nuclear launch is detected.
---
***a 'ghoulified' type of giant monster/animal
---
***a swarm of Wendigos that have awaken from their underground lair from a nuclear blast, perhaps led by a unique Wendigo called 'The Rake' who continues to stalk you after your first encounter with it.
---
***a giant and mutated Mirelurk King/Queen duo fight.
---
Dump the shit into a river somewhere and jump servers

Watoga highschool, or Morgantown highschool. There is all the plastic you will need.
---
If he had that much junk on him it most definitely wasnt legit. If he had 10 or more of each item it was not legit. If he has so much junk you cant walk properly thats his fault for not stowing it away.
---
I know that isn't the first time this sub have this idea, but I just like it so much... A Chinese battle robot in Morgantown, that appear when nuked. It's reasonable that communist forces have a counterpart for Liberty Prime, obiouvsly not tall or powerfull as him. I find that maybe a good design would be the robot shown in anti-Chinese posters that are all around military and police posts. I also think it should have some Sputnik-influenced design and be red or light blue like Liberators, which could deploy in battle  (high level liberators). And If the first that had this idea is reading this comment, please comment again, i wanna hear you!
---
Maybe mind your own fucking business? 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Because the game needs a lot of rebalancing to having interesting and fulfilling build mechanics. This is a positive showing that they are willing to change things perceived as broken. Melee nerfs may follow and we will get a more fulfilling experience that allows players to make the builds they want.
---
The disruption of RMT economy is another bonus.
---
The bobbleheads and magazines will be fixed soon as well. They are clearly not working as intended.
---
On Xbox, I regularly see friendly players from low levels to high levels, I’m even one myself. I once met a lvl 113 just show to my workshop and give me some plans. 
---
Can you elaborate on why banning dupers would be expensive?
---
I'm level 40 and haven't even been to the Toxic Valley or Ash Heap.
---
I didn't even consider that as I haven't played with any explosive weapons yet. Good point.
---
MP game balance is usually neverending. And that is a good thing, it keeps the game fresh.
---
I play without VATS. I play without any legendary weapon. Easy peasy.
---
Recognising and ratifying their mistakes? Wow, such danger.
---
Right? Like I was imagining how cool it'd be if those were just the little dudes that took over the bigger ones and buffed them. Could be part of a larger plot involving the commies. 
---
Yeah... The game even warns you so you know exactly what you're getting into when you claim a workshop.
---
You uh...you gonna use that sledge and pitchfork
---
Or just balance PvP so it's actually fun for both sides involved.
---
Even with the exploits, at last check  we no record of a player being killed through slap damage. Community is all too ready to cry wolf when it's just another player playing differently than them. 
---
Nope, do the math. This has been tested and debunked, only lead and aluminum save weight when bulked.
---
Good video of a guy taking out a scorchbeast with a lvl1 pipe rifle with a vats sneak build, it did surprisingly well.
---
Sad life
---
And what about the Fisher Hat that increase damage on all the Mirelurk?
---
Well 10 or more is a bit low. After visiting Sugar Grove you come out wity about 30 clipboards.
---
yea, but what would i name my 27th power armor???
---
[VATS two shot fatman in fo4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPZ_qMQAkYI)
---
Of each. Not stuff like that. I mean rare junk. Like who carries around flux? Who cares around 200 screws springs and gears? 
---
I mean to suggest the addition of bosses as tough as the queen, but for other locations. 
---
Maybe you have an annoying voice?
---
Drop it in a lake dude and forget about hunting dupers. Ban waves are getting people left and right. Who knows how they identify them. Wouldn't want you to catch a ban for having all those items on hand. As for the dude, he was dumb for being 2k over-encumbered either way. He always ran the risk of losing everything.
---
Honestly the way i see it, duper or no, carrying lots of junk is a bad idea
---
They need a system for turning junk into placable decorations.
---
I bounce back and forth between good and evil. I’ve got no qualms about baiting someone into PvP, but at the same time I’m liable to leave crap in your bag after I kill you, especially if you’re a lot lower level.  I usually hit every bounty I see.  I’ve teamed with low level guys to use them as bait too. I really enjoy this because they often get a hell of a kick out of causing chaos in the game and will got out of their way to initiate PvP. It’s quite entertaining.  Gave a lvl10 a handful of orbitals. He went power crazy and wracked up a big bounty quick. 
---
I’m more than happy to help lower level guys launch their first nuke or help in a blast zone.  Stumbled upon a destroyed camp?  If I’ve got the mats I’ll fix a few things before wandering off. Come to my camp?  Benches and stashes publicly available on the porch, but the house is locked. 
---
I see your point. 
---
Tbh if I found a lootbag with 200 gears and screws I'd take it. Otherwise I might dispose of the junk.
---
Does this have it's own post? I think it's a great idea.
---

---
Great comment. 
---
Thank you for breaking it down. 
---
A giant one with a tugboat for a shell!
---
they can detect massive quantities of items, and warned every duper of it
---
if I were duping I would drop all my items and keep smaller quantities of weapons
---
I think the warning was really a dead giveaway of their intentions, why warn instead of just banning. They want to manipulate behavior not actually ban customers.
---
No point speculating about shit we'll never know, junior. 
---
There is no significant advantage that a one handed Melee has which a two handed doesn’t.  Two handed Melee can have great attack speed (buzz blade) with only Advantage being weight and rifles don’t have weight reduction.  (Legendary?)
---
Each player doesn't have 3000 stash active on the server simultaneously, they have 600.  Server resources aren't being used on characters that are offline.  They're merely being stored in a database then loaded onto the server with your character when you log in.  The issue Bethesda has stated is server stability, not storage capacity.
---
"I said 1200 since I can see it being a place for components to be stored to free up a characters main STASH."
---
Then you'd really just be using it as a second stash, not as a means to transfer items.  At that point, you may as well just ask for the stash to be increased to 1k and to add a 100-200 wt transfer stash.  The entire point of the transfer stash is to...transfer, not use it as a massive second storage.
---
I definitely wouldn't argue against getting more storage, but 1200 isn't realistic imo and isn't even really necessary.  If too many items actively loaded on the server causes problems, then it isn't practical to triple the amount of items everyone can load in with.  It also seems kind of weird to ask for a transfer stash that's twice the size of the current personal stash.  Many (most?) people only have one character, maybe 2 anyway.
---
We'll see how things go once duped items start getting cleared up.  That may make it possible to increase storage, but at any rate, having a transfer stash larger than the personal stash just seems excessive and to defeat the purpose of a transfer stash, since once you transfer the majority of loot you wish to transfer, it will just end up as a second source of permanent storage anyway.
---
Then stat boosting gear should increase them.
---
I only have 2. If you’re interested I’ll sell them to you both for 600 caps.
---
Loool
---
I'm gonna do it, this Idea won't die in the comment section! Thank you!
---
10 is pretty low. I’d say look out for a bunch of even numbers or powers of 2. Guys got 1024 or 2000 (on the nose) circuits in his bag?  Obvious duper.  If there’s multiple stacks all at the same amount, obvious duper.  If there’s multiple stacks all with different, but nice rounded numbers (like 100, 200, 300) pretty obvious. 
---
I have found guys with huge amounts of junk on them. Collected a bounty on a guy who was carrying 400lb of crap. He was not a duper. The amounts were all random, as if he’d just never bothered to hit a stash box. 
---
Are you coming off as needy? Ive had lots of friendly encounters. Don't ask for anything and play respectfully and you might be supersized. The community is mostly soft compared to other games.

Reading this in the middle of the night, saw this come up in my feed. Initially thought it was a Trump post.
---
I learned about 8 serums recipes, can sell yoy one if you want btw
---
Yes, let’s find a way to make the game less enjoyable. 
---
Found also in patrol duty event 
---
Extreme quantities of a given item are the red flag it sounds like.  Take a few of whatever you need, stash them and all your desirable junk, then walk into a fissure. 
---
i picked that door for the first time about 4 hours ago
---
I doubt they will invest the time to develop these features when we can already tame so many.  Also, we can have a brahmin.  We'll see I suppose.
---
I only have 2. If you’re interested I’ll sell them to you both for 500 caps
---
I filled my tub with bones. 
---
Only if it only works when both players have consented to PvP.  Too much potential for griefing otherwise.
---
Literally unplayable 
---
Only the 5th time it's been posted.
---
But could you imagine great environmental story telling WITH quirky, memorable human NPCs? 
---
And because of the virus they would be the toughest, meanest sonuvabitches around. 
---
For me personally, I'm not invested in the quests because I know that everyone has JUST died. 
---
And seeing another player in the world doesn't really feel special at all. Most of the time just get a wave and then they go on their way. 
---
No. Please no. Pipe Weapons need to die off. They are a cheap way of implementing low level weapons and they clog up the loot pool later on.
---
It’s time to **STOP!**
---
Steep. But I suppose can live with that. When's a good time for you?
---
Blind invites are something people avoid accepting these days. They are a method for griefing and besides, it's not really polite. It's like cold calling to me.
---
You would have better luck trying to voice or emote tbh.
---
Speaking of voice, I use it all the time but you have to be sure you are actually transmitting. It is setup weird. Auto you would think would be best but it has trouble deciding what you want. Best to stick to area until you group and then either go to group or stay in area.
---
Personally, I stay in area. It's more convenient. I'm not saying anything that could destabilise any democracy. lol
---
You will get emotes back 50% of the time, ignored and frightened people 40% but the rest will answer even if it is just "hello". 
---
PC is very friendly compared to other platforms.
---
As for The Whitespring. .. well that's just something we will have to deal with. It will take a while to fizzle out from the hive mind. The net never forgets and stupid can't think for themselves.
---
Cut content is prepended by CUT. Even that is not a guarantee of CUT content, they can still release what they want when they want, which is why i always say that what i see is no guarantee of it coming out, but dont just assume cut because its not in the game currently.
---
Yeah, so guys with runaway effects can equip dozens of more perk cards.  
---
There’s a reason temporary changes (which a mutation is) don’t effect perks.  
---
Nope! Chuck Testa
---
Imagine what the coding looks like (Only kidding different department) 
---
I got mine from a treasure map. 
---
Ive waited for my friends to disconnect from the server up to 15 minutes after they turned off their XBox and went to sleep. So i could take ownership of the workshop they had control of.
---
you literally see them (Offline) in the social menu and the status screen for Xbox shows they are offline, yet they still own the workshop and are failing the quest i didnt see trigger.
---
you cant tell me there is no way to just route the player to the last server they were on unless it was full or if they were join a friend or the server is down. 
---
I still want a suit made of prewar money(since we get both from them) 
---
Jeez I might have been playing this game wrong all along!
---
You can upgrade unique weapons? As in upgrade the level of Legendary weapons? 
---
I may be 3 days late on this, but the Overseer’s mission is bugged. I’ve reached out to Bethesda support about the quest not completing and they confirmed that they are aware of the bug and are working on it.
---
Damn dude, I have the plans and the flux. I bought like 200 violet off this guy for 1cap each so I could put these shocks on my friends Ultracite, I woulda helped you out for free. 
---
Well put, Comrade!
---
You are one fartslashing cosmic clashing extraterrestrial crashing little spaceman!!!
---
Any critters around. I have had the game refuse to place my Camp due to animals in the area. 
---
Just a thought. 
---
I've noticed that ever since they introduced push to talk that player interaction has decreased severely.  It's too bad too.
---

---

---
While we’re on this subject, anyone else having technical data spawns directly at their feet sometimes?  I presume it’s from having more than one in my inventory but haven’t bothered to check. Can’t be picked up. 
---
Level 112 here, would love to help you as you explore! GT ActualGarbage68
---
Could easily be duped material, could also easily be that guys legit junk. 
---
You ask yourself, was this a bunch of stacks of junk all at 800 or 1200 for example like you could almost see the manipulation? Or was it all random numbers? 233 of this, 1536 of that, 745 of this, etc? 
---
I ask cuz if it’s an flat 800 of each across the board it might be duped, it also might be a bundle some player paid caps to another for. In the event the numbers were completely inconsistent I’d maybe guess certainly killed a legit player as I have accumulated over 5000 pounds of junk saved on my alt accounts mule and my averages per junk item are all over the place.
---
They arent being ignored they are working on them, be patient. There is another update end of this month with another wack of bug fixes.  
---
We out here thinking of new cards and travel to other vaults for free is the best you can come up with? 
---
How about: 
---
fearless perk- fast travel when enemies are near at a higher cost 
---
Bodybuilder perk- fast travel when over encumbered at a higher cost
---
Bounty Hunter perk- up to 2x the payout for killing wanted players 
---
These are a few that came off the top of my head
---
don’t give it back that’s def not legit.
---
While it's in your carry inventory.
---
If you place it in your stash, that icon goes away until it is deployed again.
---
Quiet you!
---
There is a light hardwood floor and dark wood floor on the Atom shop.
---
Those two would make a beautiful chess board if you wanted to upgrade a small bit.
---
Nice work though!
---
How about a "I'm only wanted because some ghouls that were chasing me ran behind another players wall, and I couldn't stop firing fast enough," Emote?
---
What would you do?
---
Personally, I wouldn't risk it. I have way too much to lose over some scrap. But you might be right from the reports I've seen
---
I will add you tomorrow [ won’t forget ] sounds awesome can’t wait to play man about to head to bed, thanks dude! Look forward
---
Ah yes ofcourse :-)
---
if only. lul
---
Yeah, I definitely want to upgrade this! I still haven't got a lot of plans and blew all my atoms on emotes. 🙁😂
---
What us the motivation to grind 3 star legendary mobs then? Why bother playing at all if there will be no progression.
---
I didn’t see any when I did look around. This is in a normal spot too, still in the green zone even. It’s rather annoying. 
---
I want to be able to put my tse on a wall plaque to remind me of the good time
---
0w0
---
Nice! Account created! 
---
Its a graphical glitch, you think you have enough because the game says so, but you actually dont. Its a stupid bug. You actually need a lot more junk than the game says a lot of the time. 
---
This is one of the reasons I haven’t even bothered making a camp. Being able to display my stuff is a big part of having a place to come back to after a long journey out. I want to open that door and see my bed covered in sweet rolls, my pool table full of 8-balls, and my bathtub overflowing with teddy bears. 
---
I do wonder how they would handle this when people can nuke or otherwise destroy your camp though.
---
I never get a single legendary at harpers...
---
Keep what I want drop the rest.
---
My biggest gripe on melee is Incisor.  No other weapon class gets to ignore 75% based on perks alone, before even adding mods and legendary effects. 
---
Rifles get 36 via Tank Killer
---
Heavies get 45 with Stabilized, but only in PA
---
Shotguns get nothing from perks
---
My son and I were playing last night, farming legendaries in Watoga.
---
We saw a level 13 running around, getting chased by bots.
---
While we didn't invite him to the team, we let him know he could hang with us and get some shot off to get the legendary rewards.  We would help him when he was downed.
---
I don't team up with anybody but him, but I will chat and help other players.
---
If you see me out there, I'm always willing to help .
---
PC, DemonTwoBravo.
---
 I feel like at level 30 leaving you stuff is an insult as I’d expect ya to know what ya doing at that point. And when ever I encounter I lower level player they run away anyway
---
Weird question, but are you using a PA targeting helmet?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w\_wmv8K6x1I
---
Nope
---
I don’t get why people are so annoying and hating on this game still....i finally got it for xmas and i’m happy. So Just piss off with ur circle jerk and let us play it’s fun and pretty
---
The target marking lasts forever unless you put the gun away or switch weapons.
---
I’ve tried this mission last weekend and I got disconnected from the server 3 times, tried again this weekend and disconnected 4 times.
---
Fu**, I don’t have barely any time to play and when finally get some, this happens, it is really frustrating.
---
And the worst part is that I lost all the progress on the mission but I don’t recover all the ammo used on it.
---
That looks awesome man!
---
It's not just Mega Sloths - after being hit with this bug, I've nailed it down to my missing Radtoad.
---
I rolled up a commando, and for every nuke zone I spend time in, I then spend 2 days reproducing my spent ammo.
---
thats what a lot of xbox players do its 50/50 either innocent or a trap.
---
O.o Where on the internet did you read that o.O
---
Ok - I searched. didn't see anything. chill 
---
Personally I'd prefer if the beer hat extended the drunk buff. Chugging a whole bottle of vodka and only staying drunk for 2-3 minutes is annoying.

---

---
I don’t come off as needy.

Give me a Mohawk dammit... how the hell can you have a raider with out a mo hawk.
---
one of my biggest regrets of this spot was that i couldnt get the steel deposit and the rock in the same build zone. camera mode wont activate when i'm sitting on the couch and i'd love to drop a chair next to them for a picture
---
This is a video game though, not real life. You probably hate gta and other similar games for this too?
---
"Put the [Techncial](https://imgur.com/faREmX6) Data in a Brotherhood Cache"
---

---
They have those beer drinking hats...will that do?
---
player factions are sorta pointless, you need in game factions that are tied to lore, you can be a powder boy that means your still a raider. 
---
Or add new items that can be created using specific components  
---
e.g.: if u want a display case with robot-models o teddy bears you have to build it with 5 different bears/robot models + wood  
---
well, the area is meant for level 20-35 so it makes sense in a way however as others replies mention when in doubt server hop a bit to see if you can find a little bit of a balance.
---

---
Its not dead , not for me. But i had to when you wrote ”dont say its a dead meme”
---
Please forgive me :)
---
Just got to find a good combination of legionaries..
---
Never had that happen.  It's probably some sort of bug.
---
I have had a bug where I took damage during a fight with an enemy (*mongrel*) and just kept taking damage after it died.  No special damage, just physical. It killed me and when I respawned, it kept happening.
---
 I had to log out and back in to get it to stop.
---
Seriously.
---
kinky
---
The Game consists of 50% Stash managing, 25% Perk Card Switching, 20% relogging, because disco or Vendor Jumping and 5% actual Gameplay.
---
(The Gameplay part is either Whitespring Farming or Queen killing after a certain Level.)
---
Or when you zoom on the chassis you can see the components of PA. For weapons if you want to see the mod you can zoom on them and read. 
---
It exists. All PA plans are super rare.
---
Thanks, I hate it!
---
Yeah not pointless, it gives that exp sucka!
---
Looks like the dupers are sell some stock for caps. 
---
I read all your post and i can see what you are saying. I just hope Bethesda will finish that weapon balance because a lot of it is still lacking. If we are talking about bringing TSE weapons down to make others viable then Laser weapons need a significant boost. Melee even with it's distance drawbacks still need a tiny slight nerf and unnarmed weapons should be able to work with power armor as they are unusable at end game. Bobhlehead stacking needs to go if we are talking about balance. Some of this things are do obvious i'm surprised no obe at Bethesda plays their own game to notice what is balanced and what is not.
---
I would love more people to use my little camp, and to it appear on a map

it's not just that. people with autism have to spend a lot of energy on social encounters because they can't auto-pilot them/it's not subconscious. so it's not just anxiety per say, but some people literally prefer solitude or a certain disconnect, especially with strangers who ultimately will not matter.
---
Dense+fireproof.
---
One thing you can try is to rebuild your PS4 database. If you turn off your PS4, and then when the light stops flashing and it's off then hold the power button down and it should beep. Then it will go into a kind of maintenance mode. Then plug the controller USB in and scroll down to rebuild the database. Maybe that will help. Also what the other person said about the Power Armor Targeting HUD. If you have the maybe remove it. Though I have no idea if either of these things will solve it. It's something to try at least.
---
this is on US servers right?
---
because only once has one approached me to talk with me, and it was my first level 3 character. he was a level 200 something and just kept following me around, saying "hey you wanna buy some meth. hey, wanna buy some meth. hey. meth. you wanna buy meth?"
---
Your heart is in the right place. But those are not dev items they’re actual drops 
---
The reports are that no amount of rad resist compares to power armor, or a hazmat suit. Like there's an extra resist rating you get from them that doesn't happen when you stack resists and chems. The only quasi-viable non-PA build is sneak 3, and a prayer, since you can't wear armor over the hazmat.
---
Sounds great, I look forward to it! Should be on all day so add me when you get on :)
---
Cool. I’m available on Sunday between 2-6pm. I’ll add you on PSN. My PSN is Drushka34.
---
Yes this is extremely irritating!! One time when I was at white springs I got killed with a ton of junk on me and the server disconnected while I was trying to respawn. This has happened multiple times and I have lost probably enough junk every time to craft a whole set of x01 power armor. That's not even an exaggeration. . . .
---
I have a base in that area...Im south of that fissure site and the Lake Eloise location. Its a great place since no one goes down there. 
---
Great idea, they could have three tiers that launch different sized and more deadly nukes for leveled characters. Alpha, at one, would be the nuke as we know it. Bravo, at 2, would would have a 1.5x larger BS and be aimed at players above level 80. Charlie, at 3, would have a 2x larger BS and be aimed at players above level 140 or so. 
---

I'm on Xbox and it's been mixed. Last night I was about to give up after several rejections. Then I saw a level 50 with a great gamertag near me in Flatwoods (I was level 23). I sent a message and we teamed up. Then we invited another nearby level 28.

I'm a 48 year old housewife in Tennessee. Level 50 is an early 20s welder in Texas. Level 28 is a mature 14 year old in Florida. The three of us had an absolute blast for 6+ hours. 
---
Don't give up. You'll find your people.
---
Ever since I stepped out of the vault and saw those tiny liberators I've been dreaming of encountering a massive one, crawling out of a hole somewhere, big as a deathclaw, inch thick steel frame, big red star eye that beams like an assaultron.
---
Oh wow. This is rad. 
---
I see it all the time it's not that rare. You'll get it. 
---
Anybody else miss when fallout was fallout
---
What we need is a return to the good ole days of pre-internet cartridge games where if you shipped a game with a bug or an imbalance it would stay that way forever
---
Did you play fallout 4 if you didn't fill a bath with nuka cola
---
Not sure cause each update, I need re-install the game and the day one patch...51 gb each time...I’m starting loosing willines to try the game again...)
---
If your main account is banned, but you already transferred 50 million bobble heads to another account, that’s still a problem. They need to fix this. 
---
I got a travelvers coat from completing one of us on my alt.
---
It's an RPG. Builds should be more strategic, more diversified. Every perk card should be important. Rightnow, there're too many pointless cards, no matter what build you are.
---
Welcome to 76.
---
Maybe its a feature we could see in private servers
---
Just picked up an axe with bloodied, 50% reflect dmg on block, +1 st from a legendary ghoul today. 
---
eat a Grape mentant and sell it
---
Exactly, the nay sayers are just jealous of this fine weapon!
---
200 individual coffee cups? Yeah I miss that life 
---
Tse WAS ultra rare lol. Then, duping.
---
Yes, but anything less is sadly worthless, at least from the basic turrets. I don't think I have any plans for high level ones yet. Really the issue is the more that turrets take up so much of the budget in the first place.
---
Hi ! Im a very bothered with this nerf cause of 1 reason.  Becsuse once they start nerfing its not  gonna stop. And seeing how this company who runs this game has dealt with other things so far its not gonna be pretty im afraid
---
Thanks! I hopefully want to get some people to run a full game!
---
Well thats just a dick move to point out someones misfortune. Especially with no benefit for them or you.
---
most likey killed another players mule character 2000# of junk is way to easy to come by i know i farmed at a wearhouses all day yeasterday and by the end of the day needed to move close to 1000# of crap over to a mule of mine unless those numbers are rounded off at even numbers thwn id geuss a dupper but then again all of us that use mule characters know we take a risk when trying to move junk from one character to another thats why i always wait for a friend to help body gaurd me when i do move junk
---
I thought you could trade perk cards after level 50. May have been a myth.
---
Completing workshop defense events is a quick way to get tons of CAMP-related plans.
---
Well, I am not going to play 76 any more. So, as loud as I can be. LOL
---
It’s all about personal goals. When I was lv 15 my goal was to find the stimpak plans. About lv 38 I finally got them. Then exploring...
---
Played in white springs about 5 hours off and on, then it was about finding where to settle my camp. NW region felt good but long distance from the action. A quiet place off the beaten path. 
---
Then at 50 I could make power armor (slight disappointment with new pwr armr not having carry weight bonus). Got a fusions generator plans, rebuilt camp for new wiring. That’s where I am. Haven’t seen south east of the map at all. 
---
I’m stuck with a melee build at lv 56 and am just planning to go south. I play at odd hours and don’t have time to make partnerships, I adventure alone all the time. I don’t read the notes or listen to the holotapes. Just whatever the worlds brings, I dose up on chems and dive in headlong! Psn: NoHallway
---
Personal goals!
---
Don’t use pistols. If you have to quad explosive would be a baller pistol imo, I have yet to find one but maybe some day. Quad explosive single action so I can play a gunslinger
---
He, like many others are upset about the nerf. Myself included, probably just venting a little frustration that some people, even users of tse are ok with it.
---
When you take over a workshop PvP will be enabled, but if you don't defend you won't get tagged or w/e.
---
Is stable flux junk? I thought that was in the aid tab....
---

---
The irradiated compassion spreads. Your characters hand is almost as big as his head.
---
Your numbers are mixed up man, i wish it was gonna be that way.
---
IKR 
---
I doubt it too. So many frame rate issues as-is. 
---
On PS4 Pro (and I think this one is unique to PS4, as I've only seen it happen to other PS4 players so far), CAMP snapping is off by a few pixels, resulting in walls, floors and roofs all clipping through eachother. Annoyingly, even if you tear it all down and snap everything back together perfectly, it bugs out again as soon as you relog. [Screenshot #1 of my CAMP](https://i.imgur.com/3enwdNI.jpg), [screenshot #2 of the back](https://i.imgur.com/RMS96CO.jpg).
---
People are friendly but a random group invite is going to be a hard sell. Once you've had someone blow up your camp you're a lot less likely to show people exactly where it is. I personally have mine out in a very public place but not everyone is willing to risk it. 
---
" Like your dad did in Alaska, fighting an oppressor in the ice lands " 
---
Wearing a T-51 PA all-white with a HUGE Laser Gatling
---
Knife to meet you!
---
Good quest, lead me white springs too soon. 
---
If you are playing on the PC and looking to meet friendly players you will want to use the Text Chat mod, best group of people I have ever met! It's like a live version of Reddit while your playing the game.
---
People giving away unwanted items, trading stuff, teaming up, giving advice, asking questions, holding the traveling vendors, calling out which servers had nukes incoming etc.
---
Have gotten so much more out of the game by having this installed. Come on man we are computer people, we dont talk we text. That's what we are all here on Reddit for ;)
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151
---
The point is I want no struggle, I want fun... that's what I play Fallout for.
---
How much for the boy?
---
I mean yes and no. Maybe if we get a steady 60fps first and this feature didn't threaten that stable frame rate? 
---
I've seen the mod, not the plan in the Harper's ferry vendor
---
I understand you, but it clearly says when you claim a workshop that another player might try and take it and put you in open PvP. Workshops are not worth fighting for anymore so you're right about simply switching the server.
---
They break SO fast
---
Pacifist doesn't stop you from being harmed. Only stops you from harming others. 
---
Wait for the next patch. Then the game will crash on the rest of the map too.
---
What platform u on? I have a spare 10mm smg plan on xbone
---
My wife and I play all the time. We have encountered both bad and good people. One was pissed that I didn’t accept their invite and he proceeded to destroy my camp when I ignored him in a fight. He was a much higher level than I was and I did not stand a chance. However, on the other side of things, I have met about an equal amount of nice people who have given us awesome weapons and ammo at random. We try and pay it forward and give to anyone who is lower than us in level. But I always meet every person with a sense of “they’re going to try and kill me”. I’m on PS4 btw. Hopefully you meet nice people soon.
---
Put a bayonet on that thing it looks hilarious 
---
Well with the upcoming TSE nerf, its most useful form will now be just as useless as the non legendary form.
---
Nice I've got to get on and try to find it myself lol
---
Yes you are. It would be overpowered because there are like 18 mutations you can have. And with just two luck perks you have essentially no draw backs.
---
Have you seen the black powder blunderbus? Lol
---
I thought pacifist mode just made you unable to harm other players, but they can still harm you...
---
It might be that I stepped into the zone around the workbench, yes. That is why I wrote that you need some sort of confirmation, simply walking into the zone is not how it should work.   
---
I also read in other threads that you don't need to engage taking over and that you can now be attacked anywhere on the map by the person who reclaimed your workshop.   
---
Stable flux is junk, raw flux is aid.
---
I'd be down with a Haggar 2H pipe.
---
Harpers Ferry vendor always has either the Barn set or the Brick whenever I go to sell to him.
---
I see the brick set there all the time but no barn
---
No unfortunately for him, raw flux is an aid. Stable flux is junk. Kind of annoying you can loose something so valuable
---
I disagree. We need more pipe weapons in more safes ASAP. 
---
*just dupe a bunch of them bro!!* 
---
Inb4 "duping is ruining fo76." ^I ^know, ^it's ^a ^shit ^thing ^to ^do!
---
Yeah seems like every "bug" fix just adds more bugs and instability
---
KnowledgeHound, mics busted right now but I play a heavy gun/ melee medic most of the time happy to help out if I’m on 
---
Or a pouch and give them extra storage c:
---
It seemed to me that if you took a massive amount of damage as the last hit you are insta-gibbed.  Whereas if you were widdled down and just didn't heal in time you went down.
---
&gt; There’s a reason temporary changes (which a mutation is) don’t effect perks. 
---
idk about that I've had the same mutations for about a month now... thanks starched genes 
---
I would love to know because honestly think I have phantom budget use. I have no defense, a 3x3 base, one story and surrounded it with concrete walls. Inside it has all the crafting benches, fusion generator, stash, bed and arch. With perhaps 7 small decorative items and 3 or 4 power connectors my budget is full. I've seen bases with the same things, two stories and multiple missile turrets. No idea how they manage it.
---
PA is already shit on in PVP anyways sadly :c  And it's easy as hell to blow off players pieces, cause PA I read takes "FULL DAMAGE" to its durability.  A player hit me once in my ultracite and shattered it
---
That sucks. On my first attempt the nuclear codes refreshed just before I could launch the nuke. If I had of started 5min earlier I would have made it!
---
Remember when the same idiots were saying during the beta, “it’s just a beta bro, chill out”. 
---
Few months later the game seems to have gotten worst. 
---
#ItJustWorks.
---
It's not really that great if you are not into melee. Plus it's rather heavy so it's hard to keep unless you mod it lighter. Sold mine off few hundreds of caps.
---
Someone below quoted it to weight 9 lbs,  I think it weights 10. More or less the same, rather a lot if you don't use it.
---
Yeah I really miss the awkward heavy breathing and random music. 
---
I still think that we need an option for "If you want it, you can have it". 
---
I'd suggest letting them back in but with no characters on their account.
---
Pacifist mode makes you a pacifist, not everyone else. Don't like PvP? Don't claim workshops. It even gives you a warning...
---
When they ruin our fun, like they're doing rn... I'll turn against them.
---
I would like to hear Todd Howard interview on the current state on the game
---
1 point in pain train
---
I already do, but I need them for the legendary enemies that others also want to get loot from
---
I've been using a Zealot .50 cal for most things but a few days ago I got an Anti-Armour .50 cal with 25% faster firing. I was so happy but it absolutely tears through ammo more than I expected and now I'm going to go find lots of lead.
---
Thanks for the link to your post, your information and the comment with the hard number were both really useful.  
---
Making some assumptions on my part since my base dmg was so low and yours was higher, it's nice to see and that I can say our numbers for my portion of testing seem to line up somewhat(or at least are close).  
---
And on another note, the hard numbers also line up with my assumption that Superior penetration was 40-50%(since it seems to be 40%), and my guess of 15% armor pen wasn't that far off either, it's not super close but it is not terribly far off either.(since its actually 20%)  
---
I love how people cared enough about such a small thing that many of us in the community are all testing it and coming up with similar conclusions. It just further reinforces the assumption that our data is correct(or close :P).  
---
Thanks again for your reply I really appreciated it!  
---
At that level, I would claim every workshop I can, do the first defense, get some XP, and the rewards and then walk away from it.  You might lose a few caps, but usually you end up ahead with the xp gain and the plans.
---
Almost as rare as real TSE weapons.
---
I want my balls back 
---
This game is only playable until level 50, and before then only half the map is really accessible solo, unless you like sneaking everywhere. 
---
So now you have 2000 pounds of junk... Fucking duper
---
I mean, techincally your hand waved, it just happened to be once quickly in his direction with something that happened to slip out of your hand...
---
Based on how they've "balanced" the game already, I expect what they'll do will be like sharpening a pencil until there's nothing but eraser remaining.
---
I have 2,  will let go for 1k caps
---
This took a turn.
---
I appreciate it, I am level 172 and I love the things I'm constanly taking from the overseer's stash. I originally thought she had all those low level guns for me to scrap, i just find out recently people leave these here for me?
---
Yea but if they are at your camp, you will have to re locate or change server
---
Cheers but I have like 350 caps haha 
---
You’re not welcome there
---
I respect your opinion, but IMO the TSE nerf was handled poorly for a number of reasons. Firstly, there was no issue with the two shot prefix on it's own, which has now become 1.25 shot. Secondly melee is now even more hilariously OP compared to every other weapons type. Seriously I've done big guns, pistols, rifles and aside from the rifles which are sort of decent everything else needs major changes. Melee can one hit most enemies especially with good legendaries so I predict people will likely move over to it en masse, I also predict we will start seeing people having issues with scorched earth, given how fucking bullet spongey the queen is, and the event will likely end up needing a timer adjustment. Personally, as someone who hates using melee, I really don't want it to become the only viable choice for the endgame. TSE needs changes, for sure, but hopefully we can get to a stage were all weapon types can be viable.
---
For. Freaking. Real. I've never played 3rd person because of this. Drives me nuts. 
---
I never understand why people don’t just give away or at least give duplicates for free. Seems like a dick move
---
50 cal also use a lot of ammo, no?
---
This would be nice but, if they have starched genes upgrade, all you'd do is cure their rads D:
---
Yeah I chuck mine in the suitcase at the train station along with everyone else’s
---
&gt;Is the quest just over for me, or is there a way I could get it to restart.
---
Over? No. You should be able to resume tracking from checking it on from quests tab on pipboy. If it's not there, it should, but if it's not, try visiting the mayor computer or listening the watoga automated warning radio thingy again to trigger it.
---
Maybe when I learn the bayonet mod.
---
I just makes no sense. Claiming a workshop is not a PvP action. It's only PvP if you fight over it. If I'd like to give it away, why should it enable me for PvP?
---
Might be true for the for core mechanics amd first half of the game but endgame was hardly thought about and that is evident. 
---
Starched genes only prolongs it’s effect. It’s removable with radaway, so it’s temporary. You can’t eliminate Special points, only move them. 
---
Armor/mutations/weapons effects are only temporary.  I’ve heard guys with 20+ in multiple stats because of mutations. To me allowing these guys to stack perks is no different than the bobble exploiters. 
---
To be more specific, prime receivers and ultracite weapons use ultracite ammo. And good luck if you get an ultracite Gatling laser. Then you need to craft ultracite fusion cores, which require cobalt flux.
---
Cuz its not a duplicate. I have also been holding on to my plans for profit.  I have given much better stuff away than that, but you would never know that unless i told you.  I also just got done holding a vendor bot for 1 hr for ppl. Long story short, i do my good deeds
---
No but you can re-assign special points after level 50
---
And even if you do good deeds it just seems like abusing common sense and trying to gain only.
---
No! I hate ants. They are resilient as fu**k small as an.... ant. Those fuck*rs are just terrible enemies. Do not empower these monster! What will be next? Tick queen? Molerat queen? Nooooo!
---
What about just text chat...
---
Everyone wants an emote for something, just let us communicate without a radial menu or having to listen to kids eating their mic.
---
Nice work mate! I would give another upvote purely for you having that idea!
---
This is the way ive stayed stocked up, I dont even know the water purifier plan on my level 172 main, but whenever I'm needing water or food, (I don't grow my own crops either, that's peasant work.) I'll just hop over to my level 8 alt and hang around the vault entrance, sometimes Ill server hop till I see anybody above level 30 or so, then I'll spam the hungry and thirsty emotes till they give me stuff.
---
At this point my use for them is over. I will friend them and quickly run to flatwoods. I have a secret place there to store my new things... I will "disconnect" then suprise! I'm level 172 and collecting the foods and waters they've given so kindly! I will then fast travel back and kill them with my two shot explosive shotgun, and they cant do anything cause of my sentinel armor!
---
Tldr, This game is awesome! I love being a raider! Life is good!
---
You can get the plans and start building up the rediculous amounts of scrap to build the EX PA before lvl 25, so once you lvl 25 you can straight put it on.  Took me 4 lvls of effort to get everything needed.
---
So if i had strength 4 and charisma 8. After level 50 I can re-assign my points to say: strength 6, charisma 6?
---
Think I’d drop 10 bucks for Maxson’s Battlecoat. I always rocked it in F04 for both characters. 
---
No, the bots are friendly or hostile to each single player separately.
---
There's like a little army of you guys. Is this what we're complaining about this week then?
---
And for some reason can be gobbled up as regular FCs. I made some at one point. They slowly disappeared from my inventory.
---
Also had a neat bug (should have videoed it) where I claimed a suit of PA and it automatically put in a UC core for some reason. The pieces on the suit just blew up. Lol. 
---
And cobalt isn’t an issue for me. I rarely use it and it’s abundant if you hit Morgantown or just south of the water park. Violet is usually where I’m hung up as I need it for both 5.56 and 50.
---
Yeah but you can only move 1 point per level, so level 51 you could be cha7 str5 then level 52 you can move the other point across
---
Ease up on the caffeine there, tiger.
---
I think you forgot to switch accounts 
---
I'm not sure if the few random mr gutsy are part of that system but there's definetly some random horde or whatever event that can spawn many of those, and they are not part of watoga's bots so they will be hostile.
---
You need to calm down and get a reality check. The game launched with horrendous issues and many of them have already been fixed. Most of the others have been acknowledged and are currently being worked on. As for the crashes, it's pretty well known that the ps4 is garbage. You should have seen the black ops 4 forums when that game launched, it was filled with nothing but "my ps4 bluescreened wtf". Idk why it's still being marketed as a gaming console with such faulty programming that it can't even run any of the new games
---
It literally tells you when you claim a workshop that you're at risk of PvP with other players if they try to claim it.
---
You're overdramatizing.  In my experience that only happened seldomly and was easily tolerated.  Sounds like you just can't handle shit.
---
BURN THE DUPER!!!!1!!
---
Oh, and for the ammo I was just making obscene amounts of UC 308 to get rid of my huge stash of fluorescent from Whitesprings. Didn’t even have a gun that used it, but bandolier made it practically weightless.
---
You click 'ok' to PvP everytime you claim a workshop. Whether you want to fight over it is irrelevant. You signed up for or PvP regardless of your intentions. If you don't intend on fighting for it. Leave. He can't shoot you if you're not there. Also, if you just did a deal for 30 stable flux. Why did you go claiming workshops before you stashed it. You could've even built a stash at the workshop you claimed and put it in there. 
---
For casual coop it’s great. A lot of the bugs have been fixed or are due to be fixed, and if you are a more casual player done don’t really affect you. I play on PS4 and have yet to experience a game breaking bug. Server drops out on occasion but that’s about it. It’s a really fun game imo
---
That's not a lot of junk if he has 3 rank pack rat.
---
Dupers have 100000 TSE Handmades or 124879187241827 stim packs.
---
I think you killed and stole someone's hard earned junk.  
---
I'm edging out to level 300. I find uses for all my lower level perk cards. They're valuable to me.
---
But on PC we have a mod for this and it's really convenient. I have 8 perk load outs to choose from
---
The support said to unequip everything (cards, weapons, armor) and logoff cause it's a UI issue, but it didn't work and I'm waiting for a reply
---
On ps4 there's no clicking or advanced filtering so at the moment there not much to try
---
Executioner, faster fire, and +50% crits would be a pretty awesome combo on a 10mm using a luck crit/auto pistol build
---
There are also 2 FireCap spawns right behind Gauley Mine.
---
You'd have to pay me to take them. Give me 10 caps and I'll take your mini-nuke.
---
The children of Atom really need to make a appearance either in the shop or in a DLC. For example the current time of the game's story might be a perfect place to witness their founding.
---
This looks great! I've been slowly trying to switch from heavy build to this type of build and was having some trouble building it on my own but mine isnt too far off from this other than my luck is low right now. Will definitley see what i can move around to make this more like yours.
---
Just these two specifically. Other quest rewards no. Upon completion of the quest line it gives you the ability to craft these two at higher levels.
---
Today my wife and I decided to tackle the silo. We had master hacker and it made life a lot easier. We get through each event pretty well until the last one. So many robots, it was crazy. We were over an hour into it and we felt as if we would never finish as the boards of bots just kept coming. We were almost out of ammo and guns but we were determined to not give up so we could launch our very first nuke together. We worked so hard. Then we destroyed them. The only thing left to do was put in the launch code and watch as all of our work had finally paid off. It would be amazing. Except it wasn’t. As soon as we picked out the area for the nuke to drop we got disconnected from the server. Needless to say we were very upset. That was all we worked for was to watch that nuke go so that her gamer tag was there for everyone to see. The celebration of all the hard work was robbed from us in the most crucial moment. We decided that we would try again. We have such a love hate relationship with this game. We want to love it so badly but there are just so many things wrong with it. 
---
TLDR; Wife and I completed a silo for the first time, only to be disconnected from server before it took off. 
---
The struggle is real.
---
Emotes I would like to see:
---
- get lost
---
- thanks
---
- I'm busy with something
---
(I would likely use them in this order.)
---
Some additional emotes which would really replace a microphone:
---
- I need help with: stimpack/radaway/food/water/caps
---
- lets go: capture a workshop/work on a quest/play an event.
---
- [select player name from list]: is a friend/enemy.
---
I got the impression that it was only for the duration of the countdown when claiming.
---
You willing to help out a new friend? 😶
---
The Challenge to kill this boss while wearing T-51 armour is what unlocks the all white paint skin.
---
The little robot figurines are wasted on scrap, they're cool af
---
As long as we don't start going full fortnighte or what ever that game is called.
---
Translation: I don't play this way so I don't want others to play this way. I want to take them down to my level instead of lifting myself up. 
---
&gt;people often idle or are sifting through menus, right?
---
If you are menu you will exit it if some NPC enemy attacks you and you are low level enough not to safely ignore it.
---
But besides that, I suppose there can be a total of 5 players totally AFK there. Never seen it myself and I've been there alot, waiting in the corner, technically afk from game but if something or someone gets close, I would hear it and could check it.
---
It'd probably be better to buff other things so there's better options than running TSE and accidentally offing yourself twice per session. 
---
And let's not forget that they released the last patch with a de facto BUFF to TSE. Fireproof applying to explosives made TSE safer for people to use, so the main trade off with TSE meant even less.
---
This is exactly my point - claiming an unclaimed workchop should not be considered a PvP action.
---
As for the flux, 1) my stash is permanently full and 2) I simply forgot that flux is junk and 3) I never had a problem of picking up my lost junk if I die accidentally 
---
Yea I was more thinking to the one in the FO3 DLC
---
Well Assassins and Mutants give a measly +10%. So yeah +100% seems pretty OP. You'll only miss the second bullet if youre far away. The random forward angle of the TwoShot projectile isn't huge. It's like.... 15-20 degrees off max? 
---
Hey OP if your on pc download the chat mod man. Check the trade channel in game normally people giving them away to those who need. Also if you join a clan via the chat mod you can check with the quartermasters i can bet ya someone has a spare one for ya.
---
Oh shit. Thats a... mess
---
Too much nerfing, not enough buffing. 
---
Yep. Can confirm: wife and I did this and it made life so much easier. Also complete some responder missions. We got 36 stimpacks as a reward. Helps a lot. 
---
What? If you're not going to play then just go away.
---
You do. Leave. 
---
And if you're worried about losing junk, you're already able to make a stash box at the workshop to put stuff away.
---
We don't need additional options or functions for things we're already able to do or are clearly warned about.
---
I sort of see where you're coming from, but it's a bit of nitpick if anything.
---
It was a joke dude. Talking about not being able to handle shit lmao. With your angry little downvote too. Poor lil guy. 
---
Its done the as a choice of levelling options, so you can either pick a perk or move a point
---
The welding mask is supposed to go with the engineer outfit, but the front of it is raised and doesn't look very good in my opinion. I prefer the medical goggles.
---
If your on pc come join the community, we use chat mod. It allows us to have global, trade , clans, local and all chats. I have met people from all over the world and our clan has people from all over.
---
Master hacker. Get it and hack some terminals. It won’t take away the entire hoard but it will ease a lot of tension.
---
Oh I didn’t even realize that!  That’s good to know.  
---
Two shot literally makes everything else obsolete, doesn't it?   
---
It's basically just a 100% damage increase 
---
Whitesprings is only repetitive because it’s one of only two viable places in the entire map to nuke. The answer is not necessarily lowering the amount of exp gained it’s to add more unique bosses.
---
Well that's not the problem with marsupial but more aboit INT shitty passive effects. 
---
I've been playing at a Glacial Pace since BETA and have yet to come anywhere near endgame stuff. Spent a TON of time in the forest and Grafton areas so adventuring out into other regions has been a super fresh and exciting experience. Little goals like saving up tons of scrap to make level 45 Excavator PA or finding specific CAMP plans has been a recent motivation. Recently started dipping my toes in the Mire to get that quest for that one faction rolling. Just taking my time and really enjoying this game. Definitely not trying to blow through everything as quick as possible. 
---
It is. Spawn back after it's been taken without Seeking Revenge or having a bounty and you'll find both parties neutral.
---
Taking an owned workshop puts you into battle with the owner, who was already consented to the possibility when they claimed it.
---
I need to leave pretty fast, I gotta say. Considering the game never warn you that your workshop is being attacked. It's just about being one-shotted by a chameleon overpowered sniper player without warning, not about deciding to fight or leave. 
---
I always restart my PC when this occurs.
---
Well, you wanted to wait for the price on the game to drop and got it cheaper. You can't have everything ,i guess...
---
Giant Todd head zapping dupers with laser eyes gets my vote for next boss
---
I couldn't care less about the NPC thing.... 
---
I preordered it
---
These types of builds go really well with pistols too. If you have a half decent revolver you can just sit in VATS forever and get a crit every second shot. Gung Fu lets you just kill everything in a radius without ever leaving VATS. 
---
You mean.... hard earned victory ROYALE?!
---
The thing is it happens right away 
---
I enjoy doing that until every time I came back they will be on the floor underneath the table
---
Thanks man!!!
---
I personally think it would be great if they implemented the dlcs from fallout 4 into this game.
---
Automatron dlc with the robot workshop could allow you to make robots to defend your camp and possibly do small jobs such as collecting resources from your collectors and plants.
---
Wasteland workshop so people could make big factory camps where they could mass produce weapons, ammo or food to sell or scrap for mods.
---
The animal one with the cages so people could capture creatures and take them for home defence or possibly make fighting pits where they could put on a show or have people place bets.
---
I just feel that there was so much content from fallout 4 that could have been implemented into this game but was just wasted.
---
Somehow I am able to scrap handmade guns and get mods from them even without having unlocked the plans for them.
---
Radx doesnt cure rads. Genes doesnt prevent mutations from disabling
---
You should be prepared for it.
---
You're able to craft defenses and an actual alarm system with workshop items as well.
---
I like the fact it's not heavily controlled by rules. 
---
If the workshop owner is ill prepared, a sneakier player SHOULD be able to steal it from underneath them.
---
Aye, if you’re looking for people add me PSN ~ Yukon-96
---
I thought the upgraded version of starched genes stopped you from gaining any mutations at all, and losing the ones you had?
---
Hey man, I'm a LVL 150 solo sneak sniper. Everyone plays differently but there are a few things I would say you should change.
---
Strength
---
- Bandolier (it's kind of useless, ammo doesn't weigh that much and you return to camp so often you can just top up to stay around 400-500)
---
Perception
---
-1 from longshot (you don't gain alot more from 1 point)
---
+1 in concentrated fire, so you can vats head shot if enemies get close
---
Intelligence
---
- Maybe change the doctor perk to gunsmith. (As a sneak sniper you shouldn't take damage so often, but your gun will)
---
Agility
---
+ Escape artist. (If you change anything, this should be it. Extremely important for a sneak build)
---
Luck
---
- Cripple perk. As a sneak sniper (especially with explosive damage) you should be looking to max dmg to a point that you kill enemies in 1 shot or 2. No need to cripple.
---
- if you're using maybe instead invest in 1 point critical savy and 1 point better critical
---
Let them steal workshops all they want. But not killing owners. 
---
I didn't downvote you, nor am I angry.  Even with sarcasm, you're overdramatizing and now you're demeaning lol.  I was making a legitimate statement so would only expect a fair statement in return.  Also, whomever downvoted you was right to do so, considering your statement is completely irrelevant.  That's what the vote button is for, relevancy.
---
Downgrade your gauss rifle. Modded weapons weigh more.
---
But really you should consider taking some of that junk down from the 100 mark. You never need to have 100 glass scrap "just in case" but you will need 100 screws/springs. Stockpile common junk less unless you need to, like for steel.
---
Aren't those assaultrons only like level 20something?
---
Looks solid enough, i would suggest to remove dromedary and rejuvenated and put them in adrenaline, if you get the carnivore mutation, food becomes a much smaller issue, purified water is easy to get once you have a camp and most events reward it too.
---
It is exploitable. For example, have a team of 2 or 3. One goes to the shop and starts a claim. This initiates PvP and hides the owner on the claimant’s map.  His teammates can still see the other player though and tell him where to go to kill him and loot his stuff. 
---
If I’m not mistaken this bit about teammates being able to see players hostile to other teammates is supposed to be patched. 
---
The workshops are built as PvP zones.
---
You have blatant warnings.
---
If you're so concerned with the possibility of dying, prepare better, avoid workshops completely or run.
---
I love the 10mm pistol in this game. Even with an auyo receiver it's totally controllable 
---
You have an even better idea. Right now there is no reason to have more than one silo.
---
So awesome! 
---
Stuff like this gets me excited to see what others will come up with in the future.
---
The only thing that changed was that bulking 10 waste acid didn't give you a bulk acid worth 15 waste acid. No weight reduction if you ignore the unrecoverable plastic from bulking
---
You. You get me. Lol.
---
It does work anywhere on the map. I tried taking over one, but a defend event popped up for the owner. 4 waves of blood bugs?  Not really worth my time since I’ll have my own defend afterward. Left to the nearby town. 
---
Got busy killing Scorched when I see a notification pop up that I just killed so and so and then shortly after, he’s seeking revenge. I had caught the camp owner in my explosive splash AoE.
---
I fully agree, I fired a laser pistol to empty the mag, about 60 rounds, and the gun was already 1/3 of the way broken. This was low level BUT I did have gunsmith level 2 which is frankly stupid.
---
Yeah but they're like level 24...
---
2000 junk is nothing, yes like its been said hes prob a hoarder with that fallout monkey on his back (cant walk past anything not glued down).
---
Dupers have 100000000 of weight on them, just look at the videos etc you never see one with just 2000 lb, stre build, enough workshops and weight perks could easily explain 2000 weight. 
---
Id take what i want though then maybe sell the rest back to him or dump it somewhere and send him a map (lol).
---
Congrats though, you are now a filthy wasteland raider and lets be honest if he was pleading and pleading with you he's probably rage quit by now!
---
Enjoy your raider status, but remember now when someone comes and takes your hard earned loot that its just raider life ;)
---
For every griefer you encounter you will run across 15+ helpful people who just want to borrow your benches / stash / give you stuff. I don't know about other people but I frown on anyone picking on lower levels and try to hunt them down.
---
The longer any electronic device is on the more errors you'll get, regardless of how long you've been using any particular app.  It's worth a try to restart to at least rule that out as a possible cause.  If it's still doing it, I'd make sure I had up to date video drivers.  If that is true, then see if you can find posts of it happening to other people with a similar PC build.
---
I’ve got ten keycards waiting but I refuse to run a silo again until things are stable. Every single time I either blue-screen in the silo or after the nuke drops. I joined a server after getting dc’d just as another player launched their own nuke. As it was counting down I dc’d again. It’s not just you.
---
Hahahahahah ok ok look that was really funny. I mean some of it i did not get but i have had most of that happen to me. 
---
No, I'm going to stay around like a scorchbeast making loud noises.
---
Didn't they say they could check the inventories? That would result in a ban of the alt instead of the main 
---
Okay i sill try that and see thanks 
---
Game was supposed to run smoothly after duping and CW glitch gone? Just remembering 90% said that
---
If you attach the beam splitter it’s ridiculous. Each beam is taken into account causing it to degrade 5x faster again. I hope a fix is implemented soon, My build is centred around energy weapons :(
---
Try Vendor Bot Phoenix in Watoga.  He usually has a ton of plans and I have seen him with Barn before.
---
An Ant Queen would be cool. Especially since there's so many mines and caves to explore. 
---
To ask, are the protectrons in Watoga legendary? If so then that is normal and has been that way since FO4. 
---
Nuka cola machine that opens, yet doesn't allow you to put bottles in it?!
---
You're welcome, let me know how it goes.
---
Try a permadeath run. Or fists-only. Make up some kind of build with restrictions.
---
Its not a server thing its a daily reset thing you can only get 1400 caps per day from vendors in total.
---
I'd only pay for FDE if it came in 9 different shades like real life.
---
I also met someone cool there. He gave me plans and we took a picture together. He was then brutally murdered by three level 90+ players while I escaped in sneak mode.....
---
My experience is just getting worse after every update
---
Oh ok this makes more sense. 
---
Sama täällä. Jatkuvasti lentää pelistä jne
---
I've thrown out almost as many as I've killed queens. At least 50% drop rate.
---
As someone who was once tasked with re-organizing/re-naming over 80,000 food images in a digital library long-neglected, I can't understand why this isn't more well understood in today's age.  
---
It's like we got PCs and everyone forgot (or were not taught) basic organization skills. 
---
"whenever I’m doing an event and I see someone nearby I invite.  
---
But they never accept, is it not beneficial?"
---
It isn't necessary. Just being in the area gets you opted in to the event so if they care about it they'll likely help. As for the Whitespring ghouls I'm around level 185. If I see someone using a TSE weapon I will ask them not to (perhaps not quite so nicely) and most will stop. It doesn't affect me too much as I tend to run through with my favourite tool for that area - Quad Tesla Rifle with automatic barrel. The arcing shots tag a lot so even if there's someone trying to one-shot everything I get credit for tagging and some loot. Not ideal though sadly.
---
&gt; The others are a waste of resources **for damage dealt.**
---
It's not about how much ammo is used, its about damage dealt for resources spent. The .50 cal shoots a bit slower than the other ballistic machine guns (lmg/minigun) but does nearly twice the damage per bullet. That being said, yes, I only use my .50 cal when I want higher dps(SBQ and other big mobs). My gatling gun is my main weapon.
---
Agree 100% what's the point of a card system with customizable decks
---
Probably bored at that stage of the game. 
---
I used to do the same thing when I hit level cap in ESO - follow noobs around and shadow them
---
I miss having legendary weapons, unique clothes, magazines, bobbleheads and full sets of power armour on display.
---
I tried having a walk-in vault of gold and pre-war money but it all fell through the floor.
---
Yeah I have collected all the bears and now they just sit in my stash box :(
---
Crafting a new Voice of Set uses your current one. You can not discard it if you want to craft a new one later.
---
Same here, mine got tired of it and went back to Red Dead 2 :( The whole 'play FO with your actual friends' thing is cool... as long as there's enough content to keep them interested. Me, I can easily spend a day or two rebuilding my camp, chilling at a workshop, or just exploring, so my main quest progression is almost nonexistent. Add me: thekikibee
---
highly agree with this. i also run a sniper build, and everything that needs to be said seems to already be here.
---
I am still having nightmares about all the dancing guardians, and I don't want any vault dwellers in there. It would be awful.
---
I wanted this paint as well but didn't have the Atoms and didn't want to spend more money on the game. 
---
If I knew I would have still been playing it now I would have forked out real money for it. 
---
Now they just have stupid colourful toy box paint jobs. 
---
Ah that must be it, 95% of my game time has been solo. Now I've just got to find some people the play with!
---
Difficulty should be increased for higher level solo players though, it's supposed to be end game after all. 
---
Alpha Alpha.
---
No! That's not diversified means. Just like TSE, if everyone wants it, it makes a RPG gameplay less diversified, and becomes a problem.
---
They did not. They can track what you craft but claim to not be able to view inventories, which I do not believe, but I’m not a programmer. 🤷‍♂️
---
Always.
---
What's so wrong about my suggestion? It won't stop people from claiming other player's workshops. Won't stop players from fighting over it. Why are you so against it? Sniping out peaceful pve players is such an important part of the game? Considering that it is prohibited literally everywhere else in the game?
---
Hi
---
Larry
---
Us
---
In Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4 I have a whole room filled with teddy bears. I miss doing that. Oh, and I also miss a local map. 
---
The only reason I can see with no npc’s is that we just got out. The raiders, etc were probably more dwellers that didn’t ‘adjust.’ When the introduce the new vaults hopefully that will see a influx of more ‘human’ interaction.
---
I have had three sets. All from claiming workshops. Left two at the overseer's camp. That said I haven't seen any for a few weeks.
---
If it should have reset already, try selling it something. You can’t sell if he doesn’t have caps.  
---
I’ve had a few display as 0, but if I sell or buy something it’ll update to the right amount.  
---
That's great and all, but that falls into the trap that players have to play a certain way for a viable build. When the idea is any build should be viable and minute specialization is there for people who want to do it.
---
Gotta be careful not to encourage server hopping even more but also not timegating it too much
---
Juu on se kumma ettei ne saa korjattua näitä isoimpia bugeja, alkaa välillä mielenkiinto hiipua tähän peliin. 
---
Well friend, then I suggest you take a look here
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314752/regarding-dupes-and-exploits
---
They clearly state they can. 
---
Yeah I've noticed that it says 0 and if you sell some thing for say 1cap it will go to 199. Do you know what time they actually reset?
---
I doubt he was a duper..
---
so this may seem like a silly question, these are aps multipliers yeah? so i would take my melee's dmg and multiply it by these to know my true dmg per second? (perks not included here)
---
I met a friendly. He gave me power armor and cores. But because I’m a noob, my power armor got stolen.
---
My comment was literally relevant to the topic of voice chat dude. What are you on about? You tell me I can't handle shit and am being overly dramatic and then you turn around and say I'm demeaning? Do you read the things that come out of your fingers?
---
I believe it will be come available again at some point down the line. I just can’t say when.
---
I'd drop sniper. You get 60 seconds as a base if you can't take the shot in that time just relax and try again
---
No need to sell them anything. If it reads 0 when it shouldn’t you just back out and then start the trade again and it will reset to 200.
---
Word is they reset every 20 hours real - time. This feels correct by my experience.
---
There is a lot I miss with FO76 but mainly it's living NPCs lol
---
Grahm can have it in his inventory any level just real low chance. I got my first plan at around level 65 from Grahm.
---
 If you trolled up a bunch of Assultrons you were being quite incautious. I have been running around there in my present char since level 15 for business reasons, he's 35 now and although my higher level did do the Major's quest, I'm not gonna bother with him.
---
 Its really easy. If you spawn at the Station just watch to your right for the rare Eyebot or Protectron and stealth past em'. They are not particularly perceptive. After dealing with the Station Vendor just go straight out the door towards Super Duper Mart where the BOS Vendor hangs his hat. If you hear a challenge just run a bit and stealth out when you get to the Bot. 
---
 You can take lots of Watoga Bot fire if you have Leather Armor, well not her ladyship of the red flare, of course. ;)
---
If your Xbox I have one I can sell you.
---
Yup 
---
Two-shot needs to stay because of the horrible game-mechanic known as bullet-sponge enemies.
---
The problem was nuking Whitesprings gave you the best Xp Farm and Legendary Farm. So Bethesda was smart they nerfed Xp But Left Legendary Farm.
---
Great idea!  But that'd be more doable if Bethesda gave you 1x1 and 1x2 squares with your purchase. :(
---
All three of these issues are problems.  They are handling each issue in different ways due to differences of severity. 
---
Just checking the basics here, are you just going to the different vendors or to different faction vendors?  
---
The factions share their caps amongst themselves so if you have used the 200 caps up it will show no money to trade with all of the vendors from that faction. Other factions will still have caps to trade.
---
Nothing. I just find it unnecessary. I just don't agree with it. 
---
T60 Jet Pack spawns at Phoenix bot in Watoga usually find 1 a day if I lm farming for the plan.
---
With you on that. I mean, wtf do I want with 4 warehouse building sets?
---
I could go for a "turn off your fucking microphone you inconsiderate ass" emote
---
Sarcasm is not relevant to a legitimate statement.
---
\&gt; With your angry little downvote too. Poor lil guy. I'm sorry you're the kind of person that needs /s but I won't reduce myself to that level. 
---
This is demeaning and uncalled for, not that it matters.  Calling you out for sarcastically whining about open mics was called for, in my opinion.
---
Only plans not in the game for PA are X01 Plans and Ultracite Jetpack Plan.
---
You on PS4?
---
where can you find this mod??
---
link to download??
---
Nexus mod manager
---
Radx is not radaway. It just temporary disables mutations and is no affected by genes
---
Thank You! I want to, (at some point), use it to actually play a game with people! 
---
This guy marriages 
---
Niinpä, ja nyt alkaa nerffaaminen - eli ei oo aikaa korjata bugeja. Alkaa räjähtävistä jne
---
Turrets are in a pathetic state. Having them be the same level as a player wouldn't make any difference because they'd still be useless with the only difference being they take longer to die.  Whatever they're using to determine turret behaviour needs to be looked at and either fixed or redone because I've had experiences like others where, for example, a mole rat will just be attacking a turret constantly until it breaks. The turret and any others nearby will ignore the mole rats even if one gets destroyed.
---
 The entire west side of the map is Responder and they share 200 caps. The one in Sutton Station is Raider and draws from a different pool. There are several other factions that control bots as you work your way east. Each has 200 caps among the members of that faction.
---
Still not happened to me
---
Only if we can do the floss.
---
That’ll do buckaroo
---
That is fucking hilarious LOL
---
I just wish they would release an offline version already. They had a good run.
---
Haven't read anything from bgs about that, if you find anything share it pls. Would be great to have access to suppressed smgs. I have 10mm smg plans, build and scrapped a lot of them and feel like i should have everything unlocked by now. No suppressor sadly.    And no sights, just that really bad, almost broken, iron sights. That gun is really in need of some live from bgs...
---
You can add me if you want. PSN neetjutsu. Level 265. I’m usually on during the evenings EST time. I have a mic as well, but I don’t always use it because I also have really loud kids and I understand that’s not something people want to hear over the mic. 
---
What do you mean "still"? Is this a thing at the moment?
---
Hahaahah
---
Or all the magazines I don't use because I'M NOT USING FUCKING ENERGY WEAPONS! 
---
Awesome man I’ll give you an add, I’m in Australia so time might be different. Do you have any idea when you might be doing it next?
---
I meant it has not happened to me. Just dropping s legendary now and then 
---
I recall the data mined mods list not having the suppressor or sights on for it. Was really hoping theyd add it. 
---
it's a sunday night in australia (AEST) and it's happening a lot - got the temporary disconnection message every few seconds for about 10-15 straight minutes - extremely frustrating - and then disconnected.
---
please fix the stability issue!!
---
Oh interesting. I’ll look into it
---
I will grab it for ya.
---
Here's what I found that might be very useful

I could not attach the mod because I had no cobalt flux and violet flux. To make those look at your chemistry bench.

Glowing Mass

Hardened Mass

High radiation fluid

10 raw of corresponding flux 
---
If you buy the mod and you do not have the needed (requires) materials..no dice!

You only have 2 hours to make flux once harvested the raw!

Nah pc :(
---
Make sure your PC is not set to "power saver mode" in power settings. Power saver mode underclocks your cpu. Make sure you are set to "High Performance" mode. 
---
You might be lucky enough to find our hero on the text mod too.
---
One guy goes around to anyone who asks in the chat mod and give any plans away for free. We all give our spare plans to him and he goes from person to person to give any plans they dont have to them. I am a plan maniac so I gave away like 40 plans and got a bunch I didnt already have.
---
This is how a online community works when we have the right tools ;)
---
yeh i get the blue error screen on my ps4 every 5 to 10 minutes at whitesprings..sometime even 10 seconds after i get there..since latest update..sorta making the game unplayable. i love all the fallout games but i dont know how long i can keep this up. dissapointed
---
Oh, the bliss of having enough adhesive in Fallout... 
---
I'm in two minds about the nerf. I love my tse combat shotty its ridiculously powerful and great fun. But what about when the new content comes? I don't think I want to be able to stroll my way through it deleting everything with my "I win" button. So yeah I think a nerf is needed but hopefully the guns still remain powerful and fun to use.
---
I’ve shot this thing down prob 10-15 times. Half the time I get lucky and just find the thing while out exploring. If I do launch it myself however I will just run to wherever it is on the map because I hate wasting my caps fast-traveling. It will travel all over the map though which can be annoying. When I do catch up to it I try to get on the high ground and hit it with my shotgun to stop it’s mobility. If you disable each of it’s four propellors or thrusters then it will just stop moving. Then I switch to my dps rifle to finish it off.
---
Just posted this for someone else bro but here what i can do to help.
---
 Brain your talking to him. :)
---
HeroJoker1992 :D
---
Sadly it's called a blunderbuss but it's just a slighylt better black powder pistol. 
---
That would be great, I'll try to implement the list within the next week then!
---
Did one run at Morgantown earlier, no legendaries seen there.
---
I will check this! Ty
---
True. Having the commendations is an encouragement to do the enclave events. Perhaps just not allow one to be repeated before it would normally come due again on the server it was last completed on. 
---
I’d also say killing legendaries should have a different mechanic for it. For each star, buff their health a certain amount then award one point per star. Have the drop table set up to where they don’t always drop weapons or have the commendation points part of the drop table. 
---
And mostly because the games "endgame" is to get the best gear possible and whitesprings happens to be the best place for legendarys, but youre right starting to get bored of all the bugs 
---
Suggested during the beta. Very annoying indeed. Made me stop using PA outside of nuke zones. 
---
It seems to be working so far! And by chance do u know whats better for f76? Borderless window or fullscreen?
---
I did, but personally, I like the current site more. For me, it's a lot faster to access exactly what information I need. If there is a lot of demand, I could create a map too, but then again, given the low resonance on this project (which is pretty disappointing, I've launched other websites on much smaller games which boomed, but well) I probably won't invest time into an interactive map soon.
---
I’ve heard 20hr since the first time you visited it since it’s last reset. 
---
I just assume daily resets at whatever time I last cleaned them out (because it’s always the first thing I do after a reset). 
---
im getting the exact same thing happening to me..funny thing is i also just modded my PA with the targeting hud..
---
Lol, our hero and savoir!! This is the man you want to talk to. People like this truly make this game a real online community!
---
I met you yesterday in game :P
---
 
---
:D
---
Aaah our clan is about helping the community and doing anything we can for others. The chat mod just helps us find and protect people with ease. :)
---
That actually makes me feel better. Thank you. Just sucks because it’s one of the biggest things in the game. Hope it gets better. 
---
I plays every day, and I enjoy it.  Maybe you will find something you enjoy doing more than trolling one day. Or not.
---
I honestly don't know how to respond to that... but am willing to discuss it, All the buffing is to make things useful instead of a disappointment. the nerf is an already planned nerf... I'm guessing just trolling for the lols? but anyway thanks for reading
---
Melee weapons can last a good long time with the right perk.

Your comment made me feel great. I was about level 7 when I went there. I survived by baiting the bulk of the scorched out through a doorway in a single file line and bashing them. But I only barely made it out.

I just cleared the chem plant tonight as level 17 agains legendary 35 robots and felt like a goddamn hero.

Also, I feel really lonely. It seems that no one is actually playing the game... Either they powerlevel by farming Whitespring or they don't want to team up at all :(
---
Feel invited to add me, I'm on PC (CET), the name's TeddyTurner ❤️
---
You have three balls?!!
---
Depends, if you're a vats or non vats build. When you're not vats, and think normally there are multiple targets who begin looking after the 1st down, you don't have time to wait for a refresh. This is why I suggest 1 in sniper (depending on the build) because the 1st increase is like 50% and then the next lvls are only like 15% increase (I forget the exact numbers, you get what I'm saying) and so the points would be better somewhere. I also don't normally use sniper, but that's because I'm a ultra high perception vats build
---
If you could be so gracious, could I get a copy of said VATS build? Gonna roll a new char soon.
---
level 82 now, no skins or paintjobs found for it, and im usin it due to the crappy carrying capacity. im still barely able to keep the weight under the limit so i will stick with it for the unforseen future. Im also really annoyed there is no other paintjobs available. a simple black, white, red would have been enough. Now it looks like a clownsuit. If they sell other skins/paintjobs in the atomic shop, why not for the excavator? it doesnt make sense imo. That camo paintjob would make it look way more cool. 
---
So did i. That's why when the paint came out i had enough atoms to spend in order to buy it.
---
I have seen people stuck on harder missions and get help from people in chat or if anyone need any parts or plans everyone always jumps in a gives people what they need
---
One time someone was getting trolled by a group of people attacking their base and everyone joined the server (or as many before the server was full) to help defend it.
---
This is the kind thing that makes you want to play with people online.
---
 Got one today, some useless thing or other. A Super Mutie one. I did take a nice Combat Chest with 35% more resist as your health dropped a while ago.
---
As it stands now workshops offer additional supplemental resource incomes some even having factories to make items. The workshops are static areas with temporary benefits to players .. which if I need/want more than you, there needs to be a way to change hands, pvp. 
---
These workshops are highly valuable to those of us that like to reduce gathering routines by any amount possible and will kill over it plus it would irritate the player base at a much deeper level if they did not flag you into pvp .. people would simply claim as many as they could and would incentivize them to remain on the server longer forcing you to server hop for those benefits to more than likely run into more players doing it .. most of which would probably boast about it too .. I capped first na na na na. 
---
I do however believe that BGS should implement an additional method to obtain plans in a similar fashion(1-2 plans per 10-20 mins) for those not interested in pvp .. as it stands now you claim the workshop, fight the first wave .. then every 10-20 mins maybe more/less you fight another assault .. 
---
so I guess come up with a better suggestion to obtain plans in a similar way not using pvp.
---
Also right now I think there is 2 maybe 3 spots on the map that offer CAMPS two resource nodes, and none have factories .. so maybe suggest BGS offer more spots for CAMPS to obtain the more valuable resource nodes to CAMPS but remember while they can be attacked they can not be claimed so people claiming these multiple resource node locations would more than likely be continually griefed.
---
Indeed i cannot stress this message enough to people on reddit chat mod is almost a must. It opens up the game to an array of people who will do anything to help you.
---
I tried this last night after I was having the same problem as the OP and it seems to have worked.
---
I always did a gnome on a pile of chems and alcohol
---
i got 1 set of calibrated shocks for excavator at whitesprings station...the other one a random player just walked up to me and dropped it in front of me...so generous. i was going to watoga and harpers ferry server hopping for over a week with no luck there
---
Sneak+Rifle-build, tried to do it around lvl 50. The scorchbeast and all those robots that can't lose aggro completely wrecked me.

Well, if you see me (shindacore) on PC, i'll most probably drop you stimpacks and an assaultron helmet) 
---
Claiming/defending workshops. I defended a workshop in the far southwest of the map and got them.
---
That's some AI programming. AI that get's confused. 
---
But yeah, the lag has been quite bad too, so maybe it has something to do with that.
---
lol talk about overkill but very nice design it looks great .. do you still run into the occasional enemy with a pipe pistol from 900 meters away with the vision of a hawk? These are the ones that really irritate me, takes me a good couple minutes to find them sometimes hiding behind some bush or group of trees, just slowly plugging away bullet by bullet on my stuff.
---
I miss being able to drop stuff without a brown bag 
---
You slowly lose health and lose he ability to fast travel. 
---
You're welcome, pay it forward if you meet someone having the same probs :)

Will do!

Make sure he checks spam/junk. Sometimes it will end up in a weird folder. You can also call Bethesda support number and ask for support.

I feel like they will eventually undo most bans and reset us all. But there is no way of knowing.

Amazing idea dude, I really hope this gets boosted high enough for someone important to see. 
---
A few thoughts on the matter, first off let me say that reddit is a great company for the services they provide on their sites for of abled people im glad you saw my messages i posted last year around whatever time this happened again. 
---
Latro googs 
---
Here here! I second this .. like the power plants but incentivize players to finish the additional challenges with maybe plans and or additional resources/weapons etc. Good suggestion.
---
Sometimes if you kill a Legendary too fast the game will just transfer the Legendary loot to the next available corpse...idk it's weird like that.
---
You can search the Bethesda support number and ask for support. They are not to helpful but it's worth a shot. 
---
Ohhh that's what that song means … I need to go eat again out of carbs again
---
There is a perk for heavy gun that ignore 45% armor and increase accuracy too but you have to play with PA too
---
If anyone receives an email reply please keep us all updated. I haven't heard of anyone's appeals being responded to yet. 
---
AH ok, that explains a lot actually, because in the past I have had so many cases where legendary enemies don't drop their loot. I just probably haven't looked at the next corpse I make, so I have missed it totally.

2 spots I found that usually drop building plans is just a little SW of the dam up north .. there's a small shack in the woods with a toolbox and an iron resource node .. that toolbox usually has a plan in it.
---
Another place is SE of the top of the world on the road . couple of display cases there usually have a plan in them or near them. Or you could vendor hop like the other posters suggest although harpers ferry seems to have a higher chance for me to see them.
---
Probably because NPC's add SO MUCH to the game. Giving you characters to care about, whether you hate them or love them, further giving your choices/actions weight.
---
Of course, without NPC's and no way whatsoever to affect the world, it just became much cheaper and easier for Bethesda to churn out FO76.
---
The only current way to do it is to add an atom store skin to the item.
---
Wait.. You don’t?!?
---
You're still being overly dramatic.  No doubt that's a trend in your life.
---
I don't have the PA targeting hud and this still happens to me. Not as much but i would say at least 5 times a per 4 hour period of play.
---
I’m beginning to think that they don’t know how to solve the stability issues. I knew it wasn’t all because of the dupers. Every time I run a silo or launch a nuke I dc. Every. Single. Time.
---
I don't know man, I did that Quest a long time ago and got  all rise and since have gotten rid of it, somehow all the protectrons and assaultrons are still hostile to me
---
As someone who doesn't use TSE or melee - if option 3 doesn't work for you, you aren't trying hard enough.
---
Also, by your statement, if nerfing TSEs is not the solution to balancing this equation, then the real issue is that every other ranged legendary prefix in the game needs to be buffed in line with the roughly +300% damage boost over normal weapons that TSEs normally enjoy.
---
And I will agree with you on one point - right now, the SBQ is largely only manageable due to the presence of these god weapons. This is a separate issue that I'm sure will need to be addressed. One single fight shouldn't dictate what build you go, though.
---
Like let's say this was any MMORPG, and at the moment, wizards could kill everything in a single hit. This includes other players, most dungeon bosses, with the lone exception being a single fight in a single dungeon at the end of the game. Would you want to keep playing a game where you couldn't change your class, if the studio's silent response said, "Actually we intend for everybody to reroll as wizards if they are interested in being practical later in the game."
---
Trust me, the dust will settle, the game will still be there, and despite the moaning heard across the lands, the game will be more solid from the change. It's honestly something they should have figured out before beta was over.
---
If many people have already said it why make another post? Just go an comment on the original post. All this sub is filled with now is people repeating eachother.
---
Nearly every post starts with 'As many people have already said/asked'
---
Yeah not me though. Didn’t have enough time to play it at that time
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Generally not worth getting other than the ammo factory. Every workshop gives you resources slowly over time and enables PvP while you control it. It's much better to just explore and loot things that have the materials.
---
Assaultron helmet gives you face laser....maybe....no? Ok then
---
Someone said he spawns east of the ferris wheel near an overturned bus.
---
its supressed for 60 min. then the neg. effects return
---
I only play in 3P to look for resource nodes, but do all my combat and looting in 1P
---
It suppresses the negative effects for an hour. After the hour is up the negative effects will be present.
---
I thought Wise Mothman was chill until he attacked me.
---
Before Tse were mainstream, I used to kill every melee with my automatic grenade launcher and it was pretty effective
---
Great idea, but would it be immune to nukes? 
---
Or would this open a new side of PvP. Your bridge example, say the event is completed and the bridge is in place. Team x try to nuke the bridge, new event: take out team x/protect or rebuild the bridge.

NEEEEERRRDDDDDDD!!!!!

nice job .. we need BGS to implement mini games like GTA(pool, tennis, gold, darts etc etc) to play against other players where one of us doesn't end up dead to be victorious .. although maybe allow the victor to cannibalize the loser cause I still need to eat.
---
Although you realize if you beat someone with your CAMP chess they'll prolly just drop party equip wrecking ball and … well I'm sure it'll turn out fine.

the shiny dragons on the paint window paint

lowering a special has no effect on perk cards by means like this, only what benefit that special would have ingame...int effecting durability in crafting/repair for example
---
RemindME! 3 hours “Nuka paint”
---
I would accept this as long as I have the choice NOT to join the server I just left.
---
I just had a fucked up issue happen. I went to my camp, got out of my PA to save fusion cores.
---
Server Disconnected.
---
Waited the new 10 minutes to load back in and I already knew what was gonna happen sort of.
---
My camp is near a cliff and I fall to my death so before quitting I get back in it. Well due to the disconnect I wasn't able to do that. So I fell to my death because of the game's poor programming.
---
Server disconnect #2 before I could get my junk back.
---
Waited 10 minutes to load.
---
Fell to my death again plus my camp was gone because somebody else was in my spot. Since I didn't have any junk to get I wasn't gonna respawn so I disconnected.
---
It reconnected me to the same server 3 times. So that's a half hour of load screens right there on top of the other few. I didn't have my camp in any of those same server connects so I kept leaving the game in hopes I would get my camp back.
---
I wasted an hour doing nothing and if I couldn't leave the server my camp was fucked or else I'm now finding a new camp which is not what I want to do.
---
and if i get this perk (-75% negative effects of mutations or smth) will it lower int to -1/2 instead of -4?
---
no, perks are not affected, but other Int benefits like better weapon condition while crafting/looting , such kind of stuff
---
You kids... I have a ton of stuff on my person at any time. I have so much ammo just from trying to not be over encumbered in my earlyer game play that i now just run around with a full selection wheel of weapons. I currently can carry 325 Lb's. My stash being as limited as it is is almost always full. especially since i keep one of each magazine and bobble head, for collection purposes not for using. 
---
I died the other day after having been surrounded by 6 scorch beasts and there lovely lovely sonic boom spam, fell into a fissure and lost well more then 2000 items worth of junk.  just a couple days ago i lost even more then that, 500 steel, 100 lead, 100 screws, 100 gears, 100 springs, 25 nuclear material and some other junk that  ended up being about 150 Lb's of scrap. 
---
Unless you meant to say that the player you killed for no real reason, Had 1000's of each item. Frankly i think you kids need to find something better to do other then griefing other players. Bethsda might be a shit show atm, but they are banning people for duping if you suspect someone of this banable offence why not just get a quick video and send it to bethsda c.s.
---
Excellent idea .. also could make it up for loss every month or so, huge assault for the same time period and if we overall don't complete it, we would loss it and have to rebuild again the next time we win the assault. This could actually save them face by bringing full circle their whole 'rebuilding' theme.
---
Jesus, chuck some RadAway 
---
yep, it would be no problem at all with lv 1 weapons. Just more ammos and time consuming.  I've soloed lv50 SB when I got lv 3 Sneak perk at lv 32 or 33.
---
Found muggy!
---
I'm up for helping too, done a few nukes solo but want to try some in a group as not many enemies spawn solo!
---
Which time zone are you in? 
---
may be different gaming device, OP did not specify, as 90% of the posters.
---
That's cool, time to get that chat mod, I guess, and since you are on my FL already I'll give you my spare plans, too. 
---
I used to dump them in the first overseer cache but you never know if someone's going to find them. 
---
Your AP is also reduced by half for hunger and thirst too all the way down to zero. So no sprinting 
---
It’s super realistic... well aside from the fact my character hasn’t slept in weeks.
---
Also being low lessens your AP bar 
---
"For example, 2-shot at its current state is not overpowered" - it is just much more powerful than any other legendary.
---
That is what makes it overpowered.
---
Pretty sure they mean his meat with that song
---
I’m a bit scared of mods, with the risk of getting banned
---
No, I legitimately have 31,433 copies of Super Duper for trade.
---
They will always show up as "red" but they won't attack you.
---
Gun Fu along with Adrenaline makes this build super powerful.   I sometimes enjoy those perks combo, though I prefer targeting enemies by myself. 
---
This entire game is horrendously unbalanced. I mean let's not forget that it's still basically not possible to even go into a nuke zone in regular armor, or that energy weapons break so quickly that they are essentially unusable, or that you can't craft any explosives from gunpowder and steel, or that the MG42 fires .308 rounds which cost more to craft than .50 rounds, but do less damage when fired out of a machine gun, but more damage when fired out of a sniper rifle. That's not even mentioning the fact that at least half the perks in the game aren't worth slotting for any build, or are only good when you slot them in only while performing the specific activity they boost.
---
They basically need to rebuild the system from the ground up in more than one place to make this game make sense as an MMO. I love Fallout, and I enjoyed playing this game, but there is no way for this to transition to a service game with multi year staying power like ESO if they don't put systems in it that can support a smooth progression curve and reasonable build diversity.
---
And the enormous amount of food/water I have to consume. 
---
RTM
---
I have technical data. Wtf do I do with 
---
How about adding back DR on helmets like EVERY prior FO game. 
---
Hahaha! Mini games would be great! And you can't really have fun until your CAMP gets a little destroyed! 😂
---
I think it should be immune to nukes during construction, but other players can come and try to destroy the bridge essentially becoming the raiders of the game, then that would activate the quest to protect the bridge before it gets completely destroyed and you need to start over. But once it's done, it's done... Adding to this it could be a VS sort of thing, if the player raiders managed to stop construction on the bridge on the majority of servers maybe we fail at the end of the event and it's a broken bridge in the world. 1-0 to the raider scum
---
With all the duping and hacking going on by griefers, the game's player base is dwindling fast and those that are left are hesitant to interact with anyone. Until pure co-op servers or private servers without PvP are available, you are going to see a decease in nice people and an increase in jerks. If it doesn't come soon, most if the nicer folks will have moved on to other games.
---
You can still kill them and collect XP/Loot/Scrap without repercussion after the quest. They remain hostile, but they will not attack.
---
I've actually managed to take down several legendary protectrons without issue after completing the quest.
---
I crash a few times per hour with about a 10 minute loading time back into the game.
---
I'd take the pre patch back in a heartbeat. This is far worse.
---
Later yesterday I unlocked the charging barrel for the Tesla, so I can put that on for 50 caps if you want it. Does about 50% more damage.
---
Or mama dolce herself, "if mama aint happy, nobody happy"
---
I need a please kill me emote I just had to search 15 servers for someone to remove my bounty... I did get some new legendary equipment along the way but still it took way too long.
---
I more imagine they will nerf special stacking to have diminishing returns, so having 30+ strength will no longer be a thing
---
&gt;A lot of what I’ve said is going to be unpopular here with a lot of people, but if you’ve made it this far without either leaving a premature comment or downvote then you may agree with me, and here’s where the important stuff is, where we can actually help shape the future of the game.
---
Well I gave you a downvote because it's getting way too old to see people yapping this bullshit about two shots or explosive weapons when it's obvious they have no idea what they are talking about.
---
Yeah bro happy to i act like the community stash for the chat mod anyway. The idea came about with all the server crashes it was pointless putting the items around since the servers are so unstable anyway. Most of the time people won't get them.
---
So i spend time every login making a message every 10-30 mins to find people in need.

I see Fleece Johnson is still taking booty.

They already do, it's called spazzing out on your A and D keys so you seize in place.

So TSE is not broken? What kind of experience you have about TSE, level 1 pipe pistol TSE?
---
I never said anything about thinking they’re good or bad. The point of my message is get over it. People have opinions good and bad, if you don’t like it, North Korea has some excellent waterfront properties
---
I have 3 sets. Excavator, X01, Ultracite. No mixed pieces anywhere.
---
I recently discovered if the inventory sort is set to default where it lists in alphabetical order, the chasis are also in said order. 
---
ex. If I have all 3 sets in my inventory or in storage, the first(or the one displayed top most) will be excavator, #2 will be ultracite, 3rd will be x01.

Hell right now I'd take a display case that worked like the bobble head display in fo4 where they just click into it. Basically it would have "display slots" they would just be built into the case so you couldn't move or physically interact with them. 
---
I don't accept invites since I'll lose maxed Lone Wanderer. Not worth it to me. 
---
Yeah I like this idea, it would make the player more engaged with its forever changing, side swapping world. Picture this: You make a settlement in game, player raiders try to destroy that settlement (possibly try to rebuild it for themselves) they fail, we build the settlement up, everythings fine for around a month. Suddenly a monthly event starts and they can try to take over your settlement making it a raider faction base.
---
I started to look for a good melee weapon after last inside the vault. %40 swing speed deathclaw claw works wonders so far, actually I use it more than any other guns I own since ammo is wasted on anything level40 or less. No perk for unhanded but I eat some melee damage boosting food and I can still kill level 68 normal enemies with 2-3 swings to the head. They can't do anything since they stagger. Meanwhile I deal same damage with my lever action gun and still consume 2-3 shots, enemy doesn't give a shit and still jumps on me and deals damage. Cons? no. Stronger than ranged builds?  no but stronger than most, and will be strongest after TSE nerf.
---
The problem is, they'll also nerf melee weapons when we look at the course of actions they took so far. At some point it'll happen.
---
Then what, I'm not going to able to kill more than 3 enemies at once. I can deal with that somehow. But Queen won't die in time limit. Legendary enemies are already regenerating faster than my bullet shots (I don't own an explosive)
---
Unless they make explosive and two shot more frequent and give them away far more easily, I can't see big bosses coming in future dropping either. I don't want to be overpowered, but either they have to give away same damage output to wider range of players instead of few lucky (or few dupers) or nerf the shit out of enemy resistances. 5 players dealing +%50 aoe is better than one player dealing +%200 aoe. It would be a better balance and still would nerf solo experience at same time.
---
I hope energy weapons will be a thing potentially. They need to be boosted in a way or two. They could make them totally armor penetrating without any extra perks-mods. weapon condition buff is a must too. I want to see lasers shot at queen.
---
Two shot isn’t that OP for guns by itself IMO, compared to melee, but it does outclass every other affix for guns IMO which isn’t great for balance. The part of the argument that irks me when people say “melee doesn’t have range” well it CAN have power armor, which makes you nearly invincible. That’s something I don’t get the option of using as a stealth rifle build, I really need that extra DPS because I’m a glass cannon. All this will make me do is waste more ammo and backpedal more. Good thing I maxed a melee build too I guess.
---
The power armor exhibition is my favorite thing in Fallout4😹
---
Sounds really good but I’ve never been one for sneaking, and wouldn’t it mean that you’d  kill the first enemy quickly but then you’d be detected and lose lots of the perks?
---
Or is the idea to use silenced weapons and sneak around silently assassinating everything?
---
In game on the SPECIAL screen it says it
---
Better than tse? Like seriously? As you t have a se wasn't op enough, with most guns 1shotting 99% of the available enemies.. 
---
I can agree that the game needs balance, but it needs to be a gradual thing. Lowering the t
---
Two shot by 75% is a total knee jerk reaction, and shows that the developers don't have much experience balancing for an online game.
---
Lower the damage by 25% and fix the viability of other ranged options by buffing them.
---
Taking all the weight off one side of the scale when the other side doesn't have enough to begin with isn't an efficient way to balance.
---
What is love? Baby, don't hurt me.. don't hurt me.. no more!
---
This is awesome. I'm sure you had [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xqfC80SRGU#t=20) in mind while building. 
---
My favorite spot is the room in Watoga Civic Center that's filled with a million baskets with a single note on the desk that says, "FINALLY! ALL THE BASKETS!"
---
Im trading one if anyone is interested
---
Bobbleheads stacking is a bug. One of the loading screen tips says that reusing one refreshes the timer, doesn't say that both the effects stack. As soon as that's fixed it will be all good. And the nerf to the weapons is needed in a afraid (and that's coming from someone who uses a two shot Gauss rifle) because this isn't a singleplayer game like FO4 so things being completely broken isn't good for the game.
---
How much?
---
Look I'm not calling for a Nerf to melee. I think people should reap the benefits of slogging into battle. Yeah I rock PA90% of the time but still with zero dedication to melee and a weapon picked solely on weight and I can slug my way through most encounters. 
---
😂😂😂 That made my night, thank you!!!!
---
And there it goes the fall of the competetive aspect of fallout 76.....
---
I know I am up in the 40s on Int when I am crafting PA for people.
---
I try to do the same thing for luck when fighting the Queen so, if I do get a good drop, it has crazy max cond.
---
I could see it, but, nerfing stat stacking isn't enough (though, I expect unyielding won't give a +3 by the end of this).
---
Sure, except people aren't much into using fatmans as its rather difficult to find or craft the ammo in significant quantities. It's occasional fun thing to use though.
---
Wouldn’t expect anything less from Nerfout76
---
There's a legendary modifier you can get on armor that will reduce fall damage by 20 percent. Its helped with my non pa mutant. I have marsupial and its saved my life a couple times. 
---
Exploration and grinding buddy. This game lacks story and caters more towards gameplay. Which is lack luster to say the least. 
---
Congrats dude. 
---
Mindless grinding. There is no depth to the game, what you see is what you get, literally. So if you’re not having fun now, then it will be a disappointing experience for you.
---
Do you honestly think that the dupers are gonna go "Oh well, now that duping is fixed, I might as well play the game normally" no, they won't, they'll leave because a vast majority of them, in particular the ones selling things for real world money never cared about the game in the first place, they just saw an opportunity to make a quick buck. 
---
I had turrets and they are less than useless. Scorched/mutants just take shots from outside the range. 
---
It's sad that people are so used to singleplayers with a hand-holding quests line that they have no idea what to do in a sandbox survival game. 
---
I literally have 5 Fix it Good cards that I can't combine because they're either maxed out already or they're animated and not animated so I can't combine them.
---
Switching to and from perks when crafting and repairing in the INT tree for me is extremely annoying, especially when I accidentally click on the level 1 Fix it Good card by accident.
---
One of the ingame tips states that it refreshes your timer. 
---
Someone suggested in another post to allow some kind of "trade-in" system that you can trade in cards you don't want for either a new random card or the ability to select a card you would like.  
---
But being able to thin out some unused cards and potentially acquire a more useful card would make for a nice QOL feature.
---
Maybe but I only know it spawns at the station
---
Some developments have arisen after the dev room fiasco. I found these images on a Eurogamer article by Emma Kent on 17/01/19.

Yes, And with the 5.0 cal heavy weapon that will last 10 seconds. Its not as glorious as you think!!
---
I want a bathtub with nuka-cola quantums 
---
Yep, it's great for that. You on PS4?
---
I wish they would make inventory objects placeable in camp. Have them take up budget and have a reasonable limit of how many items you can place so the physics of 10000 bottle caps trying to settle in a tub doesn't crash the server.
---
I am on PS4 and I don't accept invites because I do my own thing, but I will help out lower level players, really any level player. I don't usually have a headset. I also read the stories of all the stuff people get from players but I never get this or got this. I do have one character who is now level 70 and it is much easier to get weapons, aid, ect so I always dropped off items at the overseer's camp or Flatwoods and in the overseer's caches in different areas. I rarely run into folks but when I do I offer trades but at zero caps or drop stuff by them. Oh I will also put stuff into the government supply drops. 
---
good bot
---
Wait a second, weren’t previous fallout titles also single player survival sandbox?
---
Scrooke mcduckin it.
---
Hey you can't use logic on reddit  &gt;:|
---
It's 50% and it stacks.
---
I have two pieces of armor with the acrobat effect, free fall? Whatever it's called in this game. 50% works okay, 100% works the best. Zero fall damage no matter how high you jump.
---
Gotta think balance mate, even if only temporarily thats a death sentence to a player with Ghoulish Mutation active since they'll be killed quickly, permanently will be filled with trolls and griefers ruining mutation style players, we already lost some melees with the nerf doubt you want mutations gone too.
---
Theres no reason not to allow PVE only servers. None.
---
You can find side quest while exploring abandoned ruins and factory 
---
But I highly recommend doing quests with friends - It’s kind of boring to do it alone 
---
But... I like not needing to expend 1000 rounds of ammo or have to repair my weapon inbetween each enemy...
---
I was thinking more like ESO
---
Maybe a giant robot made out by multiple liberators joined together. 
---
Sorry been awhile since I logged in and looked. 
---
Exactly the way I feel about it. You don’t need to kill *everyone* to have the Scorched be a serious threat, just have us assist some factions who are barely hanging on - the BOS, Sons of Dane, The Free States, the ones you would expect to see survive for the longest. Even have a few surviving pockets of Responders out there. 
---
Then can justify it in the lack of NPCs however they like, but that doesn’t mean it was a good idea in the first place. Bethesda began their story at a point *past* the heroism and self sacrifice, past the rising stakes. They turned us into a post conflict pathologist. While that may make for some nice moments of loneliness and pathos, it also squashes any feeling that you can influence or effect the world. 
---
I would say 8/10 locations in the game I thought ‘man, I wish I’d been here when x went down,’, but you never are, and that’s a problem. Sure, there’s a threat to the rest of the country but that’s vague and impossible to get invested in. Imagine how cool it would’ve been to turn up at Fort Defiance with BOS soldiers fighting off a scorchbeast attack, then wander inside afterwards and see how bad of a shape they’re in by their lack of supplies, casualties, and plummeting morale. 
---
Bethesda’s claim of ‘but we want players to be the NPCs!’ is really disingenuous when they give you no tools to support role playing. Not to mention no sense of permanence in the world as every game brings a new server, and there’s literally one quest I can think of that changes the player’s world in any appreciable way. Not to mention a 24(?) player cap if we’re supposed to be the ones to form factions and populate the world? 
---
I will always believe that they just couldn’t get NPCs to work online in the FO4 engine/didn’t have the time to do it. Logically, there was no reason to strip the game of NPCs otherwise. It’s too oddly divisive a choice to be anything more than ‘shit, we gotta spin this somehow.’ It baffles me that they made FO76 canon, as if it wasn’t people wouldn’t bat an eyelid at Bethesda’s choice to include every existing enemy type, have specialised, prototype guns from FO4 present, to shoehorn the BOS in, to have all this nuke lobbing that somehow went unnoticed by the rest of the wasteland. 
---
From everything I heard you won't get banned using mods, unless they are cheat mods. A few youtubers and articles I read said you may get banned for mods but you shouldn't and if you do Bethesda would remove the ban. Just don't use cheat engines or cheating mods.
---
Read notes, pickup tapes listen to them, talk to (some) robots.
---
Fallout 76 is a game based around open world exploring, so that's 70% of what you're supposed to do.
---
If you're looking to buy one you could look around here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/)
---
Tse ones are pretty strong but are about to get nerfed.
---
and Gift emote
---
What will attack you when you also remove the turrets and anything touching the ground?
---
I’m trying to set a similar build for my charachter but I want to add some points to perception beceause I like use scope. Thanks for the tips
---
Why because fixing the obvious broken builds removes the competitive aspect of the game?
---
How does that work?
---
r/sips
---
Do whatever you want. It's your world. It's not a linear game
---
Idk 1k Caps?
---
That's an accomplishment! I like plodding along solo. 
---
This would be great. I just had my first CTD as I was about to run to the SBQ event. I was getting spammed by an SB and my game crashed. Crash #10,503. Deleted the whole game, see if a full reinstall helps.
---
Another good feature to have would be selecting regions to lock you into joining servers in your area. I'm in Australia and **ONLY** connect to North American servers.
---
It worked for several mmo, it's a nice feature. But with players not linked to a specific server, I don't think it fits this game. If you participate and fully rebuild something, it might be broken on your next server and you won't gain any benefits.
---
You mean besides the fact they would have to redo how claims work? Or that it was not designed as a PVE only game?
---
But let's go back. You stated you wanted it to prevent people from griefing you. I stated that it is just a band-aid and won't really fix that or trolls since they would still find a way around that, since you know, that is a common thing even in pve games and has been since like the 90s. (I know, I used to grief and get people killed on pve games). 
---
You are not fixing a problem by wishing it goes away based on that, this is an online game. It will happen regardless unless you get a private server with just friends, or they improve the block feature. 
---
Heavy Weapons in general need a lot of love. 
---
I run around in an X-01 with a variety of HWs because I thought it would have been fun to play a Space Marine Devistator.... Yeah, I was wrong.
---
I end up using a shot gun, or my handmade 95% of the time while being fully specced for heavy weapons. I don't even have any melee perks and All Rise at lvl 50 is more efficient than my 50 cal.
---
M’utant.
---
Forces you into limited builds. If everyone is equal.....
---
I dread server hopping in case of crashing, the loading takes forever and a day. FO 76 hasn't got long before some big titles drop, so if it doesn't lift it's game the temptation to move on will get easier.
---
No you can not. You can't exceed the CAMP circle. However. I have noticed when you claim a workshop they come with a abundnce of **workshop specific** materials to help you start building. This normally excludes certain resources such as **nuclear waste** for creating fusion generators. 
---
24 hours ago I’d have taken that, I think I spent up down to 250c yesterday, if you still have it when I’ve raised the capital I’ll take it. (Currently levelling an alt to 15 but this might be quicker). Can you get on later today?
---
A-T-O-M-I-C  S-H-O-P
---
Atom store
---
Most legendary for me just drop armor. I had a three star legendary the other day drop a fuse. 😕
---
Haha ofc players of this game have useless degrees
---
Is atom store the only way to get them?
---
Well not really for me, even at level 30 you won't always have what you need. Yes they should know what they are doing but not everyone good at the game.
---
Hit me up later 
---
RemindME! 2 hours “handmade plans”
---
Maybe, if you weren't banned than i suggest getting almost everything you duped on an alt and deleting the alt. Hope this'll save you from ban in the future.
---
I’ve been sever hopping west tek and out of about 10 attempts I’ve seen a couple of 2/3 star enemies, the RNG isn’t with me 
---
Just make bobbleheads and magazines not stack, but instead only prolong the time the buff is up. Problem solved.
---
You're using reddit anti-social wrong - you're whining about lack of interaction but not posting your contact info / schedule.
---
I have the same issue, I just stick them in the overseer's caches knowing players will eventually go to one doing the overseer's quest. I usually hit up Overseer's camp and Flatwoods first.
---
Hell if i got nothing for it woukd be fine with me as well, long as im rid of all the ones i dont want
---
Wut?
---
Go grab yourself a gatling gun. 80 dmg per round and a nice slow tempo. 
---
Or the Tesla science when no enemy uses plasma weaponry and lasers are utter shit
---
Would be nice of they added a scorchbeast king to the game..like a raid event after the queen has been killed
---
I see what you mean... The way I picture it the settlement or bridge (and faction ownership) will be consistent across all servers until the event is next started up by Bethesda.
---
Same here. Been looking for ages only ever see the brick set. When ever I play the game (every day) I do the Watoga, Harpers, Bunker, stations run. Seeing the same stuff all the time. Haven't even seen the metal walls again, luckily I have them already from a workshop quest.
---
I usually use the thumbs up and follow me emotes and the trade and hi emotes. Of course it doesn't always work so I just put items in the overseer's caches, government supply drops. Sometimes I put them in random crates, mailboxes, ect.
---
Who loves to play a game that is designed around building your character to be most powerful, to get hit with nerf after nerf making them weaker and weaker. Nobody. That's who.
---
No sympathy for dupers and i really hope you got banned. But if not please drop all duped items and learn from this as many have been banned for exploiting the game.
---
Welcome back to the community please consider others this time.
---
Goat legs perk reduces fall damage. Rank 1 by 40%, Rank 2 by 80%.
---
Similarly, I would love to see them add the ability to design a custom power armor paint job. You can customize your livery in car games, why not your PA? It's just a skin as well, so again, decent amount of work, but I think it'd be a cool feature. 
---
I’m going to sleep but don’t worry I have like 20 of them I Farm them with an alt..And I’m at max caps so I will not be selling any anytime soon.
---
You can land sneak crits in caution, and with 15 agil 75% sneak bonus you can basically stand on a monster without them going to danger
---
Such a budget army. Why build big robots when we can have army of small one who can control anything robotic :D
---
Have not seen that card pop up yet., in fact I don't think my 80+ character has it in the stack
---
Ha nice, how many is max caps? My alt is l14 so I’ll probably just do that instead, thanks anyway!
---
A goal I’m going to work towards this week. 
---
What was the most challenging trophy to get? 
---
No questions but like the other lad congrats man i know platinums are top tier things on PlayStation i belive.
---
Could always tie it in with a daily reset like our daily quests.  Once you get 5 or 10 or whatever that’s all you can amass that day.
---
The plans exist yes, but I think no mods are available from the vendors.
---
Yeah, I didn't think I had it and checked today and it was there. I just got to level 50 so I sorted through all my perks today to be a non PA build. Definitely keep an eye out for it.
---
25,000. Yeah Watoga vendor Phoenix bot and Harper Fairy best place to Farm Plan good luck!
---
It's in agility Judy so you know
---
There is also a challenge to kill an alien in one of the kill human like enemy challenges I think 
---
The most challenging? The collect 20 magazines one for certain. I couldnt find any for the life of me. Found my FIRST magazine at level like...70.
---
Lol, I thought you were burning Todd in effigy 
---
Thank you very much! It's my second one (after bloodborne) and i just wanna brag :D
---
To add to this: when they add player factions into the game if you're part of your own faction that you've created and isn't part of the lore world (BoS, Raiders, Responders) you can select which in world factions can enter your settlement without initiating PvP.
---
You know which abilities are going to get nerfed, if you build around this kind of character, you know it won't last.
---
So, you got a choice, either, build this, and accept the nerf, or, building something else and don't get nerfed or.... build this, and then complain that it is unfair, and you didn't know they would nerf it.
---
Well, you know they will nerf it, so..... I wouldn't suggest the 3rd option.
---
Well, I’ve got that one already, so I guess I’m set. Other than waiting for a nuke drop.
---
Well happy to play into it man i know platinums are not easy to get.
---
If you're on PS4 i can help you with that :)
---
the speed at which you get thirsty and hungry with no perks it's also very unrealistic
---
When it does that helicopter style take off, knocking back people too close.
---
I am, was going to do it when I launched my own nuke last week. But I was so over the weight limit...
---
I'm on PS4. I'd add you if I could though :(
---
There already is context in the game - don’t want to spoil it, but an optional objective to the main missions brings you somewhere that explains why liberators are in the world. 
---
Weight management is the real endgame. In the words of dead money, let it go. Get rid of all that stuff you dont need!
---
Excellent! the 500% was there to see if people actually read the thing, 300% is what I was truly thinking for it since it would take 31 connective hits to achieve those numbers and a single hit would ruin the combo resetting to 0 and the 300 is to be the counter to the difficulty of achieving that many hits even with automatic weapons, before the target dies or you miss due to it flying away. 2-shot in its current state is on par with Bloodied, anti-armor, and quad for some weapons. As for the cards going to +10 +5 +5 feels weak for how precious Points are with the 57 point cap and I should address that issue on my change list. Also with the current Caps on critters levels being as they are, currently we can 1-2 shot boop nearly everything in the game. That is 2 more things that I neglected to consider making my post, thank you for your assistance.
---
Just explore! There's great environmental story telling in this game
---
Did you find the memo to the company earlier in the building asking about all the missing waste baskets?
---
I had a bad experience there being level 25 against lvl 40 miners.
---
I’m lvl 90 and still avoid the place
---
Power Armour negates fall damage completely...
---
That view is one of the most amazing things ever. The base looks so cosy especially the bedroom with the different floor style and the windows looking out over Appalachia!
---
Grahm sells it most of the time 
---
Aaah yes the red rocket way from South Park i see...
---
You gonna have to wait until after the nerf to test both.
---
No u
---
Yeah, my next run I’m just going to take my nicer rifle, All Rise, a backup melee weapon, stimpacks, food and water. That should give me plenty of extra room if a good Legendary or two drop for me.
---
I love it. Have my upvote! 
---
There's a [mod for it](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/137), if you're on PC.  Saved myself a ton of worry!
---
No but for real you're right, I've been a part of this mess, I'd understand completely if I got banned or reset,  and have already learned my lesson when they patched the carry weight glitch 
---
I think we all miss been able to display object. And placing dead bodies in funny positions. Those were the days. 
---
The biggest issue for me is bounty put on players that kill other players and there isn't a limit to get revenge. I have been shot at a few times and honestly it isn't a big deal to me since you only drop junk. I usually don't have a lot of junk on me unless someone catches me before I reach a train station, my camp or the few other spots that has a players stash box. I will fast travel away from the person chasing me/attacking me then block them for the session, if it got too bad I switched servers.
---
While they're at it they can nerf VATS crits, and everything that does any kind of damage. I'll play the build I have always been playing, and always been building. And if they want to chase people away from the game, there's plenty other games to play. 
---
I filled mine with Vim .
---
Did you pick up the forest camo in game or thru a trade? 
---
I have some on PS4 
---
What's your loadout like? Theres probably a way to cut some weight there
---
I used to collect Teddy bears since fallout 3.
---
Like a lot of Teddy bears. I always had my bed full of bears and in 3 there was 3-4 bigger ones than the usual. I had them all. :’)
---
I miss that so much. :(
---
This game is now very similar to Diablo 3, where you focus on getting better gear and levelling up. What little quests we have are fun and their stories are pretty cool, if you are paying attention. Events are deffo underused (save for Uranium one).
---
My god, imagine being that much of an ass and nuking the bridge! Bounty of 1000 caps incomin.
---
Are you trying to build from a blueprint or stored? You may be over your budget limit.
---
I just need one more for the Platinum. Kill 20 players.... shows how much I go around and try to fight. 
---
Awesome map! Thank you!
---
Any chance you can add iron? 
---
You are only in full pvp at the workshop 
---
YTA.
---
I’ve never understood players not wanting to share bases.
---
You’re asking for someone to two shot this into oblivion.
---
This post is actually so weird. People upvote because they think I'm mocking Todd, but other upvote because they think I'm praising him. Others just like the flamingos. There is so much going on!
---
I like the idea of a group event changing the servers, but I have a problem with it being permanent. 
---
What if you are unlucky and only get logged into servers where the project is already completed? Many players are on serveral hours a day, some don't have the time for that. Also, if you create a new character you mgiht wanna have the chance to do this event again. People maybe buy the game a year from now, and many reasons more.
---
yup disconnects have been so frequent its too easy to lose too much progress rn
---
I have a Fire Axe mod. Puncturing spikes.
---
As a heavily mutated BOS member, I think this is a bad idea
---
Suck it enclave!!!!
---
I'll help. PSN?
---
Totally not the first person to say that lol, ive gotten Steve Mean a few times as well. Its my old DJ name and it just stuck with me over the years. I used to be a lot nicer. I did however get pretty pissed about the nerf, more than I should have. I still think its stupid, its like they want this game to be something its not (fortnite) instead of trying to be unique. Even after the nerf the TSE will be pretty good dont worry. Its all my non explosive two shots that are taking a big hit. I just stashed them. 
---
Also most vendors share caps, you should be able to find a faction vendor guide though. they'll reset every 20 hours
---
Everyone is equal. They just use same OP builds. There is no variety any more.
---
I don't understand the math behind this build. So sneak attacks give you 2.5 multiplier, crit damage bonuses stack up to 85%, and a  standard 15% from bloody mess.  
---
And the base critical damage is x2, right? So your 50 damage from rifle should become roughly 50 x 2.5 x 2 x 1.85 = 462, right? And also a headshot which I believe is x2, so it's about 900 damage per shot?
---
From my stored. I don’t have any blueprints saved.
---
they got mods my guy
---
It's a great art installation, it makes people ask questions and everyone kind of sees and thinks different things about it. Bravo. 
---
Bethesda: for the 4000th time NO YOU CANNOT!!!!!
---
I carry two many weapons, I know that already.
---
All Rise, Junkie’s Grognak axe (recent), sniper rifle (hunters), combat shotgun (probably gonna drop) leaver action exterminators rifle (going to sell), I carry about 10-15 each of med-x/radaway/rad-x and their diluted versions, and a god awful amount of water and stim packs. 
---
Oh dont worry i didn't give up i never will, but there is a time and a place to complain about it, right now is not one of them since it has Nothing to do with the topic at hand.
---
Aren't these guaranteed world spawns? You could just look up the locations online
---
Then it is possible your stored base uses more than your currently allowed budget for it
---
Second bullet doesn’t get buffs from perks and does plain base damage, also it is much more inaccurate and reduces VATS accuracy.
---
I am currently using BLoodied Explosive weapons as much more reliable in damage output and accuracy.
---
Imagine renaming a shitty handmade as " * Two Shot Explosive Anti-Armour Handmade" and selling
---
PMd
---
Whenever it won't let m place my camp, I usually get one of a few messages, it's weird that you don't.
---
But for me, it's either "Floating," " Needs Support," or "Intersects."
---
I haven't found a fix for the first 2 besides scrapping and rebuilding though sadly.
---
Although, maybe it's a budget issue? If something accidentally Duped, then you wouldn't be able to place your Camp.
---
Sorry, couldn't be of any help.
---
They can spawn at Grahm and raider vendors. Also I have some on PS4 
---
I get it a lot claiming workshops
---
I used to love vats and its a cool feature but for some reason I kinda hate it in this one. I use the sneak bonus all the time tho. 
---
Only good thing about stash limit is that you can get lucky and buy legendarys at vendors that other players sell to make room sometimes. One man's trash...
---
I got a decent western revolver and a nice perfect storm from whitesprings station. I hope that the next stash increase will happen acompanied by the player vending they announced. Haven't found any good legendaries by myself, so i need a source to buy them instead.
---
Atom Shop or Centennial Edition/Upgrade.
---
Science has gone too far
---
Changing server now
---
You would kinda have to be dull not to realize there are no legendary effects on the weapon tho lol
---
Had same problem until some guy nuked white springs. Went from level 14 to level 30 and am now level 80 just from playing alot, explore and kill things basically or just get someone to nuke white springs and put a bullet in every glowing one and wait for higher levels to kill them to get xp
---
Pistols seem pretty interesting for pvp build, cause you maximize Dodgy and want to maximize AP. Not so many great perks in A so pistol damage bonus might help to fill cards.
---
Holy hell. I'm level 55 and I still haven't seen a single behemoth, let alone a horde.
---
Maybe you carrying hundreds of pounds of loot without a backpack across an irradiated world is more realistic?
---
Also has a cool feel to it. 
---
Yea i know, i just thought it would be a funny potential scam. The kind where you would be like "you fell for what?!?!?"
---
Except full damage will only happen if another player is trying to claim the workshop. If you leave the workshop area you still will get slap damage. Certain events work the same way, as long as you are there you are not protected by slap damage.
---
Second this. Stabilised perk is a game changer too but I assume you’re already running it. 
---
Inventory is Server Hopping, Caps are Daily.
---
There are better ways to fix pvp with out affecting pve with un needed nerfs, but I guess the communities feed back just falls on deaf ears with this subject. Im still liking the game a lot. 
---
True ;,)
---
How much for it?
---
Would buy for 2000 atoms
---
You still have to go to a high level of the map to get it, unless there is a different way than the quest that is triggered. 
---
No thank you.
---
I have a crippling fear of ants which puts me on edge playing this game as it is. If they ever add any that are bigger than they currently are or even add a Queen for that matter I’m done. Game gets sold.
---
I'll help you 
---
Only works in your inventory unfortunately, so you have to carry around more than 1 frame for it to be useful.
---
People build around a weapon or weapon type. Just about every weapon type can be OP. Should they all be dragged down to the weakness of the weakest? To make who happy? Or to make everyone unhappy?
---
I’m making a pistol person right now because I got a western with explosive and +10% dmg while aiming and something else. Quicker to level a new character than to level 50x and move points around 
---
I’ve upgraded mine to Prime. I have an explosive lmg and a +25% fire rate AA one. Fluorescent Flux is easy to get and Ultracite 308s are crafted in bigger batches so I had over 1000 before I ran out of steel. I haven’t been on to test them since I built them but I’m hopeful that these are good weapons. 
---
Power plants also work. Arktos pharma. It lists the factories next to the challenge
---
Disconnects are still the same as day one. Nothing has changed.
---
Converts it into explosive pellets?
---
“Makes vague and generally dismissive comment without adding anything to the conversation or citing any reasons why I disagree.”  
---
Well, allow me to explain why I think I’m comfortable enough to talk about this-  
---
450 hours in this game. 25 years playing video games. I own numerous (10 or so) two shot and explosive round (4) weapons (no, I never found a unicorn TSE, just like the *vast majority* of their current owners) and the ability to recognize that they were so far and away better than everything else that they are detrimental to the game.  
---
Look, I’m sorry that your god mode enabler is getting brought back in line with other weapons (pro tip- they are still going to be better than 95% of what’s even considered a good drop) but it *is* necessary for the game. If you want to have a meaningful conversation about why you think I’m incorrect I’m all ears.
---
I can’t remember but just vendor price, I think it’s 200 caps. I won’t be on til later today but feel free to add me! 
---
I was pulling a all day session for resource gathering and I claimed a bunch. A guy would start the claim process, 1 shot me in my PA, then walk away so the claim didn’t continue. He did it constantly, so I said hell with it and jumped to a different came. All he did was follow me around. Yes, PvP is broken, horribly. And sadly, regular armor is much more powerful than Power Armor. 
---
Suit and Rifle paint are Atom Shop.
---
Haha thats what happens when u get lost im flux farming.. the grind is real XD 
---
I appreciate it!
---
How about the pool table on the Balls?
---
They are broken, it's just that they cap at a certain damage (after demo rank 5 and weapon damage +60%). Bobbleheads and magazines don't cap at all meaning you can potentially stack thousands of them. TSE is broken with a threshold while bobbleheads are broken in a way that can give you infinite damage. That's the real problem.
---
Ok, my psn is mario_will_die
---
I don't use op build,  and I can still one shot. It's just stacking the right stuff for how you play. I disagree on everyone is equal. Lots of factors go into it. But mostly the player themselves.  Not all gamers are equal.  Not all builds are equal, and not all equipment is equal.  Still a fun game when it's not glitching.
---
To make every build viable. You don't have to nerf the strongest, when you can buff the weakest.
---
Are you disabled in some way? You can mod it with makeshift warrior
---
I didn't start going until level 45 when I got decent power armor. I pretty much snuck around in Welch at level 25, I was moving my camp a lot also since I had turrets to help with enemies, I also ran a lot. Unless you have a high level teammate or more I would just wait until you are level 45-50 before you do the main or some of the side quests 
---
I'm using mods since beginning. Everyting is ok
---
Oh absolutely. Harmless fun :)
---
You don't have to tell me that twice! Logged in today and wondered where my 50 stimpaks had went before remembering I was gathering stuff in a nuke zone the night before xD
---
You totally misread what I posted.
---
It shoots flame like the normal one but the flame explodes. Its like a flamer with an added explosive minigun thats has really shitty range.
---
There is plenty of things they could do: 
---
* Ant Queen
---
* A flower boss akin to the one in the mire but much bigger and threatening
---
* A secret chinese robot ( Something like a chinese liberty prime  which was secret until the massive shaking from the nearby nuke somehow reactivated it)
---
* Mythic Deathclaw King ( Would probably be as big as a scorchbeast queen ) 
---
And that's all i can think off right now...
---
Especially for PvP, it's quite unbalanced the fact the someone is able to stack multiple mutations together. Might be best to get rid of mutations completely in PvP in order for balance sake IMO
---
Yeah. I have faith that they will make balance changes. It was one of those things though where they needed to stop the heavy bleeding first, then they can worry about that.
---
Wow, that was 7-8 of them! What a super rare find! [This guy had 4 invade his workshop once](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aapwxh/4_behemoths_1_scorchbeast_and_lvl47_me_with_a/) and yesterday i found one at Whitespring, there is always one at a certain lake, but otherwise rare to see them even in a nuke zone!
---
There's a woodmill south of Vault 76. Lots of wood there
---
That is nuts! Poor Grahm too. If this wasn't on video I don't think I would have believed it.
---
You need wood do ya man?.
---
Head to prickets fort 300+ wood every time.
---
Top of the map right side of the water world. :)
---
Oh sorry! I meant the jumpsuit 
---
Yeah like I have been trying for the last week and nothing. I feel that. Brick comes up all the time so I was able to get that at least.
---
That sucks, I had a tse cryolator and the shit shot pellets that had not bullet travel and were precise af
---
What is every build? I mean I have a build where I have Martial Artist, Strong Back, Travelling Pharmacy, Bear Arms and Sturdy Frame. Should that be viable?
---
Or a hatch that opens and 10-20 liberators fly out.
---
There is a  bug when the caps stay at zero!! I have to trade, cancel trade, trade a few times to get the caps to show up.
---
If you need lots of wood fast I'd recommend visiting Prickett's Fort (very north of the map). There are wood piles everywhere in there.
---
Stop being literal and role play! Why aren't you posting your contact info and schedule? Find a team! Get figurative! Literal after all is synonymous with stupid.
---
If this was a good game they might do that but since it’s a 60 dollar game with a 200 dollar edition that still has free to play style micro transactions shoved in they won’t want to make the game pay to lose and make the regular outfits better than the pay outfits
---
They've announced these kind of events for 2019 updates :)
---
Borderlands PS Mr Torgue: Lasers that don't even explode!
---
Fallout 76: Hold my beer. TSE laser gatling gun.
---
Facts are insults? Hmmm.. well then.. how's 8th grade going for you? Learning a lot? What are they teaching in schools these days? Deflection?
---
Your best bet early on is to keep an eye on the ground for broken logs and tree stumps, as these are an easy source of wood scraps while you're adventuring. If you're able to take over a Workshop somewhere in the map, these often have resource pools which can be tapped for a steady stream of supplies; wood being a common one. You'll know it when you arrive at the workshop to find a stack of logs set to one side. There's an option to 'harvest' these logs immediately, however if you take over and establish the workshop, you can place a machine which will process it for you, for as long as the machine runs and the camp remains under player-control.
---
You'll find that resources like wood become quite plentiful as you progress! You can scrap some weapons and armour for wood specifically as well. 
---
I hope that helps, I'm still pretty new myself! 
---
...or deathclaw hands. :)
---
Every build involving a weapon type (unarmed, one-handed melee, two-handed melee, auto pistols, non-auto pistols, auto rifles, non-auto rifles, heavy guns, explosives, shotguns, did I miss anything else?)
---
I ran into that deathclaw, well it was dead already. 
---
Pretty petty to blow up someone's base just because they don't want every rando walking in.  NTA.
---
Thanks. I must've missed it. Got a link?
---
Steel - Kill Supermutants Scrap their weapons
---
Find and do side missions, daily quests and events. Explore every inch of every location, marked and unmarked, that you find. Read every terminal and note and listen to every holotape. There are so many tiny details in this game that people miss because they’re rushing the little bit of story we have right now. Enjoy the scenery and explore the map, discover every location you can within your level and don’t forget that this is an online game designed to be played with others. Don’t be afraid to talk to people and group up, even if they are way higher level than you. There are so many kind people that will help you get started, you just have to be kind right back to them. Good ways to level up that I feel most beginners don’t think about so much are killing animals then cooking their meat. Making your own ammo. Diluting stimpacks, Radaway and rad-x. Building things in your camp. Planting tatos, mutfruit and corn to farm your own adhesive. Travel over to the Mothman Museum and collect all the mothman eggs you can find and turn them into omelettes, you can also do this to farm caps from vendors. 
---
Good luck. 
---
I get it but this isn't really a pvp game its mostly pve. I feel like they should focus more on dmg caps between players or just something that doesn't affect pve players as much. 
---
There's even certain armor that you can wear that doesn't affect your chameleon mutation...
---
Recently I found out the straight jackets on the asylum have 43 caps value on vendors (with hard bargain lvl 3) and you can find 10+ in one run, good for low levels i think. 
---
Whitespring has the fountain the restores disease at the pagoda, but great tips thanks!
---
This is going to sound crazy..... when my computer starts doing this, I ALT TAB twice. Once to tab out of game, again to return to game. I have absolutely no idea why but this fixes my problem.
---
I discovered this when I was going to rage post about stuttering. Win 10 by the way.
---
So not every build then. And viable for what exactly?
---
the math certainly seems to work out this way for me (lv. 105 luck build)
---
imagine an explosive firearm and demolition expert multiplier and you can reach very pleasing numbers
---
This is really damn good. I like all the themes you've come up with too.
---
PvP is for one. Whatever raiding is coming with the next patch. Even running the nuke silos.
---
Great idea. We will need a server list for this to work though.  Randomly spawning into a new server would have the events at various stages of building so you won't want to devote resources into it and time if you aren't sure you can come back the next day and keep working on it. 
---
I love the idea of gradually building the settlements up over time though it's amazing . 
---
I hope thy see this
---
From one builder to another i tip my hat for this one. 
---
Good work buddy.
---
What about if the event took place during a certain time frame and couldn't be completed until the time is up? So if it's 24 hours, when you log into the game you'll get the rewards for participation if you actually put in effort and not just stood around watching. 
---
They could get everyone ready for it with social media and those that don't use social media could read it on the message board at the main menu, they could even go as far as to give you a message in game when you log in sort of how previous games did it when DLC released. I like the idea of permanent addition just because it makes the game feels like it's growing, what was once a dirty, damaged abandoned pub could now be a wasteland abode for all your friends where you can play poker and caravan to your hearts content. Plus whiskey! 
---
Imo If you wasn't playing the game before then you didn't get to see the games evolvolution and it's sort of your own fault tbh you gotta be there for the next one.
---
They're probably weighted, but the values are way off.  It really is almost always explosive vents + ultracite arm/leg.
---
Do you even really need turrets? 
---
I have missed too
---
Not sure what YTA means, and I hadn’t thought about sharing a base. Never even occurred to me.
---
I have come across many paper bags, not mine, not sure how long they have been there. Usually it is holotapes and other items I don't need, but sometimes it has weapons, ammo, aid, and junk.
---
You could have it so your contributions as an account/ character are tracked,  not necessarily server only.  That way,  if on Server A you provided 23% of the entire bridge resources,  when you join a server that already has it complete,  you can draw a share of whatever benefit it provides..
---
Just brain storming I love this idea
---
What I don’t believe you, no enemy is that annoying in any game.
---
Edit: nevermind just got attacked by a scorchbeast
---
"How does that even work?" Apparently it doesn't work lol nice find...I think??
---
From my personal experience stability has gone up substantially, I can can go days now without a DC, but I will have other days where I get DC’d multiple times in a single session. When I first started playing I couldn’t go a single session without at least one, and it was often numerous times.
---
My only neighbors so far have been albino deathclaws and mole rats. Been lucky with scorched beasts.
---
Vendors, events, players, finding them while exploring, queen kills etc etc you can get them from everywhere. :)
---
Are you on PC?
---
Please see my previous post, I proposed a similar idea. I think we should gather those propositions in hope u/lonewanderer Sees it.
---
No on Ps4
---
You can find them, buy them, trade them with other players and get then from quests. 
---
I agree. I think they did that on purpose. 
---
Not on this one. Not saying it can’t happen, but I’ve only been visited by albino deathclaws and more rats
---
Thanks, that’s actually helped
---
On Bethesda Plz list. Reported.
---
A nerf? OK. I don't agree with the two shot nerf, but yeah. What's really annoying though is how badly they're nerfing these. Bethesda is a big company. They should know from nearly endless examples of this happening with other games that nerfing things directly into the ground isn't the way to go. Nerfs should be reasonable.
---
I like this. As for mutations possibly consider speed demon as well. It’ll help you close the gap a bit between enemies a little faster, and also sleek mod on one of your legs can help you move faster when proned. Could just be my taste but I like my melee movin fast
---
Try not to focus on too much of any one resource. I’m level 15 and my inventory is constantly full.
---
I find myself bulking wood and steel to sell as it constantly eats up my inventory.
---
Once you have a nice little base built, I’d suggest no more than 100-200 wood/steel as it’ll cover any crafting needs. If you need more you know where to find it!
---
Good luck with everything. :)
---
I never knew you could get them from quests or from events. That's probably how I got the ones I have already. Thanks pal.
---
I left mine in the wife's purse. Have you looked there?
---
No problem my amigo Jenna who uses tools. Learning the best spots to farm is part of the end game.
---
So someone puts points into a weapon type, like for example shotguns, or rifles, or 2h, or 1h, and bloody mess, and some defense perks, and maybe some people have VATS crit builds, and maybe some people have low health builds, and maybe some people have stealth builds, how is everyone using the same build?
---
If your build is larger than the blue printable budget, it may not let you place the base.
---
ill take one off your hands if youre on pc
---
I think my laser / missile turrets are L34 or so and they do fine vs enemies of all type. One thing i haven't figured out is - what are mentats for? I hoped they would let me build higher level ones.
---
Anyways you're probably all using them wrong. They shouldn't be more than 1 story high, almost always need a spotlight, if you're not using the powered version you're a noob, and you can put them on top of this shelf item for ground defense and coverage.
---
If you spread them all over your shop you're doing it wrong; realistically you want a alley way to funnel the enemies into where turrets open up with a flamethrower trap at the mouth.
---
The basic unpowered turrets really are a waste of resources 90% of the time i spent more gears repairing them then they're worth. Got to go big, spend the nuclear or go home. When you do you can auto-win defend events even vs a Scorch Beast.
---
When i capture your shop i just ignore the noob turrets. They're like a warm spring rain to my power armor and then i own them!
---
Nope. Please let factions be existing lore wise. Otherwise any player can create his own faction and block every other player from entering. That's not a good way to go.
---
Vendor inside ws sells alot of camp plans. 
---
Even sell whats called resort type camp plans never purchased them just assume they are a very clean nice camp decorations. 
---
Does the communities feedback fall on deaf ears? I don’t think it does, I think the developer team has done a very good job of listening to the community, the patches and patch notes are a testament to this. Yeah, a lot of the high visibility posts are negative in nature and the get a lot of traffic, but that’s normal these days. I think the majority of players are pretty happy with the direction the game is taking.
---
Yeah, I haven't seen one either, and I just hit level 101, lol.
---
I’ll be sure to leave a tip when I pull into to the station.
---
Fantastic builds my friend.
---
Does this mean I can get a liberator helmet in the near future?
---
No, I don’t suppose so. But I can’t build any wider than I did, and everything I need fits on the single level, so I figured why not.
---
Smart idea OP
---
Nice idea/build, it would be cool for an actual tribe of "savages" 
---
Weapon wise, maybe a bone club for heavy hitting power, cultist dagger for quick stabbing or maybe the cultist machete which deals poison damage too
---
Sounds like all my reactions in RDR2.  I haven't run into many people here yet, but it's good to know I'll be doing the same stupid shit.
---
Try it and tell us. 
---
Community events, not bad, I like it
---
I found that spot the other day.  While I didn't see any kind of resource node, the area had a really nice look to it.  And I liked the option of building out into the pond itself.
---
You can learn mods without having the plans for the item you scrap.  The reason people want the plans is that Handmades for scrap fodder are few and far between.
---
I wanted so bad to make a We Bare Bears display 
---
Take over Public Workbenches and defend them. These usually give you plans as part of the reward.
---
I think they should get rid of all legendaries only keep in armor and weapons that are standard
---
Brilliant idea. Brilliant. And there are lots of areas on the map to do it. 
---
Say we have to start, and keep running, every reactor on the map against IRL-daily SB and scorched wave attacks.
---
Death Claw?
---
Monster Girl?
---
Yes!!!! o(≧▽≦)o	
---
A lot of the sidequests in this game pop up as you explore and discover new map points.  Do some exploring, and you find stuff to do.  There is a lot out there.
---
Miss that little guy
---
I have thought about speed demon, and I’d love the speed boost, but I’ve put it off due to the impact on thirst and hunger. Thinking about it though my build will accommodate that debuff as I can drink from any water source  without rads, make plenty of disease cures with the intention to sell them when vendors are introduced and I’m always hunting game for leather. Great suggestion, thank you. 
---
T-51b because it has the highest physical and energy resists. And it has a Nuka-Cola paint job.
---
thanks didnt see that actually thought about tryong there just havnt yet
---
Might I ask what level are you? 
---
I just want one that doesn't give you a disease when you look at it.
---
Definitely mate, I really hope we can get this (as well as your post) seen by some big boys at BGS then our idea can become a part of this awesome game.
---
Great minds dude! Haha
---
Just got the game, and have only seen a handful of people.  I didn't realize this was open world at the time.  It starts off story-mode-ish.  And I don't have a headset with a mic.  Guess I'm lone wolfing it.
---
Nerf explosive, fine, but that is no longer a 'two shot' ability, it's scratch damage applied to a second projectile that isn't guaranteed to hit. Or it could be the bullet that hits and your real bullet misses. Heck considering how well polished the game engine is I wouldn't be surprised if both bullets give out scratch damage unless you load back into the server with your gear equipped.
---
Just remove the second bullet and give us the fractional difference in damage that gives less damage than stock and upper tier mods I can craft for most weapons in the base game.
---
They have strengths but only 3 i reccomend.
---
1. X-01 i love my sets look and its tops for nuke zones.
---
2. Excavators are top notch for Hoarders and a must if you ever overload and want an easy fast travel.
---
3. T-60 For the BOS look.
---
Do you have a discord or is a "group" on xbox?
---
[Why the ghoul slayers gamma gun is the best weapon in fo76](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aegpst/why_the_ghoul_slayers_gamma_gun_is_the_best/)
---
Are we only looking to use our build in a nuke zone? I wasn't aware this was talking exclusive to nukes, then yeah you really need power armor for those. Even if you are running a non power armor build gotta jump into it your spare suit for the queen
---
Have it require insane amounts of resources. But don't let people put more than 100 of that resource at a time so dupers can do it easily
---
Fast travel to Vault 76 and head south picking up fallen wood as you go. There are sawmills in the area, but there’s so much wood scattered on the Forest floor you'll probably get all you need before you get to one.
---
Heyo I know this was posted ages ago but it's the same for me. No robots (Rose, Miss Annie, vender bots etc) have any sort of audible dialogue or subtitles. I only found out they were supposed to after reading about another bug I was experiencing!!
---
Any fixes/suggestions you've found? Certainly is annoying.
---
The game really does need a central hub of some kind. Most players use Flatwoods because it's one of the first towns you come across and has every crafting station you need. Being able to buy your own run down shack and build it up instead of having some camp out in a field would probably appeal to more people.
---
Anyone have any more xp farm tips. 
---
I’m lv81. Just looking to pop the last cheevo (legit)
---
Lol, I still use it to this day, realy good idea. 
---
I'll dip my balls in it!
---
Same.  Been using the mod for Perk Loadouts for weeks now and been fine.  Based on the wording of the comments Bethesda made regarding mods, they don't officially support them because they don't want to be held responsible if they break your game.
---
&gt;1) my stash is permanently full and 2) I simply forgot that flux is junk and 3) I never had a problem of picking up my lost junk if I die accidentally
---
Since I never engage in PvP and I rarely die, it just didn't cross my mind.
---
People will be using same build once they realise it's the best build available. There is no rock, paper, scissors mechanic in this game.
---
Only if you try and get the loot before the "owner".
---
Ignoring the ads is perfect way of never killing her because she tends not to land until wave is cleared. You sir were the only one doing their job on that nuke.
---
Honestly it'd be nice to have a nuka cola machine that restocks.  Maybe you'd have to pay for a delivery service (by drone!  Can be shot down!), but I don't want to decorate with nonfunctional garbage.
---
I'm not a level designer, I'm a survivor trying to make a nice camp.
---
Oh man fuck that judgemental atitude!! Its not even constructive criticism or suggestions. Instead of judging, just help this fellow player experience the best this game has to offer. Is it so difficult?
---
And you know that someday they're will be that guy who jetpack/marsupial his way up the ledge where your camp device is picklocks your door and flies in and next thing you know you come home to a stranger sleeping in your bed
---
Ignoring the fact that your reply was super neckbeardy and subtly insulting, the subject of dev changes recently has been combat mechanics adjustments and fixing exploits. When you're playing a survival game, it's immersion-breaking to be able to kill every otherwise frightening enemy in one hit. Also, other player characters who can kill you can be a great source of world-building detail if you have some imagination and everyone is on the same playing field.
---
Lvl 18
---
How is your stash permanently full?
---
I’ve started just ignoring players in general. I’ve been messed with so often by what appears to be a friendly player. It’s gotten beyond ridiculous. The one time I accepted an invite, the dude couldn’t stop mocking my accent. (Born, raised and still live in Charleston, WV). So, I just log on and do my own thing. I play with one or two IRL friends and that’s it.  I will, however, help lower levels when they’re in a bad spot  
---
I'm impressed you know about Nuka-grapes - i think i forgot entirely!
---
Agreed. I'm all for PvP but sometimes you don't wanna be bothered....had the kids at watoga constantly trying to afford a fight....OK killed him about 10 times in a row....he finally gets the hint cries in pm and goes....fast forward an hour and I end up back at my base....short bus rolls up with the crayon crew to destroy my base....like get a fuckin life
---
Bloodborne plat worth bragging about, 
---
FO76 plat not so much...
---
And I want a flame thrower called "Money to burn" that is fueled with prewar money.
---
that was pretty good haha
---
Nah, I'm sure she noticed. 
---
*brofist*
---
I'd like a responder theme set for it like medic fire breather standard 
---
also I'm lvl 88 still nothing 
---
Explore. Pick up flyers and notes. Read terminals. Listen to holos. You'll soon have more side quests than you know what to do with.
---
"And this is my wall of Nuka-Cola Quantum!"
---
I am experiencing the same thing [PS4Pro]. I seems like it happens more frequently now compared to when the game launched.

---
So, never then?
---
JK
---
Think about the game in 2 or 3 years. If your next character or someone who just bought the game then steps out of the Vault, there will already be all those additions player made in the past. This locks basically everyone, new player or not from beginning the game again. Bethesda would have to introduce a system where you start on a legacy server and then transition to a server for high level players. I don't see that coming anytime soon. 
---
It is a very lonely game.  It's always a little uneasy when you see another person.
---
We need a way to recycle these extras into a new perk card. Maybe trade two or three extras for a new one of your choice.
---
Yeah I’m aware. I usually grab 100 or so and make shotgun ammo and then bulk a little junk but I haven’t been there in a few days so I’m running pretty low as usual. 
---
How the fuck do you play basket in that skinny house??
---
I'd walk right by your gold bars and oogle the clipboards and typewriters.
---
So I would assume the deathclaw is not scaling 
---
Get online buddy, there’s about 100 post saying this everyday.
---
When I first read that I thought you were collecting cat urine.  And I thought "This guy is onto something!"
---
As long as the player who starts the supply drop gets the loot 1st you won't get wanted. I didn't know this and was just use to grabbing the supply drop. It was after the most recent patch I had to use the lock pick to open it. I am actually still wanted for 10 caps, no one will kill me. Now I don't touch it if I it doesn't automatically show the loot to take.
---
I know what you mean i lost my single shot explosive dragon fighting the queen 
---
If he went to all that effort he deserves it
---
Friendly advice.
---
Queen lands either when you cripple the shit out of her, or there is a player in an open terrerain AND the wave of mobs has been cleared. I'm usually one of those that can see her HP go down with each shot. I'm also not wasting my bullets on her when she's midair, clearing the mobs instead. I'd also like to add I haven't see her alive past 10 minutes into the counter in like last forty levels of my playtime, so I guess me clearing the whole map out of mobs correlates with her being taken down.

Personally I don't group with people because the Lone Wanderer perk is far better than any benefit I would get from grouping.  That and my camp is in a really nice spot that I don't want people to discover for fear of others starting to build there.  Oh, and being in a group doesn't mean you get XP sharing.  Both group members still have to tag a mob to get XP.
---
Great ideas, but I don't think it will happen with the cheap, throw-away servers Bethesda is using.
---
I don’t even have legendary primary weapons so I’m ok lol. You’re right about the gauss though, so I’ll sell it and free up 20 pounds but I get the feeling that fix will last less than a few hours. 
---
They aren't even functional, they can be so hard to spot.
---
Same reason your dad is still with your mom – I just like bug infested trash. 
---
Yeah awesome idea, I was thinking about starting a player faction for it, but I’m incredibly anti social. You think folks would consider an idea like that though?
---
I had the bone Weapons for a while and love them, but they don’t have any legendary effects unlike the spear, and also don’t seem to have the benefit of mods. 
---
I have the cult Weapons in my stash, but I’m quite heavily invested in 2 handed melee. Love those jaw bones though, they’d be perfect if I had a 2h variant.
---
I also thought about entertaining a decent legendary machete, and putting the sacrificial blade mod on it, but it’s a back burner as once again, I’m specialised in 2h.
---
This is a good idea
---
Or or or just hear me out they are end gamers taking their time to collect.
---
We already found a way around this anyway we use bank alts to store 1000s of items. You might have a legendary alt to store all your three stars. One for junk etc etc etc. 
---
Personally i need to keep my main clear of alot of stored items as i carry about 100 weight alone of plans and recipes for the chat community to help others.
---
Trust me never gonna be a reason as to why we should not see more stash size increases.
---
The way I see it, the only people who complained that there are no human NPCS in the game, are the ones who went into the developer room just to kill Wooby.
---
People will be? I thought everyone was? I've seen plenty of people using plenty of different builds. Plenty of viable and diverse builds based around playstyle and weapon types. Each has strengths and weaknesses. Everything has a counter.
---
The moth man grenades require mothman eggs too
---
Yes, was using X01 with bright headlamp and targeting HUD and crashing every 5-15 min. Took it off and immediately played for 3 hours with no problem. 
---
THANKS!
---
I want to put my garden gnomes out front 
---
I tried it, they thought about it it seems. So my camp is literally on the border but the wires can't cross :D even with the long pylon they are too far apart :( So sad... 
---
Good call on that. There’s also a gym with weights on the floor in a few spots that gives you tons of lead. Charleston Firestation is one spot and the Hornright Estate has one too if I’m not mistaken. 
---
Got 5k caps,  would trade for some TSE weapon ( not heavy one )
---
Explore!! Have you visited all locations??
---
Side missions sometimes pop up when you go to different locations.
---
If youre too low level to pursue the main quests focus on exploring all of the forest, ash heap and toxic valley. Then go to top of the world, proceed north of savage divide, continue to north of the mire. 
---
Go until abbies bunker, continue main quest with Roses Quests. 
---
Explore all savage divide. Venture to whitesprings. Get mauled by ghouls. Try again!
---
Explore all the Mire. Continue south to watoga. Run from the robots and complete Mayor for a Day quest.
---
Finish BOS quest, initiate Enclave quest.
---
By this time youll be around level 50-60.
---
I’m level 23 and moving very slowly as well for lack of time to play. Anyway, I enjoy the quests and I some days I work on them and some days I work on leveling. I also enjoy the stories, so I listen to the holotapes. I don’t think there is a wrong way to play this game. I explore houses, loot, quickly become over encumbered, meet my death, find my death bag (maybe), scrap, build, cook, rinse and repeat. I sometimes have a particular goal and I sometimes do not. Right now I would like to get to level 25 to start working on my excavator PA.  I also need stimpack and PA station plans.  It’ll happen eventually. Just play and figure it out as you go. :)
---
For my playstyle, Excavator because of the carry weight advantage. The extra storage goes a long way in weapons, ammo, and aid, negating any other armor boosts. 
---
But it really depends on how you're playing the game. 
---
Bathtub full of beer bottles
---
Do you use the crossbow? Or is that too much tech?
---
And how are you coping with it? I am super sad about it... I've like, lost the will to play. They weren't like, the best of the best weapons I had but I've had them for a long time and to just suddenly see them gone and nothing I can do about it is frustrating to say the least. Also, I am truly sorry for your loss. 
---
I chunked an excavator set yesterday so I actually only have one now. I really don’t use either, I’m that solo guy running thru the nuke zone in a hazmat suit picking all the flowers 😂
---
I'm confused....how did he survive this long? Did the bombs give him immortality?
---
I’ve gotten messages before like it needs support but never got any messages today when I kept moving around trying to place it.  You may be right about the budget part but since I put everything together my only option now is to completely start over.
---
Weirdout 76
---
4 parts x-01 (torso and 3 limbs), 2 parts t-51b (limbs), gives best overall stats while other pure armor sets give higher in one or two categories this gives the best average.
---
I am sorry, but isn't it so called "PvP pussies" that need a TSE the way it is now to PvP?
---
#WHERE ARE THE GIANT ANTS?
---
[In fallout 3 there were ants the size of ponies.](http://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/4676/p4676_v_v8_ab.jpg)
---
Probably something like that happened. I guess I’ll have to rebuild again.
---
favorite would be best I think but I'd rather a perk load out
---
It’s a 68. 
---
I say that in the current tense because I’ve yet to vanquish it. LOL 
---
Hopefully it’s not in the next world I spawn into, but it’s been in 2 of the last 3.
---
So how *did* you manage to build a foundation on top of another? Looks great btw.
---
Nah they won't. Or it'll go the way of fortnite where older players quit because of re-released old skins
---
i found melong bloom in a lunch box at camp venture in the bunkhouse by the command center.
---
Raider. It has a passive ability that makes everyone and everything underestimate you. 💪🏻
---
Well it’s only been 25 years or something hasn’t it? In fo76 I mean. 
---
You really want to rely on their servers to transfer items from one to another?
---
I think they tried to address this with the -50% damage to players if you're flat broke. 
---
F u
---
His balls are in your wife's purse?
---
Signs and letters material right there.
---
Then I am not the only one that has happened to, lost Veil of Mystery and other issues. It would be nice if those items went into a storage area where we could retrieve them, as I do not seem to be able to get another one either.
---
How is this a thing? The only place I know one of those can spawn is at a pylon in the bog. Only if the workshop close to it isnt capped. It's such a shame you never see them anywhere else. Atleast thats what I thought..... Anyone else found behemoths or hordes of them? Nice clip though OP thx for sharing I laughed at your pain haha
---
Yes! Good shout. I have a 2* instigating crossbow, but yeah it doesn’t quite feel right to include in the build. I hear there might be a compound bow coming though, that might feel a bit better. 
---
I like that idea, if there is anything I can do supporting you guys let me know. Always wanted to rp as a scavenger anyways so if you are looking for specific stuff, just send me out for the hunt :D
---
If it means i can send my buddy 200 .44 magnum shells without us both having to be online, and it works, sure!
---
People like you are ruining fallout.
---
Don't think you need plans for any turrets, you just need home defense rank 3
---
Im level 81. Not quite your levels but willing to help. I have a maxed shotgun build with maxed enforcer which is useful to keep her from taking off from the ground.

I already completed the event once.

Psn : paulofg1980

Ill be online around 5 pm gmt.

First I’ve heard of that. Seems a simpler solution would be to prevent them from seeking revenge if they couldn’t cover the wager amount. 
---
Thanks. I’m saving this thread because it’s exactly my play style: slow and silent. 
---
Soz bud team up for safety 
---
Opposite experience for me, I have only met one griefer in close to 250 hours and I've met a ton of friendly people using mic. We even have our own discord channel. Are you in EU or NA?
---
76 dweller 1: Jimmy from the vault, you remember short kid always talking in a wierd way. Well he said he is going to start the very first postal service for Appalachia.
---
76 dweller 2 : Well i might just take him up on his offer. Maybe i can have him take supplies to Michaels's camp. I owe him a few tatos after getting high and eating all his crops.....
---
76 dweller 1 : That was my camp..... yes you do owe me still for that.
---
Boom we have mail service in the game!. 
---
Give it to us Beth!!!!.
---
They probably get an alert when you log in.
---
127.
---
They wont just throw the design away. Doesn’t make sense economically spoken 
---
I agree... IF it works. There's a huge emphasis on IF though. I still think they need an app for moving items from one character to another like destiny had. Could even incorporate player to player trading through it. 
---
This is one of the few “I have an idea...” posts that is absolutely awesome. 
---
Workshops
---
do the borders of your camp and the factory touch? is so you may still be able to get it to work because power connectors don't have to snap together to work.
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/ahlrb2/psa_conduits_do_not_need_to_be_snapped_together/
---
O grab the chat mod man and prepare to meet some of the best lads and gals from around the world. I refuse to play the game without it now. I hope our console bros get one as well in the future it is a game changer.
---
I dont use any turrets because their budget cost is too damn high. I've gotten a couple baddies there when I log in, but so far I haven't come back to it being attacked.
---
So you have no proof? Ok baby. You tried anyway
---
I remember reading a pop up message once about sleeping bags having a certain percentage to give a disease.
---
Reason why i never bothered to buy a sleeping bag in the atom shop.
---
Any joy with xp spots?
---
I actually went to a nukeside with hopes of stealing the nuke from someone. I asked him if it was his first nuke and he said yes, so I didnt pull through. I helped him launch the nuke and let him do what ever he wanted.
---
But I think stealing a nuke is overall one of the fun competitive game mechanics in FO76.
---
What I don’t understand is, they knew two-shot and explosive were going to be ridiculous legendary effects from FO4, why the heck did they even include them in this game?
---
I thought it was 100....but I am most likely wrong lol
---
I still stand by my bears suggestion.
---
I remember not scrapping some junk items in fo4 to use them as decoration. Obviously this doesn't work in 76 because of the paperbag mechanic so being able to build existing junk in form of CAMP decoration would be nice, it's very strange that we can have shelves but can't place anything on them.
---
Be sure and aim!
---
Do you get injured when you use it?
---

---
I miss when I was able to open my pipboy and not have my game crash.
---
This is an error that its already been around since Fallout 4. I keep reporting it and nothing happens. In Fallout 76 I got that crash a few times as well.
---
One this I've wanted (though some people disagree) is the game to be more like Rust. In Rust, you have a set server for your character (I'd prefer server selection), but you can build pretty much anywhere. The only limit is your structures have upkeep, so you have to stash wood and stone in the tool cabinet in each base or they degrade.
---
People collaborate to make giant castles and towers. There is no limit to base size, but at large sizes the upkeep becomes unsustainable.
---
Totally Agree, Just as Uranium Fever was about to complete last night, (Alone, and all Legendary's killed, but not yet looted) I got Server booted, and thus received absolutely no reward for all that work.
---
Will do as soon as I get time to play :)
---
It's NovaCrimsyn. See you soon!
---
I enjoy checking other CAMPS out, sometimes I find good ideas. If they want me to leave I will, but I try and leave something if I use your stuff. I have a lock on my door but usually try to leave it open especially in a nuke zone so that people can use my arch to get rid of their radiation. You should not be worried about the higher level guys (not that I'm super high, but I'm in the mid hundred) we're usually out to help others. Also you might be able to take me out easier than I could take you out. I built my guy to sneak, so I don't do well in PvP situations. 
---
Turns out I was kind of wrong about that. I had read that they give mutations so I was under the impression you get one each time you consumed one. Which made sense to me based on them coming from West Tek. 
---
But they're really just a drink that will give you a ton of rads so you could *potentially* mutate when you drink one. My bad.
---
Yeah, deathclaw's go as low as 21 and as high as 28.
---
From what I've seen wandering around.
---
Albino seems to be the standard for most random events. 
---
I got that plan from a regular scorchbeast the other day.  First time I've seen one drop anything noteworthy.
---
I read this sub during loading screens. 
---
Oh yeah, this one is right after the war basically. If it was a later time frame, I’d probably be a descendent of this build. Like the chosen one from Fallout 2.
---
Fluorescent flux is so easy to get that I consider ultracite .308 about half as pricey as normal .308.
---
Ill try the rebuild as well! 
---
I think wait and see what their plans for faction pvp are and how that affects pve. 
---
I will see you in game come to me now and then to see if i can supply you. I reccomend the known plans mod on before you come to me. That way when you browse you will see what you need.
---
Yeah i was doing that too in TESV, but in 76 all the shelves are useless... Maybe in a next update ! I really hope they are going to make a big update for the CAMP system.
---
That’s not supposed to be how that works. Anyone who enters the capture bubble (or any of their teammates) are supposed to be hostile. I could’ve sworn they just did a patch about that. 
---
It’s post apocalypse.
---
If you’re putting up walls you must have something to hide or you’re not a friendly.
---
I’m Australian but my work schedule is weird but I’m willing to jump in if I’m on sam_is_scribbles I’m lvl 135 
---
Welp,  I'm completely safe.  I dropped all my shit basically too and am down to 200 lbs, lesson learned.
---
Explosive vent is so situational...maybe combined with a jetpack it'd be worth something?
---
Been in online games that have this sort of mechanic. And it only works when a server is always there no matter when you log in. Not instance based sessions like fallout 76.
---
Also, it wouldn't matter much as far as content goes. As soon as it's done everyone just go back to being hermits
---
Thank you for making these posts.  I am thousands of miles away from my PS4 and wouldn’t be able to spot anything I’d care about otherwise!
---
I could probably not even fill a toilet with my caps D:
---
Sorry your friends got caught up in bullshit. The one shotting outside of PvP is definately some sploity bs. The spotting you cloaked is no mod though, just pop some berry mentat and everyone has a lovely pink glow about them.
---
I think you're immune if it's a camp item.  I think.
---
I have max lone wanderer as well, but once I got an invite from a player who was launching a nuke. I accepted and he shared a perk which periodically removes all radiation. Awesome! I prefer to play alone, but in a team it can be both fun and very useful.
---
It’s a bit off topic, but shouldn’t I have power armor by now? Every time I find some it’s either a blank chassis or a couple pieces way too high level for me
---
Just type in fallout 76 trolling on YouTube most of them are me
---
Yes youre right two shot at ranged is crap and, and i think melee needs to be nerfed or changed so it cant one hit kill and destroy all my power armor
---
If you've already done one I suppose it doesn't matter that much, but if you're trying to complete the quest it's a big deal.
---
I bought one, then got 2 more the next day from Queens
---
I’m thinking that instead of players attacking it, it should be massive waves of enemies based on what region it’s in(mole miner assault for ash heap, scorched for cranberry bog, etc). This would improve player participation as there’s a large pool of people who wouldn’t participate if it’s a pvp event.
---
Enable wood chuck. Talk a walk through the woods and click on all the fallen trees / logs / wood piles you see. 
---
You can catch disease when you're sleeping on the ground (sleeping bags count as the ground).

Trying to lv me from 80-100
---
Impressive 
---
Did you have the creepy mask as well?
---
because they want to charge you or control what you can and cannot place on these shelves they've clearly made for display purposes. Protected glass cases will likely have somekind of achievements or awards put inside, but other things like shelves are just lifeless and stupid without being able to put items on it. However, I think items on these containers should not be lootable, and should become static fixtures once they are engaged. 
---
That pink cloud appears for everyone though. There were no berry Mentats clouds visible on anyone.
---
As you said, it's post-apocalypse, so why would you expect everyone you come across to be friendly and share their resources with you?
---
Some people just prefer to not interact with randoms.  No one owes you access to their camp.
---
If it's only for workshops then you can already look at the map to see if it is owned. The rate of griefers probably won't change much since they're already looking for owned workshops, this would most likely just attract other players who happen upon the radio signal.
---
Yea in general I agree, the do listen most of the time, but I fell like with this subject they have other motives (they want that fortnite money). The majority does not want a nerf to two shot. Explosive yes but also its pretty obvious and has been brought up by countless community members that neither of these really need it. The real problem is A: the two attributes being used together along with other perks B: Stacking Bobble heads. After the nerf people will still get one shotted. That being said it hasn't happened yet so I hope that Bethesda listens to the better options the community has put forward and implements them. I was mad but I still love the game even if they do nerf my weapons. 
---
"Plot”?
---
Not really, I think there's only one set lvl 15 and that's raider.
---
You're better off waiting till lvl 25 when you can get your first excavator set.
---
I've found it pretty commonly on various vendors around the game.  I'd still like to like to see it growing on the ground somewhere (or in a planter).
---
Guess they didn't patch it good enough.-
---
Alcohol dehydrates you faster
---
For me, this is what the game needs.
---
How would you “ tag” people so that this could be allowed?
---
Do you pick up explosive ammo? Or is it achieved by changing the receiver?
---
And also act as a gas mask would be nice 
---
This is fantastic
---
I dig how you did the sign for your station! I immediately showed your link to my clan leader &amp; told her to check out how you did it. I'm also super happy you used the glow-in-the-dark wall map. I was figuring you would. Do you know if we can put Medboxes on walls? Or, if there are plans at all for them? I feel I am always searching thru them at rail stations. Also, too bad we can't individually place toilet paper in the broken toilet, lol. 
---
If I were to add/change anything it would be to replace one of the chairs on the back porch with a chair &amp; instrument like the banjo, and add a cooking spit. Turning left out the backdoor of Charleston Station is where you can see what I'm talking about. It would keep in spirit &amp; theme. 
---
I really wish we could have roofs with dormer windows. (I'll probably get hated on for writing this) I'd even purchase plans with Atoms I've acquired from Daily &amp; Weekly challenges.
---
Do you have a bed or any crafting stations there?
---
My paddle ball is still missing from my inventory.. Not as fancy as your toys but I loved it all the same. Come home Timmy, your family will be waiting for you.
---
true I think im still scared my camp is going to glitch out and duplicate everything so I try to keep my budget low. 
---
Ha!, I knew actually reading it would be useful ;)
---
ok, there are 4 difference balance systems in play. At the end, the hope is, you would have a better balance that Bethesda currently has (you should be able to do this)
---
Ok, the balance is, Legendarily vs Crafted. Or more Directly, Int vs Luck. 
---
How good armour / melee weapons are is directly effected by their max condition. It gives them their damage. A higher max condition, better Damage Resistance, and Energy Resistance (which is why you get someone who can get 40 or so INT to make your PA).
---
However, you can't rebuild Legendarily (outside of the mistress of mystery stuff), they are as you found them, which their condition is determined by your luck stat.
---
So, you need a super high int for one (and only one) thing you build. Then, how good your equipment is entirely driven by your Luck stat.
---
This makes crafting entirely useless, since, as it currently stands, no one outside of early game, runs with vanilla weapons / armour.
---
So, if you want the craft / luck builds to be equal, you will have to find a way to fix that (perhaps by rebuilding, but, that would make Int builds super strong, unless it took flux maybe?)
---
There is the Range vs Melee Balance. Melee is crazy powerful for 2 reasons. Firstly, how much damage you do with Melee is determined by your weapon condition, and you can overheal it. (luck, is as usual, super important here, since your max condition of the item drives its base damage.....)
---
Second how much damage you do is determined by your Strength, So, raising a stat, gives you more damage. 
---
Range has neither of these, but... it does have range, which is powerful in it's own way. :) 
---
Stealth vs non Stealth is pretty balanced. Stealth is strong, but takes a LOT of cards to make work.
---
ok, PA vs non PA builds. Power armour is almost essential to go into nuke zones, and, you can gain fusion cores fast enough that you don't have to get out of it. 
---
However, they don't get legendary effects, but they DO get mods.
---
Armour, on the other hand gets legendary effects, and is good for stealth, so, it is likely to be stronger in the long term, but much weaker in the short term.
---
Again, you don't end up crafting armour once you hit 50th, and how good it defends you is based on its max condition... so luck becomes important here again.
---
Things you will need to keep in mind. The Stealth game is important, and if you can't one shot things from stealth, then, stealth becomes useless, so you have to retain that, but, can balance it with required weapons, armour, perks etc. (same as it is now) - that balance is rather delicate, so, you will have to be careful around it.
---
There is already a pretty heavy difference between low and high level characters, but... 50th is pretty easy to get to, so, I expect they will raise that ceiling soon enough.
---
New card will be added to the game, (no doubt the cards which make rifles weigh less will hit soon). 
---
Talking about Rifles, The balance between guns and energy weapons may need a look at.
---
remember, you CAN'T stealth energy weapons, it is a rule since fallout 1, so no changing it.
---
I'd start with a ruleset. like, 
---
"the queen needs to be a tougher fight than launching a nuke"
---
"x points of cards should equal a weapon legendary effect worth y stars"
---
etc. and then you can make balance changes and see if your rules are being followed.
---
Don't some of those challenges have specific locations in the zone that you need to take the photos?
---
It's like in Half Life. Maybe that was the purpose from the beginning.
---
Sorry you lads got caught up in this. I understand some are bored but jesus wish they would leave others alone who don't want to play with them in pvp.
---
We need PVE servers, not just pvp servers and not the way shit is now.
---
We need PVE servers for us that wish to only help one another not harm fellow vault dwellers. Those who we supposedly grew up with and lived and laughed with.
---
We need a PVE server side for us that want it ( sure most will).
---
》 Players can not harm one another outside of workshop areas.
---
》 Players can not destroy one anothers bases. You can fast traveler regardless while in someones camp zone as to avoid any griefing issues.
---
》 Joining a friends server will notify you before hand what mode it is ( pvp or pve). If you choose to join you will have to abide by the rules of that choice.
---
Boom done pve server option that only connects those with it. Should not be hard since we can only have 23 people with us at any given time...
---
Pretty much all I do now is build. 
---
You can build better than me. 
---
Thanks for the inspiration.
---
It’s a legendary effect on the gun itself.
---
Do the armor legs take the damage and need to be repaired? 
---
There are birds chirping, but you never saw one. I want some bird mobs. And fish Queen!
---
Max 75% armor penetration in PvP would be fine.
---
Once you join the Brotherhood of Steel, every time you pick up Technical Data will give you a side quest to deposit it somewhere.
---
I just use the Power Chassis, so underrated..
---
Yeah I'm not sure how much sense the more itself actually makes....idk that we could be within miles of a blast zone at all.....the magic of writing lol.....*but how will our actors smoke in an oxygen rich environment* *that's easy...thank god we created that whatchamacallit it device*
---
Well, maybe anybody in combat (Danger) within range of that legendary
---
I wish I could help you.  I've been singing "Straighten Up and Fly Right" all morning.
---
Person that would do that wouldn't care about a cap bounty though. They would just have a friend collect it, probably have a ton of caps from duping anyway.
---
Not that I've noticed
---
Explosive is far and beyond better than all the other mods in its category - if you look at 25% fire rate, then the Explosive nerf which gives you AOE + 20% is more than reasonable, plus you can still stack Demolitions on top of it.  Please let's not pretend Explosive is just broken as an effect.  Of course bobbleheads and magazines make this worse.
---
I'll stand up for Two Shot though - by itself it already has cons.  My take is Two Shot got a bad name because everyone things every single one of these Explosive abominations in game are Two Shot.  They aren't all Two Shot and there's others like Bloodied and Instigating that can be just as devastating.
---
Was he kind enough to invite you for a nite of Netflix &amp; Chill?
---
It’s dumb that even putting mines around your camp is pointless since they disappear 
---
Yes as long as they dont entirely destroy my poer armor happened to me twice once from a lvl 28
---
PvE still needs to be balanced.
---
If you are destroying the queen in under a minute, then your PvE balance is all screwy.
---
Different builds should either have massive disadvantages in other fights, or should have a time to kill on the queen of roughly the same.
---
I can kill the queen under 2 minutes with Vanilla weapons / armour, and that is a problem.
---
There's nothing efficient about driking beer out of the beer hat mate...
---
Huh? Legendary items can be modified just like non-legendary can lol. Unless it's a quest item maybe
---
M'ama Dolces
---
Laser musket is pretty much the pipe laser weapon 
---
They really need to expand population for a server list to work though. With so few players per server there is a good chance that any server you lock yourself to would be empty almost every time you play.
---
Is the excavator only lvl 25 or can u get higher level version of it? 
---
Yeah that's true...
---
I think the plot device here to justify the art style is "West Virginia was not directly hit", something similar. I’m okay with that though.
---
With a stop and crouch effect... combine with sentinel’s to become a gun emplacement. 
---
I don't think factions will matter. People are quitting because they can't play a game they bought. I think it may end up as a class-action lawsuit long before Bethesda can implement all the fixes required to make the PvP mechanics work and not exploitable/hackable. The only real way to prevent a lawsuit at this point is to  give players the option to play in an environment free from the entire exploitable, hackable PvP system.
---
That's cool, It is just people don't know about the usual places for getting materials. Lucky hole mind for Lead, highschools for plastic, WestTek for... well, pretty much everything.
---
Wow. Awesome.  Thanks
---
All of the bonus ideas sound great! I wish we could at least get added Perception to things like glasses or goggles (especially the Medical Goggles). Added Charisma to the formal wear like the Red Dress would be nice too.
---
Can't even do that right, can only drop one!
---
You can make it initially at level 25, then you can make a 35 and/or 45 version.
---
It fires a second projectile at base damage, so not quite 100% damage increase, but at the cost of increased spread, low accuracy and double weapon wear.  Might be a bit too good but given its other drawbacks, it shouldn't be changed to 25%.
---
A friend of mine has an exploding Tesla gun
---
So you had 1k pds of 2 shot explosives?  .....
---
Nice likeness good job .. although you forgot to put the toilet cover down .. you're gonna get mauled by a cackle of females
---
nah, 60% or 72% if it's advanced turrets. Or maybe less, if he's a lucky one where his turrets take up less than 10% per turret
---
I feel like the fissure sites indicate impact nearby....could be wrong and the world itself may have been split from the bombs..
---
Whitesprings is good for quantity, not quality of legendaries.  Most of the ones you get there will be 1\* or level 35 or both.  It's all about Watoga.
---
Are you reading the comments attached to this post?
---
Excavator can be crafted at 25, 35, and 45 
---
I'm really bad at explaining how it was done so I'll gather up some photos, put it in another album and make a post about it so everyone understands later tonight. And thank you!
---
Saw that video, decided to give it a go.. only to end up in a completely empty Monongah :( Still puzzled as to why no ghouls did spawn.
---
Yup exactly
---
check above I included screenshots of ppl getting banned....if you need to get everything you know from news sites i feel sorry for you bruh.
---
Are the flamingos supposed to be a replacement for sheep? If this image gets out to hard you know they'll add sheep statues to the Atom shop at a discounted price of 1400 Atoms.  
---
Funny pic. I love the game btw, no hate. 
---
After the second it becomes routine. And chances are high they want to nuke either queen or whitesprings. So its not like ruining something. 
---
But stealing someones first nuke is beyond rude and should never be done.
---
Do I have to do that guest first before I can craft lvl 45 version of it because it doesn't show me other options than 25lvl 
---
That's funny, I never paid attention to it, LOL I just attacked them right away I guess because I see the red and assume they're hostile! Thanks for the info
---
So basically what you said was.. "dont nerf it, but nerf it"
---
"Pvp pussies": guys that need tse/super melee are people who suck in competitive gaming. If they made pvp base weapon dmg only you would see a significant decrease in griefing, complaints, and increase in PvP
---
My thought were kinetic servos. They are leg mods which increase AP refresh while moving. Seems almost essential for jetpacks since AP drain is huge. 
---
I'm on PS4, and almost all my interactions with other players have been positive or neutral. I usually don't have the mic on my headset (as my wife likes to take the opportunity to say the strangest things really loudly as she passes by), and I don't accept invites from anyone who isn't in my immediate area unless they are someone I've played with before. But thats because I usually run solo and it would affect my lone wanderer.
---
But at the same time, people are always waving to each other or rushing in to help out people getting swarmed. The other day I saw someone use the flare gun to try and signal for help and myself and at least two other people showed up to help a lvl 10 who was trespassing on mole miner property.
---
TL;DR: No one has offered to take me back to their C.A.M.P. for a good time, but no one has declined my offers for a good time. ;)
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Also forgot to add, at first I was against it but the herbivore mutation will be the end all to your aid with razor grain soups, food water and 60 hp, meat still does it’s effects and buffs but doesn’t give you food or hp, but with the soups I never even knew speed demon had a negative. And I didn’t start using class freak until recently because I looked up all the negatives lol
---
They're harassing everyone. It's just not worth it to me to switch out my gear and perks just to deal with some idiot; plus half the time the exploiting something in the game and I'm definitely not using my loot to deal with them. I'll usually make someone guns and armor if they're low level and let them shoot things first so they get points to level with. I think most of the people will help out, it's just that handfull that attack you while your checking out a vendors merch that has everyone sceptical.
---
Also in the nVidia settings be sure to set "Power Management Mode" to "Prefer Maximum Performance" or your GPU will underclock as well.
---
Aye. That’s why I blow them up.
---
No you can make higher level versions during that quest. The first set I made was level 35 during that quest if I remember correctly. I had just turned 35 and it opened up the option to make the 35 version.
---
The naming scheme in general sucks. 
---
Same thing goes for weapons. If you have a combat knife and make it serrated, now it's found under serrated, not combat knife.
---
The materials as well. Plastic is called molded plastic. Steel is called scrap steel. Why? It only makes things harder to find and adds nothing of value.
---
No not the damage to another player just dont destry the power armor
---
I had an explosive flamer, and the flame graphic has shitty range, but if you aim at far stuff, you'll find the explosions still work just fine. With two shot, they might not be accurate enough to use at range, but without that affix, it was super accurate.
---
Lead and Aluminium are the only things that lose weight when bulked. 
---
I had heard there were bugs with herbivore and carnivore. I would like to use herbivore, but I don’t want it to bug my other mutations. I’ll do some research, and if I can confirm its problems resolved I might just do that.
---
i am dying, lol :D (but might work)
---
I found one of these and stored it, figuring  a two-shot version might freeze SBQs quickly.    But the nerfed version may only send one projectile, which will make it less worthwhile.  I should have used it while I could. 
---
I wanted a co-op Fallout without the survival aspects. Carry weight, item durability, hunger and thirst, all make the game way too tedious. I get that some people like that, but if I wanted that, I'd just download a mod for that on FO4. Tack on all the things they've done post launch to make it even more tedious and extend the GRIND(spoiler alert: There's nothing endgame worth grinding for), I don't have high hopes  for this game's future. And actually, the way Bethesda acted as a company with this game's release has given me pause to purchase Starfield and ES6. I will probably will, but I've gone from a definite purchase sight unseen, to a wait and see attitude. I've never put Bethesda in that category before, and I've been playing Bethesda game since Daggerfall. 
---
Since I finished the game getting all the achievements, I just don't feel the urge to play it anymore. It's a shame as I think 76's storytelling is very compelling( I liked the aspect of piecing together stories via terminals, notes, and  holotapes. It's like solving a mystery) and I think the overall environment they created is really cool and fun to explore.
---
Its all fun and games until the second one decides to go straight down or hit an invisible wall
---
I'm lvl 60 and done with all quests available to me. I don't find resource farming to be fun so I just dick around. I often try and greet lower level players and give them stuff but they always run away from me. I find them at their camps, shoot a friendly wave, and all I see is digital booty fading into the distance. Being a good guy is hard when everybody runs from you. I promise, I won't kill your camp. 
---
Only the forest I believe plus it’s telling me that are all complete if I check on challenges it also come up with the bottom left confirmation of completing challenge
---
oops
---
Try a TSE weapon before they’re nerfed 
---
I'll try this on PC, but does anyone know if there're cache files or other FO76 files, other than in My Games and installation path, that should be deleted? 
---
I wonder if it's possible if you attach the servers to a region? I'm not sure how FO76 handles sharding or load balancing, but if a group of them are attached to a region then any players that contribute to say: [random server spun up for region X] would instead just be contributing to [region x]. 
---
Duping is another potential problem though. If one guy could complete the new build in under a day we're going to have problems, and if the total resources needed assume dupers are going to be involved then pseudo areas that don't have one are also going to have problems.
---
You could allow players (a single account) to donate UP TO a specific amount on a given day, but beyond that the "previous donation" actually has to be put to use before room could even be found for another.
---
All I want to do is cover my bed in gold bars
---
The unofficial etiquette when doing the Uranium Fever event with another player is to allow each person to get a tag in on the Legendary so everyone reaps the reward of a Legendary drop. 
---
I use a TSE handmade on normal enemies and bust out a two shot combat rifle for the Starred enemies. I also never join the Uranium Fever Event if someone is already there. I do this event a lot. 
---
Sadly, at the moment there are no medboxes to put on walls or else I would have used them too. I hope they add them in the future. Thank you for the idea about Charleston Station's cooking spit, I think I'll actually try and incorporate that into the build.
---
I don't have a bed for this build but I do have all the crafting stations. I replaced the ticket dispenser area for an armor and tinker workbench and opposite that, on the other end of the room I have the chemistry and cooking station. Outside has the power armor station and on the side near the stairs holds the weapons workbench.
---
Your idea about having dormer windows (thanks for teaching me this) is a great idea, it would definetely add a bit more style to camp building. Thank you for the great comment!
---
What about something simpler? A co-op mode where pacifist mode is forced on at all times, and only you can retrieve your dropped loot?
---
When I first started I teamed a guy from WV. It was great to have him explain things about some of the places we encountered.  He had an accent, sure, but its not like it took anything away from the experience. I've never understood that kind of behavior.
---
This is awesome. Nice job. 
---
I will work with strangers and talk but i don't accept invites because lone wanderer bonuses too good to give up. 
---
At level 60 I'm yet to meet a griefer. It's crazy how big this game is, so many people having completely different experiences
---
Love it.
---
I've been thinking that a hub is needed to facilitate the kind of online experience they're looking for.  Destiny has it.  The Division has it.  Bethesda could really make the fallout equivalent something special.
---
I've been having the issue in nuke zones when in a group that I will freeze up and when I log out and back in if I hit the b button I freeze up again with only being able to access the map feature. Tried teleporting and it's still the same. Only after leaving group and rebooting does it seem to fix it.
---
True I guess that’s the way to go. Do you know if marathoner does anything? 
---
Too bad you have to buy it back for full price
---
I've seen it as well, also dead.  I'm assuming it's just a mislabel and that it's not actually a vendor.
---
I want that damn sledgehammer but I dont want to do the quest too early. 
---
Per my understanding most AP refresh perks do not work while in PA.  
---
Marsupial and Birdbones mutations work well with PA.  
---
I do not. I haven't really played with it much. Marathoner only helps drainage on sprinting thought and a jetpack is a jump function so I wouldn't think so. 
---
Yeah, I was shocked when I found out they were included.  
---
In FO4 I was lucky enough to find an explosive combat shotgun early (around level 20-25) in my first play through. It absolutely trivialized the game from that point on. The only time I died was to myself, the occasional car explosion and the telltale whistle of a hilariously accurate long distance fat man shot.
---
And make sure not overencumbered.  Sonic will move faster.
---
You can make higher level versions during that quest and after it at your own Power Armor Workstation. The first set I made was level 35 during that quest if I remember correctly. I had just turned 35 and it opened up the option to make the 35 version in the crafting menu. Once you make it and register it you get the Power Armor Workstation plans also. If you're above level 35 or above 45 they will be available to craft. Click through it and it will show you other options for higher level versions.
---
The lmg makes no sense at all.  It’s grossly under powered for what it is.  Even at TS or TSE it’s just OK at best.  
---
It’s best use is burning through worthless 308 rounds late game as the hunting rifle also becomes pointless.
---
I used to keep them around to store different kinds of explosives in. 
---
All we can think from Bethesda's actions so far is that they don't give a fuck about PVE players and see them as mere fodder for any PVP tard that comes along - in hopes of getting some of that FortNite $$.
---
Prove me wrong, Bethesda.
---
We should keep saying it daily, hourly until Bethesda notices.  
---
They solved the wrong problem.  
---
People in Pacifist mode should not take damage from players, nor should their camps be damaged by players.   
---
NPC are just a way to convey plot points or game mechanics... These can be acheived with other means than NPCs.
---
I'm not saying Fallout 76 acheives this super well, but I don't think including NPCs would make Fallout 76 a better game.
---
Your wife is awesome! lol
---
Not much point when camps remain destructible by any bored PvP'neer that wanders by.
---
Level 0 is a thing?
---
They do I’m only using PA and it would be pretty annoying if they didn’t. But I guess it’s just Lone Ranger, Action boy and kinetic servo for the jetpack. 
---
Yeah I’ve thought about it but I’m actually not a huge fan of mutations. 
---
Yeah, I'd be all for an in gameplay way to get it though
---
It has been interesting and uplifting to hear all your responses! I'm glad that it didn't turn into anything unpleasant!
---
While I still can't make myself claim the development or many design decisions to be well executed, it is nice when a developer tries to do something new and while it still needs work, a lot of it, it does offer something rather unique and interesting. I will remain optimistic about the future of the game!

1) XBOX One

4) In my thirty minutes of playing this morning, twenty seven has been spent getting booted out of servers and having to reload. I never had this problem before the last update.
---
Speaking of updates, I don't get to play video games often, and having to spend 45mins ever other time I launch the game is absurd. I usually start playing other games while it loads in the background; eventually, I end up playing the 5 year old Just Cause 3 instead, and turn it off when the update is done.
---
If there was an option for a refund I would take it without hesitation.
---
Sounds good to me.  
---
Nerf it.
---
Do it.
---
Well..yes. 
---
also PC, never CTD before the last patch.  now it's every hour or 2
---
That is a statement of fact. She really is.
---
Yea TSE is awful in VATS because of the TS. Not sure why anyone would use TS weapons after this if you get+25% damage for twice the ammo count and crap accuracy. The explosive part was broken.
---
76 is a lost cause if you ask me. Fallout games need NPCs. You can’t shoehorn them in now but deciding to leave them out was a huge misstep.
---
I really wish people would stop trying to conflate the bobblehead stacking exploit and the nerfs that are taking effect.  
---
They are both detrimental to the game and need to be fixed. The stacking exploit is relatively new, but the discussion around two shot and explosive has been around for months.  
---
The only time the difference between 2k-3k damage and 20k-30k damage is relevant is SQB and slap damage ganking. Otherwise it’s sort of a non-point.
---
Totally agree. But make it really hard to get 
---
The disadvantage to the build is always being at less than 20% health.  There is no reason to “nerf” it.  
---
I figured he just means the direction Bethesda is taking, not your suggestion since they have done a lot of nerfing and very little buffing.
---
good to know
---
IMO workshop building spazzes the shitty creation engine causing disconnects.
---
i base this on absolutely no technical knowledge : )
---
Once you try mutations with Class Freak rank 3 you’ll never go back. 
---
Awesome work mate!
---
I love the game, I have the marketing and atom shop team
---
Yeah we tried not that helpful. Hopefully one day 
---
Maia is really hot
---
Lenin Prime
---
I get it all, except for two shot. Explosive yes, two shot no. Nerfing two shit is just going to make every vendor in the game suddenly have a ton of two shot guns. Why? Because two shot on it's own is not over powered. I have a TS pipe rifle on my second character and it helps but doesnt do more than my shotgun. I have a TS lmg and I can do more damage with one power fist punch than an entire mag from that gun, with heavy gunner (1st and second.) I just dont see the point and now I may as well sell them for the 12 caps itll give me because they've effectively become useless.
---
Because people like to be ugly to each other.   
---
If they can't have something themselves or they simply don't like others having it, they do everything to take it away from them.  
---
Even if they don't realize they will ultimately have to face that kind of thing too in return.   
---
My prognosis for the next year? After the TSE nerf, people will bitch about melee being way too strong. Nerf incoming. After melee is nerfed, they will nerf sneak/crit builds. Then some niche weaponry like the Cryolator, because freeze and stuff. Then some complete unexpected weapon that was discovered to be effective..  
---
This is what happens soon. But i will be gone by then. And that is a damn shame, since i really liked this game. But even then i can't defend it anymore. And i won't.   
---
(Sidenote. I do not have a TSE myself yet. It was one of the goals i did put up for myself, but now i can ditch it and forget about the game, since i am pretty much done with everything)
---
People who dont abuse tse get punished. Im lvl 203 and killed 1 dude cause he begged me so he would loose hid 5c bounty. In nukezone and evens i use mele unbuffed. Now nerfs are coming cause of bobblehead stacking fuckfaces! 
---
Nice view.
---
This is a fantastic idea but do we have confidence Bethesda could even pull that off?
---
I thought maybe you could have it based on either doing damage to any of the enemies within the event or a threshold amount of damage (say 2-3 mole miners worth), I guess you could then bar people from doing a token amount of damage to one enemy and still getting loot. Or you get the legendaries if you complete event objectives like repair extractors etc.
---
Also if the enemies came in set waves then the legendary drop for each wave as it were could be dependant on you actively participating in each wave (say if some one arrives after the first wave they will only get loot for the next two?)
---
I know this might not be the best use of Bethesda's resources right now, but it might make a nice QoL improvement, thought I'd bring it up seeing as they are looking for event based feedback right now, plus I was interested to see what other people thought.
---
Thing is, they should just reduce the weigt limit to like... 200/300 and make bulked junk, ammo and aid 100% weightless.
---
Those are just stacked items 
---
The problem is unique items, how many different combinations of pipe pistols do you think there are? Couple hundred, thousand even maybe
---
1 of every unique pipe pistol version together weigh much heavier on the server than having 100,000 bulked steel as that is just 1 item times 100,000 in count so the server only has to track two things there, 1 items times a count.
---
Whereas all the different versions of ipe pistols are their own thing
---
Same for me. I have fought the queen and won with a team, maybe a 100+ times. The only mod plan I ever got, was for rusty knuckles. On an Ultracite power armor.
---
It just sounds so counter-intuitive. Brand new material discovered, make a new form of power armor with it. How to make the fist hurt more in this mechanized, fusion-core powered 1-2 ton weighing war machine? Make the ends "rusty". 
---
They really should make it so you can't get the same reward over and over. It's extremely disappointing getting another 1 star legendary from the games toughest enemy, and 2 plans you learned the first time you took her down, 99% of the time. 
---
T-60 because it look awesome, and it's easy to find mods for
---
It can be done without bobbleheads. They run bloodied with real low health and unyielding to get their Strength in the 30s. Pop some drugs, add some mutations and other things.
---
I think they would have a counter. It would record how many total servers completed the project. If, say, 50% of the servers (or whatever) completed it, then it'd be in the game for everyone. Its kinda like how some MMOs and mobile games have events where its like "Kill x enemy 1,000,000 times (Community Event)!" and if that goal is met, every single player reaps the reward. Even folks who didn't participate. Same idea here.
---
Any pictures you've taken will unfortunately be lost as they are saved on your machine.
---
Thats not a bad idea, might not help if you were off in the other room defending an extractor or something though 
---
Workshops are designed to be highly contested limited resources.  It even gives you a warning.
---
I had one pop up outside of WhiteSprings. 
---
Needs nerfing!
---
Oh what you gain from being below 20% is HUGE, and with the bonuses to defence you are practically unkillable.
---
I run this build myself, I KNOW how strong it is.
---
So how would you stop someone abusing the system? Like laying down mines or firing mini nukes at random intervals? Or setting up a camp with loads of turrets nearby?
---
This might be the best solution for now, tbf the problem might be less acute with the Tse nerf but we'll see I guess 
---
Oh nice! Thanks!
---
Because... it's full of junk I've put inside? Surely I could have take something out to free up 30 pounds of space but then I'd have to sell/spend/dump it. Surely it would be better than losing 30 stable fluxes, but there also reasons #2 and #3
---
I've got a furious exploding laser gatling. Sadly that nerf to explosive is going to hit it pretty hard.
---
Maybe even a mass vote or pvp event on what faction will take over the structure permanently?
---
It would give a chance for players to fight for there factions and add a bit of lore to the game.
---
If what your saying is true your friends melee build is off 
---
Well if they were killing enemies to help out in the event wouldn't really matter how they do the damage, the turret thing is a good point, I guess the rewards could be locked to the event area so you can't just leave a wall of turrets next to a common event area i.e. you need to be there in the event with your turrets to get the drops rather than just rocking up after the event has ended
---
Tse is way op. We all knew this was coming
---
Chalice dungeons were the death of me
---
PC player since BETA and I have only had good experiences. I do find that most people dont use their mic, which is a shame. I do. 
---
As for events  - sometimes I'm running by on my way to something and I'm not interested in the event.  Some of them take a but of time ... which gets in the way of the thing I'm on my way to do. It's not you, it's me. 
---
Got on yesterday too.  Sold it in 5 minutes.  Garbage.
---
No. Wtf
---
Preach!
---
Hey, I got the barn building set plan from defending a workshop yesterday. Ign is the same as here, and I'm on PC. You can have it for free, I don't need it :) 
---
This guy gets it
---
The only thing I have to add: you don't really need almighty TSE to farm nuked Whitespings without any effort. I'm doing it with a good ol' All Rise and a melee build. And it's not nearly the most efficient build which does not require TSE. So while I agree that endgame is super repetitive, it's never about TSE weapons. 
---
ya this is why i dont share any of my camps online, and the more a location is promoted online as a good camp spot, the more players use it as their base, and the harder it is to find a server without someone already camped there.
---
[Yes?](http://rs10.pbsrc.com/albums/a109/notanirwin/robolenin.jpg?w=480&amp;h=480&amp;fit=clip")
---
Take a look at my post here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afjln4/psa_jetpack_essentials/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
There was some idiot lvl 100 one shotting enemies yesterday, dude already had a tse shotty. Taking kills from a lvl 35 guy. 
---
Definitely need a solution to this. Although I will say most people are pretty good about sharing.
---
If you just want to collect a bunch of random plans for building surprises later, workshops are the best. Pay some caps to claim (and get a plan) and hold 2 or 3 that are neaby each other. Every 15-30 minutes or so they get attacked. Defend (and get a plan) and repeat. 
---
And incredibly cheap to repair.
---
It’s been 50:50 for me.  Half the time the bot is slow moving and an easy target.  The other half it’s a damned aerial acrobat moving at speed.
---
Scrapping any weapon or armor will let you learn mods even if you don't actually have the plans.
---
Oh darn. Lol doesnt matter to me. I had some cool shots of the queen just spawning but if no pictures means I can play without crashes I'll take the trade off. 
---
 after playing a few hours this morning, I was literally just wondering the same thing.... Bethesda???
---
Sometimes I take a lot of damage and then I check my perks and oops I forgot I had put Hard Bargain on instead of Lone Wanderer. But obviously not the same issue you are having. Maybe it might help to take all your armor off and put it back on and take all your perk cards off and put them back on, just to make sure they are all applying properly.
---
Get rid of the legendary supervisors and give the legendaries as a reward for completing the event. Maybe change the supervisors to a higher level instead of legendary so they are still kinda like minibosses.
---
Yeah but see the problem isn't that melee is able to destroy PA, it's the common misconception some people have about the current progression of gear.
---
The fact is that currently, true endgame gear progresses past PA and back to normal armor.
---
PA is midgame gear, with normal armor returning in the endgame.
---
The reason for this? Legendaries.
---
Legendary armor exists that nearly make PA obsolete in almost every situation save for Nuke Zones.
---
It doesn't matter if you've got 3x the DR in PA if some leather armor set has access to Assassin/Sentinel/Vanguard with incoming damage reduction effects that trump pure DR.
---
The problem isn't just melee. I've met tons of people in PA that were far easier to kill with guns than people rocking full sets of legendary armor.
---
The solution isn't nerfing melee. It's the eventually inclusion of some PA pieces with legendary effects.
---
FO4 had a few already. And with the direction this game is headed, it's all but inevitable.
---
I hate steelheart too :P "what is he made of, paper" made me lol
---
You want lonevaultwanderer, not who you tagged.
---
I agree. My anti armour explosive, .45 sub machine gun brings them down fast. And I'm not even setup for a combat riffle build.
---
Yeah that was a funny scenario
---
I'm so sorry for you...
---
That's the one with the kitten in the tree right? That was hilarious. Predictable but still hilarious.
---
T-60 has decent stats and is the cheapest to repair.
---
x01 has the highest radiation resistance.
---
T51 is the most balanced in one in terms of resistances, though not as good in terms of radiation.
---
Ultracite has the best physical resistance.
---
Excavator gives you 100 extra weight, 200 with calibrated shocks.
---
Pick your poison.
---
I swear in the trailers I saw a bigger nastier version of those guys.
---
Rarely drops though. Patrol Duty prefers to give me multiple submachine gun, .44, shotgun, plasma gun or 10mm smg plans.
---
Ok,
---
well, maybe I can help you. What do you experience exactly? Just a Crash to the Desktop without any Warning etc or whats happening?
---
Thanks man 
---
there's the answer, nerf them to complete uselessness. Then make trading legendaries a thing of the past. Boom, the game is longer, fairer, and you're going to be farming for a while. Makes duping less damaging to gameplay as well.
---
It is what it is.
---
"Factions" are meaningless in Fallout 76.
---
But I want weapons that do 400% damage that trivialize all content so I can one shot everything before others can get a tag!
---
If two shot goes from 100% boost to just 25%, the total output of the TS LMG is still greater than the .50, but no guarantees you're hitting the same target unless you're aiming, which, close in, you don't always want to do.
---
I thought there are some random birds for flavor? Or am I mixing up 76 and 4?
---
Adding  comment as I've just come across this myself. Can't find any surface where I can place one.
---
Brilliant idea!
---
I hunt supermutants mostly
---
Yes. RNG.

Outstanding!!  Good work!
---
If you fancy a challenge (and you have the budget/desire) how about a footbridge/walkway going over the tracks?
---
It's ok thanks anyway. Did some searching and it seems lots of other ppl are also experiencing these problems. Hopefully bethesda improves the situation
---
They can't fast travel either so it is easy to get away. The system still sucks, but that's something.
---
My guess is they hijack the other boys
---
Thanks my guy! 
---
I always wondered if that also applied to the sleeping bag at the top of the church spire. That's not the ground. 
---
Honestly, if the scorchbeasts don't reproduce in one of these two ways I'd be shocked:
---
A. Insect nest style with small, useless drones for fertilization.
---
B. Angler fish, where the much smaller male gets absorbed in (less likely but freakier and less common than making them basically ants/bees)
---
I’m sorry to hear that man. I’ll try again today, but yesterday I got blue screened twice. 
---
We get it. You have the Hunter's Longcoat.
---
JK. Good tip. They look pretty nice stacking both metal doors too.
---
The local stuff is one of my fav things too. I live around Southern California, and one of my favorite things to do is go driving around the locations from New Vegas like the big ole dinosaurs (one has a creationist museum in it now) and Joshua Tree park and the like.
---
But there also, kinda jumbled up the locations of where things would be for game flow purposes.
---
Nsfw up just to protect any young super mutants on here.
---
I've had successany times on XB1X by unplugging for 30 seconds, which clears the cache. Only had to it twice with 76, but with No Man's Sky it was a semi-regular thing, and it worked wonders.
---
Those “fixes” didn’t work for my copy of Fallout 4. Hey if you got lucky and have no more crashes awesome!
---
Unpopular opinion, this isn't well thought out. It will be annoying if you help build this and it isn't built on every server. So the alternative is everyone builds it which is the same as nobody building it. Just a resource dump that will eventually happen when Bethesda says it is done. This type of game mechanic never works well on mmo like games. You would need dedicated personal servers.
---
Brilliance
---
I'm not saying I believe you, but I am saying that after sexylegs Mr. Handys I can't say that I don't believe you just because it looks "silly"
---
Take the upvote, you made my morning!  And gave me an idea of what to watch this afternoon lol
---
I disagree with the events being good - all that time spent for maybe 1 3\* legendary, Uranium Fever isn't even lvl 50, AWOL Armaments usually only yields 1 3\* opponent even.  These events are a step in the right direction but still rather dull, once you've done them a couple of times, it gets OLD quick.  I'd rather just play whack-a-ghoul even.
---
Not much of a hunt though. Nuke drops, players gather, queen attacks. And as of last night she lasted 2min if that. With 8 people on my server. PS4
---
This is a exploit.
---
My biggest concern is fixing the legendary drops. 3 star enemies still not dropping 3 star loot, sometimes not even dropping legendary loot. Only to show up later as a 1 star in another corpse. As well as the alleged “Random Generated Loot” I’ve been getting the same exterminator combat armor left arm 1 star three times this week n have yet to have a single explosive weapon drop currently level 79 on PS4. 
---
I certainly die whenever I swap guns in low life mode. Bloodied gauss rifle (1 star) and berserkers explosive handmade (2 stars).  This happens in my base. The game must briefly reset all stats or perks on swap, maybe unyielding armor is causing this???
---
Bruh, Fallout 76 is an MMORPG. Yeah it's not ESO, but this still meets the criteria for an MMO.
---
But even if it's not, are experience boost okay in games like COD? The faster you level the faster you get new guns, perks, etc so it must be p2w. My progression as a new player has zero effect on a level 60, 90, or 200 in fo76. My progression period has no effect on you what so ever, regardless of your level or attitude (I've been leveling since this began, and you haven't exploded yet). If you decide to level up 15x faster than me, it has zero effect on me because everyone in this game is already 130+ levels higher than me, and I dont go around the mall wondering how fast they're leveling. It doesnt affect me, it affects nothing. If someone pays to unlock ever plan to craft weapons and armors, with ever mod available:it still doesnt affect me or you, or anyone else in the server. They have a cool gun, wooeee, if they're level 25 and you're level 50 they will get smoked regardless. 
---
Pvp is broken in this game, is it cool that I grind for a twenty hours to make PA, just for some dick head to break it while im in pacifist mode? What is the point of pacifist mode.
---
The cost of these plans is irrelevant since they have no defined value to an atom shop. But regardless, it would still be fair to other players, because as I said pay to progress has zero effect on you or anyone else but the player. If armor comes out that makes you invincible that's ptw. If it takes me 100 hours to get to lvl 75 instead of 120 hours, that is not pay to win. Yall are being childish in your reasonings when a system that I proposed is fair to not only us but the company who many have said are not spending any money currently in shop. No money means fewer updates, fewer expansions, and then a sooner rather than later death to the servers. Get the fuck over yourselves.
---
It's something to do with the gun clipping thru them when you miss point blank
---
The combination of a Bethesda game at release and it being a multiplayer game at release are a few of the reasons I never touched the beta and wasnt in a rush to play it until they got a few bug fixes out c_c On the other hand, I don't gotta mash F4 ever 10 minutes to make sure I dont lose my progress like the other games... but then again, I HAVE had to go back and redo whole quest chains because of a crash while playing with my friend. But most of my fun has been in exploring and figuring out the stories and all so I guess it didnt bother me too much.
---
I always do the "follow me" emote on Uranium Fever when a Legendary spawns to allow everybody to get a hit. I'm level 107 or so, so I'm usually the highest lvl there. I let the lower lvls get a hit and theb obliterate.
---
Uranium Fever has turned to shit for me recently, though...not getting legendary pieces dropping over lvl 35. Anyone else having this issue?
---
Look up how to get excavator powered armor and work on that.
---
I guess I'm waiting a few more years then!
---
What's lvl 0? Does it roll back after lvl 999?
---
I was grinding legendaries for a few weeks and finally got an explosive (not 2 shot) lever action mid week. Love that gun!! I maxed explosives perk and fireproof. I'm pretty salty people abused and exploited the game mechanics to nerf my weapon. I wonder if just giving either one effect or the other on guns would have been a better fix? I understand the reasoning behind but it still stings.
---
Guess I will have to see what happens with the patch.
---
Not near as high level as the east side of the map though. The quest can easily be done at level 25, at least it was for me the two times I've done it at that level.
---
Well I only just unlocked the painted doors and while I was checking them out it snapped on. I'm not trying to exploit the game.
---
West Virginia!
---
How do you lock doors? People just come into my house and it’s really annoying 
---
Yeah have them.
---
We should be able to sell SBQ plans back for double...oh wait, we can’t sell plans - forgot.   
---
Fuck, man! That's super rough. I can totally feel where you're coming from; that would be really disheartening.
---
Even though they probably won't be able to do much, throw a ticket at Bethesda. Worth a shot.
---
Do I have to buy them in bulk?
---
Not an exploit. Just a salty player. 
---
Rule of thumb: can you kill a mirelurk queen in less than two seconds? If so however you did it will get nerfed.
---
Do you have the ability to craft them ? Also if yes are you on ps4 ?
---
Tis a little buggy i just race back and forth between the two pads and until it updates to hit the master button.
---
Sometimes it just takes abit to register both at the same time.
---
Yeah, about the ammo count... they aren’t changing that part. Still one bullet per shot.
---
These people don't understand how video games work, save your breath.
---
On my third character, I got the Marsupial mutation at Level 8 or so.  It was such a game-changer that I immediately did my research on keeping mutations and eventually followed a tip that I found online about the Nuka vendor.  It turned out to be super-easy to keep mutations early on, especially when you have the best mutation for kiting/avoiding enemies.
---
lvl 112 here, and i still havent found a behemoth even when i go to the lake looking for the dedicated one =/
---
I wont say I wasn't looking forward to finding people alive somewhere, maybe locked in a bunker or at the top of an old resort tower and refusing to talk to anyone out of their sealed vault, but quite a few quest lines and stories play with that expectation in entertaining or at least dramatic ways. A lot of the quests (when they work, and not going into great detail) were really rather clever with how they surprise you once you think you know what's going on. The Top of the World quest line, that one with the nanny bot looking for her lost kid in the water park, tracking down the girl in the bunker in the free states in the east and the Mistress of Mystery quest lines all kinda went in different directions that I wasnt disappointed in.
---
But I feel ya, especially not having text chat and most people (myself included) dont really want to voice chat with random people makes communicating with strangers you come across in game sort of like coming across a stray dog on the street, don't really know if its gunna be a good boy or glitch out and extend its limbs slender man style and start exploding you.
---
Might want to look into the opening of AQ40 in wow, they did something like this and it was a hot mess.
---
You cant make bulk ammo
---
Destroyable camps is idiotic. I hate that game mechanic. You can't destroy builds in the world. Camps should be the same.
---
X box

Crash144019
---
Unable to apply level 3 mods to armour despite having the required perk and materials 
---
Yeah, had the same issue. Just follow the prompts - One time, it had me go from switch 1, to 2 and back to 1, and another time, I had to hit them 1,2,1,2, and then the master switch inside the building I was able to hit. There is some decent junk in the locked drawers in that building, and I believe there is a workshop nearby in a garage that you can break it down.
---
Sounds like something is broke af if his level showed up as zero. Also my guess is that is related to him being able to one shot you with slap damage, or past it somehow.
---
Hey bud, if you highlight the challenge there are more details. It gives you a list of all the possible factories (more than 5). You just need to find em
---
The funny thing is some people are against the balance and actually want that.. its mind blowing. lol 
---
That's terrific.
---
I guess workshops are suppose to be a pvp thing, I mean the resources you get are pretty small anyway. It is a dymb system that pushes pvp on those who don't want it.
---
They can also IP ban a player if they choose to do so and prevent players from using VPNs to access the game so that they can't create another account and buy more copies of fallout 76.
---
Not really no. It's like 10 meter distance, that's the closest I could get :(
---
Let's hope the dupers are gone.  They will build whatever it is in 5 minutes.  Otherwise I love this idea.
---
haha I'm just about there, I've taken my time and slowly explored most locations on the map, currently trying to figure out what to do next because my main source of enjoyment has been the exploring. I've tinkered in the nuke zones and upgraded some things (and accidentally deleted by Ultracite armor when I logged in one day thinking it was a gliched extra empty power frame my drunk ass picked up the previous night...), but I get what you mean. I'm thinking maybe when they start releasing DLC the closed vaults will be some kind of end game dungeon for people to run together.
---
It's possible but I don't think so, unyielding doesn't affect hp or endurance for this reason on purpose. However I've certainly had unyielding on every time it's happened so it's possible. I have noticed though that the game stops registering rad damage correctly at a certain point. Like it seems like after 5% life it stops visibly decreasing the size of the hp bar even though you are still losing hp and will die.
---
The only thing I remember being like this is the robots in watoga, mainly protectrons. On some I could waste an entire shotgun mag, and others three shots does it.
---
Incoming damage seems consistent though. Are you using Dodgy? You can feel like a god until you’re out of AP.
---
&gt;2) Incidentally, by nerfing TSE they are going to cripple the EBAY economy that has sprung up from duping.
---
Oh sure. Have you checked the prices of things. TSE's being sold for few dollars. Full sets of armor 40 dollars. Yep.
---
Damn... you made me remember my usual hobby when making a place my home on any Bethesda game... actually putting stuff from my inventory on shelves, tables etc. Oh any you know... being able to literally move shit. I can tell the second wish is hard or impossible to do on an online game but the 1st one... what we all want, they could just add an option on the pipboy, to choose a particular or a set amount of items, so that we can place them as statics in our camp. Have them able to be rotate-able as well.
---
I doubt they would be performance intensive, or if that is a concern, just limit the amount of "inventory" items that we can place in camp to like 50 or so, or only allow a percentage of the budget to be used for said inventory items. I mean, their world/ 3D models already exist and having them be placed as statics would eliminate most performance problems anyways. I believe this is a solid suggestion.
---
bro im sorry man, wish you used better judgement. Hope you get back on.
---
Station? I heard that it was the bot in the town, is it both?
---
He is using a game bug to his own benefit. That is the textbook definition of a exploit.
---
They definitely can shoot you if you aren't at the workshop.
---
But it's unlikely they'll follow you across the map
---
I know this is a joke buy your character needs sleep! Well rested is 5% more xp for 2 hours when you sleep at your camp for about 30 seconds 
---
Maybe it’s because of the enemies damage resistance?
---
Do I have to buy them in the quantities you listed?*
---
I would totally steal this idea... if I had any budget left.
---
I remember. One of my NV chars had a drinking problem, my tub in Novak was full of money and alcohol. 
---
So much so that when I opened the door, if they moved my game would crash. 
---
I think that’s why we’ve been downgraded to dropping things in bags. I mean, if you log in and the game drops your base with all its ‘loose’ junk, BAM, black screen/title screen. 
---
I just wanna ‘pick’ things up like in previous games where they hover on your cursor. 
---
LEMME SPELL STUFF WITH THE BODIES OF THE SCORCHED DAMNITT!!! 
---
It is buggy as but with persistence by far the easiest way to complete an event and get some easy stuff. Just spam those buttons as quick as you can 
---
Yah, the notes are... interesting. Some of them make me want to systematically go around exploring them and figuring out where some are leading the player and write it all down somewhere. Sometimes following where a note leads you makes you notice things you didnt before. Like there was one note I found saying something like "I hope you're doing well at this one farm, please dont forget to feed (some weird name)" signed some raider name. So I went back to the farm poking around, and I find a dead cat in the upper floor I never noticed before with that weird name. There's a note in Point Pleasant church I kind of want to follow up on too where the responders send people out to particular locations to gather supplies, it may be worth going there to see if you could find the bodies.
---
I'm in agreement with the folks here who think the 2-shot nerf is a misstep. Accuracy and recoil had already been balanced on 2-shot weapons. The proper response, in my humble estimation, would have been to simply prevent explosively affixed weapons from being affected by perks or Bobbleheads. Create an AoE damage scaled to the base damage of the weapon and leave it at that.
---
What was done simply locks in gains for some folks who cheated (understanding that *many* did not!) by sapping the second-tier weapons.
---
Other than that, great post!
---
Thanks. I know the crackdown is on duping and hoping they go easy on me once they see the messages from the guy who dropped them. I wish they would just delete the guns or something rather than a ban without warning. 
---
Hmm, I mean, I can do it in games I can do it in too! 
---
Too bad this isn’t one of those games I can do it in. 
---
🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Naw u can buy however many u want
---
Have you paid your protection caps today?
---
Mhm. Used to have a cabin by a river. It had a nice view into the distance... One day, it just suddenly dissapeared. I then just moved on and went to Whitesprings...
---
Good.
---
If you pull apart your blueprint you can rebuild it back the way you want it bro.
---
What is the point of having a locked door at your camp. Am a missing something?
---
Wait... you used your blueprint instead of simply replacing your camp from storage??  You don't have to pay to rebuild if it comes out of storage instead of using the blueprints tab...  
---
Oh you poor sod...  I feel for you.
---
If you're on PC, look me or my teammate MofoJoker up.  We're help you get settled right straight with a barnraising party or something.
---
Actually you can put as many doors on one frame as you want in testing my buddies and i built 100 yes one hundred doors on a single frame lol
---
Highlight the door on edit mode and hit the f key (of you are playing on console the appropriate key will be on the opinions on the bottom of the screen menu). That will lead you to a screen with multiple choice of lvls of locks, chose one and voilá. That works on extractors and watter purifiers too.
---
Always did this with a friend, and swiped at the same time....
---
I moved my camp out between Camdon park and the nuka cola factory. Turns out it's a popular location because I'm hardly ever able to have my camp spawn in. Someone else's is always there. I'm mostly homeless looking for a new place to plop down. 
---
You ground a boring meta for a crutch. Man up and play it legit. If you can’t, you just prove who’s the real weaksauce.
---
He doesn’t really have any outfits, pretty much all camp plans. It’s best to try to invite a friend and jump in and out of the server a bunch. The Park Bench Plan seems really hard for most ppl and was my last camp plan, it took 37 million jumps to get haha 
---
Only if it doesn't activate on slap damage. The troll potential would be massive if not. 
---
I recall one of the statements from Bethesda being "Were not including a radio host in the game because people will find their location and kill them regularly" ...still kind of wish the game had a DJ though. 
---
Some enemies like gutsies seem to have ludicrous armor pen
---
I like this idea, but it might be hard since specific servers are so isolated from one another. There would have to be mechanics added to take that into account. Games like Elite Dangerous have community goals down really well. BGS may want to take some notes... Though ED is a single world everybody logs into.
---
I got mine from Ohio river adventures, on the right side of the map near the Nuka cola building. It was in a little shack on a shelf
---
thanks for replying 👍
---
https://youtu.be/R5SPoGvbnaM Yeah I just found this video, bethesda need to sort this bug out considering it goes back to fallout 4, I thought this was genuine from my use of the prison door and regular wood door. Changing flair to "bug"
---
Was looking for an answer for this and will confirm that it is the flechette harpoon gun. Good work, all.
---
Always down for a barn raising ( IGN = HeroJoker1992 ).
---
I didn't know you could pull it apart. It's not big deal. I'll build a different set-up somewhere else. I'd like to find a spot that's relatively flat for farming and woods for hunting in the SE region. 
---
His main goal is to fly to the Moon and paint it pink.
---

---
Oh god imagine seeing that, watching as one of your buddies gets gunned down, the attacker charging up to his body, eating part of him then carrying on his rampage towards the rest of you.
---
Wait wut? how do you replace a camp from storage?
---
I'd rather have to run a difficult dungeon and everytime you get a plan for a differnt part of the body, but not the same multiple times
---
You’re fine. I think that guy is mad about having a toy taken away in a patch or something.
---
Same here, 1080Ti and R7 2700x, when crossing the bridge from Charleston station or walking down the road to the Capitol building
---
There are also times when you load into a game and it "can't load your camp." I've had it happen to me on several occasions. I just server hopped and it came right back up. 
---
Please upvote.

love this! 🤔 makes me wonder if any liberty prime schematics are laying around in wasteland. Even if it took 10,000 screws, thatd be a fn sweet gift for queenie.
---
Sucks. lol. Constantly looking for a good spot with good resources around.
---
One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the bypass of upper level Perks.  
---
Heavy Gunner perks, for example, give 10% for the first level, then only 5% thereafter.  Lots of advice can be found when using these sets of perks (also for melee or rifle builds) only to take the first one, and save the perk for something other than the 5% extras for level 2-3, saving 6 cards or so.  
---
Would be interesting to see if the TSE nerf increases use of these perk cards, or if Bethesda might increase them in potency.
---
Tickets about what exactly?
---
Yes, ban him Bethesda
---
/s
---
You're fun at parties aren't ya. 
---
A huge improvement would be simply that you can’t find a plan twice. That way you are much more likely to get that plan you want eventually 
---
It was destroyed from the nuke. I thought the camp platform might still be there and not fully recalled back to my inventory. HOPE got me nowhere. lol
---
Probably protesting all the vault dweller immigrants looting everything that isn’t nailed down.

send me your  psn, ill hook you up. just bring me some oil.

WS is the best spot I've found. Besides the Ghoul attacks. I set it down within range of the border patrols to help with that.

It’s not an exit indicator. It’s a quest indicator.  You should turn off tracking for quests you aren’t currently doing.  Problem solved.

It's not bugged, you have about 4 secs to go from 1 keypad to the other, so once you hit 1 keypad just rush to the other. It seems it's meant to be done by 2 ppl but it's totally possible to do it solo
---
They're part of the protest march event in Grafton. You can equip the signs yourself.
---
I'm all for something like this. To an extent, though, it actually could be repeatable. I'm thinking of something like in Warframe, when there was an event where the player hubs were attacked. Several of the defence missions failed, and those hubs were actually destroyed. Then, much later, the players were able to rebuild. Something similar could be done, where a rare event would threaten something built, and how well the players do at repelling the threat determines the extent of damages, which can then be repaired again in a later event, creating a nice gameplay loop.
---
really? those sly bastards
---
They need to have dungeons and enemies that force different playstyles or make it advantageous to coop with other builds for support. 
---
I love the Diamond city part. People want a hub so why not make a place on the map where everyone can build, sell, and keep them attached to the server. You could even make it like a workshop where you buy a plot and get 25%xp boost, 100 caps per hour, and events! PvP could make it to where factions can take it over giving members free plots and decreasing the benefits of other factions
---
Nowhere does it say everyone has to get a piece of everything, take your own advice and "man up" and accept the fact that you wont get to get something from everything.  I personally dont want to have to put multiple shotgun shells into a molerat at point blank for it to die or be forced j to a melee or bloodied build to be able to do any real damage to any given mob.  I use an anti armor explosive double barrel and it still often takes 2 shots to kill many enemies at level 50 or above due to weapon spread etc.  Just because YOU dont lime sonething does not mean others dont like it.  The only two shot weapons i use use are prime handmades for scorchbeast kills, one is two shot one is tse and the only things those o e shot are scorched.  Meanwhile i watched buddies 3 man sbq in under a min using only melee, that seems way more op as NONE of my weapons can do as much damage to her in a full min of shooting as they were doing per swing in melee

Go to your stored tab. There will be blueprints for your preexisting structures in there.

Love it just one thing added if they give this to us i want to see our build size grow larger and split into three.

☆ Defense 100%

I’m on PC and haven’t had many griefers, maybe 2-4 at best. However I have received invite request several times. It seems those invites come at the most inconvenient times too.

I believe this could be an issue of having to pay for the right to them again right?. Guessing they will add more in the future just might not see all the old ones return.
---
ok thanks for this info
---
I guess he added the video after your reply.
---
Debatable, I would argue that the already existing budget they have given us is determined to be the most ideal because more than that could potentially strain the server/ decrease performance. A good suggestion if they significantly stabilize their server infrastructure though.
---
at no material cost?
---
Same thing happened to my gf last night. We keep having issues playing as a group where if we fast travel or enter buildings one of us just disappears to the other. So after this happened she logged out and back in to see if it would fix the issue. It did, however her main weapon now no longer exists in inventory. Nothing special about the item, it wasn't legendary but she did have it modded just how she liked it. We feel your pain.
---
Thank you for these posts!
---
Well shit... I never even thought of that lol. But I'm sure they could get some or most of the songs.
---
“All weapon types to be viable” yes yes yes I could not agree more! 400 rounds .45 ammo to take down 3 star hermit crab only for no legendary to drop what in the fuck! 
---
What happens with the Friendly Fire charisma perk and this thing?
---
I built a cabin out in the lake by Thunder Mountain. You can place your Camp on a boat in the middle and build from the ground where it isn't too deep. I figured who the hell is gonna attack me here?
---
Well, a random-ass Mirelurk Hunter who swam out to say hi was annoying enough. But one time I spawned into my camp and as I arrive and walk inside I see 4-5 scorched spawn INSIDE my bloody building and then three scorchbeasts spawn over the lake. 
---
TL:DR Nowhere is safe.
---
Yes. It consists of what you already had built prior to moving
---
Most folks think it is the system catching up on ammo usage.

I’ve watched for it on occasion and noticed the ammo isn’t actually removed, and it’s count is what I just expended prior to the message.
---
Or, hear me out on this, they do nothing and you keep buying power armor skins. Thanks.
---
Ok yea the bunker venders were glitching but I have a map of all the vender locations but thnx
---
So teamwork.  Thanks everyone.
---
I've just finished building a camp that hangs over the side of a cliff. Just a 1x1 entrance on the top then everything else built downwards over the side. 
---
I've never had trouble with players at any of my camps but if anyone does come inside causing trouble, I'll just log off and be content in the knowledge that they just plummeted to their probable death.
---
if you reload 10 bullets and then pick up something the amount you reloaded will be shown as removed 
---
They need to focus on stability always first the servers are still in dire need. But if they give us more camp options we need more room to go with it. But structures are amazing but very very bare and no defenses. But i have my shop, crafting area and my outpost built into the highways of the Mire themselves.
---
Currently i don't even go for atom shop camp stuff because i could not place them. Seen things i want from it ( R door) but stuck for room.
---
couldnt agree more
---
Exactly. It's just a delayed message for inventory.
---
Melee dosen't need a nerf and TSE donsen't need a nerf either, what needs a nerf is the stacking bonuses from magazines and bobbleheads. It needs to be changed so activating 2 or more of the same magazine or bobblehead won't have stacked effects, just like eating food that has a +1str and another food that has a +2str won't give you a +3str.
---
Yeah because 1k nominal damage is totally not OP? 3k is still not OP. Even 6k with sneak bonus is not OP. Because ultimately when you set your mind to it, nothing is OP.
---
At least TSE shotguns are totally not OP.
---
I don't need or want your sympathy lol. I am stating that they took the last objective away from me and probably quite a few people had after playing for countless hours. Games like this are deigned to chase loot. TSE was all that was out there that was better than what I had. For me it was about finally getting one, not stealing kills at the golf course or oneshotting players. I have played this game longer than most, so I if I stopped playing today I could say I got my moneys worth out of the game. All I was getting at is removing things for endgame players to do will cause a drop off in players. I don't know how many people are in my shoes right now, but I bet I'm not the only one. It is tough for developers to bring players back, and it will be even harder for this game. The game has potential, and it would be a shame to see any players get bored and leave, but that is what is happening.
---
Yes that is the real problem i believe thats how they destroy power armor
---
Finally someone who speaks truth
---
If your on PC grab the mod buddy it even had a robot dj lol.
---
What was it? 
---
As someone with an explosive gun (not TSE) whose mediocre weapon is getting nerfed......
---
I absolutely think that melee needs to be nerfed also.
---
Just get rid of PvP altogether or at least give them a server of their own 
---
I play a sneak mellee ninja and with Stealth 3 and muffled and shadowed mods on my armor I can basically walk right up to pretty much anything and it will go into caution but almost never danger. Hit and kill the 1st guy with a sneak attack and then just walk over to the next guy. Doesnt usually work with PvP but the sneaky playstyle is crazy OP. 
---
You do realise that by nerfing TSE they are making the vast majority if current builds unplayable right. TSE brought balance between ranged builds and melee builds. Before those weapons were common 9/10 random players I met in high level areas used melee now it is about 2/10. 
---
I heard that you need to have a pistol in you in order for him to shoot. Never tried it so I don't know
---
Liberator prime. I love it
---
wow glad to see im not the only one who used to fill bathtubs with prewar money!!!
---
Thanks. I assume a ticket is a way of contacting Bethesda? 
---
Do you have any 308 rounds if so i could by a few from you for about a hundred and fifty caps
---
Surprised he actually had the sign "on" him. Half the time I kill shotgun wielding scorched they drop axes or pipe weapons.
---
I finally found a legendary Tesla last night during a queen fight, but it wasn’t in my inventory when I went to check it after. Earlier in the evening I had the name of a grognaks axe change from “mutant slayer” prefix, to no prefix, and finally return to mutant slayer. 
---
I don’t know if something weird is recently happening with inventory items, but it’s frustrating to say the least.
---
A former US soldier in the brotherhood of steel. Fitting but I thought you would be Enclave.
---
A very good idea heck we had this in FO4 and i would love this.
---
Well i think we all would... the atom store prices are a joke lol.
---
You're missing out. Some of the best mob battles down there. Bring lots of ammo though.
---
You're so right... lol
---
What about 4 leaf clover? The constant crits are so sexy
---
A very very badly done "coop" fallout with little to no Fallout flair in it. Choices? Pff who cares you're the NPC in this world just like Bethesda wants you to be. Worthwhile quests? Tough luck as most quests merely tell the tales of a dead person you have literally no attachment to since you've never actually seen any of them. 
---
Sorry buddy but it most certainly isn't the online Fallout game everyone wanted for a long time. If anything Bethesda took the wishes of the community and bastardized it into F76. Now F76 might be what you wanted from an online Fallout game but it's most certainly not what everyone wanted from it. Add to that the sheer incapability of Bethesda to develop a somewhat working game and you've got one of the worst games of 2018. And believe me when people were talking about a coop fallout they most certainly didn't talk about a game that would become known as one of the worst Fallout games that have been released to date. Bethesda screwed all that up big time. But i am not really surprised considering Bethesda couldn't even be bothered to think up a proper "end game" boss and shoved in a reskinned skyrim dragon. Shows just how much effort went into this game...0.
---
I have yet to see a higher level player do anything but try to help. 
---
My first experience: I started playing 4 days ago, came out of the vault and ran into a camp. No idea what I was doing so I walk around found some scrap, water and looked around the house. It was a lvl 101 player, he waved and started following me around. Creeped the hell out of me because he was wearing a trench coat and hazmat mask, ALWAYS behind me for like 10 minutes. After a bit he asked to team up and for the next 2 hours followed and helped me (revive me, kill brahman for food, gave me some small supplies) finally I found out how to build my camp, ran out of resources after building the floor and 3 walls.. I guess he realized I ran out so he runs over and finished building the camp, built me workbenches, defense, built me armor with pockets, gave me a few weapons.
---
I have been attacked my people 2 times and they were lvl 8 and 12.. from what I’ve seen the higher the level the nicer players have been :)
---
&gt;They need to scan more accounts to find more exploiters. Since we all currently have TSE weapons. 
---
I don't. I might need to get one though since my all my guns are getting nerfed a lot, them being mostly two shots and one is instigating explosive.
---
They already did notice. After everyone cried about two shot being removed they went and edited their patch notes saying it was “misquoted” so it will still be an obtainable drop. I think everyone should just play the game as intended instead of every single player running the same build just to troll and pvp players. 
---
For sure. If you go [here](https://help.bethesda.net) and choose Fallout 76, scroll past the FAQ's, and "submit ticket" near the bottom. It should guide you through the rest.
---
Just a tip, I'd copy/paste your text box for the ticket in case it goes all glitchy and doesn't submit it, losing all you've written. I'm having issues submitting tickets via Edge (I know, shitty browser) on my phone. Just to save you from salting the wound :P!
---
I would be ok with thay
---
Yesterday in 6 hours of play I experienced 1 disconnect and one crash (directly after the disconnect) 
---
I'm not sure which of our experiences is a one-off, but my teammates also experienced the disconnect.   But not the crash. 
---
A great tip for your map system would be adding a notification icon next to new additions (on RDR2map as well!)
---
I’m on Eu
---
I think you need to have the cannibal Perk. 
---
On ps4. But ty
---
If they did this guaranteed that your stuff would get stolen for sure.
---
I just wanted different stash containers for different thing.
---
Hmm, weird. I just shot exactly 2000 rounds to prove what you are saying, and I only got 30% of the durability down. And I didn't even use the perk Gunsmith for better durability.
---
If u put a skin u can't sell it?
---
I will be getting this!
---
It fits with the whole rebuilding thing if we also repopulate and bring people in from outside the region once the scorched threat has been defeated. I can only hope this is Bethesda's long term plan.
---
4 had crows and gulls
---
PvP was the downfall of this game.
---
What did people expect in a game with legendary weapons, armor, bobbleheads, mutations, etc.? 
---
PvP will never be balanced. You have zombies mindlessly hacking away at ghouls at Whitesprings hoping to get a god roll drop so that they can wreck people in PvP but as soon as people get that God roll everyone who doesn't have one cries for a nerf.
---
I never random invite, I ask them first
---
yea i was told lol feel real dumb now but im getting these knocked out now thanks btw you guys rock 
---
As far as banked currency goes, we have it already in the form of Watoga High School halloween candy. Just need that implemented in more places.
---
Yup. I have camo on my recon rifle and combat armor, they never show up at vendors anymore.
---
I thought it's automatic pistol. But since the other guy said yes, maybe I'm wrong. I have one as TS but haven't used perks on it.
---
I also want to know the answer to your question. Hopefully someone knows
---
What’s your intelligence at? The higher it is when you scrap the better for learning mods. Are you running anything that reduces it? Taking the right kind of mentats when you scrap? 
---
Once you do look for me HeroJoker1992 i am the community stash of sorts for the chat mod community. People donate their plans and recipes to me. Then using the Known plan mod they take the plans they require.
---
Take what you need and give only what you can is the rule.
---
I think I’m close to 500?  I’m not exactly sure though. But I’ve been playing since beta. I played all but one of the two or four hour betas. Although lately I’m not playing as much :/
---
Im around 160 hours i think
---
Yes, on Bethesda's customer support, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Not like they will be banned, but hey.
---
I am at about 200 hours and still loving the game. I would like to play more than I have time.
---
Love this idea, have hostels in there where people can rent a bed, loads of workbenches etc. Game is missing a central hub, and I love the idea that we, the players would build it. You could also have an event where a horde of supermutants or scorched or whatever are converging on our community. Put out a call to arms (so just have a set time and date when they will arrive) calling all players to log on at same time to defend. 
---
An auction house, if we build a town lets include an auction house
---
I went in to sbq with someone who had a tse and used 70 explosive bobleheads. The fight still took 8 minuts. If he hadn't been exploiting bobleheads then it would have taken more. 8+ minuts is more than enough to hit the queen twice or even more
---
If you scrap a chassis the armor goes into your inventory.   Did it on accident recently. 
---
A little over 800 hours now, Still loving it.
---
Yeah but alone it's going to need much more investment into perks to make it decent, bloodied will help too but it's still going to be severly nerfed.
---
My intelligence is 11.   I hadn't thought of taking mentats while scrapping but that is something I will definitely start doing now.    Thanks for that tip.
---
I'll try but it keeps telling me to download a Bethesda launcher 🤷‍♂️ if there is a 1% chance these scumbags get banned, it's still worth doing.
---
Haha same here with the two of us. We will frequently crash and then exclaim our anger. Sit around for 20minutes, and then hop back on lol
---
I think the average is around 50 at this point.  I dont see a lot of new people anymore. 
---
Btw: great job...me too
---
I didn’t know intelligence affected this!  I’m going to start picking up mentats......
---
Don't even know anymore i play every second i am not working...
---
Excatly why i stopped posting after my first comment, everyone has their own opinion and wanna state it. 
---
To be honest, the scorched are just dumb zombies and that's what they feel like in the game. They're a lazy enemy archetype and it's disappointing that Bethesda chose to base their cannon fodder on what are essentially just feral ghouls who look slightly different. Not to forget the dragon-like scorched beast... I mean... come on.
---
Damn! That’s wild. 
---
If weapon has base damage of 100 then currently exlosive effect makes it 100+100. After patch it's going to be 100+20. Modding the receiver will increase the 100 part without effecting the +20 from explosive.
---
For your information, I. The current state of the game one can use morr than one of the same type of bobble head and stack that benefit. If someone used 100+ the start doing insane amounts of damage 
---
3rd person ruins the immersion for me, I absolutely can’t stand it in the slightest so I’m sorry I can’t feel for you.
---
Honestly, I'd rather see new music. (Well, new to the series anyway.)
---
14 of the songs on Appalachia Radio are from previous games, out of 52 songs total. 1/4th of the playlist was recycled from Fallout 3 or 4. (As far as I can tell, "Orange Colored Sky" is the only one from New Vegas, I could be wrong.)
---
Combine that with the fact that the radio only seems to like playing a couple songs at a time, and that there's 4 songs that start out with the same couple of notes, it gets annoying after a while. (I love the Ink Spots, but like, damn.)
---
But I do like the idea of a radio station made up of songs from previous games. Galaxy News Network doesn't seem to have much of a presence here, who's to say there isn't a GNR station right out of the map's boundaries?
---
(And also where the fuck is Uranium Fever you bastards that was my jam)
---
These should show up in Every nuked area.
---
BTW, you can skip the first half of the video :P
---
Which platform? I’m American but because of my living situation I’m playing PS4’s Europe servers. Our players seem to be a 50/50 split of players under 25 and players above 85
---
I've done it both ways. First time solo second with a team mate.
---
Team works makes it MUCH easier. 
---
Ok this made me lol
---
Sadly not many people remember Ray Stevens anymore. 
---
Use the emote wheel, it’s actually quite helpful.
---
They're not hitting explosion, just two shot. They're making the second shot do 25% instead of full damage
---
Literally us lol. I have to keep coming up with excuses to get out of the house. So far going to the gym for an hour gets rid of the guilt. 
---
ty
---
Amazing idea, if i had any coins I’d give you an award. 
---
Well I mean... Food buffs do play a big part. I noticed that I am a beast with food buffs. Maybe check it? :) 
---
My explosive radium rifle isn't very good but it's getting nerfed anyhow. I've spent countless hours building my perk cards around this weapon.
---
So last night I pick up an instigating sledge with 40% power damage.......
---
Do I invest countless hours into re spec'ing my build around this weapon?......or will this eventually be nerfed also?
---
What is your source? I thought this initially but the community seems to have debunked it. If I'm wrong though, I'd love to know.
---
Happy u like it =)
---
240 hours
---
Had to put all the mats in the stash
---
The only time I spot them is right before they fall through the bedrock that I was sure was solid a second ago...
---
As much as people deride Fortnite on this sub, they have really successfully maintained interest and momentum with map changes/evolutions and if its feasible I do think that would help keep people interested...even new small publicized map locations give max level people something to go check out and a community event gives them something to do.
---
Even if it has to be tallied up outside of the game (see: [ESO's Summerfall event](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/summerfall)), some kind of engagement goal sparks great community involvement. In ESO, lots of high levels were publicizing and offering free taxiing around for the event (which was exploration based) to help people with low level characters help out toward the goal...good stuff. :)
---
I usually side with the icons in the favorites menu. Its using the rifle one. Two handed is a big axe with two hands on it... etc
---
Good idea!
---
PC ;(
---
I do! Lol. How much for one?
---
Oh nooooo not emotes :( I feel bad for you 
---
I hate that event, every time I go to the circle area and nothing is there. Walk around looking for trouble but the area is so small, nothing in the area. 
---
I was playing with it and noticed this straight away. I was like "wow holy crap its anhhialating things! Then the music got quiet and I was at 5 % health haha
---
Thanks for the tips fellow wastelander! I’m only level 40 but I’ll be end-gaming soon enough!
---
TS and Explosive alone are not OP.....so why Nerf those?
---
The only problem here is the 2 stacking together. 
---
You can wear a chassis with no parts on it, and it'll be more protection than any regular armor you're likely to have at this stage. But yeah, if you want to beef up, also search around here to raider armor locations, those start at 15.
---
I think the thing is explosive was meant to be good, really good, with the drawback of killing yourself. But then current iteration was kind of game breaking and people are pissed they might have to actually try harder now. I'm still super stoked about it.
---
I'm down! GT is Kaise7en
---
I'm doing the same. I refuse to pay for micro transactions when I bought a game for €60.
---
Yea there's also a lot to do with mods and CC content for FO4 but I skipped over some of that for time sake. I figure 76 being without mods maybe it will work. I'll keep this updated. 
---
I think there is a mod to make it launch fire balls instead.
---
This worked for me thx
---
All i have to go off of is the in game tool tips and the advice here, which so far seems to be high int and keeping the perk cards equipped necessary to craft. If it’s been debunked, I haven’t seen it.
---
TSE MIRV... do not fire that thing.
---
It sent me to Jupiter.
---
But I want to sit at Whitesprings farming mobs of ghouls that a solo player can kill with a knife for 8 hours a day so I can get 100 1* wood chest pieces.
---
That will be 500 atoms per ball. 
---
I was thinking something more akin to a ghetto Fat Man.
---
It's just a big ass slingshot made out of salvaged rubber, wood, and steel, and it slings Molotov Cocktails.
---
I think they kind of take the place of Raiders for this game, the human scorched anyway. But there's a few things I do find interesting about the scorched, like how they basically turn into trolls exposed to sunlight if they live too long (also reminds me of that fungus that infects a bug and makes it crawl up super high when it dies so it can spread its spores even further). They do share some tricks that the ghouls do in game, like laying down and pretending to be a corpse until you walk up (unless you're obsessively hitting vats targeting), but their version is a little different as they'll hold a statue pose in a group of the already statued scorched. But in that aspect, mechanically, they pretty much are just ghouls with guns - if you don't count how the scorched can be just about any creature you come across in the wastelands. I'd argue their less like lazy zombies, and more like the flood from Halo. The Scorchbeast Queen thing really drives that home I think, you show up to fight her and she's laying down her green stank and reviving every dead creature in a mile as a scorched version to come get you.
---
Yeah this is basically your basic auto response of customer support, who have no idea how the game works but have to deal with people asking to fix bugs.
---
Did you try turning off and on again?
---
Did you try clearing cache?
---
Did you try reinstalling?
---
Did you try doing all of the above at once?
---
Did you reset your router?
---
I mean, I don't blame them, it's their job unfortunately, but it boils my blood, none of those solutions ever worked for anything in my experience.
---
guys what do you suggest im at the same level and every time i try to continue on my side quests the mobs are too hard to handle. any tips on mobs to get better armor and weapons or suggestions on how to outfit me better? thank you 
---
TSE is op in PvE too. It sucks the fun and challenge out of the PvP/PvE.
---
To be honest, I don't own one, but even bloodied/explosive does it.
---
Is there an Xbox faction? I have recently pledged my allegiance to the almighty Moth and am looking for guidance in my life.
---
Your later comment says you’re on PS4. [Anyone who has been experiencing an influx in crashes since the last update I got ahold of Bethesda and got a response. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahxszd/anyone_who_has_been_experiencing_an_influx_in/](Try this.)
---
Apparently take this with a grain of salt, it may not work
---
I really like that idea. That would be a ton of fun and give me another much needed reason to return to the game.
---
Some people actually play solo and fight mobs of super mutants.
---
Maybe just put the Whitesprings resort on a separate server for all of the slot machine junkies who don't need good weapons to survive.
---
This honestly just killed my hopes for the future of this game 
---
Great idea. Really support this. It could include founding plaques for the players that helped create them too. So you are forever marked in the history of what is made!
---
After exploring all locations, getting all power armors, building about 20 bases and destroying them.. I started to become a collector. I collect all plans and recipes and go to workshops and collect junk and resources.
---
My original rp was supposed to be a traveling merchant. But it's kinda hard to... So I have my own shop and now I sell stuff and buy stuff... While doing events and killing the queen. 
---
Well to use a TSE weapon in PVE is the choice of the player, its up to the player to make things boring, but in PVP you could get jumped by someone with a TSE weapon, it becomes unfiar and unfun, without the input of the player.
---
Based on your post history, you seem like the arrogant one, not to mention a real piece of shit troll. No wonder you're downvoted to oblivion.
---
or let us blow up buildings like all the firepower we haul around would
---
Always worth a shot. Worst case I’m addicted to mentats lol
---
While I dont want this to become WoW for obvious reasons there are a lot of reasons it is such a great game. We need to not forget though that a lot of those things came in YEARS after release. Vanilla wow was an entirely different beast. I think some pvp areas would be amazing if done right. Loaf in buildings, load in underground cave, something that would keep the immersion on the main map.
---
Always vigilant bugs out? I had no idea. I almost always do those its easy af xp
---
That's fucking dope, that's such an overkill weapon.
---
So I must play your way to achieve something in this game?
---
Offer a male version of the Garb of Mysteries. My stealth character would grab it in a heartbeat.
---
It's a shame that they didn't add some of the cut content because I would have liked skill checks.
---
320 on PS4 
---
I have been doing Challenge farming for Atoms. It's been pretty fun. I do the daily,  weekly and then other ones you can find
---
Excellent!  👍👍👍👍
---
They should be nerfed for PVE, but 75-80% is a bit much.  Also, after this nerf I feel bad for anyone who was using guns that were still mediocre with TSE/TS. RIP Basically all energy weapons, pistols, and actual explosive weapons.
---
Don't worry, friend.
---
They won't listen to anyone. 
---
I cant find the warehouse building items :(
---
What do you mean worst case? that’s the best case. You take enough mentats you can hear colors and see sounds. 
---
There shouldn't be any legendary weapon or armor effects for PvP period.
---
Anything other than both players having the exact same weapon and armor will always result in one player having a crutch. This is why it was obvious before this game was released that PvP was going to be a disaster.
---
Start a pvp war between you and your friends?
---
How is the range shitty? Its 264 there. Is it bugged?
---
Wow, gets downvoted by duping nerds. Honestly, who wants to play a game where you 1 shot everything you come across. You're bored so you run around destroying other players stuff because you have nothing to do as your inventory is filled with every duped the weapon plus 100k bobble heads. Sad cunts
---
I found a holotape next to a skeleton in a wheelchair. 
---
It's an old man telling us he left there to die because he was a dick his whole life.  He was cool with it tho he was naked and high on pain killers.
---
200 diluted 50 normal 46 super lol 
---
And no, you can't report them from mobile. stupid fucking community, stupid fucking game. 
---
I like the rest stop (train station) toilet 😁
---
Yeah the quest marker is far smaller than it's supposed to be. It expands to the correct size once the event progresses to the next step; Kill The Protesters.
---
You say that like it's easy for them to add in all these conditional effects to a game that is already prone to bugs.
---
Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but I honestly am pretty pleased with how they addressed the TSE issue.
---
I usually have about 100-150 diluted on me and like two bottles of booze to revive with, I wear the pharmacy perk in strength tho to kill weight 
---
Sometimes you just lose track of time lol..
---
I would love to see number 4 for all weapons and armor.
---
An M4 or almost anything to replace the look of that ridiculous assault rifle.
---
Skins for the pipe weapons so they don't look so junky (I know they are supposed to look crappy but still).
---
That is a valid point 
---
uh what
---
I only have like 30 bc I don’t use them a lot
---
What parts of it killed your hopes?
---
They need to Nerf how many stimpaks you have. That's not fair to me if we PvP.
---
I kind of want to watch a video of this thing action.
---
There's not much to do, really. Drop the game and maybe come back when they decide to add something.
---
Are we sure it's a bug at this point? If it's been around this long maybe reinforced double doors are ment to be a thing. 
---
The same problem today. I almost got a heart attack.
---
You can put your point into another stat and then choose a perk card. After selecting another stat look at the bottom of the screen next to the word filter and hit that button to filterbbn perk selection by another stat
---
Really hope that's sarcasm haha
---
Hi Bethesda Support.  A few small requests:
---
1. I think it's great that you're working to improve PvP. However, you also have a loyal following who want nothing to do with PvP. Please create a pacifist-only option and have servers that are dedicated to non-PvP play. 
---
2. I appreciate that you fixed the weight of bobby pins. However, carry weight and CAMP storage could still use a boost. Along those lines, mods have been made to enable better weight management. Please consider some kind of UI enhancement for such purposes. 
---
3. Solo players especially have to switch perk cards quite a bit. We typically do our own weapon and armor crafting, lock-picking, computer-hacking, and so on. 
---
Please allow for quick switches between 4 or 5 pre-set card configurations. 
---
4. The fixes to some of the legondary weapons were good. However, we still exist in a setting of "rich" players who have advanced by taking advantage of glitches in the system and "poor" players who basically just follow the rules. 
---
Please do something about the doopers, and consider vendor spending limits that are tied to player accounts and not to vendors. (Perhaps allow players to earn up to 500 caps per day )
---
5. Finally, the scrapper perk is basically worthless. Maybe consider a second level, or allowing the perk to occasionally randomly obtain a screw, spring, or gear off of guns with the chance increasing based on the number of mods on the gun. 
---
This game should not be about making weekly or daily missions and server hops to specific locations, just to accumulate as many fans, typewriters, and clipboards as possible. 
---
6. I know that additional content is on the way. 
---
Please consider some satisfying option that allows players to capture a silo and stop a launch. Maybe not PvP.  Maybe something automated, initiated by the Enclave. 
---
Thanks for considering these requests. 
---
Not really sure if I'm installing it correctly
---
You don't have to select a card from the same attribute you're increasing. After you select an attribute you can change the card category.
---
Let's fix the game first 
---
Finding every location, but that's kind of an ongiong thing. Short of that, I'm at the point where I'm after perfect roll weapons and armor. Unfortunately I have shit luck with Legendaries, so for the point I'm at, "playing" Fallout 76 is just cruising Reddit and Facebook for the stuff I'm after.
---
In my opinion, one way to save the endgame would be to allow us to strip legendary modifiers and apply them to other gear. That way the shitty 1 star legendaries could actually be useful for us, and it would give way more meaning to grinding legendaries. Even if it was like 25 stable flux to strip and 25 to apply, at least each person's "god roll" would be attainable.
---
Short of that, we need more content. Level 106, not much left to do.
---
you have to rearrange and prioritize. can’t have more than 15 strength so ur gonna have to get rid of a perk card set you rlly don’t need. 
---
I have the traveling pharmacy perk maxed out and I currently have about 1,200 stimpacks total 
---
Not necessarily.. I will agree that 2 shot really isn't that over powered by itself. In my humble opinion; it's more the explosive legendary effect that's just out of control, even more so when combined with 2 shot as you say. 
---
Reason: In addition to the +100% damage explosive provides plus aoe, I can also now equip another perk card to add yet another 100% damage to a weapon that wasnt necessarily supposed to be explosive aaaand now it's also 2 shot for another 100%... lol. Take the shotty for example: shotgunner perks, plus 2 shot, plus explosive, plus explosive perk = totally OP. 
---
What I believe Bethesda should do (just my 2 cents): dont allow 2 shot and explosive on same weapons. Additionally dont let the explosive perk card work with explosive legendary effects, leave that for mark19, missile launcher and fat man (they actually need it to be useful). Dont drop the damage %s... see how that works and if necessary adjust it slowly over time. Also fix the bobbleheads stacking immediately. 
---
384 Stims
---
133 Diluted Stims
---
241 Purified Water
---
I keep a steady flow, traveling pharmacy and thru-hiker keep me lightweight.
---
Guess what? Magazines ***DO NOT*** stack. Explosive bobbleheads are the only ones that stack. Get your information right please before you get in the pulpit.
---
It is.
---
But it is also the unfortunate reality of where this game is quickly heading.
---
If you're playing casually just go for it. My wife and I pre-ordered the game and while I mostly played alone at launch, my wife's started playing again since it's less of a pain to actually play now.
---
i was going to say how are you not fat walking, but i forgot traveling pharmacist is a thing. 
---
i couldnt carry more than 8 supers along with my 100 diluted and 50 regular without it. 
---
Science
---
I have pretty much all weight perks on unless I'm fighting then i swap back to ft away again 😂
---
I agree with you. The reason I even made this post is to express frustration with the poor problem solving on the dev team. They want to decrease all damage by an unreasonable factor to solve the main problem, but it harms other elements of the game (such as PVE), some level of damage reduction for PVE would work, but 75-80% is far too much. Personally, if they  reduced the explosive factor by some amount it would be fine. reducing Two-Shot doesnt make much sense, if two projectiles are leaving the barrel, it makes sense that it would do twice the damage.
---
What Vendor “faction” is it linked to? Same as the train station?
---
If you jump and touch the base block, you can climb/float up to the door sometimes.  Wonder if you can drop down from the top and do similar.
---
The Ultracite Gatling Laser equipped with a Prime receiver is pretty damned effective vs queen.  You do need to max out perks like Power User to make the Ultracite Fusion Cores last longer and not seem like you wasted those fluxes for nothing. 
---
Is it overall less expensive TCO than an auto ballistic weapon with cheap crafted ammo?   Prob not but nice to break up the monotony with green lasers. 
---
haha yeah i try not to have any weight perks aside from pharmacist and thru hiker, but managing my weight is good i keep it under 200 with a 260 limit. 
---
idk how though lmaoo
---
I've got about 5 right now lol
---
If you want to meet griefers just server hop at Whitesprings golf club, from experience 7-8/10 of the jackoffs who place a rocket camp there are also 'very fine people'.
---
Lol dude my limit is 600 and I'm usually at 590 😂
---
Constantly cucumbered in battle 😂
---
LOL hmmm that would explain a few things. 
---
Actually tried it again and the flame is like 10 meters but it literally shoots explosive bullets that have the 264 range. 
---
Well, if you are on pc, just pm me.
---
Mom know the best.
---
like all 3 of them, Train is the best IMO.  
---
Thanks for sharing
---
I want a deer head mask so I can wear it with my spacesuit and look like this [Deer God](https://spacemetal1.bandcamp.com/merch/deergod-t-shirt) 
---
Very helpful 
---
I wonder if the fire/healing perk heals yourself? 
---
I want to be the mothman.
---
I wanna perch over vault 76 and watch dwellers roll out.
---
Would be nice to have eight like the queen fight suggests lol....
---
Sucks when four clannies are on and your stuck outside of the group lol.

---
That’s a bit much...
---
Im not saying that it is the easier method, im saying its the better method, because an overall reduction in the damage makes the weapon far less effective for the people who got lucky and found one, or purchased one from another player for an excessive amount of caps.
---
lol! I will do that then. Thanks for the link. ^^
---
Thank you your my hero

Uuugh i hope the President pa thing is not tied to pvp at all..

I fkn hate pvp in 76 is not fun and balanced at all.

I LIKE YOUR SUGGESTION A LOT

Hey!That's my vamp location!
---
Good luck crafting ammo for those :(
---
&gt;I'm simply stating why people end up buying stuff from them. They spend hundreds of hours grinding and come up empty, and see others strike gold within ten hours or less and say why not?
---
Maybe they "grind" the wrong things. Loading screens don't have value.
---
I feel for you gamebro!
---
Haha fair, but quality of life improvements are also important. Just like having a game that doesn't crash, this saves time for the player and is a pretty easy problem to fix
---
I carry less than 50 at a time, all diluted. 
---
even if it would the explosions would kill me. flame is energy damage, explosions are not
---
The scout course not sure how that will work couldn't  a players ping be abused here?, what about mutations?.
---
Except this,wasmtbanywhere near there. It was outside during Powering up Poseidon.
---
That’s just a broken system.  I was PVP with someone that on the map said level 65 but when I killed him it showed level 0
---
And let me tell you what. He had no extra damage.  Poor guy couldn’t even crawl back to camp hehehe (this was a legit pvp battle, not slap damage like in your post)
---
Also if you have armor piercing perks on, power armor ain’t shit. 
---
Post a vid of this in action please
---
I have a similar build I use to farm Whitesprings. (un-nuked) Ghouls die while in their idle state and for the most part dont know I'm there. An uninterupted loop with the xp bonuses can net me about 2 levels in an hour. 
---
You know I forgot about that tbh, and perhaps
---
Same, dont really enjoy PVP
---
Anyone know how to get "Woopsies" and "Needle Spine"?
---
He isnt weak for liking a powerful weapon, thats a pretty dumb lone of thinking. The entire point of this game is just to get better and better gear, not like there is a real story or immersion to get into. If this game just becomes a META hunt like Destiny where every time you get the META it gets nerfed to oblivion and you have to start the hunt all over again people are gonna leave fast.
---
hey we all got places to be!
---
U jelly?
---
Likely sitting under the map. This is an exploit I've seen mentioned before
---
Explosive shotguns could use a slight nerf. Mostly with range as I can practically use mine as a sniper. I've been killed by rad roaches more than anything in this game ever since I got my exterminators explosive shotgun. I think the risk of killing yourself with it balances it out.
---
My explosive radium rifle is not OP at all and it's a load of crap that it is being nerfed. My TS handmade is not OP at all and it's a load of crap that it is being nerfed.
---
The 2 effects should not be able to be rolled on the same weapon. Take all of the existing weapons with TSE and let the owner choose to keep one perk and give them a re-roll on the other. Problem solved.
---
The nerf train will never stop....... mutations, armor perks, bobbleheads, melee. This is a non stop train once it gets going.
---
I believe in equal opportunity, not equal outcome. Everyone has the same chance of getting what ever legendary drop, getting angry that soneone else got a better one and beat you is just silly.
---
This is what happens when people complain because others are better than them at a game.   Not saying duper’s are better or worst. But when you die in pvp and then complain that tse is too strong then this is what happens. 
---
Everyone knew you can’t just delete duper accounts, change duped weapons to ivory grips, or whatever other solution there was posed to taking away duped guns
---
Now for those of us (op and myself included) that get our tse legit, we are now punished by a nerf. Good going everyone. Good going bethesda
---
Thanks for the response. Will be changing it up accordingly
---
Honestly i try to keep no more than 20 of any healing or aid item, only use regular stims never super or diluted, and about 10 of each nuka with cola nut perk
---
You can report a player on mobile, just submit a ticket, one of the options is report a player.
---
How do the Atom Shop Paints work?

Go to weapons workbench and you can paint any hunting  rifle camo any number of times? - or can you only paint one rifle once?

---
Yeah I just feel like none of this content will be immersive or fun. Seems like it's just redone quest with different names 
---
I disagree. I think people should have a crutch over the other player.   It makes it more interesting because you never know what you are going to get if you fight.  It has to be as realistic as possible.  Nothing is fair in real life.
---
I would like the idea of them mixing it. It would add new varity but also have some old varity. 
---
I wouldn't base much off of the in game tool tips. My marine armor is a great example of why. 
---
Soooo, no ACTUAL content, just a few new events and like one or two quests? I'm more upset at how huge the list kf cut content there is and small the list of things they're adding is. The game already has hardly anything in it so its not like they need the space to add it.
---
It makes me download a Bethesda launcher everytime 😒☹
---
Yeah man, I get that, but having to do that every time you step in a building is a pain in the ass. Seems like they could easily address that. 
---
I agree.
---
My point is for those crying about nerfs. This type of game could never be balanced and Bethesda probably ruined the idea of online Fallout with PvP.
---
Thanks for the response. I have a functioning food and water supply from my camp, so i guess dromedary and rejuvenated aren’t as useful. How much does low endurance affect a character?
---
Legendaries give everyone your own loot table. Nuke zone mobs have shared inventory and queen looks like shared sometimes but she ISN'T, her drops just load weirdly
---
Wow this is extremely well thought out and extensively detailed, bravo! I'd love to see this as large scale end game team mission.
---
Loot is unique to you. Anyone who tags an enemy gets their own loot inventory from an enemy
---
He must have gotten lost.
---
I'm very impressed, to say they are only a few levels in front of me and I've maybe seen 10 bobble heads.
---
I bet you have a collection to right?
---
It’s a group on Xbox, I don’t use Discord
---
I’ve probably gotten about 3k atoms from challenges since I’ve been playing 
---
TYVM
---
And, this morning, 10 minutes in, someone nukes Toxic Lakebed, and when I show up..... crash.
---
They probably have maxed ou luck, bet you never thought of that hmmm.
---
Sorry no
---
I wish
---
Hmmm. Maybe. I think they could fix the problem a bit by making it so that if you are in Pacifist mode neither you or your C.A.M.P can be damaged at all unless you are within a workshop in which case someone can still attempt to claim it.
---
Is that (15 Agility and Sneak 3*) a tipping point for this to work? I’m at Agility 13 but have seen +1 Agility Armor. Would two of those pieces save me from a two-step re-spec?
---
My luck is on 2, probably why I've only found 10 and not over a 100k. Ah, silly me
---
I can never find Grahm =(
---
No worries. Same goes for (spawned, not player placed) inventory loot.
---
I dunno, I refuse to use intentionally suboptimal stuff in games like this. Just artificially making the game harder feels awful
---
I had one of these and sold it, the fire never showed, it was more like a fully automatic grenade launcher
---
Yeah it notifies you it will be destroyed
---
takes about a minute or two for full render when I load into my camp area.
---
Wow so many turrets, I wonder if my camp is bugged, I have about 3-4 turrets and two lights.
---
I do have a post on this subreddit about a heavy weapons build with a demonstration video that shows how easily it takes out enemies just as well as any other build. You would know that if you looked. The video was even made before the automatic weapons buff which made them even stronger. I’m currently working on a build that’s even stronger than the one I posted now that we know more about the different values on perks, mods, and items. You happy? No where’s your proof, oh wait, it doesn’t exist.
---
Trade you your explosive vent mods for my barbed walking cane mod! 😂
---
I don't think you know how websites work
---
lol no that secret Government crap is for the movies the BOS is what I would jump into IRL.
---
*sigh* seems the ban hammer has more work to do.
---
The amount of legendary wood armor I've picked up is hilarious.. I'm still thinking of making a wood armor sneak build... lol
---
But Fallout is a game where the lore of the game is to grind until you score a 'god roll'.
---
I don't and never will PvP in this game for that reason alone. PvP will never be skill based.....it will always come down to perk cards, bobbleheads, armor, and weapons.
---
Why cant all of the above be a problem?
---
I mean if the meta is everything else is trash, then clearly something needs to be nerfed and something needs to be buffed.
---
Everything I have seen about TSE weapons is that they are too powerful.
---
If he's shooting a wall, it's because there are robots on the other side that he's shooting at.  Go kill all of them and you can trade with him.  I've also "seen" him be invisible but I could still trade with him if I looked around until the trade graphic showed up...
---
it *shouldn't* be showing their names.
---
So I follow it through, tap report player then ps4 then sign in on the website and then it takes me to a loading screen that makes me download a launcher for Windows 
---
Bug and well known since get go. One i am sure is on their list.
---
When dupers go rampant pt2 
---
Name a game that is fair pvp from level 1 and all the way through the game. 
---
Maybe overwatch? I haven’t played that one.  But I haven’t played a shooter or any other game that’s fair from level one. Higher levels always have better equipment/weapons at their disposal.  
---
The no way emote works well for me when some shady duper wants to buy my Two Shot Dragon so he can “dupe” it or when someone exaggerates a price for a nuke card (these happened to me)
---
If you're on PS4 and have the mats I'll craft a bunch for you
---
And your point is? The major of the player base buy shit from dupers. The game hub is loaded with dupers selling stuff. 
---
Well i hope your sense of righteousness has been fulfilled for the day.  Its a game guy, hell if it wasnt for dupers i bet most ppl on fo76 would never take down SBQ. Either way im still having fun
---
And Bethesda will do the same to melee. Nerf it into the ground. They do balance worse than Bungie
---
If it hasn't recalled and you play on PC I'd be down to give you all the components- I have 200 black titanium so I'd be down to get rid of it + I'm an unyielding build so I have 23 int
---
I usually volunteer to be the odd man out. My 4 charisma is really only meant for lone wander anyway.
---
Show is your collection, I bet it's almost as big as this guys 😯
---
Ya I know man.. I have like 6 or 7 two shot weapons and none are any where near being overpowered.. honestly the two shot makes them decent and that's about it.. especially my two shot missile launcher. It does a decent amount of damage but dang it weighs so much, missiles weigh a ton and trying to craft missiles takes a large amount of precious junk.. not to mention all the damage + big guns perks do not apply to it. I'm kinda sad Bethesda is nerfing the 2 shot.. 
---
What di you mean?
---
Positive you didn’t drop it rather than exit?  
---
I found a school bus near Thunder Mountain with a skeleton on a mattress, spread eagle.  The school bus was filled with male and female mannequins in compromising positions. This man / woman clearly fucked those mannequins to death.

You've clearly never had to run, jump, shoot, throw grenades, and drink beer at the same time. Hat + beer + straw = never losing your edge on the battlefield... or buzz, whichever.

4. Scorchbeasts spam the sonic blast like ridiculously alot and they render me unable to move faster than walking pace, literally slower than when you have no AP and over encumbered. With that i cant stimpak or run away. 
---
Also they seem to every now and then one shot me in my lvl 50 ultracite armour, literally goes from 70% to zero in one shot, and for a short amount of time they are undamagable when all this happens.

Ok, I tried it again just now and it worked....🤔
---
I have \~600 black titanium myself I've been trying to sell off. I can recraft it, I'm a little miffed about needing to find another set of calibrated shocks, motion-assist servos and targeting HUD though. I'd like to know what went wrong and made me lose it in the first place. Wouldn't want it to happen with my X-01 and all that.
---
Or let us play pool? :D
---
What if instead we some how have a community event, where in your example we gather materials for a bridge. Once the community reached a goal the bridge gets built and is a permanent addition across the entire game, as in all servers now have that because we has a community came together to rebuild
---
The problem for me is......
---
As a solo player fighting 40 super mutant warlords with a pipe pistol f'ing sucks. I went in West Tek last night and just when I thought I cleared the room I open a door via terminal and there is a dozen more shooting me before I even log off the terminal. No way in hell I would have enjoyed clearing that room without my explosive radium rifle.
---
There is a huge disconnect between players who are exploring the entire map and those who just want to farm Whitesprings and PvP.
---
In the past two days Ive spent a significant amount of time crafting/modifying weapons, gifting low level legendaries, or crafting/repairing PA for &lt; level 40s. Also, I walk them through some quick tips and explain in-game how mutations, nuke zones, legendary drops etc work.
---
While helping these players, I’ve received a number or either invites or messages asking to assist someone else,which I cant respond immediately as Im already busy helping someone else. Im sure the person on the other end believes Im ignoring them, dont have time etc, which is quite the opposite. Be patient, because I have met a number of really cool people that I now play with on the reg.
---
Where is that? She is also supposed to spawn at rye 65 highway sign on the map but I haven't seen her there yet just the skeleton costume guy.
---
Yeah, I was wearing it and held E to get out of it. I then pulled out my X-01 and got inside.
---
I have 2. One tse one anti mirelurk and bugs lol
---
I mean I'm not complaining. There could've been a funny backstory there
---
Very nice of ya. :)
---
The fact that everyone is surprised by this nerf surprises me. This is specifically why I did not invest caps or perks into a TSE build. It was broken from day one, and the dupers just took that brokenness and made it something more accessible and widespread than Starbucks.
---
On the plus side, I'll bet that after the nerf your build will probably still top the damage charts, it's not like they removed the effects completely. They just balanced them with other effects.
---
And you can still easily kill melee with ranged weapons. The lack of TSEs never stopped me from competing.
---
I use a similar build with rifles. Very effective, and not dependent on legendaries to murder things. 
---
Bored melee player here.
---
I found a few spots where scorchbeasts land. Started killing them for fun. With a no gun ever build they have been a pain. Ive had to run from so many, so mow i can stand and thry land infront of me for a 1 shot death. 
---
Other times i shamelessly look for humans. Get on voice chat. B line it to other players. Offer them help. Be an npc. Offer them quests, ask for an escort to a location. Wear a costume. Roleplay.  If they are building at camp, throw a team invite and build something nice like an elegant clock or bear rug. Then smash their camp if they dont want your love.  Take the invite. Talk to me. Play with me. Or you die. 
---
Best npc ever. 
---
This is what ive been doing lately. The game is a bit boring solo. When my buddies are on theres more to do. But i find myself getting weirder everyday to the general playerbase. 
---
Love me or ill crush you
---
unless this sub dropped it recently, "witch hunting" is against the rules.
---
O didn't mean to imply that just thought i would point it out for ya.
---
Tried this. Full hazmat suit 1k resistance. Bucket of rad X I had 2500 rad resistance. Still spent more time using rad away and stims than I did shooting. What am I doing wrong? 
---
Not sure i understand but how do you drop a PA set instead of exiting it? 
---
I know you can drop / place from inventory but not sure if I'm missing something now after reading your question lol
---
Be on in 10 if you will have him still.

3. Issue I was having was with the Mirlurk Queen that spawns at  the pond north of Watoga.  It was invisible and  invulnerable!!! I went there to fight the Queen but could not find it and was attacked by the Queens bleeding acid attacks out of nowhere.  I tried to fire my two shot explosive shotgun at the direction the acid was coming from but nothing happened(usually I can kill it with a shot or two).  The acid just keep coming and so I had no choice but to run and it chased me for a bit before the acids stop appearing out of thin air.  
---
I nuked Whitespring first and I was lvl 68 nuked em solo
---
That’s nuts and really cool, thanks for sharing.  Playing around with artillery is a good time.  Buddy of mine and I have set up multiple and bombarded super mutant camp areas
---
Haha it's not a problem. I was looking for an explanation after all. You're good.
---
I just checked mine today and I'm at 187.
---
Neat idea with the garage doors 
---
You will miss out on that sexy matched look
---
Id bring multiple weapons just in case. Your enemy will be mostly robots so anything that may hurt them more. If you enter the code wrong you lose your keycard so have an extra card or be 1000% sure of the code as you enter it. I think the 8 people is for the sbq not the silo itself. Though the more you have the better it may go.
---
I think so it could also be the bunker tho
---
This is the build I run as well. Really like it.
---
Some other essentials with this are Concentrated fire, Marathoner, Rejuvenated, Grim Reaper's Sprint, and some special points in Endurance. I'm a solo player so I consider Lone Wanderer also essential.
---
 Chameleon armor works really well with this, with all ultralight mods (AP bonus). I keep power armor on hand but only for when I get over encumbered to get home.
---
Pretty much everything I use centers around not running out of AP and refilling it fast when it drains.
---
I stay away from certain guns with high AP cost and stick to stuff like the automatic powerful combat rifle and combat shotgun and double barrel. I want range maxed out to max out VATS lock on distance, so no silencers or any other barrel attachments that hurt range. With Escape Artist I don't need a silencer anyway (they lose me in seconds if I crouch). With a long weapon range and Concentrated Fire I can use critical hits to snipe enemies even if they have a 5% hit chance. If the initial hit doesn't kill them their hit chance ramps up and I'm hitting with with a 95% chance even if they're wayyy far out there.
---
I also have Martial Artist so I can make good use outside of VATS of the Gatling Gun. 
---
Also weight loss perks help with this, to help keep from getting over encumbered.
---
Is it just me or is anyone curious as to how everyone in the vault had time to go explore and get killed while you slept in? Like it seems as though months of time occurred between those few hours.  Maybe I just don’t know much about the game idk
---
If someone chooses to use TSE in event with other players, and one shots everything, so that no one else gets the loot, it affects on other players. 
---
This is multiplayer game so it has to have some balance. It can't let players to be totally OP, because it affects everybody. 
---
And don't be afraid, the PvE will still remain quite easy. There is no need for TSE weapons, because the content is so hard.
---
And right outside of the pit of skulls made from concrete slabs. 
---
You think in a real fallout scenario there won't be a little lawlesness and murder? 
---
PVP is reality bruh
---
Yeah for your first. Probably whitespring. For many reasons. And no. Bring many weapons. If you've got the hacker perks as well they'll help. Plus lots of anti rads and stims. 
---
2 people "moving" erratically now constitutes Alt accounts for duping and selling?
---
You've just seen 2 people in one of the laggesiest areas of the game moving a little weird and your go to is "alt accounts for duping" (farming is allowed you get that its just a way to say grinding the same mobs over and over for resources / loot right).
---
You've broken more rules by posting this picture and assuming than they have lagging around Whitesprings!
---
/idiot
---
Yea I was talking about dropping it from inventory but yea guess that doesn’t make sense with him having just gotten out of it.
---
I’ve read of people losing PA after getting out inside buildings in the overworks but not super common.  It certainly shouldn’t happen.  I’ve started always immediately grabbing mine after reading some people mention it.
---
For tables 2 of 2, Wooden desks, the bigger dark wood one is also a stash box. I have it by my bed and can send a photo to verify this if you’d like
---
I use REVO uninstaller... seems to get EVERYTHING
---
Still got him. He's not going anywhere!
---
Stims and ammo. You also need 15 circuitry to complete a task inside the silo. Make you have those.
---
This is the first time I've lost an item like this, have about 200 hours logged. I play almost exclusively in PA, and often swap between X-01 and Excavator for mining/carry weight. Guess I need to be more careful in the future and always reclaim them as soon as I get out.
---
Latency issues and the servers being crappy probably.
---
Not so much an issue once you have the timing down. I can consistently "first run" it even in power armor now
---
Number 7 would change the atomic shop as a pay to win shop for many people and would be another PR issue. They should just increase the camp budget instead of stash limit in the future for everybody. 
---
On European servers language barriers exist.
---
I frequently meet Italians or Germans, who only speak their native language (and god, those children on the background... you mic has mute, you know!). 
---
I have formed semi-persistent party with 3 other guys during Whitespring farms: from USA, Qatar and Vietnam. God knows how it happened that we share same playtime schedule...
---
Have yet to meet another guy from Russia out there.
---
So for US players it is relatively easier to get good encounters with others due to simple size of the playersbase and lack of language issues.
---
But X-01 with an ultracite arm looks dope
---
I only carry a sledgehammer and tse shotty on me
---
Junkies was amazing in 4. I haven’t tested in 76 but I’d imagine it’s the same.
---
You only need the code once a week as well
---
Nice builds. I like when people have thematic camps and try to blend it with the environment so that it looks like it should be there.
---
However, platform should be level as should track. If a train stopped there, it's going to be a bit of a drop fro the back carriage. Please Mind the Gap.
---
I like your idea on the pvp as that would work nicely I think, I'd originally been thinking that it would have been nice if there had been an irradiated part of the map that was a pvp area, maybe had some decent end game events and rare craft items and loot, but with the risk/reward being that anything thing you obtain while in said area can be lost if you are killed with a smaller chance of losing gear you took in, I think if it had maybe 6 entrances to the area so you couldn't accidently walk in but enough that you can avoid running straight in with another party and lastly maybe a 5 minute grace period so as to deter camping the entrances for people walking in. I think it would work nicely as it means you can go in as a raider group to try and reap the rewards that other players worked hard to get and also make people wanting to do the quests think strategically about what they will take with them. Of course fast travel is disabled while in the area
---
I don't PvP. I just think Fallout is a horrible game to play if you want balance.
---
You can nerf every weapon in the game but there is always going to be someone decked out in assassin's armor with an assassin's weapon who just got done reading an issue of US Government #3 and has an explosive bobblehead that just popped a shot of Psycho and some overdrive.
---
I'm just pissed that they are going to nerf weapons that make the game more fun for the 98% who don't PvP.
---
Nah, it's cheaper and some simply can't afford actual priced games because of circumstances potentially out of their control.
---
You should probably consider all sides before you look like an asshole.
---
What I want to know is if 15 agility really matters. I want to see how the game calculates it to know if there are any diminishing returns.  I'm at 9 agility, and I can hide from most enemies constantly just fine.  So it would be interesting to know if somebody  could figure out the most efficient number for agility that allows evasion for almost everything, and isn't overkill either.
---
I'm assuming escape artist seems like it invalidates muffled based on description.  Shadowed probably affects it more.
---
Yep, before you know it the visual glitches surrounding power armor will make you a duper.
---
The only thing I have to say is I have a few hundred hrs in FO76.  I have stuck up for this game and enjoyed exploring, looting, collecting resources, and crafting goodies.
---
I'm not sure where this game is heading.  My first concern was them nerfing the workshops making their relevance little more than a novelty.  I had some fantastic player interactions mostly very positive and left me often feeling like our community was growing.  Gone.
---
Nerfing XP for killing harder to kill beasties.  Drops for them now too often are insanely disappointing.  The grind leaves me feeling like yeah if I kill that scorch beast 100 times I might keep one actually useful legendary.  Why bother..
---
Now we are nerfing end game mods that allowed you to farm end game beasties quickly and efficiently.  So killing 100 scorch beast isnt a massively annoying process. A process that can become such a high resource sink it take you 20mins to an hr of resource collection to kill a couple unless you have already killed a couple hundred and found that not yet nerfed legendary weapon.
---
PVE is heading towards the point where you need to have a lot of free time to invest to get anywhere.  I know some of our community love a mega grind. (It gets rid of the less serious player that just gets in the way.)  The player that has a  job,  family, and other life obligations,  you know the vast majority of the population.  
---
So its comming across to me that a lot of these changes are based on pushing a environment where pvp is a far more prevelant activity.  They are trying to fix a massively broken system The pvp system that myself and all but  3 of my 50 plus friends who play this game find little more than a tool to brighten 12yo griefers types days.  At least till they head back to the corner they hide in on their favorite cod map. Yeah those 3 friends are 14yos that play a couple times a week just to grief.
---
The problem with the pvp system is as follows,  you dont enter pvp till you respond to a pvp attack.  Well when you bust your butt get all yournperk cards lined out.  Farm-trade the gear that really compliments your build you can be quite powerful.  In other words I have responded to a pvp attact by a griefers with a one shot kill.  Boom PVP over no griefers joy.
---
So next thing they will nerf will be Instigating and bloodied, possibly executioner.  
---
For me they seem to be trying really hard to turn this game into something that just doesnt make me want to play.  I hate that!  I love the game.
---
Thing is the 2SE problem can be fixed as other have said.   DLC that makes they irrelevant In the game and their trade value will be reduced.  The thing is that fixes the pve problem.  The thing is they dont care about that they care about PVP.    This games engine will never let it be a BF or COD type experience.  Why are they kidding their selves and making it that way.  Co op is fantastic!  Let's set up some PVP arenas that revolve around  arena issues weapons! Perk builds decide things not dupes, lucky drops but skills.
---
NICE, A full teady bear display that is 1 static item but requires 1 of every teddy bear in game to craft.
---
People get the Display they want and yet would not affect the server at all.
---
A+
---
They all look great!
---
I do the same thing but I am not nearly as skilled at posting photos and writing about what I built.
---
I'm also one of those guys that have built a rustic cabin, lol.
---
Maybe you just don't have all the plans yet, but there are some cool decorative items that really make a CAMP feel more lived in. There's also mixing and matching wall styles and creativity with lights that can make a CAMP stand out (I spent so much time building settlements in Fo4 I might as well have been playing The Sims, lol).
---
And maybe this isn't your thing, but I try to make a CAMP look as natural to the world as possible because I like the idea that anyone who stumbles upon my place might mistake it for a regular location. That's why I don't lock anything! And once people do realize it's my CAMP I want things to set it apart from other CAMPs. I like that you replicate in-game locations, but I bet the CAMP building will quickly get outpaced by your creativity or trying to make it look too much like in-game locations. So I encourage you to take that spirit and make something you feel fits well with your style but eventually doesn't limit you.
---
An example might be to "improve" upon the original look of an in-game train station by adding light boxes to your station that flash red back and forth. Add a raider theme to it. Make it look like other survivors had successfully renovated it and turned it into something else like a diner. Make it look like it is being run by flamingos. Etc. 
---
My suggestions for future builds make better examples of what I'm trying to say because I don't want you to take what I've said as criticism. I'm just getting on board (pun intended) with the thought of what you'll come up with!
---
Anyway, keep up the good work!
---
Future build ideas:
---
Brotherhood of Steel military fort and encampment using tents also with prisoner lock up. And/or it could be used for patrolling griefers. Actively seek out those with a wanted level then if you kill them, take their junk and put it inside a locked cell. If they want it back, they'll have to go inside the cell aka serve their time by closing the door behind them, lol. But be humane. Give them a bunk, food, and water. I know this scenario is never likely to play out, but if it were me I'd play along for a bit.
---
A farm complete with barn, brahmin, crops, etc that is placed close to ghoul spawns for a classic zombie feel.
---
A bar/pool hall with cheap booze and great tunes.
---
A maze or corn maze? Would probably have to use defense walls or something to actually make the maze.
---
A radiation motel. For those people that are looking for a place to lay down their weary irradiated heads. Challenging.
---
A fancy upscale restaraunt looking to get a great wasteland review and hope their patrons don't find out they've been serving them "mysterious meat."
---
It was tied to XP in 4 but not in 76.  No real need for it.  Some people may care in crafting I suppose.
---
How is anyone already 350??? 
---
I get 200s but 350?? 
---
What can you possibly do in the game for so long??
---
It’s been like this in every fallout since 3. It ain’t changing now 
---
Oh, I agree that there should be no nerfs if thats what youre saying. You dont wanna get killed by a TSE?... Dont PvP with a person using one. They are pretty east to spot.
---
Problem is that the servers COULDN'T stand up to it, lmao
---
The ban hammer is a myth I'm afraid!
---
Bethesda banned a couple of you tubers nothing more. When the ban hammer goes out as it should this sub will be lit up like a giant nuka cola xmas tree with copies of emails and people asking for tips for the essay's that Bethesda apparently ask cheaters to write...not sure what thats all about lol
---
Yeah, as much as I like the concept of the idea, I believe you are right in that it would never really work. I love the idea of events that everyone has to work together on, but maybe restrict it to the idea that whatever event happens will auto complete regardless, and whatever personal benefits arise comes about by your personal contribution to it. That way the perks travel with you no matter what server you are on, and all servers reflect the same progress whether everyone or no one works on it. 
---
go tame a mongrel.  
---
it’ll replace the sloth’s budget with its own.  
---
Pretty sure it's in the place where you start the brotherhood quest
---
If all an NPC does is convey a plot point or game mechanic then they’re a very badly written NPC. The best ones convey plot points by telling you how their lives have been affected by x or y, or how they’ve taken advantage of the situation, and if they’ve been crafted correctly then you’ll feel some degree of empathy, or dislike, and want to help or hinder them. 
---
Look at games like Witcher 3 with its ‘Bloody Baron’ quest: a story that initially seems straightforward, but as the plot gets more complex so do the motivations of characters that you initially dismissed as stereotypes. 
---
You’re correct in that having NPCs doesn’t automatically mean a better product, but having well considered NPCs that aren’t just quest vending machines can elevate a game significantly. 
---
OP has your point however, the following is what i have DOUBT on Bethesda part
---
\#1
---
Queen's Damage Reduction **was raised to 75% from 50%**, because players were killing too fast with Explosive legendary 
---
Wouldn't be logical to turn it back down to 50%, because not everyone has a buddy that runs unyielding melee that can eat Queen as dessert
---
\#2 (this one need to wait till patch lands)
---
Two-Shot legendary's "Additional Bullet" actually fly at random place on your screen, if they plan to reduce it to 25%, make sure fire at same direction we are aiming? And try to fix Vats on two-shot, if the Devs actually can? 
---
The new "Flavor of the patch" will end up as Anti-Armor as the new top jack-of-all-trade &amp; efficient legendary effect.
---
Bloodied weapon will stay its niche on High Risk for High Damage
---
\#3
---
**Nerfing** to justify PvP-server-with-no-restriction is just lazy, buffing up **other choices** \+ separate balance change **apply to PvP only**
---
If you play MMO long enough (doesn't have to be MMORPG), you will able to notice any game that is not able separate **Balance Patch** changes apply to PvP vs PvE, they simply just doesn't work
---
Most Devs balance game by looking at numbers, they simply do not play/test the game at end-game/competitive level (yes this is a **Loot** game)
---
If anyone here played **The Divisions PvE part**, let's not bother with Dark Zone and PvP, it's not worthy mentioned the hack+issue it had (PvE was shit-show at launch + first 4-5 major patch, before Devs can understand the effect of their change + game design). 
---
P.S. one of the later patch, end game gear was accessible in **multiple** methods, and with abundant loot, players are still playing the game to **try different build**, or aim to get that perfect effect rolled gear
---
Did you mean &gt;300?
---
I’m under 100 hours and have finished every quest reasonable until I decide to grind some levels so I can survive encounters with level 50 things.
---
I wish there was more content for the level 30 player...
---
Problem is that only BGS knows how the game calculates weight and shit and how it affects the server. Personally, I just stick to the information they themselves have given or confirmed and try not to speculate too wildly about the root causes of stuff. Drawing sensible connections as theoretical possibilities, sure, but assuming stuff based on hearsay is dangerous waters.
---
I’ve done it 3-4 times and I’ve never completed it. I’ll just sit there with the bot shouting at me to repair it when it’s at full health, I’m not saying my experience is universal. Maybe I’ll give it another go.
---
How CAMP budget can be pay to win? If i insert more posters and statues in my house - i will not became more powerfull than other player. This is only cosmetic thing.
---
Yeah i can install more turrets, but BGS can sell budget slots for cosmetic furniture only.
---
Boys will be boys
---
That's really cool buddy thanks for the PSA.
---
30 normal stims + 10 super + 4 diluted.
---
I manage with the diluted and food.
---
In case I get in a big fight and use any of the regular ones I tend to go farm for stims to keep the 30ish number.
---
Probably goes without saying but have you logged out and in again? 
---
Thats wierd because Fallout 76 dont have any bugs...
---
Just get rid of pve all together by removing SLAP and pacifist. 
---
hey did this work?
---
every time ive fought the queen with other people its took 15 min and her health barley goes anywhere. I wish I had your problem lol. If anything they need to fix the way she scales. They could even make other enemies scale or buff/nerf those who need it. 
---
There’s oil.
---
farm for a decent TSE.
---
Right now shop assortment is something around deer head.
---
Thanks. I though 7 was quite low.
---
Pve is more fun 
---
“secret Chinese base”
---
TIL. 
---
Level 81, same thing. I find myself just doing random repeated stuff out of boredom. 
---
heavy leather at lvl 50:
---
chest: 28b/76e
---
arms: 22b/47e
---
legs: 22b/47e
---
stats for basic heavy leather armor
---
Couldnt find any singke mongrels, it was always a pack of them in that spot
---
We already do this using bank alts man its easy to have several alts for different things for your main. Store 1000s and 1000s of weapons you pick up on them.
---
Just grab a mate and have them pass it to your alt. Then they can retrieve stuff for ya at will.
---
Heck we do this for tonnes of people.
---
I'd be level 300 probably, If i HADN'T HAD TO SCRAP MY FIRST CHARACTER due to it being totally bugged out from the BETA. That said, there WAS a glitch that allowed infinite XP (since fixed) that a lot of people took advantage of not too long ago. ALSO the glowing ones at Whitesprings WERE giving crazy amounts of XP but they nerfed that so if you spent a lot of time killing ghouls at WS you could have leveld up pretty fast before they nerfed it

Giving up on installing..
---
Yeah, the server crashed about 10 minutes after the fight, and I've done another log out after that seeing if I got it back.
---
I have a train station too! [https://imgur.com/a/WQuJqUU](https://imgur.com/a/WQuJqUU)
---
Zealots multi purpose axe 40% more power attack damage and I forget the other mod. Fyi zealots is 30% more damage to scorched for those who didnt know.
---
What the hell?
---
who the hell walks around with 7 buffout, what a cheater. 
---
Yeah for real it'd be so damn nice for the queen foght
---
Yeesh.  he probably also eats his own peeled skin after a sunburn...
---
Hmm you may be onto something, I'll check it out too.
---
I 'saw' a similar camp last night. Guy standing in one area a LONG time so I went to check. Nothing there, I was standing on top of him. He decided to move out and I followed him, he was just level 90 but I am going back to find that invisible camp later today. I found a partly rendered rock you can live in sort of near Harper's Ferry but it's not big enough for much other than a scrapping bench... 
---
I’m impressed at what people come up with. Building in 76 is way more tedious than 4, so anyone taking the time gets a nod from me.
---
Question. I’m level 62 and have more hours in than I care to admit, but I have almost no plans for my camp. Are there any good places I should look or any tips in collecting all the plans?
---
I haven't had any issues in 300 hours of play with PvP.
---
I did come back to my base once to find my power door was missing and my bed was destroyed. I still wonder to this day if another player did that or just an unfriendly scorched. Wouldn't the game tell me if someone was attacking my base?.....if someone did destroy my door and my bed I hope that person gets a bad case of swamp itch.
---
If they sell budget for only cosmetic furniture than it wouldn't be pay to win, but that would mean that they divided the budget between defense and cosmetic items to begin with. Which would be a nice change from the current system where it's just one thing.  
---
90 Supers, 40 regular
---
A lawsuit? That's beyond stupid. 
---
yeah looks like it should be a auto grenade launcher, no flames
---
I can explain *breathing intensifies*
---
Awesome, thanks a lot! Thats non-modded right? 
---
It was downvoted and became invisible.
---
I had the same idea a few months ago! :O
---
I would love a game-wide event that would require players to gather enough material to build new cities or repair structures! I should've posted it here :P
---
I only usually carry 10 on me at any time. Might bump up to 20 for Nike blast etc. Have about 50 regular and 20 super in storage and sell all of my diluted. Why does anyone keep those ones?
---
Yea, that’s actually why I was asking around...I’d like to start playing around w/ something and have fun w/ it
---
I appreciate all the good info and responses, will be doing more than census violence in the big from here in out
---
He found it all
---
Is this true about the targeting helmet? I use it and crash constantly. I crash more though since the latest update. 
---
When you log in and see the 000 counter just click reload or shoot once to bring the true display back. Its a bug from the get go. It's most likely on their list to fix.
---
Mmmmhmmmm I bet 
---
Your world is full 😢😫
---
Lol. More like both Dysentary and Food loss Parasites
---
So I'm wondering.. if people figured out how to get into dev rooms ... they can figure out how to get inside the map and build a camp, right? While getting into a dev room will get you banned now, doubt that using the same sort of program or whatever to toggle clipping will get you banned if you are just making an invisible camp... just a thought. I don't know enough about it all to know if that's even possible
---
Just because someone is roleplaying as a raider (or is just an asshole) doesn't make them  a duper. Not everyone wants to play goodie-two-shoes Helpy McHelperton.  
---
Me personally, I love to help people in game, but without other people who don't want to help, the wasteland becomes weirdly friendly, thus defeating the point of me helping people.
---
Yeah the glowing ones were the most bullied ahah
---
The thing is, im level 81, completed all missions, most events, I got the 3 main PAs, a cool Camp, good weapons and discovered all locations. I imagine that most ppl around level 100 already had the game pretty much completed... so what to do after that that takes to level 300? Farming? Its nuts.
---
I hope they release more content soon enough.
---
show me a two shot that does 2 to 3 k damage. That doesn't exist in the game. A TSE maybe if its a dragon or black powder rifle. That being said why not just cap the damage taken by other players in pvp fights. Or make it so the T and E cant go together on weapons. This nerf will not stop people from getting one shotted even if they nerf bobble heads it wont. Even if they nerf mele. There are so many ways to do crazy damage. One of the things I like about this game. 
---
I keep them because I have the perk that makes your stimpaks heal you more. My diluted heals me for like 47% I believe so I like having more of those than any other kind 
---
I heard he lost his children, but sold nice leathershoes.
---
This.  Set one Jetpack, optimized bracers and kinetic servos.  Set two Stealthboy, optimized bracers and calibrated shocks.
---
Just sell them to a vendor or you could even go as far as listing them on fo76market or fo76bazaar or drop a few in the new player areas every once in a while.
---
Tip though, just because it has legendry effects doesn't mean its to good to throw away. Stash space the way it is, I'd  just bin them off and start collecting again.
---
My rule of thumb is if i don't use it i don't carry it or stash it. This isn't like fo4 where we can keep everything single item that isn't nailed down. 
---
I thought I was going crazy. I wasn't double tapping! 
---
So that's why there was a broken deathclaw egg next to him.
---
I’ll say.  I’m really intrigued to get the amount Blair workshop up and running but no way if it’s just going to vanish hours of hard work scavenging for nuclear material.   
---
yeah lol. there are a lot of people here. You'll get in eventually.
---
They could do an event like this in the 2 weeks leading up to the release of a dlc, for example if they were releasing a Point Lookout/Far Harbor style dlc then we would have to build a dock and boat by collectively contributing large amounts of scrap across all servers (like 1 million wood from everyone combined) and you get rewards for contributing scrap to the project. Once the scrap goals are met for the entire project then the dock and boat will be finished and we will see it in game as a new location, then the dlc releases and we use what we built to access this new dlc zone. These player collaborative projects could as a lore friendly and productive scrap dump, which is neccessary to have.
---
i think it will be better to separate defence and visual budgets.
---
Its pretty stipid whrn i forced to choose between turret and pool table lol
---
 I did not know it did that, sweet.  Finally, a reason to spend some free atoms.
---
Probably nerf that next if you do that :-)
---
Looks like a scene from Scarface
---
I think if the rebuilding is completed over all servers, then nuking the area would take down the bridge (in this example) on that specific server for the duration of the nuke event. Then the bridge would magically spawn back  to normal after the nuke event ends.
---
Obviously there would need to be some interesting thing that happens when you nuke the bridge (or whatever area gets rebuilt) for this to be worth nuking, especially if that area has some decent benefits that you'd then be removing for the next 2 hours.
---
For sure, I’ve gone through the whole marketplace loop and already drop 90% of what I find.  But the stuff I know is worth holding and selling, even that all piles up, and the chore of listing and waiting and meeting and trading is just too much.
---
Everything should scale to player level and number of players.
---
One of my biggest gripes about the upcoming weapon Nerfs is how brutally unfair the game is to solo players.
---
Why do I need to kill the same amount of super mutants intended for a group of 4 players?
---
Until I got good weapons in the game I spent most of my time crafting ammo and repairing guns.
---
Filthy casual here, just broke 100 hours.
---
First off, thank you for this. Second, I have 3 things that seem to theme over all of this for me and they are
---
1.) Most of, if not all, content seems to be PvP focused.
---
2.) Wow, that is a lot of cut content. (Holiday stuff hit the hardest)
---
3.) Don't really see anything that would address the struggling endgame right now for Co-op and PvE.
---
Once a week would probably be too much to ask, but a monthly (or every now and then) free pack of 3 items: skin, emote, pose; or CAMP item, hairstyle, frame...that might be doable.
---
And, like you said, after the month of being free, it goes to pay.
---
You should check out the Lucky Strike map machine in Welch. 
---
Grahm didn't like him in his territory is what happened. 
---
It's amazing, AND I LOVE IT.
---
M'utfruit
---
LOL...... Dysentery would be better if it were accompanied by diarrhea like the cannibal perk.
---
I have 10 on me and 20 reserves in stash in case of emergencies.
---
I usually end up selling a lot of them. Don’t see the point of having lots. I find more than enough in my travels while farming.
---
T-51b for the rad Nuka paint job and best phy/eng defense.
---
T-60 for cheap repairs and balanced defenses.
---
I had a higher level buddy that wanted to see me, a level 24 launch a nuke at fissure sight prime. He expected me to level up to level 25 while in the silo so I can put on my power armor (lvl25). Unfortunately I had to run and hide the whole time while he smashed those menacing Mr. Gustys to oblivion.
---
It’s pretty much like this in every MMO-like game.  Just track the quest you’re on, and turn all others off.
---
Does this happen often? I have a CAMP I've completed that I'm really proud of and I've had multiple people come to my place and spam the thumbs up and heart emotes. One person even left me stimpacks. Maybe it's because I'm a level 25ish player... but it's really just my second character.
---
If someone does destroy my CAMP can't I just repair everything? I heard it's free to repair too.
---
Lock picking especially! Far too many times I’ll be exploring and just pass right over a locked box just because I’m tired of perk swapping.
---
In comparison, I would never miss an opportunity to lock pick in past fallouts. I would love decks, especially if you could hit key them. I don’t mind an activation period or a cool down between swapping.
---
I just get tired of pressing Tab, T, Tab again to cancel picking a perk, and then a not super pc friendly menu system for all this swapping. I’m sure something this will be implemented in the future, but decks is the idea I support the most!
---
Pvp servers: 
---
You shouldnt be able CHOOSE which server you  want to play on today.  Hopping between pvp and pve. 
---
Moving to a pvp server at "pvp server launch" should permanently leave your character there. Or you must REROLL in the pvp server and start at lvl 1. 
---
Heres why:
---
People will do all there grinding, questing and farming in pve servers. Gear up, hit 50+, Empty junk and hop into pvp servers for a really lame battle royale with NO RISK AT ALL. 
---
Thats not what we want. We want risk. We want to be scared of other players bc we have a pocket full of goodies.  Regardless of balance issues, i want a hardcore PVP SURVIVAL game. 
---
If you can hop back and fourth, im staying in the current servers and spending most of my time pvping and camp raiding there. Im not trying to play fortnite. 
---
I dont want people farming legendaries in the pve server. I want people trying to farm in the chaos of the pvp server.  You shouldnt be able to hop back and fourth. 
---
The reload animations and sounds are satisfying enough to not upset me to have to lock and load when I log in.
---
Also, it's only really a display error. Fire your weapon and you'll see that it's actually just not showing your actual loaded ammo.
---
I want black paint on my Gauss Rifle and Excavator PA
---
Seems legit
---
What if you have an empty city somewhere in the center of the map where everyone can build for free, enough space for everyone to build.
---
It's hard to get every position of every junk you could use in the camp.
---
One way to provide that would be to allow lets say 10 slots in shelves to put it in and they won't move from it. I would love that
---
Agreed games learned this long long long ago. Pvp and Pve servers and things remain away from one another.
---
username checks out
---
Create it on all servers, but have it be a massive resource sink. Then make something happen when you nuke it that makes it worth losing whatever benefits come from rebuilding it (if any). There could also be downsides of having (in this example) the bridge up, like harder enemies start to spawn in areas they weren't in originally because they migrated across the bridge. 
---
my playtime is all over the place but usually early morning/late evening on the weekends and afternoons during the week. i've already run into a few people who have camps nearby so it's a decently known spot, it seems!
---
There's a lot of comments so I apologize in advance if what I'm suggesting was already said; but I remember playing WoW many years ago and you could "donate" mats to vendors in the capital cities (or maybe just Iron Forge?) to support the "war effort" or whatever. I can see this working for FO76 by instead of it being a server thing, it's just simply a game-wide effort. Sure, it could be separate by platform, but just donate certain junk to a vendor somewhere in Appalachia and they keep track of your characters contributions. Once the community goal or milestone has been met, the game receives an update with the ongoing/finished project. Everyone who contributed gets a reward, maybe the top contributors get a special reward (atoms, exclusive commemorative cosmetics, etc) and the world is changed permanently by the players. One could argue that eventually, they might run out of room or this would spoil the game experience for newer players, but I'm sure some sort of compromise could be found like possibly locking the newer stuff behind a quest chain but I still don't have a clear cut solution to that sort of problem. Anyway, just my two cents.
---
It's all about maximizing resources.
---
That is my exact build running TSE pipe bolt-action instead. It's actually been my favorite guy to play with, just because I never have to worry about repairing and after I max out adrenaline and drug up I'm usually the main damage dealer on the SBQ. I'm hoping to get an anti-armor version after the TSE nerf, but we'll see if RNGsus is feeling generous!
---
I had to fight three level 50 behemoths and one level 50 legendary behemoth at the northern workshop west of Wavy Willard's. 
---
I was only level 20-something at the time but I killed them. I abused their dumb AI, they are melee only, they would 1-2 hit kill me but I found a patch where they couldn't figure out how to get to me and I would hop off it if they tried to run away to lure them back. It was only a matter of time and bullets (lots) to kill them.
---
This was just before the XP nerf to killing higher level creatures as well, so I netted a good chunk of experience killing them.
---
It is most likely a bug.
---
Yup.  
---
I'm not sure fo76 will be around in a few years.
---
Very cool.  I am amazed you have enough camp budget for all that.  Does the artillery not cost as much as turrets?
---
Vendors often have a lot. For a fusion generator do the power plant events. It took me 4 or 5 successful runs to get one. I often find plans just laying round, too. Often people will drop extra plans into suitcases around vendor spots. 
---
29 Inert flux.....ha.
---
I bet he is wondering why he is over incumbered.
---
Eh, it's not as simple if you want to roll solo like myself.
---
Still need a stash increase to 800 or 1000. 
---
The main problem is the combat is so boring.  Can you click your left mouse button while keeping a dot on something that covers 1/2 your screen...  They need to rethink the whole combat system make it more involved.  A nuke raid consists of hitting everything you can with melee, then swaping to ranged.  All while consuming a radaway every minute or two and hitting a stimpack button as needed.  There is nothing epic or fun about it.  Combat needs to more lethal or dodging/blocking an active skill, or special weak points you need to find on bosses, or bosses have key animations you must learn to dodge, run , stand here, etc... to make the fight difficult.  
---
If you are going to keep pve so boring then the pvp needs to be lethal and open to all.  Some jerk kills you so he can kill the boss or takes all your gear when you die.  Border Lands, Diablo and WoW all had different ways to do loot games.  I feel like FO76 take the most boring in the middle stance

Daily Quest Started:

LEGENDS OF THE WASTELAND
---
- Collect Legendary weapons and armor to give to MODUS in the Science Wing of the Whitespring Bunker.
---
Had one, but between it only lasting a core and a half and being expensive to repair it's just sitting in my stash. I'll probably be able to part with it after the nerf.
---
O i did not mean we don't need increases. I want increases like mad man and on top of that a shared
---
stash between alts lol. Just letting OP know how to go about their issue. Unless i guess if they don't have a clan or rl mates on the game mm.
---
Never seen it, can you post some pics of him and vendor store?
---
I don't even play the game and I like this idea.
---
Yup know that feeling! The trade window couldn't be any more anti trading if Bethesda had tried! 
---
Even more annoying when you try kit noobs out with gear and end up wasting 20-40 minutes getting them to notice the bag on the floor and even than trying to get them to pick it up can be more exhausting than its worth.
---
I did start hanging around the mire and fort defiance looking for people to give stuff to with a bit more success, as there usually around lvl 30-40 then they kinda get the jist of high levels unloading a ton of freebies etc but even then :/
---
Defo be cool if they did add some sort of use for them though with faction tokens or re-rolling stats on them at the cost of another etc. Shit id even be happy trading them in for stim packs and rad away's at this point!
---
Update! Ok guys.. He just dropped dead! lmfao
---
5 and 15 diluted. Do events to get more. 
---
If you are on discord, would you be able to lend a hand installing the mod? I've followed the steps but the game tabs out all the time
---
I've got an explosive energy gatling gun. The damn thing won't last more than 2 reloads before breaking on me.
---
Wait until the TSE nerf and some of those weapons may be better than mid-grade. Then sell the rest to vendors, because what's left after that is worse than mid-grade.
---
gets me everytime 
---
I felt the same before I got mutations and got rid of my PA. I also like being in 3rd when I run around looking for loot/deadbodies/crops etc... To each their own :) 
---
Definitly lowers the amout of rads you get, however, you still need to use radaway fairly often without rad sponge.
---
What’s the deal with him not showing up for me?
---
The only type of building that works in MMOs is short term. Needs to take minutes not days and can be destroyed. Those giant server projects are just an economy resource drains where the developers click a button one day declaring it built (actually percentage is usually a fake display). They don't actually have any game play value. It is the same as turning in stuff for a random quest. And this would fall under that category.
---
Looks like they are taking the Bungie approach to balance. Don't deal with the cause, just nerf the symptoms as they crop up until every item in the game is borderline useless
---
This is exactly how they should open up new areas of the game. 1,000,000 steel at 100/player/day would have to be contributed to rebuild a bridge to the area (or other means of transport), which is 10,000 player-days  worth of material, thus preventing dupers from effecting it unless they want to stand out there and hand materials to everyone that comes to donate, which wouldn't even help them, so they probably won't do it.  
---
Obviously they would have to scale this number based on how many people are playing the game, which isn't a number I have handy, but I feel like if it takes 2x or 3x the number of monthly unique players worth of player-days to complete it, that could balance out the filthy casuals like me and the hardcore players like a lot of the people here both getting a chance to contribute.
---
They’re apart of the story

For some reason I can't seem to raise tickets on mobile with Edge. Might work on Chrome or Firefox.
---
I used to hold down the workshop w the lead extractor near new gad, then farm new gad for guns to scrap for steel. Hawkes refuge north of sugar Grove has tons of can chimes too. 
---
Op is ok with the ts/e nerf until scorchbeast queen is not doable anymore unless you bobble stack or abuse melee damage
---
There was other means to do that
---
That's awesome. I'd love to see that in real life. Me and my buddies on Xbox live have built a town along the western River. We've got everyone as close as we can and it is pretty freaking cool to see people walk through there.

Gamertag = TEH RED ZMAN
---
You sound like you fit in with our group really well.
---
On another note, here is how you get a decent screenshot out of the Xbox one for that sort of stuff.
---
1. Get to a good place and go into photo mode and take your photo. You can make it a much further zoomed out photo by changing the first option in photo mode. I can't remember what it's named. You can use that to zoom way out.
---
2. Go into the photo gallery and open up the photo you're interested in.
---
3. Hide the UI using the button suggested at the bottom.
---
4. Hold down the guide button on your Xbox One and then take a screenshot.
---
These screenshots and such will show up under recent captures and you can share them out to Twitter or OneDrive. You can also go to Xbox dvr.com and look up your Gamertag and see all of your stuff and either download it or share it from there.
---
I've recently read a post from awhile back that people will nuke grafton steel, power plants and places where large events happen. Grafton sounds like a challenge because it would be nothing but high level super mutants and melee is off the table for the most part, also you can get a ton of Flux from the surrounding areas, I've also thought that nuking the mire would have some high xp gain enemies but be equally a problem. My legendary farm is whitesprings/the two tower mansions/the workshop area on the edge of savage and cranberry/uranium fever/watoga(most of the buildings will have atleast one legendary except the ams building) whitesprings still has the most but I've noticed I still get better loot in other places. 
---
She does become a meat pile, last time I killed her she poofed but we found her pile. It doesn't always put the pile where she fell, we had to look for a bit before we found it.
---
Why would the Chinese go to the effort and risk of building such an advanced and expensive robot in an area their spies think is unimportant and just has decoy nuke silos?
---
Nerf stimpaks via a cooldown, carrying a shit-ton is fine, replacing your blood with stimpak juice in 2 seconds in PA to turn on pseudo-godmode is where it becomes a problem.
---
I wish we could find the backstory on Graham someplace to see what he was like pre-mutation
---
Oww like that, i don't know why but i was thinking about the the unmanned flying bots.  
---
Never saw that one before though, only the super mutant.
---
Perk card system is actually garbage 
---
Did you even read his post? “Non PA character”.  Some people like the challenge of never using PA on a build. 
---
My god
---
I want...
---
Haha i guess well see if its actual DLC that's coming or just stuff they cut before launch to use as DLC as they thought we already had enough content hey :/
---
At least in Destiny the open world is full of target practice enemies that you can kill with any gun in the game.
---
In Fallout the PvP players cry for a nerf and now I'm out here trying to kill 29 super mutants with a pipe pistol.
---
Also Destiny has default character builds so the player hasn't invested dozens of level perks towards a particular weapon before they nerf it.
---
Even if she does become a meat pile, it's almost likely it can never be found. Happened numerous times and the whole lot of us were searching the entire place but not once have we found the meat pile
---
He only spawns in one spot on the map. AND it's rare when he does. Also, he dies after a cretin about of time. Usually around 30 minutes.
---
Oh I have 
---
I know that. I mean that when I got there he as dead. 
---
personally i cant tell the difference between my t-60 or my x-01
---
both are lvl 50
---
I find him like once a week..
---
I agree, but there still isn't any great end game content.
---
I have plenty I don't need more haha
---
Believe it or not I've gotten a few prime receiver plans from them. It's insanely rare I'd say 1 in every 8 drops a plan. It's crazy. 
---
I've watched streamers/Youtubers nuke all over and nothing cool ever happens, its kind of a bummer.
---
Add: RAVE--PMW 
---
Level 206
---
I just estimate by checking another location that is roughly the same distance.
---
I totally agree. Theres this super long hidden quest chain (no map markers) to unlock TNT dome 2 (alien blaster ammo one). You actually have to read notes, piece things together and travel all over the world map to like 4 or 5 different locations, the last being super well hidden safe with keypad under a cabin. I had a ton of fun figuring it out,  brought me back to fallout 1 and 2 when you actually had to read and interact with stuff without everything just being given to you and identified on your map... we need more stuff like this
---
Ps. (Yes I know that you can just find the key sitting in a locker in the ash heap and not do that whole thing, theres no fun in that though)
---
Yup, I gotta agree: it's broken. Really sucks the joy outta the game. Bust your ass to beat a boss like the SB queen only to be spat upon with the same T-ball trophy.... over and over. Please B, fix this. 
---
I was talking specifically about TSE, and they exist. Namely shotguns but I’ve seen some pipe rifles that hit for astronomical damage as well. 
---
Absolutely. However, a lot of deliberate solo players go out of their way to avoid any and all other players. So just looking at it from the perspective of a player like this, whose experience of the game is 99% free of other gamers and run-ins with other gamers, there may be less incentive for that player to spend the atoms on, for example, a clown suit. I think this may be especially true if we view the experience of the clown suit (or anything like it) as a thing that enjoys the greatest benefit when used in a group setting. As I mentioned previously, the cost-benefit of the item, its cosmetic value so to speak, is maximized under circumstances of experiential sharing, such that all your friends getting a good laugh out of the suit (or a good scare) makes the expense more than reasonable.
---
The system is ONLY for two things. Battle or weight reduction. Poor design.
---
Sure
---
I’m sure this would introduce the FO4 glitch for exploiting build limits, drop guns x1000, scrap guns, build until your frame rate hits 0. GG
---
You can put some things on them like lamps and chats, turrets and of course succulents
---
I've had that happen.  I try to shoot my pistol and it has no bullets.  Then I have to wait for it to load and do that stupid spin the chamber move.  By that time I've already taken damage.
---
You gotta rip off that band aid man, you don’t need those weapons, just toss them on the ground and make space for things you’ll use.
---
Great, now I need to scroll ALL THE WAY BACK UP to the top of your post just to upvote you for this valuable post. Rude.
---
Remember if there is no player near, nothing happens.
---
My camp is right next to SB spawning point. It's that grey area in upper left corner. When the SB hasn't spawned yet from that place on the server, the ground is intact. Then you hear loud craaah, it pops out of the ground, leaving that grey dead area, and in the middle of it is the glowing pool of nuked lava(?) you see plenty in bog. It's just like fissure site except smaller and not market on the map. Which is how I ended up making the camp right next to it, I just didn't know about them.
---
https://i.imgur.com/t0C3675.jpg 
---
I don't usually visit the camp so it stays completely intact. If SB spawns when I'm at there, it nukes my turrets in few seconds, then slowly grinds away all my crops. Most of the time it barely cares about anything else. I've build those defensive things around because they seem to drag some enemies so they don't go wrecking my crops.
---
I think by making brief visits to camp and also not killing the SB if it's around, might cause it to respawn quite less. Usually the lava pit is open so it has spawned, possibly because some player was walking nearby on the road, or taking over the workbench also nearby, and just flew away to craah that player, instead of wrecking my turrets and crops.
---
It's a bit odd actually, I haven't repaired the camp in like 3 weeks or even more.
---
Recently had a nice 3 star legendary around. Mirelurks don't usually come there, there is small swamp around which often has mirelurk queen in it, it's not really close but maybe it tried to follow some player moving nearby road, and then got gradually drifted close to my camp.
---
https://i.imgur.com/HhEIjlG.jpg
---
This would also open the framework for very rudimentary faction conflicts where each side has designs for an area or resolutions to a conflict and the plan that gets more resources inputted "wins".
---
IDK that was just my experience with her body disappearing.
---
I did the SBQ event  too, she lost half health but somehow she regained her health. Took us like 15 min to take her down.  It was the first time i joined  the fight against the queen.  The drop was ok. Got contamination arc plans and prime plans 
---
Not really.  Tho x1 is good for energy resistance it is about the same rad resistance as the rest 
---
That’s such a fun gun. 
---
Just my thoughts anyway.... but if your on pc grab perk Manager i have like 6 builds i can swap at the flick of a button. Super handy going from camp build , healing build, range shotgun, melee 2h hander , lock picking / hacking on the go.
---
Thanks. Looks great
---
I clearly hang out on the wrong side of the mire (hood) then... lol :(
---
Waiting a few seconds with the last shot to give him time to run to me. Because I'm too lazy to walk over to his dead body. Then casually loot him clean before the body hit the dirt. 👍
---
Checked his emails? 
---
"Apparently" the Ban hammer was falling and accounts with certain items or that had accessed certain areas were being banned (apparently).  
---
Not suggesting he's been cheating just Bethesda aren't known for there amazing coding skills, so if the ban hammer is running in the background it could be catching innocent accounts by accident etc.
---
So is the guy in the nosebleeds dying from you-induced cringe.
---
Thanks. I’ve bought most of the plans from the Whitesprings vendors and the train station vendors usually don’t have much (my experience). Are there other vendors I don’t know about or have overlooked?
---
I’ve got the generator plan, which is nice. Do all events drop plans? Because I usually avoid those.
---
For sure, I've always used Whitespring for legendary farming, because there is just so many. Even with the recent exp nerf, it's still a pretty good place to level. My only problem with it though, is that since they released the recent patch, every single time I nuke anything the server turns to complete crap. Most of the nukes I launch end up being a waste of time, because as soon as the zone changes I get booted from the server. I nuked the golf course the other day, and after I was able to actually load in, which took several restarts of the game, I noticed that there were hardly any enemy spawns period. I was grouped that day, so I could try loading in several times, but normally I play solo, so it's almost not worth launching a nuke right now. 
---
I don't mind it, I see why they've done it like they have as with the FO4/Skyrim systems you could essentially get every perk and be an all round mega character if you were willing to level that highly. But with PvP that would just make people too op, as they could stack every advantage going if they just put more hours than you. 
---
IMO I get kinda annoyed having to swap things out whenever I craft things or even buy and sell things. As most of the time, (my own fault) I forget I have to go in swap a bunch of perks, repair my weapons or armour. Then swap them back put so I can do damage etc again! Oh well. 
---
Elder scrolls will be out sometime in the next couple years and I can just PRAY that with the success of ESO that they'll leave it single player and focus on making yet another fantastic game. 
---
Maybe I also have an idea for the Lore. Isn't WV just near Washington? Place some strong forces near a so important objective could have been fondamental for an invasion force. They could import the resources for the Mama Murphy factory, and in the same boxes they could have placed pieces and plans for the bots. I remembered that they managed to import weapons, obiouvsly made in metal, as robot's parts. Locate and destroy the Nuke Silos would have been really important.
---
Or this robots were launched with the Liberators, but they had a device connected to the secret base
---
Or something else LOL
---
Aaand the LOL ruined all the explaination.
---
LOL.
---
What did you expect ? Todd howard was clearly lying saying there was future content, they will put pvp event ( if not bugged ) and the 3 vault, then they will work on the next fallout, simple as that
---
I thought you could't get explosive legendary on explosive guns?
---
Weappnsmith and luck of the draw and it still nreals after 2 reloads lol. 
---
Oh shit that sucks 
---
Well the level 300+ folk I saw last night killed the SBQ within a few minutes then killed me and took my stuff .  If Beth doesn't release new stuff soon people are going to get REALLY bored and start really getting aggro I'd wager
---
I sadly know, this could be just a badass add
---
Bobs at best a sheep and at worst an idiot.
---
What story? "Oh my god, *every single human* died because of an enemy I can basically one-shot with my pipe pistol!"
---
It's the little things in life...
---
Easily
---
I have zero doubt they’ll make adjustments to enemy HP, DR, DPS, melee DPS and the like for almost all enemies.  
---
Yes, there are going to be “build around” and preferential perks, that’s normal, but Two shot and explosive pre patch were so far and away better that there was literally zero competition from the others. 
---
I don’t know enough about your last points/suggestions to have an informed opinion, I’ll look further into it. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
---
Ohhh. got cha. Well, I'm gonna farm him again. I'll update the post when I get him.
---
excited for more pvp events to force pacifist players out of their shell
---
Yeah me and the dude was playing around in a mineshaft we die of course it respawns us on the nuke zone. Rads out the ass
---
Nice. You gave fair warning
---
Where are you getting ultracite from?
---
Holotapes, robots, terminals, pa speakers, notes, all give the story, as well as the atmosphere of places  
---
Bob is both. Don't be like Bob.
---
Well I know a trick that works 75% of the time. Go to the workshop where you can make package food above the Nuka Cola plant. Capture the plant do everything you supposed to. After you official capture the plant and defended the plant. You then stay at the plant and do all the defend mission. After the 3rd,4th or 5th defend mission of workshop. Grahm will spawn outside on the up the road a little bit above the workshop like your coming from Flatwoods.
---
I don’t do this cause it takes about an hour,but it does work.
---
I'd like minigames in this game like Ultima Online had. We should be able to actually play pool with people.Would be cool if we also got that pinball machine from watoga too and made it playable and have it keep track of the highest score on it.
---
I'd like to know how this pans out. The way I understood it was Bethesda does not have tools to recover things like this.
---
I was wondering why you care what Bob thinks, but then I realized who are you talking about:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whoB89oGoIk
---
I prefer to mix and match, unless there’s a bonus for a matching set like with ex, there’s no harm.
---
Whitesprings will be bathed in nuclear fire at all times. 
---
I had a really similar church based on one I made in FO4! Love the alter though - I didn't think of raising it up like that. I even had the pastor outfit to go with it.
---
The train station though? Great idea. I'll have to give that a try myself at some point. It will go on my list.
---
 yeah its annoying when you have multiple teams in a voice chat party and keep accidentally shooting each other
---
Pick them up but only to sell. I have the healing serum so now rely on canned dog food with the perk for my stimpak equivalent. 
---
Maybe some kind of access to the top which requires jumping. The AI can't do a jump puzzle to get up somewhere. 
---
Camden Park bot Vendor for plans. The mod itself can spawn anywhere Excavator mods are sold, but it's rare.
---
I played with this location for 3 days figuring out what I wanted to do. Couldn't settle so I moved back to Seneca Rocks. You absolutely nailed it. Looks awesome!
---
It's a great idea, I just wouldn't hold my breath expecting it to happen. 
---
Killing scorchbeasts, harvesting ultracite ores at fissure site, or go to a nuked zone and kill ghouls. Sometimes they carry hardened mass as drop. Hardened mass can be scrapped to ultracite
---
If only flamer ammo wasn't the single most expensive thing too craft in the game lol (j/k, but only a little).
---
You can just repair everything but I don't think its free, it costs materials.I'm level 94 with around 170 hours in the game and I havn't had anyone attack my camp once, so I don't think its as common as it might seem. I also have 0 defenses.
---
I think the only time people do that are litterally the people who's main goal is to go around destroying camps. If you are in a server with one of them I guess your camp might get destroyed if they find it.I don't think regular people see a camp and are like "oh should I destroy this?"
---
Lol that's too good
---
Can confirm no suppressor or sights. WYSIWYG
---
Youre acting like this is confirmed to he everything. We dont have enough information. Stop freaking out. The developers arent going to put every idea for a future update hidden in the game, that makes very little sense.
---
Seems weird that an SMG is not effected Guerilla, but I guess Guerilla literally only effects pistols with automatic receivers.
---
Still 0 paintjob for gun unless you pay 6 $ for it (cheapest one lol)
---
Clearly they made those pvp event before the launch,cutted them to fool us into thinking that was actual new content, they surely removed it when they saw how much of a joke the pvp is in this game 
---
[This is WoW's "War Effort"](https://www.wowhead.com/news=279923/wow-classic-spotlight-the-ahnqiraj-war-effort)
---
That’s sort of subjective, I find the combat better than previous FO titles for sure, and I like your suggestions on expanding movement and mechanics. Hopefully we’ll see these implemented in the future.
---
I can't certify it but it seems like the meat pile tend to appear at the spot where she dies, so if her body ragdolled far away, you might just check at the spot of her death.
---
Spent once 10 min just to search the meat pile all around the area, and found the meat pile close to where she actually died in the air and not at where her body was.
---
Raise the camp onto a 1x1 foundation/stair stand. Only real way to stop it.
---
Yep I believe it'd be a huge help and a nice qol improvement 
---
I know a lot of Bobs irl. I keep them @ a safe distance.  
---
I think a community event where we build the world hub would be kinda amazing, as we finish building it there could be an event where in order to inaugurate it we need to defend it in a war against the Scorched similar to how they attacked and destroyed every other settlement in WV.
---
I think being stealthed out doesn’t count u as in the silo, I sometimes run with a friend using a melee build while I’m on a stealth sniper and only 1 players’ worth of bots spawn in on launch prep. I shoot nukes solo a lot too so it generally seems like it’s about 1 enemy per chief plus a robo brain and an assultron thrown in. 
---
I have a strange suspicion that eyebots also have something to do with spawn rates. I’ve run the silo with a full group before and I stealth one shot all the eye bots that spawned during launch prep before they aggroed any of my team and basically still got one players worth of bots. I might just be grasping at straws to comprehend or understand a mechanic that’s probably broken. 
---
Because I am supposed to know something like this existed. If they every consider doing this then at least they'll be informed about this exploit I hope? That, or enjoy paying 2 - 5 bucks each and every time you want to add something other than stash boxes and wardrobes in your camp for the rest of eternity.
---
Hardened mass can be scrapped as ultracite?!?
---
Would be nice to find this out. I’m on vacation and won’t be playing this week or I would have already tried it out for myself. 
---
this just got stapled to a [dolphin](https://youtu.be/uA64y2j5I3w)
---
Yeah it can
---
They could have requested your gun as part of the trade :(
---
Be very interesting to see how this works out now, apparently the game dev's got the tools to ban people the other day it would be such a shame if they didn't bother giving them the tool's to actually fix this crap and quest items disappearing at the same time though.
---
Not saying that's what happened but its more than likely they requested your gun at the same time off the trade, is the guy still on the same server. Maybe try set up another trade and look through there weapons to see if you recognise your weapon :(
---
That's what I was thinking it did
---
Even a option to destroy two unwanted perk cards in order to animate another perk card would be great.
---
I don't have any screws, unfortunately
---
He likes to wander off look around for watoga bots shooting something, it’s usually Phoenix taking a few fusion cells to his chrome dome 
---
Hold up I want to keep my perception...
---
Ikr? You don't know if they have their mics open, so if you say "hello" through voice you might end up talking to yourself 😒 I can't wait for private servers where ppl try to roleplay or whatever...
---
I guess having more people on one server wouldn't hurt either 🙄 idk... 
---
Haha, that would be dope but prolly not.
---
agreed, this is bullshit
---
I finally got a legendary at lvl 100.  The good: explosive.  The bad?  Junkie's explosive.  I keep trying with addiction to see how strong it gets but I'm not looking to be all strung out all the time.
---
Great job.
---
why not just make the weapons behave differently in PVP and PVE instead? like.. if your flagged your shit gets nerfed if your not your normal..
---
Also, if you're on Xbox, I've learned the silencer mod if you want one.
---
Even a base Cryolator is handy on SBQ. I prefer to use it when she lands to keep her on the ground and conserve ammo, but it works in the air, too. Last night another player and I had our cryolators "talking" and it was night and day, considering most of the players who showed up were "undergeared."
---
EDIT: I rarely use it outside of SBQ, because I'm conserving ammo. :D
---
Use Spotify 😊
---
Don’t forget the bountiful selection of empty shelves. I agree though. Camps are pretty limited and it’s difficult to achieve an immersive lived in feel. 
---
Its Modus fucking with you!

I used to crash constantly on PS4 but have only had 2 since the update, 1 was at a Nuked Whitesprings after being there a while and the other it froze while getting in power armor. Much better for me now. I also recommend everyone rebuild the database at least once every couple weeks regardless, it really speeds everything up.
---
Thats a Duper,  you should report the player. 
---
Eh. It wouldn't be the same with it outside of the game.
---
The real question is, did they banned someone for dupping ? Apart from those entering devroom ?
---
Cuz no longer than today i saw a dude lvl 354 one shotting the queen with his gatling gun tse, then one shot every players (even with slap damage) to get the scrap and the flux they need
---
I am going to have to do something, he has plans I want. Maybe you could score a copy of the powered gate plans. I can mod most gun mods have plenty of caps and\can make you something nice.
---
About to put my feelers out for the plans.
---
This looks amazing! 
---
However the few times I have tried to build or move a camp even near an existing landmark it says I am too close and I end up setting the camp up a ways away. 
---
So this can be done, like if I find a house I can place the camp down and just decorate/improve the house or location as I want? Make it my own? 
---
It's likely more to do with are you walking or running? Unless you use escape artist you can only walk in stealth or you'll be seen. But I'll put it like this my melee user can stealth UNDER the queens head with 0 issue baring some random luck on her side and that's a see you from 20 miles off scorchbeast
---
Engine age has nothing to do with it. It's a design choice. 
---
Video pls
---
Upvoted for more attention.
---
I have lost one pa set once.
---
I think it related to the server laggy.
---
For example, the item A still exists in your inventory after you sold it to a vendor.
---
So naturally you sold it again, and this time you actually sold the one after item A.
---
All I am saying is that TSE made the game more exciting. Even if most players had the same legandary affixes at least now players have different builds which was pretty uncommon when the game started
---
agreed,. stop faggoting
---
Other turrets unlock with various perks (home defense /science /fireproof)
---
I think the only benefit of having 3 is the limit that any given player can only shoot 1 nuke per silo per server per day. So if you have a group farming queen and a designated nuke runner dropping bombs back to back you could get 3 kills in as fast as you can drop nukes. 
---
Glorious. 
---
This is an extremely important concept.  
---
Many types of builds should be able to get to a point where they're considered OP for certain situations, but they need to have a rock-paper-scissors-esque loop of counter-measures.  
---
Melee is great if they close the distance, but if rifle/vats/crit catches them before they get there, they're toast.  
---
I think this point/counterpoint is how you get a successful PVP experience.   
---
As for PVE, that's a whole different story, but they should have a similar balance. There should be enemies that make each "OP" build say "oh shit" and try and get away.
---
Gotta walk.  Be in stealth and watch out for sudden road-spawns.
---
Just got bored with the 76 stations. Now I can play what I want. 
---
1) Xbox one s
---
2) ButterBagels12
---
3) n/a
---
Almost every time I enter a crafting station, when I try to exit it just closes the crafting menu and just keeps me standing at the station. The only way I can get out is if I restart my game. This doesn't just happen at one place in the world it has happened in many different locations with almost all the crafting stations. Is there a way to fix this? Because right now every time I craft something I have to restart my game.
---
Just an idea if you see an 10 cap bounty most the time there new and opened a Footlocker or something and just want to know what just happened lol ran into this experience last night 😂
---
526 regular and 93 super
---
Yes fair, but no hint of anything and the fact Bathesda has yet to do anything but bug fixes (some of which should have been done before the game was released) doesn't make it seem like they're adding anything, which is idiotic. 
---
Nuke zones X-01, everywhere else T-51b, if you are a cheap skate wear T-60. All in all if you have radshields or a lot of radaway just live in your T-51b
---
I feel like my only relevant point of reference is the Destiny series, and both the first and second game had the same issue upon release- playerbase’s rabid consumption of the available content in a very short amount of time led to stale play loops and discontent. Then a couple DLC’s release (inevitably to a vocal minority saying “iT sHoUld’Ve BeEn iN tHe lAuNcH ReLeAsE”) and people are ok, then a couple more and all of a sudden the game is great.  
---
Every once in a while I hop onto bungee.net and listen to people’s rose colored glasses tinged reminiscing on D1 compared to D2 and chuckle. Also the stupid loot cave ordeal is highly relevant to what’s happened with this game come to think of it.
---
Any luck with asylum uniform in red? 
---
I'm pretty sure the big concrete walls pull the enemie's aggro. So perhaps one of those with turrets around it. Your base is probably close to a spawn point for dogs
---
DreadfulTurkey...
---
So, it still lasts longer than the plasma mini gun....
---
I’d also love to see faction specific towns or settlements added. I think that would really build on the community and competition aspect.
---
Naming them would be a great way to organise, I'd just add a prefix so sorted by A-Z. 
---
OK then I'm confused, I'll look again, cheers.
---
That. Is badass. Good job sir, one giant fallout thumbs up for you 👍🏻
---
I mean, I knew that doesn't make it easier. Bathesda has shot themselves time and time again with this. And I knew they wouldnt make anything new, I said it long before release and made my prediction of this game having a year life span. Its just idiotic Bathesda would release an online game with nothing in the pipes to be released for a couple to several years and have no future things to keep people in this game.
---
They barely take up any budget at all.
---
Actually yes, it is all about soft target raiding. I am a pure PVE guy but I get it. There are ways to defend the claim zone, and make claiming undesirable. 
---
First off, don't use turrets. They just ask for being attacked. They dont work well against players ready to fight anyway. 
---
Build fast travel point NOT right at the claim, as it takes time to warp in and you are vulnerable. 
---
Build only the resources you currently need, a fully built workshop is valuable to everyone.
---
Spend all the free resources. It makes claiming the camp very cap unfriendly.
---
Or you could just fill the claim place with stacks of stash boxes, but that just sucks.
---
Minimal free builds, that look empty. pretty much grief free
---
Haha I found him yesterday 
---
They changed the roofs? I managed to get one on my roof months ago haven't tried since.  I know second story floors have always been a bit glitchy and tossed items like the decontamination shower up a floor/roof. 
---
Did you try dropping it instead? 
---
Cheers, it's a bit of a hassle to get it right. Worth it though!
---
Thanks for reply. I played with Escape Artist for a while and it didn’t seem to make much difference but I may try again. Your build looks fun to try.  Thanks for posting it and for replying to so many comments. You’re doing very well for writing in your second language, too. 
---
At level 90, I’ve only encountered one griefer. This was just last night. Bobblehead stacker that killed my entire group and part of my camp. 
---
Nah. Not what I said at all. And if you don’t think they are going to tune HP, DR and other things this next patch I think you’re mistaken.
---
I find people kiting him up the stairs a lot.  Turns back once u kill all the bots
---
Yeaaaah...What was it that you were saying again? 
---
The wasteland needs more people like you :)
---
I play a stealth character and this is one of my favorite things to do. My goal when theres a number of enemies around is to take em out one by one, as quickly as possible.. Cant be spending too much time going thru loot haha
---
Yeah, I've bombarded many places. This one was to bombard the GOlf Club, but Whitesprings seems protected from bombardments. "Artillery not available"
---
Yeah, but I have no quest markers for down there... it points me to the airport, then once I'm inside the airport it points me back outside again... have I missed something?
---
Hi All,  I am trying to make the level 45 version of the power armor at level 66.  I have all of the Mats, but the option is not available.  
---
Do I need one of the Power Armor Perks to be able to make the level 45 version?
---
Usriev
---
Dismantling flamethrowers gives 100 fuel, so if you have the plan and the resources you can just keep crafting low level ones and get ammo from them
---
I think the worry is that we would have thousands or tens of thousands of random objects that need to be kept track of and physics-ed (making up the word).
---
An engine-easy way to do it would be to have an empty shelf. If we find a Mr Fuzzy bear... it goes on that shelf as a static object - part of the shelf in the same place each time - by interacting with it (like bobbleheads on the shelf in FO3). A picture frame can too, next to the bear. The tri fold flag can go on the next shelf down when you find it and don't scrap it. The pool balls can't though.
---
I make a pool table. If I find all the balls then I can place them on the table, again as a static part of the table. Can't find the 3 ball? That's a shame. You can't add it until you do. You can't place a pillow on it either.
---
You build a bed. You can place a pillow on it as a static part of the bed. A dirty or clean one. Which ever you find. But you can't put a broom or bucket on it.
---
And so on. And so on. And so on.
---
If this is the case I’m done. 300 hours to find a gun like this just to get robbed?!
---
Well if you're on PC that is just memey enough for me to purchase. Otherwise enjoy!
---
It’s almost as much effort as farming Whitespring with a TSE shotgun ;)
---
\--close
---
My gf and I found that and are wearing them as well lol.
---
My budget issue was resolved by getting on a new server
---
&gt;  It's reasonable that communist forces have a counterpart for Liberty Prime
---
No it's not, lore wise the Chinese didn't have the resources or technology for something like that. That, and the fact that base was for stealth operations.
---
I think it is at least 1-2 seconds, but lag can mess that up easily.
---
That and the indicator somehow isn't that noticeable, maybe that is the actual fix.
---
And maybe, if there are a load of these, there can be an extremely difficult quest to wipe one off the map with a nuke.
---
&gt;You’re asking for someone to two shot this into oblivion.
---
Who? Certainly not me.
---
Are you the one who made this google doc? I’ve been referring to it often and it contains a lot of this info. If so, thank you. And if not, this might be another good resource for you.
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbortvX4lbLW2iX0OFPHf8cdjUUQINDWDoYWiHL-080/mobilebasic
---
Anyone had any luck with the red asylum uniform ?
---
Hey man,  nice shot
---
I was even trying to hurry with my sale; just so happened I was down to a whole bunch of single and 2 cap items to meet my daily sales quota. 
---
The danger room stuff is almost certainly for the currently nonfunctional danger room in the &gt;!Mistress of Mysteries bunker!&lt;.
---
Ahh, no worries guys, logged out and back in twice and it's sorted now 😁
---
So the issue I’ve had with doing that is it seems the game won’t allow you to place down your base again if you choose to move it.
---
No it doesn't happen often. At least on PC. I've had my base attacked once in 350+ hours. Even then it was just turrets because they auto fire on wanted players. The player shot them back.
---
I’m really sad so much of the “future” of this game is based on PVP, between this and the inside-the-vault they seem to have all kinds of PVP plans, but not much in for actual world or group development 
---
Right now the least this game really needs is a few more end-level bosses that require a group to beat.  We can learn new tactics and how to work together, tight groups can work together like a military group, rag-tag groups of solo-ers learn how to come together and what their individual contributions can be.  
---
The SBQ is a good mission and example of this, you get squads that totally know what they are doing and it’s done in 5 minutes, and you get just groups of “novices” that finish with seconds to spare, but all have a great time. The only really problem with the mission is that it’s the only one so it gets so repetitive. 
---
Also 2 words: ANT QUEEN 
---
In addition to this, when there is a horde quest, make sure it’s an actual horde, 10 or more unless large scale units. Killed a ‘horde’ of cave crickets that totaled a number of 4. 
---
I leave town for two days for a wedding  and you go on a drunk rambling love letter to fallout 76 . tsk tsk I know someone im not giving more 3 star legendaries to :p 
---
a pipe minigun or gatling would be hard to design, but would probably look incredible
---
Re: the grill.
---
Theres a daily quest at the Hemlock Holes golf course that requires you to hunt and grill meat and veggies. Seems tied to that
---
Feel your pain! I got around 350 hours and never actually looted a TSE or half decent 3 star Leg. 
---
It might not be the case but this is what was happening when the rumours of people getting into your inventory were circulating. Its just a really crappy shoddy trade system. Not sure why it shows everything in your inventory to some random person when you trade though :/
---
You're not lying, no-one wants to hear you crumching your chips, or verbally/physically abusing your kids. Also, protip: please don't take me on an audio tour of your BM. Lawd.
---
Did he get banned or Suspended?
---
They are banning and suspending accounts for Duping,Exploiting. They are also banning and Suspending if you have items you shouldn’t have like the monster mash mask etc.
---
Best to check your emails and contact Bethesda.
---
Pray it’s a suspension and not a ban.
---
While I love the compliments I'm not the OP, also keep in mind you can add stealth bonuses to armour and I'm pretty sure heavy armour makes you easier to see while moving but I could be wrong there.
---
To answer your question: Easily.
---
The stated range on that is pretty funny too, sniping with a flame thrower!
---
Okay
---
That’s what I’m saying. Make it like a simulator, remove a bunch of the extra garbage in the “world” that needs to be tracked, same with individual load outs. Make combat *crisp and responsive* and eliminate the RNG “feels bad” of being beat by better gear, at least for an option for PvP. I’d play it in a freaking heartbeat.
---
or you could just not bother people by not being a lazy shit...
---
I can confirm both of these comments.
---
Nobody knows if it’s a bug,but it has been like that since day one. It’s more assumed that the quest will continue with dlc and updates. Once you find all tapes just toggle the quest off.
---
Yeah, reported earlier 😁
---
I'd totally nuke all the players building it. 😁😂😈
---
they should try to make games for the players and not for themselves
---
seems like they are cake eaters from DC with issues imo
---
If only we could use a team members artillery installation if were nearby. Four people in a team can use blueprints and camps to strategically place artillery sites to bombard enemies. I currently use orbital strike beacons and scans for my team, but how much fun would it be to use linked artillery?
---
Only carry around 10, anymore than that I vendor then just heal with food /drink
---
I just found a quad assaultron head and I'm still messing with it too see if it's actually more powerful. 20 fusion cells at once is just a tad ridiculous but god it's a terrible weapon otherwise. 
---
Hahaha no shit..yeah when I got that mod..I built a huge farm...when you harvested it it showed up in the duffle bags..but if you put the dufgke bags inti the machine it spat out individual nugs. Pretty dope lol
---
I know of quite a few people that got banned on Xbox for excessive item creation. I guess the issue at hand is the mule accounts they made as those did not get banned.  So you can spread your fake news shit but you are either a thirsty liar or ignorant.    
---
There is no essay and it was lit up for a little bit from dupers trying to say it was from making ammo and shit. YOu have to appeal and wait and given the 72 hour business day appeal time up from 24-48 hours I would say plenty got banned. 
---
If you capture the WS, you get a mission to repel the intruders. You do not have to be in the bubble to attack them, as long as they continue to contest the original "owner."
---
You can not strictly assume duper.Odds are duper yes but there are some like me out there that managed to steal a boat load of duped items.  I'm just glad I was able to destroy dupers with nukes before they got smart and moved to the green zone.   
---
To the victor goes the spoils.   
---
I've heard people say to put all your mats in stash.. see if that helps. 
---
I am thinking of making an arena for pvp fights, spectators can place bets on who will win
---
Is that the pyrolator or something like that, from fo4
---
Btw question: does having more artillery in a base have an impact when marking for artillery firing?
---
You think they'll ever put dreadlocks in the game? That's what I'd like.
---
I’m almost certain it will be. ESO was arguably a worse flop/launch and they are releasing another dlc soon, if they already haven’t. 
---
After level 60 - you should be able to return perk cards for a level up point. Usually after level 60 perk points really mean nothing anyways.
---
Is there an utracite paint job I’m missing, the shape looks good, but the mis-matched paint killed me   
---
Maybe try to have someone make the piece for you?
---
Would be kinda nice of Bethesda if they would actually comment on this and other stuff like it.
---
The main side quest (it runs side by side with main quests) and no one knows if its working or broken and the games coming up to 3 months old now :/
---
I wanna actually fucking play pool
---
Seriously like 3 of samecard trade for one new.  Or sell em for atom, anything really.
---
It's more confirmation of an already low expectations for me
---
I'll go with a Gatling plasma, I like my green pew pew!
---
I would be sad... Bethesda would have may as well made it free In the first place if they won't fix some of the glitches and bugs (Not a hate comment I love this game so much)
---
I think someone at Bethesda still has dreams of this becoming the new Battle Royale Gold Mine.
---
You're like a reverse MODOK
---
Yeah but i would feel bad if i would run around with duped stuff,  i dont even feel like buying a TSE weapon because  if i buy one its probably a duped one anyways. I rather find one myself. 
---
Where did you acquire these plans good sir? As a fellow sniper i have been searching for quite some time 
---
I'm lvl 175 but the only time I ever touch anyone's base is if they set it up with turrets behind Whitesprings clubhouse. That's just lame.
---
Heads up, you don't have to spend the resources to repair your camp. Just move your camp, even slightly, and everything will be in your places in your storage fully repaired.
---
A PSA from your friendly neighborhood raider. 
---
No its crap!
---
Its almost as if they were going to sell perk card packs on the store...if not why the heck are we opening packs? 
---
We need loud outs and / or passive and active perk placements.
---
No one cares about the odd animated card that they never look at, we care about ease of access and time it takes to switch our builds.
---
If they weren't planning on selling packs why introduce card packs and not just stick with the FO4 perk planner, hell the rest of the game is ripped off from FO4 assets so why would they have spent the time changing the perk system from one that worked well to this pack crap we have now?
---
The TSE weapons were broken, and the availability of them through duping and real-world sellers escalated the problem. I don't agree with jumping directly to the 75% Nerf for the two-shot, nor having the solution to the explosive be locked into perks so it is still an issue for low level players dealing with griefers, but I'm sure they will keep tweaking this.
---
The Bobblehead and Maggazine stacking is the bigger problem. But as my old boss loved to say to tax clients, pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered - yes, the duping of bobbleheads was causing a huge pvp issue but dupers are greedy. They amassed huge stacks of these items and are now getting banned for having these stacks.
---
Fuck bob
---
This would annoy me too, thankfully at level 130 I havent built a camp at all so it doesn't.
---
I'm really onboard for some sort of Legendary system for removing modifiers. My idea was a high cost removal and application of individual modifiers, but a reroll system would be sweet too.
---
It would give a lot more excitement and meaning to grinding legendaries.
---
But what about the tux hat? 
---
That could be legit, just watched the video and if so I would expect them to give some kind of refund or something more substantial than atoms. I bot the base edition personally and I'm kinda bummed to hear it would be going f2p but I'm willing to accept that the online stores are mysteriously going out of copies and eb games as well (we don't have eb here in the states) I'm not sure what the marketing aspect is in Australia but I do know that they have been notably having the lowest prices on the market for 76. I'm not 100% sure myself, I do know that Beth is talking about a pvp server and I recently watched a video of someone in a "Dev room" that seemed to be an extra part of the map that had no entrance or exit so I felt as though it was going to be a multi-player map similar to what cod uses. If this is the case I feel like they are going to have the pvp f2p or the game itself f2p but I feel like one of them is going to require cash to play. That would also deepen the plot with the "loot boxes" seeing as they will be along the same lines as what cod used to do for new skins etc. This is just a guess, I'm open to opinions on the f2p issue, i guess the post was just to show that someone out there took the time to call them and pry for answers. I hope other people will do the same. If enough of us ask Bethesda will have to give an answer one way or the other.
---
Nice share btw. Definetly interesting. 
---
Two shot will be removed in next patch and explosive side nerfed damage wise so I wouldn’t worry too much on it.  I did wonder if it existed though.
---
Bethesda can't help.  It may re-appear if you log out of game and log back in.  Items that have been pending trade will disappear sometimes if the item is offered and one player backs out while there is still an offer pending.  I've lost items when transferring to my own mule like this within the last week.  Typically they will reset on login but maybe you have to do this right away.
---
I didnt buy Fallout to play CoD 
---
i was tweaking a build trying to get this just right but i feel like i may be too squishy.  i did sacrifice for some sneak and i hate power armor so this is what i ended up with, input welcome.

p.s. i am at level 23 and have not picked a single card or placed a single point.  want it to be right lol
---
Just the look your going for and matching, I wear all t60 arms and legs and an x01 torso and helm and it works great, rarely ever have to repair, and when I do it’s super cheap. 
---
I believe the extra carry weight and mining ability of the excavator armor only works as a set( mining  as well even though it says you only need the matched arms, it doesn’t work unless you have the entire suit, including helmet on) , and in fallout 4 there where bonuses for matched armor sets, but I don’t believe that has transferred to fo76
---
FO76 included the BoS in a place really not next to California, just 25 years after the war. They would find a way to include something like that, it would be a challenge. But your reasons are absolutely right
---
I haven't tried launching myself since the patch because most of the lobbies I get in already have one going, I've had better luck server side than most apparently so I'm going to try and launch one today and see what happens. 
---
XB1
---
1000 caps? I'm actually a melee character but I like making nice things for low levels just starting out...
---
I’m so glad I joined this sub because with posts like this, and the posts about people actively trying to make the game worse post patch, I can see that I dodged a $60 bullet by not buying this game. 
---
No. He’s barely played. It let him log back in and create a new character. He had no emails or anything. 
---
Kind of like what r/place did on April fools but in fallout?
---
Which all lead to the same thing: we got killed by zombie-boys.
---
Wet.
---
I have an AA Explosive Assault Rifle id trade you but dont know when id be on next. Dont use it anymore cuz i got a tse handmade
---
Assuming you can’t get it back of course
---
That the one at the prison?   I think I've seen it once,  on a day that I was NOT server hopping and trying to get it to pop. 
---
It may be a simple error or an Easter egg, but intelligent deathclaws have been in fallout before and we do already have a supermutant trader, maybe we’ll see something in the future.
---
Have to drop them and move on.  The crappy part is many of the 2-3 star weapons you have had no choice but to drop, will soon be better than the TSE you were making room for.
---
Again people making claims but no actual evidence, not saying it didn't happen, but this is the internet. 
---
Ask your friends for the emails and proof of bans. Its weird with all these bans going around that there isn't 100's off posts / images showing them no?
---
That is a beautiful idea
---
Didn’t ask you
---
He didn’t even have any special items. Just regular loot items. He had only played for like 2 hours. 
---
That’s exactly what it is, and it’s really sad :(

At least the story expanded upon the lore

You can still carry a set of PA for situations like these or when you need to fast travel overburdened

Game crashed after firing 1 shot from my lvl 35, 2 shot handmade rifle at an assaultron that was invisible.
---
It was a boss, with the crown by its name, inside the sugar grove building while doing the "One of Us" quest. 
---
Wait, what? You become president by holding a spotlight? Did I read this right?
---
I've got a furious exploding Tesla. It loses the arcing effect, both functionally and graphically, which is disappointing. With the semi auto or charging barrels, it's meh, but the charging shotgun barrel, even without charging shots up, it 1-2 shots max level regular enemies. So far it's the most powerful gun I've found (other than a two shot black powder rifle, which still loses dps-wise). And the Tesla shotgun still uses rifle perks.
---
That assaultron date quest is kinda interesting, because it seems all of the assaultron's dialogue was already recorded.
---
Some examples: "[If only I could drink with you without damaging my circuits. You're so incredible, and I'm just a lowly assaultron](https://www.dropbox.com/s/scm7mzuft85txdx/Just_a_Lowly_Assaulttron.wav?dl=0)."
---
"[Just so you know, I'm fully functional. Fully!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o450mzbd8jq22rq/Fully_Functional.wav?dl=0)"
---
Far as I can tell, needs to be Scorched there, not anything else, before the nuke. Tested twice yesterday, two different servers, two different nukes. Mole Miners spawned Mole Miners. No legendaries. Ghouls spawned Scorched. 1 legendary ghoul by the power plant. Completely underwhelming. 
---
EDIT: my point is, this site is not consistent enough to be worth anyone's time. 
---
I would diffently contact Bethesda support then.
---
If any one had one on PC that they're looking to sell (for cheap). Let me know. Thanks. 
---
This will never happen for items that have previously been sold. 
---
People would lose their shit if they paid for something and then it became free - coporate suicide even for BGS.
---
It’s addressed the same way you address the wall of text on the right hand side of your screen.  You turn off any quests you aren’t doing currently.  It’s how you play rpgs with more than one thing to do at a time.  It’s the whole open world vs on rails experience.
---
Never said it was all people over level 100. I just stated that it's always people over level 100 that tend to make the game less enjoyable for others. 
---
I typically sell any over 30-40, there isn't a reason to have more than that.  I had moved 300 or so to my mule but stopped doing that as well.
---
I'm on PS4 and PC myself, not sure how XB1 works but you can rebuild database on the PS4 that can fix some issues like this.
---
Played DCUO and every once in a while my PS4 would forget my account and that would solve it, I'd guess there's a similar option on XB1 though.
---
Edit\* there have been a few instances of roll backs, never heard or seen one that took away a couple of hours of play but its is Bethesda and FO76 and unfortunately no matter how much everyone here loves the game it is a hot buggy mess. At least hes back on and playing again i guess :D
---
I wish we could just tell the game, "I promise I'll put some stairs there eventually"
---
Yeah I’m not a huge fan either. If this comes to fruition, you could play at a weird time of day with a friend and each unlock the paint.
---
Well yeah those players dont have a new goal so they kill time by destroying other peoples camps. As annoying it can be, its part of the game. Consider those griefers as raiders. 
---
100% this make sure all materials are either on you or in your stash not split between both. If not and your on PC give me a shout IL help
---
I have a friend like that. He keeps telling me the game is trash because he saw youtubers opinion on it and that he won't get into a game with only 32 players on a map. I don't even know how to explain him that the number of players on the map was never an issue with this game, that everything is a competition for resources so you want as fewer players on the map as possible. But he is also singleplayer story fanboy so it doesn't matter what i tell him, he won't play it because he wants the main story to be strictly about him. Threat him like he is the king of the world so he can feel special and guide him to the end with a strong hand-holding questline. Like spoon-feeding a child bednight stories. This type of people won't know the first thing of what to do in a sandbox survival game.

took a break for a week and just started to play again and now my game is lagging so bad its like stop motion animation, i cant even play, all drivers are up to date, every other game i have works flawless, hitman 2, RE2 remake demo , rust, league, wow no issues with any of those, just fallout 76. anyone else have similar issue?

I think the quest is on 'to be continued'

Anyone with the same issue that sees this-  Windowed was the answer. What a clusterfuck of a game

Could try cancelling it logging in and seeing if it actually needed to download or was just bugged out?
---
Dafuq are you on about? Why do you think there should be any real indicators of actual future contents purposefully hidden to be datamined in the first place?
---
Are you fucking legitimately raging over a fucking datamined texts of contents that are NOT supposed to be in the client yet? You fucking nuts?

Haven't been on in a couple of days, so hopefully it's a little better when I log in later tonight, but yeah it's been terrible for me.

Found a Tesla Coils at R&amp;G today,
---
Technically I found all this myself...it was just off of 3 dead players and a world stash they were using at that time. The others where I would run up and steal their shit from tents and things is slightly different, but that rush was so fun.   
---
Low quality bait.
---
Between the overseers camp and Flatwoods.
---
You don't have to waste resources to repair your camp. Just move your camp a couple inches and everything will be in storage fully repaired.
---
Same as train station.

You got a map location for that?

i crashed almost everytime i loaded in within the first 10 minutes. then someone mentioned the Targeting HUD was causing this issue and after i took that off, im getting my "normal" crashes back. so that seemed to fix the problem, at least the game is playable at this point
---
No I’m serious lol I seriously have yet to see a positive post about this game on this sub pop up on my feed. 
---
Every post I see is about how to deal with bugs, or how to deal with assholes. 
---
Except that works because Rust's Primary Philosophy is social group based PvP. Those structures will degrade over time, they will be attacked, they aren't meant to be *homes*, they're meant to be *forts*.
---
In 76, PvP is really only a second-hand thought, and most "groups" consist of 2-4 members on average - not a clan of 10+ like Rust. The game clearly doesn't want you to use "forts" (though you can, it makes most PvP incredibly dull and turtley.)
---
It's a completely different design philosophy. I don't think it would work.
---
It was a human talking to an AI you mean. So one human. And it wasnt a recording, it was happening live. You walk in on the mayor mere moments after she dies. But she was also recording it I guess.
---
Solid idea. This sub needs more of these.
---
I did this but it still wanted to download the whole game again.
---
Some plans are locked to specific vendors and not attainable via workshops so you will eventually have to buy some 
---
I heard those rumors but they were proven to be untrue. I feel like I missed something. I almost feel like there was a message before I bought the item. I’m running on less than 4 hours sleep though so it’s kinda fuzzy. 
---
Nothing like spending 24 hours at work saving and helping people to get home and have your favorite game piss on you. I was looking forward to having my coffee, turn on my game, get my trade, and play a little. I can’t believe this can happen. I had it favorited, does this mean nothing?
---
what level were you? still not a 100% if they are level locked
---
There was a mod for FO4 called do it yourshelf that let you put just decoration items on shelves. I would like something like that.
---
Fast travel to the overseers camp, get onto the road next to it and follow it south to flatwood. If you get attacked by mole rats you’ve gone too far.
---
People need to stop spending money on microtransactions for a game that was trash on launch. 
---
Good. Once PvP has actual game modes and real gameplay I'll bet they'll see active PvP mechanics in real battles and we'll be seeing balance hotfixes in no time. Multiplayer games never have an effectively balanced world PvP, it's always balanced around the events.
---
There's really no stopping the power of the stealth sniper, though. If you don't have an orbital scan beacon you're not finding them, then consider that most of them have a chameleon piece, even for level 10, and they're pretty much death incarnate.
---
You're reading way too much into it. The story is garbage.
---
I think i saw those in watoga, Vendor phoenix
---
I am not sure though 
---
My personal theory is buff till everything is desirable on its own niche and only nerf when one thing is the best in all niches, like 2 shot isn't the best but it is the jack of all trades. Technically if your willing to risk and build for it Bloodied is the best in all niches but it has the huge downside and high perk cost. Anti-armor is stronger than 2 shot on heavily armored targets like robots, scorch beasts and ye average super mutant. Quad is the best option on weapons like the harpoon gun, broadsider and revolvers (excluding single action nothing can make that thing good. powerful yes but not good).
---
Ranged vs melee, Melee is stronger it is why I am against the 2 shot nerf and a lot of the balance changes in legendary effects. Ranged just needs to be brought to par with Melee. (saying so I am not including the current Brokenly powerfull Explosive secondary effect, in its current state it should be a primary effect so it can not be a tag along with other powerful effects. the future nerfed one should be a valid secondary effect. The true balancing issue they are attempting to address will not be resolved until they fix duping)
---
As for the balancing of Int vs luck, my suggestion of effect chips and scraping found legendaries for them to build the gear you desire would take both into account. 
---
For Stealth Vs. non-stealth for the costs that stealth builds entail comparatively high perk cost, it is one reason I added the buff to instigating for it otherwise a stealth Bloodied build is the most powerful choice.
---
PA vs Armor, Armor needs a buff plus my proposed Hasmat modification to make it nuke Viable. At the moment the legendary effects can make armor semi-equivalent to Power armor but comparing ease of acquisition Power armor is VASTLY superior. Unless you include that legendary modification system I proposed.  Also the legendaries I buffed to allow for more diversity besides the meta, Vanguard/ Sentinal or cavalier (must have all 5 the same), Bolstering+unyielding/ sentinal or cavalier(2/3 and the secondary all the same for a Bloodied build) or Assassins/ Sentinal or Cavalier for PvP to stop being oneshotable. 
---
I also forgot to add a portion about how weak energy weapons are in FO76, thanks for the reminder. As for the stealth thing, I didn't know that and honestly, that should add a little weight to make energy weapons more powerful...  
---
As for balancing legendary vs Perks, they should be balanced so the potential of them together in all Viable builds have an expected outcome to have them all feel powerful and fun, but not one combination is obviously better in most situations. If anything does shine in such a way have the downside to match, for instance, bloodied is Always the most powerful option but to do so you need a lot of perks and you are always on the knife edge of survival.
---
I will attempt to address the new concerns at the addendum of my document which at this point could have been its own document...
---
Like that old show from the 80’s *Eight is Enough*
---
Success! I have seen this!
---
Practically impossible to acquire unless you buy them on reddit. I bought both of mine for 1000 caps.
---
Number of players seems to have an effect on a few events as well, Uranium Fever and Irrational Fear come to mind. During Irrational Fear with 3 people, I had 3 waves of 3 Honey Beasts and 3 Yao Guai spawn, but solo there was 3 waves of 1 Honey Beast.
---
Sweet, thanks. Its a random encounter spawn right? Not a group of them?
---
Did he log back into his Bethesda account?

Ah alright, is there any place to specifically find the plans for them, I'd like to have my T-51 legs back.
---
I was on around 1 hour ago. I didnt noticed any issues 
---
20k caps for it buddy lol
---
Ya. Bloody mess is a must for any build.

Or something... not messed with this gun the whole series that much
---

---
add me "amielh20". you need any help on your missions? 
---
Thank you for posting this. Im really worried about the presidential voting system as outlined by those notes. Seriously I dislike pvp to the enth degree in this game,  it's totally unbalanced for a myriad of reasons, and instead of fixing that they nerf a whole legendary modifier yet do nothing about the bobblehead exploit etc. 
---
It's also unnerving because in my opinion the best bit of story is the MODUS and enclave stuff. 
---
HAHAHA. Wait, what if there like, parasites? Like face huggers in the Alien movies? 
---
Never ever use except for the one quest with the training pistol

What kind of psycho joins the subreddit of a game they aren't interested in buying?

Using raider underarmor, unyielding (legendary effect that boosts stats at low health) shadowed and muffled overarmor pieces (which stack with each other) and agility boosting food will help you keep a high Agility score to stay undetected.  Sometimes enemies bump into me and don't see me.
---
Bethesda watch this:
---
 “Yea man! Let’s buy a share on one of the persistent private servers!”
---
Suddenly you have re-occurring income, and happy players, instead of playing mind-games to get whales to buy fruit-hats. 
---
I would totally pay to have a “dedicated server” that could either be owned by one person and invite-only or a “share” system with a group of players. Camps would stay persistent after building with “ move camp” just giving you the option to brings things with you, but leaving the majority of the base.  Things like workshops would persist after you log off, and other players on the server could use or add to them and the changes would be there when you got back, power plants would stay powered up, Appalachia would be rebuilt! 
---
Its a tough balance. If they keep tse weapons they lose players, if they get rid of them they lose players
---
I think they should nerf them but add in other endgame content as soon as possible. Then maybe everyones happy :)
---
PS4... think I have a quad one you can have lol
---
Store all you junk in your stash. 
---
Seems to be a bug currently that occasionally doesn’t count your inventory correctly. 
---
Also make sure you have scrapped all your junk.  
---
[Yep, I built myself a train station, too a couple weeks ago.](https://imgur.com/a/rsilw5q)

I changed it to brick recently and added the retro fireplace, but it's mostly the same as in this album
---
Yeah, I'd be interested; I'm level 31, a stealth build, and fed up with being a farming target for higher levels. My game name is BlagoBuster, am mostly playing in the evening (European time zone). Please look me up!
---
I got 3k Caps bro. Nothing of real substance to trade but you are welcome to take a look.
---
They are nerfing 2 shot so Anti Armor is better now. So that’s a very good AR you have. Just want to let you know. I wouldn’t want you to trade potentially your best gun to help me out 
---
Lol dude I joined this sub to see what the actual players are talking about when it comes to the game. I was hoping to see the posts get more positive but I have been sorely disappointed. I was really hoping to have my mind changed because I *was* and actually still am interested in buying the game.
---
Its a bug,  i have that with crafting ammo aswell. 
---
Well, the quest that you need to do to become the president literally tells you "Warning! You're going to be in PvP!" when you start, so, yeah.... I've got bad news.
---
There's also [another datamine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbortvX4lbLW2iX0OFPHf8cdjUUQINDWDoYWiHL-080/edit) I've seen that interprets a bit more of the info:
---
&gt;You must then ensure you ‘control’ the voting at Summersville, Grafton, Berkley Springs, Helvetia, Harpers Ferry, Lewisburg and Watoga. The player controlling most votes at these stations receives an ‘endorsement’ which can be collected from you like junk if you die. Once all ballots are finalised, the player with most endorsements becomes ‘president’ which allows them to access the dispenser for Presidential Seals ‘By activating this dispenser, you do solemnly swear that you will faithfully execute the Office of ... PRESIDENT. OF. THE. UNITED. STATES…’. Presidential Seals are used in exchange for unique items in the Executive Suite at the Enclave bunker.
---
1. PC - Legendary Super Mutants with no star will always yell "Retreat!" and run away. They will never fire a single shot so far as I can tell. Also, legendary ghouls seem to be constantly dropping no loot.
---
Ha, thanks for pointing that out. 
---
Get more screws and it will work
---
Yes!! I have so many magazines that I don’t need!! I’ve even stuck a few in the overseers cache and a suitcase at a train station just to get rid of the weight and hopefully someone else that could use it found it. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Should have been in the game in the first place. Why let us rearrange for free but limit us to having to swap one card at a time?
---
Ign ArcherJG, I play evenings/nights Mountain Time USA
---
The perk system is a an attempt at compromise.  You dont want to punish people who take crafting perks over combat damage perks in a pvp environment.  So you get to swap them as appropriate.   The inconvenience of swapping them is part of the syste.  Also, every online game has weapons that go through buff/nerf style and it would be infuriating to spend permanent perks on automatic rifles, for example, and then they get nerfed.
---
Like a few systems in this game, the intent was solid but the execution experienced problems with live players.  
---
If I were to resign it right now, I'd continue to use the same card system, but all the cards would be about damage, resistances, sneak, or weight reduction.  Crafting, gathering, hacking (terminals, not robots), lockpicking, etc. would be permanent skills you find in books leaving the magazine system in place.  I'm not sure if those would be in permanent or random locations but they would be instanced so everyone in a party could grab it.
---
Perk swaps would be restricted to Vault 76, the Train stations, or your Camp.  Also, I would limit the amount of card you could have active per stat to your current Intelligence, so that mutations that lower your int would be more balanced, but you could keep chewing Mentats to stay smart enough to keep them active.
---
Me too. Is your camp under the bridge by harper’s ferry?
---
Being advertised as a multi player coop PVE with opt in PvP I'll be fucked off if content is locked behind PvP. 
---
No PA unarmed build. I have 34 between super normal, and diluted. I go through so many every session; easily 20 or 30.
---
Honestly, dunno how those guys can take advantage of duping and still have fun.
---
Personally, i used the carry weight glitch some days, until i knew it caused server problems, and i used the exp glitch with the traps for like 3 minutes before realizing it was the worst thing i could do if i wanted the game to remain fun for long time.
---
And if i accidentally duped something i would've just dropped it all on an empty area. Really don't see the point in exploits on this game.
---
Edit: Also i NEVER bought anything from a duper, or anyone else for that matter. Best things are the ones you get by yourself :)
---
Maybe when you nuke a certain location it forces her and her massive brood above ground. Worker ants heal her, she spawns more ants herself, spits acid and is extremely deadly in melee from the front, but is mostly immobile.
---
No, it doesn't. Not this way. Serums still work.
---
I could see that President event working quite well as a PvE event. I'm not against PvP as such, I just don't have a lot of interest in it as I prefer cooperative rather than competitive play. As things stand though, there's a lot of other stuff they'd need to get balanced and sorted before worrying about actual PvP events of that type.
---
In the current state of Fallout 76, the only way I could see an event of that type working on PvP would be if all legendary effects, mutations etc are supressed within whatever arena it takes place to level the playing field between players. Even with the upcoming changes to 2-shot and explosive weapons, I doubt many characters would last long against a barrage of fire from an explosive 50cal heavy.
---
Don't need to see shit when they got in party and started bitching they couldn't load. You can choose to believe or not, but it happened and if you bothered even searching on this reddit you would see images of emails showing the indefinite suspensions.   
---
I also do know "light" dupers there were not hit, or people that quit dupeing the day the PC patch hit and they didn't get banned. It seems to have only hit players between the PC patch and the Console patch that were duping excessively. One guy I know duped into the millions still up until a few hours before the console patch dropped and when he got in party then booted up the game he got the error code and sure enough banned also.   
---
So dupers got banned but mules and items did not so not much changed other than there is now a finite albeit millions of items still around.   
---
One other duper who was doing it for his friends but didn't have a second account is banned and he is raging at people since he has no fall back to play on. Only had him in xbox party 3 times.  Total on my list of FO76 friends that got banned is 9 out of 57.  A few I didn't even know were dupers until the sheepishly told me.   
---
Also why would they post something showing they did wrong to just be attacked?    
---
I’m the IRL Puppet face and Cheswick is my IRL cat lol a friend of mine who works for Bethesda put us in the game. Cheswick was originally alive (like in the BETA) but he kept glitching so they had to make him a dead kitty :( he got killed by the scorched but didn’t go down without a fight !!  You can find my body (a raider corpse) near the bottom of a mountain by flatwoods, not too far from wixon homestead. The body is face down and has a couple of dead wild mongrels by it. I’m equipped with a frag grenade and near by is a Chinese officers sword (my favorite weapons from fallout 4, once you mod the sword up it’s awesome! )  it is sad that we all died, but now you know there aren’t evil people just going through killing Cheswick.  He would totally be my companion during the apocalypse but right now he’s just napping :) [photo of Cheswick on my Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/p/BszWeckAo6D/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1wfc955we56hx)

Content possibly locked behind PvP. No factions, no dungeonesque Vaults.... 
---
Try moving the little camp gizmo somewhere else within the green circle of the camp. I think it effects where you spawn
---
* sobs* *scratches chin* Maybe they will make sure to correct pvp and balance weapons and armor traits first!.
---
Phoenix the vendor bot from BoS Watoga. It could also drop on the random plans that show up occasionally at PA mod plan spawn points like Big Bend Tunnel East, Survey Camp Alpha, Firebase Major etc. but the chances are extremely low.
---
Putting junk in stash worked. Thank you very much, it is appreciated!!
---
Only visible to people on your team. You wouldn't see it.
---
From the mainline quest you get a free set. :)
---
Yea you gotta treat these incidents like road rage. If it’s to the point where they’re pm’ing you nasty stuff you gotta block them for session. Don’t want to lead them back to your house.
---
to add insult on top.of insult the entire dmv portion reset after the server disconnected.
---
NICE
---
You got duped.  That  was not his camp but someone else's he was holing up in to trick people.  Was one of the first Raider strategies developed.  You ARE allowed to wreck a wanted person's camp without bounty.  Only other explanation is you shot more than what was needed to kill him and you hit his camp after the bounty was lifted.
---
100%down for this 
---
Thank you for the tip but most people don't know that so they end up wasting resources. 
---
About 3.50
---
Some people enjoy the game and have stuck with it since launch, you know. Just because tons of youtubers have bad opinions on it doesn't mean that everyone's opinion is.
---
Yes but we are wasteland heathens, so whitesprings it is. 
---
My buddy read it as "Whispering Springs" for some goddamn reason (I'm blaming the electric lettuce), and now he continues to say it just to piss me off. LOL
---
After completing Belly of the Beast BoS quest you are awarded a full set.
---
Raider life is real and this just adds realism of the wastes to the game..I currently use a trap base and have killed 15 players so far and my base takes little to no dmg
---
camden park. 
---
the FO4 explosive perk only gave +15 damage -- even post nerf, explosive perk in particular is head and shoulders above what it used to be
---
I see lordwolfs point; explosive was inarguably best in slot, but two shot really wasnt -- a lot of to most of the number hunting tryhards had already shifted to stacking bloodied/nerd rage/adrenal reaction over two shot. The nerf to 2 shot may be a little excessive.
---
That's not how it was working for me.  They weren't able to die.  It was like they turned completely pacifist.
---
Exactly. I wouldn't mind some type of balance at the absolute high end, but even that would be arguable, because like you say, it is a min-maxed build at that point with lots of trade-offs. 
---
I think a lot of people look at melee and think it is over powered because it is probably the only path that is close to being properly balanced in the game right now and it works consistently well for those who choose to invest in it properly. 
---
And that changes my point that they just need to get rid of stacking bobblehead effects in..what way? Even easier then if you dont need to change magazines too!
---
Caps fell through for the NCR when they brought back the gold standard, until the BoS nuked their reserves. This is kind of playing out in real life with actual money.
---
Wait until Bethesda actually nukes the dupers
---
it's awesome for SQ
---
I feel you. I think PvP could be great but at the moment there is little to no skill involved because there are no unique ways to specialize a PvP build virtually no gameplay mechanics. PvP right now is: Do you have Assassin's armor? Have you purchased the best gun? Do you have the appropriate gun perks slotted? Have you consumed bobbleheads/chems? Great, then shoot first and you'll win.
---
Ring was in the vault when I found mines in BETA
---
Scorchbeast dr is bugged since beta, if you are lucky you can overcome her with a lot of people + weapons ( not necessarely tse) when she have the dr bug unless u have a full squadron of tse spam it's not doable in time
---
This is really well done.  PS/Xbox/PC?  I'd love to visit.
---
I just told you I downvoted you and why, since you mentioned it.
---
&gt; If you want to have a meaningful conversation about why you think I’m incorrect I’m all ears.
---
Not really, but I will add the following. I downvoted because you talked two shots and explosives as separate like either on their own was breaking anything.
---
Seems pointless who is he going to lure in with a 25 cap bounty I only shot him because I was passing anyway surely nobody would go out of their way to track down and kill someone for 25 caps. If that is the case and it wasn't his I would imagine it was just a coincidence that he was there when I came across him.
---
2,000 lbs. of junk to you may weigh a fraction of that to him, based on perks and armor mods.
---
Yeah, he's dumb for lugging that stuff around, but if your decision to return the items is predicated solely on "he's a duper" by virtue of junk carry weight, well. Nope. Return it.
---
Turns out it is the rank 2 armorer perk.  My teammates upgraded and were able to craft without using ballistic anymore.  
---
I've more than got my money's worth out of the game at level 316.  Kinda leery about the incoming nerfs though and there really is not much in the ways of end game content once you have farmed up the weapons and armor you want aside raiding or interacting with other players in various ways.  
---
Who then?
---
Gourmand town!

I'm on the PS4. You're more than welcome to come visit!

Could be the radiation you get when some enemies hit you because I think rad resistance stops after a point. I mean I use just a suit and no extra resistance and use maybe 20 or so rad away by the time I've got enough loot that it's making my back break
---
White springs is more of an end game area my guy. Shit can spawn between level 30 to level 60.
---
+Karma
---
You thought correct. 
---
Yes, thanks for correcting. And it felt great probably because that's the dead person we miss by the shortest amount of time. 
---
Ive found him all the way by AMS near the power armor before. He can wander far. Just server hop.
---
It happens every week on the Creation Club and they are doing just fine. 
---
Couldn't of said it better myself!.
---
Think of a workshop as “king of the hill” because it is, and the rewards are the junk extractors. Workshops are specifically FOR pvp first and the items extractors are a bonus. If you take one you open yourself to the risk of someone coming to kill you. As I’m sure you noticed you can get lucky 90% of the time and no one will challenge you for it but it’s always on the table especially at sought after ones like munitions factory.
---
1 - I think you underestimate just how petty people can be.
---
2 - Low bounties are actually some of the best to go after since they are typically accidental.  Accidental bounties are often people who are carrying a large amount of junk and did not intend to open themselves up to PVP.
---
Could work. Coming from Assassin's Creed series to this, I also miss the ability to level up weapons and gear. In AC you'd often find a weapon that just *works* for you - you like how it looks, you like how it feels, the bonuses are amazing for your playstyle. It's just an overall great weapon. But it's lvl 5. By lvl 10-15, it would be completely obsolete and noncompetitive. But in AC, you can upgrade items up to your level. It's a little annoying, because you try to hold off as long as you can not to waste too many materials on it, but it's such an amazing thing.
---
The corollary of this is also that a high level player can still go to low level areas, and play with their lower level friends, and not end up with useless loot. If you got a lvl 15 TSE, you'd be able to just level it up to lvl 50, and use it. It would cost quite a bit in resources, but it's a nice option to have. And this is absolutely *trivial* to implement, using current crafting/modding system already in the game.
---
As happy as you are someone else is going to be 10 times as pissed when they realize they dropped it.

won't happen and won't help. economy is polluted with enough stuff now where people won't trade for caps. Need money sinks.
---
I like the idea about building a city that then becomes a permanent part of the game. That would also be a great way for them to eventually phase in NPC’s. as in rebuilding the cities will bring the people back. 
---
&gt;  It loses the arcing effect
---
The exploding Tesla is not longer a Tesla rifle? That kind of sucks :/ 
---
You are not supposed to, but same can be said of flamers but as you can see they exist...
---
I’m 100% sure it’s bugged...
---
I have a TwoShotExplosive Fatman and another TwoShot Fatman with +50% VATS Crit  damage.. 
---
I don’t really understand the explosive fat man..  
---
I Think all ranged weapons can get all legendary “mutations” it’s just about luck getting the right weapon with the right effect 
---
Agree.   Each set should be useful in certain parts of the game.
---
I may have missed this in the sheet or the thread, but when the chance is "none", what does that mean? I see there is a dense mod for trapper torsos with a chance of "none" and I wasnt sure how to interpret that.
---
Because you are spreading false information. You don't see that? Spreading false rumors is not helping this game. Edit your shit ***MAGAZINES DO NOT STACK***
---
I think I remember reading that there is a house that you can build your camp within it south of Charleston Fire Department but for all the other houses/landmarks, you can't usually build near them. It's better to just run around with your camp menu on to see if it gives you the green light to build. You'll be surprised how close you can get it.
---
Also, it's also important to take notice if the landmark you want to be close to spawns enemies because that will become rather annoying in the long run too.
---
Flamers are busted.  Their condition depletes laughably fast and the ammo is impossible to make enough to make it a "main" weapon.  I hope they fix it at some point.  I am still salty about it because that is originally wanted I wanted to build when I heard the game was coming out.
---
I call it the high level asshole society
---
Yeah, because that is so easy to implement...
---
The Chinese do need more robots
---
But why would the want me to have a bounty, I'd understand if they wanted to then shoot me from a distance and kill me without having time to retaliate and claim my junk and take my caps  but they didn't I asked a random player the next day to kill me to get rid of it.
---
Nuke the population centers:
---
Whitesprings
---
Charleston
---
Morgantown
---
In my experience, guaranteed ghouls. Kinda sucky for flora.
---
I have not tested Wavy Willard's. It's usually full of Scorched and 'Lurks, so maybe?
---
Stay in the forest and toxic valley for a while
---
Its pretty bad, only worse is explosives where you are literally shooting the enemy with springs and screws depending on what you are using.
---
Yeah, no one just drops that bit of gear out of the kindness of their heart. 
---
Just give us gambling,  that would be great fun.
---
Why and how did I not know this? I've done it 4 times... lmfaoooooooo
---
I've enjoyed it alot been playing sense the beta. 
---
Some one is definitely going to be heartbroken.
---
I dont think so, but maybe. I know the Harppers Ferry vendor has the brick wall plans, and other ones. Often the Watoga vendor has good stuff too. Just take a look at notes when on a selling run. 
---
You could have tagged him them :D u/lonevaultwanderer
---
Well said, this is a continuing source of irritation for me in the party I play with. They regularly, and seemingly unknowingly, add the 's' each time they name The Whitespring as "Whitesprings." It's a barbaric attempt to shorten the name.
---
Man those staggered foundations down the hill are beautiful. Very nicely done!
---
I actually don't keep a track of where and when I get a plan. I've just played the game and I get plans and I've even dumped my plans in the Overseer's stash box in Flatwoods because I've gathered so much just by playing the game. Ofcourse, in my opinion it's better just to buy the plans sold from vendors because I have no clue where else to get them. The lockers sold in via the BoS bot Phoenix in Watoga is different from the lockers sold by the Free States bot in Harper's Ferry. Here is a [link](https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl?fbclid=IwAR2wwW9a9L4XDKJeGMIogHNb7KliUar9a6YftuFAuhOen3LbdTTmtNAlQdU) to what the plans look like made by another amazing redditor (patitogigante?).
---
I've also had trouble crafting certain things sometimes. Try using a PA station.
---
Have to say this looks really cool
---
I haven't completed it yet, but I imagine it pops up with the quest completion icon where it shows most, but not all of the rewards you received.
---
I may have been a little hyperbolic as I have not done absolutely all of the math. My point was that melee is balanced well enough that even a small nerf could adversely affect it's viability. The repair costs are also a very good point, my goodness do I repair constantly with my pure melee character. 
---
It just come up as power armor frame when you complete the quest. Doesnt tell you jack all whats in it. Same for the rose quest when you get a raider kit. 
---
You see Joseph always wanted to be a traveling meechant, but he had a deep burning secret inside. He was a furry.
---
After many days he finally did it, he built a full body suit. Sadly, he was so good at his craft that from a distance he looked like a real one. One BoS patrol later and that ends the story of Joseph the furry.
---
I have had this happen trying to do Top of the World ... which is not end game, to my knowledge. I am level 23. I had level 63 (I think) scorched spawning. Not fun. 
---
Nice to know, thank you!
---
yep that was the idea. give some bosses abilities that make otherwise low value perk cards uses. 
---
does the mongrel defend your base?
---
BEAVERQUEST
---
I genuinely had no idea lol Suppose I've never had an actual PA build, the only armour I carry is excavators and that's something you actively get so that explains why it's gone under my radar.
---
I've done it a few times so I'm surprised I've not seen the notification at least once.
---
The majority? Really? I would love to see the evidence you use for self-justification  
---
If you are not running with friends there is not a lot of point to holding onto mid-grade weapons.  90% of my "this doesn't suck" legendaries go to my friend's alts.  The other 10% I am playing around with depending on ammo stock.
---
Making a new build is fine but you should only be holding onto top tier off-build items.
---
Attacked....lol on reddit!
---
If there as bad a dupers as you say i very much doubt they care about some random redditors telling them there naughty for duping....you know just like the 100's of you tubers that were duping and twitcher's that were doing it live (and still are right now btw).
---
The duping is still going on right now, and only a hand full of people have verified they've been banned because of it. The servers haven't got any better (yes that could just be the new patch messing more stuff up).
---
And i have seen one or two accounts claiming to be banned here on reddit, however they mostly turn out to be fresh accounts / throw away's and not 1 of them has posted proof to verify it. 
---
Hopefully there will be people on LFG looking to do it. My one friend left that plays 76 refused to boost Field Medic with me, saying I should do it legit. I was helping him finish some quests he goes down with me right there. Rather than let me stimpack him, knowing I need it for the achievement, he gave up and respawned. I asked him WTF you knew I needed that and he replied, this is "just faster this way". Then he wanted me to watch his loot until he made it back. I just left the party and logged off. We haven't played together since. 
---
Or like what Overwatch does where you get a gift each event and a item for every event you participate in.
---
I have a question for people like OP who are always complaining about “griefers.”  I have played for hundreds of hours, level 140 and have never been griefed and base has never been destroyed.   Are the people whose base keeps getting destroyed in the most common base spots I imagine?  That has to be it right ?  
---
yeah got it there
---
You have to keep in mind, though, that to do damage as a melee character, you are fully exposing yourself to damage. For trash mobs, this seems inconsequential, but for the really dangerous mobs like a pack of mirelurk kings or a squad of AP Mister Gutsys, you really need every bit of that armor piercing otherwise you will have to retreat too often to be useful. 
---
You arent allowed to read my drunk posts!!!
---
IMAO this camo is a little too clean and bright. I doesnt fit to ingame post-apo and to in-game clothing and armors. I think its a bit disappointing...
---
Great idea for continuing content in a multiplayer game. Sadly this game lacks basic functionality for collaboration such as server chat or server lists. Yes this would be fun, but if you can organize the people needed for that you could have fun in any multiplayer. Let's be honest the most fun you can have in 76 is the absurd moments you share with friends. 
---
I do the same thing or bring another player over and we destroy the entire camp. It's the only time I ever destroy a camp or attack a random player.
---
Bobbles are 75 caps explosive and leader are 100. Mags are 115 Unstoppables are 150! 
---
You spent so much time trying to figure out if you *could* do it, you never stopped to think whether you *should.*
---
I’ve experienced the same thing. I’ve noticed that most of the time most junk doesn’t come back after a server hop. Im starting to think it is personalized as opposed to server based.
---
My theory for this was while I was doing MHS for plastic, my son joined me on the second jump. I had next to nothing to pick up. However he could pick up stuff I could not see. We were laying side by side so I could see what his screen showed.
---
I think junk is on a separate refresh timer from vendors. Something close to 30 hours instead of 20 like for vendors.
---
It is a glitch that is actually beneficial lol shhh
---
Well, I live in the asshole capital of the world. Illinois. Too of the people here are total douche bags. 
---
He says how it shouldn’t do exactly that in the second paragraph 
---
Toxic area up north is 15 to 25ish, southern ash area is 15 ton35 I think. Best to hang there until you hit a level range better suited to accidental high level people resetting spawns on you. I was mobbed by 60s in white springs my first trip there. 
---
Yea I wasnt using power armor at all and still had a crazy number of crashes. 
---
I’ve done it twice so far, I believe you have to activate the start in tv university on a terminal each time you want to start the quest...
---
Quite possible, but I am leaning toward it being unlikely for a couple of reasons. First, it was dropped in the middle of the parking lot - the most conspicuous location at The Whitespring Station. Second - it wasn't worn recently as it had to have come directly from someone's stash as it was Blackbird painted. The only  way to drop Atom Store painted PA is to store it first to eliminate the Atom mark that prevents dropping.
---
That's on them then, ignorance isn't an excuse unfortunately.
---
Thanks it was white springs so tons of glowing ghouls lol 
---
hey I'm level 9 add me : Silent_Boss_7 
---
The flashing lights for the train station is a great idea. I'll be seeing if I can get that join with a terminal when I log in tonight. And there's alot of things to try with camp building and I hope Bethesda puts in more time with adding in more items to make at even better experience. I'll be sticking with this train station for a few days or weeks or until I get the bug to try out a new challenge. Thank you for the suggestions and I'll be sure to have another post about what I've built again. Thank you for the great comment!
---
Do you have any of the perks that add damage to aimed fire? (I think they still exist right?) There's a distinction between manually aimed and VATS aimed
---
Most people call it nuketown. 
---
Around the statehouse/dmv area. Other than that, I just randomly run across them.
---
I didn't know flamers shot bullets. 
---
There are always 4 mongrels at the cabin south east of vault 76 or northeast of the wood mill, I think it is called the isolated cabin. Consistent every time, not sure what makes them tameable

Taking a screenshot of a screenshot is dumb.. the photos should be saved somewhere on the xbox.  Now you are just making doubles of an already saved"photo"

yes! i'd love to come check yours out! i don't use a mic; do you use the chat mod or a discord we can coordinate on?
---
I'm a relatively active trader and mostly trade item-for-item so I definitely agree with you but caps are still good to offset value differences
---
The best sneak armor is shadowed leather with muffled on the legs. Maybe wood. Havnt really messed with that. 
---
Link?
---
It does I have a video on my profile showing it in action. 
---
How much ammo per plan?
---
Yeah I’ve been having issues the past two days on PS4. Even at the beginning I didn’t run into it this much, getting kicked about once an hour now.
---
Speak for yourself not "everyone".
---
This isn't by far the worst release, it just fell afoul of a social media hate storm.  In my crowd everyone that played it was mostly content.
---
Ehh whatever helps you sleep better at night. Just know there has been bans and the email states excessive item creation and indefinite suspension. I guess that is not the same as saying banned outright but it is the same thing. You are just fishing now though it seems. 
---
Psn mjesticbattlecat add me, give me a shout if you get stuck with anything or need help 👍

When ever I swap heavy weapons, the loaded ammo is equal to the number of ammo I have in total, regardless of previous reloading (as how other weapons function).
---
Is this a bug? Or are heavy weapons supposed to work like that, like as a debuff? I can't find anyone else reporting this with some cursory searches.
---
n/a, but I may submit one
---
If you haven't destroyed them I hope you get banned. :)

My main is holding at “I am become death”.  I am waiting on my brother and a close friend to finish the main quest.

No needs outside of wanting a interactive group that aren’t out to kill/cheat/steal.  I will also happily help with any and all quest objectives.  I very much enjoy the team dynamics.  
---
I live on the West coast.  Pacific Time.  I work 12s and have a couple kids, so play very chaotic times.  I am always looking for a few more folks who just want a clean play experience and some quality fun times.  
---
Whitesprings, the ghouls drop plenty. Also check the parking lot, there is a laundry building with lots of abraxo.
---
I believe that’s my mates power armor he was going to give it to me, because he accidentally misplaced my T-50 pieces and then we both got Disconnected.. soo we lost it
---
Yes! Glad someone finally said it. Was driving me nuts!!
---
Could just make the president of the enclave earned through commendations, faction PvP, and Enclave events. Takes 20 coms to be put in the race. Could make it random choce at that point. That way if you wanna truly be president server hop and bust you but for the Enclave. Same could be done for the Brotherhood but instead you need to achieve ranks (which would be permanent outside the top 3 (dont remember) making them exclusive (high elder the most). There could be diverse ways of becoming faction leaders of all the factions
---
Thanks I'll check it out!
---
Perception does nothing for scoped shooting. Only VATS. 
---
I’m on mobile, and I’m not sure how to find it. How exactly would I go about doing that?
---
Minimum of 100 per plan. 
---
You can also do it as soon as you log in. Use your pip boy after loading into a server and you get stuck. You can see everything because the pop boy is invisible but cannot move or anything. 
---
Platform? I can build them if on xbox for trades
---
Yeah we rebels "whitesprings" 4L
---
Lol pretty hard to stealth on a post with spotlights
---
Dunno, offhand I can't recall a game with power scaling that didn't get burned for shared stats.  There just isn't a clean way I've ever seen to deal with it.
---
i’m on xbox too, depends how much it’ll be for them cause i kinda feel like just finding them myself 
---
A trade. Are you on Xbox?
---
Edit: obviously you aren’t sry
---
Start at isolated cabin - head to slocum joes - then to Sutton there should be 4-5 bushes along the way. 
---
Thats funny, we call you "salty little asshole who cant turn on pacfist"
---
The last past introduced that.
---
Gotta wait for stuff to load now
---
I love being able to move around and still use VATS.

Any number of times

It's was a joke.. I could care less either way

Schrute Farms! I remember reading this a few days ago, very nice camp there! Maybe I'll call in for a room!
---
second crash trying to finish this stupid fetch quest
---
this game is awesome,great job B
---
Same, is all G. Love love love love love lol kisses
---
This game won't make it through the year, why are you all wasting time crafting fantastic ideas that they'll never use?
---
The writing is on the wall, Bethesda doesn't give a shit.
---
Ik, i am checking everytime i get on
---
Never mind I figured it out [Merchants Guild](https://discord.gg/XNhEnX6) 
---
Before the patch, I would have 1-2 crash to desktop a night with the occasional no crash nights. Post update It has become 3+ minimum... It has encouraged me to do fewer nukes and no workshops. I nabbed Revo uninstaller Wheeldog recommended and I hope that resolves my issue. Thanks for the post.
---
I sure hope so. It's ridiculous the handmade rifle plans are only available for such a short time at those low levels. I can understand plans being locked behind factions or rep but not levels.
---
I'm on the border of the mire in cranberrybog in the middle of a forest. No way somebody would destroy my base because theirs is where mine was at.
---
When was that ever once stated? I even reread the whole OP. Besides, is someone supposedly from the Order of Mysteries really shitting on a stealth build? That's your ENTIRE bread and butter. 
---
Edit: re-autocorrect the spelling of my cursing. 
---
Psn: paulofg1980

In the game rn.
---
I can take you to a whitesprings tour.
---
Awesome! Gonna find some for the wife and I!
---
I can get copies of the emails, I have seen several banned for excessive item creation. 
---
I think sometimes it will actually put u back in the server you were back in..if you are on console just  do a full restart 
---
So the last overseers holo tape indicates she saw you launch the last nuke.
---
She's alive and her journey isn't complete.
---
Or its a bug.

Imo its obvious the quest isn't complete yet
---
I have a furious exploding assaultron head
---
Fishing?

Nah just want to see actual proof that Bethesda are doing what they say they are as they have been known to treat there customers badly in the past :)
---
Not sure why you take it personally but whatever 
---
 Wallace had em' yesterday. I was there and a high level and really high level show up. I'm third in the queue so I go on the roof to guard the area. The higher level guy waiting is seriously stealthy and bored I guess drops a grenade and jumps up on the roof too. I can see him and point my exploder at him, but I'm laughing so hard at the other guy's confusion I just give him a thumbs up.
---

---
yeah, I've run the numbers and that's not gonna cut it, even with my c.a.m.p. on a fourth. Optimally  I am looking for a large number of these listed above. Should allow me to collect them, relog or server hop and collect more. 
---
This list is from the Gamepedia, with all the animal parts removed. I am hoping not to have to fight much for the resources.
---
Np! 
---
I think so, pretty much one shot everything in sneak and almost one shot it without, using instigating knuckles. 
---
At level 25 you can start a quest that gives you the plans for the excavator set.
---
Thanks, I'll check the laundry!
---
Raiders in this sub be like.. *Yeah, right on like minded brother...*
---
Post 1 raider ign, whole band of raiders hop in by joining friend. 
---
Yeah this
---
Any possible spawn point for power armor chassis will come with a small random assortment of parts.
---
You can transfer them off of that chassis and into your inventory to put onto your own.
---
Specifically where? I cant think of any off the top of my head tho. :/ 
---
Just pick up your CAMP, move it 2 inches, place it back down. Your base will have been blueprinted and you can pop it back down with no cost of materials. Assholes are in every demographic, but you can alwayd just dc and block straight away if you dont wish to engage in pvp
---
Dude same here! I've been after it since launch. I check multiple times everyday on both vendors and nothing :(. 
---
I usually have the same issue on roses quest chain when stealing from the raider camp.
---
2/2 on my characters
---
Search around any of the places where you found PA frames originally. They respawn with different pieces. Also, when you're level 25 you can start the Miner Miracles quest which gets you the extremely helpful Excavator PA (you have to craft it and getting the junk together to craft it can take a while though). Head to the Ash Heap and keep an eye out for advertising posters 
---
&gt; Two shot will be removed in next patch 
---
I’m listening...lol
---
Picked up grognaks axe and a two shot assaultron at 'whitesprings' 
---
Not sure about world items but you can server hop spawns that carry the junk you need. Yao guai for springs for instance
---
White Springs 4lyfe fucko.
---
I always just assumed the merchant was inside the deathclaw's stomach. Presumably, he was delicious.
---
Would be nice as well as helpful if Bethesda would actually give us a list of acknowledged bugs and which ones are being worked on and which ones are being pushed further down the list etc.
---
Its not asking for much, but it does seem to be a little bit more than Bethesda can handle :/
---
I update Ultima always. 
---
One violent night = 8 crazy nights
---
This happens to me occasionally. Some players are completely invisible. 
---
Scenario: i see a white dot on my map and I'm like "hum someones nearby, wonder if they'll say hi" as i equip my AAE shotgun. 
---
A few minutes pass and i see the dot on me but dont see the player. Then out of no where excavator armor spawns, opens up, then despawns.
---
Visibly confused i let out a "what the fuck" and then hear a "what" back. Even more confused i asked "YOUR IN MY BASE??" he interpreted it as i was angry and simply replied "yeah dude your door let me in." After standing there looking at nothing i commented back "no dude you don't get it your invisible i can't see you at all." After that we talked and he was a pretty chill dude. I then logged off.
---
Sometimes some ppl just go invisible, dude was a lvl 84 checking out my cliff base, i doubt he was cheating. 
---
I’ll do that but might need ya to come to me lol I’m over encumbered with all the ones I have 
---
Stock levels?
---
Sure do. Just got my instigating lever action fitted with a suppressor last night. 
---
With barely any rifle perks it one shots level 68 scorch and level 60+ super mutants.
---
Nope, we will just play another game and let 76 die a slow painful death. 
---
Definiteley not, I changed servers 3 different times, same junk I left but different players on the server each time.
---
I have gotten both marine wetsuit armor plans from her on separate occasions. 
---
I'm working on something similar with acid. I'll have to see how that works.
---
Only if the person leaves the server. I've seen bags stay a long time for the team.
---
Cool, I need to find the plans.  What is the range like?
---
Everything in the Australian version is upside down!
---
Lol hit me up with the add. I'll be happy to wander. I have all you will need at camp too
---
Hmm that's wierd what are u playing on
---
There's at least three down near the Nuka-Cola area, look at Silva Homestead, Lewis &amp; Sons Farming Supply, and inside the Cola plant near Lewis &amp; Sons. You can also server hop in that area and repeat.
---
I start vendoring them when I get close to 100.
---
mountain momma!
---
Im not married but im gonna take this tip as a mighty fine treasure hunt!
---
I so much want better weapon models.  
---
This build will be ineffective at this game.  You should check out falloutbuilds.com if you want to see effective builds created by high level players. 
---
One way to counter some the sneak issues is to use an automatic.  Its less ammo efficient but you can get several guaranteed sneak shots into something before they can even react.
---
It's called Miner Miracles. You get it by examining a poster about the armor in the Ash Heap. It costs a lot of screws and black titanium, so start saving up!
---
Having the same issue. Can't repair my excavator power armour for the same issue as well as with my weapon mods
---
Did you mod it? My bottles just passed through it.
---
I don't get to play a ton, but since the latest patch has hit XB1, I can't seem to play for around 30 minutes or so at a time without the game crashing. 
---
The load times have been noticeably longer as well.
---
I'm still enjoying the game, but I'm just wary to do any big end game content with all the crashes I get - really hinders what I can do.
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout\_76\_quests#Main\_quests](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_quests#Main_quests)
---
Its in the side quests "Miner Miracles".
---
We can set up a business deal offering train service deals to Whitesprings Station, just across the road south of me.  Golf, ghouls and gourds.
---
Or please give us an indication of plans we already learned. 
---
Stories like this scare me
---
Probably a good compromise, but I'm always flirting with overburden, so the 10-lbs would hurt.
---
Yep this is another feature of the game that makes zero sense. I would much rather scrap a heavy item worth 400 caps than trade it for NINE CAPS. Guess it explains why I found a drawer full of legendary items for the taking, the original owner had no way of storing them or using them in any meaningful way. 
---
Yeah that was still much weaker then any weapon I ever brought along
---
My friend hunts down any bounty lol
---
Thank you for the advice😁
---
I think its area  activated or something like that, ive had it pop up when fast traveling to Harpers Ferry and also the Pumpkin house and that marsh up in the north east, cant member the name sry 
---
Why do they use %.0f instead of %d? 
---
600 hours
---
I'll give you a shout if this ever happens again lol
---
&gt; Anti-Armor. Destroys. Scorchbeasts.
---
Anti-Armor increases your damage by 28.9%. I know it sounds less exciting but that's the math.
---
Given the relatively low limit for caps, I don't think of them as a useful currency for trading with other players. Instead, I think of caps as a utility that helps you pick up plans or miscellaneous supplies from vendors if you're running a little low on something and don't feel like running around to gather the stuff yourself. Consider another MMO, World of Warcraft, where the cap for gold was 214,748 in its earlier days. It wasn't easy to earn gold on WoW and the game itself had systems in place to make gold a valuable resource for trade. This contrasts Fallout 76 where you can complete events that will add 1/250 of the cap limit to your character's bags in under 30 minutes. Making 1/250 of the gold cap on WoW in its early days was a far more challenging and time-consuming effort and played a large part in maintaining its intrinsic value. I'm cool with finding ways to add more utility to the value of a cap but I'll come back to that in a moment.

There needs to be a balance between preventing people from abusing the game to their hearts' content and not punishing the players that are not participating in game-breaking behavior. Imposing account-wide limits would prevent people from storing obscene amounts of duplicated items but would effectively limit the number of characters someone could reasonably play per account. It also does nothing if those items are kept in someone's inventory. Likewise, limits on how much a character can carry beyond their weight limit would prevent characters from being used as portable safety deposit boxes but would impose restrictions on players that like to pick up as much as they can and then go scrap all of it after their last adventure. Can reasonable limits be defined for these things? Sure, and I think Bethesda should have done so as a preventative measure to stop enterprising players from carrying over a million bobble heads. However, those limits should be considered and defined with care such that the players who want to play the game for what it is aren't restricted to the point of not being able to enjoy the game.
---
In the same vein, as long as there are enterprising players, there will be new ways discovered to bypass whatever limits are imposed on the game. If caps can be used to purchase something like an experience boost, what is to stop someone from selling caps to other players for real world currency? Giving caps the ability to enhance the playing experience enough to artificially inflate their value in game will also increase their value out of game. This will incentivize cap farming, even if it is done up to a limit, and will require players to decide if their caps are worth whatever people are willing to trade them in game or out of game. Is that experience boost worth that neon sign plan or a two-shot explosive weapon, or would I rather sell these caps to someone for $10? Of course, trading in game resources for real world currency should be a bannable offense but people will do it anyway. They're doing it right now with their duped items, and caps would be next if they too become very desirable.
---
I'm not quite sure what the best solution is to all of this but it's a very interesting problem when you consider how many parts and pieces go into it.
---
Attempted that, didn't work. 
---
Yes 
---
Have tried many servers, no fix. 
---
That would be super helpful.
---
I’m getting kicked out after like 30 seconds any time I try to play at all.

Ahhw, thanks. That makes me feel a little less lonely knowing someone would add me if they could 😅
---
I have 1000, can I get all of them?
---
I never played a game so much after its release ..I lovvveeeeee this game
---
That Legendary regen thing might explain why Legendary enemies sometimes fully regen their health. They cut the special damage after regen but they still restore health. 
---
Absolutely! And I’d love to see these faction built settlements work as faction hubs that somehow benefit members through buffs and unique shops.
---
There were posts on r/gaming go look there there are pics also. 
---
Agreed nerf melee damage by 75% as well. Might as well be "balanced" as the ones whining about tse say.
---
For scorch queen I actually make a base with no joke about 18 artillery pieces.  Make it right outside of Watoga.  And as she appears drop a smoke grenade.  Is it just me or does it target mobs?

Sure, join GT Uneekxsole

I wasted a couple on duplicate cards..now that I'm pretty familiar with it I'll make better choices on subsequent alt characters

Sounds like a great idea. Me and my friends play pacifist, always help out each other and other players. We give stuff out for free or trade for bottom price. We don't like cheaters, dupers, griefers, etc. Mostly, each of us is doing his/her own thing, and sometimes we trade or just help each other out. So very much what you have in mind I think.

I remember finding this event in the wild! I actually saw Ford alive and when I walked closer his head exploded. Kinda bummed me out that I just witnessed the death of the last living non-vault dweller human.
---
It is very rare, but yes... the so called slap damage can be passed if you health is a bit low and they do things like mentioned with stacking multiple bobble heads and using op weapons. Sad some people can be that way. By far, I've met more cool people out there. Best thing, even if your CAMP is being attacked by in game enemies (Scorchbeast), log out quick to save some of the damage it could be taking.
---
Sure just message me here, I'll most likely be on.
---
Take me home
---
Make some friends now then you can power level. Or, find new workshops to take on. Fair warning tho, the workshops in the top of the map and bottom right of the map both have higher level monsters and glowing ones.  
---
When I was level 25 I was about to leave the BETA. I did a lot of power leveling in the cranberry bog with friends killing scorched beasts flying around. Watoga highschool is the other decent power level location even if they nerfed it's rewards and xp.
---
I am about level 31 or 32 now on my second hero. If you play on xbox we can team up whenever. I also found a few guilds and such I enjoy randomly stumbling onto there camps and looking around. Also you can always drink cranberry tea, sleep well rested, and then take that 7% bonus and use it while cooking. A lot of levs I get are from cooking.
---
I’ll shoot you a message
---
I'm going back to fallout 3/4/NV to be honest.
---
its still a solid effect.
---
But hey maybe you are right, sorry op!!
---
Agreed all the stacking needs to be nerfed. I still dont understand ehy they simply didnt make it where demo expert perk card didnt apply to guns. This would have provided much relief without making them useless for pve. 
---
Aaronholt farms. Top left of map. 
---
For $60 that i paid for the game all this should have been already in the game. By the time they add it, we'll be long bored of this game. I can't believe they actually think this game has that much content to keep people interested for that long.
---
English isn't my first language....has better grammar and spelling than most primary speakers
---
Just make sure you have a lot of screws to make the Power Armor. 
---
The odd part for me has been there is no way of getting perk card packs other  than leveling. I think it was clear they were going to sell perk cards and then changed their mind after the backlash on other games. 
---
In the future I think it would be good if you got a card pack after finishing a raid or killed the queen after you've passed LV 50. It would give a decent reason to do the end game content. This would be reliant on alot more perk cards coming out.
---
I have a lot but don't use them since I craft healing salves
---
Well soon it will be posts about melee users then that will be nerfed too 
---
That's weird, what system are you on? 
---
It's a reward for completing the BoS story line. And yeah, the game in no way informs you you've received it. Under the item rewards it lists it as "power armour chassis".
---
yeah heaven forbidden a multiplayer game include modes people find fun in multiplayer games

No worries and no need to cheat or quit until you get more, I have plans for the ultracite if you are on Xbox and I'll give them to you and make you a set if you are on Xbox. You can get them from doing scorched earth, you get one piece every time. I can also give you a broken set of xo1 if you wanted. 
---
I have over 250 queen kills and ive never pulled a 3 star item or any plans, or any ultracite mods or serums. I get leg/arm , explosive vents and some 1 star crap legendary everytime. 
---
EVERY time. 
---
Tell everyone you know to make actual posts against this nerf and not just comments under existing ones. All the crybabies did and got their way, and that can go both ways. Time for us to get their op melee builds nerfed next. 
---
Very nice, think I'm level 36 and still haven't found one
---
Lmao 😂 what you don’t have the resources to fix some wooden walls and your workbenches? Lmao if you cant fix shit don’t make it so big. I’ve learnt that the hard way. But also don’t let people attack me anymore. I attack them ;) in other words don’t picklock my front door or you’ll get your base blown up. Bahahahaha you have been warned 😉
---
Sad, I tend to not trade with randoms really. I've had a number ask to TRADE and I've accepted and see nothing come up and just leave. Luckily my stuff remains. I've got a decent group that I play with and we are always trading things we find and helping each other out. Best of luck to you.
---
Some people would say it's early if it's Tse but it will help you in the long run even if it's basic two shot. If you don't mind me asking what weapon? 
---
Then this game will be fun until around level 100
---
Learn chance "None" means just that: there's no chance of learning that mod by scrapping. If you want to learn that mod you'll have to find the plan.
---
You missed the one I'm most excited about - Faschnacht in Helvetia! Not that there's much to see in the code but I assume it relates to the "Faschnacht Robots" note and the elusive masks. 
---
And you think this doesnt happen with melee one taps either?
---
It’s just a basic two shot, it’s a double barreled shotgun.
---
Hells yeahs! I like it
---
They charged $60 for the game in the state we all know.They are too greedy to do that at this point.
---
That only applies if you are wanted, not in pvp
---
There did seem to be a lot of things that they rushed to release about the game, but I think the no humans thing was calculated, and something they worked into most aspects of the game rather than a last minute spin. 
---
I think when they made it a multiplayer game like this there were a lot of things they couldn't do, like have a general ending to the game, any lasting change in the wasteland that players could effect (otherwise people coming in fresh wouldnt have anything to do), and I could easily see other people shooting up quest NPCs for the heck of it and messing with everyone elses fun (the alternative being immortal human npcs I guess?)... that said, I don't think I've seen people attack the scant few robot quest givers in game...
---
But I get your feelings on "showing up too late to save anyone", I got that impression a lot whenever I came across a ruined shanty town or trading hub. It would definitely be a different game if it had NPCs wandering around defending themselves, with 'help defend settlement X' instead of 'help defend this workshop!'. 
---
On the hand, it reminds me of this episode of Outerlimits from ages ago, where these astronauts from mars get infected by this thing that rapidly reproduces and takes over peoples bodies and as their ship is entering earths atmosphere it's down to the main character and this other astronaut that was infected and wants to make a deal with him so he can get down to earth and go cray cray. Guy ends up killing them both by crashing the ship and the announcer does this shpeel about how a real hero is someone who'll act heroic even when no one will ever find out about it. That seems to be the direction of the game - everyones dead and no one may ever find out what you did, but the scourge is a disease that needs to be wiped out or at least contained.
---
And you could have point system, like player vs player but the objective is not to kill others
---
Why are you getting downvoted? You're absolutely right. I paid $60 for this game but won't buy anything from bethesda from now on.Not saying the game is very bad, i still play it even today but buggedthesda needs to learn a lesson from this mess and stop insulting their fanbase with this kind of crap.
---
There's a barrel mod analogous to the long/crystallizing barrel for the cryolator. Makes it shoot fireballs. That's one I'd stash until I accumulated enough ammo to make it fun to use.
---
No interesting story content by the looks of it then. 
---
I have a furious + 10% more dmg when aiming + 90% reduced weight gatling laser. It weights 2.80 and I've not put any new mod because they increase weight quite significantly. With 200% condition and gunsmith lvl 5 it last about 4-5 fusion cores with 900 shots (double ammo from perks). It's pretty good when a scorchbeast is landed but no awesome. Ps: I don't have any heavy gun perks 😁
---
oodbye.
---
Uuuum seen alot of these postd lately and something i have seen myself. My spot deep in the Mire is always free.
---
But it seems something happened in the last patch. Something is making the area believe someone is there. I have done checks for miles around to find no one every single time.
---
Not many ever build in my area because i deal with heavy enemies. Several clannies have the some issue.
---
Something is causing the camp spots to think the spot is taken when you log in so it does not place your camp.
---
Some dev with tendencies like Lando but forgot to remove them perhaps ;)
---
Grats. The last few times I have gone there the lag has been horrible. I finally got plans for the the decon arch from that 
---
Problem is the same as when warfare tried to push pvp, when your core demographic is pve things get tricky.
---
Literally loved it the entire time. I don’t even crash as much as people say. I’ll crash once every 4ish play sessions (3-4 hours a time) 
---
The amount of Fallout fans that don't realize they're satiring red scare bullshit when they talk about "da commiez" is mind blowing
---
Throw em into the overseers camp stash box.
---
Join a random event where theres lottsa people and drop a bunch of em in a bag for em.
---
Leave ones in neat (relatively easy to find) hidden spots for the more observant wastelander to find.
---
Stash size is verrryy valuable. You cant be a treasure hoarder in this game. Need just enough to survive.
---
I have held onto just about every high level stealthy piece of legendary gear and my stash is starting to get tight. But sometimes ya gotta trim da fat.
---
That would be interesting. One thing I do wish they had more of is the actual rebuilding of humanity. 
---
I'm not the one who made that, no. I just found these whilst trying to figure out the loot lists for the Load Baring event and saw some interesting stuff in the messages section and thought I would share.
---
Yes please!
---
What...in....the...actual...FUCK??!
---
Morgantown train station, one of the metal shacks near mama solves. There's one in point pleasant. Also raider armor is available at 15.
---
maybe not all of them, but giving them a higher upgradeable bonus would be one way to implement this now. For instance, I’m talking a Winterized T-51b, makes the wearer slightly more agile and has increased melee resistance, or a Brotherhood of Steel T-60 with high energy weapon resistance. These were paint jobs in Fallout 4. 
---
It really bothers me that the only paintjob changes available are cosmetic only, through the Atomic shop. 
---
Indeed buddy.
---
Nice find OP
---
Other commenters are posting worth while solutions but I think your tip is good for those ppl that don’t have access to any of the other tips given.  Meaning no power armor, no perk card, no mutations , no legendary armor

😢

Oh
---
Its op, it will be on the block soon too. 
---
I’m right about 150 but I’m pretty casual. Still loving the game!
---
I love my lever action rifle. I dont have plans for it but I've picked up 2 in my adventures. The one I have now just happened to have all the goodies already on it. It's a no star weapon but it gets the job done. It's great for sniping (better than the .308 in my opinion) and even good at medium range.
---
I never even bother with Whitesprings with my explosive weapons.
---
But now that they are being nerfed because of that loot cave bullshit......
---
I'll be at Whitesprings every day now with my turret camp and this instigating sledge w/40% power damage. I'm going to 1 shot every friggin 3* legendary I see.
---
 Give it a minute. Go look at the store or whatever, 
---
 If you just log straight back in they will put you back if they can.
---
If you play on PC, I could craft you some Ultracite pieces, but not a full set
---
Alright so power armor is fucked up. But for the silo thing, when you’re going through that door to the reactor, move left and stay on the wall until you find a level three lock. Pick it and then move into the next room on your right. Hack the level three terminal and override the reactor. From there you jump to the mainframe core thing, without even doing it the reactor. And Happy Cake Day!
---
Bethesda pls
---
Little over 200. Still finding things to do.. Guess i just like the peaceful chaos of the wasteland too much :p
---
Don't forget all the XP nerfs. They don't want people getting to the endgame too fast, realizing there really isn't anything worth grinding for. 
---
Personal attacks when you can't win an argument. Classic.
---
I started using a Power Armor and Hazmat Suits and farming Nuke Zones to lvl up too. I pretty much stopped my main quests at the Raider parts (Keys to the Past - Five Keys) and waited to get my lvl up to 50, simple farming in areas helped me move the needle from 25 to 50 fairly quick. Now I'm going back to progress and get those higher lvl weapons.
---
Xbox one. I put in a ticket but that is a ridiculous glitch.
---
Go up by the hunting lodge in toxic valley there is normally a set of level 15 or 25 raider sitting out. 
---
Same im gonna do an op fatman build and simply blow all the corpses off the map, in the walls, and everywhere else. Ill be at whitepsings in every nuke. 
---
Ragtag outfits and Yao guai hats.
---
I actually forget which trader it was. I just ran in to use the stash and the plan was available. Sorry I'm no help on that one.
---
My friend and I were around 25 or so and we went through this cave, came out and found this HUGE SWARM of giant level 40 salamanders that seemed to infinitely regenerate... we didn't go back there until we were well past 50. 
---
...But then the game glitched in our favor. When we came back, the Gulper things were there again. I was in some power armor with a dragon musket out as I usually open a fight with it then switch out, I shot the first one and noticed instead of the usual 1, it showed I had 5 shots lined up with the monster gun. Some weird game hiccup gave me a clip of 5 dragon ammo shots with no reload or pause between them. It was amaaazing.
---
This right here is the right answer for an online multiplayer game. 
---
Fair chance that's why it got cut. 
---
It seems to be twofold, one part where you hold the spotlight in a PVP event that I think seems akin to king of the hill to gain votes and one part where you have to travel to voting sites around the map to collect votes. Whoever has the most votes at the end becomes president.
---
Eh.  I guess I'll never be president.
---
This is what happens when people "defend" or whiteknight fanboi for gaming companies that hide behind weak ass TOS.
---
Customers should always be treated as such and not the problem. Bethesda have a lot to learn which hopefully they are taking stock and coming up action plans and procedures to start treating there customers like people instead of mushrooms.
---
I love seeing and meeting new people in the game.
---
Altho chances are i wont accept a random team invite from out of the blue. Gotta hang out with a person for a littlw while first.
---
(Im on Ps4 too btw)
---
Sadly, not a bug.
---
I play on PC. Otherwise that thing sounds awesome.
---
Fun detected . Not allowed. 
---
I can give you mats for them or or buy the plans for the pieces if you have extra plans. I put in a ticket but that glitch is extremely disappointing.

you cant say guess then not give us the chance to guess!

Some of the Assaultron atuff is used by the Assaultron Head in the Enclave. Maybe it has more lines? I'll have to go check.
---
The quest markers in Poseidon are more dangerous than the scorched.
---
*Scaly
---
Yeah. I mean after lvl 100 and completed the quests there nothing to do, and what I'm seeing and hearing, Bathesda knows theres nothing and don't intend to make more. That means slow down progression artificially inorder to make the life of the game longer by making grinding longer.
---
lmao 
---
\#wastelandproblems!
---
For me they partially killed it with the planned nerfing of TS guns, this is just the nail in the coffin. If the nerfing goes through, I"ll be trading in my copy for the couple measly bucks I'd still get for it.. Only did this once before with ESO, guess I should've seen it coming.
---
Once I can craft enough to learn the scopes it will be better than the hunting rifle. I've already got the suppressor and hardened receiver. Now I just need about penetration and long scope.
---
It's more than some steel, wood and some other common stuff supplies. My base doesn't have any defences on it so the build meter is filled to the top with structures I'll post a couple screenshots tmr night showcasing my house so you can see.
---
It does use NPCs veeeery sparingly. I agree though, they've designed the game around this already, adding in NPCs at this point would just be tacking on something extra. If they'd designed the game and story from the ground up with having human NCPs and populated villages and all, that'd be a different story.
---
I can build and mod you a full set of Ultracite including calibrated shocks. GT is same.
---
Do you have any more plans? I’ve got tons of ammo I’d like to trade. I’ve been looking everywhere for the American flag plan and an affordable neon plan.
---
I never keep more than 50 normal and even then, I don't really need that much. I sell off all my diluted and supers. 
---
they should really buff loot
---
I have the Forrest hat. I have done only 30 runs and can only find dirty white and weathered uniforms though, I seriously want red.
---
That's already the way it's supposed to work. Explosive bobblehead stacking is a bug. Despite what people seem to think, fixing a bug is not as simple as going in and checking or unchecking a box that says "stackable."
---
Odd, XB1 here and I've never seen that happen, but I don't normally switch from one to another like that. I tend to grab them and jump into the one I want, so if the wrong one loads out of the two I carry, I call back the one I don't tend to use first and then hit enter on the other. but like I said, I don't normally jump out of one an switch.
---
They really need a gift emote that everyone knows means " Wait for a second,I wanna give ya something".
---
mine didn't shoot flames, just the explosives
---
Ive built my camp in a super tucked away spot. No one even knows its there. Plus try to stay 'hidden' or crouched while youre spending large amounts of time in camp.
---
People tend to take notice of other players hanging around vacant areas of the map. (When youre hidden you dont show up on the map)
---
maybe just dont drink a lot then admit to it in a rambling love letter to fallout 76 in a reddit you know I read on a regular basis :p 
---
The other guy has you covered I think, but in case he is too busy i'd be glad to craft you a fancy new set of ultracite if you need it. May need a couple mats but I definitely have most :) 
---
This guy is a nazi, check his comment history 
---
Well written post!
---
My list
---
1. Get rid of dupers
---
2. Keep working on bugs and stability
---
3. Increase the end game content. Nukes combined with more different events than the Queen would be a logical and easy start. 
---
4a. Update/fix how loot is distributed for events and kills of legendary enemies and bosses. I think it is not all bad as it is now but loottables and % of X tier item from enemy does not overall match effort input for the kill atm. 
---
4b. Server hop to get item/plan. This is beyond bad for a multiplayer game 2019. Up the prices in caps depending on item or even better introduce a special currency for high end items/plans/ammo, this would have the players actually playing the game (with orhers) to get the items instead of watching TV while walking in and out of a vendor room for hours upon hours and some end up quitting the game out of pure RNG.
---
5. Fix the duping and the bugs/stability since this Will be a returning issue.
---
Could Wright more but this is a good start for me.
---
There is a bunch near Tyler County Dirt Track. 
---
I agree with you there, choice doesn't matter nearly as much in FO76 as any of the previous games, especially since this ones doesn't really seem to have an ending - but I don't think they can really do that in a multiplayer game anyway... maybe if it was like Borderlands or Left 4 Dead where you got a tight squad of 4 players running through things.
---
Don’t lie

The rate at which you get Explosive vent plans is Fing BS. Im almost worried they are going to flag me for being a duper seeing as I have 17 copies of that plan, all acquired legitimately. Im hanging onto them until I get around to taking a screenshot to send with a support ticket/ rant that the rng is so beyond broken.
---
Lot of empty space in the northwest corner of the map. Let’s do it.
---
Bethesda is started to take things from peoples stashes if they think it’s a duped item 
---
Excavator set is bugged, its supposed to give 100 carry weight when wearing a full set, if you log out and back in with it it doubles that and is reproducible 100% off the time. I would assume this will be fixed in the next patch or after that at some point as its reproducible and an easy fix for them.
---
You can get mods that give you +50 carry weight and equip 2 per set (they can be difficult to find) so every PA set has the chance to give you at least 100 carry weight.
---
The small boost you get from equipping a frame / PA set is just a boost to the strength stat which in turn should give you a little extra carry weight, although (I'm not 100% on this btw) after a certain amount of strength invested in your specials it stops applying it.
---
"No, no Stealthboy, light just bends around me because I weigh 4 teragrams."

Wander from time to time an do some events and launch Nukes. Helps others that are lower when someone comes along and drops a few items or at least launching the Nukes to allow them to come and farm a little. I'm lvl 50 and still have quests to do to get where I can launch Nukes myself, so I thank all of you that have helped out and launched some Nukes. :)
---
Same area, just a little further along the rail toward the town.
---
I lovvvve getting em to land, crippling everything, and ending it with a few shots to the face.
---
They aint so big and bad when they aint flyin around screaming at everything.
---
What kind of magic do you use to post your link like that? Sorry I am very reddit illiterate 
---
Lol, but to be super cereal, I have heard tell that uninstalling the game and reinstalling fixes a lot of issues. Personally i havent had the balls to do this yet. Your character is on a seperate save file etc.......but this is a Bethesda game sooo..
---
That's not true.  
---
You don't have to manually scrap them, and the warning from auto-scrapping when doing repairs or building stuff doesn't always show that it would come from a mod.
---
Chairman Pow
---
Mine has both the long scope and hardened. I lucked out on getting it as a drop from an enemy. I use it all the time. I love using it picking off enemies when defend your workshop event comes up. For lower levels ya just run around,hit vats,wait for 75+ and you really do feel like Buffalo Bill quickly offing enemies. Thank God they fixed the reloading problem and to me it feels like it loads much faster now. 
---
Is there anything in particular you are needing/looking for? :) 
---
Off the top of my head, I know I have:
---
* Brick Building Set
---
* Ultracite Vents
---
* Ultracite Left Leg
---
* Duplicates of surely every recipe
---
I know I have a bunch more, but I don't know all of them off the top of my head. I can confirm when I get on in a bit! I also have a couple two-three star legendary armor pieces and weapons that are taking up stash space because I get them at nuke zones and then think "oh I'll need this one day" and then never use it... lol. So if you're looking for something, I might have it. (No two shots or explosives though, sorry. Not THAT lucky lol.)
---
Their TOS is bullshit written up by a team of lawyers, so they have the freedom to do whatever they want
---
They will autoscrap if you craft/repair/mod  something that uses those components. Even if you don’t directly scrap it yourself, the game will scrap it for you.  This is supposed to be corrected in the next update, I believe, so that you have to manually, directly scrap them to prevent this from happening.  So much of the time repairing doesn’t indicate from where the components are coming from, so even though I keep an eagle eye one the scrapping confirmation polio, I’ve lost a few mods to repair.

They're scrapped to steel. There's a bug right now where if you repair a weapon or do anything that requires steel (and you have no loose steel) it scraps them for it. So if you repair weapon, ect. It even scraps them if you have bulk steel in storage before using that bulk steel. Have scrap steel in storage always and keep tabs on it. It's a pain in the ass until they fix it. I lost around 8k worth of mods
---
Thank you kindly for the PSA! Wife and I will hunt these down.
---
I also got a legendary auto grenade launcher 
---
It does, I got if from doing Workshops and a friend got one as well later on. Just random, but that's where we both end up with it.
---
Isn't selling duped in-game items for real-world money in violation of the terms of service of the game, or against the rules of this Reddit sub?
---
Mine never appeared in my inventory after the quest. A few days later I put my power armor down and realized I had two... At some point it must have reappeared in my inventory so check again later 
---
What clickbait YouTube video told you that?
---
Could you do a video of you firing it?
---
That's how I got mine, claimed a number of Workshops and it hit. Same for a friend much later as well. FREE, but RNG
---
There are a bunch of bags of chlorine in the red shack  at Silva Homestead where you do project beanstalk.
---
I can craft the whole set if he is. Hit me up if you craft them for him 
---
i made a mule and jumped it to watoga station at lvl 17 to buy plans for the handmade for myself and friends.. if ya on ps4 and need plans bring me caps and i can go track it down for ya.. think they run my mule somewhere in the 600ish range i believe. psn: Silune
---
It’s a joke geez people lighten up 
---
If memory serves when someone new walks into the cell it can refresh the spawns based on that person.  Goes both ways, server hopping will typically get them my level if no one is already there.  
---
how much for the  vanguards marine chest armor ? 
---
Shhhiet. Then i guess its true. So dumb imo
---
100% with on that!
---
TBH I cant even recall being made to click on one on ps4 (not saying i didnt).
---
All gaming companies use TOS to hide behind and remove themselves from fault or blame, its shocking really that in this day and age of customer service and customer retention / loyalty that gaming companies use practices that equate to the 1980's dodgy time share practices / double glazing companies :/
---
Dang I didn't know it worked liked that I thought I was going crazy. Thanks y'all 
---
Yeah I was going to give you my set with calibrated shocks but I'm on ps4! 
---
Jokes are funny...
---
Ugh. Peasant.
---
Try and have a higher level team up with you. Im on xbox1 and can help.
---
Really?! I guess I lucked out, I got the plans on my second run of it and have done the event a half dozen or so times
---
I read you.
---
Unfortunately i’m on PS4 and don’t have anybody to play with
---
Can you skin multiple types of weapons? I'd like to see any thing I marked as a favorite to be protected pretty much.
---
I'm not even like a quarter of the way through the game and I'm just fucking around and building my camp RN. I'm on the obstacle course mission but I can't complete it so I'm doing that instead
---
I wish spears were throwable. 
---
Hats: I have brown, green, red, white, yellow.  
---
Uniforms: I have Brown, green, white.  
---
A complete list, according to game files:  
---
Hats: Blue, brown, Forrest (how it is spelled in the esm), Green, Pink, Red, Weathered, White, White Direty, Yellow  
---
Uniforms: Blue, Forest, Green, Pink, Red, Weathered, White, White Dirty, Yellow  
---
As far as I can tell with a cursory glace at references to the items in 76Edit, they are all available either as a world spawn in the Asylum or from quests in the cranberry bog.  
---
Outside of the strip between 76 and Flatwoods I'm pretty sure it's directly tied to who walked into cell first.  I've had to fight off a wave of level 60 glowing dogs at workshop west of Flatwoods , I was level 15.  Had a high level in the area that hosed me.
---
Maybe a new update?
---
2 I think near one of the telephone mast things by point pleasant
---
I love the butthurt, “angry enough to downvote you for stating reality”.
---
Uhh...dollars?
---
Your point being?
---
You can't bypass much when items can't be traded or dropped, and sure, you can do stuff with caps, but not enough imo, and they need to be worth way more to high level chars.
---
Advice would be go and level up a bit and go back to it.
---
I think the top of the world area is where you'll notice the difficulty change a bit.
---
Go explore a few places, do some events or a side quest or three and go back to it and you'll be fine :)
---
Also check the map, if theirs anyone higher level than you in the area it will make the enemies scale to them fyi
---
It happens bro had this twice last week. Just log out of the server shutting down and log into a new one.
---
Yes, gambling would be another great one.
---
Where do you find them?
---
Nope. It could have been done better. Being able to hot swap em more easily I would be okay with.
---
87 pounds is nothing lol...
---
That sounds like one trip back from Sugar Grove.
---
You should've built the train station near a train cart, so you have your own little train 
---
He had a good haul.
---
Ah, I'm 510 hours in and never received the message unless patch is incoming.
---
Thanks and thanks! I have 3 lp but only 1 hacking. Guess i know where my other two points are going!
---
No need, I've been hanging onto them for awhile, I wouldn't mind a right leg of any kind if you have a spare. I'll be on in about an hour or two. I'll give you my GT. 
---
Same here man, strange... Guess you've just had bad luck my friend. If you wanna play with friendly Europeans my in-game name is TheoPeo and my discord is Theo#7185, we've got a group of mixed europeans that play almost daily.
---
Unfortunately only the ones that the atom store has skins for.
---
As if it wasn't hard enough to believe you've kept some tally sheet documenting 137 crashes to begin with, knowing that 37 is the most common number for people to pick at random kinda tops it off.  
---
87 pounds with the tier 3 weight reduction perk. It was still good because I am always low on screws
---
Cool story. 
---
Been a thing since last patch now man. No idea why just log out of the server going offline and log into your new one.
---
That's still not bad by any means. Find lots of the same kind and get some good mods for it, if you fight scorched often you can get a scorch killer receiver. 
---
You know what she is expecting the  soon right?
---
That must be it, i have 15 in strength atm. Thanks!
---
A downvote?  For perfectly useful patch info that isn't found in the sub via search?  
---
People of Earth!
---
Don't got a good location for ya on screws. But that lad was not junk hungry with a bounty. 
---
Also i find springs the most annoying lol.
---
I collect those rings and give to every friend I make in the game. I am in the ultimate harem.
---
I think they added a pipe shotgun to Fallout 4 via the Creation Club so it is very feasible that it may eventually end up in 76. 
---
&gt; one liner
---
&gt; Responds with a novel
---
Your lack of wit is why you don't get laid.
---
No but the word on the street is they are patching it on the 5th.  I haven't seen that for myself but was told this by someone else.  
---
In the meantime I've started a new character.
---
My discord name is [PC] Enzth#4203 an in game is just Enzth. I'll be online in about 3hrs for till late tonight.
---
Well, if you do the distant thunder quest, the artillery strikes will target the actual enemies you Recon. The fire delay makes it not obvious because they move around, but I got in a running gunfight with the mobs once, and the artillery kept marching across the field as we moved. I wonder if the player artillery will do something similar. 
---
I didn't know about the Watoga/Harper vendors until I was past the 15-20 lvl window. I started picking up a penitentiary key every time I did Patrol Duty, and didn't pay any attention until this morning. I have 43 pen. keys, and 0 Handmade plans. I do have 9 plasma rifle plans, and 8 .44 pistol plans left, that I haven't gifted to new players.
---
Wtf do I do with plasma rifle plans?
---
Yeah, I'd love the opportunity to to rename power armor also. It would make it so much easier to find what set you want.
---
Springs are hard to find but he only had 30 so it wasn’t worth mentioning 
---
Ps4 CTD every 1-3 hours roughly.  No observed pattern or precursor.  However that's about only problem I've noticed since last patch.
---
There is one place where a bomb is in a corpse where if your perception is 1 you fail a skill check and don’t notice. Which is weird they coded in skill checks then only use it one ultra pointless place
---
I'm not sure how the tracking works on trained creatures, but was part of your base attached to the creature? If so, recreating then deleting the piece may help. 
---
This works for turrets. Example: Stores foundation with turret. Turret remains hidden but still takes up budget. Delete foundation and budget restores to non-turret budget. 
---
Was the sloth tied or placed somewhere as part of the base?
---
It’s doing some good against the level 46 ghouls around whitesprings 
---
This information is solely sourced from the 'messages' section of the game so it's likely that either the Helvetia event has no messages associated with it or the content isn't yet implemented into the game where we can see it.
---
I too am looking forward to some more of the Helvetia masks. The owl one looks really cool.
---
Sugar Grove for springs always go there if your short. insane amounts of them are found there its like my favorite place.
---
I was playing on a team with my friend the other and and after a few hours we were invisible to each other. We were fighting Mirelurks by Watoga Station and couldn’t even see each other or interact.
---
Wait they nerfed the bee...
---
God damnit  when did this happen
---
I want teddy bears and jangles sitting on my furniture, please.
---
It doesn’t crash that often for me on an Xb1S.  I only crash once every 3-4 days.  I play 4-5 hours a day. 
---
I see no problem with your timer idea unless there is someone in queue.  It would probably be better addressed with a “rejoin last server” option.
---
I’m lvl 11. Add me: r_castro33
---
I literally have the screenshots of the gore bits from his head on the ground. He was just standing in the road and his head popped when i got close.
---
I haven't seen this event in a long time either.
---
So you hunt dupers because you don’t like duping, but then you take the duped junk from their corpse when you kill them..
---
Ok then, seems legit
---
I'm done with you little kid. I'm not entertained  enough by someone who has the brain capacity of an angsty 15 year old. Sorry, not sorry. ✌🏻
---
Exactly lol
---
&lt;verification needed&gt;. Sounds like bullshit to me. 
---
Imagining this post  if you killed the guy I did yesterday that had 592lbs of junk.  I had to remove basically all my damage perks to get my weight down and start giving and selling it all away.  
---
This is epic
---
That's about everything I can think of to be thankful about.
---
It's pretty rare. I did it two days ago at level 193 and that's the first time I've ever seen it.
---
 Super Mutants are heavily armored, some very heavily and that's why they are a problem. 
---
 Make sure you have armor piercing mags and use the perks that are available as you get to them. A hard hitting Hunting Rifle with Reflex Sights and a Bayonet is what I used before getting better weapons.
---
Sometimes the servers we play on need reset, just like restarting your computer after leaving it running for a month straight.
---
He is charging REAL money for the items he is offering. His account has been removed several times before on various subreddits for this reason.
---
This is the stupidest comment ever.  I have over 350 hours in game. I pmayed all week long. And i kept track cuz i was looking like an idiot defending the game. So you liar liar and quote some bullshit thing about my number. Go fuck yourself internet troll. Not dealing with little 13 year old fucktards today. Too pissed at the imaginary blue screens. Fuck off 
---
Yeah I'm on an old Xbox... but I don't really accept the suggestion to upgrade my console as a solution to this particular problem. I know people on Xbox One X who lock up fairly often too. You must be lucky. 
---
What level are you? I know you probably know this but those plans are level locked. I found mine within a couple hours when I made my mule just for the plans. Got her to lvl 15 and there she sits. 
---
Get one with faster firing speed,  upgrade to speedy receiver,  and take rank 3 martial artist.  Laugh as everything dies  
---
The last 3 Scorchbeast Queens I've helped take down(huge group this morning kept nuking Fissure Site Prime again and again) awarded 2-star heavy combat armor pieces.  On top of that, a bunch of people were just dropping theirs, also 2-star combat armors.  I've basically decked out my defenses in such a way that I'll be good until I start finding some great 3-star legendary armor pieces.
---
Yeah Mirelurk nests are usually guarded by 4-5 Mirelurks but I'd expect these Queen Nests to be around 15-18 Mirelurks, but they come gradually.
---
Could I get my set (when I get it tomorrow) modded with shocks by you? I'm on xbox too. 
---
How much would you charge for this service? 
---
Rejoin last server is cool with me as long as it keeps those workshops intact. 
---
Unfortunately the meta of the game is to hangout at the Whitesprings loot cave.
---
Most of the weapons are garbage vs anything other than the trash ghouls at Whitesprings......and to make matters worse the few guns that are any good are getting nerfed in a week.
---
If you want to play just go run laps around Whitesprings...... don't worry about stimpaks you won't need them!
---
I sneak into player's CAMPS and drop propaganda flyers around.
---
Fine with me, just didnt want so lowball offer. Hit me up, my gt is Walery.
---
Sorry for the late response, my baby woke up and had to take care of him.
---
Just in case anyone hasn't discovered it yet, [Portable Fuel Tanks](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Portable_fuel_tank) (not the Mr. Handy ones) contain one screw each!
---
PVP is great but I don't think it is what the majority of FO76 players want. It's never been a part of the Fallout franchise before. I think the closest to PVP was the hotseat multiplayer in Fallout Tactics.
---
I've been playing since beta day one and have done this event maybe 3-4 times.  It's extremely rare.
---
Korean MMO style.
---
Yeah, this is...I get a downer of a vibe from this.
---
My husband and friends do not give a crap about pvp at all. Like to a hostile degree. If that’s the only (tired) method they have to try and keep (some) of the player base continually invested, that’s not going to work for us.
---
And I have a very negative visceral reaction to the the “lunch boxes”. We’re nit fucking stupid. You know exactly what they would be.
---
Lol that's awesome
---
 What is end? I have BOS Officer at the third level and just need Violet Flux for the forth.
---
Have all the materials on your local inventory, not the stash, when crafting.
---
Put all your junk in your stash, rather than split between stash and character. 
---
I would settle for an indicator of plans I *don’t* have if that would be easier
---
Firstly go to your notes section and read any plans or recipes you have. Second get rid of missiles,nukes and any heavy ammo you dont or wont use. Sell old guns and armor you dont use. Find a tinker bench and start bulking everything you can. Look at your perks and move cards around. You can change these to fit your situation. Dillute your stimpaks. Try more stealth instead of going for kills and run away if need be. Alot of your weight issues can be solved by just cleaning out those things.
---
That's not the situation with the Fallout 4 fixes at all. They went hardcore into going through it and figuring out fixes, there are several pages on the forum about it. I'm not sure if it was customer support themselves or just really helpful players who did it. And for the record, the steps they came up with did fix it for me.
---
Inventory management took me awhile to get used to.  You just need to tag what mats you need and only pick up the stuff you tag.  You may need to upgrade your armor if you are burning through stims that fast not sure what you are doing or why you burn through them so quickly.  I had to set limits for each item and vendored everything that is over that.
---
I feel like your comment wasn't meant to be directed to me as I never suggested they were or even hinted at it. I only said they duped everything and still can make money, even more money after a tse nerf.
---
Two conflicting answers there. I think as long as it's all in your stash, or all on you character it works. 
---
If you have half the mats in stash and are carrying the other half it doesn't work. 
---
Save your money til they finish fixing the game and its on sale for $15 or less 
---
Awww thanks for this!
---
I'd like my T-51b to have a Cola bottle to show it has my Nuka-Cola paint job. I agree, would be nice to mouse over an see if it has mainly T-45, T-51b, T-60, etc that it is at least that. Not sure if many rock mix an match, but if I have at least 4 or more of something, it should be considered that.
---
To know if it's rifle or pistol usually look at the grip.  If it says "whatever" Grip = pistol, if it says"whatever" Stock = rifle.
---
This is very impressive!
---
Nice, will add!
---
I decided to sell it in the end, mainly based on weight management, ammo farming and the lack of being able to mod it, and honestly between a tse pump, anti armour shotgun, ts hunters and a nocturnal explosive handmade combined with almost covered head to toe in chameleon gear I focus at ground control in sbq fights 
---
Cool story but that doesn't change my point 
---
Science has gone just far enough. 
---
The most of any bobble I have is 45 explosive bc i traded a lot for those. Lol 
---
If you have a game with a lot of issues and bugs, the last thing you want to advertise is new content. It would make it seem like they're not fixing bugs. It sucks, but I'd rather have it the way it is now with them fixing bugs they've never fixed before, which actually means something. If new content is a little ways away so be it, I'd rather the game work right now than have more stuff to do. I'm like 100 hours in and I still have a lot to discover, not sure what everyone else is doing.
---
If you want to spice things up, head to the roof of the Torrance house.
---
I have the same stats as you, 0-7 fully ranked perk cards and 4-70+ recipes...ugh...
---
I've got one.  It's just an explosion thrower.  No lightning effects at all.
---
I want K.L.E.O. from fo4. She has great dark humor.
---
I'm thankful for a lot more, but I give oraise and thanks to RNGesus that there are no flying Cave Crickets! He may screw me on legendaries, but there are no flying Crickets! Hallelu! 
---
Longer shelling time
---
What’s the deal with the Gatling guns firing speed? I have a legendary one sitting in my stash that says it has a fire rate of 500 but there’s absolutely no way thats true... is it?
---
Watoga robots are just as bored with me. They see me a just drop dead
---
This is...disappointing.
---
I hoped for a future where we'd be fighting giant mutated beasts, or swarms of them...not another shitty PVP game.
---
I guess I'll be moving on when Disco Elysium finally releases.
---
Are you scrapping all the junk you pick up? Almost impossible to be full but not have mats to repair. Also no reason to have full box. Don't hoard. No need. Stim packs are all over. Before I learned the recipie I'd literally have to dump them on people to make room. Always check first aid boxes. What platform you on?
---
I had issues too. 
---
First, dump as much weight as you can. Scrap everything and bulk it. Put as much as possible in your stash. Then take a buffout, a whiskey, and a nuka cola quantum before you go. 
---
Pro tip to OP: don't spell the word "spelled" as "spelt" when correcting someone else's spelling. 
---
Yeah, but 10lbs extra that enables you to fast travel when you're 200lbs over the limit is a good deal if you ask me
---
How about a mothman damage, equal to SBQ?
---
You’d summon it like those old Godzilla movies, and watch it reign fire over your enemies?
---
Or, tame an SBQ to ride like a flying mount similar to wow.
---
Or, tame a deathclaw or Yao gai bears to ride as mounts, like in Star Wars empire strikes back.
---
Or, with all the broken motorcycles or jeeps, the ability to repair and operate using handy fuel.
---
It would drive down the cost of jet packs and save us all that time walking to and from wherever 
---
Sounds like my social life! 🤣😂😅😭
---
On PC there's a button in the launcher to verify the integrity of the game files. It error checks the game files. It works, because when the first patch launched I got a bad/incomplete install of it and the game was stuttering horribly and this fixed it. No need to delete or uninstall anything, just click and wait.
---
Yeah, this is...I do not get a good vibe from this.
---
My husband and friends do not give a crap about pvp at all. Like to a hostile degree. If that’s the only (tired) trick they have to keeping (some) of the player base invested, that’s not gonna work for us.
---
And I have a very negative, visceral reaction to the “lunch boxes”. We’re not fucking stupid, you know exactly what they will be.
---
It's mixed.  I talk to some people, I emote to some people, I ignore some people outright.  All depends on my mood really.
---
Fav version of this is if you kill someone on a platform, grabbing their stuff *before* they fall over the railing is always fun
---
I had that with moleminers,  moleminers fell dead  all at once before i could shoot
---
I mean, lvl 70ish, and finished most everything. I'm only trying for the lvl 100 achievement and then I've done just about everything with my team (which pretty much doesnt play anymore). Fixing bugs that shouldnt have even been there doesnt mean anything when everyone stops playing the game cause theres no new content. 
---
Great idea heres your upvote 💙
---
Agreed. I wish the mom arc had more recurring quests
---
I guessed wrong :0
---
&gt;Raw Flux *eventually* becomes inert flux, 
---
That's a funny way of spelling "after 5 minutes."
---
I had no bounty.  Walked by a camp,  it started shooting me.  I responded.  Got a bounty.  Said screw it,  took out all the threats,  and the fusion generator.  
---
Sorry mr camp owner,  but blame bethesda. I'm going to defend myself
---
I would’ve appreciated it’s online feature being akin to something like dark souls. Where you can play it offline or online but still the same game and what ever you do only effects people that join your world or invite you to theirs
---
lol hmmkay
---
Nothing in your comment makes it even vaguely resemble a joke. People say such ridiculous and stupid things these days that if you're going to make joke on the internet you have to make that very clear, or people will assume you're serious and stupid.
---
Yeah. My only thought is that you have to set the nozzle so it'll spray as far as possible. Still, the range is so short, you're bound to blow yourself up. 
---
We do this, but with a group of friends that plan to stay on. The only risk, is if the server crashes.
---
Are they messing with the ts to? I thought it was just the tse, fun fact is since I just got mye tse pump and have limited perks for a shot gun when they nerf it and I get all my perks set up I don’t think my game play will be that different, and I think I’ll still be at that 1-2 shot for standard enemies when I max shotgun and get explosive perks set
---
Your point is that taking out mobs instead of dealing damage to queen is a bad thing. My point is that its a crucial activity.
---
Anyway launching nuke prime on a server without several 100+ players is a mistake.
---
But I'm not talking about fallout 4, I'm talking about the customer service of online games in general. None of what I said applies to fallout 4 at all.
---
Started a casual group of people who are in the same boat if that's your speed. Most of us rolled new characters and are in that 10-20 range. Join us here if you want to coordinate!

I find them at White Springs occasionally, with a group of super mutants.
---
So if you look at my post history I had the same problem. I put in a ticket and spoke to support and Bethesda is blaming Sony. After speaking to Sony support the pretty much laughed at the fact that it’s Sony and not their game. 
---
So Bethesda passing the blame just tells me that they’re no where close to wanting to fix it. 
---
But, are you wearing a power armor with targeting HUD by any chance?  I was and my buddy was and we were both experiencing the blue screens. For the last two days I put on my excavator armor (without a targeting HUD) and I have had zero blue screens. 
---
I put on the X01 this morning with a targeting HUD - blue screened in 10 minutes; T60 with no targeting HUD - played just fine.  
---
a deathclaw merchant? rose must be at it again
---
Don't get me wrong: I would also like to see alternate paintjobs for the excavator armor. Even if it were as simple as "replace the yellow parts with red, or green, or tiger-stripes," it would be a pleasant change, but if for whatever reason they can't or won't do that, this seems like a happy compromise. 
---
Yeah, think it was 7 strength but at 15 as well so didn't pay to much attention to it.
---
Glad to have helped!
---
Hmmkay? That's cool you gonna come over here trying to insinuate something? 
---
Agreed. Stop worrying about dumb shit like tse damage when the game doesn’t even run properly.
---
You’ll never “fix” PvP in a game as there will always be a meta. It just shifts with each change.
---
Dude thats an idea. I am running the hud. Ill try taking it off. 
---
Yeah, that would be cool. It wouldn’t be long before we lost them to lag though I think. Even with tomahawks, if I throw them directly at a wall in front of me, and can see them sticking out, I can’t always pick them back up.
---
add me and ill be glad to help you out, Spartan13_2. ill be on soon
---
Combined with Bolstering and Vanguards, Heavy BOS Combat Armor you'll have tons of resist
---
I have one that I have used in close quarters, against tough enemies. I think it's called the paralyzer, and it reduces their damage after damaging them.  I can remember it being very useful when I was surrounded by high leve supermutants who were pounding on me with melee weapons. 
---
I should say if your not repairing tour weapon and you have a tse rifle chance it out formore explosive damege owever its called
---
if you’re not close enough to the fissure and you don’t have a lot of caps then you can’t get there right away, i know that it’s happened at whitesprings while i was at vault 76 and i had just done a lot of trading with a player so i had like no caps, and it doesn’t take that long to run there and by the time i was there she was dead...
---
I just left the area and figured I would just wait until maybe level 20 ish or something. What level are you?
---
Thats what happens if u buy PS4
---
Terrible. I'm on the north side of Summerville near the bridge and the south end of Summerville is out of range. I tried to bombard the super mutants on the south side but it won't reach past the intersection in the middle of town. I get "Artillery out of range".
---
I dare to guess that wouldn't even help. You using nvidia?
---
Can you alt+ctrl+del and get the menu it gives?
---
Premise interesting but the payout seems very one sided. I mean that’s a lot of effort for the attacking players and damage to their equipment to get nothing at all if they don’t take the base. Perhaps it would be a call for help and they help defend the base and the more the defend, the higher the rewards?
---
PS4? SaltySpitoon187 
---
There are literally TONS around Whitespring. Especially the east side towards the train station. Also down near the service entrance.
---
lvl 164, id be glad to just plow through the enemies for you lol
---
Id jump on this band wagon, many times been 5 or 6 runnin together, then weird things happen or someone forgets pacifist then got two groups with wanted/red named. Pain in the ass.
---
I scrap everything yeah, my problem with hoarding is down to the fact I don't actually know what is worth keeping.. I'm afraid to throw something in case it's actually better than I think it is! 
---
I'm on Xbox, you?
---
Just read this. I feel your pain. 
---
Don't sell non legendary weapons, unless you are sure you've already learned every mod available.
---
Also based on how Bethesda has been treating their consumers it is highly likely that those who bought the game are going to receive nothing in compensation.
---
will give me something to do and you get help
---
Oh ok. I’ll add you lol
---
Just having the Chinese be an actual bad guy threat really really misses the point of what fallout was going for (which fits fallout 76 honestly)
---
There's two things to remember in regards to inventory management; scrap all of your junk first, and don't keep weapons or armor you can't or won't use.  Take the perk white knight for armor repairs, it greatly helps.  
---
Take a bit and read this thread.  It'll change your life!

Sutton station had one a while back for me. I opted out and have regretted that ever since. 
---
That train station is a wonderful idea. I saw that it was built near power lines. Did that give you any trouble? I don't know if the bulldozer function works on things suspended in the air. 
---
Server hop at Grafton Station
---
Because there aren’t enough ways to grief ppl already?
---
lmao
---
Reckon a 1 char build can "bore" the SQB to death?
---
My armour is okay, but occasionally I'll stumble across a bunch of enemies that are like level 60+ and they just rinse my health, even if I try and run they keep following.. until I inevitably die or waste all of my supplies
---
yeah lol, ill be on soon ill join you, i have a mic also if you do
---
How did you know they're dupers? 
---
You may want to include your System in the post.
---
I had the same problem. I just reset the game and came back later and it worked for me.
---
That's Roachie and he is the husband of Final Pam. 
---
You probably smell like Grahm.
---
Screw the reviewers on youtube that complain. They should play tetris instead. 
---
People have made a good case that if they lowered the prices of things in the shop, they'd actually make more money. 
---
I like your suggestion too. 
---
No mods. I just dropped the nuka quantums and they surprisingly didn't glitch thru
---
Where can I sell things? Advice is a good start, maybe I should have a clear out and take a fresh approach to my play style 
---
This is the truth!!!  
---
Maybe you are a molerat
---
The Endurance S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat..the one that you can put perk cards into and, as a "special", affects your HP
---
👍🏻
---
I’ve been hopping there for a while still haven’t found it
---
tfw your arm goes numb.
---
Thanks for that. 
---
Couldn't get them to spawn on my 100+ toon.
---
Created an alt and at level 16 they showed up on the Grafton vendor. 
---
Apparently they are level locked from 15-45 (thumbs up Bethesda /s)
---
&gt; As an Event reward, you will get a guaranteed weapon with the Exterminator's Legendary effect (+30% damage to Mirelurks and Bugs).  
---
Ooh, vendor trash! 🤣
---
But otherwise a great suggestion and fun sounding event.
---
Any tips on leveling up? 'Cause I tried and ran out of side quests. I suppose I could work on daily quests or something but that sounds a bit tedious. 
---
You don’t. You just buy some cheap stuff off of them then hop servers! Lmao 
---
That’s annoying
---
Ah, thanks all. 
---
Lol
---
Wish consoles had this. Honestly it kind of amazes me on the lack of file tools consoles have. Yes they are made for family entertainment but anyone with any know how understands the importance of clearing caches, checking integrity, and defrags. They could have hidden them in an options menu. 
---
Try Monongah . You’ll love it
---
 I have my first Marine Armor set now. Its great and I'm not sure if it is better than BOS Combat, which I have for most Combat Armors.
---
Yep, its gonna take a long time
---
I too have been looking for it the past week or so. Been to multiple vendors, multiple times. Loading to and from worlds to jumble inventory and still nothing
---
High level guy with a lvl two guy standing over a brown baggy with a shit ton of legendaries, stacks
---
BOS Combat Armor is way better, unless you want rad resist then Marine is better 
---
Yeah! Or, or, or.... Or what are we going to do it they don't?
---
WTB Cave cricket queen boss (flying or none flying variant!)
---
Wow. The Mrs and I thank you!! 🖤
---
The D?
---
Oh I’m not op ;)
---
Now that I think about it, it is kinda weird. 
---
The first time you do it, you do all three to learn them. Any day after that your only allowed to do 1
---
Healing salve over stimpacks. Easier to make. Farma-Pharma perk also does wonders, go into any hospital with it at rank 3 and clear out the medkits. Get tons of drugs and stims.
---
 What is your stashbox full of if its not important mats you need to repair? Only keep important mats in stashbox at low levels, weapons you get are generally speaking not worth holding onto unless its sentimental like quest rewards.
---
Honestly id need to know what is in your stashbox, what your perks are, etc specifically in order to give advice 
---
Sounds good, thanks
---
 Ahh. Thanks for the exp[explanation.
---
Bethesda's Support Center under Feedback.
---
Bethesda doesn't have that good of story writting for that.
---
A while back I used to have turrets and sometimes they would attack me for no reason. So as any master who can Bring them in this world, I took them out of it.
---
I don't remember where I found mine, during the Beta, then when the husband started playing, he went hunting for one so we could match. I love those little details!
---
Killing yourself with molotovs and leaving a paper bag full of bones got it!
---
Before the other guys showed up the enemies were mostly below my level, in the mid teens. I had a couple stronger ghouls that were like 24 or something but they were all under 30.
---
I also didn't go out of the way to find the place. I've just been following the main quest and doing side quests as I go.
---
I wish they'd increase the range though. It's ridiculous that I can't shell the other side of the town I'm in. It makes it useless except for shelling nearby enemy spawns just for fun. Being able to shell anywhere within the region you're in to help with quests would be nice.
---
With perks stealth bonus is 3x
---
Should have least sent him a message saying thank you for the screws :)
---
Benefits of being a raider hey :D
---
Don't like big words, huh? Prefer something a bit more monosyllabic?
---
I would spend atom points to paints escavator 
---
I have a set I believe. Im on PS4. 
---
Ive been doing something to this effect for the last two months. (But better IMHO)
---
You dont need a high DT to survive in a unarmed build though.
---
The number 1 problem is you get eaten alive by radiation.
---
Just let us scrap them to learn (non-legendary) mods for our other weapons' mod slots.
---
Rifles have armor piercing magazines as well. And melee weapons also have the anti-armor legendary variations, but they also get the Incisor perk which already ignores 75% of armor at max level, add the extra 50% from the anti-armor legendary effect and you get 125% armor penetration.
---
No, what is there to insinuate? 
---
Why would i bother doing that?
---
This is basically how I farm things like screws. I server hop for a bounty, contest workshops, or do monster mash if someone else is. Its amazing to me how often people do not deposit their stuff. I think I have like over 1k screw springs etc now on my mule, and  I cant tell you how often I kill people with like 20-40 ballistic, a few hundred screw springs gears etc, or bulk aluminum etc.
---
There's no way to steal half a million disease cures (or even one disease cure) from a duper. 
---
Full sets of duped armor which could get nerfed. At what point does buyer confidence erode? If you put down the $40 and then your armor gets nerfed hard, how likely would you be to put down real money ever again?
---
Bethesda is a company comprised of thousands of employees. 76 I think had 300 people working on it. That none of those people give a damn about seeing this game succeed seems unlikely. Apart of making the game succeed is for it to have a successful in-game economy. 
---
And yes I'm aware that releasing a broken ass game comes across as not caring. But I doubt the people who worked hard on this game wanted it released in this state. If they had kept the BETA going for like six months things would have been fine. 
---
I know right. They kinda remind me a bit of those flying insects in FO3. Cant remember their name. I think it was something like cordizar or something. 
---
I really like that trainstation! I hope you're OK me using that idea myself in the future? (:
---
Fully? (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)
---
Do you have a tinkerer bench? Bulk everything, keep around 100 units of an item more than that is a waste of space, so typical would be 10 bulk = 100 units. There's several guides around on what to scrap and what to dump but off top of my head rare stuff is really only stuff to keep, ie ultracite, ballistic fiber,....shit cant remember lol. Most junk can be farmed. I have a route for plastic lead aluminum steel oil antiseptic I run that takes about an hour and come away with plenty of mats. When you go to repair what's it say yer missing? I'm on ps4 otherwise I'd totally help ya out
---
I was considering it but I server hopped too fast and forgot his name
---
you can only buy handmade between level 15-22. It only spawns are watoga and free states vendor bots. 
---
What's the Bulwark mod? I've never seen this. Do you mean Buttressed? If so, it is learnable by scrapping. Just keep trying. I had to scrap about 100 left arms to unlock the last Marine chest mod I needed.
---
Add me in game Enzth. I just sit around an build camps like http://imgur.com/gallery/byHn3Tn all day but I'm always down for whatever!
---
Eh could have just been farming ghouls. I dump 1 star legs all the time just to clear up my weight.
---
I've been playing solo the whole time. My first time up, I go chased by a sentry bot and I think I jumped off a cliff trying to get away. 
---
I *think* that if you listen to the radio it will trigger some quests that make the robots tolerate you. There are still plenty of other enemies uop there though that are really tough. 
---
My build lis that. I try to pick some bad guys off from as far away as possible, and from an elevated position, if possible, before going in. Chameleon armor is a big help. And a silencer. 
---
Standard Bethesda customer service unfortunately :(
---
This. 100%. Happens to me with weapon repairs all the time.
---
Mate, I use a best hat myself. And believe me. There's nothing worse then having packed your hat full of beer and se douchebag with a TSE decides to aim his gun at your vicinity. Spilled goods all over the floor.
---
I rest my case 😋
---
Wear a hazmat suit, even if it breaks you still get 98% radiation reduction
---
Pack of duct tape?
---
Oh wow. Could also been someone with a mule but it seems obvious. 
---
I’m on Xbox.
---
This is not good news...  
---
On an unrelated note does anyone want to sell Mr Fuzzy Tokens to me for some caps?
---
When you've been asking the game for a TSE weapon but get this instead.
---
Lol I wear my postal outfit an transfer stuff for my friends to their alts. We always seem to range weapons on our melee an melee weapons on our rangers. So I use the postman outfit an transfer our loot back an forth. Also used it one time when it first came out to deliver canned food an water too low lvls.
---
Sorry cant help you then. Other than to tell you I got my plans down in the ash heap train station. Forget the name. 
---
can we all agree that this game is massively pve with a half assed pvp system slapped on let the people play how they want and only nerf the TSEs in the new hardcore pvp servers theyre talking about
---
key word there is "  Daniel " Any support ticket answered by that guy might was well be thrown out, that support staff member needs fired. 
---
I had a dead scorchbeast fall down earlier in the mire, and once all of the whitespring bots were dying for seemingly no reason - just a buggy game tbh
---
If it involves material it would take not even a week like a day and a half since dupers got truckloads of mats 
---
I bought the Plan yesterday@level85 from the Vendome at Welch Station. Was Server hopping for MG42 Plans ... 
---
I saw that, something about durability being tied to Int. I can see how that might be significant with those energy weapons that break after two magazines (cells? batteries?.) 
---
All it needs is the Fat controller and Thomas... :)
---
i posted this somewhere else.
---
No  PC game from the time of x386 IBM compatible computers to date has not  had issues, especially them SoundBlaster drivers, Direct X and glitches  etc.  
---
Then, like now, there are forums, like this, where constructive  discussions between developers and players can meet to fix issues.  Patches, official or not are created and some games survive, and some  die.
---
Original gaming youtube channels  were an alternative to Gamefaq and similar “walkthrough” websites for  gaming solutions. They added to the community.
---
YongYea  and new toxic youtubers, simply read these gaming forums, call it  “research”, and negative issues are sensationalised for clicks. But they  give nothing back to the gaming community.
---
Will be interesting to see how this works out for you. I'm having issues like this also. I followed the power down and unplug for 10 minutes and turn it on suggestion and it also did nothing. Gonna delete some older saved files today see if it helps. 
---
This would mean you would probably want a server rejoin function.
---
Why ask my stock levels?? 
---
Do the characters have different stash/inventory situations?
---
A guy replied to me the other day stating his mule dcs itself and others pretty reliably as he's completely over burdened.
---
Support is just out of answers. It happens unfortunately. The ppl doing support aren't the coders so their knowledge base only goes so far
---
What´s the mats for crafting a low level one? I kinda like the idea. lol
---
Go to a computer and download the Bethesda launcher and sign into your Bethesda.net account and they will be there
---
Yeah, these are all solid, I especially feel the server jumping aspect is needs some sort of solution ASAP.
---
I hardly noticed bird bones doing anything except lower my strength. Besides with marsupial you can just jump vats target and basically teleport to your enemy negating the fall damage. My 2 cents
---
Thank you finally someone who gets it all i do now at lvl 256 is just carry my buds through missions they get stuck on and then go grind for the meta
---
In Europe, it is illegal to put a sale on a product if it has not been sold for it's original price first. I'm not sure if it applies to free items, but Bethesda got in trouble for it before when they started the flash sales in the Atomic Shop.
---
I bet you can put it in the bottom left corner of the nuke and hit the mutfruit fields as well for alot of cobalt. If you need it of course.
---
Good to know
---
Tag is same as username. Please add me. Currently lvl 4. Don’t get a lot of playing time. Not looking forward to pvp. 
---
I would like to have a container  i czn put stuff in that i dont need  so other players can check and take stuff  they can use 
---
This should have everything you need:  https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/72mS8mnzJ6UgSMo0GQIaQy/pre-order-fallout-76-on-pc-and-receive-the-fallout-classic-collection-for
---
Can't have it both ways, fallout 76 right now is the only survival game with a large safe stash. 
---
Damn u must be rlly lucky. It happened to me twice just now right after i made this post and the whole group of ppl there put up the angry and confused emote and started searching everywhere for the meat pile to no avail
---
On Xbox One, press start, then Left Bumper, then down on the D-pad nine times, then press A twice. Should fix the issue.
---
You can join them all. 
---
That’s fine. You don’t have to and I wasn’t expecting it. Frankly when people spout off these sort of absolutist comments they rarely can withstand any sort of debate.
---
They are though. Each one is unequivocally better than any other potential mod in its slot, that’s bad for game design and play. 
---
I was 200 meters east of the Crosshair. Hell and gone from anything. Came back to base to find it stripped to the studs, all crafting stations destroyed.
---
So yes, it does happen.
---
People seem to forget that just because this specific content was cut it wont mean that there wont be new exciting content for PvE as in new Nuke Bosses, Vault dungeons and events
---
Instead of we building it it could be we donate the materials needed and only the people that donate get a reward like an exclusive paint or something like that 
---
It would be a game-wide addition at this point not server based
---
Was thinking about making a purchase that's all ;)
---
This is so creative! 
---
You can do all the quests and it doesn’t effect your status in any other faction. You’re still a part of the responders freestates raiders enclave and brotherhood no matter what order you do the quests in 
---
Maybe a shop that sells human meat? 
---
Meh, it's just not the same if their clothes stay on. It was more fun when they would hit the ground in their underwear. (dammit, I can't find that skyrim video of some one live action taking people's inventory and they fall down naked. Just imagine I linked that here.)
---
Sounds like making a new fallout.. Fallout 77
---
the event seems really rare, i tried for a long time to find it, my first time doing it though i got the handmade plans
---
I do, a necessary evil. 
---
On the bright side you still get the perk card and mutation armor. Only reason its survivable. 
---
I almost never die (radiation and blowing myself up totally don't count, otherwise nvm)
---
You haven’t shown in all of that a valid reason why he is not weak for using a crutch of an overpowered weapon.
---
This game is not Destiny, in fact it’s so different I’m gonna say comparisons are gonna be very loose at best. And players are gonna meta hunt in any game, good luck stopping that. It’s just the way of games.
---
This is the wrong game for Duergar
---
You on the discord?
---
Not really sure the intent behind these themed atom store sets. But i will say i don't find this one really good.
---
Mind you alot of the atom store stuff seems pretty odd to me. Where is the psycho raider group themes, Fallout faction themes, max max style gear and heck where is that sexy doomguy outfit? Lol.
---
Throw some of these theme types and i would throw money at the store. But keep up with the childs play theme and just some of the less Falloutish things i don't see it worth the atoms.
---
Thanks! Check back in later this evening I may have updates. Hopefully not a "well 10 minutes in it crashed twice" message haha 
---
it's rather nice going there now peacefully collecting golf balls in my X01 
---
Harpers ferry too.
---
Thats where i got 3 of them on my alt.
---
 They show at Grafton Station, the Responder Vendor Bot in Grafton and Vendor Bot Chad at Camden Park. I have seen one on Wallace in Harper's Ferry as well.
---
I placed the Nuke right between Arktos Pharma and Helvetia. Arktos was full of Glowing Ones. Helvetia was full of level 68 scorched. 
---
CB05_QP_Fail
---
Sadness. Art fail. Not enough stuf. Better luck next time.
---
Who wants to bet this typo will make it into the game?
---
I'm glad Ixm not the only one who knows where the best source pf plastic in the game is. Shotgun shells for life.
---
But let’s say on one server you build up to 50% get dc’ed and then on another server it’s at 25%. What would be the point?
---
Harpers ferry is what I meant when I said free states. Couldnt remember location name. 
---
Definitely not putting me vack in the same server.
---
Sweet meet up.....
---
If i remember correctly when the Creation Club Survival mode for Skyrim SE first came out it was free for a week, then they started selling it for 500 credits, so i don't think that's illegal, or at least they have precedents of doing something like this even if it is
---
Inb4 *** glowing dreugar wrecks my base
---
Bethesda doesn’t even understand that TSE isn’t overpowered. That the shotgun is and they need to rework pellet damage cause each pellet does full damage and they shouldn’t.
---
They don’t understand that perks and Bobblehead and Magazine Exploit breaks pvp and is what making weapons op.
---
I don’t think they know there own game at times.
---
I also don’t believe they would be smart enough to manufacture a fake crisis to scare dupers.
---
They can’t even track dupers they are banning people who sale on EBay and been in dev room or have dev items. They rely on people reporting suspected dupers.
---
I love Bethesda and Fallout76.. I hope the game gets better..but I have a lot of Questions.
---
The germans are evolving
---
I've found the disarm the fallen bomb skill check...along with a perception check which (unfortunately) I missed by clicking though due to a swarm of SM. 
---
....is there any other skill checks?
---
I’ve modded all my legendary stuff?
---
 You poor guy. I have one on my level 40 X0-1 Torso and that ain't getting upgraded till I see another Jet Pack.
---
 I was not sure so I did the Helmet and lost the Red Light. ;(
---
Dont know exactly how many plans can spawn there, maybe 1 in 20? TSE droprate is like 1 in a couple 1000s or so.
---
Better yet, pvp missions that lead to a stockpile of human meat, it’s gotta come from somewhere.
---
They have a different mix of items, of course, but neither is at the stash limit or overburdened.
---
never used artillery, is it worth it?
---
Hnnn...this is kinda off topic so I won’t comment too much, but I do agree with the spirit of what you say - this game’s PvP was doomed to launch in a very poor state. Their bravado and sweeping claims made like “we will make griefers the content lol!” were very empty sounding, and ultimately shown to be absolute hogwash.
---
It is possible to balance a game around different stats. What you suggest is just the easiest way to balance games, which won’t work when we want to have them be more than that.
---
You know, Bethesda "says" they can tell who has more in their inventory than they should...... and are taking appropriate actions..... did they miss this person or are they just blowing smoke out their ass to make players scared? 
---
I'll bet they can't see how much anyone has in their inventory. If they did, then this problem wouldn't be around. 
---
Do these fellas just walk around overencumbered constantly or is there a new carry weight glitch
---
 Emojis are just a place holder on my PC. ;)
---
My boyfriend and I do this. It's a fun little added touch to the game.
---
This guy knows. 
---
I don't understand why they won't though thats the thing. 
---
I dont get it....
---
Why is say Blackbird one i love used on all of them but these two?. What exactly is the reason as to why?.
---
If anything i want to see them go back and fix this. I will always be salty about this and i would love to stop seeing yellow bumblebees everywhere.
---
I’m on Xbox as well, I can make you a few weapons and give you some stimpacks to help you out. Msg my GT- Xwolfpackleader 
---
Was wondering if anybody would make "The State" reference. XD
---
I'd expect an expansion / DLC pretty soon.  Also if you're using the OP TSE style weapons, that's why enemies are 'too easy'.  That's getting fixed shortly.  In your position, I started a new character and focused on all the crafting skills.  Then when that was done, I started a new character and focused on the type of weapons that I'd never normally used - after all if it's too easy with melee/rifiles, and everyone says energy weapons are garbage, to make it harder why not try being exclusively laser/plasma based?  It's grueling I tell ya.
---
What do you do in FO4 to keep it fresh?  Try a pistol only playthrough, right?  Same with FO76.  
---
Or you could pay attention to the changes they’ve already announced and actually be ahead of the curve when it’s kicking ass in a few months. 
---
What's in your stash?
---
Dump anything higher level than you. Don't hold onto PA parts.
---
For junk you should horde adhesive,springs,screws,gears early on. 
---
As for gear see if you can make some leather armor for your level. You'll need a bunch of leather so look out for ragstags, either in the open or find a place where they're hanging.
---
Around that level i was relying on hunting rifles and a fire axe for melee. 
---
What's your build like?
---
It's the Dupe of Earl, Duper Man, Shdoop by Salt-N-Pepa, The Dupey Brothers... and I'm done.
---
Honestly that's kind of amazing.
---
Umm well it's a Bethesda Fallout Weapon soooo it doesn't make sense, therefore it makes sense and errgo it just works. 
---
well go play stardew valley then or slime rancher that's fun
---
Yup, theres a destroyed assaultron just inside a certain bunker, below the catwalk.  Requires an int check to hear a message
---
&gt;ll ;)
---
cool, whats your psn ill add you now!
---
This is so well done! 
---
RADROACH QUEEN
---
And I’m hoping that they are actively looking into this and correct it.
---
 Still, I have noticed if you wait a bit, you get better results server hopping. I have done it a couple of times ;)
---
I made it to lvl 102, and i have still lots to do, gathering building plans, getting legendaries, modding all my power armor sets, searching for components..  And i launched 2 nukes so far.. 
---
What happens when one server succeeds and another server fails?
---
Justtkitten!
---
Instigating, Swing speed, reduced weight. 
---
Maybe bloodied if your running radicool. 
---
That's basically an Incinerator! Lobbing explode-y flame blobs! 
---
Play something else for a bit and come back to it in a day or two or after the next patch.
---
I run a melee build &amp; for it to work best I use an anti armor, swing speed. With perks I ignore all armor, swing 80% faster &amp; heal a lot of damage while having high health &amp; taking very little damage. 
---
I wouldn’t be opposed to be able to level up a weapon with materials and strip a weapon to de-level it as well. (Caveat being weapon with min level req like shotgun and gauss or power armor pieces has limits) All the people that got an all rise pre-lvl 50 would be grateful. Those rerouting their builds would then be able to twink out their character with existing gear. Imagine a lvl 15 with deleveled power armor a TSE weapon using the jet pack. 
---
Sounds fun
---
agility of 5 lets you sink the barrel in the daily barrel quest.  It's so weird they bothered to program the ability for their to be skill checks then did so little with them
---
Ill try that thanks!
---
what was your psn? im online
---
Savage Divide easily is the best.
---
Cazador's from New Vegas... *shudder* the nightmares that thing induced. 
---
IGN is Psyra. Have been searching for a quiet ingame group to dork around with.
---
I assume 'minimum' requirement is set for a reason.  If you don't meet the minimum requirement, how much time and effort do you expect them to expend trying to figure out why it doesn't work for you?  It may not be related, but I don't really have a problem with a company not supporting someone who specifically doesn't meet a fundamental minimum requirement like CPU, sorry.   About time for an upgrade anyway!
---
oh please really only TSE shottys and id say some rifles are overpowered TSE Heacy weapons come with heavy weight and hard to find ammo while TSE pistols are good but i would hardly call those OP and TSE breaks the tesla rifle and flamer type weapons and just turn them sub par vs an actual balistic weapin
---
I love the idea of the skins for ghouls etc, would love to play as a non feral 
---
Wish my wife played. Just about got her into super Mario odyssey, had legend of Zelda lined up next with Skyrim after that. Sadly it wasn't to be and we reverted back to super Mario ultimate.... 🙄 
---
No you are right man they launched the game with almost zero end game. I was decked and had the queen on farm very quickly after launch myself. 
---
But i found something to do that has brought me alot of happiness and joy. I made my own end game through the chat mod. I spend alot of time helping others, giving out items and trying to protect others from griefers. I say try because some of them can one shot me regardless of my setup.
---
Its really fun and makes me feel good man. I don't know what they have in store but i hope its a challenge. Because in very little time i became geared to the nines and it will take some serious challenges. To make the next content for end game not a cake for for alot of us.
---
And where's our junk-jet?  XD
---
I had full sentinel and assassins and it took 4 ppl shooting me with everything they got to bring me down.  And I could of fast traveled out at the time to make them start over lol.
---
If the bounty has SA armor your only counter is the same armor along with a counter weapon, or numbers on your side with appropriate weapons.  1 on 1 your dead, I killed so many ppl trying to claim the bounty it was hilarious and so broken.
---
If non SA bounty it just depends on your preference if ranges go chameleon, if up close go with the best armor you can muster and probably play The Who shoots first TSE game.  But in that situation the odds are in your favor as the have to tap back to aggro against you to do full damage.  Unless they run the bobble head glitch all though I’ve never seen it done I practice where it ignores slap damage but some swear it works.  If that’s the case only a Bethesda bug patch will save you.
---
I’m appearing offline right now, sending an invite

I had the mod attached to my PA torso and I was scrapping a load of armour junk and I wasn’t paying full attention to what I was doing 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I'm really worried about this. Right now all the high level players on the trading sub don't even want caps anymore because they are completely useless. They are only trading for TSE hunting rifles (that will stop in a few weeks when the novelty wears off), AAE/BE/TSE weapons, and sentinel+assassin's armor. If they don't fix the ridiculous sentinel + assassin's bullshit, this event will be a bunch of invincible people just hopping around spraying explosives at each other for 0 damage
---
You eber consider that it isn't a crutch? That maybe sometimes ita just fun to be OP. For example replaying a game like darksouls or god of war with all of your gear and abilities from your last play through. Seems to me maybe you are trying to compensate for a weak personality by telling strangers on the internet how bad they are because that somehow helps you convince yourself that you are somehow better than others and not just a troll with too much time,on their hands. You dont like his post? Thats fine, just say you disagree but peraonally insulting him without provocation just makes you look pathetic.
---
Cool idea, but impractical in almost every aspect. Ya this game needs a central hub. But the way you are saying to  make it happen just isnt possible. Maybe if the responders came back as a faction in the western side across the invisible wall in the river that could have a city or something. But some random user created town that becomes permanent? No
---
DEFINITELY miss local maps
---
I got mine at Welch Station, was really surprised because I was lvl 80-ish and thought they were level locked. 
---
Hey, if they could do it in Animal Crossing circa 2002, they could do it in FO76 
---
Honestly I myself, and I'm pretty sure others are ok with future new players not participating in this as it would push a storyline and show that things have happened before you joined. Bringing a more "immersive" though I hate saying it, experience. And it gives those of us here now some small type of bragging rights as well as a show of the work we've done. 
---
Train stations have the vendors. Theyre capped at 200 but theres different vendor factions. So whitesprings has several vendors but they share the same 200 cap pool. You just have to let go of stuff you wont use. Ammo is the biggest one cause it can add up without you noticing.  Inert flux, anything that weighs a pound more really.
---
Hmmf. Where's my "ahem" picture...
---
You have to join all of them regardless man the faction ties are not really a thing.
---
IGN shiningQuasar.  I like making drugs and sweet rolls.  &lt;_&lt;
---
In case nobody thought about it, I believe teams are limited to 4 to prevent players from sharing too many perk cards at once. It's not to annoy us :-) 
---
Dang it. I'd never heard of Slime Rancher and just now looked it up. It doesn't look as fun as what I was imagining.
---
Mire 100% shit is creepy and dark.
---
If anyone on Xbox needs someone to marry them I have a really nice clown outfit with a cloth sack and heart emote I think it would really add to the experience.  As a side note, I also do divorces and funerals for a reasonable price.
---
They have to do it in order to make faction warfare work properly imo. Anything less is half assing
---
Savage divide and cranberry bog
---
what build do you use?
---
Preach! 
---
The mire or toxic valley valley is desolate and feels wastelandey and the mire is unsettling and creepy
---
I like the forest, nice and calm. Noobs to hunt.
---
Unlikely. There are multiple servers running at all times. Sounds like just one is being taken offline. Maybe it's running hot or something. Could be  lots of things besides a patch if it's just one server. 
---
There was plenty up there that isn't PvP. They have mentioned faction stuff before potentially coming. It just isn't there to be datamined yet. The info there is about vaults so far has more or less pushed that they are dungeonesque and seemingly cooperative based. 
---
Well he’s getting banned in the next update 
---
I agree as when it works it's cool as fuck but it can't reach shit
---
Try some different builds :) Based on the last Inside the Vault, I expect some new content within the next month give or take. Did you notice all the ham radio laying around? I wonder if that's gonna be part of new content in the future
---
My favorite version of this is to kill something that's very high on a building, and walk over four stories beneath them and loot a random eyeball that fell from the heights.
---
I think lvl 1-30 is pretty difficult because of a lack of resources, but eventually you can get perks to ease some of the burden, both in terms of weight and item durability.  If your weapon is always breaking, invest in gunsmith or makeshift warrior to dramatically increase its lifespan.
---
First of all is stash management.  Are you storing extra weapons, armor and food?  Food and chems are really heavy.  Weapons are probably the biggest weight investment.  I carry two rifles on my person, a scoped and reflex sighted option for long shots and close quarters interiors.  I just have the armor I'm wearing and don't keep any weapons or armor stored.  For food and chems, I use Traveling Pharmacy 3 to reduce the weight of my rad and health chems to 10% of normal, which is extremely helpful.  In my stash is only 3 salisbury steaks and 5 purified waters for an emergency.  Carrying rad chems and stimpaks on my person is a 90% reduction in weight.  I also only carry the food and water I need.  If I have a dozen purified waters on hand and a few grilled meats, I don't pick up meat and veggies until I'm down to less than 5 water and 2 food items.  After a while you just learn what food and drink gives you the most bang for your buck.  Any omelet is light and provides good nutrition, and soups satisfy both hunger and thirst while being relatively lightweight.  I also limit myself to 100 units of most scrap, while further limiting myself to 50 scrap I don't use very often, like cork, gold, silver, crystal and circuits.  I only have 10 bone shards and fertilizer, because I almost never use them and fertilizer is heavy.  Stuff I commonly use, like lead for making ammo, I tagged for search and always pick up when I see the magnifying glass next to a combination wrench or rat poison.  I just dump extra scrap in a bag for someone else to find in case they're low on plastic, copper, etc.
---
Second is to specialize in something.  If you choose perks to specialize in a weapon type, you're going to be using less ammo, your weapons won't require as many hits to take enemies down, and you won't have a bunch of extra weapons and ammo bogging you down.  I personally like stealth and rifles, but maybe you like shotguns or baseball bats. For me, this is a pic of my general wandering loadout.  It's a mix of weight reduction and damage boosts.  [https://imgur.com/lxPbduh](https://imgur.com/lxPbduh)  I swap in defensive perks when involved in taking out very tough enemies with this setup. [https://imgur.com/M5n5ewD](https://imgur.com/M5n5ewD) 
---
A great resource for messing around with your perks and different playstyles is this player made site.  It allows you to redistribute all of a character's potential perk points and access to all perk cards.  I used it when making my rifleman character.  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
If you play on PC, (gamer name Shankwell) add me as a friend and I'll be happy to give you scrap you need, make or repair gear for you, mod out your weapons and give you a hand with quests so you can start to get a leg up and learn the systems of the game.  I hunt legendary enemies (they drop special gear) for my end-game, and I'm always happy to pass along quality weapons and armor I can't use.
---
Problem is my group has too much of itch trigger fingers
---
There's vendors scattered around. They're divided into factions.
---
Early game you'll have access to the raiders and responders vendor bots.
---
Flatwoods has a responder bot and sutton train station has a raider bot. 
---
There's also more train stations like the Morgantown one or grafton up north. Ash heap has a couple too.
---
Every train station has a stash box too
---
I believe it is +5 per toy to a max of 50. 
---
For what it is worth, rad resist is a semi-useless stat. You would like, like, 20000 rad resist to equal a hazmat suit or power armor.
---
Well shit I hope they implement that eventually. Right now the alien blaster is nothing but a novelty. Would be nice to be able to get more ammo it or make it better. 
---
I’ll forgo this for inside maps back
---
I dont need caps looking for legendaries in trade
---
Go to g2a or mmoga and buy a key for 18$ ;)
---
Agree some friends collect all the legendaries the group finds on very low level mules to later sell.
---
If they were all two shot exploding legendaries then that is suspect for how rare they drop and likely duper’s. 
---
I actually hope this becomes a feature, but I'm not too sure how I feel about people just coming in and taking your weapons, we should be able to unlock the hand scanner as a lock so thatd limit it to certain people who have access to your stuff, you can alter which players can unlock these scanners via terminal 
---
Only time I filled up a tub was with all the bodies in Covenant after they went aggro
---
What's a stealth bot?
---
Aesthetically i like the heap and bog the most.
---
Central camp location wise i go savage divide in the southern area.
---
"there's no content left" oh please, then play another game. If they've played 500 hours of Fo76 until there's apparently nothing left to do (bull crap, have some imagination) then you clearly have time to start a new game and leave people alone. 
---
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'd love to see it fixed too. In a perfect world a thread like this wouldn't need to exist. 
---
I'm inclined to believe that for whatever reason, when they created the model for the excavator, it wasn't designed in such a way as that it's "skinnable," for whatever reason. Some traits or properties necessary to apply different paint jobs were never included in its design. If so, that's unfortunate, but what the heck. What I suggest still provides some options, you know? 
---
Usually last longer for me. I've had mine a good 10-30+ minutes. Maybe it last longer depending on how long you stick around the nuke zone.
---
Yeah you are exactly right. I don't mind pvp. But it's definitely not what I wanted from the future and didn't expect it to be such a huge part of there plans. 
---
The lunch boxes. Yes we all know what theyre trying to hide.
---
Just definitely not excited for it 
---
A TSE hunting rifle huh? Nice, should be able to trade that for anything you want!
---
Did they change something? I’ve used photo mode many times while playing instruments 
---
Almost every legendary they had were tse
---
You’re either using chameleon armor or have chameleon mutation , you go invisible when not moving and the armor triggers when crouched 
---
You either have the chameleon mutation or a chameleon armor piece. Not a bug
---
It usually says there's no room for the camera? In my experience anyway 
---
Bad sync ingame, someone comes along and murders all the mole miners at Place X, then someone teleports in, and for them they see the mole miners alive, but then their game talks to the server and the server goes, "You ain't lissnin' boy, I say you they -dead-.", and then the client goes "Oh," and ... suddenly they dead.
---
wait does the flamet eject casings
---
nani
---
I am down for the suggestion if its our only choice. But its reaaaaallly wierd man because i have seen posters in game of this amazing red and black skin of the excavator and i have always wanted it.
---
Someones got jokes
---
Each point of str is 5% dmg so it's not much. I run it on melee and suppress it only when I want to max my strength which is rarely necessary. I honestly find about half of the str stacking damage perks unnecessary for most queen fights, she still dies in two landings and 1 str doesn't really change that.
---
Yeha i would like to see more intense coop defend events 
---
“Just holding it for a friend”, right? Damn junkies!
---
Could that have been in game enemies? 
---
I'll give it a shot for sure. I've been to the power plant, but never the town. Any legendary spawns?
---
Bit disappointed it buggers up the ui when viewing the pipboy
---
No problem, have a great day/night
---
&gt;This printer does not respond to your input
---
Even the devs made a note to include that lmao
---
Yup and there is lots of ghouls 
---
They aren’t catching people duping, they appear to be finding players with 50 million bobble heads and banning them. So even if a player moved the bobble heads around, if the stack is massive it was probably from duping and the account gets banned.
---
I haven't noticed it being a big problem on PS4, but have seen others sa differently. I did experience a frustrating crash yesterday. Was wandering around in the blast zone when it crashed. I logged back in, but not into a blast zone. 
---
Clarifications helps. When the dude makes a post that says 'got me banned', and is posting on a Fallout forum, it's heavily implied that the ban is from Fallout/Bethesda, which as I stated would have been ridiculous. If it's a console ban then fair enough, still sounds stupid to be banned over the use of 'fuck' but I don't use consoles it's not my problem.
---
Also, I have no reason to 'calm down' because I was never angry in the first place. I pointed out that something doesn't make sense. Maybe take a moment to reflect on your own state when you're reading emotions from others in a text forum? xD
---
Its north of whitesprings. Cant remember exact name but its a train yard
---
 imvited you to a team, join and we can join a world together
---
You can't sell mods?  I'm pretty sure you can. 
---
 I have my CAMP on the cliffs to the west of Watoga. A lot of ponds on several levels and some great places. Still I like the area around Harper's Ferry a lot and will eventually move there. Its just so convenient for farming Watoga where I am now.
---
“Hubba hubba”
---
Just tells me I can’t join someone in a current world
---
Bunch of butt hurt people around here I see 
---
This is disappointing.  Not because I can't play the game, but because the difference here between the recommended (i5 3.5GHz) and mine (i5 3.4GHz) is so small as to be meaningless, and the issue is so clearly not a hardware issue.  If it were, it would apply to the entire game - not just one character.
---
I have patiently ignored the bugs, the server crashes, the frequent instances of my entire group - from all over the country - receiving simultaneous 'lost connection to server, controls locked' messages repeatedly.  I've ignored the disappearing items, the glitches, and everything else.   I've been a Bethesda fan for a long, long time.  I've sold so, so many people on their games, between the OO/GG Morrowind Disk and DarkUI for Oblivion that got mentions in both PC Gamer and PC Gaming World back in the day, to online communities where I've helped dozens of people play their games, to friends and family.  I've defended Bethesda so much over the years, including this game.  Hell, I defended  the horse armor once or twice!
---
I'm done.  This game is just so broken, and refusing support over an irrelevant technicality crosses the line - although some may say that it's justified.  I've pre-ordered every Bethesda game since pre-ordering was a thing.  I won't be, not anymore.  I'll be waiting for the 70% off sale like everyone else.  
---
And it's heartbreaking.
---
I loved this quest. 
---
No spoilers: At the house there’s a picture on top of a unit, I had to snap a pic as it hit me in the feels, it pops up every now and again on loading screens. 
---
That's forsure
---
So is your feel good moment assuming they were base wrecking and you were able to white night some strangers to steal their stuff for self bounty claiming?
---
400 bounty doesn’t sound like much, usually a single base if I raze one is an easy 1000 bounty.
---
But if 4 couldn’t take you down then I suppose they had it coming lol.
---
It was corrected two shot is being nerfed to 20% and explosive to 25% numbers may be switched. But they're not removing it.
---
I came across a lv 330 with a fat 1000+ caps bounty while I was in the train station. I had TSE Gatling Gun with full rank of demolition expert with bloody mess and he survived. So I was wondering what the heck was he running?
---
Sweet, I'll check that out for sure. How quick do you normally level by staying there? I'm level 109 now, but I need a lot of levels to get my new build. I really, really hate to start a new character with all the work I've put into my current one, but I also don't wanna grind for months to get those levels lol. 
---
Oh derp. That makes sense
---
Can confirm it is there, this is where I got mine.  Also all the BoS combat armor mods, from the same vendor.  I had to hop for days.
---
I feel called out.
---
That would be such a badass way to heal your team with the Friendly Fire perk.
---
Yea train yard north of whitespring gc. Theres 3-4 safes in there and you can also get the  the Faschnacht Man mask in there as well.
---
Yup.
---
Shocks 500 plus mats, 1500 if I provide mats.
---
I like every region really. Toxic Valley being probably my least favorite. I feel comfortable in Watoga (after Mayor for a Day) and Forest. Ash Heap was also really cool with that "miasma" atmosphere. The Mire was the place where I felt more uncomfortable. 
---
Going through the Road from the Palace up north all the way east and then south to Watoga was my favorite exploration part of the game.
---
Wow I can’t believe people just walk around the waist land with spoiled fruits who do they think they are 
---
It’s hard to say as I get bonus xp and such just make sure you sleep take xp boosting items etc perks the like
---
Some are guarantee, but these ones I couldn’t find
---
Yes it could have.  I am guessing people who come here to complain automatically are thinking its humans destroying their bases.   When in fact it could be a couple rats.
---
ya that would definatly be cool.  Dose anyone know if you can place the lawn gnomes and where to find the prints for the flamingo?
---
psn: Silune
---
always game to meet new people.
---
But... it's not reality. Aren't we supposed to downvote badly written or poorly researched comments?
---
Wait, there's an assaultron companion in 4?
---
Careful going near him if you don't have any Disease Cures on you.
---
Dont you get notified if a player is attacking your camp? 
---
Im not into the whole against or for the nerfing of the TS to be honest. 
---
I've never been into using the op guns in any of the fallouts. 
---
Kind of kills the point of survival and deciding whether to fight or flee
---
And for the amount of hours I've put in I've got a TS cryolator. So doesn't bother me. I have barely invested anything into a specific build and I'm doing fine being a lone wanderer..
---
But at the same time I could see why it pissed certain people off, but it's all trial and error in these types of games. Nerf, boost, nerf, boost, it's kind of a constant thing throughout the life cycle of the game IMO
---
For sure, I'll give it a shot tonight. Thanks!
---
Can you provide a link about how they got in trouble with the flash sales?
---
I started this fight deliberately by attacking his workshop. But I only attack someone's workshop if I'm close to their level. If I see someone 30 levels lower than me has the workshop, I let them have it, because I don't want to bully them.
---
If you still have this camp, could you make a video showing how to build it?
---
Not gonna happen. Get used to how PvP is now, because it won't change any time soon.
---
While viewing the pip boy hit the 1st person/3rd person change view button and you will see the quick boy. Looks much better while in chameleon. I like it as well cause it's easier to see what's going on around you while in the menus.
---
My friend and I just got disconnected in the launch room. He was already annoyed about the grind to get there and now I don't think he'll ever want to play again. I'm not far behind him on that front.
---
I would like to be able to shoot some hoops
---
All energy weapons break extremely quickly for no understandable reason, except for the Tesla and Gauss rifles.
---
Can confirm I just got mine. Thanks!
---
No. You already get free Atoms in game. The rate they put in items you have more than enough time to save up once you complete the one time challenges. 
---
This is true, Fallout 76 could very easily be the issue from the beginning since people are reporting even more crashing issues since the latest update. Just you are thankfully tech savvy enough to actually give us the error code so we have a little insight into possible causes which we can follow a flow chart down.   
---
I had a very similar issue with I think was Fallout 4 or maybe Skyrim SE when I had them on my 850 SSD, same drive as you looking back now, solved by updating all my drivers, my bios, and switching the bay the SSD was in. I also forcefully assigned read/write privileges to the system admin profile, but that might not be necessary and a little extreme in the first place. 
---
They just nerfed it it used to be way better
---
Have everyone turn on pacifist mode, that way you cant hurt each other. 
---
I am not sure wich one of you who needs the Snickers the most.
---
I built my camp on the very peak of Seneca Rocks once... it got raided by a guy that glitched his base inside of a mountain.
---
I'll settle for this... 
---
[Step Off](https://youtu.be/94dyikITfE0)
---
All energy weapons are like this with the exception of the Tesla and Gauss rifles.
---
I think you mean that shack between Vault 76 and Tyler County Fairgrounds. At least I think it was there. Found a place like you described when I scouted out the western part of the forest a while ago.
---
First off you write like a pompous snob. Second your free back on events was really weak. 
---
For the special events the palace of the winding path when nuked should have a massive super mutant rumble. None of those piss poor lvl 68 and some majors. I want to see lvl200-500 monsters around all over and 3+ star ancient behemoth's lvl 500 ready to be destroyed by expert organized clans willing to get the good drops. Since the updates loot drops have been more misses then hits
---
"Top Tier" Power armor with 450 DR?
---
That's actually kind of low.
---
My T-51b at 200% condition has 581/514 Resistances (If I remember the EXACT amount), and combined with my Scaly Skin Mutation, I run around Nuke zones with 630/564 Resistances.
---
I have 1 TSE handmade, but I never use it. Okay, I lied. I have. Once. On some asshole who was grieving my buddies. That’s it though. I mainly use melee weapons with the occasional sniper. I definitely will give a new character a shot. I never cared for the VATS / stealth build. So I’ll give that a shot.
---
Maybe even a NV throwback with the Yao Guai Gauntlet
---
I'm only cheated once with pockets so i can carry more but that is it.
---
For some reason I accidentally hit alt (PC) whenever I friendly fire by mistake... and lob a grenade. I have no idea how it happens, but I’ve done it about 5 times now. Very embarrassing. 
---
it drives me mad
---
I have a stealth rifle build and mainly use it for the agility bump to stealth detection.  The fall damage is helpful.  I can only fit 2 ranks of class freak into my build, but 10 less carry weight isn't really bothering me.
---
I got marsupial as my first accidental mutation.  The carry weight was awesome, but I feel like the mario jump is kinda cheesy.  You can just jump on top of a school bus and a horde of ghouls can do nothing to you.  It took a lot of the drama out of combat, so I got rid of it.  A game isn't fun for me longterm when I always win without any skill involved.  Sometimes I do wish I still had it when falling into a ditch in cranberry bog.
---
Why am I picturing a deathclaw wearing a long coat coming up to me saying "whatcha buying?"
---
And there are tree houses (I really like tree houses) 
---
1. Xbox One X
---
2. Sic Pyromaniac
---
3. N/A
---
4. When I start a game I have 475 carry weight (correct), if I start in my power armor (excavator). If I exit it, or start the game out of it, I start at 335. Then when I get back into it, it goes to 375 instead of back to 475. It also happens if I die. Its been happening since the december when the last power armor glitch was fixed. So every time i need to craft something or repair something, I have to do it, get back in, and then server hop. Please fix. Thank you.
---
5. N/A
---
Some people just get lucky. I don't ever get shit there.
---
How do you creaton a new character?
---
I'm sick of this. Im level 20 and want to check out white spring but EVERY server I go to has higher level players there. I spawn in and irradiated ghouls rip me apart, not to mention riddle me with disease. On top of it, the other players take my mountain of junk I spent an hour collecting. Hard work down the drain, why? You cant tell me Bethesda can't figure out a way to scale enemies fairly. 
---
I'm five minutes from tossing this game in the trash.
---
For me it would have to be the mire cause treehouse and glowing mushrooms at night just wish there were more bioluminescent plants in the mire 
---
Unfortunately that's not it, as it was a shack with safes both inside and out, not a vault. :/
---
Thanks for your help tho, now I have that daft mask!
---
Im level 81 and I have the same problem. However today I was helping  a level 5 through whitespring and I killed a legendary ghoul who dropped a great gauss rifle damage 390. Casually doing stuff until dlc comes along.
---
That man is a liar!  Tar and feather him!
---
But sometines funny
---
And with a good weapon you don’t even need to sneak.
---
Sneak into golf clubhouse and kill a few ghouls, suddenly they all can see you for some reason...I could just run outside into the Parking lot and enter stealth again and lose them...or I can run out the door, turn, enter VATS, and headshot them as they come through with none ever reaching me alive regardless of if they a charred, bloated glowing, wendigos or whatever.
---
Boom headshot, boom headshot, etc.
---
Yes I like it. 
---
We were cheated from helping a robot make art [😭](https://imgur.com/fme8RpP.png)
---
Haha nice...i think, that mask is freaky!
---
Oh they could have done it. It would have been a great way to join a faction and an even better incentive to PvP.
---
 Oh that guy is a raider, I am with the BOS, time to fight for control of resources.
---
From the main menu --&gt; Character --&gt; new 
---
I can sculpt my character, name roam around a little but when I get the pip boy and go to open the door it disconnects me.
---
We did the toxic dry lake bed yesterday. Not bad! Plenty of cobalt flux. 3 legendary mirelurk queens and quite a few scorched coming from the fair grounds.  I'm glad there's no longer just one useful option. 
---
This is a common mistake many people make but I'll help you through it. You do not put a question mark before "or". You can't start a sentence that way. Remove the question mark, it is the same sentence. It's a common mistake among my students. They do it to emphasize their pacing but it is completely wrong, you do that with a comma. 
---
Very well done and incredibly clever! Giving me inspiration for things in the future.
---
I've heard scorched beasts, including the queen have higher DR while in flight.  I've don't recalling seeing anything to confirm this one either though.
---
Lost a t-60 jet pack and Tesla torso mod to this goddam glitch omg I was livid!!! 
---
Typo stealth boy
---
They already jump on your face if you get too close
---
I was kidding, you spelt creating weird
---
Yeah I went for the golf course today and instead of ghouls there were dozens of diseased protectrons to fight. At least I didnt catch rad worms.
---
I just want a laughing emote
---
Yeah this was super disappointing when I realized it wasn't possible. Showing off your collection would be something really worthwhile that this game could have offered.
---
Persistent world's with everyone's personal museum everywhere, that's the dream.
---
Yeah I found them and gave one to the person I play with too plus her camp is right beside it and they respawn every once in a while so you can resell extra ones you find.
---
&gt; personally insulting him without provocation just makes you look pathetic.
---
Either that is true and you are guilty of the same, which btw I did notice you did in your first post and I had the courtesy to ignore it and consider your actual points - a courtesy you have definitely not extended to me and in fact if anything you have stepped up your attacks - or it is not true, and there is something more. In your case you seem very personally offended because you keep attacking. I’ll refrain from commenting on that but you really should ask yourself why you are so upset about this. It is really making a proper discussion with you difficult as I can’t tell where you’re just indulging in whatever that is or making a point I can respond to.
---
Also I’m not insulting him. I’m literally saying his gaming is weak if he has to use OP stuff. There’s no vitriol or emotion here. It’s just an observation he needs to up his game, which I said he should do.
---
I’m gonna cut you off because you’re getting a little too rambunctious with the insults. I’m gonna have to ask you politely to please stop and either give it a rest or come back after you’ve cooled down. Do it again and I will have to report you. Ok?
---
I'm planning on making my next char exclusively a commie bopper melee build.
---
Haven't decided yet if I'll keep it stock , or bladed...
---
Thank you for the information, did not notice that :)
---
Play another game? (no offence) 
---
Oh haha 
---
If you can shoot them from out of range for the server to sync and kill them you can kill them and get loot
---
I think it’s a matter of whether you want to be battered with rads for the entire fight or not, I don’t think her DR changes
---
This would be amazing. Would feel like theres a benefit long term from being around for the events.
---
I have killed the queen 50+ times and have never heard or seen anything about that before. But then again it would not be the first time a player claims something for a fact that he has zero proof for. Guy-guessing...
---
Not sying it is not true but I have not seen anything suggesting it is true. Yet.
---
Yeah i loved that too, ha awesome dude!
---
Is there another wedding ring in the game? I think the one in that Final Pam house is the only one.
---
Always worth picking one up when you're in the area. It sells for quite a bit. 
---
Thank you so very much!! This is so so helpful
---
U don’t want explosive flamer lol it kills u more than heals
---
Imagine needing to dupe dog food and radaway because there just isn't enough of that lying around in the world
---
I’m not sure if that’s true, but it is definitely easier to aim at her when she’s landed - and melee players can also add their damage to the mix. So that’s probably all that’s going on.
---
Yeah - happened to me yesterday :/. Just dropped off all my junk and waited, fellow named Loki-something got rid of my wanted status.
---
It IS nice! Hubby and I are wearing them and like that a lot while taking pictures along our wasteland adventures.
---
Then you must have not dealt with many problems, because In my experience at least 50% of problems are solved by turning off and back on, but I also never call customer service to solve my problems.
---
...
---
Bethesda has already agreed they are OP and are balancing them soooo I’m not really gonna comment further on this. But you do you, if you want.
---
I pick a spot depending on the flux I'm hunting
---
Yeah, I also don't understand the logic behind multiple cards for the same skill-- Hacker, Lockpick, etc. Just have one card with multiple levels.
---
Actually, I’ve been popping rad-x diluted and a glowing blood pack and strapping on some mix match unyielding armor and dealing like 3000+ damage per hit, 10000+ with ninja (unarmed bloodied build)
---
I saw it this morning, but by the time I got there, it was completely bugged out (Event marker on the map, no way to actually start the Event).
---
I just want new content and story development.
---
You are wrong.
---
It may be the materials all need to come from the same source, as the other poster said, as well I think it required rubber but didn’t list it, I was having the same issues and I think rubber allowed me to make the left leg, and then everything in stash let me make the right. 
---
Someone's been playing too much =) 
---
Sounds great
---
Heck, I've probably gotten around 10k without spending a dime.
---
They've also announced content coming out in a weekly-ish basis from February onwards that sounds more like pve stuff. 
---
Literally mentioned in the same article that they clarified the upcoming pvp mode. 
---
&gt;Full sets of duped armor which could get nerfed. At what point does buyer confidence erode? If you put down the $40 and then your armor gets nerfed hard, how likely would you be to put down real money ever again?
---
Same applies for Bethesda right. I doubt people are paying real money for ingame stuff often. I mean any single player. There's a lot of players so there's enough buyers too. I browsed the sold listing and it's crazy how much some people are selling.
---
&gt;Apart of making the game succeed is for it to have a successful in-game economy.
---
It kinda has, some kind, it's also quite a mess, and really frigging tedios to set up trades. Vending machines, when properly made, can improve it a lot. Not really great that they weren't mentioned in next update.  Also not all online games have any economy. The stuff happening on Ebay ect has no influence on Bethesda selling Fallout 76 and Atoms. Who are paying for ingame items? People who are playing the game.
---
If you're on ps4 send me an invite. Im looking at the junk pile right now
---
Do people realize that this is a little bit of datamined/cut-content, and that it doesn't necessarily imply it's the only thing we're going to get in the future?  
---
Jesus Christ, you guys.
---
I was like damn that's a good roll.
---
+50 dmg res while stationary
---
Double shot
---
You're basically god.
---
Medlilove over here :) 
---
We need an emote for "it just works"?  XD
---
Well I guess my problems are just worse then, none of my problems have ever been fixed by a reboot.
---
As a mutated Free States member, I think you're both bad ideas.
---
I didn't write anything directed to him, I wrote you to.
---
Report me bud. Didnt break the rules.
---
Yep, that still just people saying yep I was banned or my third cousin twice removed was banned. No actual proof
---
In my experience, regular flamers degrade condition at the same rate.
---
Oh my bad, but still, mixed with the right armor 500 - 600 DR/ER is achievable without PA
---
I like the idea of PvP loadouts. Allowing any kind of competitive PvP with the current fuckery of TSE spam and assassin's + sentinel gods would just be pathetic
---
Unarmed Bloodied
---
Bingo, found it!
---
Travelled to the Fairgrounds, walked towards the vault a little and took a hard left at the red and yellow cars!
---
I think I've walked past it at least 3 times today.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Those silos, sigh. Three identical?? Wasted opportunity.  Though have you noticed sometimes they are weak and a walk through and other times they are a complete face rape? Yesterday i did one in a L42 char with a L62 friend (his first time) and it was such a disappointment
---
PC, but thanks for the offer!
---
Found it now btw.
---
That is awesome. I'll be looking for that place tonight when I get on. 
---
Last gen consoles had games with destroyable buildings... 
---
Why are people calling content 'cut'?. Isn't it pretty safe to assume that at some point this stuff will be in the game? How do you cut things from a work in progress?
---
Deathclaw has the wares, if you have the coin.
---
Yes please, the animation when you trade could be him opening his coat
---
Mate you can get 25k caps plus more don’t let anybody screw you on a deal 
---
Or a pact of duck tape, either can do. 
---
I just wanna play poker until I get kicked out of every casino. 
---
I've resolved this same issue by logging out of the world and then in again.
---
Do you know of any others like this?
---
Glitch
---
Put as much junk in your stash box as you can
---
(At the very least, what you need to repair with)
---
The D is for Dross.
---
Great! My camp is just a little NE of there on a cliff. Good spot to check back on, lot of plans spawn there and in those safes
---
Dude that’s sucks balls!!! It took 146 tries to get mine I’ve been back over 200 times and still haven’t seen another one again. At w/s a random Player offers to sell me one wants 9k in caps It’s insane.m!!!!Good luck .
---
Uh... the responders. Duh. Walking defenseless "help everyone" meatsacks. Their begging to be robbed and eaten. 
---
Same problem on Xbox. 
---
None so drawn out. There’s some stories scattered around about drug addiction, and family disputes, but they’re not so much quests as paper trails. I hope there’s more though.
---
I am still waiting for that special person I can call my ghoulfriend...
---
So much disappointing emphasis on PvP and competitive content.
---
No, the devs have to make some extra money SO I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS. Free things means we get no updates and free dlc 
---
I just wish pacifist would stop me from targeting friendlies in VATS. 
---
I already rp a firebreather at flatwoods/general forest region. Help out newbies and stuff. 
---
Haha yeah, I’d love to see some poorly disguised raiders dressed as responders leading players into the meat grinder.
---
The loot will get better up to lvl 50, after that you only get lvl 50 gear. And if you're referring to the quality of the legendary effect no those are completely random
---
You don’t need Four Luck Clover with 15 Luck and Critical Savvy, every other shot is a crit. I just hold down the crit button and spray shots to the head. 
---
I dont get how people have fun with this
---
Yes would love this! I've also noticed certain outfits and accessories are named the same but don't stack because they are different colors, hard hats are one that come to mind. Small text changes like this would make a huge difference for inventory managment and collecting :)
---
What’s weird is this sounds like it could be a vault story. Manufactured crisis, research how people react. Goes wrong, everybody dies. You find it, loot it, find a cool gun inside. Find out overseer escaped and get a quest to find him. He’s in New Vegas, doing limes off Fisto’s ass. Yes, limes. He’s way messed up after that vault thing.
---
Alright. Maybe that last bit is just my writing and not Bethesda.
---
Theres a video on this reddit page showcasing a raider dressed as a responder leading idiots to a furnace death trap. 
---
Dude's using Rad-X diluted, I'm not sure he knows how to play
---
Ambrose 86 is my GT. I will be on later this evening. Feel free to add me and I will message you to set something up. Thanks in advance.
---
[Star Trek Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHcN4Gm8tzM)
---
Oh I saw that it was such a good idea, I’d love to see more... creative traps though.
---
I've played over 200 hours for a 70$-ish game; that's a nice return on investment for a game (IMO); I only play one game at a time (uninstalled FO4 as soon as I knew I could play FO76)
---
Maybe you are just a better player than most of us "casual" players; I'm at level 115, still have a lot to do in the game, still need to find better gear to be able to go launch a nuke and go help kill a SBQ.
---
You could start again a play a different character, play unarmed, play naked, play with pipe weapons only, play with only non weapon oriented perks ... or play with no perks allocated at all.
---
Never ever seen them.
---
West Tek actually makes a lot of sense. Haven't found a location that kicks my ass as hard as that building. Just a never ending stream of level 60+ mutants. 
---
 That's really all I've been getting ..level 45s and 50s. Can't use any of it yet..usually I just try to give it to the guys actually doin the work...I'm just trying to level up quicker to use some of this stuff. Most of the time they don't want it..hence my question. Do they get a legendary out of it too or am I stealing? I would like to know..this communtiy has been awesome and I don't want to be THAT dickhead
---
Anti armor is great for robots and super mutants I'd buy that from you if I had more caps on me lol
---
Pitfall traps like rust would be nice. Or more primitive, like your walking through the forest near v76 and fall through a false floor to spikes. If they increased camp size a bit, and camp traps did full damage to nonteammates. 
---
Level 70 here, just some guy who likes to build C.A.M.P.s, sell Purified Water and hoard materials over my stash weight limit :P
---
Add me: **v4l_c0d**
---
I've seen scorched pick up weapons from containers/enemies. I assume a crowned mob dropped it and the scorched picked it up. I once got attacked by a scorched one-handing a harpoon gun
---
Same here. Animals are not tied to anything.
---
Changing server,moving camp/deleting it doesn't work. Taming a different animal only adds another 10% to the budget(so ulterior budget lost when dead).
---
The drops depend on the creatures level they came from
---
&gt;I'd expect an expansion / DLC pretty soon.
---
I wouldn't. Three months later and the game is still plagued with bugs. I could see an expansion possibly 6+ months from now.
---
I spent a lot of time crafting in camp and taking over/defending workshops. So having 3 to 4 workshops at a time and bouncing between them farming the enemies and locations. Having Poseidon Plant online helps with that.  The Toxic Valley spawns should be challenging enough and grant better xp then the forest.  Get Poseidon up and running then take over that workshop, then Gorge Junk yard, hemlock maintenance, and sunshine meadows.  You'll be busy and loaded up for a few hours. You'll also get plans for better weapons and armor allowing you to take on mobs that are 5 to 10 levels above you with little issue. I did very little quest before level 40 since the rewards are level based. Ie the level 10 armor you get for doing a little quest in the forest when your a level 12 ends up being a level 40 armor if your a level 41 when you complete it.  
---
1 star legendary dog drops worse crap than 3 star legendary mirelurk Queen, and 98% of legendary stuff isn't worth carrying to a vendor
---
Ouch...
---
plz make it purple too
---
That would be awesome I’d love to see these added to the pvp servers. It would seriously spice up camps.
---
I find the extent to which most of this seems to focus on PVP to be really depressing.
---
Yeah seen a few roleplayer groups lurking on the chat mod. Don't remember the clan name though. 
---
I use it for my shotgun. Every shot is a crit
---
Oh much more than that, if you min-max! See my updated edit!
---
It is pretty straight forward to install mods, download the files and Extract the ChatMod.ba2 file to your Fallout 76 Data folder (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net 
---
Launcher\games\Fallout76\Data).
---
The part that mist people get stuck on is the INI file. When you go to download the files from the website, under Optional Files there is a download called "Fallout76Custom.ini For New Users". This needs to be downloaded and copied to your "My Games" folder (default: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76). 
---
The reason why this file is downloaded separately is because once you have an INI file you can just edit it for any other mods you want to use but as this is your time one you can just copy and paste it from the download.
---
Good luck!
---
Don't worry this is posted atleast 3 - 5 times a day lol. 
---
don't forget deathclaw island is an easy to get to romantic getaway with picnic blanket and all. for that special someone
---
Jesus. What platform? I'll be your friend.
---
NIRA has one fast travel location, but three points of interest - 
---
The fast travel point (northmost), the warehouse (a bit south of that) and the office (a but south of that again. If aiming for west tec, rather than center on it, try to land it so that the NIRA fast travel point is *just* on the outside of the circle, but its warehouse and office building is inside. Last night, I really wish they had clipped the warehouse too. 
---
I always pictured Grafton or the capital buildings as the perfect place to make a hub
---
well, for starters in the story line you give yourself the cure / inoculation... something the others worked so hard to find. Also, they aren't all dead just no longer in West Virginia / Vault 76 area. DLC will add this I'm sure.
---
Stability has been getting worse not better.  I swear I’m done playing this game (I’ve said this 1000 times but I mean it this time..........he says as he boots the game up again).   
---
495k disease cures 😂 they are pesky but damn, not that pesky
---
With Vanguard armor of the right type, you could hit some silly DR numbers. Back it up with some Dodgy and Lone Wanderer, gets real silly. I only have about 300/300 DR with those perks and I can park myself in front of the SBQ. I do have some Blocker as well though. I need to get Fireproof as well cause I heard it works on scorchbeast blasts, and I’d like to test that.
---
I've tested grendier and demolition expert with the grenade auto launcher and there is a significant diff. Between handheld grenades and the launcher. I see no increase with the launcher.
---
I would just like to see more helmets with a built in light. Having to trade off being able to see, and looking half decent sucks.
---
Good idea, will try that! Have to move my camp from its doorstep first =) 
---
Is that a location? Definitely wanna try it. Also wanna try around charleston, that giant patch of just sand. Unless that is the toxic lake bed. 
---
Seen this suggestion so many times i have lost track.
---
My reply never changes.
---
Yes, yes and god dang it yes please can we have this lol. Let me sit my lad down and sort my inventory out. :)
---
"  As a player who will farm as little as possible  "
---
Stopped reading here. Why should you be on a level playing field with someone who has put in more work and effort for better gear?
---
I say by the end of Feb. Thousands caps on it? =) 
---
I saw a level 840 once. This was like three weeks ago too. No god damn idea how he got that high but I assume exploiting was involved 
---
Did you bulk the components? 
---
Put mats in your stash it's a bug. Seems if some is in stash and some in bag it doesn't work 
---
I really want to imagine that they would have  the liberators' "legs" animated working the controls and not just a static "head" piece.
---
I'm all for a spray can or something I can Jet Set Radio Future my way around. It would certainly add some fun to the repatition of taking workshops if I could also claim them in the name of me and mine or simply tag raider logos etc ... you get frames for photos as you progress in each factions story so why not add more. Me and mine are all with you 100%.
---
I'll make sure to do that again if I ever see him. Thanks
---
Can't you just wear a bandana?
---
They do it that way so they can fix your ability to pick level three locks to a certain character level. 
---
I'll take you up on that bet. You on PS4?
---
Was thinking that giant sandy area near charleston. I doubt anything interesting will happen. I know the capital will have a shit ton of overlord / warlord supermutants. 
---
Even so we should be mad at Bethesda for releasing this game in the state it was in, you can’t really blame him for being pessimistic about Bethesda after all the lies Todd constantly spews 
---
I see your point, I suppose it would have to be a nice reward. I feel like there are already a few experiences of defending against AI, just wondering if they could create an experience that makes use of all the traps and defensive structures. Workshop defense events just dont seem worth the effort of setting those things up.
---
Glad I could help. :D
---
Probably Improved = 20%, Superior = 40%. Calculated that from some PvP, data, and someone datamined the same numbers.
---
I mean they also clearly did it as an easy fix to prevent people from dumping hundreds of trash items they collected that now would have to be rendered and have physics applied to them as if they were just any other unique object laying across the world and drop the server. Even just a few people with no bad intentions dropping a large but reasonable number of things into the world could cause sudden, massive server stress. As if their server infrastructure wasn't flimsy and exploitable enough already.
---
The in game economy has been totally ruined by duping. And how can you say it's only kind of important. I'd love to build someone a camp for caps. However, if they're paying me in caps from duped nuka cola, that completely invalidates my time and effort, perhaps several hours, in building them a camp.
---
Part of salvaging this mess is to shut down the selling of duped items for either caps or cash.  I am postulating that nerfs targeting highly sought items might be one avenue of restoring the economy. Sure it's not fair to people that grind... but absurdly a legit economy is how you legitimize grinding in the first place. Hundreds of hours to get a TSE which now sell for 200 caps does not make sense. They should be worth tens of thousands of caps (pre nerf)
---
Players or NPCs, can you one shot/head shot another player ranged with the no damage limit on first shot?
---
I really hope your right, but that could easily be referring to rolling out the “election system” from the original post, that’s the most “done” thing in the game right now. 
---
The only thing I could see that would go wrong with this is the fact that you do not stay in the same server, so imagine going and doing all this work and then next time you log in, you're on a server who didn't care about it. That would be terrible
---
Be thankful it wasnt wielding a gamma gun
---
Well that makes 2 of us, i have only seen 1 in a random camp i found.
---
Oh dang that’s more than I expected with armor, kinda crazy those kinds of numbers are even achievable. I usually either wear a hazmat suit or unyielding mixed pieces (wood left arm, combat right arm, marine left leg, raider right leg)
---
I’m not talking about lore either, I’m talking about the same thing you are. 
---
I could had sworn that they used to be programmed to be considered like a vehicle in one of the older games. I tried to find the original post about this in the fallout4 subreddit, but I can’t find it. 
---
well... at least you didn't have the Bill Murrey like I did ... literally had to Groundhogs Day my BoS Stripes story line ... every single time ... over 7 times had to do that camp training program ... every time even when it was just me log out from playing for the day. lol so, so many times ... and I am mele so like ... shooting range was pretty redonky.
---
Yes I will try unbulking them
---
Definitely me then, I still haven't looked harder but I will :)
---
 There's a main quest? I have been doing it wrong. ;)
---
Sneak at level 20. Escape Artist at 35 is also good.
---
I was hoping along with the little Liberator bots we'd see more Chinese bots, like the fear-mongering ones on the Communism workshop posters, if not a Liberty Prime sized one.
---
that shit ougly
---
[For any one who doesn't know. ](https://youtu.be/_1jGnFt78H8)
---
It's not as simple as that.
---
I don't know of any popular loot MMORPG that has balance between PvP and survival on the same server while having end game weapons drop. I'm sure they exist but they aren't popular.
---
Yessssss
---
Don’t tell anyone about this my base has been situated on that cliffside near it since day one. 
---
r/FO76roleplay 😀
---
The severs are becoming very unstable with nukes.  
---
Last night there were three nukes on the Mono Power Station, after a Whitespring Nuke, and after number two my teammates disappeared visually completely.  After slowly glitching worse and worse. Then after number three the server crashed completely.  
---
when i was a low level, a scorched beast dropped dead on top of my base. i sent a picture to my friends and they thought i killed it with a lv 20 hunting rifle. i decided to live the lie and said ye, it was I who killed it lol.
---
A day later, a scorch beast attacks one of my friends and seeing my BS picture. I was the first one he called for help. I came, i saw, and after shooting a tiny scratch of health off the beast, i asked him, do u got some mats to fix ur base?
---
He was like ye, but what about the base. 
---
I was like well buddy. there isnt much we could do about it now. 
---
He was like, wait... i thought u killed one with ur hunting rifle... 
---
The truth came out and we sat and watched the scortch beast tear up his base silently. 
---
while we were watching the disaster, i felt like shit lol. 
---
 This. Took a Wooden Chest with extra Mutant Resist while dodging Watoga bots yesterday. I did carry it to the Station as it was not far away. A whole 8 caps for that one.
---
Could you send a pick
---
If the location
---
I get my gear by exploring and questing, not nuking Whitesprings repeatedly. Does this make me a less valid player?
---
That’s an interesting fireproof theory. Tell me your results.
---
After I completed the main quest line I started doing all of the side quests, nuking different and new areas other than whitespring and site prime, and building new camps in new locations. All of this sure has kept me entertained without getting bored.
---
Yeah that’s true but the game is obviously nowhere near done considering the amount of content they have on the way.  Kids wanna keep whining while improvements are coming at us left and right I just think it’s kinda dumb.  I’ve got a right to look at a situation with a positive outlook just the same. 
---
Implying there's a valid reason not to do this
---
Farming powerful gear that will get nerfed eventually 
---
Hey this happened with my flamer i was wondering what the deal was. Glad i was not alone on this issue , bug or what ever the hell this is.
---
People have found him in a number of places, so he does indeed travel like Grahm. Like he's cut content, but they left a body and a route. Or he's just a random encounter spawn.
---
Fallout 2 had some non-hostile intelligent deathclaws.
---
You need to get closer, works for me.
---
Yeah, but games like Red Faction Guerilla that actually let you destroy practically anything and everything that wasn't the terrain preventing you from falling through the world or the sky box were literally built from the ground up with that feature in mind, including the choice in engine to use for the game.
---
Legendary enemies in Fallout 4 always* regenerated their health at the halfway mark, just like the Scorchbeast Queen does in 76. Other legendary enemies are clearly intended to do this, as well, but the implementation and bugs have made it unclear to unfamiliar players what's happening and which occurrence (regenerating or not regenerating) is the intended effect and which is the bug. 
---
The issue is further confused by the uneven and clearly-affected-by-stealth-updates rate of legendary drops from legendary enemies, which, in Fallout 4, was a guarantee. The guaranteed drop seems to be another poorly-coded fuck-up from the development team, because, if you manage not to one-shot a legendary enemy, it almost always mutates at the halfway point, and almost always drops a legendary.
---
legendary effects are not level dependent. You can find the best legendary effects on a lvl1 item. Best to get to 50 so you get max level items before investing in farming. 
---
We don't know what changes are coming to magazines and bobbleheads (including if there will be a fix to stacking).
---
We know a part of the patch, not the whole thing.
---
Uh that's pretty easy to prove wrong.
---
I run 45% rifle perks and no demo expert. 
---
My tse handmade 1 shots those.
---
Well for one thing you can complete I am Become Death -- it's fine, nothing to be scared of. Second, and this is what I did after that quest, try to craft the full sets of Excavators and X-01 power armor, then buy the mods from the vendors.
---
 Stinging is AP with the bigger magazine. Perforating is the regular AP.
---
Grahm. Sells them for around 200-300c
---
ugh... well why not just take away all the legendarys. 
---
Sounds good to me, just have normal ol' weapons to shoot and fix with actual non-magical things about them.
---
Why not go all the way and take out all of it?
---
Suddenly the game is a lot different? Maybe ... maybe not.
---
I just want more RP and emphasis on RP ... too bad nobody cares like I do about being low INT making it impossible to communicate past grunts and moans. 
---
No idea what weapon your using but your not using a TSE weapon lol....
---
Only things i cannot one shot are SBs and the queen bitch herself.
---
Got mine from Grahm.  230 caps. 
---
Good luck finding him.  
---
I’m getting this right now on Xbox. Neither elevator works
---
No.  Dammit.
---
What's your gt ill help launch another one
---
I use a TSE Handmade with 399 damage on average
---
Yeah im on xbox one so this is going to be torture finding him. Havent seen him since November.
---
LMAO you know little then, you would steal it when they put it in the world stash. It normally becomes a race to see who can get the most stuff out the fastest. Watch the duper drop run over and steal it. it was that simple. By the time they get on the mule account you have looted all if it was with a buddy to anchor sometimes they are just kinda standing not doing shit until it is also to late and the race would begin. 
---
I don't understand how people didn't understand this is how you dealt with dupers. Also it was glitchy at best taking from a world stsh sometimes you would have to go in and split other times it let you pull so it was a real challenge.  All you are doing is slowing their progress. But if you really wanted to mess with them you waited like 30 seconds after they started putting loot in then you would use a furious X melee on them and hope they got checkpointed if that happened and you stole the shit they lost it forever. I got plenty of rage shit in messages. 
---
The last epic load I got was on January 12th. It seems the 10th-13th had the biggest amount of idiots out duping letting their shit get stolen. 
---
Requip it, wait a little bit.  Step out of the armor.  Pick it up, then place it and step into it again and see if it saves the load out correctly. 
---
It’s a bug on pretty much every power armor.  It will go away after you save a new power armor setup eventually. 
---
If they just set the materials needed at some Insanely high number (ok not TOO) insane, and make it so that anyone on any server is donating toward that 1 same build goal then it could work, especially if the event lasted a week or a few days. Either all players in all servers collectively do enough to succeed or they dont - that way no matter what server you're on the end result would be the same.
---
This game is dead until they fix the crashing bullshit.
---
Should have just made a used a real engine
---
What if they do nerf the bobblehead stacking?
---
What if they don't nerf them but they crack down on duping enough to make bobbleheads uncommon again?
---
... or maybe they don't do the things I mentioned above.
---
Either way, CAPS LOCK posts aren't taken as seriously by BGS as posts that are less bombastic or present reasonable points in a reasonable manner.

People are not fond of camps built around Whitespring mainly if you have a turret.
---
it's just a game. more people need to remind themselves. lol
---
you earned in game caps, you used them, welcome to being an adult. lol
---
Also interested to know. 
---
Nah, I see lever rifle plans regularly at Grafton (not the station) and I'm level 131. If you're unlucky you might hop 10 times and not see them.
---
Some people don't like camps on the golf course. Especially with missile turrets facing the golf club entrance, but some might be OCD about attacking any camp around there. I don't get it.
---
I use a TSE lever with a bloodied/VATs/Crit Rifle build ... I can one shot entire groups of Glowing Ghouls at Whitesprings after adrenaline perk gets going a little bit. 
---
I love doing that to large enemies charging at me, and having them die and skid to a stop at my feet.
---
Feels kickass.
---
I always remember one guy on the server so if it crashes I can rejoin their game because every nuke i go to crashes
---
No you're not stealing the legendary as long as that player also hit a shot on the legendary enemy before it was killed they will also get a random legendary
---
&gt; And here in the subreddit everyone was complaining about the lack of a fun little Christmas present for players when all along it was there, but forbidden from going public.
---
Oh, they made it in the game, for sale in the Atom Store...
---
Yeah
---
Yeah, you have to click into it and read the detail.
---
Sucks, for sure.
---
It's fine. I'll just server hop and look around. I'm just kinda butthurt right now. Between that and all these lead pipes and exterminators boxing glove legendaries. It's starting to tax me. 
---
I might hit ya up later tho. Thanks. 
---
For a brief moment, I thought whitesprings was the "before" and your camp was the "after." I was quite impressed 
---
Yeah.  Lesson learned.
---
I always carry about 50 normal, and healing factor takes care of the rest.
---
I found this today as well. My wife doesn't play and will probably never have any idea I did this, but its a nice touch
---
This is still happening? Jesus Bethesda
---
On PC we're not that lucky. We can't join Recent, we can only join Friends. So we gotta friend the guy on the server you're about to nuke, and he has to accept, before you can rejoin.
---
Xbox. GT is MAX K1RGAN
---
I've seen similar when the game lags. The occasional NPC spawn and instant death, occasional bodies dropping from the sky. It happens.
---
My friends and i are abandoning fallout 76 for this reason, we did not pay for a game only to be bullied and harassed online for someone elses amusement. For Bethesda to market this game as PvE with the option to PvP is totally misleading. If we wanted PvP we would have bought a PvP game, if we wanted a fight we'll find it in real life, very much more interesting. 
---
That's lame sorry people can be such jerks. And pretty sure if there were npc's in game they'd have a WV accent too ;)
---
 THE FIRE IS SHOOTING AT US
---
Maybe but whatever. I’m more pissed that I finally found a weapon that works for my shamble of a build, because mind you, I’m not a die-hard fallout fan boy that plans my cards from day one, and now that I can finally kill enemies without having to reload my weapon for once I’m immediately going to have to revert back to out of PA melee because it’s the only thing I have that can do decent damage against high level enemies. I don’t want to have to play a game where I’m forced to make a specific character for a specific task like melee, rifles, or heavy guns. I’ve always enjoys fallout for allowing me to be a jack of all trades but the perk cards just don’t really work well for that loadout or at least I’ve yet to find a build that does. All of my cards are used to reduce weights because again I’m used to playing with large reserves of ammunition and items so I don’t have to worry about micromanaging things. The simple truth is I never should have bought this game. I was wrong to think that this would still feel like a fallout game. This is clearly an MMO and to be honest it’s not remotely my type
---
Mostly as highly impactful emote
---
Yes, those are all the mods it has.
---
Yeah I have unlocked both long barrel and full stock, not sure if there are the upgraded varients though 
---
Skin for 1 weapon valued at $5. Thanks Bethesda. 
---
The enclave scout armour mask might be the kind of look you want.
---
It crashes more, does that count?
---
If you need it, I can install one for you for free. Just don’t store it.
---
Then you're doing something horribly wrong. My TSE handmade does 550~ per shot, and my lever action 1000~ per shot, obviously double those numbers if you're sneaking. I one-shot everything but scorchbeasts
---
You are checking the right side of the s ren to ensure u have the correct lvl crafting perk right? Like lvl 5 armor perk of lvl 5 gun nut etc..?
---
Has been reported since launch
---
Use it to craft a Prime receiver for .50 cal machine gun and also to make the Ultracite .50 cal ammo
---
That would really help.  IGN xXCookster14Xx
---
This has *definitely* been mentioned before. Still a great idea and something I'm sure they're planning for maybe about a year down the road. Hopefully after the first DLC
---
Well then exactly what am I missing? And if that’s the case why not nerf those aspects instead of the weapon itself because as a base gun without perks it doesn’t seem to be that fantastic. 
---
Bug reports about this have been send to Bethesda via ticket and through Beth. staff here on Reddit.
---
For me my phantom budget went back to 10% (from 30) when I scrapped every single item, build some floors and stored them, then placed again.
---
I do have a living sloth tho, don't know if my budget would be back to normal otherwise.
---
/u/jessBethesda any news on this? 
---
Those are the only ones I have got to
---
They heavily penalize it with an instant bounty slapped on you. Even just a 10 cap one means you can see no other random players on your map and have a giant target on you for all to see with slap damage removed.
---
I've only killed two players in all my time playing and one was a player with a super low bounty pleading me to kill him and another was a low bounty wanted player who thanked me for killing him because he was looking for a while for somebody to remove his bounty, letting me know to just go right ahead and take any of his stuff I wanted. 
---
A little bit of a silly system that *these* are the kind of "wanted" players you come across half the time.
---
I tried to setup artillery right above Whitesprings too ([pic](https://i.imgur.com/A2frZjo.png)) but unfortunately it's out of range! The train station is in range though. Pretty fun to see how people reach to the sound of incoming projectiles even though they are harmless. 
---
I assume you've got all three rifleman flavors at max? And also tank killer at max? 
---
I have no defenses or locked doors...
---
I'm not gonna get through that whole wall of text, but it seems like your build might be the problem. Good luck! :-)
---
[Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ai2o41/my_experince_so_far_and_about_last_night/)
---
No. Rifleman is perception if I’m not mistaken so I could probably finagle something into those points but which one is tank killer under
---
The last time it more or less my own fault....me and another went for ammo factory at the same time.....couple hours later he nuked it...my house was in the zone🤦🏻
---
So there are about 50 kinds of ranged weapons in the game. At $5 each it would cost $150 for camo on all of them... absolutely ridiculous. This game, I swear man, sigh.
---
Bullets go through 
---
3-5 shotgun blasts for a 40’s super mutant would be what my non-legendary shotgun takes, and that’s only if I’m being really lazy or fancy about it. 
---
I’m gonna say... nope!
---
As for Bobbleheads, I’m sure that’s on their list.
---
The only vendor you can kill is the random event one in Charleston and nothing happens except you make some people mad 
---
Try and use said weapon and crash out of your nuke zone ...Thanks Bethesda!
---
Word
---
No lie would love this
---
Oh, yeah there's your problem. Tank killer is also under perception. I keep my per at 12, and it's always full with all three rifleman perks at 3 and tank killer at 3 as well (which negates armor and has a knock back iirc)
---
The cannibal execute never gets old
---
Eh just sell it to a vendor, I usually look to see the value if it's over 100 I'll lug it to a vendor to get 30 caps from it, or if it's really like like a legendary switchblade other than that I just leave the crap
---
True true
---
You get banned
---
Honestly, you gotta hand it to him. To be that mad and STAY that mad to do an entire silo knowing you might just leave at any moment hahahaha
---
&gt; Edit: the servers seem to place you with 'local' players for latency. 
---
That only makes sense in a P2P setting. It's almost certainly that the server you get matched with is the closest one to you and naturally the other players who got matched to the closest server are also ones close to you.
---
Just putting the component into stash fixes it for me. I usually compare one craftable mod vs the other. See which part it might be bugging out on. 
---
All the dupers are causing la.... wait, that was last week. What are we blaming it on this week, I forget? Uh, Mars is in retrograde? Yeah, that's it.
---
What do you want for it? I'm on PC.
---
The reduced damage while flying is due to distance, not higher defense. Damage drops off past your weapons range (check the weapon’s stats). Long barrel pistols and rifles being 200+ doesn’t overcome the fact that she’s hovering 500 feet?yards above you. The drop off in damage is much more dramatic in 76 when compared to previous titles (from my experience).
---
Saw them at (penbelton. Sp??) The robot vendor inside of whitesprings today or maybe it was the vendor at watoga shopping center. Cant remember for sure but I DEFINITELY saw it at one or the other today.
---
Currently level 46, never once seen or encountered Mothman in any of my games or my friends. Am I playing the game wrong 
---
Your camp was probably where someone else’s camp was and when they spawned in yours was there instead. So they destroyed it and threw a tantrum just like any other cry baby would. 
---
Er...my TSE Gatling does 800 a shot, my TSE .50 Cal does around 400 a shot.
---
He'll, my explosive (not two shot) harpoon gun does 800+
---
All can one shot most mobs.  This is without drugs, bobbleheads, or anything.
---
It's only if you don't use the right build or cards that they are as weak as you say.  It's why I only use them for queen fights and bats, pretty boring otherwise.  Actually looking forward to the nerf so it can add some excitement to those weapons.
---
If he would only get rid of all that spoiled meat, it would help a lot. And with the smell, too.
---
I had to laugh....I mean I wasn't even trolling but achieved the true definition of triggering someone....think it was only 3/4 kills before he gave up too.
---
No it doesn't but it also doesn't entitle you to be on par with people who do grind for those great weapons. I spent a lot of time building my armor set. I don't even have a god weapon yet but I do just fine without a balance to help me out.
---
Being a valid player doesn't mean you're a valid pvper.
---
Subsidingcross2 I'll play with ya, I really only ever play alone of with one friend but he just got banned lol
---
[r/fo76bazaar](reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar) is the closest you’ll get I think. Post your items that you wish to sell and ask for a price check
---
I can't upvote this enough.
---
He thinks you are pretty but can't get up the nerve to ask you out on a date. You always sonic wave the ones you love.
---
So to do trades you have to friend everyone first?
---
It’s idiots that think every base on the golf course is bad. And don’t worry, the idiot wasted a lot of ammo destroying everything.
---
More server-wide events would be great.  A lot of people have already talked about this with regard to more SBQ-like bosses.  But I thought it might be interesting to have an event that requires all of the power stations to be fixed within a certain time frame, with that time limit low enough that it required everyone's participation simultaneously rather than one station at a time.   Or any event in the same vein that required everyone's participation regardless of spec/gear/level.
---
 Perhaps have a mixed event where one group had to fix a station inside while the other held off scorched waves from entering.  The event being failed if either scorched make it through the door or the inner group fails a timer, etc.  
---
Feed The People should go back to giving everyone on the server a little food (I know it was a bug but it was nice).  Perhaps a server-wide effect for several hours after completing an event, like if players could trigger the verdant season effects, etc.  
---
I'd like more 'The Messenger'-esque events too!  Just a variation on traveling through several places on the map protecting cargo or a bot. With each stop the event continues but gets harder, until either the cargo or bot is destroyed.  The longer the event holds out, the better the rewards, and the longer people want to keep it up, the more are going to have to join in to keep it going!  That'd be awesome, all of the server just slowly moving through towns fighting off hopelessly endless waves.
---
Is it story wise or challenge? Powering up all power plants. Grabbing up and defending all the workshops on the map and setting up extractors on all points would be interesting.
---
Getting all the plans/mods in the game, outfit collecting, atom farming to buy all and even the useless store items without spending a dime...
---
If it’s story wise you are correct the quest lines are finite. but it’s fun to go to each point in the map to detective the story behind the scene piecing it together through holotapes and notes
---
I know it’ll never happen, but I’d gladly drop $20 on atoms if the prices were like, 1/10 of what they are now.  I’m not dropping $18 IRL just for power armor paint, it’s insane.
---
Is that at the Sugar Grove terminal? If it is I'm on ps4 and the same thing thing happened to me yesterday. I gave up after trying a few times and today it worked the first time I tried.
---
Lol...fax
---
&gt;Aren't we supposed to downvote poorly researched comments?
---
Careful what you wish for I guess.  Sounds like more trouble than it's worth.  Did it drop from an enemy or was it taken from the Dev.. room? 
---
The recent patch for me fixed the crashing issues on PS4. I used to crash once per hour but after the patch I have not crashed even once.
---
Now that would be awesome. Reminds me of the gta 3 mayhem cheat where every civilian had weapons. That was chaos (and fun)
---
Thanks...guess I'll just try tomorrow...pain the butt though.
---
I've had complete opposite. Good for you though! Cant wait to test the fix more tonight. 
---
I've had a few encounters where he's just sat there watching me! 
---
PvP, Events, helping new players, helping others with quests. Friend and I have had several really fun team based PvP experiences taking workshops and defending them. I didnt even do the main quest until I was level 80 lol
---
No, creatures are tamed in the wild then given a random path to patrol that players have no control over. 
---

---
What kind of plans do you usually get?  I am looking to farm power armor plans. 
---
You can get them injured, but they regen health and cannot die. Regen has it's own animation, but nothing special.
---
Looks shit....could at least add walls or seats ya know ;)
---
Xbox
---
apparently even if you don't get the skill check it'll beep like crazy as normal. It's basically a skill check that mostly just clogs your screen.
---
Did you hit any sharp parts on it? I have some bandaids if you cut yourself when you scraped it.
---
I mean, there was. You just had to build it yourself :)
---
Ooof
---
I recommend doing this at Seneca peaks. Uh, the sounds landscape is quite...full giving you lots to hear.
---
They are pretty rare, but not that rare. I probably found d my first at around lvl 20
---
Yeah, but they don't talk about murder.
---
Don’t work not in PA either.... but the platforms are still accessible if you walk the track from the over look
---
You can try billing the steakhouse in northern crimson bog. Out back there's a small farm with 15 or so violet, yellowcake, and crimson. With the perk, I got 34 per person. There's also some ferns in the area that give violet to. With 2 people I made 11 or 12 stable violet fluxes.
---
I think it's more that I just don't like the look of the X-01. So if I'm not really burning myself by leaving the X-01 at home when I run through nuke zones then I'm happy. (I've been popping Radshield alongside my T-51/T-60 mix set, but it still feels like I'm absorbing too much radiation.)
---
Yup. At least one posts their ID, and friend invites are sent and accepted, and then we find each other and trade. Bloody drag. 
---
Diluted Radx doesn't disable mutations iirc.
---
Maybe contact Bethesda support but I wouldn’t promise anything. Good luck.
---
I'm having this problem.  I've crafted all the pieces of a lvl 50 X-01 but the helmet.  I have the resources to make it, but no matter what station I use, every option is grayed out.  It looks like you don't get the carry boost w/o the helmet.
---
I had that happen but it was eyebots

I’m pretty aware of my surroundings while I play. Never once seen him but I’m sure it would be fun fighting for the first time with him leveled. Maybe he’ll start stalking me for commenting
---
I've only seen [his good side](https://imgur.com/HwgcbNv) so far. One random encounter where he fled, and one quest-related encounter. I think I'm level 68 now.
---
I'd be surprised if it hadn't really, but it really seems like the best solution imo. 
---
Ouch, must be a mess keeping track of everyone.
---
Ah yes...great point. Didn't even think of the spawns, that would be annoying. Right now I am camped out at the bottom of the hill of Top of the World. Good location, vendors, spawning camps and stuff nearby. 
---
Thanks for the help..and again...great job! 
---
I am Level 103 and never seen mothman or the flatwoods monster  
---
Ok cool
---
Ehh disappointing 
---
Everything was so damn rushed. Skill checks are one of those non-essential polish items, so I'm not surprised so many of them were removed.
---
I’ve actually not had many crashes at all since the last patch. 
---
Some players on my friends list got banned. I know them from world of warcraft and we had a little chat. Turns out 1 of them was banned for duping and other two was banned for hoarding tens of thousands of mats, aids etc. I don't care if you believe it or not. It IS happening. Need proof you say? Well you can try to dupe for yourself and see what happens. Not that I promote duping,  but it seemed you wanted a perfectly solid proof. And it doesn't get any solid than this. Try it. And tell us what happens.
---
That's why I described level still having an effect on item stats, if you'd read the whole thing before arguing with me 
---
Home defense perk in agility
---
I'd love it. My stash of supplies wouldn't, but I'd be down for that.
---
Yeah but it'd be permanent after a few weeks
---
Reminds me of my twoshot explosive cryolator. I call it Icyhot.
---
You all bitching about the cost of atoms in the comments... seriously I went from 0 to 1440 in 1 week. Yeah at sometime the spigot with be cut off but that is still like 10,000 away for me.  The prices are fine I have multi paints for PA ,the PA station skin, sugar bombs, a few face paint,s some clothes, the glow in the dark map, chic and a few other things. I have never spent real cash in the store.   
---
The cash option is for those that do not want to do dailies weeklies and general challenges, or for those that just want ot line the coffers in hopes of helping fund the game further.   
---
As for the opener yeah I was like cool all in one camo paint, but I always check the other pics and read the description saw hunting rifle and was a hard pass.   
---
Lol was just curious I've pointed my gun at them soooo many times just to find out but never had the balls to squeeze one off
---
Thanks friend, now I wont waste resources on paper-mache defences 
---
One of the lucky few I think there friend! 
---
Question, how does one get the Enclave tag by their name?
---
mini nukes are not hard to make.
---
Add NPCs back to Fallout. Halotapes aren't a fun way of progressing a storyline IMO
---
At that point, damage isn't an issue at all.
---
What IS a problem is being stun-locked by things like Yao Guai and Assaultron melee attacks. You probably don't need more than 600 in any resistance to become insanely tough.
---
I've seen your trash video and it proves nothing. In fact you contradict yourself so bad it hurts your own argument. So try again sweetheart
---
I miss that rifle. But not as much as miss the Anti material rifle. And don't get me started on the BOZAR. Take me back to Vegas 
---
Also that melee scales infinitely with strength boosts, and there's SO MANY ways to boost that. 
---
If they come, then it’s a good way to block them all in one time. 
---
There's a water facet by the workshop bench.  They're probably considering that 1 water. 
---

He's  random like many other creatures. I've found mothman more than a half dozen times. I have only ever seen the flatwoods monster once &amp; he disappeared when I ran at him waving my hammer. I have never seen a behemoth. All this is after 200 hours of game play &amp; 2 builds.
---
In the options you can change your flare.
---
Uses a whole lot of ammo FYI. But hey whatever lights your torch.
---
YEEES! Especially if you are doing a nuke and that poor person doesn't get to benefit from rad sponge.
---
Add me also please. Gigaking2018
---
Funny this is my semi permanent workshop, good enemy waves 
---
I called in mine at a scorch beast queen event and I swear 4 or 5 nailed her in the head and a lot more hit than missed.  And with so many artillery pieces firing it hit often and for a while. 
---
I'm still unsure if it was luck or design
---
I ended up putting a second stash box at the top of the stairs. Blocks it perfectly and I can easily jump over it. We'll see if it works...
---
Lol see I’ve fought behemoth and the flatwoods monster a handful of times each. Oh well
---
Wow I feel dumb now. Thanks!
---
From the beginning I have been collecting armor... I have 4 full sets of armour on frames for levels 15, 25, 30, and 40. I checked 2 areas every day I played. They are both in Morgantown,  just outside mamas food in an abandoned warehouse just outside the fence down a little hill. And under mamas food in the commie base... both location have a chance to spawn 25 through 40 armour and you can get a core from the suit, or a nearby generator. The level 15 raiders set i checked every day up north in the scorn hideout. Straight north from the alligator. No cores to loot from a generator here...
---
That guy was making stuff up.
---
1 rad shield will remove 44 rads from a nuke zone in just normal armor no extra rad res. With PA you should be around 1-2 rads max a second. In X-01 is is 1 &gt;1 depending on I think condition I never figure out why sometimes it is 1 sometimes less than 1. 
---
Maybe the time just goes by and it just hits you that you have been taking rads? I know no radsheld in full perfect T-51b I have to pop a radaway about every 4 minutes. With rad shield should double that. 
---
Ammocrafting and Super Duper should handle it. :D
---
It’d just be a useless addition to me
---
How about it?
---
So a sloth takes up 40% of the budget? That seems like an awful lot. 
---
You can also use the search function on just that sub, to get an idea of what things are selling for. 
---
Zed villa 
---
I've run into a decent amount of couples playing together in my travels. I have noticed a few of them doing this. I think it's lovely. 
---
Thank you! it’s fixed. I only had materials in the stash box. I moved a few onto character and it worked. I was at my CAMP so I didn’t think I needed anything on me. 
---
This is the second time you have thrown your two cents in and both times you have brought nothing to the table except insults.  Are you lonely? Depressed?  Ever tried being kind instead of mean and grumpy? I will be the first to admit I am wrong about things sometimes, I will also admit when others are wrong I don't call them names.  What are you?  7?  Maybe 9 tops? 
---
It’s no problem. I had to ask someone as well.
---
Wait Wait, Nukes affect interiors????
---
What if you Nuke West Tek?
---
I was hoping they would screenshot it. I also think they meant Buttressed.
---
Tell you one thing, your fav game will be free to play soon.  Hahahaha, what a waste of 60$... Twit
---
I dont know why this is downvoted, the perkcards where listed in game files for cash shop since beta.
---
Is there a way to upgrade to centennial without buying a new game? 
---
How about being a bounty hunter,  all these people being griefed need justice. 
---
Well...you're wrong, didnt bother reading after the first sentence because the rest is irrelevant. I'm not banned so you can take that elsewhere
---
[This one](https://youtu.be/ALbQQzePzt4)? I know there's another one too, but I can't seem to find it.
---
Non PA get 5 pieces of marine with rad resist on it and pop a radshield it is like 600 rad resist if you go that route. Also don't forget cola nut, you nutty russian.
---
that's just messed up.  If they are going to do garbage like this the description should say it.
---
They all respawn they're caps after 20 real hours. They only have a Max of 200 caps. I think you can only collect like 1400 from venders a day
---
Unless of course they fix the bobble head stacking in the patch as well
---
That be awesome :) 
---
When are you on?
---
 Go ask Vendor Bot Phoenix in Watoga. He routinely takes on the town and wins. 
---
You just get lvl 68 mutants. Like if you nuke wanonga power plant.
---
There's a bug that shows the cap totals wrong. Try selling something to then even though it shows 3 or 0.
---
All nukes affect interiors, however you wont get nuked flora crafting mats, glowing mass etc from interiors. The mobs inside will drop glowing or ionized meat. Nuking Morgantown is honestly great, it has tons of interiors and 3 different events plus its huge.
---
It's a new bug, you're not supposed to -_-
---
But you're welcome
---
I will definitely add you. I would love to check out the build! Also thanks for the tips, I have been wondering how to share direct screenshots!
---
I met you! You where that awesome guy who had build your camp next to the overseers and you gave me tons of stuff :D
---
Bethesda fix something in this pos game?  Keep dreaming.
---
Isn't arktos on the surface map though? Eg not a separate cell, no loading required?
---
Not sure if it affects inside buildings but Arktos Pharma doesn't have loading screens so doesn't count as an interior cell. Blew my mind when I realised, makes such a difference imo can't wait for Fallout 5 where we'll be mostly done with them.
---
I went a vendor just discovered he had 2 caps on him...I was disappointed. 
---
🙏🙌🙏

I play the game with my brother's wife ;)

---
You may be thinking of the Incinerator from NV which did shoot fireballs. But I don't know for sure, I certainly haven't seen such a mod.
---
Let it go and learn from the experience
---
Bethesda cant even give back a weapon that's fell through the floor or replace needed quests items that disappear from your inventory.
---
There is a lvl 91 glowing that spawns at Whitesprings not too far from the resort entrance. Otherwise try the Thunder mountain power substation by Watoga. There is usually one locked up in there.
---

---
I loved that gun in FO2. But, I also loved the DEagle.
---
🤷‍♂️😂😂
---
Double-barrelled napalm-injected fun!
---
It doesn't, but I think it's understandable that people adjust their expectations based on what they can see was cut, and what they can see hints at future events. The former seems to include mostly PvE stuff, and the latter seems to include mostly PvP stuff. If you expect anything else, it's just wishful thinking.
---
This being said, the developers *also* fairly recently asked what kind of events players would like to see, so if they really are listening, we might yet see more PvE stuff added later on -- or perhaps even some of the cut content reintroduced.
---
ASS-aultron. 
---
You don't, I've seen multiple posts about this and support doesn't have tools to retrieve it. 
---
I can be on in 2 minutes. Just send me a friend request in game, and I'll join your server :) 
---
Looks like this belongs on a reddead Reddit 
---
Seems fair to me
---
This is an Easter egg to that- this guy will always be hostile/dead. 
---
Or just place any junk item anywhere (like ocdecorator). 
---
I have a LVL50.1-Star TS.50 and TS.GAT.
---
I also have a LVL50 3 Star GAT with:
---
1. Faster movement while aiming
---
2. Increasing damage for consecutive hits on same target
---
3. Bashing damage increased by 40% 
---
Damn. Well looks like I made the same mistake. How stupid it is that shit like this is even happening. This is basically a scam. I didn't even see anywhere that it was specifically for the hunting rifle.
---
Oh god, thank you! That is either the exact one I'm thinking of or it is so close I can't tell the difference.
---
Some vendors share caps. So most of the vendors on the left side of the map are with the responders. So if you collect all the caps from one of them the rest won’t have any as well.
---
how do you...equip... it?
---
Or?
---
Like you can equip things on your hand?
---
Yes It affected the interior here. I did Fort Defiance once and it had no impact on the interior. Not sure what makes the determination on if the inside of a building is affected or not. Probably depends on how the building is constructed  and damage it has.
---
Hey! If you're still down, I'm on now for a couple of hours
---
Wouldn’t it be cool if there was an event where you had to defend a fortress from like 10 waves of scorched creatures and as you finish the waves they get harder and harder till all the enemies are level 95 and a giant Alpha scorch beast comes to wreck your shit 
---
&gt;Sadly it wasn't to be and we reverted back to ***super Mario ultimate....***
---
Hell yeah, new mario game. I hope this one has sunshine in it.
---
Awesome I’m jumping on now. 
---
Vendor caps are instanced per FACTION per player.
---
If the bot is called a "Responder" bot, it shares a cap pool with all other Responder bots. So you can go to a different location and find the vendor out of caps because you already used up that faction's caps.
---
Here's a map of which vendors are which faction:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9xvioy/all_vendor_locations_map/
---
Why not just eliminate the cap cost for fast traveling entirely (who exactly are you "paying" within the game world for it, as it is)? Anything you buy from a vendor is relatively pricey and they don't throw a ton of caps at you as it is, so all it does is whittle away at the very limited pool that you have for other stuff.
---
Yeah I've noticed lol dude never dies, my second time there I was still lower level so I led all the bots that way for some backup. Backup meaning I cowered in the corner while he took on every bot there 
---
Also I have lion statues if you don’t have them?
---
I’m gay 
---
I have brought dishonour to myslef.
---
This. There are 7 vendor "factions" but like 20 vendors in game. IE responder bot vendors all share caps, raider vendorbots share caps of a separate pool to responder bots.
---
I now belong to the Mire now so i can farm fusion cores to give away as well. :)
---
Use the woodchucker perk for double wood. It's under luck and only requires 1 point
---
I'm level 107 and I've seen both a few times, but they are rare
---
Go play Fallout 4 or New Vegas until the next content update. 
---
Once you get the first 4k the free atoms severely taper off. I believe you can get around 500 a week if you are super dedicated. They give you a lot of Atoms at first to get you in the habit of getting things from the store. It is an old drug dealer maxim: "The first one is always free."
---
Some of these things contain "cut" in their reference name in the files which implies that they were cut from release. They may still make it in as DLC later on but right now they are 'cut'.
---
Ok. Thank you.
---
Oh man. That’s my dream weapon right there. 😍 
---
Idk how to fix it, I'm not a coder but a massive company with unlimited resources should have the means to do so.
---
100% agreed. Today, I moved my camp to a more favorable location, and I haven't even decked the place out yet and I'm already at my budget. I need more!
---
I think you can get DR even higher if you use Barbarian and use dark cola / alcohol and the perks that double their effects
---
I wish! Nobody lets me play solo anymore haha 
---
I think the nerr is a bit much. I would rather have TS lowered to 50% more damage and instead of lowering explosive to 20% I'd lower it to 30 or 40. I'd still rather have it the way it is going to be then the way it is now
---
Put loads of holotapes in your stash then it should work. For some reason there’s a bug where if you have too many holotapes in your inventory the terminal won’t accept the tape. Hope this helps you. 
---
Same here. I don't spend much, if any, money on MTX, maybe if there was something really freakin cool I would. But this stuff, at this price, no way. It might as well cost $1,000,000 because either way I'm not buying it.
---
I know! It's also datamined stuff from the messages section of the game files which is a tiny section of the game as a whole. This is things like tutorial messages or on-screen popups. I don't understand the people who think this is indicative of all possible future content forever until the end of forseeable time.
---
"never had the balls to squeeze one off"
---
A little personal🤢, but okay🤷‍♂️.
---
Play Anthem when it comes out.
---
Come back to year2 FO76 when the game has been beta tested
---
They could go the ESO route and just do daily login rewards. Over the last year ESO has stepped up their rewards and even offered a full on paid DLC as a reward.
---
Or 3
---
Carefully worded sentence structure 
---
Servers lagging more often, more client crashes, more disconnects, much more frequent server crashes, almost complete proliferation of TSE weapons, lots more griefing (i.e. PK outside of PvP), more exploits, more hacks. On the plus side, the lever action reload bug is fixed, bobby pins now weight 0.001 instead of 0.1, and there are a few more things in the Atom Shop.
---
RadShield+RadX = 500 radresist
---
Along with tertiary legendary bonuses on armor (+25 radresist each plus minor bonus from shielded underarmor ) and possible bonus from perks - you can get around 650.
---
Have a friend join you
---
I find they work good as a warning system to tell you shits goin down
---
Each group of vendors share a common allotment of 200 caps per reset, grouped by faction: 
---
Responders—Camden Pk; Charleston Fire Dept; Charleston Station; Flatwoods; Grafton Station; Lewisburg Station; Morgantown Station; Morgantown Airport; Welch Station
---
Raiders—Pl Valley Station; Pl Valley Ski Resort; R&amp;G Station; Sutton Station; Sunnytop Station 
---
Free State—Harper’s Ferry
---
BoS—Watoga Shopping Plaza
---
Enclave—Whitespring Bunker
---
Whitesping—Whitespring Station; Vendors inside Whitespring Resport
---
Other—Watoga Station; Traveling Grahm
---
Haha! 
---
Thanks buddy...
---
Additional related ideas... (please upvote)
---
- make the trees alive. Have vines and roots become viscious
---
- radiation lightning bolts that do 500 rad damage if they hit the player
---
- occassional earthquakes like the earthquakes at the haunted cabins near Vault 76
---
- water gives as much rad damage as the FEV vats at Westek
---
- picking nuked flora inflcts rad damage
---
- enemies are given random mutations such as unstable isotope, scaly skin, talons
---
I read the entire post you made, you want a small impact on people who spend countless hours farming best in slot gear for pvp. You should not be close to them. This is not a MOBA, this is not TF2. 
---
I do not use a TSE shotgun for pvp, and I am of the opinion power armor in pvp is a bad choice. I do very well in pvp. I saved up, bought a TSE handmade, and have far from optimal pvp armor. The TSE handmade? Super important, sure. Cap cost? 5k for me if i remember correctly. If you cant grind out 5k caps then I dont really care about your opinion on how people should be nerfed.
---
Ok. I’ll take that into consideration the next time I write a reddit post, sorry I have offended you with my writing style and weak suggestions, I thought I was running a little long and wanted to keep them brief, but whatever.
---
And yeah, let’s quintuple the highest level enemy in the game currently (lvl 95) because that that would be EPIC and we are so *elite* /s  
---
Any ideas welcome. I started a separate reply above where I'm adding additional ideas.
---
Me, a couple other players and a dozen robots took down a level 92 glowing behemoth in a Whitespring nuke zone once... haven’t seen one since.
---
I think I may have dropped it on accident. I talked to the guy and he doesn’t have it. I believe him I guess. I’m not sure.
---
I’m done with this game. I can’t believe there isn’t a mechanic to prevent this
---
That sounds amazing except I think 50 liberators for each star(out of three) would be better because a hundred liberators at once would crush even a large group of people I feel like. 
---
Sentinel is still superior to Vanguard.
---
And bolstering as well, IMO. Vanguard quickly loses bonus and zeroes around 50% HP
---
Stardew Valley is fun.
---
This - I would have liked to have consistency with TS doing 50% like it was in fallout 4 - especially as TS is the “bigger” legendary effect while explosive is just the minor one 
---
But oh well, if over nerfing is what Bethesda wants to do - then it’s what they do 
---
I agree, I'm more pissed about nerfing the 2 shot tho. I use a TS guass and it's not one shotting anything below lvl 30 ish kinda sucks
---
Np
---
Isnt he actually husband/son?
---
"Help! I need a medic!"
---
"Don't worry, I've got you covered!" *proceeds to incinerate everything in sight*
---
Where is that holotape? I couldn't find it.
---
Oh yeah I’m ravenhawke. Coming to you now :)
---
You'll get better responses if you listed what you have and/or are looking for.
---
Also, try the trading sub /r/fo76bazaar
---
I agree, I wish they were more of a challenge.
---
You are correct. No loading screen required.
---
I see, thanks! 
---
Anything u r looking for specifically?
---
Or wanting to set rid of?
---
They really wanted you off the server. Lol
---
Watoga probably
---
LegendaryPowerUpMsg explains so much
---
They should really upgrade most ranged weapons anyway, but TS was so out of place.
---
Rad x blocks mutations. Which can be very damaging for this build
---
Outside pleasant station, top of the world
---
I like it 👍 this is what i like to see on this sub. 
---
It is all fun and games until you throw a smoke that is not directly in front of the base.
---
Rip your base and the process of each one of them adjusting for fire. 
---
Still an amazing Idea
---
That's the best way, open chill camp for cool players! Lots of haters at the Whitesprings sadly!!!
---
Well the whole point of a game is to chase the rare stuff.  If its behind a paywall it kinda sucks.  Id rather pay 60 for a full finished game and no microtransactions with a loe monthly subscription.
---
I had the eyebots thing too. And all the flowers were mutated too despite not being a bomb zone. 
---
Even with no perks my TSE shotgun will kill a glowing ghoul in 1 shot. 
---
Yeah challenge (not chore).
---
Also part of the problem is dumb AI. I don’t want dumb bullet sponges. Super mutants were kinda fun when you were weak and they had rocket launches because you actually had to plan how to attack. Being OP is fun, and normal when you’re a high level and they should be adding new stuff to make it a challenge too for us high levels. Giving them such weapons would be fun 
---
Have you ever seen the mods for fallout games? So many slutty and porn mods.
---
If Bethesda really wanted to make some money, they could full the atom shop up with lewd outfits and other lewd things.
---
I know multiple people who got banned that aren't "Youtubers" lol so, no. There were many bans issued. You're just not hearing about it because people who exploit tend not to post about it on this sub.
---
I see a lot more constructive Atom Shop talk than bitching... in this sub, anyway.
---
You can farm the Watoga Municipal Center... There's a safe in the Mayor's office that spawns 6-12 Stimpacks guaranteed, every time. 
---
Yeah nothing like killing thr queen and having the game crash so you get no loot and no XP!
---
Fix the freaking game already!!! The patches have done nothing but make it more unstable.
---
Same as any other piece of armor.
---
Yeah same thing started happening  to me today, I  can un-equip pieces in the inventory  and then it will just show me with out that piece in game. U find a fix yet? 
---
Since someone added the perk card abuse thing, maybe they could add gangs or factions? You wouldn’t be able to share your cards through them, but multiple people can join you in a less teamwork, more “don’t shoot me while we do quests together” style
---
I never seen him with purple eyes only red. 
---
The amount of times my game crashes has increased drastically for me since this last patch. Not only do I get 3 or 4 blue screen crashes per hour typically (sometimes more), but often times the game freezes up when loading in and I have to close application and bring it back up. I’ve also experienced a weird glitch where I load in my power armor and am not able to move or access my pipboy. The map works, I’m able to bring up emotes and my favorited items, and even lock onto a nearby enemy with VATS and attack, but can’t move or do anything else. 
---
It took me 3 days to download the initial 50gb day one patch, I dread the thought of having to uninstall and download everything again.
---
Anything in particular you looking for?
---
Careful that's a known exploit on the naughty list! Better turn yourself in!!! 
---
I agree- but I’m mostly referring to various YouTubers and people I see playing the game.
---
I agree. As we've become super heroes we need super villians. Right now I feel like Batman going after pick pockets
---
No
---
Do you have Chemist and the recipe to make them? If so, just pop around to all the vendors and look for blood packs. You can make dozens of stimpacks in a matter of minutes.
---
Also, run all the quick events like Fertile Soil. Most of them only take a few minutes and will get you 3-5 stimpacks each.
---
Last but not least, wander around the forest and collect all the blood leaf and soot flower you can find and make healing salve, which benefits from all the perks that affect stims.
---
Oh ok. Well next time maybe clarify that when you're replying to a comment specifically about Fallout 4, that specifically even mentions it by name lol. 
---
For the record, those canned responses are like that because they do work a lot of the time. I used to work in a tech support capacity and the amount of smug smartasses that refused to at least try some simple thing was too damn high. Before you say "it's probably because they already did that like a million times", that doesn't really apply when I finally got them to try it and it worked lmao. 
---
Anti_material rifle pleeeeaaassseee!

---
found this build on the site you mentioned.  i changed good with salt to the class freak but will prob swap back maybe. also they had a point extra and so i added gun fu because i use vats a little and that makes it a little better.  just wanted to see what you thought about this build.  thanks
---
There's a Grognak the Barbarian game, I think it was in Grafton Dam in a concrete pipe.
---
White springs resort. Golf course against the southern wall between 2 sets of robots. It almost always right outside the blast zones 
---
It's the the people doing the broken gun glitch that's causing the servers to crash! Cheaters!!! Nothing cool about cheating and using exploits! 
---
Hey man, I don't mind them making money of the thing, I just have a problem with them doing such a lazy ass job of it. It's all asset flips and low effort, boring stuff. 
---
Here, look at this. [Here](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/143/590x/Fortnite-6-21-leaked-skins-1039344.jpg?r=1541155791596) are some Fortnite skins. Totally unique models and skins. Those things cost about as much as [this turd](https://i.imgur.com/WqT5zvM.jpg) from the atom store. A simplistic, uninspired, MS Paint project.
---
If they want to make some money of this stuff they need to seriously step up their game.
---
You act like there isn’t a way to earn atoms... you could literally buy everything in the atomic shop without spending a dime. And I don’t thing the point of a game is to chase the rare stuff. I think the point of a game is to have fun.
---
“But YouTube said this game has bad graphics” this is obviously r/s. I love the way this game looks, you can get some really nice screen shots 
---
It's bugged on ps4
---
Enjoy your non-stop creature attacks and repairing! That's a pass through for mobs that spawn in the area. Not just random mobs that attack your base but all the mobs for that area.
---
Mutants mostly. I hope you have good defences.
---
I’m just imagining the trailer where the two guys are in power armor just spraying 50 cals into a swarm of liberators while they attack relentlessly.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qs3640XWAvs
---
15+ people firing TSE or explosive miniguns..... 
---
RIP server frame rate.
---
I absolutely LOVE the ideas though, would be awesome!
---
No! The masks are bad! No masks allowed!
---
LOL yes it is! 
---
I did and I didn't agree. I'm sorry. Telling me to read won't make me agree. You said yourself that you don't spend time farming and grinding for the better weapons. Why should your gear be comparable to people that do?
---
The only mobs that I ever had to fight here were rats and the occasional scorchbeast from the fissure site.
---
I think you have to do that quest first don't you?
---
Mayor for a Day?
---
But besides that this is a great easy way to farm them. 
---
That makes sense, can’t have people like us trying it “just to see if it works.”
---
Oh sure...it's the evil "social media hate storm" again. Like really? Is that about as much argument that you can bring to the table? Even if i don't say anything the majority has already spoken about F76 and guess what? It was overwhelmingly negative. Now you can pin it on some imaginary "social media hate storm" all you want if it makes you feel better. But the facts won't change. The game was rushed,barebones and bug ridden to the high heavens. But hey it's all "hate" right? That's how you folks convince yourselves in your own little world isn't it. 
---
But tell me just out of curiousity what Fallout game do you consider worse then F76? I mean if it's not the worst Fallout release by far according to you then surely you can provide an undeniable example of a much worse Fallout release right? 
---
Oh man... YouTube is cancer.
---
A behemoth spawns in the ponds by my camp.  I don’t fight with him anymore and named him mike.  It would be nice to be able to turn him into my pet honestly.
---
I agree they definitely should step it up with what they add in there.
---
I am happy when people use my open camp and play some music with me lol.
---
It "works" because the whole idea of legendary weapons and creatures is:
---
a) Lazy game design.
---
b) Dumber than a sack of low IQ hammers.
---
c) And yes, it was stupid in Fo4 as well. Take this magic shit to Elder Scrolls.
---
He would love watching me play then. 80% of the ghouls and scorched I run into t-pose when I first see them and then slam onto the ground into their resting pose.
---
Got an assassins heavy chest
---
Yes, you have to complete Mayor For A Day to gain access to the safe. Thank you for adding that! Lol I should have included that info in my initial comment. 
---
I see what you did there… stranger. 
---
while exploring have you ever heard something, turned to see some inky smoke? well mothman is stalking you.
---
Waiting for that YouTuber, RifleGaming I think? To probably topic this now. He's been doing a series on testing nuke spots. Turned out Monongah (if it spawns ghouls prior) is a great spot, too.
---
I thought they were bats.
---
I can when I log in later
---
Where did you build
---
Dishonored in a nutshell
---
Was this just below the country club?  I think I saw it last night.
---
I think the best way to even out the price issues is to introduce new events into the game that give you like say 50 atoms for completing them. These events should only give you that instead of plans, ammo, etc. Plus that would be a good way to bring some more people together.
---
I feel your frustration. I myself have been surprisingly spared of most bugs and glitches in the game, but sometimes, when one last expect it, the code strikes and takes your out. I now want to welcome you to my favourite in-game frustration:  
---
Getting Disconnected or Crashed when doing endgame Queen fights, realizing you wont get back to the server you were on.   
---
Damn fun game, but so many things that still needs fixing. 
---
There are a bunch of TwitchRP players in their discord that RP in FO76. :)
---
Berkeley has the same level experience, but with several choke points.
---
You can get another 100 carry weight if you mod the legs with the  hydraulic mod. 
---
50 each leg. 
---
iirc  the mod doesn't say excavator in the name but it scraps to black titanium. 
---
Was hunting in the toxic valley two days ago when suddenly a squirrel fell over dead. I thought maybe it died from radiation or something. Then a radstag head fell from the sky. Then a radstag body that was missing one head. Then another radstag body with both heads intact. Didn't actually see them fall, but they bounced around as if they had just hit the ground.
---
Nothing else happened. I blame aliens.
---
Awesome. Thank you for this. I'm a collector:)
---
Yeah, but I wonder now if any other workshops have resources not accurately listed on map?
---
Have you looked in the fallout communities?
---
It’s from the event at the lighthouse, you have to kill a bunch of bugs and it spawns a friendly MothMan with pink/purple eyes
---
Same! I'm getting the clean army fatigues and the leather coat tonight, then I'll have every pieces of apparel in the game except for the yellow fireman outfit
---
Yes 308 ammo and screws
---
I never duped or crafted tons of things. Had nothing from the dev room but admit having a mule with duped guns another player made. 
---
Still got a ban. 
---
Thx
---
So that post about Lusty Assaultron Maid was on to something ? Assaultron First Date lol.
---
I found the stimpak recipe in the Garrahan Mining headquarter in the same type of mirror you did
---
&gt;  I could see an event of that type working on PvP would be if all legendary effects, mutations etc are supressed within whatever arena it takes place to level the playing field between players 
---
Speaking the true right here
---
i havent t imed it exactly.
---
but its about 3 - 5 minutes from how much ive played over the weekend.
---
I jusy dropped one send me your gt and you can enjoy some spoils
---
Do it while you sleep in rest mode!
---
Now it sounds like any place with ghouls is worth nuking. 
---
12%, 24%, and 36% respectively is what I read.
---
Level 36. Just saw my first flatwoods monster. Shot it and it disappeared. No mothman yet
---
Sick. We can nuke Watoga highschool for maximum ghouls then!
---
You’ll take my Forest house from my cold dead hands!
---
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
---
This is F R E S H
---
OK cool. I see you logged one other (different) trapper mod showing up at Harpers Ferry. I guess its time to hit the vendor. :) Cheers!
---
I have a 3770k CPU, which is a year older than yours and run the game perfectly fine. So Daniel has no damn clue what he’s talking about.
---
It sounds like you could have glitched items on the one character. Something in your inventory that the server does not like.
---
Sorry that they aren’t helping. By the sounds of it, this representative doesn’t help anybody.
---
I hardly ever crash on PC (except for on intentional exit), but I'm getting 2 disconnects per hour since the patch.  
---
There doesn't seem to be any reason either. 
---
The last weird one I got stuck in the cooking station animation. I let it sit for a while and he just kept on hacking and whacking that meat.
---
I want "flip you a finger" emote.
---
I'd gladly pay 1000 atoms for that.
---
&gt; Nuke anywhere on the map and the enemies will be level 95 "Nuked" variants.
---
That would be awesome. Nukes just changing the targeted area is not that interesting and leads to people only nuking a few spots. 
---
same here is have tse handmade that one shots over lvl40 enemies.
---
it is the bobblehead and mags that make the problem worse though. 
---
I was pissed that my mediocre radium rifle was being nerfed and my TS hand made was being nerfed. Both weapons take me a dozen shots to take down a level 62 super mutant.
---
And then......
---
Latest night I found an instigating sledge with 40% power damage.......hello God mode.....now I just walk in a room full of super mutants and one shot them all and I don't even have any 2 hand melee perk cards.
---
I get it now guys......nerf TS and Explosive rounds.....wink.... wink.
---
Honestly the take out of container without entering different screen for said container's contents was one of Bethesda's greatest achievements.
---
It's really hard to go back to Skyrim or FO3 knowing that you don't have to open a goddamn menu every time you want to loot something in FO4/76.
---
YES! I am so disappointed with the bolt action in the current game.
---
I'd go here. It's relatively quiet so you won't be repairing constantly 
---
Yea I got the occasional crash before the patch. Ever since though it's been horrible. Hopefully their fix works. It helped in FO4 so maybe!
---
Ammo 308 mostly and i dont know of all i have if ya want somethin name a price for ot message me here 
---
I don't see how they would have a problem detecting people with over 10,000 items. 
---
There have been some big fixes. It handles better than it use to by a lot, stuff is less buggy for sure. Just not perfect.
---
That train station is badass man!
---
Wait, we can skip the search phase of “Belly of The Beast” and go straight to the cave? I’ve had to stop mid-quest twice on that mission and this is great news . I agree that the mission structure and functionality needs to improve either way. 
---
Why so angry? :0
---
No word yet , sent message last Tuesday 
---
Still not reply 
---
Congrats wait till you meet the other versions. Aggressive ones make for a fun fight
---
Congratulations.  
---
Don't worry. Even with the upcoming changes it'll still be one of, if not the strongest contender. 
---
congrats on getting it
---
my pipe built toon is jelly
---
When you buy a paint job can you use it more than once?

I'm certain that patch broke something.  I had to move my C.A.M.P. off of my trusty junk node because I could never log into friends servers.  It was taking 4 or 5 tries, min, and I was on a junk pile in the middle of nothing. 
---
Be smarter next time! Some of us are still kicking.
---
Visit the cloud district very often? Oh what am I saying, of course you do.
---
This was my first major glitch/glitches and both striked during the same session i mean pleaty of disconnecting, but nothing like this.
---
It almost reminds me of that quote from Fight Club that everyone's chances of survival eventually drop to zero.

I wish the terrain changed, like a giant crator or something

Hey man, u got a discord? My buddy and I are looking for more people to play with. 
---
We don't need more bullet sponges tho.  I'm tired of ants and rats that are harder to kill than lvl 60 super heavy mutants. 
---
Ingame name is Feiff. I mostly spend my time looting old ruins, craft and enjoy the view from my C.A.M.P. but I also love to randomly do events with good people who enjoy cooperation, nice company and who work well together, so feel free to add me.
---
Honestly PA is better unless you plan on power-gaming with full set of Unyielding armor at 20-30% HP. Even then a lower HP build is safer with PA. No real point in normal armor unless  you want to go heavy with Unarmed.
---
Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
---
Oh god
---
That about happened to me, I spent 9000 caps on Signs and Letters (I'd been wanting it the whole time so it's okay) and then that same day a Watoga vendor had a Speed Demon serum for 3800. fml
---
I made a post about this very thing last week, reminding them that they said they were going to release that list "in the coming days" back on dec 11th.
---
They replied and said they were still working on it and would post it. They didnt give an estimated date, so take it with a grain of salt. 
---
So that the game is accessible to casual gamers, who happen to be the majority of Bethesda's fans right now anyway. 
---
We're not in disagreement because I believe people who grind should have better weapons, I just don't think they should be able to one shot someone who put their time into just enjoying the game.
---
Yet youtubers say the game has bad graphics. When i look how beautifull the enviroment is i want to murder the trolls who sarcasticly throw the "16x times the detail" remark. In PUBG grass does not render after half a football field in front of you and ppl give this game shit for nothing. Are they so braindead that only super close graphics matter to them? Do they rather have a wet super glowy spandex character with 1000x detail and all distant graphics empty and washed out? I bet they would give the game 10/10 for that.
---
Wait, there's an ever more aggressive version? This one was throwing sonic waves at me like crazy. I can't wait to see what the other one is like.
---
I think I would be okay with going out this way
---
Are you getting naked? I take 25 rads when I farmed my mutations. 
---
Direct quote from the article...in the paragraph after they've finished talking about the pvp mode.
---
"While it’s a little early to give specifics, we can tell you that our first major content update will roll out over several weeks"
---
Major content update sounds like a lot more than a small pvp election system event.
---
I would love to see this.
---

A couple of pics i took in photomode 
---
Check back in about 6mo &lt;3
---
Game never ends
---
I'm not 100% of the current functionality, but it would be nice if they extended the range a bit and you could call in strikes from friendly CAMPs in the area.
---
Basically get a few friends together, setup CAMPs to optimize fast traveling and artillery. It would be especially nice if we ever got private servers and the world was truly persistent with CAMPs remaining after the owner logs off.
---
It was probably that guy with the spear that was pissed you killed his sister and her children. 
---
had patrol duty pop yesterday for me. did it solo but only got crossbow plans :). 
---
will be trying again more this week
---
This event is so short, letting fireflies hit the floor is a waste of time!
---
If you never did find it, the raider vendors (at least TotW) sell them. The linings all have one style in their name, but cover all types, for that faction.
---
Hey this is kinda dope. I like it.
---
bye!
---
My post had three objectives:
---
Vent my frustrations.
---
Spare others the belly of the Beast nightmare, with my discovered short cut.
---
spare others firing off a scrap assaultron head, and losing all their fusion cells.
---
Cute thanks for letting us know
---
I'd like to be able to level a weapon up when I repair it. I'd also like to learn weapon mods by repeatedly repairing the same weapon, say five times, the way one can by scrapping a weapon.
---
This won't make trash weapons more usable. That isn't how it works. They didn't nerf mob HP.
---
Now everyone is just going to go melee, fist, and shotguns.
---
I guess they don't want your money, lol, that is one hardcore ban.
---
Agreed, that's amazing. There are mods that add this feature in Skyrim and New Vegas. 
---
Apparently there's one at a dog's grave south of the White Powder Winter Sports.
---
Thank you so much! I appreciate that a lot ;;
---
No. It literally breaks within a minute. And the damage is mediocre. 
---
Nope, and I never go higher than 15... maybe I should give it a shot.
---
Ive noticed that the targeting hud sometimes is on even outside power armor and almost always crashes moments later
---
I think that all of these are good ideas except for one:
---
&gt;Bump their resistances to super levels. Glowing ones in whitespring currently only have 21 DR. Nuked Glowing Ones should have at least 200.
---
Please, no, Bullet Sponges is the worst way to force difficulty in a game
---
Don't forget about super duper, chance to double the amount you make
---
I was told the creature respawns over time and that’s why it takes storage still.
---
And what if we could introduce mutations as a way of altering stats and appearance? Maybe a whole Warframe/Kubrow (sp?) breeding economy.
---
There will be more content eventually. I'd say soon but people who wanna be angry don't like it when you're optimistic about the game. Probably another month or two
---
Not much competition unless you wanna be at 20% hp your whole life, lol
---
Sonsband
---
There's no point in stacking rad resist on gear, the soft cap is too small. Just pop an extra rad-x diluted or 3. They stack.
---
Probably be easier if you just went out and bought a mic so you could tell people you don't have one.
---
Ty!
---
I've got the OG PS4.
---
From hitting Play and me spawning into the world it takes about 2-3 minutes.
---
Been server hopping all night yesterday looking for the Charleston Vendor so I've got a pretty good idea of the average time it takes to get into the game.
---
It’s worth doing once for the spectacle but that’s about it. It is better to nuke elsewhere and farm legendaries and plant material. 
---
Don't forget all the cola cups.
---
[OK](https://i.imgur.com/YG91GJp.jpg)
---
Lol, I need the opposite, a "I'm a rude jerk and don't want to talk to you" emote.
---
Let me have a puppy base, and role play as an animal shelter. Alternatively, let’s bring back k9 defense 
---
The more rads, the greater chance.
---
Idk what you mean by best setups.
---
Claiming a workshop will give you a free fast travel point, resources that you can mine with extractors (each workshop is different), defense events which give XP, and you'll get some caps if you're the one to clear the workshop of enemies. It costs anywhere from 25 caps to 100+ to claim.
---
Building at a workshop uses the workshop's resources, but it has a limited amount, then it will start pulling from your own resources.
---
When you log out, you lose the workshop, but everything you built stays there on that specific server for whomever claims it next.
---
And for those who don't want to watch the whole thing, [link with timestamp!](https://youtu.be/_1jGnFt78H8?t=1560)
---
5hp per point
---
You can already have pets in the game but it’s buggy. You have to have Wasteland Whisperer 3 and Animal Friend 3 and on a single spawn random encounter you have a rare chance to tame a select few animals and creatures then send them back to your base.
---
Aww yeah!  Smoke that pipe!
---
... wait...
---
You can have 5 inteligence and switch the cards in/out when u need to craft. That way u have more points to allocate to the rest. That being said you need to be ovr level 50 to get all the perk cards you need.
---
These are great. It would also go really far in making the world feel “alive”.  
---
I’ve also thought about larger scale urban center (Charleston, Grafton, Watoga, etc) server wide events that require a certain number of players to que in before they start with higher mob density and mini bosses and a final boss etc.
---
Aah! Thats awesome! I was wondering where the rings were, so going on a hunt with my husband. You know I probably shouldnt share this here but I was thinking about getting re-married to my husband in Appalachia. Our real wedding wasn't what we really wanted since he knocked me up early (woops!) So I thought about streaming one live to the community, our friends irl and anyone who will watch. We will get our friends and team mates to come and witness it, dressed up nice in pre-war clothes. I allready have the perfect location on the map. It will only be about 15mins long.  Thoughts anyone?
---
So every resource you use to build at a workshop comes directly from your stash or your person. The cost of workshops is the caps it cost to claim, the resources used to build, and the time to defend the workshops. As far as setting them up, I usually have a few generators (or one fusion generator if im on for long enough) and I connect all of the collectors together. If you log off while you own a workshop, you will no longer have it when you log back on, so make sure to grab your resources before you get off.
---
That too, but I figured anyone high enough to have that unlocked probably doesn't need help getting stimpacks.
---
There's still another dupe glitch in the game...
---
You still get the 45% increase on the handmade from those perks, remove it and see
---
Condition doesn't go down if you don't hit anything
---
So you can use 2k fuel on the ground and it can be at max durability.
---
Explosive weapons replace its ammo with I assume are miniaturized bombs lol
---
I noticed that I couldn't just farm mutations quickly. I would go stand in water, get a mutation that I didn't want, then take a Radaway to get rid of the rad damage and the mute. After that it seemed like I had to wait a few hours before I could get another mutation from swimming.
---
It could be made as a sub plot of those holed up at Mama Dolce's, to steal and reprogram a liberator prime and let it run amok.
---
Looks legit.
---
It's a gun that shoots explosions?
---
Id suggest keeping pieces with assassins + sentinel. With a full set you seriously reduce pvp damage and basically become unkillable. 3* armors check for any weight reduction. 
---
Unyeilding is not the best set. 
---
Awesome! Make a post man!
---
I had mine at the copper deposit for a while until somebody else got it. Being able to clean that place out regularly was a good time.
---
Idk, are you sure it isn't immigrants? Stealing our jobs, marrying our women, lagging our servers?
---
Awesome, I’m perfectly fine with it just being an event or reprogrammable to wreck a camp or location. Anything that creates a unique experience!
---
I'll buy it off you if you're willing to part with it
---
Well it's a two way street. If you're wearing power armor with 500 DR it doesn't seem really balanced to have enemies with only 21 DR (Glowing ones)
---
I appreciate the flexibility of it. I like how I don't have to have half my perks dedicated to combat and the other half to crafting or selling, I can have them all and just switch. 
---
Of course I'd rather have like earlier games, but I'm guessing they didn't go with those because of balancing. 
---
Duped items are not an "epic load" report the players and move on. Don't use the items, that's taking advance of game explotes for yourself. 
---
I wish people wouldn't data mine. Its the worst kind of spoilers and causes so much controversial conversation, mostly drama. 
---
I like that. This could help open up a new area of the map. Have the players build the bridge and have occasional attacks from Raiders, Raider bots, or Super Mutants that make it not so easy for higher level players to just build the whole thing in one go. Players have access to a new area when the bridge is finished. 
---
It was 100% designed for micro transactions but then battlefront 2 happened and EA got crucified for doing it so they scrapped it without bothering to fix the system
---
Or you know get proof and show it. It's not my job to prove it, it's the person claiming it is happening that has the burdon of proof
---
That's why they took the boosts the paintjobs give you out of the game, so they can sell the paints and wouldn't get crucified for selling game changing MTX.
---
Agree 100%
---
Check your weapon damage
---
The numbers will go up if twisted is being affected
---
I play through speakers rather than a headset.
---
Got any unarmed legendary weapons 
---
I got my first explosive weapon.. it was a light machine gun that does 37 dmg...
---
I think that increasing their damage quite a bit to be more "competitive" against a Power Armor would be better than increasing their defense to be as tanky as a player in Power Armor
---
Unfortunately, in my experience, that perk is glitched. I found that if you equip and unequip it a butt ton of times it will fix itself but there is no sure fire way. Again, at least in my experience. 
---
Please don't steal Roachie's ring. Pam gave it to him as a way to show how much of a sonsband he was.
---
10000% true
---
We need that too. Flippin the bird.
---
Right now it is smaller.  Not sure if the ammo glitch was fixed
---
Remember the effects of empath. Very exploitable if everyone has it. You’re pretty much unkillable with 2 or 3 teammates. Imagine 4! 
---
I almost never crash on ps4, nor do my friends on ps4 or pc. Sometimes it's probably just problematic downloads  due to isp that made tiny hiccups and get fixed after enough reinstalls. Then again not having a lot of stuff downloaded on systems also seems to help us
---
This game already has worse loot than Diablo III vanilla and you want it nerfed?
---
Oof. 
---
How long does the deathclaw stay?
---
I saw a scortched one hand a flamer 
---
But just picture it...someone starts talking to you, and you say, over the mic, "sorry dude, I don't have a mic", then walk away.
---
Ah...bad jokes...they are the best &lt;3
---
I get you, I've worked close with customer support once, and I always have tried their suggestions even if I think they're not gonna work. It has never worked for me because I don't ask customer support for basic problems, I directly ask for someone higher up to help because I know the problem is more serious than turning on and off. I get it's them just weening out the ones that do work but I ask for an actual fix to the root of the problem.
---
Arktos is another one of those places like Monongah, where if you want to nuke it, you really do need to check the spawns there beforehand. Because I've been there a few times, and it definitely spawns scorched sometimes.
---
PA has some hidden values, no matter how much I stack on normal armor I'm far tankier in PA. Especially vs Ghouls due to rad resist.
---
About 2 minutes
---
Or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVI6Js49D14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVI6Js49D14)
---
I miss versus mode guy.
---
I’m interested in why people get so upset about their camp being wrecked. It’s a game feature; don’t the perk cards for wrecking ball embolden this behavior? It sort of adds to the excitement to me. Ive caught someone wrecking my camp and got some good cash off of them. 
---
What would make people happier at a systems level? Are you mad at the individual or the game system? What could be fixed to make you all happy? 
---
This stuff has a low soft cap. Even with 2000 resist I can't begin to match PA or Hazmat.
---
I am not sure how cacheing works in fallout76 with respect to multiple characters, but some people on consoles at least have reported that deleting the cache helps fix connectivity problems.  Your character data are stored in the cloud. It may be worth your while to delete the game and reinstall from the Bethesda launcher. 
---
It can stay a long as you want but if another player kills it then that’s it. A way to negate the chance of that though is to turn passive mode on so other players can’t hurt it (nukes can though). However, enemies can kill them. I’m not quite sure if it’s a glitch or not but they will resplendent if you leave and join a different server but if you wait too long it will despawn. 
---
I know the "daily challenges" are meant to generate daily check-in, but they aren't overly compelling and the disconnect between collecting 10 measly atoms and the item you will eventually buy 1 month from now is real....I like ESO's monthly log-in rewards structure, lots of junk leading up to something good if you do it enough that month.
---
I felt like that up until i got raided by assholes so many times that i needed to get more reclused
---
That's kind of BS. I tried to take a 90 Albino Deathclaw hit in hazmat. It didn't end well.
---
The mire
---
Also got my first one recently, TSE Single action revolver level 10... I’m level 90
---
I am angry?
---
How do you tame animals? 
---
A lot of investment and can't be used in endgame and the best farm in the game.
---
Use this please I need footage
---
Genius.  I looked through all your pictures, well done. So do you actually trade from here? Like a bot in the stall? I'd go there to trade.
---
Have you tested it on enemies?
---
There was also posts from people that said they'd had things stolen through the trade glitch. That wasn't real.
---
Or that people would lose all items and be killed from across the map because there's no encryption... Which there is. And it wasn't real.
---
People make shit up all the time about this game. I don't know why but they do.. Don't be surprised if people ask for proof of these controversies.
---
You need assassins sentinel. 15% * 5 = 75% when standing
---
Sentinel = 8% *5 = 40% 
---
Bring dodgy 30% Damage reduction.   
---
Bring blocker 45% melee reduction. 
---
It's right in the description. 
---
Coincidentally, as of the Jan 10 patch the launcher will delete a junction directory and try to install the game in the original location (As I just found out when wondering why my SSD was suddenly 40GB fuller and realized the update deletes the junction)
---
Fixed mine. I just got out after hop. Changed out of my golf outfit and it’s all good now
---
Please add * I bought a mic just for this game. So please talk too me" emote
---
Or decontamination shower.
---
Sentinel is unreliable in pve. Melee, stagger, and heavy ranged bullets stop it.
---
So my weapon damage as seen on pip boy is always accurate? There's no visual glitch with it?
---
Power up Poseidon or something and get them free 
---
Sure its just a game, however the game is constantly changing and it requires consistent flow of money and a satisfied playerbase, its important for community input no matter how small to keep a game fun and entertaining and not just leave it up to Bethesda to figure out, nerfs are always easy for a game company to issue but keeping your overall player base happy is another issue entirely, if fallout fans are fed up with bethesda’s solutions to issues they created on their own by releasing the game too early then the company wont continue to see much revenue from sales of fallout 76 or spend money in the atomic shop thus leading to halted development of a game that could have continued to push out more content. If bethesda cant meet their financial goals then Shareholders of TTwo (bethesda softworks) might be hurting as well since they invested real money.  
---
Looking for a more approximate time with a timer. My ssd attached via USB takes about 1:54 minutes
---
yeah that would be a requirement, but not all items should accept it. weapon displays though should always accept it.
---
I've seen the rumbling and heard a large machine retreating into the earth that's mentioned here, but couldn't see anything around me. Looked it up, found posts about it, but nobody could find the source. Decided it was a bug and moved on. Sad to hear it was incomplete or cut content, it really had me intrigued. 
---
Yes. Its also representative in my dmg numbers via pipboy. 
---
You've clearly never bought drugs
---
I’m on PS4. I think I can get through the cave just fine with my weapons and armor. I know there is a pretty high level SB at the end but the limited space gives the player an advantage. I’ve used this cave to power level with a higher level friend back when I first started. He pretty much soloed her with a normal rifle and fire axe. 
---
Thanks for the tips though. I think most of us have vented various frustrations with the game on here at some point. My gripes have mostly been about crashes and poor end-game design. 
---
LOL. I should have spotted that, but I wanted there to be something called a stealth bot that I hadn't discovered yet. 
---
I have a lvl 50 Perfect Storm, its great.
---
Read it. It literally says wider sweet spot for one hour
---
I’m interested in the funeral service. How does that go down? 
---
Lmao irl
---
Sometimes they just make the lockpick easier. They may not let you pick a higher lock but they make the sweet spot wider.
---
You want or would trade decon shower plans?
---
" Create amazing builds Find new, better areas to build your camp and create incredible creations. "
---
Maybe after they stop most guns from sucking and fix rad resist.
---
Exactly, which having a fortified base would be much more interesting.  I like camps and workshops but I’m the type of player that would have built an incredibly safe space with other players so there would be a tiny beacon of light in the harsh wasteland. The interest to me would then be how to apply defenses and structures to be the most useful. Wasteland engineering.
---
I'd like to see something like this, would be awesome if we could put our player vendors there too.
---
Oooooooooo 
---
The exploding prefix on guns that aren't ballistic make them behave very strangely. 
---
Like laser weapons don't get any bonus damage, it just makes the weapon have an AOE. So they still suck. 
---
I run the Watoga Civil Center for legendaries and I usually rack up a decent amount of XP from there. There's always high level Scorch and normally 1-2 legendary drops. 
---
With my melee build anywhere with a high amount of scorched is usually a good farm since they only take a hit or two regardless of level. 
---
What platform you on and what sentials you got ? 
---
Oh nice!! I'm close but I still have a few things to get. :)
---
Great idea, but they still have a lot of things to fix before they start doing stuff like that. Good concept but the game just isnt ready for something like that
---
Got a 1000 .308 up for sale 
---
Just got a BOS hood, it looks really good with the gas mask. 
---
I've encountered him multiple times at low levels 
---
He would stalk me then once I looked at him he took off (shame would love to get closer to him) but then I did the "path to enlightenment" and met the very friendly "wise mothman" he was kind enough to have a photo with me but since lvl 50+ never seen him again
---
If you went through six guns and a lot of ammo you aren’t really equipped to handle the queen 
---
Thanks for letting us know I don’t know what we would do otherwise.
---
Look at the magazine in the pip boy menu and it tells you what each one does. I doubt there are any that add an extra level. I've found one that made lockpicks unbreakable for an hour and I imagine there are others that make the sweet spot bigger
---
Sorry i forgot to mention i dont care for pvp
---
Citing the description: “For the time when you want literally everything in Camouflage patterns.”
---
It took time for me to get used to it. 
---
If someone has a decontamination shower, I will trade handmade rifle plans for them.
---
I have an Anti Armor Explosive MG42. The explosive legendary effect plus demolition expert is the only thing that makes that gun not a pathetic peashooter. 
---
Now it'll add a whopping 8 damage to the gun after the nerf... Yay...
---
Probably save you hundreds hours of waste of time because there's nothing to do at the end game I walk around pick up garbage and recycle it rebuild your camp
---
Depends is the person dead dead or not dead quite yet but should be soon.  Just aking cause the bullet costs extra lol  
---
For real
---
That videos great, he always made some entertaining content. Which design for Liberty Prime is your favorite though? Or do you have a better idea?
---
Wanna meet at the church in flat woods add me
---
A lot of this stuff is not *cut* as such - it's disabled or was re-used elsewhere in the game. This includes the content intended for post-release, which all shipped with the game and most of which can actually be made to work, if you understand Bethesda's technique and convention for disabling content intended to be enabled later (if they choose to do so). The assets for most of the things you describe, including all the quest/event coding and configuration, are all in the game. For example, the random encounters such as the 'date' with Jesse the Assaultron simply need a specific global variable setting to trigger as they are entirely client-side.
---
In most cases, the upcoming 'events' need a specific keyword match as well as a global variable setting to get them to trigger as they are partially controlled server-side. **Disclaimer: since the b.e.t.a. ended, modding the parts of the game that can accomplish these things will certainly get you banned based on Bethesda's recent actions.**
---
FWIW, the **Reactivate Assaultron** thing you mention is still in the game but recycled, it's the sequence for activating the damaged Assaultron by the entrance of the Enclave Bunker; the  **Nuke Briefcase** was recycled as a (currently disabled) random event in the Savage Divide region where entering a suit of Raider Power Armor triggered a message telling you it was booby-trapped to explode; the **Alternate legendary mutations** are leftovers from Fallout 4 where they were unused and instead a generic 'Legendary Enemy Has Mutated' message appeared etc...
---
Spolier - &gt;!completing 'Event: Race for the Presidency' is what grants you the Enclave rank of President of the United States, allowing access to the Executive Suite and rewarding you with a Presidential Seal from the dispenser. The Presidential Seals can be used to obtain the Presidential Power Armor, Presidential 'power' Suit and the Presidential Guass Rifle which cost 1 Seal each. Becoming President however still does not allow you to access those hand-scanner locked doors in The Whitespring and nearby cottages.!&lt;
---
oh snap i remember arktos pharma, i noted it as a good place for combat rifle mods when i was lvling up because it had a shitload of scorched all over the place, guess if they turn into ghouls then thats great
---
What is there to doubt? That there are still people with millions of items? 
---
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy]
---
First, RadAway is not considered a chem by Travelling Pharmacy
---
Then, Wanted players only lose 15 caps at most but I lose 90 caps due to my level if I get killed by them
---
And my bloody mods get scrapped for junk when I am repairing things (which is getting resolved I heard)
---
argh
---
I do the same and wear the surgical mask+welding goggles. It gives my character a wasteland explorer vibe. Love it. 
---
I have seen the garbage nature of all energy weapons talked about more or less since the beta (I have turned to the Commonwealth into my own personal ashtray for a few years now but have ashed maybe 3 tangos in well over a hundred hours of play in 76), and I know I've seen a discussion about flamer ammo this very day. 
---
So -- you are definitely not alone with your concerns.
---
I'd prefer a plasma grenade launcher to just about anything else in the energy weapon spectrum at this point. Of course there is no such thing, although it would make perfect sense.
---
Good idea. I'm gonna try it when I get home. 
---
I did have greeny boys spawn inside vault tec university when I nuked it so the high school should too. 
---
I’ll trade you the gun in the picture. Xbox
---
Any place with *a load* of ghouls more specifically
---
Incorrect.  Building at a workshop will only pull from your own supply if you have used up what the workshop has. If the numbers are in green, it's from the workshop.  If the numbers are white, they are yours
---
Sudoku it is.
---
It'll buff out.
---
Equipping that actually makes my powerfist damage go down by almost 200. Its weird, my other weapons only gain like 50 damage when they should be getting way more. Something is bugged because none of my damage numbers are acting right when it is equipped
---
Really? I did not know that. Good to know
---
Just go to a power plant and do a event there first time I did it I got them
---
There’s plenty of rare cosmetic stuff in the game.
---
The stuff in the Atomic shop isn’t rare. Literally everyone can get it. Without paying a dime.
---
Your points are all wrong. 
---
And no the whole point of the game isn’t to chase rare stuff. That’s your thinking.
---
The point of the game is to have fun.
---
The normal energy weapons are kinda weak too compared to others like the lever action. I love the laser rifles design and sound but it is too weak for me to keep in my limited inventory.
---
Yeah. Some times I get swarmed by 50+ robots. Most other times it's level 20s. Or sometimes almost nothing spawns in the last room. The silo itself was cool the first few times but it needs to be harder. 
---
Yes the smart thing to do would be check it 1st. I’ve only had ghouls show up for me so far. 
---
WOW, so pretty much useless.
---
Maybe you should, I have never broke a weapon taking down the SBQ.  It's not your game, people can do what they like,  if you don't like it just keep drilling them....
---
Need 308 or selling?
---
Added you send invite 
---
Do enough people use the chat mod to be worth it? And do you mind if I come take a look? I love building into the terrain.

I totally agree with you, I just don't know how this would be implemented, like how can it be done without other players taking what you have placed. Maybe through the atom shop? 
---
I love my ts guass... too bad they r nerfing it. It doesnt need nerfed
---
I think TheLoneWanderer replied to a thread saying that the team knows about the sub par preformance of energy weapons and was looking to balance them.
---
Honestly, just make anti armor perks effect energy resistance and they'll preform much better. The durability wouldn't be that much of an issue if the enemies didn't need 3x the amount of shots to die. 
---
Maybe
---
Either way if it says it or not it's pretty scummy and scammy. 5 bucks for a paint job for one of the shittiest weapons in game?
---
Just in time to be nerfed by Todd and his gang :-)
---
It went on for three days for me then we lost power (which meant a full PS4 reboot) and the problem seemed to go away. No idea if "A" means "B", but doing a complete shut down and restart couldn't hurt.
---
Changing the terrain might cause some pathing problems
---
I'd settle even for alternative textures on things like buildings, floors, plants. Everything should look burnt. 
---
Provide screenshots then.
---
Try to find some prime receivers for your highest DPS weapons, and scrounge for the materials for buckets of Ultracite ammo.
---
I have a headset but half the time game chat randomly doesn’t work for me.  Party chat always works.
---
Congratudolances. I’d ride that Gauss Rifle like I freaking stole it until the patch hits friend.
---
I just find it silly they say “Literally everything” LITERALLY is improper word choice
---
Or I can keep having fun exploring this massive world and do challenges for Atoms. That's my endgame while I wait for more updates
---
Lol lvl 102 and you didn't feel like you were end game yet
---
Dropping it worked, but then you're at the mercy of someone running up and nicking it.
---
It did actually start working later on in the day. Games been so unstable this weekend I'm not surprised.
---
So you are telling me, that you running the same quests and SBQ all the time for absolutely nothing in return is fun?
---
I have 2 pet peeves about this:
---
1. Atoms aren't real money even though you *can* buy them with real money.  I have around 3000 atoms, I don't have $30.  So saying a paintjob costs $18 is kind of disingenuous when you can get free atoms pretty easily.
---
2. You can either have free content and paid cosmetics, or paid content with new cosmetic items.  You can't have continuous development without a revenue stream.  The base game has a 100+ hours of content.   There's a really strange sense of entitlement.  I grew up buying games at $50 a pop and half the time they ended up sucking.  If you can enjoy 60 hours of a game ($1/hour) you got your moneys worth imo.
---
Funny how they demand I respond within 4 days. Though they take their sweat little time. The fact they can take away every game you own on the Bethesda Launcher (this includes creation club purchases) (due to essentially deleting your entire Bethesda account over an ingame infraction) is absolutely unacceptable and is genuinely robbery. NO games do that, nobody bans you from accessing other games you might own from them except for Nexon. What a horrible business practice. Sure people shouldn’t cheat, Bethesda shouldn’t also file sniff without consumer knowledge. At this rate you can essentially get banned for having a cheating program on your pc. 
---
Yup I've recently started to do something like this as well.. 
---
Nothing worse them coming to the end of your 'junk run' and this happens. Ah well luckly break for you!
---
I’d love to see it implemented. Increases immersion and it’s just plain dope like you said.
---
For reals. I want my atom back lmao
---
Furious on its own is very good IMO; I think a lot of people undervalue it right now due to the TSE frenzy. They really shine against enemies with a lot of HP, and other players. Granted, its only good with weapons that have a medium to high ROF, but damn it feels like a chaingun spinning up when it starts cranking out the damage.
---
I mean, probably, we’re playing FO76
---
Mine goes up and down when I equip cards like Bloody Mess and weapon damage cards
---
Do Challenges for Atoms! There are daily, weekly, and tons more and they all give sweet Atoms!
---
I like it because I can change my playstyle whenever I like—sniper, melee/shotgun, power armor/heavy weapons and, soon, bloodied/nerd rage/adrenal reaction.  
---
Good point
---
It's not rare if you can buy it... with currency that you can earn in the game no less. 
---
Have you tried moving your base? May help :(
---
Agreed... nerf explosive not 2shot...
---
^This.
---
Yeah I love it
---
That's the thumbnail description, not the actual description. You have to expand the entry, not just buy off of the main page. Buyer beware has been a thing a lot longer than any of us have been breathing. So has buyer's remorse though. 
---
Isn't it like 500 credits anyway? You can earn that in 3 days easily. For free. By barely going out of your way. Nothing to cry about. 
---
Yep no problem with resists in only hazmat for my unarmed alt.   Still trying to make the low HP work, though.  The 30% stuff, sure.  But nerd rage?  That’s random-one-shot-from-invisible-underground-damage range, but working on it.
---
You're telling me there being a chance of getting some random hat or something would suddenly make that more fun? Considering the drop rate on anything else...
---
I let a griefer I know I can take kill me a few times to get their bounty up.
---
Then I kill them, take their stuff and my stuff back, and change servers without a single word.
---
They are dead for sure 
---
I dont know but that is ultra gay
---
Sure.  One-Shotted and Bullet Sponge are polar opposites of the spectrum. The gist is that they offer some sort of challenge.  In their current incarnation glowing ones are being one shot or 1/10th of a second killed. So some improvement to defenses is I think in order
---
Make a good enough one or make enough noise or just get lucky- they lurk here.
---
I wear one as a single man so bloated ghouls will stop hitting on me.
---
1 impulse buy I've been really happy with. They caught me right as I hit 1800 Atoms for the second time.
---
I wish there were excavator and ultracite paint jobs.
---
Dude two shot isn’t op. I just got a two shot 50 cal and it still takes time to kill. People just bitch over anything 
---
""Stop this, stop that, do what I say.""
---
Fucking make me.

Aight bitch

You can play through speakers with a Mic still...

I just discovered this spot a few days ago. Great for farming legendaries. I usually get more experience doing monster mash, but I loved coming here. Found some pretty decent stuff

Ok I’ve got shower plans I’ll do that trade

Yes.

I don’t play for loot and being Uber and having awesome gear.

I play for fun.

It's a shame since the perk works well with Marsupial, Scaly Skin, Grounded and Bird bones...
---
to report what sorry? He killed you he didn't DUPE you!
---
If he had a TSE and popped a bobble head or two hes going to rip through you, were you in power armour?
---
He was probably someone's alt, using more than 1 bobble head at a time. Something Bethesda hasn't acknowledged as a bug or an actual legit mechanic.
---
Level 3 wasteland whisperer and animal friend. 
---
Oh hey, I like Team Fortress 2, too.
---
T60 and power patcher at max rank keep me happy.
---
I meant dupe in how does a level 12 have a TSE already? also he didnt just kill me he killed and went after everyone in the nuke zone
---
also the bomb does minimal damage (but like, would it even matter if it didn't? even if it was instant death if you failed the skill check who cares? death is nothing in this game)
---
Angellina_jolie 
---
They said it will be coming later on but yea it would be nice
---
im gonna try swapping the perk in and out, heard it can solve the issue
---
Bit of an exaggeration, agreed. Still fkn annoying to have to carry lowbies though.
---
There’s no such thing as standard p2p
---
It’s what you think is fair or can get. That’s what his it’s supposed to be.
---
It works well with everything except adrenal reaction for whatever reason. It worked perfectly fine up until the most recent patch
---
I mean that my mic is on my headphones, but headphones are uncomfortable for me to wear for hours at a time, which is how I play fallout.

Holy crap man, calm down!  No need for all caps!
---
Makes obligatory rant post ranting about how you want others to stop ranting incessantly. Love it. 
---
I thought the reason people used Bird Bones in power armor was for the synergy of jet pack with Marsupial and Bird Bones. When you use all three you (supposedly) can almost fly. I was wondering whether the effect was cool enough to warrant a loss of Strength. 
---
If they ever released a paid unique PA or armor set people would lose their fucking minds.
---
Damn, got that Junon look going on.

Everything gets downvoted when posted. Some people hate that you're playing this game.
---
The watoga train station gets quite a lot of player traffic. 
---
Got to site alpha, Charlie,  or bravo  get the launch codes off the internet because getting them is awful have a nuclear key card in your inventory , go down the elevator at site alpha lets say and a mission will start then do that and launch your nuke. You must be bugged because the porto potty is where you end up after the nuke I thought that was pretty funny tbh.  That's if you don't fast travel out and use the elevator of course . Go nuke some stuff my dood .  Havw fun.
---
Don't have a cheating program on your computer
---
It was lvl 80 for me... but your right, those tumor bats arent bad at all when they are on the ground.
---
Good luck friend!
---
I found a lvl 5 explosive pipe pistol around the flatwoods area, so it's not impossible.
---
His main character could be level 50000 with hundreds of TSE's though (exaggeration ofc but you get my drift).
---
Duping is a very specific exploit and has nothing to do with killing people. Cheating is a possibility but just because he has a TSE and killed a few higher level players doesn't mean hes cheating 1 bit....could be, but it doesn't mean that 100%.
---
They REALLY need to make the Demolitions perk not apply to balistic/flame etc. weapons - only to mines and grenades...
---
Finished, first time drawing one, hope you enjoy

200 lbs of bulked junk seems like a months worth of junk runs. It worked out well for me and I never saw the guy as I walked back to camp but if I were him I’d consider quitting.

u/lonevaultwanderer is around some times *shrug*

I did meat a guy who called me a "dickanus" for not acknowledging him...  I remembered it because that is a very unusual insult and I didn't understand the anatomy of it
---
I did most of the lvling in the first two weeks when killing random supermutants were almost as good as bloated glowing ghouls. Now I’m just doing random missions
---
a Two shot explosive is the difference. I watched them kill other ppl in the nuke zone. No way do they cut thru 5+ ppl...also had pacifist mode on so they had to have a crazy build as well or a 3star at level 12.
---
Question I ask all PS4 players. PS4 Pro or not? I've been getting the impression that Pro's are more susceptible to crashes since the last update than regular PS4's.
---
There’s a bug we’re if some of your stuff is on you and the rest in your stash box it won’t craft. 
---
Stick it all in your stash box.
---
If your stash box is full, take some stuff out to put the stuff in.
---
And for those who don’t want to watch at all, what’s up.
---
Mothman spawns fairly regularly at night just south of Flatwoods (between the Red Rocket and the car on the road on the outskirts of town).
---
Thanks for also posting it with the persons gamertag. Easy to report and have them banned
---
Just because you don’t get off the game doesn’t mean everyone else easily gets it as they go. I’m only level 20 in the game and haven’t spend a dime on atoms with 700 total. I’ve played over 3 days. 
---
Getting rid of health with level was a right step in getting rid of bullet sponges. The weapons just need to be balanced as they're seemingly too weak or too strong.  I just got done watching Aliens and the Xenomorphs can take like 7 or 8 bullets it seemed.
---
I sort of wish there were no offensive perks so the weapons could be balanced based on caliber or energy rating 
---
Unarmed, 1h, and 2h are all affected by perks saying melee, so yes
---
I spent the better half of today doing about 15 of my built up treasure maps. I didn't get a single item related to power armor. Rng sucks :( 
---
Sometimes if I have very limited time to play I will set a very restricted set of objectives for myself, like scrounge for one specific weapon repair or armor repair, or (if I'm very close to leveling up) to level up. Survival games are like that. Please don't take it personally. 
---
Often when I'm in that sort of mode, very focused, I will play **without a mic**. 
---
The game desperately needs a no mic emoji.
---
Finally, I don't know what platform you are on, but my experience on Xbox is that the game social layer and the console social layer interact **really badly** with one another and I might not even be able to respond appropriately to your team request.  I've often been in an inventory management menu hell or looking at the map when a team request came in, and I couldn't respond to it before a declination was sent. I generally feel awful about this because I hate to be rude.
---
Scorched wearing a sombrero, riding a scorched beast with a mushroom cloud behind it.
---
No but theres a bobblehead exploit where you can stack the infinitely 
---
My point mostly being it's hard to try most builds when most guns are trash. Pistols are just very low rifles. Energy guns break in seconds.  Rad resist issues make everyone just use the same PA builds. 
---
I remember that, just was amazed at what I saw and thought maybe a bloodied fat man or something. 
---
Don't run mods on your PA helmet. I took off my targeting HUD and haven't crashed since. I think someone posted about it earlier.
---
I just don't know what you mean by end game besides like a souped up house. I'm not too many more levels than you and I just buy whatever I need from vendors when I need to craft
---
They never said they can tell how much you have in your inventory, they said they can tell who is using or busing items. If he trades 2000 disease cures this would flag his account. having it on his person will not.
---
Could be fun to draw
---
No, even then the durability is absolutely bonkers at for them.
---
This is very true, but i feel like if someone gets lucky enough to find a good legendary, it could be viable.
---
No, most likely the bobble head exploit.
---
To be fair to Bethesda, the recoil from the artillery would probably destroy the roof. 
---
Good idea. We already see people's level and name floating over their heads. It would be trivial to add a symbol for no-mic. They could even change the color or shape of the box which contains the level number. 
---
+10 points for killing in style with a drill.
---
Yeah I still highly doubt it. Most likely some bobblehead stacking. Also, the SBQ hp scales with players so less players = less hp. Could be something legit, but most likely not
---
I think you mean cape xxx
---
Does this work for other issues as well? Whenever I load my game (the past 4 times this weekend, another 3 times about two weeks ago), either my guns won't show up in my hands, or my Pip-Boy will be blank and set to "0000 JAN 0000", or I'll try to open my Pip-Boy and it just shows my arm. In all 3 of those types of error, the game locks up pretty hard and I have to manually quit the game on Xbox One and start it up again. 
---
Let us pray to Wooby to grant us his bounty
---
You seem to forget the human nature of "I want it now" which they count on so you can buy it. You think they put stuff for limited time only because its really limited. No, they do it to so u can have a sense of urgency to spend money because it may not come back. Earnings atom is slow and tedius.
---
In that case I have the cannibal perk so we could do a sky funeral or I can just take the person to a place where we all float down here.
---
"Rarest items"
---
According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9wogg/event_related_cosmetics_reward_list_full) theres a 1/35 chance for an event cosmetic drop. Thats less than 0.03%. And then you have to have the luck to get the item you want, because several cosmetic items are on the list. Rare is an understatement. Screw event cosmetics. I tried to farm them but its not feasible.
---
The portapot is the exit for a missile solo,out only. The entrance is nearby and a marked map point. Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie are the three silos, if you haven't found them yet, you can get the marker locations from the map in the enclave bunker military wing.
---
The decrypted launch code is a bit more complicated. It is found by finding code pieces on scorched/ghoul officers (the ones that make a belong sound). Each silo has a unique code that is changed every week.  Letters are also uncovered in the enclave bunker as the week goes on. Use the word to solve a cypher then you'll have alaunch code. 
---
You'll definitely need help from others to solve the whole puzzle. There are videos on YouTube with all the directions, there are some programs people have written to help crack the code, or just look here on reddit (the community solves it pretty fast after a new code is issued). 
---
Meant duping in as in obviously they either are sharong TSEs or cheated like you said.
---
My first exp with one. Ive been fortunate enough to have good gameplay and players throughout my 150 levels.
---
But the way people speak about what to look for. thats gotta be an obvious cheat.
---
PC
---
Regular PS4. 
---
Make it possible to lose it, but more importantly **do not guarantee success**
---
Any game wide event should be wholly possible to fail if we don't hit a goal
---
It can yes but I'm not 100% on those issues. 
---
Happened to me just now.  Anyone know what's up with this?
---
Oh!  Good find.  My dad would love one as a birthday gift.
---
If I had the coin I would award you. Post saved.
---
Having squads within a team could work,  something like battlefield
---
you never know wht they have planned. If the entire internet of the story was to tell about a wasteland that was killed by a plague then having "human npcs" pop up for no reason would be pretty sillly ;)
---
I want them to add "post offices" to key hot spot locations. Each with 10 or so mail boxes that we can deposit free stuff in for people to come and take and leave their own. 
---
Should let us hot wire an eyebot or hack and then jump on the back of it to use as a mount, or maybe even a Buttercup we can stick an engine on!
---
Sadly I very much doubt the server or engine can take anything moving faster than it does now though :(
---
And i cant even delete a wall piece because of floating roof errors while it is connected on 3 other sides
---
Was it probably on the way to sell at a vendor without a nearby stash 
---
Yeah man, they have black powder hunting seasons in my state of North Carolina. I'm sure there are other states that have similar hunting seasons.
---
yeah cause bethesda knows all like how to release a bug riddled game that crashed 5 times in 20 minutes
---
Who says I was mad?
---
...I honestly didn’t think that level of idiocy was possible...
---
Not much of a friend; arguably better off without them.
---
Well for one, all energy weapons break like glass candy right now so factor that in. Also the damage is pretty dogshit right now so factor that in as well.
---
Now factor in how dope you look rocking a green Mars Attacks plasma flamethrower and how much you won’t be giving a fuck cuz of how cook you look and feel in streams and giant balls of green fire and how much you don’t give a fuck how weak it makes you. 
---
Personally I use a TSE shotty for solo rolling and I keep my Plasma Flame-thrower ready for when there are groups and I’m trying to only tag mobs and not be a douche and one shot em before others can tag.  
---
Fave gun for weeks right now. Try it out yourself!
---
I still want it to be somewhat realistic, but that would be cool to mess around with for a day. 
---
Just don't buy them. Demand drives supply and VV. If we don't participate in the market it dies 
---
I've been able to get multiple a day, but I have to server jump. I've noticed the frequency has gone down, I used to get a mutation after gaining ~900 rads, now it's probably somewhere between 2000-3000 rads. 
---
That would have been interesting to see
---
 You are missing the entire point of the game. Everyone is dead. That's the point. ;)
---
 We should all know each other as we were in the Vault together for years. We are the only hope humanity has and everyone who fought died, up till now. 
---
Should come visit my red rocket garage
---
Love the concept!
---
The trick is to kill them first.
---
Blocker and high health helps.
---
Rock on dude!
---
Good to know thank you for that info!
---
I'm out of main missions and just have the mole miner locker radial in side quests :_(
---
I saw this gripe initially by players and it was a bit like well they did say this is how it was going to be. So the initial moans were just a bit like okay cool maybe listen to what tools howard said and their vision of the game at launch.
---
 However I like your idea of the next chapter. You had the DLC in fallout 4 nuka world and the varying types of raiders which was cool. The argument is easily there, it'd be natural to move on and travel if you have used up all your resources in the area. After 25 years people in neighbouring states who weren't in a vault and didn't turn ghoul may need to branch out.
---
There's a perk that reduces junk weight so he may have been carrying all of his junk on him.  RIP
---
I was actually thinking since Mama Dolce's is a processing plant the communists could just switch on a button and were actually secretly making parts for their own giant death robot of their own using data stolen from a Liberty Prime manufacturer.
---
In principle i agree with you but how do you know all of these are banned dupers? Is it something they print in their trade post or just bring up via voice chat? I mean who would vent that in this game given most players hate them?
---
This does not make sense at all to me. At all.

Where's Ackbar when you need him?

Shhhh lol.

I love this place and no one ever claims it.

Awesome man, I’ll be able to jump on in around 5-6 hours from now, any chance you’ll be on?
---
I’ll add you now :)
---
I play like maybe an hour a day. 2 if I'm lucky. 
---
My highest character is level 42
---
Atoms fall in your lap constantly. Especially in the beginning. I just started a new account to start fresh from the beginning. I wanted an outfit that cost 700 atoms. It took me an hour and a half maybe. 
---
There are daily and weekly challenges you can do for around 500 atoms a week. And that's on top of the something like 4000 points you get from super easy challenges like pick 7 locks or collect 76 wood strait from the beginning. 
---
Unless you want every single limited time power armor paint or fruit hat than there are plenty of atoms available. 
---
I'm on PS4 but sidenote. Me and my buddy were talking about how everybody thinks that it's necessary to add 66* or 420 after their gamertag.  I don't get that. Is it supposed to be scary? Does is it supposed to show us that you worship the devil?

Hope not.

I live in Charlotte! I'm a pretty regular shooter too. I don't know why I've never known about this up until now lol. 
---
Count me in! I use the same gamer tag. Always willing to trade or drop plans and loot.
---
Art imitating life...
---
The less we tag them on pointless shit, the better...
---
The reason they haven't done this is because it's too much for the servers to track in multiplayer. If they had to remember where every last pool ball or teddy bear was every time you logged in we wouldn't be able to play. I know that sucks but that's the reality of it.
---
That said, we should have more decoration options like camp items storing certain things and showing them, like magazines in the racks or bobblehead stands. That might be more feasible then just junk being placed randomly.
---
And in fact, if you don't take everything that instances for you from a looted corpse, the remaining meat pile is just one additional thing the server has to keep track of.  Clean and scrap, clean and scrap.
---
Is the bolt action pipe rifle the only one that can drop with legendary?
---
Ill give you an add dude, I’ll be jumping on in around 5-6 hours from now. Will message you if you’re interested
---
No its not an obvious cheat, he could have looted A TSE on his level 500+ character and given it to his level 12 character to come and murder noob's that don't understand the game in whitespring.
---
People wonder why there's so much hate and anger against Bethesda and its silly titles to posts like this! You have no way of knowing he was cheating, some low level character blew your head off and your first reaction is come to reddit and claim hes duping because he has a certain type of weapon. 
---
Like i said a level 12 with a TSE is nothing major anyone can make a new character and give it weapons and gear, if they popped 5-10 explosive bobble heads before aiming at your head it would have easily taken it off. No one has been able to confirm if using more than 1 bobble heads at a time is a cheat or not and Bethesda aren't mentioning it either so we can assume its alright by them.
---
The way people get multiple stacks of bobble heads is cheating yeah but again you have no clue why you died let alone what build the guy was using so...
---
A constant request from players of the franchise. It's "like horse's in Skyrim" we cry. Yet still no answer to our pleas

West Virginia has a few different black powder hunting seasons. I know a couple people who go every year. 
---
Sweet as, I’ll add you man. Will be on in 5-6 hours from now so I’ll message you if you’re interested in joining.
---
I had not thought about that! This makes a ton of sense. 
---
I was originally going to agree with OP and include a question about the reasoning behind the limit, but this must be the answer. Given this new consideration, I'm on board with Bethesda's choice. Imagine the mutation boosts! Marsupial users would be jumping into the stratosphere, and that's before engaging the jetpack! 
---
A camp on the moon would solve a lot of stash issues though...
---
I feel like there needs to be more in nuked zones but nuke zone npcs are already hell if you don't have good legendary weapons. Seriously try soloing a group of glowing ones with just a plain level 50 weapon, no jumping up on unreachable places, and most importantly no PA. PA shouldn't have to be the only way to play endgame I feel you PA users with your TSE guns and Melee builds have it too easy
---
Nah I do 200+ in a day easy. Mind you I play about 5hrs a day atm.
---
I don’t know what that is
---
I've done one violent night twice and I dont get a legendary from the wendigo. And feed the people can be more worth it if you get canned meat stew

lol some what realistic....we nuke whitesprings every 1-2 hours and there is still life there!
---
artilary can't fire that close to itself.

I joined up on a few Youtubers Discord to see if I could get Scorch Beast Queen runs ( I dont play Fo76 with friends so trying to find people is tough at times) I recently opened my discord to find multiple people saying they were banned and looking to purchase top tier items with real cash. Firt time I saw this I didn't think to post about it but today I had someone in game asking the same thing, and when I looked on discord it seems to be a trend for those who were banned.

It’s is...  when it works right. I’ve had it lag and be briefly unable to fire sometimes.

Couldn’t agree more

Completely right! Idk how those squirrels do it!

Ya I pimped it out, but it still just looks like a basically harmless drill 🤣

Dont care about duping, i do care when ppl make real make real money.

The dev test messages sound like something that might have been done at the clarksburg shooting range
---
We need a “Go Away” emote lol
---
Honestly it's a bit of a gimmick. There's no great way to get down once you're up there. Like you can't walk downward so the effect is cool once and after that it's kinda annoying. Play with it if you haven't but don't build around it
---
Wouldn’t it be nice...

Thanks!  I guess I noticed that Challenges was in that menu
---
So everyone thats been banned has just bought new accounts and is buying items to get caught up?
---
Win win for bethesda hey! You know they selling TSE's on the side!
---
Thanks!  I'll give it a shot the next time I play.
---
Level 150, TSE Prime .50 Cal, half a dozen other 3* guns. It's not like it was my first Queen fight.
---
I have no idea what to do haha. All of my quest markers take me to "Something Overlook" where the portapottys are. I've been to 2 of the silos and I couldn't access them and when I travel there they aren't marked on my map. 
---
This quest is fucked. 
---
They said they weren’t gonna do it in an interview, sadly, but if they *did* put anything in, it wouldn’t be anything big. At the most, they’d put in something like Mountain bikes or the like. The map is big, but it’s not big enough to have anything as fast as a motorcycle or car, and the only realistically rideable animal would be a ragstag.
---
I would love a quest where we deactivate the facility and rebuild Liberator Prime using junk we’ve collected!
---
No fucking way, I'll have to go look for that lmao. 
---
Flawed. Add the the points needed to spend in shop then compare them to how many total can be earned on your account. Then compare. It’s a fuckin joke mate. 
---
The rate at one can acquire points you could learn maybe one large item a week, maybe, if you play a shit ton. 
---
&gt;could have easily sold them all
---
Not with a 1400 cap vendor limit on vendors per day, haha
---
Dump all the things! (Tip for you, fledgling Watogan, always check the cash register and watoga bot and the blue suitcase, dumping ground for many, haha)
---
 Not exactly news. There’s tons of them out there. Even Walmart sells BP rifles them around here. 
---
I bet we see much more of this now that they nerfed the nuke zones.  People are gonna flock where the best xp is
---
Just dupe for yourself and see what happens. That's the best proof I can offer. I mean, what are you afraid of? There's no proof you're gonna get banned for duping right? Go ahead. Craft 300 boards and stockpile 5 million nuka quantum
---
I've seen him twice in almost 100 levels
---
Well what you're saying isn't entirely right. Maybe for your perks its true.  I have gone into nuked whitesprings and nuked Prime with nothing but a hazmat suit, a 1 star Ghoul slayers or Zealots power fist, some defensive perks, and some radshield and been fine. 
---
I see a whole lot of people commenting who haven’t done their homework on the numbers....
---
That poor .50 Cal...broken in its...*prime*
---
Ba dum tiss!
---
I do lol. I mean it took 3 full days of my PS4 constantly downloading to get just the first patch downloaded. My internet sucks 😑
---
I will do that! Thank you
---
P.S. That wasn't you, was it??
---
The only way I see human NPCs is when the vaults open. 
---
I would pay good caps for the plan if you sell it or know someone that sells it (PS4)
---
Ouch. Yea that wont be a fun reinstall. 
---
Crazier concept to add to this, all Fo4 items should be free.
---
Ain't here for that recycled, repackaging and reselling.
---
🤣
---
Because all of the humans were turned into scorched. That's kinda the whole point. How would they explain why these humans were immune to the scorched plague? 
---
What system you on? If Xbox I can run you through the silo
---
With bloody mess sometimes the pieces are so small I can’t even find them.....
---
Everyone's dead in WV, but definitely not in other places! 
---
And you'd think we would all act like we've known each other for years, but we've done a lot of dweller on dweller killing! Haha, I guess that much time together might also lead to some pent up resentment. 
---
"Finally, I can kill that smug SOB Bob! I saw him get that last piece of pie out of the Port-o-diner... *on my birthday*."
---
That’s disappointing, but wouldn’t it be nice* music 🎵 
---
This is a farce. My gun one shots most shit out here. W
---
With enough persistence and searching you'll get em soon enough :)
---
Yeah, no.  I dont believe you.
---
Mega sloths look mountable....slightly bigger fire ants would be sweet thinking about it! Making a creature handler build somewhat meaningful!
---
Id be happy with a mountain bike or anything though tbh if it gets people out of there PA a bit more :D Doesn't need to be any faster, could literally be a visual to mix it up a little!
---
Yes, of course it could have, but imagine how much HP all those crafting stations have, all the way up 4 stories of my base.  Steel and concrete barriers, stairs, walls, generators, furniture, etc.  Radrats did not do that while I was at Whitespring for an hour.
---
At least someone is telling us about some kind of content! Thanks friend! Bethesda please tell us what's on the horizon for the game!
---
it would be kinda cool if people that played the game in 2018, or something specific, were able to choose one item to get for free each month
---
That's cool, noone cares about you
---
I FT'd to my camp today and found it under seige by 6 major gutsy's - they must have thought I was a communist
---
Trolling in the fo76 forum. Bold move. 
---
Not really RNG, more like EVD, Explosive Vent Dispenser.
---
I think it wouldn’t be a problem if we had groups of raiders periodically try and invade Appalachia in an attempt to re-establish a strong hold there.
---
It could be a new kind of event that last a week. 
---
Small raiding parties that get bigger and bigger. As we wipe them out, the leader of the raiders shows up to make the final push to retake Appalachia. The appearance of the raider leader is the r d if the event. 
---
This has vendors and other plan locations.

---
Most people just dump their unwanted legendaries after the vendors give up all their caps for the day.
---
It's great to go through the local vendors, bags, suitcase, etc...to see what was dumped.  You'll find some great treasures!
---
With competent programming couldn’t they just limit sharing instead of limiting the team size?
---
Hell with that. Add a text chat, you know, like almost every single other MMO game has. 
---
I think you are right about the licensing, but seriously, how much can 70-90 year old songs cost? In comparison to GTA, how much money do they save on music licenses?
---
Ada is an assaultron I thought.
---
Just heavily modified.
---
200 bulk? Like you get a bunch of junk, go to the ammo workshop and bulk it. 200 lbs/day? Dang I’m lazy then.
---
Exactly. The forest area is rich in resources and relatively radiation free. It makes sense for groups trying to move in. Not just raiders but settlers, merchants, military, etc.
---
Ehh who cares, I think sometimes we forget it's only a game
---
I feel that Contractor level 2 and the repair all function have really made it NBD if someone trashes your place. 
---
It's two shot explosive people are complaining about. Because it's ridiculously powerful.
---
Thank you so much, this is perfect 
---
Oh that makes sense then.
---
Okay now try any gun build.
---
The locker is always above ground, just look at the map for the general area
---
I'm happy to have found others to play with. My husband works 12 hour shifts, so he only plays on his days off. He has been a fan since the original Fallout; this is the first one I've played. I've also found a few players that he will team and chat with. Mr. Lone Wanderer is beginning to see the benefits of teamwork.
---
How much does each additional player increase the Queen's HP by? And how does this change happen if new players join in the middle of the event?
---
I thought it would be something like “Unlock with Miners Key” but it was actually just this locker with a ball peen hammer. 
---
You are the dragon born . Ice dragon with anti sonic scream would be awesome 
---
I rarely am able to get all of the loot. 
---
I just love being near people. 
---
Surf boards would work 
---
Uh no my *first* reaction wasnt coming to reddit. my first was watching his gameplay then watching him go back to his camp with a level 200 that had been standing there. dude is an obvious duper because i looted his junk when he did die from overwhelming bloated ghouls. youre gonna tell me someone carrying 500 bulk of springs, gears, steel etc at level *12* isnt an issue?
---
"silly title to posts" whatever dude. keep defending ppl who bring BS to this game. pretty sure theyll constantly do this. but whatever. I do have a pretty good idea of how he was cheating and killed me and others. I was level 150...he was one shotting level 200s as well plus even a couple of 50s...now i know the difference in level is supposed to balance but youre gonna tell me thats normal for ONE level 12 to mop up an entire server?
---
also he responded to my ps4 msg with  "lol what are you gonna do about it"
---
I both love and hate this suggestion, now what I could see is kinda like how Minecraft is made with its world saved to local machine setup if they could allow something like that I would be fine even if I have to start from square one 
---
I have a feeling that they're going to do something like this, but they need to fix the game first 
---
If you need verification you clearly aren't familiar with how you can abuse the game, let's say i duped 10k of big guns bobblehead ( 10 % damage with big guns or somethinfg ) i can activate them all and for 1 hour it stack
---
Basicly you do tens of thousands of damage every shot
---
So despite suggesting a next chapter of the game in my post, and being in support of an evolving plot in 76, one thing I can't sort out is what that would mean for players that buy the game after it moves into a next chapter. Would they just miss out on the content we're currently playing? 
---
I can't imagine they'd move us to a different location because creating a second, adequately sized/detailed map would be a substantial undertaking (I assume). I guess they could make some servers pre-next chapter and post, but there'd be a lot of hurdles to overcome there too. 
---
People acquire that many legendaries in one day?
---
hi
---
It makes sense for there to not be humans around the time of Reclamation Day, but if the plot is to advance, and game be supported for 'years', they will need to shake things up.
---
While the absence of people makes sense for this particular point of the story, it would be silly if it was Reclamation Day forever.  Actual NPCs, or humans should be a thing at some point in the future, it'll just be up to Bethesda to fit them in well with the storyline of 76.
---
The way I see it, there are  definitely a few things in the game that could be compatible with allowing other humans into Appalachia. 
---
Raiders who want to pillage the land, and hamper our efforts of rebuilding..  
---
Other vault dwellers from unopened vaults..
---
Or even something completely different like Chinese remnant ghouls like the ones from Fallout 3 that seek to conquer Appalachia, or know about the nukes too..
---
There is one on top of Seneca Rocks.
---
yup and goris was the best of them
---
I so want a companion. A dog, a robot, anything. I want him to say snarky things like the Buttons mod from FO4. He’s so lovely.
---
You care a lot, apparently.   That's a whole lot of butthurt radiating from a guy who is trying that hard to play innocent.   But the big difference between you and me, is, I dont have to worry if I can play when I want.
---
I can't find you using your gamertag. You should be able to add me. My gamertag is my username on here.
---
FO3 would permanent kill critical NPC's on spawn.  Which would stop the story cold if the player didn't keep a number of rollback saves.  You may not know the NPC died for a bit which complicated matters.
---
FONV would corrupt during save after roughly one plus hours of play.  I think it would kill critical NPC's and could spawn objects underground as well. Both games would vanish your followers permanently.
---
On console both had a really horrible reputation until around the first DLC.  
---
FO4 is debatable.  While it had issues, the design changes created a hate storm on the fallout sub that lasted until 76 overshadowed it.  Outside the sub however it was quite popular and one of the biggest selling titles they pulled off.
---
FO76 only had one busted side quest on release, no loss of progress bugs, and no lost item bugs.  The design change was objectively the only thing folks could point at, and other then pvp most of them seem to have been to cope with multilayer.
---
Perhaps after a nerf of all explosives and 2 shot on explosives,  we may see more variety in gun types out there.  I would think that would be less strain on a server than tse explosions, thus being more suitable/ resilient for big group defense.
---
I'm looking to trade for one/buy one. I would pay good caps for the plan.
