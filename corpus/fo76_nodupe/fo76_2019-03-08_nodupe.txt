Bruh only engage in trades thru reddit
---
---
---
I've found 1 in 700+hours on xbox.
---
I think the basic highlights are the same for all of them, but some have slightly reversed or rearranged layouts.
---
Unless you're weird, like me, and insist on keeping any of the unique quest rewards.
---
So the real question here is...
---
 
---
Can we nuke the event parade?... üåù
---
hahaahaha
---
I agree, I'd love to wear the faschnacht mask with a hat on top
---
The trade ‚Äúexploit‚Äù that everyone has been talking about since day one was lying. There never has been any way to take items from another players inventory without the other players agreeing. Anyone who said otherwise was a liar. 
---

---
As for trading items and giving your rifle to someone to mod and they don‚Äôt give it back, that isn‚Äôt an exploit. Some people are assholes and unless you know them or they in a community where you can see how trust worthy they are then you are risking your gear. It happens, but there isn‚Äôt really anything that needs to be fixed. 
---
So does the pistol perks and the shotgun perks count towards the blunder? Are there legendary drops?
---
2nd question: keep scrapping till it pops
---
This would make me start playing the game again.
---
+karma
---
Normally I totally would, but this game with limited storage, I only keep what I feel I can sell or use. 
---
For real? Damn I didn‚Äôt know any of this stuff you guys are all telling me. Good to know I guess.
---
 I have too, but what is it's attraction? 
---
 Got Hardened on the second Handemade scrap, and just got it on my Lever Action, at some ungodly number of tries. ;)
---
Breach and clear. Pretty sure that‚Äôs the name. You have to go into the cave (on a timer) and repair the 3 autominer bots. While mining copious amounts of ore (seriously there‚Äôs ore EVERYWHERE) while fending off mole miners. The autominer bots give tokens every so often while they are each alive, and a bonus if all 3 are up. The event is timed, once the timer reaches 0 you have a certain amount of time to get out or you auto die. And you can‚Äôt get back in to get junk. I think it gives you 45s or 1m to get out. But if you‚Äôre far enough into the mine, it still isn‚Äôt enough. The events are short, 5mins plus evacuation. And it‚Äôs possible to catch an event in progress.
---
Just thought I'd let you know 
---
They are weightless so it really doesn‚Äôt matter if you keep them or not.
---
I dont ies power armor hell by glowing sea time I could run it in a hazmat suit. sneak build was more effective that way than trying to sneak in power armor
---
Yep, the placement logic is terrible and it's precisely why you see the "gimp factory" houses built upon a single foundation piece.  As long as that one foundation can be placed, so can the rest of the structure.  The more foundation pieces you have, the more likely you'll run into the baffling "support"/"floating" error.
---
That said, there are some things you can do to make a floating house look more convincing, like using the steel beams under Stairs as "supports" or placing barricades under it.
---
There might not be a motion blur, I don‚Äôt really play anymore but I still follow the game. It‚Äôs prob just DoF
---
&gt; I knew a PvP player that survived with dodgy, cola nut, and chugging nuka quantums.
---
I've learned a lot just by reading your replies in this post. That sounds like a hilariously frustrating build to deal with and maintain.
---
Where did you find the sweet roll recipe? 
---
That's not the exploit I was referring to. No, the trade exploit is that you can't trade X item for Y item. Most people tend to list the exchanged items for 0 caps. Scammers just take the item when listed and never reciprocate. You could charge a cap amount, but there are some items I wouldn't sell for 25k caps. 
---
There needs to be some built in way to exchange item for item without being vulnerable in a trade.
---
Got it, logged on for a second and accepted
---
You don‚Äôt have to be level 40 to launch a nuke. There is not level limit(although I wish there was). The only thing stopping you is completely the main storyline and getting to the Enclave, which you can do early on or wait until much later.
---
They will all have sentry bots, assaultrons, and gutsies. Use explosives, especially mines. Just be careful to not blow yourself up.
---
What ammo you running? If you want someone to help you clear one feel free to add me. my gt is newt341.
---
This sub has 6 mods. Not one of them has posted here in 3 days.
---
Bottom line, nobody cares about maintaining this sub at the moment, hopefully they pick some active new mods soon. 
---
I have duplicates now already.  And I'm level 98.  Its bad.  I didn't know what I was doing.  And I swear it didn't warn me when I choose cards I couldn't use.  Now it will say "full"  or "2 of 3"
---
 I dunno. I just scrap the lot and fire up an all new one, made for my new place. I'm real picky about where I live and I have never found a template that would fit the different topographies very well. 
---
 I don't build tower based things and I understand many of those fit many places. I build a sprawling, two building thing usually.
---
Man I‚Äôd love to know as well
---
Recently saw one for sale at the Harper's ferry vendor bot. Probably should have bought it now that i see this.
---
That‚Äôs what the second part was about. Unfortunately you are responsible for what you give to other players. If you don‚Äôt want to risk losing it then don‚Äôt give it to someone. 
---
A trade menu like that would be good, but I‚Äôd imagine it would be a process where every trade you‚Äôd have to accept which would be pretty annoying. If they could have separate menus that would be great but they won‚Äôt do that. 
---
Yes, but that doesn't mean that I have to consent to all my attacks damaging people. If I take a workshop and 20 minutes later someone launches a nuke, I don't want to have to worry that when I spray bullets at the adds in an SBQ fight I'm going to be initiating PVP with anyone caught in the crossfire. 
---
I play in pacifist by default and it works quite well even when taking workshops. A couple weeks ago when I was on my lvl 18 I took Posidean. A level 54 showed up and started hitting me with slap damage. I gave him the confused emote and then double checked that all my junk was stashed in the stash box I was standing next to. After a minute of him attacking me without me attacking back he finally attempted to claim the workshop and immediately one shot me. By taking the workshop I had consented to PVP but I never promised to put up a fight.
---
I have done this. I went to a single level home from a 2 story and it is pretty nice. The support needed messages were really frustrating. 
---
Yep. I typically run with a luck of 16-18. Everything I find is @ 100%
---
I‚Äôd limit the number of mail to 5 per person/account a day. 
---
I think you can Buy it from a  whitesrpings vendor
---
I think i found one in the raider camps by top of the world and in the lunch box at the enclave service entrance (the one near the train station)
---
Whoaaaa! Screw that
---
Rad. Thanks I like the AP bonus they give and wouldn‚Äôt mind being able to make my own. 
---
Are you talking about jumping again if you hard land on PA?
---
Great, thanks for the answer, I guess I will. ;-) Will only the masks be given out, or will plans also be made available? 
---
Swinging your weapon, y'mean? Know that this has been in since Beta. Bird bones + power armor perk related to weight of PA (which I can't remember right now) kind of negates the need to even do this most times.
---
Craft a power armor torso with emergency protocols, get adrenal reaction and go with a bloodied melee build.
---
I saw one on the fo76bazzar sub, it was bloodied, 40% swing, and +1 str. They wanted like 2500 caps and it had been posted for 4 hours with no comments. I couldn't believe it, too bad it was xbox.
---
I had a nice, mostly realistic brick house with connected garage, decently furnished &amp; wired up, even had a pressure-plate opening front door, separate tent base for camping out, fenced off farm; the works. I'd settled in a region right in the middle so I could fast travel there before fast travelling anywhere distant to save caps in the long run. I guess I shouldnt have done it somewhere popular
---
I doubt we will get a concrete answer on this from a 100% reliable source but CND is certain. However, I started reallocating points in to LCK towards Lv100 and I personally felt a significant increase in well... my Luck. This is of course unfounded and opinion based but I do feel like the quality of my drops are above what I'm used to. I can't quantify it exactly but the Game feels like I'm rolling weighted dice a lot now. The biggest change I've observed is with Cap Stashes. I should probably run tests against a none Luck character to show a measurable difference but every time I find a Cap Stash since specing Luck, I smile cause they feel heavily weighted in my favour. I'm pulling 40+ Caps from (almost)every Stash I find. Which is a big change from almost never finding any note worthy Stashes
---
I'm just gonna do two tents now, one to sleep in and one to craft and just pretend I like it
---
Different SPECIAL stats, different playstyles, different characters, roleplaying potential. Also, I find the first third of the map much more interesting than the later game areas. I'm going to get my level 46 up to 50, but I got fed up of stealth and it would take until level 70 or 80 to re-spec. Easier to start a new one.
---
I forget sometimes.
---
Nope 
---
I'm not worried about him because "He's got a longer yellow streak than a herd of diuretic camels"
---
I think you need to have a foundation to prevent Beds from being on "the floor," where disease is possible.
---
This would be an amazing idea. I would just be curious to see how the logistics would work out when only one player is logged on. In other words, if your team member built a supporting structure and you added on to the top of it which connected to your base, this might create some issues on the server itself.
---
nuke zone..chill around the golf club..everytime a new player comes into that server..it will trigger so many glowing ones..after defeating them..keep running laps inside the golf club to make more spawn..if you are playing with a team or friends i heard that if one of you exit the game and re-join that will trigger the spawns over and over
---
Yesir. üëç üòé
---
I wouldn't be worried about levels. I try to keep my PvP builds under 100 so I lose less caps if I die. Usually you have all the perks you need to fight by 70 and enough QoL perks by 85-95. Any higher than that and you likely screwed something up along the way. If I ever got a PvP player over 140 I'd probably consider transfering their gear, deleting the character, and starting fresh with the same perk point distribution. 
---
But strictly speaking I wouldn't bother with anything that added flat DR. There are perks that reduce % damage that are far better. Lone wanderer is great for a solo. Serendipity and nerd rage (I think this is actually %DR) great for low health builds. Dodgy is great if you don't need AP to sprint or VATS. Flameproof is mandatory at level 2, as well as an armor chest piece with a dense mod on it. Adamantium skeleton is also really important. For full health builds I like just one rank of born survivor (anyhting higher is too much IMO). Blocker is good, but tbh I don't think any amount of melee damage mitigation is enough when it comes to a bloodied melee build. Because of that I just don't waste the perk points. Usually I just carry a weapon that reflects melee damage so I can force them to stalemate with me as we both die. Other than those, really it's just about choosing the appropriate offensive perks. Damage is important, but IMO if you spec too much for damage you're doing much more than you need to. 
---
On the offensive end you need any of your armor pen perks and staggering perks. Crippling perks are nice, but not super necessary IMO since most people heal through a crippled limb. It's useful for people that heal with stimpacks because while you're using a stim you can't fire, sprint, or do much more than move. Better crits is a must if it makes sense for your build. Some people need to one shot so you can turn the tide and a solid crit is a way to get it done. With semi-auto builds you really should spec for more damage since it's best not to rely on multiple shots to kill someone, especially since they'll adapt to the play style quickly. Other than that, it's really dependent on the build. 
---
With weapon condition perks it's kind've a hit or miss. If you're a stealth build, you might be fine skipping out on white knight and lucky break. I prefer to take max points into white knight simply because losing your chest piece mid fight will make you fragile af. If I ever take luck of the draw I only ever take 1 rank. The most I've ever pumped into gunsmith/makeshift warrior was 3 points. If you need higher level modding, just have a friend do it or have a PvE character mod it for the PvP one. You can probably skip out on gunsmith if it's a semi-auto PvP character. I usually keep INT at 3 (and likewise gunsmith/makeshift warrior) so I can still equip level 3 fix it good or weapon artisan.

[removed]
---
I got you! 
---
True, I'm sure they would figure something out though
---
thank you!!
---
Noticed. Yes.  Concerned. No.
---
Can confirm it triggers new spawns. 
---
Had almost the same happen to me, only my camp wasn‚Äôt destroyed. I also am in ‚Äúpacifist‚Äù mode. I had barely any caps (less than 200), and the killer took more than a third
---
To be fair, the auto-doc was kind of a big deal in the Sierra Madre as a wonder of the future, it only showed up in vault city (broken) and i think in one location in Lonesome Road, and then in Big MT which just goes to reinforce how rare and sophisticated it was. And I am pretty sure it was always described as finicky and unreliable, prone to mutilating and going haywire without constant upkeep. Basically, they werent common or widely used. So not working great in 76 and being limited use isn't too big a deal. Didnt the responder doctor lady also make a point about the auto-doc in the basement being a bitch to get working and tricky to maintain?
---
I've got a raised bed, I'll be okay. I've got a power armour station in between them on a connected foundation but if it doesn't place next time it's only 5 mins work to set this basic camp up. Such a shame though
---
10-4. 
---
I know I'm late to the party n all but what a fucking gamer-tag.
---
I completely agree with this, the weight reduction perk to specialise in heavy weapons is perfect as it is. 
---
I switched to heavy from rifle when I realised I could carry a .50 machine gun, auto grenade launcher, lmg and minigun for less than the weight of my .308.
---
I feel there should be a country song somewhere in that last paragraph.

[Here's a post detailing my proposed fixes and bethesda's response](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avqddt/player_trading_is_broken_and_needs_to_be_fixed/)
---
Just yesterday I watched a griefer stroll up to my door, (which wasn't locked just because I like to leave my workbenches open to people passing thru) and I kid you not 4 bullets from a hand made broke my steel door, 5 broke my fusion generator, and preceded to go ham until I logged off before he finished the job.  Why does steel walls and doors provide no less defense than wood? I mean... at least spend a full clip. I want stronger structures.  Not necessarily turrets. That I get. 
---
Bully the weak
---
mats only work in workshops as fast travel mats for some reason they took them out but left it for workshops.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I want to see the ability to have more items in blueprints
---
Its a trap!!!!!!
---
Maybe with the update and new masks?
---
It's 4/20 all month next year.  
---
I suspect the changes to pacifist will roll out the same time as pvp mode. So the griefers will have to chose between pvp mode or hunting around in adventure mode for people that do not have pacifist turned on. 
---
Is there a limit on how close C.A.M.P.'s can be next to each other? 
---
Sure you can't join the structures but having them close together is kind of like having a small village.
---
I can build the flamer, just got on and checked. I have some fuel too and can make fuel also
---
It doesn't really surprise me, because there seem to be two versions of various food where one is irradiated and the other isn't (the same is true of Salisbury Steak) and the crafting system is hopelessly naive about requirements.  It's the same reason why soups require specifically Boiled Water and not Purified Water.
---
OMG THERE IS THEY ALREADY TOOK OUR DOG
---
You need a Nuclear Keycard and NukaCrypt.com
---
Sure, it takes the hunt out of the game for a nuke to launch, but its fun launching nukes whenever you want and wherever you want.
---
I start at the clubhouse, make sure there isn't anyone too close by, or hasnt been there too recently or you might not get  mobs to spawn for you. Just drop right in by the bus. Check behind the clubhouse, 3 ghouls spawn behind the building that get missed a lot. From there i head past the tennis court to the gazebo with the statue on top and get a drink of the phosphorus water to get rid of diseases. Then i head up left towards the guest houses, go down that line of guest houses until the second big one with a mob, then cut down to the parking lot kitty cornered on the resort, go through the service buildings and go back towards the guest houses where i came from and follow that road right out to the whitespring train station to check the vendor and sell some of the crap i just picked up. 
---
Well I know I *can* launch it. I just don‚Äôt really want to get involved in all the high level chaos that would occur lol. I‚Äôd just get in the way
---
Theres a few ways to skip the badass super hero landing.  Why should we be concerned? 
---
Yeah man I appreciate the info. I was just trying to be helpful and give them away to players who could use them.
---
See i kinda have the problem with enjoying this game. I can barely find a gun. Some quests start in a low level area and ill follow the marker then BOOM i see a group of level 52 mole people. I like life simulators. But the minute it became loot come back to your base and improve just a tiny bit. It got to me 
---
Not really. I have mine within eyesight if my brothers but the orange circles do not even come close to touching and yet we can't both spawn ours.
---
Dude this is awesome! üòÇ
---
Loved how the narrator was trying their best to be emotionless because of narrating!
---
It sounded awesome and comical at the same time, and that‚Äôs why I loved it even more!
---
Nice one üëçüòÜ
---
Carrot soup is much heavier than the other soups.
---
Golf course building, golf course, Whitesprings service area carpark, maintenance building, Across to Blackwater mine (especially if Uranium Fever is running), flog off your excess weapons and junk at Whitesprings Station, repeat.
---
People who take advantage of lower level players, &amp;/or a ‚Äúlone wanderer‚Äù when in groups of two or more, just simply shouldn‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs poor sportsmanship and just telling of what lousy people they are in real life. Play another game instead of doing that to people.
---
What in-game rules are this person supposedly breaking?
---
What in the hell are you talking about? Someone can stand 15 feet away and instantly appear on top of you and simultaneously strike you with their weapon.
---
That's called sprinting.
---
**That isn‚Äôt sprinting you jackass. Sprinting involves you moving along a designated path from point A to point B, where you can be shot at any point in time along that path and killed, or staggered, as you mentioned. Vats doesn‚Äôt so that. You literally disappear from point A and reappear at point B. You cannot be shot while this process occurs. And it removes a large amount of the risk associated with melee combat, which is closing space.**
---
And how would you stagger someone who is invisible and you don‚Äôt see?
---
Any staggering perk. A tesla rifle doesn't even require you to hit the target, just the ground near them. There's plenty of options.
---
**And how have you seen this person is there? Using a stealth boy means this player can be hiding anywhere at any time. This isn‚Äôt some flat , confined box you‚Äôre fighting in where you know exactly when and where you‚Äôre fighting. This is an open world game where your opponent can be anywhere. And now, with the use of stealth boys, some jackass can sit in the middle of the road in broad daylight and not be spotted.**
---
Why not just remove both of these mechanics that break any remote semblance of balance?
---
Because if you understand the game's mechanics there is quite a bit of balance. It's all about counters and there are counters for the issues you're bring up.
---
**These counters don‚Äôt need to be in place though. That‚Äôs the issue. VATS and stealth boys are cheese. The only way to counter cheese in almost any game is to cheese in return. The game would lose nothing if these were both stripped away and gain a much simpler balance system in place.**
---
Make it so that if you want to crank someone with a sledgehammer
---
Most people don't use 2H in PvP. That's more of a PvE thing. Things are much faster in PvP, so you usually ditch the slower 2H weapons.
---
**I am not some lemming who has never PvP‚Äôd before, so don‚Äôt condescend to me like I have no clue what I‚Äôm talking about. Stacking martial artist with a bloodied + swing speed super sledge is more than fast enough to body nearly anyone in 1 hit. Not that it matters. The same rule applies if you‚Äôre using a deathclaw gauntlet. You still need to be forced to skillfully close space, not teleport in.**
---
Or that if you want to ambush people you have to, you know, actually use stealth (bushes, trees, buildings, etc) to hide yourself?
---
How about a stealth boy? Oh wait...
---
**I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre serious or not.**
---
Where do I join?üòÇ
---
In a party with inspirational 3 have fun.
---
It's pretty easy to use the game's mechanics to break through all damage mitigation and one shot people. You don't even need to use an exploit.
---
You're infatuated with your team when really it sounds like you haven't played against any formidable PvP teams. Find a discord server and find a fight that challenges you rather than murdering PvE players and thinking you're invincible.
---
I'm almost level 140 and I don't have over half the perks you mentioned. What kind of SPECIAL layout do you use?
---
Thankyou so much! We're currently processing a batch of initiates and will be opening up again soon!
---
I'm with you on that. I didn't go for a build. I just picked perk cards that I really enjoyed. And I'm still doing it.
---
Sorry, but following your reasoning  the second any armor that was effective against energy showed up they would have dropped energy weapons. Armor like say, a leather jacket.
---
Thanks! I got the hang of the camera etc by that point! Can only get better at it!
---
I wouldn't say its totally unrelated lol
---
Our voice actor did great! Glad you enjoyed!
---
Blunderbuss, doesn't count for shotgun perks. Just picked it up and the numbers don't change.
---
It‚Äôs a good idea, but again what they said means nothing. That was them basically saying we sent it upstairs and nothing more. 
---
**Stacking martial artist with a bloodied + swing speed super sledge is more than fast enough to body nearly anyone in 1 hit. Not that it matters. The same rule applies if you‚Äôre using a deathclaw gauntlet. You still need to be forced to skillfully close space, not teleport in.**
---
I go with 10 int so I can use lvl 5 gunsmith and the similar melee on that reduces condition loss. This covers my weapons and then I can switch out other int perks as needed when crafting/reparing.
---
I'm a farmer/gatherer type. I collect and bulk a bunch of junk and give it to whoever needs it most if I don't need it. Though I'm technically also an explosives build who is obsessed with Nuka Grenades and my Daisycutter.
---
Will do!
---
6 i thought the max was 5? did u delete one?
---
Will DM when we open up recruitment again!
---
It would absolutely be awesome.  But would it cause a ton of glitches and instability is my question.
---
Is stealing from people allowed now is it? 
---
We are on PS4. My psn is on my last post about the APD! 
---
Well I guess theres at least 3 ways judging by the comments. I was referring to swapping weapons right as you land. Totally cancels the lag
---
As long as you contribute is the big thing. What I can‚Äôt stand is low level players joining the event (which makes the queen harder to kill for each players who‚Äôs there regardless if they leave or stay) and essentially mooch off other players work. That and the queen has been more and more difficult lately, even for a lvl 150 as myself there is only so much I can do unless other players join in. 
---
As long as you do your part (melee when she lands and land shots while hovering) you are doing more then 50% of other players who have the tools to help and don‚Äôt. 
---
No matter what, everything gets blamed on third shift. Sigh. 
---
Go to the Mire at Lv. 38.
---
It'll be fun.
---
No, really.  Some of the best moments in the game are trying to survive in hostile, unexplored locations where you're somewhat out of your league.
---
Good post, its what would get rid of some of the scum ripping people off
---
I don't think they said all aid items will drop, just that *some* will. I could be wrong.
---
You just summed up pretty much all the hardcore players... 
---
Three places in NV bas game though different versions. One place in Big MT. two places in the divide.  
---
And when not maintained properly yeah they would fail. But the ones in fallout 2 could be repaired to full working order if you where smart enough and as mentioned bellow by some one it was broken because it was full of dust.  
---
  
---
There are 4 in appalachia two in bunkers, one in harpiers ferry, and the one for the inoculation.   
---
They are a pain to maintain but not impossible. The thing about them is they need work after a few operations. Something that isn't that hard to do and a minor "repair cost" after they are used lets say 5 times wouldn't be that big of a problem.   
---
I really don't get all the Juicehead hate. He takes whatever news and interesting Reddit-threads that's popped up since last time and recaps them in a straightforward manner, and without too much unneccesary fluff. He also states clearly when he's speculating on a rumor.
---
He's my go-to Youtuber for when I want the news on Fallout, but can't be assed to Google it myself.
---
Hm, better go wreck some camps before the patch then. 
---
The fact that this isn't pervasive is surprising. People have exploited every other vulnerability to hell, I'm surprised more haven't exploited this. I guess i've just been lucky
---
 The Mire is lovely. It just has a bad reputation is all. I've lived there for months now. ;)
---
If anything, an improvement.  The threshold for the landing is kind of ridiculous.
---
I think both it and the Cranberry Bog are my favorite biomes.  I've never built a CAMP in the Mire, because the fast travel incentives aren't there, but I think CAMPs in the Mire are the best looking CAMPs because of the lighting.
---
Will DM when we are next recruiting!
---
If you pull and hold the trigger, its automatic. If not is semi-automatic and doesnt get automatic perks
---
Expert Heavy Gunner it is!
---
LOL. How do you scam somebody in this game?
---
Can you make the graphics and performance better please? :)
---
Yes that and Kenn we always try to blame everything on Kenn.
---
Thanks, and although you said you didn't want to contradict me I would welcome it if you did, anyway! You know something I don't please DO correct me. Nothing gets learned otherwise. :)
---
I be like: This is my canibalistic mothman cultist build, this is my bomberman build, this is my pistol wielding vampire build(based on Alucard), this is my non VATS sniper build(that I make for every Fallout game), this is my BFG PA build that is useless till they fix energy weapons.
---
Great doing business with you. See you again when I need some more. And I'll recommend you to friends. 
---
This is my shotgun sniper melee build
---
Fyi Caps Collector 3 works 100% of the time if you look at the cap stash, walk like 30ft away and then walk back and look the search option appears. I collect 63ish stashes almost daily.
---
I just got the recipe for quantum nuka grenade
---
WHY DOES IT DO NO RAD DMG WHEN QUANTUM HAS A RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPE THAT MAKES IT GLOW
---
&gt;What in the hell are you talking about? Someone can stand 15 feet away and instantly appear on top of you and simultaneously strike you with their weapon.
---
No. No, they can't. The engagement distance is pretty far. Seriously just equip any melee weapon and VATS something from a distance. Approach it until it hops from 0% to 95%. That's your engagement distance and it's much shorter than 15 feet. 
---
&gt;Sprinting involves you moving along a designated path from point A to point B, where you can be shot at any point in time along that path and killed, or staggered, as you mentioned.
---
One of my characters is a melee build and I'm def vulnerable the whole approach. The counter is to stagger them. They probably just have cavalier armor and take less damage while sprinting. You should also use VATS so if they appear behind you you pivot while firing at them.
---
&gt;And how have you seen this person is there? Using a stealth boy means this player can be hiding anywhere at any time.
---
Any player that is standing with a stealth boy has a red arrow over them. You can also use your compass. Pumping your perception up with aid items also helps with this. There's also berry mentats, the cryolater, any weapon that sets them on fire, anything that poisons them. 
---
&gt;These counters don‚Äôt need to be in place though. That‚Äôs the issue.
---
PvP is all about having the right response to everything. Every build has a vulnerability. It's a pretty nifty approach and much different than traditional FPS. It's also what makes fallout's approach unique and harkens back to the days where builds **had to** be specialized. It's much different than fallout 4's jack of all trades system. 
---
&gt;Stacking martial artist with a bloodied + swing speed super sledge is more than fast enough to body nearly anyone in 1 hit. Not that it matters. The same rule applies if you‚Äôre using a deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
There's a reason 1H and unarmed dominates melee PvP. It's because the only 2H weapon that doesn't have a slow attack speed are the buzz saw blade and the spear. Sure, you'll one hit with it, but so will a powerfist, meathook, DCG, machete, etc when specced right. Players don't have much health and even non-bloodied 1H/unarmed builds do enough damage to one shot players. When I fight someone with 2H melee, it's probably a safe assumption they're PvE players. PvP players want something with a faster attack speed. 
---
&gt;I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre serious or not.
---
I can't tell if you actually PvP much and know how to effectively do it. These tactics are insurmountable only if you don't know how to counter them. If you try to PvP with a PvE build, you're going to get outclassed even if your build is a natural counter to theirs. Build choices have consequences.
---
Lode Bearing gives tokens also
---
Yeah, unlike terraria *cough* throwing *cough*
---
This one collects unique outfits, that one collects Nuka Cola, next is the one collects pre-war food - oh, did I show you the one that collects teddy bears?
---
It sounds like we're both talking past each other.  Not intentionally trying to do that...  But, the example I gave directly has to do with potential future changes.  There should be (and hopefully will be as Bethesda has hinted at) significant changes with the Adventure and Survival modes.  It is my hope that they completely turn off PVP in Adventure mode.  In order to do that, it will significantly change how the game will be played with workshops.  We'll just have to wait and see.  As the game is now, many people avoid taking over workshops due to the vast difference in levels between players.  It's currently not very conducive to creating communities within the game. 
---
Interestingly enough, on the other side of the coin, what some players are doing instead of PVP is high stake boxing matches.  We each put up an item in our inventory for the stakes and box it out, no mutations, no armor.  Lots of blood and laughs.  ;)  But it's completely voluntary and we usually fight people who are close in levels.
---
Thanks. I had trouble with your method but I was able to fix it temporarily by relogging in.. and it kept glitching out again whenever I died. I also noticed the effect screen didn‚Äôt show the positive effects of either mutation like it‚Äôs supposed to, just the negatives. 
---
It might be a number of mutations with this problem too, as I got healing factor when I logged back in but it didn‚Äôt do squat for my regen, and the positive effects weren‚Äôt listed like with AR.
---
So you are one of those people
---
The automatic barrels deal damage relative to the semi-auto counterparts. Unless they're explicitly changing the automatic barrels as well, any change to the base semi-automatic weapon should propagate to the automatic variant.
---
&gt;The plan is for this to also carry over to your C.A.M.P. as well.
---
Hold on, there...  This plan will defeat our ability to counter griefers who use their camps to ruin the game experience for other players.
---
For example, people are placing their camps near high-traffic areas, filled with multiple sirens going off at the same time. This isn't just annoying; it makes it impossible to hear any other sounds or voice chat. They also surround the sirens with indestructable foundations stacked on top of each other, using [***this glitch***](https://youtu.be/zpOEVeIuXcE?t=5). If you make camp items indestructible, they won't even need to do that anymore.  
---
Also, of course, we have the players who build "turret farming" bases in these high-traffic areas, often leaving the area and allowing their turrets to kill any nearby enemies before anyone else has a chance to touch them.  
---
Please reconsider this plan. We need a way to shut these players down without having to resort to filing a support ticket.
---
Awesome! Excited for the Salvaged Assaultron Head fix!
---
Can we get the railway rifle not benefiting from perks added to the list too? :)
---
It's sad when the standard Nuka Grenade does a lot more plus Rad damage on top of it. I never bother with Nuka Quantum Grenades as a result. 
---
What you need is someone following you around that doesn't interact (Cameraman), and then on another server three guys watching the stream and giving updates and commentary.
---
Have different units from various platforms/servers patrolling the cities. "It looks like our team in Watoga has been called to a domestic over at the shopping diatrict.  Let's go there live..."
---
If survival was separated and you had to create a survival character to play in it; it would open up the ability for specific balancing . Also survival exclusive rewards, outfits, weapons etc. I'm not sure the reasoning around allowing crossover outweighs the fun and reward potential of keeping them exclusive.  
---
It's not all the way clear, just yet, on the specifics.  I guess we have to reserve judgment for now. 
---
Everyone is pretty much creating their own story.
---
Oh my god, this pesto is amazing with aged cheddar.
---
they have dongs and ham sandwiches they're just sterile.
---
I can see how that would get annoying and I had the same feeling when I first started. Going ANYWHERE but the vicinity of Vault 76 at first is going to quickly wear you down because of how insanely underpowered you are in the beginning, especially with oddly-overpowered enemies in otherise low-level enemies. I treated my experience like a scouting expedition, learning enemy spawns and item locations - really taking in the environment. It's a rinse and repeat, each time you'll get a little more confident and daring, exploring further out. I found fun in that, but I can see how others might not enjoy that.
---
We‚Äôve honestly been wanting to do this. It would be very fun. 
---
As your sister, I think you should get an alarm.
---
Sounds legit. 
---
Ooo, that would explain why I've never seen them until now.
---
Pacifist settings have absolutely nothing to do with someone's ability to slap damage you and destroy your base.  Pacifist mode ensures that *you* do not accidentally damage someone else or their base during PvE content.  
---
You're complaining about PvP, and acknowledging the workarounds for PvP but not wanting to actually use them.  This is *you*r problem, and not anyone else's.  Sure, they're a bit of a dick for doing this to you but at the same rate, this game is designed around this.  
---
Next time stop being such a baby and either fight back, or just leave the server and join another.  It's not exactly a hard concept.
---
Get regular Sugar Bombs and over time it becomes irradiated.
---
I'd just like to point out, you can't leave the server that easily any more, I'd say like 1 in 4 times you just rejoin the server you where on and during the day (east coast) I've rejoined the same server 4 or 5 times in a row trying to server hop.
---
Could do that and sacrifice a more efficient weapon. I prefer to use armor that has weapon weight reduction.
---
What people? I'm really unclear what rules you're saying these people are breaking that should result in some sort of ban.
---
I sure how the Gatling Gun's ROF doesn't change, it's slow enough currently.
---
Yeah, It was the second gun I found in the game haha. 
---
If youre splitting between 2 different classes you absolutely want 3 bloody mess and i would only take the 1st level of each weapon class card (ie 1 rifleman, 1 master rifleman, 1 expert rifleman).  The first level is worth double the latter 2 on each card.
---
i thought this was gonna be a meme
---
And soon we‚Äôll all have the nuka shine blues.
---
Lol same
---
In need of a water boy? I have high quality H20
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what people have been telling me. I‚Äôm still learning the game. I was just trying to help someone out if they needed the other parts.
---
There is a new roadmap put out by Bethesda that details their future plans. As for what‚Äôs changed I‚Äôm not sure just started playing a few weeks ago myself on Xbox and there are usually a fair amount of other people on the servers. 
---
They all died because they didn't work together. 
---
What's your build? 
---
It doesn't take me out, of course, it's just annoying.  I use the cars as field expedient claymores when I get a group of ghouls together.  MIRV grenades are especially effective that way.
---
How exactly is the guy scamming/stealing from people. You're not being very clear on what happened. I'm asking because if there is someone doing something they shouldn't, I'd like to be aware of it so I can avoid it happening to me. 
---
I am high a high agility and luck build mostly use pistols in VATS and I use shotguns with enforcer since it‚Äôs op for crippling big enemies and helps with crowd control. 
---
I would love this to happen.  I think the mask would look awesome with a combat helmet. 
---
If you don't believe ripping multiple people off &amp; stealing items &amp; then reselling is an issue, then you'll never understand. PvP is part of the game, being dishonest isnt

I use them for taking out groups of ghouls.  I tag 1 or 2, kneecapping them when I can to control the encounter, and then run them around to a vehicle, and then walk backwards as then approach and blow when I get to minimal safe distance.  Its fun!
---
You have a ported barrel?
---
I sit on a lead node and hunt for acid, it really isn't that bad, or hasn't been until i ran out of my overstock of .308 ammo. Now I am collecting tons of steel so I can make another 5 to 10k of .308 ammo.

 No. I wondered what it did.

You could see my post history, but couldn‚Äôt see the obvious joke?
---
It was horrible on launch with serious performance issues. I played for 4 hours left it for a months played another hour and haven't touched it since.
---
What you are wanting is a mode where nobody can damage each-other's character or property. This doesn't exist yet, although to please people who want no PVP at all Bethesda may implement it if sufficient interest is shown by enough people. In the mean time I recommend immediately server-hopping if someone starts to damage your base. Yes, it IS annoying to get run off of a server, but if you do it quickly enough you actually win the exchange with the asshole player. Why? They usually can't damage your base sufficiently before you log off to really cost you if you are quick about it, and then there they are, with a bounty, and all you need to do is repair a couple items. Someone else high-level is going to go for them, wreck their shit, and take their caps and junk. I bounty hunt griefing idiots all the time. In fact, if I see one with a particularly high bounty I will watch where they go on the map, figure out where their base is, and travel to it. Then drop a few MIRV's on it or Nuke grenades through the windows. :) I go for the generators first. Best way to screw someone over, imo. There is no penalty for destroying the property of a wanted player, did you know that? Then I hide near their base with Chameleon and a crit charged up. They usually rush back to defend their base when they get the message it is under attack, or miss the message and just return there to drop off loot. Only to find their CAMP leveled to the ground, and a crit headshot dropping them. I take their loot, taunt them for being naughty, then server hop myself so they cannot find MY base to take revenge. Don't worry, man. Hop servers, block idiots, and rest assured there is always a bigger player making the life of your griefer miserable. And soon you will have the levels and gear to deal with the clowns, or you will get a new game mode. 
---
What if they use a chainsaw instead of unarmed?
---
I know the feeling but I‚Äôm starting to get even. Two high level players came to me at Poseidon one time and killed me and took my camp. When I respawned, those morons were still there. I took a high sniper position and started sniping at their heads. They left with the quickness. Of course I had to repay caps again to get the workshop back. That part sucked. Another time this wanted broad came into my CAMP and killed me. I respawned. Looked her up on the map and saw that she was at Sutton station. Took up a sniper position again. I figured she was in there trading. For about 7 minutes she‚Äôs still in there. Then it dawned on me. I think the was waiting to ambush players. So I crept to the door and tossed a couple plasma grenades in there. Vaporized her stupid butt. Grabbed all her loot and jetted back to camp and logged off. That was a good day. I got a fat man now. Anyone higher than me that kills me for no damn reason got another thing coming. 
---
If your going lever the rifleman perks are best at max. Tank killer is really good. 
---
Long shot and sniper are ok. But the lever is more mid range imo. 
---
Suppressor and tenderizer are ok from the charisma pool. And tormentor from luck is amazing. 
---
Bloody mess is great. 
---
Quick hands is very nice on levers. Unless you have Double or quad as a legendary. 
---
Bandolier in strength is nice as .45 is weightless. 
---
I've noticed a sharp increase in this about 1-2 weeks ago. All of a sudden it seems the cool thing is to follow people around the map that are minding their own business and attack them by slapping them and/or destroying their camp. I just ignored one dude and didn't care about my camp as it's not that hard to just repair everything at once. 
---
He ended up stopping after I went to white springs and started farming ghouls and other mobs... I would get one-two hits in before he killed them so all he was doing at that point was giving me easy EXP. He must of noticed what he was doing after the first dozen because he quickly 'ported out.
---
In the last week I've been one shot, attacked, camp destroyed etc... it's been worse this past 1-2 weeks than it had been all of the months before. 
---
is that ur GT or the guy's? we have a few guys in our school who are 250+ and play on xbox.

It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.

Where is the first image located, that‚Äôs pretty cool.  
---
It just looks good 
---
Can u please dissect this for us low level players cos I didn‚Äôt understand half of what you said. 
---
You absolutely can melee someone from 15 ft away with Vats. Lmao. You‚Äôre just being disingenuous now. 
---
Again, the attack speed difference between 2handed with martial artist and 40% swing speed is a fraction of a moment. I‚Äôm not arguing that unarmed dominates, but that‚Äôs because it also gets a 25% boost (for whatever reason) from twisted muscles as well as talons. So you can essentially get the same damage boost without investing the perk cards. But 2h weapons are definitely viable. 
---
You also are under the assumption that all of these mechanics (such as appearing on the compass, red arrow, etc) will apply to PvP servers. Why? Why would you not think Bethesda would do away with freebie information like that in a PvP centric game mode?
---
We can still have highly specialized builds without players teleporting around or having to use an auto-aim assist to deal with players like this. 
---
The game would be FAR more simplistic, easier to balance, and would lose **none** of the RPG elements by removing vats, stealth boys, and legendaries. 
---
All you‚Äôd need to do is pick up the weapons/armor you like, spec into it, and execute your gameplan. 
---
You don‚Äôt think the major reason people are slow to PvP in this game is due to the janky, over complicated, unnecessary mechanics that adding things like Vats and invisibility and the near limitless amount of legendary rolls?
---
It‚Äôs not that these counters don‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre shitty mechanics that an extremely small amount of people like. The support for this thread shows that.

I would drop shotguns. I know, they're cool and I love them myself, but it's time to ween yourself off of them. It's all fine and good if you have a TSE, but if you did have one you would have mentioned it. More likely, you wouldn't be asking for build advice.
---
You don't want 2 secondaries. There just isn't enough points to go around to make all 3 effective. Melee is very handy as it's pretty low maintenance and you don't have to carry extra ammo. They are pretty cheap to repair too. Rifles = ranged, melee when Appalachian thugs are in your face. Or you run out of ammo. Or you just want to be in their face. 
---
This build will center around medium to low health, though you can use it for high health if you like. Armor choice, mutations, and legendary weapon effects will dictate a lot of it, but it's flexible. No VATS or PA (though I suggest keeping a couple of suits on hand--the Excavator for excavating ore and X-01 for nuke zones. Hazmat suits just suck. About all they are good for is picking flora/scavenging.
---
Here's a [LINK](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4645e8&amp;d=s92sf2ss2sg2se2pd0pk0pl0pe0ej2e10e60eu0c72i41ir2am2aj2ar2ao0a12a00lt2l71lu2&amp;w=eh1ee0ls2a72ic2ip1sq2s32sr2s21s00c52cr0&amp;n=) to the build.
---
It's for unarmed with an alternate heavy weapons/PA primary in anticipation of the heavy weapon buff, but just swap out the heavy weapon stuff for 2 handed if you want to go that route. I'll talk about some options as we go. I'm just too lazy to talk about every single perk.
---
**STR - 15**
---
We're going to go unarmed, but you don't have to. I just like unarmed. Unarmed weapons last longer and tend to do more damage. Two handed is much ~~easier~~ more efficient and it makes sense if you have to break out the PA because some dingleberry didn't leave Drop Site V9 out of the nuke zone (or any other fast travel location down by fissure site prime.
---
**Barbarian** makes sense if you're going to have strength this high and not rely on PA.
---
**Incisor** is a must for any melee weapons user, even if you don't use 1/2 handed melee perks.
---
**Blocker** is a no brainer.
---
**PER - 4**
---
WTF? No Tank Killer? I must be a noob. But this is also a stealth build. We'll get to that. If you do this right, you won't need TK. You can make a strong argument to get it depending on how much you love and use rifles. Frankly, I would put more points into Glow Sight. Once you get above lvl 50, most enemies in the wild except super mutants are glowing. Ok, maybe not scorched, but they will ALL die to a headshot. They are beneath us, one step up from radroaches. There's another plan in place for any other scorched enemy. Read on.
---
**END - 6**
---
**Ironclad** is good, but not that good. 3 points. The math will work, hang on.
---
I love **Dromedary** and **Good Doggy**. In this worldspace, Ol' Roy and Mighty Dog wesen't invented. Nothing but Purina for us. I know you can easily have water for days, but I'd rather sell it. I'm all about the benjamin$ bro. How else are you going to afford mutations?
---
Time for shit to get real? Eat/drink up and exchange them for **Lifegiver** and drop **Ironclad** for **Fireproof**. This is meant for PA use as well. You can add another point into either if you wish, but I don't recommend it. The math doesn't work if you're not in PA. If you have enough perk points to spare, you can carry 3 card sets (high levels can do this).
---
**Radicool** is obviously helpful, as we use Rads to manage our low health so we don't overstim ourselves. Rad-Away Diluted does have a use after all!
---
**CHR - 4**
---
I don't like people. **Lone Wanderer**.
---
**INT - 5**
---
Seriously? Yes, seriously. When you're able to repair weapons to 200% they last twice as long. When you kill everything with one shot, they last a long time. I think you'll find melee very pleasing once all is said and done, but you could make some minor adjustments here. But you need a minimum of 5. You'll thank me later when you're level 100+.
---
**Makeshift Warrior** is good if you use melee most of the time like this build does, but you could easily swap it for rank 2 **Gunsmith**.
---
**Nerd Rage** looks good on paper, but 20% health is pretty damn low, so I'm not sure how much utility you'd get out of it. I would be comfortable going with rank 5 **Gunsmith** here. You're either going to die, or not die, to whatever you're fighting, so I don't think it helps too much. You could argue this for quite some time, but not today.
---
**AGI - 14**
---
Ahhh, now here we are. Listen closely as this skill tree is critical. Stealth. Get all of the perks. You can literally walk up to any enemy, undetected, and slaughter them. Or crouch really far away and kill them dead. Unless you don't run silenced weapons. Not your thing? Ok. How about the 3x stealth damage multiplier (that's 300%)? No other perk in the game can provide this amount of increase in damage: this is the non-VATS user's critical. Do I have your attention now? I thought so. This is why you don't need **Tank Killer**.
---
**Evasive** is a nice perk for all DR. Non PA users should always have this perk. Swap **Evasive** for **Action Boy/Girl** when you step into PA.
---
**Sneak** is really good. You won't realize it unless you're at rank 3 along with **Escape Artist**. You can beat up on the SBQ while in stealth. It works. It does not work on molerats. Them sumbitches can detect you from one side of the map to the other.
---
**Ninja** for melee or **Covert Operative** for rifles . Money shots all day long.
---
**Dodgy** is a great perk. I find it very useful, more so then **Nerd Rage**. You won't run out of AP unless you just stand there getting your ass beat on like a dummy. And you're not a dummy.
---
**Adrenaline** is very useful. One point is enough. With the damage we'll be doing, you won't need more.
---
**LUCK - 8**
---
Mandatory. **Bloody Mess**, **Starched Genes**, and **Classroom Freak**. Max 'em.
---
**Mutations**
---
**Marsupial** \- No brainer
---
**Twisted Muscles** \- For all melee
---
**Talons** \- Unarmed melee. +25% more damage! I told you unarmed was worthwhile. This stacks with Twisted Muscles.
---
**Speed Demon** \- Freaking amazing for reload speed and sneak speed. Don't worry about the reduced food/drink consumption as it's barley noticeable. You got **Dromedary** and **Good Doggy**, right? RIGHT? I'm not so dumb after all...
---
**Scaly Skin** \- It's good. AP's not an issue. Save this for later.
---
**Grounded** \- Nope. Unless you hate energy weapons. The Gauss Rifle is an energy weapon.
---
**Healing Factor** \- Nope. I'm addicted to Psycobuff and too proud to show my face at the local methadone clinic. The 12 step program is not for me. A simple stim pack works very well. Or a can of dog food.
---
**Adrenal Reaction** \- This mutation is an absolute must have. Just imagine what it will do for a Gauss rifle. The entire build revolves (and my grandiose statements about damage) around this mutation. You won't miss the HP loss if you followed my advice.
---
I don't recommend any other perk for this build.
---
**Weapons**
---
Instigating and Bloodied are what to look for, but even Furious is solid.
---
Oh, and as I mentioned earlier, if you need a little extra punch for scorchbeasts invest in a Prime receiver for your guns of choice. You'll get them easily from the SBQ. Once you have a crap ton of flux like I do, crafting ammo for your guns is easy.
---
**Armor**
---
This is where you need to make a decision, as I can't do it for you. It's your game.
---
Unyielding is the best choice for melee as it buffs STR to ridiculous levels. However, it also buffs your carry weight, improves stealth, barter values, and will help you get that preserved pie you've been longing for. I have more carry weight allowance at low health than I do in my set of Excavator PA with 2 calibrated legs I shit you not.
---
Bolstering would be ideal if you're not playing a stealth unit, but imo, the value vs. Unyielding is not there. But like I said, it's your game, play it how you wanna.
---
Vanguard is for high health only. Meh. No fun in that if you ask me.
---
Does he sell legendary armor?
---
Oh I see what u mean. U mean their first character got all the SPECIAL rifle perks. But now they‚Äôre building up suing all the melee perks...I think , right? 
---
Well, lets put this another way... if people are justified for using, as you say, a part of the game mechanic to setup turrets, which do NOT grant the owner XP or loot, to fire into the windows of the golf club, then I am justified to use another part of the game mechanic to call down the wrath of God in the form of an orbital strike to eliminate the poaching turrets.  No other justification or explanation needed, I'm just using the existing rules and functionality. It just so happens that I also have a low level alt suicide bomber for that purpose. Kara is a bitch. üòÇüëç

it depends i guess, dota 2 has had animation cancelling established in the pro scene since wc3

I made a massive 3 story resort house on that island too. It was my favorite place to build. Besides the drive in.

No
---
This is exactly my point! Whiny posts about the challenges of survival in a game where survival is supposed to be a challenge.. I would rather man up, study game mechanics, and work to improve my PVP odds. I‚Äôm having a ton of fun and still finding new ways to enjoy the game. 
---
Just play the game to the full for your level and you‚Äôll find you‚Äôll consistently level quite quickly. Explore, do events, learn everything, scrap, build, search for plans, craft, cook, build better stuff, modify things, kill stuff.. there‚Äôs literally XP everywhere.
---
That was the point of the game.  It was an open world for co op and pvp interactions.  Wtf.

I'm about to go on of that works for you. PSN: BaronGrivet

Take your perks off and reapply them. Also double check your not sick.

I found metal picnic table plans at Grahm today. He also had two different plans called "Locker."
---
are u getting xp? this sounds really wierd
---
Thank you I appreciate that and thank you for you business.
---
I am getting XP, but I've fought at least 4 Queens today on different servers. And it's a constant loading screen when I hover a body or meat pile. It sucks. 
---
ProTip: If you glitch invisible, there‚Äôs a pretty good chance of getting a single item to appear visible with a little crouching and equip / unequip. If you ever see an empty red cocktail dress running around beating up SuperMutants, give me a wave ;-)
---
Stick around. It cann take a while. 
---
They only heavily implied it at their E3 announcement of the game, so heck yeah they should!
---
Not always, no.  But I just left a server where after I dropped a gift on the ground for a lowbie, this jerk ran up and nicked it.  Ehh, no big.   Then the dickhead started laying into me with their TSE shotgun, then switched out to a blade, and continued to follow me around for several minutes attacking me.  They followed me around the clubhouse, hacking at me, and I just kept on wandering around, looting.  This is the mindset and personality I'm talking about.
---
What I would LOVE for the devs to implement to for assholes the one described above to spontaneously catch fire and explode.  If you hit someone who doesn't want to play with you repeatedly, you catch fire, and then you explode, dropping a random weapon from your inventory that other players can loot.
---
Depending on server stability, there are times where the is a long wait for the loot boxes to load. I've lost queen loot many times because the loot boxes took longer to load and the queen's body despawned. Clearing meat piles of their contents to cause them to despawn can help with the overall loading speed. It's also an issue for me, sometimes, when the whitespring gets nuked
---
So slap damage is what happens until you engage with the aggressor. If someone hits you with an Axe and you don't hit them back they won't cause much damage to you. If you hit them back then it's on. Both of you will do your full damage to each other. 
---
I would like it if after one or two hits and the other player does not engage, if the aggressor keeps hit a player that is not interested in PVP it would cause severe or fatal damage to the player that is now griefing. Instead of players having to leave the server to get away from the douche bags that insist on griefing other players Bethesda could fix them by after 2 slaps they start killing themselves with every smack.
---
Ya I just waited about 20 minutes and everyone left the area and still nothing üòî I'll attempt to keep waiting. Everytime there is about 20, of us fighting. 
---
I did that with my TSE Lever Action, luckily I caught it and bought it back. I totally agree with this! 
---
Btw if you‚Äôre on Xbox I have an extra All Rise. I started a second character which is now my main so I don‚Äôt need it. 
---
It's their piss poor servers I've had this happen easiest but sometimes hardest thing to do is be right up next to the queen when she dies and just spam grab and by transfer I mean whatever buttons it key not shur which platform you are on 
---
I‚Äôve had this happen on Xbox. What I‚Äôve done is try my best to remember the first I killed that horde. It seems that the game has a hard time generating loot for all of the bodies they you can claim. So the loot on the first body is still being randomized and the others can‚Äôt go next if the first hasn‚Äôt. 
---
I could be wrong but that‚Äôs what could be. And thats what I do to fix. It. 
---
I do it for fun, but with a purpose.  I use the cars more or less as claymores for when I get a passel of ghouls after me.  It's fun, absolutely.
---
I am theologin on xbox, I did not notice the other guys name. really wish i had but was late and did not expect him to server hop because I was taking a picture with him.
---
Skyrim did this slightly better where the weapon was shown horizontally in the inventory if it was one handed and diagonal if it was two handed. Wish they‚Äôd kept that for FO4 and 76!
---
It's a beta glitch, I don't have several trophies that should've unlocked in the beta.
---
On PC, but thank you!
---
 Do events if they are low enough level, and the higher level the thing you kill, the more XP you get.
---
Okay. Got it now. Yeah. That would be great. 
---
üò≠ gonna have to start a new character and find a way to transfer it
---
Ok that makes sense I was wondering how this is even possible.
---
I think you could try here!

Good luck and happy birthday to your dad!

Ditto decontamination showers, but that doesn't mean I don't have one in my camp :)
---
Hey there‚Äôs a bunch of sites that do that.
---
Just type ‚Äúdrawn portrait from pictures‚Äù into google and shop away.
---
Makes sense, ya I lost my queen loot multiple times. Plus the drop in framerate with so many people around doesn't help. 
---
thanks for the replies, that's a relief. I have a bunch of perk cards I dont even think I wanted and never use, sometimes the game would crash on level up or the screen would flicker and I'd accidentally click A and wind up with a card I didn't want.
---
I don't want to agree with u/drunkrngeebee but he/she is right, they're not breaking any in game rules.  And for other people wondering what's going on: people are scamming people by asking others to trade their items first or they're saying they have some legendary weapon and with the current system you can't see all of the effects on it.  it was just a post about somebody that's actually in the fallout 76 market subreddit and has like -15 karma but people keep trading with him and he just keeps ripping people off.
---
I had over a dozen suits displayed on a couple runs of fo4. I only used them for dealing with areas that I had heavy rads like the atom morons etc. 
---
Ya bro that's when i just leave that server tbh had someone decide to do that and took all my junk i was saving pissed me off so bad 
---
u can
---
Damn it's real 
---
I now get 4 clips out of my laser scatter gun. *great*.
---
inb4 whitespring
---
And all the spawned mobs, living and dead. Back before adrenal broke, would queen run a ton and would regularly lose about 1 in 3 queen loot drops
---
are you saying I should mod them and can make them even lighter? If so thats a great idea if it works. Sorry I didint see this btw. Reddit never shows me when I have messages anymore. 
---
Good call.  I'll have to take a closer look at this.  My build for this toon is basically stealth shotgun kneecapping machine.  Nothing to brag about, but I usually solo, and it makes groups more manageable.
---
My life for two years was 2nd shift making their problems my problem.
---
Fuck people who can't do their basic job requirements.
---
Got the level 100 achievement, still "havent left the vault".
---
Like another said, its from the beta. Right after the game came out, it was like 20% left the vault, 85% reached level 5, or some other super early achievement.
---
Thank you. I understand the issue at hand now.
---
Can I also hop on the DM train?
---
See that would be so frustrating for me. I'm still a low level, but going an fighting when someone sets one off is seeing to help me level quickly. As well as give me beneficial loot. But it's not beneficial if it doesn't show up lol
---
I can never get over how it would work out though.
---
Like will your friends need to save a spot in the server you enter or vice versa and locking others out of your server? 
---
Or will it keep you and your friends on one server and not allow you to join any other server because that would break whatever chains have been made with the camps placement?
---
OR will you not be able to move your camp because it's part of the town and if you move the camp would that break somethings?
---
And making it interesting if you could join different servers, would you see the town or would you appear in just a normal camp.
---
~~~~
---
Unless you mean removing or reducing the space needed to place a camp near each other which would be really cool.
---
Got ya!
---
We blame Mike
---
Ps4, can confirm.
---
It's like-- What Riomaki said.  No ambiguity, you follow the recipe to the last letter or you starve.
---
I sold the shielded vaulted jumpsuit right off my body. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to sell something you have equipped!
---
In my case it was a direct trade &amp; I was dumb enough to do it at zero caps, he took the be pump shotgun, I got nothing &amp; later he replied lol. 
---
It might not be an in game rule, but I know multiple people have been ripped off &amp; reported him, but he's still free to do it &amp; then sell the items the next day. Yes I shouldn't have traded like that with an a'hole, but I have done this multiple times with nil issue.
---
This could be another radiant quest. Players deliver mail from one point to another, be it one town to another or whatever. Players only get their packages after any player does a delivery mission. With one player doing a delivery mission, the entire server gets their mail. The courier obviously gets some caps/stims/whatever. It would encourage people to do these missions. It would let people feel like they're actually making any kind of difference. It adds to the roleplay value. 
---
The "my weapon broke and I don't care to fix it, so I'm just gonna use a new weapon" build.
---
This.  I had all but the suppressor unlocked for the gauss, 15 gauss scraped later and finally unlocked it.
---
I got lucky with the handmade, keep scraping, your intelligence stat also helps you unlock mods the higher it is.
---
Look to upgrade combat shotguns. I have a hardened combat shotgun that does like 140 damage. No legendary effects unfortunately, but it gets the job done when things get up close and personal
---
yeah it's always kinda cool to see a guy so high level. Im 57 but only cause I got carried a bit. 
---
Me and my buddies decided to have one of our bases be a nice actual decorated thoughtfully home and the other he the crafting/less decorated one 
---
If not WS, Uranium Fever, or West Tek
---
Yup. I scrapped my shielded vault jumpsuit once. Since replaced but still would like to be able to lock it from scrap, drop, sell or trade. 
---
That seems cool but also really scummy if no one does the quest for mail. Or rather chooses to not do the quest. 
---
I can assure you, that on pc I am in the same situation, absolutely no griefs, murders or whatever 
---
Not really. At launch everyone is worried about themselves and staying ahead of the power curve. After the initial launch people become far more helpful, because they‚Äôve got stuff that is now ‚Äúuseless‚Äù for high level content but would do wonders for new players. 
---
Players who join later also don‚Äôt have to fight the rush of having 20 people trying to do the same quest. On the PvP servers you can bet your bottom dollar it would be much slower to progress through quests with everyone funneling into popular quest areas. Noobs a year from now don‚Äôt have to fret about that. 
---
Photoshop filters also do a great job
---
"I only played it for 4 hours, but here's my opinion"
---
I sold my handmade but was able to immediately buy it back. On the other hand, I bought an All Rise that was better than mine just the other day. It didn't even occur to me someone could have sold it on accident.
---
I can see if the quest exist but no one is forced to do it.  It if one does do it they get a buff that gives them more for helping mr messenger quest 
---
&gt;You absolutely can melee someone from 15 ft away with Vats. Lmao. You‚Äôre just being disingenuous now.
---
[No, you can't.](https://imgur.com/a/bIGivRg)
---
&gt;Again, the attack speed difference between 2handed with martial artist and 40% swing speed is a fraction of a moment.
---
Assuming you can get 1H or unarmed with 40% SS, there is an attack speed advantage. If both can be specced to one shot, then you take the faster attack speed. So again, 2H is less viable for PvP and it's more of a PvE weapon. Even then, I still prefer 1H/unarmed for PvE because the DPS for both is higher. 
---
&gt;You also are under the assumption that all of these mechanics (such as appearing on the compass, red arrow, etc) will apply to PvP servers. Why?
---
Because they exist for good reason and exist when contesting workshops which are essentially PvP zones. Removing this removes an advantage that high perception builds have. It's kind've an indirect nerf to rifle builds.
---
&gt;We can still have highly specialized builds without... having to use an auto-aim assist to deal with players like this... The game would be FAR more simplistic, easier to balance, and would lose none of the RPG elements by removing vats, stealth boys, and legendaries.
---
If you remove VATS, you remove crits and crits are essential to counter some builds. I prefer that every build remains vulnerable and that there's an emphasis on character build tactics, team coordination, etc. 
---
&gt;All you‚Äôd need to do is pick up the weapons/armor you like, spec into it, and execute your gameplan.
---
That's kinda what it already is. That doesn't sound like fallout. That sounds like a traditional FPS. This isn't anthem, battlefield, or CoD. There are games you can buy that play like that. This isn't one of them.
---
&gt;You don‚Äôt think the major reason people are slow to PvP in this game is due to the janky, over complicated, unnecessary mechanics that adding things like Vats and invisibility and the near limitless amount of legendary rolls?
---
They took a single player game and turned it into a multiplayer game. People barely like the coop play as is, so even fewer like the PvP play. Some of us have embraced it. 
---
&gt;It‚Äôs not that these counters don‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre shitty mechanics that an extremely small amount of people like. The support for this thread shows that.
---
You mean the amount of people that have downvoted the OP's comments? Most of the PvP players that actually know something about this niche game mode (because that's what PvP is right now) have downvoted him or replied negatively. Most of the people that have agreed with him don't appear to know much about PvP other than their few encounters of being forced into and dying with their ill equipped builds. It sounds like that's been your experience as well since the counters for stealth melee is pretty easy.

"I only ate literal shit once but here's my opinion"
---
Hahaha nice thread, I feel like I am bridging those two world !
---
I had someone literally unload his gun at me and tried to melee me and did absolutely nothing. Maybe you missed the part that I said he had power armor and another thing is that you can't kill him. It's not the basis of the post it's the fact that there is no rule or penalty for someone destroying your base with no way to stop it other than leave. 
---
I don't disagree. I just figure people will do the quest for the sole purpose of it being something else to do. Not to mention, if you were expecting mail, you could do the quest yourself. I figure there'd be RP factions acting as postal carriers. They could make the payout pretty decent. Maybe make the quest itself somewhat tedious, but payout well regardless. 100 caps, a few stims, a piece of armor and maybe a plan. Eh, just a suggestion.
---
Not going to repeat myself over and over .. Your're right, Im wrong. LOL Later tater
---
What platform? Do you have a mic? 
---
I don't know the exact location, but I know you can find a minigun at the Poseidon Energy Plant.
---
This is why I role with a crew most of the time I play. Kind of like I would in an actual post crap hit the fan setting. Cause people are dicks. Also I think that why they are making a survival mode. I don‚Äôt know but rumors has it that they will take out pvp in adventure mode. 
---
"Guys!!! Please take my opinion seriously!!!"

Near Charlston?

If so I can grab one
---
What do you mean zero evidence ? There is a Post from Bethesda about this very topic.
---
It's more Honor Rules than official rules.
---
But to be fair, he's 'exploiting' the trade system to get away with people's stuff without paying for it.
---
Honor wise you don't take someone's item then not trade your side of the deal in return.
---
Officially, you shouldn't exploit game systems to ruin other's experiences.  You can get banned for duping and crashing servers, should get banned for stealing items through the trade menu.  It's called 'scamming' and it's a very scumbag thing to do that shouldn't need explanation to redditors because stealing is common sensibly a bad thing to do to real people.
---
What an effort! Thanks dude, all good stuff to keep in mind :)
---
I feel ya man I dropped my tse gauss a day ago: we want favourited items/equipped items to be unscrappable, unsellable and undroppable that way its far less likley you lose your valued weapons and armour
---
I agree, server stability is a joke in this game. Even though, all of the patch notes mention server stability improvements, it never seems to improve.
---
I hear ya. Thats something i never did was just take in the environment. The map is so huge i felt like i had to find and then at some point ill come back. When i eventually go back thats something i have to do. 
---
 I just had this character i was playing since BETA i only got to level 21. I had a hardened sniper i found and shotgun ive been working on. Everyday i played. It just turned into. See what quests out of the huge list i can complete and go to. And hopefully not die cuz this game is meant to played co op. Just loot food and hopefully get screws and aliminum to hopefully repair the guns i broke trying to kill these large enemies. I feel like the my build was busted. And starting a new character after even making that minisciual progress is a drag.. Most of this personal problems and me not learning the actual game. But at 21 i just hit a brick wall

Or have "Legendary" power armor that just has different unique skins. Make them obtainable through events. Do a BoS quest, you have a chance of getting a unique T-60, T-45 or T-51b armor. Enclave event gives you a chance for a unique X-01. Ash Keep events are Excavator and whatever ones in the Savage Divide give you Raider

To be fair, if they could be posted all the time we'd have those radio threads AND constant screenshots, further diluting the posts that are useful.

this is my only build

Would you be intrested in a bloodied axe with ss max lvl?
---
yeah I have no idea what you are trying to say.
---
He's rare but he's always been in the game
---
Looking more for two shots or instigating when it comes to weapons but thanks anyway bud
---
The game seems to have a habit of eating things when it crashes. Best advice I can give is if you power off the PC when this happens it will revert back to a save before the problem. By fast traveling you probably created a save and lost your stuff. I have used the power off trick and it can work. But there's no guarantee.
---
Do you only want 2 handed instigating?
---
Ohhh. That's pretty tricksy.
---
Handmade instigating ? 
---
NOT THE KNEE THE FACE 
---
Maybe you should learn to read. I specifically said "they can grief you with nothing happening to them"
---
I ran into him when the game first launched, and once more maybe a month ago. He sure loves meat

To let you know.....your never safe......pasifist stops your from doing something dumb....not others

Damn was hoping you would say unarmed I have a couple of those sorry dont got instigating hand made good luck on the trades my friend

hes got good plans

Is he using a deathclaw hand ? I‚Äôve had it after me twice 
---
this is my skeleton build i use when i follow people around dropping free loot
---
Heck we did it for 45 minutes after the nuke cleared and this kept allowing us to keep spawning more glowing ones.   After about 30 minutes the numbers did start to decrease.  
---
I mean, it IS West Virginia. Ever been there?
---
Yep the PVP in this game still broken mess . 
---
Do you have two handed melee instigating ? 
---
Only bloodied sorry man
---
But how can that be an issue when players cannot deal damage to other players and their camps, meaning the only thing that can trigger a wanted status then would be them picking someone else's supply drops or them having PvP with someone who clearly consented to it by not having pacifist mode enabled. The only issue i see on it would be in workshops. When claiming a workshop pacifist mode gets disabled upon successfully claiming the workshop. 
---
The Freak Show.
---
No problem bud

Burning Mine has a mini in the building at the top of the hill. On second floor. Sometimes different weapon spawn's there. But server hop if you need to. When server hopping do not pick the weapon thats there. Leave it until the one you want spawns.

Xbox and yes

Mirv grenades, good to know 
---
It sounded like survial mode would end up being used as a battle map, for short term use, when they laid it out. I'm sure there's a percentage of players that will move over there for the hard core experience. 
---
But they've recently talked about changes to pacifist mode that will make unwanted hostlity pointless. No damage recieved and extending that to camps as well. So adventure mode will be full of invincible PVE players, leaving survival mode the only place to PVP. 
---
Also, you may have noticed an increase in high level players farming low level legendaries, myself included. With double the caps for killing higher level players a low level player with awesome gear will be able to get rich.
---
I hope they do let the triple digit level players into survival mode.
---
Only engage in high-value trades with people who have high +karma on /r/Market76. The subreddit even has [official middlemen](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/wiki/middleman) to help with high-value trades if you don't trust the other party.
---
I think I am unconvinced by the energy and heavy weapon changes. Improved ammo efficiency is probably nice for those that use those guns. A friend of mine does and dedicates much of their time spent playing to monitoring the ammo factory and scouring the wasteland for lead and gunpowder to stay stocked on ammo for the .50 MG, no matter how often I tell them the Gatling would serve them better.
---
Semi automatic damage buff on energy weapons doesn't seem like it'll be enough. *Doubling* their damage output wouldn't bring them up to spec against other fast firing semi automatics and *tripling* it would see them be an option to consider. Maybe I'm missing something and the wider community can offer me a perspective I miss. Here is a [generic laser rifle](https://i.imgur.com/0TdIFXy.jpg). It does an awesome 37 damage. There's no mods applied to this weapon save a stock to align it with my rifleman perks but this gun has already peaked. Laser rifles do not possess any sort of Damage+ receiver mod (capacitors, in this case) or the coveted Damage++ receiver mod that you throw on all semi automatics (Hardened receiver). Laser rifles do not possess a magazine mod, so there is no option to apply an armor piercing magazine. I *can* add [the sniper barrel] for an extra 5 damage, with the caveat that I [can only fire this gun once every couple seconds](https://gfycat.com/CarefreePastelLemur). In comparison, a [hunting rifle](https://gfycat.com/LavishLividBarracuda) doesn't shoot this slowly and it's a rifle that manually cycles after every shot. Compare that laser rifle damage of 42 with a sniper barrel, at lv45, to the first iteration of the combat rifle or handmade rifle back at lv20 and lv15, starting off at 52 and 55 respectively while filling the same fast-firing semi automatic role. Here's a [generic plasma rifle](https://i.imgur.com/KJkigmT.jpg) at lv45. It does 2 more damage than the [lv15 handmade rifle](https://i.imgur.com/vdKE4hP.jpg). Unlike the laser sniper, the plasma sniper has no trade off except reloading more often which is a moot point when the only thing you want in this game right now is high per-hit damage so its strictly better than a long barrel while the inverse is true for the laser sniper because you lose a little damage but gain in the dps you apply, even with armor penetration, because you're not waiting so long between each shot. *Tripling* laser and plasma damage would bring them up to spec against the combat rifle and handmade, (though only on paper because most enemies have higher E-DR than DR, coupled with their inability to use an armor piercing magazine), which are their ballistic equivalents unless the Pipe Rifle was actually their intended equivalent. If that's the case, then the laser and plasma are simply trash and can remain as trash along with their junky Pipe counterparts.
---
The cap on turrets is not defined here. Is it 3? 5? 10 turrets? Will turrets across the board be getting a damage increase to compensate? They do fine at killing lv5 trash in the Forest but if you're situated anywhere that high level enemies are common (so anywhere in the Bog, for example) then your turrets are going to get trashed instead. This is not helped by the seemingly negative Perception that turrets have. My camp is situated at the junk node south of Whitesprings. There is a regular spawn point for enemies a little further south, [across a road](https://i.imgur.com/9sbTHsQ.jpg). Super mutants and Liberators can spawn there and destroy my turrets without fear of reprisal as they have the perception and/or agro range to react to my turrets long before my turrets react to them and as they often will not close to engage in melee, being ranged assailants, they can freely attack my base from where they stand behind a ruined truck. There's a hole in the walls of [the Whitesprings](https://i.imgur.com/E08exYt.jpg) where Whitespring bots often patrol. When those patrols are overrun, typically by mutants, enemies engage my turrets and camp from where they stand by the hole in the wall, well past the range of my turrets who fail to respond to being hit. I do not agree with the idea that additional infrastructure (spotlight turrets) is required in order for turrets to be capable of seeing past the end of their nose, especially with turrets being such a strain on workshop budget. As it stands right now, this change will make turrets use less budget and that budget will be immediately recycled into spotlight mountings to make them even somewhat effective at stopping creatures that spawn inside or under the base, let alone those that patrol into it.

Atom store items aren't actively being made, atom store items were already created and have a release schedule.

I wish there were npcs too.. the radiant quest system could be used ( they used to be so proud of that system ). Very limited in the quest department.

Sometimes I'll run around for an hour+ with nothing happening. I'll have to fast travel to the other end of the map to do anything. I have my favorite spots I like to run around so often times it sucks.

I keep trying other builds, but for me melee dps primary with shotguns for crippling build is where its at. i Its super OP currently, and its loads of fun to play. Agilty is definitely #2 i.m.o.  Is so nice to be able to just ground A scorch beast in seconds and then bash its head in. Using Enforcer from Agilty and Skeet shooting from perception.

Sneak, enforcer, plus having all that ap and ap regen from Agilty to sprint to targets

You absolutely can melee someone from 15 ft away with Vats. Lmao. You‚Äôre just being disingenuous now.
---
No, you can't.
---
**Are you aware of how far 15 feet actually is? You‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôre not 4-5 yards away from that eyebot?**
---
Again, the attack speed difference between 2handed with martial artist and 40% swing speed is a fraction of a moment.
---
Assuming you can get 1H or unarmed with 40% SS, there is an attack speed advantage. If both can be specced to one shot, then you take the faster attack speed. So again, 2H is less viable for PvP and it's more of a PvE weapon. Even then, I still prefer 1H/unarmed for PvE because the DPS for both is higher.
---
**Again, for the 3rd time, just because something is a bit better doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt use something. And the burst damage on a 2h is definitely higher than unarmed.**
---
You also are under the assumption that all of these mechanics (such as appearing on the compass, red arrow, etc) will apply to PvP servers. Why?
---
**And? These mechanics also take away from a ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù themed game mode where the world is supposed to be more dangerous. You don‚Äôt think those effects will be addressed? It still doesn‚Äôt solve the problem of someone sitting in a wide open area with a stealth boy. They‚Äôll be far enough away you can‚Äôt see the little tiny arrow, meaning you will be crit sniped before being able to do anything.**
---
We can still have highly specialized builds without... having to use an auto-aim assist to deal with players like this... The game would be FAR more simplistic, easier to balance, and would lose none of the RPG elements by removing vats, stealth boys, and legendaries.
---
If you remove VATS, you remove crits and crits are essential to counter some builds. I prefer that every build remains vulnerable and that there's an emphasis on character build tactics, team coordination, etc.
---
**Crits are again only necessary to kill certain builds because legendaries are in the game and unnaturally can boost your sustainability. If you removed both VATS and Legendaries, you‚Äôd have a world where crits don‚Äôt need to exist. You can still have tactics and coordination without having to rely on dice rolls, auto-aim, and magical pieces of armor that have hidden effects. Just like every other fucking game.**
---
All you‚Äôd need to do is pick up the weapons/armor you like, spec into it, and execute your gameplan.
---
**The game is nothing like this. You equate this overly complex setup for janky PvP to some sort of depth. Why even give us the ability to play the game with FPS combat if the most effective way to kill someone is to use the built in aim-lock? Oh, right, it makes no goddamn sense.**
---
They took a single player game and turned it into a multiplayer game. People barely like the coop play as is, so even fewer like the PvP play. Some of us have embraced it.
---
**They did the same fucking thing with Fortnite, a dead as fuck PvE game and it‚Äôs the biggest game in the world. Good mechanics will attract players, regardless of whatever the ‚Äúinitial‚Äù fan base might be.**
---
It‚Äôs not that these counters don‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre shitty mechanics that an extremely small amount of people like. The support for this thread shows that.
---
**It is on the front page of this reddit you troglodyte. You could add up all the ‚Äúdislikes‚Äù by the select few of people in this thread and it pales in comparison to the amount of people who obviously agree with him. Lmfao.**
---
**The only experience you seem to have in PvP is running some 1337 setup with four or five others (when there are like 15-20 people per server, most of them ungrouped) abusing mechanics that others are not interested in or are unaware of. I‚Äôm also guessing you probably aren‚Äôt the best at the ‚ÄúFPS‚Äù element of the game and enjoy that you can use VATS and dice rolls to win.**

Quick guide
---
There are several factions:
---
1. Responders (various stations and flatwoods)
---
2. Raiders (various stations and pleasant valley ski resort)
---
3. Whitesprings (station and resort share caps)
---
4. Enclave (at The Whitespring Bunker)
---
5. Free States (at Harper's Ferry)
---
6. Brotherhood of Steel (at Watoga Shopping Plaza)
---
7. Watoga Station
---
8. Traveling vendor aka Grahm and Moo Moo
---
Each faction shares/has 200 caps to give from sells for a combined total of 1600, but because Grahm travels you'll usually not find him so you'll manage 1400 caps total usually.
---
Hold onto Glowing Blood, Glowing Blood Packs, Glowing Meat (cook them to become Glowing Meat Steaks), and excess RadX once mutated.  Bulk junk and most junk also help clear out vendors well.  Rangers outfits and straightjackets sell really good as well.
---
Finally from the moment you access a faction's vendor a 20 hour reset timer begins before they'll restock on caps.
---
I understand. I‚Äôm just looking at the grand scheme of things. 
---
Lol, it was frustrating for me at first too, but when you run 6-9 queens a day for a little bit, losing 2 or 3 isn't as bad and the xp is still nicely beneficial
---
Grahm and Chally the Moo Moo have been around since BETA/launch. They follow a very long route around Appalachia, but you can sometimes catch them around towns and workshops if they happen to be passing by during events - Grahm stops and lends a gun and his super mutant strength. üòâ
---
Is that what it is? I've wondered why Sugar Bombs load in 2 stacks.
---
It is always third shift's fault. 
---
Bloodied explosive lever-action sniper/VATS crit build with some crit food/drink/overdrive (combined with Adrenal Reaction mutation and nerd rage) is pretty sick. 
---
Same! LOL üòÇ 
---
Even with an unique skin I think that'd be a bit of a waste of both time coding and art assets. Now let's say they reuse the model for the tesla upgrades in past fallouts.
---
Give it something like 5-10% damage increase with energy weapons. Nothing huge or crazy, but something you'd want to get that armor for beyond just the cosmetic nature. And trust me, I love the look of things like the Tesla armor. I'd farm them right now if they had no actual gameplay value, but at the same time there's no point in not adding a gameplay mechanic to match the visuals.
---
If I was walking around with tesla coils strapped to my armor, you'd think I was built around energy right? So some flavor bonus to that visual flair would be nice.
---
The 'Back on the Beat' Event in Morgantown isn't bad when your a high enough level, but it is a real bummer at lower levels.
---
Breach and clear is the mining machine that pops out of the ground with mole miners. Load bearing is the one that has the boots to repair and gives tokens.
---
Actually, maybe. If you want to dedicate your services to the Enclave. We give out water and food to those law abiding citizens of this great country. 
---
Sneak builds always seem op in fallout and elder scrolls to me, 3-10x damage and nothing really ever attacks you.
---
This suggestion goes in the sphere of ui/controls customization and responsive. I personally don't mind being forced to go thru the animation. It's not the real problem. The real problem is the controls here. I don't want this function
---
Bound to a key that is so easy to mis click. The current control config system has too many functions either completely unable to be rebound or forced to be double duty (sometimes more, looking at grenade / power attack / gun bash / hold breath )tabbing out of the game)
---
Took me like 2 months to figure this out üòÇ
---
Hi, thanks for taking the time to read my post and reply. I'd like to clarify a few things and defend my arguments.
---
&gt;Your tone sounds like you're a PvE player since you equate PvP to griefing. Not to be too obtuse, but I think PvP players should get what they want in PvP servers. 
---
First - I don't put myself into a box that says "pvp" or "pve". I enjoy both aspects of the game and I've done quite a bit of pvp, but I don't really seek it out. As an example, if the workshop I want is taken, I will fight for it. If my workshop is attacked, I will fight off the attackers. If someone is hitting me with slap damage, I'll fight back. However, I don't go out of my way to engage in pvp unless someone is annoying me. If say, someone builds a turret base out back of the golf club? That calls for pvp, and I'll take a bounty to destroy their base with an orbital strike. 
---
I've also done a lot of pvp in MMOs - WoW, Atlas, Rend, SWTOR, SW Battlefront, etc. I played SWTOR almost exclusively for the pvp for about 2 years. There currently isn't really a reason to go out of your way to pvp in Fallout 76 though. Unless someone is specifically doing something that I don't like, I generally don't try to start fights. On the rare occasion that I've done that, people usually just server hop or ignore me. I haven't really found anywhere that does fight clubs or similar.
---
I don't know if that meets your definition of a "pvper", but I can assure you that I greatly enjoy it. Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good battle! I rarely lose these days too, although I have no illusions - the players I typically fight are fighting me for resources, and they are typically PvE players. 9/10 times my harpoon gun one shots them. I've honestly never even seen a full assassin sentinel hardcore pvper. If that's you, or you run with that crowd, ya'll are a rare bunch! I don't equate pvp to griefing, and I too am sick of hearing every person who gets their workshop stolen complain about "griefers". 
---
&gt; I don't think PvE players should dictate what happens on servers they don't intend to play on. 
---
I think my last few paragraphs disproved that I'm a "PvE only" player, but perhaps unless I go out of my way to seek out pvp, I don't make the cut as a PvPer in your eyes. Different strokes I guess.
---
&gt;And to be clear, PvP is a minority of the community and while this is necessary to get more separation between the camps, it really isn't providing much in terms of new content to PvE players. Hopefully the more toxic PvP players will stick to survival mode, but for the ones that really enjoy aggravating others it's probably safe to say they'll stick to the servers where they can antagonize people the most.
---
Agreed, especially that last part. Trolls and griefers don't want fair fights - they want to hear people cry and make them rage quit. 
---
&gt;my words: if a "safe" pve mode exists, there will be no reason to ever play the pvp mode unless you want to grief  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This is a false equivalency. Just because someone enjoys PvP doesn't mean they're a griefer by default. I want to fight people who are willing to fight. If you join a PvP server, I assume you want to fight. If you go to a PvP event, I assume you want to fight. And if you take a workshop, you're informed that it opens you up to PvP, so you better be willing to fight/forfeit.
---
Again, I think you are misinterpreting. I don't mean to equate all pvp with griefing. I hope you don't think this post was an attack on pvp. It's not. The issue that I'd run into is, where's the incentive for anyone except a hardcore pvper to join? And if you have a server full of hardcore pvpers who have nothing else left to do in the game, that already have their full assn/sent set... how long will that stay fun? It seems like people would burn out on the pvp very quickly and either quit or go back to PvE server. Maybe there will be incentives to do pvp. I guess we'll see.
---
And I get it. Starting over, losing my BE harpoon gun, my maxed out caps across several characters, all the items I have yet to trade for gear that I want... that's rough. But the potential for organic pvp - just running into people while out doing quests and leveling, real fights over workshops... that sounds way more fun to me than just joining a server where everyone goes for Fallout 76 "retirement" when they have nothing left to do in the game but pvp. That's just my opinion though.
---
I found it, thanks so much.
---
I know the feeling. I scrapped a chest piece someone made for me not days before. It began with an "A" and was first in that total inventory list. And I guess I have a trigger finger. But, yep, I was wearing it. My friend kindly made me a new one. Let's see if I can manage not to scrap it. 
---
I totally get where you're coming from.
---
I haven't heard of anyone duping recently. Do you know for a fact that dupe methods still exist?
---
Butchers bounty works on ticks as well, but it drops more blood rather than meat. Tick blood =&gt; bloodpacks =&gt; stimpaks.  The circle of life.
---
I turned motion blur all the way down, verified everything is all the way up to high or ultra, and the game still looks like complete garbage.  I'm at 60 fps but just not enjoyable.   Even when you look down at the ground, the leafs and grass are just blobs.   
---
I assumed the fisser sites were where they hit
---
Burning Mine is in the ash heap south of Charleston Fire Dept.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of nukes
---
theres a multishot barrel that gives you 3 shots. so if you got a quad, id assume that makes it 12. 
---
I mean, different teams with vastly different skill-sets, working on different projects. 
---
The people programming quests aren't, generally, the people with the 3d design skills to make new camp items. 
---
pay attention might be in order
---
i got a quad explosive tesla. 60 rounds of firepower is quiet strong tbh. fusion cells are easy to come by for me. 
---
I mean, are caps even really a thing anymore? I farmed hard for a few days and I really don't know what to do with caps now after a few trades. I hope there are better rewards for pvp than caps, because right now you can only trade GG gear for other GG gear. Caps are basically worthless. The only real reason to do what you're describing is for fun and a sense of pride (which is totally cool! I enjoy that too).
---
Yes you should. XP inspirational. 
---
Good god, how much does that do?
---
Haha my bounty hunter build.

These machines are the perfect way to integrate complete character respecs into the game.

thanks, good to know about the .45 and bloody mess

Gotcha

Auto-docs shouldn't be any less reliable than Mr Handy's which are absolutely everywhere in Fallout nowadays. There are many kind of auto-docs in every game.
---
thats good to know, i have to try bloody mess
---
I read that some are still in the game.  I personally can verify that Rose's Quest items like the Trapper's Note and Gourmand's Note and the fixed Uplink will dupe themselves upon logging out and back in if they aren't in your inventory with the Uplink as an exception, it dupes itself while still in your inventory.
---
I know exactly how you feel. I‚Äôm looking forward to the upcoming changes too. 
---
You sound like someone who'd be GREAT fucking fun to play with. Not. 
---
As if melee is not strong enough. lol
---
What console my fellow gauss user?
---
I've seen similar among my group, but from the flip side.  I've been here since BETA and loved the story, told my friends it was among the best FO stories so far, they bought it a few weeks after release.  They then proceeded to rush about mindlessly, ignoring the holotapes and notes, just running around killing stuff.  That, plus the haterade machine online, convinced them the game sucked.

I'm still enjoying my semi-solo career among the BoS.

If you really have the acid to spare, then the best single place for lead and iron ore (steel) that I have found is Hornwright #3. East of the Red Crane is 7 lead veins, West of the Red Crane is like 10 iron veins. Should be more than enough to keep you completely out of acid.  Happy Mining!

How much are you paying for a TSE Handmade or Pump?
---
Any of those in the game mostly everyone has the same built 
---
The mele built üòÇüòÇ
---
Honestly I can understand those people because when the game came out the trash was very heavy quickly and people only pay for strength üí™ and nothing else to carry all that and now they have not more options than keep with that built.
---
K 
---
This!
---
This is kinda sad to sad for me, I launched a nuke at level 17 wayyy to early
---
I currently have 4000 caps, I could throw in extra stuff though. 
---
But paper with double the thickness!
---
I haven't seen anyone doing it for quite some time
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm not even sure I accidentally sold it. I‚Äôm very careful when selling/scrapping, but it‚Äôs no long being in my inventory is making me second guess myself.
---
REVIEW COMMENT: just  want to say thanks! And this guy is great! Got my calibrated shocks and bracers and a nasty tse handmade all for a great price!!! Plus had some great convo, if he will let me, I would love to play with this dude in the future!!! Buy your stuff here!!!! +karma
---
PERFECT! 
---
Duping is gone, asshat players trying to excuse douchebaggery aren't.
---
I'm the 'how do people get below 400 weight build?' with this armor and weapons...
---
Build your house on one foundation block. This will allow you to place it almost anywhere. I used a flat roof and have my generator and some turrents up there. Then I only have water and resource harvester's to place and my camp is finished.
---
Yeah today I got attacked by a guy, after killing him I realized that he had no caps, but he just kept coming and dying over and over. At that point I just left the server
---
Sweet. I usually solo or team up with my buddy who is at a similar level, so I've never hard to worry about this kind of thing. Just don't want to get harassed by misguided folks.
---
If they blocked him from session and had a friend relay his position to them, they could... :/
---
Truth.
---
A lot of enemies have higher ER than DR actually. Makes energy weapons even less useful.
---
I mean, I care. All the people I play with care. So I'd say you're wrong.
---
More quest stuff is great and I want that too (we are getting more quests on the 12th so) but I also want new camp stuff.
---
At least the Tank Killer's stagger effect works with my Plasma Thrower...
---
I've gotten a couple of empty-ish servers recently but it's really luck of the draw. I've also been meeting a lot more players who have voice chat, which makes the game a lot more interesting.
---
It really needs to be fixed. I hate wasting resources when there is no payout on pvp. And if there is an off chance they do beat me, they get a bonus for the revenge AND my level in caps. Its pretty dumb.
---
Multiplayer game modes with no PvP have been called carebear mode since before you were a gleam in your daddy's eye, kiddo.
---
I shall try this out, thank you for sharing!
---
Not accurate.   I was in the silo during launch and my quest did not complete.
---
Dude, suck it up. It's really not their problem if we can't manage our inventory diligently. I once lost an explosive shotgun in FO4, my corner-stone weapon in the game, a weapon that literally blasted a Mirelurk *out* of its shell, and I completely accepted it was my fault.
---
Huh, it's almost like you don't understand that the team making quests amd in game content, isn't the same as the designers they have making pretty stuff for the Atom shop.
---
I usually scrap mine or sell it.  I have a Plasma Thrower.  Might not heal teammates but I don't need to if I kill all the baddies.
---
Good luck. I just had 10 legendary mobs spawn. Plus events. 
---
I find the interface to be sluggish and particularly non-intuitive on PC. I‚Äôm looking for this change to be a safety to protect against
---
Free States members are rolling in their graves. 
---
Who gave *you* the authority to police Appalachia? No one!

Most of the vigilantes got banned with the dupers. For the simple fact theyd pick up their items and drop them in another world. Shouldnt be an issue anymore
---
Can confirm, front door to the golf club with a plasma thrower can clear the club out like 90% while solo.
---
energy resitance  is a different thing...
---
few things to consider:
---
Grim Reaper: some reports this perk doesnt work atm
---
Tender lv3: consider using lv1 and pick Lone Wanderer lv1 
---
Picklock: unnecessary while roaming, consider using Tank Killer lv3 instead
---
Concentra Fire: consider using lv1 and pick Ground Pounder lv2
---
It got very un-good for several patch cycles where some pretty ugly bugs got released and dupers and exploit farmers were making things miserable for the non-cheaters out there. Brief bit of drama over some false ban claims. But, once we got a little time in, things got better. Not going to claim a complete turnaround, but now that a few of the insanely bad habits (millons of items in inventory, bobble head stacking, etc) have been dealt with, and the roadmap for new content looks promising, there‚Äôs actually some renewed optimism out there...
---
Here's my build im level 74 and loving it. Don't forget some perks are situational i.e lockpicking.

They might have just been about to log out anyhow. I did this exact same thing last night. Im 111, and she was a 35. But I was about to log off for the night and was just repairing stuff.
---
DO NOT USE THE ENCLAVE PLASMA GUN FOR THE PLASMA THROWER
---
You'll only be making life much harder for yourself.  Instead go to the BoS vendor in Watoga Shopping Plaza, buy the Plasma Gun plan, craft a bunch of them and scrap until you get the flamer barrel mod.  The enclave plasma gun and nonEnclave plasma gun are two completely seperate weapons with seperate mods.  Enclave plasma weapons are much rarer (I feel like) than normal plasma guns.
---
This only deals radiation to them.

You‚Äôre clearly not getting it, as multiple comments have already addressed this. 
---
You *cannot* get scammed in this game if you don‚Äôt let yourself, it‚Äôs really just that simple. Any ‚Äútrader‚Äù that requests you drop the item before payment, requests the payment before the item, or otherwise acts shady is a bullshitter, and shouldn‚Äôt be trusted. This applies to real life as well: if you smell a little bullshit, there‚Äôs a lot. Worried they will kill you? Don‚Äôt go with junk in your inventory. But I (and others) have no sympathy for people who get scammed because it‚Äôs their fault. 
---
Don‚Äôt hate the player, hate the game. 
---
No. You should seek help before it's too late.
---
Accurate. I was in the silo during multiple launches and my quest completed.
---
Happened to me with the hack 50 terminals one, literally the last one I need for platinum. Seems like some trophies get bugged? :(
---
I‚Äôd say broke and not just Beta, I never played the Beta and the Leave Vault 76 trophy never came up, had to create an alt just to make it work...
---
I understand what you're saying, but that makes the game worse for everybody instead of punishing just the griefers.
---
  I've been playing since beta, and I've played hundreds of hours.  In that time I've never had someone slap me to death.  I have had more times than I can count where I take a workshop, and then someone drops a nuke somewhere.  It's almost impossible to fight of hordes in a nuke zone without accidentally shooting someone, especially when vats locks onto the wrong target.  If I have to leave passive to take a workshop, then I might not want to go into a nuke zone because I might accidentally shoot someone.
---
They should get rid of the slap damage mechanic completely, and make it so that you don't do any damage until both people have shot each other, or make it so that if you do more than like 50 slap damage to someone you get a suspension.
---
I know any achievement that should have unlocked durning the beta glitched and you had to make a new character to get it. Wouldn't think it would affect anything that shoulda recently unlocked.
---
Appliances 
---
Are you on PC? I have two (one from a friend who was never interested in melee) and I'd gladly give it to you. :)
---
That's nothing man.. I wouldn't sell my 3 star vampire grognak weapon to a guy so then he proceeds to knock me offline for a few hours. I had messages from him even admitting he did it sent them to Xbox and nothing happened.. rip
---
Team up with someone who has level 3 rad sponge. It should work fairly well. If they are wearing power armor you would only need level 1 rad sponge to keep them free of rads. I did that with someone who had no power armor and he said he had virtually no rads. I had T51 on, which has the lowest radiation resistance, but he uses level 1 rad sponge and I was fine.
---
I really want to play it but it just looks so bad. It‚Äôs hard to go from playing games I‚Äôm used to this.  It looks worse than Fallout 4 to me. 
---
Yeah that was a thing so I just made a new character all together, I thought maybe restarting the game was gonna fix it but that didn't do it sadly.
---
Same thing for me on Xbox. Level 98 now. Wondering if level 100 will show for me or not.
---
That was fkn brilliant, bravo. can't wait to see more
---
I wish there were PvP servers.
---
thank you for the clarification!
---
Uuurgh Mr Messenger is almost as annoying as Mr Prizebot who always turns up at the most inconvenient times.
---
U gotta go be mayor again to get another... Best of luck
---
I wish there were PvP servers that won't load in any of your non PvP server gained items.
---
When they finally cave and give us PvP servers please remove all items and levels gained from the other servers instead of being a sore loser devs please.
---
This is so fucking cool wtf. So glad to see RP has formed in 76, I haven't played in forever.
---
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have Tank Boy as your ingame picture and it shows

If your first levelling experience was a while back, the big difference now is that Whitesprings is almost always full of max level ghouls. If you want an easy life, don't bother trying to do the missions there (or Pleasant Valley) for a while. Otherwise, approach with care and with your junk stashed.
---
If you're playing solo, stealth is very strong, and can enable you to kill stuff far above your level if necessary. Get a suppressor on your long rifle and Sneak &amp; Escape Artist perks as soon as possible.

This is mine.

you might not find ground pounder that useful, very rarely should you ever get into a battle that a full magazine and 1-2 AP refreshes on kill won't kill everything.
---
mod your weapons with Calibrated or Tweaked automatic receivers, reflex sight, stinging magazine, and a stock that improves hipfire and durability. You can use pretty much any VATS capable weapon with zero perks and do 3x as much damage as a casual player.  Combat rifle and Assault rifle are very good vats weapons, dont be afraid to try them.
---
Crap, yea it‚Äôs called lode bearing, I had the wrong event. 
---
No but with the amount of AAE +1 agility and bloodied explosive 25% less vats lever actions and other guns floating around I think so. I find it hard to believe the RNG in this game would create that item in the amount that there are rn. 
---
I have a 3* AA GP if you're interested in buying.
---
I get what you're saying. I'm trying to collect all the different Teddy bears and right now they're in my stash, I'm worried they'll auto scrap if I run out of raw materials they can be broken down into.

They should call it pacifier mode because everyone that turns it on acts like a baby when someone kills them.

How did they trap you? I haven‚Äôt heard of this yet.

Pvp in this game is terrible un fun and unbalanced the only time I had fun in pvp was in the beta when no one had these broken builds now it‚Äôs just as bad as any exploit.  Especially when pvp is started in a workshop.

I got my CAMP close to it. It's an impressive view. Lol.

Honestly I‚Äôm hoping when the new PVP mode comeS out regular mode is only PVE. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for this game to be pvp. The whole point is to rebuild. PvP doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative. Also there‚Äôs no real reward to kill someone. Except you‚Äôve ruined their day

I got killed and when I respawned back in I was trapped inside of a room with no doors. Only thing inside was the rug.

What kind of mutation are you using?

I stopped playing due to power armor weight carry limits being all over the place. I had 16 strength and sometimes a carry limit of 220 or so. Sometimes 320. Sometimes 420 if wearing the mining power armor. Get out of it though and I'm back to 220. Get back in...and I'm still at 220...

Will this be addressed?

I made the same initial overhyped reaction when I read that, but then realized that the "mythical beast" refers to the 4/9 Shear Terror update, the "lost generation of scouts" refer to the 5/7 update, and only the "strongest brew" part of the teaser referred to the imminent update coming on 3/12 :(

It's certainly been an adjustment, having to craft everything, stockpile stims and ammo, keep myself hydrated and fed not to mention taking on groups of enemies without a trusty companion. I didn't think I'd enjoy FO76 at all and admittedly only started playing recently.

Sure, I'm still not all that good but it's far more enjoyable than I initially thought it would be and it's been great to be able to play with others, so far everyone seems to be helpful and I have been pleasantly surprised by the invitations from higher level players to join their team, even if I don't feel that I bring much to the table! 
---
The element of teaming up with others is actually one of the most enjoyable aspects for me which I absolutely didn't expect!
---
What platform are you on? I can run you in there, probably get you 2 levels on the way there. 
---
Cool
---
Whitesprings is the grinding hotspot so it will have level 40+ ghouls 90%of the time.
---
See if you can find a body guard as you try to collect the sword.
---
5
---
Exactamundo!
---
Anything really. I'm at lvl 5. I just haven't had the will to play this game because I cant do anything without being killed by other players.
---
Was in the same boat as you. Came back 5 levels later with better weapon and skills and cleared the place solo. Sometimes you need to adjust your focus and come back.
---
So I found and collected in the area listed above, however it didn't register until I was doing the Organic Solution quest. Part calls for you to collect a pod, you grab a glowing one, do the quest step, and get the point for the atom challenges!
---
I was pretty sure it did not become a pile, because a lot of posts on reddit complain of it deleting before being looted.
---
That sounds amazing, until it breaks, but until then you'll probably be unkillable against pve. Did it have the -90% weight on it? 
---
I got a supressors gatling gun with -90% weight. It saves me 3 strength perk slots.
---
Whitesprings is popular for high level players to farm and that makes higher level spawns quite likely.
---
However, it should be doable to get the sword. You just are dinking in and out.
---
Just be sure to make the best armor/weapons you can. Optionally get a set of power armor.
---
Fast travel in. Sprint to the sword, fast travel out. Stash all your junk first and death has no consequences.
---
No, I physically can see it become a pile, just the same as with most other mobs after a while. Other people can get loot from it too, it isn‚Äôt being deleted in this case
---
This is also me. Plus where I'm at, my stupid internet doesn't allow my mic to work anyway, so unless I'm also signed into the XBox app on my phone at the time and feeling comfortable enough to accept your party invite, good luck. 
---
I know the feeling and it sucks balls I have had similar issues like this I think there should be a way to report players who do things like this. You would think BS would want to fix this as it has caused many player's to give up the game or give negative feedback I'm one of them I have lost loot , camps , etc... so many times that it makes me nervous to visit vendors anymore to sell my junk.  Weapons wtc...  because I have been attacked so many times while doing this. I wish they would have separate servers like most online games it would be an easy fix and solve a lot of these problems.
---
I built a 4 story tower the other day and then realized It was too tall for the roof. I just logged off.
---
There ain't much else to do there. And that was before the bombs.
---
Need something like 4‚Äôs bobble head stand for the teddy bears
---
Ya know man it's more fun to figure it out by yourself. Are you wearing power armor? Do you have high strength? Barbarian in Strength, Evasive in Agility, Iron Clad in Endurance, those are all perks that will help you take damage out of power armor. Blocker is a strength perk which reduces melee damage taken. Look for damage resistance.
---
Aren‚Äôt all fast and medium speed weapons one handed and all slow are two? That‚Äôs what I assumed
---
Me: This is my girl character. This is my old prospector character.
---
There's a mod on Nexus that locks favorites. There's a new one that replaces the broken save my stuff mod.
---
Very valuable information! I was thinking, maybe Ever Upwards will expand off of the lower part of the map, as there is a lot of space that we‚Äôre missing out on there, and it‚Äôs pretty much a forest already.
---
Because that would make sense. 
---
I got in the room on one of my attempts but the container looked empty or it was locked. Couldn't really tell because I had 10 of them on me but it was one of the two. I saw there was a terminal next to it. Do I need to use the terminal to unlock the case?
---
For sure! Honestly I'm just excited they are expanding the map instead of recycling locations
---
I travel to whitespring and drink the water by the gazebo to cure my diseases, healing for the price of fast travel! 
---
This is my only build.
---
Unlike you I do have sympathy for people going into a trade with good intention, only to be  ripped off in the process. I wouldn't do it in real life or in game, but maybe that's just me &amp; this is a free for all.
---
Why would I hate the game when its the player being dishonest, yes trading can be improved, so does that then give me permission to do whatever I like?
---
Maybe you see it that way, but I won't become a prick to other players just because the game allows it.
---
Scrapped a Mr Gutsy model I found:( was hoping to keep it until it was place-able in camp
---
That would be great. On the roadmap there was something about decorating our camps with items we've picked up, even if I could just drop them all on a bed or something that would work.
---
What platform?   
---
Think tis you m8
---
Explosive energy weapons don't drop anymore, hence the legacy. Sadly this means no more rifle ranged cryolators for maximum lols. 
---
I think EVERYONE wants this!! Id love to make a little village and have our shops set up with a vendor bot that auto deals for you or something.
---
There is the issue with the favorites wheel but have not experienced any saving issues beyond that.
---
Radshield would probably help too.   It gives you 300 rad resistance.  You learn the recipe from one of the quests.  
---
very good work essay andy
---
those people can play without pacifist...
---
Also we gotta get the fix that stops two similar items from unfavoriting one another of they share a type. Like I have black diamond lv 35 skisword and a level 35 supressors skisword and everytime I log on it unfavorites my supressor. So  
---
please
---
personally I think the SBQ fight should automatically make no one damage anyone else
---
I would be all for this as well.  I also would love to see the actually date change over time (not just in a play session). It's like groundhog day. 
---
Yeah I wish the models werent scrappable.... I have killed three now that I wanted to hold onto.
---
Dreaming of the day I can display them on a shelf
---
I have a pair how rare are they ?
---
as I say elsewhere, I think the SBQ fight should automatically be only PvE, there should be no friendly fire across the board for a SBQ fight
---
came here to say this. they are the pinnacle of tech in the fallout universe next to power armor...yet they are so weak. 
---
It's been like this for years, the days of having skill checks and complex decisions are long gone because they're not marketable. Skyrim skill trees were linear, now we're down to these fucking cards, I wish it would go back to being a faux-d20 game.
---
Like 300-600
---
I have no idea, someone tried to buy some off me but I didn't know what to charge
---
Sometimes with a patch it does a full download again.  Not sure why.  First patch I had was 45 gigs. Looked at my memory breakdown and it was still at 50 or so gigs total and not the 95 I expected. Something crazy going on consoles from what I've read. 
---
It's just as bad at whitesprings, when everybody's fighting the horde at the door to the country club.
---
Define low levels?
---
Never had anything wrong with saving 
---
I also love the ‚Äúglitch‚Äù where when you‚Äôre scrapping things fast, it‚Äôll jump two items down quick or whatever and you end up scrapping something you didn‚Äôt want to scrap. 
---
I try to keep specific junk or mats for usage but end up selling them
---
When I first read the title, I thought it said turn into a meat pie. Mmmm, pie.
---
Wasn't trying to be judgmental player. My response was an admonishment to be careful when you go to the vendor.  Legendaries can't be scrapped, everything can be sold. Happens to all of us.
---
Urs saves a 100% everytime then? Never anything strange? Like my weapons broke cause I did it during that quest but that's all it saved.
---
PC. If you have a work-around I would be most grateful. :)
---
comment
---
This was my wife and I's exact thought. Like..trying to see if I have junk they want on me or to see if I have weapons that would be a better one than theirs etc. I ignore most players that do this now. You've confirmed my suspicion!
---
Only a matter of time before shit like this happens.  Every vidya game ever stops you before you lose a 'favorite'...
---
until now
---
Other than the rad sponge thing i dont think so. Ive been out of power armor before the stacking of radx and shield nerf and had like 1100 resist to rads and still got +13 rads a second. Thats with all my armor pieces having +25 and a little more with trapper armor. Still couldnt do it for very long. 
---
That sounds like a good suggestion.
---
I was literally having a dream about this earlier, it was an irl dream with overt fallout themes and random people kept seeing my base and running up to build near me.
---
By the end of the dream we had a proper town and I was feeling pretty safe.
---
Hey man, came across you a few times on Wednesday, you helped me out and dropped me some cool things. Class act. Thanks for the help. SownDoughnut882.
---
I didn‚Äôt know what these where but the ideas people are presenting as a counterpart to the rad shower is wonderful I hope this picks up enough momentum to be implemented.
---
Well, I've only been disconnected 5 times tonight. Currently waiting to get back in
---
Don‚Äôt forget the unstoppables event! Lol but for the most part your right.
---
You need a holotape that can be found in the shower upstairs at the feet of a skeleton.
---
That allows you to unlock the display case via the adjacent terminal. 
---
Boring unless a number of players are following it.
---
I don't know if it was just the route he was on, or if it was our numbers, but there were like four of us doing one near Sunnytop Station and it was a path of Deathclaws and Yao Guai, and honestly pretty fun.
---
That sounds pretty awesome man. I'm unfortunately on PC, or else I would definitely want to be there.
---
If you have an extra tinfoil hat I'll buy it off you!
---
Ahhh... my build is uhh "i wanna make guns build with hey I need to find extra ammo and medicine with OHSHIT I need strength for haul my as since I took a wrench"
---
Ugh.  Thanks.  How did I miss it?
---
Building inside structures is pretty nice and provides the best defense. 
---
It‚Äôs nice to visit but I haven‚Äôt found any location where I would like to build a camp and I‚Äôve been searching for the last two weeks.   
---
The place that I liked the best is near the Nuke plant on the North West side of the lake.  There are a couple of small islands just offshore from the ‚Äúthough shall not pass‚Äù fence that looked promising.  
---
My problem with the mire is that there is no wood.  I craft a lot of food and need wood.   Traveling just for wood seems silly.  Is there any wood in the Mire or do you have to import it?   
---
LOL...   sounds like a budding business, The Mire Wood Company...   We import only the best wood scraps....
---
I‚Äôm near site Alpha on a nice stream with blackberry and Firecracker bushes  all around me and plenty of wood.  I craft about 60 soups, juices, etc at a time and it lasts me almost a full day of play time.  One less thing to worry about.  And I get thirsty during Nuke events....
---
I build mine near the electric plant near watcha. Because you can farm deathclaws and sometimes they are legendary....but I'm lol 60 so I just moved my camp where convenient for me until I hit cap.
---
I was under the impression that the bottling thing next week actually did have a minor quest attached to it... if only to find the speakeasy.
---
I feel as though that needs to happen, how else could we recreate the world? With civilization of course!
---
Yup, unfortunately only the rad giving version works. Discovered it after taking the food producing workshop and making a ton of sugar bombs which couldn't be used  üò•
---
I actually find stockpiling whiskey and mentats to make grape mentats easier and gives better CHR
---
Umm try gun bashing a wall? Or a friend in pacifist mode
---
I was level 20 being harassed by a level 120
---
I built mine right outside flatwoods. Access to water, next to a vendor, very rarely do I get attacked and when I do it's low level stuff. Lots of stuff to make consumables and healing salve. Plus all the stuff in the town is good to grab for junk and stuff you can't build. I usually have a steady supply of leather and brahmin meat. 
---
Didn't consider pacifist. No luck on the wall.
---
As a lower level it is probably better to have a flexible mobile build as you will be running around quite a lot.
---
I did to but i just click in on the stick to show only crafteable items
---
I always carry my .50 call as a primary weapon.
---
Level 30-40 was the hardest slog in the game and I was feeling the same at this point. 
---
I had hardly any good loot drops so was just using standard gear, not legendaries. 
---
My advice, keep persisting and join a group of players who don't kind you tagging along. Go kill some shit and hopefully get some good loot. 
---
 I'm only about level 65 atm but it's the most fun I've had in the game. 
---
As it is, playing in power armor is playing a different game compared to regular armor.  More options are always good, but there'd be serious balance concerns.  
---
But then again, seeing as the PA and non-PA divide is so wide, why the hell not?  If the millionaire gets another dollar, what's it to the guy who has only 10 bucks?
---
Can you do that quest again?
---
Sold a BE double barrel a couple months ago...fuck still hurts thinking about it. I had a great replacement for it after but I still remember the whole 3 hours I had it.
---
There are some quests that don't restore correctly if you don't finish them in one sitting (Belly of the Beast, for example).  But for the most part, your case is unusual.  The game should save when you logout.  The only thing that's currently weird that I know about is what t455160 said about the favorites wheel.  You have to re-assign items to it sometimes when you login (it happens when you have multiple items of the same type, but with different Legendary prefixes).
---
Woah that‚Äôs great that you bought it back. Incredible.  
---
Actually I care because I want to get that sweet Plague Rider power armor paint!
---
Just add a an add to junk option that I can easily get rid of stuff out of, sell junk add a slider for the cap amount, sell indicated amount or closest combo to it
---
Thanks friend üòÅ
---
I was also a day 1 beta player who left for a while. I just hopped on yesterday morning after not having played since late November. 
---
In my case the reason I left for as long as I did was intentionally giving it a rest for a while to let bugs and stability get worked out; and real life just getting in the way as it tends to do. 
---
I‚Äôm honestly happy to say that my experience jumping in again after all this time was much as I expected it to be. Server performance and stability has increased and improved by bounds from what I remember it being. Player load is down a lot and things feel more empty; which is actually what I wanted from the very beginning. I can‚Äôt speak much as to endgame content seeing as I‚Äôm only Level 21 (I admit I‚Äôm a filthy casual and no-life grinding just isn‚Äôt my style). 
---
All in all this game is feeling much more like the game I was wanting at the start and I‚Äôm honestly excited to be getting back into it now. 
---
The crits probably do a few thousand when they actually work properly. Base damage is 752 at 20% health. I'm always sneaking, so that is x2.5 = ~1880 x2 for VATS critical = 3760 base w/ no food drink bonuses. I also have Eagle-Eye which adds 25% crit dmg with class freak, so ~4700 for crits. The mutations would be even better if adrenal reaction and stranger in numbers weren't both bugged. 
---
I get the quest conflict with some camp locations but since only a few structures (prebuilt) could be occupied  it would be nice to offset the loss potential of some with some new buildings opened up to camp in.
---
Eat Radaway like candy. There is no substitute for a hazmat suit or PA. If you see one of us out there in our armor, we are chowing down on chems the whole time to stay alive.
---
Also, bring water and equip it in the quick menu. 
---
I would like to add the Goatman to the list of new cryptids. He's from the Appalachia region and there is a drawing of a goat looking man. 
---
I can only comment on the sniper barrels; my experience with crafting laser guns is that the sniper barrel does in fact increase damage, however it also decreases magazine size. 
---
Honestly, this is how Bethesda more or less marketed this game. I hope they are planning on adding this to the game at some point.
---
Exactly what I do, except when you leave the train station, head east down the highway till you reach the second traffic pile up.. There are 6 ghouls there who can and will drop legendaries, cut across to the east gate, just slightly below the main entrance to the Enclave bunker entrance, there are unusual spawns there.  I have seen everything from Behemoths to Mothrmen.  Follow the path up to the pool area and repeat.
---
The mountains..it's hidden and has a ton of resources
---
And you let one get away...   sigh.....
---
I took on three in the Mire....   got them all, a rare hat trick...   
---
Wow. I JUST had my first issue with saving moments ago. I crafted 20 or so RadAway (first time utilizing the plan for it). 
---
I then walked away and maybe a minute later the server crashed. 
---
Now I‚Äôm back in and my RadAway is gone. I still have everything I need to make them again. Which is great. 
---
Or even just increase the amount of material you get from resource nodes. It would be very helpful for ultracite collection
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm on PS4...
---
Many people have said this, but It's actually the Sheepsquatch
---
Here‚Äôs how I imagined the implementation of T.O.W.N.S, ideally they would be separate allowing you to keep your C.A.M.P as an on the go base or permanent personal outpost somewhere. T.O.W.N.S however would need at least 2 people in a group to build one. They would act as more of a base of operations for your team. They would function similar to a camp but would ultimately be bigger and have more storage space. 
---
The group leader is the one who places the T.O.W.N then all players in a group can build in it pulling from their own personal resources. Every player has a storage limit the size of one C.A.M.P and all things they build would be stored in their own personal T.O.W.N storage, if the players aren‚Äôt playing together the town will spawn but only with objects built by the players currently there.
---
A bit arbitrary but I would also like the ability to name my T.O.W.N and give other non teammate players a free fast travel point. With this you would pick and choose who can and can‚Äôt.
---
Production terminals will sell them sometimes. They require Ultracite and fluxes to make though so gotta be a bit higher level.
---
I still would like to see the Goatman. 
---
Tuesday.
---
Level 2 of hardcore: If I have these specials I dont need an alt and can alternate these two builds to my hearts desire. Melee and shotguns if anyone wonders. I use the extra int for first aid and batteries included when I am not using melee. Alternatively I use green thumb or lock picking when  I'm not use shotguns 
---
I haven‚Äôt had much of a problem, but perhaps I‚Äôm lucky? Never been murdered, just gotten slap damage half a dozen times. 
---
Wish more nukes were dropping tho...feels like the skies have been clear for a while 
---
Bethesda makes best games change my mind...
---
Doesn't that seem a bit weird that I can't? Why not even make me commit 5 perk cards to it or something? Why am I being punished for using a viable, and encouraged playstyle? Seems backwards. 
---
No need
---
Fixes are not yet love. Next week is when the patch hits. There have been no changes to this point. 
---
nope the only way to dmg your weapon is take out the gunsmith perk  and shoot at enemys (hit is needed) i test it my self long time ago for the same reason and saddly nope. no dmg on weapon if it not hit anything.
---
Thanks. My first thought was it could be quest specific. I'm almost certain it was finished cause I waited for the rewards and everything and there wasn't a next step to it. I guess I'll just do it again and see if it works.
---
Thank you anyway for your effort. :)
---
The balance is tricky. Basically someone in PA or a Hazmat suit is sacrificing all of the legendary effects of their armor for rads protection in a nuke zone.
---
Most or the time, I run a hazmat suit. But if I need to be at max damage and DR, I just eat the chems and burn through all my water. 
---
I have it near Whitespring so i can sell my stufffor the greatest profit
---
PSA, Excavator power armor already doubles your ore yield.
---
Ugh. Such a completely dumb oversight not to be able to repair over-repaired items. Ah well, thanks!
---
It‚Äôs be good for some teams where not everyone has the same plans/benches/resources/food. They can share a bunch of water purifiers or a radiation arch or whatever.
---
roll backs on a server crash are not uncommon.  I have had that happen before. 
---
Stealth IS glitched currently in various ways that are intermittent and don't always have a clear cause.
---
1. Forever Cautioned that breaks Healing Factor Mutation and stops 2.5x damage (Occurrence: Frequently, Hourly)
---
2. Switching weapons causes enemies to instantly spot you sometimes from ridiculous distances (near the unrendering distance) (Occurrence: Semi-Frequently, every other hour)
---
3. Forever Dangered yet able to fast travel YET breaks the Healing Factor Mutation and stops 2.5x sneak attack damage from occurring (Occurrence: Semi Rare, once to twice very day)
---
4. Sneaking randomly stops working, similar to 2 in that you'll become instantly spotted for no clear reason, the brackets don't even close in it just jumps to being Dangered. (Occurrence: Very Rare, has happened to me twice out of several weeks)
---
Keep in mind we all get effected differently it seems, some people the sneak mechanic is genuinely broken, others barely are effected.  I didn't get forever Dangered until a week ago, others have had it for over a month.
---
from the wiki site it says: lvl 25/35/45 so minimum lvl to use it is lvl 25 but what lvl of gunsmith its need for crafting is there no information. only the mods seems to need lvl 4 gunsmith.
---
I Feel like the instructions say that if you favorite items it keeps you from accidentally selling them. could be thinking of another game though. 
---
Did the same thing. Rip shielded vault suit. 
---
Future presidential stuff. 
---
Good idea about removing Makeshift Warrior, it hadn't occured to me.
---
No problem! Glad to be of help!
---
I deleted my first 2. I didn't know there was a max, but it makes sense. There's a max number of photos, it's like 35 or so.
---
So much this.
---
Yeah I had 3 but deleted one..my main is level 57 and my alt is 38...I use my alt more now 
---
Do you still have it? My husband has one I love to use  on his account but I‚Äôm just a level 40 and I‚Äôm not very good with guns yet so I won‚Äôt be able to do the quest to get it anytime soon. I‚Äôll glady buy it from you. 
---
My man, I cannot imagine your pain. My TSE Gauss is one of my favorite weapons 
---
There is a nice place west of Dyer Chemicals with a waterfall and lead deposit. I lived there for quite some time.
---
I have since moved south of Big Maw, where there is a lovely spot next to a junk deposit and some ponds.
---
Dolly Sods is a good spot to gather wood
---
Aaaand, he's dead. Better luck next time all
---
nice work man!
---
What another ridiculous thing to say. You have no idea how old I am, and to try to make an insulting accusation out of it just alludes even more to your arrogance.
---
I‚Äôm more than likely much older than you think I am - possibly, even older than you.  Not that any of that matters, but, alas.
---
All I meant to point out is your original comment was needlessly aggressive and condescending. Just because people disagree with what you like, it does not mean they‚Äôre wrong. I learned that when you were more than likely still in diapers, my dear friend. Cheers.
---
I‚Äôve been saying this from the start. I think the biggest reason it‚Äôs gotten so much bad press is because of how they marketed it. If they had marketed it as an early-access or in-development title they would have seen a lot more success in it because people would have tempered their expectations of the game with that in mind. Any game that gets marketed as a full fleshed out main line title is going to look like a dumpster fire if it‚Äôs only actually functioning at the level of an in-development side entry. 
---
oh damn man thanks
---
Any high health, low damage enemies you can think of?
---
Took me forever to save mole rat teeth for the extra claw mod. I kept scraping them.
---
What are you talking about. I did not mention the gay ass adom shop. Just said make more missions
---
I logged in last night and there were dots on the map all around my campsite, they weren't moving so I needed to investigate. I found several camps filled with friendly, quiet but emoteful wastelanders. I emoted back and went on my way to sell off my wares at the White Springs when the nuke rolled in. As I suited up for one of my first real Nuke zone runs some of my neighbours come strolling by. They offered me a spot on the team and off we went for well over a thousand shotgun shells. It was worth it and not just in the 1022 pounds of stuff I find myself on this train platform with, but in the random goodness of these sorts of encounters.
---
What atom shop?? No mention of it. Quests make more QUESTS
---
The valley south of flatwoods is good. Near two vendors, water wood, great flat land and there‚Äôs a random encounter spot near the electric tower. 
---
In April more ques supposedly. The main story was short and boring so I don't even know why I care about more quests
---
I haven't seen that during my 110 levels this far. Does it happen, sure. But if it bothers you then you can just log out and log back in if they are persistent. 
---
Any word on how exactly player vending will work? 
---
If you can‚Äôt elaborate too much, can you at least let us know if the trading subreddits will become pointless after the addition? 
---
Ikr
---
Twas not an enjoyable moment of my fallout career haha
---
I think you're right...
---
Hard Bargain is NOT worth it.
---
Oh man. Okay, thanks. Also, do you know where I can find Sturdy Combat Armor leg
---
Agreed. I really don't understand why some people need their hands held for something this simple.
---
I'm always worried I'm going to scrap my X-01 Power Armor with dual calibrated shocks that were a real pain to get. It would be nice if you could mark items and they wouldn't show in scrap or sell menus unless you unmark them. And when trading with other players they couldn't see them.
---
Please Bethesda fix the weight of legendary items. It‚Äôs really elementary school math. My Suppressor‚Äôs Pump Action Shotgun has ‚Äò90% reduced weight‚Äô listed as a feature yet still weighs 10.5 lbs. So the original non-legendary version should be more than 100 lbs? My 10 year laughs at this every time she sees it. This is just one of my many ‚ÄòLegendaries‚Äô that have absurd weighs. 
---
&gt;I've honestly never even seen a full assassin sentinel hardcore pvper. If that's you, or you run with that crowd, ya'll are a rare bunch!
---
I guess that is me. I made some friends in game, then made enough that I had to start a discord. We took on some PvP members and now the whole group is on the PvP train.
---
Most of us start new characters to do PvP. Since the only way to do this was through adventure mode (or the current game mode), it'd be a lot of sunk time for those of us who have been preparing for this game mode for some time. For me, I've sunk 3 characters' worth of time in prep for survival mode.
---
&gt;I think my last few paragraphs disproved that I'm a "PvE only" player, but perhaps unless I go out of my way to seek out pvp, I don't make the cut as a PvPer in your eyes. Different strokes I guess.
---
TBH I think you're probably playing the game as intended more than most of us are (including me). 
---
&gt;The issue that I'd run into is, where's the incentive for anyone except a hardcore pvper to join? And if you have a server full of hardcore pvpers who have nothing else left to do in the game, that already have their full assn/sent set... how long will that stay fun? It seems like people would burn out on the pvp very quickly and either quit or go back to PvE server.
---
I dunno, I think the latest changes to workshop takeovers really made PvP more interesting. It skewed the game so stealth builds could contest easier. With the changes to survival mode it's going to be even more interesting since there's a chance to drop aid items. Aid drops would reduce peoples' reliance on stealth boy spam, spam heals, and serum chugging. I imagine the first few weeks are going to be a straight murderfest, but once people realize the costs to sustain the new game mode things will slow down and people will be more strategic how they approach the game mode.
---
Assassin+sentinel is pretty easy to organically match through other means (hashtag teamempath) and is easily defeated with other tactics like relying on crits. It used to be hard to defeat, but it seems like the hardcore PvP crowd figured the work-around pretty quickly. 
---
I honestly don't think any of the hardcore PvP crowd is going to go back to PvE. Most of us are hungry for new content and other players are limitless new content and experiences. Humans are unpredictable, the PvE game is not. 
---
In any case, if we essentially press the reset button on survival mode and only allow survival only characters, you'll likely see people revert to bloodied and unyielding builds. With just 1 star drops (unyielding armor, any bloodied weapon), you can get crazy damage for melee or crazy range from rifles. With only two viable build types it's probably going to kill the new game mode's growth. It's not like PvP has a wide audience either. Last I heard, only 8% of the playstation player base has completed the challenge to kill 20 people.
---
Lastly, the game has not eliminated all dupe methods. The game is still open to exploit. All this does is creates a new market for the RMT crowd. TBH I'm doubtful the game can eliminate dupe exploits unless they remove inventory roll back. People have been doing that as far back as ultima online, so there's a seasoned crowd that understand the mechanics on how to do it 10 different ways. 
---
I'd expect the P2W crowd to be set back by a month at most before you start seeing all the BE/AAE/TSE weapons back into survival mode. Sure, their accounts will get banned once they dupe the new finds, but when accounts cost $15 and the weapons currently sell for $25+ each, it doesn't inhibit them much from taking a ban and transfering to an unsuspecting account. If you look on sites like G2G you'll still find all the weapons and armor they used to sell still up there. The only thing that's changed is the price. Their cost of doing business is higher, but they're still in business. 
---
I get the altruism, but realistically Bethesda took too long to close off the dupe market. It's already grown too much and will likely persist until the weapons naturally attrite out of the market. Most of the changes I think they could take to counter this would likely only create new revenue streams for the RMT crowd, not actually hinder them.
---
It's...never the same.
---
I've come so close and cancelled out many times.
---
I‚Äôve dry fired several weapons gotten them to break. In fact to mini guns just yesterday. 
---
My friend sold all his armor off his body bc he was in his power armor suit. I nearly did the same. But I always panic and back out. Double check I have the highest gear on.
---
 I wish we could rename our modded items or lock them. 
---
Yeah but to be as tanky as someone in PR I already need to spend 8 perk cards (maybe more), get the best armor, hope to get lucky with good perks and even then PR has mods that are inaccessible to normal armor wearers. Fine if I can't enter nuke zones, but where is my jet pack? Ya feel?
---
shhhhh
---
My CAMP used to dupe itself all the time whenever I moved it. I wasn't trying to do it, but it happened everytime I moved. Next thing you know you have 20 turrets, 60 foundations, and so on. I built a turret pilon once just for shits and giggles. It was pretty obvious it was too much for the server. Anyone within the same zone got a decent amount of lag, the turrets didn't even idle correctly, etc. I scrapped it down pretty quickly.
---
This is probably why they don't allow it and probably why they shouldn't.
---
What? You never seen a Deathclaw in a bar?
---
"RUUUUN AWAAAAAAAY! \*scream\* *every legendary super mutant*
---
so the complaint is that as the game goes on you get stronger and can kill stuff easier? I think that's just how games work man. it can't always be the same difficulty.
---
Did you go to your notes section and use the plan?
---
Learn the plan by clicking it.
---
Where is your camp located?
---
yeah I wasn't going to do one for the challenge of it but got frustrated and now i'm back to my lucky crit build from fallout 4. It's a beast with a suppressed hunting rifle. Most things die in one shot and no one knows where you killed them from.
---
You need to wait until you fully load in before accessing the pipboy
---
You have to exit the vendor and then go back into the menu and then everything you sold will be there
---
I mean,  just play the game until it's damaged enough til you can repair it...
---
if they would just make same items stack for gear it could also prevent this kind of thing, usually I accidentally sell shit because I'm clicking to sell or scrap 10 same things in a row, and I accidentally click one extra time or something.
---
I periodically have moved my camp after thoroughly exploring the region on the map. For example, started outside flatwoods on the river for water access and lower level enemies. Then moved North towards the toxic valley, but still camped by water. Then went South to the Ash Heap, and so on. This makes it easier to travel on foot and not have to use caps or at least spend less to explore and get xp for discovering locations. 
---
Vanguard armor is only good for PvE. You got killed by a PvP player using PvP gear. If you build a character for PvP, you stand a decent chance to survive PvP. If you build a character for PvE, you'll get destroyed. It's not broken if you purposely made yourself vulnerable.
---
Unfortunately I'm using the Chainsaw which is useless at anything below 150% condition.
---
At early lvls, we put down c.a.m.p.s between Morgantown &amp; Gorge Junkyard.  Plenty of low level enemies to farm for ammo, weapons(scrap, don't repair unless it's special) &amp; various junk.  
---
When I do move my c.a.m.p, I scrap most of it (keeping benches &amp; special items only)  &amp; then rebuild it in a different direction/pattern. I try to build each one differently.  If I can, I'll incorporate the available environment into my c.a.m.p builds. 
---
Of course, I try to remember this entire game is like a science experiment (and Bethesda is Vault-Tec, shhh, don't tell anyone that secret).  Sometimes things work great, other times it's a learning experience.  
---
By literally clicking read? Fuck
---
mine randomly jumps up instead of next one down sometimes
---
That doesn't make any sense. If they built the mat and trapped you in a room, that should mean they own the workshop. If the takeover was successful, you shouldn't be hostile anymore. I don't understand
---
My camp is located at the pond next to Pleasant Valley Station.  It is obviously a popular spot.  I do not understand why it doesn't check the server before logging on.  
---
Does that stupid prizebot actually do anything?  That things is a Nigerian prince for me.  Runs up and says I won but then just floats off.
---
There is a gym in either the Garrahan or Hornwright estate in the ash heap. 
---
I wouldn't mind just a bedroll, but I'm more of a fan of hardcore survival than what we currently have
---
Did you recieve the mutation as you died at some point? Its possible you have a bug where the server thinks you have the mutation when you dont. The only way ive found to fix it is to radaway until it gets cured.
---
I recently found a small shack built onto the back of a truck just wear of Camp David yesterday. It's in front of a small cliff.
---
Using it as a base, I was able to create a pretty respectable 4 building compound.
---
It's not exactly the safest, but it's been one of my more satisfying builds. 
---
How do you tell the damage on bloodied weapons at various health levels? Does it show a change in the pipboy somewhere? Mine seems to always display the same number on the weapon stats list in the weapons tab no matter what my health level is.
---
What if, and go with me here, you relegate pvp entirely to it's own server. 
---
There's practical concerns with fighting the queen outside of the nuke zones. You get less crashes/DCs when you're not in the nuke zone. It is a de facto exploit for unyielding/bloodied builds, but TBH it's pretty necessary given how unstable the queen fight already is. Not to mention that those high damage builds are pretty necessary to kill the queen. 
---
All three of the nuke silos have gyms with some weights. Otherwise Lucky Hole Mine for lead, Blackwater Mine for steel and Hemlock Holes for acid.
---
There are some great people out there, my funny little story starts with meeting a kid, maybe 15 years old, he stole my supply drop and became wanted, I said I will take the wanted away and you can keep the stuff, because if I don't someone else will. Well he resisted at first and I chased him all over the map the whole time shouting "C'mon just let me kill you, I won't take your stuff", I then notice a 70+ guy start following us, "look kid if I don't do it someone else will, this guy WILL take you down" he finally agrees as mr 70+ shows up, so I take the wanted off his head and watch his gear (not that I could really protect it as I was only 25), when he returns for his junk he invites me and Mr 70+ to a team, I accepted and so did Mr70+, now Mr70+ had his Mic on and I know he could hear every word as we chatted, I could hear background sounds and the occasional cough, but he never spoke a word. We play for a while but all too soon the kid has to head off for dinner and I was about to get dinner ready for my kids, just before I log off my kids run up asking for hot chocolate, so I am like yes yes yes ( I have 3)  I then turn to Mr 70+ and ask if he would like one? I got a chuckle out of him for that, and that made my day.
---
Yes, you go to the plan and click the x button on ps4, or the equivalent on whatever your playing on. No need to throw a tantrum.
---
Any can chimes.  There are three lining the front door of the ski resort on your way into the vendor.  Not the train vendor.
---
Wait until you fully load, jump around, make sure you can see your gun, move etc
---
It didn't make much sense to me either.
---
If you take a look at the SS I posted, you can see that the workshop was still in the process of being contested. 
---
I got killed, respawned at the workshop and was trapped in a box.
---
Even though i play alone mostly, would be cool to come to a player made settlement/community.
---
I found at lower levels having alot of purified water is both helpful and profitable. 
---
If you can snag a industrial water purifier plan, and build a few along one of the rivers, it's a nice set up. 
---
Actually, just south of death claw island is a junk node, I actually had my water farm there from around level 17-40. 
---
The only thing that spawns beside it are mole rats/a few scorched/a few ghouls. All lower levels. 
---
It's not the most ideal fast travel spot, but I'm level 58 now, and still have 150+ purified water and triple digits of must useful junk left over. 
---
I think you mistook my use of the word fuck as a tantrum towards you? Not the case
---
It should show right where the damage of your weapon usually is in your pip-boy. Use radiation to get your health down to 20% permanently (unless you heal it if course).
---
Since you're still a level 12 I would recommend placing your camp in the beginning area. There's a nice resource spot for junk off the shore of the giant river on the west side of the map. 
---
Just head west of vault 76 and follow the river north till you find the junk spot.
---
I'm not really a fan of any legendary gear, a lot of it feels really gimmicky and reminds me more of Borderlands. Some of the effects are cool like anti-armor, but a weapon that does extra damage to enemy X or does more damage when you are wounded seem ridiculous.
---
I feel like earlier Fallouts, while still being over-the-top in many ways were not so "video gamey" with their mechanics, the world had lots of crazy scifi stuff in it but still felt like a somewhat believable fictional world.
---
Nice bro and just heavy gunner , and Stabilized , it ignores their armor and you get more accuracy or dmg one of those , demo too but that‚Äôs poop now 
---
I think there is others but forgot 
---
Supposedly? 
---
The wastelanders content is supposed to have an entire main quest line, new factions etc...
---
They're nice. I'd recommend using the following ti max it out:
---
Heavy Gunner 3, 20%
---
Expert Heavy Gunner 3, 20%
---
Master Heavy Gunner 3, 20%
---
Bloody Mess 3, 15%
---
Nerd Rage, 20%
---
Demo Expert 5, 60%
---
Adrenaline 5, up to 60%
---
Adrenal Mutation
---
The people making stuff for the Atom Shop ("hurr durr, I never mentioned Atom Shop", you didn't need to, that's _literally_ the only place that new CAMP items are coming from) and the people designing quests are on different teams. This means even if new CAMP items (which people _must_ care about, otherwise they wouldn't keep coming out) were to stop being produced, the new quests and storyline content will still take the same time to produce. Stop being an entitled child and wait. Do you want quality, or more of the same?
---
So in fo76 you're married?
---
Yeah. What they said above. Gotta let the game completely load before doing anything. 
---
Hmmm okay thank you!
---
**M**assive Game(check), **M**ultiple Players on the same server at the same time(check), **O**nline(check) and **RPG**elements(check) =MMORPG.
---
Ok thank you!
---
Thank you!
---
Thank you. With all of the meds Inl have to take for my kidney transplant, I can barely remember any words or names when I want to use them anymore. 
---
Heavy gunner perks maxed add 30% each when maxed and theres 3 so that's 90% increase.
---
Then you can use demolition expert adds 60% when maxed to your explosive DMG.
---
You can add bloody mess to add 15% DMG and I think 9 or 12% body will explode into peace's.
---
There's q few perks u can add to help reload speed and fire rate.
---
Also as it's bloodied if your health is 20% or below it adds I think 50 or so % DMG as well.
---
Mutations will add dmg too just unsure of which atm.
---
But all that above you'll do a shit load of DMG with it 
---
Dude predicted it all and he only got two comments.  Seems about right.
---
Pewdiepie would like a word
---
Agreed. I got into a rut  the past two weeks where I was just logging in daily to do chores. I was getting bored of the game. Then I remembered the pile of treasure maps and requisition tapes I have and I figured I'd clean them up rather than give them away. It got me all over the map, exploring places I haven't been to yet or haven't been to in dozens of levels, and it was more fun than doing "high level" stuff even though I was getting some pretty lame loot (although  I did unlock a bunch of armor mods from scrapping so many armor pieces so that was nice).
---
I would upvote this a thousand times if I could.  In fo4, I was able to rename items and put an astrisk before its name so that it was easy to see if it was something I wanted to keep since the favorited heart symbol doesn't show in all contexts. But I'd much rather have the ability to lock items that I like rather than low-level/ crappy legendary items being locked. 
---
Nerds care about camp and stupid cosmetic .  I bet your a "role player" in the game. Play quests have fun and move on.. Go out on the real world once and awhile its more fun than milking a game for gayness
---
I would have put down a hundred flamingos to use up all the bulk steel I hoard unnecessarily every time I do a Uranium Fever run
---
This is my Fortune Savant build who has absolutely no offensive perks and 13 Luck
---
They aren't actually increasing the size of the CAMP budget. 
---
They are limiting how many of some things (turrets) you can build and reducing the budget cost of SOME items. Which will make some room for some people. 
---
If you have a Max budget camp with no turrets? I'm not expecting much space freed up. 
---
Did a team mate build it? Only you and party members should be able to build stuff. 
---
Wow thanks guys üòÅ atleast i know what to do with all perks needed 
---
You are a dork Cult of mothman. Ya let's have are screen name after a character in a video game. And im not entitled you liberal bernie Sanders follower I'm in college and pay my way
---
No team mates, I'm a solo player.
---
I'm wondering how soon after contesting can people build. I wanna say it was less than minute when I spawned back and into the box. 
---
In any case, I thought it was hilarious because I had forgotten all about the mat, but now I'm jealous and wish we could use them for camps.
---
I though most explosive energy weapons were been removed from legendary drops
---
Is that your only character?
---
That's what I've done with my anti racial sets (Exterminator, Ghoul Slayer, etc). Keep em in storage and keep that weight down. You'll need plenty of Cork tho. Golf balls!
---
Good to hear - have level 2 :)
---
I would suggest playing it as Fallout 76, and not Fallout 3, New Vegas, or 4.  If you absolutely need to make comparisons with another game whilst you play for whatever reason, treat it as a Fallout-themed Borderlands with more lore.
---
Graphically, it looks much better than Fallout 4.  If you don't like DOF then you can turn those off.  The vistas are stunning, but it's easy to look past it if you fixate yourself on the things that FO76 is not or what FO76 could have been, and if you already have the game then the only person missing out is you.
---
Well, after they contest, they still have to claim through another progress bar. They can't build until the claim progress bar completes and ownership transfers. Did you maybe contest it after they took it?
---
I take my excavator armor to lucky hole mine.  There's a bunch of lead veins there.  When you smelt it down to lead scrap, equip super duper and you'll be swimming in lead.  
---
Crap I‚Äôm part of those who drop it but I prefer to do the Excavation PA myself... however given I‚Äôve since slimmed down my build I don‚Äôt even need 220 carry weight so maybe it‚Äôs time to go PA-less... thanks for the insight.  Would help a lot when doing the silos!
---
Hmmmmmm, I haven't done that yet actually! I've seen the quest line, I'll hop to it. 
---
No, not at the current moment. The Enclave won‚Äôt adopt the policy to purge and rebuild society for another hundred years or so. I understand if you want to roleplay, but understand that it‚Äôs not in line with the current lore and whatever purges you do will be essentially inconsequential as Appalachia is doomed to fail. 
---
I am pretty sure it's because lore wise it only makes sense that other players can choose to harm other dwellers, thus incentivizing organized teams who will retaliate. The original classic in this genre (wow 1.0) had nailed the ultimate vision of this when there were epic southshore vs tarren mill battles that broke out because it would keep escalating beyond individual griefers. but wow never really went on to get this right with a gameplay system. they jsut kind of accidentally let the circumstance occur. they never fully understood what was great about it.
---
i hope to see 76 someday incorporate a cohesive system of karma and player groups such as factions, so there can be some layers of interaction when a player chooses to go outlaw or vigilante to oppose those outlaws. the bounty tag is a very proof of concept game mechanic much like the drop bag or the solo camp. there is a lot of potential, and I will continue chiming in feedback to help best thesda see these angles and grasp the totality of what it could be, to become greater than the predecessors in online RPG space.
---
There's a bunch above the flamethrower traps in that area as well. 
---
Throw some on and see what a difference it makes. 75 percent less damage for 5 pieces is huge
---
Yup I‚Äôm a weak ass bitch
---
I‚Äôd say read up on the different build types a bit and try to decide what you might want to build towards so you don‚Äôt waste too many perk options early on and have to move them later after level 50. 
---
Ffs. 
---
Not sure how you still don‚Äôt get it lmfao. Clearly you‚Äôve never bought drugs because everyone knows that in any transaction period you get the product before you hand over the money unless you know they‚Äôre trustworthy. If paying someone for a service/product before it‚Äôs rendered makes sense to you, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. Yup, there are assholes out there who will try to turn one on you, so don‚Äôt let your guard down. 
---
I've been trying to hoard energy weapons for this very patch.  But instead of getting my hands on some decent rolls on laser and plasma guns I ended up finding x2 two-shot Gatling Lasers from legendary protectrons in Watoga, when I already have a TSE Gatling Laser I bought off the Discord.
---
My favorite (non-ore location) is Pleasant Valley Ski Resort. There are six can traps to be found and lead weights too in a yellow box between them. 
---
If you are doing your 1400 cap run, the Charleston Fire Dept is good for Responders, and this place for the Raiders, so you can accomplish both goals at the same time.
---
The down side to this is that there are a bunch of mobs to fight through so if you like peace and quiet this is not likely the place to go...
---
I now personally prefer Hornwright Site #3 for my ammo needs as it has 7 lead veins and 9-10 iron veins right next to the red crane and there are no mobs and less walking than Lucky Hole.
---
You literally sold the shirt off your back.
---
I am a noobie aswell and would love people to play with...are you on Pc?
---
None of it makes sense. He refuses to acknowledge that there‚Äôs a trading menu that lets you view the price and object to it if you want. 
---
I wasn't able to do much since I was blocked in. I tried to respawn in again and I was still trapped, which it then clicked that I was deliberately trapped. It then clicked to go into build mode and remove/store the walls. That's when I noticed the mat. 
---
Unsure is respawning back in delayed them being able to claim it or of it just gave more time for me to protect it. 
---
By the time I got out and stuff the player that killed me was long gone.
---
Agility for sure. 
---
I'm nowhere near any sort of min/maxer, and I love to just play as a casual balanced player, but if you'd want to get stronger I'd go for Agility, and work on Vats perks too. 
---
I just like tearing through waves of enemies with my 3 star legendary mole gauntlet. Does more damage per hit, 40% swing speed reduction, and something else which I can't remember. 15 str with the 5melee INT perk and reducedmelee perk is plenty for me. 
---
I want Wastelanders to be human NPC's so much that my brain won't let me believe it's anything else.
---
Save and seek tick blood. Eventually you can make tons of stimpacks out of them. Ends up being 1 tick blood makes 8 diluted stimpacks.
---
There‚Äôs seven different vendor factions of which you can earn a max of 1400 caps per day
---
don‚Äôt spend caps on supplies, save them for equipment. Use the trading threads on Reddit for that.
---
Two handed melee is pretty much the strongest thing in the game. 40% faster swing speed is a must on legendary melee weapons.
---
Deposit your junk regularly and dying won‚Äôt be a big deal at all.
---
Oh. All this shit makes me feel like abusing infinite crits is okay. Its just abusing the game system same as this shit.
---
MINIGUNS ARE TRASH. I had done lots of pvp from beta to 2months after release. PvP works good, just people who play fallout are single-player base noobs. No offence, people you meet in this game just dont know how to play pvp. There is not single guy min-maxing pvp and showing it on youtube or so.
---
Yep. Makes me feel like infinite criticals bug is ok since its the same type of shit. A string of button presses for a more OP attack.
---
The Quantum tank. :D You are actually right about the immense grind required to sustain my build. Though walking around with 400+ or even close to 500 HP, with sufficient percentage amounts of damage reduction when my build is open PVP ready will certainly have its advantages, too. Anything squishy will likely be 1 shot stealth crit killed in ambush situations. Anyway, regardless of my sometimes aggressive replies towards you, I can also agree that there were some things to be learned from your replies. Though really, destroying armor parts repaired to double condition of invisible power armor support is certainly not done as quickly, or is there a method to break it quickly other than sustained explsoive weapon fire at it it that I am not aware of? Also, just out of curiosity, what makes you think my changes are so bad? It is not like they entirely break the features that I want to adjust and you yourself have stated that the percentage reduction of blocker is not enough to realistically provide the advantage it should provide against melee opponents, I believe it was you, who said that the best to go for is a reflect damage kill trade? So logically speaking, you should actually support this post and not argue against it so much. I feel like my major points are all still standing, there are ways to spam heal (as a team) to the point that no player can outpace it, melee is damage is broken if the best to hope for is to reflect damage back to your opponent and kill him as well and finally combinations of those things and invis or killer sentinel will make the overall PVP experience even more broken. So why not support potential changes to at least make it less broken?
---
I still dont understand why you "unequip" and lose the benefits of your armor when you get into power armor. I mean it shows you step into the power armor fully dressed, I really wish you'd still get the perks of whatever legendary armor you have on while wearing power armor. But that has nothing to do with this post
---
5 - controls UI/customization/responsiveness so there is a cohesive system for players to access their chosen items, weaponry, supplies, armor in live combat (and outfits / decorations / perks / ETC - non live combat items and gear can benefit from this also) that is usable and clean and not bloated / glitchy / slow.
---
6 - perk system and bobbles / mags streamlining and finishing
---
A - Storing cards that you don't need to be shuffling through every single time you want to make a swap
---
B - Upgrading auto awards the next level card instead of requiring the extra screen of combining cards, eliminating the duplicate card bloat from the system
---
C - Bobble and Mags, new tab in perks, as these should become cards so they can be accessed easily as part of a player build, with only 2-3 slots for active equip and appropriate cooldowns on their usage, allowing these to become interesting parts of the build system and live combat experience and the choice between utility and clutch skills for winning a fight or escaping a situation that turned dangerous out of nowhere
---
7- Drop bags / death bags and general container improvement and finishing, the errors these basic bags have and their limitations in usage I feel are a major area that needs to be finished so we can enjoy the new game modes and content coming. Containers could serve a variety of purposes, and it is promising to see a backpack in the works, but what could really shine would be a container that facilitates bartering, or supply giveaway, or excess item buffer, along with treasure caches / special delivery able to be left in camps for other players in lieu of a lore nonsensical mailing system. containers need to be finished and improved
---
8- system for karma and player groups that persist, so that player choices will really mean something when it comes to interaction with the other players, the finding of friendlies to help or hostiles to oppose. bounty tag is kind of a proof of concept, as is the solo camp. i want to see a finished system that brings this game into the fold as a multiplayer online game.
---
Pharma Farmer is your friend. 
---
I made this complaint waaaay back when and some dipshit kept saying i didnt understand how random chance worked. 
---
Yea its a latency issue.
---
Naughty Nurse Build? Tell me more about this Naughty Nurse Build. 
---
this is an issue that bobble / mag enhancement could solve. there could be one of these equippable to grant you the counter to stealth and sneak, if you valued that for your build it would be a cooldown of some kind or special passive which you are sacrificing other cooldowns tactically to employ
---
What bothers me most is that people have been asking for this feature since November and it hasn't been added yet
---
System?
---
Scrap weapons and armor you aren't going to use for plans. Sell alcohol and drugs for caps instead.
---
Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage (+ demolitions) + any other big guns perks as you see fit if OP wants to improve the gatling to the max, ie a full bloodied build (which he says he isn't interested in).
---
I don't have a bloodied build either but I do have adrenal reaction and nerd rage since there really aren't any major downsides to having them on you (if anything, it works well as an emergency Plan B).  The only thing is that if you have low LCK (like me), then you may have to waste 2 points in LCK for starched genes when you could put the two points into bloody mess to get a flat 10% damage buff across the board.
---
You had something bad.
---
So is my microphone junk? Or do you not chat?
---
Honestly I bought a headset three days ago and nobody has ever talked to me.
---
Nice to see a fellow Redditor in game.
---
Now that you can see my dirty history, be well!
---
It happens to me too, it's very strange lol
---
Fast travel away from the defense quest and only do the retake quest. You only have 1 wave at that point. There is the danger mobs will wreak your workshop if someone walks near it. Otherwise enemy AI just waits for you.
---
 I logged in today in the middle of a 4 wave defense quest. The owner was level 250 or so. Killed him, picked up over 100lbs of scrap. Why people think it is a good idea to carry that much in a PVP zone baffles me. I have made taken 400lbs of scrap since yesterday hunting people in workshops. I guess people hoard so much crap that they have to carry it on their person because their stash must be perma-full.
---
There really is a bright side to this update
---
Don't  shy away from events. They are very good at getting xp as well as plans, armor, aids, etc.
---
This a Gatling gun not The plasma one 
---
Lol...I'm just hoping that whatever their reasons are won't get me banned or suspended...
---
Ah ok, well nice find
---
Or it could be that your gunsmith perk isn't leveled.
---
We (those who don't mind the PvP hazards of the wasteland) have to enable it in crowded fights with the SBQ to avoid explosives and stray automatic fire accidentally starting PvP.
---
However, I suppose changing it's functionaloty to bubble wrap players and stop them taking damage won't affect our use of it during SBQ (andbother boss fights).

I'm sure it's not malicious 
---
Or what they should do instead of camps create clans/factions and be bale to build them own forts/towns instead of 4 diff houses.
---
"Congratulations .... congratulations .... " lol.  I think I might have gotten an actual prize once, maybe some caps?  But usually it's a certificate. 
---
Because game should spawn new servers when player number passes a certain threshold not 3billion one-man servers for everyone who wants one particular spot. 
---
You on xbox? I know it's not YOUR All-Rise. But you can have mine.
---
Yeah I know....just wondering why it is. Don't  have any friends that play, just with people I meet.

I want to point out that the red marker is not always there, it has a range limitation, which gvies you at most 2 seconds and at worst no time at all to react to approaching invis melee. That is related to the speed of the moving target, as different builds achieve different speeds, your reaction time to actually spot the red marker and connection. VATS teleportations frequently occur when fighting a player with a bad connection, which apparently never happened to you. The Fallout 76 servers are not quite perfect to handle fast paced PVP fights and lag. Of course, when you stand still and test it in VATS, ranges will often appear shorter than what actual combat looks like, especially if other players do not have the ideal connection. 15 feet is probably less than a safe distance to keep towards a melee opponent, though ideally they should never get that close to begin with, as you are already in CQC at that point and should be building distance again to safely initiate staggering fire. My point that the melee player has the way easier job to just get close and spam VATS still stands by the way. Getting close is easiert with invis, you can not really argue against that and it is also another supporting factor for the large percente of melee builds in PVP.
---
I found a "Large Deathclaw Gauntlet" it wasn't legendary or anything and I thought it was neat. Accidentally scrapped it when mass scrapping after Uranium Fever. I felt oof. 
---
Nice tip, thanks!
---
Just a pointer, you can stack grape mentats, beer, and sweet roll, as well as lvl 3 hard bargain of course. With a CHR of only 4, I need the sweet rolls to get 2 caps vs 1 for asbestos, circuitry, etc, and 3 caps vs 2 for crystal, fiber optics, etc.  At least a sweet roll lasts 90 minutes so you have time to hit every trading post with a single roll.
---
Lower your resolution.
---
I'm hoping that in the future there is legendary power armor and that is the reason why armor unequips in the future they don't want double vanguard or double bloodied builds. It's easier to deal with us complaining about it now and add legendary PA later than it is to take away equipped armor if/when that happens. At least that's my hope and logic.
---
I found mine in a container in the kitchen of the Whitesprings bunker.
---
What, platform? 
---
I think it s not that way. Soups stack for example and you see the timer of the soup which has the highest timer but the fewest timers stay the same. You just only dont see them. Pay attention but Im half certainly sure that youre half empty timer soup become spoil before youre full timer one even if they stack and show the full timer one only
---
I've seen it become a meat pile,  disappear,  flop around on the ground permanently,  and just die like normal. 
---
and what about adrenal reaction fix???
---
 It's Meatpiled enough to where a member of our group has become known for his meat pile hunting skills
---
The Appalacians are like that though. The only thing in the game involving alcohol that I find really unrealistic is that none of the fire houses have a bar room built into the back (because IRL they ALL do here).
---
This isn't the full patch notes.
---
would it not make sense that this goat lookin man would be a male or Ram varient of Sheepsquatch?
---
Nope   not mutated and was playing alone :(
---
I actually did this all the way to level fifty and it's honestly perfectly playable. You're not gonna one shot a scorchbeast but who cares, you didn't waste time and energy fretting over special point placement
---
Instigating executioner berserker sniper rifle.
---
yep! just tried this myself seems to work that way. 
---
Ps4
---
The Bobble and Mag slot you suggest is actually a so much better mechanic than what we have right now. It would complement builds and provide incentives to collect all of them, without becoming a broken or exploitable mechanic. It would also be a lot closer to what they used to work like in older Fallouts, at least if I understand your idea correctly.
---
Ok no problem.
---
Good luck. 
---
Nope just looked.
---
See, i feel like the mirv has a flaw where it doesnt do much damage. Unlike one normal shell. Should be re worked
---
Yeah building defenetly need more defense so we have time to react.
---
That‚Äôs good advice that exactly what happens to me. Except I don‚Äôt carry junk on me at all. I didn‚Äôt loose anything but my level worth of caps and time but it‚Äôs very upsetting. I know it‚Äôs a pvp zone and I‚Äôm all down for pvp but when it‚Äôs fair and fun. I was at a huge disadvantage with having my camp building perks on doing no damage and then being one hit with a DCG. I just server hopped but at least give me a good chance to defend myself and to have a fun and engaging encounter. 
---
Yo throw a shredded mod on it and see if the melee shred procs the explosive. For science
---
personally I think the SBQ fight should be automatically pacifist across the board
---
Not even with one of those?
---
+10 % energy damage is an insult.
---
Damn, that's a great drop, gz! I'd gladly buy it from you (or trade for smth else) if you don't really feel like using it extensively. I myself got atse one but that would really be a good upgrade. Haven't seen anything like this during my 430 hours of gameplay...
---
Just recently retired my hunting rifle. Once I got a lever action I stopped using it. As for your original question. I've never seen a lever action higher than lvl 45. 
---
Looks like a tyrant to me 
---
I'm level 42 or so. 
---
Heavy Gunner perks add 20% each, so that's 60%
---
The Martial artist perk bug was patched and no longer works.
---
I am just under level 10 and not far at all into the missions. I wouldn't mind playing with you, you aren't too ahead of me
---
I have a legendary Grognak with Mutant +10% and *40% power attack damage 
---
I only have like one good legendary but i can't really use it cause it barely does any damage to high level enemied and i have little to no ammo for it. I have that 10mm smg that sets enemies on fire
---
&gt;is there a method to break it quickly other than sustained explsoive weapon fire at it it that I am not aware of?
---
Generally it's just anything with a high amount of damage and armor pen. Powerfists are good, pole hooks, regular sledgehammers, guns with armor pen mags, etc. 
---
&gt;Also, just out of curiosity, what makes you think my changes are so bad? ... you yourself have stated that the percentage reduction of blocker is not enough to realistically provide the advantage it should provide against melee opponents, I believe it was you, who said that the best to go for is a reflect damage kill trade?
---
I don't think blocker is sufficient enough for bloodied+unyielding melee builds but I think that's something with so much vulnerability that it doesn't need to be nerfed. I agreed blocker needed a buff, but as an offensive build I don't think there's enough points that you can spec into it that makes them survivable when stealth boyed with *my build*. This is pretty much a vulnerability I chose, so my only recourse when I encounter these builds is to rely on gamma guns, rad explosives, tesla rifles, and reflect weapons. Any decent shotgun or heavy weapons build is better equipped to handle these players so I usually kite them to those builds when I work in a team. Solo I don't have many options. But my vulnerabilities are my problems. Just because I can't win that fight doesn't mean the game is broken. I also have a chosen vulnerability to crippling which I chose because I can spam healing salves to sustain it. Healing salves function the same way stimpacks do when you're wearing PA - no use animation, heals limbs, etc. 
---
As an aisde, healing salves also benefit from the same perks stimpacks do, so you can probably do a lesser version of what you're currently do outside of PA (plus wear assassin+sent stuff) and have more personal survivability at the cost of team survivability. 
---
Plus, I think you're missing that there's a chance to drop aid items. Stealth boys are aid items. This is going to make stealth boy spamming and spam healing much less viable over time. Probably not within the first two weeks, but after that people are going to have dedicated farm time that takes them out of survival or will have to pivot. 
---
Chameleon armor directly negates sentinel, so you can't have both sentinel and chameleon active at the same time. Crouching is not standing and not moving. You have to free aim/hip fire at these types of enemies, but they're much more squishy. With the stealth boy mod on PA you have the things I've already mentioned. I don't think AP loss is a good enough cost because it's just too easy to pay more resources to sustain the build. You could use nuka cherries, honey, honeycomb, sunshine oil, or stack enough AP regen perks (lone wanderer, rejuvenated, etc).
---
Assassin+sent is in the same boat since it has a glaring vulnerability. You could make it cost AP, but again there's plenty of ways to make that moot with AP regen/restore. Further, sentinel/assassin doesn't apply to radition damage, poison damage, and other damage types. For me, sentinels are invulnerable until I get to target, but once I'm on target it's easy to defeat on account of better criticals. There is one exploit to make it even more survivable, but I haven't tested it myself and I think there's still one counter to it. 
---
If anything, I think you should be able to VATS target people that are crouched (not chameleon, just crouched) if you take a berry mentat. If you did it that way, that'd be an effective counter if someone with chameleon repositioned themselves. Once you have VATS lock, it stays even if they stealth out, so that split second when human chameleon turrets reposition themselves should be made their Achilles heel. This is much like the suggestion someone else made about marking people with a recon scope, so it's just adding another counter on top of what's already there. It's a subtle change, but it's much less restrictive. Recon scopes eat AP more than reflex sights, and further this extends the vulnerability to anyone with a berry mentat that might not have a recon scope option.
---
Likewise, I think sentinel and chameleon shouldn't be active if you jump in place. It's a good way to skip out on AoE damage, but it goes against the intent of the legendary effects. 
---
Every time I've seen something I thought was broken, I just continued using that play style until another PvP team used the appropriate counter. 9 times out of 10, the counter is using another mechanic. It usually isn't very situational and can usually be countered reliably. The ones that are harder to counter are the ones that can't be replicated without using crazy exploits or dedicated resouce farming (nuka quantums, nuka grapes, etc). That seems to be the general trend with PvP though. Whatever you can't achieve via your build can be made up for by throwing resources at it. Kinda like how you don't need class freak if you just drink your serum mutations every hour.
---
The ability to mark items as junk would be the better solution.  Then you have a "scrap all junk" option.  The division does this and its amazing.
---
Oh thanks for correcting me I thought it was 30% each üòâ
---
Patch 7 should help out with it as well hopefully.
---
Any legendary metal armor? 
---
Yeah
---
Will pay good caps for 3* vanguard metal armor 
---
I have 2 executioner leg items but neither is a sniper.
---
So, from what I've learned....if u leave it as a mirv, u have to shoot it in a high arc, ABOVE the stuff, and if you want to use it like a normal fat man, remove the mirv mod. (Others will likely have more detailed advice on this)
---
We just kill her.  If you need an easier battle,  do the corner launch,  and she'll spawn in and fly straight to the area that isn't irradiated
---
I have random armor and some are metal.
---
I do scrap weapons and armor but most of the time my enemies drop weapons i can't use cause of level issues or no ammo left.
---
I also have weight reducing perks but for some reason i am almost always overencumbered despite having only the essentials. I didn't know about ammosmith and lead farming. Thank you very much, i usually just took over the ammo workbench on the north of the map.
---
Lmk wat u got 
---
I guess I'll have to try this and see for myself.
---
Oh gosh that's so frustrating :(
---
The best fights I've seen is when she gets held on the ground and the melee and powered up heavy gun users can lay into her.
---
All it takes is for the riflemen and shotgunners to keep her grounded by constantly focusing on her wings and keeping the mobs off the melee and heavy gunners. 
---
I run Tormentor myself, I can keep her on the ground almost 80%-90% of the fight. If there's at least one other person running a crippling build, she might stay on the ground for the whole time after the initial heal.
---
*horrible ESO flashbacks*
---
In your mother's butt. Haha, for real though, make sure you have a water source to build large purifiers in.
---
Mirv = think an "umbrella factor" so need to shoot above the targets? Someone will likely come along &amp; be more helpful
---
Vangaurd metal chest peice 2*
---
Vangaurd trapper right arm 1*
---
Vangaurd trapper right arm 3*
---
Thank you very much this was really informative! I only have one problem. After finishing a quest i got that purple power armor for level 50 and i can't put the pieces on the frame and pick up the frame so they just weigh a lot in my camp. Any help?
---
How I tested:  
---
I had a stack of 20 BlackBerry Juice, half way to spoil.  
---
I dropped the stack, crafted 1 new BlackBerry Juice, picked up stack.  
---
I then drank a few, spoil meter stayed full.
---
Thank you very much, unfortunately i am on pc. I'll givr my username later as i am not home now and don't remember it lol
---
Thanks a lot man that looks really similar to some of my perks!
---
I know the feeling... its hard to be low level in the game if you stick close to.vault 76 to grind out some levels and pick up all weapons and scrap them often you'll get decent mods. Take over workshops and just defend all day with that you'll get plans guns armor stimpaks plus loads of xp. If I wasnt on vacation id help you out. If u still need help in 2 weeks hit me up. Also crouch every where and snipe things or pass a fight up
---
What system is everyone getting griefed on so much? I barely run into griefers on PC. I think the last time someone griefed me was before they nerfed two shot, explosives, banned all the dupers, and removed the crazy amount of duped items (Probably in January) And that person stopped griefing after a minute from boredom. Everyone I've seen the past few weeks since I started playing again have either kept to themselves or at least been friendly. I thought all the douchebag griefers left with their banned asshole duping buddies
---
What console are you on maybe we can learn together and make use of the charisma perks
---
Uh why does it matter? 
---
yes, but the actual name of the cryptid is Sheepsquatch, or White Things. Technically it is Goat - Man, but Bethesda will refer to it as Sheepsquatch 
---
This is happening to me more and more. I play PlayStation by the way. People come to my camp in groups tear down my camp forcing me to fight them which one against two or one against three isn‚Äôt fair I always have to change servers happens at least three times a week. 
---
Wrong subreddit, and overcharging too lol.
---
nvm, it was a marriage joke that was poorly executed
---
Understood but pay attention if, even spoil stay full for all the stack, some spoil is created before the others of the entire stack.  
---
I'll do just as you said, thanks! One question, where could one *acquire* a suit of excavator power armor. I haven't explored the ash heap a lot but i have a feeling it's there somewhere
---
A simple confirmation box would do, 2 minutes work. I‚Äôd be up for that.
---
I‚Äôll look into Tormentor. I‚Äôve been using a Two Shot Gatling for when she lands, Executioner‚Äôs Tesla for the mobs, and a 3* Executioner‚Äôs Multi Axe as my melee. I might need to switch up some perks to include the Luck stagger perk for the Gatling gun. 
---
I'm on PC. Tbh i was really really frustrated with having to run from 3 scorchbeasts and die 3 time just to finish one quest.
---
The crown costume in the shop is definitely cleaner. That is the only question I can answer.
---
I hope other answers are here soon.
---
Explosive component is 20%. So 5/5 demo would add 12%, or 3% per point. Pretty garbage for a 5 perk investment, but if you're using other explosive then I guess it's OK. 
---
Much appreciated!
---
It seems like it would be a bit awkward to put into the game as a whole honestly, but I'd at least hope for the ability to make it so others can put their camp beside yours.
---
As soon as i get home i'll take some pics of my perks, put it on this thread and tag you. Thanks for the advice!
---
I have a safe room schematic I build first every workshop I plan on using. It protects my fast travel mat and has several windows I can third person view out of in the event of PVP. Lock the doors and anyone responding to the defend quest will be trapped in the safe room.
---
It also helps if you build while crouched. Being crouched will hide your location on the map buying you more time to capture and build. It also makes it harder for vats users to instant kill you.
---
Sure thing, I was actually really looking forward to the ash heap and the savage divide but the main quest barely touched on them
---
Understood, that is fair.  
---
But aside from the water and resource nodes.  Like locking a door that leads to crafting stations and such.
---
If they take any crops, they become wanted.  (I know thats not a fair deterant)
---
Locks on Water nodes will make them wanted as well.
---
In my opinion, the game does not go far enough, it should completely block the ability of anyone else being able to pick locks on camps and take crops.   Its really a failed system of PVP already anyway.
---
So I do get what you are saying and just wondered if there was another reason to lock the entire camp.
---
XB, PS4 or PC?  You can have mine.
---
I think major changes will be unlikely. Fallout 76 PVP basically is what it is, niche. Survival which could have provided tengible changes to create a clear and balanced open PVP mode, will not do that. Instead, we can at least hope, that survival will teach existing and newly joining PVPers a lesson. Existing PVP players, including myself, have all embraced the current Meta in one way or the other, though the acceptance and degree of embrace towards the poorer part of PVP mechanics is apparently very varied. I personally want to see the game improve and to regain some players that quit, while also attracting new players through things Fallout 76 has to offer, which definitely includes both RPG and Shooter elemnts. Both need to work in the right combination, in order to make PVP in this game interesting. I do very much agree with you that VATS Crit Auto Aim as a dominant way of gunfighting and mindless invis as the dominant solution to avoid being seen and to counter VATS do not take much skill or thought to use, while they sadly also undermine shooter elements. I personally would not mind VATS and Crits being reworked, so that it would still act as a seperate mode to gunfighting which can be activated, but one which you need to operate and aim yourself without RNG hit chances, with Crits filling up upon manually aimed hits and released as auto aimed shots with guaranteed high damage output. This removes the need for invis to Counter VATS, puts more emphasis on aiming yourself and retains the viability and damage output of VATS builds. Those will then also take some effort to use, so that a person can not outgun another person exclusively due to the build, though the build will still remain important for burst damage. Perection remains viable for the compass, Ap remains viable as using the VATS mode would drain some AP, though less than right now, as the auto aim is removed. Even legendary gear would remain decently strong and desireable but much more balanced.
---
But that is not going to happen, as Bethesda knows all to well that for many players of this game and this series, VATS is a core function to assist in using harder to aim weapons, which take reasonably more effort to master with conventional shooter mechanics. That¬¥s part of the appeal of VATS sniping or handcannon builds, very high damage and masterful shots, without having to master anything really.
---
It is almost ironic, VATS was introduced as a mechanic to make shooter gameplay in Fallout more accessible (and bearable back in FO3 on consoles really) and it is now hindering the game to progress in its further developed and reworked online shooter mechanics. It is obvious that any given solution to the VATS issue would upset some people, tough luck Bethesda. Pun intended.
---
A full set of sentinel/cavalier or even just assassin's is enough to make you as tank as PA.
---
PA users are major squishies in pvp and is out classed by on full set of anything, and then you can get 2 other legendary perks and still mod your pieces(shadow/pocketed/cushioned/biochem mesh/ ext)
---
The arrow seems to be related to perception. That's tends to be why I wear the tattered dress outfit (+1 perception), eat wolf ribs (+2 perception), take a berry mentat (+5 perception). It's further limited if the target crouches. That's enough at my base perception of 1 that I see target arrows pretty far out. 
---
As for the teleportation, no I don't get that. But if it's related to connection, it's not that the game's mechanics are broken. Lag spikes suck regardless of the type of opponent you're fighting. Yeah, bethesda should work on that, but I don't know how melee becomes a scapegoat for that. 
---
The fact of the matter is melee with stealth boys are the best response to rifles and rifles are the next most popular build. That's why it's so pervasive. I could re-hash the same counters again or you can read my previous comments. I have just as hard enough of a time countering it with my build, but that's why I lean on teammates that are an appropriate counter to them. There is no solo build that can own the map and the game pushes you to figure that out and team up to mask your vulnerabilities. If you can't take these types of opponents with your build, you need to team up with someone that can. If nobody on your team can counter it, someone needs to step up and do what's best for the team. 
---
I think you should try whining a little less until you see how it goes. It's not going to be some battle royale constantly. I can't speak for everyone, but I know I will play survivor and do missions and enjoy the added challenge. If someone wants to spam stims and needs to just to get a kill, that isn't viable. Melee won't be the meta in survivor when you have ranged weapons that can take out a player before they close the distance. If a player just wants to stand there and be invincible, I'm just going to run away and move on. If a player wants to camp somewhere cloaked that sounds really dull.
---
What I'm really looking forward to in survivor is the added tension and how it will affect playstyle. Will white spring be a hub still if it's so dangerous? Will players always attack in certain zones, or will rules of etiquette naturally emerge when vending is implemented? I see a lot of interesting possibilities here beyond raking my brain over possible pitfalls.
---
Collect junk. 
---
Springs, screws, adhesive, gears and ballistic Fibre. 
---
They're the common ones.
---
How about you increase the base damage of explosives while you're at it. You nerfed Demolitions Expert (for no good reason). It's always been 100% more damage at 5 points. 60% sucks. Now my auto grenade launcher eats up grenades like crazy just to kill things. On top of that it breaks crazy fast (even at 200% durability from Weapon Artisan). Nerfing the requirements for crafting the ammo is NOT THE SOLUTION!
---
I am part of a group that started its assembly here on Reddit.
---
Last week we put a call out for a nuke drop at a specific time.
---
I have never had more names I recognized fill the screen for a queen fight. It was amazing and crazy and we are talking about doing it again in the next few days...
---
We had a base on site and such a range of players.... knowing everyone was gathered for the queen was fantastic.
---
We are here, new people are joining. It can be fun.  (Xbox player)
---
My instigating gatling went missing :( I know I didn't sell it or drop it. Hopefully it's just a glitch. 
---
I was thinking the slow turn around by the dude caught by the raiders felt bad, and then saw it's captured on PS4. Makes sense haha
---
The shop items are the clean versions of the in game items.
---
Same with me and my level 320. He's never gonna leave PvE servers
---
They‚Äôve come out with a couple different armor paints but of course you have to buy them through the atom shop. I doubt they‚Äôll ever include them for free cause they know everyone will buy it anyways. 
---
Platform? Maybe they fought in an event with you and really just want to add friends?
---
r/market76
---
animation canceling back in oldschool dota  was more of a microing technique than an exploit 
---
Ah, thats the one instance where it would def penalize you from leaving the server right away.
---
But you do realize what it looked like to the 300 something? A Level 23 could have been someones main with very little ability to actually damage the queen.   I realize one could twink the alt and align all existing perks to focus damage on particular weapon, but there are still limits that a level 23 could do.  Like the weapon would be forced to a much lower level and the damage max would be much lower.  Thus a level 23 just showing up scaled up the HP/Damage resist on the queen and perhaps the amount of damage you could do would not equate to the higher difficulty now.   
---
I did actually scrap my bos jumpsuit.. I had been playing all day and was very tired, I could of kicked off but somehow I just laughed. 
---
I now have a bos hood which I‚Äôm scared of scrapping as it‚Äôs right at the top of the list too. 
---
I now carry an item beginning with A so in theory, it would be scrapped by accident first, I think it‚Äôs an assault gas mask. 
---
If they make it so you can only place vending machines at workshop.  The image shows the vending machine at the workshop.   It does not show it at the camp.   Like fast travel mats are available only at workshops, perhaps they intend to do the same with the vending machines.
---
Hmm, never really thought about legendary ones.   +1 perception would be awesome.  Or ones with +sighted accuracy, or + hipfire accuracy.   Does not have to be a huge bonus.  A good variety of little legendary stats like that would make them fun to mess around with.  Perhaps make it so they only attach to "helmets" and not normal hats.   Marine Helmet, Combat armor helmet, perhaps even just a bucket with holes cut in it to see out of.   Then what you have made is legendary helmets as well.    Right now the helmets really serve no purpose. 
---
A safe house is a good idea for the fast travel mat. Will they get a bounty if they pick the safe house door lock while they are attacking/ capturing it? I know once you start the capture you can shoot turrets and destroy stuff and not get a bounty. Wouldn‚Äôt people just shoot the wall down when locked inside. Or is this primarily to lock people inside during the defense event. Giving you time to fast travel away? I don‚Äôt know any of the tips and tricks around pvp I normally play solo or with a few friends. 
---
I have three builds, so really I just gave you the highlights that most builds share. My build works for me because of my equipment. My build probably won't work for you off the bat. It's usually better to plan your build around gear you have or know you can get easily. I'd just play around on a [build planner](https://nukesdragons.com/) and think around that. Once you have something set, find a PvP community (discord or something) and ask for input.
---
You unlocked the BOS skin for the combat helmet, just so you know
---
This is my sexy red dress with faschnacht mask build...
---
The dress also comes with black fuck me pumps. Just sayin'
---
Adrenal reaction, bird bones, eagle eyes, marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon.
---
Where in this subreddit does it say you can't sell/trade?
---
Vats taught me that with my first shot.  I forget to mention I used my critical too.
---
I switched to a 3* two shot fatman I got from a bloodbug in the mire, I *did* notice its listed stat was higher damage than the mirv listed, I assumed the mirv did more based on a x4 multiplier.
---
Well, my 2 shot fatman did more damage than the mirv.
---
And thanks to a random player dropping 31 mini nukes in the blue suitcase at Watoga Station I tested these fatmen on the deathclaw north of watoga and tried to test on the mirelurk queen south of watoga.
---
Deathclaw took about a tenth of it's total health.  But for some bloody reason my nukes were detonating midflight right in my face whenever I fired at the mirelurk queen.  10 deaths later I just moved on to robot killing.  Good news is both fatmen one shot lvl 50 watoga robots.  Neither one shot lvl 50 glowing mirelurk kings.
---
However they do a great amount of limb damage and found out you can completely immobilize kings by crippling both feet.
---
It was all summed up with a mirelurk hatchling whom WOULD NOT DIE, ran into the invincible bug glitch I guess.
---
So I used up all my mini nukes then did a quick fort defiance run and ran into an invincible glowing radroach.
---
Gotta love this game lol.
---
That usually tells me I‚Äôve picked a popular spot and should think about another location. I do agree however, that would be a useful feature but I think it‚Äôll probably be the case that the game can not determine camp status until you have actually connected to a server already.
---
Agreed, either that or it needs a serious base stat damage buff cause for being mini nukes, they hit like fireworks.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox! If you are too I‚Äôm happy to team up :)
---
If you read my post, I do NOT want the weight reduce  of HEAVY weapons reduced. The perk changes is for people who want to decrease the weight 
---
Damn I‚Äôve just seen you‚Äôre on pc üò¢
---
I started going there in my early 40s and all I got was low level ghouls and lvl15 legendaries. Just stay away from the clubhouse, as that is where you will be overrun. If you sneak you should be able to kill the ghouls one at a time. For the most part :)

You should have been supplied a reference number or ticket number, try quoting that in an email to support. Or asking the support team on Twitter, they can usually help if not point you in the right direction.
---
That is a bit unfortunate but dw i'm sure there are many people on xbox that are in your situation
---
Its not arrogance.  Not trying to troll or enflame or anger.   Many people always claim one-shot kills, but there are several videos created on youtube that try and recreate the circumstances of the 1 shot kill and it never works.  So far there has not been a single video posted that actually shows this.   So its not arrogance but its disbelief actually.  
---
So what your describing is an exploit coupled with a trade window?  A pair of players planned it because of knowledge of the exploit?  So Instigator and Clown lure a victim to begin trading, then clown hits Instigator causing the victim to immediately cancel trading and then Instigator 1 shots the victim.   
---
I'm just dubious this would work without seeing it actually happen. No one has ever posted a video showing any 1 hit death.
---
I think the trading subreddit will just have to change slightly to reflect the presence of the vending capabilities. Now you can direct people to your camp to let them purchase things directly. I imagine the subs will still be useful for straight trades though.
---
To explain the joke they were trying to make they're referencing the unstable relationship status stereotypically assigned to married couples which would result in them living in separate houses.
---
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding what exactly you're saying.  Are you saying they're going to nerf aa and bloodied legendary effects with this next patch or you *think* they are??
---
I have all my crops and water inside now, 15 of each crop, 8 small purifiers, 2 ind purifiers (locked outside),turrets on the inside for the mobs that spawn in my base when i fast travel there (occasionally), an iron extractor outside. Everything is locked and all run by the 100 power generator. I'm super happy with it all. Will sell excess adhesive and water. To whoever said you get wanted from picking crops, you don't. I steal them whenever i see them lol.
---
Well I never said we were married. People have boyfriends/girlfriends and they don‚Äôt live together lol. 
---
After having accidentally scrapped the BoS leather flight jacket, a fully upgraded vault suit, the scribe hat, etc. I very much agree. I have even accidentally scrapped my power armor, but thankfully it only scrapped the frame and not the pieces on it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs cool, I‚Äôm happy to wander round on my own anyway but would be cool to play with someone who was in the same situation! Good luck :)
---
I claim zero inside knowledge of what‚Äôs coming with patch 7 or after, I‚Äôm saying the first wave of mass duped items was TSE and we all saw the results.  Could be Beth will be less reactionary this time; your guess is as good as mine.
---
I wondered this last night I‚Äôve found the space suit in game and my BF bought it from the atomic shop and they are exactly the same.  We‚Äôre on different accounts so it‚Äôs not like him buying it unlocked it for me. Because of this buying costumes seems like a waste of atoms to me. Surely they should be atomic shop exclusives 
---
I've found if I start without my headset but then plug it in once the game is running, I get general game noise from my TV but voice chat comes through the headset.
---
I'm guessing that it's a left over from FO4 where paint jobs had effects and there were legendary PA.
---
I mean, have you played a game made by bethesda before?
---
Lucky hole mine in excavator PA.
---
you'll have more than you know what to do with.
---
Hornwright test site for steel. (Comes from iron ore) 
---
Well, if you can't use weapons you find, it's that much more reason to scrap them so that you can learn from them how to make better use of weapons you CAN use! 
---
Here's one of my favourite tricks when it comes to lead farming. [Look at this shot of Camden Park. See those two chains of tin cans dangling from the entryway to the roller coaster there?](https://cdn1-www.playstationlifestyle.net/assets/uploads/gallery/fallout-76-camden-park/widow-maker.png) Those are like nine tin cans each. There are a LOAD of them in Camden Park. Collect them all and scrap them, and you'll have dozens of units of lead, from which you can craft a bunch of ammo, especially if you have that ammosmith perk. Always keep an eye out for these tin can chains. They're a fantastic source of scrap for making ammo. 
---
So to sate my own curiosity about this earlier tonight I did the 'stay on world option' just to see what the person built. 
---
Turns out that currently the system seems to be a bit too 'sensitive' about locations. As the spot I built was on the opposite side of a lake from this guy's camp. Not to mention there was enough free space that you could put a camp between our houses. 
---
I assume the setting is using the old larger radius that was between camps than the newer one. But either way it's frustrating to say the least, especially if you stay on the world and look at where the houses are just to see.
---
So you do not mind fighting 20 minutes for the Armaments Event, killing all those Armor Piercing Gutsy, using all those stims and bullets... Then another player shows up at the end and 1 shots the legendary?   All because you might have been fighting 2-3 of the other gutsy at that moment?
---
Rio meme
---
Yes, all the damage increases are multiplicative.  That is why the Two Shot is so powerful even now with all the nerfs.
---
All damage bonuses need to be only calculated on the base damage of weapon and then added at the end really.  Then they dont need to worry about the total combination of all the effects added to weapons.  Do not need to worry that Explosive plus Two Shot is going to make a +600% damage weapon.   The algorythim or codebase used to calculate the bonuses is flawed IMO.
---
Probably. That doesn't mean that those things can't be added later though. 
---
..that's a thing they've specifically stated they are not doing at this time? 
---
All the Order of Myseries upgrade to level 45.
---
The excavator armor can be recrafted up to level 45.
---
Yes, but I find that being able to build a nice camp is half the game enjoyment for me.  So I still build nice looking ones, at least to me that is. If I get too many griefers that come and start hitting it, then I will just find alternate games to play.  Just not worth the hassle anymore.  The intention of the game is not a PVP game.  Its focus on tons of PVE content.  The point that PVP starts ruining the game is the point where they really need to either remove PVP or make it much less intrusive to the PVE experience.
---
FUCK THAT.  My character is made for PVP and starting over would be dumb.  Don't want to die? Go to Adventure mode with the gutter bumpers up for you.  
---
There is one In a small shack North of the church near a gazebo In helvetia
---
Damn, I didn't know that. Thanks!
---
The lore behind mole miners is in the game, somewhere in the ash zone ;-)
---
If you bought Fallout 76 last year. You will find the classic games in the Bethesda app on PC. Just expand the game list. Once you find the game you be given the option to download and install the game. Or you will see the option to buy the game. 
---
I don't know where you will find it on Xbox or PS4.
---
Good luck to you too
---
Same. I have collected them again and keep a close eye on the amount of aluminum in my inventory.
---
Science!
---
All you had to do to get the Collection was play the game between launch and December 31st 2018.  If you did, they should have just been opened up to you in your launcher, so just check if you have the option to install them.  There was no need to claim anything.    
---
I'm talking about PC though, so I don't know how to go about that on console if that's your platform.  
---
There's 4 total junk spots along that river.  In the southwest corner of the forest near the industrial food processing workshop is the best spot imo as it's next to a workshop that provides endless salisbury steaks, a BUNCH of blood leaves and soot flowers to make healing salve, and a tank with a crushed skeleton at the head of the tank that has a stimpak spawn right next to it.
---
However further up above the mothman point of interest just north of a boat with a jaws reference easter egg (machete sitting next to weird dolphin thing with a dead guy above it on the boat) there's a junk pile overlooked by a cliff that provides EXCEPTIONAL natural defense with blood leaves and soot flowers just east of it.  There's also a natural enemy spawn just north but they're separated by water so turrets pick them off easily long before they run all the way around the cliff to you.  All you really will need to worry about are mole rats.
---
Once you're higher level there's a spot in the toxic valley south of the crashed space station where a junk pile and lead ore pile are close enough to grab both with your camp.
---
Fo76map.com should help you find it.  Just search for junk piles along the west river in the forest, once higher level then look for a lead spot nearby the fallen space station to the south and just north of a junk pile.
---
Sorry if this explanation is lacking, I'm ready for bed z-z

Oh really! I totally thought it was non existent, can you fill me in?
---
Hype for the goatsquatch!
---
CU ruined the game, but some of that content post CU near the end of the game was the most fun I had in galaxies in years post NGE. Granted was the CU/NGE popped I mostly stuck around for roleplay and space combat, it wasn't as bad as people make it out to be.
---
Whats your PSN 
---
Crystal-Dawn-86
---
I‚Äôm intrigued in this also, i was looking at someones screenshot before, and his weapon had a damage of 3082, an i sat there thinking ‚Äúsurely this Bloodied perk is broken as fuck as needs an adjustment‚Äù
---
I have all the melee mutations, strength maxed out, and my weapons w/adrenal reaction never go over 500 damage in rating even with adrenaline rank 3 with 5 kills giving an extra 48%, surely bloodied needs an adjustment in scaling?
---
I don‚Äôt quite understand how someone so squishy can take so much damage. I know you can get up 35 damage and energy resistance if mutated with mutants, and i‚Äôm sure bolstering gives the same, but can a normal dude with marine/combat armour seriously have a higher defence rating than someone in Power Armour?
---
Again, is that scaling NOT broken/sound off to you? Some weird shit‚Äôs going on.
---
Happy to be of assistance! 
---
Awesome tips, but does heavy guns boost BE? Card says non explosive
---
Deleted already, stand by what you say?
---
Re: Cryptids andnew creatures?  
---
I noticed that my personal quests have a few points in there, unchecked, that I never saw before. Killing the Flatwoods Monster is there, but also Fog Cralwer and Alien. Which makes me think those are going to drop soon...
---
why was this post removed? that‚Äôs fucked
---
&gt;Again, for the 3rd time, just because something is a bit better doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt use something. And the burst damage on a 2h is definitely higher than unarmed.
---
It's a one shot fest. You need to get your one shot in faster. You're aiming to get as fast as a trigger pull as you can because those are the attacks you're competing against. [Here's a detailed breakdown on DPS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/axffrc/psa_damage_per_second_calculations_how_sneak/) It has a direct comparison of a super sledge and a deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
&gt;And? These mechanics also take away from a ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù themed game mode where the world is supposed to be more dangerous. You don‚Äôt think those effects will be addressed?
---
Yes. For reasons I already explained. Is there anything to indicate it would be otherwise or is this just speculation? The only thing remotely related to this I'm aware of is players won't appear **on the map**, which makes perfect sense.
---
If you remove VATS you kill the luck skill tree. How you see this is "balance" is beyond me. What isn't hindered by killing this tree is buffed by contrast. Doing this makes heavy weapons and shotguns the new meta. 
---
&gt;The game would be FAR more simplistic, easier to balance, and would lose none of the RPG elements by removing vats, stealth boys, and legendaries.
---
You're asking for less fallout in a fallout game. This is just a bad idea.
---
&gt;Crits are again only necessary to kill certain builds because legendaries are in the game and unnaturally can boost your sustainability. If you removed both VATS and Legendaries, you‚Äôd have a world where crits don‚Äôt need to exist. 
---
Now the game revolves around power armor. Everyone's using T51 or X01 and has essentially the same build. No one uses unarmed because you can't use it in PA. Another recurring theme here is that others are buffed by contrast. Most markedly, heavy weapons win out the best since they have perks that specifically apply to PA. You're further unbalancing the game. Heavy weapons uber alles.
---
&gt;Why even give us the ability to play the game with FPS combat if the most effective way to kill someone is to use the built in aim-lock?
---
[It's a faithful adaptation of turn based combat in the original fallout game.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_Assisted_Targeting_System) Much of the game is centered around tactics. VATS is a tactic. 
---
&gt;They did the same fucking thing with Fortnite, a dead as fuck PvE game and it‚Äôs the biggest game in the world. Good mechanics will attract players, regardless of whatever the ‚Äúinitial‚Äù fan base might be.
---
Then go play fortnite. This isn't the game you want.
---
&gt;The only experience you seem to have in PvP is running some 1337 setup with four or five others (when there are like 15-20 people per server, most of them ungrouped) abusing mechanics that others are not interested in or are unaware of.
---
I'm not going to play the game worse to win morality points. I kill people and take their caps and junk. 
---
&gt;I‚Äôm also guessing you probably aren‚Äôt the best at the ‚ÄúFPS‚Äù element of the game and enjoy that you can use VATS and dice rolls to win.
---
You want traditional FPS elements, then class out to heavy weapons and shotguns. They're not VATS reliant. Don't be surprised when people leverage intended game mechanics to kill you, take your caps, and steal your junk. 
---
It sounds like you want less of this game and want more of another game. Maybe you should play games that fit your play style better. I don't play Madden and complain on reddit about how lacking the story telling is. 
---
Yes psn ? 
---
In photo mode one of the filters is the ID Card Setting. After taking your desired photo, go into the gallery, find the photo and there is an option to make it your ID photo
---
1080p gaming is perfectly fine with that setup.
---
The first thing to do is to make sure the game is running in Fullscreen mode.  Windowed or Windowed Fullscreen will tank your performance in a really bad way with this game for most people.  If you switch to Fullscreen, try doing it in the main menu screen, and not in game.  At least for me, changing graphics won't save unless I change them in the main menu screen. Reload the game.  After that, mess with the actual graphics settings, and again, in the main menu.  If it's still running poorly, maybe even try, when in game, hitting Alt+Enter to see if you need to manually set it to Fullscreen for some reason.  
---
Try putting settings on low and working your way up.  If the performance isn't up to your standards, try turning texture detail to medium, shadows and lighting settings to low, then reduce draw distance ranges to half or below.      
---
Hope that helps.  But I have a friend with a weaker setup than yours and I believe he gets 60fps on a 60Hz monitor fine on Medium or High settings.  
---
This comment form OP is like when you ask a girl what kind of car they use and they tell you the color.
---
He comes off as one of those Beth Can Do No Wrong types to me personally.
---
Saves time in searching for that coveted item I suppose, if you have Atoms burning a hole in your pocket and have the need to ponce about in some wasteland finery while squashing ghouls :)
---
I have a well integrated blend in camp, that I‚Äôve put great care into making look like part of the game world, and whenever I get that message it‚Äôs because someone‚Äôs built a big floating box on a magic staircase. You know the sort. So frustrating. 
---
Because if Pacifist Mode turns you and your CAMP into invincible, people will run with it 24/7 just to be protected from Raiders and switch if off as soon as they see Wanted player. This is abusing mechanic, because you are only interested in PVP when you got upper hand, when you don't you are just hiding cowardly behind the Pacifist Mode protection.
---
Why would I need money? I already got best gear I wanted and I already have caps filled. 
---
Wish I had that kinda of commitment. I completely agree about the friends thing, one of the reasons why I never spend very long in any game is because of the lack of friends.
---
stop farming lead and ammo and buy it. Use drugs a lot and buy those. Save time by buying things you normally have to put effort towards accumulating. Kill more players, buy more stuff. Run out of stuff, kill more players. It's the circle of life
---
My build on my main is crafting-based, i.e. minimal investment in dmg perks. In the case of using heavy waepons - 0 at all except for Stabilized since I have 15 Int and I can fit that in. And this is not based off of the stats screen for the weapon, I know it doesnt increase "on paper" dmg.
---
Now I am saying my damage increases because Ive fought the same type of enemies which were the same level with and without Stabilized with said TS gatling laser. I am not using VATS, I always ADS, unless Im using a rifle or other "precision" weapon. It simply takes less shots to kill something (not accounting for missed shots, of course, that is why I am not including scorchbeast kills in this although I do believe they died faster too). Ive never used Awareness to check their resistances. Unless there is some bug or weird mechanics going on with TS energy weapons that Im not aware of, I have a lower TTK for mobs since in my basically 0 dmg build any increases would be noticed.
---
You don't get them on the consoles themselves as there are no compatible versions. You have to download them on a pc using the Bethesda launcher.
---
F76 players:"We want bigger camps"
---
Also F76 players:"F#cking idiots building CAMP behind club house"
---
Now imagine people together building turret camps behind club house.
---
Ok..  As you say you are going for Rifle/Sniper build, be aware there are no weight reduction perks for any rifles in the current game.   There are weight reduction perks for Heavy weapons, Pistols, and melee weapons.   
---
Meaning equipping those perks will make all the weapons of that type lighter while in your inventory.
---
However, there is a perk you can use to make ballistic bullets lighter and its a strength perk, costs 2 ranks of perk cards in strength.
---
There is a perk card that makes all food/drinks lighter.
---
There is a perk card that makes all chemicals lighter.
---
There is a perk card that makes all armor pieces lighter.
---
There is a perk card that makes all Power armor pieces lighter.  (I would not recommend this one)
---
There is a perk card to make all energy ammo lighter.
---
Each of these perk cards have various number of times you can rank them up giving you even greater benefits from them.   Ranking up involves getting two of the same perk card and "merging" them into one.
---
So since you want to do rifle sniper build, you want to start focusing your perk choices in the perception area.   But keep in mind that early on, you have to try and get weight reduction perks as well in other areas as you really should not be putting points into strength.
---
Also when leveling up, you can choose say.. +1 perception, then choose a perk card from a different area like one of the luck perk cards.   You just have to unfilter the cards before choosing.   Some new people are not aware of this aspect.
---
So, because you are going to be picking up newer/different/better rifles as you progress, with all different types of ammo, good perk card for you would be the ballistic ammo weight reduction perk in strength which only needs 2 points of strength. 
---
Another good perk card you need to get is Gunsmith, which reduces the wear/tear of all your guns while using them and allows you to have the ability to make better mods for your guns.   You still need to scrap as many weapons as possible in order to learn new mods though.  There are a total of 5 ranks of gunsmith though and I think that is intelligence perk?  (forgot been a few months)
---
If you find yourself needing to carry around 20+ stimpacks, then investing a few perk points into the chemical reduction perk will help you greatly.   If you are able to just stash anything excess of 10 stims, then you probably wont need this.  Depends on your playstyle.
---
Also remember that Gunpowder is stored in your "Misc" tab and not considered junk and you can easily collect a huge amount of weight there there and bogging you down causing to confusion as to where all the weight is.
---
There is a Weight reduction perk for Junk items as well as 3 ranks of it.  Great to always have this one.  Always break down junk into its components as well for even less weight.  Stashed junk will not get this benefit of the weight reduction perk btw.   So if you constantly hit your camp all the time and dont really carry around much junk, this might not be as beneficial to you.  If you do massive junk runs and pick up everything thats not nailed down?  Might help alot.   Also keep in mind power armor always buffs your strength and allows more carrying capacity; especially Excavator Power armor.    Adding calibrated shocks to the legs of power armor will increase carrying capacity even more.  These are some of the most sought after mods for power armors too.
---
You may not want more than 5 points in intelligence though, that will give you enough points to swap out perk cards for any modifications/crafting plus allow you to equip the highest rank of gunsmith.   You probably want to focus in trying to get 15 points into Perception and/or luck for the highest damage.   Having some agility is great for defensive purposes (evasion Perk).  
---
Pistol builds can be quite powerful because they have more perks than other guns and only need to really focus in Agility/Luck.  But there is so many you also cannot get them all at once.
---
So its ok to get like 10 points in one stat your trying to focus toward and have weight reduction perks filling those slots initially, then slowly remove those in favor of damaging perk cards as you progress.
---
I highly recommend you focus on getting Armorsmith, Super Duper and Chemist early on as well.   Armorsmith will alow you to craft and mod armors with greater difficulty.   Well there is one set of armors within your reach that is some of the best ones in the game oddly enough.  Leather armors.  Right now they may not look like it but keep crafting those things and break them down until you learn the "Studded Leather" mod.  No other non-legendary armor in the game can match the physical and energy resists of studded leather; within the same teir of armors that is.  Meaning heavy combat armor will be better than light studded leather, but heavy studded leather will outmatch the heavy combat armor.   Also leather armors are some of the easiest to make.  If you happen to find a vendor selling the studded leather mod, take it!
---
Super duper allows 30% chance of doubling any and every player crafted item in game.  So always have that equipped while making anything (armors, chems, boiled water).  This is a luck perk.
---
Chemistry perk doubles all crafting of chemicals; 100% chance.  So with super duper and chemistry both equipped, you will rarely have any trouble with low stim pack supply.  You will be able to make many, many diluted stims.
---
Also with food/water, only carry around what you need in the next 1-2 hours.  Not everything.   Even then you can decide if you need the weight reduction perk for your food or not.  Growing your own food at your camp will help with this greatly, as you dont need to store food at all.  Just need to harvest it, cook it and go adventuring.  Super Duper will help make more food too.   There is a perception rank 1 perk that allows doubling of picked crops, very helpful in this situation.
---
As I recall the console versions still qualify, buy you can only play the old ones on a PC. Using the same console account.
---
Hoard screws, spring and ballistic fiber. You see an ammo bag or military grade tape you pick that sucker up! Hunting rifles are the best weapon early on. Make your own adhesive by growing tato, mufruit and corn and having a water purifier. Google how it‚Äôs done as this is important. Try to interact with other players! Put on pacifist mode in settings and do not fear high level players, 99% of them are decent folk and they just might help you out
---
Yes they do. They don't work on originally explosive weapons like the mininuke launcher. 
---
Thankfully, they work on heavy weapons that get the explosive legendary perk. 
---
I should have posted for others when I eventually figured that out... Thanks!
---
There no point to build on PVE anyway. If level 25 with pipe pistol can do SBQ, I don't see why you shouldn't be able to do it in assassin set.
---
I always wondered why the binocs had a damaged stat.
---
Sorry, my bad, its not called Bandit Power Armor, but something similar.  I just forgot the proper term.  Raider perhaps?   But its the lowest level power armor and you can equip it at level 25.  
---
Aaah ok, then i understand yes üòÅ
---
I run a few TSE gatling guns, and a bloodied explosive gatling for the Queen. They are good fun. 
---
Yeah i can imagine. Just need to find some mods now üòÅ
---
Ayep.  Someone just replied to this message with "Killing a mob without letting others hit it is the problem of other players. Shoot faster."
---
So some don't have this same view, they think its just friendly competition and don't realize they are actually ruining the game experience.
---
They are reading too much into things I think. Just because the image doesn't show a vault suit on the girl doesn't mean it's an NPC.
---
I interpret the picture more as: go raid stuff together. Be the raiders of the wasteland. Be a wastelander!
---
I'd love for some NPC raiders to come back. But I don't expect it.
---
I have scrapped my X-01 Power Armor with Jet pack and two calibrated shocks. It only scrapped the frame, so I just had to go get a frame and all was good. That is if you're not in it. If you're in it you could scrap the leg and loose the calibrated shock. I can't remember if a paint scheme name comes before mods. I have mine painted in Vault-tec and that would put them at the end if I ever scrapped while in PA.
---
Maybe, but given its what surely atleast 90% of the player base want, you would think they'd want to make that the end goal. Think how many new players that would bring in. Either way I love the game with or without NPC humans
---
I joined a Scotched Earth event earlier this week where there was only 9 min remaining, and when time ran out the Queen stayed and we were able to defeat it.
---
Last night I was with a group and we beat the queen twice in under 4 minutes. 
---
Meanwhile, I'm lopping off a quarter of their health at a time with my sledgehammer.
---
I‚Äôd guess he had the room blueprinted, that‚Äôs how he can build it so fast.  
---
Since you where still in the workshop zone, couldn‚Äôt you contest it and since he can‚Äôt shoot you either, take it over? 
---
I‚Äôve got a beautiful ensemble I found in the wasteland. A terrifying mix of asylum nurse outfit and faschnacht mask positively nightmare inducing. My bf refuses to play with me while wearing it. I think I‚Äôm too precious about my atoms I haven‚Äôt bought a thing yet. Keep waiting for that perfect item
---
LOL.  That is exactly what I had starting out.   I figured you can craft all those better mods and do more damage right???
---
&gt;Again, for the 3rd time, just because something is a bit better doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt use something. And the burst damage on a 2h is definitely higher than unarmed.  
---
&gt;It's a one shot fest. You need to get your one shot in faster. You're aiming to get as fast as a trigger pull as you can because those are the attacks you're competing against. Here's a detailed breakdown on DPS. It has a direct comparison of a super sledge and a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
**So we're back full circle to legendaries, again, breaking the balance. Do you fail to see how you've blatantly stuck your head in the sand to defend the current mechanics? You continue to talk about tactics (and later in this post you do as well), but this game is nothing more than Instagib from UT or Quake. Except in those games you had to aim to instakill someone. You're adamantly defending the game doing it for you. And you continually keep trying to state that I'm "wrong" by stating that the super sledge isn't as powerful as the deathclaw gauntlet. Is there truly a difference between 11k and 15k dps? The answer is no, because as you so aptly put it, it's a one-shot fest. All you need to do is land one swing, so the super sledge is easily just as viable provided you aren't simply running around hammering around your attack button. Which we already established you aren't, because you're using Vats from 15 feet away to teleport behind someone and 1shot them.**
---
&gt;And? These mechanics also take away from a ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù themed game mode where the world is supposed to be more dangerous. You don‚Äôt think those effects will be addressed?  
---
&gt;Yes. For reasons I already explained. Is there anything to indicate it would be otherwise or is this just speculation? The only thing remotely related to this I'm aware of is players won't appear on the map, which makes perfect sense.
---
**And? These exist solely to combat the cheese that is a stealth boy. Which we wouldn't even need to worry about if the stealth boy didn't exist.**
---
&gt;We can still have highly specialized builds without... having to use an auto-aim assist to deal with players like this... The game would be FAR more simplistic, easier to balance, and would lose none of the RPG elements by removing vats, stealth boys, and legendaries.  
---
&gt;If you remove VATS you kill the luck skill tree. How you see this is "balance" is beyond me. What isn't hindered by killing this tree is buffed by contrast. Doing this makes heavy weapons and shotguns the new meta.
---
**Luck can still exist in the game, just not in the same fashion as in other games. People seem to be fine with the fact that Charisma functions differently in 76 than in every other Fallout game. Why not the same with Luck? It can still have abilities like Bloody Mess, Starched Genes, and even Serendipity. Hell, there are plenty of perks that would still be just as effective without crits.**
---
&gt;The game would be FAR more simplistic, easier to balance, and would lose none of the RPG elements by removing vats, stealth boys, and legendaries.  
---
&gt;You're asking for less fallout in a fallout game. This is just a bad idea.
---
**Based on what? Your perception of what a fallout game should be? Every Fallout game prior to FO4 (the worst received FO game to date, aside from 76) did not have legendary items. And there was still a vast flexibility in playstyle and builds. Tons of viable setups for weapons and armor. Legendaries throw all that in the trash bin, because instead of being able to use what you like (because DR/DT and Damage outputs are relatively close), everyone is forced to use what is best.**
---
&gt;Crits are again only necessary to kill certain builds because legendaries are in the game and unnaturally can boost your sustainability. If you removed both VATS and Legendaries, you‚Äôd have a world where crits don‚Äôt need to exist.  
---
&gt;Now the game revolves around power armor. Everyone's using T51 or X01 and has essentially the same build. No one uses unarmed because you can't use it in PA. Another recurring theme here is that others are buffed by contrast. Most markedly, heavy weapons win out the best since they have perks that specifically apply to PA. You're further unbalancing the game. Heavy weapons uber alles.
---
**Oh wow, you mean they have to go in and simply nerf the protections of PA? WOW. THAT IS SUCH A DIFFICULT TASK TO MANAGE! HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY MANAGE TO FIGURE THAT OUT?**
---
**You legitimately are looking at this in the least objective way possible, not taking into consideration that more than one thing can be changed at a time.**
---
&gt;Why even give us the ability to play the game with FPS combat if the most effective way to kill someone is to use the built in aim-lock?  
---
&gt;It's a faithful adaptation of turn based combat in the original fallout game. Much of the game is centered around tactics. VATS is a tactic.
---
**Oh cool, a faithful adaptation of the original fallout game that is \*22 years old\*. Therefore everything must play the same as it did back then! Should we make it so that when another player opens their Pip-Boy, everyone else freezes and has to wait until that player closes out their Pip-Boy?!?!**
---
**Oh wait. None of the Bethesda games play the same as that game. Possibly because games have evolved past the limited technology of the time. You can still have VATS be implemented into the game, such as when activating VATS, players have certain areas of their bodies highlighted. Shooting these grants bonus damage. The difference is this version of VATS still requires skill to maximize the potential with. The current version requires zero skill and basically plays the game for you.**
---
&gt;They did the same fucking thing with Fortnite, a dead as fuck PvE game and it‚Äôs the biggest game in the world. Good mechanics will attract players, regardless of whatever the ‚Äúinitial‚Äù fan base might be.  
---
&gt;Then go play fortnite. This isn't the game you want.
---
**This is the game I want, so piss off.**
---
&gt;The only experience you seem to have in PvP is running some 1337 setup with four or five others (when there are like 15-20 people per server, most of them ungrouped) abusing mechanics that others are not interested in or are unaware of.  
---
&gt;I'm not going to play the game worse to win morality points. I kill people and take their caps and junk.  
---
&gt;I‚Äôm also guessing you probably aren‚Äôt the best at the ‚ÄúFPS‚Äù element of the game and enjoy that you can use VATS and dice rolls to win.  
---
&gt;You want traditional FPS elements, then class out to heavy weapons and shotguns. They're not VATS reliant. Don't be surprised when people leverage intended game mechanics to kill you, take your caps, and steal your junk.  
---
&gt;It sounds like you want less of this game and want more of another game. Maybe you should play games that fit your play style better. I don't play Madden and complain on reddit about how lacking the story telling is.
---
**Boy your examples are just garbage. I'm giving objective feedback on a topic that is crucial to the success and the game's future. Auto-aiming does not belong in an FPS. Get over it. Instagib is not a popular game mode. See every other game on the market. There isn't a single one where the offensive capabilities exponentially dwarf the defensive ones.**
---
**Fallout 76 has potential to be an incredible PvP focused game, but players like yourself need to make concessions. It's a multiplayer game. You can't pull everything from a single player game into it. That's part of the tradeoff for playing with others; you acknowledge that an individual player cannot become too powerful, and that mechanics that exist in a singleplayer game are most likely not going to transition to a multiplayer game.**
---
**Removing (or reworking, as mentioned above) VATS, scrapping the legendary system, and disabling stealth boys/cloaking/chameleon effects on PvP servers would be a fantastic start. You'd remove a large amount of cancer right off the bat, instead of trying to balance it out. Then you'd play with some perks, adjust some damage/armor values, and voila. A fairly balanced PvP system. Not the mess we currently have.**
---
**But thanks for confirming. You crutch on poor mechanics that are, again, either uninteresting or unknown to the vast majority of players. Your megalomania ensures that you'll fight tooth and nail to ensure that your seat of power remains undisturbed. Every MMO has players like you in it.**
---
Bathe in his glory.

Eh, I had 15 INT when I started as well.  I thought I was doing good.  You really only ever need 5 int.  Gunsmith requires 5 at its highest rank, and every other crafting perk can be swapped in when needed.   Do not need all the others.  If you are playing pure Power Armor build?  Sure I can see having more Int.    
---
&gt; I've probably been playing Fallout longer than you've been alive.
---
Nope!
---
Stick to FPSs, casual. Getting the most plentiful materials in the game for bullets and defending bases is too much work for you. Eagerly awaiting your next post about your hardcore history of gaming yet finding steel is a problem.
---
They haven't completed the game yet, because now one of the loading screens recognize that the scorch are controlled by some kind of hive mind, and asks the question "can anything be done to stop them?" Or something like that. So, I'm pretty sure the Interloper or something similar is going to end up being the big baddie behind the scorched.
---
Thank you!!
---
I don't play any FPS games aside from this. Left 4 Dead back in the day. You're hilarious. Really, you should spend all your time on here because people could really use your opinion.
---
Yesterday it happened again.
---
I got a good -30% on all weapons. This is so weird. Noticed because i went to Harpers Ferry for my daily vendor run, and I wasnt able to one shot supermutants with my melee. Checked my pipboy, bam! everything dropped for no reason.
---
I have mutations, but no bolstering/unyielding armor pieces. It makes just a slightly difference when in PA cos I have +2 STR on torso, but thats all.
---
Oh and by the way, im lvl 99 with 360 hrs. Like you, I couldn't care less about farming xp in whitespring blast zone, I decided to go there 'only' when it happens that somebody launches a nuke in my world. Same thing for queens. I did less than 15 queens.
---
I don't want this game to get me bored doing the same thing over and over. This will likely kill the game soon. I like to experience new things every day I play, exploring, listening holos, reading all the terminal entries and notes, collecting every useful piece of scrap from the floor, building, crafting... or just chill on my couch watching the sunset while listening to 'mister sandman' and 'take me home'. There's time to level up. I will get to 200 eventually, but i'll get there by normal progression. 
---
Lots of players that started a trade with me said: 'Oh dude how come you're so low-level and you have such a big inventory'?
---
Well my answer is: 'I love to play Fallout the old-school way'
---
Always played like this, since fallout 3. This is fallout for me. This is my world.
---
Ad victoriam
---
Sorry for the OT
---
Rifle builds:  Perception + Luck + Some Agilty.
---
Pistol Builds:  Agility + Luck.
---
Explosive Builds:  (Sorry dont know this one)
---
Melee Builds: Strength + Luck (guessing on the second SPECIAL here)
---
Stealth Sniper Builds: Luck + Agility + Perception -- Want more focus on higher damage gained through luck and agility perks rather than Rifleman/Commando (Meaning maybe not getting second and third ranks of those, only the first rank of each perk).
---
The game recognizes they are a hive mind now. Since there are multiple queens, and killing her doesn't disable the scorched in any way, something must be controlling the SB and SBQ too. Is there any lore on the full experiment from West Tek(?) or is this game Bethesda's first foray into this particular lore?
---
I for one think the consistent undertone of the Interloper was no mistake. I believe once they finish adding in the content at Arktos Pharma, that we will finally be able to "Buffout the Interloper" and fight a boss fight that makes the SBQ look like child's play.
---
It would be really cool if you could set a major and minor color for armor pieces, and then you and your squad could all set the same major color and then a personalized minor color and be able to tell each other apart but all look coordinated 
---
Power armor especially.    
---
My mega-garage was at the airport. That settlement without settlers. Four rows of PA displays the full width of the build area that clicked into each other. There were probably almost a hundred power armors.
---
Those didn't include the ones I liked to use or the ones I left in my Brotherhood inspired settlement...
---
Right, because the board is clamoring for more posts from people on the verge of quitting. 
---
Good luck finding gunpowder champ, lord knows how rare it is.
---
The game recognizes the hive mind via a loading screen. It clearly states that's what the scorched are, and asks the question what can be done to stop them.
---
I have a combat shotgun with only the quad legendary effect. It's basically the same as yours. With Enforcer and the other shot gun perks I use it to shoot the legs off everything and then kill them at my leasure. Works wonderfully.
---
Int is good if using Power armor as well for the weight reduction and wear-tear of the Power armor plus cheaper repairs.  If not using power armor mostly, you can probably get rid of some int in favor of more damaging perks (agility or Luck)
---
Very nice write up.
---
Weird enough, the one thing I'm most interested about is the Prestige system. I'm level 200+, so how does this work if we get a reset or whatever at lvl 50? Do I get 4 resets? Does anyone have ANY info about this? 
---
Oh yeah.. Me too.  I think I am into 30+ levels of respeccing now.  I started out with 15 int thinking the ability to craft all those mods would eventually be great for end-game while being a newb, not fully realizing you can just swap them out and also when leveling you can actually choose a perk card thats not in the same SPECIAL as you want.
---
You use both melee and guns equally?   I usually favor one over the other and just suck up the cost of repairing on the lesser used in favor of getting more damage augmenting perks.
---
Yesterday I did an SBQ event where she did not leave after we failed the event. We continued to beat on her until her health was a tiny sliver. She flew up into the sky, and then back down through the ground.  I thought it was all over, I messaged my friend that had given up and singed off that we failed and then she popped out of the ground right in front of me, I shot her one more time and she died right there.  I got loot off her, and I assume everyone else did as well.  
---
This.
---
Half the time I'm at the vendor they say they have notta. Just sell something anyway and their caps suddenly appear. If they are truly outta caps the trade will fail.
---
Or you can just exit and re-enter trade till the caps display properly.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the gamma gun fall under energy weapons. 
---
Yes, it will be 4 star. No, it won't cancel the others.  There are a few who have done it already.  I've made a couple of the Scorched Killers. 
---
I also have the sacrificial blade plan learned, so I can add that onto any machete I find.
---
Here's my perk loadout for my rifleman.  [General walking around](https://imgur.com/lxPbduh) and [big fight](https://imgur.com/M5n5ewD).  I have a backup spear for molerats and easy enemies, but I primarily focus on two rifles for long range sniping and close quarters encounters.  If you have one weapon type maxed out, there's very little reason to be messing around with alternatives that you're not specced for.  The perk investment may not seem "worth it", but when various perks all work in tandem with mutations and legendary weapon effects, you really start cooking on high heat.  (it's like in the movie Office Space, where they skimmed the rounded off portion of pennies from every account and wound up with millions in their account.) 
---
It's just my opinion, but I'd rather be really great at one thing than alright at a few.  It certainly saves ammo and time.  My melee alt has the base +30% gunslinger/expert/master boosts for a backup pistol, just because it was easy to fit into the build.  Even with Bloody Mess, his pistol damage is entirely forgettable with an anti-armor/explosive western revolver.  I only use it on flying scorchbeasts and lower level enemies that are annoying me on ledges that I'm too lazy to run up a flight of stairs and engage with in melee.
---
I have a few perks that pertain specifically to an explosive weapon, namely demo expert and fireproof.  If you don't need/want to boost explosive damage or protect yourself from friendly fire, Dromedary and Good Doggy are excellent choices for Endurance, and Nerd Rage is a solid choice for Int.  If you don't like the idea or running around with 20% or less health, which I'm not personally a fan of, Pharmacist will give you fantastic results with Radaway, and First Aid makes stimpaks almost 50% better.  Alternately, putting an extra couple points in CHA and using field surgeon dramatically improves both stimpak and radaway effectiveness.  Using field surgeon and first aid together almost instantly brings me up to full health once I hear the low health heartbeat on my melee alt.
---
Your perks and even your stat points aren't set in stone.  You can opt to move a point on a level up, or pick new perks.  My melee has 1-2-3 rank cards of both Blocker and Incisor.  I don't really need incisor when killing ghouls at Whitespring, but blocker is really handy.  I don't need Blocker when I'm in Watoga, but Incisor is great for beating the armor of the local robots.  I might want one rank of blocker and two ranks of incisor when taking on super mutants at Harper's Ferry.  
---
Swapping and mixing perks is a really great feature of 76.  You don't need to run around with lockpicking perks.  Swap them in when you want to bust open a safe.  Swap in Weapon Artisan when you need to fix your guns, then swap it back out.  Swap in Super Duper when making food or ammo, then put Bloody Mess back on.  Use Hard Bargain and Travel Agent when doing your vendoring, then swap Lone Wanderer or party related perks back in when it's clobberin' time.
---
I did a Mistress of Mysteries build, but I really didn't know what I was doing. One handed Melee, and pistols, I know; but Shannon Rivers describes it as having high perception and intelligence. When I was done, I had to re-spec; My perception was at 7, but I didn't need more than 4, and I stopped putting points into intelligence at 6, when I realized it wasn't helping. I wound up putting those misplaced points into agility mostly. 
---
But realize it takes very long time to get your character fully respecced.  I am 30+ levels into it and STILL got a ways to go to get my shifting to were I want.  Yes, I was badly done initially with 15 INT. Oh well.   Now I got 15 Luck, 11 Agility and 15 perception.   Over time I will reduce perception some and put more into agility.   Plus I have rank 3 perk cards that I now need to replace with rank 1 cards.  Sooo.... thats more levels to now earn those rank 1 cards.  Which seems silly to me.   I am really good with 1 ability but need more experience at it to do worse???
---
Actually during the recent content announcement part of it was that we will get the chance to go explore a whole new map and a whole new story line. So, I think they will do just that (which is about par for the course for RPGs. You have several different areas that can be traveled to. It would be cool to see us start expanding into the neighboring states. And then further. I for one, as a native North Carolinian, want to see how badly my state would have been messed up. We have several major military installations, so I imagine most of it would be like the Glowing Sea.
---
&gt; Deathclaw took about a tenth of it's total health. But for some bloody reason my nukes were detonating midflight right in my face whenever I fired at the mirelurk queen. 
---
The queen's acid was probably hitting the nuke. 
---
Energy weapons in FO76 are impacted by whatever perk cards affect the fun type they are. For example, energy rifles are increased by rifleman perks, and energy pistols are influenced by gunslinger perks.
---
Gamma gun is currently impacted by no perks that I can discern.
---
I'm level 23 and have 2 Bravo and 2 Charlie
---
The whole concept of T.O.W.N.s or hubs have been discussed here at great length many times.
---
I was fully in favor of this months ago... but now? Not so much with the current state of game.  
---
As the game gets older, there has tended to be more griefers, at least in my experience anyway.   I was there 2 days after release (did not preorder) and never found any griefers, not a single one.   Now?   There is probably a 50% chance that any player visiting my camp, that he will be a griefer.    That's my estimations based on my latest encounters anyway, not saying its the same for everyone else!   Maybe people just dont like my ATOM Garage door?  My small courtyard with statue and flowers?  Snow man inflatible?  Dont know.
---
But my point is there are griefers and they will go out of their way to locate CAMPS so they can tear them down.   Reason:  Dont know?  Just to be jerks?  Feel powerful over something else?
---
So grouping multiple CAMPs together would be a huge temptation.   I imagine you would often see groups of Griefers (No they are not Role-playing Bandits) hitting those places and forcing people to spend stable fluxes fixing those arches or caps to move camps or a few hours of their time trying to rebuild all those structures because the game wont allow you to place down the blueprint.
---
Thanks for the info, I appreciate it a lot. I too have sacrificial blade mod and put that on my ghoul slayer machete....awesome results.
---
New CAMP plans? Or do you have a time machine and already have those too?
---
Wait until you kill it in mid air, and it's corpse sails over the out of bounds fence.  Truly a magical experience. 
---
Bethesda, I DO mind switching out perks.
---
Whilst a direct shortcut to the perk menu would be cool and all - you clearly wanted us to be able to switch out the cards whenever we like. A simple 2 or 3 customizable loadouts would be fantastic.
---
yep, fallout 1 and 2 had ones (ok there was a CHANCE to pick it but who cares) i would say YES that would be a nice idea.
---
The only image released with the player vending machines shows it inside a workshop.
---
If they limit the player vending machines to workshops, then that means only those who want to PVP can use them.
---
Now if they make it buildable at CAMPS, then you would need to have your camp show up as icon on the map correct?  What a better way for a griefer to find camps.
---
Its its current state of the game with just adding Vending machines in and not changing one of the above two areas, no way I would make a vending machine of any type.
---
That'd be awesome! Alternatively faction colours would be an awesome addition for armors and cosmetic items
---
&gt;And you continually keep trying to state that I'm "wrong" by stating that the super sledge isn't as powerful as the deathclaw gauntlet. Is there truly a difference between 11k and 15k dps? The answer is no, because as you so aptly put it, it's a one-shot fest. All you need to do is land one swing, so the super sledge is easily just as viable provided you aren't simply running around hammering around your attack button.
---
[A deathclaw gauntlet is a second faster at base.](https://imgur.com/a/SFQUjF9)
---
&gt;you're using Vats from 15 feet away to teleport behind someone and 1shot them.
---
[No teleporting](https://imgur.com/a/bIGivRg)
---
&gt;And? These exist solely to combat the cheese that is a stealth boy. Which we wouldn't even need to worry about if the stealth boy didn't exist.
---
No, these are base features. The arrow and red dot are there by default and enhanced by perception. High perception builds get it further distance regardless of whether or not the opponent is using a stealth boy. 
---
&gt;Luck... It can still have abilities like Bloody Mess, Starched Genes, and even Serendipity. Hell, there are plenty of perks that would still be just as effective without crits.

&gt;Based on what? Your perception of what a fallout game should be? Every Fallout game prior to FO4 (the worst received FO game to date, aside from 76) did not have legendary items.
---
Based on the fact I've been playing the fallout series since fallout 1 in jr high. Not trying to play historian here or anything, but these are the things that made fallout fallout.
---
Before we had legendary weapons we just had unique weapons. 
---
We always had a tactical combat system like VATS. 
---
Before it was turn based combat and the game's foundations are cheesy dice roll elements you don't appreciate (google "fallout GURPS"). 
---
Stealth boys have been in game since FO1 as well. 
---
There's kinda more to this game than nuclear apocalypse window dressing.
---
&gt;You legitimately are looking at this in the least objective way possible, not taking into consideration that more than one thing can be changed at a time.
---
Realistically that's not going to happen. Wish in one hand and shit in the other. See which one fills up first. I don't even need to be right, I just know you're not going to get what you want. How's that for objectivity?
---
&gt;Oh cool, a faithful adaptation of the original fallout game that is *22 years old*. Therefore everything must play the same as it did back then! Should we make it so that when another player opens their Pip-Boy, everyone else freezes and has to wait until that player closes out their Pip-Boy?!?!
---
I mean, if you saw what turn based combat was like back then you'd understand how much it's adapted and what elements have been retained. 
---
&gt;Auto-aiming does not belong in an FPS.
---
You can keep referring to it as that, but all it does it broadcast how little you understand the utility of the game mechanics. They game's really unbalanced if your play style is to purposely nerf yourself.
---
&gt;Removing (or reworking, as mentioned above) VATS, scrapping the legendary system, and disabling stealth boys/cloaking/chameleon effects on PvP servers would be a fantastic start. You'd remove a large amount of cancer right off the bat, instead of trying to balance it out. Then you'd play with some perks, adjust some damage/armor values, and voila. A fairly balanced PvP system. Not the mess we currently have.

Ahh my workplace isn‚Äôt necessarily like that we operate a 24/7 incident recovery team for +6000 servers and +1500 branch offices and buildings. So it‚Äôs more of hey these are the actual problems we are working on but we have to go type of thing. 
---
The wheel gets very confused by &gt; 1 of a type of weapon in your inventory. I've had it swap which one I faced and on at least one occasion made it like I was firing blanks until I stashed them and only picked up one at a time. 
---
Like I‚Äôve actually had to turn over a building fire to the next shift. 
---
This is not the same as player vending. These are those vendor kiosks for things like meds, ammos, etc. You already see in game.
---
Yeah I'm still leveling and went with a 1 tile at the base camp so I can place it anywhere and just keep moving as I'm questing. Figured I'm either spending caps on moving or fast traveling back to quest locations, only difference is I save time moving camp.
---
Exactly. Monsters usually have the same or higher E-DR but we have no penetration: no perks, anti-armor legs or armor pen magazines.

Just Sounds Like a whole heaping bowl of salt to me.

You must of been defending your workshop or mutually engaged in PVP by shooting back knowing full well that it was a 2v1 situation, even without optimised builds why would you go for that to get your Hero story on the frontpage "I Wrecked 2 Greifers that were killing everyone"
---
You Lost respawn and get over it.
---
The mask by itself looks so silly to me.  They either need to make the mask cover the entire head or allow helmets to be worn with it.
---
While I'm not trying to discredit your post since I'm almost positive you're correct (I've never used the gamma gun in Fallout 76), I have to ask... Why are you using the gamma gun of all weapon options? Wouldn't this only be useful in PVP? What creatures does this actually hurt? Since I haven't used it, I wouldn't know
---
 Even though they consume more bullets now, it's nice not having to worry about dying to your own gun

with bolstering armor (more def on lower health) some under armor, a bloody weapon u can nearly outrun a Standart Power Armor (if it has a Emergency Protocol Chest Mods thats a whole other story)
---
Sure the risk on 19% Life high but your def stats makes u tough enough to have a got chance to counter your enemy.
---
Bloody is NOT realy broken because it comes with the high risk but sure if u have the right perks+equip its extremly strong too.
---
Im running a power armor bloody version and i can say that im pretty strong AND tough... never tested it in PVP but with and Emergency Protocoll i can stand in supermutants lvl 60+ 4-5 ones and can loot every single one i killed without taking a stimpack because is have enough time to watch my lifebar and deciede to loot another one or use a stim for looting more quietly.
---
Thank you my dude/dudette
---
Stuff like VATS tightens the skill gap. Change my mind
---
Heavy gunner perks say nonexplosive heavy guns...
---
&gt;A deathclaw gauntlet is a second faster at base.
---
If 1 second is the only difference, then the Super Sledge is indeed viable.
---
&gt;No teleporting
---
You've already linked that. And you've absolutely been sticking your head in the sand. You aren't even at the maximum range for VATS.
---
&gt;No, these are base features. The arrow and red dot are there by default and enhanced by perception. High perception builds get it further distance regardless of whether or not the opponent is using a stealth boy.
---
Which exist as part of a game that was designed around PvE and the ability to spot a cloaked player at distance. Likely they'll remove it, just like the nameplates, once the PvP servers go live.
---
&gt;We would all run the same perks in the luck skill tree. There would be no variety in builds.
---
Just because you're using the same useful skills in any one tree doesn't mean there is no variety. Most builds people run are similar anyways. The nuances are what makes it great.

&gt;There's kinda more to this game than nuclear apocalypse window dressing.
---
So I understand you're probably 40 and this may come as a shock, but I've got a fair amount of experience with the Fallout games as well. The fact that you played it in Jr. High is erroneous. There is nothing wrong with unique weapons. They added flair and flavor, and USUALLY there were unique weapons that made previously obsolete weapons viable for end game (i.e. Blade of the East in FNV, which was about 50-60% stronger than a normal bumper sword).
---
&gt;Realistically that's not going to happen. Wish in one hand and shit in the other. See which one fills up first. I don't even need to be right, I just know you're not going to get what you want. How's that for objectivity?
---
Realistically we weren't going to ever see PvP servers, remember? Slap damage was going to create the "perfect" balance for those that wanted PvP and those that didn't.
---
Realistically we were never going to see a multiplayer Fallout game either. See where I'm going? Feel free to keep holding your shit in your hand though. On second thought, you can hold mine too.
---
&gt;I mean, if you saw what turn based combat was like back then you'd understand how much it's adapted and what elements have been retained.
---
No shit sherlock. Again, just because I didn't play the game in Jr. High doesn't mean I don't understand how the game's evolved. I was throwing that back in your face. 
---
&gt;You can keep referring to it as that, but all it does it broadcast how little you understand the utility of the game mechanics. They game's really unbalanced if your play style is to purposely nerf yourself.
---
This doesn't even make sense. The game is just as much an FPS/TPS as it is an RPG. No one's arguing that not using the mechanics of the game won't gimp you. That's like saying if you implemented a fourth option for rock/paper/scissors that automatically beat rock/paper/scissors. Everyone would understand what they're supposed to use, but they would most likely choose to remove that option due to it outclassing everything else. 
---
&gt;Todd Howard called and he wants to know when you can start. You obv need to be running the show

Wow dude. Sick burn. I bet it took your 3 brain cells all day to come up with that.

&gt;Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe.

3/10. Garbage troll.
---
I was disappointed by that clock, I expected it would actually work, not just flash 12:00. 
---
Thanks for the information, I appreciate it very much. 
---
One time I saw a guy just crouched near some rocks just not moving.  I see his Mic is working so I walk over. 
---
I can hear him watching pornography.  Yeah. 
---
this gives me hope
---
&gt;First, I'm melee. I have some good melee weapons, both for out of PA and in.
---
An unarmed weapon is good out of PA since you benefit from talons and twisted muscles. In PA, probably go with a good machete with a sacrificial blade mod. It's also nice to keep a mr handy buzz saw blade on hand for certain situations since it staggers people.
---
&gt;Second, what is the deal with the unyielding/sentinel/vanguard builds? I get what they do, but what are the ways around them?
---
Sentinel: Stagger them. Use a staggering perk if your weapon has it (melee doesn't have a stagger perk) or just use a crit. Crits stagger and when they stagger they're vulnerable, so go from crits to a fast hitting weapon. The buzz saw blade also staggers, but the damage is less.
---
Unyielding: It just makes your stats really high so your derieved attributes are better. Better accuracy with ranged weapons so you can get consistent head shots. Better damage with melee due to strength. That's kinda why he one shot your son.
---
&gt;That barely knocked a tiny bit of health off the guy. Then, said guy turned around and one hit him, launching him into orbit. How does that even happen?
---
Serendipity (45% chance to avoid 100% damage), dodgy (-30% damage at the cost of AP), lone wanderer (30% less damage) or empath (25% less damage per mutated team mate), nerd rage (40 damage resist), assassin (40% less damage from players), sentinel (75% less damage while standing and not moving), blocker (45% less melee damage). Some are additive, some are multiplicative. 
---
&gt;Anti-armor weapons... is this the end all be all for PVP?
---
No. AA is capped and has diminishing returns. The best use of AA weapons is using it so you don't have to take as many points of incisor. If you have 3 ranks of incisor, you should use something else. If you want to use AA, use something like blocker in it's place and partial stack of incisor (maybe 1 point, 2 max).
---
&gt;I'm personally thinking suppressor in order to minimize their return damage. But, maybe AA is the best? Or assassins?
---
Best depends on build. But assassin's sucks even for PvP. Furious has a 30% cap I think. The best choices for melee are probably bloodied, AA, furious, and executioners. If your main concern is bloodied builds, get executioner's. If you fight tanks, AA or furious. If you tank or you're a low life build, take bloodied.
---
&gt;Otherwise I have a mix of 3-2* legendary marine and heavy BoS or polymer combat armor.
---
Even just a full set of assassin's gear is great to increase your survivability against players. If you just want to kill melee's bothering you, get a reflect damage weapon and block or just get reactive plate armor. Let your aggressor kill themselves.
---
That said, PA is what you usually wear if you want to die in PvP.
---
&gt;I'd enjoy it if someone more skilled could walk me through all of this, even working with me live in game. All I want to do is nail someone giving me slap damage/grief
---
Are you on PC?
---
Good work! Very much enjoyed reading this.
---
Also, I'd like to offer a bit of advice as a ranged character for if/when you decide to participate in nuke zones.
---
First of all, enable passive mode.  It's in your "game" setting options when you're actively on a server.  You can't set it from main menu.  It will prevent you from hurting other players, and allow you to take advantage of aoe effects that I'll explain below without becoming wanted or screwing up someone's day.
---
Generally speaking, you're going to be in an area with a lot of other players.  By far, the two most common are Whitesprings and Fissure Prime.  Fissure Prime is more of a team based PvE experience, where everyone is working together to achieve a common goal, but Whitesprings can become a Black Friday shopping spree where people are looking out for #1 first and foremost.  
---
My first advice is to get a suit of T-51b.  It doesn't have the best rad resist, but it has the highest damage resist versus conventional attacks.  With a couple ranks of Blocker, and other healing related perks in my previous post, you can soak up a considerable amount of damage from whitesprings ghouls.  I recommend going to Phoenix in Watoga and purchasing a tesla coil torso mod.  It zaps any and all hostiles near you, which gives you "tag" damage on enemies.  That means that if someone else killed it, you still dealt damage to the enemy and get loot.  
---
My second bit of advice requires a bit of work, but is endlessly useful for legendary farming as a ranged build.  First, acquire a tesla rifle or the plans for it and make one.  Second, you either have the option of crafting/scrapping dozens of teslas or checking the vendors in Watoga and Harper's Ferry for an automatic barrel.  Maybe you have a high level friend that can trade or make you one.  The tesla rifle has a unique feature where the initial strike arcs and jumps to nearby enemies, making it a massively effective weapon for tagging and/or decimating closely packed mobs, like what you'll get in the Whitesprings Clubhouse.  Even if there's some melee blocking the doorway, you can just shoot at him in passive mode and the tesla will arc on to all nearby enemies.  (If you've maxed out rifleman perks, you can build up your commando perks and simply swap them in when farming whitesprings and truly smash the entire clubhouse mob in seconds.)  This allows you to benefit from the wealth of legendary gear without having to actively compete with players that didn't learn that sharing is caring.  Between the rifle and the tesla coiled T-51b armor, you're a legendary farming machine.
---
Bring at least 20-30 radaway.  You'll need it unless someone was gracious enough to set up a pop-up base nearby with a rad shower.  Power armor mitigates about 95% of the environmental damage, but you'll need to prevent yourself from dying periodically.  Again, Pharmacist perk dramatically improves the effectiveness of your radaway.  Three ranks will clear you completely when below 30% health or so, assuming you don't want the rad damage to maintain a bloodied/nerd rage/adrenal build.  I think the damage looks great in a screen shot, but it's not much fun to actually play.  Just my opinion.
---
I've done that too, except not trying to pretend to be a NPC. Vault-tec T60 and putting stuff in a bag for them, telling them Vault-tec cares.
---
Even after the nerf of two shot explosive and explosive my stats allow me to push 800 damage a shot 
---
Not much you can do other than hit them while they move.
---
What I do against someone who's good at pvp:
---
Use a stealth boy so they cant vats. Use cryo grenades so they cant vats, sprint, power hit or benefit from the dodgy perk. Use blocker 3, serendipity 3, dodgy 3, fireproof 3 and dense mod. Chameleon so they cant see me. 
---
I've been a bloodied build since the game came out and the biggest counter against me is a rapid firing vats gun because it takes away dodgy 3 quicker. 
---
I haven't been fortunate enough to find bloodied sentinel but I've fought people with assassin sentinel and I didnt even tickle them with my 2k sledge or vats crit handmade unless they were moving, and even then I couldn't do much. 
---
Anyone who lucked out during the huge duping period and got a full God roll set like that is as godly as you would expect
---
I never said I use the Gamma Gun, so I'm not sure why you're presuming I do. I definitely don't. I do have an Anti-Armor one though, so I was thinking about pulling it out during a PVP encounter to see if it's even useful in that department. Without any perk increases (because none seem to work), it's doing 125 radiation damage, and I can unload a clip in probably 1-second, maybe less. So I want to test it because it might melt someone, especially with it's Anti-Armor boost.  
---
If any perk cards are supposed to impact this, it would be downright sick in PVP.
---
Where are the primary drop locations in the asylum?
---
What makes VATS essential in PvP though? Melee? If there was a proper balance stuff like Miniguns or Shotguns should shred them. And with the Nuclear Winter mode we might even get a battle royale. It should be noted that I dont play any battle royale. If anything VATS should only lock onto NPCs.
---
3rd level. I found one is the showers and the other on a bed. Right in the area that the elevator brings you. 
---
I only presumed because you said it wasn't affected by the perks, thus you had it equipped. So I assumed you had tried it to some extent, like for PVP as you suggested. Sorry for my assumption
---
Damage mitigation&gt;damage resistance. They run a lot of damage mitigation effects.
---
thanks for taking the time to answer my post. I do hope that magicaly everything will be ok again if i start the game this evening :s   
---
I contacted bethesda yesterday and got this: 
---
I looked into the issue, and it seems some players have found success in doing the following:
---
    Unequip all Perk Cards
---
    Unequip all Weapons and Armor
---
    Cure any disease/mutations/addiction
---
    After unequipping everything, log out and back in again
---
    If the issue continues, unequip Perks/Weapons/Armor again
---
    Try server hopping
---
    Re-equip Perks/Weapons/Armor to check weapon damage
---
In my case it's more like -50/55 % loss on all the weapons. 
---
For example the base damage for a dragon is 200, i have several rifleman perks and my damage is now 186 (and the weapon is fixed to more than 100% health). does not make sense at all.
---
Earlier this week i bought a TSE shotgun for 2500 caps, the damage with all the perks in place was around 240, now i have around 144 with master shotgunner, bloody mess etc. No way that a TSE level 40 would do under 100 damage without perks.
---
I roleplayed as a soldier who spent 25 years in the vault and kind of felt a connection with the Brotherhood as they were also the army, but that didn't agree on those parts of the policy. I also added some of that later purity to it, but when I accidentally got mutated and got the marsupial it was to fun to remove and I kind of "left" the Brotherhood. Even though I think of my character as very USA-loyal I still don't like the enclave.
---
Done and done. While not bleeding edge, she does the job I'd like to think. Haha.
---
You call it stealing, I call it passive raiding
---
I mean do you really want to continue? I'm convinced you're wrong, you're convinced I'm wrong. Nothing's going to change these positions.
---
by the way is your problem gone again or not? 
---
Should turn into a meat pie as big as a scorchbeast dungpile.
---
This isn't the first post I've seen about the asylum workers outfit and the color variations you can get. So I've got to ask... why are so many people interested in them and the different colors? What's so special about them? Is it just a collection thing? I don't bother collecting most outfits in this game since I can always come by them again at some time or another and I don't have an unlimited stash like in a single player game
---
Sorry forgot to tell you, yeah it‚Äôs gone. Logged out and back in. For some reasons it works again but will double check this evening.
---
No worries on the assumption; I just had to defend my honor so to speak. I'm currently a bloodied rifle build, but I tend to equip a variety of items and mess with my perk cards to see what boosts I can make. I'm always entertaining new builds.
---
VATS enables crits. Crits help defeat the sentinel effect by staggering. Heavy weapons and shotguns can be very effective against melee and sentinel builds. Staggered sentinels take more damage, staggered melee builds can't close distance. They have a high rate of stagger. If there's anything you should take out of this, it's that staggers are really important for PvP. 
---
did not take it as an insult :-)     i have only started to level up "quickly" the last three weeks going to whitespring. Before it took me hours and hours to go from one level to the next.  
---
Not sure if they can be compared but for example in fallout 4 I was probably around level 58 when i finished the game the first time (around 120 hours)
---
I'm pushing for 600hrs in game I got bored. Started looking for rare or kinda rare stuff. There was a post last weeks 2 weeks ago about the pink asylum outfit. And that reminded me about the various types. For me its boredom. For the stash I use my fiance account. many of my friends use there own account vie a friend to help. 
---
Exactly!
---
I used drug + food boost my INT rise to 19 and made 5 x lv.15 handmade rifles and scrap all but they didn't give me anything since I got all mods except suppressor . It's seem like it will never come :P
---
I've been trying that a little bit myself but have been failing miserably ever since I gave up on my original shotgunner build. My latest has been an auto grenade launcher Demolitions Expert. But since they nerfed explosives (FOR NO REASON! Not gonna get into it. Lol) I waste all my grenades continuously and it's irritating as hell. I also dabbled into heavy guns but my minigun eats up ammo and does no damage so it's sitting in storage for now. Hopefully with this upcoming update to energy weapons and heavy guns I'll finally be able to dust it off and be the full auto Heavy Gunner/Tank I've been dreaming of üòÅ

And I was under the impression you knew that upload manipulation is against reddit's rules. [From his official YT Community Page:](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQfDz2nfoJKstZzBOpu0TXg/community) 
---
"Ich habe mir die M√ºhe gemacht nen ausf√ºhrlichen Reddit Post als Feedback zu Fallout 76 PVP zu schreiben, es w√§re sehr hilfreich, wenn ihr den kurz upvoten k√∂nntet, sodass Bethesda ihn sieht und entsprechend darauf eingehen kann: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comment...Ôªø"
---
Which translates to:
---
"I've been through the hassle to write an in-depth feedback reddit post for Fallout's 76 PVP. It would be helpful, if you could give it a quick upvote, so that Bethesda can see it and act accordingly: "
---
So instead of writing a good post that everyone can agree upon you search for the backing of your community to push your agenda across? That's pretty low, "GerThunderlord"
---
Okay cool. I thought this was the case. Well good luck out there
---
I started my alt recently because I wanted to build a new camp in a totally different way but I don't want to loose the one I have. Only lvl 10 yet, but I'll have to get a lot of plans so... it'll be a while before I can build everything I want and have to start the next one...
---
Sometimes it 's a bug in the way the engage happens. I also go for any bounty and there were times were i hit someone with stealth and only did slap damage,like they were not wanted.  I don't think i ever fought a true assassin/sentinel, most people just die in 1 power shot of powerfist and i'm not bloodied.
---
Make the chassis legendary instead so you can use whatever armor pieces you want.
---
I cant See a Mention of system in your post unfortunatly but if you are xbox myself and a couple of friends typically run pvp most nights we are always on the lookout for people willing to listen and learn and will be more than happy to show you what other people have mentioned here in practical terms and help you understand the weaknesses of each of our 4 most common builds.
---
Let us know your system and timezone and i'll dm you my GT if it is xbox.
---
I only use my ghoul slayers gamma gun for buffing the ghouls at whitesprings whilst laughing maniacally from the top of the bus. 
---
I mean, we already carry around a screwdriver apparently. Just saying lol.
---
I could personally pop the locks with a knife easier than picking them with a bobby pin irl.
---
I wanted to know this too. Sadly no-one here has commented on it. I'll be checking myself soon when I get to that level though.
---
Same shit 
---
It doesn't appear your question, but I'm puzzled by how it seems to be that if I have pacifist on then I can't effectively fight back against an attack unless I go into the menus and switch it off. I would have thought that if I was taking damage I should automatically be able to defend myself. For context, the event I have in mind is when I was attacked with a knife while at a vendor. They stopped one blow short of killing me.
---
Another odd thing I noticed is that I tried shooting at somebody at a workshop while they were showing as the owner, but I got a message to the effect that I couldn't deal proper damage unless they responded. This also seems to contradict what I thought I knew about workshops, unless I got something wrong or was confused somehow.
---
In response to your actual query: I don't know, sorry.
---
It requires massive reworking of netcode and isn‚Äôt feasible. I agree, it‚Äôs a good idea, but unrealistic. It‚Äôs also another great example of people pushing too hard. Originally the game didn‚Äôt even tell you your camp couldn‚Äôt be placed. Then they had it tell you it couldn‚Äôt be placed. Now it gives you the option to find another world. When will it be enough? 
---
Not available on the consoles unfortunately. 
---
I mean I guess this is cool and all but Ultracite lore has already been established, and all of this is wrong according to it. 
---
I tend to open my map or pipboy as soon as I spawn in and it usually locks me up for a second, but it does eventually load in. The pipboy taking longer than the map but still only a few seconds on PS4. I also notice a lot when I go to a new area I have to load in for a second or I rubber band.
---
WHY ARE WE YELLING?
---
So...  I was doing that mission at the food processor plant tonight and two randos were there also doing the mission.  After getting stuck in a goddamned wall in the plant somehow, they were nice enough to clear the enemies nearby so I could fast travel away from the area.  We then teamed up and headed to my CAMP to repair stuff and I crafted a few items that they were interested in.    
---
One of the two guys drops a bag of stuff and tells me to pick up the items.  The Marine Armor Helmet was in it and he said to scrap it and I would learn the recipe.  I did, and he was right.  Then he says that apparently its a dev room item and I'm like...  f\*$k.  So I can make them now, and with 15 INT the crafted one had 13 damage resistance.  But I didn't make one for myself because now I'm concerned that if I'm running around with this apparent dev item on my person, I might get the ban hammer dropped on me.  I wonder if I should open a case with Bethesda asking what to do or if they can revert my character because honestly, I have zero interest in thing like exploits or cheats in games.  To me, it completely ruins the idea and spirit of the game in the first place.    
---
What do you all think?  
---
No my friend, that's just two different flavours of Hardcore. 
---
You buy the mods from the Enclave Bunker production terminals. They appear there randomly. Check every server hop. They take no materials to apply.
---
I would focus shotgun perks and not worry about putting perk points into melee. Melee is the only damage type that gains a direct boost from strength, so just let it gain it's benefit from your Special score, and turn your shotgun into a mid range monster. Plus Strength will give you more carry weight and it will leave you perk points available for Traveling Pharmacy, Pack Rat, and depending on power armor the sturdy frame. If not go with the perk that lowers the chassis weight of power armor. The only melee one I would go with is the weight reduction/ swing speed increase for either 1h or 2h, whichever you prefer. After that, go with maybe 5-6 points Intelligence, run Gunsmith all the time and swap out the other ones as you need them. Then get Thru Hiker for the 90% decrease to food and drink weight. If you rely heavily on vats I would dump all the points after that into grim reaper's sprint and other vats enhancing perks from luck.
---
Just a suggestion! The other guy said it in an asshole way, but his message is true. MMOs, even open world ones like FO76, kind of require you to specialize. On the bright side you can swap perk cards whenever, so since you'll have several points in perception also you could acquire the rifleman cards after you level cap and swap over to that later if you want. A two shot instigating explosive gauss rifle is literally like cheating if you have all the damage bonus perks and grim reaper's sprint and gun fu.
---
You come off as an elitist prick, but as an mmo veteran I have to agree with you. You could not be such an asshole about it though. You'll influence more people if you use honeybinstesd of vinegar. 
---
Look at Robbie Mueller over here digging random international vote manipulation up

---
To answer your Questions Pacifist only stops outgoing damage not incoming you are still able to be Slapped to death if your attacked so inclines. My usual advice is server hop if they are going to hit you that much its not worth sticking around.
---
Regarding workshops you can only ever do slap damage unless they are wanted or you are actively trying to take this from them you can do this by engaging with the workshop you know this as a contested progress bar will however and a greenoutline gets placed around the area that you have to remain inside to capture.
---
Yeah, that's... not an improvement, sorry. 
---
Unfortunately the acoustic instruments are stationary. If you want to actually carry one, it will have to be as a guitar sword :-/
---
Ok so like you‚Äôre *so close.* Within Hunter‚Äôs Ridge you can find various documents that reveal the location‚Äôs backstory. 
---
The area was occupied by various scavengers, namely Dylan, Ethan, and Carson. In Dylan‚Äôs *Unsent Letter* we find this passage: 
---
&gt; Woke up this morning and saw Ethan and Carson building a spike pit down at the bottom of the cliff. I asked them why they were building it and all they said was "for protection."
---
Then, in the *Hunter‚Äôs Journal*, we find this bit:
---
&gt; Last night Carson caught some lost couple out in the woods poaching one of our traps. I told him they didn't mean anything by it but he wouldn't listen. He tied them up and made them walk the plank that him and Ethan built last week. I thought he was just going to scare them a little but before I knew it he had shoved both of them off into the pit down below.
---
Finally, in the *Hunter‚Äôs Warning* we find the conclusion: 
---
&gt; If anyone is reading this, this place isn't safe anymore. I don't know what's been going on up at the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort, but not long after Ethan and Carson left to join them a group of men showed up and attacked our camp. I know Ethan was one of them. Even through the gas mask I could recognize that cough of his.
---
So, the pit is actually a brutal execution method, some lovely guys named Ethan and Carson built it, and we can assume they were infected with the Scorch Plague, explaining their slow descent into murderous insanity. 
---
When we can all place our camps amongst each other to build mini towns and cities ;)  NO RESTRICTIONS AHOY
---
but it's a legendary effect, not an explosive heavy gun (ie. fatman)
---
Ah! The workshop thing makes some sense, I have to go to claim it before I can fight them? I didn't know that and it fits what I experienced.
---
I wasn't terribly offended by the weirdo with the knife, it just seems strange that I can be attacked and shoot back but am ineffectual unless I go through the map and change some settings while it's happening. It seems like the obvious answer would be not fighting back takes slap damage which I understand, but if I do fight back, even if it is out of panic, then we become two players fighting and should surely be able to damage as such rather than being attached and not even bring able to slap. I may be wrong, there may be a reason for this, but I don't see it.
---
Thanks for the workshop explanation, anyway.
---
r/woosh
---
Hey, hang on. If Preston Garvey is in FO76, as well as FO4, then that means he must be a Synth!!
---
Maybe I wanna rebuild it but with the minde set of a enclave member or a raider? Or any other faction that dosnt want to get along with other factions xD 
---
I don‚Äôt know that much about the lore but for sure it makes sense to be pvp they just should also include factions
---
There are at least 15 bugged challenges in the game right now that make them impossible to complete.
---
Adding a challenge tracker before fixing the bugged challenges is a recipe to piss off a lot of players.
---
I'm lvl 11 and I'm slowly making my way through. I can usually be on in the evenings and weekends CST PSN beetlejuice\_27
---
Yeah, I wasn't bragging about a conquest. My suggestion was much like what you suggested. 
---
I feel attacked. I realized this at level 4o that there is a cap.
---
I have a sentinel+assassin chest piece. I would not sell it for 25k caps (max caps). I would trade it for a left leg with sentinel+assassin. There is no secure way to do an item for item trade. 
---
This I honestly thought I was going mad the 1st time I heard that
---
There is a cheap mele "low hp tank" power armor build fo76 reddit post.
---
Not sure what you mean by server wise. However powering up a powerplant will only affect the current server you are on. 
---
If it‚Äôs been powered up you will see smoke billowing from the towers. It only powers up when someone completes the process. It doesn‚Äôt stay powered up forever. And if the event fails it takes a few hours before it can be attempted again. 
---
Okay so if you have power to the boxes, someone else did it on the server before you joined?
---
You can buy them from Watoga BoS Vendor Phoenix. You can also got them from events rewards and/or treasure maps (low chance).
---
I've gotten the two plan pieces, helmet and left leg, from treasure maps.   I do have an extra t51 helmet plan though if you're interested.   I'm on xbox 
---
I knew about Pheniox but I wanted the plans to make the armour
---
Correct.
---
Or Free to entry, but you are always sending back into place, where you just were and if you want to stay in event location, then it cost caps. 
---
I believe the OP is specifically asking for the PA parts and not the MOD/Upgrades. The PA parts are only available from the events or trade. The upgrades are available from the vendor. 
---
Helmet plan? If so that's perfect I am to
---
*Even me with High level Endurance Vanguard Build* 
---
I'm not saying it's right but currently damage resistance means nothing in PvP. With the right anti-armor perks and weapons your damage resistance is essentially 0 and without sentintel/assassin you will get one shotted by people with the right setup.
---
You can counter the sentintel/assassin effect with criticals and staggering, if you are not setup to do this and you are PvPing someone in Sentinel then I would just give up. I personally feel like something needs to be changed not because it's unfair/unbalanced but because it's going to be a pretty darn boring PvP experience if everyone is sat still with sentinel on waiting 30 minutes for someone to move so they can shoot them :-)
---
Have a friend/trusted individual act as an escrow. Boom, problem solved. 
---
Makes sense, have you ever had any bugs where you didn‚Äôt get power after completing the event? This has happened to me. Especially at Poseidon itself.
---
I didn‚Äôt think to look at the exhaust towers. Great advice to look for before taking workshops. 
---
just curious - isn't it cheaper and easier to jump to spawn places and collect all the parts? PA has so high durability, that it doesn't really matter if it's crafted with high INT or collected from the wild?
---
How rare is the pink asylum hat? That dropped for me yesterday in a random horde event in the ash heap
---
Yeah it only weighs 6 pounds but the ammo tho! That's the killer, imo there launchers in the game need a serious buff or the ammo needs to be lighter it's not viable to carry one
---
Or how about they implement just an easy fix that trades item(s) for item(s). You seriously just need to add one more confirmation screen to make it work. Why do we continue to work around Bethesda's glaring issues instead of Bethesda just instituting a fix?
---
I can tell you I've def seen someone get scammed before by using a middle man. The irony is the guy that got scammed was holding armor hostage that he scammed off another guy. This should probably just get fixed
---
Sorry for the late reply, but I found this post on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uiugc/minigun_spawn_located

I would prefere if PvP for workshops were limited to the workshop and the close area around it. After having claimed a workshop and set it up to help new players I was one-shotted on the other side of the map after having gathered a lot of junk. Since then I only claim workshops if there's a challenge for it and I immediately serverhop after claiming it. I will never build up workshop areas for low levels or have them as a free fast travel have-them-or-loose-them points as I used to.
---
Yes but i only had to rewire from the box to the appliance.

Oh I see! Like taking the ladder out of the pool in the Sims. Tricky.

Why don‚Äôt you hop on your computer and code it up Steven Hawking? Interesting that such a ‚Äúsimple fix‚Äù isn‚Äôt present as a mod for PC‚Ä¶

Pretty sure the trade happens server side. That's why when the server lags it says "trade failed on server." This is beyond what modders can do, I'd think. This needs to happen on bethesda's end
---
Which would make them wanted anyway and I don't think anyone think wanted characters should be able to go into pacifist.
---
Totally agree. It serves no purpose and isn't funny 
---
Empathy do u take 25 percent more damage even if ur not in a team do you know?
---
You do, but if you know the recipe you just drink one every hour to skirt around that. 
---
I've been extremely suicidal and even when drowning in the thoughts I've always found suicide jokes hilarious, but each for their own I guess. 
---
Again. Hop on your computer, mod up the barter system and then send the code to Bethesda. If it‚Äôs so simple. 
---
That time limit used to be called server stability. Nowdays you don't get the disconnect every evening of playing. Bethesda succeeded in improving that at least.
---
no u
---
I'd really love to see some official word on these. Like a "verification" process for "approved" mods. I'm okay with risking crashes or mod blacklists, but having no guarantees you won't get banned for using them is kinda worse than outright disallowing them altogether.
---
Same here. I delete one of the power connectors then remake it and it works.

Wear a hazmat and avoid melee. Find objects to stand on that can't be reached by Monday and tag everything. The wall around the swimming pool is a great spot.

easy way to get steel is to farm whitesprings.  the golf clubhouse has 4 sets of tin can chimes, which is 36 cans.  each gives lead and steel.  a couple runs and you will be set for a while.

That would only be ok if every day there was a challenge for atoms saying something like "Play for an hour in pacifist mode".

Hmm I have not had this happen. I have not been able to learn a plan that says known and all unknown were in fact unknown. What plans have done it I will see if I already know any of them then try to buy a copy of it and see what happens.
---
What purpose does a joke serve if not to amuse the audience? I think it's just that, a line of writers dark humor, some people find it funny, other's don't. 
---
Bethesda needs to do some changes in PvP. That I think we all can agree on. What ideas should get implemented is up to debate, hence this post. If more people can see this then so be it. It's not like Bethesda would go through the hassle to look for random YT-vids.
---
Can you tell us I wasnt able to find it.
---
You‚Äôre supposed to want to KILL these things. I think the more inappropriate they act/speak. The more realistic their character is. I don‚Äôt think of the script as ‚Äúsomething Bethesda wrote‚Äù, I think ‚Äúcan you believe what Col Gutsy just said? I‚Äôm taking him out!‚Äù.
---
Exactly
---
üò≠
---
I‚Äôm sorry, what? You‚Äôre playing an M rated game and you‚Äôre upset about a single line about suicide? Dude, there‚Äôs suicide all over this fucking game. You can find tons of remains of people who clearly killed themselves. I‚Äôm sorry if it offends you but this idea of escapism into a game filled with murder, drugs, betrayal and suicide might not be right for you. I‚Äôve been extremely suicidal in the past and I have no issue with this line. I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre in a bad place right now, but it‚Äôs just reality. 
---
As someone who actually tried committing suicide years ago when in a giant custody battle over my son I see your point but you have to take it with a grain of salt. People will laugh at it and others will be extremely offend. If people start calling out all the lines that offended them in video games and ask to get it removed then we would be a In censored world where free speech doesn‚Äôt reign over peoples feelings. I personally do not like the line at all, like I said I‚Äôve been there and it‚Äôs a dark place but people can‚Äôt call for a removal because it‚Äôs triggering someone. If that happened game after game would have to censored and remove lines that offend players who have to be 17+ to play a game like this anyway so if you don‚Äôt like it you don‚Äôt have to play it. I hope you never get to that dark place ever again in your life and God Bless. Pleas don‚Äôt take this post the wrong way. 
---
The key difference is that this can be harmful when it misses the mark. Back in my twenties I would of laughed at this line all day everyday as well. I do indeed have a dark sense of a humor, I worked in EMS for 10 years. I dunno though, every time I drop a nuke I truly hate hearing this line. 
---
Yeah we read your post.
---
Bear Arms is already a very good weight reduction perk at 3 points. At one would make it jokingly good, esp. since many heavy weapons actually weigh LESS than many rifles that have no weight reduction perk.
---
OK great. I'm at work now until about 5 Eastern standard time but I'll be on tonight if that works for you. Just send me direct message with your gamer tag and we'll figure out a price
---
Well you can take my word as a random internet guy, I have been using mods since mods became available for FO76 (when Better Inventory released). I have not yet been banned and I play daily. If Bethesda didn't want us using mods all they would have to do is stop parsing the custom ini file you create to load them, and they haven't.  Or not load random ba2 files, and they haven't. Or check the signature of the existing ba2 files, and they haven't. They are clearly not worried about client side mods.
---
Pretty sure it will be a race from A-B-C etc and not just running around a course ala Mcintlock and Firebreather test
---
Not all lvl 100 plus players are monsters to be feared.  Most will throw you a bone or, at the very least,  leave you be.
---
But really we are all like
---
 This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build,  This is my melee build, 
---
I understand the dislike for that line, I do. But then if we stop to vet everything. Should  we remove any line that involves you being told to hurt others? Can be as bad if not worse with some wording. Then being told anything that is negative. In FO76 there's Rose, who's a junky. Keeps telling people to use stuff. Ex-addicts might find her hard to listen to as well. 
---
Not trying to shit in your idea and point. But i feel if people are not strong enough to here this stuff don't play the games with it in. Slap a warning in it if need be. But that's it. I don't understand the mindset. So my knowledge is slightly squiffy. 
---
If suicidal stuff can't be joked ablaut in an obvious manner, then we can't joke about murder, like most games were you kill off whole load of people.
---
Nerf staggers, but make them less necessary would be my idea. As mentioned somewhere here before you can stagger enemy comabatants with Explosives too. And stationary targets are quite easy to bomb. And I doubt that you need an Auto Aim Mechanic to deal with other players. VATS was needed in the older Fallouts like Fallout 3 because the aim was horrendous. And all previous games were SPs, where stuff like Infinite ressources are no issue. Multiplayers however have to be bit stricter due to the fact that a somewhat equal ground should be established.
---
All valid points, I'm glad you have no issues with it. I responded earlier that as I was younger this is a line that wouldn't bother me at all. It would make me want to "kill the gutsy more" as someone else said. It probably hits more close to home and way off the mark to me due to my past work experience if anything. 
---
There needs tp be something above ‚Äòsingle thumbs up‚Äô
---
Ive never seen a post like this before, its incredible and adds so much that hasn't already been constantly said over and over again. Great use of everyone's time.
---
Ok so still an accurate example of life after the apocalypse but I had the lore wrong given I had found it from the bottom and not the top. 
---
Meh, not really a fan. I have like 300 screws and can't really use more than I find.
---
I can understand your thoughts on this OP. But have you been through basic military training in the US prior to about 1990? Before  1990 the drill instructors would yell at recruits in basic training much like the Gutsy yells at your character. They would use awful, foul language and suggestions. They would call out you, your mother, your sister, ect. And if you were deemed slow, fat, clumsy, or holding up the progress of your platoon, they might just utter a line similar the the line you find offensive. Political Correctness, and to a lesser degree the inclusion of women in combat training has cut down this type of verbal abuse.
---
I don't think Bethesda was trying to "trigger" anyone intentionally by including the line in the Gutsy dialog. And from your statements it seems that you believe the inclusion was an oversight or a poor choice at best. Personally, if someone is that much on the edge, they need to seek physiological help rather than play a video game. 
---
If you or someone is struggling emotionally,  please call the US National Suicide Prevention Hot line at 1-800-273-8255. 
---
I would suggest west forest in the beginning.  Try to make lots of water.  Look for soot flower in the forest, and bloodleaf along the coastline. Those two together make healing salve.  Until you've played a bit and are swimming in stimpaks, it's a great and easy to acquire healing item. 
---
752!? Mine is 513 at 10% health! How do you get to 752
---
Dark Humor is a fundamental aspect of the fallout universe. I'm sorry it makes you feel this way but jokes like this belong to the core of the game theme. Changing this will also change alot of what fallout universe is about. Finding the humor of cooping in a dark apocalyptic world.
---
I actually find people disagreeing with me here comforting in a way. That said I won't ever find the line funny but having more perspective / view points on it is good. Removal is indeed probably unreasonable for a multitude a reasons in hindsight I agree with since this is flat out an M rated game. 
---
Having just done this, this is what I did. Note this was not a bloodied build.
---
First, get the best legendary 30 or so 2H melee weapon. Instigating is great here. 
---
Second, grab whatever power armor. Your STR may not be above 10, this will help. Toss on the generic +2 STR.
---
Third, load up whatever applicable melee perk cards you have. If you aren‚Äôt a melee build, you may have some already from packs. Incisor, Martial Artist, etc.
---
Fourth, the loop. Start at one end (like the shopping mall). Head out left, hit the small set of cottages, then pool house, then club house, then the long row of cottages to the end, then through the laundry and back to the shopping market inside to scrap, sell and/or repair. 
---
Fifth, on each pass snag some water, food from the club house / pool (melon, mutfruit, whatever is in there) and from some of the cottages on the way (carrot / soot flowers) and glowing meat, etc. Ragstag if it is there by the club house. You‚Äôll make a new set of food inside the artisan‚Äôs corner.
---
If possible, snag whatever XP food / perks as well (rejuvenated etc.)
---
With a decent amount of melee perks, I did most of this w/ a legendary multi purpose level 30 axe. Power attack on the 50+, normal on the 42s. If there are no high levels around you‚Äôre looking at 32s or 22s, those are easy enough to deal with.
---
PvE servers when?
---
Thanks for that!Such a releif they are working on that.
---
pink is the least common but it wont sell for much unless you find the pink dress to go with it. 
---
I *think* rarity wise as far as outfits are concerned it's pink, then green, yellow, brown, blue, red, white
---
Wasn't this posted yesterday?
---
I‚Äôll try.  I‚Äôve never seen anything stunning yet. Even when I left the vault and looked down.  What is your system and resolution?   It‚Äôs not just the graphics that kill immersion and enjoyment  for me. For example, last night I look down at a town and see enemies standing frozen. It‚Äôs not until I get near that they start to move.   It just kills immersion to see so blatantly that they aren‚Äôt going to move at all (even arms) until I get in their immediate area.   Then it‚Äôs rinse and repeat until a new area of the town.  Now I am low level so not sure if it gets better. 
---
Can i buy it i love crossbows my psn is pappododo 
---
They really need to fix it!
---
You‚Äôre amazing! THANK YOU!
---
I‚Äôll be on later tonight EST. My account name is JawaJive.
---
Wait a minute, energy weapons aren't affected by gunsmith?!
---
Thanks for the tip. This is very helpful to know moving forward.
---
I wear a power armor... wood box? smash! suite case? ripp off! Wood door? tshuuu tshuuu! nuff said? XD
---
Suicidal depressive here, hospitalised multiple times and that line made me laugh and caused Zero offence
---
You're getting triggered over nothing. A literal non-issue you're blowing up to tumblr-levels of outrage
---
THIS! This is the major reason I want this to be addressed. The UX is terrible for things like this and makes it all too easy for mistakes to happen - even when you‚Äôre being careful.
---
which only gave a small advantage for a week. And even then didn't apply to most as many players are solo. 
---
STR is first, you want intelligence to atleast 9 to get all the damage perks out of that. That's pretty much the most of the damage perks your going to be getting for melee so then spread as you want. 
---
Once you get to a high level it's not neccessarily about getting as much points into the stat just so you can use everything at once because you don't want to keep passive perks on that you aren't using at the time for example Hacking I just put that in whenever I get to a console. The reason you spread your points so that at a minimum you can use the perk combinations from that stat you need. Like I can change my perks and completely switch the build without changing my stats. If you use fallout planner iirc you can pre build your character and see exactly how much you need in each stat. 
---
I would add if you are more melee agility isn't actually all that helpful and certainly not worth wasting 15 points in. You only really need 3 for the marathon perk.
---
Same. Would be nice to have more end game camp items.
---
Then you should probably uninstall. The level of graphical quality you're looking for is rarely done well, and doesn't come from BGS. Obscure shit to bitch about IMO.
---
I‚Äôm a little worried about being punished for using mods, but the fact that a fix for this exists on the Nexus means that it‚Äôs entirely possible for Bethesda to address this fairly easily.
---
 Nice. 
---
Same concern. I‚Äôd like it to be impossible to sell equipped items. At least then there would be another layer of safety.
---
You can get them via treasure maps too. I would say personally this is the main way.
---
Gatling gun is better
---
I did that before and had no luck. Is it any specific reigon like the forest or savage divide
---
Not at all, I'm actually pleasantly surprised by posts like this. I'm glad you are still here!
---
Thats evil
---
I like it
---
I‚Äôm still not sure that I sold my All Rise. I had the same thing happen with my Prototype Hazmat Suit where it was just no longer in my inventory. I‚Äôm really careful when selling, so I‚Äôm perplexed as to how this could have happened.
---
how many did you do? I do like 200+ at a time and average about 1 every 30. 
---
Like 5 lol. I'll buy treasure maps for like around 10 caps, you can boost the price up if that's not resnoble 
---
There are also 2 others sites for iron nearby the spawn point at Hornwright. From the spawn point head towards the white tower in the distance. from that tower head towards the top of the hill kinda leftish from there.   
---
I'll post a video of the 3 clusters exact locations when i get home from work. Its usually over 400 ore in excavator PA.
---
The easy way to counter VATS is to crouch. Every character can do it without any perks or levels. There's much more strategy to this than there is in traditional FPS. That's always been a focal point in fallout games, so stripping these systems under some notion of balance is trying to strip the fallout elements out of fallout 76.
---
You forgot that laser weapons have no recoil and fire in a literally perfect strait line. 
---
They are probably lighter too being made of mostly plastic. 
---
I think they would actually have more maintenance issues though. There's a lot of delicate parts in a laser rifle. 
---
I don't think I'm being *that* extreme on the issue but in hindsight I did overlook other things in this game that would cause the same issues over different subjects as has been pointed out. 
---
&gt;the game can not determine camp status until you have actually connected to a server
---
Exactly right, so this won't happen
---
If the event fails you can still power up the plant, it just doesn't give any rewards besides power to the boxes.
---
Servers haven't crashed for me once in over a month. I think its more likely your connection/build that is causing you problems.    
---
The say "server stability improvements" because for most people they have greatly improved. Bitching like this doesn't help, its just annoying.
---
I have learned Short Gamma Gun, Gauss Rifle, Short Laser Pistol, Short Plasma Pistol, and Salvaged Assaultron Head, so those are ‚Äúout there‚Äù. WHERE I couldn‚Äôt possibly remember though.
---
I have the opposite happening. Plans are showing known so I open up camp menu to build it and it tells me to find plans to build this. Very frustrating.  I have turned in a ticket but they have not addressed it. 1 is large toolbox and other is military cot. Who know how many others I have dropped for other players to have that I actually have not learned yet. 
---
Still waiting more contents...
---
Level up butchers bounty and get TWO meat piles. 
---
Because some of the PvP players want to prey on the weak PvE players, especially low level who haven't really learnt how to play yet. Those are the ones we hear about here from time to time. Griefers won't have fun slugging it out at equal terms in a PvP environment.
---
I dont sell my treasure maps and on pc I buy them for around 50 caps ea. it's not a cheap investment. good luck!
---
I've had this happen with plans like water purifier that are learned in some way other than reading plans, such as learning via terminal entries. It also happened with a few ultracite armor pieces. Haven't seen it happen with mods I learned from scrapping.
---
Ok. Thank you
---
I don‚Äôt do these things, but what I am pointing out is that if you make CAMPs indestructible then these are the possibilities that could be done by griefers.
---
&gt; Suicide should never be a joking matter, its how those we truly care about end up being lost to us forever. 
---
Where do you draw the line then? Either everything is okay to make fun of, or nothing is. If the game constantly  telling me to kill myself, maybe its valid, but one voice line isn't a big issue for me.
---
They do get one shotted! I think my previous line of work makes me see this line for something more sinster then it was ever intended to be. 
---
Would you really trust a machine that's been sitting there, presumably unmaintained, for up to 25 years following a nuclear war?
---
u get alot of other plans and weapons armor to scrap too. so I'd recommend doing this at least twice. like 400 plus. 
---
My point exactly. It shouldn't be. It's an antiquated relic. It shouldn't be better than a minigun (FOR ANY REASON) The Gatling gun blows donkey dick. I have one that I use when I run out of grenades. I hate that slow firing garbage. I want to throw caution to the wind and spray my enemies with reckless abandon but alas I can not at this time
---
You should still be able to transfer the unusable higher-level  pieces into the frame.  You won‚Äôt be able to enter the PA, but let it sit there and it will auto-recall to your inventory in a minute or so.  Then you can move it from your inventory to your stash.  The PA with whatever pieces will weigh 10lbs, instead of the sum of the frame plus each individual piece.
---
Again, only hang on to PA if you‚Äôre going to use it, and be very selective about it.  You will find more as you wander the wastelands.
---
Well if you do go in to a nuke silo everyday the game actually is going to tell you that :o That said, Its one botched line and you are correct in were do we draw the line type deal. 
---
I did a poll on people wanting NPCs in the gane a while ago and it was nowhere near that figure just FYI, ill try and find it
---
Reinstall your gpu drivers with the latest version, when prompted go for advanced options and perform a clean installation. Then in Nvidia control panel global settings, change power mode to adaptive, and change the limit fps to unlimited.
---
As someone already said put the game in fullscreen.
---
Re-enable your page file if you've turned it off.
---
Turn shadow distance to minimum
---
Go into C:/users/you/my games/fallout76 and delete every file ending in .cfg except for the control map one.
---
Carefully monitor your system resources, with task manager or more advanced tools like hwinfo or hwmonitor, have a look if something is creating a large bottleneck. Pay attention to CPU, RAM, GPU load and VRAM
---
Verify you don't have anything malicious installed like a cryptominer that's eating system resource
---
Good info, thanks mate!
---
Just use the barn building set. It looks super clean
---
Make sure the game is not trying to run on an integrated graphics card.  When the game first came out it was not recognizing nvidia cards and it had to be changed manually.  I'm not sure if it was ever fixed.
---
Remove any overclocks
---
Monitor your component temps for thermal throttling. Anything over 80c will usually cause this
---
On the tools tab of my trade spreadsheet, ive built a kinda sorta (not really at all ) similar tool for calculating ammo costs by resource. Could prob adapt it to something similar

Until the minigun gets the love it deserves from the devs, you should try out a 50 Cal. I have a 2 shot 50 Cal and it feels great unloading with it. I can't wait to see what happens with the minigun next week though
---
So much this!
---
There's people looking at who owns a workshop that then just hunt down the owners and who dont really care about the workshop. They never build anything themselves or bother about it. They just use them to force PvP.
---
I have a couple legendary 50 Cal. But I've never used them. Maybe I'll give them a try
---
[https://www.strawpoll.me/17367055/r](https://www.strawpoll.me/17367055/r) im in mobile so that link might not work, but it was "Do you think NPCs should be added to FO76?" Yes = 69% No = 31%
---
My understanding is that once you put something in the vending machine, it‚Äôs for sale to everyone, kinda like the the Grand Exchange on Runescape. At least that‚Äôs how the wording on the roadmap made it seem. 
---
If that‚Äôs the case, if your looking for something in particular, you would just search from your vending machine. 
---
I could very well be wrong, but that‚Äôs just the vibe I got from the statements given so far. And if that‚Äôs the case, there really wouldn‚Äôt be a need for trading subs unfortunately. 
---
One rank of adrenaline is very good.  More than one rank is a waste.  Bloody mess is the other big one. Travelling pharmacy is the best for weight reduction.  Starched genes is a must.  Not having marsupial is just bad. 
---
not very helpful considered there's no images and the ported barrel would have a different name in 76
---
The bunker alone sells three energy weapon plans. They are out there. 
---
...and at reduced power, correct?
---
It's a Furious, Explosive, Gatling, with a 500 round magazine.
---
The weapon takes damage from enemies, so if I don't  get mobbed, it will sometimes make it through about 600 rounds, but that's an exception, not the rule.
---
Yes, barn set is very nice and tidy - I used it before I switched to brick with clean walls mod.
---
Thanks for the post.  I don‚Äôt agree with you, but you started a great conversation about how speech should be dealt with in games, and you remained civil and open to discussion.  Kudos and I wish you well.
---
This is all great advice, cheers dude. Thanks for the extra information too, I've been to a few nuke zones but just die pretty sharpish so I'll definitely take your advice on board.
---
So when they say theyre gonna "drop the hammer" theyre not reffering to a nuke theyre reffering to an actual hammer
---
Tank killer doesn‚Äôt work with energy damage, energy weapons don‚Äôt really have much going for them in the way of helpful perks. The Gauss does ballistic damage. 
---
Not that I know of. I only did it one time and only checked the power output at the plant's workshop
---
Lol I use excavator armor at level 364
---
Really interesting, I really can't think why people wouldn't want them. Atleast just some raiders to shoot up even if there's no friendly NPC's. I really liked the robot raider dudes (I forget the name) in FO4
---
Quest rewards that give plans will say ‚ÄúPlan: XXX‚Äù even if you know it. The only problem with this is getting all excited about getting a new plan and then having your hopes dashed. 
---
Yeah no idea, i think adding NPCs would be great even if just for variety sake
---
Seeing as I trusted it 65 years after the war yes. 
---
So a gatling laser gets x5 or x2 durability increase? Or x7? Maybe x10?
---
Also please fix their fusion core issue. Lock a fusion code to a gun and remember it across weapon changes and logins... If I have 2 gatling lasers, then I lock 2 unique, separate fusion cores. Please? Also fix them eating fusion cores unless you reload a new one immediately after raising the weapon each time it's changed... Would also be nice if my PA wouldn't be auto loading ultracite fusion cores... 
---
Thank you in advance.
---
A Gatling Laser lover. 
---
How can such a wise comment be downvoted?
---
Gatling is actually a very good gun. It's my go-to SBQ gun and has been for months. Packs a lot of punch. Heavy gunner, stabilized and one man army are your perks.
---
As an explosive only player I was extremely happy to find a lvl 45 two shot fatman and then extremely disappointed to find out my friends hammer does more damage than 2 goddamn nukes.
---
I think red is the rarest for the outfits, unless I'm misreading your comment.
---
It is definitely a much more direct and abrasive reference than anywhere else in the game.
---
It would take a very sensitive and unstable person to be hurt by this, but those people exist.
---
I wouldn't mind if Bethesda got this line removed, it's not going to be missed.
---
I already like it without perks and mods, noticed i dont have a single mod unlocked lol
---
x1.1 damage is better than vanilla, but super-weak for a prefix effect. 
---
It‚Äôs weak compared to a secondary effect - exploding and fire rate raise DPS by x1.25 in comparison..
---
Its massively underpowered compared to other prefix effects - Bloodied is a non situational x1.9 (on a rad build). Anti Armor is an effective x2 against any enemy with half decent DR. x1.1 is nothing to write home about.
---
Thank you! It seems like it's still the same with explosive shot (normal and explosive) since its damage buff comes from the two perks (rifleman and explosives expert). But if the gauss rife does ballistic, does that mean tank killer does work on gauss rifles? 
---
Well, while each nuke dropped by the MIRV has a lower base damage than the one nuke from a regular Fat Man, that's still a *miniature nuclear detonation*. Even if you only hit that Deathclaw with a single one of them, I think it should do more than just annoy the beastie. 
---
*Quadruples
---
Yeah, meanwhile you slaughter hundreds of creatures. Why don‚Äôt you get peta involved? 
---
You can "counter" Red Dead Onlines Auto Aim too. Can you see anyone thinking its the perfect system? Imo Fallouts PvP, just like any other, needs to make most builds and guns viable, but still provide some sort of counterplay as seen with low level pvp. Especially there you cant do much due to non-oneshot setups, which makes Healspam all the more viable. So even IF we were to copy paste everything into Survival you could only do shit with oneshots because else they' d outheal any damage. Did you play PvP where everyone can oneshot eachother with no effort? Trust me, it's not much fun in the long run.
---
Is there at least an hd texture pack?
---
K
---
Yeah, I watched a guy build a camp a similar distance to mine (maybe 5 camp radius away). I went over and said hello. We added each other as friends, but now we can‚Äôt join each other‚Äôs worlds because the two camps are too close!  They weren‚Äôt too close to build them initially. 
---
One tip for you, take it to the nuke silo when you go. At the part where you have to destroy the mainframe cores use it to shoot them for speed.
---
It's something to do with the explosive damage radius but 1 shot at a whole Bank of cores will destroy them all. 
---
You can do super fast speed runs using this and other techniques
---
And that god damn #DOOOHH DAA DUUHHH DA DAAAAAHH
---
Which plays *every* time...
---
I'm level 20 and haven't completed that quest.  Is it possible solo?
---
Absolutely lol
---
Yes. My tren did it &lt;50 then when he hit 50 he did it again got the all rise at his level 
---
I‚Äôve tested and tank killer seems to work on gauss rifle. As it‚Äôs firing a metal slug. 
---
in a box at Whitespring when I was going through the place, on my way to Mountains.
---
You're super paranoid dude. They've explicitly stated the vending machines can be built in camps.
---

You have been randomly selected as a lucky winner of the Great Appalachian Sweepstakes!
---
Please accept your prize. 
---
^*The Great Appalachian sweepstakes would like to remind you of your outstanding balance of $500,723. Swift payment is appreciated*
---
Nice! I‚Äôm a mix of both.
---
‚ÄúThis is my shotgun build‚Äù ... It‚Äôs also my Firebreather, I only use Fire Axes, etc.
---
‚ÄúThis is a melee build‚Äù ... also my low-tech mechanic. Any weapon that looks like it has extraneous crap on it is what I use. Hammers with rockets and spikes. Harpoon gun.  Raider PA most of the time.
---
‚ÄúThis is my rifle build‚Äù ... also ... BLUE. Vault-Tec power armor, blue headlamp, blue everything.
---
I mean, you can kinda do both.
---
Team up, or take your chances.
---
Simply, yes!
---
Perfect, thank you both! I've been moving points around and didn't know if I could get rid of tank killer or not. 
---
I wait about 1.5 seconds after activating it and never miss a 95% (for small arms) but I believe projectiles like plasma a gauss shots connect less often due to how the projectile has to travel to the target. 
---
gauss works well with armor piercing effects because it's damage is not energy.
---
I was super pissed when they nerfed critical savvy on the first patch. And as good as it was it was nowhere near as degenerate as the two shot explosive guns.  Most people go on about how strong melee is (personally I think melee sucks) they haven't touched that. 
---
Tank killer is too good to pass up. The same can be said  about the rifleman being all level 1 vs maxed. %60 is too good. 
---
Yeah the 2mm ammo is the battery and and rounds for it. I had to dig for the information on that. 
---
Gun is ballistic and ammo is energy. 
---
The more you know. 
---
If all you have are comments that you find my tone distasteful, then I am right and I don't care how my words make you feel. Welcome to the Internet, kiddo. Enjoy your stay.
---
well what would ruin it for me is if adrenal reaction isn't working because there's no point in having a low health build otherwise, bloodied sledgehammer notwithstanding
---
How is your ammo consumption? I have only 1400 fuel after a long time playing and really want to use this weapon, but it‚Äôs one of the most expensive ammo to craft. It almost feels like they made a mistake with the ammo yield. 5? Should be 25-50. 
---
What CAMP plans? Even then, why would I need some decorative CAMP plans, my CAMP already looking nice and decorated.
---
Ah I hadn't read that detail or read over it. I kind of hope not, I thought the idea of people having to visit your camp and having at least some semblance of trading posts would be great for the community and player interaction. 
---
If it's like a system wide bazaar it's just a trading sub with less player interaction. 
---
Sure!
---
I've been using a explosive, anti armor ultracite rifle with tank killer and when I found out just how wrong using that rifle is, I switched to a quad ammo explosive gauss rifle and didn't want to make the same mistake lok
---
_All_ his armour...? I'm with OP that we need to be able to lock items but come on, if you're doing that you need to pay more attention to what you're doing. I'd blame that on tiredness 
---
Would be nice too.
---
The water purifier plans are the ones I see this happening with the most.
---
 As long as the mod does not give you a tactical advantage  or extra items or things in the Atom shop I would not be concerned at this time.  This mod only locks items so they cannot be sold. No advantage there. Bethesda actually incorporates some mods into the game. There was a mod that listed known plans before Bethesda included that feature in the game. There are higher res maps that give no advantage except for blind people like me and some change the hud layout. None of these give you an advantage as a player. Some turn sounds off and others just change sounds to something different.
---
I feel you. I rather like laser rifles. I have one as a backup only repair it twice a day and if that. 
---
I normally leave tank killer on especially if I need to pick up a rifle when I‚Äôm out .45 for my lever and didn‚Äôt bring my laser. 
---
Well that is what I was responding to.

Back before the patch that gave all plans to vendors, I got a handmade plan from the quest and I was level 60 something
---
u/ladydevann any thoughts about making team groups larger? Many of us play at the same time and it sometimes becomes very difficult to coordinate when members are on separate teams. We then have to turn on pacifist mode when running multiple teams which leads to other issues when situations arise that require that setting to be turned off. Like forced pvp I have died before trying to get the setting turned off so that I could protect myself? It would be great if team sizes were increased.
---
Pfft good grief dude. Start playing again and you‚Äôll have it stitched up in no time. The reason you said it feels like a long shot is because you know you‚Äôre not even playing. Hell start over, you‚Äôre not even that far along if you quit way back then. That was like the first or second patch. 
---
It might be a reference to us using nukes again,didn‚Äôt we leave vault 76 to rebuild?
---
He is a bit more sentient than most of the other protectron traider bots.  He's genuinely depressed about being there, but is trying to make the most of it... since his programming dictates that he never leave.
---
I always try to make it a point to visit him each day.
---
Sons of dane compound, upstairs in the main house. I do one violent night quest all the time. 
---
Charleston fire department, where all the lead is. There's one by the crafting tables. 
---
Those are the ones I hacked over and over to get that trophy.  Nuke silos too are good.
---
This could work. 
---
Having a mail box could add value at your camp. 
---
You could MAIL Items between your toons without having a 3rd party (*friend or random strangers) to help.
---
You could upgrade your mailbox weight restrictions like you do utilities, like generators or electrical connections or water.
---
Yeah you can actually place those spring traps. Why they made them so hard wire on the ground is beyond me. 
---
Teach us oh lord!
---
thats awesome, never thought of this, doing it today!
---
I prefer your approach. 
---
For me it's 'this is my 'how can I carry more stuff and wear the same leather out-fit I wore in FO4' build.
---
I'll be interested to read how they implement this. My most reasonable guess is dropping your level and SPECIALs  to 1, while letting you keep your perk cards. Then you'd either get to make some perk card "legendary", get to pick a "legendary" perk card from a separate selection or a "trait" style separate feature.
---
The legendary transform for perk cards would probably be the most forward thinking, as to get your full setup to max you'd need to get to lv50 dozens of times. Something to work towards, though some would probably just monotonously grind some single efficient place to get there (personally I don't see the appeal).
---
As for myself, I'm looking forward to this. Early levels were awesome when there was so much to accomplish and everything was scary. Getting to do it again but still feel like I'm making progress sounds fun.
---
Im spec'd for rifles and pistols so until I got the gauss i only used laser rifles but after hearingetting  (and seeing) how bad they are i had to switch.
---
But does that mean gauss rifles are getting the 10% damage buff? (The damage is ballistic and ammo counts as energy but what class is the gun itself?)
---
no worries man :) I always grab any power armor stuff when I find it...
---
I just killed a 3 star legendary deathclaw at WS. 3 shots from my explosive modded shotgun and I dropped him. 
---
It probably would have taken 10 mini nukes to take him out lol 
---
How can one join you? 
---
Were you the guys close to vault 76 trading yesterday? Lvl100+ and one low level?
---
It has happened once when I bought the Gatling laser from a Vendor but usually happens when I pick up a plan. I know it has happened at least 4 times in 3 weeks. I am just worried it will happen if I spend lots of caps.
---
Was it the tactical helmet?
---
The gauss rifle or coil gun normally in the real world are ballistic. They fire a slug or piece of metal or even a metal ball bearing. 
---
Take a stroll on YT and see some vids. 
---
The fallout version is from what I can see is ballistic. 
---
This is why I as lvl 156 like to hang out with a couple of lvl 200+ friends. People see our dots on the map, realize that even if high level means nothing to how powerful your character is, the chance of having that super weapon increases, and that does...
---
Would love this.
---
It is usually plans I pick up, normally I leave them, unless of course I haven't learned them.
---
I snagged two of the red before I ever knew they were hard to come by. I've yet to come across a pink uniform and only 1 pink hat since I've been farming them.
---
I don‚Äôt see upgrades other than cosmetics.  
---
Is your headset USB?  I use a Blue Snowball USB mic.  It doesn't have a mute button and push to talk can be a pain in combat so I put a switch on the USB cable to turn it on and off.  Point being, I am basically plugging and unplugging my USB mic all the time and it works fine with Fo76.  
---
I havent had many issues with server disconnects since the last update. Crash to desktops on the other hand are getting far worse (had maybe 1-2 prior to patch 6. i get at least 1 every 3ish hours now. Not heat, load or hardware related afaict. Ive been heavily monitoring/logging since i replaced my GPU fans \~4 weeks ago.  Every other game i play runs fine for hours on end under higher temps/load.)
---
Don‚Äôt forget the bonus benefit of accidentally standing too close and killing yourself while doing no damage to your enemy
---
As someone who‚Äôs father committed suicide I think it is immeasurably kind that you would worry about impressionable people being exposed to this &amp; then being ‚Äútriggered‚Äù. That said it is kind of expected in Bethesda games that there is dark or uncomfortable content. Anyways I hope anyone reading this is doing ok.
---
Once the new patch comes out it‚Äôs gonna be even more amazing than it is right now so just hold on to it and get those heavy gunner perks
---
I have noticed this, was in the nuke zone at Whitesprings last night and it was unplayable at some points.
---
I have an old PS4 btw not the pro.
---
Darn br√∂the. I am on the box of X. 
---
Yes i got a lot of legendaries even from non legendarie guys, also some 3 star legendary dropped 2 legendarie 3 stars item.
---
The irradiated ones only work in the brain bomb recipe also
---
Fuck yes this sounds awesome
---
I just had a thought that would be kind of cool if a mini nuke might occasionally nuke some flora in the strike zone
---
Hey, one of the Bethesda peoples on here. I was in the Wendigo Cave fighting the Progenitor Wendigo for the Rose quest line, when the game froze...not crashed, or booted me from the server, but literally froze. For ten minutes. I had to restart my console. And apparently I died during the freeze because when I logged back in I had lost all my junk. I'll be able to collect my stuff again as it was just junk, though I had quite a bit (a hundred pounds worth, even with pack rat maxed out...), so I'm not worried about that. But I want you guys to be aware of this, just in case it happens again to others. Might have been a glitch on my part, but yeah.  
---
So fallout new Vegas implants
---
I have a question. I have recently started making flux. I've kept all mine in Stable form so far. Should I leave it in  Stable form for long term storage or junk it to pure form? Which way weighs less or are they the same weight? Will the pure form decay? I don't have enough yet to experiment for myself.
---
My Instigating DC Gauntlet takes them out in 1 hit, 90% of the time, and it doesn't require any ammo, and has great durability.
---
combined with the fallout 2 ones as well. 
---
Raw flux decays - it has the yellow bar if you look in your pip-boy (decay rate on raw is very quick compared to other items in the game).
---
Pure/stable does not decay - it does not have the yellow bar.  For longer term storage you absolutely want the pure/stable form as that is the only type which will keep.
---
I hope when they introduce human npcs they don‚Äôt put a date for human npcs show up. Just one day we log in they are just there roaming around or have a little place set up. So when I get on her or twitter or any social media people are just like ‚Äúholy crap HUMAN NPCS!‚Äù So I can be like ‚ÄúWHAAAAAT!!!?!‚Äù And rush home to see how the game just changed. I want that experience of discovering human life in the wasteland. 
---
The last 2 SBQ battles I was in the Queen de-spawned before I was able to loot it, and I got nothing for my work.
---
You're over here like: Probably having more fun playing the game this way.
---
I see beyond cosmetic values.  Cosmetic changes are fickle and arbitrary, based on some persons tastes.
---
I saw beyond your suggestion and thought it could bring a greater good to a larger community while providing a functional value.
---
Oh yeah. For sure. It's because he was in power armor and wasn't thinking, literally sold every piece of armor on him after a SBQ or white springs run. 
---
It's why I step out of my power armor, to make sure what I want to sell isn't equipped to my body.   I wish when in power armor, our body armor has a hallowed square. To denote that it's our armor. 
---
Sounds alright, but expected execution of ideas leaves a lot to be desired. 
---
I too have done this, and at first, could find nothing that I thought should block me. After some more intense searching, there was nothing more than the C.A.M.P itself built and not a thing else. It was in the tall grass and very difficult to find.
---
Really cool idea, maybe it could be associated with a new faction or something, perhaps a vault that experimented with cybernetic implants. I feel like it would be a better way to implement them than arktos. Not trying to criticize your ideas just offering up some alternatives.
---
If you're on PS4 and want a farming buddy to help pass the time, I would love to help you get what you're looking for :)
---
(That goes for anyone. I get bored and not too interested in end content right now, just enjoying exploring.)
---
Thog dont care
---
If I'm low enough on health I'll one shot the fuckers. And that honestly sucks, a fat man should annihilate them, and my sledgehammer shouldn't do that much damage.. 
---
There's plenty of screws, you've just got to find them! 
---
I didn't realize this previously.  I had on pacifist thinking if someone engaged me I could still hit him back if he hit me.  I had someone attacking my camp, did a perfect sneak on him then started stabbing away.  Barely touched him.  He ran away before I realized what had happened.  DOH!
---
Love this idea, would make sense lore wise too.
---
Oops sorry to edit to title too early in the morning for me ‚Äúif there‚Äôs going TO BE human npcs I was it to surprise ‚Äú
---
Is there a weight advantage to breaking down the Stable into Pure?
---
Unfortunately I'm on xbox. Thank you though. Though there are many other people that would benefit from a partner. 
---
good mand
---
good mans
---
Personally looking over the lore, the best place for it to fit would be arkto's pharma and with the responders. As the Auto doc's and implants are common in the Pre war for hospitals. They are rare in post war do to maintenance.  
---
The only other place that could work is with the freestates as they have a few. But they where more loosely set up and unlikely to be modded to to distrust of government as most those implants where made by companies funded by the government.  
---
I'm hoping for legendary Alien Blaster pistol variants with stronger damage or at the very least a Legendary mod for it specifically to increase its damage...
---
Thank you for your response.  Xbox though.  
---
At the end of the day it‚Äôs just a mail box. No gimmicks or atom functionality. Collect mail, send mail. No upgrades. Add some cosmetic ideas like red rocket design and so forth. 
---
You misread my words. 
---
Is this a thing?
---
It‚Äôs rare and a fun little game to check if you can get one. Not much practical use tho
---
Yeah and I love stuff like that too.  The ritual outfit from Point Pleasant is my favorite right now.  Not because of rarity but in looks. 
---
They tried to fix the problem of being stuck without a weapon when it breaks, and introduced a bug where your unselected weapon is unequipped every time you fast travel.  That's why you're seeing bare hands.
---
I agree that I misunderstood.
---
I think people here are not understanding what you might‚Äôve had to deal with in your line of work &amp; why you might feel this way. So I just want to thank you for your thoughtfulness &amp; service to your community.
---
Well, the game didn‚Äôt have the best sales so even though it would be fun for the players, business wise that wouldn‚Äôt be a good  decision. They need to advertise the stuff that will pull people in.
---
Yeah I know that‚Äôs why it was just hope. I‚Äôm sure when they add it on the specified date. There will be like new buildings with wastelanders in it.
---
I give them out to nice players I meet, I've got 9 luck so I get the pies all the time and I just horde them so I can show off.
---
I had never thought about that but a quick google search and I see ... all the volunteer departments, and the community bingo nights or what have you to raise money at the stations...
---
Um... Listed damage is base damage. If you're hidden it's more than listed... I think you're dead wrong about how damage works.
---
Explosive and energy weapons are completely waste of time in this game. For some reason the dev just hate them. An axe and a shotgun are all you need to rule the wonderland. 
---
Hello everyone üòÄ  I have been hunting info on this helmet for weeks and you fellas and/or lady's seem my best hope. I've sent friend requests to all of you who have responded to cyberhawk. My IGN is squirreldude189. I appreciate any help! Thank you all! üòÄ
---
This is a thing, it should be pinned. But yeah, if you walk away from the clubhouse along the left hand side of the tennis court, you get to the stone gazebo/victorian folly. Next to it is a little drinking water fountain which will cure your diseases. Also good for the super lazy who don't want to cook - just eat the raw meat then clear parasites with the fountain.
---
And gama gun should be able to transform ordinary ghouls into glowing ones. Come on Bethesda you have all those tools in the game already, just put two and two together and it will be tons of creative fun. 
---
That was, as far as I know, answered very early.
---
You should be motivated to wear decorative headdresses without a disadvantage. For the damage model, however, it would have to be irrelevant, since here the sum of all components serves as the basis for calculation
---
Stable = pure
---
They are the same thing
---
Nice.  I'm going to try this out and see what it looks like.  Thanks!
---
Are they a hospital or a research facility dedicated to pharmaceuticals, it wasn‚Äôt always very clear to me? If it was something pertaining to bio engineering west-tec would might have dabbled in it right?
---
Also I feel that the free states are unlikely too.
---
Awesome, I‚Äôll try this!  Always catching something from those ghouls.  (Not sure why I can walk through radiation and soot in PA but a ghoul brushing past me gives me bone worms)
---
Wait, you mean I shouldn't have 15 INT at level 17?
---
Still no time frame for when suspended players will get back access to their WHOLE Bethesda.Net account... sweetüëåüèº but the Bugthesda bootlickers on this sub are all delighted with a brewing station and some basic changes.
---
u/ladydevann u/lonevaultwanderer
---
They shouldn't just be roaming around. It would be better if there were just a few at first and slowly more show up over time. Going from none to a bunch would be too drastic of a change. 
---
Kinda wish games like ESO would consider this as well. Instead of announcing a week in advance about some event, then *poof* the event NPCs are there, the NPCs should spend a week setting up camp and advertising the event in game. But what do I know...
---
Implants where counted as Pharmaceutical's in the pre war. 
---
Where'd you find it? I've never seen it before but if you picked up from a paper bag or bought from a player, it could be from the dev room. Or maybe I've just never seen it before lol either way, looks really cool! 
---
I understand that you are sensitive to that voice line and respect you for not going all PC Police on Bethesda. But just imagine what we would have for a Fallout game if we went all PC Police and removed the following Chems ( because of the drug epidemic we have) , Alcohol  ( drunk driving),Guns ( because people kill people), Knifes (because people kill people), Nuke Zones (I am sure this offends some Japanese), clown costume( some people have a fear of clowns),nuclear power ( clean energy that scares tree huggers) cigarettes ( why can't I smoke them in game) spoiled meat ( 3,000 people die in the US from foodborne illness) please add to the list.
---
Being PC is the hip thing kids do today but it also is a slippery slope it's ok to be offended by something  but it does not mean that the majority is offended. It must be a good time to own a coloring book business and puppy store because I need a safe place after this post.
---
Pong that's what we would have for a Fallout game unless somehow hitting a ball is not PC.
---
Keep up the great work Bethesda and do not bend  to the PC crowd censorship requests ever because that offends me.
---
Let me guess, WS outside the club house yes? 
---
Dammit.
---
DAMMIT.
---
Nice writeup! Isn't there a bit more info about the mole miners and their history on the terminals in Blackwater Mine? 
---
&gt; Speaking of wording, the word ‚ÄúWastelanders‚Äù already implies NPCs, and the player characters in 76 are referred to as ‚ÄúVault Dwellers‚Äù throughout the game, so ‚ÄúWastelanders‚Äù implies people not from a vault.
---
Since this is coming around the one year mark, I wonder if the implication here is that *we* are the wastelanders, now.
---
Given the a#$% still exist, then the answer is maybe.  
---
I'm a 35 - normally play solo, but a couple nights ago I teamed with a 14.  We were later joined by a 34 and a 112.
---
We went several hours from the forest to the munitions factory to Red Rocket with no issues.
---
Sorry to hear about what you went through in your personal life. Suicide is a difficult issue I have dealt with sucide of a family member. (I don't wish to elaborate further please do not ask) Please realize how grateful your family is because you didn't go through with it.
---
Having had this happen in my personal life as a surviving family member you look back and wonder where you went wrong. How did you miss the signs? I've come to realize often there isn't any. With that said I'm glad you seem to be past that point in your life. 
---
Suicidal tendencies are not always obvious and we will never know what triggers them as it varies from person to person it's hard to say if a robot in a game will be the driving force behind one. I tend to think it wouldn't but I can't say for sure.
---
I'm left thinking of songs that cover similair scenerios. Mudvaynes Dig for one is quite implicit about helping with a suicide. But I don't think it was ever taken literally. (I hope not!)
---
Chester Bennington from Lincoln Park is a sad example of how even when it seems you have everything you can feel like nothing. It always seemed to me that One More Light was a cry for help. A cry left unheard by his family friends and fans. It's a very sad song when you listen to it with this thought behind it.
---
While in bad taste having this line from a Robot is innocent but can be taken badly. While i'm empathetic to your personal struggles please realize Drugs, gun violence, destitude, even dead babies (though done subtly) are rampant in FO76.  Drug deaths are on the rise and we are in a heroin epidemic. Not to mention how anyone who has lost a baby must feel when they see the strollers with B.A.B.Y blocks in them. It'd be a slippery slope to remove one thing and not ask for the others to be removed.
---
I pray you're past those thoughts. And please if your ever in a time of need for your sake and your families don't feel alone reach out to people who can help you. 
---
Now when I play any other game I try jumping with triangle button. Wtf Fallout. Really? Triangle? 
---
Hah! 
---
That happened to me during ESO, once. 
---
A few of us (not friends, just randos) all heading for the same area, we get there, there's a dude already there... porn blasting.  It was... odd.
---
It was funny, I did the opposite recently. Played FO4 for the first time, logged a 225 hour play-through. Went back to FO76, I kept trying to save before entering buildings, forgot the map was not in the Pip-Boy, forgetting to drink water, haha. 
---
One gun army? IMO more important then everything above 
---
I'm not sure about an entire texture overhaul mod (don't think there is one yet), but there are individual texture mods and QOL mods that might help.
---
If I configure my Tesla rifle into shotgun mode it should benefit from shotgun perks, if I turn it into a rifle, rifle perks should help yes? 
---
THAT WOULD BE PERFECT. Like oh shiz guys over here at the water park. Wait no there some at flat woods. Just populating the map little by little and then a brotherhood of steel airship shows up. I hope they introduce a faction that comes and says give us your stuff or die and we end up in a war with vault dwellers vs a faction. 
---
Yes, I love it but just can't use it if I lose my hat
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a joke, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm all about the melee, the weapon damages don‚Äôt make sense, i think the next update will improve these issues from what I‚Äôve been reading 
---
Seems great. Hope Bethesda will see it. 
---
Yep! 
---
Had an idea last night...
---
a "ground" foundation. That's it. It's a level pile of earth. Set a 2x2 "ground level", there you have it. 
---
Appearance of your camp being set up on the ground, no "how the hell do I carry that much wood everywhere I go?" silliness.
---
Happy medium?
---
more plz
---
IF it stays popular they might. 
---
5 is max i can do, what you thing about that?
---
lol
---
I didn‚Äôt consider that. Either way I hope this concept picks up enough momentum for the devs to see it.
---
My workaround for this is to not open the pipboy until my camp has showed or player icons have started appearing in the map again. Otherwise you get stuck and will need to reroll a session
---
I think turret range is taken into account.
---
"Your heavy energy weapons should now last four to five times longer, and semi-auto energy weapons should last twice as long before needing repairs"
---
Maybe I'm reading it wrong and it is twice as long as the 5x increase to heavy energy weapon durability
---
Same. 
---
It‚Äôs like a combo of the ritual mask and gas mask... glitch maybe. 
---
Yeah, the clothing bench in ESO is the greatest feature, for anyone into character customization. To be honest, it was the driving factor behind my getting a ESO membership.
---
that is not quite correct, because the boxes always have power.
---
When the power plant is out of order it is 10 units. When the power plant has been booted up, there are 100 units that can provide a box
---
What do you mean for the greatest profit?
---
Yip, I was constantly riddled with diseases and making cures is a pain, especially as no matter what, you have to make the basic cures first, antibiotics require them. Just seems so odd. 
---
Where'd the video go? Why'd the mods remove this?
---
Pharma Pharm or whatever the luck perk cards have been a literal life saver, usually get my cures and antibiotics using that.
---
Yeah i know i had 500hours played. Then they do some "fixing" to queen which ended up broken and because they scewed adrenal reaction my group went playing apex as i did. (Apex is fking lagging mess, bless fo76 for being little smother on ps4) and after those weeks i wanted to check out whats changed. Of course i didn't think of this bug and i didn't want to reload game after i hit pip-boy button, so i quit. Annoying.
---
Yes, if everything equipped were never in vendor, scrap,  or trade windows that'd be a rudimentary solution.
---
But the ability to mark all items you want to hide from those menus, and even prevent dropping them would be ultimate.
---
It is, but it can be tricky the first time you do it.  The plant is swarming with scorched and when you go into the reactor room you're going to take some rads so be prepared for that.  Tips I gave someone else yesterday who had never done it: 1) Turn off all other quests in your HUD. The quest markers will clutter up your HUD and make it confusing as to where you need to go   2) Once each system is partially repaired, it will tell you that fully repairing them is optional.  However, I suggest fully repairing each one.  For example make sure each and every leaking steam vent and sparking console in the cooling towers is fixed before heading into the plant.  If you leave them partially repaired, quest markers will still show up on your HUD and once you are inside the plant, the markers will take you to doors that lead outside (because its drawing you back to the cooling towers).  Fully repairing each system removes the objectives entirely from your HUD and makes navigating inside the plant so much easier.
---
hmm
---
Are you wearing all the pieces? Are any of the pieces broken? Pretty sure this issue has been addressed already
---
I do agree with this. My base is an armored redoubt on a cliff side. I have the defensive walls on the perimeter around my outside with water and farm, and the only way in would be through the front or scaling the cliff
---
Unfortunately, I can only afford a couple turrets, and they die very quickly to mole rats. So we do need a rework soon
---
I didnt know you could get them from the machine!! I thought it always dropped it!
---
  I do pick up the one on top of West tech tho....but ill be fighting the machine today!
---
I saw it on a player at WS. No idea where they got it from
---
Your an animal in the video. Thanks for the help and advice. Especially with the weapon and mod help.
---
Area specific events. They are like that for ease access. Sort of a teaching event. 
---
Fog crawlers are in the game.
---
The quest to kill the alien has been there since the start.
---
Could be the poisonous air or an invisible enemy under the map.
---
Nice.  I'm going to try Alex's recommendations here...

There is plenty to do... It's just not something YOU want to do.

I'm going to try Alex's recommendations here.  I'm not going to just uninstall.

I feel you. I just walk away and hope they get help or the technician gets there.

There‚Äôs a mailman in trouble and he needs your help.

I'm going to try Alex's recommendations here...

What if it was two pieces. The chest and helmet. Helmets more focused around luck, perception,  inteligence and charisma. And chest around strength, endurance and agility.
---
But having two pieces lowers the effect by a third as to not be to strong
---
Are Area specific events more common than other events?
---
This would be perfect! I hope they say ridiculous things like in FO4
---
Fumes from the water, air so on. 
---
Yes to implants, no to granting additional implants based on strength, which as stats go already has the most benefit in the game.
---
You could however make stat requirements for the various implants individually.
---
Luck Stat helps apparently. I have 11 Luck so I usually get the Pie between 10-20 attempts.
---
I haven‚Äôt done testing but it feels that way. 
---
I DON'T KNOW.  HAVE WE ALL GONE DEAF?
---
I may be a little wierd then because I look at all the plans and serum recepies and think it will be a decade before I have all I want...
---
I clicked this thread too quickly expecting a far different suggestion to, ahem, "enhance" the game.
---
Did you submit a ticket 
---
IT isn't just based on strenght. The additional slots are just for the limbs tied to that special. So strenght for arms and legs additional one, INT for the heads, and END for the chests. 
---
Fortune and glory friend. Fortune and glory. 
---
I've seen the mask on the totems around the world but have never been able to find that variant to actually pick up
---
You build excavator armor as part of the Miner Miracles quest.  Easiest way to launch the quest is to go to Camden Park and go to the shop where you can exchange Mr Fuzzy tokens for swag. Outside the shop, on the wall, is a poster advertising the Excavator PA.  You can choose to examine the poster, which is what will launch the quest.
---
&gt; If you bought Fallout 76 last year. You will find the classic games in the Bethesda app on PC
---
I thought you had to have played it last year, not just bought it last year?
---
You‚Äôre missing an ‚Äúa‚Äù buddy
---
I have definitely seen some just disappear. Could be that you've just been unlucky. 
---
Was at White Springs the other day though and it seemed like there was a pretty heavy load on the server and it took a while for loot to show up.  
---
Queen events are a massive strain on the server, so a delay is somewhat to be expected. 
---
Also, step back away from the corpse and then check again. Don't just hover over it. You may already know this,  but doesn't hurt to mention it. 
---
That what I did and I regret it
---
Im howling because the EXACT SAME THING happened to me when I joined up a few days ago.
---
Like my camp was taking forever to load so I opened my Pip Boy and it was just stuck on the screen with no ability to move the menu or lower the pip boy.
---
I literally just shut it down and have not got back on since.
---
Definitely. In the beginning it is difficult to get your bearings, but if you have found your way it is also possible with lvl 20 in the given time. Gives good construction plans at the power station events
---
I would recommend some RadAways or RadX or a hazmat suit, because you also have to repair the reactor room and there you have some increased radiation
---
I'm starting to run low, I had 5000 because I bought it, I made like 10 etra fuel then said \*\*\*\* it, I'm not gonna use a bunch of Acid to make 5 fuel.
---
I've had the same thing in the Watoga HS. I'll go in engage a few super mutants and if I get too many, I exit. On more than a few occasions they have followed me out; but they are underground or something so I can't target them or damage them. Only thing to do is put enough distance between me and the HS that they give up and go back to the HS.
---
The others don't bother us, so yes.
---
nope. This is entirely OC and posted for the first time ever
---
Thought as much... but (and I hate to say it) never *100%* sure if something is intentional or a bug in this game. 
---
Since the last update, the thing where you don't see/hear other players apparently massively increased, so it might as well have been someone attacking you.
---
Happy honda man
---
(at least) one of the diseases/mutations will reduce some weapon damage by 50%... twisted muscles, I think ?
---
I enjoy the quirkiness. Adds to the zany fallout way. Makes it feel like Wild Wasteland from NV
---
Those terminals refer to the Blackwater bandits raiders, who caused a radiation leak and ghoulified.
---
Same!  I just wanted to make some kind of super mutant with a fist weapon, turns out melee build is the OP stuf now so I don't complain lol 
---
I've also now killed a creature with the standard (not upgraded) paddle ball :)
---
I have the Nuka cola paint for the t51 if you're interested (also on xbox)
---
@ladydevann are you saying that something related to PvP was updated yesterday?  Because an online friend just got killed in passive mode by a much higher level player yesterday. He's ready to quit the game because of that sort of thing. He was at his camp and his server was lagging. The other player apparently noticed and killed him. He had just spent 3 hours collecting scrap to craft something. 
---
I suppose this is supposed to be some clever in-reference but I have no idea what you‚Äôre trying to say.
---
Ye br√∂ther, l√§mp didn't bless us.
---
Ez. My Bowie does 200 damage, and I can swing it 2.6 times a second. 
---
I don‚Äôt have a Bloodied build at all, just a set of +STR armor.
---
I love *intentional* wackiness. 
---
i.e. acidic air eating away at my armour? No problems. But if it's an invisible ghoul stuck in a wall? Notsomuch.
---
You seem upset
---
ah ok, I guess I misread that
---
I don‚Äôt care if you have 300 armor or 1k I‚Äôll still one shot anyone. My lvl320 has 340 health. My fist weapon sits around 1k normally. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much dmg resist you have cause it‚Äôs not going to exceed 100% and even half my dmg from one swipe will be double your health. So defense is worthless imo
---
Gotcha. 
---
Up to you there are more quests coming next Tues 12th and more stuff 
---
Nope, you don‚Äôt need that at all to get above 1k damage levels.
---
Another inside the vault that ignores the still rampant duping. And if duping has been fixed which I doubt then why haven't suspended accounts been reinstated. I know you all say if we cheated that we deserve our punishment.i didn't cheat however and cannot play the game I paid for.
---
Is it supposed to be available more than once? (It only ever triggered once for me, so I'm not sure.)
---
I feel like there should be a designated day where everyone can do one last sbq fight, but maybe changed up a bit, like a new event basically, and then the next day, scorchbeasts are gone from Appalachia and humans start to arrive, they could replace the scorched with raiders or just have a period where scorched are just gone and after a while raiders start to appear and a small amount of friendly humans and maybe eventually, the Brotherhood of Steel retakes the Cranberry Bog.
---
Hey! Steve takes his job seriously. 
---
No broken pieces. Wearing all of them. I thought I was crazy so I did some testing and everything I said was accurate.
---
It sucks because it screws me over in a nuke run. When you get the ID card you need to get out of the suit...which means I'm overweight once I get back in...which means I can't fast travel to the nuke location...
---
They are down right hilarious 
---
Love the idea , but say 4 players put their camps together , what would happen if only one of those players log in? Would it show only that players camp or all 4 ? 
---
Awesome.  Thanks.  I'm wanting a getter generator plan, so I'm hoping to complete this quest soon.
---
What mod is on the Gatling Gun? There's a mod that makes it shoot slower, but do more damage 
---
dibs! My IGN is Sgt\_OKeefe
---
Only a quarter?   If it isn‚Äôt a Scorchbeast I‚Äôm one shotting it.
---
You've been lucky. Griefers are a nuisance and I know a couple of players who are ready to leave the game because of them. One told me last night that he's done. 
---
4 months to fix energy weapons.  
---
I get it, and I'll enjoy it while it's there, but I just feel like it's massively premature for them to introduce any temporary content at all.  Feels like it'll be a year or more before there's enough game to justify stuff like this being available for a period as short as this.
---
We need a quick-toggle button for pacifist mode. When you're being attacked by a player, you don't want to waste time going to the settings menu to turn it off.
---
Also, the greatest issue for me is the loot load times. I can live with the current endgame, but not if every Prime Site victory ends in 30 minutes of this. https://ibb.co/zXrMz6f
---
This has nothing to do with workshops. 
---
There's some lovely ideas there, but realistically there's literally zero chance of almost all of it happening as described. Look at how little the developers managed to do in nearly 4 months, and how buggy that was. And you think they can do *this* in under 10 months? No chance. Zip, zilch, zero. You gotta roll those expectations way, way, way back.
---
I don't doubt that you may be having problems. I have to wonder what is causing it. I have never had my game lock up or crash opening pip boy. Or ever I believe. Have had server crashes once in a while. I'm on PC.
---
Gatlin gun is primed. Had the "speedy receiver" on it but I use it more like a rifle because it hits so hard so rate of fire wasn't a concern. Just base damage. 
---
Same here. I had to re-train my brain. I try to clear an area then swap to pharma-farmer, scrounger, lock pick and hacker. I make all my money selling chems and i have over 200 stimpack, hence the low endurance.. Swap out tormentor or better crits for scorch beast, build up adreline with low level mobs and unleash on the beast.
---
Agree PA helps with those pipes as you can run around and worry about killing the enemies after... been learning - but only have taken 100+ level ups to realize some of these things.
---
Funny how at least 1/2 of them were from Whitesprings alone when 450xp per glowing was freaking awesome.  How'd someone not pickup that was a tad too much?  +3 stars on the additional damage to glowing makes a melee build with all the Strength perks for Melee so much fun.  I use a Ghoul's Axe sometimes and have a band of armless glowing running around after me doing no damage - its kind of cool but weird.
---
Easy fix. Become a wanderer and relocate your camp whenever/wherever you want to put on a show.  
---
My alt is a wanderer. Having a camp that I move around the map while I explore is a lot of fun and it's easier than trekking my overburdend ass halfway across a map.
---
Fertile Soil in Flatwoods and the two Grafton events - Grafton Day and Protest March - are vastly more common than the others.  It is rare for me to go to Grafton and *not* trigger one of them.  They are meant to be tutorials.
---
Yeah, when i see how big the radius is, i have a feeling that they wanted it to be that way. Not sure how to explain my thoughts (english is not my language), but in a post apocalypse world where there is only a few human comming out of the same vault and suddently having to fight each others... I don't know...
---
Bump. This is a great idea. 
---
I do have mutations but none that affect damage. I'm also running LVL1 off all 3 rifleman perks. I did add the 3rd riflemen mark so I will remove and test.  With all the updates I didn't know if something had changed for everyone.
---
Actually, only the lasers and plasma weapons are problematic.
---
Tesla rifle and Gauss rifle do very good damage.
---
My 1 \* instigated Gauss rifle does 1300 damage at best
---
196 base x 2
---
392 base and instigated x 2.3
---
901.6 base and instigated and ambushed x 1.5
---
1352 base and instigated and ambushed and Sandman
---
Opening pip-boy just after loggin lock you out, you can only check map or leave game. It was in game even before i leaved.
---
If you want to be a raider, be a raider in an environment where people are willing and able to fight back. 
---
If i'm set passive, you being a raider basically means you think you have the right to harass me, with no consequences. It means you're really just a turd who doesn't care whether other players get to enjoy the game too. 
---
Be a raider all you want. Do it on a PvP server. Then you can whine because some low level player you thought was an easy mark baited you into attacking him so his. High level friends could mop the floor with you. 
---
Was he yelling "Hey Clark, shitter's full!" ?
---
reddit doesn't work like that. upvoting bumps. 
---
Nope
---
Just a suggestion but you should offer more. At level 50 treasure contain plans and harder to find weapons and armor. And you can farm the extras by leaving them in your stash.
---
No thanks, I have it 
---
I upvoted üòâ. Just didn't have anything new to add to the conversation, other than my support for your idea!!
---
This happened to me. I was confused because I've seen a few plans for sale from vendors that don't say known even though I have already learned them. I bought a cheap one yesterday that I was sure I already knew to test it and on the top left where it'd normally say what I unlocked it just said 'already known' and made it a known plan in my inventory just like you op. Kinda pissed it was a waste of caps tho
---
My main is a wanderer with a minimalist camp... sleeping bag, stash box, cooking station (the little cat-iron-pot-on-the-ground one). That's it.
---
I‚Äôm happy to take that paint I need some customization 
---
This game is really complex and every aspect of gameplay could be forseen. What's imoortant is that Bethesda is listening to the comunity and i think they do.
---
I've hit most? of the spawn sites in the Forest and toxic valley multiple times - and in te process collected a partial set of Raider, 2 sets of T45, 2 sets of T51b, all but one piece of T60, and I think one piece of X01.
---
I can't seem to find the one on the west tek roof I keep hearing about. Can you tell me or link a screenshot or something? I go up there all the time for the paint cans. 
---
Yeah. I just picked up a level 40 GG. Thinking of putting my 2SE handmade in storage because it's so weak by comparison. 
---
Did you try taking off the pieces and putting them back on the suit?
---
The way I read it the tools and jerks that build their missile and turret camps may not be able to place them directly behind the golf club anymore.  Thank God.  I‚Äôm getting tired of blowing them up and losing caps by virtue of acquiring wanted status.  Time to play the game like everyone else and actually try to kill ghouls on your own or with a team.  
---
Are you on PC?? if so this might be an item from the dev room...
---
No kidding.  This just happened to me at Blackwater Mine.  I blasted myself with my perked explosive shotgun. 
---
I'm also having a hard time getting the plans I did a ton of events last night got nadda. 
---
That should be included too, adds +5 charisma
---
I use adrenal, and with no adrenaline perk going the base damage on the gatlin is 206. I was always rifle melee. On Xbox anyway, when I switched to pc I decided I wouldn't player trade for all the op stuff I could and that gatlin is the best gun drop I've had and to be honest I'm really impressed with its performance compared to rifles. Just sucks I have to be in power armor. Lol
---
I have the same problem 
---
Really disappointed that the implants options went away in F3 and F4, but I'd like to see them here too!
---
-1 to intelligence
---
Send a friend request to ScoobaClaude I‚Äôll give you a hand.
---
I wouldn't try. Carnivore is better than Herbivore and its not worth taking a chance getting rid of it.
---
These things are much more likely than you think. From a bird's eye view, these things may seem impossible to develop in such a short time. However, what people don't know is that development of almost every DLC has been in development for a long time now, maybe even since the beginning of the game itself. If you were to datamine the files, lots of hints and details pertain to each DLC announced. 
---
Its likely the DLC coming isnt entirely new content, it's cut content that is being recycled back into the game.
---
Go read the 2019 content roadmap, they give release dates for a lot of the stuff too.
---
you may have to do the event several times to get the plan you want. Believe I got the big generator, the wind turbine (unfortunately useless) and the fusion generator through the power plant event.
---
At first you will not be able to build the fusion generator because I think you need Flux. But I'm not quite sure
---
Making the event several times is no problem after the first time. There are at most lvl 6 scorched inside and with a good hunting rifle you have an easy game there
---
The game's early events - the two in Grafton that people have mentioned, Fertile Soil in Flatwoods, Mama Dolce's - definitely repeat way more than others. Like, it wouldn't surprise me if the "cooldown" timer for them is around an hour. I've done them multiple times on one server, during long play sessions. 
---
For events like that, they trigger once you get near the area. Later on, you'll get events given to you by a certain faction, and those will just pop up randomly on the map without you having to trigger them. (i.e. You'll open the map, and they are on there to join.) Unless you're focused on clearing out the events, there are usually up to five at any given time. And, if you don't want to do an event, there isn't any harm in just leaving the area. 
---
I think so 
---
The Fallout wiki has the formula from previous games, but yeah, you can get them in all of the games - it just takes a ton of attempts, depending on your luck. 
---
I don't know about the wiki.
---
I pulled the list of mods from the esm and I have unlocked all of them.
---
I have them on a spreadsheet along with all the rest if you want it as reference.
---
Might be better instead to just associate all implants to a base stat level independently, that way chr, per, agility etc could all allow you to add additional implants of a type.
---
Except the implants that add to stats should have no or very low requirements because you may want it to shore up a weakness.
---
Ahh right, I assumed it was all linked together! Maybe the legendary vendor will indeed clarify the story! 
---
They are there for you to show off your luck cause it takes a long time (if your me) to get one of these and when you do you can celebrate and just begin hoarding them
---
Does anyone know if you get more rewards from powering it up fully?
---
Yeah I know, I did that early game but swapping perk cards is a real pain in the bum so I'll just pay for the fast travel instead! 
---
I have that one checked.
---
I believe it is among the list of 'bugged dailies' that are inconsistent at showing up or don't at all. I've never had more than two of these QotH missions iirc.
---
&gt;mr handy buzz saw blade
---
Does the Ripper also stagger? Also is the buzz blade considered two handed weapon? What about the Ripper, is that one handed?
---
I believe its MrSlime15
---
You maybe have a disease? Some of them can surprise you. Bleeding from wounds. I sometimes seem to be made of tissue paper for no reason. 
---
This right here. The SBQ is getting old honestly but the day the nukes start flying every minute aww man I am going to be in love.
---
Please list them/link because I only unlocked 3 so far. 2 muzzle and big drum mag
---
The alien is the Flatwoods Monster.
---
I mean, I wouldn't miss the line if it were removed.  It's not particularly funny compared to some of his other quips.
---
Should be motivated?
---
If only there were more cool content that feature decorative headdresses. 
---
Everyone wears the same thing because that's all we really got.
---
Cowboy hats, Halloween skull mask, and that cult mask that greifer boys love to wear. üòÜ
---
It's cool that head wear it decore only, but,,,
---
 I'd love to see more lore friendly head wear.
---
Stuff like the Veteran ranger riot helmet, marine armor helmet,  or even the ghoul mask would be awesome and undoubtedly rake in some Atom shop cash flow 
---
Assuming that's what they really care about.  
---
It happens every time on Xbox. You just have to wait for the game to fully load. That is the only fix I know of. I just jump around until the game feels stable. 
---
OK, you're all set once you get the acoustic plans. The banjo can travel with you.
---
Have you tried using the validate game from the launcher or repairing/deleting/reinstalling game? I play with with my brother and sis-in-law, all PC and we don't seem to crash. My sis-in-law does get a black screen once in a while when she tries to fast travel to Harper's ferry. She can still see her power armor hud, but everything else goes black. She has to go to desk top. 
---
My problem is that while I expect slap damage, I‚Äôve initiated PvP accidentally.
---
I don‚Äôt want PvP AT ALL. This game is so choppy/glitchy/laggy regarding FPS mechanics, like changing weapons, using stimpaks, changing between run and sprint, bullet registration (hitscan?) and what not. 
---
Most annoying is that melee shock mutation or armor perk. When I‚Äôm passive and a griever comes at me hitting me melee, I initiate PvP when that shock hits that player.
---
Or it‚Äôs owning a workshop disables passive mode for you even outside of your workshop, took me a while to know about that.
---
Leave me alone please :(
---
I want a silver paint mod. How can I be the Silver Shroud without it?
---
Datamined files don't mean anything is finished. In Elder Scrolls Online a fifth class was datamined before release, but wasn't finished until more than 3 years past release. 
---
And they wouldn't be working on DLCs when the base game is in such horrific state. A normal developer would have finished the game proper, and then worked on DLCs. A less ethical developer would have finished the game proper, broke chunks off, and released them later as DLC. But these guys, based on their performance over the past 4 months, just don't have the chops to do any of it. Game was unfinished, and DLC wasn't started beyond some stubs.
---
And while they have a roadmap with dates, what they'll release isn't what you're expecting. Which is why I said peoples' expectations need to be dialed way down. People are expecting, well-thought-out, fleshed-out, working systems. Not a single such system exists, so far, even in the base game. Every single system in the game currently is broken or logically flawed. Nothing functions as it should. And you think you're getting complex, working, interwoven systems, many of them, in just 9 months? Not. A. Chance. Zero. At best you'll get buggy and extremely rudimentary features. 
---
I think it would be awesome, but I don't think it'll happen. Fallout 76 getting human NPCs would be massive and if this is what Bethesda is planning I think it could be in response to some of the backlash. I think this would be followed by a big push from Bethesda to get people into this game that passed on it the first time around and in turn a bunch of marketing for this DLC. 
---
It's like what they do with E3. How could would it have been to just see Fallout 76 for the first time at the conference? Despite that, it makes a lot more sense to show off the teaser trailer first and stir up a ton of interest before hand. I imagine we see something similar with the Wastelanders DLC. 
---
I would actually say it may be pretty likely we hear about this DLC at Bethesda's E3 conference, especially if it is human NPCs. I would expect maybe a trailer for "Nuclear Winter" and then a super short teaser just showing a human NPC in 76 and a "coming September 2019". 
---
Don't let your dreams be dreams.
---
No cause then you could have super implanted people. The limits now are to force choice. Unlike mutations which you can have all implants are much more limiting but can give much bigger boosts with smaller downsides. except the ones that are just locking mutations in. 
---
Only works on female characters. IF you are male gives a -15
---
Yeah, i regularly have to sell stims and radaway. I don't even need to dilute them. 
---
Makes sense as you describe it.
---
There goes the joke lmao
---
The white ball in pong offends me, it should be multi-color to encompass the world. /s
---
Pretty much anything can be offensive to someone, thanks to OP and everyone else for keeping a cool head and furthering discussion on this.
---
You get no benefit past 20% I believe. I've got 9 in rifleman, and I'm using adrenal reaction and nerd rage as well. Adrenal reaction was bugged on the last patch, so you have to get rid of it and get it again for it to "work." 
---
I though i was the only one selling all drugs i find...
---
Fully powering it up increases the xp and caps rewards and I do believe you get more items as well.  The first three times you do it you will be rewarded with generator plans, if you don't already own them.  This is actually the easiest way to get the plans for the fusion generator. 
---
That would be me. But I don‚Äôt know about dying rarely.  
---
I think I've seen that on a npc corpse in the mire. Came across three or four dead cultists and they had various masks on. None had them as loot, but it could be a rare drop from them. 
---
Yeah. I've had this happen 3 different times but only since the last patch. I can get as far as unlocking the box then boom back on the ground like I teleported. Best loot is up there. 
---
I think this is a known glitch.  This is not the first time I have heard about this on reddit.
---
Yes there's a limit.
---
I'd love to play 4 with 76's vats. That would be super cool 
---
Just verified.  Fully powering it up, in addition to what is listed below, gives 20% more reward items. Rewards include a random amount of fusion cells, copper scrap, nuclear waste, and random consumables 
---
Her voice kinda reminds me of if Vanellope von Schweetz had a drinking and smoking habit...
---
And yet, the "exclusion zone" around camp is so large, it gave me the feeling they don't want that to happen. I sure hope they fix that someday.
---
What ? Fnv had implants ?
---
I'm actually typically a passive trader and pvp to hunt wanted players.  I've got beat down before.  While I don't condone true griefing, I also know that raiding is part of these games.  There does need to be balance, I agree there.  But let's not sanitize or fracture the game to achieve it.
---
Didn't they explicitly say this was possible? Like I vividly remember Pete saying we could do this for some reason 
---
There was a post a while back, I can't find it, but they said they got the X01 rocket pack and flew around with a minigun and auto grenade launcher. Said they identified as an A-10 warthog.
---
That's the level of crazy fun I strive for in this game.
---
I'm giving it another 6 months to see where all this "roadmap" stuff really ends up once their cheery marketing meets the reality of their incompetent development and implementation.  After dealing with hundreds of glitches and having patches re-glitch gear I paid for, uninstalling felt like Andy Dufresne escaping Shawshank.   I am through being Bethesda's unpaid beta tester, life is too short.
---
You don't have to claim it.  If you qualified, then it simply shows up in the Bethesda launcher on PC.
---
It's like a glitch in the matrix! I logged on today and my camp is in the divide on one of the southern lakes and I had TWO neighbors!!! One even had a mic and gifted me some stable flux for the jetpack I'm working on üòç
---
I am working on a ghoul slayer set of armor for the non nuked Whitespring. Trying to get out of my power armor like you. I use a Swing Speed Vampire switchblade that is amazing. Ghouls stand no chance. 
---
Hit up rbtrizzle , PSN BIZERK, he can make what ever you want.  
---
Yeah. I play how I want. I don‚Äôt really build for a specific thing in mind though honestly I probably end up with a build close to being sneaky/sniping cause that is always what I lean to in fallout (right now my perception is 11 and agility 9 or something). Not that I build with that in mind, I have been deciding perks/stats as I get them. It just happens that is what I tend to go with. 
---
there's so few perk slots, not every melee uses Radicool or Twisted Muscles
---
‡≤†_‡≤†
---
And an increase to 2,147M max caps
---
I definitely like the general concept as a way to help advancement without having to change the level cap.  Plenty of wiggle room to add new implants and have "over the air updates" on old ones to fix balance issues.
---
High-five! I think we‚Äôre the only two people who like 76‚Äôs VATS
---
I searched this up to check during BETA, not the same VA but for ages I thought I knew the voice but couldn't put my finger on it.
---
Rose is such an interesting character, especially at what's implied at the end of her questline. Hope she's utilised more further down the line. 
---
Well, there is a lot more. I prefer to wear a yellow safety helmet with a lamp. You see so many accident victims in this game whose lives would not have ended so abruptly if they had just been wearing a safety helmet.
---
The ghoul mask would be really cool, but only if it had the same effect as in Fallout 3.
---
Baseball cap, ushanka, protective helmets, beer hat, clown hat, ski hood, etc.
---
It won't work I've tried. You can have of those too.  You can drink the drum but no affect
---
I think he‚Äôs opposite. But I‚Äôm with you. I don‚Äôt actually dislike power armor, just it gets in the way of how I like playing, being stealthy. And yeah, glowing sea was the one time I really used it. I still collect it though (not in 76, too little storage space for that). And have it as a backup but never really used it anyways. 
---
Nuke zones are Fallout's version of a black tie event, but instead of a tux you where power armor.
---
I don't know about energy weapons (since I don't use them), but ballistic weapons looks, sounds and shoots the same with Prime receiver or without. They just use different kind of ammo (ultracite variant) and deal additional damage for scorched and scorchbeasts.
---
Fallout has always had dark humor.  Always.
---
The game is essentially humor around a nuclear holocaust.  That's gotta be just as bad as suicide, right?  I mean, it's worse.  We are talking the murder of hundreds of millions of people.  That's where the game *starts.* 
---
I would say, if you are looking to avoid being offended, you should avoid this game.  It makes dark jokes about *everything*.  You going to remove everything that offends someone?  Guns, cannibals, murder, violence, etc....  
---
Remove the whole game if you want it to be non-offensive.  You'd have to. 
---
Mr. Gutsy's are supposed to be hardcore  lean mean ass kicking machines. They are not there to be nice or spare your feelz. I'd expect nothing less of them.

Is in the 'Machined 5' tab.
---
What's the difference between Lewisburg Station and a mirelurk with implants? 
---
One is a crusty bus station and the other is a busty crustacean
---
I'd be ok with if there's a few places where there are a few, lets say four house ruins that you can claim in a way a little lika a workshop. When you have claimed it players in that team can select a ruin and build in that space. It would be a small space like 3x4 full floors. If only you are logged in the original rubble filled ruins would be shown. When a town is claimed it doesn't matter if the team is split up, you still have a town house there. When you enter a world and your spot is taken you can opt to either take another of the four spots or leave the world. These places would be known and be good places to have player vending at.
---
I‚Äôm still searching for red and yellow if you come across them but I spend time trying to find the corpses and vendor bot if you want to farm with me. Psn sneazel. Out today but will be on tonight. 
---
Wheres the quest
---
I found a explosive 50 cal
---
Sold it for 760 caps because it was lvl 25 and almost broken(was lvl 23 and going melee build but now melee commando hybrid which works well against scorched beast) but 50 and 308 are very good.
---
Although best gatling for me would be furious or twoshot, 25 fire rate and 90% less weight
---
LOL
---
What if they are from Thailand though? :D
---
I want to get a jetpack for my X01
---
It appears to be a mask on some dead raiders found during a [random encounter](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8ielc/ritualist_cultist_gas_masks/). No clue how this person got it as it‚Äôs not on the corpse‚Äôs inventory. 
---
Awesome, thank you so much for checking. I actually enjoy powering up the plants, although I wish the pointer system was better. It's like a maze in each plant (intentionally, I suppose). The one near Harper's actually has repair points outside the building.
---
If it was a black ball I'd be offended by the white paddles hitting it. Not to mention a rainbow ball would be representative of the LGBT community and even more offensive. Perhaps we're all better off sitting in a circle singing Kumbaya instead of playing video games /s
---
Dev: Now players can move north towards the south commonwealth to face a fierce battle to each other in the Glowing Sea.
---
She‚Äôs certainly keeping me busy! She most recently sent me to a hostile mole miner convention in the mine by WS. What a jokester. ;)
---
Her quest line was so good but took me so long to do, and for that, I hate her.
---
Shoot, no clue why. That is disappointing. Here is a link to the video if you are interested: https://youtu.be/0Ppx57bFzy4 -Proctor Rivelli
---
I have one 2000 caps for me to install it with my materials 
---
Hmm, if this is the case, I may just stop trading altogether. I have a long history of hating dupes and dupers, all the way back to Diablo 1 and 2. I was really big into the legit pvp scene there, and we had to scan people using 3rd party scanners to ensure that they had no common dupes. Granted, duping in that D1 was ridiculously easy, and banning was non existent. Perhaps what we need in this game is what we needed in that one - a legit community of traders who are trustworthy and only trade weapons / armor exclusively with one another.
---
It really bothers me when I see people who have a TSE of literally every desirable weapon in the game, who clearly haven't farmed for them. That goes for both the P2W players as well as the dupers, and the friends of dupers who enable them. At 300+ hours and a combined level of over 500 if you count all my characters, I've never seen a TSE. I've seen ONE BE weapon. And I farm in the most efficient way possible, and get 75-100 legendaries an hour, and the people I meet who have all these items have no idea how to farm efficiently, so I know they didn't acquire them legitimately.
---
Basically, I hate people who don't earn their way. Games are supposed to be about putting everyone on an even footing, and you get out of it what you put into it. The end game of Fallout 76 is all about progressing with gear and experimenting with different builds. If people just buy/dupe their way into it, that's no fun. 
---
Why can these people build magic staircase houses, but when i try to delete one set of stairs it says I cant because ‚Äúpart of your camp will be floating‚Äù
---
You cannot stash them. If you pick up more than one, it basically just lumps them all together and will count as one data delivered when you hand them in.
---
You used to be able to stash them in the beginning, but this changed a few updates ago.
---
So any suggestions for a smoother turn around? I know there was the awkward half step then turn and ran. I feel like without the half step it would have been ok (I was trying to look at the Bos then run when the raiders turned)-player who was the lone settler jumped by raiders and wants to do better in the future.
---
&gt;Well, I'm the type of guy   
---
&gt;Who likes to roam around... 
---
I suspect you're right. 
---
Isn't the camera part of your gear?
---
No you can't they are a quest item. And you cant stack them. You could pick up 10 it would still say you have 1. If I find more than one in an area I bounce and forth turning one in at a time. Some times its worth it.
---
You should definitely at very least get Twisted Muscles
---
Thank you very much!
---
Oh ok. Thanks for replying. So no point in picking up more than one at a time? 
---
I asked because I had like ten in my stash for a while. Must have been pre patch. 
---
Pleasure. 
---
You aren't as rich as you think. Cailibrated shocks are 6000ish. Jet packs and stealthboys are 6000ish. 
---
Try modding a suit of power armor with 7000 caps and see how far you get.
---
Lmao exactly, you tell me then man. You're the one concerned and commenting about it. 
---
I still have 30 in my stash that I picked up before I started the BOS questline. The quest only starts when you find one in the wild though. I tried everything to get my stashed ones to work.
---
The issue is we can already be raiders of the wasteland and be raiders. 
---
That just doesnt make any sense either.
---
Also, handing in multiple will not give better/more loot. I think handing in multiple within a shorter time period may influence results but I‚Äôm not totally sure.
---
Tue player was gone by the time I figured everything out. It looks like it was in the process of getting taken over but the player left the area.
---
In watoga :)
---
I‚Äôll be on tonight after 6. I‚Äôll hit you up. 
---
Ah. The internet callback...
---
In the 90‚Äôs most of us were cautious but optimistic - rightfully so, too. Who would have guessed the World Wide Web would house the perfect opportunity to become a faceless, cowardly, and completely apathetic individual to the common man.
---
It comes to mind every so often. Sometimes I think the general populous, including myself, shouldn‚Äôt have access to the internet. There‚Äôs really no need for it. Communities were much tighter and friendlier before the late 90‚Äôs/00‚Äôs.
---
No need to reply. Didn‚Äôt mean to rant. It‚Äôs just the field I work in; I see so many people being jackasses through the internet because they know they don‚Äôt need to take credit for their actions, and it‚Äôs just sad. I‚Äôm sure in another world, had you and OP met in person, you wouldn‚Äôt nearly have had the apathetic response you did. 
---
Then again, the whole original post is the product of someone being a jackass on the internet despite someone not caring to duel them...
---
I think this may be the case- every time I submit more than 3 in one session I often get a rare outfit. 
---
Explosive eats through durability... I really don't like it anymore. It does a small damage increase for a gigantic upkeep cost increase. That being said, 500 ish rounds out of a gatling can kill 10 ish mobs. More if you're not in a nuke zone. My gatling typically 1 or 2 shots lvl 68 conqueror ghouls
---
Except a leather jacket isn't the same as actual leather armor.  It's a little different.  I recommend looking into how leather armor is actually constructed.
---
As for them dropping it, did we drop ballistic weapons the moment someone invented a bullet-proof vest?  No?
---
Maybe without the purple eye thing, rather would not have my clothing ruined with that
---
I had a few stashed from early days (collecting technical data must be ingrained in me after fallout 4!). Like you say, when I took one out the stash it didn't trigger the quest. However I did put one in a random world container, took it out. Still didnt trigger. But it triggered the next log in. Maybe that will still work?
---
Or you could play RuneScape.
---
Parts to lose, not loose.
---
You often lose loose parts however.
---
No flux required to build it, just nuclear material. 
---
They better roll this out quick because they won‚Äôt have players left to enjoy it at this rate 
---
nope
---
"Sometimes" if you take one out your stash, drop it in a paper bag, then pick it up the quest will appear again. But this doesn't always work for some reason. I had 40 in my stash last week, now I'm down to 17 I think.
---
Playing on xbox.  Not possible because I take note of everyone I'm  in an event with just in case I get disconnected. I also interact with them after events to trade or team up. These names that follow me, I never met them.
---
That would be an option. Basicly the optical one would allow the player to apply X-01 eye lamps to their eyes with out one their eyes are normal. 
---
I might try that next time. I tried various combinations of dropping/placing in containers/ swapping between multiple players. 
---
What's the difference?
---
There's this one: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/253
---
It has clean interior walls for brick. But the author is expanding it and would probably do wood if suggested to. 
---
Tesla shotgun still uses rifleman perks.
---
Semi-auto also uses rifleman perks.
---
Auto uses commando perks.
---
Lob Tesla I don't know.
---
Shotgun barrel using rifleman is most likely a bug :) 
---
take my updoot
---
This post is awesome, thanks for sharing it here. You got me thinking about that land off to the wast and there are [cargo bots that circle there](https://imgur.com/a/BQgv6al) so maybe.
---
I think it unlocks at lvl 32 or 34.
---
I bought a dense combat armor mod recently, they still show up. (Pheonix in watoga) 
---
Dense mod is for chest only and as far as I'm concerned, they are essential. Protects you from exploding cars. Explosive guns. Scorchbeasts. Grenades. 
---
However you gotta do it, get that sense chest mod.
---
Hello, that's great. I'm back to 2 1080s but SLI works a bit bad in this game. Haven't tried different SLI bits yet but it works on one 1080 with plenty of headroom + the reshade.
---
But yes, still using it. I've been playing with my new one for a while. 
---
Link: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/234
---
It's not overkill but gives the game what it needs to look kinda like a 2019 game to me. Might be wrong. XD
---
our first DLC is in 4 days! It then comes in on a weekly based schedule 
---
Good thing they nerfed demolitions expert. Imagine if you were able to do 2/10ths of their health. 
---
Yes it did indeed. There was a doctor at a clinic ne  of new Vegas on its outskirts that could install them for you. A very popular overhaul mod called  project Nevada expanded and published the system significantly.
---
If you just want the mod it will be 1500 caps
---
U can craft a legendary effect? What?
---
I'm level 32 right now. Still nothing
---
I really enjoy them myself. Anytime I pass one where it seems someone is struggling with powering it up, I make it a point to pop in and help.
---
Nice!  I can't wait to try it.  That's been my big hold up...performance and graphical quality.  I know it's a BGS game but should still look as good as FO4 in my opinion and so far it hasn't.   Granted, I had everything cranked up and no reshade so should be fun to tinker later tonight.   I'll test your new one too.  Do you make any changes in the Nvidia Control panel? Thanks again. 
---
the only human NPC I want to see is Abbie.
---
Creampie
---
&gt;SPECULATION: The fact they clumped this specifically with Player Vending gives me the notion there might be a possibility to have items on display be for sale, but that‚Äôs just me.
---
Same. Literally the first thing I thought of was a bar selling Nuka-Cola's and Purified Water + The new brewed stuff
---
Then its lvl 34....should un lock soon
---
LVL 12
---
Time zone Amsterdam
---
I have discord
---
Yes, you can sustain AP with resources, making these things a little bit more resource demeanding or forcing Chameleon/sentinel to move more frequently. It is also right that Chameleon and Sentinel do not work hand in hand, but I can definitely see someone rely on Chameleon untill he is spotted and then to just stand up and be pretty much safe, potentially building up some degree of heal, the removal of RADs, or to then reposition or to finish the target with better defenses.
---
Happened to me before, the corpse just evaporated and no meat pile whatsoever on clean ground. But most of the time it just became a tiny pile the same size as other meat piles. The laziness in the handling of such important details is just ridiculous. 
---
I'm sure someone will data mine it and spoil it in the title so yeah, I feel ya.
---
I think the lasers change from red to green. I know a dude with a laser gatling sawed me half with bright green last weekend.
---
Yeah know I guess I should have put wish instead of hope. 
---
There are a few VATS bug fixes coming in Patch 7 next week. Last I checked this is one of 'em!
---
Yeah, the pop up at the workshop says "other players can initiate PVP by attempting to claim it" but that doesn't mean you have to be at the workshop for that to happen.

I only use the Gatling &amp; 50 Cal. TSE for Queen Battles, other times, it's a TSE Handmade with a TSE Lever Backup, and my Primary weapon is an Instigating DC Gauntlet.
---
Great idea, I've never played NV so I didn't really know implants were a thing. I know Kellogg had them in FO4.
---
This is the kinda content that would me great for future DLC. I'd take something like this over brews any day.
---
only in Atom store. certain mods will change appearance, though. ie shadow, etc
---
Haha, for real though, apt username.
---
yep... my 1\* super mutants in west tek scream some times: RETREAT... and i have to chase them... strange
---
I think it would be cool, If your on a Team of four they should have a way to overlap four circles together. It should be a requirement that one you overlap to make sure the build areas are touching. Currently the circles are pretty big and it feels like almost one circle space is saved between the next person building near you, no possible way to connect now at all.
---
My alts were there at level 7 tearing s*** up
---
YouTubers bad? 
---
Nice thanks!
---
Nice. Ima build my camp around it... travellin' stage setup.
---
Here Is the discord link. I might can get on late tonight
---
https://discord.gg/DNbJEus
---
Because you anchored another piece to your staircase. 
---
So to engage on pvp ppl just snack each other and await a reaction? Otherwise if not they leave the other person alone?
---
I like the idea. But I'd really like them to fix a few things first. 
---
Example: I built my structure without any real issues. Then I removed a wall so I could run some half-flooring outside like a catwalk. When I went to put the wall back it wouldn't snap without a campfire. 
---
Example 2: Same structure. But in the process of adding a door to the upstairs, only the barred security door would snap. Nothing else would. I had to use the campfire to add a door.
---
Example 3: I would also like the ability to flip the wall face without some major trickery involved. Just a simple left or right bumper action. 
---
Example 4: How come things like foundations and water pump acknowledge ground slope, but that's about it? My entire garden is floating. It looks ridiculous. 
---
Example 5: Please allow a little bit of environmental clipping. It's so nice on games like Ark to turn off collision and build into the features of the landscape around you. I found a sweet-ass recess in the rock cliff near Top of the World that would be naturally protected from 3 sides, leaving only the front exposed. But of course I can't even collide a little bit with the terrain. (Maybe I should try the campfire trick)
---
Example 6: How about allowing us to snap flooring to the edges of a foundation? If I have a second story floor, I can run catwalk around it with the half-floor pieces. But you can't snap anything to the edges of the foundation block floor. 
---
is there a way to influence the machine, ie. gun bashing it or hitting it? i have Luck 3 and have triggered these thousands of times now probably. no pie :(
---
Yeah I have those ones but most of the time, like Tesla and gatling laser, they fall under heavy weapons 
---
I would like both. IT would encourage thought on build. you use brews for your temp buffs implants and mutations for your long buffs all to specialize your character.  
---
withe the S.P.E.C.I.A.L stuff oddly being the most generic the rest are used to make your actual build 
---

All I wish is that the lamp on the combat helmet worked.
---
That was more of a rhetorical question based in complaint and frustration, but yes, that is why it happens.
---
Are you often in a team?  Equipping even just level of rad sponge AND SHARING is probably the biggest benefit you can get with just a 1 pt investment.  Even better if you can get your teammate to do the same with ghoulish.
---
Well at least its something to scour the land for.  Youd think a vendor would have the laser.
---
I've got a level 220+ character, and I'm worried about my crafting recipes. All the calibrated shock and jetpack plans. My BOS combat armor plans. I won't be prestiging him until I know more.
---
About Shear Terror, the sketch on the top left looks like it's definitely Sheepsquatch
---
I got a level 35 TSE 50 cal last week.
---
Is adequate.
---
They don't get exp from the kills tho so it's kind of stupid.
---
I believe they also said that they were increasing and introducing more no build areas for CAMPs.  They didn't specify where, but I would be willing to bet the Whitespring clubhouse being #1 on their list.
---
&gt; Hunting rifles are the best weapon early on. 
---
Heavier than pipe bolt action and no more powerful.
---
I only have one decent energy weapon, and that is a explosive 4x mag laser rifle. Fully modded with a splitter barrel and a 124 round cell, i can¬¥t empty the mag even once. The adjuments mentioned in the article sound right to me. We will see.
---
With like 9 more points put into stealth and sneak damage!
---
Because they would be ashamed to show their face around the club if you beat them.
---
"Run Away!" -- Legendary Super Mutant.
---
That's... Walmart, though.
---
They price the shit when it come sin the door, and it sits on the floor at that price until someone gives enough of a shit to change it (which is rarely).
---
Haven't you noticed they still have years OLD games, movies, systems etc at "new" pricing?
---
I am almost certain that the turret owner has to physically attack the ghouls at least once themselves to get the xp and loot. 
---
Not on my installation.  It was still making my stuff bright pink as of the last update.  Do the updates not replace those files?
---
The base price for a One X is 499.99, I got mine a year ago unbundled in a flash sale for 399.99.
---
You could have bought the bundle directly from Microsoft for 399.99, **and** gotten a 2nd free game.
---
Your post doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
I "discovered" vault 94 enrance last night. 
---
  The terminal in the guard shack talks about pastor so and so, and sending busses to pickup up the pastor and his people, implying the original inhabitants may have been passive (or given the nature of the game, a cult), of sorts.
---
The interior terminal specifically references the requirement for an ID card to gain entry.
---
This is hysterical. Thanks for the laugh.
---
Agreed. Feels like I'm helping out the entire server (or at least my region of it). Wish there were more events like this *moment of silence for "Feed the People"*.
---
Look at the roadmap, it has dates for each update.
---
Thats a 1Tb system? Ive only seen 500gb for that cheap
---
There‚Äôs a few options check this one.

---
Which part?
---
The dude trying to survive? Or the junkie-trash that does nothing but look for drugs?
---
Not the same, but after 200 hours I finally discovered the auto-grenade launcher. Badass looking weapon. I had about 100 40mm stashed, and I couldn't wait to level mobs. 
---
Of course you know how this story goes, so why finish it.
---
Just.. play it as you want to. Have fun. 
---
Yes, both do. Ripper is 1H, but appears to be level locked to 40. Buzz blade is 2H. 
---
how did it feel to sell and scrap ammo? describe it slowly to me so I can reminisce.
---
This is an aside, but does anyone have a source for this comment on Pacifist mode?  I keep seeing references to "Someone at Bethesda said this," but not links.
---
76 doesn't almost stop the action while you carefully decide which body part to shoot, and then send you into an animation when you make a kill shot.
---
This is a great idea and would definitely add some end game variety along with further unique character builds.
---
The implants should also add some small visual changes to your character. Such as scars at the sight. Eyes have a slight glow for ocular implants. Bulging veins or other sci-fi stereotypical wires and such for strength/speed mods. 
---
The Nukashine DLC is a permanent addition to the game, not an event. However, the Fastnacht parade will last for one week starting March 19.
---
I think they removed most kill animations, or at least I havent seen them. In fallout 4, ghouls used to have an animation where they bite you in the neck, killing you instantly. Dogs also had an animation to rip the throat out. And deathclaws had one where they smashed your body into the ground. 
---
Maybe instakill is difficult to implement in a multiplayer game? *shrugs*
---
Hmmm I haven't been asked this before! As far as I know there are no plans, but again I haven't been asked this so I have never asked. I can add this to the list though :)
---
This would be a fun way of doing it. Maybe create a grid (like 4 plots on a city block format) and allow each player to only occupy those predetermined areas so all that it would have to check is if square C8 was occupied or open. 
---
Yep, new 1 TB system.
---
Sentinel is still hella easy to break through.
---
Sure, that is the risk of owning a workshop.  You should only be able to be killed ONCE if you have Pacifist mode on and you own a workshop AND you choose to fight back.  If you don't choose to fight back, you should lose the workshop after a reasonable timer.  Once the workshop ownership is taken from you (because you died or because the timer ran out) then you should be able to choose to retaliate and fight for it or you can choose to let it go.  If you let it go, then they shouldn't be able to attack you again.
---
Making PvP optional will make it a lot more fun for people that don't want to be dragged into it without their choice.  Making PvP heavy servers will be a lot more fun for people that want PvP all the time.   They don't need to get rid of PvP on Adventure servers, but they need to dial it back a couple notches from its current ill-planned-out form.
---
the latter. 
---
That strikes me as so funny for some reason. 
---
I've run into players badly in need of food out in the middle of nowhere. I'm just imagining some junky begging me for psycho.
---
What if you aren't?
---
I find the biggest challenge with the SBQ is that she kicks out a ton of Rads these days - like 8-12/sec for me - and I'm not entirely sure if that's intentional or not.  It means that I basically *need* to retreat at some point to RadAway myself, or use Power Armor (which, then, makes an Unarmed built not very feasible for her).
---
I have some stashed and the quest is available every single time i log into a new server. Doesn't consume them either. I've basically had unlimited technical data for 2 months now. 
---
I beat the sbq for the first time a couple months ago. Have beaten her a few more times since, and I'm 90% sure I have explored every location in the game. I'm still finding tons of ways to have fun.
---
Like right now, I've taken to finding lower levels and crafting guns or care packages for them. I've built my own little one man vault/workshop and created my own lore about it, inviting people there where I give them some of the ridiculous amount of stuff I've amassed. Or I wander the waste offering trades to everyone as a travelling merchant.
---
Y'know...roleplaying.
---
I think the only mod available for the LMG is the prime receiver.
---
We do have Survival mode coming which is a PvP experience. It will start off in beta so we can adjust and alter it based off player feedback. 
---
You probably have it already unlocked but you did not get the card to pop. Wait until level 35 when you get a pack of 4 cards also check your new cards every level. 
---
Radicool is one point of END and TM is a mutation, so perk point capacity isn‚Äôt an issue there methinks.
---
I don‚Äôt think it matters, I seemed to regularly learn mods from scraping level 25 lever actions. 
---
I really think that should depend heavily on the implant. Something like the pheromone idea would have no visuals but if you replace your arms with cyborg ones yeah that should have visual differences. 
---
Except for the instigating (?) Gatling plasma they are all worthless, yes.
---
level doesn't matter.
---
Make sure you use the perks when you can to ensure the following:
---
* They cheaper to make
---
* Chance of double crafting item
---
* More junk when scrapping
---
Found a really good mole miner gauntlet. I put on the clean steel workers uniform, hat and gas mask and now I am the moleman.
---
I upgraded from 8gb no namer ram to 16gb 2400hz and the game runs much smoother. I did this primarily for anthem, but was ecstatic when it boosted fo76...1050ti, old i7 quad core approx 2.7ghz, 144hz monitor with 1ms response 0p. I run low to med settings with 40 to 80 fps depending on what I'm doing. Before I upgraded ram, I was like 30 to 50 fps
---
I can't elaborate on it just yet. We will share more detailed information on it as we get closer to its release- which is currently planned on our roadmap for April 9th. 
---
I believe it does recognize more than one - but I'm not sure if the loot table changes. Still, delivering one seems to give 350xp while delivering more than one (any number) gives 400xp so *something's* different.
---
(Note that you must do this in the same session that you picked them up - if you log out the "internal" count will be reset to one.)
---
Hell yea that‚Äôs a nice setup.
---
Option D: Burn it with fire!!!!
---
I have 9 luck and no luck whatsoever getting the pie, activate every one I see, but to be truthful, I don't spam the machine for more than 2-3 tries. Got 'em all the time in previous fallout games
---
The have said they are expanding the no-build areas for future content, and mentioned they would be looking at expanding the area around whitesprings to prevent this.
---
They are also changing the camp budget system, making many objects cost less but putting a hard-limit on things like turrets to prevent turret farms.
---
I would have thought the Enclave and the Brotherhood to be the best fit. I would imagine that military implants would have been fairly widespread pre-war
---
Yep!  I, too, thought it was Sarah Silverman doing the voice acting at first. 
---
And thats in canadian dollars? They rake me through the coals on shipping and duties as well. 
---
welcome to the club. Been here since BETA highest level 58 so, yeah ... take your time.
---
Yes it does
---
Yeah, that's pretty much the playstyle. 
---
"I've got some ammo... got any med-x?"
---
"I found this flamethrower, man... trade it for some buffout"
---
Wow, that is definitely not the case for me. I tried with a couple other people, and we made every drop/swap/place combination we could think of, trying to get it to pop. I can take 1 or all of them out of my stash in any combination, and I've never gotten it to work. If I have some in my inventory and find one in game, it does combine them all, and then the quest starts.
---
I might try grabbing one everytine I log out now to see if that works.
---
I jump up next to them unlock them and then enter Transfer mode and loot them from the ground.
---
I think the general consensus is that it's a bug.
---
Range maters for flying enemies or at long range but so many enemies change the player quickly that it‚Äôs not as large an advantage as many other games. 
---
Every major retailer has prices similar to this. Ao youre telling me Microsoft refuses to drop the base system price. But will offer you the same system at a discounted price because it comes with a "AAAA" game. That's not reall how they've worked in the past. I paid 100$ over retail for my forza edition Xbox One? 
---
Great! This made my crap feeling even worse.  My max damage output was 270 until yesterday and since the problem from yesterday its 150 (all rise)
---
I have no idea how to get stats like this.  My level 40 TSE shotgun did around 240 damage until yesterday.  Now it does like 140.  Using shotgunner, expert shotgunner, master shotgunner, bloody mess, enforcer etc.  Base damage for the dragon is 200.  Mine does 186, with perks.  
---
I am happy for you but dont understand a) how this is possible  b) my "normal" stats are fucked
---
Brotherhood seems more concerned about archiving and destroying then used. And MODUS literally blew up the wing where it would be. 
---
That and the space suit as well.
---
This happened to me right outside the station. But I heard gunfire, yet nothing was around. Turns out it was lag and a HERD of super mutants, maybe a dozen to fifteen lower-level super mutants just appeared out of nowhere. Freaked out due to the volume and my health was already at half and dropping but eventually killed them all once I started moving. It was bizarre. 
---
What you paid for a Forza bundle is your problem. 
---
Shop around. 
---
Oh, haha. I maaaybe skimmed that part.
---
That is totally my bad, apologies!
---
Did you just call pugs ugly?
---
Thank you for the replies
---
And this is why I despise the tse nerf. I was in EMS earlier and it had super mutants spawn. One shot from my tse pump took around a quarter of the boss's health but killed me straight away with full health. I always felt that the ability to blow yourself up very easily was a worthwhile trade off for the power of the guns
---
Try to make some Nuka Grenades. Those are fun and will absolutely blow your face off. Not the Nuka Quantum grenades, those are all flash and no damage.
---
Totally agree.  I'm just keeping a simple CAMP for now until the fix these griefing problems.
---
Yeah, im in the same boat currently.  I find barbarian, ironclad, blocker, evasive, and serendipity are enough to make me feel ok tank-wise in a hust a rad suit.  Problem is that its a huge perk sink and the rad suit often breaks (dont think its protected by white knight).  
---
Got lifegiver currently, but hopeful that switching to wome combo of rad resist, sun kissed, and rad sponge will be enough to supoort a no-hazmat nuke zone build eventually.  Even with rad sponge, i think you need some legendary pieces with decent rad resist and the radiation legendary effect unfortunately.  So i think ill wind up with a nuke zone armor set and a regular set.
---
Dont forget to stock up on radshield when you can!
---
The silos are automated.  There is some unseen mechanism that manufactures the missiles, which is also why each silo has a "reconstruction time" after launching one.
---
They were 100 over retail everywhere at the time. You want more? You pay more. That's how shit works.
---
Option E: Reopen the freak show
---
rather ingenious little twist I would say.  At least you have a good attitude about it
---
No worries :) our dollar is crap. Envious of your prices.
---
X-01 power armor has excellent radiation resistance especially with Rad-X or just take ghoulish perk and become more or less invincible. Especialy when paired with Rad sponge on a team.
---
Outstanding.....Sweet Setup and Kit load out.
---
How about EB Games or Best Buy? They all just share the same pricing strategies and models I assume?
---
how do u see the spoil meter/timer?
---
Yeah I guess I'll habe to wait and see. I see everyone says level 30 though
---
No, it isn't "how shit works".
---
It's called being patient and shopping around. It's called "bundles are often loss leaders at value pricing when compared to the separate components".
---
I get it, you desperately want to roll in here and make this about how shitty the game you've never played it... that bundle has been that price since it came out. It's not "discounted"... it is what it's always been.
---
I love it so much! I have that scheduled to be shared on our Fallout twitter next FanartFriday :D
---
(Side note, if any of you like doing fanart please tag me or Fallout in your posts so we can see them! I love seeing the art you all create!)
---
Yeah, we really need more info on this. And someone willing to test it once it goes live because I have a feeling that this might not work as intended. 
---
Your ok with seal clubbing but draw the line with ugly pugs?  What's your pugs name hopefully something cool to make up for that face a mother could only love.
---
FO76 bundle has been sub $500 since it dropped at the local Best Buy, since day 1.
---
That would be so so creepy and so cool!
---
Yes matey, we're also friends :) you showed me the stingwings! 
---
NEOCRON.
---
I didn't get a reddit notice that you messaged me...my bad. Side note I got you a lvl 40 legendary berserker flamer along  with the one I'll make for you. Got it off a ghoul drop last night and I don't want it...its yours
---
I've definitely mentioned this to the Dev's in the past! It's a hot topic on this subreddit.
---
Exactly, an engineering build has so many possibilities in the FO76 world, it's frustrating to me that Bethesda completely overlooked it.  
---
We could even expand it into workshops with an autoscrap perk card that transfers to autoscrapped junk to your inventory.  That would make workshops far more valuable to the engineers and ammo makers.
---
Upon release of the Fallout 76 bundle it was 120$ over retail. Basically making you overpay for the game and the month of live. Months later its 130 below. 
---
I'll give you a 3/5 for your terrible defense of a terrible game.
---
Because of the things we see with the Rad-Rat/Sentry Bot and Stingwing/Sentry Bot hybrids, I'm convinced there's some kind of obscure inheritance issue where enemies can take on incorrect properties from alternative spawns in the same area.  I don't know how it works either, but it might explain other weird cases like non-Legendary Legendaries and this damage bug.
---
It's too late. The imbeciles who feel they have the right to harass people who aren't interested in PvP have already chased off part of the player base. 
---
This game was sold as a PvP game that would allow players to opt out. Opting out was what attracted people who loved the Fallout series, but weren't at all interested in PvP. That's Bethesda's core.
---
It's time for them to allow us to enjoy their game without having to hop servers to avoid PvP. 
---
I'm currently completely built around a Bloody Heavy Guns. Explosive Gatling and BE Minigun. After patch I'll try Bloody Laser Gatling.
---
While not as powerful as sneak/crit vats builds or explosive shotguns, it's still strong enough to decimate everything in 1 second, and 80 SB or Mirelurk Queens in a handful of seconds.
---
You want all heavy gunner perks, stabilized, bloodymess, nerd ragen, adrenaline, and adrenal reaction.
---
Only possible with bloodied set up really. Cornerstones are bloodied weapon, adrenaline mutation and nerd rage. No chems or other buffs used here. I can post my perks if you want :)
---
Get Fireproof perk. 
---
What province do you live in that was offering those prices, because Ontario sure didn't. At least around me.
---
I'm hoping wastelanders will end up with a separate main quest that leads to you helping out someone from another vault who ends up as your permanent follower. Basically right now the roadmap feels like "lets add in all the stuff you might find in a FO4 mod", which isn't a bad thing, so it seems logical that getting a follower NPC would end up as one of the things they add. Also one of the images in either the nuclear winter or wastelanders parts suggested a robot, so whether the follower would be a robot (easy to res at your camp by downloading their program/consciousness) or a human NPC who can't be killed - just downed, who knows.
---
Never heard of that. 
---
Funny, because I bought my copy of the game from a friend living in Ontario... that paid exactly that price.
---
I'm in SK.
---
I don't know, but I wish I had more paint options for it.
---
Even really basic, solid color options.  I've never found any Paints other than the BoS Initiate and the ones in the Atom Store.
---
Depends on level.
---
Option F: lvl 50+, release it in Flatwoods
---
Option G: under lvl 50, put it my stash until player vending happens.
---
I would like to see them need a rare drop as well...for some of the things anyway.  Either requiring Flux (raw or stable, either one)...or requiring some kind of part...especially for the special implants or the pheromone ones.  Mutation implants ought to require the mutation serum  and or flux.  Can add a rare animal part (drop rates will be an experiment, increased chance from legendaries of type, increased chance from glowing of that type) that is required for some things as well.  
---
Maybe make some use of some of the less well used drops like firefly fluid and tick blood?  
---
Lots of options.  
---
Overall I like the idea, give us a little more customizations.  I wouldn't really recommend mutation implants directly...but perhaps pseudo-mutations (the do something similar, but with less effect)...or even some things that mutations dont actually exist for.  Instead of talons and twisted muscles we can get "Claws" (add bleed to unarmed attacks only) and "Burst strength" (increase damage from power attacks, but no boost to STR overall).  We could get "Burst of Speed" (increased sprint speed for increased AP cost to sprint...but not the same as speed demon).  Things like that, some of the legendary effects and/or some of the armor effects, but not the same as the mutations themselves.
---
A good way to do this which (I think) would be implementable would be a "join CAMP" option in the main menu. 
---
The players' materials remains their own, but anyone in the group is using / moving / building in the same CAMP. 
---
To keep people from hogging real estate, the green circle maybe only gets 10-20 percent bigger the more people you have. Limit 5 or 10.
---
If someone pulls out of your CAMP group, whole structure goes away but you get your mats back. So you'd have to choose wisely when teaming up with way, instead of building with randos. 
---
Happened to me last night farming Whitesprings. Goddamn 3 star bloated glowing ghoul saw all his friends getting murdered and looted before they even hit the ground, turned tail and said 'NOPE! NOT TODAY!. Thankfully got stuck on a cliff.
---
Unless you have teammates sharing a lot of perks, i don't see either of those surviving a nuke zone outside a hazmat suit or a ton of radaway.
---
I wouldn't say we "need" more, since it's a few months away still. More like " I'm very curious". I've got a lower level character that I'll probably experiment with if the whole process is still totally obtuse.
---
The whole PvP exchange is pretty much finding the right combination of stuff to use in a rock, paper, scissors match. Sometimes it's just a matter of swapping out a card. Sometimes it's changing your play style. But often times it's set in stone and it's because your build isn't right for it. That's the PvP game. A good enough amount of people enjoy that.
---
Probably shoot it. Ghouls dont age. Poor thing is stuck as a baby its entire life, best thing that can happen to it is going feral. Nah man, take it out of its misery.
---
There are various challenge fixes scheduled for this patch!
---
Please do!
---
Would someone be kind enough to explain how to get these stats?   My legendary double barrel shotgun with two effects did around 215 damage untill yesterday (now around 120).  I had at least 10-12 perk cards with an impact on damage.  But how to get from 215 to over a 1000? Does not seem possible with a mutation or certain food / drinks?
---
Fair. I was adopting an Eden-esque voice for the sake of familiarity. At the moment we just deliver government aid to other vault dwellers and patrol Appalachia together. 
---
Multiplayer-built bases/cities was THE REASON I got behind 76 in the first place. I spent so long desperately searching for information on this before launch, and I think I projected my high expectations of this mechanic onto the game before discovering that it "doesn't really work that way". I don't know if there is any way for them to make this work, considering how persistence works on the servers, but it would be a huge motivator for me to keep playing.
---
Which one? The one I got from crashed space station definitely goes over my armor 
---
Baby ghouls exist? 
---
That's funny because I remember seeing the bundle at release and it was not that cheap. Maybe your friend bought it within weeks of it crashing? 
---
How lucrative do you think baby Ghoul vending would be? 
---
Could we buy costumes in the atom shop maybe?
---

They need to fix the game before they can do anything else. Ever since the explosive weapon patch nothing ya been right at one time. 
---
Good job Bethesda. 
---
Bingo
---
Me and a few other folks formed a group last night with the intent of farming the shit outta the fasnacht event.
---
Maybe, In my limited experience. I walk up the building and my screen start s shaking from all the rocket turret rounds slamming into the back of the building. I did not see another player the last time it happened but that doesn't mean the he didn't lay down a mine or fire from his platform.
---
They weren't insta-kills as much as they were finishers when you reached a certain health percentage.  They removed all of them probably due to the multiplayer aspect as you mentioned, which seems to be the same reason gore was also toned down.  It probably would have been tough to make enemies perform killing animations and have the possibility they can be interrupted by other players who might try to save a player in the process of being killed, if at all.
---
Whatever the reason, not only did it result in enemies no longer having kill animations, but also players from performing melee and unarmed finisher animations too.
---
Cool. I thought that removed your armor as well. My mistake. Does it give you any Rad resistance like the hazmat suit?
---
Do they get to loot the corpses?
---
Here are my perks: 
---
No chems or foods used here. Adrenaline mutation is a must.
---
Well there goes my Nick Valentine origin story theory. &gt;! The original one before he was replaced by a Synth !&lt;
---
u/ladydevann
---
put it in a suitcase at Morgantown, or the overseers stash at camp or Flatwoods, or all three.  I do this at the end of my play everyday if I can with all my unwanted ammo.
---
 Yeah I took one off a Wendigo. Cute name, I sold it to The Bunker, for I think 19 caps. ;)
---
God awful idea that invites even more NV snobs to whine about FO76 not being new NV, they should stick to the F076 model and focus on mutations.
---
Dude if you don't want to use it as primary, I'd buy it. Name your price in caps, or let me know what you're looking for. I'm a heavy weapons bloodied exclusive build, been looking for something like that forever. 
---
Annoying part is both games have characters with implants the player just can't get them. The most notable one is Kellogg in four. 
---
 I chop about a 10th ... but with a real fast dagger. Killed a Mirelurk Queen with my daggers yesterday. ;)
---
Sorry to inform you that if you shoot them they get a hole in the pelt so you have to use a club.
---
Outstanding.
---
I personally would be willing to give up CAMP size in order to combine locations with another player.
---
Super excited.  
---
With my prototype hazmat suit it works well.
---
No they don't it's more of a hypothetical question
---
Over 200+ people disagree with you. Please leave your vial back on the other forum. [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/327160/concept-implants?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/327160/concept-implants?language%5B%5D=en)  
---
Oh wait I blocked you there.
---
I'd have to check, but I'd assume it'd be paltry if it does :/
---
I have to wonder with "no build zones" soon, that may just be a thing of the past.
---
It's caused by lag as near as I can tell... And I've had it happen when fighting the same type of enemies before. 
---
That is encouraging.

Its one of the top comments

Well if you accidentally swallowed a legendary Fatman and a crazy treasure hunter was running around trying to rip it out of your stomach, you'd be running too. But yeah, they are annoying.
---
I miss that ability, to save FIRST before you leap.
---
But of course, why focus on the new and much better mutation system when you can live in the past of NV!
---
Don't have a mike.
---
If you do have a mike please turn it off when your kid starts shouting, or when you start shouting at your wife.
---
It's hit and miss, one of my daily routines is checking out front of Whitesprings to look for random mobs.  Sometimes they do like to run away, sometimes they don't.  I had a suspicion it had something to do with stealth, but haven't gotten any kind of proof, so I'm not sure yet.
---
I know of two. The electrical tower in the valley south of flatwoods. And west of the thunder power sub station on the road. Had at the least 10 spawns 
---
Turret farms lolz
---
Can I get silicone?
---
I always take a pix of my recent players list right before I launch.  If you get disconnected, look up one of the players gamertag and join their game through their profile.  You don't have to be friended to do it  through the profile like you do from recent players list
---
Awesome! Thanks for the response!
---
To quote Dr. Gonzo: "Goddamn, what a bummer."
---
Actually it is from two not NV. 
---
Yeah level don‚Äôt matter. And with scrapping having he scrapper perk on will net you some of your resources back. 
---
You get the helmet / gas mask protection, I know.
---
No, it sucks now. You have to kill the player contesting it, to stop them from taking the workshop. Which is complete bullshit when it's 2 or more vs 1, because any teammate left inside the build zone can immediately start contesting again.
---
Even if you kill one or two of them, their teammates can just FT back continually with little to no penalties. And, once they take it, you have to spend the caps to contest it from them
---
With 3 of them, you would literally have clear them all out before any of them could FT back. The last update to workshops gave attackers **every advantage**. 
---
My biggest gripe with the game at the moment (if you couldn't tell).
---
chest slot, takes both. +4 charisma if female. -15 charisma if male. 
---
I have noticed that you get the generator plans in order. Big generator, then windmill, then fusion. So it will take a few runs to get them all.
---
After getting used to the layout of the power plants I do enjoy powering up.

 Wow 200 out of that, pat yourself on the back!
---
Not ok with killing baby animals at all.
---
Thanks!
---
That would be awesome I know at least 20 local players including me that would love this to happen and thats not including the long distance pals we have that play with us from time to time. We fill an entire server in some cases when we are all playing together. So having larger team player slots means we could see each others camps and workshops more easily and be more capable of fluid game play especially during pvp or pve engagements where separated teams becomes very complicated. I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many times I have gotten so frustrated that I have died due to pvp right after a pve engagement because I was trying to switch pacifist off to engage the new pvp threat. Its just clunky and makes it impossible to defend against forced pvp properly. But other than that I think things are going well with updates, patches, and such. Maybe if asked I would suggest, increased team size, increase the stash space again or rebuild the weight systems of all items, create a server or world wide pa system where players can advertise items for sale to all players in their world, player vending machines asap, capability to adjust prices of items sold to npc vendor bots (i.e. make a serum cheaper so it can be sold to the vendor), and maybe make plans and ammo sellable to npc vendors. Just some random ideas if were considering items to change. Thank you for your time and continued product production!!!! War? War never changes.. 
---
"unforeseen mechanism"  
---
Is that supposed to be good story telling?  With everything that goes into making a nuke in the first place the world should only have a few left over assuming the electronics havnt been completely fried by the previous nuke drops.  It would take a human engineer to be able to fix that stuff.  We are supposed to suspend our knowledge of how electronics work just so nukes can pop into existence via "unforseen mechanisms".  I can understand how the core generators work at poseidon. How the food crafting works at flatwoods since the machine would use normal cooking methods to make the food edible.  The munitions factory can even be explained by having a stock pile of ore acid and gun power which it uses to create the ammo requested.  There is no viable explanation for the nukes at the rate that people can drop them.  
---
Sorry my previous replay I had misunderstood what part of my post you were responding to.  I removed it and fixed my misunderstanding.  
---
Yeah, in this game, TOWNS like that would just become grief bait. 
---
It's a hypothetical post however if they did exist I'd finally know how many baby ghouls I can take in a fight.
---
Nice. Thanks
---
My point is, Bethesda are going to adjust the weight of heavy weapons and in a bid to stop that I suggested near arms be buffed
---
Imagine having a SPECIAL Camp, similar to Vendors but more a hospital. You have equipment to help cure people of whatever. You can sell medical supplies, let people sleep in hospital beds that grant a special bonus to your health. 
---
They could do the same with say an Armory, make SPECIAL Camps that give you benefits to run but also cost you. 
---
We only have our imaginations for now but no real way to draw people in. Just being able to make your location and name it like ‚Äúweapons‚Äù, ‚Äúhospital‚Äù, ‚Äúarmor/clothing‚Äù etc. that would be good enough, pair this with the vending machines for the stuff your selling and your gold. 
---
First things first though, fix the game y‚Äôall broke Bethesda and let‚Äôs make Fallout Great again! 
---
#makeFO76greatagain
---
Also noteworthy that my hp is always at 5-19% so that nerd rage is activated
---
200 out of 2.4k is 10% So yeah I will. That is pretty good numbers and it is going up. Please get a life and leave your toxins behind.   
---
Seriously why are you so deluded about an idea from fallout two. One of the base games where a good chunk of the you know game comes from? 
---
+ 1 charisma but only if the enemy has low perception
---
Add me. I've played with a friend since the beginning (I couldn't even make it to Flatwoods without getting killed by the mongrels until he came to escort me lol). And recently have been meeting up with people from reddit, many even much higher level than me. I find it much more fun. Though when I'm alone, I take the time to do inventory management, gather resources, loot, explore, work on my camp, etc.
---
PSN - chakra_bender 
---
Sentinel/Bolstering armor is a must because of that
---
Thanks, great info
---
Ive seen it with some regularity at the valley galleria mall ...
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Inspirational 3, cranberry juice, and well rested.
---
First go to the whtiesprings clubhouse and then move on the indivual houses.
---
With the flexible perk system, my stealth build turns into an engineer every time I'm at my CAMP.
---
Have you tried veal or lamb chops I bet you will change your mind.
---
Guy trying so hard to copy FONV it's comical, FO76 will never be NV, accept that or move on LOL!
---
yeah. I had an idea topic for that. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayemdh/suggestion\_camp\_upgrade\_homestead/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayemdh/suggestion_camp_upgrade_homestead/) would be pretty cool. 
---
Near 15 INT is almost required for a sustainable PA/HW build. Gunsmith, energy ammo weight reduction, armor pen, etc. I kinda hate how they stack so much into some stats that make no sense, but at least they didn't put even more of them under STR, I guess. 
---
Is it bad that I wanted him to kill Rick and takeover as your new dad?
---
That‚Äôs good to know. Never give up!
---
What I'd actually prefer is that Bethesda would make a statement dispelling this notion if there are *not* going to be human NPCs in that DLC. It seems like a lot of people are inferring this from the description of Wastelanders, and it'll probably cause a lot of disappointment as excitement for that potential builds and it turns out there aren't any.
---
It's a little tricky, though, if they are there and they want to keep it under wraps right now. I would argue that saying yes isn't going to spoil anything and will just help get people more excited, though.
---
 The worse thing you will get over my mic, is me humming or yelling at a Scorchbeast. My kitten is a bit loud too sometimes. ;)
---
... fallout two, not NV. NV had some but they where minimal.   
---
Please leave your hate of the second best fallout game out of this. 
---
Abbie and the overseer, for sure.
---
I really hope we get alien content and the opportunity to upgrade the alien blaster. Seems like the enemies are in the files, and they are listed in the official guidebook. Fingers crossed it‚Äôs not just cut content that got left in when the book was published
---
I have. I'm a hardcore meat eater. But killing babies is kinda cruel. 
---
Why not just purchase serums? It's the exact same end result with much less fuss.
---
If you had say 10 in your stash prior to getting the quest I think you can pull them out one at a time and turn them in.  After then they only show up as one in inventory.
---
Four minutes? That‚Äôs incredibly fast. What was the strategy behind that encounter? Enforcer Shotgunners and Bloodied Melee? It might be time to put down the heavy weapons. 
---
Pugs ARE ugly bro
---
Yep, sad that they where so minor there. They where much well more involved in fallout two though.
---
They could make it so the world progression is tied to having beat the queen. They could separate players into different servers or make the next step a new area like far harbor that is locked until you beat her. I really hope this happens eventually and we can see what happens after we beat the scorched plague 
---
Have them all, can sell for 250c each. Will be on after 5pm EST. 
---
I thought for sure she was Amethyst from Steven Universe. Looked into it and it wasn't but they sound very very similar.
---
Seriously, I knew about it, but always had so much trouble finding where it was. I ended up constantly looking it up online to find it.
---
Than\*
---
Dry vs Wet?
---
Doesn't matter same with armor 
---
That‚Äôs excellent! Looking forward to it!
---
Thank you. I apologize for my ignorance of the proper use.
---
Also use Backwoodsman #3 to lower the crafting materials cost by 1 each and Guns and Bullets #5 to get more from scrapping them. Use the magazines only when you have a boatload of materials and can get the most from them.
---
I only ever have success with the MIRV if I use VATS. Free aiming it is such a crap shoot it‚Äôs not worth it
---
That strikes me as odd. I don't understand why someone would use weapons outside of their characters perk powers unless they're melee or shotgun shooting at sbq while its airborn. I kinda get the instigating dc gauntlet... but if thats the route you're going an instigating super sledge would probably be better if you don't have the perks and mutations. Fist weapons really only overtake 2 handers in single swing damage once you get all the multipliers lined up.
---
All that being said, TSE simply isn't worth it anymore. Yes they're still some of the most highly damaging guns in the game, but frankly it's not worth the hassle they create to deal like 20-30% more damage than other good weapons that don't have the same drawbacks.
---
You gotta scrap a bunch of em. Buy the plan from vendor and make a bunch of lowest lvl with perk cards on like super duper and scrap em all over and over.
---
If they were able to confirm it they would have. We will learn more later, a little patience goes a long way.
---
Chickens are 14 weeks old when we slaughter them for meat. Veal cows are 18-20 weeks old so technically not as bad as eating chicken.
---
This exactly. One of the reasons why melee is so op is because Adrenaline Reaction, Talons and Twisted Muscles just scales ridiculously with unarmed weapons. 
---
 I don't like Bloodied much. My crazy play would not work like that. 
---
 I like my X0-1 with my collection of daggers. Stabbed a Mirelurk Queen to death yesterday. There was damage taken but she died. ;)
---
Same here with the union.
---
I rarely see this kind of health bounce-back. Last time, I was at the steakhouse and the muties were fighting glowing ants. I finished off the muties and one remaining ant kept bouncing back several times. I even swapped weapons (gatling gun, handmade, explosive shotgun) and finally bashed the thing to death.
---
I think the server spawns different mobs than the client, hence the robot-like exploding muties or ghouls. Then, as the two enemies have different DR, your damage amount for the client becomes invalid for the server enemy, thus it is reversed.
---
Doesn't matter because the only mod for the LMG is prime receiver.
---
Happy cake day
---
Veal's not even that good. 
---
Furious?
---
No need for them other than to stop that damn beeping noise 
---
There's not different sights or relievers etc?
---
If you eat chicken some are harvested at 7 weeks old that is hardcore. I agree killing baby animals is cruel but tasty also that's why I can't stand PETA they would rather kill then find homes.
---
Itavactually level 30
---
All I can think now is the Guns 'n Roses song.
---
I have a marsupial for 250c
---
I love Rose, but she's totally wasted after the quests are all done. Honestly I wish there was something to do up there at the top of the World once the quests are over.  No reason to go up there at all other than gather grenades (not talking about the mezzanine, plenty of scrap there)
---
Good for you :) I dont even carry power armor chassis with me
---
Missed opportunity for a Mr Freeze outfit.  You could yell Ice To Meet You and Chill Out, Stay Cool, What Killed the Dinosaurs... THE ICE AGE!
---
Sounds good with my inexperience with mutations I‚Äôm betting I need backups lol
---
There are tokens in the laundry area of White Springs. Not sure what they are for exactly. 
---
I could not find anything linking the syptomatic from 76 to the auto doc in the other games.
---
IT uses the same model more or less as the mark IX from NV, and seems to have many of the same features in what it should be able to do. 
---
Hey I‚Äôll join your task force, my gt is the same as my username. What time zone are you in? 
---
I‚Äôll be on around 5 and also if you are lvl 35+ get starched genes and you‚Äôll have nothing to worry abt
---
Level 105 and would definitely help GT BLUBLZRedeux. I'll be on tonight  
---
everyone asked for this at launch, this would make it a better game
---
Why am I reading that and hearing Arnold's voice in my head?
---
Eastern Standard Time
---
You can get the cultist mask in the Lucky Hole Mine. Then combo a gas mask with it and hope it glitches like that.
---
Ballistic guns mostly require a complete gun build, vats, and crits. Don't forget bloody mess. An auto pipe rifle can take down SBs with this build but it wasn't like that in FO4.
---
Max rifleman in FO4 and a combat rifle was all you required.
---
Great I have that and maxed levels so I should be good 
---
I usually find the offending camp and see who's it is and block them unless I see it's a pop up camp with barely anything built because then chances are they will move it and I don't need to tell the game to avoid loading me on a server with that person.
---
Same as me!
---
Hope it glitches lol
---
this wasn't a glitch. He was switching masks... had another one besides this one I hadn't seen as well
---
Gamma guns can help counter them if they‚Äôre running a bloodied build. 
---
Also anything that can stagger will break the sentinel effect for a moment. 
---
Cryo grenades can be decent. If cryolator works the same way draining AP, that might be decent. 
---
I don‚Äôt bother with PvP much but i know gamma guns are quite popular atm to counter these types of players. 
---
I love hunting the legendary Deathclaw at The Whitespring when it decides to flee. It's super-fast and very challenging to catch and kill. More enemies should be like that. It actually feels like hunting. At the rate players can kill enemies, it is strange that more of them don't actually decide to flee when they see us coming.
---
I enjoyed your story though. Too bad it's a true story...
---
Count me in. Gt same as name. Time zone is hst
---
I forgot to add, but we think we found away to fight her outside the nuke so the radiation doesn‚Äôt affect us
---
Percent damaged maybe?
---
Exactly. 
---
In regards to Unused Ammo, being able to scrap this ammo at a Tinker's Workbench to produce the components that make up the ammo type would be really helpful! Maybe you only get half the components it takes to makes the ammo (scrapping 24 10mm rounds would yield half of what it takes to create 24 10mm rounds).
---
How's the damage without Adrenaline?  Do you use bloodied weapons?
---
Yeah I suffer a lot as a result of this..
---
Actually from both and has been replaced with a superior mutation system, go play old games if you want old antiquated system.
---
 I fight Scorchbeasts in my BoS Heavy Combat all the time. Its better for that, but leaping into a pack of max level Muties and stabbing them all to death kinda requires the extra protection my X0-1 has. I'm not sure there's a faster way to destroy 8 -10 of em'. ;)
---
I'm looking to become a field engineer, not a ammo dispenser or blacksmith.
---
I was sure Rose was voiced by Taryn Manning-- I was wrong, but if you've seen Orange is the New Black, her character in that is sooo similar to Rose. [Pennsatucky](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0543383/?ref_=tt_cl_t9)
---
If it was ash heap toxic air it would give you a disease I think. I never noticed any health depletion. Probably you were being attacked by an invisible enemy or there was a mirelurk out at the pond outside slinging sonic attacks or acid at you through the window.
---
Yes ! Agree .. and I think there should be a PVP mode and I like the idea that if I wanna opt in for it at any time, I can. I don't wanna have to change servers either.  So pacifist mode should mean I can not be harmed and neither should my Base.  If I toggle Pacifist mode Off I can be killed and have a 10 min cool down before I can toggle it off again - Same goes if I claim a workshop, but the cool down does not pop until I leave the work shop area then I have 10 mins before I can toggle pacifist back on. 
---
The PVP aspect is fine and I like the idea of living on the edge some days by toggling PVP on and running around with the possibility of being killed by another player.  As with all games let's just have some balance.  Problem with it is if you are "Playing a raider" Find you killed me and you got my Junk/MATS that's what raiders do. But killing me over and over again hahah WHY ? you already killed me .. My junk is gone, and Following me to my base is just ridiculous. You don't get anything from destroying my base?
---
This crap is what grinds my gears  
---
They offer to trade with you , but I have nothing of value to trade for and if I don't trade they get mad and slap damage me to oblivion.
---
They come to my base they wanna trade with me , I don't .. they get butt hurt and start shooting my base and then slap dmg me to oblivion.
---
I spawn into white springs , I want to kill the set of scorched that have spawned for me, for showing up there. I am slap damaged into oblivion for having the gall to show up to "THEIR" farming area ..
---
I am at a vendor, trying to toggle through my Inventory to sell .. Yup you guess it .. slap dmg into oblivion hahahah
---
My base is where their base is/should be when they spawn in , So they are mad that I am there, and rather then them server hop , they get the ole gang together and come on down and force me to server hop because they blow up my base and yup .. you guessed it again .. Slap dmg me to oblivion
---
Sweet Idea, just brilliant to say the least, would make the game more dynamic, this is just the beginning of endless possibilities. 
---
very cool man 
---
I've seen it in between the Overseer's camp and Flatwoods and also near the small camp on the road near Sutton.
---
Lady Janet‚Äôs Soft Serve, once you you load in from the fast travel head towards the road to the south and to the right of an over turned Jeep there is a chance the crashed cargo bot will be there.  I think you can see the red smoke itself once you load in so you will know if it‚Äôs there.  Also a chance to have a crashed vertibird, unexploded nuclear bomb, and a few other things.  If you go west down the road past the soft serve trailer there is a chance the roaming vendor bot will be there past the overturned bus.  
---
Added you, hmu when you get on tonight. 
---
Always in a team.  As it currently stands, I have a 3\* Rad Sponge with 9 points in Charisma to share it.  I've already informed the team that someone else would have to have Rad Sponge as I'm moving away from it.  There's roughly 11 of us that game up regularly.  Never alone lol.  I also use Strange in Numbers and will be adding Class Freak into my current build since I run with 13 mutations (herd mentality, twisted muscles, talons, marsupial, bird bones, speed demon, carnivore, scaly skin, adrenal reaction, grounded, electrically charged, unstable isotope and healing factor)
---
I use bloodied primed Gauss for those beasts! Just standing still in full sentinel armor and they do 0 damage.
---
I think you should jump in the game has gotten less buggy, severs have gotten more stable and there is free dlc drops lasting from March 12 to May 23
---
Bought a TSE pump shotgun from the White Springs train station for 200 caps. Never picked one up as loot though
---
Awesome thank you so much!
---
If your C.A.M.P. kills/gets a hit on an enemy you can loot it. I have a few small turrets around my base and I can always walk around it and gather loot off of dead creatures that tried to attack it while I was gone. This does not seem to apply to workshop turrets. 
---
I pop them in lunch pails or suitcases and pick them back up and it works every time. The only thing is I have to check my pipboy and activate the forbidden knowledge quest under the data tab. It does not pop up on my screen, but it is an active quest in the pipboy. 
---
It felt... GOOOOOOD!!  
---
Though note to self: Don't try and scrap your junk at Chemistry Stations in FO4.. ::doh::
---
Genius. I just hop up and down while frantically pressing x.... your method is better!
---
Seems like a good move.  I cant imagine goimg without class freak and strange, even if it meant i had to go hazmat for nuke zones.  
---
Here is a hint:  check the suitcases at the train stations. People stash their unwanted items there for other players. I do it at Whitespring when the vendors are out of caps  
---
I don't even care about the Scorchbeast Queen. I want to be able to run into a group of supermutants who are 15 levels below me and not feel as if I'm wasting my time unless I go after them with my Anti-Armour Fire Axe. 
---
It‚Äôs supposed be repeatable every 24 hours
---
I gots treasure maps for you to look through. 20 caps is what I‚Äôve sold them for in the past if that sounds ok to you. Won‚Äôt be on for a few more hours. Gt is the same as my username, if you‚Äôre interested just shoot me a message. 
---
This isn't uncommon. I routinely order clearance bundles from gamestop's website for big discounts. I think the cheapest one I ever got was a Xbox One 1TB The Division bundle for $175 USD.
---
They need to allow us to still damage camps. After all, camps can still damage you. 
---
None. We've only got our in game experiences to base on, which isn't very reliable. But I've had 0 crashes since last update, when. I typically had 3 or 4 per session. However, I've only seen 1 nuke since the bannings, and when I server hop 90% of the time I back on the same server. So take that for what you will. I'd love real numbers. 
---
Sweeeeeet!! 
---
Really? Not the craft bag?
---
My main weapon is a Vampiric Combat Knife.    Takes a bit longer to kill things, but stimpack usage is pretty low.  
---
Yes, it's a USB headset and mic. I'm really just trying to figure out whether this is an issue the game has or whether it has something to do with my hardware. I can buy a different headset, but if it's a game issue I can't fix that.
---
They were minimal in NV because they knew it was dumb and close to being phased out, they have since been removed and replaced with a far superior mutation system.
---
wastelanders was not just human npc's but the name for all non hostile npc like ghouls / super mutants / some robots even 
---
also it could be a new alternative game start / starting faction that instead of exiting the vault players can start off as a wastelander since nuclear winter mode is coming out it might be a pre story set before the vault opened during the days just after the nuclear strikes 
---
I understand it's not uncommon. What is uncommon is it happening months after release. The bundles usually at least hold their value as you are still receiving more product. 
---
And these prices are base. No sales or clearance as of yet. Last sale I saw around boxing day were 1tb for 475CDN. 
---
I'm aware. What if... Instead of a normal server and a survival PVP server.. You have a PVE server wherein PVP is disabled entirely.... And the PVP server, with an optional survival PVP mode selected upon joining, that you cant change until you join a new server.
---
It would keep PVP players only in with other people who want to PVP, and everyone else off on their own, with completely free to ignore PVP entirely.
---
Just curious.  I‚Äôm running  a similar bloodied build.  What do you do in nuke zones?
---
I think it should be more like in Destiny, where even shit-tier weapons can do something. What am I supposed to do with a Level 3 10mm Pistol? Perks should play a role, dont get me wrong, but not become the main aspect. Imo a build should expand on your prefered playstyle, not be one of the few rare options.
---
The real Rick Sanchez would agree with that statement.
---
Also, this makes me wish for similarly compact versions of the other crafting stations. I might not want to have all of them out at the same time, but imagine one of those cooking stations in front of a tent, and a tiny chem station in the shape of a small bucket still in the back of the tent, for example. 
---
Gamestop also offers better deals then their sister EB Games. 
---
I... do both.... This is my crafter build he was a mechanic in the vault and that is why he likes helping people
---
This is my melee build he was a psychiatrist for the entire time he was in the vault and that is why he is now hunting you down after 25 years of listening to your complaints.....
---
Idunno. Its usually like getting hit with a 1 2 combo by Mike Tyson. I havent tested it enough to find the issue, but glass cannon stealth is fine. If i can 1 shot everything why shouldnt it be able to one shot me. Seems fair
---
 How long does it take though? I like to jump the pack as its all in one place then. ;)
---
 I may try the glass cannon at some point. My Vampire Witch in ESO was a sheer joy ... till they nerfed sorcs. 
---
 Now my main purpose is hunting Scorchbeasts and as my Combat Armor takes no explosive damage, they have to land or strafe me with the poison rads to do any damage.
---
Fireproof perk and dense torso mod both prevent explosive damage and are easy to acquire.
---
So voice chat still works...well that would be fine if my ears weren't covered by the headset blocking the sound coming from my speakers...ugh.
---
Excavator offers more carry weight but should normally be 365.  There is a bug that sometimes lets you carry 400+ with a new playing session for some time.
---
You do get an implant from Dr. Zimmer if you choose to help him in The Replicated Man quest in Fallout 3.
---
lame, if the parade gives anything that's in game gun, armor, or rare edible I'll be miffed.
---
Her quests were fun, but that voice  ::shudders::  it's like fingernails on a chalkboard to me, especially when she would broadcast that bit about, "if you ever get in your head to screw me over".
---
If u had armor on that gives +carry weight, that explains the 20 lower with the T51.
---
A full set of excavator gives +100. Calibrated shocks makes it +200 with both.
---
There's a bug aswell that if u log in while wearing excavator, then u get the initial bonus twice until u step out
---
Yeah if the hype train leaves the station on "NPC's being added to Fallout 76" and then it turns out to be player misunderstanding, that's not good.
---
Thx sir
---
It might also explain why sometimes Legendaries explode after death despite not being robots. Killed me a couple of times...
---
I never tried, so hadnt seen it do that
---
Would be amazing... Gunslinger 3 here i come
---
If there is a bug that requires the re-application of a serum such as what happened with adrenal reaction a free anti-serum and serum to re-apply that can be obtained from the atom shop for a limited time and for 1 single use would be nice but mutation serums and their recipes to make and trade are available in the Enclave. bunker because logging in and out repeatedly to force environmental mutation was not designed to be the way to do it, serums sell for 100 - 300 caps as far as I understand so just buy and take the ones you want and that way you won‚Äôt end up with Empath
---
We need another " gun runners" add on
---
 I have a bunch. The best is my Nocturnal 40% Speed one and with 200% Repair that sucker sits at 180 at night. I can just melt Ghoul Hordes at The Whitespring. ;)
---
Always give away the ammo that I use to teammates who use it.  It always surprises them how much I have but if you don't use it it quickly builds up üòÇ
---
A sidenote is that once you are level 50 unless you're farming black titanium and nuclear material Uranium Fever is pretty worthless, as the legendary drops are capped at level 40
---
Excavator power armor will give you a hundred extra carry weight. With calibrated shocks you'll get an extra 50 lbs per leg carry weight regardless of power armor type. The 455 you're seeing is a glitch if you exit your power armor you will lose it.
---
I don't find empty servers, most usually have over 20 people on them. The last couple of days I have been server hopping for mutations, which have a 30 minute per server timer, and I never once ended up back on the same server within a 30 minute window and would usually only spend 5 minutes on a server. This is on PC.
---
I never tried, so hadn‚Äôt seen it do that...
---
Could be, reminds me of FO4 when sometimes Muties called Radroach would spawn. A cell overload or something. Another reason why this engine needs some kind of sanity check coded in.
---
I laughed, have a upvote!
---
Isn't the point of pubg to kill other players?
---
I wish the underarmor could be equipped while wearing the hazmat suit 
---
... I completely forgot about that... yeah ok Implants are actually in every game but 76 and one... and even in one they are mentioned a few times. 
---
What are u trying to scrap
---
Some good info in this thread.
---
It would be cool. But let's be honest, if the Atom shop is a indicator they will allow you to dye costumes...for a price.
---
Yeah I completely forgot about that. That means implants are in every game but one and even then they are mentioned a few times.
---
I do... very little crafting in ESO. 
---
My main character "The Fat Friar" cooks and brews. But that's pretty much it.
---
Anything to make the game more dynamic. 
---
I‚Äôll add you 
---
I‚Äôll add you
---
What would be the best way to share feedback/ideas, would that be through bethesda's site with the feed back option that shows up when you could submit a bug, or would here on reddit be better as it's hard to really tell if things are checked unless yall post which makes it feel like alot of good suggestions or feedback on things are just going completely unnoticed with the spammy kinds of things cause people don't use the 'search' option half the time
---
Untrue, because I unlocked a mod for a compensator from scrapping. Not that it matters because the LMG is garbage.
---
It‚Äôs lighting based on environment.
---
Sometimes, It looks like a polished Honda sometimes it looks dull and dark, based on the weather. Rain vs sunny vs overcast. Make sure your vid card drivers are updated. I‚Äôm running asus astrix.
---
Confused AF!
---
Are you saying that your instigating shotgun does half as much damage when your not in stealth? You would be right in that assumption.
---
How well do you understand range and spread on a shotgun?
---
What is the RANGE on your shotgun? Damage falls off very quickly with a shotgun.
---
No, though some glowing corpses will leave behind glowing meat/blood regardless of if you tagged it. 
---
Wonder if bethesda has any opinions on this idea.
---
I‚Äôll try to join.
---
I didn't even think about this implant nonsense originally coming before the legendary weapon and armor system, this game would be an even more unbalanced mess with such a terrible thing introduced.
---
Mutation, Legendary Effects, Implants.....yeah what could go wrong!
---
+12 with alcohol and black widow trait unlocks. 
---
My Gamma gun says hello &gt;:) 
---
Underarmor should always be equipped, its underwear... not sure why it's not treated that way
---
This would be a good idea.  it works the way it does right now is cool because we all have our camps in different spots in order to fast travel easier and cheaper but there have been plenty of times we wanted to merge them for whatever.  Have a "Clan" system that would allow that....awesomeness.
---
I really like the mutation system and found it to be a great addition to FO76 but moving forward I would like to see some balancing/requirements put in place. The pros and cons for each mutation is great but to add on top of that a system where you needed say a 5+ in a certain special stat, we would see more unique character builds around the wasteland. It may bring some much needed love to the less picked specials, I'm looking at you Endurance!
---
Maybe survival mode will only be played with survival only characters on a separate server or zone from the normal game. 
---
Time to clear my stash of nukes I carefully collected for lategame.
---
I think the main issue is with the game itself that loading larger amounts of camps or something at a time would cause a server crash similar to having people exploring their inventories.
---
 Survival mode. No VATS. No Legendaries. No Fast Travel.
---
 I would love that. Just skill and a normal build would be fine, and I'm very old. ;)
---
Thanks....I'll  add when I get off work also
---
If they can do it easily they should fast track this into the newest patch.
---
The BOS quest would go against the lore. The nukes are the reason the scorched are gone. If we stop that we all die and the scorched take over
---
So is the general recommendation to go with Bolstering armor?  I understand that when in a hazmat suit you no longer get the armor perks but depending on which is the recommended armor to go with for outside of hazmat will affect which route I go with in regards to my build.  
---
The only problem I see with that; is the fact it steps on the toes of mods that already exist. It would be better to stick with around the normal legendary armor effects we have, or to add a handful of PA exclusive legendaries. Just make sure their effects aren't too strong.
---
A good idea would be to make PA legendaries effect heavy weapons. This goes in line with the way heavy weapons are tied to PA via cards. This also stays in line with the Tesla armors from previous fallouts. 
---
not even sure I care about the overseer but I fell in love with Abbie and have an immense sympathy for her and her story. &lt;3 she was literally born into this all and just ...gah. my free states girl &lt;3
---
The brotherhood was on board with using the nukes against the scorched though. Idk, I think the scorched plague is just the first season, and so this event could work out once the plague has been dealt with and there‚Äôs no longer a pressing reason to use the nukes.
---
oh my god, I'm not the only one with a cop character
---
Either one works, we have a lot of eyes on here, the forums, and our site options. I try to respond to as much as I can, but we do read it all. 
---
Honestly this game needs 5-10 more points. Would be perfeft.
---
This is definitely a fun suggestion! Thanks for being so thorough with this :)
---
If we do get NPCs and factions in Wastelanders, maybe that girl in the picture is a NPC Companion? Companions would be insane, turning your party of 4 into 8. 
---
How badly does that affect gun accuracy? I am a rifleman/melee hybrid and I'm hesitant to get that mutation. Should the longshot perk negate the negative effect?
---
You are going to have to try it yourself. 
---
I feel ya. A lot of people want everyone to start new characters when survival drops. I've been running around with a raider gang for the last three months and it's the most fun. I always give people the opportunity to join us but if they're lenient or nice I kick them and we turned on them. I've straight up racked 500+ bounties just to see who would come claim it and have my pals mow them down. Or die. It was nail bitingly intense knowing at any moment someone could come take all my caps. I'm hoping since survival is a beta they'll listen to our initial cries for what we want from it.
---
This idea. I would LOVE to see this happen.
---
Exactly what I was thinking!
---
Maxson was totally against using the nukes though, you can hear his position on it in the holotape ‚ÄúThe Nuclear Option‚Äù
---
Can confirm what the above poster says.  I actually took the time to track this earlier this week.
---
1 Data = 25 caps and 350 xp
---
Anything greater than that up to 5 (I only was able to get to 5) does 40 caps and 400xp.
---
It will only show one in your inventory, and if you log out after collecting a bunch it resets that internal count to 1 because the reward is 25 caps and 350xp.
---
What you will get is a server in which all the PvP players will treat each other they treat PvE players... and it sounds like that idea doesn't excite you.
---
That's kind of telling.
---
So yeah, camp in meta locations, and go hunting the other 15 players in the world.  Adventure in the world all you want, as you do now, just knowing that you're a free target for snipers and hunters with no need to "fire back" to start fighting. That's.... kind of the point, isn't it?
---
Seems to me that they are fairly equal but with higher level enemies the 50% armor one is superior. Plus the vats can be a deal breaker. Personally I would choose the 50% armor piercing one.
---
Media in general. YT'ers like to think they're different but they're not. It's not "fake news", but it's sensationalism for the sake of business and lack of authentic feelings. I hate when people pretend to be genuine but have ulterior motives. YT'ers just want money. See how many of them complain about ad sense and ad revenue being pulled. If they aren't feeling like they aren't being compensated in a fair manner, get a different job! That's how it works in the "real world" or any job. Complaining about something an individual can control is the worst. And then complaining about working just makes everyone else miserable, too.
---
The "buff" energy weapons are getting just makes me sad, I hope they will revisit balancing them again once people quickly realize they still suck.
---
the dmg without adrenal is "ok" but you should realy take !!!muscle if u have starched genes on max lvl!!!/claws/adrenal mutation soon as possible (+ class freak!!!) even with claws or muscle the damage is realy OK. and no my fist char hasnt a bloody weapon but deals more then enough dmg without but WITH one... OP \^\^
---
go with the 50% vat crit 
---
No. This is a frequent pve player suggestion.
---
 I want the gear i worked for. 
---
The game is fairly balanced for end game pvpers. Its like pokemon theres a build to defeat any build. Just get a proper gang together.
---
Not really, that can be considered the ‚Äúcannon‚Äù ending because someone somewhere will succeed at launching a nuke no matter what. Queen still gets killed lore wise.
---
 I would keep the Instigating one. I have one and its very nice as you can one shot so many things. 
---
They updated the game so all the vendors of specific factions have the same plans. 
---
Never seen one. Months ago I looked for a positive review. None found. It's a great game and don't read reviews.
---
Hazmat suit and keep my distance or powerarmor but i prefer the first one :)
---
Death is imminent xD
---
I have had a strange issue with this quest, every time I hop servers the game automatically puts a td in my inventory whether I had one or not. Anyone else have that happen?
---
OK.  Sounds good.  I have all the mutations and will be adding class freak and strange in numbers.  Would you swap out Lone Wanderer for maxed Bodyguards or to level 3 Bodyguards with Strange in Numbers?  I don't solo at all.  Always in a group.  
---
It is 1-2 shots per beast
---
We talking Feral?  If so, shoot it in the face a lot.  If intelligent, not sure, do they grow and age?  Ghouls seem 'frozen' at their age they become Ghouled.  Maybe shoot it in the face a lot too.
---
That does not sound like a bad problem to have
---
Too funny :D
---
This is a way better solution imo. Limiting the event to one day is pretty much a big FU to anyone that can't play every single day and permanently changing the environment pretty much gets rid of the first part of the story for anyone picking up the game later.
---
Also Radshield + rad-x diluted
---
Boobies
---
Not sure if sarcasm or serious *FrySquinting.jpg*
---
I know, god forbid 
---
 I play solo. I cut my teeth on Doom. I played way too much Quake and Q3 multiplayer and deathmatch was my entire game at one time.
---
 This is a good enough shooter for pure skill builds and I would like that. I could switch out all my Legendaries and I could still dominate PvE easily. PvP should be skill based.
---
Ok cool just add me when you can!
---
This is missing the Scout DLC. I didn't notice this before but there's a decal of their logo text at the cabins near Grafton Dam.
---
solo lone wanderer, on groups i like: squad maneuvers/strange in numbers (i read something about some bugs at the moment with that perk :/) and team medic but thats up to you what u like more!
---
The beauty of the internet. Serious sir. I always appreciate getting reminded of proper grammar use.
---
This is a fair point, unless you are buying multiple serums. At which point it would be cheaper to inoculate against what you don't want.
---
Thank you for your input.  Appreciate it. 
---
I believe they called it hammerdown protocol in Cloverfield.
---
Hey there, yes an EU code will work in the UK.
---
These are found in the MISC section. They no longer stack.
---
 Yeah I have nothing to buff me and it takes a while. Well once they land the daggers come out and they die real quick. ;)
---
I was playing F04 this morning and Piper came running up to me from across the Red Rocket workshop area. Scared the bejesus out of me lol
---
Your welcome :) always happy to show some one another opinion to help others to make their decision
---
RIGHT? I can't even remember, can we scrap junk at all in f04? OMG even with 3000 hours in that game, Fallout 76 has taken over
---
Thanks, I'm on PC too. The game is so flawed but so fun. I heard there's some kind of winter content too? Did they add some locations to the map? I've only got like 50-60 hours and it seems like I've been everywhere, was really bummed out by the huge areas of nothing.
---
speaking of jumping, I love the marsupial mutation so much I had to mod my jump height in f04. Now Nate has Marsupial! w00t
---
Now you mention it - no.. it just stores it  ::sigh::
---
Aaah..so server hopping doesn't change their inventory anymore? 
---
Should I be looking out in the wild for them now?
---
I simultaneously like and hate this idea. It needs to be done once the game is more stabilized, but I'd rather it wasn't on a weekend as that's when my wife and i play the most. I can just imagine the lags and crashes during public weekends. 
---
There's no reason you couldn't have both systems. Implants though should be gated to high level characters by putting them in the bottom of a vault that has a high tech medical suite. Mechanically it could be a high cost resource intensive thing for late game characters to sink time/resources in.
---
That sounds promising.  
---
As I've said, I'm out of the loop for maybe 2 months now.  
---
1. What bans?  
---
2. Crashes solved - amazing!  
---
3. Did they fix bugs with carry weight? I also had clothing disappear and armor pieces disappear when stepping in and out of armor.
---
I got a crap ton of treasure maps if you want to buy some. Any specific ones you like? 
---
Well, maybe a little fast travel. I don't know the number of times I've been trapped by some innocuous bit of terrain.
---
But Maxson has no control over the Eastern Brotherhood, which functionally no longer even exists. The Eastern BOS was ready to use the nukes, though they died before being able to.
---
Melee rifle vats build ?
---
Right. that's right. I had forgotten lol 
---
Level 32
---
Wow, I wish I could get an AA lever action to drop. Even if it's not better than the furious one I have now, it's at the top of my wishlist.
---
AA would be better for PvP and SB/SBQ fights, instigating for front end damage in PvE.
---
ok thank you for the tip, I will try that. Of course we shouldn't have to do this.
---
We didn't stop producing bullet throwers because very few people had bulletproof vests and guns are cheap to make. If energy weapons are a threat, leather (and other resistent materialsis) is stupidly easy to acquire and doesn't need to be crafted into a finished piece of armor to be effective. The high tech and expensive to produce weapons are now a huge waste of money.
---
The kind of discussion we're having is irrelevant though. Bethesda did not consider any of that. They made energy weapons useless "for reasons". The rumor is they did it in the name of balance, but there is no evidence that this game has any balance. The fact of the situation is that people want to run around in a game shooting shit with brightly colored beams that make cool zap-zap noises and Bethesda has  managed to suck the fun out of it.
---
If you haven't pick it up by now, then you still won't like it.
---
Cool, like others though, I can't afford the acid to make steel when it is so plentiful off of monsters through the scrapper perk. I did explore that area more but couldn't find more lead out in the open. 
---
There are 3 more lead veins at the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort that I forgot to mention which is kind of a nice consolation prize if someone has already taken the can traps. They are between the train station and the Top of the World on a rock outcropping.
---
Did they patch the bug attached to adrenal? I got rid of my adrenal mutation because it was affecting my damage resistance.
---
"Wastelanders" could mean more than just people from the outside. It could mean people from the Capital Wasteland. CW is not that far and people fleeing from the Scorched from Appalachia could flee to CW. And the folks surviving there would then hear about the green areas of Appalachia and could decide that it's worth the risk.
---
My wish is that whereever the NPCs come from they will resurrect the dead factions of the Appalachia. Most of the factions have some sort of automatic membership system and training system. Why have the NPCs form a brand new faction when they could pick up the mantle of Responders, Brotherhood or Free States? I really love the factions of Fo76. Despite being dead, they are really flavorfull and distinct. I don't want them to be wasted.
---
Also Wastelanders announcement hints at new main story. What if the new main story mirrors the old one but iin addition to exploring the history of the factions we could also help them out in the present.
---
Well judging by the comments here this is might be unpopular but I absolutely hated Rose. Nice art though.
---
Only outfit I‚Äôm buying is saddlebags to turn it into a pack mule- I mean pack ghoul.
---
Guessing you are talking to the guy I blocked. He has been told that several times on the offical forms and here. and seems to be stuck in an EA mindset thinking mechanics can't overlap for different player types.   
---
but yeah these are not meant to be cheap, they are meant to be expensive to buy and really freaking expensive to craft. 
---
I would love to see this soon as well.
---
Oh yeah man didn‚Äôt think of that. Maybe bring in the more intelligent super mutants or a ghoul city or both 
---
Obtain and switch to the perk ammo smith 2 when you craft ammo.
---
TBH - The turret farm players probably have no idea that pacifist mode is even a thing.
---
Nice write up and fair points. As a pve player, no one ever killed me at my camp but they sure did try, I never engaged, my camp got trashed about 3 times, but only enough as I was writing down yours and your friends names to ban and report you, then logged off, totally worth it for me. No one ever shook me down even if I did have a mic, did that even work on seasoned players, I can see it working on new naive players or people who like joking around. I remember some guy saying a group showed up saying they were BoS and they were here to collect their share in the profits, the guy liked the sense of humour and dropped a bunch of stimpacks as it was done in good spirit. Depends how it is done, but most were there to destroy and move on ..
---
Party Boy/girl is underrated for melee. For three points you can get a consistent +3 strength (+6 if you keep a good stock of whiskey around). The multiplier also applies to thirst, so you get the added benefit of +45 water for every beer you drink. 
---
Rejuvenated gives a cheap source of HP and AP regeneration with the added bonus of being a stand-out perk in endurance (which is a pretty weak category).
---
 If you are stealth sniper you should keep the intigating, base damage + 100% base damage on first shot + 2.50x dmg sneak bonus should make you one hit almost all lv68 charreds, super mutants, 2 to 3 shots on glowing ones, this from a distant range, but you need to have a second weap for close range attacks.
---
We should be able to have brahmin.
---
No one here knows (unless a Bethesda CM is lurking, then 'maybe').
---
They stated that the bans will be lifted once they're satisfied they have the duping bug fixed.  Since *no one here has any idea how to actually do that*, it would be pointless to speculate.  It may be a hard thing to lock down, it may be fairly easy, no way to know.
---
I'd guess another patch cycle or two, but it certainly could be longer.  But again, that's just speculation.
---
While I don't go to great efforts to keep up with the official news, I have never heard this even mentioned before.  I have serious doubts that this is really a thing.
---
I'd *love* it, but I don't believe it.
---
I love when this happens. I just find it hilarious and its fun to chase them down. Especially super mutants.
---
how about: Shotguns shouldnt have suppressors? to quote shoddycast: THEY MAKE NO F\*CKING SENSE... you CANT suppress a shotgun that way the game shows us, even with a real shotgun suppressor that thing is loud! and even with a subsonic ammo, the damage has to DROP because, less gunpowder, less energy!!! and yes sry i love realism and didnt realy like how games do it for "game balance" \*facepalm\*
---
Bloodied shotgun and rifle. I only use vats to scan my surroundings for enemies
---
BoS paint makes it look quite shiny in artificial light.
---
Some stuff are not sold. They will be in the wild or rewards from workshop defending quests
---
10 acid for 9 fuel with occasional super duper proc is still worst mats/ammo ratio ever considering the fire rate
---
Carry wight exploits were fixed ages ago.
---
Just don't pick up items you won't be able to use for 10 levels, it'll just take up space you need for other things.  *Unless* you really know what you're looking at and the item is amazing, there's a good chance you'll find better on your own by the time you're ready to use it.
---
Source:  I carried/stashed a number of items that took up valuable space, only to end up breaking them down or vendering them once I was bigger and know what I was doing.
---
Just did the queen fight twice a few hours ago, same guy launched back to back. Wasn't even going to join in but i thought to myself what the heck im in the area and looking at the map theres only 4-5 high levels and the rest was under lvl 80. To my surprise it didn't take us long for the 1st round somewhere around 5-10 minutes.  With high lvl players concentrating fire on the queen while lower levels get bussy keeping us from being beat to pulp by the mobs. Same scenario on round 2 but only this time more higher level players showed up. 
---
Now that wasn't the case 2 days ago when i joined the SBQ fight with at least 10 players all over lvl 250. For this fight i used a furious AA 50 cal and AA explosive gatling laser. We all gave it what we had till the clock went all to zero. Everybody just hiked along to the train station even ignoring the mobs. Yes moral was down so we nuked WS instead to keep us from weeping in tears. 
---
A pattern i have noticed though is when high level filled fight happens we all jump in crouched in chameleon and then jump in PA then whip out the big guns. More than likely just like me these guys arent specked for big guns but are specked for bloodied melee or a stealth sniper like me.  My last 2 SBQ fights weren't planned so i came in with my PvP build and gear and just stayed crouched on top of the fence taking advantage of sneak/vats crit and adrenal reaction with a assassins AA gauss and a TSE handmade i had all the supporting perks maxed and equipped, with only 5-7 players spamming the queen i would venture to say we did pretty darn good. As tempting as it maybe to use those big guns and expand those thousands of rounds of ammo taking up stash space, i think if we fight the queen with our actual builds we should be able to take her out easy. Just my 2 cents. 
---
*snipes Chally*
---
I can see how you would be confused, apparently not having read what I said whatsoever. 
---
From the same range and the same scenario it would sometimes do nowhere near the same amount of damage. Stealth included in that. It doesnt matter because a non legendary combat shotgun with less base damage and penetrating mag one shots more consistently from stealth. 
---
Mathematically, the "buff" is very miniscule to most of the heavy weapons, especially the LMG.
---
I'm on console so that doesn't help much :/
---
Because its a Bethesda game.
---
 So putting all the BoS stuff in a bag and dropping it at The Whitespring was just wrong?  ;)
---
Go to the junk tab and look at the bottom. There should be an option to sort by components.
---
tyvm
---
Huh. 
---
I got nothing other then make sure your console is patched and updated.
---
witch hat for 2500? dude its the easy one of the witch set to find ...  
---
bos knight and soldier uniforms are also easy to get.
---
what a ripoff
---
It is level 30. And then you can level it up to 2 at level 31. Maybe you didn‚Äôt flip through all of the Luck cards? Look for it when you get to level 31. Then you can level it up when you get to level 32.
---
They could have both down the road but with mutations and legendary effects I think they have some balancing to do before adding something like this that will throw off balance even more.
---
The funny thing is the guy who posted it here got mad on a different forum because I was against calling it implants, if you call it implants and the Fallout NV boys will be right here complaining whatever is done isn't enough like NV.
---
That's why the FO76 mutation system is so great, people cant go but "FONV" was better with mutations, because it didn't have it.
---
Big shock; still borken
---
neat I will need to learn to do the drop down would be useful. But yeah sometime today I was thinking of adding all ammo types including energy and ultracite if I get bored today.
---
Keep tabbing through all of the Luck cards when you level up. It's probably located near the end.
---
Easiest way to engage PVP with another player is when you get a 5 cap bounty and maybe a teammate to back you up. The 5 cap bounty is there so if you die you only lose 5 caps (compared to 150) but your friend can revenge-kill if necessary. 
---
Assassin Sentinel/cavalier makes you pretty hard to kill yeah. Easiest way to kill them imo is either gamma guns, a reflecting melee weapon or just straight up smacking them. Melee weapons already have 75% armor penetration (mine has more i think since i have a Powerfist with puncturing).
---
I've had my fair share of pvp in this game, and fought multiple high end players and never had any issues killing them while i knew for a fact that some of them had full assassin sentinel set.
---
Oh i love the speculation on trading your "art". Opens up a whole new market.
---
I can sort them but I want to tag items for search from this menu. If I am low on screws just to select screws and turn magnifying glass on. I have a lot of items with search on and have no idea for what repair or craft where required to be able to go back and delete the tag.
---
Yeh no this is a game based on the loot you get. With builds that effecr gameplay
---
Grind for the good stuff. It aint hard
---
*D* **E** *E* **P**
---
*T* **H** *R* **O** *A* **T**
---
*I* **T**
---
~~Just kidding~~
---
You also "need" a team. It's a bit rock / paper / scissors like with gamma guns and berry mentats to show invisible players.
---
I keep telling pacifists this too - team up and you'll be safe. If you can get 20 players as friends on same server you're safe.
---
Doesn't really matter who you are you're not going to consistently win vs 4 players.
---
You're talking about the Witch Hat Plan, not an individual witch hat? Easy to find? Give me tips then, it took me a couple of hours of server hopping to get it.
---
I will lend a hand. GT W0GB0T
---
I tag from there. RI, I think. I'll have to verify when I get home tonight.
---
This actually seems closer to Project Nevada's (an overhaul mod for NV) implant system. I definitely dig it.
---
Aside from slugs... a shotgun doesn't have a huge lethal range. You start cutting down barrels, increasing spread... and it gets worse.   
---
A standard shotgun with 00 shot... about 20-25 yards. Shooting birds? Sure, that's one thing, taking down heavier game? Hell no.
---
and "suppressing a shotgun" is pants on head stupid.
---
Ups, my bad. I thought I posted in the Fallout 76 marketplace. Didn't understand why I was getting so much negativity about trading :D
---
I'd buy them all. if u are pc
---
Yes
---
Sorry for the other answers so far. It's a common NAT problem - the solution is team with friends @ main menu then enter server.
---
You have to physically have the disc in order to play. 
---
Pretty sure thats it. I just tag plastic, lead, ballistic  fiber, and nuclear material
---
This was an entertaining read. Sorry that happened to you OP. Sounds fustrating.
---
errr well 2 months ago I had this issue:  
---
i only use the industrial loader gear because it gives 100 extra carry weight.  
---
Sometimes I get into the armor and I have 200 extra carry weight. Then I will get out and get back in and: I am either at my naked carry weight or I get 100 again. Was this fixed around Xmas time or something? Also, at this same time, a power loader armor helmet disappeared (not broken, disappeared from inventory) as well as irreplaceable Mystery armor, which was once wearable under armor.  
---
Did they patch it by just deleting item under the armor and breaking pieces? Like the Veil and the armor helmet BOTH disappeared.
---
I remember when i was once a wee level 12 who thought venturing to Berkeley springs was a good idea, that was when i did my 1st PvP against a level 18 and won! I felt so tough i took the workshop, then one of these flying things screamed at me and i died had been running from them ever since. But now that im all grown i hunt them down for food and materials to fix my constantly breaking gear. But don't be foolish now, hunger and thirst can kill you when AFK along with those pesky ticks that can leap as high as you do with marsupial. :)
---
I saw that on a body of a dead mothman cultist on the road south of Whitespring (near the fissure).  It was NOT in their inventory.  I'd say his was probably from the dev room.
---
Yeah I'd bet money Wastelanders is an arc about humans returning to Appalachia.
---
Wow, Bethesda breaks something else trying to fix another problem?
---
~~That never happens.~~
---
Sounds like fun. The wasteland is harsh you should feel paranoid, very immersive good role playing!
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aayp50/dead\_group\_of\_mothman\_cultists/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aayp50/dead_group_of_mothman_cultists/)
---
Yesterday I had a power armored 100+ player follow me and a rando for at least an hour beating each of us with pipes, bats, any melee weapon they could find or had on them. They would shoot at us when we ran, and use their upper mid teir guns to blast away mobs before we could get to them. They gained very little exp, and we were smart enough not to hit them back so they did very little damage to us (so little that a diluted stim now and then fixed it up no prob) but still kept at it. Where are these friendlies you speak of? And why do they never join my servers?
---
Im fine with seperating communities. 
---
The idea of risk free PvP doeant excite me. My gangs all 3 start cav/sentinal/assn.
---
We want to be able to sustain on pvp only as we have been. This change may force us to grind for junk. I havent had to grind in months!
---
The worst thing is how slow you move
---
I just took down a baby radstag last night and felt kinda bad about it. I ate it to not waste it. 
---
Thanks
---
I doubt they'd remove content only a year into release. They can just work out some way to immunize the world from the scorched, either by mutating the scorched virus to become non-contagious or releasing an aerosolized vaccine into the atmosphere.
---
i have a feeling we are going to get some type of companions at some point
---
I'd keep both,  first shot insisting quick swap to aa. You can only keep one why? 
---
I appreciate it Pachy! 
---
 Oh I have most of what I want. I thought we were talking about PvP. That's what I want to be skill based as that plays to my strengths. No VATS especially would be nice. I never use it. ;)
---
I‚Äôll say to remove the ability to craft mini nukes but to make them be able to severely damage creatures above level 70 and anything lower to be completely one shot. Makes the fatman a viable and costly weapon to use 
---
On a positive note, this is a fantastic method to deal with people that set up turret camps behind White Springs.
---
you know what..if u have medical goggles on u can still wear glasses under that..makes no sense to me
---
Slap player style tags on them too so when you spot them from a distance it looks like it might just be some random player hanging out in their menu or something.
---
Similar situation with me but with Nick Valentine
---
i believe grafton has these for sale
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38a7L60SLJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38a7L60SLJs) THIS should every game designer should see because they fuck up shotguns in ALL games -,- (shotgun lover)
---
I used to remember it by "this then that" or because "then" has half of "next" in it. Than is more comparisons. "I'd rather have a Corvette than a Nissan."
---
&gt; make the next step a new area like far harbor that is locked until you beat her.
---
I have a feeling we'll get something along these lines eventually, but they'll probably have several story arcs in Appalachia before we move somewhere else.
---
The point is that it was in fallout 4 and this game is a lazy asset flip
---
From the Junk tab, Component View (R1) shows you what you're looking for. One caveat is that you have to have that junk item in your inventory for it to show up in Component View.
---
But to address your actual question.  If you spend most of your time doing events and general pve, the instigating hands down.   
---
But if SBQ is your cup of tea then the AA.
---
Make it so cannibals can eat wendigos too! Only time wendigos are edible is when they have the scorched disease.
---
No tricks that I'm aware of. I just hit it out of rage. I'm pretty stubborn so I Just stand there for as long as it takes to get the Pie.
---
Been doing BoS style death marches across R65 lately. Open mic, no fast travel, as many players as possible. Really adds immersion maybe how it was meant to be played!
---
How is "risk free"?
---
You all get to kill each other... that's the risk.
---
What it sounds like you WANT... is unwilling participants, to make it fun for you.
---
I will try. Thank you! 
---
They should do an ARG towards the end of Nuclear Winter. 
---
Get the current fans involved and having fun with a mystery, and create media buzz to bring back people discouraged by the launch.

I understand they are trying to ‚Äòbalance‚Äô the weapons, so that laser guns will break before you can kill five super mutants and mini nuke doesn‚Äôt do much more damage than a hammer. It‚Äôs really the crudest and laziest approach, they simply dialed numbers up and down and the result is a complete joke. Instead they should have treated it as a system and let users decide the trade offs. Tune way down the power of bear arms and bomb express so if a user like mini nukes, let him carry 30 of them and nothing else. What if mini nukes completely disintegrates half of the enemies so your chance to get loot drops significantly if you abuse the power. There are many ways to balance the weapons than simply changing the damage numbers. 
---
Alright. Also what is a good place for the camp? I really wanted to place it at the airport but that didnt work out.
---
 I pulled em' to where I had some sky and I guess I lost the one somewhere in that operation. ;) Hi ho.
---
 Did 3 level 80s at The Whitespring a while ago. There was help at the end though.
---
You're welcome, I think Gamesharing is the only way you wouldn't need the disk on your Friends console, but I'm not sure how that works.
---
they did an excellent job with the wendigo..im a sniper build and i use the scope with the wendigo..up close its face is so scary
---
Two non-robot vendors makes me feel like we'll be getting more NPCs over time.

Good suggestion, but this was really hard to read.

You're like a fish trying to climb a tree. I didn't force this topic he came to me! Why won't anyone answer my original question? You're doing mental gymnastics to avoid it!
---
Not sure on pistol perks,  and no idea if a legendary can drop. 
---
Why?! Who played with you?! Him or Him?
---
I am! wheeldogz is my IGN

&gt; Why won't anyone answer my original question? You're doing mental gymnastics to avoid it!

Reddit adds nothing to the Developers plans. They already know. They're reasonable people have some faith.
---
Perhaps you're comparing unpainted to BOS initiate paint?

In the box under the bridge

We are addressing two Adrenal Reaction issues in our patch next week:
---
* We're fixing the issue that caused Adrenal Reaction's positive effects to not apply to players who had the mutation prior to patch 6.
---
* Adrenal Reaction's damage bonuses are going back to what they were prior to patch 6 release. 
---
There's a third issue where, if you've acquired Adrenal Reaction after Patch 6, its positive effects will disappear from the Pip-Boy when you log out/back in or switch worlds. However, even though they're not visible in the Pip-Boy, they should still be applied correctly. We're investigating this one for a fix in a future update. 
---
If it's a feral, probably spear it like I do the creepy mutant babies in The Forest. Ig it's not feral, I probably look around for it's family, because I doubt infants, ghoul or otherwise, can survive in the wilds by themselves.
---
If no family, probably going to the nearest ghoul-friendly settlement. Ghouls DO age, albeit slowly, and who knows, they might age normally until a certain point and then slow down, Kid-in-a-fridge not-withstanding. 
---
Plus, if it is a baby ghoul, it means one of two things. Some female (possibly a ghoul) managed to give birth to a healthy baby ghoul, meaning she passed on a ghoul genetic trait, hereditary radiation immunity and near-agelessness! That bears study and research, it also means if the mother was a ghoul, she was still feral despite the radiation.
---
The other option, the baby was a human baby first, and survived the horrific transformation into a ghoul. That is one tough sumbitch. I dont want to get into a fight with a baby that can survive radiation exposure and it's skin melting off, that thing is probably bullet proof and has a hide tougher than an elephant's. 
---
Base energy weapons are all semi-auto and Flamers are heavy.
---
Come to think of it, that is where i found mine. 
---
So.. medical goggles + Mr. Fuzzy hat + sunglasses, or medical goggles  + Mr. Fuzzy?
---
Either way, excellent. :)
---
Suggestion: Copy New Vegas and 2.
---
White Springs can be easy if you can get the robots involved, if you can move them to the robots and hit them once, the robots will take care of the rest...
---
But did pistol affect it? 
---
...and they like to prey on anti-social players like you. Why are you infringing on their freedom and preferred method of playing? Their fun isn't more important than your fun.
---
You can team up today and have what you desire, or you can whine to mommy Beth. If you refuse to protect yourself no one should care.
---
Not reposting is the #1 rule on reddit, what's your problem?
---
ha not sure if that would work..but whenever i take my goggles off i still have my black rim glasses on and im like wtf lol
---
if you make a copy you can edit it. The values are all pulled from a sheet you wont be able to see.
---
Any cell with a ref to validation is that sheet. under view is hidden &gt; validation
---
Did some minor editting any areas that need some work on the wording?
---
 Oh for sure. I had them mostly to myself for the first 2 then then people showed up and they got trained over to the bots.
---
How would they know you were the same person?
---
Then you just bully the bullies with your giant team because you're the good guys = you're the social guys, because you're good and everyone wants to be with the good guys.
---
You want mommy Beth to patch out any tiny inconveniences to you because at heart this is anti-social. In a 25 player game.
---
Social = good = nice = win big caps.
---
Nope this is all with the initiate paint equipped
---
Ban and report for what? Camp raids arent against the terms/conditions of the game. 
---
Theres friggin perk cards for it. Its only harrasment of we chase you to another server or say something aweful/discriminatory over the mic. 
---
I would give players an "out" like dropping junk... Most of the time.
---
 I do roll with a roleplay guild too that gives quests to players. Most of us pvp and pve roleplay. We all pvp and are geneally disappointed in the adventure changes as we were the "boss fights" in some of our quests. Letting  a player choose to attack one of us is a choice in our quests. We exploit some pvp mechanics in adventure to "pop red" mid dialog allowing a quester to choose to kill us as we act as npc's.  These changes will remove depth from our quests. 
---
Example: the king explains there ia a gang of misled youth who may have been stealing junk from the castle. Please investigate but dont hurt them. When you get to the greaser youth they are flagged hostile but talk about junk and try to get the quester to steal junk from the king and join the gang. The quester can decide to kill them, collect evidence, return to the king and tattle or trick the greaser gang. Each choice has a diff outcome for the kings reaction. 
---
With the new changes it removes options from the player doing our quests. 
---
I am going to try that.  Thanks!
---
And 3 (you can get one there) and tactics, and four (kellogg has them).... aka add a feature that is just a fallout feature to a fallout game. 
---
Could it be off I have unused perk points you think?
---
Ah thank you very much! I'll try to keep it in my mind :)
---
While NPCs would help solve a huge problem with the game, I think it's more likely that Wastelanders is going to continue the whole 'there are no human NPCs' thing and, instead, have the 'Wastelanders' be a new option for player-characters - players who come from the Wasteland rather than players who come from the Vault.
---
I'll get back to you when I have time. There are just some spots where the word choice is confusing. Overall, nothing lacks more information. 
---
I'll ping you when in on. 5 hours
---
Please do not do this. PVP really needs to be fixed, but doing this is a terrible idea. People absolutely need to be tense interacting with others in this world, this would absolutely destroy your game direction and any sense that the wasteland of fallout is dangerous.
---
Please stay true to the genre, keep the wasteland a dangerous place.
---
You would do us all a better service by making people who are not your friends invisible on the map.
---
What's the "until yesterday" thing? Was there a hotfix which broke something?!
---
Most the time my word choice is limited by what I can spell. looking through it to fix anything I can though.
---
Pretty sure stacks if multiple people shooting with same mod, if you shoot you just refresh your own 
---
I believe the actual cannibal description says you can eat scorched..
---
Of course you can do that, from another account. And I'd say, if you did, you'd play right into their hand, because they'd make some more money off of banning you. And you can always be banned again, and "have to" buy yet another copy lmao
---
Allow me to recommend this one, by an artist I follow and which I posted several months ago:

Concrete foundations stacked as walls and roofs are indestructible. You can even make it to where there is no door or window and only way in is through workshop and storing one of the blocks. I did this and told 4 of my friends they can have my 3* bloodied grognaks axe they just have to be able to get in my camp to get it from the bag i dropped, they tried and even launched a nuke on it but to no avail. They even tried the fast travel and jump in before it renders glitch but did not work because it was a floating structure at the edge of a cliff. 
---
How did we go from hypothetical baby ghouls to clubbing seals &amp; eating baby chickens?  Hahah
---
You really want to be mad at me huh? Please put your disdain for my kind aside and think critically. ..
---
You said:
---
"You all get to kill each other... that's the risk. Kill each other and take each others junk"
---
No one will carry junk. They will prep and stash it in adventure mode then switch to survival with empty pockets... No junk will be lost on death in survival. Why would anyone grind there? People will just be hunting eachother. 
---
Player prices or Enclave prices? I could never reliably find a player vendor and Enclave was always like 4k a pop.
---
Oooooo! I hadn't seen that one yet! Thank you very much! I'll definitely get that on my schedule too :D
---
I hate to be "that" guy, but you're using the Daisycutter wrong. It's okay, though; most people are.
---
The *correct* way to use the Daisycutter (DC) is to get rid of excess mini nukes. To do this, first remove the MIRV mod and replace it with a standard launcher, then just keep the DC in your inventory. Then, anytime you come across a mini nuke, pull out your DC, aim it roughly in the direction of the nearest player, and let fly. Try to get a good arc so the nuke flies nice and long, and for Atom's sake, ENABLE PACIFIST MODE BEFORE YOU DO THIS.
---
The true purpose of the Daisycutter is to dispose of useless mini nukes and confuse other players. "Where the hell did that nuke come from?!?"
---
No. 
---
Vats builds are part of the game. Vats crits bypass sentinal/cavaliers and are necessary for end game engagements.
---
Hard to get into the idea when we don't know what nuclear winter is, but i'm pretty sure 25 players is an inherent theme that will NEVER be reconsidered.
---
Why don't you create a Fo4 mod campaign? You could even strip code from 76.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. Surprised not many people are utilizing it more. That debuff is helpful. 
---
They're a hive mind supposedly, they share the thought of each others taste, the most intelligent being the scorched humans meaning they thought about their taste more than the rest allowing them to each adopt that taste and express it by you, the player, tasting them. They share a human taste and that's why you can eat them because that's what you're there for. 
---
:( Not for patch 7 but they are aware of and working on that as well.
---
If on Xbox or ps4, I would assume you need a new Xbox live/psn account with a new $$ subscription, and POSSIBLY another copy of the game. PC would most likely just need a new Bethesda account and game key. I have no solid proof of any of this, just thinking out loud
---
Entire builds are made around crit shots, which require VATS. Crit shots bypass legendary armor buffs, so they make anyone able to win with a half-decent weapon and some tact.
---
A lot of lab goggles in real life are built big so they can be worn over glasses. Otherwise a lot of scientists would need prescription lenses in their goggles
---
I love you.
---
Lol I didn't deserve the suspension. There's nothing in terms of service about multiple accounts either. They aren't abiding by their own terms of service 
---
I believe the only rare items associated with it are wearable face masks.
---
Distant Thunder event drops plans and mods. The plans are 1 in every 15-20 for me though. 
---
It surprises me that people thought they were minor, or outright missed them. They were always a big part of my builds, would always do 7 END so I can get the max implants.
---
I dont think it's a bug, why would the super mutant have specific dialog for it? It seems to be a survival mechanism to get them out of the AO and heal/get reinforcements
---
This is why I never buy digital ;-)
---
What kind of place do you want? For now, definitely in the forest. You might want to be near certain events or places you like to frequent. It can be good to be a bit farther from Vault 76 because you can use that as a free fast travel point to get to Flatwoods and such. Or you can set up in Flatwoods. 
---
I've had camp in various places. Rn I'm in the upper NW of the forest in the woods. I like my camp to be peaceful. I get some lower level enemies here and there, but it's nothing my turrets don't handle. Someone gifted me a missile turret that pretty much takes care of everything, even mole rats. Lol 
---
You could also try to do the mobile camp thing. But that costs caps, which you may not be awash in at the moment. Plus it's kinda nice to have a camp base. You will probably move it many times when you want something new. Or if you find the neighborhood isn't that good. Or you want to set up on a resource collector.
---
When are you usually online? I'm eastern standard time and am usually on evenings and into the night and weekends. Maybe we can seek out a place for you to build camp. Or whatever.
---
I will enjoy my scorched victims of any species then.
---
I bet the green sores they grow taste like rock candy.
---
Deserves more karma 
---
Sorry to hear that, what happened?
---
I'll help you out some. It's just kind of long haha. Be on the lookout for a DM by tonight.
---
What prices is this using for the mats? Bulk from game vendors?
---
Aaaaaaaand it's nerfed
---
Do you ever wonder if the scorched stop to consider how they themselves taste?
---
Yeah I thought it was Sarah Silverman too, my brother thought it was 'Pensatucky' from Orange is the New Black (Tiffany Manning).
---
Turns out we were both wrong.
---
I don't think you can get banned for attacking a player's camp. They even have a perk card for it: Wrecking Ball. 
---
Continuously following a player across servers and attacking/harassing them, sure, I could see a ban for that. But you can always server hop and make all the bad raiders go away.
---
If you‚Äôre on XB1 you can do the family sharing feature I‚Äôm pretty sure, idk how to do it tho
---
Holy shit that sounds awesome!
---
I‚Äôve tried all the stations for days, i did get it for sturdy but i cant find it for heavy.
---
Very possible its one of the many scenarios people propose on here, no truth to it
---
I kinda like it
---
I love my 3\* auto launcher...
---
Absolutely. We weeks and months for our gear. If they don‚Äôt allow us to take it with us to survival, I have no incentive to play this game mode. 
---
Think about all casual players as well. Its no problem for the ‚Äúelite‚Äù to grind a new char to lvl 50 or so. Causal players who struggled to get their char to a certain level won‚Äôt create a new one just to play survival. It would mean insta-death for this mode. From both sides, elite and casual.
---
Maybe use some adhesive and stick that mini nuke to the end of your sledge hammer. Wait on second thought it would probably Nerf the damage to sledge hammer.
---
Platform might be handy to mention also
---
This did work at one point didn‚Äôt it? I swear I remember fixing the axes to 200%
---
I'm going for the hardened receiver for the Western Revolver. I'm hoping to find a quad explosive one eventually and want to be able to trick it out.
---
I could probably drop the third account if this was implemented!
---
Possibly 
---
yeah I couldn't figure out how to edit my title, so I put it in brackets in the description!
---
Behind flatwood water purification plant, there an electric pylon, right next to it there a spot for random encounter ( I have reset this event for a full day and came across many intersting event, one in particular wich a corpse spawn, of a civil war refugee or something like that, the corpse has on of the civil war cloth or confederate cloth plan on it, also there one random encounter near poseidon power plant, this event has rare random encounter trick or treat corpse, wich has the plan for witch hat or skeleton costume
---
Because i got weight limit issue, since one lever is like 15 lbs. I'm not finish the main story yet (lv 80) so I'm still playing on quest line and sometime go for events, farming for better guns at popular places everyday and I always go for SBQ if nuke drop, one or two rounds / day. My build is hybrid sneak rifle and heavy weapons. I use my lever rifle and furious combat short gun when pve but use both heavy weapons and rifle at nuke zone, just switching for fit the situation :)  I got furious .50 heavy gun and furious gatling gun for SBQ/SB but switch to rifle for those smaller craps with vats i can help ppl well enough. My build, i spent for 3 x heavy weapon buff perk cards, 3 x rifle buff perks card, with 3 level of bloody mess and crit. savvy and 3 x covert and stabilized perk.
---
 I have never in thousands of hours of Fallout 3D games used VATS. I always thought it was cheating. ;)
---
 Come fight me where only the skill matters. I would love that although I am 72. ;)
---
We need more paint options for everything.
---
If I can find yellow and blue paint around the wasteland, why can't I paint my *Painted Metal*, or my weapons?
---
Don't say "But the Atom Store" because we have what, 2 weapon skins there?
---
Seriously, why not give us solid-color options from found loot, and continue the camouflage / chrome / gold / whatever skins in Atom Store.
---
I‚Äôve seen people on here.offering to sell the serums for the 100-300 cap mark but yes the bunker is more expensive, if buying from the bunker vendor taking grape mentats will bring the price down to around 3880. I‚Äôm grinding caps atm to buy the recipes so I can make and sell them via the player vending machines that are coming so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on the prices they go for. I originally bought mine as serums from the Enclave but I only use 5 so with a concerted effort to sell 1400 caps worth of stuff to the vendors and stopping off to grab every cap stash and graffton monster I could I soon had enough caps. I expect when the vending machines come in they will be easier to find but until then it might be worth popping on a post here on reddit to say your looking for serums and I‚Äôm sure someone will pop up to hook you up
---
Wouldn't it be cool is that light on,the ci,bat helmet actually worked?

---
My Main Character is a Stealth/Sniper Build and the Mutations &amp; Perks I use benefit my normal weapons very well, a few quick Perk changes give me a good Heavy weapons loadout for Queen battles, it's not exactly what I would do for a Heavy weapons Character, but it seems to work well.
---
At level 150, I have the Perk cards to work with several different weapons loadouts, but that does not include 2 handed Melee.
---
I usually have at least 5 available Points for SPECIAL adjustments, or Perk selections, but have no plans to re-spec my character, and literally use only 1 weapon that I would trade for anything at this time.
---
How to transfer my assasin gear to my pvp toon?
---
Simple solution to these turret farms. If you run with a mobile camp and the area is empty when you get there, just drop down your C.A.M.P device where they usually place them. Turret farmer logs in and oops, what a shame...camp can't be placed.  Too bad, so sad.  Try a different server.  If enough people do this, they would rarely be able to place their camp.
---
Are you on PC?  I talked to Sergeant Gutsy randomly one day after finishing that quest and he gave me another certificate.  I could try giving it to you and see if that updates the quest!
---
Hemlock holes for acid. 3 seeps kick out ~60 per hour. I'm sitting on over 700.

Vault Tek University has a good amount of lead. It has the gym in the vault area which has a good amount of weights. 
---
Ip address/mac address. 
---
Ha ha I litterily just said that. 
---
Great minds right? 
---
Picked up a brown bag a friend dropped a few times. Did take all and apparently that was enough to get me a suspension 
---
Watching me eat all their other scorched, I hope so.
---
Says he doesn't like risk free pvp, complains that he has to actually work for it instead of ganking people who don't want it. 
---
Please Bethesda, just give us separate pve and pvp servers so people like this can go get bent playing with each other. 
---
I cleared  wade airport but I didnt really want to claim it considering someone would probably come and claim it pretty easily. As for the camp I just wanted a place to be able to build a decent sized base. And I just get on when i can. It's usually not on a schedule.
---
Where do you get this notion that PvE is going to be storage centre for PvP players? 
---
As for your other points? That sounds like a "you" problem. You want a hardcore mode, with nothing hardcore about it.
---
I don't want to be "mad at you", but you're literally just saying "I want nothing to change, because I want to kill people who have everything to lose at no risk to myself.
---
You're not out there hunting dudes who can kill you, you're shaking down players who can't possibly go toe to toe with you. You want a world full of players with caps and junk that you can take from them... so? You'll have it. Bethesda isn't going to allow PvP players to use PvE games as a means to play risk free.
---
Fast travel? Suck it up buttercup. You want a survival mode, here it is.
---
Nope, I like 76 VATS also.  Once you have to react faster, you learn how to.   Makes FO4 VATS feel even slower now when I go back.
---
Not a bad idea at all. I had honestly forgotten about player vending.
---
So, here's the thing, it doesn't take a scientist or engineer to launch a nuke, especially a tactical nuke, it just takes a "grunt" , with the proper authorization, a few minutes to deploy and fire.  I have some experience with this as I worked on Pershing Ii systems in the mid-80s. 
---
It also does not take a ton of plutonium or uranium to build a smallish, (10-50KT) warhead... which is about the size of the ones in the game. they can be as small as a briefcase/backpack. Both us and the Soviets had both of those. 
---
That is weird.... I had a few following me lately. But I‚Äôm in a group on Xbox and it‚Äôs typically tracked back to that.
---
Photo wise if you open an Imgur account and upload your photo there you can copy it‚Äôs link and include the image in any posts, I only just learned that a few weeks ago lol
---
The point... I dunno, they thought of it but didn't actually think about it and then kept it in for 6 months until this post and all of a sudden think it's important...

Your IP changes regularly (and you can force a change in your router).

So... your friend's a duper, which you know... and you tried to get around it... and got banned?
---
That pretty much it?

I'm on xbox, but isn't the certificate a quest item anyway so you can't trade it? My friend has one, but I don't think he can drop it.

Do you have grounded and healing factor?

Thanks Australian retailers for allowing me to get a refund for this product.

Before you play up the hard bargain act, you should really start by saying which platform... 
---
No one will carry junk. I sure wont. If i need to grind for it now, ill hop to adventer to grind it more efficiently.
---
My gang and I take out high levels and high level gangs all the time. Your comments are pure fantasy. Its obvious you have a chip on your shoulder for people like me and cannot comment in good faith.
---
Im sorry your butthurt but you arent contributing or arguing in good faith. 
---
Not at all. This was my first fallout game and wasn't aware duping was a thing. I was like level 5 and trusted the person. Fyi I destroyed the items when I found out they were duped. The game doesn't care about the items source
---
I am just curious where the actual drops  came from. I have yet to get anything better then my moleman gauntlet.  Luck is not on my side.
---
ahhh ok..i believe if u keep scrapping leather chest armor the heavy mod will be unlocked..as far as shadowed heavy armor not sure if i ever seen that so u may need to buy or craft low level leather chest armor to unlock it..im a big fan of shadowed anything as well
---
My complaint is the lack of weapon customization. There's like 2 options on the Atom Store; Chrome minigun and a gold something. That's it.
---
Cmon, if we can find blue and yellow paint in the wasteland, why can't we slap it on our armor and weapons? The Atom Store can continue with the camouflage and more detailed weapon skins.
---
I think you would have needed to have selected it when you chose your special. So you would have chosen whichever special point you wanted, then you would have needed to go over to luck and tab through each of the cards until you found it. I'm level 32 rn. I just did this. At level 30, Starched Genes was my "new" card, but it was near the end of the Luck cards. You couldn't see it until you tabbed all the way through the cards. I selected that as my new card. Then when I hit level 31, after I chose my special point, I went to Luck and chose Starched Genes again to level it up. So you're going to have to wait until your next level to select it again.
---
It has to be there when you get to choose your next cars. It's just going to take you two more levels to get it to 2. Just make that your focus. You can maybe go to WS golf club and get that level up done quickly.
---
Last weekend I has hanging out with some high level guys, like 70-100+. I think I was like level 27 and on guy said you need to get to level 31. I asked what happens then. He said, then you can have 2 levels of Starched Genes.
---
thanks in advance. 
---
Lol what? 
---
A single piece of 00 buck is about the same size as a 9mm round. Effective range dropoff is at about 40 yards, but that is due to spread. You can still expect to put about 50% of the shot on target at this range.
---
 It maintains the energy to be effective out to around 100 yards assuming you put the shot on target. 
---
You are correct about the barrel length having an adverse effect on the spread, this can be somewhat compensated for with a choke or choked barrel. 
---
As for suppressing a shotgun being stupid, why? A suppressor works on a shotgun the same way it works on any other weapon. It is going to reduce the sound of the weapon itself, and if the round is supersonic then the supersonic crack from the projectile will still exist...just like with any other weapon... but then again suppressors work a lot different in real life than they do in video games/movies.
---
well they where minor in NV compared to what you could get with 2. in NV it was just something you would have to know was tehre and have the caps for it. 
---
u have the medical goggles? they were not easy to get
---
yes, I craft level 1 because it uses the least amount of materials. i have nearly every mod now BUT shadowed! hella aggravating haha
---
We dont really have a forum to cry on though. Posts about PvP seem to get downvoted. 
---
Support won't even tell me the items I am suspended for because the character they were on no longer existed when I was suspended üòÇ
---
Thank you :)
---
yeah in f04 all my armor was shadowed..i havent really unlocked that many leather armor mods i think the only chest one i have is lightweight..but i am always looking for shadowed...
---
also ..see if this helps you someone made a spreadsheet with vendors and items

long story short, while playing yesterday i noticed that the damage input of all my weapons had gone down to like 50%
---
contacted bethesda and they give me this advice: 
---
did this today and it worked...... for ten minutes.   I made pictures yesterday and the damage for my dragon for example was 186, so very low.  after doing all the stuff that bethesda had suggested it went back up to 311 (this is one example, it's the case for all my weapons).
---
i started playing an hour ago, happy happy and did this: 
---
- i fast travelled from my camp to sutton station, took a grape metants for better prices and sold aid items for 200 caps

- i fast travelled to lewisburg station, looked if the power armor was there , shot two bugs, sold for 200 caps, bought a mod for 50 caps.
---
after trading i checked weapons damage again and yes, way down again. the dragon went back from 311 to 186. i did not get sick, addicted or mutated, i did not change perk cards.
---
The weapon appearance should remain largely the same. It should shoot a green laser instead of red. However I have had an instance where my Ultracite Gatling Laser was changed from a green to red laser after putting on a muzzle mod (beam focuser). Adding the prime receiver didn't change anything.
---
Pretty sure you‚Äôll be able to fast travel to your camp and vault 76
---
How difficult is it to copy and paste a line of code? 
---
Nope... but I will find a way.
---
Oh good....planetside 2 called.  
---
I normally start on the train station side of WS and walk on the porches of each house clearing out any ghouls I see. When i get to the golf course in the back i go over to the clubhouse. If you blow up the bus in front of the clubhouse you can climb up on it . Jump at a 45 degree angel over the driver side head light and you won't need marsupial to get on top of it. Once up on the bus, chuck a few grenades in the door and the ghouls will come to you. Once that's cleared, go along the house porches back towards WS Hotel. Once back at the main WS hotel clear out all the ghouls in the side parking lot. You can jump on top of the garage by going down the side alley between the fence and the garage and jumping on the first power box on the right you come to. From the roof you can clear everything, but the 2 to 4 ghouls inside the garbage. The dump or sell everything you collected in the hotel and do the loop again as the first ghouls on the loop will have probably re-spawned at the time. 
---
You can use the bus trick on any of the white springs buses, so I use them to hide if I'm getting over run by ghouls. 
---
Dont own a workshop if you dant wanna get ganked! 
---
I want to be able to continue to profit from pvp engagements. Server locking junk items would be nice. Split the communities but dont allow players to take adventure mode junk into survival mode!
---
Force us to have to gather the junk in survival mode please!
---
This way i can keep getting my junk from player kills. 
---
Can I ask why my account was suspended due to a character that no longer exists? And why I'm still waiting for an agent on my ticket almost half a month ?
---
ok..try flatwoods and buy the low level western revolver and scrap..im not sure which enemies carry that..i was gonna suggest an area where they carry that so u can defeat all the enemies and just scrap like 10-15 guns at once
---
Save one in your stash till you find any armor with 20% weapons weight reduction then problem solved, or look to buy it in game at some player vendor.
---
Actually it is from fallout 2 yet enhanced... never played planetside.
---
&gt; What a better way for a griefer to find camps.
---
They've already said that they're tweaking pacifist mode so that players who turn it on will not take any slap damage and their camp becomes indestructible. 
---
I could see that since every time I pulled out a fatman I went from hidden to insta danger lol
---
Seems like something worth checking out, since you can detonate grenades midarc.
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
This is my i don't have a fucking clue build.
---
i got u...go to the Ranger Outpost or whatever its called north of Watoga..watch out tho..the enemies there can be PIA..theres a medical room..it will be on the shelf above the bed..u will have to server hop tho..may take a while
---
I am 100% debating with you in "good faith". You just don't like what I have to say. You're making massive assumptions... like this notion that, for some reason, Bethesda is going to use adventure mode as a safe haven for PvP players... players who are going to, what? Jump servers everytime they pick something up?
---
Look, anyone willing to put THAT MUCH work into saving a box of screws? More power to them. 
---
But, as for the rest of your points... most, if not all stories about being shaken down by so-called "raiders" are the same. Outgunned, outlevelled, outnumbered, etc. 
---
How about... stop making assumptions about how it's going to work, as your main complaint has no basis in fact, as far as I have been able to see, and I fail to see how it's much different than fast traveling to one's base to put junk in a stash box, really.
---
So there you go, there's your risk. You go shake someone down... if you're a big enough coward to jump servers now... that's a YOU problem. But, if you're willing to stay true to what YOU CLAIM TO WANT, you'll stick the server, and have to walk to camp with your junk... now there's your risk. Someone can attack  you and take all that stolen shit from you while you limp back to camp.
---
That sounds like it should be, to me. 
---
Like I said, easy fix for what your concerns are? Don't allow hopping from PvP to PvE. Done.
---
Err im kinda powerful... U on pc? U can run with us when survival drops if you have been solo so far. 
---
Sure ill fight ya.
---
Bethesda reads through the Reddit and they have their forums. Enough casual players also agree on this issue. I see it brought up a lot. I'm hoping they just make us make new characters. If we were locked out of switching it solves both groups worries.
---
So I live in New Zealand where was a thing for Otago Uni students to burn couches for years. It was banned a few years ago but it‚Äôs still the thing we associate. 
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty cowardly to fight in groups and feel tough about it. If you wanna PvP let‚Äôs go! But most people just want an easy fight they don‚Äôt actually want the possibility of dying. I still manage to wreck some raider groups but it gets annoying to hear them talk shit when it‚Äôs 3v1
---
In F04 Just hit tilde and type player.modav speedmult 200. If im not mistaken in 76 speed demon  would be around 120. 
---
Even better.  Thanks a million.  :)
---
&gt;or given the nature of the game, a cult
---
Hopefully it expands on the cult shrines and ritual outfits that are scattered around.
---
Amazing thanks
---
Remember, according to the lore, the Sierra Bravos breed VERY fast.  And who says there is only ONE queen?  It's like a hive.  EVERY single fissure is a hive.  And there may be more.   Put simply, just nuking Fissure Site Prime and killing the queen there is not really a guarantee that you've 'ended the scorched threat'......simply that you've set it back a bit.
---
......and we haven't seen a ScorchBeast KING yet, either.  I think the scorched saga is nowhere NEAR complete yet.  I'm pretty sure Bethesda's writers have more in store for us regarding that.....
---
IP changes regularly and can be forced, as u/Ogre314 pointed out, and MAC address, while harder to change, can be changed as well. 
---
There is a sword you get from Rosie's quests that give you +2 strength, so I'm sure it's possible. 
---
I think adding NPC's will really add some life to this game, I love scavenging things but with little story left to scrounge, theres not much to do besides grind. They've said they wont add them but we will have to wait and see if todd caves in
---
I really want a choice to migrate. My gear is too good. Ive got a few sets of 3 star pvp gear im not willing to lose. Its value in adventure mode is about to go down the drain.
---
They cant take away my playstyle and reset me. What good is assasins gear in adventure mode! 
---
You saw what was in the bag before you picked it up, right? You didn't get banned for picking up a bag with a couple items in it. And by your own admission, you did it a few times.
---
*shrug* don't know what to tell you. You got busted for having a shitload of duped items.
---
welcome
---
GT ATXlien hmu I‚Äôve got ultracite bullets for dayz 
---
I always get discouraged when people post cool stuff like this because now it means Bethesda can basically never implement it or they‚Äôd risk getting sued for stealing your idea. 
---
Judging by the road map they seem to have a lot planed for the living continuing story but they probably didn‚Äôt expect to do so many patches. They probably wanted to release things earlier but had to focus on the bugs. I‚Äôm sure they will add some. I get why there isn‚Äôt any when you get out the vault cause of the scourge and hug bats in the air. I liked the lonely feeling and finding other vault dwellers but sooner a later you need human npcs for quest and so forth. 
---
D: Yeet that lil baby ghoul into the sun 
---
No perks to lower the weight of them, ammo takes plastic, they thing fire slow, and the debuff isn't obvious. Thinking people would rather stuff shot with bullets that kill instead of debuffs that only prolong the fight
---
If two accounts log in from the same IP, they'd log in from the same IP after you changed the IP.  That's actually MORE evidence that they're the same person.
---
The companies are not stupid, if they care enough to keep track of the people they banned, they absolutely can do that.  The question is whether or not they care that much.  If you're purposefully crashing the servers, or something equally as disruptive, they absolutely will figure out who you are and keep after you.  For something like duping (within reason), they probably won't go to the trouble.
---
Get in line, buddy. I consider it a major QOL issue that I can't have a [handlebar mustache with a beard](https://i.redd.it/mfja17x8k1j21.png). #LiterallyUnplayable.
---
did you also forget to breathe?
---
My point is I was a new player who didn't know about duping or even what a nuka cola was ffs. There's nothing in the terms of service that state you can be banned for picking up brown bags. It also says in the tos you can be banned for abusing exploits. Picking up items is not an exploit. Guilt by association is bs and you know it. When I found out the items were duped I deleted the character holding them and stopped playing with said player. Apparently they don't give a shit
---
OK, well, join my world if you see me on. Typically, I'm with other folks, though not always, and you can meet some others. I might also have some gear for you -- my stash is overflowing.  One of my friends has tons of plans he's always trying to get rid of and you can pick through those. We're all very casual.
---
I don't know if you're the one who just added me on PSN, send me a message there with your reddit name so that I know who to look out for when I log in.
---
I already suggested that in the post.
---
As well as server locking junk items.
---
I want visibility and a response from devs. They gave the pve community a response. Why doesnt the pvp community get clarification too?
---
Considering they also lowered the RPM yeah, I didn't calculate it out.
---
Really wish damage dealing was faster in this game including that from enemies, it just doesn't feel right shooting things in the head so many times.
---
Also criticals should happen randomly outside of VATS
---
Shit, OK.
---
I hadn't noticed a drop in damage, personally, but I HAD seen a massive decrease in toughness (I wear X-01 with multiple tanki-perks).
---
So the theory is that maybe some perks or PA are busted??
---
I was impressed by how the vats shot from my mirv had the projectile homing in on a running deathclaw by flying towards the left midarc.
---
I swear I've seen scorchbeast attacks home in on people before, now I know they're using vats too lol
---
Legally speaking... not true, as this idea was posted on their forums as an idea for them they do have the rights to use it with out giving credit.   
---
Though at the least they could give a reference to the person who suggested it but other then that. Nope can't sue them nor would I want to.  
---
Believe me I have gotten ideas into games for less then nothing I wouldn't mind. And yes I am writting this down as a written I give up my rights to this concept. 
---
Most are trades to be honest. Have had some lucky drops that I have traded for my dream gears
---
Likely very easy. However that code would probably snowball into a myriad of technical issues. Testing, testing takes time.
---
I put glowing meat steak and purified water in my hot wheel. Made it a lil easier. 
---
You can use the emote wheel, but it's hit or miss on whether or not people understand what you mean.
---
I habe 5 unused points and I'm at level 32 guess I shall use a couple and see if it shows up
---
Ok I just did. 
---
Right??
---
dude, it's Fallout, not a fucking war simulator, go play Arma...
---
Not talking about launching.  Talking about building the nuke in the first place, the logistics alone when the current economy, and political state that the world of FO76 is in, just getting the supplies needed to build a nuke in the first place makes it far harder.  As you said any grunt can launch a nuke that's not contested.    
---
I'm contesting the plausability of making the nuke in the first place given what we know about when FO76 takes place  without any human interaction besides typing in some codes.  
---
I've been doing a bit of research into FO76 lore hoping that its been explained as to why the nukes pop into existence and so far ive come up with absolutely nothing.  
---
Can someone maybe assist me in my information finding journey into why or how the silos are working when they technically shouldn't be without massive repairs.
---
I found 31 mini nukes soon after my first two test shots deposited by another player in the blue suitcase in watoga station.
---
I legit used them all testing out both the mirv and a two shot fatman.  10 of which detonated midflight in my face whenever I shot at the mirelurk queen.
---
You do realize that you present the *exact same* argument that every other player busted for duping/owning duped items has made, right? 
---
To YOU, it's a YOU problem. YOU want back in. And I get it. I'd hate to be treated unfairly to. To Bethesda? To the people who need to get on top of the problem? It's dozens... hundreds... maybe thousands of cases?
---
So what's the solution? Everyone gets a singe strike? "You're allowed to take advantage of duping once!"
---
Dude, if you're being honest... I feel for you. You're literally the only person who knows if you're telling the truth, or if you're just another player here hoping to get sympathy. But I honestly don't see how you can expect a company to spend the money and manpower it would take to play Sherlock Holmes with every single case of duping. 
---
So you're a parasite angry that you'll only have other parasites to victimize? In a dog eat dog world, there is no steak. Only dogmeat.
---
He just doesn‚Äôt get on 
---
This feature is bugged and they haven't acknowledged it. The server will tell you the camp can't be placed based on not just whether a camp is there but also by whether there are players in the area.
---
Watoga, maybe. People frequent there looking for items, and once you complete Mayor For A Day, not much enemies will be there.
---
Near the train station at the Top of the World. The one at Whitesprings is good too, but depending on where someone plants their nuke it might get hit.
---
Can't argue against that. Hope you are right.
---
Whitespring man
---
Yeah. Maybe that's it if you haven't gotten to the level 30 stack yet.
---
Flatwoods, no? It's where every new player is gonna hit, for sure.
---
Because you duped? Doesnt matter if the character doesnt exist anymore if you duped then you deserve to be banned and ignored I hope you never get unbanned 
---
Flatwoods is good
---
Lololol 
---
Nope! Watoga, right outside the train station 
---
I did the same thing too a few weeks ago. Loaded up an old save and saw my character with a laser rifle. First thought that came to my mind was, "wtf? Why am I using this weak piece of shit?"
---
We comparing pugs to ghouls now? You better be ready to get these hands.
---
I think the 'exploding' legendaries are from Horde Events.  I noticed a horde event nearby (but not too close) and ignored it......then a few of those mobs showed up.  Thought it was coincidence, started killing them (they were quite low level), saw a legendary, one-shot it, ran up to loot it.  BOOM.
---
I've never had it happen with other legendary mobs.
---
Ah ok hope you get it figured out.  It shows up in my notes tab and doesn't have a diamond mark for quest item so I just assumed I could trade it.  Good luck!
---
I was planning on starting a new character because my buddy who I normally play with is gone with army stuff for a month, would you wanna do that? Also age? No offense but I‚Äôd rather play with 18+!
---
I still claim my innocence as that's the only time I have even held such an amount of items. Also the fact support won't even tell me what items triggered it tells me they don't know (because the character no longer exists) I'm sure support ignoring a ticket for over 2 weeks is really good customer service.... 
---
Game hasn't improved enough to warrant changing reviews yet.
---
There's a lot still broken and the game still isn't that good in terms of content. Probably won't see any review changes until the end of this year if the road map actually pans out. 
---
two pics from today 
---

---
What do you mean? As plans are right now, we will be able to transfer our char to survival and bak. BUT there will be bitching an bitching and bitching by the pve players to convince Beth to not let us take them with us. I swear Beth will 100% change their mind and listen to the couple of dickheads who scream for a whipe for survival mode. I am 100% sure this will happen. A few will complain how ‚Äúunfair‚Äù it is and Beth will listen to them.
---
Why not just use a vats/crit sniper for sbq? It's pretty fucking strong if you have the guns. TS sucks for vats, but it's not really that good anyway. Well at the end of the day, its your toon and I'm happy for you that you like it. I personally just made dedicated rifle/heavy/melee/shotgun/pistol toons. The pistol and rifle are both vats toons but the rifle one was my first build and needs to be respecced pretty heavily if I want it to be a successful sbq killer.
---
19 and sure!
---
Mmh, good point. But they could expand on it. Giving you extra unique options when you tag yourself as being a raider.
---
But yes, I'm just guessing also. Let's hope I am wrong.
---
yes it can
---
the problem in most (not all) cases are structures that invalidate your blueprint. 2 example:
---
* just a foundation and an electronic door. invalid blueprint, or
---
* raised indoor electric connections will also invalidate your blueprint.
---
the best way is when you save your blueprint often and with different names and rebuild it afterwards. if it fails then make a small blueprint with just a foundation and the item you added last and try if it fails. then you know that you cant save a blueprint with this item and have to add it after you placed your blueprint.
---
Anti-armor legendary only affects ballistic (and melee physical) damage. 
---
So it's entirely useless for energy weapons, though I presume it works for the physical portion of plasma guns/rifles.
---
Also, surprisingly, the radiation effect works on scorched.  They are classified as "human" alongside mole miners and players. 
---
Well, this gives me hope my friend might of just smoked a little too much of something. Maybe it's droppable! If you happen to go on any time soon let me know if you're able to drop it!
---
Dude did you even read the thread. I did not dupe. I picked a brown bag from another user that was helping me when I was new to the game. I didn't even know duping was a thing. 
---
Was gonna say, it'll just make a suicidal bomb that does next to nothing to most enemies but one shots you causing you to respawn and the enemy to have their full health when you return.
---
Now if you did a power swing and it launched a missile where you're aiming until they got up close, I'd be interested in such an explosive ranged melee weapon.  The missile launching supersledge.
---
Awesome, add me up dude pinenoodle- I‚Äôll be on around 5-6 EST!
---
It's not intuitive but if you've been saving your perk points you need to spend them. If you stopped spending at level 25 and hit level 30 with 5 perk points the game will consider you level 25 when showing you perk cards. Happened to me, I had 20 points saved up and couldn't see half the perks I was saving for.
---
I never really had major problems with it so I‚Äôm probably not the best to ask. The lag, disconnects, and bugs have lessened A LOT over time. The game still has a lack of unique endgame options for high level characters, if you‚Äôre not interested in trying to start PvP fights. They are adding more content starting next week though, so that‚Äôs exciting. 
---
I think it‚Äôs very easy to get your money‚Äôs worth out of this game if you come in with an open mind. It‚Äôs an open world survival game with a Fallout flare and most of the mechanics from 4. If you‚Äôre expectint New Vegas, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed. 
---
I still get disconnected frequently and have been on multiple servers with less than 10 players (you can check in your social menu by seeing who you can fast travel/team with). I was in one two nights ago with 4 people. There are queen nukes that no one shows up to, and the frequency of Whitespring nukes is dropping. My opinion is the player base is bored and has moved on to other games, even with the changes. 
---
I'd love this idea. I've been cycling on and off of random mutations (also a solo, f\*ck herd mentality and empath, TYVM) trying to get the right combo to staple that damned starched genes card to my forehead permanently. Last night i finally got lucky and got down to marsupial, speed demon, bird bones, and healing factor. But anti-sera would have been a much less annoying path to getting where I am now.
---
Now I'm waiting for level 46 to start on Class Freak. I currently have Marsupial, Carnivore and Grounded. Will wait on the others I want until I can minimize the negatives. My underarmor mitigates half of the Marsupial negatives and I don't use energy weapons atm.
---
Hey Ladydevann, not to pester you about every fix that might be in the next patch, but do you know if Recruitment Blues is getting fixed? I know they're aware and the support page says it's coming in a future patch.
---
You sound scared bruh, can‚Äôt gang up on lone wanderers anymore and feel tough. I look forward to picking y‚Äôall off one by one üòè
---
&gt; The one at Whitesprings is good too
---
yeah this is a great suggestion..maybe a little away from the station..because a lot of the time the train station is within the zone
---
Future camp decoration? Fill a tub full of perfectly preserved pies!
---
Ugh. Herd Mentality is a pox. I feel your pain.
---
Never had a horde mob blow up and I‚Äôve done over a hundred, legendary robots always blow up tho
---
I always thought Vault 76 would have made a great player hub like the grand exchange. make 2 of them, one for new players, then at level 5 it becomes instanced, and the Mr. Handy's clean up the after party to be a player hub for people to meet and trade.
---
I swear wendigo's are just Super Ghouls.
---
It wouldn't work.
---
FWIW I got it.  'Fuck me' would have been clearer, but not necessary.
---
I've had plenty of those moments, and will have another one once I figure out what I need to do to 'search' things when you have the perk card to find extra things in containers on PC.  I know it's there, I rarely have those cards on any more, but I know for a fact I've never figured it out.
---
So yeah, sometimes you get recipes from quests (for example) and you just 'know' how to do it.  For most though, it ends up as a plan or recipe in your inventory under Notes that you have to click on to learn.  I did figure that out (or read about it) fairly early on, but I had a pretty decent collection of them sitting there before I got to that point.
---
You'd have to unpaint to transfer.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can trade or drop anything with atomic shop paint on it. 
---
Thank you
---
I have unanimously decided to launch a nuke on the top of the world.
---
I must dismantle her, she...  *Angers* me.
---
rad x does deactivade mutations but u say you are not mutaded so... strange bug
---
Oops thanks for the correction, I always get that one wrong :)
---
This but with dismantling her.
---
I‚Äôm seriously sorry but fuck off with this opinion. I grinded MONTHS for my gear, if you have a problem with confronting well equipped players in pvp, don‚Äôt fucking play survival!!! I want to use the gear I earned to compete with the best and not with some assholes who cry about how unfair it is to fight against players who have better gear. Start the game, start the grind and get yourself some good gear. If you‚Äôre not able to do that, live with it or stay the fuck away from survival. It would be the next giant slap to our faces, if they decide to not let us migrate characters. 
---
I am sorry, I‚Äôm really not attacking you personally, just the opinion. It is such a stupid idea and it drives me crazy.
---
Um, okay..?   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Are you wanting to help fight her or sell the bullets?
---
How do you go about trading effectively? Level 100+ here but I mostly play solo, and the other high levels I run into rarely talk back to me, but I also don't want to be like "Yo my weapons suck and I'm only capable of farming rolling pins and robot armor." Or they're twelve.
---
I feel like I haven't really experienced the social aspect of the game. My friends (who talked me into playing and even have me a PS4 to use lol) all quickly moved on to RDR2, but I LOVE this game. Never played a FO game before. I figure most things out from reading about it here or hours and hours of trial and error (e.g., conduits).
---
Yeah a no mic emote would be very useful *hints at Bethesda.......
---
Watoga for sure. I set up by the train and have a utility camp for everyone to use and crops and water for the taking. People frequent the camp. 
---
Shit, my bad. Xbox. 
---
Not a glitch. The random encounter with the cultists have this mask on two of the bodies.
---
Not worth it, still bad. Slowest patches known to man for an online game. Simple bugs still from the beta exist and occur literally all the time. In order to make servers more stable had to put a time limit on crafting... The problems are real.
---
You realize that pretty much every Bethesda game prior to 76 and FO4 are pretty much universally acclaimed landmarks of gaming?
---
The\_zimmers On a side note I bet it was pretty cool getting to work on tech of that caliber for the time.  
---
I ask people if they have a mic and will get a thumbs down for no. Then we know how to go forth. 
---
Implied?  It was pretty straightforward what happened to her living counterpart.  Not gonna lie, I desecrated Rosalynn's corpse by blasting off her head.  She was just a monster, her boyfriend destroyed the dam that flooded Charleston as a result of her death.  He was a monster.
---
Both of them have no grave in the world, they'll be fertilizer and sediment before they get an obituary...
---
Sorry, but Rose sent you on suicide quests for the lolz, I will dismantle her for all the trouble she's caused.
---
Back in the Before Times, I found a legit \*\*\* TS + E + DR when reloading Dragon. Range was 395.   
---
I've seen a lot of variation between "found" Black Powder guns in terms of range. Try over-repairing it and see if it helps...   
---
Crafted guns seem to all be of the Longer range variety, although that may be Intelligence dependent (I tend to run with about 9 or 10 INT). 
---
What happened yesterday???
---
Instead of Legendary Power Armor, how about just **Legendary Power Armor Mods**. 
---
Sorry bud. You might was well log off now and go play Anthem. 
---
Seriously, you should be fine. 
---
Robots man, robots can assemble a nuke with the right programming. 
---
If a pug had a genetic disorder and was furless I think there face would be similar to a ghoul think about.
---
I unequip all damage perks and run around West Tek, breaks things sorta fast
---
Hoping this gets fixed soon. Also, I don't think it works with luck of the draw perk either.
---
I had this happen for two weeks straight before the last patch , after the patch it stopped happening to me. I'm on PS4 . No mutant. Role play a bos puritan type
---
 I don't have a "build", I have a concept. My super straight laced, lover of Grognak comics left the vault. Totally snapped and lost his shit when he realized we weren't allowed back into the vault. "Found" a wildman outfit and a machete, then decided he was "Wolf of the Wasteland". Soon he met a spear named "Doug" and they have been best friends ever since, wandering the wasteland searching for friends and perfectly preserved pie.
---
It doesn't take a fresh server instance to do what he's asking, though I doubt it is as easy to 'check' before logging in as it sounds.
---
The issue is waiting for the loading screen (and they're *not* short) before being told you need to relog.  Checking the spot before you load up the whole world seems like a reasonable request, I'm just not sure how simple it would be to implement that.
---
Isn't there an icon for when the mic is muted? It's yellow when active, black with an X or something when it's "off". Also, you may be able to use a USB Port for your headphones if you get a "Surround" headset, right? 
---
I‚Äôm down to fight, I‚Äôve got 50 cal ultracite bullets I can sell tho if y‚Äôall need some

No that's not what I am suggesting, but if I get someone harassing me, I can report them on XB for Bad Behaviour, nothing gets done other than they get flagged for an aggressive behaviour player .. I block them so they will never see my camp unless they run into it by mistake or revisit the same area, chances are lower .. this will all stop once Bethesda implements a real passive mode and these toxic players go do something else.
---
I play solo so I do look forward to interacting with people. Team play gets interesting sometimes. And aftdr playing for a while, you get to recognize names on your server.
---
Bans seemed to center around duping weapon and ammo. I also sell and collect junk as well, i don't think you have anything to worry about.
---
I consisted grafton killed the guy he respawns and somehow isn't flagged for pvp so we are just standing there with the bad not moving and I cant kill him. Lucky for me  mutant kills him with a grenade and I am able to capture it. No idea it it was a bug of what but it was frustrating 
---
I mean blocked vs ban .. I can block them so they never see me on the map again.
---
Hence, a pvp/pve server where pvp can fight each other all day. I've never suggested taking away pvp, just would like to option out on a PVE server. It appears many "PVP" players prefer attacking players without a PVP build and no interest in fighting back. A PVP server would mean fighting other players with PVP builds (ala, fighting someone your own size), and I suspect many players like yourself aren't capable of winning without sneaking up on a non-pvp character and stabbing them in the back.
---
No doubt many players with my view avoid this topic because a player saying they don't want to do PVP leaves an opening for keyboard warriors to denigrate them with comments like you can 'whine to your mommy' if you don't like PVP. Fortunately I've accomplished enough of that warrior stuff in real life, and I have no interest in your virtual fighting. Congratulations on your pvp build and finger dexterity - I prefer to build a camp, do some quests and wander around the cool map checking out the scenery.
---
Priorities... right?
---
I shoot them on sight now. I rather have the steel. Lol
---
The bos plans you mentioned are not rare at all and can be found easily with a short walk to the west of wotoga train station. One in a box car and the other on the table in the NAR repair yard.
---
Thanks for releasing this pos and patching it once a month.
---
No i am a goddamn wolf. 
---
I eat players and take what i want. 
---
I need to be on a server where i can keep doing that. Not a battle royal full of players with no items bc they farm in adventure. 
---
What im trying to highlight: players are now incentivised to play on adventure to gather materials then move to survival only for battle. 
---
I want to keep getting my junk the only waybi needed to. Player kills. I havent grinded in months. 
---
Server lock junk. Make us collect resources for survival in survival
---
There‚Äôs no way to prove if it‚Äôs true or not but I‚Äôm in a very similar situation so benefit of the doubt from me. 
---
I‚Äôm now paying for two psn accounts to play. 
---
What is killing me is the fact that being suspended means you can‚Äôt log into the website. Can‚Äôt buy merch. 
---
The character i used to craft it, has like 3 intelligence. I wonder if there are different lootable black powder rifles that change via range. I might try the over repair and see if it works. If not, i wonder if there are different legendary black powder rifles that happen to have higher or lower range stat. Like the difference atm is 204 (legendary) and 395 (crafted)
---
I have tried it and it does work with the junk I have on me. I was hoping it would  work also in stash junk menu.
---
Sweet

Team up = win. You're being quitters and sore losers.

Implants in fallout 76 would be amazing!
---
Just wait until you see the patch notes, they are (in my personal opinion) really beefy and full of a lot of good stuff :D
---
Nope. Im bringing my gear.
---
"Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do when they come for you...."
---
I got a lvl 35 legendary gamma gun and have saved it just for that purpose.
---
Just wait... Just wait... Just wait. I think I'm over it.
---
What system do you play on?
---
Zero chance of a ban.
---
Ok awesome I‚Äôll add you 
---
You just don't get the art of the MMO. Git gud, team up.
---
How about instead of asking mommy Beth to do it for you for free just spend a couple 100 hours making a Fo4 mod into 76? Strip the code and you'll never have to encounter another living soul again! Win/win for everyone! :) &lt;3
---
Better than nothing! Thank you 
---
This is why the Institute wants to replace all the surface dwellers with Synths!
---
Well, if there isn't a rational explanation, and it's ultimately immaterial to the story, then yes, not drawing attention to it and leaving it unexplained can be "good" writing. 
---
I have the same problem but I started my character during the Beta.  I thought that was the problem since some of the quests and achievements didn't transfer from the Beta to the non-Beta. 
---
I am able to log in just fine 
---
\*thumps on the grave with the butt end of a handmade rifle\*

(alternative answer)
---
Who?  US, because we're the only humans still living here.  Got a problem with it, take it up with the Overseer.....if you can find her....
---
Had this happen in a bad way a few days ago. Was south of Watoga battling a diseased scorch beast, a couple mirelurks, a two mirelurk kings, and a mirelurk queen. Fun times. Every shot I landed was elastic. Take off 20hp, 15 would regenerate. Broke my shotgun and half my TSE handmade before they all finally went down. 0/10 would not do again.
---
Pretty much.
---
I get a message about not being able to and resetting password does nothing. 
---
I had a couple of grenades from the auto-grenade launcher explode just a pinch early when facing super mutants who I'm pretty sure were firing at me with miniguns so I think explosives weapons like that, mini nukes, and possibly missiles can be hit though its probably rare outside of something like the mirelurk queen who is constantly spitting acid in your direction.
---
Also, I often drop low level or unwanted 1 star items for lower level players to find. Many high level players do the same.
---
Okay well git gud. It's a bit silly when everyone gets upset about raiders using raider tactics. Also it's more incentive for people to rally together and attack the raiders. I'm only level 60 something and I grief players level 100+ because low levels aren't fun or exciting to challenge. Honestly I don't understand why people have a problem with people playing the game using features inside the game that are encouraged. 
---
Can you tell me what your specific issue is so I can check?
---
That would be too complicated,don‚Äôt forget these guys can‚Äôt even change the weight of Bobby pins without breaking 3 more things in the game.
---
I believe that one can convert casual drops to spesific items that he wants. Not like collectors inventories but good ones. The trick I guess is that most items have value to someone. For example a lvl 10 troubleshooters weight reduction armor is useless end game item but for collectors that is an important mule armor that makes life easier. For few of those pieces one can get like 1 piece of assasins sentinel or equal stuff. This is just an example but almost every item has its perks for right persons :)
---
I don't think all the overseers holotapes are released
---
The Strangler Heart ping pongs like mad whenever I do that event. I think it only wants you to kill it at a certain rate.
---
They surely can't continue to ban people for just playing the game, picking up junk and finding bags is part of the game. The logs must be allot more granular than they let on allowing them to identify those people that have exploited and not just picked up random bags or scavenged allot.
---
Scary times indeed. Reminds me of history lessons and the days of Stalin, Shostakovich I think wrote that at night you would be listening for the footsteps on the landing not knowing if *they* where coming for us or for a neighbour.
---
YouTube with it's latest Adpocalypse is also scaring people who are waiting to have accounts removed, videos deleted or demonetised.
---
Not a bad idea, that. 
---
I had a great time the first time tha happened to me. I had all kinds of things going through my head when I had to run it down. I had a blast as a low level character with a huge adrenaline rush chasing such a high level beastie.
---
I went in about mid-30's to try that quest, sneaky sniper build.  I ended up with about 10 ghouls chasing me around (higher level, not sure what they were though).  
---
I managed to kite them around through clever use of terrain and tons of experience on other games.  I broke my 2 top weapons, went through most of my stims and radaway, and barely managed to clear them.  I wouldn't suggest anyone else trying that.
---
Best to try to go there when no one else is around, hoping that the mobs spawn lower level (and running away until later if not).  Or, hope for/get higher level help.
---
Mine only weights in at 5.6ish. You only really need 10 rounds or whatever the default amount it. Against the SBQ that can help huge amounts. 
---
And your right people only care direct damage. If it does to both debuff and damage at the same time they don‚Äôt care. Sadly that‚Äôs the truth. 
---
Against the tougher mobs it make the fight a little better for you imo. 
---
Do you have adrenaline perk on? It may factor in.
---
I started a few weeks after launch and I am also stuck with that not completed. I have every tape and looted every stash. Even the one that only appears after a nuke launch.
---
Something about putting a suppressor on a gauss rifle hurts my brain. That shouldn't be a thing that can be done. It's a freaking rail gun!
---
We need a fix for this. And not a reset. I thought a missed one or didn‚Äôt listen to all of them. Only to know why it‚Äôs not complete. 
---
I don't have duplicates but all the overseers holotapes are in my inventory and cannot be dropped or removed, so I think they must still be needed for future content.
---
I don't mind too much as they are so well acted, I still sometimes listen to them as I wander the wastes.
---
Oh man, a ghoul baby would be an amazing npc / character addition to fallout. Could be a supernaturally intelligent leader of an outcast ghoul faction or something, a fun trope.  Kuato Lives! 
---
Question- Both of the pics are you looking at the weapon in the stash box. Can you check to see what the damage is like when the weapon is actually equipped? Also, I'm not sure if you are running on a team (perhaps with a teammate sharing a perk like Adrenaline or Bloody Mess?)...   
---
I'm not saying it's not a bug, but I see wild swings in damage as well because of my perk selection (I run Adrenaline 5 and some other temporary buffs that show Wildly differing damage on screen).   
---
Also wondering if you are using any chems for damage buffs, and keep in mind, I think the "Addicted" effects are still bugged (?) so you can't see a text indicator on screen. (Just the frowny face on your pip boy)... 
---
Mine only fluctuates based on what food I have eaten and such.
---
Well lvls don‚Äôt really matter after lvl 60 but glad you‚Äôre not griefing low lvl players cause I don‚Äôt think anyone likes that. I‚Äôm not mad about it, I get it‚Äôs part of the game but I just think it‚Äôs cowardly is all. I know raiders are cowards I‚Äôm just pointing that out. 
---
There‚Äôs no honor in a 3v1 and that‚Äôs cause there‚Äôs no honor among raiders. I think it‚Äôll be fun once survival mode comes out to pick y‚Äôall off one by one, but the way the PvP rules work in adventure mode it definitely gives an unfair advantage to group PvP.  At the end of the day I accept it I just feel bad that you don‚Äôt think highly enough of yourself to take someone on solo, I believe in you!
---
Most other games I've played can be adjusted on the fly.  FO76 just isn't set up to work that way.  "Better" games I've played could be adjusted on the fly, I even played for years with game sounds on the speakers and voice chat on the headset only.
---
It's definitely an issue with FO, and not what I'd call normal.
---
I like it when the shop is just a fast track to stuff, as opposed to a "must spend cash to buy" option. 
---
And, honestly... having a "buy only" shop is what pisses players off the most.
---
&gt; They surely can't continue to ban people for just playing the game,
---
No one has been banned just for playing the game
---
&gt;Scary times indeed. Reminds me of history lessons and the days of Stalin
---
This has got to be a fucking joke...
---
That's me, too. I bought the lumberjack outfit with my initial "free" atoms, and nothing else since.
---
Do you really not have anything better to do than make posts like this?
---
I do the same thing. Your sitting on a hot spot. You have rouge bots. SB, super mutants, Mirelurks, Graham and the traveling deathclaw merchant. 
---
Can't wait to build my camp bigger and better with more build space
---
Further... does it work for everybody? If I power up the plant... does someone in Grafton benefit?
---
Because a lot of us just like to enjoy the time out in the wasteland and as a level 94 I still have places to explore 
---
Yup. Just pick up a usb pair of turtles and they mostly come with a dongle for usb to 3.5mm
---
I know they have tied Found Weapon Condition (and legendary spawns/drops) to the LUCK Stat as well. Thus my Alt #5 has become my main. 
---
I thought the Fallout universe was one where digital technology didn't exist, and everything ran on older analog circuitry. I don't see how implants would have been possible.
---
It's super simple, my dude: you crave PvP, but there's clearly a number of folks who don't. No amount of chest-pounding on your part is going to change that.
---
When Survival mode comes out, y'all can pound on each other and your respective CAMPs to your hearts' content. For those of us who don't give a crap about unwanted PvP, de-griefing mechanisms are a welcome development.
---
Dig it or don't, but that conversation will continue regardless.
---
No major changes to ranged builds.  Some adjustments, but nothing significant that I've seen.
---
People whine about the nerfs to exploding weapons, but I still see a ton of people using them, so they're still viable.
---
Unlike melee builds, you're at the mercy of the random drop gods to build a good end-game ranged build.  I've had crap luck with ranged weapons, so I'm still pretty weak at level ~80.  Whereas if you do a melee build, you can easily farm decent weapons or get great ones as quests rewards for end game.
---
go play apex or something
---
They‚Äôre the same thing
---
I second this. Especially at nuke sites  things get chaotic and you will lose your piles. If not glowing. Then a loot all from nearby option. 
---
If I'm in a pvp mood I do it on games better built for it... if you find Fallout to be a good PVP platform you really should check out some other PVP games.
---
It turns out Bethesda is introducing a pacifist mode for those of us not interested in PVP. Sorry you'll be losing all us sitting ducks without PVP builds.
---
it does but not to such a scale and now i had not eaten anything. for example glowing steak does 10+ melee damage
---
I was curious about this quest. If you finish it, do you get plans to make a fusion core generator? Can this be added to you camp? Do you have to complete this quest multiple times to get all the parts or once to get the plan? 
---
I am running low on fusion cores and did want to figure out a way to produce them. Thanks 
---
Downvote this fool back to fort nite 
---
Missing last 6 trophies on ps4 played beta 
---
Oh no
---
I prefer 76 VATs WAAAAAAAY more 
---
See also "Raiding is massively profitable for me."
---
Translation: I'm running a broken build, bullying anyone who lacks a specific counter to it, and I don't want to fight another player like me.
---
Yes.
---
Because I find it super fun. 
---
There's tons to do. So many stories to discover, characters lives to read about, places to explore. I love the persistent characters popping up throughout the world (the psycho fraud-priest is one of my favourites), I love chancing upon cool locations (like the messed up suicide church with all the freaky statues and sacrifices). 
---
I love it. I really do. It's fun... and that's what I want out of a video game. A world I enjoy visiting and wandering, and a place I can "escape to". This game gives it to me in spades.
---
But... you don't actually care why I play it. You just want to make sure I know that I shouldn't like it.
---
Complexity = fun. It's about combining PVE+PVP with 12v12 on workshops. It is 2019 after all.
---
It's absolutely! I try to hit that up whenever I see it because I've gotten AT60 torso and the T45 left leg for some unknown reason from that event
---
There‚Äôs a prestige system coming. 
---
Sheepsquatch and Goatmam are different. 
---
You can favorite food + drinks + chems and they will show up on your quick select wheel.
---
I agree with you on that but it‚Äôs frustrating to know that I‚Äôve just spent my hard earned atoms on something that I might find in the next town I discover. If they had a ‚Äòatomic shop exclusive‚Äô tag on items you could decide whether to take the short cut or keep scouring the waste land. 
---
Sorry to burst the balloon, but this would kill the atomic store's skins sales.
---
It won't happen.
---
I am not trying to be negative, this is just fact.
---
So basically this is saying using a shotgun is akin to shooting your caps at enemies, with no recourse to recoup them? Lol. Damn SG shells are EXPENSIVE. I wonder how much the Ultracite 5mm breaks down to. I see the regular 5mm looks to be the best value currently.
---
Do whatever you want
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
Hide all, then check the Power armor listing.  It's not 100 accurate, but it's a good base to search from.  Farm those locations until you have everything you need.
---
Keep in mind, PA pieces have levels too, and anything you farm at 25 will be pretty obsolete before you hit 50.  So you may want to keep farming once you've leveled up a bunch.
---
I like the idea, but doesn't everyone complete both the enclave and BOS missions in order to finish through the storyline?
---
Something like this for their wasteland wanderers, it could force a choice of faction, and then you could do this, and it would fit in the the "choices mean something" they teased.
---
I wonder if you could fit the other factions in, when everyone goes to fight, the raiders faction gets notification that their bases are "unguarded" and you can run in and rob them, etc
---
I've been playing fallout games since they came out...... Am I not allowed to question this one? 
---
I doubt we‚Äôre gonna get a map expansion, at least this early on given that there‚Äôs plenty of voids to fill in the current area like the 3 currently inaccessible Vaults. If we do get a map expansion, I would think Ever Upwards wouldn‚Äôt take us anywhere but north. I believe it was the cryptid map that also implies there is something to the northwest.
---
Stop spamming
---
No, you're demanding the ability to profit from the work of others. You're a parasite, and a bully to boot.
---
Good luck with the ‚Äúonce and for all‚Äù part, lmfao
---
thanks for your reaction! the last couple of weeks i have not played as part of a team.  Some people told me that the damage inside the stash box should be lower than on the player (equiped) but for me, as far as I can remember, the damage has always been the same in the two places.  I have not picked the adrenaline perk cards yet, was planning to. the only chem i had taken during those ten minutes of playing today was the grape mentats to get better trading deals.  Yesterday I had already taken a radaway (to get rid of hidden mutation)  a adictol (in case i had a hidden adiction)  and disease cure. I did not get a message that something was removed.
---
This is the internet buddy. You can‚Äôt question anything anywhere ever again! Downvote the oppressors!
---
Is it worth that price?  Just wanna know what people think 
---
Why do u want to know? Just go away. I play because I like it. Dont need to convince others...
---
nope haven't got the adrealine perks yet, was planning to. 
---
Yes! Thanks so much for the reply. While completing Recruitment Blues, I never received a Soldier's Certificate from Master Seargent Gutsy.
---
 I completed the "Basic Training" portion of the quest, however when I spoke to Master Seargent again to complete the quest, the correct dialogue appears, but the quest does not complete. 
---
I tried server hopping a few times/restarting the game + my console, and basically it resets the quest's progression back to right before you start basic training. You can speak to Gutsy, and complete the training again, but you still aren't able to complete the quest.
---
your probably right, BUT, I'd fucking buy it that if they offered it in the Atom store, and its perfect for it, non-game impacting, custom, and since its targeted at teams, it makes everyone feel like they need to buy it to join.
---
Comon, its the 21st century. The internet has 10000 of videos and posts abot the game. Objective and unobjective. Just take a look and decide for yourself. 
---
Now, I'm not saying you should steal from the park‚Ä¶ but my prices on Bobby pins are really good
---
1. Amazing thread, effort recognized.
---
2. I hope the friendly moleman would still sound like a nightmare subway speaker.
---
I like the loot all nearby option more easier then running around 
---
Here‚Äôs another reason. Because we can.
---
You still still on this sub? why ?
---
Said the guy ignoring my point, my question and just being an asshole.....?
---
Yes I agree, I don't think they should be able to hide their junk. In fact, I think they should lose a percentage of their junk in the stash if you wreck their base. I don't think pve and pvp need to be together at all. Characters should be server type locked, and everyone should have to start new in survival. 
---
Sometimes details don't fully load up, even on console. The shiny version is probably the less detained. I noticed this with the Drifter Outfit. The back coat part will either flap from the kicks of running, or the outfit, on a less detailed version, will have the legs go completely through the "fabric". Just the system loading and rendering.
---
Yup. Nothing is more annoying than walking around and see that your kills don‚Äôt display loot and you have to sit there waiting for the game to catch up. 
---
Solo PvP was destroyed when everyone got TSE dupes. Even after the patch the weapons are so powerful I get oneshotted in most PvP encounters. I actually had to start grouping up because of the TSE fiasco. I've noticed now they're mostly tolerable if you build around it but having a Bloodied melee alcoholic team build means I just instadie in solo. 
---
Explore everything. Workshops and Events. You are right to wait as some quests rewards are tied to your level and will be much stronger if you finish them post 50 
---
cowardly legendary enemies are kind of silly sometimes. mostly the super mutants. they talk smack and then say "Run away!!"
---
Do the Mistress of Mysteries quest line - gives you the only items in the game you can level adjust. The melee weapon reward is one of the best melee weapons in the game outside of a crazy 3* legendary. Melee weapon can be re-crafted to level 25, 35, or 45.
---
I've had it happen in West-Tek. One of the muties in the room from where you open to door to the treasure chest and the bobblehead was a legendary. Took him out, looted something and boom, off he went. Took me down in the blast. Was a server which had 3 nukes in a row. Two on FSP and one on WS. Maybe that has something to do with it as well.
---
Good gravy. I know this makes your head hurt, but repeat after me: "My fun isn't everyone else's fun."
---
Still not getting it? Okay. Follow the bouncing red ball:
---
Don't. Care. About. PvP.
---
You need it that badly, load up Apex Legends. Seriously. It's a good, solid BR game, and can help you work out whatever the hell it is you need to work out.
---
That is true. The sneak attack bonus is nice tho!
---
I was playing fallout before you were born you moron.
---
Make your own decisions. People who like it will say yes and people who don't like it will say no.
---
Because sometimes people want to complain 
---
Yeah PvP is pretty scuffed in this game hopefully survival mode fixes a lot of the problems. 
---
kind of true but if you look at this way if you collect your own mats it wont cost as much and most 5mm are lower damage so its hard to say. As for ultracite versions I will work on adding that along with all other ammo types in jsut this is a base of what I wanted for personal but thought others might like it.
---
yup not mutated 
---
Log a ticket, it's works for me and rest of us. Some dailies are broken, but most work.
---
Hit lvl15 somehow to use Raider Power Armor. Farm the pieces in advance. Kill lots of ghouls and do the Camden Park daily quests for Radaway and Rad-X. Then go and camp Whitesprings for nukes. PA + Rad-X + RadAway will allow you to survive. Just tag the bloated ghouls and let high levels kill them. You'll get some occasional legendary and hit lvl50 very fast. 
---
Yeah, I'm with you. VATS feels out of place.
---
I'd prefer a "aim assist" that improves with weapon skill, to be honest. But VATS kind of feels out of place, really.
---
For 11 no the game is not worth it. You will need to spend at least 25 before you feel the power of it‚Äôs worth. 
---
/s
---
I have group on PS4 . We have communication limits tho. This game needs some in game guild structure/text chat. Most nights we have two teams of four all partied together. I've considered making a community on ps, that's the best I can think of for now. We work together and help each other complete goals. My gt is same on console signgorilla. We don't grief anyone but exact harsh revenge on enemies. If you need more allies add me . Most of us are on every day
---
Hahaha yep I've seen bases destroyed easily by this 
---
There's 3 plants, each one generally covers the area on that section of the map. 
---
Poseidon will generally power workshops and substations like the workshop with the food machine, the Charleston scrap yard, etc. Monongah should cover Grafton and nearby areas, and thunder mountain will work on some mire locations and I think the truck stop, but I'm not 100% on that
---
Well i'm a level 47 only about 20% through the main quest line and still enjoying exploring.
---
Another tactic I enjoyed for leveling was taking a lower level area workbench, then defend it once. Can get a large chunk of your level from doing that. If you want to churn, you can then hop servers, rinse, and repeat.
---
I usually took the workshop, defended once, then went about my various other adventuring.
---
my equiped cards, and yes, i do know that i need some work on it  ;-)
---
[https://imgur.com/a/pVVV6rt](https://imgur.com/a/pVVV6rt)
---
Yeah we still playing and yeah we still like it, we enjoy it, lots to do, it's the only thing I play. RDR2 is garbage ..
---
Multiple reasons
---
1. It's a great game ( unless you were a duper and your TSE got nerfed) 
---
2. Camp building is fun
---
3. I enjoy helping other players
---
4. There are some cool looking places on the map if you can explore more places then White Spring
---
5. Putting my camp at White Spring and farm the club house with machine gun and missile turrets.
---
6. #5 was a joke please don't do that! I will destroy them. Actually thinking about it I have fun doing that also.
---
VATS only really got shat on before the game came out.  Once it did, most people realized it's a very effective tool.
---
I picked the game up a month ago. Since then I've probably logged 4+ hours a day. I find it enjoyable. At that price, I'd be paying less than 10 pence per hour for entertainment, a good value in my book. YMMV.
---
I do care, I'm just not a gamer that puts games on a pedestal.  I loved this game up until I reached the end of it and there didn't seem to be anything to do apart from farm caps and plans.
---
It's bugged. Have not seen it in 300h game play.
---
Everyone on your server in the area the plant services can use the free 100 power from a powerbox, yes. It lasts for a couple of hours
---
Maybe.
---
I don't know about bundles, but I do know that at the 3 wal Marts close to my house, the PS4 and xb1 standard editions are 59, and the tricentennial are 79. The bundle being marked down where you live doesn't really say anything, but the fact that you want a game to be failing so much that you go onto that game's forums and subreddits to make posts about how a bundle is marked down, therefore it's a terrible game, *does* say a lot about you.
---
Try to find all the locations on the map.
---
But you need to defend your reason to be playing! Justify your playing!
---
Yeah, maybe I just power game too much, I'm past 150 and it doesn't feel like much to do.
---
And the overseers cache at the Overseers Camp.  I routinely drop loads of stuff there. Plans, weapons, armor, ammo. What I don't need goes into that or suitcases at train stations. If a low level player can't use the weapons or armor he/she at least will be able to sell them to make some caps.

Oh, don't get me wrong. You did great , lol. Sorry if my sarcasm threw you off. I use and make my own ammo,shotgun included. In fact I probably use the sg more than anything else. But that prime TSE Gatling Gun can easily go through 3k+ rounds in s sbq fight. So like you said its probably actually closer than the numbers appear. Although iirc with adrenal working, I don't think my GG trails my sg by much in the Dmg per Dept. Not on par. . . But in the ballpark.
---
I think as soon as you progressed far enough in the main questline you can't put them into stash anymore as picking one up immdiatly activates the quest for it
---
Before you completed the main quests you could still find them but they wouldn't trigger the quest
---
I'll give you one guess at how many fucks anyone gives.
---
Most of the turret farms I have seen have people theres tagging then letting the turrets kill them. They get both loot and exp and screw with the ghouls spawn
---
after a nuclear war without any kind of maintenance at all over decades?  And the right programming requires engineers lmao
---
I definitely think so I preordered the tricentennial and I LOVE it only complaint is you can only get cards till lev 50 and how long fusion cores last but otherwise yes
---
My iPad 2 used to cook happily as I played Fallout 4 with the Fallout app running, I really loved being able to have my location follow along in real time.
---
No I know you're point. It's not our job to justify why we're playing a game to you or convince you to play. Play something else if you don't like the game, simple solution.
---
Speaking of this, they owe us like 100 some atoms from when the pick flowers weeklies weren't working.
---
The paint
---
Right, but the point I made was endgame, and at 150+ I've explored, I've crafted, collected, and now it just seems flat.
---
Well hopefully when the vaults are out you got more 
---
How do you initiate this quest?
---
Yea you cannot drop items with atom store paint on it
---
I'll take zero for $500 Alex
---
Wait hold up. I did???
---
You need a good group to play with. When you get 3+ people together, even if you're just aimlessly wandering, something fun tends to happen eventually. I get a lot of satisfaction out of just doing the daily and weekly challenges, even if they are simple and repetitive. Why do people still play Minecraft? 
---
Or some people have played much more coherent games?
---
But have you built your base, and I highly doubt you have done everything there is still a bunch of stuff to do there is probably a lot of events you haven‚Äôt done and that. But hopefully the new stuff will make you play a bit more

You see there is a reason I said what I said. Normally when people who enjoy the game argues back with someone who hates the game it becomes a swearing match if you really want to do this good you keep calm my dude.

Programmed before the bombs dropped and robots to fix other robots, they were encased in bunkers immune to EMP waves. Idk man I just think you‚Äôre looking at it a little too literally, it‚Äôs a fantasy world. 
---
I do like your ideas about field engineers tho, Many A True Nerd on YouTube did a good synopsis of why there should be dedicated classes like that. 
---
Popular spot. 
---
As they said before me. You paid atoms for the paint. So u can't transfer ownership 
---
Sure, but everyone here getting butthurt are also ignoring total lack of endgame/content comment/reality?

What is a child who should take his nap so he can get his juice box?

I didn't think there were scorched legendaries, and then I came up on a group in harpers ferry and saw one was a legendary, and he just took off running, I had to focus on him and chase him down.
---
I wonder if there are a lot more legendaries, but they run off before being noticed?
---
I want to be able to wear hats on top of the urban scout gas mask. 
---
How are you not 20% done I finished the game at level 50 but I‚Äôm exploring places I missed
---
You can verify in the challenges that you've completed all 17 (that's how I found my missing one). The general assumption seems to be that they've left room for more stages as the game rolls out updates. Overseer was in bad shape at Mountainside B&amp;B, but not dead yet...
---
I should be available and would like to join, and may be able to drag along another player or three as well.

Recent SBQ events for me have been smaller groups and non- productive (she lives, all ammo gone), so a large group effort sounds great.

---
I agree with the group hell I made me a discord server to get more people to play with and it makes the game so much more enjoyable 
---
Right, but you're asking while other people are playing - your reasons for not playing is irrelevant to their answers.
---
Tis the time we live in. There are more concerning posts than mine, and there are far more irrelevamt posts than mine. This is a public forum. If you don't like the way things work, don't participate in the diacussion. 
---
A forum post shouldn't cause you to cast a judgement upon me. A lot of people I find are extremely different online vs irl. I'm not a bad guy, I just enjoy reddit. 
---
I appreciate your opinion though.
---
doesn't one pop up on the golf course of whitesprings near the bunker entrance?  I see it there commony, but I'm to scared to go open it now after the steal from change.
---
Happened to me yesterday with a Legendary Supermutant too. 
---
A lot of my initial complaints are still present and I don't want to mislead people by implying that the game is a gem. I wrote this mainly to appreciate a couple of things that those other things soured for me initially. I'll do my best to give a more balanced opinion on future content.
---
&gt;This has got to be a fucking joke
---
Who knows...
---
I'm seeing this too. Much higher level players or several destroying and/or taking my over camps and workshops... then abandoning the workshops... then they will go for another workshop (same people).  
---
If I grab the workshop again (when it returns to unowned), the same people come back and grab it again... then abandon it.   
---
This has been happening pretty consistently for a few days... each session it's different people, but they are consistently the same people that session. Really frustrating.
---
I totally have used it wrong. I tried and died against a queen but I still have it. Thanks for the tip. 
---
The only thing that's really a bitch to find fast in reasonable amounts is ballistic fibre. The rest can be acquired by farming the right spots.
---
Personally I just keep between 50 and 100 of everything and bulk/sell the rest. Ballistic fibre is the only material I never sell.
---
&gt;I have noticed that you get the generator plans in order.
---
It's completely random. I just started a new character the other day and got the nuke reactor on the first run.
---
you‚Äôll enjoy survival mode then
---
I haven't grouped much, so I've missed this aspect, cool.
---
I did this a few weeks ago. Then, when i went backto 76 i was like wtf. Where is the map section of my pipboy. Its like going frrrom driving a manual back to an automatic.
---
Go to your tinker bench and choose ‚ÄúBulk‚Äù. 
---
Look in your stash. Some items do not bulk like antiseptic. I don‚Äôt keep more then 200 of those items. 
---
I don‚Äôt sell screws, ballistic fiber, ultra cite and a few other high use items. 
---
The rest I keep no more then 200. I bulk the rest and go on a daily vendor run. 
---
Selling guns vs. scrapping them gives you a better R.O.I. All those pipe pistols, hunting rifles, etc. 
---
Agree especially since there is no in-inventory-pause
---
Seems rather bizarre to ask people their opinion if all you're going to do is dismiss it.
---
Its all going to depend on what your making and what you need.
---
currently I bulk everything whenever I can, which is a waste of plastic, but it helps me. then I take whatever bulks I never use, like cloth/leather leave one in my stash and sell the rest.
---
Once I've run out of an item I start keeping more bulk of it, so like I have 15 bulk gears 10 aluminum, etc.
---
Personally I don't favor pvp, and am all for the fully passive (with a few caveats) mode, but know what would MAKE me pvp? If there was something more than just "I want you stuff" pvp which essentially equates to episode of Rick and Morty where no one can die (the theme park thing, someone help me here). I say, don't allow mode hoping (can't take adventure char to survival and vice versa, make pvp always enable, and the kicker, make death permanent. To those whom I'd imagine would say "this would just turn the servers into adventure mode," I disagree. People who truly "killed" another character for sure would have a wanted tag, telling other players that person is someone who isn't afraid to MURDER. 
---
The issue with griefers is there's no repercussion. They get free stuff, and if they die, well what, someone else is awarded with a few caps? I imagine for some, the thrill would be intentionally killing, KNOWING you're flagged to everyone for your misdeed, and seeing if you can truly survive while you wait out the wanted clock (timer would pause and restart with logging out and such).
---
Leave now before someone raids your camp and steals all your stuff.
---
I had to turn off the quest after I got the tape in Welch. It didn't tell me where any of the other tapes were. I've stumbled across them in various other missions and through exploring, but should it have prompted me to "find the overseer's tape in..." after Welch?
---
It is fun to group up but I'm generally solo, and I can truly say that I'm yet to ever really be bored in game. For the most part a lot of stuff is fairly different and "new", or varied most times I've encountered. I mean of course you have the run of the mill WS farm etc etc. . . But most nights for me is a new adventure. I'm over 450+ hours so far, and still have fairly large parts of the map I have not explored. But that's just one person's opinion, to each their own I guess.
---
good stuff! As the only person who uses the gun (it seems) I would like to know about railway spikes too. But awesome job 
---
I just want this kind of stuff flushed out.  I understand its a game but its a game where building and grinding supplies is the backbone of the game yet the end game doesn't really have anything to do with it.    
---
Either way the devs can decide if they want to explain that or not.  I personally think that would be the most interesting part of the game.  
---
I was hoping this convo would be more about the possibility of engineer classes though haha.  I should have figured the internet would swarm towards the more incendiary comment of the bunch.
---
There is a prototype paint for the x-01, nuka cola paint for the t51 and bos paint for the t60 unlockable for free. You can also learn mods to change the appearence of combat and metal helmets. (Cosmetic.) But unless you have the tricentennial edition, i think that's it.
---
But you just said there's "no middle game".
---
Yeah, I suppose when I've explored every corner of the game and read every note, there won't be much to do... but what's that? Like... 80 hours? For me, that translates to about... $0.25 per hour of entertainment. For others still less than a $1 an hour.
---
WTF? That seems like pretty solid value for dollar.
---
You can't do PVE+PVP+building in Apex. It's 2019 complex = fun. Of course i play the game up to its potential, it's 2019. I'm a modern gamer. It's a natural assumption.
---
&gt;If you finish it, do you get plans to make a fusion core generator?
---
Nope. The first 3 times you do it you get plans for the large generator, windmill, and nuclear generator (assuming you didn't already find/buy them), and after that it just drops random plans.
---
That said, once you power it up you can claim the workshop and use the fusion core reactor there to create 8/hour. There's a power box right next to it that provides more than enough juice, so you don't have to use any of your own mats to build generators to power it.
---
Alternatively, you could go to /r/fo76bazaar and find someone to sell you a few. You should be able to find someone selling them for 100-150 caps at most.
---
Several places but the most known is outside the AVR medical center. Look for the corpse of a young woman. You will find a damaged holotape and a worn veil - take both to initiate the quest line.

It would be cool if you got experience building. The more walls you place you get better at building and after a few ranks you get a new tier of building options. I.E. cleaner well built wood walls.

There have been quite a few posts about this and I always think its hilarious to watch them run away.  I assumed for a long time it was a level issue cause I was around 150 when it first happened to me, but I guess not.. One of my things was to stage death matches with trapped animals in Fallout 4 and the only thing a Deathclaw was afraid of was a Mirelurk King.  They would immediately turn tail and run and hide. I used to have a video of one MK chasing 3 Deathclaws all around Sanctuary .  It hunted them down 1 x 1 and killed them.  
---
if they can't hit you, they run and hide. Snipe the legs, and step down so they come back every once in a while.
---
And some just run away. Very annoying. I am thinking of farming a crippling weapon as my main.
---
is this an RDR2 is better post in disguise?
---
I have a similar history with this game. I love it and play at least 3 hours a day now
---
Maybe the solution is not just to increase the damage of the weapon, maybe it is possible to add an effect that blinds the npc, or add a debuff that makes dot

They look badass tho

I'm gonna end this right here because we've strayed far enough away from the jeopardy format it's starting to confuse me. Who the hell is Trebek at this point?

"This game sucks so bad, I spent dozens of hours playing it, and worked my way all the way to endgame. What a shitty game."
---
Dude. come on,  now. Had you spent 10 hours and decided it sucked? That'd be one thing. But at this point? You're just bitching to bitch.
---
That's true
---
I am sad to say I either scrap them or use them to burn up the extra ammo. I'll use them till they break too and just keep going about my business.
---
Sorry mate, yeah we do at least get some mods to mess with.
---
Because it's an online RPG, and not everyone is a power gamer working towards a meta-build.
---
Against the sbq is about the only time I'd be worth it. With a decent build there shouldn't be any Mobs late game that give you trouble. Heck I just rerolled and have been using a no legendary lvl20 pole arm and clearing lvl 60 muties from lvls 20-45
---
You answer in the form of a question Alex we didn't get too far off topic. Though I was a little confused by people jumping in.
---
Common. I‚Äôve completed the quest and got zero - burned thru 2K ammo plus tons of other stuff and could never loot a single corpse or the queen. Also never got the quest completed to come up.
---
This happened a second time earlier this week and I just stayed on the server for a while. It was literally 20+ minutes later that the quest showed as complete. I did get to loot the SBQ this time but that was the only thing I got to loot.
---
I've launched dozens of nukes and never had that happen. Is he sure he had a keycard? Did he get any notification about silo time out? The time out message pops up pretty quickly, I could see someone missing it if they weren't expecting it.
---
Sorry that you didn't get the point. It isn't about meta-build, it's about *balance*.
---
I did the first couple overseer mission's and did the enclave missions to launch a nuke with my brother ( We got kicked from the server right after the launch) that's all I have done I still have the kill a Wendigo in a clown costume to finish.
---
I enjoy wandering around exploring and helping other Vault Dwellers in the wasteland. I played all the other Fallouts the same way before I do the missions.
---
Yeah he had 2 keycards on him. Asked him to check his inventory to make sure they were there, and they were. As far as your second point, I am not sure. I will have to ask him and get back to you. But, I‚Äôm pretty sure though all he got were a couple beeps and that‚Äôs it. No notifications or anything.
---
I just tested and yep [I can drop it](https://imgur.com/Qme3Wek)
---
I usually kneecap any legendary enemies as my opening move against a mob because of exactly this.  Doesn't always work out to cripple them because you have to engage their auto heal and then cripple a leg afterward. I've had several times where I went for a mob and left the legendary for last and right after I finished with the mob the legendary that ran around the corner got popped by someone else.
---
I wanted this feature so badly and was really disappointed it wasn't in originally. My elation when discovering this feature was being written in immediately faded to worry when I thought about this same thing. Once placed, will an item be "owned" by a player and unable to be removed, like a wall or floor??
---
Who said they have to *balance*?
---
I got the point. You came here to ask *others* to explain something to you... I explained it to you. 
---
This should be considered urgent in my mind. I‚Äôve been wanting to use a Gatling Laser ever since I picked one up before Patch 2 and realized that I no longer had fusion cores.
---
Its fun helping the lower level peeps out there. Heard a bunch of noise the other day and some poor lvl 18 guy pissed off a lvl 50 Scorch Beast so I hauled ass and gunned that bastard down....no need to be  mean to the wildlife, thats uncalled for :)
---
Just kidding, mowed down the bat, waved to the guy tried to drop some goodies but had just finished a garage sale run and had nothing on me for him.
---
Part of the problem for me is the grounded mutation.  For me, its a no brainer to take and makes an underwhelming weapon class even more so, even with class freak.

---
We don't know what Bethesda did or didn't consider.  We only know what is implemented in the game and what they've stated.  And I for one don't look at lasers/plasma/etc. as something I want to use for 'brightly colored beams that make zap-zap noises'.  What would make me want to use them is them being highly effective against certain types of enemies.  And the simple fact is that Bethesda has not made any classes of enemies that are particularly weak to energy weapons.  
---
Ammo is easy to find so you can use it to clear low level areas then dump it when it breaks. That's about the only use other than preference at the moment.
---
Try over at r/fo76roleplay too

They also leave hardened and glowing mass and high radiation fluids in nuke zones even without a tag.

I would play this!

---
You don't hit X or whatever is the drop item button to use it you hit A or whatever is the activation button to deploy it. Sorry dude but it's gone
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Oh and there will definitely be human Npcs mostly because that was one of the biggest criticisms for the game and Bethesda has a habit of listening to criticism and improving their game through DLC. Considering they haven't denied the expectations of players also leads me to believe that there will be human npcs.
---
It is! There's a silo status holotape, I forget what it's called but you can pull it up and it will tell you which silos are online and ready for launch at that moment.
---
They don't *have* to do anything. Just the same as they didn't *have* to do anything about dupers - but it was desirable, so they did it.
---
This is the same. They don't *have* to balance anything; but it is desirable.
---
And I'm glad you are not a teacher somewhere, because boy, your "explanations" sure suck.

It jarred me enough to do something about it on PC.

Nice to know I'm not alone. I guess misery loves company, eh?

I'm always worried about that with Super Mutants.  They have a strong tendancy to use grenades (even in close quarters) to where it isn't always easy to tell who threw it, or if the mutie just exploded.
---
Remember even the dude that had "600 hours and banned" had more utracite ammo then you could make creating it constantly in game, with constant unlimited supplies.  So if he wasn't cheating, he was still doing something REALLY weird and most likely profiting off someone elses cheating.
---
If you can do it legitimately in the game, your going to be fine, even those people who bought duped items, BGS only removed the duplicates they had, and checked for excessive nuka-colas, the users didn't get banned, and they still had their ill-gotten gain, just a single of it.

Half of the people in my group came from fighting them first, and yes, that includes taking their junk or them taking mine. Junk is easy in this game.

Noope. My explanation remains the same. 
---
You think it's all about balance. Some of us don't. Same reason some of us chose "inferior"  or "unbalanced" armour and weapons in other Fallout games... because that's the whole point of a roleplaying game. 
---
If everything is *balanced* then what's the point of variation, other than cosmetics? 
---
You're an insufferable little prick. You asked a question, but got an answer you don't agree with.
---
Read your question, read my answer. I answered it precisely.
---
Dropping a Power Armor chassis to enter it is very dangerous.  Even ignoring the issue of items flagged as Atom Shop (via paints, headlamps, etc) will be destroyed.  Dropping a Chassis lets _any_ other player enter it.
---
There is an option to "Place" your Power Armor Chassis that you should always use.  This places it down, but keeps it flagged as your own, does not allow another player to enter it, take it, or even see what is inside of it.
---
I'm starting to think that's what's going on. I'm gonna use some of them and check as I go.
---
Whats that?
---
No we should not..
---
A few weeks back bugthesda ru√Øned so much stats that they should have offered a free reset cuz peoples builds got destroyed.
---
Few weeks later and u are asking them to let us pay for it even??
---
That turned around quickly...
---
I guess companies never stop exploiting with people like u around.
---
Not really the same as just being able to re-spec.
---
I keep 100 of everything minimum (unbulked numbers, but I do bulk everything as I am able). Above that qty it gets sold.
---

---
Bethesda where are you? This is what you need to add pleeeeaaase
---
There's a pretty good chance that something like this is coming, as you'll soon(ish) be able to reset a character and start over with some sort of bonus.
---
So just checked in on this and it looks like it isn't in this next patch but they are aware of it and investigating!
---
there's a legendary system coming
---
Ok awesome I‚Äôll add you!
---
Could even be added to the vault dungeons. As they need some sort of unique drops to be exciting.
---
You can take the paint off first though. The nice thing about the paint, and I wish they had more paintable items because of this, is that painted items don't show up in the vendor screen so you can't accidentally sell them. They also give that prompt before dropping so you are less likely to accidentally drop them and lose them in a vaporizing paper bag.
---
Awesome! I was doing rounds on Whitesprings yesterday &amp; ended up level 40 with a pile of non flamer legendary gear.

Pardon my ignorance, but which holotape specifically?

I made it I will add more ammo types later tonight.

You won't be disappointed IMO it's better than Ultracite and easier to craft. Finding MODs can be a PIA though.
---
May I please hit someone up for a Marsupial for 250c after 8:30pm EST this evening?
---
Heck.
---
I‚Äôm only gonna speak on part one. 
---
NOOOOOOO. Like FUCK NO. I don‚Äôt want a bunch of people running into my silo while I‚Äôm working, spawning a crap ton more bots for me to deal with. I do silos solo for a reason, and so do most people. 
---
Thats a good idea
---
On the stealing you just have to wait until the person that ordered the drop picks it up first.
---
Will do
---
I took it to mean in game, not real money.

I recently (last last week recently) finished off my 100% achievements run in all Fallout games on xbox, and one of the last achievements I needed was in Fallout 3. So I loaded up my game after having just finished dailies in 76 and COMPLETELY forgot I bought the Mr Gutsy companion RL-3. 
---
I load into Robco, he rolls around the corner yelling "Kill 'em all and let God sort them out!" I *INSTANTLY* panicked and unloaded my 10mm into him.
---
Jeez I wish I had your luck. I sent a ticket because I‚Äôm out 120 atoms because the ‚ÄúDiscover locales in the Toxic Valley/Mire/Cranberry Big‚Äù challenges are bugged and won‚Äôt complete for me. Got the regular automated reply that they won‚Äôt do shit and they‚Äôll ‚Äúpass it on.‚Äù 
---
I sure hope so! Don‚Äôt know if I made myself clear, cause that‚Äôs exactly what I want! I want to bring my fucking gear to survival!
---
But... while crafting its considered a heavy weapon... why is this so convoluted bethesda?
---
Hey guys I know this is an old post, but I‚Äôve just got to the dam for the quest. I‚Äôve seen all these super mutants and being a loner level 10... I‚Äôm thinking about noping right out... thoughts?
---
But if its a random drop, there isn't an "owner"  but it still gives the same warning, I did it once and got wanted, it's possible the one I did wasn't a random spawn like we're talking here, but it did make me scared to unlock any that weren't mine.
---
If you're level 32, I think you'll need to use 4 of those points to get lvl 2 Starched Genes. Now I want to know the outcome. üôÇ
---
I guess some of us have people we enjoy playing the game with. Getting legendary drops and trading among friends while shooting things in the face is still enjoyable, even without much real content at the moment. People keep the game interesting.
---
Yes psn ? I‚Äôll be on in s bit 
---
That's only true for turrets. I've had several situations where people have built their camps next to the road and I've taken damage from traps that haven't fully rez'd in yet. You can also create pressure plate traps etc. 
---
Well yeah I suffered from that too and would love for them to do that but since that's really unrealistic for them and that was like two months ago, this is the best alternative and we could reset it whenever we wanted. 
---
Also every update has fucked something up but that's not what were talking about anyway
---
I think it was most likely a hologram of the SQ I heard her mother-in-law was coming over and she wanted to tidy up the fissure site because her mother-in-law is a real Scorched B*tch.
---
It may reappear when you login, but if you did drop it, its most likely gone.
---
Dropping a PA suit removes the owned tag, so anyone can walk up and take the suit, and in a disconnect the suit stays with the server.
---
Always place your suit instead of dropping it  unless you are giving the suit away, that way it will return to your inventory if you get dc'd or forget to pick it up.
---
There are 4 PA suit spawns in Watoga, 2 on the roofs with the downed vertibirds, one on the ground with the downed vertibird, and one behind a lvl 3 locked door.
---
Also if you strip a  PA frame spawn, claim / remove the empty frame, so that a new suit will eventually spawn. If the empty frame stays in the spawn point, no new PA will spawn there.
---
I have still yet to see a single accurate account of someone that was illegitimately banned. The reason is because a bunch of crybaby cheating losers got banned, then spammed this sub with disinformation. Kotaku and a bunch of other media outlets picked up the story, and furthered the "Bethesda is Evil" narrative, which was the whole point of the disinformation campaign.  I got downvoted into oblivion for even suggesting that these people were lying, which they were. The groupthink is strong. Don't fall victim.
---
Welcome to the rage crew. I have not been back to the queen since just after the last patch. Never can loot, so why bother. Just keep nuking whitesprings, at least the loot bug there is reset with the next swarm.
---
ALT+F4
---
Because killing it with fire, and lots of it (uh who he hee hee), was not an option.
---
There's a market place subreddit and Holey Moleys sells them for 200 just check my user history. 
---
I Got 3 more hours to wait till I can find out lol
---
Alt+F4 technically isn't an option. "qqq" will force quit the Game for you though 
---
I took a break for awhile and I found myself coming back to the wasteland frequently. There's so much to do in the game and once the roadmap items start rolling in I'll be fully invested again.
---
Ive had the ability to profit from player killing since day 1.  
---
Its a PvP survival mechanic. No bully about it..  Especially in survival mode.
---
For some reason the Reddit gods won't let me answer your last comment. But that's fine, I don't have much to say to you.
---
So far, the only one who has insulted is you, calling me "an insufferable little prick". Look, of you are having a bad day and you are salty, I'm sorry, but I won't engage in your childish back and forth.
---
That's why I will be the better man and say that we agree to disagree.
---
Hey, good talk.
---
My question to you is why would I be videoing a trade transaction ??! Lol I‚Äôm not a streamer I‚Äôm a 49 yo who plays this game for fun,  how am I supposed to know I‚Äôm going to be attacked ?? I just find it ridiculous that people on these pages automatically jump to the defense of the game!! I love this game- quirks and all I come to these pages to vent like many others not to be chastised!! I‚Äôll give an example of shit that happens to me ,I come to discord‚Äôs for advice  and of course after I post  it‚Äôs always ; ‚Äúprove it ‚Äú ,‚Äùhater‚Äù  ,‚Äùdoubt it‚Äù and all the other hate/ I‚Äôm a troll  labels that everyone tags you with when you bitch. 
---
It gets old real quick.
---
The Tattered Mole Head has 1 DR

It was a joke, I was referring to the other tabs that look eerily similar to mine :P
---
I kind of think if I had only played 10 hours you would be saying the same shit though.
---
If they are crouching to enable chameleon, then it is an effect of one of their armor pieces and not the mutation. The mutation will work while standing and the player has no armor, or all armor is weightless.
---
Awesome video, great guy subscribed, thanks for the link.
---
Chameleon only works with certain armor it states it in the description of that armor. Usually it's the weightless variety
---
Crafting - I made a few levels just from crafting.
---
&gt; Also if you strip a PA frame spawn, claim / remove the empty frame, so that a new suit will eventually spawn. If the empty frame stays in the spawn point, no new PA will spawn there.
---
Unfortunately Beth hasn't given us the ability to flag/rename Chassis yet.  So rarely do I ever pick up other Power Armor Chassis, even if they are empty.  I don't feel like playing Musical Chassis trying to find which of the three in my inventory are my X01, Excavator, and Random pickup.  Then trying to discard / scrap the Random pickup.
---
the "scorch killers mod" and the "sacrificial blade mod" will add a star onto the item, if it is already a 3 star item, it will become a 4 star.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that last bit about removing the frame that you've stripped.
---
It's likely the same as the Chameleon Armour Mod. It activates when you're crouched and stationary. You can pivot on the spot and you can have your weapon out and shoot or use your Pipboy. As long as you don't move (except for pivoting), stand or jump, it will remain active.
---
Ah so that explains why I have two of them...
---
You missed when the SBQ doesn't show and scorched earth doesn't even start.
---
You know people are gonna brick their computer now lmao
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Missile_silo_state_holotape
---
Chameleon mutation works by 1. Crouching 2. Remaining Unarmored 3. Standing still 
---
Although armor types that don't count towards the mutation do exist and are usually weightless as well. 
---
I throw them at the ghouls to get their attention then smash them in the face with my sledgehammer. 
---
Yes.  Seriously readers, do not use these commands.  They'll ruin your day.
---
&gt; I'm just not a gamer that puts games on a pedestal.
---
Says the guy that has posted obsessively to /r/wow for years.
---
Ok. Thank you for providing that. I have never used, no had to use that holotape before I went into a silo before. Every time I went in and completed the mission, I was able to launch a nuke. I know this is prob stupid, but there needs to be a better way to know if a silo is ready to be used again.
---
Awesome, appreciate the reply man.
---
This sheet is a bad look for the broadsider btw sheesh. Could use a buff to ammo yield if you ask me 
---
To be honest none of the suppressors in the game are as loud as they should be, and none of the unsuppressed gunfire is either, but that's a problem with transmitting very loud noises through speakers more than anything. Real shotgun suppressors aren't very loud in relation to other IRL suppressors. The only suppressors IRL that are really quiet are .22lr and they're an outlier. Back to shotguns though.. the monolithic style pictured in the game (which are in fact based on a real thing) are pretty quiet and I have heard them IRL with regular ammo and subsonic. Yeah subsonic loads are slower by about 12% but the shot weight is higher by 1/8 of an oz (about 12%) so it balances out. You lose some range but not HALF of it. Same applies to most pistols. Rifles are where you lose a lot of power going to subsonic ammo because there's a huge velocity difference (.308 goes from about a 150gr bullet at 2750fps to around a 220gr at 1050fps compared with a 12ga going from 7/8oz 1300 fps down to 1050fps). The useful range on a suppressed .308 using subsonic ammo is about 150m (I have one and I can tell you the bullet drop past that is horrendous and hits are hard to come by despite the retention of energy from high BC bullets), where a .308 with supersonic ammo has a useful range out past 800m.
---
&gt; I still have the kill a Wendigo in a clown costume to finish.
---
I have some sad news for you....
---
Jump in the stripped suit, walk it 50ft ish away, jump outta suit, take your core back and walk away.
---
I dont know exactly how far the spawn radius is, but its worked a couple times for me.
---
One trick I found useful was to paint my PA frame I use all the time, than its as easy as picking the one with the Atom shop logo.
---
And for scrapping the frame, I drop one of the ones without the icon and its either the random frame or my excavator.
---
You realize that nobody cares?
---
This is the right approach!
---
 You really shouldn't be playing something like Fallout seeing as you are so literally minded. 
---
 I'm trying to be lore friendly to point out how bad the energy weapons are. IRL no one is going to make an effective hand held laser weapon (other than perhaps as a blinding weapon) any time soon. And plasma isn't even on the horizon.
---
 But this isn't real life. This a Raygun Gothic apocalypse chock full of mad science. Energy weapons should be devastating. And for the EXACT same reason that a ski can be turned into a stupidly powerful sword: players want to kill things with dumb stuff. If you want weapon fetishistic realism go play Call of Battlefield. 
---
 Sure, we don't exactly what Bethesda did or did not consider, but it's extremely clear they did not put any work into energy weapons. They suck across the board. 
---
I don't know who in their right mind would type a command in to their computer before checking it's intended purpose. I'm sure it happens though. Remember those people that microwaved their phones?
---
Take over workshops, defeat the enemies, repeat. Show up at events, defeat the enemies , repeat. Around lvl 35 hit up whitesprings, defeat the enemies , repeat. I'm currently lvl 60 using this method. 
---
Pretty hawt, dude.
---
Or when she flies north. 
---
If you find a piece of chameleon armor you get the effect without needing to change any other pieces. When you crouch and don't move it will make you going into chameleon mode. Your weapon will be invisible with this method. Unfortunately any scope or sights will be invisible as well. You stay invisible will shooting as well. Otherwise you need weightless or close to weightless armor I believe.
---
Players sell serums for a lot cheaper than the Vendor price. Just post on the Fo76 trading sub what serums you want.
---
I have seen prices of 250 caps per serum.
---
Gatling gun's fire rate is actually 20. The displayed 400 is an error that's been there since beta, but afaik the gun itself is working as intended, 
---
Well, you'd "kind of be wrong".
---
Agreed, sometimes the people here are just so damn lazy they can‚Äôt take a few minutes to logout and rejoin a new session.
---
Or drilled holes in thier iphones looking for the hidden microphone jack 
---
I have you tagged as getting suspended. Did Bethesda start lifting suspensions?
---
I got annoyed always finding empty frames in Watoga so I played around a bit, I figured after X time that suit would automatically respawn or repopulate but it never did.
---
Still trying to figure out a distance to move the frame so that the spawn point repopulates.
---
People eat soap and video it...
---
Whilst he could have phrased it less aggressively, I agree with him on this point. My character atm is a hobo, he wears no armor just clothes and if anything engages him in combat he either runs away or dies. I run this character because it‚Äôs fun. Perhaps people running energy weapons don‚Äôt care that they‚Äôre weak. I do agree that they could do with balancing, but understand that some folks don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre not balanced.
---
Thank you!! Thought it had to be a mistake somewhere. Just happy to get some confirmation on it. 
---
There reworking the end game in the summer I think 
---
LOL I told you I took/barrowed your layout on discord.

?

Tagged? Yea I'm on an alt account rn

WHOA, where did you find that!!! thats super cool!
---
Engrish prease
---
Kind of late, but on closer reading of your post I'm OK with it and retract my previous statements. You're not demanding the right to profit off of those who play to build things, overcome the enviroment and follow the questline; you just want a bigger bounty off of those who've chosen to participate in a more hardcore pure PVP world. 
---
I'm wrong, you're right. Peace?
---
don't remember where i got most of my energy wep plans, but i'll add untracite laser, gatling laser, gatling plasma and tesla rifle as comfrimed plans that exist, since i have them all. you can also get the ultracite gat plans as a drop from SBQ i think. Off the top of my head, the only EW plan i actually remember picking up was the laser gun plan which spawned in the raider area plan spawn in sutton. 
---
Were you just in my server?(basicwitty)  that just happened 
---
&gt; And I'm glad you are not a teacher somewhere, because boy, your "explanations" sure suck.
---
That's an insult. It attacks me and not the argument. You don't get to pretend it wasn't. 
---
I am not having a bad day, and once again, you're resorting to attacking me, and not my argument. You asked a question, you got an answer, you didn't like that answer. Period.
---
I have low patience for people disguising their statements as questions. Just make a post saying "I think energy weapons are unbalanced, here's my suggestions"... but of you're going to post a wide-open question, don't get pissy when someone gives you an answer.
---
I know, thus the joke comment :P
---
Maybe, xbox? 
---
Correct, I was too lazy to type them all on on my mobile. üëçüòÇ
---
&gt;Jump in the stripped suit, walk it 50ft ish away, jump outta suit, take your core back and walk away.
---
But as soon as you step into a Chassis it gets flagged as your own.  So when you step out it returns to your inventory after 60 seconds of leaving?
---
Same thing on Xbox. My solution was to stop using it
---
A large portion of those challenges are bugged for lots of people.  He is specifically talking about daily quests.
---
Prior. Kek.
---
Also user created content made them that way. See the decaying corpse of 76 for referance.
---
Hey don‚Äôt get my hopes up for a dogmeat! 
---
Heh, it confused the hell out of me back in beta when i first picked one up, too. But excepting the gat error, mostly the fire rates do indeed all hang together when compared to other weps aka laser gat vs minigun vs galing. And the plasma gat does indeed fire just over 4 times faster than a gatlin gun. though right now it lacks plasma projectile amnimations and causes a laser splash on hit for some reason. Still, beats when it didnt hit 90% of the time, though they did fix that -then- broke the animation a couple of patches later &gt;&lt; 
---
Try to understand us before you judge us.

We are getting our own servers so you can stop crying now. We are like dogs chasing cars. Theres no ediquette. Just fun. No judgement. No feelings. No greif.

They don't need to 'reliably' detect its upi, they just need to believe 'yeah, that's him' and block him again.  This isn't a court of law, you don't need proof, just enough reasonable suspicion to take action.  They have the right to refuse service to anyone for almost any reason, you don't have any legal or god-given right to play.
---
IF you disconnected from the internet after getting banned, then flushed is IP and got a new one (not guaranteed, but possible), AFTER edited his MAC information enough to mask it (again, not terribly hard to do, but not 100% foolproof), then it's very likely you'd be able to slip in under the radar.  Unless you signed up with the same email address, or accessed the account from a device you forgot to change the MAC address information on, or from a different IP you've used before (work, friend's house, etc.).  But if you're careful, yeah it is possible to do.
---
Again, they likely won't go to all that trouble for someone who is just cheating a bit, they'd go that far if you were seriously disrupting the service, or stealing accounts to sell, or something more onerous than just duping, so none of that is probably even necessary.  Get a new email, and a new copy, and start over.  Other precautions are up to you.
---
Roger dodger, just wanted to know on that cause I see alot of good ideas but usually they get burried without any responses on it, to bad there isn't a special 'Bethesda upvote' option on this sub, means yall wouldn't have to post but could also do a special upvote when you see something you like and let others see that 
---
you still own it?

What aint no country i ever heard of. They speak Engrish in What?

Yup

True story, guess you would have to collect it and redrop it after pulling your core, otherwise your right, it would end up back in your inventory.

Agree to disagree.

Good talk. Bye!

Comrade, in post apocalyptic soviet russia, game trashes you.

It's a Brotherhood of Steel event and power armor plans and mods are part of the loot table for it. It's similar to the mission for turning in technical data but I can't remember if that one awards anything other than outfits and under armor stuff.
---
Shhhhhhhh! Dont tell anyone. It's been my ace in the hole for a while. üëçüòÅ

Find something to craft with mats you have excessive amount of, get the xp for crafting, then sell said items to the vendor 
---
Lol I'll just leave this here  /r/whoooosh 
---
have you even played this game?  none of this is lore friendly...
---
Added
---
I would say that announcement is several weeks too late. Plenty have already done so. 
---
Hah. Your entire history is nothing but storming out in a childish dismissive huff when anyone disagrees with you. Why bother taking part in a forum at all?
---
I'm really impressed with heavy guns. My first time using them in this game. My gatlin is a monster and now that I reset my mutations this gatlin plasma is a monster too. I'm hype for the fixes coming. 
---
I assume they probably have but I also assume based on her wording that they know who üòÇ
---
So, I got to around 80 just wandering and getting a sense of the game. Since I played at launch the game state was pretty close to unplayable with the disconnects from duping which everyone seems to conveniently forget when defending 76.  I got to around 100 trying to finish PA mods, I tried to pvp around this time, but the pvp system makes no sense on any level, and there is no benefit apart from trolling which people also tend to not admit.  I got to 120 trying to farm nuke zones for gear, finally finding an explosive combat rifle and a two shot gauss and actually feeling like I could quest and engage scorchbeasts without having to farm ammo for days and days.  Then they nerfed the gear I had built around, increased the cost of all plans to the point where if all you did every day was vendor hop for caps you WILL NEVER AFFORD THEM.  So I have repeatedly tried to play this game, as a single player, as a mmo, and just as a fallout game, and every time I have gotten back into it the game state, dev choices have actively ruined the things I was enjoying or trying to do.   So rather than write it off I ask what people are enjoying and I try and give it a go with a different outlook.  But people like you shit on that for no reason while telling me I am just here to bitch.  You sir, are a cunt.
---
Such a disappointment 
---
You currently have a 1% VATS hit chance with a short barrel suppressed shotgun at spitting distance in game. If you free aim so that it actually does hit it still does almost no damage. It takes several shots from about fifteen feet away to kill a level 1 scorched with a top level pump action. I have shot a real suppressed SBS and can assure you that it does just fine at those distances. It's certainly not like being sneezed on by a cat as you'd currently be led to believe by the game.
---
I'll just have to agree to disagree on the merits of a shotgun suppressor. I'll just assume you've never shot with one, or maybe just not a modern one, because there's really no reason not to like them. They have pretty much zero down sides (other than maybe cleaning them) and work really well.

I don‚Äôt think griefing is as bad as it is made out to be. I have played 200+ hours and never had anyone destroy my camp or engage in unprovoked pvp. Now I realize I am a minuscule percentage to base my opinion on.  But I have also not seen a lot of posts related to griefing on the various subs and Facebook pages I frequent. 
---
I personally think it is one of the things that doesn‚Äôt happen as much as people make it out to happen. 
---
TIL
---
Unfortunately, good or bad on my part, that is too much effort for me when I am going thru an area and see something I want on a power armor Chassis.  Even if it's just a few caps or handful of plastic from the scrap.  Especially when the only benefit to me doing so is for some random who shows up later in the game behind me.
---
i really think they are gonna add something

Don‚Äôt you have a bunch of level points to spend? What do you do with them? I end up with loads and have respecced several times. 
---
I always try to give stuff to the freshcuts directly but most of the time they are too scared to take it, so I drop it into the overseers stash at the camp. I really wish that there was an emote for take the damn brown bag! lol
---
No no unless I see an announcement that details that I am not getting my hopes up for roaming around the wasteland with dogmeat or even a dog or pet that stays at my camp. Doesn‚Äôt even have to be a combat pet. Just give me a dog. 
---
Because we have fun? But hearing examples of how other people have fun isn't going to make you want to play. You create your own fun. If playing it feels like a chore, it's probably not the right Game for you. Just move it along
---
You've been told what people enjoy. You dismiss them. Don't try and pretend that you haven't.
---
Nobody "forgets" anything. You asked a question, you got answers, you argue those answers. 
---
So, are you going to pretend that you're here hoping to be convinced to play it more? That's on you... and your answer is no. Are you here to argue and tell us why we shouldn't play? Because most of us have, in answer to your direct question, told you that we enjoy it, and why we enjoy it.
---
But if I'm a "Cunt" for pointing out that spending hundreds of hours playing a game runs counter to " this game sucks", then so be it. I'll wear the "cunt" badge proudly. You're a restaurant guest that devours his meal in minutes, and is in the middle of licking his plate clean while simultaneously telling the server that you hated it.
---
It really is when you get her down to 50% and then the server crashes.

I've had some lag in crowded situations, but I don't think I've had an actual server disconnect since the last patch.

Marine armour helmet doesn‚Äôt exist however marine armour does exist.

It can be found the same way any other armour can be found.
---
I use Gatling laser quite frequently because fusion cores are very easy to come by. With the update I'm sure I'll use them even more.
---
Too bad they removed getting any materials from PA frames, atleast than there would have been a little benefit in picking them up and scrapping them.
---
Wait so this is what it costs if you buy the materials from a vendor? What about if you simply collect the materials and the "cost" of them is what they'd have sold for if you didn't use them for ammo. Because that's generally the case for me.  I'm going to have to adapt this chart to figure that out for my own bulk selling prices now just to see how much I'm gaining or losing per ammo type.
---
I really believe that the rough start that the game had filtered the community in some degree towards that
---
Happened last night to me. Went through 5000 rounds of .50 Cal for the server to crash with 5 mins left of the fight. I decided to sleep on it to see if I wasn't frustrated in the morning. Nope... Lol
---
Those are bugs copied over from Fallout 4.
---
Yup. It's fun.
---
I used Reddit Enhancement Suite to tag posters that were suspended. I was curious how Bethesda would handle the suspensions and reinstatements.
---
Yea a few but when you have to spend one to move and then one for a new perk it can take awhile especially for what I'm doing. I'd rather just start completely over
---
thats cool looking
---
The NPC are realizing they want to live and started a program where they run away instead of staying to fight.
---
I've heard of that but never seen it, interesting though. 
---
I love you too, you big silly!
---
Well its not vender prices its my own prices that I sell the mats for if I was to sell to other players. As for vender prices you are welcomed to copy it to your drive and chance the imputes it will calc the cost for you.
---
You are all over the place, and still a cunt.  You try and argue high brow, but with your tone, you are just part of the problem, later friend.

Maybe wastelanders and the new main quest is starting a new character who is not a vault dweller and having an "Alternative" take on the scortchbeast quest with new locals, varied faction interactions etc.

I honestly never would have guessed the pie was ever obtainable, in any Fallout. I always thought that was the joke. The oversized espresso machine in F4 just cemented the idea in my mind.

It does in the dev. Room only. If you see someone with one around they have been in there. 
---
Yeah, no. If they didn‚Äôt have a stated device ban, then that would open them up to lawsuits. People do sell computers. If they used the MAC, then all it would take is ONE false banning and they‚Äôd have a legal and PR disaster on their hands.

No. They won‚Äôt do it. He can safely purchase another copy, change his ip and play as a new user.

There‚Äôs a group of students at my college/university (shared campus) who are doing a study relating video games with history. They chose Fallout 4. Weird huh?

I'm curious, I've just started using my Prime UGL in SBQ fights ... does this bug mean if I start out with 4 cores, I will end up only using a total of 3?

The lumberyard on the northern most part of the map has lots of low-leveled suprmutants. Get a hunting rifle, kill them from afar and use the caps they drop to capture workshops then defend them, you then use these additional caps to fast travel to different events from the forest, the toxic valley and the savage divide, when you had your fill, server hop then do it all again. Later on, go the tunnel near lewisburg and kill the numerous scorched there. Also, make sure to sleep and make cranberry cobblers for the bonus xp.

I have posted more in fallout 76 than in wow...... It's also a well designed and built game with an actual player base.... And an endgame, and new content, and constant updates and balancing, and pvp, and functioning servers... Shall I go on?

Here are all the most frequented areas I've seen:
---
Depends on what you mean by safe. No enemies at all? Then Flatwoods area. Low level enemies ok? Then near Charleston Station (but not where the vendor spawns you animal). You'll get nuked at Whitespring unless you build closer to the mine and then you have to deal with the mole miners and the random enemy spawns by the train station. I've been hit by SB several times in that area. East of Pleasant Valley Station isn't bad. If you've done mayor for a day, then anywhere in Watgoa city limits would be good (does it let you build there?). Outside of the Watoga proper is...just...dangerous. 
---
Theirs also vault 101 feom fallout 3 that you start in which u can go to other vaults in the map
---
Marsupial and speed demon?
---
I would imagine on pc the game reports the hardware profile of a user which would require you to buy new components and on consoles there is likely something similar to a uuid 
---
@bethesdareplied 
---
And they have the right to refuse service for things in the user agreement. Unless you can find something in there about not using the MAC from a previously banned account, then they do NOT have the right to refuse service, because they don‚Äôt have proof that he has violated anything. 
---
I seriously had no idea that exists 
---
I was just assuming matching up I.P. addresses between accounts
---
You read that persons last line right? How do you engage with someone dismissing you outright?
---
That would be too simple to just get a new ip from the router
---
Nope... pretty much just sticking to the one argument. "All over the place" doesn't really apply here. Not sure it means what you think it means.
---
Scorchbeasts didn't originate from the plague though, that's why they're not at Arktos.
---
They were an Enclave experiment that was released to raise the DEFCON level in the region so the corrupt Enclave President could gain access to the nukes.
---
They just happened to be exceptionally compatible with the Scorched Plague and are incredible carriers/transmitters of it.
---
And the Stranglers aren't a "disease" so much as a parasite. They don't spread at a bacterial/viral level, but are instead fully developed parasitic plants.
---
Also, the only real reason there aren't any fissure sites in the Forest region isn't because of lore, but rather, to keep the area safe for low level players.
---
So even though it spawns with it, you're saying the energy portion isn't compatible with Anti-Armor?
---
Yeah it way down south in the Ash Heap.
---
Its funny and really doesn‚Äôt mean much,but I think the 2mm ammo must be a typo.
---
2mm is tiny...really,really small. I think 12mm ~.50 makes much more sense.
---
All that wasted ammo, food, stimpaks. 
---
&gt; Also user created content made them that way. 
---
No, things existed before Skyrim buddy. 
---
Also, did you just say Kek unironically? 
---
Are you a troll that somehow cryogenically froze themselves in 2009 while reaching *way* into the freezer for some hotpockets?

I can almost guarantee that the first true NPCs to return to Appalachia will be some kind of Responder. 
---
They'll have moved on elsewhere and has heard rumors of someone taking up the responder mantle and using their networks and such, and will return to try an re-establish them.
---
Very much like the minute men. 
---
Looking for Marsupial, Electriclly Charged, Grounded, Eagle Eyes, Bird Bones, Carnivore, Chameleon, Healing Factor.
---
To add to it all, most monsters have high energy res then dr.

I‚Äôll take all of that into account when I rewrite this. Thanks 
---
‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs a Bethesda game‚Äù makes no fucking sense lmao. 
---
Bethesda literally has *two* games with lackluster reviews. They‚Äôre known for quality. That‚Äôs *why* FO4 and 76 were let downs. 
---
Thanks for looking into it! 
---
They did infact state it was a whole new main quest line that was being included. 
---
OR bought it from someone else. 
---
Didn't they remove all of these items though? 
---
PR disaster, unlikely but possible.  Mistakes happen, no one really bats an eye.  People buy games all the time that don't work, literally hundreds of times a day.  They're not all over the news.
---
Lawsuits don't work like that, that's an invention of the media.  If you buy a game and aren't allowed to play it, you could only sue for what you lost ($60), no one will get rich off that, so (pretty much) no lawyer is going to waste time trying to file on that.
---
No, they probably won't do anything though, I agree.  If it were me, I'd just buy the game again and not be worried about it at all.
---
&lt;3
---
I'm assuming it'll be a small group including former Appalachian Responders. Likely a small settlement included or something. 
---
I think that's how it's going to play out. 
---
A few people return to Appalachia, or are driven there due to danger elsewhere, I've said it a bunch in this post but I think it'll include a former responder in a "leadership" role, like Preston Garvey. 
---
Likely they'll have a small camp or settlement of some sort. 
---
I glad we agree, comrad
---
I haven't played since December so it's possible that this has changed, but at least in the build I played energy weapons did benefit from all the weapon perks depending on what configuration they were in. Example: a laser weapon with the rifle stock, sniper barrel, and beam focuser benefits from both tank killer and non-automatic rifle perks. Laser gattling guns benefit from heavy weapon perks and laser weapons with the pistol grip benefit from pistol perks depending on what barrel you use. That said, if they didn't fix their shit durability all other buffs are pointless
---
Good question....whatever the answer is at the moment....it may change with the next update.  I would probably hold off on any major reconstruction until after the update next week.  
---
I don't know why I got downvoted for my other comment but you can test this out yourself... if you join a game and it says your camp can't be placed, there's a good chance if you actually went there the spot is open and there's just players in or near the camp area (Flatwoods). I've had this happen dozens of a times as I keep my camp in a player populated area. There are rarely ever camps anywhere nearby, it's almost always players. I'll check my spot and sure enough I can place the C.A.M.P. in the exact same spot.
---
For the benefit of the people cooperation is the only answer other than gulag
---
They absolutely have the right to refuse service, the only protection the law gives you is if you're refused service *because* you're a member of a protected class (race, religion, etc.), and that wouldn't be the case here.
---
"Someone with that hardware/IP address/Email address (etc.) was cheating and/or disrupting our game" is a perfectly legal reason to deny someone the ability to play on a private server owned by a private company.
---
I doubt we'll see the BoS for a while. They have newer factions (like the Responders) and are introducing new factions in Wastelanders. I think those will be their initial focus. 
---
Smaller, more Grass Roots factions like the responders make sense returning to Appalachia to try to reclaim and rebuild the region. 
---
Thats how manspreading is done properly
---
I had the same theory with the Wastelanders DLC. The thing that makes me skeptical is the fact that they could just simply be hinting at the fact that we are no longer Vault Dwellers but Wastelanders now. I had a theory when the game came out that Bethesda is going to treat this similarly to ESO whereas each year there is going to be a new theme to the game similar to what we see with Summerset and Morrowind. This year is Reclamation where we go out and ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù. Wastelanders may be the next ‚Äúseason‚Äù we see that changes the theme of the game. This is also why I can see it being NPCs. I just don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up and be let down if they don‚Äôt do it. I guess we‚Äôll just have to wait for E3
---
PSN? 
---
As far as I know, your theory on items costing less budget the higher your level is complete bullshit. I really wish they'd comment on it to end speculation. 
---
Common misconception. IT exists it just isn't wide spread. They focused on nuclear first.
---
I don‚Äôt believe they did... people are still getting in there. I don‚Äôt really care that bad that I‚Äôd risk a ban just for that though... food for thought
---
I think we will have NPCs.... But maybe not in this first wave of content. 
---
Sorry.

I'd like a companion I can leave at my CAMP. Or to send on errands. Or even a robot to defend and run a player vending system from camp. 
---
If they do introduce companions who follow players, it'd kind of make sense. Allows more "Parties". Alot of solo players atm.
---
They pretty much built 4s improvements off of the NV mod community 
---
Cool.
---
Dude, same experience for me. I got back on this week and have had zero issues with disconnects, (fingers crossed). 
---
It‚Äôs ok don‚Äôt worry bout it 
---
Nuked flora do the same, once picked the model re spawns but they are now unable to be harvested.
---
Yeah, rebuilding was a major theme they pushed prior and post launch. 
---
The logical progression would increased population of Appalachia.
---
This sounds like it would be really hard to balance.
---
It's known. Super frustrating when it's a 3* that vanishes
---
It may be bullshit. I sure FEELS like my budget got better. But I didn't test it. I very much would like Bethesda to clue us in. 
---
Not for one mistake, but for multiple, yes it would be at least \*threats\* of lawsuits and kids giving teary eyed interviews to gaming media and then the public indignation about them even capturing the MAC address at all and why are they invading privacy...  (Remember how Congress got involved when Google street mapping cars were caught wardriving?  [https://www.techradar.com/news/internet/google-could-face-investigation-into-street-view-wardriving-claims-1082283](https://www.techradar.com/news/internet/google-could-face-investigation-into-street-view-wardriving-claims-1082283) )
---
No major company would do anything of the sort knowing that it can have false positives.
---
As far as your point about him being a threat to him, no he's not.  If he were, the account would have been banned, not suspended.  
---
ElChapo is legit and fair. That's my Yelp review.
---
It tends to go a lot smoother if you fight her outside the nuke zone. Seems to be less DCs and stuttering. I think the best way to stabilize it would to make meat piles disappear during the fight rather than leaving 100 lootable containers for 10 different players open. If you get a bird's eye view after a fight you'll see so many meat piles it makes sense why the server crashes. It's not much different than when people farm white springs and don't loot everything. How you can achieve this without also making it so the SBQ's meat pile doesn't disappear, I dunno. 
---
Do energy weapons still break in 20 shots?
---
Agreed, wouldn't be sad to see the 10 threads a day arguing this disappear.
---
Voice module online. Audio functionality test initialized. Designation: Liberty Prime. Mission: the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska. Primary Targets: any and all Red Chinese invaders. Emergency Communist Acquisition Directive: immediate self destruct. Better dead, than Red.
---
Alot of people are making these budget tweaks sound like a budget increase. I thought it was only reducing some items budget cost and limiting amounts of some things like turrets. 
---
I use zero turrets so I'm expecting zero or minimal impact on my camp budget. 
---
Not really the fact that players can at max have 8 implants with each type being limited makes it pretty easy to balance. IF you want hard to balance look at mutations as players can have as many of those as they like. 
---
I know right!
---
3rd floor mostly. Take the elevator up. Check around the bunk bed rooms and bathroom right in front of you. 
---
Hats spawn in the bathroom by the showers and on top of the metal crates your facing when the door opens. 
---
I'm typically down to 2-3 hits for Ghouls - even level 68's... if I take a chem - maybe 2.  For me - its the All Rise which I absolutely love using given I can get it into the mid-200's damage wise per swing.  If there are better - I'm game and always on the lookout but have to admit this is probably one of the best Melee weapons I've found (ok toiled over) to get.
---
BTW - my secret to getting it easier is that when that mission on top of the building had me fighting the robots and a scorchedbeast, I just hid in the elevator for 5 mins and passed the mission. Dunno how that happened but it idid...
---
how many u have?
---
Could Wastelanders also be implying player cities or guilds?
---
Good that I‚Äôm not Chinese they never could communism correctly in that case I shall send over some cookies and I shall toast with my new American friends
---
Once I make these stable fluxes from the nuked Flora section of the chemistry bench, what are they good for?
---
Wow, that‚Äôs alot of info but i will definitely make use of it. Luckily i just discovered the lumberyard, the workshops i should capture are those also in the forest and toxic valley?

Nah, another week or so. Have em miss the launch of the first new content by a few days.

---
Where do you find a Grog Axe. My highest level character is 88 and i have yet to find one. . .
---
Hopefully they decrease the amount of budget lights take up. Their radius already sucks. 
---
How are you determining material cost? Vendors or is that just arbitrary? I don't think I've paid more than 1 cap per on any ammo and it's generally not the norm. I think it's because I've never paid 5 per plastic or 2 per steel or whatever
---
No, with 3 cores, when you switch to a UGL, you'll have 3 ammo in the magazine. You will quickly empty that and and load you first core inny the gun for 500/650/800/999 shots of it's at 100% or more. It won't eat anything. You'll start shooting and can fully deplete it. Then you'll load your second and third cores.
---
Now if you don't shoot those 3 rounds quickly and just walk around (say after a login), after a moment it will say 3 rounds in chamber but only 2 cores total. Your "loaded" core disappeared.
---
Same thing will happen if you load a real core, switch to a different weapon and switch back. It will again say 3 rounds in chamber and 3 cores total. If you won't reload quickly, it will consume one of the cores and you're left with 3 rounds in chamber and 2 cores available for reload.
---
I have like 200 cores on me and use only gatling lasers. Normally I'd switch them around for the situation (troubleshooter's vs robots, big mob under 40% for executioner, zealot's for scorched, vampire when low health etc), but each time I do, the current partially used core gets forgotten by the current gatling, next gatling starts with the weird rounds = cores state, I have to quickly reload, else it will eat one of the cores... And it all repeats when I need to switch the gun again.
---
A core is tied to a gatling laser only after a reload and it's not really owned by it / really loaded into the gun. It's still showing as a core in inventory that gets depleted with each shot. That's unlike power armor frame, which actually removes the core from your inventory and moves it as part of itself. So you don't see it anymore in your inventory and you can only see it by looking inside a power frame. Gatling lasers don't have their own personal inventory for storing a reloaded core until it's depleted or reloaded. 
---
Also, did I mention power armor doesn't discriminate and loads ultracite fusion cores as long as they're the next one to pick? With 120% ultracite fusion cores, shooting the entire clip of a prime gatling laser actually leaves the ultracite fusion core at 20% in your inventory and with the last patch change, PA frame picks the lowest charge core first... So it's usually the 20% ultracite one... Which if reloaded into a prime gatling, would give up to 400 extra rounds (double legendary + power user). Usually 200 rounds lost with typical lvl3 power user...
---
It's such a waste... At least now it's a 20% core wasted on PA, before it was a good chance a full 120% one got pulled into a PA frame... 
---
That‚Äôs pretty much what I‚Äôm thinking but I think it‚Äôll be people from a neighboring state.
---
I am talking about the weeklies and dailies, I know some of the other ones are bugged but at the same time I think some of those bugs might be to our advantage and reward on on some of them, so it may balance out somehow. But yeah needs to be fixed, it's low on their list as they couldn't care about us earning atoms
---
Wait a few weeks for the ITV on player vending or the Camera.
---
The power never worked for me. It always told me to repair even after I completed everything. 
---
Gotcha

Save some caps and buy a low level tse weapon, use the different vendor factions each day get 200 caps from each and in 5 days or so you can buy one. Even is your mele a good tse will speed your trip to lvl 50 along.

I've got 80-100 hours in, and I still log in every day.  Is that amount of entertainment worth ¬£11 to you?

Granted, Fallout has a particular playstyle, and not everyone likes that, but that's up to you.  If you played and enjoyed any of the other Fallout games, I'd think you'll be fine.  If not, watch a few streamers playing it to get the hang of what it's like (don't bother with YouTube, it's gone completely political the last few years and most YTers only care about views, not gaming).

And him simply stating "I just got that computer used" or "that's my brother's/dormmate's/spouse's computer" would be enough to make it a big problem for them.  There is nothing in the TOS or the suspension that mentions the hardware and there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY for them to reliably tie it to him.
---
They can't arbitrarily refuse service to HIM because the computer was used by SOMEONE.

I've sometimes had this happen and the body (actually, the meat pile) will reappear where the enemy spawned in originally. I've had this happen at the golf club and at Fort Defiance.

It seems like he's going for a PvP build. PA isn't much viable in PvP except for unique circumstances.
---
Ah, chameleon weightless build, you will be a terror.
---
They seem fairly common as legendary drops go. Try whitesprings or Watoga for legendaries. Also check the vendors as some people may have sold them. I managed to buy a BoS weightless combat armor chest piece from a vendor one day. Luck 15 paying off there.
---
I'm surprised no has done a video testing this. Would be fairly easy. One would need two characters, CA would be over lvl 50 and CB would be lvl 5ish or so. Place a new camp down in a clear area free of rocks, trees, ect such as the dry lake bed. Then build multiple high cost items such a turrets and finish off with potted plants until max is hit. Either they would end up with the exact same amount or they wouldn't. 
---
Run away, live to fight another day....  how do you think it lived long enough to become legendary?

---
Why can't they create armor color patterns, where you can actually choose the primary, secondary and highlight colors you want on the atom purchased pattern?
---
If you were going through 1000 rare things a day (the specially crafted untracite ammo, 3-star legendary items, etc.), they may take notice of you.  That's what the bans were for, not for picking up a few hundred ceramic vases or shot glasses.  You're fine, absolutely nothing to worry about.
---
I love gatling lasers and use them all the time. I just don't use them efficiently... Switching them around messes up the inventory (see my other post here), so I'll keep shooting the current gatling until it breaks, no matter if it's effective in the current encounter or not... 
---
My level 50 2* Instigating Grognak axe showed up at my camp on a lvl 68 scorched. RNG gods be praised. Good luck.
---
I miss the old days.. I found a Furious Explosive Double Barrel. I'm not a shotgun build, but it worked brilliantly at range with the long barrel. Up close it was ridiculous, certainly. Sure was nice being able to reliably kill something (anything) with a shotgun at 50 metres though! 
---
And prompt; best/easiest trade I've done so far.
---
Wow.
---
OK, so if I want to be totally safe about not wasting any cores, I should only equip it during the fight and then fully deplete all my cores ensuring that there are no more cores to "eat" whether I switch or not?
---
I would add enough xp to my character to make him level 500 so I can respec however I want and try out new builds with all of my current gear.  
---
Was it to take the GOAT?! Ironically enough the last achievement I needed for FO3 was to take the GOAT exam, because I always skipped it haha 
---
I pick the price based on what I sell it for. You can replace the numbers at the top with what ever costs you. By changing values of those it will auto update the costs. So if lead costs you nothing put 0 to help calc the costs lower.
---
The amount of misinformation here is crazy. Chameleon armor legendary is only active when crouching and makes a beep when it activated. The state of your weapon does not matter for the armor version. The mutation can only be used while unarmored or in weightless armor, and is turned on by having your weapon out while staying still. You can be standing or crouching for the mutation. The mutation does not make a beep but makes a silent shimmering effect around the player for a moment when activated. I honestly prefer the mutation with weightless since the beep of the armor can give you away when trying to spook other players.
---
Thank you, that‚Äôs the information I can use!

Maybe not join, because if a feud began, it would be hard to divide the resources back up. But putting C.A.M.P.s close together to build communities would be great!

---
Don't switch away from the gatling laser and if you have to and then switch to it again, quickly reload to force a real core linked to the gun. Your PA eating ultracite fusion cores you can't do anything about... Also get ready for lots of partially used cores in your inventory, so again, s mess and potentially lost cores due to PA autoloading low charge ultracite ones. 
---
Yeah, you can use https://fo76map.com to look for them, it's interactive and stuff like that.

There will be no human npcs. Just frigging deal with it. Jesus.

We can't re-craft low charge UFCs into new UFCs, can we?

It would be cool if we could combine multiple low charge FCs (U or normal) into overcharged versions.

I want to be a mole rat, screw with people by not coming off the ground, they'll constantly be in "danger" mode, not being able to fast travel because of me. I'll be there following them til the ends of the earth.

Yeah, I always(particularly at White Springs) tag the Legendaries I see there immediately because I'm concerned someone will roll up and just one hit melee them before I can get to them.  Now I just use a Tesla rifle there to tag the hordes as quickly as possible and still leave lots of hp's remaining on the ghouls for everyone else to get their damage in to ensure they all get drops.
---
Oh wait, I just fought you! I'm MarkFails. That was a damn fun fight
---
Agreed, by the way I have a ‚Äòsituation‚Äô in Mexico you could help with one minor Trotskyite nothing major 
---
They can also spawn in the bathroom, if you do not see what you're looking or what you want, do not pick anything up
---
that sounds like a cool idea
---
They also spawn in a few other spots if you go right when you enter the asylum past the turret. There are lots of ghouls and a starred legendary in that direction though.
---
Was Cait's Corset already in the shop?

You won‚Äôt be able to rest your perks because you get perk card packs and - trust me - they haven‚Äôt been tracking which are free and which you picked.

For Vanu! Crap, I'm out of batteries....
---
Nope, can't turn an almost depleted ultracite into a new ultracite . And a lot harder to convert those 2-5% almost dead ones into a 120% ultracite, since PA now autoloads the lowest charge one... So you'd need to keep leaving the almost dead ones in your stash. 
---
hehe was a blast then my 2nd had to go and the guy at the workshop was not doing anything. I was only helping the other guy defend that place but 3vs1 sure I would kill one or 2 of you but it be just a waste. So I was like what the hell im bored I will finish adding other ammo types and doing that now.

you're assuming everyone on the survival server is going to be a pussy like you, but in reality some of us are just going to continue to play the game as we are now.

Trust me, I'm intimately familiar with the way the law works on these things.  That article (which isn't particularly good, but makes some good points) talks mostly about religious and sexual discrimination.  From that article:
---
&gt;owners can refuse to serve customers, but must be careful that the denial of service is based on customer behavior, decorum or the health and safety of patrons and employees.  
---
That would cover Bethesda quite easily.  They were acting to protecting their customers and game from a cheater, to the best of their ability.

Worst case, if brought to a court, the judge would say 'you assumed he was cheating, and you were wrong, give him his money back'.  Maybe, *maybe* they'd have to cover the lawyer's fees.  But that's the absolute best case scenario for someone under the circumstances, and it's in no way a sure outcome.
---
The law, particularly civil law which covers this kind of thing, doesn't at all work like you see portrayed in the media.  I'd invite you to hang out over at /r/legaladvice for a bit and read what the people there have to say about things.  If you spend some time there looking at the advice (and FFS do not comment there unless you absolutely know what you're talking about, they're ruthless when someone is wrong), you'll get a little better idea about what to expect when dealing with the law and the courts.  I'm there quite a bit, and it's been quite eye-opening.
---
Unfortunately, you don't get achievements on PC. You do complete daily/weekly/all-time challenges to earn atoms. Once you're in a server, hit esc then z to load the main menu. There should now be a challenges option. You can see what you've done and what you can still do to earn atoms.
---
I feel like some of the people may have already been here the whole time. They just hid from the scorchbeasts and the scorched better than the others that didn't make it. 
---
Yup, lumber yard, penitentiary yard, grafton dam and grafton steelyard.
---
It took me forever to get, but now I need the green hood to go with it.
---
Multiple people have done tests and posted the results to show that the budget never changes. The only ones who usually dont post proof are those that say it increases lmao
---
I‚Äôm 109 and have still yet to launch a nuke or even finish belly of the beast, I don‚Äôt think the game was made to power through everything before level 50 but that‚Äôs just my own personal opinion. 
---
That is what you get for playing the game normally. 
---
Chameleon armor activates when you crouch and hold still, weapon or not.  Chameleon mutation activates when you draw your weapon and hold still, crouching or not.
---
Chameleon mutation requires "weightless" armor (which is a legendary effect).  There are 2 and 3\* legendaries that combine weightless with weight reduction effects (ammo, chems, weapons, etc), but they are not common.  One thing you might not have realized: armor for chameleon mutation is SIGNIFICANTLY lighter than regular armor.  When I switched over, my armor weight dropped 40 lbs.
---
Chameleon armor is easy to find and you only need one piece.  I'd recommend you start with that.  You can find it quite easily. 
---
Lastly, if you don't need a jetpack, there are stealthboy mods for power armor.  Crouch and you vanish -BUT it drains AP to do so.
---
Yeah. Fight in the forest till you get established. Then, go to toxic valley and fight some stronger enemies. Then, go down to the ash heap and fight the enemies there. Keep fighting enemies on your lvl and work your way to the bog. 
---
Tips on how to level, come on man. Play the game. Unless you‚Äôre standing still you‚Äôre earning xp all over the place. 
---
I don't think there is a random, they are all "ordered".  People that report the message are people that just beat the person to the drop.  Maybe they were slack getting there, doing something else, disconnected or quit from the game, etc.  I've seen a couple that were locked, and as soon as the person got there to pick it up it became open to all.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt use them until the bug is patched. It‚Äôd rather just avoid the frustration of seeing fusion core ammo unfairly disappear from my inventory.
---
Ok give me a few minutes 
---
If no one else has already done it, and I have some free time this weekend, I may have to take that on.  I'd hate to lose my current base, but we'll see how bored I am.  But, it might be worth it for the fake internet points ;-)
---
I primarily use a Gatling Plasma and it does the same thing. 
---
Yeah, that's an option.  Works still like to see an equip / auto consumption option
---
I had those issues in January. Hope the dupers aren't back.
---
Pretty sure Poseidon does the Forest, Ash Heap, and Toxic Valley. Monangah does the Savage Divide, and Thunder Mountain does the Mire &amp; Cranberry Bog. I could be wrong, but that‚Äôs my understanding 
---
Shotgun mod and better scope. Mines a 1 star, forget what it‚Äôs special ability is. I keep it to deal with bugs (flying and ground) and bees primarily.
---
Thanks!  I've been a 'whatever keeps me alive and swinging' build for a while (and have had my frustrations if you checked my post history), but that's really only because i was farming white springs.  When I play a regular fallout game or skyrim etc I usually am a high sneak character, and I think it's time to get back to my roots.  I'm thinking a shotgun for in case something closes in on me,m though.
---
Not really, I only did it because I stumbled onto a few good weightless drops. Pretty sure ai don't hear the beep so the only purpose of going that route is RP/messing with people.
---
You ever play 7 days to die?  This is like a better version of that game.
---
/u/Ladydevann What about my Salvaged Assaultron heads?!?!? 
---
Oh yea, same deal with a gatling plasma. You need to quickly reload after a weapon change or login to not loose cores. And it's a mess in inventory as the gun-core association gets wiped as soon as you change guns. At least PA is not eating plasma cores... 
---
There‚Äôs a Marine Tactical Helmet. I follow a Youtuber called WitnessMeGaming and he shows 3 locations where the plans are known to spawn. I have yet to get them though. I assume they‚Äôre extremely rare.
---
Okay, thank you.
---
100 of them 
---
that‚Äôs hot too hot
---
I keep you in mind
---
Well, technically speaking all of them can be crafted again.   T45/51b/60 Armor plans are just a bit rare (they come from maps at low chances) compared to the Excavator/X01/Ultracite (which come from quest rewards)
---
I play lots of Arma. 
---
And lots of fallout.  I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs a bad idea for fallouts setting. Fallout bases its self around small engagements. 
---
With out a suppression system numbers will win no matter what. That isn‚Äôt how fallouts theme works in my opinion. 
---
They‚Äôre great for tagging glowing ones/adds in nuke zones. No missing out on kills when people drop them in a hit or two 
---
I am not a lawyer nor do I claim to be one, but I am a businessman and have worked for companies both smaller and larger than Bethesda.  My background includes risk management, and that's why I'm saying that they could be 99% sure it was the same person, and would still err on the side of caution because they have not made any statements about the IP or MAC address being restricted.  If they cared, they would have simply stated that they were suspending the computer too and it would CYA them.
---
In fact, I'm pretty sure that they have not mentioned players at all, just accounts, as in "the account is suspended".  That would mean that he's free to create another account.
---
Thank you, I actually didn't know that
---
Hm, I haven‚Äôt had any issues with my dailies/weeklies. Guess I got lucky üòÇ
---
you didnt dupe it. have fun
---
I just thought that once you hit the higher-ish levels it would become more difficult levelling up with the amount of xp you get
---
Blu_bomber
---
Yeah, but that seems to be the only thing it's good for... and it will also tag players haha.
---
I see them all the time, super hard to hit them too.  I'm just standing there swinging an axe wildly in the air hoping I can land a hit on that tricky mutated Giraffadog
---
You on PS4? Got any PA armor part plans to sell? :) 
---
In theory
---
No.  Chameleon mutation is activated by drawing your weapon.  You don't have to crouch at all.
---
When it started it was 3v1 on me. My discord just FTed to me once I said someone was running full sentinel gear. I figured you were running weightless+sent. Either that or that was stealth bois. 
---
I doubt that quantity would have been duped. Most duped items were in the 10's of thousands. I've heard warning to be careful when digging up the same spot more than a few times all at once. Heard it can crash your game. Do a few then go elsewhere and come back to that spot later. Not sure how true it is, thought, but thought I'd pass it along.
---
I'll be home in 30 mins
---
explosives are weird. If you hit the enemy directly it counts as direct damage, and is impacted by armor, but if you miss and hit with the area of effect it does not count as direct damage and ignores armor, both are effected by explosive resistance. This is why SB's take very little damage from explosive weapons, you have to hit them to damage them, but hitting them causes their armor to mitigate a lot of the damage. 
---
Shooting near enemies dealing more damage than actually hitting them is just another of the weird bugs this game has.
---
FO4 had a mod that made items in your inventory static camp pieces you placed. You‚Äôd place a weapon like you place a potted plant and to pick it up you‚Äôd have to scrap it. 
---
Aside from that, just be patient. Your questions will be answered in a little while when they update. 
---
Are you open to PVP? A silencer is mandatory if you want to be the one alive. On the occasions I cannot rely on vats kills against players, the silencer seems to completely mask any sound or tracers when I shoot. Often I see people panicking or spinning in circles trying to find me.
---
I might have one piece of weightless I can spare. I will have to check when I am home.
---
as far as i know not yet, i was on lvl 20 by release day so i had to go back and get a new character to do all the achievements i had made up to 20 before beta ended to get credit for em. 
---
I've never heard this beep on PC and I used Chameleon armor for three months.  Perhaps it's a console thing?  Also, perhaps it's audible only to the user?
---
On PC, the chameleon mutation effect shimmers as it activates, but your vision also fades to black and white as it does so.  It returns to color after the transition finishes.
---
Yup.  Have those...but under ultracite plans, not energy weapon plans...just a lonely gauss rifle lol
---
It‚Äôs a sandbox and you have no imagination. I‚Äôve got a mile long list of things I still want to do, even after hundreds of hours. 
---
I have 15 intelligence and 15 strength because I made a power armor/ heavy guns build.   I have all three ranks or power user, all three ranks of stabilized, all five ranks of gunsmith and all three ranks of power patcher plus a point in first aid. 
---
Agreed. Voice drove me crazy. 
---
ROTFL.  Now you're telling me to go away.  Sorry, won't work.
---
Literal minded?  No, but I know what the Fallout series is based on, and that what you seem to think is just distant science fiction, is actually quite real today.
---
Directed Energy weapons?  CW Laser and Maser weapons are already developed:  https://www.onr.navy.mil/en/Science-Technology/Departments/Code-35/All-Programs/aerospace-science-research-351/directed-energy-weapons-cdew-and-high-energy-lasers
---
An infantry-based nuclear catapult?  Had it back in the 50s:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khyZI3RK2lE
---
Anyone who's ever waxed a ski knows how easy it is to sharped one too.  It's simply a question of making an effective weapon from what you have.  
---
Sure, there are things that we don't have yet.  Plasma weaponry is still being researched, and in real life radiation doesn't give you convenient mutations, it just cooks you and kills you.
---
So no, I'm not "Literal Minded", I just prefer that they get things that ARE real 'correct', or at least within reason.
---
The only Marine helmet I know of is the Tactical Helmet. You can find the plans for it at Drop Site C-2 (Northeast of Watoga, east of the railroad tracks). Go in, turn on your light and search the shelves on the left wall behind the caged entry. If you are on Xbox, I can make you one if you'd like.
---
I don't think Atoms should ever provide a mechanical benefit.
---
Keep leveling? Several other trophies like the locks and hacking happened past the required 50. Maybe you need to level, other than that working i dont think theres a fix outside of starting all over.
---
Adrenal reaction also
---
I guess my point was that these are all in other categories,  not under energy.  Gatling and Tesla is under heavy, all ultracite have there own tab, etc.
---
If you were wearing the veil, and it has been repaired, it cannot have been toxic air as the veil protects you from that. My guess is invisible enemies. 
---
I was just going to say the same thing.....lol.  The scorch killer mod can either be bought at Charleston fire dept or you can find the plans on a fire breather responder near east tunnel entrance. The sacrificial blade mod can be bought from various protection venders.
---
I feel like trapper should increase your capability against animals, like less damage taken, more stealth, more damage, some bonus against animals rather than a downside. Just an idea
---
Allowed but not supported. Been using glowing bags, glowing plans, better inventory to name a few. 
---
I agree. Number values are far more useful and intuitive than saying "better, improved, superior, increases, decreases."
---
I have aspergers I need the fucking numbers Goddammit!
---
Atom shop versions are clean, whereas the same outfit that's found in game is dirty. 
---
Did like 20 something at one spot with no performance loss. 
---
It‚Äôs also ok for mole rats/blood bugs/anything that‚Äôs lowish health but come in groups. It‚Äôs not going to thrive as a single target DPS gun.
---
Personally I keep pacifist on anytime I‚Äôm in a nuke so tagging other players is never an issue. Too many people running crisscross patterns when the shooting starts to deal with accidentally flagging pvp every 5 minutes
---
No rush my friend 
---
That would be better for a bio mod. As the main armor mods are meant to be generic.
---
Yeah, that's very true!
---
naw uyielding sent is what I run. I am a pve mostly working on a pvp set as we speak. But yeah stealthboys is what i run in pvp. But when we started the fight it was just me and you really that guy that had the workshop was not doing any thing at all but die.
---
The "selling point" of the Atom Store outfits is that they are clean, untarnished versions of the outfits you normally find in the world.
---
I agree, it isn't much of one.  And I remain convinced that the whole "spring cleaning" premise is to wipe out as many earned Atoms as possible before they alter the rate you can accumulate them.
---
You don't have to leave the area, you just need to give them time to finish.
---
Each time you "dig" you queue up like 10 or more items you just received, and they all have alerts in the top left of your screen.
---
So use like 2 or 3 maps, let it run through all the announcements, then do a few more, etc. If you queue too many it breaks your game, so just gotta go slow and steady.
---
NewtGingrinch ! 
---
Dang sorry brother but the people gotta know. 
---
okay, let me put it another way you pretentious ass...  not everyone is a Major in the military, your original post was hard enough to understand when you use shop lingo instead of talking like a normal fucking human, and this reply didn't help at all, we don't want a war simulator, I don't play Arma because it is too difficult, like I said, if you want a tactical simulator go play Arma, leave Fallout for the casuals who like to build super strong characters and feel like gods, we don't want to squad up and only use military jargon while orgasming to the American Flag.
---
vats sniper build so i always go for it first to get rid of it. always see it giving problems to melee and heavy gunners trying to get it off em. so i see something stretchy like that i usually try to save others from the hassle of trying.
---
Thank you! 
---
I've heard it from other players. It happens right as you go invis. I'm on PC also. Multiple chameleon armors will actually make it beep multiple times.
---
Before I went treasure hunting last week I had somewhere around 200 maps. I often don't have the time to try and locate the treasures because free time is a rarity for me. It was fun though to finally work and try and find the locations marked. I still have a couple in the Divide that I cannot find.
---
Ima join just gimme 1 sec 
---
My house was like an Electrical testing building. Conduit all over, multiple wall pass-throughs, pressure-pad-activated main door, garage door, etc. I'll save your advice for next time I can be bothered building a house. A simple house with shitty standard doors I suppose
---
This is a visual bug only. You will notice that some of the stack will spoil before the rest does.
---
Though from my testing the game will eat the lowest condition item out of a stack regardless of what the condition of the shown(top) item is.
---
To properly test this stack your full &amp; half condition items then do NOT eat any right away or you are just using up the oldest ones. Just wait for the stack to degrade to half condition and you should find the older food has spoiled.
---
I also meant to say...if you get the plans off the fire breather responder.....he is laying on the ground near the east bridge tunnel entrance. You then need to take the plans back to the Charleston fire dept and download off the main computer there. Good Luck and see you Appalachia 
---
Barely makes a difference tbh
---
Added you!
---
You are evil incarnate.
---
legendary glowing, lvl 68 radroach yes plz.. attack speed on those things are ridiculous, if they had higher lvl ones theyd be dangerous. would love to play one to chase players around.
---
or a gutsy with a pop gun.
---
Feel free to pm me with your ign. 
---
Ill friend you and you can try to kill me, smash my camp or run with the bad boys before they make the upcoming changes
---
The trick is that you can bounce the shot off any hard surface, which allows you to hit enemies without having line-of-sight to them.  It also rarely (if ever) misses off a deflected shot. 
---
While this makes it great against flying enemies and turrets, and low-level mobs in general, it shines in tight interior spaces too.  Bounce the shot off door frames, off ceilings, and you can hit practically anything.
---
I just google where they are üòÇüòÇ. 
---
For some reason that just made me think of a laser light show followed by hammering things in the face lol.
---
I‚Äôm excited for the buffs and I‚Äôll continue to use my energy weapons. I have a 3-star mutants explosive Gatling plasma that I got off a melee-build friend and it WRECKS people from medium distances. As a backup I have a 1* each of anti-armor, assassins(I think), furious and two-shot Gatling plasmas. None of them are explosive but I get much more durability with them
---
You're done you've won the interwebs
---
Absolutely put a suppressor on my rifle.  Won't use one without it.  I'm not really trying to do pvp as I'm not good enough to do anything but die a lot?  But I would like to be able to defend myself if I'm attacked.  I'd obviously get killed first, but there's that revenge killing...
---
That's getting fixed this patch! Check out out latest [Inside the Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Pt0vzS8LLqzvSsNw3n98/inside-the-vault-fasnacht-seasonal-event-and-patch-7-preview) for more info. 
---
One of those anti armor magazines also lowers your clip size, but you wouldn't know until you crafted it.. sucks!
---
We got you! That's in the patch :)
---
I hope that‚Äôs not how they do it.  Five people in my house have PS4s.  
---
I run a shotgun build and can confirm that getting ammo for it is a pain in the ass. The additional requirement to get plastic for crafting shotgun ammo is very annoying.
---
You were supposed to drop all conceived notions of greifing, ediquette and raiders then see the post from someone who planned to go to survival and stay there. 
---
My concern is that:
---
 - i will no longer profit from player kills
---
 - I will now have to grind for junk
---
 - It will be more efficient for me to grind on adventure mode, so i plan on doing that (fast travel)
---
This effectively turna survival mode into battle royale with no risk or reward. I want to be in a pvp server where players are carrying junk. 
---
I for one, will never carry junk because i can grab it and stash it in adventure. 
---
Honest opinion from a raider/greifer
---
I‚Äôll have to try it. I have a chameleon piece in my stash. I seriously have never heard this before. Perhaps it‚Äôs tied to sneak ability. I‚Äôm running 23 per and 26 agi. 
---
Non-mongrel dogs show up with the bandana and helmet during the SBQ fights. I feel bad for having to put them down. Same for the megasloths - they just want to sleep.
---
Noodle dogs are the worst adds though.
---
OMG! Can't wait! :)                                                                  ^(I really hope its all of em. Like the ammo bug and the stealth damage bug.) 
---
PS4 my friend, I have now 1 x 2 shot almost fully modded, 1 x junkies gauss, 1 x troubleshooters, 2 x suppressed gauss..I'm desperate for a instigating gauss and or bloodied gauss, I could have bought a berserkers gauss today but decided to buy 2 basic gauss and scrap them for mods to add to my collection..
---
yeah the boss in the pool kitchen pantry is really bad about it, if he comes out into the parking lot his body/meat pile will go back to the floor of the closet, super annoying.   
---
we had one disappear last night and we could not find where his spawn point was in watoga, had found him walking down the street shot him down and vanished just as my buddy saw his inventory and the legendary, before he could grab it.. 
---
I'm wondering mainly crimson but all the average values would be useful
---
Yeah as a melee user i've noticed all the power armor guys wearing this. Sooooooo i carry around an Anti-Armor Dragon with a Vats crit ready just in case. :) 
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Wasn't sure if it was me not having perk cards or the bug. üëç
---
Excellent information my friend. Thank you
---
On average I would say 30 caps each
---
Sacrilege!
---
No problem!
---
Platform?
---
Excellent advice- thank you 
---
Having community zones would really push the social dynamic to levels it can't reach with current gameplay cycles. If we are really going to be the NPCs, it'd be a perfect way to give a lane for that idea to ride in.
---
Just to say it for those that might be confused. The Marine tactical helmet is not the same as the Marine armor helmet. The tactical helmet plans can be found in various spots. The Marine armor helmet has only been found in the dev room.
---
If anyone on PC wants a marine tactical helmet, I can make you one.
---
Random drop from Legendary creatures.  I have been very fortunate with this weapons dropping for me. My first (Vamp Grog W/+40% swing speed ) was dropped at lvl 50 and I was level 48 or so.  I have had 4 drop for me, 2 of which I gave away as they were lvl 45.  I have only recieved them from Bloated Glowing Ones in Whitesprings during a Nuke event, but that's just been my experience. I still carry 2 and am melee build of course, so I really would like to be able to up the repair condition of the axes.  Even with Makeshift Warrior maxed out, they require repair at least once a play session.  Thank you Bethesda for being aware, and thank you Robinson for bringing it up. 
---
All enemies have a predictable routine. This would give some variety and challenge. The video of the guy chasing a legendary deathclaw that ran from him all across the cranberry bog made me think of this. Let the enemy kite the player into more enemies instead of the other way around.
---
I've never noticed that i actually loose fusion cores while using it, unless you mean if i shoot the 54 ammo or whatever it says before you reload. I just reload every time i take it out. Gatling Plasma's have the same issue though. 
---
Thanks Todd, much appreciated 
---
WANT TO PREVENT AN ENEMY FROM FLEEING? CRIPPLE THE LEGS.
---
What‚Äôs your psn
---
Pc
---
I play the game solo in a similar way i play Fallout 3/4/NV and absolutely love the game.  The world exploration and environmental storytelling are top notch. 
---
Thanks Harry, I never considered that 
---
I wont spend the atoms on it, but it is better the pants aint rolled up as far so looks less dorky 
---
Wrecking  a base should reward the wrecker scrap. I should be able to farm bases for wood and steel! Flux from decon showers!
---
Im not starting new. I want my toon and my gear to come with me.
---
I've had good experiences with support. After I replied to the canned email saying it didn't help, I always had a human respond to help me with further steps to pinpoint the problem. They even asked me for a video so they could see what was happening (at which point they found it was user error lol). I never waited more than 24 hours for a response -- usually less than 8-12. Maybe reply again in your email you sent saying that you are following up to get more info.
---
I‚Äôve seen some hanging on power armor stations that look blue/purple until I put it on my frame.
---
Thanks for the advice.  Completed it, with help, got the windmill plan.  Doh!!!
---
Thank you- excellent information 
---
At this point, I can't remember if I bought it from a vendor or found it.  But if I come across another one, I'll try to pay better attention.  
---
Known bug if you did moster mash event you dont get the achievement, atleast what i have seen in past post
---
Pull the gun out, walk around a bit... Don't reload... You'll be at 54/54. After a short while, game will remove one of your cores from your inventory and it will say 54/53...
---
They were duped in huge quantities. Don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt get banned unless you get 100,000 rare ivory grips. 
---
Don‚Äôt know why you are being rude. 
---
I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúengagements‚Äù or ‚Äúsuppression‚Äù are in any way jargon to someone who plays fallout would be not used to. 
---
I‚Äôm only suggesting this for survival. Not the base game. So that people who want a easier game can still find it in the base game. 
---
I thought that having a suppression system would be a good way to balance survival mode with out doing things like preventing damage from a certain distance or reducing the strength of guns overall. 
---
I thought the system would work well in fallout as it allows you to give players who solo a way to fight team players with out reducing fallout to a rust clone in survival. 
---
Suppression is term used frequently in combat situations and thus the brother hood of steel all the way to raiders who find a military manual would use the term and the tactic. 
---
Not to mention fallout already has suppressive weapons in the game and lots of fallout weapons could be seen as squad support weapons. 
---
I do apologize if I used too many big words for you. 
---
^^^im guesingyou didnt pass this on?
---
I tried fast traveling to her when she flew north near Drop Site C-2 and she was actually around but deep underground. The scorched adds would spawn occasionally in that spot and she would periodically shoot sonic screams into the ground.
---
Couldn't kill her like that though.
---
Yes, do go on about your pedestal game.
---
:O thats bad, thats bad, thats really really bad! 
---
glad i normally always reload the second i take it out. good to know. 
---
Or they need a global reset time, like 4pm every day or some such
---
As long as they keep changing and rebalancing stuff, we need the ability to completely respec. 
---
It's nice that you think we don't, but a lot of people think we do, and the current system to move stat points sucks.
---
&gt;Yep I did reply again just yesterday morning thinking maybe it got pushed down or something or perhaps it wasn't properly "escalated". I'm using the support / ticket system on their official website. I'm glad not everyone has had my problem though. Like I said personally I really like the game despite it's launch.
---
Fusion core and ultracite fusion core or if you are brave all ultracite ammo
---
I just updated it to support all the other ammo types now.
---
Yep. Especially ultracite cores... 
---
I honestly think there should just be an option to spend like 5% of your total xp, and it resets you to level 1 with 0 perk cards. Then you just get to re-open your card packs, and manually choose your cards.
---
That, or let us have a couple of different specs, but you have to go to like the science wing in the whitesprings bunker to change specs. 
---
Does your legendary have a bayonet on it?
---
Nope. I didnt even know you could get that mod. Lol
---
Another one tonight..   
---
I forgot how slow the Terminals were to load in FO4!!
---
Wonder if they just had more RAM in Appalachia.. 
---
I have a stronger form of ADHD that makes my brain work almost entirely visually so when I played fallout 4 I ignored the voice lines and I am very happy with Fallout 76s environmental story telling I finally feel like a  game was made for me to understand. So can Y'all stop pressuring bethesda to ruin the one game I have that I can fully understand the story of, thanks
---
Agreed. I mean they already did all the work
---
Tried adding you but says you don't exist. My gt is Newt341 if you still need them.
---
Pretty sure it's been broken and reported as such since early beta.
---
weird, sounds like a bug
---
You call them out on their shit precisely as he did.
---
What platform
---
I recall reading that superior armor penetration is 50%, the others are 40% but I can't provide a link
---
I prefer man-bear-pig
---
It's best when the train station is in the zone if you're trying to make cobalt flux. So, yeah, I'd build back a ways. 
---
Thanks mate, I hate how people are using bloodied weapons to farm caps, I owe you one
---
I have seen them sell for 10k+ caps on the Marketplace. 
---
I prefer to solo. 
---
But I find the tactic not viable. you just get destroyed by groups. 
---
Suppression allows a single player to fight off group players. 
---
By suppressing a group. You can pin them down and force them into narrow paths that are better suited for single players who plan. 
---
I found it too easy frankly to come on with my friends and take a few workshops from solo players despite them laying well thought out traps and turrets. 
---
With out suppression there‚Äôs simply no stopping someone from tanking turrets and fire and letting their team take you. 
---
That shouldn‚Äôt be the case. You should be able to consistently kill team players who just charge you without thinking in survival or else there‚Äôs no point to a survival mode in my opinion. 
---
Fallout lore is filled with lone gunmen setting up traps and turrets defending themselves Alamo style. 
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt know why you are being rude.
---
because I'm sick of dicks like you that get boners for "engagements"...
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúengagements‚Äù or ‚Äúsuppression‚Äù are in any way jargon to someone who plays fallout would be not used to. 
---
I barely know what suppressing fire means, I have no idea what that would look like in a game, even with the example you cited I still have little understanding of what it is you want...
---
&gt; I thought that having a suppression system... 
---
in all your walls of text you still haven't explained what a suppression system is, most of what you type in the post assumes the reader knows what a suppression system is, you cite a game then go into zero detail as if we have played that game let alone know what it even is...
---
&gt; Suppression is term used frequently in  combat situations and thus the brother hood of steel all the way to  raiders who find a military manual would use the term and the tactic.  
---
&gt;Not  to mention fallout already has suppressive weapons in the game and lots  of fallout weapons could be seen as squad support weapons.
---
none of this, and none of what you wrote previously explains what a fucking suppression system is...
---
&gt;I do apologize if I used too many big words for you.
---
or just unrelateable terms you arrogant fuck
---
Haha I love getting replies months later on stuff.
---
It has been a while since I played 76 but yeah I think you might struggle at level 10. From what I remember there's quite a few super muties in there with good sniper positions. If you're a pretty decent melee build with meds to spare you'd be OK.
---
Good luck! Glad to see there's still people new to the game.
---
 long barrel "looks ridiculous" and short barrel with suppressor has too short range? Two things that reduce range combined and you're complaining that the stated effects have combined and have... twice the effect? Just use a long barrel. Math is a thing. And more important to game balancing than your cosmetic complaints
---
Resetting is just an extension of what they've already done pretty much. Wouldn't be that hard of a fix honestly. Don't see why they wouldn't. 
---
I don't have a game like that, and while you are going through my post history with all that free time tell me how many posts = obsessively 
---
That‚Äôs hysterical. I never tried. Just put the guns away and slogged back to Watoga. 
---
Yeah I went in anyway cus I managed to sneak kill a few outside. Then I got rushed by 5 of them inside and died, but... I had my revenge. All good. Thanks for the reply! See u in!
---
Why be informed when you can complain to the void?
---
Or pay more attention than I did.
---
It's not listed when crafting as Combat Rifle, but Short Combat Rifle.
---
Spent days hopping around vendors, before looking down by build list...

I don't know maybe its just me, but it seems kind of obvious the Wastelanders is going to be about people coming in to repopulate a post-Scorched threat WV. That is where new factions and very likely NPCs will come in. I never noticed the person following behind in the back ground. Would be interesting if they gave us companions.
---
Erm, no.. Will stick to FO76 for that ;)
---
I didnt know prostitution was legal in Appalachia!
---
Although I think at least 100 per screw sounds better. I don't do discounts on bulk buys, I got some good quality stuff right here ;)
---
None of the above I have camo paint for my T60
---
I've played every fallout since the first one i-o got in an interplay bundle years ago. Got 3 and 4 on release day.
---
I had planned to buy and play through 76 but only get to buy a couple of games a year now. I was scared because of all of the negative stuff.
---
Is it much better than the news makes it out to be? If so is love to take a dive.
---
Thank you for this!
---
All hail!
---
I use a ghoul slaying one for whitesprings and it works well. I have a troubleshooter one for silos so I can hit gutsies around corners.  They are also great against liberators.  I also use one in the queen event to clear out adds while the queen is flying around.
---
Drops 1* wooden right leg I'm sure
---
This is fun to imagine :p
---
Just found white hat. Psn sneazel
---
Definitely pacifist mode, but I used it for just about everything before I switched from a semi auto rifle build to heavy guns. I just had a normal one with a reflex sight, but it's pretty good against scorched and ghouls that cluster together quickly, because of the chain lightening thing it does. 
---
Yes but it‚Äôs not labeled like other power armor mods. Excavator mods just say the mod. Such as ‚ÄúBlood Cleanser‚Äù instead of ‚Äú X01 Blood Cleanser‚Äù. 
---
Damn I may need to test myself haha
---
Aw man. Well I hope you get some resolution soon. That is a pain.
---
Oh and just don't use it at the whitespring. Easiest way to accidentally agro the robots. 
---
Good doing business with you. Feel free to hit me up if you need anything else.
---
I try to put the noodle dogs out of their stretchy misery, and cry a little inside every time i eat my megasloth mushroom soup :'(
---
Some people, only understand what they directly read not the implied bits behind it. 
---
You mean, if anyone wants to avoid casual PVP, they shouldn't be able to collect a bounty without making themselves vulnerable for 24 hours afterwards? The game has supposed to reward bounty hunters, not punish them...
---
Could never find the pile since I had no idea where he started or ended. 
---
Thanks, if not I'll just make a new characters and make all my friends wear xp perks and carry me haha.
---
Jesus you got some issues. 
---
Yeah okay buddy. I got it. I‚Äôll simplify further. See if I can‚Äôt use crayons. 
---
Hey, I'm just Groggnak, buff me up!
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Energy weapons do get bonuses from perks
---
15 charisma comment right here 
---
I could definitely use it! I want to give it to my little bro so we can play together. 
---
Which train station?
---
Ha! You laugh, but that's me and I only have one character. üôÇ
---
Sounds to me like you would be a prime advocate inside Bethesda to press for a Fallout 3 remaster....
---
Yes; Rifleman, Commando... but not the others.
---
I figured that must be the case. Any links?
---
A noodle thin pile stretched out around cranberry bog
---
totally agreed, honestly I think they should allow us to dye our weapons and armor for free.
---
I've just seen the writing on the wall with Bethesda for too long, they will try and charge you for every thing they think they can get away with.
---
Initially I was also going to try to trade for  those damn sentinel assassin's armor pieces but then realized that with my luck they would end up nerfed right after I get the last piece lol so I just stopped.
---
Btw this is coming from a guy who got his first explosive gun from the queen(TSE 50cal)  two days before the Nerf to TSE weapons.
---
I mean tank kill theoretically should work with the lazer rifle and stabilizers or what ever the heavy weapon perk is for the gatling lazer. I could be wrong but they are still tagged as those types of weapons despite being energy
---
Hello,I will be interested in Marsupial 
---
PSN? I‚Äôm bout to get off 
---
thanks man I had a griefer and his level 200 buddy attacking me with one shot gauntlet hits yesterday.
---
Wish I knew about this sooner.
---
Yeah and Appalachia expands to.....Florida ? Something like that I‚Äôm not geography guy. 
---
Thank you 
---
Thats already part of the game isnt it :P
---

Chameleon effect changes the clickable area in the Pipboy. Be nice to appy an offset, so you can click on actual items/menus, not a little ways off of them, or change the way the effect works.
---
If you are selling 30, I will buy all yours. 
---
I had a 3 star legendary glowing long dog show up during a defense event at Bog Town. I couldn't get a bead on it, so I ended up having to craft 20+ molotovs and chuck them at the ground near where I thought his hit box was. Took a while, but I eventualyl killed him and was rewarded with an Exterminator's pipe revolver or something.
---
People who walk around with 100s of pounds of junk are playing the game wrong anyways. There's a stash cap for a reason.
---
I've suggested the same thing. I wouldn't mind the change from 20 hours to 24 hours if I knew it was happening at a consistent time every day.
---
They're supposedly going to re-visit explosives in a future update but I'm with you, the fatman sux0rz. The MIRV should be cream of the crop explosive wise but I think it probably does less than a plasma grenade. MIRV should be absolute destruction. It should be buffed to god status and then maybe mini-nukes removed and made extremely rare? I know there has to be balance otherwise everyone will just be using fatmans for everything... but so disappointing that the MIRV is so weak. It should be extremely dangerous to everyone and everything near one.
---
Do you have the digital version? 
---
High level players can spawn high level monsters when they pass an area. Generally, the game shouldn't be super tough unless that happens or you try to push into high level areas. The main quest will guide you down this path. Melee is supposed to be very powerful.
---
What, no stalker tire iron?  Disappointing. 
---
Nuke em
---
Having reactive plates takes the place of a jetpack mod, right?
---
Nope it says completed in everything regarding that. 
---
I don't honestly feel like the Atom Store, as it currently is, is setup to milk customers of money. There's very little content on there, most users have 2000+ atom, with very little of interest to actually spend it on.
---
If they really wanted to monetize it, they should fill that thing up with Weapon Skins CSGO-style, Outfits galore etc.
---
how about respawning the unruly golfer feral ghouls at whitespring every hour..... that'd be a nice add on...
---
I‚Äôm in the mids of changing my build so anything extra is worth. 
---
It would. I hate the level scaling in the game.
---
I am having a blast but it is best with Friends.
---
40% and rest are 20%
---
It‚Äôs 2mm because it‚Äôs small enough to hurt more and take a charge. 
---
While u r at it if u purchase something from the vendor there cap count should increase be the amount of the purchase.  Currently it is only increased be how much the good woud be sold for.
---
Add me: Hi Phobos
---
Other than respecs I don't recall them adding any new features yet. It's all been bug fixes, stability enhancements, and balance changes for the last couple months.
---
The first DLC launches on Tuesday and includes a new brewing/distilling crafting station, new quests, etc.  Here's their post with the full roadmap of DLC they have lined up for now through summer.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps
---
I agree, pretty much stick to the left side of the map until you level up a bit to start with. See if you can grab a hazmat suit around lvl 10 and hit the Nuke Zone in White Springs. All you need to do is help tag the nuked enemies to start getting experience. I'd make sure you have pacifist turned on too. Watch your RADS and you'll level up a bit doing that. Keeping working things on the left side and get the Fire Breather quest going. Once you hit lvl 25, you can start to use some of the Power Armor. Also, don't forget to make new/replace armor and weapons when you level up every 5 to 10 levels. You don't want to be a lvl 20 using a lvl 1 weapon.
---
Nah, mate. I sold it weeks ago. Sorry.
---
I feel like every other Wendigo I kill at Whitesprings winds up in the walls.  Also, alliterations are awesome. 
---
They are way heavier than the scrap they produce though. Still worth it when you‚Äôre making the daily rounds near a vendor like in Harper‚Äôs Ferry or Watoga.
---
I didn't tell you to go anywhere. I suggested your mindset is not a good fit for the fiction. In essence I was telling you to lighten up. 
---
Fallout is Raygun Gothic. Whatever real world stuff we've got now is irrelevant. But... if you do want to crawl down that rabbit hole you'll note that I said **hand held** laser weapon. The Navy weapons are ship mounted and able to concentrate a fuckton of power into the laser and (most importantly) focus the beam onto a specific spot on the target for enough time(!) to deliver that power to punch a hole through the surface of the target. These weapons are of dubious use against a target that is actively evading as the beam cannot be focused on the same spot. In our world, a hand held laser pistol/rifle does not exist in the sweet spot of known physics to make it even close to useful.
---
RE: Ski swords: No. Don't even.
---
The bottom line is that Bethesda **failed** to make energy weapons fun or even of interest and a 10% damage boost doesn't change that.
---
Is that why there where a couple of level 20 supermutants in grafton because there was a level 50 player there
---
&gt;it took my handmade from 20 rounds to 10
---
That's the perforating mag, which gives +40% AP but at the cost of a much smaller mag. Stinging mag is a decent compromise at +20% AP (or maybe it's 25%) and 35 rounds.
---
I could use it for a buddy who doesn't have much, his ex took his Xbox. So he is borrowing and would love to play 
---
The only game I‚Äôve seen somewhat incorporate this is LOTRO.  Special zone where you could be a mob. I love the idea.
---
Wait, it specifically mentions semi-auto.. So automatic lasers will still break super fast?
---
r/TalesFromCaveSupport
---
Shad-Gar welcome you
---
The reason it feels like more is because hen you were fresh out of the vault you probably had a handful of turrets, and as you leveled up you realized that they're fucking worthless so you stopped using them and suddenly had more budget to actually build with.
---
So from reading these comments, correct me if I am wrong: once you bulk, you can no longer use the resources, but you can sell it? Correct?
---
Case closed. Pack it up boys, we're done here.
---
Need more or good?
---
Agreed! 
---
I feel like the Enclave are best suited for implants since they're the remnants of the government and would most likely have access to many adv. tech. (The mutation serums is a prime example of this.)
---
From context it‚Äôs obvious ‚ÄúMats‚Äù is a synonym for ‚ÄúJunk Components‚Äù **_but why?_**
---
A reference to Welcome Mats somehow?
---
I will see what I can do for ultracite. Maybe add a 3rd chart below the perk one for one with ultra.
---
Yeah, that could be. Here's a map that shows the area levels.   
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc](https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc)
---
Well, discounting the alien blaster, which afaik is uncraftable, there's only really the flamer and cryolator left. though the tesla rifle being in heavy is pretty dumb, given that it -is- a rifle. The rest of the energy weapon flavours are just mods of the rifles like the laser/plasma scatter and the plasma flamer...and thats pretty much it, i think. literally all of them have been mentioned in this thread. kinda sad, really. 
---
I'll take what I can get I'll still buy some
---
Correct
---
Unfortunately yes
---
&gt;Is that why there where a couple of level 20 supermutants in grafton because there was a level 50 player there
---
Yes, enemies scale to the highest level player in the area, but they're also level capped in the starting areas. The area around the vault caps at around Level 8-10, the toxic valley caps at around 20ish, the ash heap goes up to around 30-40, and the other 3 zones are basically unlocked and can spawn max level (60-90+ depending on the creature) mobs.
---
Thanks, that i'll come in handy
---
Seems too good to be though up on the spot, but I also can‚Äôt imagine having this joke in your back pocket either... *Hmmm...*
---
People also drop bags of loot at the Whitesprings lobby shop - usually where all the workbenches are. Every time I visit, I drop ammo, stims, guns and plans. More times than not, there‚Äôs a bag of loot there when I arrive. Most lower level players avoid me (I‚Äôm only a 137, but still). Dude, don‚Äôt run away, I have stuff you might need! Yeah, we need a ‚Äògrab the damn bag‚Äô or gift emote. 
---
Wow bruh..thank u
---
Whenever I read outstanding, I can't help but hear it in Paladin Danse's Voice
---
My laser rifle has lasted me all day with only needing two repairs. On repeat. Every time I need to use it. 
---
Yeah, Ill be on around then, just hmu
---
Materials.
---
If you want if just find me. It‚Äôs a freebie. 
---
Lol yes to birth drill and microwave.
---
That's why I felt I had to warn people.
---
Yeah the more I think about it the more I agree with that. They even have a blown area of their science wing that would fit. The thing is, I still think Arktos pharma should be part of it. 
---
It seems to be about every 20hrs real time, otherwise quickest way is collecting bulk junk, legendary items and that sort of thing and sell on reddit, but if you want to stay more to just playing the game the vendors are about the only way... everday go into a nuke zone, put on green thumb, get 120 or so nuked flora and sell it, thats the easiest cap grind id say
---
There's another one showing a few others things : https://www.falloutmaps.com/#!/
---
I wish they would fusion them.
---
If you have too many and what to share.....  on PC....
---
Have you tried farming legendaries and selling the better ones on the market76 sub?
---
I doubt the devs are gonna advise on this post tbh, but it‚Äôs a good discussion to have. I‚Äôd rather they didn‚Äôt put your location on the map because then it makes it way too easy for a group of 4 just to ambush you. 
---
I agree junk should be locked on the survival and adventure servers. I think your character should be locked on survival server if you take it over. Someone brought up the fact that it would be too easy to repair your guns and armor in adventure mode and then enter survival mode with nothing to lose. 
---
I don‚Äôt really agree with your idea that you need more incentive to play survival mode other than being able to PvP. We already know you‚Äôll be dropping aid items as well and I thought I heard it will be double the caps lost upon death, if you need more incentive than that idk what to tell you . 
---
Ill take the code for xbox thatd be awesome
---
135 votes friend, I don't think it's representative of anything. 
---
Oh! Makes sense as in ‚Äúbuilding materials‚Äù but wonder where it came from as the term is never used in game AFAIK. 
---
Hmm... ammunition  is a type of military supplies, right?      
---
So it should properly be ‚ÄúMat√©riel‚Äù innit üòÇ
---
I've also stopped scrapping every weapon I come across from dead enemies. I sell those. That's a quick way to burn through vendor caps. Then buy 300-400 cap plans and sell a little more. Or sell all the thousand of radiation drugs you get from ghouls. 
---
It would be awesome to have a mode like the Left 4 Dead game mode of 4 on 4.
---
The survivors tried to get from point A to point B while under attack from hordes of zombies and the enemy team who played as the special infected and could respawn. 
---
Imagine being able to spawn in as a Deathclaw or Super Mutant Behemoth and brutalizing the other team.  That would be hilarious. 
---
You should have received an award for finishing the event. I don't think you get a drop from the SB as well, I never have.
---
Selling duplicate or good legendary items you won‚Äôt use HERE can boost your caps in a hurry. One way I get caps via grinding is head to Solomon‚Äôs Pond, head a short distance south until you get to a pond where a level 50 Behemoth spawns. He‚Äôs worth 15-20 caps and a bunch of scrappable gear, and if you server hop you can grind 300 caps an hour. There‚Äôs also super mutant areas like Grafton Steel and West Tek, where you can accumulate caps, bullets and XP in a hurry.
---
Yeah whats the deal with the perks? I'm maxed out where I can't use some? Or they have to many points on one card and I can't use any of the card with the others, especially the "Luck" column? anymore "Luck" section love in the future would be nice. I agree a revamping should be in the "Perks" i mean works ;)
---
From what I remember (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong):
---
- There is a cap loss on death.
---
- You are able to transfer stuff/characters from SURVIVAL to the MAIN but NOT the other way around. You were able to originally but that cause a bit of a backlash and I believe devs scratched that.
---
- I'm 90% positive about this one, but, I believe you won‚Äôt see other players in the map (possibly to prevent spawn camping or griefing); the exception to this were wanted players, though.
---
Keep in mind I still want to be able to play the game normally and feel immersed but with more tension. I guess we don‚Äôt have the same playstyle because I don‚Äôt really find joy in robbing someone of everything they have ala Ark style.
---
As a side note do you play in a group when you PvP? I think teams should be eliminated in Survival mode if they allow you to see other peoples locations, if they don‚Äôt then I‚Äôm fine with groups.
---
The 200 caps limit is per 20 hours and server hoping doesn‚Äôt refresh as the 20 hour wait is tied to you. Cap stashes also don‚Äôt refresh if your server hop and are now instanced containers so as there are 7 different vender factions sharing 200 caps each I sell 1400 worth of bulked junk, excess meds etc each day and while visiting them I stop at cap stashes along my route with the perks fortune finder and cap collector, I also kill the graffton monsters at Charleston and graffton as they drop caps as so some of the charred gouls at whitesprings. Handing in technical data at camp Ventura if your passing will also get you 25 caps each time and killing supermutants especially behemoths gives caps. To rack up excess chems for sale to vendors I use the pharma pharma perk. Also try not to fast travel if possible but if you do use the travel agent perk to cut the cost.
---
Yes, happened to me last night during the SBQ fight. Sucks. Spent all that time launching a nuke, fight the hordes, and receiving absolutely nothing for it. I was able to rejoin the server because I was on a team, but didn‚Äôt get any loot. It‚Äôs disheartening and BGS should do something about. The silver lining is that FO76 is fairly new, compared to ESO, and I really do believe that as time goes by FO76 will only get better. I‚Äôm hoping the RNG Gods will reward me the next time I fight the Queen. 
---
Yeah, i kept running into level 40 and up as a level 20 and after i learn about this, i began server hopping until i see lower level monsters. 
---
If you didn‚Äôt call for the drop you become wanted for opening it but if you wait for it to be opened then you are fine
---
I feel like it has to do with the game engine but idk. That rag doll effect has been a part of every fallout game I‚Äôve played,  fallout 3 and onwards. 
---
This wasn't an event, just a random encounter. Maybe that was the issue.
---
What do the numbers on row 2 mean?
---
There is also something to be said for pacing new content.  I'm looking at this game being around 10 years.  (I've noticed I get fewer down votes and negative comments for stating that then I did a month ago btw). So many good ideas in this sub that can find there way into the game at some point, but would create a mess if we got everything we asked for at once.  Throw it on next year's roadmap.
---
Is there another subreddit for selling stuff? I accumulated A TON of legendary weapons when I was grinding Whitesprings for XP back in the day. I sold off pretty much everything, but it doesn't take long to acquire some good stuff that would probably sell. 
---
The only weapon I'm still looking for is the elusiveTSE Rifle but I don't want to buy one. I want a drop! Sad story time: When the game first launched I had my first character and I didn't like the build at all so I scrapped it. I had 2 TSE rifles but they were level 35 I think? I guess some weapons get capped at certain levels and don't reach 50 so I didn't care to save them because I thought they were under-powered. I still have nightmares. 
---
I kill the robots so I don‚Äôt have to hear serve and protect 1000 times 
---
An actual lockpick would be nice. Unbreakable. Running out of Bobby pins seems unlikely, anyway. I miss the system in Oblivion. 
---
Do you perhaps know where to get more stimpacks because i can't find any no matter where i look and i always seem to run out
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre talking about Sunnytop station up in the NE of the map
---
Oh OK, mine were the Air Support or some such event.
---
2X harvest perk and somewhere with a lot of blackberries like the federal disposal near the R&amp;G station. Sell them with grape mentats and you'll hit the 10K achievement as fast as the vendors refresh caps 
---
The Wendigos always put on a show just for you when they ben defeated lol.
---
I've got some too, if you still want more.
---
I keep playing 76 to ensure annoying little worms like yourself can keep making these useless posts. 
---
"Oh look at me, I'll make a snarky title about how bad this game is, pose it like it's a question, then when people answer I'll tell them how wrong they are, and if they have more intelligible answers than I do, I'll call them a cunt....... I'm so clever and smart"
---
I'll also still pay
---
Yeah, I know what you mean. But I have been seen many video games in these last few years depending on Ragdoll effects. It would be nice to have an animation instead. They are more interesting.
---
No problem
---
Yes. Do go on describing the difference between how established a decade+ old game is vs a 4 month old game. 
---
Awesome comparison bro.
---
Ive wanted fallout 76 for some time now my friend has been begging for me to buy it but i dont have the money right now. He got it for christmas but hasnt touched it at all because he wants someone to play it with. It would be really kind of you OP if i could get it. Thanks
---
IGN is same as here, add me and join me on my server (I'm teamed and don't want to relog).  I'll meet you at Vault 76 if that's okay with you.
---
thank you!
---
Aaronholt homestead; there is a locked shed in the south eastern end that regularly spawns t60 power armour. Never a full suit though. Most spawns I have seen there range from level 30-50.
---
Longdog the most op legendary
---
Some people are also coherent enough to pose a question, and respond in context. Apparently not you though, you go the route of:
---
"Why do you still play the game?"
---
"You're wrong, let me reiterate my experience for the 89th time, even though the question posed was about why OTHER people are playing"
---
You chose your perks poorly. Time re roll like a man.
---
LosXorbos 
---
Yeah I agree with you but I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll be able to fix it without making changes to the physics of the game and that could cause something else to break. I like that if you‚Äôre a carnivore you can execute players by eating them, I think that should be a part of normal gameplay too somehow.
---
It is instanced so it should be available for other players. 
---
Always knew fallout 76 would be great in the future, now Bethesda is teasing me with the 100 day roadmap
---
This I totally agree with.
---
Hope indeed.
---
I would give that a try.  been looking for player made factions that sort of run that set up.  I love fallout lore and this game has a decent chunk of it hidden away.  So someone else into that would be fun to play with.  Add me on xbox IGN TheTommyBear
---
Damn man you are one salty mother fucker. Seek help.
---
You need the map to get the reward tho
---
Stretchy Dogs are a common occurrence at the Red Rocket Mega Stop.
---
And i constantly sell them.
---
I have that perk that make me able to "search" medical containers. On xbox you would press Y to loot one item at a time, the perk make me able to hit A and a sound play if lucky and a stim or some other thing get added. It can be done before or after looting.
---
Now, the medical containers are most of the time a white box on a wall. There's a lot of them around Flatwoods and the nearby farm in each barn near the door inside. One can also find them at the Morgantown airport and maybe Arktos pharma.
---
What level does the search perk have to be i only have it level 1 and it only lets me search ammo boxes
---
My xbox tag is Deathdime, I'm adding you now.
---
I won't speak for everyone, but I care immensely.
---
The fact that I'm trying to be an energy weapons caravaneer, and its a product no one wants, plus I can't even use them particularly well because they suck? It's a major issue.
---
My options are either a lead pipe or a military crafted energy rifle and every instance ever the lead pipe will out damage the rifle and be more threatening in general.
---
I get some folks don't care, but they also won't care if it does get balanced if that's the case, anyway, since its already so inconsequential to them.
---
If you can, can you make the first column frozen? that way when people scroll right, the name of the ammo is always visible?
---
I have two X01 chest plates one with jetpack one with reactive.
---
Why on earth would it have a different name?  
---
and NV built improvements off of 3's mod community. 
---
Well, what would you rather be hit with, a nuclear bomb or a sledgehammer? The choice is obvious.
---
I wish they would have not "fixed" it so it would not reflect back on the slap damage. It was the quickest way to get those fuckers to leave you alone when they one shot them selves. The correct fix for it should have been the player that was attacked did not get a wanted bounty.
---
Well actually... The game was intended to be very violent and gory if you have seen the Fallout 76 trailer just to water it down but its whatever lol.
---
It grows back very quickly, but you cannot harvest it twice, it will give you the option, but nothing happens. 
---
I thought it was like any other world spawn in that once you take it nobody else can, but since it grows back so quick it doesn‚Äôt really matter.  
---
The perk for ammo is, for ammo. I'm not sure of english name of the other perk. Pharma farmer maybe. I think it's in the Int category, not sure. I should check in game...
---
Take some molotovs down to whitesprings, go hang out by the golf club. No doubt someone will be running it, toss the molotovs and make sure you hit as many as you can. Let the bigger people do the dirty work. You'll get armed quick.
---
Gotcha, well that's helpful.. I just wish the game said anything about that, at all, when crafting.. it's onto guess work, or google searching to figure it out. 
---
Energy rifles don't benefit from Tank Killer at all because it lowers a resistance to a damage type energy weapons don't deal, and there's no perk that equates to Tank Killer for energy weapons.
---
They also don't have any particularly good legendary attributes that aren't just better on ballistics besides maybe like a bloodied splitter, and that's an extremely nuanced occasion and only good for PvP for about 4 seconds before it breaks.
---
Ah so it's two different perkcatds, thanks i'll keep my eye open for that one
---
Which one are you talking about?
---
They're tagged as those weapons but don't gain any of the benefits due to their damage type~
---
I can do that but it kind of doesn't look vary good when I do.
---
legendaries
---
Of course the Amish-of-gaming are hard to understand! Who buys an MMO to be anti-social when there are numerous retro titles that cater to that like Don't Starve!
---
If you just organized 12v12 workshop PVP on reddit there wouldn't be griefers because they'd be too busy competing, it's elementary! Save the official forums for the whining!
---
OH MY GOD!
---
I thought i was the only one that'd seen the sentrywings with the light and explosion!   
---
I thought the lights would still be glowing after killing it so I didn't take a pic.
---
At least you get the games bad.
---
i have unwanted legendaries that i get almost every play session ..are u ps4?
---
It is 200 Caps every 20 hours per Faction.    
---
Purified Water sells for 4 caps per.  Just build a base with a bunch of Water Purifiers.
---
I‚Äôm on pc 
---
Ruining the game experience?  Wow, that‚Äôs rather extreme.
---
Except for bomb berries I found
---
No ones there rn. Do you have any spare weapons? I‚Äôll pay. 
---
u can live vicariously thru the posts on here..and yes i agree the addiction is real..after the TSE nerf i was salty and i took a break for 4 days and then *POOF* im back to making glowing fungus soup
---
No one likes eating them. It would be much better for them to be perk card inspired after collected, rarer to find, a real accomplishment to gather / curate. 
---
Really? I haven't used a chem since like level 10. They're good for selling though. 
---
yea
---
reddit
---
There are so few details but if friendly fire is on for everyone teams won't mean as much!
---
Maybe it would be more fun if we figured out the rules for ourselves? Beth didn't specifically tell us how to activate the new PVP mode for workshops (touchpad menu option), it was alright.
---
Why u ruin the clock system for me ;_;
---
 where can i locataions
---
Every game I always used Mats short for materials.  It just became a habit for me from older games.
---
I copied your spreadsheet to do that, and ya that fat bar going down the side and cutting through text is UGLY... but it's so useful...
---
It also appears to not show the name of its legendary effect anymore when it drops. If an enemy has one in its loot it just shows ‚ÄúGrognak Axe‚Äù without the prefix.
---
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
---
It's not bad. 
---
It has flaws. Most games do. 
---
Since I'm not in a rush to sink 300 hours into 76, the end game content issues are a non issue for me. New content will drop soon, which means I'll likely never run into a content wall.
---
I play on PS4.. and my son has an Xbox and only play fortnite. While I don‚Äôt want him to spend much on electronics but I would like him to try fallout so we can have something common to speak about in the virtual world. 
---
Just fixed it on mine you can check it out.
---
Making the 1400 caps you get from the responder vendors, raider vendors, enclave vendors, whitespring vendors, watoga train station, watoga proper vendor, and that place in the mire, whatsitcalled, is super easy and you can do it by selling useless legendaries you get from farming whitespring nuke, or glowing blood and ionized meat from nuking whitespring, or you can farm stimpacks by farming ticks, or you can just play the game and gather junk and sell your junk.
---
Super easy. I got the plans to an old timey outfit that costs 5 cloth and 1 gold to make that i can sell for 25 caps so I'm set.
---
AFTER THAT earning caps is super hard. You can put on the caps detector perk and the caps magnifier perk and chase after those. Or you can farm super mutants, they shed caps when they die sometimes. Or you can chase after events that award caps at the end, although those seem to die out after awhile. I spent a couple hours farming super mutants today and got about 300 caps. Tedious.
---
The mirv mod I think is buggy, depending on server lag half of the minis blow up at your feet. Mod it to a standard fatman and it's a pretty great weapon I carry 2 of them.
---
It would definitely have to be optional. Might be nice to have a gender voice changer since most female characters that I come across sound like linebackers aka are dudes.
---
No definite location that will drop bloodied weapons, the best way is to purchase one. The price has dropped, if you look around you can get a decent weapon for 3 - 5k if on xbox &amp;  also depending on how rare it is.
---
If its camp plans youre after, id recommend claiming and defending workshops.  Was faster and more enjoyable than cap grinding for me, aptjough you can do that in parrallel.
---
IVE BEEN THINKING THIS SINCE DAY ONE
---
Kill other players.
---
I'm not good with sarcasm.
---
There is no way they didn‚Äôt explore the idea internally. With the loot being server based I‚Äôm guessing there are technical limitations. 
---
That‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt pick certain stuff up. I thought it was lagging and I got mad
---
:(
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt have the belief that anything said at this point will effect what‚Äôs being released. I was just responding to a couple of the OP points because I think they‚Äôve been covered by forums posts from BGS for the most part.
---
Tbh maybe I‚Äôm just a salty guy but no one should need more motivation to play survival mode if they want to PvP. The PvP is the motivation, it seems the OP has gotten used to ambushing people who do not want to PvP and taking all their junk for fun which I don‚Äôt really respect, but hey that‚Äôs just like my opinion man. 
---
Tips:
---
* Run Fertile Soil every time it pops up. It only takes like 5 minutes, you get a nice assortment of junk/chems, a decent chance of getting a level 5-10 legendary weapon or armor piece, and a couple hundred easy XP.
---
* Run Powering up Poseidon every time you see it. Between killing level 1-6 scorched and completing the event you'll probably earn 1000+ XP in 20-30 minutes. Plus, you'll learn ever single mod for the hunting rifle, 10mm, and pipe weapons from scrapping all the weapons from the scorched.
---
* After you complete the powering up event, capture the workshop. You get a couple hundred XP for claiming it, and a couple hundred more for completing the defense event that pops up a couple minutes later. For that matter, claim every available workshop in the forest and do the defense event. It opens you up to PvP, so don't bother putting too many resources into building on it in case you need to server hop and avoid  a high level hunter coming after you.
---
* Every time you see a "horde event" in the forest spend the money to fast travel to it. They almost always have a level appropriate legendary mob at the end. I ran one last night on my level 12 character and got a 2* level 10 two shot plus faster reload speed hunting rifle that should serve me well for quite a while.
---
* If you see Leader of the Pack appear by the county fair grounds spend the money to go do it. It's 3 waves of 5-7 wolves and guarantees at least one (sometimes 2 or 3) level appropriate legendaries. 
---
Beyond that, just kill everything you see.
---
I didn't bring it up, which is very clear and visible....
---
I've only found one Bloodied weapon. 
---
A bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. It was at the whitesprings vendor. I assume a player sold it there?
---
Still using that thing.
---
People down voting know a real engineer build would decimate their current strats
---
:P
---
If it was a nuke-card carrying cargobot it always shows as ‚Äústealing.‚Äù  I *think* all taggers can get the card. 
---
I loved her voice and voice acting but disliked her personality and quests
---
nuke the whitespring, farm farm farm legendaries til you get lucky
---
When I had a ton of sugar since it never spoils I put it on hotkey and run around the map like the roadrunner (time it right and you can sprint pretty consistently, probably easier on pc).
---
Just pick a staple food and drink or soup for both, hotkey, and top it up every few minutes.
---
It's less bad now.
---
It has no end game, that isn't a flaw, that's almost not even a game.
---
You play slowly or just got it, lucky you.  
---
This ^
---
Way more fun than server hoping to farm gear to sell for caps. 
---
Go over to the Marketplace.  You can usually find 1* bloodied weapons for around 500 caps. 
---
What's even the point of this caps limit? Is it adding something beneficial to the game, or preventing some kind of exploit? 
---
I think this happens with dogs in general. There's a dog on the cliffs across the river from Harper's Ferry (his owners are lying dead up there, poor little feller), but I have a CAMP near there and often see his stretchy head wiggling around.
---
The person wasn't responding to my points or sharing what was keeping them playing, also my posts question.
