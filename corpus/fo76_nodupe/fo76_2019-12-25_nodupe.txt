What platform are u on?
---
---
---
Just let loose a bunch of Dogs; junkyard, mongrel and Mutant Hounds, that will follow you and you can dismiss them to your CAMP
---
100% have to agree with you on this one.
---
Just like why blame Hitler for the atrocities of WWII, it was obviously the shitty ass soldiers who were at fault for it.
---
RIP you ever playing again. Fix one thing, break two others seems to be the modus operandi for FO76.
---
Are they just plain flat/metal letters or neon light letters?
---

---
And yes, the building budget is a pain - maybe I should write that on the wall if I buy them and my limit permits...
---
It’s a requirement
---
Can't wait for those 500 atoms, oh boy.
---
I mean sure you need to process it with acid, but half the bugs in the game drop it, a mess of assorted things contain it, and if you can't be arsed with that, there's a fantastic water spot with an acid vein.
---
Considering the compensation to people who lost their stuff to scrap boxes and vault raids you’re post is asinine.
---
Same.
---
I was talking about the hackers not  Bethesda 
---
it is  vandalism and a  federal offence if  you insert  unwanted code in to a private computer
---
people have been already jailed for that
---
look up  the law it does not apply to US government computers but private as well
---
Man...I keep my plasma fed and that's only used for queen fights. To much weight.
---
Its a shitty way to prove a point. Prople that hate FO76 seem to be taking it personally.  They should probably find better things to do with their time.
---
It is a visual glitch you still get stuff just didn’t appear in the corner. Probably got some coal and alchol with a mounted blood bug plan.
---
I'm on and will be for a bit
---
Yeah happens to me after a while too, but you’re still getting the rewards just not the notifications. Check for new plans.
---
I hate to break it to you but the state of 76 isn't the norm for online games buddy...
---
When people come out Vault 76 I give them a jar of it as a Welcome To Appalachia Gift. What are neighbors for right?
---
Wait,
---
Huh?
---
Ok, what the fuck is the internet?
---
If the game were broken people wouldn’t play.
---
It’s a mess but it ain’t broken.  Particularly on consoles where the hacks can’t be used.
---
I totally agree. Regardless of all the crap this game gets and not to mention the bug’s.. I end up playing Fallout 76 almost everyday..
---
Your analogy is a bit excessive. Nobody has ever landed a human on Mars, but tons of people log into private servers all the time.
---
The problem isn't that hackers have to discover some brand new technology here, they simply have to find a way to convince a server to do something it is already equipped to do and actively allows authorized people to do constantly.
---
Hackers aren't trying to invent a rocket to Mars, they're simply trying to spoof a boarding pass to one.
---
This is a filthycasual worthy post. I had to double check where I was.
---
Good on you, fellow vault dweller. Good on you.
---
you...you called me your buddy.
---
*sniff*
---
Merry Christmas everyone, see you in WV! :)
---
Yes.
---
no they havent been fixed yet
---
Yes.  I came back a month and a bit ago (maybe 2 months but I was away for 2 weeks and did not play).
---
I enjoy it...BUT...there isn’t any more to do than their was before outside of vault raids, some new minor quests, and buy stuff from player vendors.
---
I find it more engaging than it used to be but if I were you I would wait for wastelanders...or come back now with a new character and new build and hopefully have wastelanders released when you finish your character build.
---
Yeah, I just experienced this while opening 20 gifts of various different types. I wasn’t paying attention to the unlocked stuff until about half way through. Cacked myself lol.
---
Oh no shit!?
---
I got selected to beta test YEARS ago! I had to send them a Dxdiag TXT file and then got selected and had to pay for shipping for like 4 discs I think. I was pretty fucking stoked and in 2002(ish) MMO's were the "It" thing at the time.
---
merry xmas everyone 
---
despite the games many problems earlier 
---
For the most part i had fun
---
Merry Christmas :)
---
Downvoted for misinformation. They have been fixed.
---
Yes, it was fixed yesterday in a hotfix.
---
I was a MUD player myself. God I still miss MUDs to this day...
---
Kids have no idea man...
---
Agreed, had that happen to me a few times.  The items definitely got delivered (I checked to be sure), so it's just a display error.

Rip bonfire I never got (and the rare masks)
---
No daily script limit when scrapping legendaries
---
My money back ,...😂
---
1. Build your character appropriately.  I use a bloody build with all unyielding armour and even though I only put 1 point into strength in stats I have 15+ at all timeouts in my pipboy.
---
2. Pick a weapon, pick an ammo type, use only those.  MAYBE have a melee weapon on hand...as it is I walk around with thousands of round 45 ammo and still have less than 100lbs of carry weight on me.
---
3. Aid items, don’t carry surplus...I’m a stealth commando, I have at most 10 of each on me (and only the diluted forms for me).  Same for food and purified water...that’s easy for me to say with four industrial water purifiers, vegetable starch farm and constant spawn of 3 mongrels behind my camp...so food and water aren’t an issue for me.
---
Bonus points for carnivore mutation as you can kill and eat on the run...double bonus for cannibal perk I guess? Lol
---
4. Armour.  Don’t carry any more than you wear UNLESS you find a legendary or doing a scrap time run for steel (same with weapons).
---
Try and get armour that has reduced carry weight effects (I think these are the third star on three star legendaries...if not, they are still helpful in the absence of increased AP regen and poison resist).
---
5. Misc, make sure you’re not lugging around hundreds of pounds of gunpowder and ore.
---
6. Junk.  Always break it down and stash it as soon as you can.  If you don’t have FO1st try and have only 100 of most resources (some you don’t really need at all like bone) and only 500 max.
---
It’s not that hard to not be over encumbered.  As I said I usually have less than 100lbs on me fully stocked and even though I only have 1 point in strength and don’t wear power armour I can carry 300lbs, even more with food bonuses (like from radstag steaks for the sample).  Or chems if needed, but I always forget to use them and just end up selling them instead.
---
Fun fact about social security numbers
---
First 3 were area, next two were group which is roughly time, and the next 4 were sequential!
---
Notice that "were"? Well that was the case until 2011
---
Yes that's right if you were born before 2011 you can add or subtract one from your SSN and have another valid SSN!
---
That means your credit card number is more secure than your SSN; there's a reason the original ones said not for identification purposes
---
I wanted an outfit of Antlers, Backpack and Mrs. Claus.
---
As these were all separate for "one week only" over 3 weeks I have not purchased the first 2 as they wouldn't be used without all 3. Luckily they released Mrs. Claus today but as I didn't buy the first 2 items during their single week available I will also not be buying this week &gt;\_&gt;
---
I know. I've been world hoping for 3 hours and nothing. :(
---
Eh, Booby Pins are not available in great enough quantity, nor have enough usefulness to ever be a viable currency.
---
My Man U did it, good way to kick or the Xmas carols
---
They are able to be traded in game which I thought was pretty cool.
---
No
---
Merry Christmas folks!
---
Absolutely. Should at least be purchasable in atoms or earned from a backpack type quest
---
Worth playing: yes.
---
Game breaking bugs: not in my experience and I’ve had it since the Beta on PS4 (but did put it down for like 6 months when the only thing left to do was kill bloated ghouls at white springs...actually I just didn’t play video games at all during that time due to a lovely bipolar depression episode).
---
That said, people DO experience game breaking bugs.  I experience minor bugs like dead scorch beasts and government air drops following me around on the map from time to time, as well as not being able to consistently swap between weapons...BUT I haven’t had any of the major bugs hit me.
---
Yes, but beth is pretty dopey not advertising the fact.
---
 I run a Plama Puker I love. A Pistol Flamer with a Gamma Cap for mo burn. 
---
 Above Harper's Ferry there is a real nice Copper Patch with 4 or 5 patches. I pull around 40 with the Excavator on. There's Gold, Silver and a fair bit of Aluminum in the little cave just below that. I have my Survival Camp there. ;)
---
Unlimited ammo storage would be nice.
---
Atom store discounts?
---
Cap limit increase? (35-40k/char?)
---
100lb shared stash for all characters on the account?
---
5% exp and gold bonus? (Although this might be considered P2W moreso than the others)
---
Also like the idea of "no daily scrip limit" or even increased daily scrip limit mentioned by another user as well.
---
I think they will place them when Chinese New Year come.
---
cool camp. BLow away some noobs and build in flatwoods
---
Yes. They bring it back after one year.
---
I only just yesterday day hit lvl 100. And most of my quests are complete. After the TSE nerf there were a lot of balance changes, everything feels much more balanced in PVE now. I personally use a Junkies Lever Action and I have 5 addictions. It does an amazing damage. I'm not liking everything in one shot now like the TSE Pre-Nerf but it does feel more balanced now. Every enemy is not a pushover anymore and it has brought the challenge back into the game. I used to never use Power Armor but now I use it religiously and really like. What system do you play on?
---
imagine saying only a small number of players have been affected when 1 person alone did it to 500+ people.
---
Simple, put some kind of per item limit cap on the free scrapbox vs. an infinite cap 1st scrapbox
---
If someone tries to put any amount over the item limit into the free scrapbox it just overflows to their stash box. What should the limit be? don't really care, make it 400, 600, 1000... as long as it's a fixed amount vs. infinite amount it should be fine.
---
An Aid box
---
Which is what makes them perfect for a second currency, the scarcity. I'm not saying a 1:1 cap exchange, but more like a 1:5 ratio. You can buy Bobby pins from vendor bots at 9 caps each.
---
There other secret is that they weigh nothing, are pretty liquid, and have held a consistent value, so they can be used as a store of wealth to bypass cap limits (similar to 556 ammo).
---
i honestly wouldnt like it for the fact that would make the game way too cheesy...the game is already a softcore walk in a park "survival" game and since launch it only got easier...as someone who owns F01st i think inventory management gives more depth than just mindless scavenging and hoarding of mats...it also makes scrap more valuable
---
Just keep giving them fancy exclusive cosmetics. Like the nuka lamp.
---
Have some humor, brother.
---
Me no play buddy to much bug me play when fix buddy me no fix me no problem Bethesda problem buddy Bethesda fix me no fix .
---
On the Bright Side, you guys managed to make a hell of a Wasteland of a game.. Thumbs up!
---
Because we own the game and want it to be as good as it should be. Are you seriously suggesting people should only come here if they want to suck Bethesda and FO76's dicks?
---
Ability to scrap ammo.
---
Here’s my take on it. 
---
**Standard**: Gets the TENT as is (*like I wanted it to be in the first place, Bethesda, not behind a paywall*). Scrap Box available for CAMP/Workshops. 1000 lbs Stash. 
---
**FO1st**: TENT has a bed, not a sleeping bag for Well Rested instead of Rested, and also a Station to manually scrap non-auto scrap items (but no repairing) like weapons/armor/beer bottles.
---
2000 lbs Stash. Plus all the other stuff like the Private World, etc.
---
It won't happen. Inventory management is a deliberate pain point, so developers can sell a subscription to overcome the problem they wanted us to have. The scrapbox is the main selling point of fallout 1st, so giving it to everyone will reduce subscriptions.
---
However I hope I'm wrong. Of all the many problems with the game, the thing I find most distasteful is that some players can store unlimited resources; I consider the scrap box to be at the soft end of P2W, and P2W games don't last.
---
They genuinely think this 1week only exclusive approach is the best method to get people to buy the items.. sure if your rotating a small shop of around 6-10 items at most like Fortnites.. but the Atomic shop is basically Amazon for Fo76.. just have everything on there and you will undoubtedly sell more of each released item over time 🤷‍♂️
---
 Merry Vaultmas from me and my humongous atom shop tree in a trash can that I can’t decorate.
---
Do what I do and AFK naked in a bush. People often walk right past me. 
---
If playing Morgantown, spawn above the "S" in University, a few bushes you can sit in, can also wedge between a shrub wall and wooden barricade. 
---
For Flatwoods, south west of the overseers camp where the map color changes from green to tan, tons of thick shrubs.
---
Got about 120 to 300+ xp per game, depending on how long the storm takes to kill me.
---
yes definitely, ive been playing all week leveling up my first pc character think the game crashed 2 times over the last week vs 3 time i had on xbox the week before.  the youtubers need views so they exaggerate like crazy. i played for a bit then took a break and came back a month ago and played since on both versions
---
Congratulations! You've reposted a definition that you don't even understand, and then claimed victory! Poor attempt at a troll 0/10, please stop detracting from the actual issue and crying for attention and internet points. Thanks.

Can we have extended event :(?
---
And they are anything but giant. They are about the same size as the neon
---
Of course, dude. It's Christmas. Take them all.
---
Yes. This.
---
I mean sure probably. I don't have the time to troll people in fallout 76 but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit disappointed that when Bethesda finally did what I've been wanting since they released Morrowind, ie online multiplayer, it turned out to be a bit crap. Between mobile game levels of microtransactions and what appears to be the laziest game ever made I can't say I'm all that saddened that the game also includes cheats on this level without the ability to host your own server.
---
this made me laugh lol
---
Fast travel to Kiddie Korner Cabins in the Toxic Valley, then head east. There's usually an entire heard of them in the next valley over. That's where I got this today.
---
I disagree for all the reasons I listed
---
If you're gonna irrationally blame the YTers who made videos warning people about this hack then make sure you blame all of them not just the one you dislike.
---
And to you
---
biggest thing id wanna see is cross platform saves, or at least atom shop and fallout first

The game, without bugs, is fantastic. What we got is something different.  The crashing, server lag, half-broke game mechanics, and cheating/hacking  makes this game a mediocre game experience on PC without a  1st sub. That's where PC is going to end up. Die hards will just pay for a sub and play FO4 style in FO76 with friends and ignoring the public servers because there are too many cheats, swindlers, and simple bullies trying to ruin the game for their own personal vendetta (or they are just asshats) against FO76.  I used to like buying from player vendors, now I just avoid player vending -- too many swindles or death-trap merchants to make it worth it anymore. The bad guys won the public server war and own that territory. BGS is to incompetent and helpless to stop them. I'm still playing and enjoying the game, but find less reason to leave the private servers nowadays.
---
🙄
---
They did initially offer a discounted exclusive skin... but people freaked the fuck out over it so it turned into getting free shit every month instead.
---
It was the reskins for the ranger armor, initially came out at 300 atoms I think which is "cheap" for a helmet and outfit.  But people started screaming about how they deserved the reskins for free and given the sensitive subject of 1st at the time Bethesda relented and changed it.
---
I bought 4 of the ones I was missing (missing all of them XD) from a guy's vendor for 1000 caps each after he bought some stuff from mine.
---
Man I would love to clean out my mules.
---
There's usually a glowing one at the Pylon Ambush Site down in the mire, when the Cryptid event isn't happening. That's where I got it.
---
Yeah I would cancel my sub if they made it available to everyone. I really only use the private world to swap items between my characters.
---
So don’t spend multiple days to grind for a cosmetic item.
---
I'd get Fallout 1st if the scrap box and the tent were available to everyone (as they affect gameplay), and if buying Fallout 1st gave you private worlds (which understandably has to be paid for), exclusive cosmetics, and nothing that changes gameplay.
---
They got part of it right, it's just that scrap box and tent being behind a paywall that I don't like. See, the thing is, before the beta they said that when you scrap junk, it becomes weightless. Then they changed it for server stability. That's no biggie. That's even fine if it's just a game design choice. Then came the scrapbox. They created a problem to later sell you the solution.
---
But mostly, I just have a problem with non-cosmetics being sold, I don't care how over or underpowered the thing in question is.
---
So what you're saying is you just don't have a fucking clue about how the sale tab works.
---
They haven't been forgetting shit, each day one of the listed items is discounted.  Right now there's no item on sale likely because the santatron is also being listed in the same tab and the system is likely "discounting" the free item and just not displaying it, once the clock ticks over tomorrow one of the bundles listed should be up for sale and then the next day the next and then maybe since there's only the two it will rotate.
---
It's the same fucking way the sale tab has always worked, it displays up to seven items and then each day through the week a different one gets a sale price applied.
---
Sprinting uses up AP. 
---
AP maximums and refresh rates are governed by Agility.
---
Just gave away my last level 5 legendary weapon. Saved vampire/furious/instigating and quad (which I fully pimped) for xmas giveaway to noobs. About 15 happy noobs.
---
You don’t know it’s the programers. It could be product and QA.. devs make what they’re told to make. The real question should be, how did this pass code review, QA, product acceptance, security, etc.
---
What does Endurance control then?
---
Same ! I bought everything else last Christmas except the one bundle with the radstag in it :( ..... Was expecting it to show up this week.
---
I am a huge Fallout fanboy. I got to 76 later than most. But, it's unique in it's story. Even if it's shitty, i love it. I could spend countless hours playing it. I will continue to enjoy it until the servers go down. And I'll always appreciate the people i play with.
---
I'll even say i appreciate the developers and such. Because, if not for them, i would not have met some of the cool people i play with.
---
So, regardless of all the shit that came with the game, I'm glad for the people and the experience. It's shown us that a mmo is not for fallout. (In my opinion.)
---
So is safe play atm?
---
So this is about ease of use in world creation, that's basically the reason stopping Bethesda from using any other engine? The problem seems to be that they didn't invest enough time/resources in updating the engine so it would be on par with regard to performance and level of detail compared to other games in 2018/19 (eg. RDR2). They needed to cut corners, as directed by management.
---
Of Course! Month 13 and rocking an awesome base, great weapons, armor and costumes. She's a flawed bitch but she still makes me come back for more.
---
You could try to go into camera mode, Idk if is would work
---
Had it happen to me, I literally teleported 15 times all across the map until I inevitably just close the game and it fixed its self.
---
Health and environmental resistances.
---
Merry Christmas! Keep playing. Hope we run into each other naturally :)
---
Are you on xbox buddy?
---
If you're running the Ratmonkey's Easy Sorting &amp; Tagging mod, it needs to be updated every time the game updates. Alternately, you can just rename the strings folder in the \\Bethesda.net Launcher\\games\\Fallout76\\Data folder which will disable whatever text string mod you're using, but it will get rid of that Lookup Failed! message.
---
Psychedelics last for about 8 hours, buckle up for the ride.
---
So is it safe to say you are not a fan of people roleplaying as Darth Vaper?
---
But if you think the unlimited scrap box and forward tent should be in the base game, even if they're unlocked via quests like the full size backpack is, they call you the greedy one...
---
he's the only one I saw advertise it to millions of ppl
---
16 times the- Aww, that was the Nukashine talking.
---
May all your enemies receive coal~
---
Hey that’s my line lol.
---
Played for about 4.5 hours today on public.  Dropped 6 nukes across multiple servers.  Sold about 5k in vendor goods.  
---
Not a trouble to be had so far.  No hacks.
---
"WET PAINT", is it though?
---
Whoa. For real?
---
It wold be a good response and would probably sell a fair amount of 1st subs after the free period is over.  The difference is quite dramatic performance-wise and everything isn't looted when you get there in Private servers.  Right now, it's really the only safe way to play this game when under constant terrorist attack from hackers. Hackers want to make Private as bad as Public and they will eventually succeed given enough time and BGS' obvious lack of attention to security or practice of common sense prevention. Hopefully they won't succeed, or it's curtains for FO76 on PC.
---
This is all so goddamn weird man. My mind is blown.
---
So, Endurance *may* impact how fast AP drains while sprinting, but definitely affects maximum HP, Poison &amp; Rad Resistances and Healing.
---
Hardware ban for the cheaters sounds nice, inb4 half of the PC playerbase gets decimated cause they fucked it up again and they banned people who had nothing to do with the exploit.
---
Endurance supposedly effects the amount of AP used by sprinting.  It for sure did in FO4
---
So in other words, to a point, both.  I’ve just never run high agi and high end on any character to notice.
---
Glad to know it held out for you, how have you been enjoying it thus far, also what quest are you on atm?
---
Upvoted for downvoting misinformation.
---
DUDE! i just thought of something..... maybe this whole just before xmas hacker thing is really a ploy by bethesda to force people into buying F1st. i mean xmas time what you want for xmas little timmy? " f1st so i can try not to get robbed" ... makes sense to me
---
For run, neither
---
For sprint, both.
---
The vendor for the Military General Wing's is to the right as you enter, into what looks like a workbench bay.  There's three terminals, and the center one is usable for vendor trade.
---
Considering what’s happened thus far, I wouldn’t be surprised if that happens...
---
And due from radiation sources you can't see!
---
Fallout 1st in its current state seems so bare the moment you remove one feature or make it free.
---
Right now there is something that can appeal to everyone. Even if a subscriber isn't interested in the scrap box or private world.
---
I am sure they were aware of this which is why the excessive atoms were tacked on during launch. Private worlds right now is just a pay to win feature since you can run a monopoly on workshops or do certain challenges without having to world hop to find X item/enemy. It is excellent for gift farming since you can put Santatrons everywhere.
---
When mods, admin options, server browser and up to 16+ player support comes in, then they can start making changes like that.
---
Hopefully they release more faction stuff like BOS  and Enclave next year I've been saving up for the responders security power armor paint and you can see it if you modify your excavator armor also more responders faction items would be cool like flags or signs
---
Completely agree. I have built up an entire Responders camp. I'd like to have flags or items with the logo on there.
---
same
---
I think a lot of kids are playing it too. My nephew is obsessed with the game and has been making tons of friends on it. His mom gives him $20 about once a month, maybe less, for the game.
---
Lame
---
I'd consider the beginning of a worthwhile exchange, an actual truly persistent world, with functioning respawns, resources, and a full server player limit of 24, just like the public servers at launch.
---
Samesies
---
Legally no. That's because you're supposed to give it to level 1 players for the best effect.
---
This is why people have their vendors in rooms with a door they can lock OR simply in a room they “lock” by building something.
---
I came across a cliff top house where the vendors were halfway down the cliff (reachable by stairs) and in a room barely big enough to fit side by side long ways with no door and a grated roof that you just couldn’t reach them through.
---
I tried everything and couldn’t get in there lol or reach the vendors.
---
Not my words. You can search that text in hundreds of posts on this reddit as well as Twitter. Don't take my word for it. Google it.
---
Yeah, I've had it happen several times now and only closing the game or rebooting stopped it. Pretty annoying.
---
Yes I had to mule over responders outfits from my new character because I had no other way of getting some, and sometimes I wear it and help out new players by dropping aid or ammo for free of course lol I kinda scare them when I have a 50 cal pointed at a present loot bag
---
I wanna say it's... 350? Not a high amount, considering. You gotta unlock the placeable presents before the tree, but they're both worthwhile.
---
I have 1 endurance, full agaility and run a bloody unyielding build.
---
I can sprint for miles without stopping.  I have one piece of armour with increased AP refresh and three points in action boy...but I am unsure if they play a part in this scenario.
---
We were pushed first. Simple as that. We weren't fans because we played a game everyone wants to hate. Sorry, but i'm not letting that reach my ears any longer. I love the people I play with and the community in game as a whole is a cut above the rest. It could have devolved into a PVP fest. It did in small cells, but most of those got bored and left. Good riddance. Most of the people I meet are good human beings.
---
Only when I'm in Battle Royale. lol
---
How much health do you have. Can you tank a lot of hits?
---
What do you mean you can’t buy? What error are you getting?
---
No.  But I almost never get hit and when I do have fully ranked serendipity and dodgy to save me.
---
I don’t get one shot by anything though, even if they both fail to proc.
---
Yeah I sold one in my camp for like 30 caps, dont know if it's intended. And I haven't gotten the jacket to check that
---
Server stability is definitely a priority, it runs worse now than this time last year!
---
I've had a ton of people donate the Responders gear to me. I've put on boards about buying them but most people have donated which has helped a ton! 
---
I started it as a police station and have now gotten all the FF helmets along with axe paints to make it a Responders HQ. 
---
I was bored and figured I'd play more of an immersive role with the game. Now I help new players or those who want a travel partner just for fun.
---
😂 What a joke. Can I get a refund on this garbage game? I paid $40 for it and only played it for two hours.
---
I heard it's rare for the responders fire outfits to drop from some event called fly swatter it would be a cool piece for a collection
---
Pretty good, up to the enclave events and grinding for black titanium for the excuvator power armor
---
You pay for 1st to get a private server, atoms, and exclusive cosmetics. nothing else. I have spoken
---
I remember having a set of the excavator power armor, and the black titanium, i used to simply keep the brotherhood quest active to keep the armor spawning, then scrapped it, left the server and kept reloading it to get a tone, not sure if its still doable
---
Sometimes it's like that for a whole play session!
---
I've gotten 3 people to give them to me. I've only paid maybe 1500 caps in top for tons of Responders gear.
---
I've got around 30 Responders Head Gear
---
About 18 Outfits only, 1 paramedic outfit
---
I really wish I could display outfits!
---
I sell them now for all 911 caps each. Just to be funny
---
Hey...Merry Christmas to you! May you and your family be Blessed and have a Very Happy New Year!
---
I think the scrap box should be free for all.
---
I think a hood replacement would be free fast travel everywhere.
---
Thats just too much
---
Ive heard of this..how does it work?
---
I’ve done the I am death and have been promoted to general. But all of the terminals in the military wing. The three lined up all say press “X” to “Activate” then just gives me a line from the terminal and that’s all.
---
That's not a bad idea, rolling a new character. I have that issue in a lot of single player RPGs - I play for about 40-60 hours, get bored and move on to another game. In a year or so I revisit the game but don't remember all my characters progression so I delete it and make a new one. God only knows how many Fallout and Elder Scroll characters I've just deleted.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself, every day I try to convince my friends to finally play fallout 76 with me but all I get is a lame excuse how it's a terrible game. Even when they've never played it. But I don't need them to have fun, this is still a great game. If they can't accept that, are they really friends?
---
Merry Christmas survivor!
---
This is the most middle ground solution ive seen. 1000 of each would be more than enough
---
" I can act however I please to someone because we have freedom of speech" That says a LOT about you as a person, the kind of person who I'd rather stop speaking to now. Have a nice day, and try not to abuse your rights too much Mr.Politician...
---
Waiting for Christmas.  The hacker responsible for this last fisaco had bigger plans.  What this last patch did to thwart that is unknown because we hazve zero idea what BGS did to 'fix' the problem.  We know that Private servers is a prime target and active exploits are being sought. With BGS security isn't a high priority.  Hackers would love to crash someone's private server murder, steal, and wreck everything and post it on YouTube.
---
I dont agree that the inventory system is a good system of balance for gameplay. The scrap should be limited. I would even be okay with a small stash reduction if junk were free to store.
---
If your sitting down when you pass out you get stuck in the loop
---
That would work if they had plenty to offer for the latter. They have trouble as it supplying new content for the normal atom stop.
---
I was walking around in the mire
---
This would be nice for everyone too. Missiles weigh too much.
---
What are they supposed to do, put add space on all networks? Knock on your door and have Todd Howard tell you personally? They sent out a fix and posted the notification on their site and it was posted on here several times yesterday.
---
I've heard about it when seated this is the first time I've heard about it walking around.
---
The part of this issue I find the most annoying(XB1) is every damn time I visit the Whitesprings Vendors. I open the door, go inside, down the stairs, oh shit, there's the shopping music....and suddenly, I'm right back at the entrance to the Whitesprings again as the interior completes loading, and then I repeat going down the stairs again. WTF.
---
I believe this is also fair. I have worked a lifetime to afford a lifestyle where i can play games i enjoy in peace. Trying to milk people for content that should have been in the base game is not okay. I have spoken.
---
I still play and enjoy the game despite all the lag and crashing. But I found myself avoiding some player bases or being extremely cautious due to traps and ambushes.
---
Yeah, for the life of me I can’t stop playing 76. It’s fucking awesome. I walked into the Whitesprings Country Club last night and there were no ghouls to be found. Thought that was weird. Next thing I know I’m taking damage and the music is intense. Nothing around me. No red dots, nothing on VATS. A second later all of the ghouls in the place are laying on the ground sliding and attacking me. Not even moving their arms or anything, just laying like they were sleeping. Like 20 of them and a Wendigo. I haven’t laughed that hard at a game ever. Even the glitches bring me joy.
---
I pay for Fallout 1st and tbh I'd 100% support it becoming obtainable by everyone it's such a great advantage to have
---
I think it's 1, 250, 500 in order so 751 exp. Should be able to earn it in 3-4 games pretty easy if you just hide in a bush and move towards the end zone.
---
A scrap box for everyone would be a teeny tiny step in the right direction.
---
There is on at crashed airplane in the swamps near the heart of the swamp even. On the cliff you can reach water lead and wood.
---
Hey I’m considering your offer. What level is it? How much is the base damage?
---
Does anyone have a screenshot of them in game? I'd like to see them before I buy.
---
yeah the rubber-banding is really bad when you first load into the interior of the whitespring. it is very annoying.
---
Not to mention game stability.  Have had hard freezes on load regularly after this last patch.  Uninstalled/reloaded FO76 twice since patch and it's still happens.  This is on top of the already well-documented freeze trying to drinking water or simple crash to desktop going on since forever and never fixed.  My Ryzen laptop doesn't hard freeze (it still crashes, though) so it might be something with the Intel i-7 processor, Windows build,  or my 1080 graphics card. Either way, my Ryzen plays better with FO76 than my Intel desktop.
---
They should make a single player server for nonfirst members that allows you to play offline, as well as a stash box increase. The scrapbox should be obtainable without first and instead first members should get more first/golden themed items in the atomic shop exclusive to them, whether they cost atoms or not (which in all honesty they would) I don’t honestly care, but it seems fair to me that first members would still get exclusive items and nonfirst members would still be able to play the game.
---
And zero of them are actually good value.
---
That's indeed a great switch.
---
+1 for the idea
---
Tool
---
Remember when they said this game works?
---
I love this game because 76 let's me share my happy place. I hate this game, because now there are people in my happy place 😃😠😃😠😃😠
---
Happy Jollydays and Merry Christmas
---
I understand completely.  I actually liked mixing with other players, but lately there have been so many con jobs and hacking going on I've retreated to private.  It's no different than playing FO4 except you don't have NPCs to encounter (which is not a huge deal IMO, they say the same things over and over).  Wastelanders will make the game co-op FO4 and, if BGS doesn't screw it up, might make for a fun experience.
---
that was supposed to be a feature it was even mentioned in Loadscreens feels like they removed it before beta to try to force players to trade
---
Yeah I wish they give the mannequins for outfit display like on fallout 4 that would be cool
---
Rad. That's good to know
---
The people who defend this game are NOT hardcore "Fallout" fans. They're simply shills for this broken joke of a game that has a Fallout skin slapped on top of it. Nothing about this game is "Fallout".
---
A while back I used it for improving damage on mirelurk queens and it was working.
---
[removed]
---
That’s awesome!!
---
Todd said It just work, don't challenge the creator.
---
What responders outfits do you have for sell? And what platform are you on?
---
It certainly does. Makes a big difference against 'lurks in V94.
---
Ok reminder the unofficial patches are made buy an unhinged guy who has patched in cut content several times. And actually break the game in some cases.   
---
And no they are not anything like what I said. Invalidating your whole damn post. Also how did you post on a deleted topic?
---
Neither of them should be in the base game.  The tent is a novelty item that saves you all of the 20-30 caps you would otherwise spend on a fast travel and the scrap box spoils the concept of having limited supplies that barely make this a survival game.
---
Yes, it speaks about how much of a monster I am, how heartless and cold blooded I am, and how much I don't care about it, but anyways Mr. Name caller, happy holidays :)
---
Me too. I love it. Wanna play all the time. Merry christmas
---
You never encounter a looted Whitesprings, West Tek, or Harper's Ferry.  In fact, you get a extra spawn of Super Mutants at West-Tek which is good for legendary hunting.  Not sure why they don't spawn in Public Servers (timeout from lag?).  
---
Miss the interesting ammo/junk in random suitcases around train stations and the occasional good find at a player's vending station and everyday activities going on that make the game feel 'alive'. I loved the period where Whitesprings was the communal gathering spot because they consolidated the faction vendors there.  20 people lounging around the shops, legendaries in the trash cans (this is before the purveyor) or at the vendors cheap.  Fun times.
---
Whitespring is the most consistent case of this. I go inside. Start walking. Magically reappear at the door.
---
OP is a known scammer.
---
As a 1st member, I dont really want anything, scrapbox should be for everyone after some of the stuff that has gone on with this game. I feel like every aspect of what the game "is" at its core is made more functional by freeing up that stash space, and never having to worry as much about materials for crafting and repairs.
---
It should be rewarded as a blueprint from the queen.
---
This comment was made by the AD and LBJ gang
---
I think this is great to do and I did something similar but then today  a Level  200+ came along and took all 10+ copies of all Ultracite PA parts plans had put on there for noobs - clearly no concept of take what you need....
---
**" resulted in a few players losing items "**
---
**" we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected "**
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
over 530 players in just one video is a small number of players affected? can you count ?? wtf kind of reply is this
---
if you guys are trying to nip this in the bud and throw something on top to cover it up your way too late.
---
just admit it affected a LARGE amount of players pretty much THE WHOLE of the population who didnt have access to private servers meaning over half the playerbase ffs bethesda just be real when you talk to us  your so good at avoiding the truth and this is the main reason your player base dislikes you.
---
It’s fixed but now people are still able to put items into your inventory but can’t take anything out
---
It’s already been Xmas here haha, 12+ hours ahead of you guys... :-)
---
Love this idea
---
There is a cap limit? I'm at 6k ish and no idea what to spend them on, any ideas?
---
I think that's stacked conduit.  If it is that's a hell of a budget sink.
---
I keep trying to find a reason to play the game but I find myself dealing with something everytime like this. Guess I'll just keep on playing other games on my list till then.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, or even support Fallout 1st. But calling people who can afford 12 dollars a month as "deep pocket" is pretty absurd.
---
Yep. I did similar with my camp. Had issues with people just taking and reselling. I put the letters on my front desk telling them to message me if they wanted free gear. I'd fast travel back to my camp and help them out.
---
using low level weapons gives you more xp.
---
The exploit was patched out within hours of the hack actually going live.  But you wouldn't know it because this thread is full of a mixture of clueless idiots, console fanboys and people that don't even play the game.
---
give weight to scrap for server stability is a major lie.
---
In fact, having set a weight to each scrap and take it into account helps to decrease server stability.
---
Ek! When I see it like that I’d rather keep my broken leg 😂🙈
---
I've never encountered any major issues on an nvme SSD.  Maybe my camp not being loaded, but that takes about 5 seconds more.
---
I thought there was a section in 1st that gave them discounts in the Atomic Store?
---
And yeah it’s 30k x
---
Oh look, another shit for brains that doesn't understand that the atom shop has the complexity of a fucking web page and that's why it gets fixed more quickly than server side fixes that require downtime or engine/asset fixes that require patching things client side.  The fix for this exploit was server side, which is why they fixed the fucking thing within hours of the exploit going public and only had to take the PC servers down for an hour to do it.
---
Not using push to talk is like farting in an elevator. Only barbarians do it
---
Merry Christmas from all of us Responders and Fire Breathers 👨‍🚒🎁🎅🎄
---
If they make a 100lb shared stash people would want that to be available to everyone too.
---
Yeah I had a level 200+ show up just as unlocked the door and took all 25 stimpacks and radaways another player donated to me after he seen what I was doing and wanted to donate. 
---
I just need to hunt for steel to write a message on the vendor saying Take what you need and leave what you don't need and think of other players.
---
Merry Christmas everyone! Had some good luck with Christmas gifts in game today!
---
Just so that it annoys immature trolls like you and entices you to come in here and whine like an infant.
---
Jesse pinkman would wear one
---
The ability to filter cheaters out of your game.
---
Ohh don't fool yourself boy. They have a 24/7 open business, and this is their job. You can thank them when they provide extra service outside of what is actually EXPECTED from a live service. All I can see is greedyness, and people thank them for it. Mad mad world.
---
Merry Christmas
---
Yep, the weight in fact adds another variable. Wether weight is actually handled server-side or handled client-side... who the hell knows. Besides the hackers.
---
on point mate 👏
---
There hasn't been anything announced that I'm aware of.
---
it's christmas dude. Go be with somebody. Anybody. I'm on break at work, so at least I have an excuse.
---
They put a bounty on Santa
---
How does it feel to shit yourself in rage over someone using the word "few"?
---
Yeah. The number of times I've fought a SB with chemist,  weapon artisan and fix it good loaded...
---
I think some type of ammo solution would be cool. An ammo box that works like the junk box or an ammo converter/scraper that worked on every type of ammo and explosive.
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
I prefer farting on escalators
---
Agreed...it needs to be higher, but not unrestricted. Damn, I could explore without power armor again.
---
Something that saves you in game currency isn't exactly what I'd call a novelty, but alright. 
---
As for the scrap box, if it spoils the concept, then it shouldn't be in the game at all, subscription or not. That aside, unlimited storage was a standard feature in the three previous games and while I get that storing unlimited guns and armor would tax the servers big time, unlimited scrap has no real excuse to be behind a pay wall. Pay walling the unlimited scrap box is a dick move. 
---
Especially for those who rely a lot on crafting, something that you'd have to do a lot of in the real world if you were in a survival situation. Have a nuclear apocalypse happen and you aren't going to be able to bop down to the local train station/gun store for more ammo whenever you need it. Some extra ammo you might scrounge, but if you know how to craft it, you have an immediate advantage over everyone else, and if you're given the ability to craft more of it at a time (thanks to unlimited scrap storage) then everyone else around you who knows how to craft, you have another immediate advantage.
---
It’s meant to take a while, you have until the 6th it’s not like it ends tomorrow.
---
Lol your an idiot. Bethesda were told of this exploit before it happened and they chose to do nothing. Stop supporting this garbage
---
Yeah, but I have other games to play and the last challenge is asking for 14,000 xp
---
No, you're literally arguing against that.  Camp budgets and restrictions on things like lights exist because the more the game has to load and the more complex the things it has to load the more resources are required to render it all client side.
---
Just ask anyone that played FO4 with the settlement budget uncapped what happens when you get overzealous with placing lights, eventually your system just tries to commit suicide.  They can't just bypass these restrictions so you can keep placing more and more atom shop lights and fog machines and more and more and more.  Even if your system can handle it the same can't always be said for consoles or anyone running the game on a potato at the minimum requirements.
---
I have a 3* Mutant slayers explosive handmade that rocks non stop....very consistent
---
But they did exactly what they wanted, half of it was fear mongering the other was to turn people on Bethesda. They were warned about it days in advance and were not ready. They took almost a day to respond and fix the issue. Not to mention all these hacks have been uploaded publicly so Bethesda can literally download them and just remove what makes them work.
---
Depends how badly you want the rewards
---
The challenges are perfectly doable, i know NW can feel like a grind, but if you push yourself to  get better, and dont just bush wookie, you'll start to have fun and enjoy the mode
---
They dont care, they ban ppl who report them bugs and exploits, they were told of this exploit too before it happened, they had time to fix it but they chose to do nothing. Stop supporting this garbage
---
I fast traveled to a players camp to check out their vending machine. They built on a cliff side. I spawned in before the base loaded.  Did a Wile E. Coyote standing on nothing then plummeted to my death.
---
With that ffr you should go commando fo sho, im jealous!
---
Again you have until the 6th, it’s not ending anytime soon. Either take your time and do it or don’t get the reward.
---
This shot was the last think to me,  most everything.  I will never touch this stinky peace of mud again.
---
Yep, this guy is a bethesda shill.
---
Found the Grinch
---
The negativity towards the game or the hackers that are making the game a negative  experience?
---
The issue with the challenges going like that, is that everyone just saves up the challenges until all of them are unlocked
---
Beth have to make the most of NW challenges to get people into the mode
---
Side note... its brilliant to see full 52 player lobbies, and not the same 20-25 lobbies over and over again
---
Shouldn’t an explosive cryolator’s damage negate its self. Explosive and cold...make sense? Haha
---
It’s a bit much but it is doable. And you can use the caps you generate to buy gift wraps so that’s nice.
---
I want an ammo box then! I hate lugging so much weight of ammo in my stash.
---
No, double check your perk cards maybe... Sometimes I do drink crafting and log on the next day with terrible perks and my charisma gear on and I'm dying a lot, I'm like wtf yanno
---
You came on like an obvious troll trying to stir up shit, and got called out on it. 
---
Now run along, boy.
---
That's what I thought when I got it ages ago lol, funny thing is, it still freezes mobs, I use it to slow the queen down everytime lmao
---
Gotcha
---
Only the bug plans (not Mirelurks) are available in game, but I could see them being added with Wastelanders
---
Haha looks cool!
---
It is nice, but it would be better if you got more xp if your team won, not how they have it now, so you only get xp if you last
---
This is so gay lmao
---
 yes 
---
Maintain situational awareness 
---
be careful entering camps with no clear exit out
---
By law that’s not possible lol
---
True-but I feel like getting better can mean two different things. Doing what everybody else is doing isn’t getting better (bush wookiing and spam frog legs/noob tube)-if you don’t do what a lot of people think is easy than it is quite challenging and can be frustrating. Ie carefully sniping a team of players and then getting blown away by a team of button mashers with the same perk cards equipped.
---
Yep. RNG with no protocols to prevent that from happening.
---
off topic but I was unaware of the fake buoyancy vest story and am just a little horrified now
---
some people are just awful
---
Personally, I've said from the start that the scrapbox should be for everyone, not just us FO1sters. I'm really fine with just the private world and the atoms as our benefits of FO1st, and some cosmetics here and there. I'd really rather not get any more gameplay advantage than just the private world. I'm not paying for advantages other than being able to tool around without having to deal with people now and then.
---
This: https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Agility
---
Doesn't mention AP refresh rates, only the amount of AP.
---
Unless I missed something there's no mention about any stats affecting AP regen rate here: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Action_Points
---
This: https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Endurance
---
Says Endurance gives a reduction in the AP drain when sprinting.
---
This wiki shows they had the same kind of role in FO4, if not the same values. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Endurance

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Agility
---
700? What's your secret?
---
Nah to me it looks like you're the one full of hate here, you're probably having a bad christmas huh? Did those hackers get you too? I bet they did
---
Yea just wondering if i should put em away til next month then up the price a bit lol
---
Aww, did that strike a nerve for someone?
---
29 years old and still trolling on the interwebs. 
---
Daddy must be proud.
---
Perhaps the universe is doing you a solid.
---
I feel bad, I got him an egg cooker bc he likes eggs 🥺.
---
Can’t miss an opportunity to hand out some atoms and get people used to making microtransactions. Bonus points for giving out a weird amount where it doesn’t matter what you buy you have some left over and need to buy more atoms to actually make use of them!
---
I have a pistol build that does 1,238 damage per headshot. Or a 800 body shot.
---
Market players
---
It's a reward for people who put time into this game mode. Not a participation trophy for everyone jumping over for the skins
---
Literally everyone? I don't have 2 characters either. Go learn the word literally. If this was intended there would be a mailbox system and no cap limit, not this workaround. It's good you found a way to game the system, but you make it shitty for casuals.
---
I'm not saying I don't want to work for it, the xp not transferring is just bad and makes it harder then it should be
---
It lets me open the may right away but usually takes another 30-60 secs before it will let me fast travel
---
There's a finite amount of space to build logically in the hills of Appalachia. I'm near a station, but not dead next to it. I've not had to find a new world as often as when the tents came out.
---
It's fine for you, but the majority of players like less remote areas. And it makes sense that a temporary tent be less of a priority than a carefully placed and built camp.
---
Here is another one, pretty cool, he used some of jugs building methods, but this one is cool because it looks like it closes and opens in half which was neat
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx156Y3pEL0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx156Y3pEL0)
---
Both are neat
---
I know it means very little to what Bethesda puts in the game, but I don't think the outcasts were formed yet. I myself loved the outcasts and would like Bethesda to do more with them in the future.
---
Except there seemed to be nothing else to back that up, there's math up the wazoo for all other different aspects of each special stat, however here: https://www.carls-fallout-4-guide.com/vats/action-points.php
---
I finally found something that makes sense, under 'How AP Regeneration Works', it says AP regeneration is a percentage of your full AP, therefore higher Agility=More AP, but also more AP per second since the AP usage rates are the same.
---
Which it turns out the other page mentions, but it's wording regeneration rate in seconds had me skip over the point.
---
Thanks for pushing me to hunt it down.
---
You're in the room next to the 'boardroom' with the silo codes?
---
Well said! And if you stop by my camp (PC) you'll find great plan pricing!
---
All good. I’d personally love to see an official breakdown from Bethesda on the specifics instead of them making the players do the testing &amp; reporting.
---
I would be perfectly fine with it.  I don't like the scrap box being behind a paywall.  I would like it to be in the Atom Shop for say 750 Atoms (just a number I pulled out of my head) and open to all who want it.  I think we should have had something like this to start with, maybe with a limit on how much of each material you can have in it that was just part of the base game.
---
I particularly like being a disembodied head swimming over invisible water.
---
I bought the game right out of the gate. Quit playing about a month or two after release due to many concerns that have sense been fixed and picked it back up this month. 
---
I play on PC, I truly do like the game although I do experience crashes occasionally, not often enough to call it unplayable. They have made a lot of improvements, and with the Settlers expansion (or patch some may call it) coming up, I think the game is a very well playable game. Is it worth it? That's up to you, but imo it's a full fledged game with tons of content and I really do like the community I usually find in my worlds.
---
&gt; I know it means very little to what Bethesda puts in the game, but I don't think the outcasts were formed yet.
---
Obviously that makes no difference to Bethesda. Outcast power armor paint can bot obtained in Nuclear Winter.
---
I found this one or one like it near the lumberyard.  My only objection is that it is so close to 76 that too many newbs will go in.  Keep this for the veterans who are curious and don't mind.
---
Here is the compromise I thought of. Everyone gets the tents. 1sters can place scrapboxes anywhere in C.A.M.Ps and Workshops. Non 1sters are limited to the scrapbox in the tent.
---
Ahh, didn't know that. I don't play nuclear winter.
---
TOS in legal eyes are useless, countless cases went to court and have been lost. After a few have lost like they have when future cases go to trial they look at past cases and those set what will happen to the future. The past has shown it fails. One of the cases that one stated something that I found really good point it was along the lines of " you cant prove I was that one that clicked that okay I accept" and they cant.
---
You don’t know the meaning of ‘shill’.
---
And they have removed mention of it from the description on the FO1 page.
---
I'd be ok with the script limit if we were buying random mods and could place them on our weapon of choice. It makes no sense the way it is set up now. As a rifle build I probably get 1 out of 25 rifles, so tired of mutant slayer fatmen.
---
You can get PA plans from treasure maps.
---
Helpful to know, but consider Bethesda didn't even update their own thread is sad.
---
TIL that "a few" can be used to describe literal hundreds.
---
Treasure maps are an option, as is the Distant Thunder event or T3 locked containers.
---
Reskins shouldn’t be too surprising. That’s been the case with any game I’ve played with mounts. The only big introductions usually come with DLCs or during a lull when they don’t have other content. 
---
I don’t like either so it’s not an issue for me. I get your point that if someone wanted *only* a gold one, that sucks, but since that one wasn’t available first they have two. It would make sense for discounts of same item purchases, but since they don’t give discounts on packages when you have an item, I doubt that would be around soon.
---
Also you have the same cap pool. So you can’t sell and get 1400 caps from vendors everyday for each character.
---
Thank you.  I also sell plans for the most part.  I try to keep my prices reasonable based on how rare something is or how many I have.  I tend to follow what the game says the plan is worth.
---
Quite neat! I've never seen the boxes in the last pair of pics before.
---
Ultracite armor plans are awarded when you complete another questline.
---
or if you don’t want to wait, they can’t e bought from some player vendors.
---
I bet you're a thief too.
---
You know it, brother! Most fun I've had in months.
---
And was secure from hacks?
---
 
---
yes fallout 76 has has major problems
---
but its crazy how much of a hate on people have had for this game
---
from day one
---
Hell even before the release people were badmouthing FO/76
---
This whole hacker thing is because some piss ants got their jammies in a wad over the fact people are playing a game they despise
---
Go piss off and go find a girlfriend or something
---
and leave the people who do want to play the game the hell alone
---
People still play this game?
---
any item in game has no real world currency value, sorry to ruin your circle jerk. I bet you can find it in the TOS as well. Also, the company has not said that they hold any real would value. If you are using real money to buy and in game item does not mean it has any real world value as well. I cant go and resell any item I have on a market like CSGO
---
Something like a VM, also it takes around 5min or less to remake a VM
---
Vanguard armor mostly (mix in a chameleon or two), and a vampire prime gatling laser. Can stand in front of the SBQ and empty my fusion cores with no worries.
---
Private world allowing multiple camps
---
bypass this on a VM( virtual machine), or other exploits.
---
Hahahaha this one made me laugh as for it happens to me all the time. I spawn in and can clearly see people standing where I know the floor should be but the floor had not loaded in for me yet so I just fall to my to my doom.
---
&gt;  and acting like nothing had really happened 
---
Following Bethesda's lead, when in Rome, etc.
---
Merry Christmas!
---
You get plans and a full set of utracite power armor when you complete Belly of the Beast.
---
Ahh, boy does that hill seem familiar. Love the curved wall in your old CAMP, and great Wendigo use! Wish there were more pics; I'd love to see the roof.
---
Didnt fallout 4 explain that it was the backtalker mentioned in the museum of technology?
---
It makes sense to exist, but i would like some more AR variants than the 3 we have, 100%. R91 for life.
---
You can say there's no such thing as Santatron, but as for me and Robco, we believe...
---
E A T  M Y  M E A T
---
I have no idea lol I eventually got sidetracked doing the overseer quests so the game is doing it’s job keeping me occupied. I played for about 10 hrs today
---
yes, it is stupid for players that don’t pvp. (I do pvp)
---
my best advice to you is get a weapon, armor, and aid, then hide and ride the storm. shoot for an average of 500XP per round and u can do it without it being an obscene grind.
---
It's a hard lvl reward for that reason. People who put ten times the extra grind SHOULD have things that people that only play one hour a day do not have. You actually get what you put into it.
---
That wasn't what I meant at all.  They were playing like it was Friday or Saturday before the hack.  Everyone  was aware of it but didn't let fear stop them from playing.  No one seemed to change their habits or close up shop even if they weren't sure if the patch worked.  What people did was show courage.
---
I love this game, even with all her little problems
---
Crystallizing barrel is all around bugged. I think two shot is bugged as well. It shows much higher numbers than it should. It also messes with the projectiles
---
expand the map across the river and into Kentucky
---
you could have settlers against  scorched /scorched beast
---
both   vying for control against  raiders and super mutants  and other factions 
---
as well
---
Same here.  I can't wait for Wastelanders.
---
I've never known it to be possible from experience. It has only shown tame for me as well. With or without a tame already in possession and always at a random spawn location. Others have said they have though, but I've never seen pictures. I haven't looked into it too much, since they can die at Todd's will. Hopefully they fix the taming system at some point.
---
Yeah that's a whoosh.
---
Hell yeah, only game ive played since november of last year...well except an occasional C&amp;C3 skirmish match.
---
There is outcast power armor. You get it from Nuclear Winter.
---
What exactly do you mean by "corrupt your whole charzcter"? A syringe that makes you glow for 9999 days or there is something else?
---
Thanks! I've given out over a hundred small gifts several regular holiday gifts, and over a hundred sets of plans. Most people seem pretty chill and excited about it. However, I'm mostly giving them to low levels. I made a whole set of fixers and I've been finding level 20 ish people to give them to they seem pretty stoked about it it's been fun!
---
I play many games but I always try to make a few hours for 76.
---
You clear glass cavern all the way to the end, defeat every enemy including the SB. Mine a ultracite node, and it will spawn about 6-7 scorched, usually 1 is legendary sometimes 2. It works every time you mine a node, but you have to clear the wave each time or else it glitches and you waste a node. I think other problems arise when another player enters the cavern, which is why many people have suggested doing it on a private server. The turnout is great, especially for a full team since each player has instanced mining nodes and there are a LOT of ultracite nodes in there. Another thing I noticed after dying there was some of the nodes respawned when I hoofed it back to the end. Also a server hop refreshed the nodes as well. I don't think these mechanics are intended but it's freaking great. I suggest power armor and bringing rad x and rad away or a teammate and rad sponge, you WILL take constant rads in the last cavern area so good luck to bloody builds.
---
People can put purveyor legendary boxes in your inventory which is a quick ban. And apparently you can place a scorchbeast attack in an inventory and if you don’t have the script that allows you to carry and equip NPC weapons it corrupts your character
---
I agree.  I just want fallout 1st for the private world.  Doesn't feel right that everyone doesn't get the scrap box.
---
Farm the cricket hoard even I did it got 300 acid. Don’t kill the boss just let them spawn.
---
Take hemlock holes to produce acid, the kill the nearby monster for more. Cloth and acid = gunpowder. And super mutants carry it.
---
Gunpowder is super mutants (for me) and acid is the method where you go to multiple locations in "the forest" to collect chloroform and batteries.
---
powder i normally get off mutants/ammo crates.
---
acid my go to is tanagra town server hoping, a few crickets are in the tunnel that drop 5-7 each on avg
---
Think about having 25 people on a public server all with unlimited scrapboxes. Seems like the entire world would be stripped clean.
---
No, it stopped working after the last patch.
---
Compared to the Halloween challenges it's harder because your xp moved to the next challenge for that, if that's what Bethesda was going for they should have given out different rewards like maybe a winter themed trophy, not cosmetics and skins
---
Lucky you.  I just did my single character limit of 1k and got nothing worth keeping.  Not a surprise but part of me had a little hope that maybe, because its nearly Christmas that I'd get a good roll or two.  Nope.  Well, 150 per day gets me two more rolls per day and 3 every other day until this ends.  Maybe I'll still luck out.
---
I tried that
---
Thanks but I tried multiple times
---
Flux farming.
---
Thanks
---
I killed one some days ago because it scared the shit out of me and my commando empties a magazine before checking if the target is a threat or not. A guy was trying to tame it, since he gave me the thumbs down. 
---
Go tame a radroach, dude. Deathclaws nasty. They dice and slice.
---
Oh yes, that'd be perfect.
---
Merry Christmas Vault Dwellers.
---
If nothing else, I salute your fortitude and perseverance. Too many times I've logged in to have some game ending bug. But the people who play are great and the world that was crafted in this game is amazing. I just hope some day to come back to a functional game.
---
I mean, what's even funnier is there's no such thing as a 'sever programmer' either. There hasn't been in about ohhh.. 4 decades.
---
Campfire tales is good for acid too
---
No, no it doesn't exist. They're called software developers.
---
Agree to disagree. However, there should be a second currency like how in metro the good bullets are the currency but ammo is so scarce in that game it really makes you think about saving and spending. I suggested Bobby pins as they are universally "useful" to all players, weightless and players could also use it as a cap sink like I mentioned. Not every one uses 5.56 ammo or uses ammo weight reduction perks or armor. Just my two caps here.
---
Where did you get the bag of flour, or what looks like a bag of flour...in your kitchen picture?
---
But not everyone's into battle royals.
---
It takes 5 to 10 minutes just to get into a match then another 10+ minutes to earn 100-200 xp.
---
Its beyond boring to me.
---
I have at least 4 of each of the common ones...I haven't gotten any santas or lights yet and it's driving me nuts.
---
It is Razorgrain Flour, from last year's faschnaut event I think
---
I’d be more than happy to have the scrap box and tent all other players. After I got it my stash went down to 150 it was nuts!
---
If FO1st was only private servers + value atoms from the beginning, I don’t think anyone would have left and the game wouldn’t have gotten all that extra bad press back in October (it was trending on twitter lmao). I still would have gotten it since that and the ranger outfit are the only reasons I got it.
---
Hope Bethesda comes around on this issue, and if we get a bonus to compensate for the loss then that just means we get even more stuff all around! Id be more than fine with it, i of course, can’t speak for everyone!
---
I believe in taking what you need. I take 38 ammo and 40mm grenades. I also leave my santatron unlocked. 
---
Free plans, sometimes. Nobody takes my mole Miner gauntlet ones.
---
I usually have to wait 5 minuets just to get a notification saying “Oh no! Someone took your CAMP spot! Look for a new server?” Rinse and repeat fro about 20min and you finally get a server.
---
I think you are mistaken.  People exchange dollars for atoms and purchase game items.  An act that causes that dollar income to be reduced could lead to legal action assuming it can be traced to an individual or group.  If you look on e-bay you will that game items have real world value, official or not. Not really my problem if it does or not and your opinion and mine will be irrelevant if lawyers are involved.
---
The NCR Vet. Ranger armor makes sense lore-wise, exept for the jacket.
---
there's an Xmas tree underwater somewhere between deathclaw island and point pleasant I believe, if not it's definitely in that stream somewhere. I have a picture in my loading screens
---
I just give them numbers. If I gets a number, that means it won't be scripped. Also, it helps my hoarding, because I never keep more than ten weapons or ten pieces of armor. 
---
Stash limits mean choices.
---
Thank you, I appreciate it. I'll look for you once the dust officially settles on the hack problem.
---
That's not a official site that's not real world value. I can go sell items from fortnight too and it's bannable, those items in fortnight also have no real world value and again on f76 if I need to I'll find it in the TOS for you. Legit brain-dead
---
Low level enemies, multipliers and a flawed game. My gunslinger can cause 700 damage on headshots with his 10mm. Up to 2000 with his western revolver.
---
Math is crazy.
---
You do know you get more xp the longer you survive right? It's less about killing people and more about bush camping.
---
Yeah especially when you go to the high school and schools and you see the mens and woman skeletons holding hands when they die together
---
When will this game work right?
---
This is why i recommend visit my base instead. Not much to sell, but the home itself is very neat :D And no traps whatsoever, free ~~real estate~~ shops and entertainment, except my personal quarters.
---
Honestly it wasn’t even that bad
---
I think they should have given all players a 500 lb scrap box for junk and given first the unlimited. 
---
I think all players should have gotten a mini camp, not the tent, but a sleeping bag and a stash box. 
---
Then fo1 members just get the atoms, which pay for the sub itself, and the extra stuff. Plus the private servers which understandably need funding for.
---
Let FO1st stash share across all characters
---
Trust me I'm not into them at all. Im lvl 27 in NW only because of the skins and cosmetics. But I'm lvl 302 in Adventure and my end game has become collecting all plans and cosmetics. I enjoy the harder to come by drops and grinds. If they all are handed to me I have nothing to try for. 
---
 I'm only 700/14000 So I'm going to be so sick of NW in the next two days of grinding but so much the sweeter when I get it. lol
---
Imagine saying that yet being in the official FO76 reddit page trashing it lmaooooo
---
How im celebrating! Merry Christmas my friend and thank you!

Hell yeah dude! Despite the issues, it's still just a game. And defined by the awesome community and stories we forge together!
---
Risky opinion there, but I agree.  It never bothered me much, I thought the whole kerfuffle was really overblown.
---
Your argument as it is does not change my mind on this topic. Obviously mine has not swayed you so I don't see much point in continuing to discuss it.
---
I gotta say it's a clever way to deal with the build limit
---
That's something
---
Anything useful lol
---
I hope so
---
Lol idk maybe 🤷‍♂️
---
Worse.  I've came back a few times since May (came back big when they released backpacks) and every time I login it's just more and new bugs.  The game became basically unplayable with the stash limit issues, I spent more time fighting the inventory simulator than I did in being able to actually play or enjoy it.  You run around in nuked zones fighting 3+ star monsters that drop legendary baseball bats and other junk still.  
---
After spending 2 years lying that they couldn't increase the stash limit due to stability concerns, they offered unlimited junk stash to hugely alleviate this problem but monetized it at over $100/yr to get it.  
---
Whatever Fallout 76 was planned to promised to be, it's been driven into a ditch and left to die.
---
Oh okay might have to email good ole bethesda 🤦‍♂️
---
Good, your argument can be solved if you go in the TOS or better go on there website, I don't see a official market like you have in csgo, Dota,tf2 or any game with a real world value.
---
Suddently the internet is full of self proclaimed game engine 'experts' but these poor fuckers probably have never even written a hello world line in their lives and even lack basic understanding of their own rigs, its mindblowing lol
---
NOTHING IS OVERBLOWN IN THIS SUB. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? REMEMBER THAT SUPER VALUABLE COLLECTRON THAT YOU COULDN’T POSSIBLY BUY BY SAVING UP YOUR DAILY QUEST ATOMS?!
---
No, yeah, I agree. The cutouts were fine and shit is overblown here.
---
Yes!  What we have here is special and the community is one of the best I've ever seen.
---
yikes
---
Eh, it's hit and miss.  There are things that piss me off unreasonably that no one here seems to care about, but other things that people get rabid over that I couldn't care less about.  I guess people have varying opinions or something silly like that ;-)
---
They are a waste of everyone’s time, I still fail to see what is so funny about them? I just dont get it.....I dont usually carry anything valuable on me so no I’m not sour, I just think it is silly when you are posing as a vendor just to trap people. I guess it is part of role playing but we really rent role playing in this game....
---
Oh god I just remembered I left my tent by WhiteSprings and I don’t even use it, I’m so sorry

What’s an example of something you hate that no one else cares about?

---
You can be pretty sure that most assets from fo4 that aren't already in the game will be cycled in as atom shop content. 
---
One thing I miss, surprisingly, is the junky looking wood building sets, as well as the junk fences. I ended up hating them after a couple hundred hours of vanilla settlement building in fo4....
---
But now I miss them. Especially those corner pieces with the slanted roofs, and half walls. We really need half walls.
---
That standee would have almost been fine if it weren't for that damn flashing light on it. When wastelanders drops it wouldn't be a terrible thing for the atomic shop to have a physical location in one of the instanced areas where they could display some of the new or sale items so you could view before you buy.
---
Smells like Flavortown
---
I mean it's true, this game has been around in several iterations, and frankly, Fallout 76 has been a more dramatic shift from the core gameplay than any other.  Even if hackers weren't our stealing your entire inventory and modding in 10 star items and duping anything they find, aimbotting and wallhacking and hiding under the ground in NW, etc. there's a ton of valid criticisms where this game moved in directions that were very popular with fans of past Fallout franchises.  
---
To suggest that only "true" Fallout fans are all fans of FO76 screams of somebody who hasn't been part of this franchise very long nor really understands what the Fallout games have always been about.  Like we get it, you're not really that much of a gamer and that's obvious by making such a statement in the first place.  But your whole argument seems to shit on people who have been Fallout fans obviously for longer than you've even been gaming.  It's ugly and it's toxic and you're part of the problem you pretend to be above when you wrote this post.
---
I just didnt like the ghetto gold teeth and chains part....wasnt lore related, it looked out of place.
---
I was debating the same thing and said fuck it, go for it. Burned all of my scrip and got nada.
---
Hit up west tek, robco and glatwoods for a week and youll have plenty
---
Ew...
---
My commando feels great with anti-armor faster fire, my rifleman likes instigating. Used Furious for a while, but anti-armor is more efficient all around. 
---
If you are a vats player, STALKER weapons can turn you into a critical killer: you aim for the head and hit every shot.
---
Damn that’s what I’m hoping to avoid. I haven’t tried the mystery pick yet, does it only drop 3*?
---
It would be fo sho
---
Yes, everything I got was 3*. Combination of armor, melee and ranged.
---
We always team up, so we are friends and on a team together and it still kicks him.
---
The whole 1st thing, the unlimited junk storage mostly.  That should be baseline, and they said forever it wasn't possible due to budget limits.
---
The way they've handled a couple things, sometimes flat out lying to justify changes (the 0 star legendary situation comes to mind).
---
I was about ready to give up with the hacking, they've been told for ages to fix the hole that was used this weekend, though I'll say that they got on it quick enough once it was an emergency, so they get a minor pass on that one.
---
Not a ton really, I'm overall pretty good with the game.  Hell, I'm closing in on 1200 hours, can't really complain a whole lot.
---
Lol I place mine to the South of the parking lot out the front door so no one gets messed with
---
Piece of advice: some heavy items can't be bulked, like gunpowder, circuits, silver, asbestos... and you would be surprised how much they weigh. 
---
If you have ammow weight reduction armor or perks, craft ammo and keep it on you.

I’m at 1097 hours and while your 1st criticisms (I don’t pay for it, but I’m not above it; I work a lot and this is the only game I play) don’t apply to me, I totally understand and respect your view on it.
---
It would be a mechanic they could add to the game to make it more interesting. Dump a bunch of Dog NPCs in West Virginia that you can recruit, but make it where each play can only recruit a Max of 3 dogs (1 Mongrel, 1 Junkyard, 1 Mutant Hound) but need to periodically feed them Canned Dog Food and/or make dog food from spoiled meat. Have each type of dog have their own advantages and disadvantages. Mutant Hounds able to carry the most weight, Mongrel have better damage resistance, Junkyard better scavenging (brings you scrap/junk). Only have one with you at a time and the others dismiss to your CAMP where they have a Defense Bonus. On Top of that I would add a Craftable Dog House where each one has its own Mini-Stash so that on top of them increasing your carry capacity, you can also store more. As for the Cat, I would have the Cat slowly add small things to you inventory, like Mole Rat Meat or small Junk items. Like how Cats IRL bring their owners stuff. I would still limit those to maybe two per player and not have the Cats be followers.

There is some irony in your post given your complete lack of understanding of scale.  Even 500 can be a few if the total number is much larger.   
---
Case in point US foreign aid is several hundred million dollars. But only constitutes 1% of total US yearly budget. So that several hundred million is literally the equivalent of a penny to the average person. So it is by definition a few.
---
&gt; Poor attempt at a troll 0/10, 
---
Irony so thick you could walk on it.
---
Yes, it does.  FO76 is a single player game.  Some online multiplayer was grafted in, which leads to exploiters being able to tell their single player based client "Hey, that thing over there is a container".
---
  That thing is a player, and this wouldn't happen in an MMO.  But FO76 isn't an MMO.

I don't need a reminder that you just make things up and pass them off as fact.

see thats the problem, you call it unacceptable and bad, when that is your opinion we can’t take it away from you but the rest of us disagree. and we are sick of the negativity. enough is enough... this was a very positive post and you just couldn’t say merry xmas and let it be, well wishes to the other wastelanders - you just had to try and bring it down. and then wonder why people call you a troll. 1.2k upvotes and climbing, a voice from the silent majority that are just enjoying the game and the community.  I still wish you a happy holidays, and if I see you in the wasteland I will drop you some love. merry xmas!

People on console don’t run into the same issues as PC users. Therefore I can’t have the same grudges as you and can subscribe to what OP’s posting. I’ve played FO for over a decade, and I guess that gives me the “street cred” to shoot your comment down. The games buggy, sure. But I grew up playing buggy games and frankly, it isn’t the end of the world if the game freezes and needs to be restarted, or if shit’s lost. Just another thing to add to a monotonous to-do list while escaping the monotony of life. 
---
Go make your own bitchy post and do what others do: complain and point fingers citing toxicity without pointing a finger at yourself for doing the same. You’re not an elitist because you’ve played the game longer than OP; you’re just a disgruntled fan with nothing better to offer than being bitter and callous.

Nope it was an invisible gutsy that shot assaultron lasers. It was in one of the mansions in the Ash Heap

I think it would be a good gesture to all of us who have been loyal to the game and still play, yes..

I can't imagine everyone knew about it. If I didn't read redit or YouTube and just loaded up the game I would have no idea

I really want to like the game and enjoy it, but I haven’t had much fun in it for a while. Any advice to spice up my play sessions?

I have only just got Fo1st due to the Incel Stash Stealers &amp; their exploit.

So my opinion doesn't really count, but I would be totally down with everyone else getting the the scrap box for free.
---
You can get it from Phionex - the BOS vendor in watoga. But even from vendors it’s $9500
---
Better off getting someone to just build the sign you want if you can’t afford it.
---
Don't worry about your cred chum people like that are struggling that's why they're here getting so upset at a positive post. They clearly create these "casual" personas to lay on people whom with they don't agree so that it justifies the negative outburst.  Just keep on keeping on.
---
Little? Wow must be nice to be you. even if you consider some issues little, the fact some exist since launch 1 year ago is some bullshit

I never said dupers were angels, I just said that server crashing dupes were made a non-issue months ago.
---
I tend to stay on top of the new dupes out, because I like to learn *how* things break. A few things me say the GM dupe wasn't actually a thing, first of all, server rollbacks just don't happen the way they did in the past. You autosave when an item enters/leaves your inventory.. point blank. Now, the GM could possibly affect this, yes, but as someone who is primarily a PvPer, dealing with GM multiple times a day and taking people out of GM with a bleedout syringe, NEVER has it made a server unstable, nuking doesn't either. So, I absolutely tried this with a few crafted pipe pistols and some friends and there was never any issue with server stability in the first place, so we didn't actually get to test it as extensively as I would have liked, because we couldn't get the server to crash..except for one time, when another friend was doing certain things at the same time in order to crash it.. and no dice.
---
There was never actual proof to this occurring, even though people would jump into a conversation swearing they've done it, they were never able to prove it or produce any type of evidence for it. 
---
(We crashed it in a private server, I don't like to screw around when checking server stability in public servers because I'm not an asshole)

Its a metaphor not a comparison, wow you really derailed this for semantics huh :P ?

Eh, for PvE I prefer a quad and for PvP a junkies, but it's an awesome one to start with and see if you like it.
---
It IS hard to get used to switching back and forth from a Tesla to a handmade, because with a Tesla you ALWAYS shoot at the ground or a wall (never direct hits) so at first when I would re-equip my handmade, I'd start shooting at the ground out of habit.
---
They get a TON of hate (I used to be so anti Tesla) but they are incredibly fun, especially when you get to watch them ripple through massive hoardes. Personally, I think they're great for both PvE and PvP, even though they are mainly categorized as a PvP weapon.

Yep-but the manner in which you get 1 shot can be cheating. Only a couple of weapons can do that-in addition to shooting grenades. Getting shot through a rock wall is cheating, for instance. Getting a head shot with a scoped lever is not.

I have a ghoul slayers Tesla that I will use to grind whitesprings. Everyone has their own style. I’m a non-automatic stealth sniper guy first so it’s just not my thing. Can be an awesome weapon though!!!
---
I have FO1st.
---
It should be available to everyone and they should actually put effort into what they offer FO1st members.
---
Exclusive cosmetics that are actually good.  Skin packs that look amazing.
---
Hell, even weapon and armor plans that aren’t available to people without FO1st (not god tier, but right in the mix in terms of stats).  And I said Plans so mama Murm can give us legendaries of them ala the fixer.
---
People would still flip a lid about the above but tough shit, at least then we wouldn’t have a competitive advantage over other players...just better looking stuff possibly.
---
Not sure bigger build limit in private is good.  What if you exceed it when moving to public for any reason
---
Well... I do adore this game, even with all of its faults, but those fast travel bugs, those client/server weapon hit registry bugs and that damn +250 DR continue to bother me (I have that legendary perk on one of my faves). 
---
Regardless, I discovered *a whole new world* running around with a Deathclaw Gauntlet and the associated cards. So that's a thing for me now. I don't know why I didn't try that sooner. :D
---
That sounds like fun.  I'm taking some time to walk the power lines and see what is hidden out there.
---
If they were to add the scrap box as available to every other player I would like it if first members could have double the camp budget. And also double the amount of limited items you can have in your camp. Example: currently you can only have 50 lights in your camp, with the first upgrade you can have 100 lights in your camp.
---
The Santatron is an extended free item.
---
Lately I've been running a pack Everytime I go to the monument by the palace of the winding paths
---
Which game in this genre does it right?  
---
It's weird you haven't been hired to fix Ark and FO76.  It sounds like a simple fix.
---
Its miles better then hdd
---
They slaughter these yao guais pretty fast too. It’s always fun to watch this spectacle
---
Oh, gotcha. They want you playing every day and not waiting til the last minute like some people did last time.
---
Usually the vote ratio will fix itself over time. You'll see a comment that's upvoted a lot and then underneath "Y teh downboats", while the comment is actually upvoted.
---
Just don't bother, people can vote and decide for themselves.
---
Didn't plan on waiting till last minute, but starting over after completing each challenge is really annoying
---
I wholeheartedly agree.  I expected problems but nothing of this magnitude.  I love the series and the game world and nothing else out there just has the same feel for me.
---
That sounds awesome.  This is my favorite event so far.
---
I mean, maybe. But it was pretty pointless in the end. And any person could have saved five days worth of daily quests to get it. So no, it didn’t set a horrible precedent. It was just..... fine.
---
Seemed like you did get worked up to me while reading it. Regardless there are defiantly nicer ways to spread awareness of a hack like this  multiple fallout youtubers covered the topic and it wasn’t prevented but the second a video gets released showing 500 players robbed and have every second post on the main subreddit are different users claiming they have been robbed it gets patched in 24 hours. So you tell me what was more effective? Unfortunately most people only respond to consequences and don’t have the foresight to react to possible consequences. As I’ve said before its better to bring problems into the open than sweep them under the rug. I’m just stating the facts...
---
I agree.  Sometimes the bugs are the best part of a game.  Sometimes they are the worst.  But a good world and good story really make up for it.
---
I didnt even notice it was gone 😂
---
Yeah, because that's the hill to die on here.
---
Crickets, Yaogui, Grafton Monster all drop acid. Crickets are the easiest ones to find farming methods for.
---
Kill an assload of mutants for powder. (Or make it if you got your acid on point. Cloth is easy to come by).
---
These were covered extensively here but they're the best ways.
---
Seriously?!
---
Still stalking me I see. Glad to know you are still obsessed with me and still incapable of actually addressing my arguments.
---
Make it free! Im a 1st, but the tent, ranger armor and free atoms was enough for me. Liberation!!!! Let them have infinite scrap space!!!!!
---
Well said. when the hack went live I was one of the victims and lost my Vamp Ultracite laser gatling and a fully upgraded set of power armor. I went from this role in chap 1  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)  to this role in chapter 2  [https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2](https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2) 
---
but even while the hack was live and before I started adjusting my story and creating the 2nd IMGUR  I came to the conclusion that legendaries are the root of all that's broken in this game. dupers dupe them, ebay sellers sell them hackers steal them pay to winners buy them and they break PvP completely. 
---
   So while the hack was still live I made some tweaks to my character and ran some silos in vanilla gear. other players showed up also running vanilla gear and we killed the queen as a community without legendaries. I found I like my new role so much better. I consider each legendary I scrap a small FU to the dupers sellers hackers and pay to winners. hackers cant really hurt or stop me any more "oh no I lost my easily replacable gear" 
---
the initial hit hurt but I am ready for whatever the next attack brings, delete my account i will buy another, delete my character, oh well I can be back to killing the queen in less than 2 days, I have the sytem down now they cannot stop me, now more than ever I am firmly in Beths corner this is my appallachia My community, hackers do not get to tell me what to play and what companies to support. and this community. you are all amazing and I am proud to be with you.
---
I heard there was an exploit where you could increase your budget with them. Never saw solid evidence of it though. That might be why?
---
Merry Christmas! I quit this game nearly a year ago but i’m still following this subreddit. Bethesda truly doesn’t deserve you guys :)
---
I hope you find some, or someone selling them!!! I still haven't found any, OR rare plans 😭
---
any number isnt ok... losing our whole inventory is a big deal, your best guns, armor, and ammo and meds... 
---
but ty for shutting the system down when you get to it, that will help keep people who are not in the know safe.
---
I remember reading your story in another thread.  I feel horrible for everyone who got hit by this.  I hope everything keeps working out for you and that one day maybe we will run across each other.
---
happens on PC as well it just really needs more time to load
---
I'm not. It's still fucking moronic to rant about people not being happy about how hard it is to get limited time gear.
---
Had to read this twice, I read merry hackers not merry, hackers. I agree. The hackers shouldn't be trying exploit the game, they should be trying to help fix it.
---
Must be a New Yorker.
---
Isn't that a basketball team?
---
Same! Its why i started a comunity outreach program for players 😊 im here if you need anything!
---
Amen
---
I wave and cast my shout of seasonal well wishes from another hill, as I have moved on (for now at least) but you carry on and keep having fun!
---
#BurnTheLegendaries I guess? 
---
Glad you're having fun :)
---
Like i said, little problems....its a videogame broheem, not real life.  Go outside for a little bit, breathe in that cool crisp air and relax!
---
It can be done in good fun. What if you go to a Camp and there is a switch that says “pull this” if you pull it and die in spectacular fashion I’d say that’s better than 99% of the actual “random encounters” in the game ;)
---
You see a dollhouse, I see Fallout Sheltee.
---
Thats we asked for this is what we got
---
These glitches are the sort that are a part of fallouts character I feel. There are deadly sins among the bugs, but not these. Sliding ghouls, tposes, and frozen enemies are part of the wtf that is fallout. 
---
I always enjoy finding a sitting and oblivious super mutant at grafton steel!
---
No it wasnt people wanted the items on display to look at before purchase beth thought this was good enough
---
It would be nice to maintain ownership of public workshops in my private world when I log off. By the time I get them all claimed and set up I’m done for the night never mind being able to collect the resources for any amount of time. But if I could come back the next day and it was all set the way it was before that would be great. Given it’s a private world it would act as an extension of my own camp. I don’t think any resources should be collected when I’m gone, they should just act like my camp and freeze in place.
---
At first it would be madness personally I would go to vault 76 and walk to a location grab everything then fatwalk to the next place until I reach my camp or the weight limit and fill that sucker full.Workshops might get more use because they can be more efficient then running around in empty locations that players stripped bare. Eventually the looting would settle down and scrap wouldn't be worth many caps because everyone already has thousands resources.
---
Nah.
---
Do they light up purple? Wasnt clear on atom store
---
Yes. I couldn't be bothered this time around, despite wanting the Winter armor paint.
---
The best way to get XP in NW is hiding, and it feels cheap to play cowardly just to get in the top 10 so you have a chance of getting enough xp to make it worthwhile.
---
[It Just Works!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPN0qhSyWy8)
---
Hit the mire  random spawns and ull get one eventually. Ran into 3 today, One mythical. Also queen of the hunt has netted me at least 7 over the last year
---
when buying atoms its actually cheaper to buy Fallout 1st but I can see where you are coming from and it would be nice if they added something more before they made the most over powered part of it available to all players
---
It is tho. Cowardice is more rewarding than surviving, and that's what needs to change.
---
I like it how all the sheep in here is pointing at the cheaters and blaming instead of pointing at BETHESDA and asking "what the f**k man, why is your game so broken still?"
---
Wake up and realise that the real culprit is Bethesda not giving a shit about you or your time/money.
---
I've long been on board with the idea that FO76 is basically a tech demo someone decided they should monetize.
---
It's an MVP with a "game" bolted on the top
---
All good.  I've been getting swarmed with notifications the last 3 or 4 hours.  No matter how old one of my posts is I always appreciate comments and ideas on them.
---
If your on ps4 i prob got an extra of them i could give u
---
Brilliant! Thank you!
---
I have my base in the toxic valley too! Not close enough but I do run into them a lot. I sometimes feel bad killing them unless they attack first.
---
Radstag horde + Butchers Bounty perk = Lots of meat to cook and sell!
---
I was fighting the queen bloodied meathook style when it happened to me. Got caught in the nukashine loop for about 15 minutes til I found a cliff to throw myself off of. Traveled back to the queen and still got loot off her. It was a pain in the ass but that’s what happens when you ride the shine brotherrrrrr
---
That's a sweet remote, where'd you get it?
---
I have 1st. I got it mostly for the Atoms, since I was already buying each of the $9.99 Atom bundles with the free outfits, I figured why not?  I don't really use my private world too much, as I miss the community, player vendors, events, nuke zones, etc., even though I play 95% solo.  Although private is nice right now for Santa farming.  
---
I 100% think both the tent and scrap box should be obtainable by everyone, as a quest reward.  They are really nice QOL additions.  If they want to take  those out of 1st and put something else in it's place, I'd love some Atom Shop exclusive C.A.M.P. stuff, outfits and skins.  Oh, and shared stash between characters would be nice.
---
maybe the whole point of 1st should be that you get features like 90 days early, then they go public rather than being paywalled forever. 
---
for instance right now we have the scrapbox and tent, then maybe that stuff become available to everyone and then subs get an ammo box and a super cool camp item for a season, then that stuff also becomes public. a "try it first" situation rather than the way it is now.
---
This community is amazing....im not a multi0layer fan but i have to be while playing this.  Kudos to all you positive guys out there.
---
You had an argument in that ramble about the US budget?
---
But you still have not addressed mine. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/dqsq8l/whats\_going\_on\_with\_fallout\_76\_on\_steam/f69odtn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/dqsq8l/whats_going_on_with_fallout_76_on_steam/f69odtn/)

You also haven't expanded to me why dog owners are lazy.

---
Even though the mods have deleted most of your comments.
---
At least we both now agree you're a bad troll.
---
I just think if it was pointless it wouldnt be in the game.
---
But the repair kits are waaay worse, Ill admit that
---
Been using the same weapon recently! It’s amazing if you sneak with it as well. You can one shot a lot of enemies, even high-level ones.
---
The only reason it's not fixed, is because Zeni/Beth doesn't care enough to spend enough money to fix it. Launch should have been cancelled, and it should have been an all hands effort to salvage it, with Starfield and Elder Scrolls put on indefinite hold.
---
Personally I find costumes from games set years later and stupid fucking fortnite dances far more immersion breaking....
---
It was a stupid idea and rightfully removed, but easily ignored.
---
I know a few who aren't... once i exposed their asses someone attempted to hack my email account...
---
Im on xbox
---
Merry Christmas brother!
---
Why does that still work?
---
Dude i love Tekken bro! Tekken Tag was my shit!
---
And get my nice holiday clothes all muddy?
---
The toxic valley is gorgeous. And lots of neat stuff to loot and always an event going on.
---
I cut'er loose after the last exploit, but Merry Christmas nevertheless! If Wastelanders is dope, i'll be back, but i already publicly denounced this game, and i truly believe it needs to be taken down and relaunched FFXIV style. Not a popular opinion here, but idc... the hacked/duped nonsense has just gone on too long.  But i hope you all have fun, take a lot of goofy photos and be careful! Idk if they patched that bs, but stay away from naked men with bad intentions!
---
That actually sounds more like your server was going offline.
---
I do, the community is by in large INCREDIBLE here, and i have the many photos to back that claim up. The housing is fantastic, you can personalize pretty much more than any other online MMO style game, the world is incredible, well crafted, fun to explore, and the FO4 loot and scrap formula has always been addictive.   
---
It's atmospheric, and it's FALLOUT! But i had to call it quits for now. I really hope they fix things up by Wastelanders. I'll just be logged in for the Santatron gifts and to use up the last 2 days of 1st.
---
inb4 downvoted to oblivion
---
Limitless scrapbox to everyone, but shorten stash capacity for non-subscription vault dwellers. 600 vs 800 fair enough.
---
\+ 100 lbs shared stash.
---
Its the truth, idc if i get down voted, butthurt ppl will be butthurt xD
---
I like ESO, but i don't play it for very long between breaks... idk it just has this... disconnected feel to it. 76 is still a Fallout game... ESO is, well it's not TES. Not really.
---
I hear ya, man. Happy holidays
---
I built my camp just south of the tree house village in the mire.  TP there and either follow the cliff or just walk straight south.  There is a lead deposit on top of the cliff near a ruined shack.  The trick is to place your C.A.M.P. module in a nook halfway up the cliff.  This puts the deposit on the edge of your build area as well as adequate water space.  If you put the C.A.M.P module on top of the cliff, you won't be able to reach the water.  The only down side, is the mirelurk queen spawn at the edge of the cliff.  But, as long as you don't have turrets within los, you won't agro it.
---
The plus side to this, is that you are walking distance from the purveyor, and set spawn locations for a handmade, combat rifle, and .50 cal, that I've been using to unlock mods with.
---
This game has been very LOUDLY beaten lol. It deserves it yes, but at the same time... the people who beat on it, almost never talk about the positives and i HATE that. It starts to feel like ragebait. I left a pretty scathing review of the game the other day... but i at least gave credit where it was due!   
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HQDM60DvGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HQDM60DvGM)   
---
Most of these guys just shout it down, don't even play the game, and their comments are full of the same bs   
---
"i didn't even buy this disaster and it's giving me entertainment" yeah exactly... you never played it, SHADAP lol.   
---
I can't hear criticisms from people who have absolutely no hands on.
---
I'm still waiting for my different colors for the neon letters..
---
Ohh sorry, my bad. 'Boah'!
---
What kind of meat do you like chally moo moo?
---
Yeah what the heck with that!? Lol. It's one of those things that annoys you, but you forget it quick, but then it annoys you again... and again, and again, and it's like uhhhh you going to have some new sales there fellas!? Or...
---
Lol, have this updoot.
---
Well, I dont have Fallout 1st and I was playing with a few more guys until the alert popped out, but I guess thats reasonable.
---
Nope, i cancelled this month lol. They lied about the discounts and i'm sorry but that exploit bullshit dude, even if i CAN dodge it in a private server... i can't support that shit. The tent skin is nice, but you unsub and you lose it anyways. Idk if you can even keep the emotes or the armor.
---
Make one an insulin needle.
---
Can i be honest? I fuckin hate vaults... i always have... cramped, ugly, boring, nothing but a maze of samey looking BULLSHIT. If they want to do raids going forward, they need instanced LARGE areas.
---
Yeah, it's not a first thing, it's a fallout  server thing...it happens from time to time when the server you're on is about to go down.
---
Just don't drink and drive.  
---
Silly me, there are no vehicles in the Wasteland.  
---
"I'm soooo gonna pilot that Vertibird while wasted!"
---
I just hear his squeaky little munchkin man voice every time. SixTEEEN times the detAYLLL.
---
I agree on retrospect.  Not so much space, but server resources when it's in public.  They almost need a Private house vs. Public house  buleprint which loads (good idea IMO) which can cause unrest in the FO76 community.
---
Hey just wait until the Piper outfit hits 1st and people lose their shit once more lol. PUT IT IN THE ATOM SHOP WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!1!!1! XD
---
Can't even scrap them for resources
---
The railway spike rifle will send spikes through multiple enemies
---
&gt; The "netcode" is shit. 
---
Shit is not the same as doesn't work. Learn the difference.
---
I mean dude... the survival aspects are so weak anyways most of us are wondering why even bother? Nah, wait for proper mod support for a TRUE survival experience, IF that ever happens. Their shitty attempt at survival shouldn't impede anything else, because it's largely a fail anyways.
---
Dude, take the win. No one likes a sore winner.
---
I mean we shouldn't hold a parade for the devs for fixing a problem that they're somewhat responsible for but we should encourage them when they do. This kind of post helps no one.
---
The sales largely suck... let's be honest. Items no one wants, or the price reduction is laughable.
---
More reason to up the daily scrip allotments
---
PC :(
---
What wall as are free ?! All of them are above 300 on Xbox
---
I agree completely. I had a round with 1300XP and 15 kills. More of my XP came from time survived and taking 1st than it did from the BATTLE portion of BATTLE ROYALE.
---
Exactly , 76 feels like a fallout ESO doesn’t feel like an elder scrolls. Feels like a generic mmo to me
---
True. I walk it back.  Buying into the hype.  No way BGS would let this happen. :)  I can't find the source I read it from. I did read it but no show is no go.  If Private gets hacked..... ;)
---
I love that mods have jumped on my ASS over here for much less than the bs you just said...
---
No worries
---
Yeah. Sucks all those PC players had to deal with such a shitty problem.
---
He's a jerk, forget him. Have a blessed holiday my dude.
---
Yes. Sorry. True Outer Worlds isn't multiplayer, but I'm pretty sure they could accomplish this much better.
---
Thanking them for fixing an issue and scolding them for (yet another) massive fuck-up that never should have happened to begin with are not mutually exclusive
---
If I break into your car, is it my fault or the car manufacturers?
---
That's like half of this shitty game's population
---
Acid: cave cricket horde, run the vault raid with crickets and just don’t progress, stay killing and collecting, glasses cavern, hemlock holes workshop.
---
Gunpowder:  needs acid and cloth.  Get cloth from doing collision course at the airport a few times.
---
Or
---
Get lucky like I did and buy it in bulk from a player vendor
---
Go for it.
---
Right now it is so much easier to grind up to the limit.
---
Best I got so far was vAmpires ffr 50cal with some vats improvement. Still hoping I'll be able to get something better. The scrip limit makes it hard.
---
There aren't any yet. Fallout1st lets you log into an empty server and invite up to 7 friends.. that's it. Maybe there is an RP 76 reddit or discord out there if you are looking for RPers. ? Hopefully, we can one day rent Private Persistent servers we can theme how we like.
---
If they made the scrap box public, then I would like them to add just one workshop bench. Don't care which one so long as I can scrap weapons and armor at it.
---
Well.. If he locks his car and you can still open the door by just using the handle, then it's the manufacturer's fault.
---
And that is the case here.
---
Horrible.  I don't participate in mob events as a stealth build.  I usually have an alternate card build for the character that is commando based (stealth but full auto goodness).  I share 80% of the perks, but swap out rifeman for commando. That's it.  
---
I use stealth rifle for looting and collecting resources. Love tunnels for stealth.  Low weapon maintenance (using 1/100 the ammo) and low armor maintenance (not taking damage).  So this is the leisurely shopping aspect of FO.. collecting junk most economically. Takes forever, but if you're in a sneaky mood, thoroughly entertaining.
---
I've run WestTek with my crossbow and suppressed 2 shot lever without damage.  Took FOREVER. Sneak. CAUTION. wait 3 mins. HIDDEN.  sneak kill Mutant.  CAUTION. hide. wait. etc....
---
My other build is tank heavy gunner (go figure) which just stomps through everything no prob.
---
Yeah, the servers go offline for maintenance automatically when the number of players reaches a minimum population.
---
I would like a work bench in my tent 🤔
---
I see, it makes sense. Thanks a lot! ^^
---
Keep strong buddy! We’re here and we believe in you.
---
Have seen this style before but they're always cool when you find them. Neato!
---
Camp budget increase
---
Scrip allotments shouldn't even exist in a paid game. It's essentially the same as energy bars in "F2P" (P2W) games.
---
I've been using "The Fixer" as a semi-automatic gun and cant complain about it, works really nice as a rifle for long - mid fights.
---
Me neither... No more camp budget I can spare. I’ve scraped all the things I considered to be not important. Yet still, cannot place anything anymore.
---
Well can't go wrong with the lever action. Tho depending on your build a bloodied lever action, handmade, hunting rifle can lay down some hurt.
---
Nah, not quite.
---
More like if the thief breaks the window and manage to hotwire the car because it lacks a proper immobilizer.
---
As i in all you ✊ thank you
---
Keep strong bro, everyone in the Fallout 76 community wishes you all  of the best this Christmas and even if you don't have an ideal Christmas, just know you'll log into the Appalachian wasteland and you'll be encountering potential new friends out there who may have just gotten the game and today. 
---
Keep your head up, we're all here
---
I think renaming this game 'Shameful Experiences &amp; Missed Opportunities' would be the best thing that could happen to it.
---
I paid for a game. I got what i want.  Its not about fo1st
---
This makes me so happy. I absolutely love it. I’ve had a tough time this holiday as it’s my first one since my ex has our kids...my fist Christmas not waking up with them 😪 will definitely be logging in some hours in Appalachia..take me home country roads
---
It's supposed to be an accomplishment that you truly earn, but a lot of people expect it to be a handout. Think of it as a trophy for the best of the best, and it will be easier to understand why it's so hard to earn.
---
Happy Christmas to you!  🎅
---
It's the lever. You need to put a rank into gun fu and ranks in adrenaline to make it fully shine.
---
Player vending for sure.  But you forgot... The Backpack.  I'd also add Nuclear Winter, Pioneer Scout quests, and holiday events.
---
Okay, you convinced me. I am getting one.
---
But.. they are saying the truth.. they didn't said that you can't craft it again. They just said that the item you get by purchasing could have been stolen.
---
And even if the devs are doing the best to fix this whole mess... it's still unbelievable what BGS delivered... Cause this big exploit was only possible cause of the client is able to tell the server what to do.. there was/is no servercheck..
---
I've got a place staked out for my next camp, or sometime in the future camp, but I'll share it. If you're at Lucky Hole Mine, and go to the top of the Mountain where there's another part of the Monorail; then head toward Spruce Knob/Huntersville, eventually you run into this "natural bridge" feature that overlooks the Fissure Site there. There's space under the bridge you *could* build in, but if you climb up on top of the bridge and cross it, it ends in a sort of alcove  that you could set a camp into. I guess you would have some issues with water and crops, but it would be a cool spot for a camp.
---
Merry Christmas mate , hope to see you in Appalachia!
---
I was recently comparing my lever gun to my Gause Rifle and came to the conclusion that i prefer the lever gun because it takes up less of the screen in first person. Seems to have faster fire rate, less weight, better accuracy, and faster reload. Bullets can be reloaded one at a time and doesn't have to charge to be fired. The levergun seems to be more accurate with aiming or vats than the gause. The ammo may be the only con. Because .45 can be used up fast in your other guns that use the same ammo type. 2mm EC is cheaper to make and is only used in the gause.
---
Yes
---
They are leaving out crucial facts that change the story
---
They deserve it. I’m a 1st member and wouldn’t mind if they handed the scrapper out free to everyone after this latest round of guff. We still got the tent 😊
---
Exactly. It's not right at all
---
What is changing the story? O.O the story IS that the items you bought were stolen. (At least the poor souls who where affected)
---
That you can craft them again with the plans is another story. They simply don't have to put all infos in it. And so it isn't misleading.. it would be nice if they included that information too - yes. But most of them aren't playing anymore and so just using the informations they find on reddit and co.
---
The day the hack went puplic i didn't read a single comment about that you can get the items back cause you still are able to craft them..
---
It's a bit like buying an old Alfa Romeo... :P
---
You deserve everything, merry Christmas to u and to your whole family too! (hope you didn't ask for atoms tho as we don't want to support scummy bethesda)
---
Those challenges are designed to reward hardcore, dedicated NW players with exclusive rewards. They aren't meant for everyone. Anyone trying to earn those is trying to compete with the best players in the game mode. It's like trying to compete in the Olympics and realizing that it's hard.
---
You're a legend, ad victoriam brother
---
You can craft repair and scrap kits now? When did that change?
---
The point isn't that you can craft it again easily. The point is that it was possible these items were so easy to steal (together with other gear which aren't easy to get) and the point that there is/was no check from the server. The law suit topic is going a bit too far in my eyes too. But even they working on fixing a lot of things you can't complain about things who didn't are true. Like the 16x details promption, that the pryden could be spawn.. the junk limit where they told us it is impossible and now fo1st members can get it and so on.
---
I still hope that BGS are finally getting all these things fixed.. but who knows?
---
I play both ways, and agree it sucks when you get a bunch of kills but only a few hundred points or zero kills, finish second and get 500+.   I determine how I play based on my teammates, if they hide I hide, if they go gun blazing , I go along for the ride too.  
---
There is no easy solution to this problem...even if they adjust the scoring.  My two cents
---
Bro I appreciate your opinion and playing devils advocate but this issue is about the people who claim they are "covering the game" that refuse to give every fact and instead echo the same shit that everyone is saying to cash in on a quick vid. Its beating a dead horse. I'm not saying they're wrong for covering it because it is a big story but at least pretend you know how the game works and what exactly is happening. Its like they read a headline then push record instead of looking at the sub and identifying the issues and covering it in an educated and constructive way.
---
They did this same thing back when the Power armor mold issue was taking place, blaming Bethesda and jumping to conclusions at first glance claiming Bethesda made hazardous helmets when in reality it was another company and only 10 helmets were sold then not even making a follow up video saying they were misinformed. Having people who had the Regular non hazardous helmet unaware they were fine.
---
Heathen's Greetings.
---
Who the fuck actually buys repair and scrap kits?? I use the improved and FREE kits from actually playing the game. Plus I'm not lazy that I need to press a button to store my stuff. If you had Scrap kits wiped then you're obviously a big spender so I'm sure you can afford more. I'll stick with the free and better alternative.
---
Like amy of the crap on reddit reaches the devs anyway.
---
I remember all the videos that popped up about thousands of players targeting FO1st subscribers and destroying their camps, even tho the game mechanics don’t allow you to do that too easy, all because one guy on reddit made a post about it that I’m pretty sure was meant in jest.
---
To be honest I don’t care what some 1cent per click try hard on you tube says, I really enjoy the game and have never had any issues, bugs etc... that have prevented me from playing the game. 
---
The thing that is most annoying about them is the amount of people who have never played 76 that are then driven to forums like this to ask the “why do you play this game” question and argue that the game is unplayable when it is clearly very much playable via the thriving trading and social community.
---
pEoPle sTiLL pLaY dIS gAm?? 😂
---
Gamertag?
---
Happens a lot, you don’t always get max level weapons when you reach level 50 and upwards...
---
Naff i know!
---
Oh, so it didn't change then and you were incorrect. I see.
---
You know what I find funny is your adventure mode xp is always higher then your overseer xp
---
FYI Bethesda didn’t sell the helmet. The license was bought by I think game stop as far as I remembered so it was never a BGS product. I’m pretty sure that was covered in a juice head video shortly after the news broke. But yes, BGS should be more careful with the products they license but I can only assume game stop have a good reputation and have licensed products with Beth in the past.
---
You’re too green for the fog! If you knew anything about the game you were playing at all, this kind of behavior shouldn’t bother you to a point it’s ruining your day. Come on. The fallout universe is fucked yo. To see somebody trolling like this should be the east of your worries. 
---
Just trying to say it really isn’t that bad. Over talking about reporting the damn guy...jeez
---
Or them saying the hackers could spawn in fallout 4 Preston Garvey, last time I checked that's not the Minuteman Preston, it's the one from that video Bethesda released
---
Thanos would be all up in their business like "Why are you cutting in on my territory"?
---
This game gets a lot of hate but the community is great, I’ve asked for help many times and everyone’s been happy to give it, the game wouldn’t be as good if it wasn’t for this community.
---
Merry Christmas to you all
---
just use radshield, thats its.
---
You can sprint without AP consumption after all fast travels until 15s or so, that said...
---
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!! Fellow 76er
---
I'm no mathematician, but he yoinked around 40 players inventories in about 8 minutes. Assuming this isn't edited for time (I'm sure it is, but I'm not giving that asshole any views or watch time), it would be incredibly easy to steal from over 500 people in a 4 or 5 hour game session.
---
Lol no. I can live without atoms. Merry Christmas friend!
---
Merry Christmas dwellers!
---
I've got a zealots prime automatic fixer that fucking shreds when I respect for commando. I reserve it purely for sbq fights though since it goes through a ton of ultracite 45 and I haven't gotten a steady flow of stable Cobalt yet. It's a great combo since you're basically doubling down on that affix
---
Bloody hunting rifle is the best sniper rifle I’ve come across. 
---
That said a bloody stealth commando build is easily better and more versatile.  I have a bloody FFR combat rifle and have a short scope on it so I can still snipe if I want to and it one shots almost anything...then absolutely melts mobs of enemies and scorchbeasts and, well, anything if I let her rip.
---
Or if it didn't cover up quest starters.
---
Every home is dysfunctional in a way. This is our home away from home. Not perfict but we chose it 😊 fallout 4life
---
The game is fun?
---
♥️ Merry Christmas Red!
---
Are you an actual shill? Seriously, this is some cringe worthy crap. The hack was monumental for PC users (I’m just glad I am on PS4). Not only that but the game has been limping since launch. And you defend it and the devs? I love Fallout 76 and have logged 1000 hours just about, but I’m not an idiot. The game is relentlessly mediocre, even Fallout 4 was better despite the stupidity of the plot and the terrible voice acting. It never ever should have been multiplayer.
---
The concept of people having fun with video games infuriates some people, doesn't it?
---
From what I can tell that's related to the fix for mobs becoming Ash /goo piles. They instead are a placeholder mob(what you see as headless enemies) until they're called to respawn due to a new load of the cell or their timer. Not sure why they have to appear so creepy but it at least makes me feel a little better about clearing places with my ts tesla
---
I've probably burned about 50k on wrap easy. Maybe more, actually. I wish there was a purchase/sale history log
---
Hopefully someone drops you a nice care package. That's what I try to do haha. Try to stick to the Forest area to start. Fun places to go are: Point Pleasant, Sutton, Arktos Pharma, Helvetia, Morgantown (definitely check out the airport) and Tyler County Fairgrounds. For about another week these areas might have Santa themed enemies that will drop presents! These will help you get started by gifting you plans, alcohol, and food to help get you started. Plus all that sweet XP
---
Using primed Z25 gatling for SB/Q; it shreds.
---
Take your time, explore, kill, loot, scrap, craft and enjoy. There is no need to get through the main quests as quickly as possible.
---
I love this game
---
Yes as other said Endurance is what determines your draining rate of ap when sprinting( i mean the name endurance is not there to signify your eye sight...).
---
That said i can tell that when i use bloodied(which doesn't have effect on END) my ap bar goes down ultra slow and i can run and jump for days. I don't know if it's just because i have many more ap points.
---
Think you were very unlucky, I've always got level appropriate items
---
Merry Christmas sister!
---
You see, 1. They don't hate you, they want money. 2. Like other guy said mby the game is fun for people. You don't need to pay for fallout 1, you don't need to buy skins or anything like that. Yeah there are scrap boxes and the other ones but in my opinion it's stupid  to buy them because felling that oh will my gun last long enough for this fight is more fun and part of the game rather than just pup fixed. You can find game for really cheap and for that it's worth it. I bought it and had fun, probably will in the future too, but I didn't pay any more than price of the game witch was really low when I got it but can't remember exact number. Is it that hard to realize that someone could enjoy the game?b
---
That was nearly a decade ago and if I’m not mistaken possibly peer to peer, we’re in 2019 and the game has dedicated servers, this shouldn’t be an issue
---
SSD will solve 90% of the games loading issues. I load into the game at my camp up by deathclaw island and my camp is maxed. It's a floating camp above the water but it fully loads in in 5 secs. Enemies load in immediately. I can fast travel to SBQ from any part of the map in 10-15 secs and all enemies + players will be already loaded in. Whitesprings is still notorious though as like other people mentioned. It's just not nearly as bad. You load into the building faster and items will be laying about but no bots will be there until 7 or 8 secs have passed since you could move.
---
He didn't get affected so he's shilling liberally. I'm pretty sure people that got royally shafted wouldn't agree with his cringe
---
I suggest you not listen to co-called Youtube experts; i have doubts about their education. Listen to victims and developers (of course it would be sweet for Bethesda to speak with people often).
---
Dont lickem n drivem 😂 be safe!
---
My friends list is empty, just my mule.
---
Just a reminder this is because of all the New Vegas fanboys on r/Fallout and YouTubers like YongYea, ManyATrueNerd, Internet Historian, and Skill Up who thrive off controversy and hate for their content.  They let trolls and hacker know the best way to get attention is to jump on the hate bandwagon for 76 and attack the community.  We've always had to deal with trolls and haters who obviously don't play the game, from people flat out lying about bugs/patches to making a mountain of a molehill like the refrigerator where everyone who actually played 76 knew 50% spoil for food was worthless (there's a perk that does it at 90% slower and no one uses it) but they either ignorantly or purposely lied to make it sound like a true Pay2Win feature.
---
They've actively been encouraging and enabling these people from day 1 because this is the game to attack if you want to be the star of your own video.
---
Hey I just wanted to thank you for working on Christmas day. It's often a thankless task, but I'm sure your fellow cuntfaced trolls are grateful that you've stepped up so that they can have the day off and recharge their bile ducts. Good on you.
---
Murry Christmas
---
What do you mean be safe do I sound like the kind of person to do something so irrational.
---
Management: ok Dev, we have this deadline, i need you to finish this in 2 days
---
Dev: but this is one weeks work
---
M: deadline
---
D: *thinking* ok i better shut up and keep this job
---
Despite the issues, there's an enjoyable and unique experience to be had. 
---
Why else would people play it?
---
Yep, I'd like my 700 hard earned atoms back!
---
Irrational simply irrational 🤣
---
This wasn't done with CheatEngine AFAIK. It uses [ReadProcessMemory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-readprocessmemory)
---
Server not responding.
---
My main character is over 200 and has not started main quest, so much to explore and do, take your time no need to rush. Hope you enjoy yourself.
---
Thank you bro , you to!
---
That's what I call a proper shill. If you're good at something never do it for free my man. Get in touch with some PR firm.
---
Just because this hack was a minor inconvenience to your play time doesn't mean it wasn't a big deal. People who have been trading for months lost everything and there's no way to properly compensate them. Bethesda knew about this for a while now yet they choose to ignore it till shit hit the fan. I'm not into circlejerking and but fuck shills like you who skew the community feedback.
---
Thank you!
---
Best of luck in the wasteland vault dweller. And Merry Christmas
---
You too!
---
On PC you say? Can't tell if this is serious or a shitpost.  Either way Merry Christmas!!
---
Very serious! Merry Christmas!
---
Server hop at Toxic Larry's Meat and Go for the three Snallygasters that spawn, and hit up Collision Course for a bunch of cloth
---
Agreed. The game isn't always great but it's probably the best community I've encountered in years of online gaming
---
Put in a ticket, they’re usually quite good at returning atoms for purchase made in error.
---
Well you got me there. Have a lovely Christmas. Make sure to commit massive tax fraud. Buy gold bye.
---
You can! You have to place a wall and then put wallpaper on it
---
I cant even work a smart phone right 🤷‍♂️ Merry Christmas!!!
---
Worst part is that if you try and call them out for some of their bullshit you just get hated upon and called a “Bethesda shill”
---
I would help but I’ve tried helping people with it before didn’t work.. I recommend the cranberry bog during the scorchbeast queen.
---
That's not autism. Please don't spread misinformation to support your jokes.
---
Why? The people watching those videos don't play 76, so why should they play 76 to make sure they're not spreading lies or BS? Their entire channels and videos rely on misinformation and hyperbole.  Just look at ManyATrueNerd's super "in-depth" look at 76 when he gets so much shit wrong because he's an idiot or is just bad at the game like saying repair kits don't drop in game, or that you NEED repair kits to do Vault 94 because he failed to do it with his level 28 friend so it must be purposely impossible.
---
Most of the people who actively hate and shit on this game have never even played it and are just regurgitating what they heard from a YouTube shoutman or a Reddit troll.  They don't care about reporting true news, or fact checking. They have no journalist credentials or went to school for it.  They make clickbait videos on the internet.  I mean, just look at how many people don't even know you have to pay for private servers in every other online game.  I get this might be their first online game ever so they never played Ark, or Rust, or DayZ and don't know how private servers work, but they sure talk like it's bog standard to get those for free.
---
I want nothing tbh
---
Everyone should get it for free or at least a free version with another 800 weight cap only for junk.
---
The Olympics are designed to allow the best of the best to compete and reward them for their efforts. Olympians get swag (medals) and recognition when they win.
---
Nuclear Winter is a competitive game mode. The rewards on that game mode are the swag, and they are also the recognition. Those of us at the top don't want to see EVERYONE walking around with the equivalent of an Olympic gold medal. If you want to earn the gold medal, be prepared to work your butt off for it. It's not a participation medal.
---
Merry Christmas, Matey. May your Travel be safe though life and Appalachia.
---
Happy Christmas, vault dweller. Keep a eye out for enemies called Scorched dressed in Santa outfits or blue snowflake suits. They drop gift boxes and nice gear for you.
---
Oh, okay then. Have fun with the game in that case.  I've gotten lots of hours of entertainment out of it personally.  Like others have said, look for enemies dressed up for the holidays over the next few days to get some good gear and make your early levels a little easier.
---
I thought when bethesda took this out we never talk about it again.
---
I hated these because it blocked the bulletin board to start the nukashine quest, sheepsquatch quests, etc in some train stations.
---
Mothy Lootmas!
---
Like more addons to the 50 cal. Therrs only two mods for the 50 cal. Heavy barrel and prime receiver.
---
A lot of weapons can one-shot you. A handmade can one-shot you.
---
I recognize you from Xbox NW. There are no cheats that enable you to be one-shot on Xbox. There are no cheats that allow you to be shot through a wall in Xbox. I'd welcome you to post a video showing you being shot through a wall.
---
Merry Xmas from Oz my brother. Stay strong. The sun always follows the moon.
---
Only here once buddy, enjoy the ride because the destination sucks! Don't over think things just live. Merry Christmas.
---
haha, someone must be really hating you for getting such a bad gift xD
---
&gt; the story IS that the items you bought were stolen
---
Well, no.  Outside the special case of repair/scrap kits what you've bought is the plans.  They could not steal the plans.
---
In fact theft of "atom shop items" is the least bad part of this hack, theft of legendaries and rare items is what hurts, but the clickbaiters don't understand the game so they don't know that.  Also mentioning the atom shop gets instant outrage points.
---
Let me know if you need help.
---
I mean, it's math. You can work it out. These numbers are available online.
---
I duped... I spawned in items... But people who did things like this are just straight up jerks. Even people like me didn't want too touch that hack with a 10 ft pole
---
Remember to pick up your free santatron in the atomic shop before it’s gone!
---
I have a zealots primed FFR Lmg and it rips the queen apart and chews through ammo, its satisfying when you can actually see her health bar tank when you shoot her though.
---
What are you talking about? I’ve never had this happen. Clearly a bug.
---
It's an every day battle I'm too familiar with amigo. Know you are not alone and take care. Have as good a day as possible - peace.
---
The goal is to survive; killing 10 people means nothing if you die
---
Not in workshops, you don’t get the option for wall paper even after you place the wall like you do at your camp.
---
Weird
---
Cheers mate
---
You know, I'm always hating on this game because of bethesdas antics with it, but man it seems like it has a really wholesome community about it, almost makes me wanna give it a try... almost lol.
---
Some of your question gets into guessing and assumptions. Is it about EASE OF USE? I don't think Bethesda has ever said that. Bethesda has said that the Creation Engine allows them to create these expansive worlds that are brand icons. They've always spoken of how customizable the engine is and how much they can build with it. The ease of use has never been a reason for using it.
---
Some games released in 2018/2019 were more detailed and performed better. Some were not more detailed or did not perform better.
---
They never said junk limit was impossible. Go back and look at what they’ve said.
---
Most of these people don't actually play the game so they know very little about it (and to be honest a lot of people playing probably don't know either) coupled with the fact their channels are based around shoveling outrage for ad views/clicks means you're getting anywhere from 10 to 100 percent bullshit
---
I'm not a very religious man, but I'm pretty sure those kinds of YouTubers are going to have a terrible afterlife for being such deceptive douches. I sometimes accidentally start watching some of those videos, honestly the only thing you can do is hit dislike and leave the video.
---
Bad shill. Genuinely embarrassing for the rest of the players.
---
How could a shit game engine bring so much pain to people.....
---
Super mutants and bugs
---
Good luck and have a blast!
---
Treasure maps
---
Kinda ironic since it's holiday season... But yeah, no freebies this week, not even another lousy striped wallpaper
---
There is more to explore than it seems.  Follow questlines, explore on your own, join events, build a base and set up a shop.  There's so much to do before the chasing high level loot and builds.  I'm lvl 90 and I still have no idea what I'm doing and have a lot of the map to explore.
---
It’s not the fact that the xp runs consecutively that’s the issue, it’s the total xp required. Anyway this is why the event was 3 weeks long vs 1
---
Sigh .. can’t fast travel, fast weapon switching works almost never, getting shot when trying to emote switches to the favourites wheel, speed demon stops working when i fast travel.  I won’t buy fo 1st until some of those are fixed, they are too fundamental and bloody annoying
---
I’m 250+ and mumbles regularly gives me level 36 weapons and armour....
---
Guess I’ll have to log a ticket. Shes been doing it since she opened....
---
The fast travel thing is fucking infuriating.
---
Sorry.
---
I got zealots prime gatling gun and i can kill a scorchbeast within a few seconds.
---
Up the limit to at least 300.
---
Powering up a powerplant still won't register.
---
SBQ kill doesn't register.
---
Grognack the Barbarian magazines (got all 10 checked but it still says 9)
---
Attacks from gouls in sleeping mode. Hilarious.
---
Good lord this is hard to read. Grammar dude!
---
I have always said I will spend money when the game comes out if beta lol
---
I think a scrap box with limited storage might be amazing.  Remembering my non fallout 1st life in this game, I was only able to carry about 100 of each junk if I wanted to also hang on to weapons, armor, outfits and ammo.  So a free version with maybe 400 to 800lb limit I would call fair, and still keep the incentive for fallout first
---
They had the aluminum trees in the atomic shop. I just used one of them after realizing the oversized redwood I bought earlier.
---
What I don’t understand is why people keep comparing it to fallout 4, like 76 is a way different fallout and I for one was glad to hear 76 is multiplayer I like fighting deathclaws with my friends it’s fun just because it’s not what you remember from the previous game they hate it
---
What’s wrong with it ?
---
Now if Bethesda ever takes a day to develop a text chat option in-game we can talk to each other :)
---
I love the fact that Fo76 is multiplayer and I really was against the circlejerk when it was announced. I still love the game but Bethesda doesn't seem to care the slightest about it and running it only to milk whales.  People like that turd of OP are the reason why this game won't improve to become what it deserves to be.
---
People ask why, why do you still play this game that is so wrong? This, this shit right here. Bethesda's actions are unfortunate at best, unforgivable at worst, but this community... you can't beat it.
---
Don’t get me wrong the game is far from perfect but at least give them credit for trying to make a change, they could have just said fuck pc players and not patch the game and go spend time with there families but they didn’t I’m assuming and pushed out a patch for it I’d say they deserve a well done for that. I’m actually optimistic in what they will do next in 76
---
The goal is to have fun playing games means nothing if you dont enjoy it and I cant believe anybody seriously enjoys hiding in a bush for 20 mins
---
Incorrect info here. Blueprinting DOES NOT save inventory. The only way you can keep the inventory is if you move camp and place them down from the stored blueprint.  It must be the stored blueprint for this to work.
---
merry christmas to you, as well!
---
A Refund!!
---
1 cap each for .38? What a rip off.
---
It wasn't peer to peer.
---
The game is rushed, no doubt about it.
---
It's also outsourced to a newly acquired gamestudio with no prior experience with the engine, and they had 4 guys from ID Software retrofit it for multiplayer.
---
The top devs are no doubt assigned to The Elder Scrolls.
---
We are beta testers, and if you can accept that and enjoy the otherwise excellent and beautiful world, you'll have a great time.
---
I notice the trend of certain people who whine and complain about the game.
---
They're racing to max level and grind for hours on end to get some silly glitched out build that'll eventually end up fixed, at which point they'll be on reddit and / or YouTube spewing their vitriolic bile.
---
They'll have a horrible glitched to shit floating monstrosity as a camp, with 20 odd waterpurifiers.
---
We get it. You don't really like the game. Move on?
---
You've missed a lot, but hope you have fun friend.
---
It was only like 20 bullets and I gave him more for free don’t really use it anyway 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Do they glow purple? The main picture made it seem like they were purple neon but the screen shots didn't look the same.
---
&gt;The level of hate for this game in the general gaming community isn’t something I’ve ever experienced before.
---
I haven't seen the level of hat FO76 gets since... Mas Effect: Andromeda. People shit on it so hard EA/ Bioware canceled all DLC and shutdown BioWare Montreal and moved the staff into EA.
---
I am tired of people attacking people for liking things. Just because somebody likes something that isn't popular they get labelled a shill.
---
Fuck that. Is my enjoyment of a thing hurting you? No? Then fuck right off.
---
Wait do they have any other color options or just purple?
---
Bloodied Grognak's  =  Ol' Choppy
---
Bloodied Prime Railway  =  Ol' Choo-Choo
---
Quad Shotgun  =  Ol' Shooty
---
Troubleshooter's 10mm  =  Ol' Bang-Bang
---
I hate to use the term "Fake news", but that's literally what YouTube has become.
---
And you'll have gullible people gobbling it up like a Christmas turkey.
---
Honestly the scrap box has change how I play the game. I've gone back to Fallout 3/4 style looting where I pick up EVERYTHING. This has led me to explore every nook and crany and even do more events.  It feels like a different game to me and I've found a lot of easter eggs that I might not have found when I was objective focused.  I feel like this is saying a lot for a guy with over 1200 cumulative levels.
---
MAKE SCRAPBOX FREE FOR EVERYONE!
---
My gamer tag is the same as my reddit name.
---
I love how he's trying to prove a point that doesn't matter. Like, at all.
---
Any one gets a Gatling or LMG With zealot hit me up!
---
It's the *Shining*. And I think it's really obvious given the name Torrance is the family's name in the film
---
Oh thanks I'll correct it
---
My alts are scripping them
---
If only you loved punctuation too.
---
Thanks bro , ill drop you an add
---
Jesus my bad didn’t know everyone in this forum was such a grammar nazi
---
Wait the bush hiders never said the goal was to have fun. My goal hiding in the bushes is to unlock a bunch of items that never should have been locked to that one specific mode in the first place. Camp building item unlocks require playing NW? Yeah because those are a very important item to use in the battle Royale mode.
---
But I do absolutely agree that bush hiders should turn team fill off and I always feel like a jerk if I forget.
---
I hear you there. Merry Christmas. I wish you all the best.
---
Enjoy! Please ask on here or check the wiki if you have any questions, there is a lot of stuff in this game. 
---
You're joining at a good time, as the big free update adding human NPCs and other content should be coming in the early part of next year!
---
1. It is per world. Believe part of the trigger is s world with only a few players.
---
2. It's safe to change worlds, the only way to keep playing is to change worlds. Everybody jumps servers at some point to look for events, nukes or better vending worlds. No difference doing that then leaving s world due for maintenance.
---
3. Not sure how long it takes
---
Have fun with all the hackers that steel your shit by looking at you!
---
You should get an amount of xp for the amount of damage you do bonus for killing or downing.
---
I have one but there are ways to get out if you use creativity and i dont steal junk
---
Best experience? I had many with this game, playing alone or with some random guys, but If I have to pick one.. I'll go with this one.
---
A long time ago I was going fast travels to camps, just to check guns and armors since  I was a low level player, until one of those camps had a nice guy (Owner of the CAMP) waiting there to check people and greet them, he saw how shtty was my entire armor and guns, so he dropped to me some armors and 3 guns for free, I still carry one of them which one is a (Two Shot + Explosive Bullet) Combat Shotgun. He gave me as well a clean spacesuit since I was using the dirty one, and more stuff like a Scout Gas Mask that I love a lot. He even moved to my CAMP to buy some stuff with over-rated prices.
---
I dont remember that player anymore, but I still save the stuff that he gave me as a treasure, not inside that stash, just with me. 
---
That was one of the stories that keeps me playing this game, you have people stealing your Santatron, but you will always have people with a strong heart like that one guy.
---
Dont look bad at low-level players checking your CAMP shop or even using it, you were like him once.
---
rule 1 - people are stupid
---
76 is a fallout 4 world expansion. Same engine, code and assets. That being said yes, it was garvy, but not in his clothes iirc. 
---
I love 76, and I'm finally getting close to level 200, but facts is facts. 
---
Also I may bought all the dlc and courier stash last night for new Vegas to do a fresh run threw
---
Yes, they said they cannot raise it cause of critical server stability problems but they will look into it.
---
They tried the best and doubled the space you got till now. And unlimited storage for fo1st members.
---
I just made a new character and ran around screaming with a pipe gun everywhere with my friends new characters was tons of fun - we over ran a lvl 50 3 star sheepsquach with 8x lvl 7 players in a swarm laughing the entire way

I mean seriously what was the hacker going to do ? steal my pipe rifle? \*\*looks down at the piles of pipe rifles in every corner of every lvl 5 scorch area\*\*
---
Coal would be a better gift.
---
Thank you very much! Merry xmas my dude.
---
Do you have mutation. If so that may be why.
---
Merry Christmas &amp; it wasn't a dumb question if you or someone else learned from it :)
---
Good for you man. The gifting of the oil at least, honestly .38 is the least valuable ammo in the game. I've been helping people lower lvl than me since probably when I was your level. Things like that are what keep people playing even with the games poor performance lately.
---
Turrning em into wee giblets. Trading.
---
What are you eating because I believe a certain mutation negates all benefits of meat based foods or veggie based foods like herbivore or carnivore
---
I have a ZE Gatling in my vendor for 10k now along with around 3k rounds ultra 5mm @2 per.  On pc.
---
Well given the responses my zealots is getting a prime receiver for Christmas.
---
😁👍😉
---
Simpsons agree... https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/d/db/The_Shinning.jpg
---
I sell or scrip the heavy ones, give away some and hold onto the light 3* ones to scrip one day at a time.
---
Accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative buddy. Merry Christmas!
---
Yea any ammo I don’t use I highkey just sell for 1 cap and the Player vendors was such a great idea for this game makes it fun
---
Difficult to say briefly what legendaries go for what! I’d saw look through posts on 76 marketplace and get an idea of what people are looking for, having said that it can be a bit of a mystery sometimes! 
---
Some things to look out for are unyielding, bolstering, vanguard’s armour, especially with AP and sentinel, cavalier, wwr, or sneak.. although wood unyielding AP sneak would be great to! 
---
Weapons with junkies and bloodied, especially with FFR, other good prefixes like AA, instigating, and furious. 
---
The assault rifle you have would be scrip to me but maybe someone would give some caps for it, the vampire FFR tesla may well go for quite a lot, a bloodied or quad FFR tesla would be extremely valuable, vampire not so much but still good.
---
Yes because br is boring in any game.
---
That was what I thought of as well.
---
we actually made a game out of it - we made new characters and ran up to lvl 20-40s and told them our gear had been taken if they wouldn't mind anything they could spare - all of the people even ones without mics that could hear us immediately tried helping us in some way at which point we would stop them one of our high lvls would run over and give them 100 or so Christmas gifts for being a good community member 
---
One lvl 20 100% new from getting the game was so nice about it he basically was going to hand us the items he was actually using so we got him a ton of stuff as a special thanks for being awesome.
---
Do people never look at the promo pics for the items they buy?!
---
Yeah I didn't pay much attention to it either
---
Yes, primed Zealots puts the hurt on everything at SBq runs.  These days I like working the mobs and find I can easily get my sbq tag in and crowd control from my primed FE handmade.
---
You should try circlejerking you might like it 😉
---
I hope all is well in your corner of the wasteland
---
im pretty sure bos armor is better
---
Been an issue since beta. Better and worse here and there from patch to patch.
---
Bos combat armor is better, but if you like the look of raider then you probably won't notice any difference in actual gameplay &amp; raider will be cheaper to source legendary versions.
---
Yeah I was wondering why they’re called giant...
---
Can't correct the title, thank you very much tho.
---
few early days tips 
---
Switch pacifist to on in settings - thus helps you in major ways - 1 people can't hurt you (except workshops) in pvp - 2 you don't accidentally shoot someone who believes your out to get them - and 3 it gives you a lot more confidence to meet and interact with players since you know they can't hurt you meaning you will be more relaxed and find new friends faster 
---
can do (luck perk) is awesome - walk up to certain containers 40% chance of finding food water all kinds of stuff - go to white springs and hit up all the trash cans boom days worth of food. Doesn't spoil and is good for caps.
---
Merry Christmas dude! From one vault dweller to another. Hope you have a positive and chilled day.
---
Stay strong, I feel your pain. Since last year I’ve been dreading Christmas it’s the only holiday of the year that really effects me. But knowing I’m not the only one  who is struggling is helping me through this year. Last year I was drunk by 5pm
---
My team got killed by a couple guys who glitched inside an inaccessible building a few days ago on xbox. We were on top of the building and they were able to hit us with grenades and we didn't even know they were there.
---
Yes: [https://imgur.com/a/U8TFQW1](https://imgur.com/a/U8TFQW1)
---
Most people feel 1 for 1 ammo is fair in most cases, but probably the only people that would buy the 38 is someone new that hasn't figured out that its worthless. I usually avoid even picking it up. When I used to pick up everything that wasn't nailed down I would end up with lots and even priced 0 caps nobody would take it.
---
It is too much. They need to revert the the VTU xp requirements. I refused to play this go round because of it. Thankfully that jacket is ugly anyway.
---
No, for the look, i dont care, thought it is about 100 DR instead 86 from the BOS Combat Armor Mod maybe or something.
---
Giving the decent 1-2 star stuff to low levels.
---
Lever action and handmade.  I ran that combo, both semi auto, perked out and had a ton of fun earlier in the game.  TSE on both.  Be sure to run the dense mod on your chest to offset explosive rounds when you shoot enemies getting close.
---
I most just give it away if they ask for it but I mainly give it to my friends who I play with
---
I’d like this poll to be more about additions/upgrades, I don’t think Server Stability, Hack Protections, or Bug Squashing should be there since I’m pretty sure everyone wants those
---
✊💝 never alone
---
While I don’t agree, this is funny as hell!!!  😂😂😂👍
---
A lot of typical assumptions in this post. I’ve enjoyed the game and got a lot of time out of it, does that mean I ignore it’s flaws? No. I’m not going to accept that I’m a beta tester when the game was sold as a finished product at full price, anything less is unacceptable, despite the AAA industries best efforts to make it seem otherwise. I do not “race to max level” I have made a few characters, all of whom are low level because I enjoy building CAMPS, writing backstories and all my builds are not “OP” or “meta” but builds that I enjoy or fit a given characters backstory such as my desert ranger who only uses a double barrel, revolver and lever action. I like to think my CAMPs are well built and realistic but really who are you to judge other people’s anyway? To my knowledge I have not spewed “vitriolic bile” anywhere and frankly all I have ever tried to do is provide my honest criticism of Bethesda and a game that is almost great. But at the end of the day, am I going to accept how half assed the game is just because I enjoy it? No, it’s not mutually exclusive for me to enjoy the game but also criticise bugs that never should have existed in the first place
---
A  good experience I had was farming Christmas scorched for low level legendary gear to give to new players their reaction was worth the grind
---
That's a good tip that I don't think has been mentioned. Weight reduction perks don't work for items in the stash.
---
May they march on
---
Why doesn’t this have more upvotes?  It would be a sight to see! 😂😂
---
Yeah and Santa Beard. Where tf is it?
---
Awh nice! Thanks
---
Yes, please increase, even if you only do it during certain times like this holiday event.  We need a way to blow through these legos.  I have an access daily anyway that keeps me, my vendor and stash full.
---
I think it's a good rule, in general, to take any YouTube opinion with a grain of salt.  Unless it's from an *actual* employed expert (such as mechanical advice from a mechanic, or singing advice from a vocal coach), then all a YouTube video is is one person's opinion on something.  If it's a YouTuber whose channel is their livelihood, many times that's worse than listening to a random person on the street.  Their livelihood depends on getting clicks and keeping eyes on their videos.  They're never going to be fired for getting facts wrong, and most of them have no background in what they're talking about.
---
I'm going to use Joe Rogan as an example.  I like Rogan.  Compared to the average random person, he knows A LOT about MMA.  He's trained in various fight techniques for many years.  He's competed in amateur bouts before.  He's watched countless fights from cage side.  Compared to most people, he's an expert.  He's also a relatively intelligent person who will change his views when he's corrected, which is a rare quality in people.
---
But then listen to when they have him commentate a fight with an actual fighter also in the booth.  There's a different level of expertise there, and Joe's playing catch-up.
---
Many of these YouTubers who critique games are not game developers themselves, have no professional coding expertise, and no real knowledge of any kind other than following the industry and playing games.  
---
It's the equivalent of listening to someone who's not a professional fighter, not even a Joe Rogan, but more like a dude at the bar who watches the fights and parrots what other people say about fighting without really understanding it.  Take anything they say with a grain of salt.  They're only trying to get you to listen, not to spread the truth.
---
lol the moronic boot lickers in this sub
---
No that's just bullshit, comparing MATN to the YouTube FO76 haters is so wrong it's laughable. He's consistently been one of the most fair minded critics and supporters of the game, from before launch. Like everyone else he's not going to be 100% right, but his love for the game and franchise is irrefutable, he has a well deserved reputation for honest reviews and opinions and has been consistent in both his praise and constructive criticism of all fallout games. 
---
Repair kits - basic kits do not drop in game and when they first appeared many players were unaware the advanced kits were available because of Bethesda's poor announcements. Basic kits were by far the main discussion with advanced kits barely mentioned.
---
Vault raids - when his team tried to play through the broken vault raids shortly after they dropped the damage glitch was in full effect, making enemies near invincible, thus requiring a huge increase in ammo and aid and causing weapons to break due to overuse. The wave attack style game play makes workbench repairs impossible at times so repair kits become essential. This is all seen and discussed in the video, which you obviously either completely misunderstood or never watched. 
---
For you to decry those who regurgitate misinformation while doing exactly that makes you look ridiculous, especially when you site videos that prove how misinformed you are. 
---
You're no better than the haters, spouting misinformation and bullshit because of the obvious and massive the chip on your shoulder.
---
Other people have commented there should have been an official uranium ore mining event at the fissures and glassed cavern areas.
---
It's madness to have to search areas and mine the glowing ore's to attract a new wave of christmas gift scorched.
---
I am using the private world medical bag transfer method at trainstations to fill my new characters stashes with legendarys.
---
Me: kowtows, furiously
---
You forgot to list your platform
---
I personally would remove ManyATrueNerd from that list, cant speak for the others though as they do deffo thrive off of drama, Matn has ahrdly made anything about FO76 and what he has made has been lore vids and 1 on the atom shop
---
Me too and nothing worth keeping.  But that’s case even during 25% off sale.  Either way we’re getting discounted rolls.  2 per day and 3 every other day until it’s over.
---
Fingers crossed for AAE handmade, fixer or 50cal.
---
I think this guy moves around because I've seen this exact same house in the savage divide before.  It's pretty trippy to walk through for the first time.
---
That is so cool!!! Love it!!
---
I’ll add you as well
---
Keep in mind that the "hate wagon" was due to the game being buggier than early days of Shadow of Chernobyl without anything amazing like A-Life to show for it.
---
Thats way too long, my game doesnt even take 30 seconds to load let alone adding that.  
---
given the CAMP loads in after i do but only for like 5 seconds after i get in the game.  
---
Given this is PC, dont know what the load times are like on the consoles
---
Actually I  was wrong, heavy raider does have a higher Dr if buttressed
---
Yeah I saw this and was thinking "damn I dont want to quadruple my load times"
---
Marry Christmas, Wastelander! We’ll get through it together!
---
Yes, Merry Christmas and hope you have a great time
---
For the pvpers, god mode.
---
Gatling plasma spin up, but then won't fire
---
Fast travel not working occasionally. Have to move around to get it to finally allow you to travel.
---
I remember when I first played the game, I was a noob lvl 5 just starting and didnt know where to go so I ended in Stutton.
---
Then I saw the first player ever in the game, a 70+ level running from the distance directly to me and I was scared af because I thought that he could kill me (didnt know about how pvp worked then).
---
I decided to accept my poor luck and I didnt move when finally he did the 'salute' emote and he threw a bunch of blueprints for me!.
---
And in that moment I knew how great the player base was. 🙂
---
Drop all your plans for christmas noobs that you know already.
---
Yeah but do we know exactly what that support was? Companies love to hide the exact details of things when shit goes south. For all we know they just tossed a few guys from each branch at Austin and told them to rush things.
---
I always have gunpowder in my vending @ 1 cap per.  Pc same name as here.  I seem to always have plenty of acid and paper. 😎
---
Regularly drop full sets of armour for people i trade with and see they have a mixed low armour set...
---
Love this , love you, man. 
---
I will.be on later tonight but work at 5 Am so will play a lot more tomorrow evening. 
---
Been handing out large gifts, free ammo and lots of virtual hugs and emotes to my fellow dwellers with mental health issues and everyone else for that matter!
---
So the game is apparently so badly cobbled together that your *UI* can be stolen...
---
Anyone who trusts Bethesda deserves this. Again and again, until you learn better
---
At this point everyone should be able to get whatever they want in the game on Bethesda's half
---
Sorry and thanks , this is Xbox
---
Scrip some, sell some to station vendors then dump the rest. 
---
Some of the better ones I leave under my tree at my camp in the gift box loot bag for people to take.
---
Tbh dont, i was exited but it flooped hard, get into the game by all means, but dont excpect much from it
---
Merry merry to all!
---
Just give everyone the scrapbox! We already have the tent and our monthly atoms, plus our snazzy ranger gear, we need nothing else IMHO. Scrapbox for everyone!
---
I drop stuff for strangers often including god roll weapons I know I won't use. I use big guns or melee and don't need anything else in game so I don't care for caps or 5.56.
---
About once a week I find someone fresh out of the vault and drop them care packages including non-perishable food, water, disease cures, stims, radaway, lvl 1-5 legendary weapons and armor, ammo, and if they ask I'll join team so I can build them a basic camp with all of the necessities. Also collect lvl 15 raider PA and when I've got a full set, I fully mod it and go find a lvl 14-15 to gift it to.
---
Hard to say... done many over the last year.  Two immediately come to mind:   A few months ago I was helping some low level with lots of questions, then I teamed up with him for a few hours traveling around unlocking many locations for him.  Showed him Whitesprings (my fave), and that was back before the inside became a ghost town.  Lots of players were in the mall goofing off, trading, etc.
---
Mostly now I drop stimpacks, known plans to the very low leveled.
---
You just gave them another way to make money, thanks now they're gonna add some clean tight panties before they fix this hack
---
This game has brought me and my girlfriend together. She has always been reluctant about playing video games, but this game captivated her. Now we play together often, we help build each other's camps and just have fun in Appalachia together. I know this game isn't perfect, but it has brought many memorable moments to my girlfriend and I, and for that, I'm grateful.
---
You absolutely should, especially since leve 36 doesn’t exist!
---
Something is going wrong if you aren’t getting max level gear.
---
Love you too! But treat everyone equal  😅. 💝✊ love all around
---
Welcome!!
---
i'll hold out for frilly black lace either way
---
Ditto.
---
Please cite your source. That is not what they said. They never said they cannot raise it. They said they all increases have server stability in mind. That is not the same as saying they cannot do it.
---
💝✊ all for one and one for all.
---
It’s to bad we don’t have inter-platform play . Of course we would have all been hacked by PC players by now , lol
---
I meant 35 :) I’ll probably get told the devs are working on it and nothing can be done. But hey.....
---
Happy holidays, and welcome to the madness of the grind, fallout style. But seriously... enjoy the exploration and leave the main quests for later.
---
I am on daily, playing since beta days. Role playing 4 different characters. Solo mostly, but sell cheap items in my camps. Just north of the vault 76.   Brooklyn NY
---
If I am bush hiding I am getting xp while I clean or take care of real life stuff. I only play NW for event rewards anyway. Pvp is not fun for me only because I use 76 to play different from Destiny CoD and other pvp games.
---
I just don't see myself thanking the devs for fixing their shit. I do thank them for the game, which is fun and addictive. Merry Christmas.
---
Hiding can be a lot of fun and extremely nerve racking at times. I personally like to hide in porta potties. Or wear a Santa outfit, then build about 100 robotic Santa’s and hide in the middle. 
---
Zach tells you, the goal is to survive until the end. You do this by any means necessary.

BGS don't care about  the community, they only want  as much money as they can get.

Why 1000 hours in a limping, cronge-worthy game?  Nothing sinister here, I just am curious about why you'd spend all that time on something you find so poor.  
---
I have just over 300 hours, and I, too, acjnowledge the poor parts.  But I also recognise how massively awesome aspects must be to overcome that and have me play, KNOWING I could get dropped a couple times.  Knowing I may lose my loot on a legendary...
---
They were the worst. So many ways to do it and they chose the most disgusting one.
---
Correct response.   😞
---
It’s worth submitting the ticket. That’s not how it should operate.
---
First they came for the NW players, and I did not speak out—because I did not play NW. Then they came for the Adventure Mode players...
---
Scorchbeast, her wings open.
---
Discovery challanges are also broken since a year or so.
---
Link broken for me but I remember.   I also remember thinking “what in the unholy hell” and “who thought this was a good idea?”
---
Ditto. I save it for SBQ and/or nuke zones with Scorched mobs. I have found some vendors selling Ultracite.45 at reasonable prices (2-3 caps per), and I am farming or buying cobalt flux for ammo crafting as often as I can. 
---
If you don’t like the Ultracite ammo grind, you can mod it back to a non-prime weapon.
---
You could just be like me and never watch you tube kids.
---
All they are good for is misinformation and bad opinions.
---
Dude I sincerely doubt you would be making this post if you had gotten attacked by these *anarchists* you would be with we regime else who was, talking about how Bethesda allowed this to happen from the get go by not having any good anti cheat systems in place. Above comments are correct you’re just a shill who was one of the high leveled players not to be attacked losing hours upon hours of work.
---
"when that is your opinion we can’t take it away from you but the rest of us disagree. and we are sick of the negativity. enough is enough..."
---
Listen. Buddy. Idk who hurt you, but i'm not telling you not to enjoy the game. Regardless of my opinion. If you read what I first wrote, you'd know what my intentions are. The game is absolutely in an unacceptable state, and this isn't up for debate. Bethesda could have done better in the way it treated it's audience. Bethesda could've waited before they released this game and try to fix a lot of the marketing issues and bugs before this game launched. Bethesda could've given me my fucking canvas bag six months after they said they would. Bethesda could've fixed this game so I wouldn't have lost my shit by some random hacker took it all from me.
---
If you think this game isn't unacceptable and bad, tough shit. It is. That isn't an opinion rooted in a biased dislike of the game. FO76 should never be the standard for games in 2020. That doesn't mean it can't be fun. It can be sometimes. I just don't appreciate how OP glosses over the people who have actually been fucked over, while most of the community scorn those those who actually take offense to Bethesda's insulting practice. If you don't like negativity, that's unfortunate. This is reddit, and i'm free to speak my mind, no matter how inconsequentially controversial my views may be.
---
The pics are misleading.
---
speak your mind all you want, just don’t state your opinion as fact and you won’t have any problems
---
They put Jon on there now in this sub because of the atom shop video. Just because he went over the shady stuff they did with the atom shop they now consider him a "fallout hater riding the hate bandwagon for views!" Completely ignoring the fact that his fo76 videos even the atom shop one got less views than his average videos. 
---
Basically if you haven't noticed, that list is used to ignore any legitimate criticism of the game as "just haters". I mean the CM's for bethesda even came out and said MatN is one of their favorite youtubers. It just doesn't matter to the shills in this subreddit.
---
You try and downvote his rightful cries to have a game that was released as a “finished game at full price” as petty and unrealistic. No we should not have to be BETA testers for a game that was released as “finished”. That is not how buying a game works unless clearly stated before buying. These bugs and cheats should not have been here and should not be happening (at the very least the major ones). You saying that this is ok just shows Bethesda you’re willing to not care about the products they give you.
---
So you think all that bethesda has done to this game was justified? Are you really gonna argue against that?
---
Also I appreciate the fact you downvoted me not even 20 seconds after I wrote that reply. Merry Christmas.
---
&gt;I honestly think a large portion of this fan base is legitimately depressed
---
...I've been in the psych ward twice this year, so...
---
Just purple, they do look snazzy though. My camps sign has the name written in a mish mash of various letters and the purple pops nicely.
---
That I definitely remember.
---
well it was your tone, asking who hurt me etc etc, no one hurt me lol. you spit venom and then are upset when you get downvoted.
---
My man *doesn't* know what's up
---
a small number of characters yet one hacker stole 53 people and there are alot of hackers, so that small number is not small for your slowly dying game on PC. This has been a disaster and yet you still see these people playing and trying to enjoy your lack luster mess of a game. IF Wastelanders bomb then that is the final fucking nail in the coffin. You had your chance to fix this game for the better and it turns out, it's getting worse.
---
Oh you made a game out of it? While many other players were losing tons of their hours by people cheating in a game that should have had better anti cheat? I enjoyed the game when I bought for a long time. But the glaringly major bugs that went unfixed since the games come out are abhorrent. They shouldn’t have been allowed to do this in the first place. And I’m sure you wouldn’t be spewing this shill crap if you had your accounts items stripped in the matter of seconds. Nice try Todd.
---
We are talking about bethesda here right? The same company that got busted putting up a ton of fake reviews of their rum before it even went on sale. This idea that they DON'T have PR shills in this sub is ignoring reality as they've already been caught doing it with reviews in the last year.
---
Just up XP for kills, fixes everything. Bush wacking still works for the disinterested grinders, but a battle Royale should have more incentive to, well, battle.  Not asking for a hiding nerf, or weapons changes, or even to make frog legs into a mutation( like it should be), just more XP for kills. Could be a sliding scale with more XP in the 1st ring, to compensate people who get loaded into a shyte-fest, die and have to start the (way too long) loading process over again.
---
I downvoted you because of the” who hurt you etc remarks” . dont spit venom and then get upset with the downvote
---
If you ate not getting level appropriate gear from her then it is a bug.
---
Everyone to their own and everyone should 100% play the way they like but this is why I prefer private servers lol
---
Usually I will accept 5.56 as payment before caps. Best currency in the wasteland for commando guys like me.
---
and OP clearly addressed the fact that the game has issues. the point of the post was happy holidays to fellow wastelanders
---
GT HasNoStyle
---
The bigger issue is that they can still put items into others inventories. That means they can literally get anyone they want banned or corrupt their character.
---
There are also wooden cubes in the house spelling redrum.
---
Imagine getting this shit for Christmas
---
I thought he collected only gifts and that if you wanted him to collect scrap, you had to also own the original collectron, but were still limited to one type of tron at your camp, so it turned the Santa one into a glorified reskin for anyone who also happened to own the original.
---
If that makes any sense. I've been awake since early this morning, fighting with FO4s Creation Club servers like the naive idiot that I am.
---
The vendor issue is a tiny worry compared to the fact they can put items into others inventories. That means they can get others banned by just spawning purveyor legendary boxes into their inventory, or the SB scream into their inventory and it will completely corrupt the character.
---
&gt; +
---
lvl 36? Now **that** clearly would constitute a bug, lol.
---
I saw that and asked myself wait wasn't that in the movie as well?
---
The more notable thing was the message of appreciation I got for giving a bunch of stims to a low level.
---
Its the same forum and the same guy erectban who has released the last 2 major hacks with the inventory steal hack and the spawn in anything you want. So they are just checking the forum he releases stuff on.
---
Everyone wants a trophy 🙄
---
?
---
Could you elaborate?
---
Never happened to me on xbox.
---
Depends on what you consider "safe" the stealing part of the hack has been patched, but they can still put items into your inventory. Which means if they want to get players banned they can put illegal items in their inventory like SB scream attack (corrupts the character completely) or purveyor legendary box (gets the account banned).
---
All work and no caps makes jack a dull boy 😄 would be great if there was a note like this next to a typewriter.
---
I cant say ive personally seen anyone hate on him myself to be honest, not to say it doesnt happen, he seems like too much of a genuinly nice guy to hate on for things, anyway happy xmas
---
I just found out about this and came to find out more about it. Bethesda you really need to work on your statements because here is what stands out to me most in this OP here.  
---
*  a PC-only exploit that could be abused by cheaters 
---
*  may have resulted in a few players losing items that their characters had equipped 
---
*  we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected 
---
Could be abused? It HAS been abused, there's video of it happening, don't try to hide that fact with conditional words like "could" and "may".  
---
It wasn't just items their characters had equipped either, it was their entire character inventories.  
---
The final one is the most insulting to me for anyone that has ever been affected by a problem with a company (probably everyone at some point) with you stating that it's "only a small number of characters (that) have been negatively affected".
---
I don't care if it's 1 person, 10 people, hundreds or more affected. The fact that this happens at all is an insult to your most loyal customers STILL playing this mess of a game. Don't further insult and try to diminish the effect felt by people hit by this exploit by suggesting it's a small number affected.
---
And sleep frequently as it will boost your xp gain!!
---
Go check the thread where someone posted his "history of the atom shop" video here. Most of the replies are putting him in the same group as YongYea, LegacykillaHD, and juicehead (who I think isn't a "hatemonger" either).
---
Submit an essay an wait for 500 atosm and possibly a not-canvas bag...
---
Yea I’ll raise one..
---
S-T-E-A-L. If you're going to be negative and promote fear in a newbie, at least spell correctly.
---
Have a group to play with and focus on a set of goals
---
This is a perfect example how much damage these hacks cause, people are scared to play a game and i feel bad for pc players since its the holiday season in many places and many would probably want to play.

I use zealots prime Handmade.

It does very good damage to the sbq.

While I don’t own fo76 I had many great moments with it. Mostly watching from the sideline, seeing it crash again and again. So much fun just watching it burn. I mean don’t get me wrong it’s not a bad game. It’s just so hilarious how things that have something to do with fo76 just break. It’s like a curse. The canvas bag, nuka cola dark, the gamestop helmet. How do you even get a glass bottle wrong? 
---
Would still like to play it missed the free weekend, but after all what happened i can’t justify giving Bethesda money.
---
When kevduit says there is nothing to do in this game BUT IS LVL 204 haha
---
Yeah some people dont understand valid critisism over hate
---
It can’t get much worse than the state of the game is. So *shrug*
---
Yes yes :)
---
Which ones are still using BETA footage? As I just checked juicehead, his videos show him in current patch playing NW with his username literally being "juicehead" in game. Same with MaTN, when he does play the game he is playing current patch, LegacyKillaHD is hard to tell as some of his clips are current, while others aren't.
---
Also, you should keep in mind almost every single major "gaming" youtuber uses old videos of whatever games they are talking about if they aren't actively making a series on it. Go listen to Joseph Anderson and his fallout 76 review where he talks about fallout 4 and how he broke down and went and recorded NEW footage from fallout 4 instead of using his stock footage he took when he reviewed the game.
---
That is pretty much how youtube videos work now, they require so much editing and scripting most of the time by the time you have the video taken of the game its another week or so before the video is ready to be posted.
---
Fallout franchise saves lifes ! Keep being passionate about things and laugh ! Merry Christmas !!
---
I have a few - and can say the game introduced me to some of my best friends.
---
Between two stories for me, hmmm. I'll go with the time me and a pal were chilling at my camp being some kind of way - in this case it was us singing badly over area chat while I abused a melodica. 
---
A couple of randos had fast traveled nearby, and were now poking around my camp being drawn by our terrible siren-like screeching. The set up of my camp at the time was a bit convoluted, and there was an upper "apartment" that could only be gotten to with marsupial or a jet pack.
---
The randos are having fun exploring the camp but soon it becomes obvious that to join the singing weirdies up in the loft they'd need some help. So I hopped down and dropped a couple of marsupial serums for 'em. They soon found their new legs and hopped up to join us in the ever-so-cozy loft!
---
This is of course where I closed the door so it was now locked and me and my pal both processed to chastise the randos for following strangers into their locked home. It's the wasteland!That's how you get "et" out here y'know. More "you're dinner now" jokes ensue, the randos do a great job of emoting and playing along. I finally opened my "bolt door" that is just a door that leads to a fall into the water below and they both ran for it! Freedom! And a lesson learned (we can hope!)
---
No problems on my side. Even if it wasn't patched out. I had a low level character with base equipment to used if necessary.
---
Sure, most online services has been hacked, but non has been in news almost a whole year. 
---
Bethesda is a gift that keeps giving for news outlets.
---
Im positive in playing other games.
---
Which is why I think the majority of non fo76 players look at this sub as "full of shills" because when they do come look in here the top posts in threads are almost always by people who can't handle any criticism of this game at all. 
---
Just look at this thread even, the OP literally is saying that the devs deserve shout out and thank you, for fixing a major exploit they left in the game 3 days after they knew about it.
---
I'm sorry, but that isn't deserving of applause just because they did their job as devs for a live service. Then anyone who rightfully is pissed at bethesda for such shoddy security in an online game is called a hater and claimed "oh you never played the game and just hate it for no reason." even if you've been playiing since the BETA.
---
After having played Fallout 1, 2 and tactics and being pretty cynical about a FPS Fallout 3, I didn't get it for a year.
---
The greatest moment for me was when I left vault 111 and saw the entire landscape in front of me.  I was both overwhelmed and in awe of what was in front of me.  When I replay the game, I always spend a minute or two looking out after leaving the vault.
---
I help people learn lessons about trust and free up stash space when I lure them into workshop zones in area chat and kill them.
---
The only comparable shitshow on your list has been Atlas. Only that case because of the blatant lies on wildcards end. They rode the hype train like 76 and released a reskinned ark dlc.
---
And EA is a perfect example of why I don't like people supporting bethesda after this (unless they produce quality and consumer friendly content like before) there shitty practices have kept them funded and they keep on pushing for more little by little with every title they release and shit we found unacceptable before is now the industry standard.
---
Can't say much about hacking in gta:O because I haven't experienced a single hacker but they have continued to add content over the last 6 years and now shark cards are slowly becoming more and more obsolete, with the diamond casino heist me and a buddy can easily grind out 40 USD worth of in game cash in a 6 hour session.
---
The problem with all of your examples is that the base game for all of them was entirely playable at launch (atlas was a bit iffy though, I'll give you that one atlas was pretty fucking awful) and a lot of the shit we gave them for was either greed or lying. But they in no way compare to the shitshow 76 has been

Reintroducing old bugs like once every 2 months
---
Bethesda has really shown its ass with this title dude, and if they are getting paid, why would they ever stop doing it, all they have to do is get the fucking thing to turn on and if there name and a fallout logo is somewhere on it there will be guys like you trying to compare it to fucking GTA ONLINE and the evils of rockstar trying to make back money with shark cards while pumping out 6 years of content.
---
What a fucking joke, they could probably release fallout 0 for 60 dollars have it be a blank canvas screen and still have people saying "JUsT GiVE tHeM TiME"
---
I've had that moment,  but arrived at a different conclusion.  Am I having fun with my friends? Yes.  Am I enjoying the map? Yes.  Oh look free repair kits! In the end I decided it was a game and I enjoyed it.  Adopting a cause for change is great. Idealism is beautiful.  But unless you're going to adopt a method of direct change you have to ask yourself if you're making a positive impact or are you punishing yourself? Most people who get incensed over the superfluous never get that far. Their cause is fought in places like this, never heard by those guilty of the fault.  Instead they find other targets on which to cause pain. Is that a righteous cause? I think you know the answer.
---
Thanks for that sheet, Raider Armor has slighty better DR but much less Energy Resistance, its absolutely not worth, thanks for let me knowing that
---
💝✊
---
Oh come on noob...meth is the current meta. Obviously.
---
Sooo, did the fix work?
---
I’m on the other side of this. I’ve only been playing 2 months, I’ve had one player gift me a bunch of shotgun shells and then stimpacks when I saw him again later. Another a bunch of plans. Then one player gave me a bunch of low level legendary item. By far the best player base I’ve ever found! I’m paying it forward! Thanks guys!
---
People like him are the reason why no one outside of this sub takes the "the youtubers are just hating on this game for reasons!" seriously. Anyone who dares have anything critical to say about this game automatically is just on the hate train for clicks. Even though MaTN fo76 videos get far less views than his other videos. 
---
Yet somehow its still "just for the clicks" even though he can get more views just dicking around on pokemon, yet somehow a long form video essay about the atom shop that gets less views is just "easy views to make money." It literally doesn't make sense.
---
Not sure where in my OP I asked any of that but Merry Christmas all the same.
---
wrong reply. merry xmas :D
---
You are definitely not the only one pissed at the junk storage thing, though if they moved the junk storage and the tent to behind a quest line where everyone can get it, I would honestly subscribe to FO1st just for the free atoms. I don't even really have use for private servers, but would give them money to support the game in return for monthly atoms if they stopped pay walling things everyone should be able to have access to.
---
&gt;If it doesnt hurt the state or even benefits the state, Russia will allow it
---
That's not true at all. I'm also sorry to hear about your accident.
---
Thin-skinned I see. Idk how that's "spitting venom" but ok. I can see this conversation won't yield anything valuable. Have a nice day. You can hit the downvote button on the way out. :)
---
You want credit for participating/assisting. You didn’t get the kill. That’s all that matters.
---
I don't own it but I have played it during the free weekends. Being low level, it's been nice to see how generous people in the community are, even those who aren't much higher a level than you are.  
---
Before the last free weekend ended I wanted to complete the new teaser quest for Wastelanders, but to do so would mean my roughly level 25 character would have to go into the Mire and Cranberry Bog to find all the map fragments. It was at the General's Steakhouse that this story takes place.
---
At the time I went there it was populated by Super Mutants, the lowest level of which was almost twice my strength at level 48, while many of the others were level 62. In order to be able to clear it, I had to keep a wide distance from the building and take potshots at the mutants in between running away when they'd start to close the gap. I was able to take a few out this way, but eventually a level 62 master with a minigun exited the building while I was approaching it and shredded the health I had remaining with it.  Having not gotten close enough to the building to actually discover it and with the closest waypoint I could spawn in at being some dudes camp about 5 minutes away, I was about to give up on finding the map and go play something else (this was all on the night before the free weekend ended, so it was now or never on finishing the map and finding the Vault.
---
Just when I thought all was lost and was about to give up, a level 40 showed up and managed to finish off the already weakened master before reviving me just in the nick of time.  We never spoke a word to eachother and at this point I can't even remember his name, but together we managed to go room to room inside the restuarant and clear the whole place out. I was able to get the map fragment I wanted (the last piece I needed for the puzzle) and afterwards we parted ways.
---
I have no doubt that his timely intervention and continued assistance was the only reason I was able to make it to Vault 79. If he hadn't been there, my little self imposed quest would have been lost, my character killed, and the building forever uncleared.  For me at least. If nothing else, it was a reassuring end to my free weekend experience, during which I had largely ignored other players. Now, whenever I get the chance to play the game again, I'm looking forward to going out of my way to interact and cooperate with other random players. I guess the upside to this game being largely abandoned by the mainstream is that the only people left are those who genuinely love it and its community, which I'd argue may even be better than widespread popularity.
---
Im sorry who ever gave you this game does not like you.
---
Lol, there we go again with "skin-thinned" comment then tries to take the high road lol. You're all over the place. Turn off reddit and go enjoy your christmas already. I'm about to do the same.
---
Juicehead has a video of a Atom shop skinned dagger being stolen and equipped by the hacker with his atom shop skin still on the dagger.
---
What exactly are they wrong about when they say "they can steal your atomic shop items as well"? Seeing as they literally can steal the item with the skin and equip it without ever buying the skin themselves.
---
That sure seems like "stealing atomic shop items" to me.
---
It looks like you got Very big eyes
---
Wait, what do you mean my accid-
---
You just repeated literally what he just said, he said they said they couldn't raise it due to server stability issues...
---
Mine was pretty recently, actually. I played through two betas, before buying the game, and I'm level 19, and I did sort it out my build and equip, and then I got on grinding. But I couldn't get a combat rifle anywhere. On Monday I decided to participate in an event on the pioneer scouts camp, and a guy with 100+ levels dropped a legendary combat rifle that shots an additional shot, for the level 20, and he gave me. I didn't had a reaction, and I kinda freak out, laughing while thanking him, still kinda embarrassed and amused, and he say "you welcome man". This on Monday just after the fix, I've bought the game on Friday, but hadn't time to play it on the weekend. And with the hacks story, I thought I made a mistake buying the game, but this guy showed me how amazing this community is, and how worth it was my purchase.
---
Damn straight!
---
Lol dammit you might have just ruined it for me, can't unsee now
---
Someone predicted it before one whole year!
---
They are now considered MaTN as part of the "hate train" because he did the essay on the atom shop. So I'd suggest you not listen to people claiming "all youtubers are just haters" as they are doing the same exact thing they claim the youtubers are doing, even when the youtuber isn't a shitty one, such as Jon from MaTN.
---
I mean hell, the CM's from bethesda even said they all watch and closely follow him themselves, yet somehow he is now a "hater" because he dared criticize the atom shop.
---
Like a sweet little colt 😂
---
Except when people feel the need to post pictures of them in thier basements with piss buckets and messy as fuck room. Can't imagine why half are lonely..
---
FO4 is awesome no matter how many times you rerun it. With it's great mod community and survival options, that game wouldn't have been great without all of you. So, thank you and thanks to the the developers.
---
I am happy to hear that you have admitted to your error. Perhaps in the future you should do more research and fact checking.
---
My stash is usually around 200w, so I have plenty of space to store extras.  I never sell or drop them.  Scrip is the only currency of real value right now.  Selling legendaries is like trading gold for glass beads, at least to me.
---
Yes an example of scale. How even 500 can qualify as a few.
---
As for steam there can be no more information unless Bethesda gives it. Amd so far there has been none beyond they are still planning.
---
&gt;Hackers can still place items in your inventory, not take. (Doubt this will be an issue)
---
Watch, they'll place duped/hacked items into people's inventories and those people will get banned for having an excessive amount of illicit items.
---
Why would I do that when I can just fudge the facts and create my own narrative? Try again my guy 😉👍
---
When I was around lvl 10 I met a really friendly guy. He helped me with main story missions and gathering resources for my first X-01 power armor. We played months together and had lots of fun and crazy adventures. Few months ago, one day he didn't come on TeamSpeak, and since that time I haven't seen him at all ;/ I would love to get the copy of Fo76 to my irl friend who is a Fallout fan and I always wanted to play with him :D
---
This community is like a battered spouse.
---
Thanks for the giveaway! I already own the game though so no need for a copy but will try to keep an eye out for other games could definitely use a copy of nv!
---
Every other shooter/mmo counts assist kills.
---
I’ve been having a blast playing with basic gear.  I kinda wish we had more types and craftable slots now instead of so many legendaries.
---
How else would they get all the laughs from the constant screw ups of this game? I mean hell, every train wreck of a game has a huge portion of people joining the forums for those train wrecks just because of it being a train wreck.
---
Have you never watched horribly shitty and cheesy movies for enjoyment? Same concept here, there are tons of people who can hate a game or movie but still be involved in the community. 
---
If it weren't for people like that we wouldn't have sequals to things like sharknado 2, or the gremlins movie series. They both are cult "classics" now due to how cheesy and bad the movies are.
---
What level does my alt need to be to get to murmagurh?

Find an available acid node and put your camp on it.
---
I yo run acros an exposed acid deposit, take the small damage hit and loot it.
---
pick up batteries, rat poison, kill cave crickets, snallygasters, bloodbugs, wendigo teeth, antifreeze, waste acid containers.... they all scrap for acid.
---
Game companies have tried in the past to go after hackers through the legal system, R* and epic both went after a hacker recently through the court systems, they lost and he won.
---
Hacking a video game doesn't legally constitute any illegal action especially since no code was maliciously injected into the servers. They only sent packets the client itself could send.
---
I saw another camp like this a while ago. Super cool when people get creative with their arrangements
---
Continuing to defend Bethesda makes him look ridiculous. They have no quality control. No bug testing. They use paying customers as QA. 
---
Bethesda cares only about pumping out a minimum Viable product for maximum revenue. Quality isn't even a concern. If it were, Radiant wouldn't exist.
---
I would love it if they made the scrap box free. Would not need a replacement as I’d be £12 a month better off can’t beat that. Only reason I subscribe is for the scrap box makes the game way more fun. It completely changes the game mechanics to be more inline with previous instalments. It’s unfair to charge for the privilege, also holding the feature back to put into a subscription is disgusting.
---
Camp building items what like nuclear winter stash boxes and the 3 trophies I cant really think of anything else they're not that important to me that I'd spend hours doing nothing except hugging bushes,but each to they're own my original point was about joining teams and doing it while contributing nothing and hoping your carried to the end for xp, I've got nothing against ppl doing it solo tho you can play how you like can I ask tho why do you think some items should not be locked behind playing nw I mean what's wrong with having rewards for specific game modes theres rewards for adventure mode challenges and there was rewards for survival so why not nw
---
Downvoted for truth.
---
And Bethesda supporters wonder why they are called shills. If the shoe fits...
---
What about battle royales?
---
No. You just dont like the truth. But that doesn't change it.
---
Team based ones yeah.
---
Are you serious?! They DO have weight ? Well, fuck .
---
That’s not what I said... they never said they cannot. That word “cannot” is the important part. They didn’t say it was “impossible”. They didn’t say that it “couldn’t be done”.
---
EB the hacker who released these hacks is in Russia, american laws don't apply to him as he isn't in american jurisdiction.
---
Ah, I get where you're coming from.
---
Jeez this is cringe. It’s idiotic posts like these that Bethesda will point to and undeservingly pat them selves on the back thinking they actually did good. Thanks for helping Bethesda keep the game in such a shit state op; once you’re done Todd has more boots for your to lick clean.
---
I got two extras. PC?
---
Exactly this. The Bethesda Defense Force are pathetic.
---
Xbox
---
I dunno, I don’t see he problem. Maybe it’s a generational thing. I don’t need credit for someone else’s accomplishment.
---
I've met some cool people during my time bug hunting in this game. I would even daresay that at one point my name was sort of well known when I was making posts about them all. It was a time when I needed a distraction, and having a list of over 100 weapon bugs to thoroughly test was a great distraction
---
Spot on response.
---
It's the truth, haven't you played another game with private servers?
---
Nope, go back to right after the release before the increase from 400 to 600, they literally did say they couldn't raise the weight more for fear of server stability problems.
---
I'm not upset about the downvote. I was more baffled as to how you seemed to disregard the point of my entire post in mere seconds, saw two words that offended you, and proceeded to downvote. I was more confused than anything else lol. But I can see you tried to use my comment about your downvote to deflect the fact that you took offense to my opinion. You do you man.
---
Every time I have a run in with someone low level I’ll always drop canned dog food, purified water, .308 rounds. Just because I know how crucial these were when being fresh out the vault.
---
I think a lot of people get mad that people are willing to play the game. Personally I thought the game was super fun I just sort of got distracted by shiny stuff, but some folk on the internet hate seeing others like stuff so they downvote.
---
The point...you missed it.
---
In a zero consequence setting like games, exploiters will ALWAYS have a presence. Failing basic QA testing to prevent gross exploits is 100% on Bethesda.
---
Which games offer freeeee private servers, please tell me.
---
lol had to resort to the C word lawlz
---
Same for me....
---
A new player came by my camp looking at my vending machines but didn't have caps to really buy much. After chatting a bit, I made him a new tricked out rifle, some ammo, and water and wished him well since I needed too log off. He seemed pretty happy.
---
I don't mind the criticism, but angry joe specifically has been saying things for a while now that are either misleading or just wrong about the game. This game does deserve criticism but the value of it goes out the window if you're not even doing enough research to cover the game accurately. And only uses footage from either launch/beta, or something taken from a recent video showcasing whatever issue is at hand. At least most of the other people talking about the game show some more recent footage of themselves running around whitesprings or something with a bloodied melee weapon
---
That is not what they said. Share the link.
---
Aww, what a cute big eyes! :D
---
Angry joe keeps using the same clip of I think baroo running around during the beta and seeing textures glitching out
---
Merry Christmas to all my fellow dwellers.  This game is my refuge to go and decompress from things. Glad you all are along for the ride.
---
I'm just happy you understand that it is your opinion. Earlier you had stated something like it was "not up for debate" either way. This tangent has taken a turn for the worst.. We might not see eye to eye but today is not a day for negativity :D  I really do wish you a merry x-mas and happy holidays.
---
Ammo is my most reliable form of business. I almost never bother making anything other than 5.56 as I can never keep it in stock longer than a few hours before someone buys it all.
---
Marry christmas! And i don't need thank yous. Knowing it made a good impact on you is all i need.

I was fortunate enough to meet 2 fantastic veterans from the states. Im in Canada. These gentleman legitimately care about my well being, they provide me advice in life when needed. They are like older brothers. I met them on PS4.

Speaking of obscure bugs, does anybody know what's up with the vampire's prefix? I have a bunch of old weapons that still have two spaces (i.e Vampire's  .50 Cal) but some (not all) of my newer weapons have one space as they should. Did this bug get partially fixed? Or was it always only affecting some weapons?
---
Over 500 hours, level 243 and still enjoy it, bugs and all.  It’s a love hate relationship.
---
Pretty sure that was the point
---
Yeah, if you read my last few sentences I explain why youtubers do that. It saves time to just use footage they already have instead of going and doing video capture of the game every single time they talk about the game. This is very common in all video game reviews/news articles.
---
It is silly to have this mindset that "they must have new footage every video or else everything in the video is just the hate bandwagon riders!". When it is ridiculous to expect them to play every single game they report on.
---
That would be like claiming every sportscaster is just "hating" when the report on things players do, shady calls in game, or shit like deflategate.
---
It’s been a really rough year and even worse holidays for me with my family fighting so I feel you and I hope you will be alright and make it with me to 2020.
---
I like them better than the neon letters, but I'm not sure about 700 atoms better.
---
You May be right, although that would be a shame if it’s true. 
---
And I feel your pain, been up since silly o’clock working 🤪
---
The problem is acting like this is a huge problem for the person who had it stolen. Which it absolutely is not.
---
To each they're own mate but in my experience melee characters get wrecked and nobody does anything remotely creative with building the mechanics dont really allow for it, maybe they could have a different version of the trophies with somebody peering out from behind a bush inclusion an all that
---
Using semantics to slide your way out of this discussion to take the "high road" yourself? Lol. Alright. I recommend you leave your hypocrisy out of this next time you decide to trash on valid opinions based on facts, like in your numerous other posts in other threads here. See ya.
---
I agree but for different reasons. 
---
For some the FOB and scrap box could completely trash the idea of survival, 1st gives people a choice.
---
Hey man, I get depressed this time a year as well. And I will agree with you, thank everyone
---
That's just the psychobuff
---
They get wrecked if they are seen. That’s the point. Nobody ever sees me
---
I'd have to agree with the sentiment that this game has helped me through MANY of the darker patches in my life, with a big assist from my game-related Discord.
---
Best of the season to you all. 🎄
---
Ad victoriam!
---
On top of just dropping free gear to low levels, I sell things massively underpriced because I need stash space and am almost at Max caps.  Some lucky bastard got a bloodied explosive assault rifle for like 900 caps once.  Sort of wish I had kept it, had no intention of going low health at the time but it's how I live now. Oh well.
---
Well obviously but just how a few people can do that much harm just for their own fun
---
Where do they make a big deal out of it? Literally watch the juicehead video he barely even mentions atomic shop items aside from saying "even atomic shop skins don't make them safe". Which is good info to share as many think atom skins make the items bound to that character. So that info is very good info to get out.
---
So exactly where is this part where they claim the atom shop part is this "huge problem"? Because the only thing they said was a huge problem was the fact people were able to steal all the characters gear with a single button press.
---
Lol, you said it yourself this conversation wasn't going anywhere. I'm not sliding out of anything I was just following your lead. Holy fuck I never had someone try so hard to keep an argument going lol, even to do recon on prior posts, kind of speaks for itself where your mindset it. I've taken the liberty of blocking you. You are toxic, from the first post to the last. Happy holidays and good luck man, clearly you need it. Maybe your ego will compel you to reply, maybe it won't. Either way I'll never know. Sheesh.
---
Its not actually a big deal.  Those who got hit can just put in the support ticket and have their items again in a few days.  People have been losing everything in mmos for decades and it has not hurt them.
---
.... how about informing players on YOUR launcher, so that everybody gets informed and not just people either lurking around reddit or know what´s up and searched for it.
---
&gt;is the game still crap? still a million bugs that make the game too annoying to play? 
---
 This was not my experience at all and I have played since Beta.
---
The game has problems for sure but the fun and positives far outweigh the negative. 
---
My humble opinion.
---
Did they take care of me holiday hacker yet? If not be careful
---
I like it with the trapper gas mask personally, but this is also cool.

Bushes are for.noobs ,use aquabou and you can be coral reef and way less chance of getting shot . You can do nothing at all and get first place of the circle works in your favor

I think OP is talking broadly... not one specific YouTuber. Did you read OPs post?
---
It's a fair point, but this was more about prioritizing really. I think pretty much everyone wants upgrades to pretty much everything haha, so I just wanted to narrow that down to what's most desirable. 
---
So far it really seems like the PVE core of the game and camps are a bigger concern than everything else.

You mean how multiple people had lost items with the vault raid and over half of them had to put in multiple...MULTIPLE tickets to actually have Bethesda respond and (kinda) rollback their character? There was even a person who logged the shitty service on this sub. But no, people who are complacent like you don’t want to call out Bethesda even though they have done a ton of shit that’s worthy.
---
Some weapons with high fire rates don’t really need mire than a basic sight.... they are aka  “spray and pray“
---
if you are the shooter, spray the area and pray you hit something.
---
On the receiving end, duck and pray they dont hit you...
---
 :)
---
Yes and his replies, where he even considred Jon from Manyatruenerd as a "hater" because he made the atom shop essay video. Completely ignoring the fact that the CM's in this subreddit have come out and said he is one of their favorite youtubers and the whole dev team watches his videos.
---
I have a few hours off every day between short shifts, so I vegetate in my office playing video games.
---
I think XP for assists is a good idea, you helped with the kill, it was a team effort, you deserve partial credit. Also helps with “stolen” kills, at least some credit is given to people who care about that.
---
Also, Fortnite does give XP for an assist, a good bit of it as well. If you get enough in a match you get a medal that gives additional XP, if you get more it’s upgraded for additional XP. 
---
Fortnite’s the only BR I somewhat enjoy playing so I can’t say anything about other BRs.
---
Not sure about that. I think the main reason to hack was to steal legendary stuff and sell on.
---
Hope you have a good holiday and meet some great people during your 76 travels!
---
The glow is only really visible at night, and even then from a distance the letters tend to take on a plain white look.
---
It's great up close or at moderate distance, as you can see from the screenshot Sany provided, but it's not quite as nice overall as it could have been.
---
Literally last week they had the worst case of hacking and exploitation the game has seen.
---
I bought it for the mask as well, sadly. 
---
I really wish that they’d ease up the restrictions on regular skill gas mask. Wearing different hats with that would be sweet.
---
These should be a thing also ^.
---
Yeah, so you don't even watch the YouTubers you're making claims against while claiming they are bad for "reasons" yet you don't even have any reasons because you don't even watch them.
---
You're literally acting exactly the way you're claiming they act. Guess projection is hard to get past for you.
---
Safely? Like 35.
---
You can run for your live since level 1.
---
I’m not making any claims.  And please look up the definition of “literally”.
---
I've got no problem with the unlocks up to level 100, I have already accepted that I will never get those and made peace with that. I just don't enjoy the mode enough to actively play it. For the current event I may even skip the last two levels just because the grind will take away from time I can play other new games I enjoy.
---
But when they have a Christmas event it seems odd that there are more Christmas cosmetics locked behind NW than the actual adventure mode where they will be getting used at. My thought is that they could easily tie the unlocks to adventure mode xp, since that is earned by playing either mode. There isn't much benefit to forcing those who don't like the mode to play it for fear of missing out on limited time rewards. It will spike your player numbers for a few days and then those players do not come back.
---
Please note I think the Christmas event for adventure was well done and had awesome rare rewards even though they weren't too Christmas related, so I'm not complaining about that. It is great to see the mounted plans added to the game I just expected them to be added as side quests for hunting those beasts or something unique.
---
They probably were.  "Oh, we have a second set of Christmas lights... well, whatever, toss it up on the store."
---
Every person on you tube is trash and anyone that believes in what they say are also trash. This highlights a problem in this world today where if somebody puts their stupid face on a screen all of a sudden they’re an expert and we need to listen to them. People need to just play the game and find out things for themselves. And seriously enough with these shit heads living in their moms basements. Half of them will be junkies in a few years because nobody will give a shit about them and they have no skills other than putting their dumb faces in front of a web cam and screaming let’s go. This topic makes my blood boil.
---
If your opinion that the game was 'crap' is based on anonymous online strangers statements and if that's the way how your opinions form, don't get it. 
---
If you like fallout and give a shit about trolls, get it.
---
It has ups and downs but after 1hrs playing the beta I thought (and still think) it was worth my 70€
---
You know what really gets me about this?
---
1. That it's Christmas and there's no free item.
---
2. That the Fireproof icon is on sale for 5 Atoms.  *5 Atoms*.  You know, it would have been stingy as heck, but they could have just made that one a freebie for all the effort it takes to make 5 Atoms.  Yet they didn't.
---
The gun does great damage, but with not being able to craft a lot of bullets, and the slow as hell reloading time, the gun literaly goes like, bleh and its just not worth it.
---
#MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU TOO GOTDAMNIT!
---
So many one star hatchets and wood armor. The rate of legendaries is insane and the trash ones even more so. Fortunately I mostly get one star items so I need to sell a ton to hit the limit. But yes more would be better.
---
I know exactly what it means, you're the one acting like op is right without even checking if he is being truthful or not, which he isn't. As I demonstrated with the claim about atomic shop items.
---
Why are you so angry? What did I write to make you so mad?
---
Merry Christmas. God bless
---
Just like 9/11
---
Ask for a refund lol
---
Yesterday a retiring player gave me all his stuff, after that I went around giving other people food, water weapons and ammo he gave me to spread the love, I don't want to win but share my experience. Merry Christmas every vault dweller from any fallout game, carry on batteling the wasteland.😀
---
As mentioned they are working on it. They announced it months ago and said it would be out next year.  Such a simple addition that already has been done by modders for so long. They are terrible at updating this game it pretty sad.
---
I don't know how many times I've swapped cards out for crafting or selling stuff and then forgot to swap them back out. Usually end up noticing in the middle of a fight when I'm suddenly out of AP or taking way to much damage.  I don't even bother picking locks above level one because I don't feel like swapping perks and then forgetting to swap back.  Once you unlock lockpick and hacking perks you shouldn't have to go switch them out to begin with.  They should be passive since everyone swaps them in and out anyways.  I doubt there are very many builds out there which leave them on 24/7 so why try and make it a compromise situation to begin with?
---
how bad are we talking about mate
---
I'm not angry at all, why make baseless assumptions?  Do you just assume anyone who cares more about facts than feelings as being angry? LoL
---
It was never crap. You were misslead.
---
It still has bugs though. If you cry and every little glitch in a game I would pass. But it's really fun, which for me is what matters mosy.
---
Gave a few away to someone last night who was selling the plasma grenade plan for 150 caps.
---
This guy should get a disc, he would be an asset to the game, one I would do all possible to help(assuming he/she is on Xbox)
---
Well i appreciate your honest view on the game, im a guy who really has limited to time to game now a days due to my job. might not be a game for me by the looks of it, quick question. hows the PVP like if there is any, im a guy that really enjoys pvp.
---
I will just say that I'm a PvP player in every single game, I love PvP. But in this game I just can't stand it. Fallout 76, along with BDO, has the worst PvP I've ever seen in a videogame.
---
You (or others) might think that I say this because I hate the game or something like that, but it's the truth. PvP, apart from being very limited since they removed the Survival mode, revolves around hiding and one-shotting enemies - in my opinion, that shouldn't even be considered PvP.
---
I hear ya, but I paid real life money for it. When I used 2 hours of my real life time to play the other day I had 3 crash to desktops and 1 server disconnect. I just play other games instead and have headache free good times. I still enjoy F76, at times.
---
After all went quiet in the house last night I went and made 3 Excavator power armor level 25.
---
I had a plan to make one for each day until new year but after it took me 1.5 hour last night to give away 3 of them I'm not so sure if I want to do that. :D
---
Most people did just think I was stalking them and teleported away before I was able to drop them the PA.
---
If anyone of them are here on the sub I can just say. Hope you like the PA and a Merry Xmas.
---
I'm not sure if I could keep playing on pc with all them hackers
---
I'll agree with you that the adventure mode Christmas event is really good especially for the rare plans that seemed almost impossible to get like the plasma grenade I'd given up on that then got 1 on the first set of presents I made but the Christmas rewards on nw are really easy to get and only require low xp to get, the hat and outfit are a bit more challenging but again they're nothing special to look at so I dont really think anything amazing is tied behind the nw game mode where ppl would feel like they have to play it or miss out on something, to be fair the best christmas camp building item for me personally is the Santa crash and that is a adventure mode event reward easily obtainable the nw Christmas rewards are no where near as good as that but that's personal opinion
---
scriping most them, at least up to the daily limit.  Giving some away
---
Sold a few of the lower level ones (5 and below) n my vendor.  Given another high level bough them, I’d venture said high level was either equipping an alt, or using them for Scrip.
---
For the higher level stuff, hanging on to it for the moment - need to take the time to toy with combos to see if i can get a better set than what I currently wear.
---
Since most of my current armor is WR, its a bit more complicated than just the raw DR/ER value
---
Have fun getting your inventory stolen
---
I remember seeing one video that was like "BROKEN FO76 LET'S YOU SPAWN THE PRYDWIN IN GAME" or some kind of freakout title.
---
It was made on the same day the patch for that came out... After the patch came out iirc.
---
Like, they can't even be sensationalist in a timely manner.
---
There’s so many videos like that where the outrage youtubers who make them don’t understand even the most basic terminology or gameplay mechanics. I’ve seen ones where they try to say that steel and wood are “very rare junk items”
---
I kissed a girl and I liked it
---
I have not got garbage from her. I did better paying my 100 scrip instead
---
Angry joe, Yongyea, legacykilla, Clown prince, just to name a few of those channels who make outrage videos over this game but don’t even have a slightest grasp on the games mechanics
---
The other day, I gave a level 2 half of my holiday gifts, a few low level legendary weapons, full set of deep pocketed leather armor, some stims, and a power armor chassis.
---
Its a hacking forum, can't link it here against the rules. Just do a bit of googling and you'll find it.
---
Santa puts Fo76 in stockings if you’re naughty 😂
---
During Thanksgiving or black Friday, since if the challenges were "scrap x clothing items" and "scrap x pre-war money".
---
If you just want the rewards, turn team off and hide in a bush. Here's what I do:
---
Start in the middle of the map, but near a structure. 
---
Find a case so you have a weapon for the random animals, and so you have a chance at the end. 
---
Hide in a bush.
---
Only move if the storm will kill you, then hide in another bush.
---
If you make it to the end, jump out and shoot!
---
I played 3 times last night, made it to 10, 6, and 3.
---
Theres a video online of like 500 players being robbed by 1 guy. It's way more than just a few.
---
It will always be 3 stars.  I imagine other than the fact you don't know if it will be ranged, melee or armor it is the same RNG.
---
I think it's great to have a general detail on this issue so It can go bethesda quicker! If you think they are just negative I think you maybe have a issue yourself.
---
Currently my bush game is not as good as frog legs and people's hide and seek skills. Lol.
---
Same rolls. Basically it’s a cheaper option pay 60 scrip for random 3 star item. A 3 star weapon is 100 so it’s as much as 40% cheaper.
---
Was hoarding .38 ammo, when I encountered a level 10 player. Saw that he used pipe weapons and gave him about 15000 rounds. He was very happy with it.
---
I only have this happen when I'm trying to inspect and repair off my favorites bar. What platform would probably help.
---
Passive perk slots is actually a gold idea. Or just perk types that don’t count to the full set. There is no game on earth where loadout management is fun.
---
They don't care about the players either way, they just want their stuff, and can never have enough.
---
This was on ground/rock. Was a jackolatern. Was green and showed to be good... And upon placement, disappeared into the unknown lol. So no clue what happened, and I can only assume it's inside the ground lol, lost forever as I'm not redoing my base anytime soon lol
---
&gt; if they are getting paid, why would they ever stop doing it
---
Putting aside the fact that some people actually enjoy the game, and actually want to play it for what it is, are you trying to say that people who paid for the game, and who have long long since lost any opportunity of asking for a refund, shouldn't be able to play the game and at least try and get their money's worth?
---
And, again, it's a shame that the game doesn't meet your standards, but it does do that to a lot of people, and you don't get to decide anything for them. If they want to play the game, they can play the game, and it would be super nice of you and everyone else if they didn't have to be demonized for liking a thing.
---
Yes daddy, tell your secrets
---
This is not even a hack, since there's no third party software involved. It's just a simple local file edit which works because servers don't even check for client's file integrity. All it takes is to send a script to open actor's (player's) container for a server to initiate and the server will unanimously comply with your request.
---
This is why you don't run MMO servers on the client, folks.
---
Unlucky
---
Right
---
There are a lot of holidays that happen in 2 years
---
Seeing these comments makes me feel a little bit less bad about playing on my mom's potato internet. I'm often wondering whether it's Bethesda causing lag, shitternet being stupid, or the two joining forces. It's much better when I'm at home with the husband (real one, not Farkas, lol), but disconnects and crashes still happen on the regular.
---
Welcome. To. Our. *little* Enclave
---
I was awarded 250 coins a few days ago and I was trying to find someone to gift it to, keep being positive and Merry Christmas!! Enjoy the silver!
---
Just random encounters with other people.
---
They shoot thing, I help out.
---
I shoot things, they help out.
---
Then we go off to our separate things.
---
PvP is based around having the best gear and being specifically geared toward it, in general. A lot of the PvP that I've seen is people using a select variety of weapons and stealth technology meaning you'll just get melted out of nowhere. I've had some really fun PvP with friends who don't use these items.
---
The game as a whole is geared toward pve content, but you might enjoy the Nuclear Winter game mode which is a battle royale, and actually a lot of fun.
---
I'm sitting on main until my main stops producing enough for daily script. 
---
Got about 1800lbs of armor and a bit over 800 in weapons.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t modding 76 mess up things? And weren’t we promised loadouts months ago?
---
I went to your subreddit. I read the definition of "gatekeeping". It doesn't apply to what I said. *I* get to decide who I wish Merry Christmas (or, in my case, Hyvää Joulua) to, and to whom I have no wishes of any kind.
---
Other than that, yeah...I really *don't* know what else is up.
---
Ouch. I'm assuming you've tried logging out and back in? I've had that fix it a couple times as well...
---
The world isn't all rainbows and shit my guy, if a game lets me run rampant doing whatever i please its not my fault , its the games fault. You're just naive
---
Same people that would steal from thier own mommas no doubt.
---
On PC? Yikes. Enjoy getting hit by that new gear stealing hack that’s going around like crazy rn.
---
Thanks! I’ll keep waiting
---
You know, I forgot about Juicehead explaining all that and bring the same person. I thought it was someone else, so I take back what I say. Someone else modified it didn't they? I've seen people on Xbox trading strangler heart power armor with a glitch, so the point this guy made a whole mod to try it and someone else modified it is crazy.. this guy wasn't so bad, but the ones who modified it to take everyone's things, he is an asshole. It may or may not have been 532 people, but it was still a large number of people without all their items now. I'm just glad I don't play on PC too
---
Roger Roger, gatekeeper.
---
Only option sadly is to place your CAMP again and restart, this will store items lost in terrain to your stored items/blueprints. 
---
It sucks especially when you've heavily built up your CAMP but lose a high budget item like a turret
---
I love how quickly they were removed.
---
Looks like they replaced it with a quick link in the repair items screen.
---
Gave my victim a proper burial. Well....she dug the hole, to be fair. OH! You mean in the game?
---
Over 700 because I am usually top 5
---
I wasn't hit that's true but I was lucky.  My client crashed for the 20th or so time so far due to the aid menu bug right around when it all started so I took a few minutes to see what was up here and I saw the first posts popping up here and took them seriously.  I also had to be up early the next morning for work so I wasn't able to get on most of the day while it was happening.  After it was patched I was back on in adventure mode a few minutes after the servers came back up despite not knowing if the patch had fully worked.  If my client hadn't crashed I would have still been in adventure mode for another hour or so before calling it a night.
---
A game so depressingly bad that it helps your irl depression
---
I’m gonna give you to count of ten, to get your ugly, yella, no-good keister off my property, before I pump your guts full of lead! 1, 2, 10!!!
---
How this game has 15,000 players currently as of speaking right now, as stated on Steam Charts is beyond me.
---
I did - I got raped buy that guy. in his video thats my airship at the 3 minute mark - here is my chapter one IMGUR you can see the airship there.  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)  it really sucked but I dont blame beth I blame the hacker. I adjusted my role and playstyle to use vanilla now. I like the game that much, and its actually better playing vanilla. its the sweet spot of difficulty I didnt know I was looking for. here is chapter 2  [https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2](https://imgur.com/a/gaM6Jw2)  the tyhing is no matter how good a security sytem is it can always be bypassed by someone determined enough. it doesnt change the fact that 76 is the most interesting game on the market at this time. If I get hacked again I can remake my Items, If my character gets deleted I can be fighting the queen in 2 days in the exact same set up, if my account gets hacked I will buy another one, starting from absolout scratch would probably take me 3 days to be back fighting the queen. 
---
I like this game more than anything else on the market. nothing you say or anything any hacker does is going to change that. you can say I am a shill if you want to. but I am not getting paid by beth I am paying sub fee happily. but this hack attack did do one thing it has pushed me so far into beths corner now I will keep paying the sub even if I get tired of playing it now.
---
I dont think the scrapbox is needed at all. For anyone. I largely think its over rated. You still have to go out and collect the scrap, whats the difference if you do it now or later? 3000 screws isnt going to help you. Lol.
---
I've gotten lots of holiday gifts from Fallout76
---
Never use to like Fallout 76, I use to bash it a lot and say how I’d never play it.. then I decided to play it and ever since then I’ve been hooked. I’m literally addicted to it and have been for a good 3/4 months. It is buggy, and laggy, that’s not hard to deny and it is frustrating, but the game isn’t as bad as what people make it out to be. It’s a great game, just needs to improve loads.
---
That's really odd. I love the card the jump height was a nice jump
---
If you and your two friends are on PC, add me (IGN= Coxinga) and I'll have something nice for all three of you!  :-D
---
Ok I've just checked with my ps pro no issues logging on so servers are up. You may have to submit a ticket
---
So you think that people who like this game "have very low standards", but at the same time you think those people who you have such a low opinion of somehow owe you something, and should give up on what they enjoy now just so you can potentially have something you enjoy in the future.
---
Why should anyone who you think so lowly of do anything that benefits you, though? Perhaps you don't *deserve* those "better games" you're thinking you'd have if people didn't play this game. Did you ever think of that?
---
Yeah I know the servers are up. Like i said i can get into a world but after a few minutes the game automatically goes into a loading screen and then I get that error message I mentioned at the main menu. 
---
I've already submitted a ti key but being Christmas day I'm not expecting a response back today so I thought I'd see if anyone where has had a similar experience while I wait on a response to my ticket.
---
you are like the nosey neighbor who has no life and should be minding your own business. the hacker did this not beth dont trash me and my community members because we wont let hackers tell us what games to play. if you support hackers you are just a boot licking sycophant.
---
The point of the hack was originally to transfer Raid armor between toons. It obvious got used and abused by people trying to get this game's security in a better place. If only they return the gear after freaking someone out.
---
Raid armor should be tradeable. Strangler Armor should be tradeable. ATX workshop items should be buildable in friend's camps. If they were, there wouldn't be as much motivation to create these kinds of tools.
---
I'd be more willing to buy ATX items (and Atoms) if it meant I could gift them to other players. I'd love to roleplay a quest giver, but script and caps are too easy to come by for rewards.
---
* Shared storage across characters.
---
* Bigger camp budget.
---
* Unlimited ammo storage.
---
* Access to test servers before releases.
---
* Extra character slots.
---
Maybe i'm greedy.
---
The idea that we are funding future development makes me feel FO1st should give early access to possible future features.
---
There’s always going to be hackers, hating them is understood as a for sure annoyance. The point is Bethesda should have done this waaaaaaaay before so these hackers could t have run this rampant. But it wasn’t done. Yes I hate the hackers that did this but they were only able to do it because of Bethesda’s lack of foresight and care of their players.
---
I stay back at the fire and move while it is quiet. I have a place I spawn that tends to stay around the middle of the safe zone. It is also next to a safe so I usually get good armor and/guns off the bat. There are times I die within the top 20 but I usually make it to 5.
---
Rebuild your database. Fixed issues for me sometime back
---
Maybe a 5.56 receiver? Somewhat lower damage (not sure what number would be the best, but -12.5% would make it about equal per shot to a powerful automatic assault rifle), but more common and cheap to craft ammo.
---
All of the you tubers who are over 30 years old lol
---
I felt the need to thank them because of how fast they fixed it given the timing of the hack.  I have no proof of this but I think the hack was timed for Sunday night because they knew all the people who would normally fix this would be on vacation and most likely out of town going to see family.  They probably hoped it would go for a week or two until people got back from their vacation.  This didn't just affect our holiday but it affected their holiday also.
---
Bah humbug! Sorry buddy. 😖
---
How long did that process take? I've never done it before?
---
Like 2 min
---
I like to build camp necessities, such as crafting tables or generators, for low level players. I find it odd how many level 20-60s don't even have a fusion generator yet, but I'll build them one. I prefer to do it for anyone under level 20 though.
---
One time I built an entire camp for someone for free. Not doing that any more, because he just kept asking for more. /r/ChoosingBeggars/
---
You poor bastard
---
yeah I thought I probably wasn't the first. A lot of the other headgear options don't fit that well over the mask though. But this one does alright I think. I just hope they keep this glitch or even expand it to add an extra layer of customization.
---
Oh wow. I was expecting you to say half a day like de-fragging a computer back in the day did lol
---
the game is fine its the hacker who is to blame. and the poster speaks the truth even while the hack was live I experimented and ran the silo 3 times using vanilla gear. and we killed the queen with vanilla weapons as a community.  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)  &lt;- thats my airship you can see it in the you tube video around the three minute mark. fuck him and all hackers like him. its my game bro I will play it if I want.
---
5mm would be more accurate. Remember you can craft only x36 bullets (both from 5.56 and .308 with ammo smith equiped). The light machine gun was this way in new vegas, however im sure they are basing it off the automatic rifle that was added in dead money which used .308.
---
Atom bless us, everyone.
---
Honestly the only experiences (minus a few nice people) have been toxicity and just generally bad so I don't really meet the right people I guess lol
---

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis.

I had to google around for them myself nuka crypt andnukes dragon didnt have them yet. they are.

C 3904 9838
---
I have only fires off alpha silo so I can confirm the first code is good I am only assuming on the second two.
---
Nuka-bar at WS usually has at least one for sale.
---
I find the majority of the ingame community is awesome... I thought the stealing hack was PC only? I'm on XBox too
---
Also, if anyone offers you Vintage Nukashine, take it, it basically, *basically* boosts your level like, 5 times for a period of time, very useful.
---
When did you last launch from alpha ? I tried Charlie with that code this morning and got no luck
---
On pc i almost only encounter nice people. Im always receiving free items from random players. Theres been a few instances where players have stolen my workshops and stiff like that. I wouldnt call that “toxic” though as its part of the game
---
Lol love seeing this comment. Says so much about a person and how they get their information.
---
Yeah I thought and I'm pretty sure it is pc only but idk tbh
---
I often find missing items on my roof
---
I havent had any issues since my first raping. I hopped in the anti rad shower and made myself clean again and then tweaked my build to run with weapons I built myself and that can be easily replaced.
---
The B25 is better actually, SBQ doesnt recieve any explosive damage, from weapons like this.
---
Keep in mind that these youtubers are NOT members of the press, they are not reporters and they only care about the clicks.  They don't have to do any research, as there is no one but the viewers to hold them accountable.  They are NOT journalists and shouldn't be viewed as such.  They are ENTERTAINERS, that's all.
---
There is always one on the floor in the building @ uncanny cavern.
---
According to Nukacrypt, those are last weeks codes. Maybe they didn’t change?
---
If you're on a console and can afford it, I highly, highly recommend getting an SSD. It cuts the actual loading screens in half, and it only takes a couple seconds for all the assets to load in once you're in the world.
---
I mean I'm not a very high level but I always take the converted munitions factory in the top right of the map, most of the people who take it are really high levels and when they kill me and take it they just message me calling me bad or trash so ig it's just some people
---
Wrong. But these weapons do have value. Especially cause rifle and pistol perks buff it.
---
But I'll take a lever, handmade, fixer, combat over those for high level enemies.   But I love busting out my pipe Revolver for farming in low level areas.

That'd be nice and all if radshield wasn't so hard to make, I rarely ever see strangler blooms and those are the main ingredient!
---
about three hours ago. I took a christams breakfast and nap :)
---
5 mm could be useful as an option, too, although I suspect the damage would need to be reduced more significantly to keep it balanced with other guns and mods. In my opinion, it could even have been fair to make 5.56 the default for the LMG and make the gatling gun use .308 instead (maybe slightly improve the fire rate to compensate), comparing the base damages to rifles using the same calibers.
---
Fuck off
---
I’ve seen some along the rows of Whitespring cottages/shops. Usually on the porches and usually have been knocked off of the tables, so look on the floor.
---
I am on PC so I should clarify that the pc community has been super nice for the most part. I know nothing of the X-Box community after this hack I have considered getting one now though lol.
---
I’ll give alpha a go, I’ll report back in about 15 minutes
---
It's not. I got shit load of melee and ranged shit.
---
I'm guessing it loads faster for other people because they already have most if not all of the various camp objects loaded into RAM after visiting theirs and others' camps. You on the other hand need to wait until all of that stuff is loaded in the first time.
---
I can confirm that these are the correct codes as solved by the nuka crypt team yesterday at 4:14pm PST.
---
"we will be rolling out a $5 patch to fix this".
---
And more XP per kill.50 to 100 per. Maybe a sliding scale, more XP for early( 1st ring)  kills, as this will speed up the mode, and is balanced by the big chunk of XP you get for surviving.
---
Usually when the strangler heart event starts that flower blooms. Try then.
---
I think your right that ATX stuff should be buildable in friends camps.  I don't know a lot about the Raid armors so there might be a good reason for making it non-tradeable.
---
I try to gift supplies to low levels. But it’s prolly an alt of a level 380.
---
Yeah lol the pc community has it's rare people who just hack and cheat but Xbox just had toxic sweats who tbag and stuff, I definitely would recommend an Xbox for other games tho
---
The above is correct, but sadly, even if out of 1000 people, only 1 happens to be a turd scumbag, that's all that is needed to sour others.
---
One person can do a lot of harm, and for these people that IS their game, to spread as much anger, hurt, and disappointment they can.
---
Honestly, of anyone I've actually 'spoken' to (IE not including the type who try to do the 2-3 way force pvp to destroy your camp, or the 'hackers' who steal everything you are carrying, etc) was top notch. Every single person I have had any communication with has been wiling to assist, was polite, and respectful when they themselves receive help.
---
But as I said, it just takes one single angry edgelord to turn people away.
---
The shinning sounds really painful.
---

---
Sunk cost fallacy to some extent. But yeah, this entire sub is basically r/stadia. Sad and borderline delusional. I’m a huge fallout fan but I won’t tolerate this treatment, much less support it with my time and money. But if you are willing to support sub par and abusive business tactics, this is what you will continue to get.
---

legendaries are my enemy now I throw them all away never to be introduced into the trade cycle. that tech is to dangerous for humanity. Ad Victorium brother
---
XBOX ONE X 
---
THIS HAPPENS IN THE PIPBOY NEARLY EVERY TIME I EAT OR DRINK AS WELL
---
😔😔😔
---
Yeah I've seen alot of nice people more recently (especially the low levels) but there are still a lot of people who are just toxic and scummy and just try to ruin other people's days
---
Well, I wish you the best of luck. 
---
I hope this epidemic ends soon.
---
weird that this is happening to you because just yesterday i started having volume issues when playing this game and in a party. i don’t get static but i do get some kind of distortion. when someone else talks all sounds become distorted for me, but if i play alone everything sounds fine.
---
Worse than a lump of coal.
---
Also, we have usernames on PC; not gamertags.
---
Worst gift of all time
---
This sounds like something someone from Manhattan would say after 9/11
---
Jesus you all sound like beaten wives.
---
The PC version is prone to hacking due to besthesda lack of care for an actual anti cheat device.
---
Just "hack" here to get an understanding of whats happening so you dont get blindsighted.
---
In fact, you are better off on console.
---
Also look up fallout yongyea and jim sterling to get an idea about this game :3
---
kek, the downvotes for mentioning youtubers alone, oh boy :D
---
Red rocket workshop has 5-6 different machines that all have a chance to spawn quantum. Dyer chemical 3-4 machines, 1 in flatwoods, 1 in front of golf club at WS. Tnt domes 4 and 7, if you have the keys, have nuka spawns. Inside enclave bunker. I'm sure I am missing tons, but red rocket is my main farm.
---
The ammo factory is a waste of time and puts a giant "PvP me" sign on your back. There's literally no point in claiming it unless you want to encourage people to hunt your down and kill you.
---
I still like the game! Hope you like it.  Merry Christmas.
---
I still play this game, though its because of its the sandbox nature and definitely not some "thriving trading and social community". My friends list hardly lights up with anyone,and even if they do its one person on their private server. As for trading unless you're referring to the thriving black market scene all I see are vendors scattered about, whose presence matters as much as someone not playing the game.
---
I would argue stating something "is playable" is highly subjective. Not everyone has the patience to sidestep bugs and bad performance. And this is not even considering any paranoia from possibly loosing an item or even a whole character, hours wasted and down the drain. For me this isn't a bother, I enter the game seeking a good time regardless of the outcome and know I can incur any loss, all because its just a game to me.
---
I play the game for my own reasons, but wouldn't recommend the game to anyone in its current state.
---
Same boat here man. This is my 3rd Christmas alternating Christmas with my ex. I plan to drop a nuke to make myself feel better.
---
I just want ammo for my handmade bro
---
Gave someone a discounted Quad Explosive automatic Railway Rifle for 50 caps. They were singing Happy birthday to themself, so I felt bad and gave them the weapon for a fraction of its worth.
---
Nuking the queen definitely is good for the soul 🖤
---
Sorry you are mistaken. Scrip and cap all 5 of my toons almost everyday.
---
Oh sweet
---
It's a hell of a lot faster to just gather the mats and craft it yourself. Lucky hole mine for the lead, hit up places with super mutants and scrap their stuff for steel, and then craft away. 
---
Also, if you're having trouble maintaining ammo stock, grab a weapon that uses something common like .38 and use it when you're in low level areas so you conserve the 5.56
---
Explosive bolts, poison gland attachment, splinter bolts, i can come up with more if y’all want!
---
I turned in about 3000 scrip and got a bloody/explosive 50cal and vampire/swing war drum.  I usually get 2-3 great items whenever a sale is active.  You just have to squirrel away scrip ahead of time to allow yourself more chances when the sale hits.
---
Spent a month in the first fallout game I ever played "Fallout 3" and managed w/o modded bug fixes and w/ a non gaming PC(Dell). It was delightful and enjoyed killing children the same way Bethesda kills end user interest in this game w/ each devious thing they do and hackers.
---
Also bought new vegas but wanted graphical mods but PC could not handle it. Well, those mods are now lost but Outer Worlds does all the work for me :D
---
Cheers :3
---
Has it been fixed yet?
---
The map is a vault-tec based tourism design.....not military.
---
Yah. So with you on this. That said, none of what has pained me is enough to write a bad review. I may feel different were i a pc player with the current hack but as an xbone monkey the saving grace is pc master race haxors are busy hacking thwir own platform so the most i know of us getting is people utilizing exploits and glitches which is annoyong but fair
---
If you've never done a ps4 database rebuild before then it could take a good 15 minutes or so, but it does help. It is similar to a Defrag like you mentioned. I suggest waiting until all of the thumbnails finish loading afterwards as well. I try to do a dB rebuild every time there is a large update, it's quite easy to do. Beyond this suggestion, I don't know what else would help.
---
FWIW not all masks sit on top of it. They disappear behind it. 
---
Tested:
---
-	plague doctor - no
---
-	scientist goggles - no
---
-	half skull mask - no
---
That was fixed already.

Placing items in peoples inventories is very malicious because people can place items such as the legendary item boxes that can flag your account or scorchbeast scream attacks that will corrupt your character upon log out
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYPOBrMWM8E
---
I ready did it. Only took 4 minutes. The problem still persists. I think I may have to reinstall the game.....again
---
Maybe not for Christmas but over the course of the last year, helped and have been helped by a ton of people into having the best items and weps in the game simply by sharing and understanding each other. Christmas isn't the only time for sharing
---
Then why the fuck are you jerking them this passionately? It's not like they implemented a permanent fix, merely a patch that hackers will find a way around especially that it's common for bgs Austin to roll back fixes with each patch. Man I'd pay to see how your post would have been in an alternate timeline where you got hacked naked.
---
And it looks like a little spotted tongue sticking out too. Lol
---
I usually just use melee weapons in low level areas and use my handmade in high level areas, the reason I can't build ammo is because I'm still building my camp near whitesprings and use most of the resources for that, but thanks for he advice my dude
---
yes :)
---
Yes where are you confused? There's multiple holidays this month alone.
---
A lot rides on Wastelanders and it’s reception.  Remember the roadmap has already changed.  The wastelanders icons changed from an icon that indicated companions to one that is about new weapons. 
---
If wastelanders is received well, we’ll get more story content over time I’m sure. If not... I don’t expect much except for the game to be put on life support.
---
My personal opinion is that they will push back wastelanders to Q3 so that they can fix bugs, add anti-cheating system, improve nuclear winter mode and work on fallout 1st content. I don't think we'll get a roadmap since they probably don't plan on adding too much to this game anymore. It's pretty obvious by now.
---
I took a pic with ol' Mr torrence he's thawed out a bit since the last time we saw him
---
there's a mod for that.
---
I think if they phrased it better it would make sense. So the hackers or script kiddies can't steal your license for making atom shop items, but they can acquire them for free by stealing the copy you have. There's a visible net gain: hacker has atom shop item, you can just build a new one. However that hacker didn't have to expend atoms, either monetarily or time, to earn the item.
---
Good for you that’s really awesome I’m seeing fewer and fewer santa scorched and when they show up they always drop one star item but it’s ok better than nothing since legendary scorched is very rare before the event so all is good merry Christmas to you too
---
It's the gift that keeps on giving.
---
They said fuck PC long time ago since they haven't ever dealt with hackers and cheaters plaguing NW to this moment. They knew about it for a while yet they chose not to do shit. Fairly certain at some point the hack will be back again just like everything they "fix".
---
💡 Good idea
---
Scrap box should be available to everyone just with a 200lb cap. 
---
Wouldn’t bother me. At. All.
---
I dropped the ultricite armour you get from the belly of beast quest after I repaired to 200% to a random lvl 35
---
Well the plot thickens. I don't get "unknown error" now for the message. I get "disconnected from server" for the message. The behavior is the same though. I can load into a world just fine but after a few minutes I randomly get a loading screen and then in back at the main menu with this new message that says "disconnected from server".
---
I kinda of like this idea, but the op is about getting many Bobby pins(in a small exploit), and aside from that, I still end up with 20 or 30 more than I started with, each game session, and I generally run all 3 lockpicks unless doing serious business (raid,SBQ, project Paradise...). Ghouls drop and lowest lvl loot table. Bobby pins aren't rare IMO. And as already mentioned they have a little weight.
---
I think your intimidation mode is broken
---
Same here! Its always hard around x-mas without my mom and my dad. At least I have my husband and his family. See you in Appalachia.
---
That's fixed...
---
Lost mom in November, last of my family, and been a rough year but keep having warm happy feels come from this game. Though don't have a community or friends group yet people are surprisingly nice in general and I want to say thanks to the community as a whole for not being rampaging reeking wrecking rectal rodents.
---
I thought F76 would bring out the worst in people as a rule and I was very wrong and it makes a bitter gamer proud~
---
Most of the community is toxic and mean? On PS4 it couldn't be any more different. Been an awesome community experience on the PS4.
---
I kind of like the idea of having a GPS though.  It would make explaining the location of interesting spots a bit easier when they aren't near a named location.
---
Plus you could tie it into a Treasure Map kind of thing.  Go to these coordinates, dig.
---
Is this a brand account?
---
The lesson here isn't trust. :D
---
Dude, there are no low levels, just alts. I mean, does anyone still buy this game right now?
---
go have xmas dinner with your family
---
My camp is absolutely maxxed out in budget, lol, i spend way too long doing that
---
So how about a quest for the B.O.S. to upgrade to the military version (that must've existed)?
---
Not all of us are lucky enough to have that privilege
---
I have a level 5 legendary weapon for you. My ign is Rlauntz53
---
Slow reloading time? As someone that’s been playing a heavy gunner since launch, with Speed Demon equipped I can assure you the reload time is lightning fast. I’ve had a 2* Mutant’s Explosive LMG for months and it’s just a crazy weapon.
---
Me and 3 other friends would stay up all night playing fo76 doing nukes and whitesprings. Fun times
---
Love it. It’s only a one star but with sneak perks I can get 2400 damage per shot. I’d be lost without it.
---
But it's not a military game...
---
There should be an option to change maps like let's say, collectibles? Maybe like a quest for different kinds. Grid maps do exist in game like at train Stations and military bases.
---
Merry Christmas to ya and Merry Christmas to ALL Fallout 76 dwellers!!🎁🎄🎅🎅🎅
---
Others will probably correct me, but the raider robot vendor at the factory to the east of Top of the World and the BOS vendor at Watoga Super Duper mart have plans. However,  you may not be able to see those plans without doing certain quests. IMHO, it's totally worth it to do the quest that makes the Watoga bots friendly. 
---
Oh,  and up by Top of the World,  there's a row of raider "shops" made out of shacks and stuff. There's always a ton of plans along there and I have occasionally come across PA plans.
---
I have never played a game that was not exploitable.
---
I actually loaded some of those in my party bowl and left it next to my shop says Grab and Go next to it
---
Buckle up
---
A quadbow is awesome for doing the Tadpole missions for your backpack.
---
Yes let us download as many different versions as there are, into our pipboy to use as needed.
---
God, thinking "yeah I'm prepared to go over to this giant camp I bet it has good loot" I dodged the first one but after that I realized I did almost no damage to this thing. I considered running but didn't stay below the statosphere long enough to make my choice. I just saw that club slam down and with that I was in space arms and legs outstretched and ready to respawn and never fight one again.
---
well I've been playing mmo's now over 20 years and only time I've never seen this level of people going out of their way for just random people
---
Nice, Merry Xmas to you as well
---
Yep, its my wallpaper on my desktop.
---
Pretty much all of the non-FO4 weapon lack in mods, rather disappointing.
---
Indeed, I doubt this kind of hacking related hysteria is beneficial to the for profit dupers selling gear on eBay, it drives away players, reduces demand (why buy something for $500 when it could be stolen the next day?), and might lead to draconian anti-hacking measures that make the "business" more difficult.
---
I mean ps4's community is nice on most games but there are some games where everyone is toxic, I haven't played fo76 on PS4 so idk what the community is like
---
Its an open sandbox where death is inconsequential, as well as your gear and weapons. There's no story or meaningful quests, so I'm comfortable just roaming about and taking pictures of other players with their cute camp setups. I pop in and stress relief by blowing cars and enemies up, with no regard to order.
---
Would I seriously recommend the game? No, not at all. Its my own guilty pleasure. I actually recommended Destiny 2 to my friends instead, since its overall a better multiplayer experience.
---
So is mine, but a lot of budget is taken up by doubled "interior walls" to make the wallpapers work properly. If they gave us walls that you can paper both sides of, I'd have quite a bit of my budget freed up.
---
Even better, holotapes that change menus in the pipboy and map. Complete upgrade holotapes.
---
I distinctly recall joining the Army, going through basic combat training, receiving my graduation certificates, countless obstacles at the DMV while trying to get my military ID, gaining membership to a paramilitary organization, and all of it culminating by achieving the rank of general officer in the U.S. Army.
---
IDK, seems like a military game to me but YMMV I guess.
---
I run wwr armor on my heavy gunner. I enter my power armor after I reach my destination and it does make me become over encumbered by about 2x. It doesn't bother me a whole lot because I use my heavy as a sort of "stationary turret" support specialist. I can still run around, but I can't sprint. Jet pack acts funny too when overencumbered. The only thing you have to watch out for is exceeding your max weight by 3 times, it will make you not be able to run anymore and you have to walk (crawl) and also it drains ap quite fast.
---
These are so clever.
---
A Zealots primed weapon is awesome, I have a Z2515 primed that is great if I don't want to run Bloodied at a SQB event.  All non-Bloodied/Junkies ranged player's should consider a Primed zealot's for Queen events, you can often get solid zealot weapons cheap.
---
So instead of helping people I should do what? Be a bitter Christmas Grinch who is attempting to insult people for having fun? 
---
Happy Holidays and I hope your heart grows three sizes today :D
---
The writting Mass effect Andromeda in the first minute of the game when your dad dies due to a broken face shield and you just watch him die without sharing your oxygen...because then you can be the captain.  I thought "Wow this game is really stupid" and had to stop....Then the reports of bugs and glitches came out and the person I was watching on Youtube who loved M E said they were not having fun playing it, it was so strange.
---
I persoanlly think perks should be locked in unless you craft a 'special mutation' that allows you to swap perks around.
---
But on that note, I think also a player should have a 'battle' list of perks and a 'support' list, allowing both at once (Lock pick for example is not battle related, and it should not 'replace' accuracy perks)
---
Never had that happen at the Purveyor, certain events and legendaries in low-level areas it is normal.
---
I love that you checked off the sledgehammer first. 1st time I equipped one, I thought something had gone terribly wrong with my game audio. Needless to say I don't use the rocket sledge, ever. That "white" noise is so annoying.
---
I went to a school for 13 years. Does that mean I'm a school? You joined the military as a ruse, not to become a soldier. Fallout Games aren't military Games, weak logic won't change that. Fallout is a satirical post-apocalyptic role play game.
---
I think the Fixer would be my choice for an SA rifle.  There are higher dmg rifles ( railway/guass) but I prefer the handling and fire rate.
---
I dont know what heavy weapon you are using sir. I carry literaly one of each, and the slowest for me atleast is the gatling plasma, and then the lmg. I do have the speed demon mutation, but I dont equip the lock and load perk (sadly because none of my heavies are reduced weight, so I often running around with bear arms). So maybe thats why.
---
Yeah most times in game I don't have any issues with anyone. Most don't talk but the ones that do I've had some good conversations. Granted I'm on PC. There will always be some jackasses in any game.
---
There is truth in this. We def need to get more weqpon mods accross the board.
---
It makes you a student. Like how joining the Army makes you a soldier.
---
The Army and its soldiers are part of the military btw.
---
Fo sho? Actually, it’s spelled “Fus Ro Dah” I believe.
---
Most people on Xbox don't talk but those who do are mostly nice
---
Instigating lever action silenced with sneak perks and rifleman perks. At night I get 2400 per shot during the day about 1500. Best for solo IMO. If you don’t get the first shot it’s not as great.
---
These 3 are all correct. I launched all 3 last night with these codes.
---
Oh my a tuxedo and gold dress would look bomb together. I’ll have to look for this too, thanks!
---
You all deserve what you get.  You all got a million warning,  a thousand red flags,  and hundreds of reviews and instead of taking a single step back you charged forwards into this while calling everyone warning you "haters".
---
Everything you've chosen to do and chosen not to do has led you and this entire "community" into this situation and every bad thing that's come before and will come after and all of you deserve all of it. Keep calling everyone haters and making infantile jokes about dicks and balls. Name calling and white knighting on forums is probably more fun than engaging with this abortion of a game. But it won't make things better,  it won't stop what's coming,  and by continuing to support this awful company and their awful game you're just bringing more misery upon yourself.
---
So you just proved my point. You are a soldier (a fake soldier mind you). This isn't a military game. It's a game that involves - for a small portion of the story - joining the military. Thank you and happy holidays
---
Very common, tripped me up at first too. Funny looking to see your tent with the sleeping bags on top.
---
How is your internet experience on other games right now?
---
Sure... Patches, bugs, hacks, bug fix, new bugs, same old bugs not fixed, pay to win elements, no end game content, then wastelanders with added nerfs.
---
I decided against that this time to make a more decorated camp
---
You missed my last sentence I guess.
---
The Army and its soldiers are part of the military.
---
Thank you and happy holidays.
---
Nuclear winter is still listed as beta lol
---
Ah, i think youre right, my bad
---
Totally forgot about that lol
---
Trading for tier 3s that are totally worthless.. repeat. Or filing my vastly limited and full storage because I don't spend $100 a year.

---
One time I was fighting a scorch beast at the asylum. Mid fight a guy in his underwear and a clown masks runs out, kills the scorch beasts then disappears back in. I was thankful but pretty creeped out.
---
Just fine and my wife and son can stay connected on fo76 iust fine and I didnt have any problems until yesterday when I had to delete and reinstall the game.
---
Bloodied the fixer for 60 scrip, the rng God's smiled upon me, may thier praises be sung forever.:^)
---
Its a radical idea, but I feel they should just minimize effects to one card and have the effects trigger based on the level of the SPECIAL. To clarify they could reduce Hacker cards from three to one and make it so that the effect of the card is based off your intelligence level: Int 3 unlocks level 1, int 6 unlocks level 2, int 9 unlocks level 3.  This could likewise be implemented on weapon damage cards like Rifleman or even search cards like Pharma Farma.
---
I had to reinstall the game last patch and usually all patches lol. I just wanted to ask about your internet before you uninstalled.
---
I'm picky and stubborn. At this point, I'm lucky I have a second, locked floor for my family to live in and another bathroom downstairs by the sleeper porch. Used to have plants. Will definitely put them back if they ever release interior walls. Until then, I have all the benches except the brewing ones and also an unlocked scrap collector and some water resources (purified *and* dirty for cooking purposes).
---
I think I just found a player to give the coal Santatron leaves behind.
---
I uninstalled and reinstalled it yesterday so I'm thinking something didn't install correctly.
---
I use to have the crash to desktop problem and realized it was my settings that would have other programs be a higher priority.  Once i fixed that i havent had any other problems.  I forgot how i did, but you should look into it.
---
Merry Christmas/[insert your preferred celebration] to all of you who are here and those no longer with us I wish you help though the hard times and all the love I can possibly muster

arktos pharma is an end game dungeon. Don't go there yet.
---
VE fixer, Bloodied Bear Arm, and TSE Railway all in a row. Ended it with a Bolstering Powered FDC RW.
---
Just gonna keep it simple.
---
I don't own it becouse of the negative press, but I am a huge Fallout fan. Im want to try it out to see if the hate is justified. It does seem interesting, but giving Bethesda money after all the stuff they have done in the past sound horrible.
---
I had a few good moments in 76.
---
During the open beta I played with a group of friends that otherwise wouldn’t have been interested, and had a great time, though they didn’t end up getting the game.
---
Earlier this year I met someone new who ended up getting the game to play with me at what (in my opinion) was the game’s prime. We played every day for a good while and even met some other good friends there too. I’ve had a blast playing this game and wouldn’t mind sharing the experience with a few more of my friends.
---
Thanks for the giveaway, my dude, and gl to everyone else.
---
What are you pulling from my post that I enjoy seeing people get hacked? If you look at my comments I call out that hackers are shitty as well. The point of this shows that Bethesda should t have let this happen in the first place. Your beginning arguments aren’t even valid, they are straw man. Not dissing the game itself as I enjoyed it for a while, I just can’t enjoy a game when the company itself starts to neglect its player base and then it gets to a point like we are at. You can’t praise Bethesda for fixing a problem that shouldn’t have happened in the first place. Look at my previous comments, I don’t hate the game I hate the way Bethesda has treated it and it’s players.
---
I just got this for my birthday and love it! Just need people to play with and not shoot at me lol
---
Nice. Forgot I also have a garage (put the power armor station in there). Both floors have a porch. Not sure if I still have a punch bowl. Also have a piano, a lion statue, and two turrets. I love my little house. Nice and cozy and inviting to all.
---
The best experience I had in this game was watching my little sister go all out on the character creation of this game, she's always been artistic so it is great watching her show her creative side even more.
---
Of course not, that’s not the point here. When Bethesda started to notice these large scale hacks they had the option to start implementing a no cheat system, similar to steams. Instead they sat on the content that they kept churning out hoping it would get swept under. They knew this would happen and now that it has people are praising the devs for fixing something that shouldn’t have happened.
---
It should be built in.
---
Me too. Why on earth is there an 80GB update on the most busiest downloading days of the year.
---
I drop a stimpak on the ground for downed players so they can use it to get back up. If it fails I pick it back up and place it in their dropped container, but not before removing trash for recycling.
---
But you should hold them accountable, when players stop that then the company churns our games like this that are unfinished. Now I’m not taking a dog at the game itself I enjoy that. I am taking a dog at the company for allowing this shit to happen.
---
Wastelanders is probably a make it or break it type thing for this game let's all hope it's good
---
&gt;and two turrets  
---
  
---
Ah, thats where your budget is, thats ~6% of the budget right there in those 2 turrets
---
Mommy?
---
Actually the hacker originally said he was going to release it on christmas eve, so it would go through christmas day and wreak the most amount of havok since Bethesda would likely be out of office and not at all prepared to deal with a contingency like this. It just got released early for some reason, maybe the hacker had some shred of conscience and couldnt be THAT evil, or maybe someone he was working with leaked it, who knows.
---
But yeah they weren't just targeting players, they were targeting Bethesda.
---
Long shot, mute your microphone to see if it goes away.
---
Pretty much every type of heavy weapon here also. My main two are an AAE. 50 Cal and a TSE Prime Gatling Laser, my ME LMG is pretty much my PVP weapon. I also have Bear Arms active 90% of the time, not Lock n Load. I still say the LMG reload time is pretty good with just speed demon. With LnL it's lightning fast.
---
You can argue with these type of guys.
---
Half the robots are military oriented
---
You launch nukes from missile silos
---
Half the weapons have the word combat in them
---
You loot silo codes from scorched soldiers
---
You have veribots flying around
---
No, not nearly a theme of military in this game.....
---
In survival made a group of low levels stop fighting and then I didn't kill them
---
I agree the writing did hurt it but the first part did make sense to me.  The atmosphere was pretty lethal on that planet and with only one helmet one of you probably would have died waiting for evac even with switching helmets.  You were already nearly dead when he gave the player his helmet and he died really fast after giving you his helmet.  I still enjoyed it but not as much as the other games in the series.
---
Fortnite is technically still listed as a "Beta" as well. 
---
I just enjoy the game for nothing more than killing a few hours and exploring (finding different places to set up my camp, etc). Are there things I wish would be different? Absolutely. But Fallout to me has always been not the end game, but the journey. Plus, helping out new players is rewarding  I got the game for cheap and haven't spent any money beyond buying the game.
---
You didn’t have to make a game out of the problem though. You quite literally could have gone to players and done it just the same. You’re making a joke out of the problem. Not taking a dig out of you guys helping lower levels but the way you did it was not smart. I enjoyed the game itself until Bethesda started really neglecting not and it’s player base. Just because you helped someone doesn’t mean you shouldn’t see and address the blaring problem here.
---
&gt;SBQ doesnt recieve any explosive damage
---
true, but what people always saying this forgets, is that the dmg on the explosive weapons are higher than normal and it will be more left of it after the SBQ's 70% dmg resistance is calculated ;)
---
"Danger: Bridge Out Ahead"
---
Will come across some raiders and pvp but honestly most of the time it's once every two weeks. Most people offer water and thank you for any purchases at their camp. Some people are really funny and sit in a chair or play music while you shop.
---
I'd say half of what that guy said
---
Same issue with Grognak for almost 8 months now.
---
Looks like i will be the one to get all the downvotes, but i actually like the inconvenience of having to stop and switch out cards.  It adds to the suspense since there is no pause in the game.  Plus its not like its hard to swap cards out.
---
I've heard that before, does it work like that? Thanks.
---
Base damage with all pistol perks and rifleman puts pipe and bolt over 800 base damage. No food buff, handmade dont go that high . Maybe lever...maybe but still has a slower rate of fire than the pipe revolver.
---
Thanks Santa! I appreciated the gifts 👮🏼‍♂️👍
---
Awesome
---
It’ll also counter folks hiding if you can get more do by doing something...
---
wat
---
Yeah. They're an unfortunate necessity or I'd remove them. Used to have four until I found out that placing them on the roof gives them better range and they also don't bust as often. That's when they got lowered down to two strategically placed turrets.
---
my vendor, 
---
50 caps only
---
Yes son?
---
Putting two weapons of the same base type, e.g. two different Handmade Rifles, on the favourites wheel will randomly drop one of them from the wheel. I think that bug was fixed for a short time but regressed with one of the later patches.
---
I have never in my life played a single game continually for this amount of time except skyrim and I got platinum on that 3 times and I know I am not on my own
---
Yo PC here. I don't have the game so I'll talk about Fallout 3. I would say it was the first "adult" game I ever played. I saw my best friends older brother playing it and I was enthralled. I watched him the whole afternoon and then he even let me.play a bit. I remember he was in a mirelurk nest and scared me shitless! I got the game.for my next birthday and have played every Bethesda game since.
---
Just admit defeat and put the fucker down, put it out of our and the games misery
---
If that’s the case, even though I’m a console player, locking down Pc from hacks should be a priority I think
---
I get random noise similar to a quick ticking sound when having my Lever Action equipped and ready. It's especially noticeable in the Asylum but will also happen in other places. Switching back and forth to a different gun or stowing/pulling out the rifle will reliably also switch that ticking noise off and on.
---
This is why everyone should be voting with their time and money and quit this game. Bethesda is doing Activision levels of greedy shit. I wish gamers had self control. The reason companies like this exist and are making TONS of money in profit is because gamers by and large lack self control, and have been strung along like literal addicts.
---
People DO realize these companies have studied the science of addiction and know exactly when you get your hit of dopamine from a game, right? In itself there is nothing wrong with this, but its used to leverage people into microtransactions and obsessive gameplay.
---
True, however I never see anybody talking about Bobby pins on this sub anymore and thought it'd be a neat idea to throw out there since it was on topic. 20 or 30 Bobby pins is not a lot to find in a session considering how many caps and ammo you can accumulate in the same amount of time. The Bobby pin has value in time and versatility of its position of an item. There are no perks that effect Bobby pin weight so it is universal to all players of any level or status. The only thing people would have to establish is actual value of a Bobby pin.
---
Yeah, you are right about the indicated damage via pipboy/inventory. 
---
But have you compared the actual damage on SBQ? I do 150 headshots damage with my B25 .50cal, and the same 150 with my BE .50cal despite it shows higher damage.
---
Therefore B25 weapons deal 25% more damage on an actual fight, ofc with higher ammo consumption.
---
This sub is so fuckin depressing these days. I guess that’s appropriate for the state of the game
---
&gt;Seemed like you did get worked up to me while reading it. 
---
This is your perception, and I assure you not the reality at all.
---
&gt;Why shouldn’t the community managers praise creative use of game mechanics in a survival game? It takes alot of work materials to create a trap base and I’m proud of the ones I’ve made. 
---
I never said they shouldn't, but the few choices of creative use of mechanics that they choose to praise speak volumes to their character. It would be one thing if they were actively praising other types of community efforts and creative uses of their games, but they are far more active in praising this particular type of gameplay, which just serves to inspire more of the same type of gameplay, which in the case of a kill camp is to sidestep pvp mechanics to kill a player. 
---
&gt;Most players are boring and all they do is built camps and use heart emotes and grind pve. 
---
If they are doing it this activity probably isn't boring to them, your labeling them as boring says more about you than your fellow players. 
---
&gt;  
---
I’m not against manners but there is a difference between being toxic (insulting people death threats being taking dying in a game personally and not being able to control your ego etc) and playing the game as a more pvp like experience as opposed to pve.   
---
Are you really lumping taking dying in a game personally (something you accused me of earlier in this very thread) into toxic behavior? Are you for real? Honestly I think you might be one of the very type of people that I take issue with in this game specifically. You're all for kill camps and think people who get upset getting killed toxic? Is that the right of it?
---
Moreover I’ve seen managers praise well made camps so I think you are just bias  
---
I have seen it too, rarely, and with far less positive input for anything but something that is depreciating or kills other players. It may also be possible that I'm just not seeing more of their posts praising other things, but I consider myself fairly active on this particular reddit, and if all I am seeing is their responses to these particular posts it still shows a visibility issue.   
---
As far as my own bias you have made quite a few assumptions about me already.   
---
&gt;Regardless there are defiantly nicer ways to spread awareness of a hack like this  multiple fallout youtubers covered the topic and it wasn’t prevented but the second a video gets released showing 500 players robbed and have every second post on the main subreddit are different users claiming they have been robbed it gets patched in 24 hours. So you tell me what was more effective? Unfortunately most people only respond to consequences and don’t have the foresight to react to possible consequences. As I’ve said before its better to bring problems into the open than sweep them under the rug. I’m just stating the facts and they show people have no foresight if they did no one would have been robbed and they’d be offline while the hack was live
---
If the metric you are using to track effectiveness is simply time I'm not sure you will find a more effective measure than going around and making half a thousand people miserable by stealing all of their hard earned gear to force bethesda's hand. But that too me isn't how you measure the effectiveness of reporting an exploit or hack. If your intent is to get the company to fix it, you're better off not harming other people in the process while trying to get things done.   
---
This vulnerability could have been reported without it ever being made public and never once having been used against another player, but instead the choice was to screw over half a thousand people, but I'm sure you would consider them toxic players for taking it personally given the tone of your post.
---
Come to think of it, it didn't even get a sight.
---
Honestly can’t relate (PS4). The worst I’ve ever had is a few seconds to load in my own camp which only happens when I start the game up while at my camp and not fast traveling there wafted having already been playing.
---
They require a huge resource/script sink and get RNG effects (no unyielding). They get the Destroy on Drop just like ATX gear. They use the Scout armor mods. This makes putting together a dedicated set next to impossible and extremely expensive.
---
If they were tradeable, it would get people playing the raid again.
---
cloth + acid
---
Fair enough, i just live with the risk of getting some camp damage

But that would make treasure hunting with the maps too easy...
---
Thanks for saving me spending the Atoms.
---
One minute is a hell of lot better than many games. Even ones that are a lot less resource extensive
---
I used to drop any spare plans near vault 76 and the responder church, a lot of new players were looking suspicious at me but in the end they took it as I walked away. Gave away a full set of lvl 15 raider power armour to a level 15-20 player, I do really hope it helped that guy. Feels good to give away stuff to those who need it (-;
---
Giving the holiday gifts as placeable camp items would have been a great move.
---
I imagine it’s to prevent people blueprinting the structure with paid wallpapers they don’t own.
---
I think most of the heavy weapons have the same 5 sec reload time. I use speed demon lock and load and 3rd effect reload on my .50cal and LMG and the reload time is insane since they stack.
---
Awesome, see you around! Are you familiar with the fallout franchise or is this your first dive into it?
---
&gt;This didn't just affect our holiday but it affected their holiday also.
---
Yeah, but we paid for the game and they ARE paid for the game. That's a biiiiig difference. It applies to all products and services.
---
Are you using the white knight perk card maxed out?
---
Post this shit in some other subreddit.  This one is for shit talking Bethesda and hackers and griefers.
---
This is one of my favorite reply
---
It looks really cartoonish.
---
Imagine seeing how bad this game is and then buying it anyway. People like you are ruining this industry by doing this shit. "Woah this game literally breaks every other day? Let me show bethesda that it doesn't matter how bad a product is I'll buy it anyway!" Please stop ruining gaming :(
---
The text and the pics are both kinda misleading or missing information.
---
FWIW There is a military version with grid lines. 
---
You see it in use at places like Sugar Grove, enclave bunker etc. 
---
There’s a mod to use it fwiw but it shouldn’t be required. 
---

1. Hard to say... done many over the last year.  Two immediately come to mind:   A few months ago I was helping some low level with lots of questions, then I teamed up with him for a few hours traveling around unlocking many locations for him.  Showed him Whitesprings (my fave), and that was back before the inside became a ghost town.  Lots of players were in the mall goofing off, trading, etc.
---
This is also one of my favorite not only did you give them stuff you teamed up with them and took time out of your day
---
Thats interesting because i got the same conclusion with the plasmas too. Both B25 and BE gatling doing exactly 5\*20 damage with beam splitter.
---
Great!
---
Use it in small bursts and aim for the face. Lots of decapitations and you use way less bullets. If you hold down the trigger you empty a drum real fast.
---
To ignore the fact that these people are part of the community is total denial. And no, not everyone is acting like nothing happened. You may think they failed, but they did very real damage to our community. There are a ton of people not logging into adventure mode servers right now because of this, and some who will never log back on again.  
---
They didn't fail, they just didn't kill the game, but they really did hurt it.
---
I'm the source. I was at max budget, and I tamed a pet. I've had 10 or more at max budget. Not sure when they changed it. 🤔
---
This is very wholesome
---
Bruh i just wanna play a fallout game with some friends , literally chill out
---
I get where you're coming from, but I mainly play the series because I enjoy the lore and the world of it, so I find all the vault experiments and shit interesting. But variety couldn't hurt when it comes to raids
---
Sorry no free pass, you are just as much a part of the problem.
---
Farm queens and you will never have to worry about it again 😅 I have 200 advanced repair kits I wish I could share with friends or mules. I think project paradise and encrypted also give you repair kits.
---
Thank you man
---
You only trigger the quest by picking up a new piece of tech data, not one from your stache. One is enough to get the rewards, and they will vary. I'm suddenly having an issue on PC not seeing the listed rewards for all sorts of events and quests. Some gifts aren't listing the rewards either. Just have to check my inventory to see what I've been rewarded with.
---
Okay whiteknight but guess what hypocrites showed up when i was handing out duped legacies and gid rolls
---
You are wrong. Stash space is the most precious thing. Once you have most of your dream weapons, scrip is just for fun. Maybe, trying to get a set of perfect matching armor... But no more than that. 
---
I have four characters over 100, with different builds and each one has a couple of perfect weapons. All of them have close to max scrip.
---
Just visited. Thanks again!!
---
No it will **never** be safe until you get truly private **locally hosted** worlds where you can limit access to only people you trust and **invite**. There will always be another hack because the game is just to fundamentally insecure, and you've been warned of this since the announcement. Anyone telling you this game is safe to play publicly(or on beth's "private, but not really" servers) is a fool or a liar.
---
I'd like it if they moved the quality of life perks like weight reduction for chems/weapons/food, lockpicking/hacking, food consumption perks and stuff like that to a flex spot that was separate from your other perks. Maybe you'd get one slot every 10 levels, maxed out at level 150 for a total of 15 extra points to use on those perks only.
---
I played 76 on the free weekend. And to be honest I loved it, for me, the world and it's ambiance is enough for me to enjoy it.
---
My fav game of all time is Fallout 3 (i love all fallout games obviously). I play it annualy since it was released. I don't know why but it helps me great deal with anxiety and depression. Just immersing myself in the open world and wondering around the ruins of Washington D.C, talking to people, going on quests is extremly relaxing for me. 
---
I'll never forget the first time I entered Megaton.
---
hahaha dang it, I'm doing that right now
---
BoS is the best type of armor overall.
---
Can confirm this, especially with the Camden Park dailies. No notification of completion and rewards but still receive tokens and other stuff.
---
So yeah im a gamer
---
The dev's aren't chained to their desks.  They have a life just like the rest of us.  This took a toll on them also be it financially and\or emotionally.  I would bet some of the dev's had to change their holiday plans\travel arrangements just to fix this for us.  They deserve our thanks for giving up part of their holiday to deal with this.  I don't always agree with what they put in the game or how it's implemented but I do respect their work and I thank them for taking care if it as fast as they did.
---
Yeah, I got a pic of the skeleton with an axe next to it in the maze in my photoroll.
---
Bunker down and pray for updates.
---
I felt like they could have back and forthed it.
---
That sucks, but i hope u have a good Christmas, merry christmas
---
Lol out of curiosity I went and checked my stash, My main toon currently has 355 improved repair kits.
---
Merry Christmas! May the RNG gods be with you today.
---
Why does a pepper farm make cookies is what I want to know
---
I haven't ran into alot of shitty people in fallout. It has been mostly good, not 100% sure what people meen by toxic but I think most people around still are good dudes
---
Merry Christmas! I hear you
---
Technically? yes they shuffled some deck chairs around so the steal all hack doesn't work with the push of a button presently.
---
Over the long term? No, not even close there will be another, and there always will be in public and arguably in "private" play because of the game's fundamentally insecure design. Also given beth's failure to stop this one despite all the heads up they had it can be expected that the next hack will completely blindside you, do worse, and take longer to fix.
---
Those do have weight lol. You should drop some. I am probably going to drop 100.
---
Absolutely. Playing without it is a drag to put it mildly. And to answer the other question, no I run several mods and have no issues. I have two custom ini files and I just swap them out when playing NW so the mods won't be enabled.
---
I mean on Xbox I run into people who like t-bag and then take your stuff for no specific reason other than to piss you off and idk if it's just the people I see but I see it quite often, I might just be really unlucky
---
I have a b/e fixer and lever gun, and a full uny/sneak suit.  The suit isn’t a full uny/ag/sneak forest scout suit, so I’m still looking.  I don’t have a full van/AP/sentinel suit and f/ffr/15 Fixer in case I need to be at full health yet.  Some players have higher standards than others I guess.
---
Also, thanks for instructing me as to what I should value and the proper way to enjoy the game.
---
Welcome to hell
---
Yes! May they be with us all!
---
You can put your extras into the inventory of a mule character, finish the quest, then trade yourself back one document....  repeat
---
It is true. But you won't hear about it on this echo chamber.
---
Apparently they patched it, but I’m staying on NW for the next week before I feel fully confident returning. Luckily, there are seasonal rewards on NW so I don’t feel too displaced.
---
I know I should, but I might needs them someday.  Lol, they are my weakness.
---
Once I log in, add me up -- Same user name. I got a bunch of old plans that're just taking up stash space and could probably serve a low-level character a lot of good. Invitation goes to anyone on r/fo76 really...
---
If you saved 300 you obviously know how to farm end game events 😂. You need the extra weight stash for all those limb dmg weapons mama gonna give you for Christmas haha
---
What armor pieces are you using? My BoS combat armor will go a week before repairing pieces, playing about 4 hours a day. The metal piece (because don't have a combat piece with weapon weight reduction) breaks every few days.
---
Definitely naughty.
---
&gt; This is why you don't run MMO servers on the client, folks. To actually resolve this problem would require a rework of the servers to execute all scripts server-side so that you can't even play the game if you have tampered with the scripts archive. But it isn't as easy as it sounds, so expect the servers to be down for a good while.
---
Or take the borderlands approach. locally hosted peer to peer multiplayer, friends only, don't trust randos, and DGAF what people do in thier own games between friends. 
---
But that would take giving players private play without a paywall, and sink the imaginary notions of economy, scarcity, and involuntary grinding that beth is trying to foster for a profit instead of just making a decent game.
---
Well done! Can’t say I got close at all lol
---
Light armors degrade much faster than heavy.
---
Right, I got this for Camden Park as well (XBox)
---
Yeah, there’s really no motivation to risk engaging an enemy in NW. The points system heavily rewards duration, so a lot of people just stay AFK and collect points that way.
---
I mean yeah, I wouldn’t buy this game in this horrid state either, but “ruining the game industry” is a little extreme here.
---
I know exactly how that feels. Try to have a merry Christmas.
---
Those are the nuka crypt guys.
---
You’re literally looking at this backwards.
---
So, I’m on a team. One of my team downs a player, and then gets distracted fighting another opponent.
---
Me, not seeing where the new opponent is yet, decides to cap the downed player so he can’t get rezzed by another teammate while we’re chasing the other guy.
---
I get the kill cred. My teammate, who did all the actual work, gets half as much for the downed cred.
---
I shouldn’t get any credit for that kill. I just shot a downed opponent, and my “kill” was simply a tactical decision; no effort involved.
---
I expect the roadmap to be something like: 
---
Q1/Q2 2020 - Wastelanders
---
Q3 2020 - end of support
---
I love you guys this is the best community :) happy Christmas everyone.
---
The response was they are looking into how to make it right, and give them some time to figure it out. They will reach out when they have more information.
---
Yup. If Wastelanders fails, it will be the end of Fallout 76.
---
Probably need to go in advanced sound settings and mess with your actual pc settings.
---
I wonder if they can be sued using this point...
---
I let a seemingly never ending swarm of unusually high level ghouls pouring out of the golf course clubhouse kill me almost immediately. It seemed really important to them and I'm just glad I could do my part.
---
Have it so scopes can be made or put barbs on the boots, slow building and a broken leg that can only be fixed with a special aid/scalpel. It would add more to aid and fun to a weapon I'm a fan of
---
Buddy, I met you about 7 months ago, you did (and still do) a great job with the P.K.O.A community. When I met you ingame I immediately noticed that you are a special person and a really good guy by bringing people together in a game like this. 
---
If you ever want to chat or meet up please send me a message, I should still be in your friend list:). Merry Christmas and a happy new year buddy!
---
Swap in lock n load when fighting.  It doesn’t matter if you’re overencumbered while you stand and mow enemies down.  Reloading faster seems way more important to me.
---
Not even half. Two star any flavor is not going to sell well, unless it’s TSE or IE. 
---
The Tesla maybe 2k, but hey - some people buy overpriced shit all of the time.
---
It's been said time and time again. The guy who altered the original code gave it to his buddies and told them to go crazy. Not because they want more stuff , but because he hates the game and wants to watch it burn. Which is sad for those of us who enjoy playing.
---
Personally I like riding my Scorchbeast 🤣
---
Isn't that the truth.
---
You just described fox news as well. It is why they can't broadcast in Canada because they label themselves news, even though they fall under entertainment, and not news.
---
Check your servers. Kill legendaries other than scorched right now to check
---
The fix is simple. True solo/invite only play **without** a paywall
---
Is there a free mod for that ? Only mods I find are on nexus mods which are paid.
---
Rumors only that PC is the issue now.
---
Love you !
---
🖤🖤🖤
---
Please no - at least not with PC.
---
Life's an adventure, sometimes you just got to pop open a nukashine and see where it takes you. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to YOU and all fellow wastelanders!
---
Don't expect any news about cross platform, before wastelanders has been released.
---
Possum Badge Challenges that are not able to be completed.
---
I know the badges that don't work always change (the ones that are broken), but it seems that, at minimum, 1/3 of the badges are bugged, broken, or don't register completion of tasks, at any given time.
---
And the first hit melee miss.  Also the Closed "Open" doors, that need to be closed first, then opened, all the while mobs can walk right through, or shoot you from the other side of a door that is closed to you, but somehow, strangely still open to everyone else.
---
you wasted your money lmao
---
basically all inventory and items on your character are handled client side. It is why the hackers could just send packets saying they picked up whatever legendary weapon they could think up and the server would just give it to them.
---
great work!  I love the airship :)
---
Most people I've met have been trustworthy, others tried to trick me into doing something, they learned not to.
---
I thought rule #1 was be yourself.
---
One thing can be done but beth will never take it because it'll affect the psychology of thier atom sales.
---
True solo/invite only play
---
Its works for the borderlands series those games are notoriously easy to get stuck into with 3rd party cheats, but it doesn't matter if it happens because you can cordon yourself off and play how you want with only the people you want.
---
What a bro 😂
---
dude he asked you a serious sincere question the least you can do is be honest
---
It’s always fun when you drop a fully customized weapon and it’s Ammo for new players.
---
I had at least 50 plans the first time I turned I got the quest, turned them in and had 5 left, got nothing special. It only takes one each time now.
---
Similar situation here, spent yesterday with my immediate family and today is wide open me and myself to play some FO76.
---
Does not mess up anything. Been using load out manager since release, there are several mods on the nexus that all work great.
---
Your post really got to me. Holidays are hard for a lot of people and I think that’s often forgotten. I’ve been struggling this year too. From one mother to another, here’s a virtual hug and some love.
---
It's since the last patch it's happening, mega frustrating too.
---
Swapping out a complete build is a pain in the ass to do quickly
---
I don't have experience with texture mods, but you will likely get better help on the Nexus forums if you haven't asked there already.
---
So walking up to people and asking for help to see if a person would help us so we could give them a christmas gift wasn't smart? 
---
Also I'm not making light of it we actually took up donations to replace several people we know till if/when they get anything back from bethesda - that said these people who had lost everything was the people who wanted to go out and help others even after they themselves had lost items - since they wanted to pass on the help to others
---
And it adds to the inconvenience/suspense
---
And the first time they mentioned load-outs was September
---
Why do they need to be more educated? You said it yourself “I watched a couple videos” 
---
And you wrote up a big post about them. Now other people are going to go looking for them to see for themselves... 
---
Wait do you run one of those channels? Because this would be an awesome way to market it.
---
Impish.
---
Merry Christmas love! 💖 We all wish you a wonderful 2020 new decade!!!
---
FO1st content definitely made it naughty
---
On xbox?
---
Where is this? It looks like a cool camp spot.
---
I've got two IMO god-rolls out of 2k scrip or so: an AAFFRRW Tesla and a BFSS+STR Grognak's Axe. Ain't complaining either!
---
It ultimately depends on your play style and what you like to spend hours upon hours doing
---
What a mediocre and bland response. Not only did you not take visible preemptive measures, despite knowing beforehand of this exploit. But also you took way too long to respond. And when you finally do, it's evident that you don't really know how many were actually affected nor how to recover the actual property lost. At this point I actually wonder if whomever is in charge of this dumpster fire wasn't put here against their will and they're doing everything in their power to tank it, so they can move on.
---
Game sucks, this dude youtubing or not isn't going to change that. Bethesda is crap and you're a naive fool for supporting them.
---
Ok thx

Thank you! One day I WILL visit Germany!
---
They're not really gonna have a choice the forced public play and fundamentally unfixable security flaws makes the game a big juicy target for hackers, cheaters, and griefers. Folks will be too scared to play before long without radical reforms.

Ah ok I thought you could pls e it anywhere. Thx bud
---
The prison seems to spawn them frequently, first time I went in there one machine had two in it, and by the time I cleaned the entire place out and finished the quest for the Warden it had respawned another one.
---
Really, there is nothing to do. I literally just run around the map shooting anything I see. 😂 wastelanders DLC SHOULD at least help a lot and make it more like FO4
---
From my anecdotal experience, yes. I've noticed that legendary scorched are dropping hot prefixes more often than not even in trash servers. So I personally think their pools have been tinkered with. If I'm gonna roll I'll do a westek and WS run and see what "normal" legendary enemies drop.
---
Ok thx, wait so it is safe to play on a public server for now right.
---
Best way to play
---
After the end game you need friends in the game to make it enjoyable imo. It turns into a sims-like survival game where you grind events or help others with missions. You can really get into
---
some hardcore role playing lol. For a while I was a priest with a church near vault 76 who had a punch bowl full of nukashine with a “drink me” sign on it. I don’t like grinding so I play around and just do weird stuff or help lower level players out. I think it really depends on the type of games you enjoy, FO76 isn’t like the FO games so it may just not fit your tastes.
---
Merry Christmas to you. Please don't feel alone, you have all of us😀👍
---
Also for the legendary gun disappearing. If you crash very close to getting an item/completing a quest, it sometimes won’t register it quick enough to keep the reward. It’s sucks but does happen
---
Hopefully there is someone to show you around I'd do it if we had the same console
---
Welcome to the Wastelands!  
---
 Merry Christmas!
---
Merry Christmas fam
---
I really felt that questline was so sad, Rose herself actually sounds sad, different from her normal chipper self, when she talks with you after that.  It's just tragedy, for Responders, for the Lodge survivors, everyone.  The Overseer was right, if people had been more open to coming together from the start, the Appalachians would have survived.
---
You're always welcome as part of the Vault.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
---
It is pretty silly.  Also, we need more shapes and sizes of floor and roof pieces.
---
Merry christmas bud.
---
I was with you until you blamed high level players for not doing enough damage and not the low level players.
---
I assume it's using the vanilla texture, so you would have to pull it out of the FO4 ba2
---
Its looking for the .bgsm file
---
Sending love and positive energy your way. Stay strong, it can and does get better ❤️
---
Did you actually read what he said about that?
---
It's so simple though. Stop the corporate fellatio selfsuck greed, allow players to make own custom servers with own mods, gg, everyone's happy. Like cmon bethesda it would not be the first time players made the game run better than you did by yourselves. Surely not going to be the last either.
---
Are you considering priming it? If no, why?
---
Except they didn't, that was not at all the context of what they wrote.
---
Yes, Merry Christmas all. Happy to be part of this community.
---
First has been fantastic thanks for asking
---
I always mod out people's weapons if they are under level 15, I do my part to help out. I also give marsupial serums put to people who want to jump high.
---
OMG I GOT IT TO WORK!
---
Finallyyyyyyyy!!!!
---
Sooo, the problem was.
---
Only build batches from bodyslide, don't import any MATERIAL folders, no TEXTURES, NOT EVEN THE MESH FILES.
---
Let body slide do the work for you, and the textures will come with it!
---
People actually still play this game.............? W...why...?
---
On the roof of the nuka cola factory there is a hatch with a level 3 lock inside usually spawns a few quantum's I have had as many as five spawn there at one time , sometimes none so just server hop. Good luck, enjoy your adventures and merry Christmas to all.
---
I dropped 40 of them to low levels otherwise script
---
Fallout as a game series helped me deal with a not great childhood. Growing up with abusive parents the first two Fallout games on PC were a lovely escape and helped encourage my imagination. Fallout 3, NV and Fallout 4 have been amazing games to play with my wife.
---
The queen is the same no matter who is there. If you are over level 100 and can’t beat the queen then your build needs work. When I was level 40 I had some guy send me nasty messages blaming me for not beating the queen. He was over lv200. Now that I can solo her under 5minutes and hit over 20k I know where the responsibility lies. This is also why I started by informing players to communicate with the people on the server before nuking if they themselves cannot beat the queen alone.
---
Which mods on nexus are paid? I've been using that site for years now and not a single mod is paid. You don't have to subscribe to premium, it just removed the 10mbps download cap or whatever it is.
---
They do not.
---
Okay :)
---
I do not believe so, unfortunately.
---
+karma
---
Haven’t done a SBQ fight so far so this post is very much appreciated. 👍
---
I'd move out now If I had the chance, personally, I live in West Virginia.
---
You have next to no job opportunity unless you lucked out by being born near or in one of the good cities in the state, I cant even get a min wage job without traveling 2 hours north, nothing south hiring unless I go chance and possibly die in the coal mines. We dropped off after WW2 as no one needed to make tons of steel and coal, the 2000's and up is when the world forgot about West Virginia.
---
The assault rifle would be closer to two hundred caps.  The Tesla might go for four or five hundred.  They’re two-stars with run-of-the-mill effects.
---
There’s so much good voice acting in this game.
---
Yes thank you, I tried to explain it so that anyone could understand it, even those who never heard of the movie :)
---
glad to help out and put that craftsmamship to good use 👍🏼
---
Know the feeling. You're not alone. Always a friendly ear here. This game and past fallout games have probably saved my life. Hoping it continues.
---
The pier to pier approach is just want it takes to make free invite only private play financially viable. Its always going to be the case that someone on the same server can hack you just because of how bad the game is on security going peer to peer just drops all pretence that you'll be safe if you don't proactively control who you play with like a borderlands game, but on the plus side when you are hacked it's easy to restore what is lost by editing your own save file on your end because it doesn't matter anymore if someone could edit in rare gear
---
Yeah figured it was death tick, still, Bethesda thought the corpses was the players complaining about the instanced container loot not being there.
---
The only difference I heard is how much XP is rewarded, two or more will get you a bit more XP. I prefer to turn them in one at a time to better my chances at one of the rare paint plans.
---
No problem! Have fun!
---
Today (Christmas) I went to vault 76 on 5 different servers and dropped off 5 power armor in each of the worlds with a full fusion core.
---
No attachments for them though, as that would require a higher level.
---
I just hope the right people got them / only took 1 each!
---
Okay then.
---
This is awesome thanks for the chance
---
The hack is PC only.
---
I just bought fo76 for PC on Sunday.  I've been playing it non stop and I've beenenjoying every moment so far.  I would love to win a copy so I can gift it to my friend.  He's never played any fallouts so he didn't want to buy it because of the huge negativity surrounding the game.  Thanks and happy holidays.
---
If you're on PC I'll make full kitted non-Legendary gear specifically for your chosen playstyle.  You don't really need the Legendary stuff when you're rapidly outgrowing it every couple of days.
---
Agreed!  Also wish floors would snap to foundations without need status connecting them.
---
I'm on ps4 but thank you for the info
---
Do you have a link?
---
Massive exploits where thousands of people on PC had their inventory deleted never to return, nothing to write home about.
---
This is a very well put tip post, thank you.
---
So sad to hear this, i'm scared about playing right now because 6 months ago, my account was hacked and my character deleted, i opened a ticket on bethesda customer services, and they only said change your password, scan your pc for malwares and check your email, i asked even on their twitter account to implement at least a 2-factor authentication, but seem they don't care. And now, i leveled another character again only cause i want to play with my friends, not because i like the game, for sure, and i felt so frustrated doing all main quests again. Considering their attention on security, why i sholud log in before this exploit is patched? Seems like Bethesda is more focused on creating hype for that useles NPC-Update than giving a good experience to all those people that are waiting since the launch for a decent game....
---
P.S. forgive my english, not my 1st language
---
whats the point when ill be standing within 200m to steal that gear again
---
The hack was exclusively available on PC, and has since been patched. It wasn't on consoles, nor will be.
---
According to a rumour on MMOG Fails, cross platform play was discussed for consoles, but PC is out of the question. Mainly because of all the hacking and exploiting happening on PC. 
---
The rumour also mentions that cross play isn’t a priority for Bethesda, and isn’t going to be implemented unless the community pushes for it.
---
Unfortunately you do not get any Nuclear Winter XP, nor Adventure XP/Caps, for disconnects (or for quitting) a match.
---
Thanks! I hope it’s not to wordy and the information is clear. I wrote it in pieces 😂.
---
I would totally agree with you if it wasn't December 2019. If they had to change their plans, it is because some asshole hackers have better knowledge of the game than its creators/developers. I work, I have a job. In fact, I am a teacher. If I take a break from marking papers and end up having 200 papers to mark for tomorrow, it's my fault, and I still have to mark them carefully, and I won't expect students to give me a break because I spent the last 20 hours marking non-stop. 
---
I repeat: we paid full price for a game which still feels unfinished, because of incidents like this one, which are THE RULE (two weeks ago, prefixes on armor stopped working when you reloaded the weapon, after a 'fix').
---
I love the game. I support the game. I play the game. It's their job to keep the game running decently.
---
Hour long bathroom breaks every 15 minutes. Hot mic the entire way through.
---
That's one of its effects and uses, but it also drastically reduces the mat cost of repairing armor. I tend to just use it for the latter so I can have other perks equipped when I'm out in battle.
---
But yeah, if you leave it on all the time it will be even more effective, since you have to repair less often and it's cheaper when you do
---
I just dumped a bunch of scrips at murmur and got many identical rolls (ghoul slayer with extra bashing to be exact). Several in a row. Hours and hours of grinding disappears into the scrip chipper as usual 👌
---
But if you don't leave it equipped when you're exploring and stuff your armor breaks down A LOT faster.
---
Interestingly, both of those statements can be true at the same time.
---
Feel better friendo
---
\*Steals all your times from 200 feet away.\*
---
I didn't play for 8 months.  So glad I missed this.
---
Well, this made me smile, thank you :) i hope you got some gifts from santatron amd are getting some good gifts, Merry Christmass!!!
---
Tried real hard and couldn’t come up with anything positive to say about this game. I don’t even want the copy I have 😂
---
Why thank you for the multiple credits! You were very thorough and I agree with everything you've said in this post! Well done!
---
Did ya check you're stash?
---
The hacker was able to do it because the devs were incompetent...
---
On XBOX, but thanks.
---
Yeah this happened months ago. They should all be in your stash. I don’t remember why they got separated but it was some fix.
---
Yes, I understand. But having such an option where you can cheat your lost items into the game quite easily after being robbed seems to defeat the point of maintaining that feeble in-game economy Bethesda is trying to hard to keep alive. Peer-to-peer system is really a lose-lose to them in such case. They wouldn't be able to effectively keep the server secure and free of hackers themselves, letting the community pick up the slack. On top of that, once user-friendly cheating tools kick in their ability to milk money out of player will also be severely diminished.
---
🙏🏻 Merry Christmas!
---
I would love another copy of the game, i've already got 3 (i play with my sons  [https://imgur.com/1hCejVu](https://imgur.com/1hCejVu)  ) but i'm juggling my spare parts pile to get something with enough grunt to manage Fo76, to get my wife in on the action too.  
---
Positive experience? I've discovered a \*very\* positive, friendly group of people to play with, and not just the "drop loot for the noob" stuff, i've run around nuked WS talking to people about their work day and car problem. I'm not able to leave the house without some assistance and this game has been my "go to the pub with the lads" outlet that i didn't know i needed. Would be nice to the missus for a drink with me ;)
---
Yup, no PA anything in there.
---
That is where you are wrong good sir. The vampire effect combined with the faster fire rate allowed for fast health regen and used with the auto barrel. With the chain it goes through multiple enmities for multiple hits for the vampires effect making it fairly hard to kill you. The faster fire rate allows for you to get even more in a shorter time. I may of been over with the AR but the Tesla I am spot on.
---
Oh oops lol

Dont hide in pacifist mode number 1 tip
---
Don't worry, there aren't too many morons in the game :)
---
This. Crossbow can fire incendiary or explosive projectiles pretty much since invention, where is my explosive crossbow bro 🤮
---
I killed a lv 12 after he meleed me for attention. He dropped a shit tonne of scrap, i didn't need it but i felt he needed to experience loss.
---
Its a nice lesson to learn early.
---
And to you as well!
---
Much love fellow Wastelander, hope you enjoy the day :)
---
 The pieces are just in your stash,  everyone had to put them back on.
---
Well.... that makes them better and less expensive than those 12k cap letters.  Woot!
---
This, and the game needs to do a much better job of telling you which armors are light and hvy.
---
Watched some lvl 22 die a half-dozen times trying to hang with our group of 200+ claiming the workshop at thunder mountain.. anglers are pretty tough, no matter what level you are. I rewarded his rinse-and-repeat lifestyle with a half-dozen serums, because I could tell he didn't have any. 
---
I also build fusion generators when I see a need, because why not?
---
Theyre not there, I tried joining a different server to refresh and still nothing.
---
😮 Me want!
---
I'm so so sorry. No just kidding. The game is fun despite the quirks - the gameplay falls a little flat and repetitive sooner than most online games but hopefully the coming expansion will help that.
---
I got one too today! Isn't it a cutie? :3
---
 Yikes.  Put a ticket in with Bethesda?
---
I could use an extra key for a friend, she recently got put on disability for a rare life threatening illness and had to move in with her parents because she couldn't afford her apartment, so we can't hang out IRL anymore.  
---
Anyway, my best experiences in 76 has been just hanging out with friends catching up on old times, and building silly camp stuff.
---
defeating the point is the point this game was never going to be able to hold an economy together and trying tell users otherwise does thier customers a disservice. If they don't give up on the money sack dream then at some point this promise of security will be broken enough times that non-hacking users will give up on beth instead, and its pretty much going to be the case because beth won't do the right thing. 
---
Peer to peer is about the only way this ends gracefully the alternatives being either an ungraceful and apprupt end of service, or a gradual death by attrition as people lose confidence that beth can handle the situation, and simply walk away.
---
Guy in my discord makes 2200 a month on selling fallout 76 shit it's insane
---
It's been long enough that I dont remember what I even had exactly, so it probably wouldn't be worth it. I feel like I'm missing some weapons too. Just frustrating.
---
whats ur IG name for PC? i can send u few things u could have or sell to make caps on
---
Early last month I stopped playing and uninstalled the game.  Nicest thing I've done for myself in a while.
---
Up until recent events I had a pretty good time with the game, my friends and I from high school got to merge together with Halo MCC coming out and I’d like to bridge the gap even more with Fallout 76.
---
Add me friend DELASIERNATF2
---
Game keeps getting better.
---
Now that's just cruel.
---
Merry Christmas fellow vault dweller
---
Belshnickel judges Todd’s year as...impish! *whack*
---
Can't argue with that. Although I do have to point out is that we wouldn't have come so far into this mess if Beth actually considered fitting the servers with file integrity verification. Omitting such a seemingly insignificant thing led to all this. Fine example of a butterfly effect, if you ask me.
---
May Santa Purveyor favor you.
---
By the sound of it your feelings are the one that's hurt, also you say the game is a shit storm yet here you are in the 76 sub, Merry Christmas bud 😉
---
Wow, you are the real Santa of Appalachia &lt;3
---
The armor should be in your stash and you should be spawned at a train station.
---
Some weird technical issue on their part.
---
I did spawn in at a train station, but it wasn't in the stash at my camp. Is it in the specific stash at that station? Seems oddly specific.
---
When this happened to me the missing items were in my personal inventory and not my stash box. I couldn't work out why I was always over encumbered. Took me ages to sort it all out.
---
Try going to Tyler county fair grounds, point pleasant, camden park, Beckly rooftops lower level holiday scorched are around there. Id prioritize the fair grounds first since you can do the frequent event leader of the pack as well. That event leads you to 3 legendary mongols. 
---
Even just server hoping the fair grouds would be pretty profitable.
---
Me too. Now I'm just an NPC who sells plans at wholesale to noobs.
---
Cruel world....
---
PC: crisley
---
I only had the ultracite pieces in my inventory. Then I put both sets on empty chassis, and lost all the limbs off one of the two sets. This is great.
---
How has it improved other than the hiccup I was talking about.
---
Don’t get the game on PC until they release an anti-cheat, it doesn’t matter how much you get it for or why you get it. There’s been constant hacking in the game and Bethesda support doesn’t respond to player reports. Fallout 1st is basically essential to gameplay which means you’re buying the game for $30 or whatever and on top of that $12.99 every month, however they have their conversions wrong so if you don’t live in the US it can be way more expense. The content is small to non-existent and the community sucks incredibly bad, because they all silently farm and complain about griefers.
---
I thought that too, but someone explained to me that your armor pieces are still in your inventory and the chassis were removed from the pieces, for anti cheat reasons, and all you have to do is sort through your stash and inventory to assemble them all again.
---
I occasionally get an audio glitch like that, I’ll hear a white noise or ticking after passing a loading screen - for whatever reason, aiming through the scope of my rifle makes it stop.
---
Yes. 
---
Join us.
---
The “holiday” scorched will drop legendary loot.  The ones at Tyler County Fairgrounds in the northwest part of the map will usually drop Level 1 or 5 items.  The holiday scorched at Morgantown Airport usually drop Level 5 items.  Also, the Leader of the Pack event that spawns in the northwest part of the map will have a boss with a Level 1 or 5 item.  Of course, you don’t know what you’ll get, but it’s still a start.
---
Is there a particular weapon you’re looking for?
---
The threshold for getting loot from the Queen is 1,500, not "at least 10K."  You can turn on damage numbers in the display settings to see how much you're doing.
---
I've also heard people mention that Strangler Blooms for RadShield are not only tied to that quest, but "verdant season" in the Mire.  So if you ever need to make more of it, pay attention to where verdant seasons happen.
---
Good advice. I'll give it a shot.
---
Or they could be boycotted by the fanbase and forced to remove this paywall to features they said would be available for free.
---
Merry Christmas! May Appalachia treat you well
---
No and no.
---
Stop spreading this inaccurate explanation.
---
What. It's not about loyalty I just really hated  the idea of do 1st, I sunk 100 hours into this game and for them to just make a system that let people win by paying. It just made me sad they'd ever even do that. :(
---
I got a vampire pickaxe, exactly same as my vampire wrench that saved my @$$ dozens of times, but much higher damage. Gonna put that wrench on the wall of fame.  Then gonna go beat on some mutants. Very glad I checked this out.
---
Well, we've barely even met but I gotta admit it was insightful to have an exchange of words with you, stranger. I hope you have a great day.
---
Haven’t played OW but I love FO76 and play that every day
---
Are you being sarcastic?
---
The Queen has never ever scaled.  The number of adds that spawn when she takes off slightly changes depending on the number of players but her health is unaffected nor is her DR.
---
The Queen does not scale. Her health is always static. She just auto avoids 70% of all incoming damage
---
Thank you. I'm much better now than I was at the beginning of the year. Had to force myself to get help, but I'm glad I did. Merry Christmas. Or Happy Holidays or which ever you prefer.
---
You should have collected plants to have as crops at your camp by now
---
Return to your base camp.  Plant crops, harvest and make soup.
---
Check shelves and containers for canned goods, they don't spoil.
---
 Excellent and informative write-up!  Thank you!
---
Her total HP is weird though.
---
If she actually had 32,000 HP, then I should be putting her down in just over 5 hits if the floating damage numbers are what they say they are.  In practice?  Doesn't happen.  Doesn't even come close to happening.  I think even players who have totally min-maxed their builds have found that the best you can do is a two-hit kill, because the game is capping the damage.
---
I feel like, if anything, my weapons bust faster then my armor. But that's with the perks enabled to keep them both conditioned.
---
RNGsus
---
Earlier today the same guy dropped a nuke 3 times all not touching the fissure site but like and inch away and I don’t know how to feel
---
I think it looks good. I've always had better luck with four leaf clover than grim reaper's sprint. And unless you're running a bloodied build I'd probably replace serendipity with better criticals but that's probably more personal preference.
---
My character survives solely on razorgrain soup and chems
---
Met a new player on reddit.
---
Supported and gave health items and ammo.
---
Gave some extra rare event items.
---
Other than that, I drop bag so stimpacks and chems for low levels every no and then.
---
It’s RNG, other than 3 stars it’s fully random.
---
At some point, when you don't know what else to pick, try taking the Good Doggy perk.  It makes Canned Dog Food a lot more filling, and it's not very hard to find and stockpile it.
---
There’s a luck perk called “Can Do!” that lets you find extra food when searching containers.  I rocked that bad girl till level 60 and never had food shortages.
---
Use the build menu to 'build crops, mate. I can't remember what section as I haven't played for a long while
---
But also make sure you have a water source and you can always make soups like corn etc. Making your hunger and thirst a thing of the past. There are superior foods but for basic survival these are good.
---
Yep it's a bloodied build. Thought the nerd rage would give it away. I'm going to have to play around with both. Theres a lot of luck perks that I'd need to test to gauge its usefulness.
---
I’ve been moving my CAMP  semi frequently as I traverse over the map. Is that not what I should be doing?  Should I dig in somewhere and expand that no matter how far I explore?
---
Also is there a way when I move CAMP that it remembers my layout? So far every time I move I have to set all my benches again.
---
I had an idea before about the perk card system that for every card you have the 3 ranks let’s say you unlock all 3 ranks but then you want to switch the card to 1 in normal you gotta level up and pick the card again but what if each rank you unlocked you could switch so if you unlocked 4/5 for a card you can switch between 1 2 3 and 4 levels of each perk card
---
Or ask someone to give u Carnivore mutation so u can eat everything
---
Yeah I guess I should have assumed that.
---
I agree. These people who are like die hard FO76 fans will disagree but realistically, the quests are repetitive and it gets old FAST. Definitely think the new Vegas and FO4 types of fallout are far more superior so Wastelanders will help for sure!
---
Damn. I’m coming from WoW where food was just a health increase thing. This hunger, thirst mechanic is crazy. 
---
I have a water pump but it only gives me dirty water which I go to the bench to make it boiled water which I’ve been drinking.
---
Steel be with you sister!
---
Buy a Carnivore Serum off a vendor. It doubles the benefits from eating meat.
---
Yeah you can Use a campfire as Well to sort your water out when you cook.
---
Hunger and thirst is a survival mechanic as this is supposed to be a survival game, foods etc do give buffs tho from memory? 
---
Also iirc there are builds centred around food too,
---
I would imagine it's because they are eventually destined for the atom shop
---
No negatives? (It's been a while)
---
Either one is fine by me ;)
---
Welcome to the mad house hope to see you in game.. turn passafist off for a fuller experience.
---
But you know this in guessing you played on console
---
 "While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected, we are taking this very seriously and resolving this is currently our top priority. "  
---
this respond was clear in advance of it. it was clear as day that they going to tell this lie. this is just downplaying huge problem. second, there was a post, 1 year ago where user noticed and warned Bethesda about their game security and they did absolutely nothing.
---
I scrapped one the other day and unlocked compensator or muzzle brake (can't remember which).
---
Happy Hunting
---
No benefit from vegetable foods is the negative, except they still increase your food (i.e. no HP boost, AP Boost, Etc..)
---
 he is right it is fantastic
---
No.
---
Merry Christmas! And welcome to the Wasteland!
---
It is so far from being ptw.
---
This one is easy; private worlds with mods. This would allow for almost all of the requests I have seen so far, plus more. I think it would require a new or separate character, as it could have issues with porting back and forth between public servers (and potentially OP or game braking consequences).
---
Yes it has been the atoms alone make it worth it
---
That's actually a fair point.
---
You're welcome to join my wife and I on pc. IGN TK84 and Sportsbabe1300.
---
Yup.  And the news media, in the U.S., is protected by law so that they don't have to: Report the news, investigate the facts, or be unbiased.  They can straight up make news out of thin air and use rumors as facts.
---
Fox isn't the only one.  Every major news organization has been doing this.  Who's gonna tell them they can't?
---
That would make sense if the rest of their content didn't lead to the same conclusion. In their latest video, they said people whose atom shop skins were taken lost their money and have no way of getting them back, when the vast majority of atom shop items are infinitely craftable in your tent or at a workbench. With the 250dr bug, they said that your armor literally broke (as in the armor condition decreased) every time you reloaded, when in reality the legendary effects were what was broken. 
---
Besides, even if that wasn't the case, the argument is bs anyway. If you're going to make it your job to report on things, you need to do your research and tell people what the actual state of things is. Not doing your job because it takes too much effort is just ridiculous
---
Indirectly you taunt the 1st subscribers. And maybe you didn’t mean it like that. Know that i stand up for all our loyal players. Without them this sub (and probably the game) would be dead. 
---
1st is a choice. You can very well play the game without it. I spend almost 900 hours without it and still have a blast.
---
Minor nitpick: IIRC you still get buffs from veggies but they don’t satisfy hunger. (And vice versa for herbivore and meats.)
---
I dont know about the puppets. But what i do know is that the fanboyism for this game reaches psychedelic levels.
---
Do you know what is NOT the best motirbike you can buy? The 2006 Aprilia Tuono.
---
It’s dated, the reliability is questionable, it’s poorly equipped by mosern standards... do you know what bike i bought? Yep. You guessed it.
---
You can love something flawed. And completely accept and acknowledge those flaws. I dont pretend my bike is flawless or perfect. I dont pretend that detractors are somehow hyper-bias contrarians who only dismiss my opinion because of some weird, vapid reasoning I CANT EVEN DEFINE! 
---
You can love something flawed. But for fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck just sake be REALISTIC ABOUT IT! 
---
You lose nothing by accepting the flaws. You gain nothing by pretending things are better than they are.
---
Try it. Just say “this is fucked, but i love it”.
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
No really it doesn’t seem like your idea was smart. There shouldn’t people that are needing to check if players will help or not. The point of helping and giving gifts is the kindness not checking to see if they’d do the “right thing”. But, you are making light of it, by not speaking up and seeking help from Bethesda to fix the game you love to play.
---
I shall assume “status”=“stairs”
---
There’s nothing wrong with moving your camp a lot, especially at first while you’re learning the map. That way you’ll find spots that suit your play style, RP (if any) etc. 
---
When you move camp, your benches and other build items should be under the STORED tab in your build menu. The things that are built on the same foundation will be grouped as a single structure but this can be buggy IME. 
---
Have fun with the game and welcome to Appalachia!
---
It's okay to let your guard down sometimes, lone wanderer. Merry festivus, here's a Nuke Cherry and a Funnel Cake... because Funnel Cakes rule!

There's like 9 brahmin hanging around Flatwoods.

Making ribeyes also increases your carrying capacity.
---
If we’re family guess I gotta send you a Christmas sweater card
---
We kept running into a lot of noob tubers yesterday, so I switched to my demo build character I created for anti-noob tube combat. The kills were so easy to get that I just got disgusted and switched back to my regular build.
---
This game is awesome. I hope you enjoy. If you ever feel down about it, come back to this thread and add me IGN: TheMasterDev
---
Ezcellent guide for not only the new, but also the uncertain.
---
Yesssss 😂😂😂
---
The red glowing sites in the Ash Heap are stunning at night .... lots of opportunity there.
---
If you liked toxic valley, you clearly have a creative view of the aesthetic of scarred and burned earth.
---
Okay, thanks
---
They definitely can have enough. Bethesda introduced a hard cap for carry weight a while ago, I think 1500 above your max carry weight and you can only destroy things. People who are already going out of their way to cheat would never waste that space on random 1* garbage stolen from players. They can just dupe the 3* god rolls they already have and resell those
---
Aligned mods to reduce vats cost, reflex sight and quick reload double drum. Also bypod to increase fire by 20% while deployed
---
Yes! That’s what I was making. Forgot that area. I loved the steaks for that very reason and is what made me realize I was out of food to begin with
---
Go Canibal...
---
It's been over a year, it's time to admit to ourselves that this game will never be even close to what was promised. Time to move on.
---
My little sister got the game a few months back, and when she realized there were different teddy bears in the game, she decided that we had to get all of them for her camp. We spent the next couple days exploring the map in search of the bears until we got them all, it was super fun.
---
I've got a full set of Vanguard BOS and play about 10+ hours a day and was having to repair all my armour at least once a day since they fixed the durability bug.
---
My level 2 is there, no base or anything though. Just used to hold items &amp; caps. Only scripping on that character looking for wwr armor
---
Hey, you said scrip was the only valuable thing in game, I just said you can always have more scrip, but no more stash space.
---
I got a toad, Excavator w/ MG, and Nate from Fallout 4
---
So much this. I can't tell you how many timea, u had that spot were you went like: Im gonna put a stair here, and turns out you cant. Speaking of which, were the hell are the elevators from F04.
---
Naughtier than the cat that knocked my mug down
---
But we can float a whole structure in the air, in some cases with lack of any support at all.
---
Yeah, this bugs me.  CAMP building is fun.  Could be better and more fun.
---
Except vegetables and fruit. Not well known but snipers benefit from the Herbivore mutation as there are some special food you can cook up that give great boosts. Carnivores can’t use Sunshine Oil +400AP for example.
---
All players present help, more players doesn't make her stronger.
---
I’ve still yet to get aqua boy lol. I’ll be trying when I do though.
---
Step into a workshop and see if you still have the same opinion.
---
Did you really just come on here to say bethesda bad.
---
You have plenty of time to get the Winter Outfit. Event goes on until Jan. 6th
---
Don't forget to hang around and pick up all the loot from smaller foes.   You will be too busy during the fight.
---
I play it heavy gunner vats without stabilized / PA. Got B2525 version unyielding with +1agi 95% vats hit chance and its semi supressed. You can clean westtek without being spotted while rushing it in crouch mode. 2k + headshots with best fire rate in the game i got it primed. 10k gold + lucky hole mine yields around 10 k ultracite .308 ammo that i can play for 2days without problem. Since i finish runs like westtek with few remaining rounds in magazine without reloading, this weapon is one of easiest to feed in the game only losing to 50cal mg.
---
fixing for commenter, you dont need to worry about hacks on xbox in general.  there is an obscene amount of modification needed to make the games "hackable" and most of the modification would be picked up by microsoft and result in them "banning" the modified console so it couldnt be used.
---
Except it was rewritten from scratch like 4 times already adopting it for new, constantly evolving, concepts and technologies.   
---
His comment totally makes sense, he is being booed so unreasonably.
---
Would be great if traded/ given gifts were more likely high value.
---
Welcome to Appalachia. Don't listen to the haters and enjoy.
---
They never did that
---
I am of the belief that if you don’t bring the ball over the goal line you don’t get credit. I don’t believe in rewarding effort if you can’t finish the deed. That’s my opinion. I know what you are saying, I just disagree in these types of games.
---
I think you are right. I read around that it was 10k but it never made a lot of sense to me because some of my characters in no way can do that. Let me edit it. Ai didn’t know about verdant seasons. I do know that when heart of the swamp pops you have a good chance to grab the blooms but have even seen them bloom when it’s not. I think it has to do with nighttime more then events themselves but this is an assumption. Thanks for the input I will fix my post!
---
Praise be.
---
Huh that’s an interesting thought,  I hadn’t even thought about her being made to replace someone. I just assumed she was some weird brain or mind transfer experiment... your theory makes way more sense
---
I sometimes drop the nuke close to prime but not over it. To be safe land your nuke to the outside ring of the map marker.
---
No problem! Merry Christmas!
---
Yeah but the guy completely missed it
---
Thanks :).
---
I play on the ps4. I dont know if they cross platforms or not. But thank you!
---
This should be something to test then. The farther away from where you want to fight the less chance players have to spawn in the nuke zone. This will be worth the time to figure out for sure!
---
💝✊ you are a great brother! Thank you for remembering me.
---
Lol I wanna steal people inventory and make them naked.
---
The boost was removed a long time ago
---
They'll be $20 for 6 hours and never seen again.
---
Always there for fellow players, you are not alone...
---
Odd, I always see the same issues both on my old build with a decently fast SSD (Samsung Evo 850) and now a delightfully quick nvme (WD black). Upwards of 30s to see my camp at least.
---
The sad thing is, I can totally see Beth doing this.
---
Good or bad, I am glad everyone here is able to still bond and be a family.  This game gave me hope when I needed it, the whole series kind of saved me and I still have to respect that. 
---
I hope you all continue to find people who accept you and let you grow. I'm not sorry to be part of the community because it's all of us together that save each other. Never be afraid to reach out for new friends!
---
Remember where you saw them animals? That was Flatwoods, so go back and kill some animals clever boi.

I totally agree with this. Hit marker numbers and her respective health are hard to gauge. I am not sure why but I have an assumption it has something to do with her damage resistance. Also the damage you deal while she mutates and regenerates her first half of health will negate until she is finished healing so if you use ammo I would wait until she finishes healing until you continue to shoot to save ammo. I have also noticed that within the first few seconds of taking certain chems I will see her health bar take more damage but the damage numbers do not show a difference until maybe 5 or so seconds after. There is still a lot that doesn’t make sense to me.

You can eat flowers, make tea, etc.

The White knight perk reduces drastically how fast your armor degrades. So try eguiping that and you will see a huge difference.
---
They can save time if they do the videos for free, which they don't, so that argument is utterly worthless.
---
Vending machines hack rumors is just a sad attempt to show that not a lot of players are playing because they unplugged their vending machine.

Please stop spreading rumors that could hurt this game.

Gonna get it today!!

Have a nice Christmas in Appalachia

(Or with family)

All of you are riding all these awesome things! I've just been riding around on Santa bot shoulders!
---
Yes, stupid auto correct!
---
how scorc
---
Do the collision course event. Between the two, you will pick up a number of weapons between L1 and 15.
---
And some legendary as well
---
Oh nice that excavator looks awesome.
---
All my characters survive on Meat and alcohol, True hillbily!
---
I don't understand how you can play a game for that long, especially one with such little content. Baffling.
---
This game introduced me to European twin!
---
Not a real twin, but we were born on the exact same day, month, and year!! It's so interesting that if this game didn't exist I wouldn't know some of these awesome people that I talk to just as much as I do friends that I know in meat space.
---
Did you actually went into a silo without the code?
---
I heard if you buy something, the sign moves to the side, like "open sesame"
---
Expected to find it on google as always
---
I hope you have a wonderful Christmas, everyone deserves to have a great one 🙂

I thought it went until the 31st! I have a 7 day hitch at work starting on the 26th, so I was rushing to get it done today.

Not in english but the numbers should be right.

Great idea.

Thank you sir, appreciated

Who are you, Yong Yea?

💝✊ ad victoriam brother
---
In 2019 a AAA studio still doesn't know that everything (not cosmetic) must be server side validated in a multi player game ...
---
💝✊ i got your back too
---
That's not the point, some people don't have the santatron collecting gifts. And yet these turds still pick the locks anyway.
---
YES please! I love this idea!
---
By damage cap, I’m assuming you’re referring to pvp?
---
If you need boiled water for soup you can always collect from a nearby body of water and cook 2 of those dirty waters into boiled. The down side is you catch a little radiation for that. Totally worth it if you are starving though. :/
---
Just plant melons at your camp and stock up.  They’re food and water.
---
Runescape also did this. Was a great addition. Only downside was that anything acquired beforehand was not logged, so everyone was scrambling to re-complete their log books.
---
You have no clue what you're talking about.  A well picked Pipe build can do easily 1100 to 1500 or more without chem or food buffs.  Add in FDC buffs and you can get in excess of 2500 damage.
---
. r/PKOA  💝
---
\&gt; get a better cheat detection ... Patch and ban. asap
---
Don't give Bethesda any ideas. Anything Bethesda implements to combat this is likely to come back to bite legitimate game players in noticeable ways despite the hackers. Bethesda is more than willing to slam down hackers at the expense of its very own FO76 game players. It used this tactic in the past to stop duping and mule accounts. Yes, Bethesda does need to fix this hacker problem. It doesn't need to cause legitimate players even more grief in the process.
---
I can't tell Bethesda how to fix this specific problem. I can only say that whatever means they use to combat these hackers should ONLY be targeted at those hackers alone. Bethesda shouldn't further reduce our carry weights, further reduce CAMP budgets, further "balance the game", further muck with the quest system, further break working features or pull any other shenanigans that prevent players from actually, you know, play the game we paid for. They've already done enough of these changes in the guise of "balancing". Fallout 76 doesn't need any more of this unnecessary retaliatory nonsense to further hobble this game.
---
Bethesda likely uses the same base code for all platforms and, thus, this means whatever fix that Bethesda uses to combat this on the PC will very likely impact consoles. Yeah, I'm not anxious to see what this upcoming "patch" turns the game into this time.
---
This is the first Funco Pop I’ve ever seen that I want.
---
I was pumped up for the fausnaught parade update. I built a nice base by the parade hours before the update came live. When the event started people all hung out at my base.
---
 The event was really cool because we all got masks and some camp decorations. But the best part was this event brought the community together. For the first time groups of people, (at least 12) all did an event together.
---
 The best part was that at the end of the parade I yelled in the mic “lets all line up for a picture next to the effigy, or the burning tree”. And we did. I still have a picture of a group of like 12 people all wearing there masks, happy we completed this event together. Then we would run back to my nice camp close by and decorate it with balloons and other fun stuff. Pc code or xbox code is fine.
---
Pick cranberries where you can, most of the things they craft into boosts XP.
---
Note the daily challenges to get free atoms.  Occasionally there's a freebie in the atom shop, those can be fun.
---
Missiles and Mininukes are super heavy.  Unless you're using em, ditch em.
---
The game is designed for things to all be used, but it's hard to shake the hoarding mentality of fallout 4.
---
Turn legendaries you won't use in for scrip, or sell them to other players, you'll always get more than the robot vendors will pay you.
---
When you start doing big trades, look into the couriers either here (I'm sorry, I'm not more familiar with the Reddit couriers or I'd link them,) or on Facebook.  The Facebook couriers for Xbox are Couriers R Us and The Couriers.  Both are solid, and give you a trusted middleman so no one gets ripped off.
---
Start thinking about how you want to play.  I built for shotguns, and now run commando.  Going from stealth sniper to heavy gunner is a big jump.
---
There's lot of resources out there, feel free to ask questions.
---
See you in the wasteland.

Constant lag problems and disconnects on Xbox for me.
---
Yeah, so if they made additions retroactive, that would be awesome.
---
I've heard this story already, from the source (a mutual friend of ours). Everyone kept telling me that there was a video of a particular well-known player who was shooting through a wall. I asked who had this video, and they told me. I talked to her when she joined the party, and she told me that no such video existed. She then asked the others in the party to stop spreading the RUMOR that she had a video of someone shooting through the wall. That's why I always ask for proof. Xbox makes it super easy to capture videos of cheating, so there should NEVER be a case of cheating on Xbox without a video.
---
There are plenty of times when it SEEMS like someone is cheating. It usually boils down to a player who doesn't understand something. A lot of people claim that they were shot through a wall or they saw a player using a teleportation hack. Is this cheating? No, it's lag. How about when loot crates and world objects (tables, vehicles, etc) simply don't appear. Is that caused by an evil warlock? No, the game assets didn't load in properly for you. Other people will be able to see those things.
---
The other cheat you mentioned, where people know where you are somehow. That's also not a cheat. We can HEAR you. We can SEE you. And only one person on the team needs to be able to reveal enemies. All it takes is a single person running the Hacker perk. Invest in a good pair of headphones. You'll be able to hear everything, including the sound of footsteps from someone who is slowly rotating in place.
---
Everyone figured out there was no winning and are now subscribers. 
---
All it did for me is clear up enough stash room to add a 4th vendor.  Minor advantage. Very minor, almost just a quality of life improvement.
---
Happy holidays. We have a civilization to rebuild and are counting on you. Enjoy your holidays.
---
Choo-Choo!
---
Thanks for being on the elf train!
---
Truly!!
---
What system are you on? If I can I will drop any I may have. I am not certain what I have cause I haven't looked.
---
Well the drop rate is not that high either
---
Might be people waiting until the event to charge prices, as they know everyone is getting them now. I've seen some here and there on PS4 though.
---
Really? My mistake, I thought they said the equivalent of that on the BGS forums but I didn't see it myself.
---
Merry Christmas....
---
PC .. This happened twice this morning. I got past sign in though. Was loading in the game. Crashed to desktop. Tried again cause I had time before we had to run to my mother in laws this morning ... same thing. Didn't try again.
---
Yeah
---
Well they did remove some duped items.
---
Correct, well said.
---
Hey! Merry Christmas to you!
---
Your stomachs gonna feel better if you stop watching YouTube and stop believing their pay to win spiels.
---
Yeah, calling them "giant" implies they're something more, but when other non-giant letters are the same size... eh. It does kind of build up some expectations from the name alone.
---
How many of us have items in our CAMP that we CAN NOT move. I have somewhere around 20 between my 4 characters CAMPs. We're talking posters and other objects placed too close to high foundation blocks that are ungrab-able. Talking plants and floors that snapped into the ground too low and are unreachable. Talking items placed on in game structures placing in the ceiling or walls, unreachable. Thee only option is to move thee entire CAMP? Fuck outta here. Give us a list of what IS placed so I can delete from there, pretty please.
---
I've had it happen a couple of times on ps4, but I'm also at my mom's house where the internet is crap, so not sure if it's the game or her internet.
---
Gotta love those unpatched *known* bugs from previous games huh
---
This is pretty blatant misinformation. 
---
You can do better! I believe in you.
---
They HEAVILY nerfed several EXP farming methods shortly launch, and nerfed the ability to gain levels after like level 200 iirc. There was a glowing ones method and the vertibird method, from memory but they just nerfed leveling overall because it was getting out of hand.
---
No starched genes?
---
I have a small store by the whitespring station and she is gunning to get every single location atm.  We're on now.
---
Merry Christmas. These wastelands can be awfully lonely, but hang in there long enough and you’re bound to meet that other lone wanderer that makes it all worth while
---
I went to go play titanfall right after and it didnt seem too bad. So im not honestly sure whats going on.
---
Never forget the devs thought this was a good idea.
---
Never looked @ santa this way.
---
I've never seen a cringier post in this sub.
---
If anyone is attacking "you" or the community, its bethesda sabotaging themselves.
---
&gt;The devs deserve a huge shout out and thank you. 
---
Big lol. They patched the inventory steal, ok. What about the rest thats been going on for a year now?
---
The fact that they only payed attention to it once the world was on fire is a testament to their lack of care.
---
The hacking didn't help, but Private Servers were already pretty common from the start of this event, simply because they are very conducive to farming.  Not only do you have all the Scorched areas to yourself or your team, but you can literally take every Workshop on the map and a Santatron churning out gifts at each one.
---
The mode isn't about how many people you kill, it's about being the last person alive.
---
When I get close to max cap, I travel to the forest and visit all the low level venders and buy them out.
---
Welcome! Fo76 has a great community so feel free to ask any questions. Merry Christmas🎄
---
Heard there is some 1k+ lvl players out there
---
The game has been out over a year. That’s some serious dedication (or glitch xp farming ;)
---
Grenades do penetrate walls, glitch or no glitch. Bullets get stopped by most walls. It's best to not stay in one place for too long.
---
This is limited to Fallout 1st players only. Even so, it's much better to be able to buy gift wrappers on public servers than private ones, because you need caps. And caps we get fast selling items on machines or transactions.
---
On public servants I was able to accumulate enough caps to buy 50 gift wrap in two days by selling plans, legendary items and stuff. I made 100 great handcrafted gifts and got several rare plans. After the attacks I was only able to buy 8 gift wrap on the private server. I only play solo always.
---
Handmade gifts are better than conventional gifts. Have no doubt.
---
Xbox?
---
Yes, the exploit was patched on Monday.  It should be safe now.
---
Yes. my intention isn't to stur up drama though honest question.
---
Kinda. People can still put shit in your inventory
---
There's two mainly efficient ways for handling hunger &amp; thirst in game:
---
* 1) Agriculture.  Plant crops, and get your water from either purifiers or pumps/boiling.  Melons are excellent bang-for-buck crops in this way.
---
* 2) Good Doggy+Can Do perks for food, and Dromedary+Lead Belly for water.  If you're comfortable with two-legged doe and long pork, Cannibal can substitute for the canned dog food.  I think I ran Cannibal for a good long stretch of leveling, and it was excellent because for those level ranges, all I encountered were Supermutants and Scorched.  Yum...  I think I'm feeling peckish, excuse me while I grab a snack!
---
I've got a heap of plans from the event from PA to mounted heads but I'm sitting on them til after the event incase I need them to trade for other plans and only then will they go out in my vendors for sale.
---
IKR you can in nuclear winter but not in adventure mode it’s annoying
---
Scrap before you store, scrap weapons to learn plans, do events for xp, sleep and play instruments for bonuses, and make sure you perk into luck for can do and pharma farma.
---
Sorry - I should have said - I'm on PC.
---
That should be a issue. Thanks
---
Yep, it's fine.
---
Very good ill give it a go
---
This has become my FAVORITE weapon since shotguns stopped working a couple weeks ago. 
---
But I have NEVER seen a plan for them, or mods for the LMG anywhere. Robot vendors. Player vendors. Legendary drops. Nothing. 
---
(I’m on Xbox.)
---
That makes sense. I'll have to gather up my caps then :)
---
how do you turn damage numbers
---
You can sort of do this if you have valid stairs somewhere else, and then have another flight of stairs that goes down from that upper floor, but otherwise, no.
---
So much this.
---
Here’s a good course of action for Bethesda:
---
1. **Shut own all the pc servers until this exploit is patched.** You should have done this the minute you caught wind of it. You knew how bad this was going to get. This is something any sensible company that cares about their customers would do.
---
2. **Take action on the creators of the exploit and anyone who uses it.** These people should be seen as massive threats to your game, and you cannot ignore them. Ban them from the game. Take legal action if you must. There is no excuse for you to let them get off scot-free.
---
3. **Roll the accounts of anyone affected back to before the exploit was released.** If you can’t choose who gets rolled back, roll back everyone. Players would much rather be set back a few days than an entire year. If you can’t roll the game back at all, I couldn’t say I’m surprised.
---
4. **Offer massive discounts in the atom shop if you can’t roll the game back.** No, 500 atoms for each player is not enough to repair the damages even marginally. A lot of people lost a lot of money because of this, the least you could do is let those players buy all their stuff back for a reasonable price. Or better yet, refund the money they spent on the items they lost.
---
This isn’t just another cheat in your bug of a game, Bethesda. This is criminal. An exploit like this is unheard of, in any other game. If you want your company name to have any value in the future, stop downplaying the problem and show that you actually care about your customers, because you have already lost a lot of them.
---
They’re free with the subscription.
---
Weren’t they put in the shop for extra cost?
---
At this time, the basic Ranger and Advanced Ranger outfits are available.  I'm looking forward to seeing if there's an arctic/winter variant soon.
---
Aren’t there two additional styles? A green coat and the armored one?
---
I bought my T51B left leg plans from a vendor the other day.
---
I haven't even opened my presents yet, LOL
---
Wow way to downplay a thing that has affected MANY MANY PEOPLE. Good work Bethesda you made the community mad again
---
Probably won’t be on today but you can add TheLastMasiah  and SpiderPandaXXL, me and my fiancee are always looking for new friends and play daily. Level 266 and 218 on our mains.
---
The basic is the darker green coat with no shoulder pauldrons, while the advanced one is the Olive Drab Green with shoulder pauldrons and mantle.
---
Welcome aboard bro! Definitely keep an eye out for your gamertag. If i see you, i got some plans with your name on them
---
Yeah I've noticed armor and weapons breaking stupid fast along with hunger meter and thirst meter depleting fast too, I guarantee they fucked it up somehow... Or maybe to sell repair kits, who knows
---
Its our fault for getting hacked, i should have stopped playing this ages ago
---
Nope.  They are claimed through the shop once you get a First subscription.
---
Wait, I’m confused. Let’s restart. I’m going to call the standard one default, the heavily armored one heavy, and the green one green.
---
So, are you saying they are all free now?
---
I'll only switch it in when I'm applying my mutations. I won't need it afterwards because I won't be using Radaway since it's a bloodied build.
---
Yep
---
For a while, I remember people were mad cause they cost extra.
---
Looks cool! I like very ugly combos like the fasnacht giant mask with the tattered mole outfit
---
Pfft I use them and break em all the time. I'm always picking at something : ) So damned surprised whenever I watch players run past locked shit. I gotta open that. I gotta know wtf is in there!! Over a year playing, never selling them and always picking them up, and I haven't even broken 1k.
---
dang it
---
Sadly, no.
---
Yes they are.
---
I would love to see some more mods for heavy guns, superior hip fire mods would be insane or stabilized stocks for the lmg
---
Google Nukacrypt. They usually have the codes within a few hours each week.
---
" Nuke placement is important. Leave Forward station Delta out of the nuke zone "
---
This is one of three options that work out well.  Leaving Drop Site V9 out is by far from my experience the most popular option.  Or move the zone up a little and to the right so its barely outside of  Flooded Trainyard which  puts the fighting area just East of Overgrown Sundew Grove.  I'm seeing this done more and more and is a lot of fun.  I should add that doing this one includes a lot more areas of trees East of Flooded Trainyard that are good for collecting high counts of raw violet flux aka Flash Fern.
---
It was a listing error and lasted for about 8 hours. It was fixed and anyone that had spent that Atoms on the alternate skin was refunded.
---
Welcome to the party.
---
It is. youre right. but still. sadly its a  very legitim question, the problem is there is no answer for that. All we have is "it shouldnt be a problem anymore". So i SHOULD put my inventory to the line and risk everything what i have to lose?
---
I run a bloodied/unyielding commando build on my primary, and I can’t tell you how often I use diluted radaway when I’m near fissure sites or anything radioactive, or get hit by too many ghouls. You may end up deciding to keep it on for that reason 👍. (Also you may accidentally walk through a radshower)
---
How many unused perk points do you have?
---
There are only two versions. Default and green.
---
Zealot and Prime stack additively but the worth depends on the gun and what you plan to slaughter with it.
---
In my case, I have several primed weapons.
---
1. Furious Primed 50 Cal +10 aim is great against the SBQ in terms of DPS. With many optimized build around, you want to quickly dump 1500 damage into her. Takes 5 bullets on average for humanoid scorched so I don't recommend it for use on other than SB/SBQ or big bad scorched animals.
---
2. Zealot's Prime Gatling Gun that has 30+35=65% damage boost against scorched, but a) is really slow (FFR recommended), b) kills humanoind scorched in 2 shots on average where the 2nd shot wastes half or more damage. It is great to finish up the SBQ economically though.
---
3. Furious Primed +10 aim Gatling gun has 1.35 \* 1.45 \* 1.1 = +112% bonus damage after the 9th shot so it is exceptionally economic vs SBQ. However, like the previous gun, it takes 2-3 shots to humanoid scorched.
---
In general, I don't recommend priming against humanoid scorched and instead, use Anti-Armor or Zealot's unprimed.
---
How is that a bad thing tho?
---
And then it was granted for free?
---
Lever action semi. Fixer or handmade full auto
---
I'm on ps4, but I'm sure the people in PC are just as cool as everyone I've met since the start of the game. The Fallout community is like no other!
---
Well in that case I would just swap it in as a situational. I appreciate the feedback though. Any other advice for me?
---
They could troll you by making you overweight, or put items in your inventory that beth might ban over.
---
There is also a heavily armored one
---
Also, get your tag in early.  If the right high levels show up the SBQ can be taken down pretty quickly.  I run commando these days and pretty much focus on crowd control but always make sure I get my tag in first and even then while doing crowd control, will empty additional clips in her.
---
hackers can get creative
---
Excellent points to take into account, thanks for the input.
---
Watoga Transit Station vending machine.
---
All games give people a reason and means to do it, though.
---
You go to the map, options, display.
---
But you’re playing Overwatch right now...
---
bethesdas a moron for this even being possible the fault lies with them, but just because you can do something doesnt mean you should. i dont get off on ruining other peoples day and if its about getting people to stop supporting bethesda nobody has the right to dictate what other people enjoy
---
Yes it was/is free.
---
Exiting power armor shows I don't have a head.
---
Camera will not stay favorited.
---
Pip Boy locks up if opened too soon after spawning in or fast travelling.
---
Bodies sink into the ground and can't be looted.
---
in the sense that it's never actually been safe since the game launched, and now 3rd party tool cheats will only become more frequent, but yes enjoy the time you have before you get blindsided by the next hack instead of pushing for the final solution to the problem.
---
It's a different Garvey the one from 4 looks completely different, but good for you, would love to hear about your new Vegas run and I only started playing in April of this year and I'm level 127 now
---
Assault rifle no more than 1000. I would put in vendor at 600 personally. The tesla is prob around 8 to 10k
---
I don't wear it, but I'm pretty sure there are currently three.
---
There's the drab one.  The green one.  And the one with the shoulders.
---
And just to clarify, which skin was it?
---
Legendary boxes to ban you or scorchbeast attack to corrupt your character
---
Here's what's currently available.  There's two Ranger outfits: 
---
* Ranger Armor Outfit
---
* Advanced Ranger Armor Outfit
---
* https://i.gyazo.com/589885b6a7d351ae73b250667c5fd003.png
---
Both version use the same helmet design.  These two outfits are available for free for Fallout First members, just need to go to their tab in the Atomic Shop and claim them.
---
If you are playing on PC without fallout 1st, I would base careful of the hackers going around today.
---
Ha looks good. For some reason this only works with the urban variant and not the forest one, weird
---
Not that I’ve seen available yet. 
---
There is the Standard which is black base and tan overcoat. 
---
There is the Advanced version which is a green base with green overcoat. 
---
The aren’t armors; they are just ‘over outfits’.
---
What happened to the one with the green jacket, and no added armor?
---
No prob man. Since we’re on the subject of rads, you may already know this but my fav way to control them (as in to bring down my health to 20% for the nerd rage benefits anytime it gets bumped up, or if left it higher for whatever reason), is via drinking Toxic Goo. You can collect it from Westtek whenever you need to restock.
---
👍
---
That's weird, says that on my profile? Haven't touched it in ages ever since I got it for pc. Must be a glitch or something, im on 76 right now lol
---
I have no clue what you are talking about.  This is what's available now.
---
None at the moment, I  wasn't using Perk Loadout Manager for a long time so I'd spend levels on random cards, and I've also been tweaking my build a bit recently
---
Welcome.  This is the best FallOut game since FallOut 4.
---
I actually don't know this. Is there any benefit of toxic goo specifically over say toxic water?
---
I guess it isn’t available anymore. Look up added NCR ranger styles, there was the default, and two more
---
I live close by also, in Frazier's Bottom. Its across from the Toyota Plant in Buffalo. Awesome to see other Mason/Putnam wastelanders
---
I’ve had some great experiences in the game - very kind higher level player characters who have given me supplies, weapons, camp buildings, etc. 
---
Probably the best thing about it for me is the opportunity to be connected to a very good friend who lives far away. Playing 76 lets us “hang out” together, even if it’s only digitally - we can share quests, builds, funny stories, and general good times.
---
January 6th is the real Christmas. 
---
🐬
---
Anyway, I was role playing
---
Yes.  Come on in.
---
You have read my comments haven't you? I never said the rewards should be participation and I don't mind grinding them, but the consistency is a bit lacking, the other nuclear winter reward events had your xp count to all the challenges and this one doesn't, I'm just pointing out that it's harder because you have to start over for each challenge
---
Oh, and you may want to consider throwing on Radicol under Endurance if you find yourself needing just a bit more carry weight for a little while. It boosts strength using the rads you already have.
---
Reportedly there have have been additional 'skins' for the Ranger outfits that have rotated in, and rotated out.  Supposedly there will be new skins rotated in as well in the future, but what I showed you is what is currently available if you sub now.
---
And that is default and armored?
---
This still going on?
---
Well you just accepted my invite so all good. 
---
XBox display info can be weird lol.
---
The riot paint.
---
Yep, there’s no disease risk and there are a ton of rads per drink. At least that’s why I dig it, ha.
---
It is NOT safe to play.   
---
Someone just got their shit ganked by a griefer at my camp.
---
Seeing a thread on official forums about less than 2 hours ago instance of people once again losing everything (AKA as the first exploit the other day) while fighting the SBQ, where a lv 2-3 running around in skivvies quickly vanishes right afterwards.
---
I am only reporting that someone else reported it so take with grain of salt, if it wasn't for the hack/exploit already being very hard to believe without being hit with it personally, I would have just assumed this was a false report.
---
I would just watch news/other user reports for a few hours and skip playing today.
---
So then using your own analysis of the situation why are you trying to dictate what those hackers enjoy? Maybe they like ruining everyone elses days idk ( dont get me wrong tho, i agree with you)
---
Yeah it’s patched dude he’s full of shit. You can only put items in inventories now
---
that it can, not the first time something weird like that happened lol
---
Some random you don't even know said he took their stuff and that means he did?  I'm not saying it's impossible or even unlikely but the basis of your decleration seems fear mongering at best.
---
When he said "he stole my stuff" could that player have died and dropped junk? and he was referring to the junk being stolen? as for them being naked, well..
---
Scare Tactics...just feeding off the fear it seems
---
Add me: Koolnoob99 I’m done to give out a helping hand if you need one
---
...playing the game a hour or two a day every day since launch. The game's been out for a year, and a reasonably high number of people are 700+. It's not that rare to see 900+.
---
I got a couple Qs if any on has answers, would be thankful. 
---
Does having and using that tiny tent have any effect on your CAMP?  Can you have both a fully built CAMP AND use the little tent? Also does throwing down the tent cost caps? Does it get placed similarly to the CAMP? Like if I'm placing this little tent all the time, is there a chance I fuck it up and place my CAMP that I never want moved? Are the buttons the same? 
---
Next is the scrap. I can hold onto all the scrap? I could have 3000k lbs of scrap? What about the 800lbs limit. Is that still in play and they are separate? What happens to any scrap that can't fit in my stash if I stop First? Do I at least get to choose what gets thrown out or what? 
---
Next, is there any way for a public player to tell that you are a First player? Other than that ugly blue tool chest ( MUST I place one ??) or seeing a friend is in Private from social menu, is my Firstyness hidden from everyone else?
---
Lastly, When it says unlimited scrap.. does that scrap have to be scrapped down to components or like..can I have a shitload of bowling balls in there? Can I sell the bowling balls from the First stash then? Or how would that work? I know it's xmas and folks are busy so thanks if ya can answer any of these. Cheers!
---
I will have to try this!
---
No, he was standing there in gear, a guy walked up to him, and then he was naked in about a second.
---
On now
---
Griefer walks up to dude, dude's gear disapears in about a second, and he's begging the griefer to give him back his shit on area. 
---
I figured it was worth pointing out.
---
... Mutters something crude about rummaging in your sack...
---
Bethesda patched something, that doesn't mean it's actually "fixed". It could be "worse" for all we know. All I know is the dude's shit disappeared off his body in about a second.
---
Creator below freak show, each server hop gives you a different enemies as well as freak show isn't terrible for certain enemies .. and not over whelming if you get bored ..
---
There is a tenacious group of hackers that devote large sums of time to finding ways to attack Fallout 76, but they aren't that numerous because the broader Internet wrote off 76 long ago.  It took them a year to find this attack vector and Bethesda had it fixed in less than 24 hours on the day before Christmas Eve, in part because they couldn't resist bragging about their amazing discovery and thought they'd get one over on Bethesda by timing it when they did.
---
For a couple days, things sucked.  But I don't think we should overestimate them.
---
That's console right?
---
Have you tested that? I've heard conflicting information on how long the private world remains. Been told 5 min, 9 min, never heard 30 minutes, if so that's awesome.
---
Possibly. Possibly not. Worth being aware of, in any case. His gear disappeared in about a second, so...yeah.
---
If all else fails execute the final solution as it's stated in the beta players guide
---
&gt; Yes. Come on in.
---
You know one of these days it's gonna be a hacker saying that line
---
Really though you are a good person for doing a PSA for low levels
---
Dude it’s patched you can’t rob people anymore. He’s full of shit
---
I was about level 20ish and some level 150+ cane buy and just dropped me a bunch of level 50 3* legendary weapons because he needed to free up space. He also gave me 2.5k caps.
---
But will the workshops not relinquish ownership as soon as you leave? Even if the server stays running?
---
Its not unfounded though. Buying bad products tells these publishers that they can do whatever they want and we'll still buy it. Its exactly what happened with microtransactions and season passes and it will keep happening until people start using their brains.
---
Yeah, I was just thinking about trying to run from the ghoul mob and being too heavy to move.
---
Have a zealous bolt pipe revolver converted to a rifle.  Just added a prime receiver.  5 shots took down a level 80 scorchbeast while undected using Mr. Sandman.  I will probably add the prime receivers to all zealous weapins I keep.
---
Have 5 toons, 291, 180, 160, 148, 96. I have deleted 2 toons over 50.  700 is well within n range for a single toon player. Relish, naps, high int, and leader bobbled.
---
right on ill add you rn, I'm just relocating my camp to a new spot to rebuild. I got a habit of changing my camp locations too often lmao
---
Kool beans. I look forward to playing
---
Being able to place anything anywhere without these crazy ass building restrictions would be nice.  
---
I get they were added to try and add a bit of realism to the buildings, but that didnt work, so lets just remove the restrictions and let creativity flow
---
When I was lower level I found myself going back to Flatwoods for the brahmin and radstags for meat. Both give a carryweight buff
---
Well, can't ya just turn right around and drop em ? I was hoping for more of a Grinch ending where they give back all the stuff they stole and get received back into the community, much like my all time favorite Xmas film.
---
All im gonna say on *that* oarticular matter is, they didnt work in FO4 how they were supposed to, do you think this game has a chance of getting some perfectly non bugged elevators?
---
oof
---
Yeah realism, where 2 stairs can support a big ass floating building
---
But imagine if the reference had been the damn dog man in that movie.
---
Yep, hense the whole  
---
&gt;but that didnt work  
---
Line in my sentence :P
---
Ok so far there have been:
---
Ranger armor - the brown coat with the green helmet
---
Ranger Riot Armor - the green coat with the brown helmet
---
Then there is an Advanced Armor skin that adds the shoulder pauldrons and mantle to either version of the coat
---
There is no skins for the helmet. Just the normal ranger version and the riot version. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
That's not how you told the story in OP
---
West tek - supermutants
---
White springs- ghouls
---
Glassed cavern - scorched
---
Big bend tunnel - scorched
---
My bad I misread post I thought u meant single type of enemy
---
I mean you could do it to give people items but there’s no method to spawn shit in so I doubt it. Legendary boxes you could drop but they’re tracked so you’ll still get banned. Scorchbeast attack you can’t do shit with, it’ll corrupt you regardless. Unless of course you have the script to use and equip NPC weapons running then you’d be fine
---
No I understood that I was just stating why it failed.
---
The fact they could patch it in 24h may mean they were working on it from the moment they heard about it..
---
Technically it also has a compensator mod. But every gun comes with a compensator by default so the only mod is to take it off, which is pointless.
---
Yeah, it's definitely a let down.
---
Xp servings per person has dramatically decreased since December 2018. Imagine a smaller dinner plate being xp. But there are heaps more steady content to play now. These days are much better than those days. Level means very little in terms of strength.
---
A level 50 with carefully chosen mutations, perk cards, underarmor, armor, weapons... a build can be as good as a level 754 in an event.
---
I think you're underestimating how easy the game is to hack. The difference isn't the ability to find a way to break the game it the willingness of enough people with knowhow to troll the game into the ground. Either way it's sounding like the hack is working again, it could be a lie yes but at this point you'll never really know. The final solution is the only way to restore confidence, free peer to peer solo/invite only play is the only way for beth to gracefully land this flaming flying crate by washing thier hands of any economy or scarcity and instead let people control who they play with.
---
No worries! I appreciate the reply anyway :)
---
I'm looking more for enemies with high loot counts, like behemoths
---
CAMP &amp; TENT are independent of each other. You can have a fully built CAMP and still use a TENT. The TENT cannot be modified, except for the Holiday skin. You cannot add anything to it; it has a sleeping bag, cooking station, music chair, stash box and scrap box. Placing the TENT doesn’t cost any caps. Placing the TENT is done through your Favorites wheel; you can’t accidentally mistake placing your CAMP for your TENT. 
---
Scrap box is infinite. You can store any amount of component scrap, but not junk. In other words you can store steel in there but not a Metal Bucket. And you can use the scrap box to auto scrap any junk that would normally auto scrap. But you can scrap things like weapons/armor or baseballs (non-auto scrap junk).  Your 800 lbs stash is totally separate from your scrap box. If you stop paying for FO1st, you keep the scrap box and its contents.  But you cannot add anything more to the scrap box. You can only take it out. *(Note: Crafting/Repairs will still use your stash junk first. If you want to save ‘special junk’, put it in a display case or your vendor).*
---
Other than what you described that is visually obvious (the armor/emotes/icons/scrapbox), there is nothing that makes you stand out as a FO1ster. And to be honest, 99% of people don’t care. 
---
You can’t save infinite bowling balls. They would have to be in your Stash/Display/Vendor. The Scrap Box is for the component version of scrap, not the actual ‘junk’. 
---
I think that answers everything.
---
PC still right?
---
What is available and how do I get it? Thank you!
---
Substation in the Bog has a deathclaw but there are ants too ..it usually kills them before I can get to any.
---
Ah gotcha, yeah thats exactly what I meant by that though, the restrictions just breed the mushroom towers we see plaguing the landscape.  
---
Since we have a build budget thats done by how many thing we place, we should be able to play them anywhere within out build area, clip them into each other, turn snapping on/off etc...
---
They could have been fucking with you.
---
What would be nice is if they brought back Fallout 4 building mechanics and all the Fallout 4 assets in the settlements for free
---
Given the bugs / exploits in this game since launch, it's kind of cute that people still take Bethesda’s word. 😉
---
Personally, I'm going to need a little more to buy that story than "it happened to my friend."
---
Awesome! Never even knew about the freak show until now. I encountered 2 honey beasts
---
Don't act like Zenimax had no control in this situation.
---
Yup, it's highly unlikely they will be able to do the code injection needed to pull this off with a console.
---
CapAm40
---
I'm always willing to help or just wander the wasteland
---
I came in, about 30 seconds after it happened, and posted a PSA. I'm providing more information in comments, but as it is I'm about to delete the fucking thing and I hope ya'll are next.
---
Right on. Stay safe out there PC wastelander!
---
Seriously. I went back public because I hadn't heard of any issues since the patch, then I see it with my own eyes and the first replies are all basically "you're lying, bethesda fixed it".
---
Wait what’s the final solution lol? 😂
---
Gotcha thanks for that. I'll keep it in mind. I really like how flexible the game is. As at any time I could simply just swap in the appropriate Rifleman Perks and some others to play as a Stealthy Sniper.
---
Sure. That's possible. 
---
But for the last fucking time, It was worth saying it happened, because if you have a choice between "bethesda didn't actually fix something" and "a guy on the internet was pulling my leg" 
---
I'm going to air on the side of bethesda being incompetent.
---
I remember it was limited to 30 days. Still available?
---
God damn, how can you have all of your quests open like that.
---
&gt; **Take action on the creators of the exploit and anyone who uses it.** These people should be seen as massive threats to your game, and you cannot ignore them. Ban them from the game. Take legal action if you must. There is no excuse for you to let them get off scot-free.
---
I disagree this is on bethesda for first forcing public play, second having piss poor security/anti-cheat, and third ignoring public warnings that they have piss poor security/anti-cheat.
---
Had they allowed solo/invite only play since the beginning then we would have a situation like borderlands where the existence of hacks, dupes, and exploits don't matter and you still have a functional game even when the parent company drops the ball. The only real solution to this is giving players control over who they play with without charging extra for the privilege (at least for groups of 4 or less as that can be reasonably p2p'd, and then charge for larger capacity dedicated private servers)
---
In very, very few situations is there only 1 exact match of item and effects that is what you need (as opposed to what will be damn fine but not quite perfect).
---
I get it though, the odds are pretty long on getting a really great (even if not perfect) item that you're looking for.  Trust me, I've been shopping for upgrades for many weeks without finding anything.
---
But honestly, what else keeps bringing people back?  Once you have every perfect item in every slot, what do you do next?
---
Bethesda would probably advertise as “Throwback Settlement Pack!” Description reading “Remember of fondly building your camp in the Boston Commonwealth? Well now you can relive these memories with this throwback pack!”
---
Includes: Original wood wall, blank roof, stairs, etc.
---
The tent has no effect on your camp, nor does it effect your camp budget. You can place it as many times as you'd like, free. To place your tent, on Xbox anyway, select your favorite wheel and press Y, if it's out of other player's build areas, or an occupied location you can place it. 
---
You can have unlimited scrap, in your scrap box. Only scrap can be placed in the scrap box, not junk items. Bulk will not be stored in the scrap box, it has to be broken down first, just as junk items. I have 3k aluminum alone, along with thousands of other scrap. Grab all you can! If your 1st membership does not renew, you will still have access to all your scrapbox inventory, you just cannot place anymore in while not subscribed to 1st, only withdraw. 
---
There are 4 ways for a player to tell you are a 1st subscriber. If you have the 1st icon displayed, you're running around in the scout armor, have a 1st scrap box crafted at your camp, or pk2ace a tent in plain view. Other than those, which are easy NOT to do, no, no one will notice. (Who cares if they do? Your game your life.)
---
Hope that helped!
---
You’re not alone! I feel the same.
---
God damn. Yeah, I think I get it. Thank you very much and have a great night/day.
---
Apparently it was fixed **until it wasn't.**
---
No, I'm really not.  The game is far from flawless and I'm sure other undiscovered attack vectors exist.  But I also think that because the broader Internet doesn't care about Fallout 76, the only ones who would waste their lives attacking it are a tiny collective of bullies trying to portray themselves as a bigger deal than they actually are, as bullies do, and I choose not to give them that benefit.
---
I don't play often... and when I do I like to have a bit of a choice to what quests I decided to do or not do that day.  It's pretty annoying but I rather have them open so I don't have to go into the menu... decide which one is available... which one seems like it be fun that day and then close it back at the end of the day.
---
Probably more work than it's worth but I usually only play for a few hours every 3-4 days and don't wanna bother going in and out of the menu turning on and off quests just to find that a certain quest isn't available or in my area...
---
I wish there was a way to turn them ALL on or off quickly with the selection of one option... instead of selecting each and every one.
---
Thank you so much for this post! I’ve been playing the game since week 2 and have done a few dozen SBQ fights, but thanks to your post, I’ve learnt some new information about it that’ll really help and change how I play, so thank you!

Final Solution (Sao Abridged)

---
This is from the SAO Abridged.
---
Episode 2.
---
Step 1.
---
Send the weaker players first. As the boss is killing the weaker players stronger players go behind the boss and attack it. Once all the weaker players are dead the boss should have 2/3 of his health left, then we move to Step 2
---
Step 2.
---
Circle the boss for a few seconds and wait till he attacks. Whoever he goes for will run straight at the boss trying to doge and block as many of his attacks as possible while taunting the boss to make him mad. Whatever happens. The chosen player must not run away, he must keep as close as possible to the boss. While this is happening the other players will attack the boss. When the boss reachs 1/3 of his health the players will retract and start step 3. The final step.
---
Step 3.
---
The boss will switch weapons to a talware. We will form two lines. One at one side. One directly oposite. They will both charge at the same time and just attack. No blocking. No doging. Just pure damage.
---
Then boom. Boss dead. First floor cleared.
---
This is not for those that have everything, this is merrily a eye opener on the odds of getting something for your build and reason duping is such a problem and why people feel need to do it, but as your statement says, what is there to do next, but most people don't even get to that point, and then you have weapons lost from servers crashing and people scamming from such a bad trade window, then you have things like this last week where you get thieves jumping around stealing items from people, Bethesda needs content, Bethesda needs to protect it's users, yes it was a hack how ever there is blame on Bethesda as well for not making sure that people's content is safe as well, as that type topic was asked upon Bethesda almost a year ago
---
That'd suck, but also be hilarious.
---
