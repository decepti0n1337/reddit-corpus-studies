I really hope it does get some support. I also dropped a suggestion on the bethesda site. So fingers crossed.

So is the only solution to that getting a SSD separate from the HDD I play from, and recording to there?
---
By definition, end game is... the end of the game. Not much to do.

You find your own fun. For me, socializing has been the end game. And grinding for gear.

Nice share!

See rule #9 to the right of your screen. The reason these rules exist is because, oddly enough, an amazing number of people on the internet will quite cheerfully lie or give false reports to various figures of lesser or greater authority for the sole purpose of being douchebags, up to and including falsifying evidence. For example, all those completely totally innocent ban victims that just happened to, you know, not be innocent.
---
We are not the law, and you are not Judge Dredd. Being a counter-douche is not productive, but reporting cheaters with collaborating evidence to the only real authority for the game can be productive.
---
Including your body, there will be nothing left but dust
---
Heh no I'm on PS4 and would've been about level 120 at the time. I only got the idea because during a scorched earth event a scorched had got one and was wrecking everyone at the dropsite out of PA. I think he killed more than the queen.
---
Even if the made it a perk it could be so amazing
---
You can join and fast travel to the event within the nuke zone.
---
So basically turning yourself into crossbone?
---
This is on the stage in Lewisburg.
---
Lol I’ve never seen an enemy with a gamma gun.
---
Ha! At least you got it!

Saw my first squatch today.  Was heading to my last and southernmost uplink repair by Harpers Ferry.  Up ahead I saw green haze, methinks it's just some ghouls.  Get closer and I hear the flap flap of winged death.  It was attacking an unkow....wait..what's that sound....oh subtitles say it...crap! SHEEPSQUATCH!  I sneak and hide in the broken open back of a bus for cover..peak...both level 50's.  My level? 34.  Plus they were in combat, so my stealth build would fail thanks to Beth.  Crap! They're getting closer!  I froze in place, watched their bars barely go down....for 5 minutes!  Didn't even risk tagging the squatch....had too much junk.  They finally moved off...and I changed my drawers....
---
Fun Times!
---
Great Idea for a future, sprawling, high level el dungeon.
---
The Deathclaw is a squishy joke in Fallout 76!
---
Hey, you're an unarmed player. Question: Does unarmed include fist weapons in this game, or are they one handed weapons? Am debating giving it a go with a nice power fist I found.
---
Thank you

Nice. I'll make sure I do that from now on. It's weird though, both times it said I was in the event. It popped up on my screen and showed the image of the SBQ like normal, just no rewards.
---
Tried to cross that border right?
---
Whoah!
---
Only time I've ever seen it too. It was a serious wtf moment. Trouble was every time you killed the one that had it another would run over and pick it up. It was doing about 1/4 health in rads per shot. Bloodied builds have no chance with that.
---
Nice. This is pretty much all the good advice wrapped up in one comment.

I wouldn't mind if the exclusivity was (ideally 50%) 20% off for a week, then remains in the store indefinitely at full price.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd image 20% off still makes people buy atoms to get things at a discount but the 20% in sales they lost would be recovered pretty quickly when people who didn't log on that week want the skin and purchase at full price.
---
Depends on your build to be honest.  Each one gives extra points in different attributes.
---
I see this happen all the time when players set up trading camps and then post them on the Xbox game club. 
---
I’ve been in lines 2-5 people long many times to trade with one guy.
---
I'll add both of you tonight. I have a few solid squads but always open to teaming up with new folks as well.

Maybe a perk card that binds with pacifist mode. Spray and pray needs to be combatted. You attack a monk, you burn. Might make for a the better experience for those of us not looking to shoot everything that moves.
---
Yes they do.
---
Nobody knows.
---
&gt;And then get a mod where you strap combat knives onto the gloves.
---
[Pfffffffffff](https://i.imgur.com/fcLoCoI.jpg) ;)

I agree that this would be great. Started it yesterday by the motel waited around 10 mins but no one showed up to help so I failed miserably.

Also, if you find a neat gift with a scalpel, holla at ya boy ;)

Yes.
---
Game Transfer Phenomenon is a hell of a drug.
---
I appreciate that, but im on p.c. maybe ill give it another shot and try to find a more viable legendary. I was extremely disappointed with the two shot ultracite I picked up. i cant even kill ghouls with it.
---
Or all the other mutated abominations just died out, leaving the Deathclaw at the top of the food chain.
---
hot stuff XD
---
No problem. It's a fun build. You can run around at 20 percent health and combo adrenal rxn and nerd rage or you can pop a radaway to bring up your health some more for increased survivability if needed. I then drink some green stuff to bring my health back down.
---
Lol I would’ve definitely died then I’m running around with 60hp my damage compensates for it though cause that’s around 1600
---
I'm hoping several of the older limited time items might come back for a week as a kind of theme.  Back at the games launch I was more focused on leveling up and doing quests instead of focusing on atomic shop items.  I missed out on a few really cool C.A.M.P items that I could have used for my player owned house.  u/ladydevann I would be really happy if you could please pass this along.
---
I got a bounty for picking the lock of the govt supply drop that I called in by myself.

I finally got someone from support on the phone today. All they would say is that my appeal from 4 months ago was still being looked into and they would not do any support over the phone.

I have card but haven't been able to use it yet cause I don't have the flux cause hardly anyone is dropping nukes. If anyone has the flux I will give you the card. I will be on tomorrow May 1st around 1 1:30pm if anyone is interested. Pc by the way.

It worked the first couple times then nothing

According to Todd Howard, there'll be tokens that you can use in some way. That's all we know, really.

That's an option too!

I would love to have a shield for my one handed build.

Stable flux, ultracite scrap, rare plans would be good
---
good idea but there are still people out there that don't care and will take all your dropped loot, believe I know. Had mine taken during Sheepsquatch, had alot of good stuff in there. Now I make sure I stop somewhere and drop loot before I join an event.
---
A Gunzerker perk in Fallout? I didn’t know I needed this until now.
---
Every mask
---
But are they items taking up "10 slots" in the bowl or the stash.
---
If it's separate from the stash it doesn't matter how much they weight.
---
My girl sells it 100c psn: Frizzyliz316
---
I feel like there's a deliberate design aspect to this. I began the game with little interest in interacting and got up to level 50 or so without feeling extremely challenged by most of the combat (to be fair, I'm a sniper/stealth build). 
---
But after that I encountered a variety of situations which definitely felt like they'd be significantly easier with another player or a team. And that wasn't the biggest factor in why I did eventually begin joining teams and interacting with other players, but it does seem like it could be a motivating factor for people like me who might otherwise be hesitant to seek out shared quests or etc. 
---
Mr. Gutsy is definitely a good example of that for my character because I rarely wear power armor and heavily rely on stealth vs strong armor in general. Scorchbeasts could be another example because although I am typically able to get rid of them while solo, it eats up an enormous amount of ammo and is often less irritating when there's at least one other person involved.
---
I was surprised to see it today over by the BBQ shack today NE of White Springs.

Uuuuuh, Power fist me daddy!

yes, fire ants need a flame breath, ice ants need an ice attack

&gt;!depress ants should just sit there eating cheese and crying in the dark!&lt;
---
I do t know I’m asking the question so I know both
---
They're probably anxious. Before I began reading this Reddit and early in the game, I'd had a few griefing experiences with higher level players. It took awhile before I realized that many other higher level players were super awesome and helpful vs someone I should run away from at top speed ;P
---
I picked it up from the atom shop and its not in my wheel. How do you add it?
---
I would appreciate that tons!
---
Guess I’d better get to it before half the games population is doing it lmao. Thanks buddy.
---
Yeah I can definitely understand that!
---
YES. For example, mods that say "limb" really confused me initially. Aren't both arms and legs limbs?
---
Contact Bethesda, this would be a grrreeeeaaaat! idea!

I got all my friends into playing. We group text pictures of awesome scrap/junk we see out in the world.
---
just keep trying. i got like 7 squatches, level 80 legendary noxious and toxic versions back to back and then like 5 or 6 that were place holders
---
Performance has been great since a few patches in. Even on an aging i7-3770K and a 1050ti.

I want that blood spattered look for my raider power armor.

Key words tho.  That dropped.

So the 5

Lmao I plan on doing the same.
---
Just did it at the southern Bell. It spawns in three locations. Just go to either the BBQ shack or Souther Belle. If it doesn't start then server hop at that location. Works every time just about.
---
Ok could you be on Saturday around 7 or 8 est
---
Possibly; I can check it out tomorrow unless you find out sooner.
---
I was thinking it would be the perfect loadout against non pa users which is most but wasnt sure
---
*Slavador enters the chat*
---
I thought it was horrible for pve? What is it effective against? And what would beef up someone with rads?
---
Yes^^this! They drop 6 I think, and the XP is nice as well.
---
It’s a cash grab. And I agree with the glitches quests, there’s too many of them. I’ve gotten the kill shot on the SBQ four times now in the last week and the challenge to kill her still hasn’t completed. It’s not that hard, all they have to do is not fuck the game up but that’s exactly what they’re doing.
---
Are explosive two shot Gauss rifles legacy weapons or not?
---
They already sold us a $60 game, so that's completely moot.
---
I'm a usability researcher and in my biased opinion many of these issues could be identified conceptually prior to a line of code being written. 
---
Unfortunately I'm not open to relocating to Bethesda or nearby or else I'd be very enthusiastic about attempting to get them to hire me, heh. In general many games could greatly benefit from investing in a bit more usability research, but it's still a newer concept than the belief that the time to start research is after the game is in beta and using play testing and etc. (Not saying that play testing isn't also valuable)
---
If you dont like it, report it or block me.
---
It would allow an old man build.  Dual wield walking canes.  Mirror a walker and then bam! cane smacks everywhere!

I hunt down low levels...    and give them ammo and meds!

Ultracite is weaker than standard lasers. Just has a faster fire rate. Good for automatic but semi not so much.

This sounds like a you problem. Level 86 i can just hop in and go lol

Sometimes the scrip doesn't trigger even after a slow fight, and sometimes a non legendary drops two legendary items...

I've never researched animal control processes but it seems possible to me that an anonymous person could file a report after hearing the abuse but not actually seeing it. The only struggle is that unless they're injuring the poor animal to the point of visible wounds or doing other visible things like lack of food and water or inappropriate temperatures or etc, animal control might not be able to intervene either. 
---
But it still seems worth a try because people who view their pets as punching bags do not deserve the loyalty of their animal companion.
---
Nothing more scary than a level 90 something glowing legendary cave cricket among a swarm of them at an event. I got done over by one at Berkley springs a while back lost all my junk and the game has never been the same since.

I've been trying to get over that myself, but I can't unfortunately.

I missed out on that special ferschust event and I wasn't able to sign on to buy plague rider armor. I legit don't want to play the game now weirdly enough

Just feel like I've missed too many things lol weird iknow just saying I'm at that point.

already sent my friend to toxic valley. RIP

hold the inventory button (tab on PC)

Wow that looks fantastic!

Give them the same proportionate strength they have in real life.
---
No. It isn't. Just go play 4 then damn
---
Yeah don't do that in real life though because they haven't eliminated slap damage yet.
---
Yeah cuz im at 490 atoms and its perfect for my bar
---
I was antisocial until that level too and had no previous interest in seeking interaction. But I've changed my stance on that after some positive experiences with other players. Even after reading this forum and other sources of information, other players have still introduced me to lots of fun "easter eggs" that I would've never discovered. And it's pretty awesome having strangers give you exciting weapons and supplies. But it's also handy being able to fast travel for free to 3 people's camps which are spread out around the map cuz I'm a cap hoarder. I like to save my precious caps for things like neon letters and other critical items :P
---
*launches nuke* Swallow this bendejos!
---
Magazines, bobbles, treasure maps, disease cure, stims, chems, alcohol, and ammo. Besides legendaries, these items stick out in my mind as the most requested. 
---
I’m thinking of offering all of these either for free or at very low prices and selling different burnt comics at 50, 100, and 200 cap levels respectively as a means to ‘donate’ if the buyer feels they want to.
---
And I want to dual weild 10mm smgs like the game's commercial.
---
The war rider skin is so good
---
Sorry always been a lone wanderer till now.

They still arent the top in those games either. Especailly not in 4. Fuck Aglers

Ugh. If you're on PS4 and ever wanna play with some other female players of varying ages &amp; people of other genders who aren't stuck in 1950s sexism, feel free to message. ❤️
---
When you scrap armor, it rolls a 0.75% chance against each remaining scrap mod for that armor type. If any of those rolls succeed, you get a mod. There's no influence from any SPECIAL or perk, as far as I know.
---
Not all mods can be unlocked by scrapping. Dense, Strengthened, Ultralight, Pocketed, Deep Pocketed and BioCommMesh usually have to be bought or found, although there are some odd mods: Pocketed &amp; BioCommMesh marine, Ultralight combat torso.
---
Leather and Combat base plans are easy to buy at vendors. Metal and Marine base plans are easy to find at world spawns. Trapper and robot are uncommon spawns but not too bad. Raider is a rare mission drop at most, and wood never drops.
---
There are three different weights of robot armor with increasing defense values. I don't think the weight depends on the level.
---
I have a quad capacity explosive laser rifle if that counts.
---
Thanks for mentioning me -)) I already made a revamp of this btw. Been using that skin for the last week or so. Now the armor looks even better and I'm going to release the recently updated textures as a part of my AXPR mod within the next 12 hours -)) I'm so glad they finally released the skin. Sadly,it's another unique limited time offer...
---
Thats awesome
---
Maybe more like 1 out of 30 because I just tried to force it and it wouldn’t work until I was at vault 76 taking a picture. 🤷‍♂️
---
Nuke touch ground?
---
It happens when you have the camera equipped and do an emote.
---
I still can't believe it's not butter
---
It's a glitch with the camera if you emote while holding it it slings you around.
---
It's annoying to lose your junk though. Most of the time those bounty hunters will take your shit afterwards.
---
I'd frankly like to know my secret too. Been leveling up 2 separate characters and can't get any armor mods. Ironically those are the ones I got the laser mods on.
---
I was confused by the audio settings initially. It's possible that yours are set on team only and iirc that means you won't hear area chat. There is also a chat volume slider and for some reason it appears to default to off. I can see some rationales for that but I didn't even initially realize that people were trying to talk to me and that the volume was all the way down, so that was frustrating.
---
I've started gaming with some new players recently and they tend to start a party via PS4 rather than using team only chat so that people can pop in and out, they can easily talk to people who aren't on the team even if they want to leave the immediate area, etc. I'm more familiar with Xbox and it works similarly there.
---
Thanks for the info.  That robot armor name still has me befuddled.
---
It's a bug with the new camera. If you use emotes with it equipped it will shoot you as far as you can go to your left.
---
Thanks!
---
thanks
---
I had a random player visiting my camp and he took a drink. He ended up in the savage divide lol
---
When you mod armor, it replaces the weight name. It's pretty annoying.
---
Or maybe the Diver's Suit is a rare item to get from The Burrows
---
Damn it Bethesda. Booted from server. Going to try again.

It’s the same wire this one too. Any armor you add it to will look like t45.

Well at least it looks cooler

And what do you do with all your level restricted weapons? Obviously hold on to them but now you have to find other weapons until then. Or you hold on to all sorts of weapons for different levels. And with this limited stash size? Or you remove weapon level limitations in which why reset in the first place? It just seems like a bad bad idea.
---
I fear no man or beast
---
But that thing... That thing scares me
---
You’re doing something wrong then.

I thought about it, but I'm fully perked for auto/rifles already, so I can still kill bots easily, and damage the squatch

Platform?

Do you not take any endurance or rationing perks??? Im level 86 and I never drop below 40 purified water, it’s to the point where I have to stow away non-perishable food because it’s weighing me down.

Weapons like the Tesla rifle Gatling gun are awesome for ammo conservation and can be made in bulk if you have the ammosmith perk
---
Console? Lol

Yes, I think a few of us have run into that cave.... me and my ran there for “safety” from a scorchbeast attack. Imagine our surprise...

I've gone to punching him in the face as well. Annoying bastard.

hitting them as melee is a pain in the ass lmao
---
It's fun. I was wanted earlier and this high level dude comes prancing toward me in power armor firing away. I snapped as many pictures of him as I could before he got me. I can't help but wonder what he was thinking when he seen me bust out the camera.
---
Awesome
---
They shoot sweet sweet freedom, commie
---
Hold O and it will turn on. Its only a directional beam while in power armor or wearing certain headgears. It's more like a lamp when it's just your pip boy

Yeah I do want to see more spawns.  It feels like they're almost forgotten.

 Sneak rifles does very well solo in my experience
---
upvoted. we need to get a community manager here.
---
I keep saying it's related to server sync, that the server thinks you're on a different tab/highlighting a different item. what you're seeing client-side is not reflecting what the server is doing.
---
but I can only do so much. they **definitely** need to look at this.

All extractors (except maybe junk) needs a big boost.  Do they keep it crappy so there is more PVP opportunities?  I wish they'd just dump the PVP aspect in PVE and figure out a better way to regulate workshops.

Well if no one comes I'll do it again tomorrow and have more time to prepare.

I've still have yet to see the limited time mosaic floor set come back... and that came out after a month or so from release.

It really does, I switch between this with an instigating gauss and tse handmade and a heavy weapons/pa load out for sbq and nuke zones.

logins and fast travels work the same as in Fo4, they save/refresh your character. so something went wrong between that fast travel and the one before.
---
**if** I'm right, most of these issues are related to server sync. what you're seeing on your end is not what the server is seeing. so you drop spoiled meat for example, but the game thinks you have your prized legendary highlighted instead, and drops that.
---
on fast travel, your character is refreshed, and the info on the server trumps the one on your client, to avoid cheating. so your legendary's gone. and probably the spoiled meat, too.
---
Yeah. I'm with you.   
---
The deathclaw was the biggest nasty for the longest time. They really should be. They're supposed to be the "Dragons" of the wasteland when you get down to it.
---
There is a great guide to builds put out by nulldesu on fallout builds, can start there.
---
 [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/thebuildguide/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/thebuildguide/)
---
I have three so far.
---
Don't know if anyone else has experienced the same thing but mirelurk kings in this game are extremely powerful. Even in power armour you'll go through like 5 stimpaks fighting just two of them off and a whole bunch of ammo as well.
---
Get nerd rage perk and adrenaline reaction mutation. there’s some others but i cant think of it
---
Ill give you a secret i use to make it SUPER easy. This is legitimate advice too.
---
The watoga event “monster mash” drops candy. This candy can be exchanged for some meh prizes OR you can just eat it.
---
The candy is light, gives 1% food and like 1 rad per piece. It drops several hundred pieces per event each time it appears. (I havent been below a couple thousand pieces since i first go to watoga.)
---
Trick is to wait until your low on food or water then pop as many candys as needed, then use a radaway and regen the health by drinking water last
---
My thoughts exactly. That skin needed a more aggressive look and somehow darker paintjob.
---
Going to skip on this one and wait for the death one too.

It's also pretty silly to have us pay for reused assets from a game most of us already own, but here we are.
---
Did you kill the scorchbeast on the ground or air? Cause from the event it sounds like you are suppose to trap it on the ground and kill it there.
---
They should put skulls on some of the rebar.

Gotcha! I will add you when I get back on. Appreciate you and everyone else offering to help me out with items and xp!
---
How would you even know where the person is?
---
I’d google the mods. Those smgs don’t get very many.  I was disappointed when I found out you can’t get mods for the barrel on the 10mm
---
Thanks for this. This worked for me. (Avast.)
---
No problem bud. When you get to a certain level, you have enough resources to help and it becomes more fun to help newer players than it was to get to high level in the first place
---
In ur server.. right outside nuka plant
---
No.
---
Collision Course Event in Morgantown Airport spawns a cargobot or using a US Supply Requisition to summon a cargobot has worked both times for me.
---
No it is literally not possible to function using 2 PF. I have one and you cannot go under a 90degree angle on your arm. (You cant scratch your nose lol) Like a cast (right spelling?)
---
Bloody mess, Tenderizer, Radicool and Overly Generous if you are using melee bloody, Tank Killer is good if you are using rifles.
---
Bring on the Rogue Cyborg Deathclaw
---
U moved haha fast traveling
---
All we know for sure is that you'll be able to scrap your legendary weapons and armor for tokens, presumably to re-roll for legendary effects. We know that the train station at Berkeley Springs is likely to be his main home base but datamining has revealed there may be legendary vendor outposts or sightings or somesuch at many other locations throughout Appalachia. We also know he isn't due to appear until May 23 but I'm feeling like after player vending got delayed (at least) a month I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't hit their target on the legendary vendor.
---
Also when you scrap them you get no junk and I doubt you can learn mods scrapping them.
---
I kill him for the chance at some useful junk or caps lol.
---
 Hey quick question. Does non fermented nukashine change your screen color? Because if it does that would make an easy Russian roulette
---
Eastern time zone?
---
That leg armor clipping... oof
---
Add a queen as a raid boss for Nukes and I'm in
---
Does she sell any other serums? I used to have a serum supplier who had the full range, but he apparently is not selling anymore.
---
How about an emote where the player takes a bottle of salt, shakes a bunch into their hand. and proceeds to lick it
---
I never take it, but I always check news servers that have a claimed munitions factory to see if they locked the resource generator. If not, I help myself to whatever is in there and hang for a while
---
If I set it to area, I also don't hear area chat. If I select it to the "auto" mode, I don't hear area chat or team chat. The only option that works _in any way_ is team.
---
If that is true I hope 2-3 star gives more credit and I hope stuff he has a good legendaries, I want him to be the Xur of destiny.
---
...*but those things? They scare me.*
---
They had a queen for the fo3 colonies so it's something they have in concept.
---
Unyielding armor if using melee.
---
My Girlfriend wants me too as well
---
I think I killed about 10-12 Sheepsquatch between random encounters and the Event itself this weekend. It was rather fun. I actually successfully completed Free Range for the first time today after multiple failed attempts.
---
Adrenal, chameleon, grounded, healing factor, marsupial and speed demon
---
Well I’ll be dipped in owl shit boys! Ain’t that something!? I was trying to work on some picture quests so that makes sense! Once again reddit solves an issue, thanks for your input everyone.
---
eh, servers in Europe are pretty crappy though, so I it doesn't seem like they care too much about their performance
---
And all the 'lurks give some of the most disappointing loot in the game. Mirelurk Kings are tanky as hell, do a lot of damage, and give *nothing.* Queens at least drop stimpacks at times, but even their loot is lackluster for the word to take them down.
---
You can build farms on your camp to get easy access to fruit and veg
---
Any animal drops meat to eat too
---
Get the ammo smith perk if you keep running out of ammo, and tag lead as a search item, pick up everything with the wee microscope you see
---
I had a guy with a small bounty attacking me, and I ignored him then he asked me to kill him but that felt like a trap, then I went to the rare responder vendor and he killed it, good thing if you are in the inventory you can still buy from it. So, some people wanting to get rid of a small bounty could be bait though.
---
Bethesda should give us an option to make underarmors appear over armors, so we can finally run around as vault dwellers.
---
Much love to all that wield Chainsaws.... atom shop skin for chainsaw would be nice todd.
---
The camo pack was a step in the right direction.  Was nice that the included pattern could be applied to most types of armor.  The idea of purchasing paints for only one type of armor is a real turn-off.
---
You need a few specific things. First, you need sufficient build limit, second, it helps to have good charisma, third, they MUST be random spawns. Follow these steps, and you should have a camp critter in no time.
---
let us make rat poisoned wine, drinking it will knock you down 80% HP. if below that you die within 15 seconds.. unless you pop a disease cure. load 9 normal booze and then 1 poisoned. Drunken Roulette
---
Launching in 3 min.
---
So, how does it work is it like a container that stores drinks that gives anyone access too? Or is it like a water fountain were people can drink whatever flavor is in it?
---
First time I've spent atoms in the store since buying the game, both of those power armour skins were too good to pass up and the nukashine hat looks fantastic as well. Might end up buying the bar set too. If they keep up with these kinds of items and not lame stuff like repair kits a lot more people will be willing to spend money on the store (though admittedly the prices are sky high for the power armour skins especially).
---
#NO!
---
Just let go of the handle?
---
Dam that is dumb since the wording says or. So, I assume it has to be queen and king and the or is hatchling or hunter?
---
That's the problem.it's stash space. But 10 drinks are not 10 weights normally,but they are in these objects. I just put 3 drinks and stop. Nukashine,martini mimosa,lead champagne.
---
I saw it yesterday walking slowly has it does, had to clear the area of some nearby critters, then as I'm returning to the bot it just splats into the ground. ¯\\\_(ツ)_\/¯
---
Now!
---
Good doggy perk and dog food, two big water purifiers.  Honestly, I barely touch the purifiers anymore I get so much from events.  One run through watoga usually gets me enough dog food for several hours.  I never worry about food.  If that’s not your deal, get the herbivore mutation and plant some crops.  Make some soups, done.  If you need ammo, head to Lucky Hole Mine. One trip there will set you up for days depending on your ammo of choice.  Scrap all the weapons you find and you’ll have enough steal. 
---
The most tedious part of my day used to be vendor hopping for caps but that’s all done now that they share a pool.  5 minutes and I’m doing whatever I choose to for my time.
---
I can't wait for this week to be over so it becomes an exclusive lol
---
how many hours have you played lol
---
I agree. They’ve always been one of my favorite critters in Fallout and it feels like since NV they’ve just been nerfed down to Generic Wasteland Monster No. 5. Maybe introduce some new ultra powerful Deathclaw variants.
---
First thing is scavenging for things to sell for 1400 caps from robot vendor. After grinding 1 month to get shielded marine under armor lining plan from census violence event I can start doing more challenges to earn atoms for the new pa skins. Just do a little bit in fo76 daily, you cant live here like lawnmower man.
---
Just had the same issue. Got the "Missing Link" quest but no "Signal Strength" quest even though I used the top level of the elevator and listened to the radio. Had to logout and login a few times for it to pop up. Guess it never got fixed
---
Yeah and I want to be a group called the chad gang. Because honestly nuka shine is the f*cking alpha male paint in the game.
---
They did actually
---
If you're an anime fan maybe
---
They don’t have to. You can just inhale the fumes evaporating out of the bottles.
---
Their one major weakness: WiLl YoU CoMpLy?
---
BURN HIM! BURN HIM! BURN HIM!
---
I don't think it's noticeable with maxed class freak. Even with my Fixer, which is lower damage than my lever action and handmade, in sneak I've killed bears and gulpers, etc in the Mire with no problem in a few shots.
---
Damn rabbits will eat anything!
---
High Level Legendary Mirelurk Kings, and Foghornleghorn Crawlers tend to scare me the most since they have high perception, armor and a ton of poison damage, which is the most threatening damage type to me. Deathclaws I can just sneak up and punt them away in 1-2 hits. I also hate Anglers. :v
---
I’d sooner face a MLQ or deathclaw than a single major gutsy, those guys chunk me down in no time
---
She would be trying to stab herself with bent picks.
---
If you’re going to go down that road, go for a few more. You need four perks in luck to keep the mutations and minimize the effects. If you’re already mutated, yes it’s great for a melee build.
---
It's all White Russians at my pad. 
---
Dude approved
---
You weren't supposed to do that
---
As long as you have a nice rug near it
---
I have a quad too, and after patch 8.5 it's really not that bad (apart from having to hit reload 20 times!). It will oneshot lv68 supermutants, but I haven't tried it on a scorchbeast yet.
---
Yes, son. Go grab me a nukashine.
---
I missed the last one. What console are you on? Perhaps we could visit each other and place eggs.
---
Those fucking robots need nerfs
---
Until then, concentrated fire on their bullet firing arm and you'll be somewhat ok
---
It really does tire the room together.
---
I want that so bad. Just take up all of my screen already.
---
your description is oddly accurate. and edgelords pick the horsemen.
---
like me.
---
True facts
---
Xbox matey.
---
Definitely more prefabricated stuff like the tents would be great
---
Most likely was running fire proof to reduce explosive damage.
---
So why keep playing a game you seem to dislike so much?
---
Class Freak probably doesn't work on Twisted Muscles anyway.
---
It's not a terrible penalty though. 50% extra aim cone size, compared to 150% for Two-shot. You might need to hip-fire a bit less.
---
Thx for feedback....it’s neg is accuracy tho right? Thx affects damage too?
---
Probably full sent assassin with maxed out dodgy and serendipity and dense torso
---
i would agree, except my friend was using a TSB gauss rifle that might as well have been shooting spitballs at the guy.
---
They are in floor decor, I didn't see mine till I filtered what I could build.
---
Closing up failed  party at 10.  Might try again with more time to prep another night
---
I got guns that 2 tap lvl 81 glowing deathclaws so to make it a challenge I use my mutants explosive revolver so it's a little more of a challenge. But I do agree that the only thing that should be harder than a deathclaw is a scorchbeast. I also think grafton monsters should be harder too but maybe just under death deathclaws in difficulty
---

He explains how to maximize a bloody build w a handmade here. Low health, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, stealth to start.

Did-a-chick?
---
I'd love a sarcastic applause emote, or a regular applause
---
Just look for it online
---
I made a post on this a few days ago. When farming hatchlings, it could take quite a while to get the disease, and you'll probably have to let the hatchlings hit you a few hundred times... literally.
---
It requires patience and time.
---
Two-Shot Bloodied???
---
yessir
---
Thank you. I will pass it on to my friend who I think is interested in one of those.
---
For some reason, like the Assaultron Head skin, it's blank in the Atom Store for me. So are the in-game football outfit pictures. I dunno why. I repaired from launcher even.
---
98 NAR Regional on the tracks north of Whitesprings always has a sentry bot, who always drops a 75 to 100% fusion core. You spawn there and just go south for a few seconds and it'll be there.
---
Uh I doubt that lol
---
He was number 1!
---
why do you doubt that? i was there and the dude was eating the damage like it was sugar bombs
---
They should of made it like every other armor where it has plans and you can learn the mods from scrapping pieces of it. It's the only armor that feels left out compared to the others.
---
the new horseman has glowing eyes, despite it not being an X-01 modeled paint
---
I want one of these in real life.
---
I liked her. Well, I liked all the characters really.
---
Duel Power Armor with Duel Fat Men in one hand and Duel Rocket Sludge or anything else in the other lol
---
Still disappointed I missed out on that donut recipe.
---
The problem here is we’re talking about current mechanics and this can change rapidly. Fire rate is good now because it’s an issue of being able to do high DPS instead of high damage. Explosive as an effect is how to side step 1 shot protection. This can exceed the 190 limit since the ballistic damage and explosive damage dealt individually. Fireproof and dense mitigate almost all, but not all explosive damage. If you turn up the explosive damage with a multiple shot gun, like beam splitters, flachettes, or shotguns, then the marginal damage increase becomes more significant.
---
Do we really want this game to be exactly like the others? MY argument would be quite the opposite. Oh, the deathclaw is the hardest creature in the wild... again? Can't come up with anything new, can't mix it up a little? We're just going to fight ~~Voldemort~~ the deathclaws as the hardest villain for 7 ~~books~~ games in a row?
---
There are hardened and armor piercing receivers for the SMG, but they can't be unlocked by scrapping. The plans are pretty tough to find now, as there aren't many world spawns. Your best bet is probably to server-hop vendors in search of the mods.
---
You did what now as a kid?
---
Ewwwwwww
---
Had my buddy go afk and he muted his mic.  Apparently when the controller times out the kinect turns into the mic.  Needless to say, he missed his calling as a pornstar...
---
For strength the shielded operative is 1 point higher which is what most people prefer
---
I’m gonna need confirmation this isn’t just a way to trick us into wasting a kit on some tomfoolery :p
---
Doubt that he has a two shot bloodied weapon. As both two shot  and bloodied are primary effects and cannot be on the same weapon. Maybe he was running a two shot rifle with adrenaline reaction. With an unyielding set. But gauss rifles are very slow and their damage can be out healed by a stim pack spam after the max damage per shot update.
---
correction, i’m dumb and it was a two-shot with 10% ADS damage. i just asked him. was not thinking about the fact that bloodied and two shot are primary effects
---
Documents\my games\Fallout 76
---
I nuked this folder and the folder when the game is actually installed. Afterwards I reinstalled and it worked.
---
That makes more sense lol
---
Yes. I include one in ten so you never know what will be next.
---
How do I share photos on here? I don't mind posting a photo of my grog axe
---
If only we could make custom notes or physical pictures or a combination of both. :3
---
my apologies for the bad info lol. i smoke too much weed
---
I run this build and havent had any noticeable problems with accuracy, totally worth it imo.
---
Does it make you randomly blackout?
---
Was wondering this my self. How to tell if a silo has been ran?
---
Same happened to me yesterday in Burrows. 3* boss, no leggie on him😭
---
Escort / Protect missions are the bane of our existence, and I curse the ancestors who visited this vile fate upon us.
---
For real. The queen is a joke. I have a single piece of poisoner's gear, and I can kill her with a pistol by just backpedaling and using dog food once in a while. The kings are nasty though
---
They pretty much have a piper icon so maybe
---
Depends on what you value. I value saving my materials for repairing armor/crafting and I take a lot of comfort knowing I can go days of constant use without needing to repair my DCG or guns
---
So I finally got around to testing the difference between AA and TS missile launchers...
---
Two shot seemed to do about twice as much damage to the mirelurk queen. However, the TS barely tickled a scorchbeast that flew by, whereas the anti armor did chunks of damage. 
---
Sooo.... inconclusive. I’m guessing that either there’s a significant difference between the armor values of those two enemies (I don’t have awareness so I’m not really sure), or something wonky is going on with the mirelurk shell and vats (you’d think the mirelurk queen would have the higher defense, but the results suggest otherwise). I’ll keep testing, but ultimately a missile launcher is probably better for scorchbeasts than mirelurk queens, at least for me, so I’ll probably keep whichever does more damage to them. I can just spam anything on the ground with my shotgun and cripple their legs with the encorcer perk.
---
Thank you.
---
Again, feel free to point out where I said I dislike the game so much. Literally never gave my personal preference on the game, just the fact that no there has not been "massive changes"
---
5,functionally it seems good but it's lacking in the decorative side,actually makes me think of Alexandria.
---
I used to be terrified of them, but not so much anymore. It seems like once you hit em a few times they stop running at you. I would assume it's easy to cripple the legs since they make up like 80% of its body
---
The face confuses me.
---
I feel like that directly violates the laws of natural selection
---
DUAL MINIGUNS!!!! MUAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAA
---
Neat. GT is Endmin1.
---
Not the first time I've seen this in this subreddit.
---
The let's cook emote also has your character holding a giant gift box?
---
imgur.com
---
I found an executioners combat shotgun. I really like it. Especially in conjunction with my All Rise. They work great together on swarms of ghouls. Stagger them with the sledge, then mop up with the shotgun.
---
I'd hope so? It's a weapon in the game
---
Every. Damn. Drink. 
---
It’s like playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded Glock.
---
Unfortunately I am out of budget for decorations. I was able to put a lamp, a couch, a desk, a chair, a bed, one of each egg, and a desk statue in the house. Then a lamp and a jukebox in the workshop. Lastly there is the two poster on the generator shed.
---
due to a glitch or as some call it "Poor coding" even with weapon artisan you cannot repair a Grognak Axe above 100% normally
---
Yes. Much writhing.
---
Disagree wholeheartedly - more things need to be underarmor. So many armor pieces cover very little of your character. I was going to skip out entirely on the football uniform, but now I'm reconsidering. 
---
I want to get a new piece of armor and have it change my looks. I want to see my awesome gear, not still be using the same no-impact outfit I found at some point. I welcome more cool looking under armor.
---
The Grognak's axe is bugged and cannot otherwise be repaired more than 100%. That's why it's a big thing that the kit can repair it to 150%.
---
Use a gamma gun and shoot your own feet or drink toxic water to get down to 20% hp. That’s where you shine. Mitigation comes from (1) killing things before they can hit you and (2) perk cards like serendipity and dodgy.
---
Dual 10mm increase the damage kinda useful to hire level
---
If you can, I want this to spread like as a inside community joke. We need to spread this. Fallout 76 needs some kind of meme charm.
---
The Gamma marker is located on top of the Shopping Center building.  Just have to look around for it, northeast corner roof
---
Does this link work?

I got a video of me taking out a scorchbeast with 2 shots with it. Missing with it sucks.

Wood armor
---
Bad Imgur link...
---
right click the image itself and click "Copy image address" then paste that here. because your current link does not work on my end.
---
There are several threads on here about this. You don't need to go out of your way to post a photo.
---
Shit, okay. Deleting this and trying again
---
PC master race 😂👌
---
It’s viable. PVE wise sure. I run a stealth rifleman with a mix of plasma and laser in as well. It just comes down to legendary effects and perks.
---
Way back in the first game, I was so intimidated by the prospect of going through the death claw nest in the boneyard I walked away from the game for a few days. Man have times changed
---
just take a picture of each one, make blackbird puke or something. and nukashine do some stupid pose.
---
and photoshop "OUCH!" on the chest.
---
I looked everywhere for the tent plans when I first started. When I finally was able to build one, I was really disappointed that they don't block out the rain.
---
Quick, fellow chad! Spread this meme! We shall rise up against the virgin blackbirds!
---
It’s my new favourite thing to do.  I knew those 50 quantums would come in handy.
---
currently it is not on steam, and may not be on there until much later.... last time i checked anyway
---
That sounds awesome. Unfortunately sometimes I don’t have enough time on my hands to do these things like this.
---
My friend and I hunt down the wanted and make them answer for there 9 cap bounties
---
Where's also the support for normal armor users who want to use our equipment in nuke zones? Chems don't work and radiation suits replace everything. :( Power Armor gets all the fun in all aspects.
---
Sea of Thievea nailed it earlier this year. One of the funnest things ever
---
they buffed a lot of heavy weapons, so now you see a lot of big guns power armor users who are PVE focused. PVP in your power armor is still like trying to fight a shark with a marshmallow
---
Deathclaws were always a bit too easy for me, I never had the same level of fear of them as I have with rad scorpions, a deathclaw you can strategically attack and plan your battle but scorpions are so unpredictable always digging around you and popping out of nowhere
---
I know using radaway exposes me to the disease more but it’s this like a 100% way?
---
Posted a photo that went through!! Check it out, new post
---
It's a "feature"
---
Everything
---
I know, I just want people to see it and get excited too cause I freaked when I noticed it haha. The photo is shared now if you wanna see it!
---
I read it that way. I think even if it could be any of the four, I'd still pick queen/king/hatchling since the queens spawn hatchlings and I've seen kings around queens often enough.
---
Wait, it is actually decent? I found one at the B&amp;D and it sucked. I would gladly be proven wrong.
---
That would be wicked. Its also very logic. I don't why we neverd had dual wields
---
Haha cheers mate! I got it figured after a few tries but a few patches back the markers were just flat out unreliable. Seems not too bad now, but I definitely appreciate the tip. See you in Watoga if they  ever get legendary bots back there ;-)
---
Yay it worked!! I used my last improved repair kit to just test it out, and it worked! Repaired to 150%! So nice knowing I can use this while weapon artisan is bugged for Grog axes
---
I think most drinks are default at 1lb per. I carry them all on my person with thru hiker 3 so they only weight 0.1
---
Better answer who didn't
---
Ah i see! Thank you for clarifying that up!
---
I like the nuka shine it looks so clean but then again the other looks brutal it just depends what your into.
---
Fist weapons are Unarmed, although some of them are both 1handed and Unarmed.
---
Thank you! I deleted this and posted one with a working link and showing the photo :)
---
You can launch the game straight from the EXE if you really want. Bethesda client just keeps it updated and automatically logs you in.
---
New post is working!
---
if you check the video you'll see he had not renamed his parts.
---
and surprisingly enough, nobody cares.
---
No, just accuracy.
---
The fully deployed version of that is legit, I’d live in that in-game or in-life.
---
the War paint has glowing eyes.. if that is desired
---
It affects all.
---
I know the character you are talking about and I can assure this chat that he is a griefer.  The problem is that he's not even that good anymore and the real raiders of the Survival servers have beaten him so much for his antics that he's back to the safety servers to cause trouble as he has nothing better to do.  Many of you have seen him and his kids, and I have footage of what he does.  I am now geared against him but he continues to bother new players of the game and driving people away from engaging socially.  
---
He's a toolbag, and is rapidly becoming inconsequential.  Chock it up to him being that one shitty person in the game and hope you don't cross paths with him again.
---
I'm theorizing here but maybe they're going for a traditional vintage football outfit. Like the armor that's visible is your pads. I've seen pics of old football players with visible pads over the shirt. I dunno though :/
---
Sweet.
---
Thank you, Tesla user as well. I wonder if flipping it back and forth would work to reset? sometimes I like a server.
---
I want dual wield as well... but I'd settle for my charter just WEARING two weapons... like boxing gloves. I want both hands to have gloves... not one.
---
I just leveled an unarmed drinking brawler build during the dbl exp weekend and I was frustrated this wasn't a thing. I want double knuckles and double gloves because I like dressing my character based on the weapon they use so currently he is using a power fist and wearing a miners hat and miners oitf and i have his fave all dirty and a scruffy beard.i
---
I have to say that I really like both of them, but the whole “nuka is alpha” thing going on has completely put me off buying it.
---
To be fair cazadores were probably the toughest enemies in New Vegas...
---
Correct
---
I agree with you, but there are a huge amount of people who build in their camps alot, like me and always want better ways to improve them and make them look better. I think it's a good balance but there definitely should be more lengthy dlc instead of multiple short dlcs.
---
Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen!
---
A key thing that helped me deal with it was the realization that, in the end, some day I won't have access to it anyhow. My wife and I used to play World of Warcraft, and when I finally lost interest and looked back on it, I realized that the little things, the collectors editions and the pets and so on were meaningless, because I will never use them again. The monthly fee? Worthless, because it acquired nothing of permanence and very little of even transitory joy.
---
Some day, 76 will be shut down. Even if they permit private hosted servers, I doubt atom shop purchases will carry over.  When you look at an item in the atom shop and consider buying atoms to cover it, remember two things: 1) You're renting, not buying, and 2) you felt just as driven to buy that last set of power armor, and you're giving it up for the newest one.
---
Dammit now i cant unsee shredder
---
Nah, I know this toolbox, he isn't roleplaying a raider, he's just being a douche.  He will lose interest in harassing players soon enough.
---
Ah yes, because that's not overkill :P 
---
Nothing better than seeing (or not seeing thanks to chameleon) a dude drop down in Survival and 1 shotting everyone they pass!
---
Out of how many ppl are in the playerbase?
---
Thanks
---
Incoming nerf...
---
Well, do you get drunk and happy? Nukashine then.
---
Or, drunk and angry?
---
War rider onwards!
---
I do too. It is fun to build your camp in the craziest ways imaginable but i can't just go around and only do that. If i wanted to i'd be playing minecraft
---
The biggest problem with it being Underarmor is that it doesn't actually *fit* as Underarmor.  It doesn't bulk up your character as much as it needs to.  It clips through every piece I've tried it on and looks bad.
---
I figure that's probably a reason why none of the preview images show it with armor on top.
---
Thank you. Was confused how true "unarmed" could work with only one damage perk and no weapons.
---
I wish Deathclaw island was more of a threat :( ran through the Bog last night and only copped 2 Deathclaws too - kinda saddening. I used crap myself with the sound of a Deathclaw :(
---
I did the same thing, can’t get it off the tourist again either.
---
I hadn’t encountered a single radscorpion until the other day when I got absolutely demolished by a gang of them
---
IDK my dude, I sneak destroy them with a commanderp build
---
If you have no luck on here, consider checking out /r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
I recommend making the area of the concrete defenses a lot smaller. I tend to like the looks of compacted camps with lots of decorations within the small area. Cutting back on the walls would also clear a big portion of the camp budget since the walls are considered defensive.
---
A lot of challenges have been 100% impossible, especially the early camera ones which is the only one I seen them acknowledge, and there seems to be no attempt at compensation for all those times, which is just rude to me. :/
---
It pleases me that I can spam it and point my flashlight down on the baggy and offload all the motherfucking plans and aid items that are taking up too much space XD
---
Player vending is/was probably a trickier thing to manage than the Legendary Vendor, given it has to interact with stashes, maintaining prices, making sure it shows up on the map, etc.
---
You're right I forgot about wood armor hahaha.
---

Can you? During the event, I deliberaly hose them with my explosive plasma scatter gatling to just kinda microwave anything near them, specifically because I don't seem to do any damage to them

He's geared in sentinel armor, so stagger him first.  Or use energy weapons.

I actively avoid Yao Guai. There spam pounces are just as annoying and inflicts more damage than pre-nerf Scorchbeasts. Did I forget to mention that they can stun chain you forever if you get stuck? If you get pinned the spam stun will make it impossible to even heal.

Seriously, avoid the bears.

---
Well it can be a good build heavy weapons but there is better legendaries such as Gatling gun, laser, or plasma and you would have to build armor and mutations around it. I’d say give it a few more lvls before you go into this build. I recommend power armor with a heavy gun build

I'm not so sure... you could technically do this event with 1-2 people... The Encryptid one has a 'high' cost to start and needs quite a few to ensure success.  Plus the rewards are far better for Encryptid due to the difficulty.
---
Free range is 'just another event' that pops by being there... not like the Nuke Launching, or the SBQ spawning, or like the Encryptid.
---
Yeah. On your pip boy.....
---
I seen it. but it's not getting enough attention. that thing needs to be spammed to hell until it gets to Bethesda
---
Agreed
---
I play 2 load outs for 1 character, heavy weapons and sniper. Heavy weapons benefit from the bear arms perk giving them 90% weight reduction. 
---
At an average weight of 2 you can carry enough weaponry to invade a small country, I tend to carry an auto grenade launcher, lmg, 2 .50 machine guns and a minigun for a carry weight of around 10, which is around half the weight of a decent handmade rifle.
---
With bandolier I can carry tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition without any problem, the only real issue is the colossal amount of ammunition you’ll burn through in this build.
---
what system u on?
---
Dual wielding would be q great feture
---
I didn't think of trying that, but I will if I get bugged again and see if it fixes it.

---
* Most of the game breaking bugs are fixed
---
* Survival is FFA PvP with a leaderboard for kills, but "meaningful" is self determined, and it is somewhat gear focused.
---
* If you found the PvE boring, it's never going to not be boring until they release the Vault raids, and probably not even then.
---
* Game is still easy if you have stupid awesome gear, but it's not quite as easy as the "lol TSE One Shot Deathclaw Bitch" era, just the sort of generic easy any game is before real end game content comes out.
---
* They've never cracked down on modding, and the mods are slowly getting more elaborate (I have a few myself, like the glowing meatpile mod, because I got sick of looking through red tinted bushes for red tinted lumps).
---
The legendary vendor is coming soon, supposedly making it easier to gear up, which means there might be more challenges to come. That said, you might still be somewhat bored because most of the content updates have been PvE. I'd suggest waiting until the raid thing has a release date, and hopping back in then.
---
I know but we shouldve gotten actual content when the game came out or just sooner than the time that its gonna be released
---
A set of raider-themed camp items must be in the wind, as well. Nothing like corpses speared through the anus and decapitated, placed thoughtfully next to the respective victims' heads to really tie a camp together.
---
Fucking nice man! Good read

And you probably do you dirty commie :D

You play on PC? Update your custom.ini. They add new archives with new textures periodically and if those aren’t added to your custom.ini they won’t display in game. You can compare between the default fallout76.ini and your custom.ini

When I got the sheepsquatch mascot head from the imposter, I immediately put it on with a matching outfit (skiing outfit, if I recall, the white puffy one) and started creeping on people in Whitesprings. I'd wait in a relativly out of the way place, and when someone ran by, I'd follow them. If they started interacting with a vendor, I'd duck behind a counter or be peeking over a shelf or just be sitting in a chair behind them, waiting for them to turn around. At once point, I played hide-and-seek with soemone for about 10 minutes, following them and trying to duck out of view whenever they turned to face me.
---
Flaws 3 and 4 are out of date. Heavy guns were buffed so they're very strong for PvE now. 
---
The LMG is extremely powerful but I don't know if you can main it due to the ammo crafting problem. The usual combination is a Gatling for ammo conservation and a 50cal for the dpm.
---
I’m launching tomorrow on ps4. Them damn kids man. I swear mine will make me miss anything and everything with this game. AND HE IS 10
---
Where can you get it
---
Or maybe other things should be more like Mr Gutsy? It's nice to feel threatened by enemies and not just do a routine cakewalk solo collecting heads and whistling as you go.
---
Wow! Amazing pictures! I wish I had this much fun with my friends in the game.
---
Even just a separate spinning drive would be better than recording to the same drive you're playing on. Honestly, if it's from 2017 and has spinning hard drives, it was never a supercomputer or anything close. You can grab a 250GB SSD for peanuts these days, throw the game on it and record to it, it'll give you plenty of room for both. Better yet, grab a 1 or 2TB model and just put everything on it. They make a huge difference and don't cost much nowadays.
---
The improved repair kits right now drop as an event reward from successfully fighting and killing the SBQ

Alright, what's your psn?

It’s true to make daily money and have all the stuff you need I spend the week gathering caps and ammo and mats then play on the weekend lol this is my second job

Power armor might have lost some damage resistance and I have noticed with excavator that sometimes it shows plus 200 instead of plus 100
---
Blat-blat Gutsy is a wrecking machine.
---
It's only in a specific spot at the very back of the cave, and it dosn't appear until you walk into that part. Further, the cave is kinda sprawling and maze-ish. All in all, it needs a solid exploring before you can reliably find them each time.
---
Not really, a one generation mutation could theoretically be an apex predator but perhaps it just can’t reproduce or gets super Aids and dies before it can bust a nut

Deathclaw hasn't been scary since fallout 3, maybe New Vegas.  I echo your bummer, as I remember the terror they once brought me.

It doesn't matter the amount of patches in time, there's a game I play a lot (and it seems to be generally liked by most of the community I've seen) that's only had 24 "large" updates. The game was released in 2013. So it's had 24 updates in 6 years, meaning it averages 4 updates a year. 
---
Meanwhile people regard it in a high light and saying it's basically a different game compared to launch and *much* more fleshed out (and I agree since you only had a few classes and weapons to play with, and only one singular map)
---
This is a game with a 9/10 on steam and PC Gamer gave it an 86%.
---
With less patches per year, hell even less patches in a full year than half a year of FO76, and this game is regarded in such a high light because of the quality over quantity mindset Digital Extremes has in making their game
---
Sure. GT is Endmin1

We've had a good deal of speculation on here for a while now, but there's finally some proof. Quickly scrapping large amounts of items will end up scrapping different items in your inventory, even outside the tab you're on. If you count the amount of confirmation boxes OP had for scrapping, it looked like much more than the amount of weapons that were scrapped
---

Alrighty then. Thanks guys.

How long have we been in the vault though? I feel like we can't have a seemingly infinite amount of these creatures out in the wasteland if they can't reproduce. Can't argue much against the superAIDS, but it would be a bit too convenient
---
lemme put on my tinfoil hat and continue on with the conspiracy theory from the beginning of the game's life cycle that this is all just a non-canon simulation
---

Tbh it was effective against humans but there are none........ Also it would be a shame if you were radding someone up and gave them marsupial or plague walker

He's not being defensive, it's incredibly obvious you are making a large scene out of nothing. 
---
He just said he doesn't like the game in *it's current state* and that he lurks this sub so if he does get back into the game he knows what changes were made, or if he sees a change he likes he can give it a try.

Jesus is this what our community has become? You're accusing and trying to make this guy out to be a bad guy in this little world of yours, and this is from someone who enjoys the game, but unlike you I can realize it's not perfect and some people may not find the various bugs and glitches fun.

Isn't there a mod for spiked gloves in the game?

I was up north and was following a road and there was like 8 of them together, no joke. I was like level 15 or so too, and I doubt they were high level, but they destroyed me. I kept dying and trying to get my stuff back and chip at their health. Eventually killed enough of them to get my stuff and run.
---
Thanks, that fixed it. :)
---
I usually hop on the mic and ask if they want the bounty cleared if it's something meager. Over 100 caps, I feel they earned it, and I go wreck face.

I’m really debating buying it from the Atomic Shop, kinda wish they’d show all horseman of the apocalypse at once and let us choose or buy them all.
---
Not right now. Probably tomorrow. If not tomorrow or Thursday, definitely Friday.

---
Not necessarily. Things like a lower food supply could leave bigger animals such as scorchbeasts, Yao guai etc to starve because they couldn’t find food. Snallygasters would die out because there’d be no more people creating them with fev and they lack intelligence like the super mutants to use fev themselves to multiply. Grafton monster would face similar food issues. Just to clarify, fallout 3 and new Vegas there was less flora and fauna in the world so food seems to be a lot more scarce there. That may be why you see more insects in the other games than you do in fo76 (I personally don’t encounter many insects in fo76 I may be wrong). If that is true, then deathclaws would survive since Jackson’s chameleons eat insects so the mutated version would eat insects and survive food scarcity in a way other large animals may not.
---
Thx guys
---
Rad-rats are tougher than deathclaws, I'm convinced.
---
I know how to make it. I needs blight now, which means I’ll have to fast travel to the Ash Heap.
---
Three players died on almost the exact same spot as I did,so l our bags were lined up next to each other, it was really cool that each person very carefully looked over the bags to choose their own instead of just taking everything
---
I think from a lore perspective there isn’t supposed to be that many of each creature, I think it’s just supposed to be one of each. More than likely a game play thing as killing a cryptid and never encountering it again would be lame. And by super aids I meant more so that it’s a miracle this thing is alive to begin with and/or the environment is not sustainable for the creature (like how some animals can grow to be massive but don’t because there’s not enough food)
---
Want some cheese to go with that whine?
---
Why ask to push back content thats a big reason people come back to a game not fixing the queen flying out of bounds or the fact having 100 freinds messes up the menu
---
I dissagree, this event is very common and will get old fast.
---
Doing the event a few times will get you all the available loot that's unique to this event unlike the  other event you will need to run a ton times to get everything and wont show up on the map naturally.
---
Where..I only see them at the golfclub
---
Right now, I'm mostly wanting to find out how to get the Mothman one
---
I mean, logically in the lore it makes sense, because the Master hasn't gotten it to be stronger yet but still, terrible for an Apex Predator
---
I think we're SOL until it gets (hopefully) fixed. It happened to me and a couple of others the other night. 
---
A legendary in sugar grove also disappeared on me. Or sometimes I kill something by myself and there is not a single piece of loot on it. It's frustrating, but then I move on.
---
 At least on xBox the chat feature is glitched.  My friend and I both have the in game chat turned off and we could both hear each other.  I went into my settings and changed it away from the off setting and then back and then it turned off.  I have also heard random people talking that I got close to that I am sure thought there mics were turned off as well.  It is broken.  I would leave your mic muted at the controller.  Off in the settings is not necessarily off.  It has been that way for a while.  I first noticed this several months ago.
---
The tables as bar stools are the real heros here.

Can you elaborate?  Been around since week one but still only low 40s  due to time constraints.  What do you mean by “learn the game”?
---
Hello! I really hope we'll hear a word from devs about vertibot glitch xp farming. People got hundreds of levels for weekend with it. What will happen? they'll Get banned? Will you rollback their accounts? Or will you just leave everything as it is?
---
It works in photomode 2
---
Yeah, I agree with you. That's why I called him defensive.
---
Is there any actual back story to these?  I can understand Nuka paint, or camo paint, but these 4 don't seem to have a story to align it with a faction or some such.
---
All right, so a couple things I noticed:
---
A) You confirmed way more items than you actually scrapped. I counted 34 confirmations, with what looks like 20-something weapons. It's hard to tell because of points B:
---
B) The weapons did not get scrapped in order. If you look as soon as you go to the weapons tab, you have a M79 grenade launcher. That gets scrapped way before your cursors scrolls down to it. There are also times where you confirm a few scraps and either something disappears further down or nothing at all happens, so it appears that something on the list below where you see was scrapped, or something not on that tab entirely.
---
C) Near the end, when your cursor was on the double barreled shotgun, you got a notification for being overencumbered again. That is the exact point where you scrapped your power armor leg. Can't say for sure when the others got scrapped, but that is definitely what happened to the armor. You can also tell because your max carry weight dropped from 460 to either 310 or 390, can't tell due to the quality
---
FYI, Gamma Guns can not have the double or quad legendary effect.

Sheepsquatch imposter disappears after getting defeated

Recommend any in particular?

no I get that a lot as well, at this point I try to avoid games that use FOMO to sell you things.

Same thing happened to me. I didn't understand what happened until just now.
---
Can vendor's sell them?
---
OP are u aware of the games market subreddits?
---
it was a joke, lad
---
I didn’t even know there were plans for the fire axe. Good info! I’ve been scrapping ones that I find in the wild or buy for around 12-20 caps from vendors. I never get any mods from them. I have an awesome legendary fire axe that I’d like to upgrade. Does anyone know if you get mods from scrapping these?
---
That’s a Sharp one you cheddar believe it
---
This doesnt work as well as it used too, it still works just not for plans. I recommend the area near the mothman museum
---
Just like most everything in the game, if you have a good shotgun build including enforcer and scattershot perks and a decent weapon you can stagger and suppress most anything, be it a death claw, more lurk king, scorch beast or even a Col. Gutsy. It's a very powerful build if you do it right...
---
That’s how I feel. They come out with goofy over sized heads for regular armor, which is fine because who doesn’t like humor? But some of us do like the more serious or tactical look. I prefer not having a giant head when piping lol.
---
Now that you mentioned it, that might be where they are found.  I'll go hunting for legendary vendors, hopefully they'll have some.
---
i think you replied to the wrong guy. This is the guy who said he isn't interested in FO76 in it's current state.
---
Usually he is invisible, just look for him it’s there always for me. Best is to crouch, that way you can find him better.
---
If you wait a few minutes he’ll become a pile of metal and you can loot it then (:
---
They grow smaller initially to adapt and then after a few years of eating wastelanders they grow back to their original big state 🤠
---
yeah im confused as shit. im just gonna abandon ship now. o.o7
---
It's so annoying
---
Excavator armor and a Gatling Laser finally helped me put Gutsy in his place.
---
In the New Vegas DLC Old World Blues the damn robo-scorpions kicked my ass
---
even if you dont have the statue unlocked it's still there. it just has the lock on it, it took me a while to find it too.
---
Finally someone that agrees with me 👍
---
Okay so it sounds like those patches notes were mostly adding things and FO76 patch notes are mostly bug reports. This is getting to the point where I'm getting annoyed because you're trying to combine Patch Notes and Content Updates into the same thing. 
---
I'm assuming you're referring to Warframe? Yeah no bud, the updates they released vs the updates FO76 has given us are not comparable. I'm trying to explain to you people that the game still has god damn bugs in it from when there was a BETA but y'all seem to think that's fine and whatever cause I'm done trying to argue over a game I never even said was bad to begin with.

The ranger station in the cranberry bog has one as well.

Not I. I play enough and grab what I know I need often so I always have what is needed to repair stuff and can always just play the game. It’s not easy at first but after a while you know what to grab as you roam around and maintain a certain number of necessary items regularly.
---
How 'bout next time you help me with the sbq?
---
It has its uses.  I love It on small fast melee weapons.  I run a pistol vats gunslinger build and its annoying when the enemy has like 2% health left.  Whip out my executioners combat knife and let ole stabby save me a bullet.
---
Not sure what u mean. Are you asking which armour it can be apply too(it says in the description) just do you want photos for each set it can be apply on?
---
Does it give the effects of the drink? Can I fill it with Nuka Cola Dark or Whiskey? Getting 10x the use from one bottle if I'm at my camp?
---
If you enjoy the lore and exploration I suggest doing those by yourself because it's hard to pay attention to details like reading terminals, listening to holotape, etc when you're in a team or voice chat. When I was playing with my wife, it was really hard to listen to things and we often had to shh each other cause we were reading or listening lol
---
It's also an industry term. I used to install them.
---
Yeah I am. Is this really I'm demand?
---
I swear, I was playing with you earlier on PS4. Either that or you have a fucking doppelgänger walking around out there.
---
So how'd it go?
---
I think the big problem is that the Deathclaws we encounter are always by themselves. I remember having to fight more then 1 during Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Especially that 1 town in Fallout 3 that was full of them.
---
Ideas: Add a 'Horde' event that's essentially Deathclaws with one 'mutated' / boss one that has more health. Or adding more deathclaws spawning together, like 1 leader one and a few lower level ones. This'll make the more dangerous parts of the map an actual challenge to all players.
---
Happened on my first try so I never did it again. I just wait until someone else does it now.
---
I have the time but not the armors

They had plenty of time to come up with content before release. Instead they left us with a short, boring and unsatisfying "story". Don't even get me started by saying "they didnt have the time to do proper content" because it truly is just ridiculous

My main character did not really have a set build..perk cards were all over the place..then I created an alt character..who exclusively uses rifles..I use that character more now..maybe u can possible also create an alt character to test other builds?
---
lämp
---
I was thinking of this 2, maybe they could make it a 2 star level 50 perk card and make it 5% for the first level and 10% for the second
---
It's actually a big. It's fully visible at time of death and as body falls to ground it goes invisible.  If you know the general location you can still usually find it. Just a hassle
---
You really gotta do enough damage. People say that the queen has some really nice explosive resistance and you have to do ballistic damage to actually hurt her and I don't think grenade launcher has that. I'm using 50cal and gatling gun and I'm always able to loot her.

Doesn't capture the Fallout aesthetic to me. At least the Bone Raider skin seems like something that would exist in the world. The prototype ultracite doesn't look that great but it would probably have existed with that paint scheme in the early stages of it development. I have no clue what's going on with these horsemen skins. The plague rider doesn't really have an explanation and honestly isn't that different from the x01. This one doesn't look badass to me either. It looks like someone super glued some pieces on the chest and arms. The helmet is done well but the rest kinda blows. If they wrote them in to the world instead of just having them be these skins that pop up with no explanation I might've been slightly interested but I'll spend my atoms on skins that resemble the art style that this game has been running with.

The added some for the camera (separate from daily/weeklies).

When you reach level 50+, you learn what you can do to maximize your build and understand the AI of all the enemies, killing them becomes fairly easy when you have both of those things, you eventually begin to understand how to fight each specific enemy type with maximum efficiency (spend the least ammo and take the least damage while taking them out relatively quick), i am making my third character now and ive had some people help me transfer some stuff (mainly ammo and a couple weapons) to this character so i can level up a lot easier and faster, simply by exploiting the AI of the deathclaw, i was able to kill a lv91 glowing deathclaw at whitesprings when i was lv34 (wouldnt recommend trying this tho since it uses a very high amount of ammo at that level), something else i learned by playing the game so much is that vats focused builds, stealth focused builds, and bloodied builds are extremely powerful in this game, especially if you are lucky enough to get legendary gear that is good for your build
---
I'm kind of holding out that Bethesda will release some sort of re-spec system. Not that I hate the game or anything. Its just that I've put so much time into this character.
---
Don’t forget that in Tactics, they were *playable, intelligent characters*. What happened, Deathclaws?!
---
Or I would be able to buy it in the first place when I get paid.
---
That sounds like a plan.
---
Yeah nah just tried that, no luck
---
Idk then, I've never seen it go invisible when it dies
---
Maybe then I could finally get a legendary ultracite Gatling laser by just crafting 300 of them.
---
Sorry mate, it's worked for us three times.
---
yeah I understand..pretty soon u will be at such a high level u can just switch cards the way u want
---
Nocturnal wood armor with poison resistance even?
---
I'm a big fan of his hat.
---
And add more useful or interesting ways for other player to interact with our camps?
---
The punch bowl and player vending seem a good step in this direction.
---
Lucky U, didn't waste 4k of ur caps on a glitch. C**t of a game, developers would rather push sh*tty atomic shop outfits than fix there long lost of bugs on this game. Legit f**k Bethesda.
---
Explosive and SBs are weird. I suggest trying a more convential weapon.
---
I can't wait.
---
And what good does it do to bring more people to come back if they will stop playing once again when they see how bad the game is in term of stability? If anything it will break it even more and bugthesda said “too many items crash and un-stabilize servers”
---
I am not as angry about these things as you are...
---
I haven't started the event myself yet, only went when it was already started
---
Yep! I took a picture of it in-game so you can see what it looks like:
---

Alg man cheers for the info
---
On PS4
---
I got a level 50 that needs to do 90% of the story however they're encumbered so no fast travel (not a mule, honest) If you can hang with a boat anchor I'd join. However I usually suggest most people to max out before doing the story, just like I did.
---
It's worth it because it's a guaranteed 3\* legendary mob, so fast traveling over there isn't exactly that big a deal to be guaranteed a legendary of some sort (or drill lol).
---
get close to him if he's about to die. You'll be able to see his silhouette even if he goes invisible. bit risky, but it's better than losing your hunter's wood chest piece
---
Ah, it's a random drop from legendary enemies
---
Stop saying bugthesda that shits cringy server stability is better than ever the release bug fixest weekly sometimes biweekly it just sounds like you wanna make a scene for no reason
---
Only
---
The brahmin outside my camp did this all the time. I would spawn in, see them chilling, go about my business, and then turn around to see their bodies bobbing in the lake. Couldn't even loot them. :&lt;
---
Yes, level 91s are okay, let's see some 119s. I want to know what it's like to pelt them continuously, round after round, with my 5mm Gatling gun crippling it's legs from 40m and watching it stagger across the cranberry bog. I want to see it's body explode into a bloody mess and also probably like 8xp.
---
Yep, you can get about 2 or 3 I think, but they are guranteed ones that everyone gets.  I'm mostly talking about the others like Mothman or Scorchbeasts.
---
Kinda hard to do when I'm meleeing him myself, being killed, and respawning, what kind of glitch allows the player to deal a fk load of damage to the enemy and not even be able to loot it if u don't watch it die cos ur respawning. It's laziness my Bethesda, they have enough content time to develop brand new outfits and camp items for the atomic shop but can't even fix on game glitches after 7 months. Legit last Bethesda game in ever spending money on
---
What about he server disconnects? Or fast traveling to a place and items disappear from your stash or inventory? Or dying and dropping weapons/armor? Imposter becoming stealth and unable to loot? Constant server disconnect/crashes? I’m talking about all bugs in general. Not just these 2 I talked about
---
There's a rumor that you need to deal some percentage of the queen's HP to get a share of the loot. Grenade launchers might not cut it, especially the M79. I recall my one of my team using 40mm grenades on the queen and they rarely connected for some reason. Maybe get a 50cal and a few heavy guns perks.
---
I haven't had any trouble getting loot off the queen personally.
---
Man now I wanna post some of the pics my buddies took.
---
where is the flamingo in the truck?
---
Try this:

BUGTHESDA 
---
Weekly or biweekly? You sure about that? We are at patch 8.5. With patches every month or more. With small .5 patches 2-4 weeks after game breaking bugs are reported
---
Ive done it a few times too, never died though.
---
Those challenges don’t exist specifically so you will HAVE to buy atoms. Business is business; they gotta make money somehow.
---
I was really hoping we might get to make ghouls too!
---
Let's replace 97% of the molerats with ants. 😊
---
Also vertibots and cargobots! Summon them with the US Supply Requisition Holotape.
---
Someones been hitten the salt sacks if you actually paid attention theres regular bug fixes youre trying your best to avoid the facts of it and if the games been out for 5 months and its patch 8.5 and updates come every month then id like to know what kinda math youre doing
---
Yeah I converted my 17 quantums into nukashine today. My friend has a base right outside one of the stations and we've watched 2 people drink it today already.
---
There's a difference between "this enemy is a threat" and "why the fuck is this goddamn robot ripping through my Max level XO-1 and killing me in five shots"
---
This man is something else
---
Thats what I forgot!
---
And yeah thats how I got my photi of the cargo bot.
---
I want to try this
---
Going into 6 months. And by your claims “biweekly” would mean 2 patches per month. 6x2=12. We at patch 12? Check your math again kiddo
---
Same here, I hate the way outfits hide your armour. I don't use any outfits for this reason and I think it's such a waste.
---
You can get the Wendigo if you complete a quest. I can't remember the name of it, but you trigger it by going to the shack on the cliff, across the river from Harpers Ferry. Its a new quest, but old location so you may have already stumbled across it.
---
I'm loving this one. I got the Plague Rider too (I'm a sucker for the PA paints/skins), but this one is my favorite.
---
HERETICS!!!
---
Youre not doing hot your self so were at patch 6 instead of 8.5 of is it the other way around youre also still avoiding everything ive said youre just gonna piss your shorts till people agree with you have fun and if you hate the game so much stop playing and leave this subreddit does nobody good with more Nieghsayers
---
I just went to a radio tower and loaded a US Supply Requisition holotape, went to the drop off point, and took a pic while the thing unloaded. Its convenient because they get close to the ground and stay there for about 15 seconds.
---
Yes it is
---
You have to do a certain % or amount of damage to get the loot. I always loot her but I’m wailing on her with 2 handed melee and doing substantial damage throughout the fight.
---
They'll fix it eventually. Until that happens, you gotta do what you gotta do to get that loot
---
That's what makes it fun.
---
I just checked using my alt, and the camp loads in the world when you start loading, while you yourself are only in the game 3 seconds after it has loaded for you
---
Dropped my new character grinding just to do the nukashine quest for this. It shall be glorious.
---
I’m shotgun/explosives... guess that means I have to respec into another weapon for SBQ fights?
---
Disease cure
---
I HAVE TWO HANDS, YOU BET IM GONNA BE DOING SOME NINJA SHIT WITH BOTH OF THEM.
---
Pacifist, not Passive.
---
It would literally be a Chest Piece you have to wear so you could carry both of them on each shoulder, Glorious.
---
no full details are currently out, as far as i know
---
How about having weapon mods for our Power Armor fists? I wanna have a Machete hand  if I'm using a one handed weapon in the other!
---
Gotta do what u gotta do aye? Like spend 4k caps on assaultron recall cards for some good loot? Hmm?
---
Doesn't the vendor bot have a stash box?
---
Nope
---
yea i know thats why i said (do you think we are just screwed)
---
glad I'm not only one, I ranked to lvl 4 gunsmith just to add a sight to my gun......sight? WHAT SIGHT!?
---
When you open your emote wheel hover over trade and press Q if your on PC
---
If you don't have any perk cards readily available to use I wouldn't worry about trying to respec... Just take a non explosive weapon and try a fight that way. Things like grenade launchers and missile launchers are buggy on a good day, but especially with SB. Try a fight with regular bullets to see if you get better results.
---
I see it's a full moon
---
I was kind of hoping I wasn’t going to die because it was so nuts. Also a couple times I just zapped like 100 yards away or so. Very strange.
---
I actually find it really annoying we don't dual wield all fist weapons. Even if you still only attacked with one at a time and had the same DPS it would just look cooler.
---
Although dual wielding should give more DPS too, even if it was just a percentage,  and maybe replace power attacks with a smash. Striking with both for like 250% damage? I don't know what it does now.
---
I'm on Xbox but I think i figured it out. Thx!
---
Screwed how? No difference between a 50 and a lvl 350 besides perk cards. And you can have an optimal build by 65
---
IMO the best spot is north up the road from abbys bunker past the wendigos i tend to find all kinds of tamables there
---
Haven’t avoided anything you said 🤷🏻‍♀️ simply proved your bs claim of “biweekly patches” false. Patches are Monthly with minor patches when they’ve fucked something up pretty bad. Like the whole mods thing with patch 8. And oh I’m sorry didn’t realize  this was Soviet Union and we didn’t have freedom of speech. I paid out my pocket like everyone else for this game. So I have the right to demand/complain/call them out when they aren’t doing their job, or only doing the part that is more convenient to them. How come they fix problems with purchases in atom shop so quickly? But can’t fix all the other problems? Ever thought of that? $$$&lt;— that’s why
---
If that’s true, and it’s the reason I’m not getting loot, then I don’t see how I’m supposed to do anything about it. Im fully specced into shotguns and explosives, and no amount of spamming either seems to do the trick. 
---
People are saying it’s because explosives don’t work, for whatever reason, and I can’t exactly shoot her with a shotgun while she’s flying to keep up dps. So... I guess that means I have to spec into a new weapon type just to fight her? Assuming that’s even the issue... Seems poorly designed.
---
Crafted legendaries is the only way a sheepsquatch weapon or imposter head gets used
---
i personally hope it is a case of "trade in 100 levels to rank up your legendary level" so say if you are 350 you can rank up 3 times, and drop back down to 50 with 3 stars. unsure of what benefits it will yield though
---
DO IT! I snatched all these out of the last little whiles worth of our group chat, and there isn't one, we managed to stuff one in the cab of the truck across the street fro billings homestead
---
we are getting a special perk for every time we prestige ...I am asking would we just get the one or would we get multiple
---
Probably just one, to leave players on a level playing field
---
Yep, sure does!
---
Good point. I was saving a 3* legendary assaultron head, and then they make the reskin a *whole separate weapon* for some reason.
---
There’s a handful I think look good enough to warrant not seeing the armor. Most just feel goofy and out of place.
---
Seriously??? My Camp has been up by the barn for almost 3 weeks.
---
Im tempted, but I need to get the permission from my buddies before I post pics. Its not their faces or anything, but it still feels rude. :)
---
I also use an anti-armor combat shotgun. Doesn’t seem to make a difference. But then again, I’m only able to do actual damage with it when she’s on the ground, so I’m still not doing a ton of damage overall.
---
I’ll try bringing some random ranged ballistic weapon and spamming that. Hopefully it works.
---
&gt; got corrupted
---
how is that even possible? so you lost everything on it?
---
The claim of regular/bi weekly patches isnt false since they come in .5s not solid ones so yes its correct you proved your self wrong by adressing we are at 8.5 so its not an everymonth thing and your complaints are being heard but mabey they like when you play nice and not insult i bet it feels real good when youre a retial worker and a customer shits on you for you doing your job but its kinda late and a mans needs a nap hope you enjoy the rest of your gaming night :)
---
this is what im hoping , I hope all my hard work is just gonna put me back at lvl one with that one special perk they give us
---
I had a couple people add me and gamed with newly made friends. :) I appreciate you!
---
The only good loot I’ve gotten from that event were the event rewards. Drops are absolute shit for me personally. But it glitches and crashes on me fairly often.
---
Seriously, they are losing my interest because of this limited time crap.
---
I heard it was because they had trouble with sound files but that doesn't sound right. I actually had one with the same rolls as Medical Malpractice haha. I was ready to go
---
The frogs do seem to be a tad illusive.. However they can be found as a definite spawn at Whitesprings near the Golf Resort.
---
If you are a melee build, get ready to get staggered every .3 seconds by yao guais.
---
Same!!! And I wanna try feed it a bloatfly. :D
---
You load it in the same way as the fermenter, you can only place drinks in (not beer for some reason) then other players can drink from it they dont have to be on your team, I'm not sure if it dispenses a drink at random or whether the player gets to choose Im going to test it with a friend tomorrow as I'm curious. I'm hoping its dispensed at random.
---
Yeah I agree with this. Deathclaws should be scary, but I don’t need them to be the endgame enemy in every Fallout. 76 particularly has a decent amount of new enemies that could take that mantle. Wendigos still scare the piss out of me (I’m only level 37) and I haven’t even seen a Mirelurk queen yet. I enjoy the idea that there are bigger and more mysterious monsters out there.
---
Clap clap for the downsydrome developers who think buggy content is better than no content and fixing the bugs -_-
---
well that wouldnt be fair to us players that have 1100 hours
---
Excellent explanation thank you.  Keep getting frustrated at not being able to level and struggling so much but the double xp weekend was awesome and this definitely helped me with what to expect as I level.
---
No more wasting ammo shooting paper bags!!
---
Also you have to take a pic of a turret! That doesn’t makes sense to me but whatever.
---
It's 10%, but stacks with yao guai ribs/glowing steak. So you can get a total of +20% melee damage.
---
This is it exactly. They’re intended to be rare. Not everyone will have every skin. In fact, only a select hand full will. Everyone is not entitled to have everything just because they like it. These are essentially collectors items; you can have them all of you pay dearly. Otherwise pick your favorite and get it for free using in game earned atoms.
---
Your mileage may vary.  I tend to see few legendary creatures in the world, horrible rolls I suppose.  I'm level 125.

Me too! Rad ant lager is my new favorite thing.
---
This is a good idea, I had 3 scorch beasts spawn together, was only level 24 I ran, And ran, and ran. Then died.
---
That is the Motel one that I mentioned
---
I have 780 hours and level 215. I don't mind it because besides perks (which you'll still have) the only difference between a 65 and a 350 is how many caps they lose in pvp. Levels don't mean anything past 50 so why should we get an advantage? I'm pretty sure balance is the reason they're making this chance, they're doing it so our levels have to roll over to 1
---
These are supposed to be banned now. Lol. I'm on XB1 unfortunately
---
They really need to make some signs to put over that mirror
---
It does work but there is a risk with it, make sure you have a gas mask ready in case it drops you somewhere nasty.
---
Photos... found the store photos aren't always that great.  Would like to see it on T51 or X-01 - the two with other types of ingame Nuka Paints already.
---
Good times! &lt;3
---
Just make sure to wail on her with your shotgun when she’s on the ground and that should be good enough. I just take potshots at her with an anti-armor handmade while she flies and kill the adds and it seems to work for me.
---
There's a lot of stats missing for weapons in general. When in crafting, clip sizes don't tell you specifically how many bullets they hold. Or it says "armor piercing" but it doesn't tell you by how much (so you can make the decision if the trade offs are worth it). There's a lot of basic info missing from the game. This made a lot more sense in Fallout 4, but in an online game...
---
The roof pic of meg and I on the bench (aka the best camp piece in the game) is too rad
---
I'm on a PC. I'm used to having a companion or at least some NPC to interact with. It truly feels lonely in here
---
Nah- 3 stars are out there for free. It’s not ‘what ya gotta do’
---
Hands down the best photo out of the bunch , no doubt
---
Fair enough I just think that the damage resistance should be set by the outfit if you are wearing a suit you should have the DR of a suit.
---
Motel? No, its the one that takes you to a unmarked sunken church. Nothing to do with a motel.
---
I have an alt build just for it! I made his face look like Dog the Bounty Hunter, and gave him the duster and some sunglasses to boot. Anytime I see a bounty pop up, I’ll go after it. If it’s a low level character, or the bounty is only 5 caps, I won’t take their junk. Otherwise, it’s open season on the wanted!!
---
Y'know, I'm totally fine with that. Give the items personality. Tell us a bit about the T-60 armor series when we inspect the individual panels, give me lore about the golf club (The Whitespring's finest!), rolling pin, or other random loot. Like the "commendation" item. It's a visible award medal you can pick up in game, but there's no info about it.
---
I'd totally love a Dark Souls-esque history of items and lore when viewed.
---
Oh okay ill just camp at whitespring and fight everyone there for the ghoul spawns like everyone else -_-... if u spend caps u exspect to get something in return, not a fking glitch.
---
but thats the thing a lvl 350 should have more power then a lvl 50
---
Sentry bots are my #1. Almost level 50.
---
&gt; Maybe allow you to check the map while in game.  
---
And an event tracker. Let me track all active events and their time limits from the app. My phone can be more like a Pip Boy to help me track what's going on.
---
Too big a friend list?
---
Mr. Gutsy with the assault rifle. Makes me want to run 5 pieces of Troubleshooters Sentinel armor with the bullet reflection perk maxed out along with all the other damage reduction / avoidance perk cards.
---
The trick, though, if you can pull it off is to just never come out of sneak and kill them in one hit.
---
It took me 961 rifles (about 125,000 caps of materials) to learn all the mods. They count as energy weapons so be sure to use the science perk(s) that reduce energy weapons cost when you build them. It should be 11 screws and 7 springs per rifle with the right perks.
---
Never leave camp without my space suit, and helmet. But usually rocking the VTu jacket and tinfoil hat.
---
So if you cook the sheepsquatch alone (no recipe required) it is 10%. But if you use the recipe the squatch drops (I can't remember the name) it is definitely 15%. Totally worth the effort. I just planted carrots in my garden for the future.
---
i think u  are confused it's exploding energy weapons that don't drop anymore if that's what you mean
---
But once you prestige you won't be a lvl 350 anymore, you'll be at "prestige 1"
---
To many friends made the game unplayable for a lot of us . I assume it was some bugtesda screw up
---
Literally any kind of interior wall.
---
Yeah, just realized I can't read. I wonder if you can stack all 3l the three for 35%.
---
It's good to have at least the helmet favorited so you can put it on fast, doing that has saved me a few times.
---
Looks like he was plucked right out of Freeside NV
---
I have played this game very single day since the beta! Bethesda should discount the atom shop!
---
Limited does not mean one time, they will be back
---
[Ada hated that]
---
It refused to land. I activated the thing and it just wouldnt land. So maybe that's why.
---
Generally it -is- horrible for Pve, cause too many things are immune to rads. You can murder scorched with it for lols though, they're not \^\^
---
No... Trading posts on r/fo76 were banned. Supposedly.
---
Oh my bad, you find the letter to initiate the quest that leads to that church.
---
Tomorrow?
---
Fast travel somewhere then Fast travel back and a meat pile should appear wherever you killed it, that’s how I usually find it for loot
---
oh my bad I didn't know that
---
It's how I got it. People have pointed out better ways to farm hatchlings via nests, but I did it through a queen who throws them at you as eggs. There's a theory that you can get if off any mirelurk enemy type, but if you can, the chances are extraordinarily rare, and they're equally rare to get off the hatchlings, hence why you need to be hit over and over. I have video proof in the post I did that you can get it off diseased mirelurk hatchlings. You might get it the first time, you might not. Getting the disease is as simple as waiting to contract it as it hits you over. and. over. and. over. Fortunately hatchlings do almost literally nothing in terms of damage, so if you can get it off any mirelurk enemy, the hatchlings are the best of contracting it. There's also my own theory that The Woopsies has a WAY lower contracting chance per hit than intended, as every other disease off an enemy is contracted by just being within a 10 mile radius of them.
---
I was able to get it within 30 minutes after 6 server hops trying to get a diseased hatchling to spawn. First time I waited 5 minutes and nothing was happening, so I hoped servers. 5 hops later I finally got more diseased hatchlings to spawn, and got it after letting them hit me for 2 minutes. You could get it quickly, you might not. You definitely can get it off them though, and is the easiest way of doing it.
---
And yea, I'd recommend using radaway for the -50% disease resistance.
---
It's a stupid change. But checkout r/fo76bazaar.
---
I did try that no luck
---
Yeah I'll be on tomorrow a little earlier than I am tonight just message me I dont mind.
---
I'd rather fight the lvl 91 glowing Alfa in there than I would the scorchbeast outside
---
I must test!
---
I seen ppl looking for him with night vision scopes too, but never tried myself.
---
Stealth build sappin mah sentry!!!
---
wow good idea
---
I pulled a sentinel piece off a 3* wolf at Bog Town. WS isn’t the only way to go. And glitches suck but I don’t feel entitled to something every time I spend caps. Can set off Free Range without any cap investment, if you’re looking to save change
---
If you're on Xbox my gt is the same as my username
---
Hope it helps you a bit. Good luck
---
Ive dced like crazy today too
---
I stood and watched as a group of three ants brought down a deathclaw by themselves. It was a little sad.
---
Millionaire bro, same with the few sets of bos plans I’m sitting on to
---
If you are going to have a place called "Deathclaw Island" put more than one duxking death claw on it. And when it is nuked I want to see posg apocalyptic Juraasic Park God damn it!
---
I had one today disappear but was still lootable
---
Toughest wendigo is lvl 42 in my option they need to up that considerably
---
now those ARE quality
---
When ur spending upwards if 1k on an item that gets used in the process of trying to get other times u can see the frustration. Yes I myself have received many 3* items outside of whitespring and this event but that is completely off topic. The topic being spending 4k on an event that doesn't drop the rewards. That's like going through the process of getting a keycard, going through the silo, launching the nuke on the prime spot and no scorchbeast queen spawns. You've just wasted valuable resources on something that's suppose to be guaranteed.
---
I bought it, because I don’t fancy this raider look. Saw this coal skin a lot last days too... so yeah. It’s always subjective when it comes to skins/looks.
---
It was good enough one time out of five. *shrug*
---
I purchased the bundle and can confirm that the fancy furniture was included with it
---
limited time sucks, full stop. I'm still upset I didn't get the hot rod power armor skins but did get the station skin and it only be a repaint for one. I wanted both style stations to have the skin!
---
I played since beta but didn't know enough about the different power armor sets to make the purchase - I would now knowing what I know now alas I can't...
---
Chances are that most atom items were made long ago not only that adding in outfits is completely different than fixing code for something like that
---
We got a 3 star sheep today and it dropped a 1* exterminator piece of crap lol 
---
The Imposter event is the best, but not for the loot from the robot, the 3* gutsys are where it’s at. The last few weeks I’ve gotta more then a few insanely good rifles from the gutsys. 
---
Every 3* gutsy my party killed we got a 3* weapon or piece of armour.
---
The last gun I got from the gutsy was a max lvl 3* Furious, explosive SMG with vats crits filling faster. One of the best guns I’ve ever got in all my 170 lvls of playing. 
---
I’d recommend getting a team of 4 guys and having one guy at every corner on the lookout for gutsys, sometimes we buy the keycards and just let the sheep die and chase the other loot
---
I’d still like to see a giant Deathclaw named Gojira for a boss battle.   Or maybe make it duke it out against a giant protectron named UltraBot
---
Went invisible on me today too but you could still see the slight distortion from its cloaking on the ground d so it was lootable. Literally cloaked instantly when it died.
---
I’m on Xbox I was looking into doing a junkie build but it’s to much of a hassle so I passed
---
Papertatoo I’m going to hit you up tomorrow night for a serum if you don’t mind!
---
Dude I get being annoyed but come on its just caps which are easy to get
---
You could probably farm that many caps faster than you did the event
---
Stuff like this is why I left and why I am staying away for a while. I like the gameplay and I love building but the bugs just became too much to handle and really drug down the overall experience.
---
It displays as if it did
---

Yes, the only thing I don’t have plans wise is the dense plans. I actually just found my first one two days ago on a sloth at the scorchqueen fight.

#CONGRATULATIONS
---
I dropped a bag at a low health low level dude this am before the icon came out, I just wanted to get him healed up but I had to log after... wish I had had this icon and could leave little notes or something. I hate how communication is so restrictive in the game
---
Dude u have to spend stable flux aswell to make the key cards. Not only did this waste my caps bit my valuable resources.
---
You got any more of them free stimpaks?
---
I love it so very, very much.
---
Ive honestly not gotten 3* off either done the robot 3xs and real like 5 just today but its just shit rng not something worth getting pissed about
---
It looks unique, well done and it's a free emote... 
---
Why do you have to complain about everything?
---
It's in the wheel but you need to expand the expand the wheel to see it. 
---
Same with the free PvP emote we got awhile back. 
---
I'll grab screenshots when I'm back home later :)
---
Major gutsys are quite a bit tankier than the lower level ones and do decent damage. Colonel gutsys just shoot depleted uranium rounds at you removing your health rapidly.

---
Dude, calm the eff down.  It’s a game.  Stop playing it if you’re so pissed.  And maybe don’t make fun of the challenged folk in the process.  🤷🏼‍♀️
---
The thing is though is that once youve drunk the nukashine theres no going back, it will put you somewhere else when it wears off
---
You get that easily from the queen or from WS 
---
Try using a lfg so you can join others each willing to make a key card or something or realize that you may not beat it or if you do rewards may still just suck
---
I could see being super pissed if you got ripped off for 20k or something but damn man it seems to me youre making a much bigger deal than it should be
---
Yes. RNG. I've gotten 3* off a no star legendary before. So it does work both ways.
---
lol, make me go get a flare gun. ha!
---
Same. And crazy laggy
---
Dude, learn to take a joke. If u don't like it then don't read it or comment, have stopped playing and am playing days gone lol.
---
Switching weapons with the last weapon thing is faster then most reloads

I figured it out. It wasn't checked as active in the atom shop. Thanks, though 😊
---
Hide not his my lvl from other players

Calm down Satan.

I'm doing the same thing and my camp is a giant red barn on the steel node next to the road from the overseer's camp to Flatwoods.  
---
I expect to start seeing level 2's in the mire now.
---
yuussssssssssss
---
Patience. Sheepsquatch was added, i see new enemy types being added every few months atleast.
---
Really, you want them constrained to making ticks and liberators forever? Really?
---
It's instanced, every player gets it once a day.
---
Dude. Going through the process of firing a nuke takes alot of time and resources. Ur completely missing the point. It's an event. Rewards should be guaranteed. If I'm spending valuable resources and actual caps i espcect something in return. Not a f cking glitch.
---
1. Yes. That be awesome    
---
2. Not enough songs.    
---
3. Yes. Make those photos useful.   
---
4. Something like this might be coming already. Probably wrong.    
---
5. Umm interesting. I kinda see this working.
---
The only mod for them is spikes. You might already have it.
---
fast travel away and come back. has worked for me every time.
---
Grrrr, my bad.
---
How fast word gets around. I was just there and spawned in at the same time with someone else. He then sprints towards the spawn point like it was a race. Mobs havent even rendered in yet when we got there, luckily it was anglers so i just shot at their lights before they even got to spawn.
---
Flying Deathclaw...not too shabby of an idea there bud
---
I thought that guy on the front of the boat looked familiar u/PSNKazamati
---
expensive limited time stuff is always a way to get ppl to spend their money on your product.
---
this is shitty buisness practice but it works 70% of the time
---
Well, I found a megasloth but then 3 wendigos spawned in and slaughtered us haha I'll keep trying this spot, though; thanks!
---
I think Obsidian wanted to add flying Deathclaws into New Vegas but weren't able to get them working right in time for release.
---
I don't have the game cause of the messy launch, but if it's improved I'd definitely try it out on a free weekend and see if I'd buy it. Though I haven't kept up with the game much so idk what's changed so far.
---
If your on PC the 3 dead scorched beast was me, and yes there was a sheepsquatch on both. Had 2 scorched beast on each of those runs. If you see a lvl 230 thats me.
---
Tried this a good 30 times Sunday, server hopping for it. Diddly. Saw tons of plans don't get me wrong, but RNGsus is a fickle bitch.
---
yes it's great just go to the spot if it's not a tame just log out right there when you spawn back in you will be at abbys bunker again and repeat
---
It can be indeed, sorry dude
---
They have the green shirt and combat boots outfit
---
#NO!!
---
I could go with ghouls scorched and super mutants wearing power armour
---
Ohhhhhhh.... I'm so sorry... you've misunderstood.  Nobody at Bethesda gives a single shit about this game at all.... Yeah... it's disappointing.   
---
Remember to spend a lot of real world money on Atom Store ^tm points though.  That way you can continue to support the laziness and contempt for the playerbase Bethesda has displayed since day one.  
---
If I load this game up, load my laser gatling gun, switch to something else, and then back: Will it count the ammunition I've loaded into it, or will it count how many fusion cores I'm carrying on me?  
---
The people responsible for this game are an utter disgrace and under no circumstances will I *ever* give the Bethesda Store another dollar.  
---
There's a lot better games on much better platforms.

There's a couple posts already

Wouldn’t ghouls wearing power armour be interesting?
---
the only stand i care about can stop time when you scream za warudo
---
7. Character name floating over my head, not account name.

Posts like these sure beat the hundred "put x in game, Bethesda"
---
I just want 2 g*d fucking d****d boxing gloves!
---
I disagree. It's not the most feared creature in Fallout, Cazadors are the most feared thing. Change my mind
---
nononono. They SHOOT commies. They shoot Freedom AT the commies.  
---
Murica!
---
id want normal ghouls, Scorched in power armor, and even if its not "canonical" some Night-kin
---
I just checked and I do have them. Thanks for letting me know! Now I don’t have to keep picking them up.
---
Atom shop description says casual, I think
---
 It kills me the giant sloth with foot long claws is a wuss. Not to mention the deathclaw being turned into nothing. I took out 2 lvl 80 and a lvl 65 scortchbeast the other day . without help. then last night get killed by an oversize bug. the balance in this game is non-existant. most screwed up fallout ever. Nothing makes sense. rifle scopes weigh 6 lbs. a 7 to 10 lbs weapon in real life weighs in at 22 in f76. nothing in this game makes sense. This could be the end of Fallout. One of the best series ever. Until now....
---
10 lbs is 4.54 kg
---
flying death claws are the scorch beasts. give me some Cyborg death claws. mini guns and rocket abilities at longer ranges.
---
I’ll never change haha
---
Does the Nukashine one has any unique sounds to go along with it?
---
My camp is on a main road with everything you need to make adhesive in easy access
---
You must have been very lucky. I farmed it and did not get the same results.
---
Server hopping: out of 31 mob spawns, 6 Legendary mobs, all level 1 star and 4 of the 6 were sheepy. They dropped no plans, I think that is only from Free Range. I killed all mobs and lots of high level mobs for good experience, my character went from level 90 to 92.
---
Best item I got was a one star Bloodied  Crossbow, got other one star stuff like tire iron, cult dagger. Not lucky I guess.
---
About 4 times level 68 scorched were fighting level 5 glowing cockroaches, and that seemed a bit one sided.
---
I wouldn't even say it's better than back in January. Still disconnects and the lag drives me insane especially when running or opening the map.
---
Lore-wise maybe it could be stated that they hadn't perfected the chameleon's mutations into deathclaws yet prior to the events of Fallout 1, resulting in less predatory breeds.
---
Its not limited time right? It is pretty awesome
---
Fallout 3- Albino Radscorpions
---
Fallout NV- Deathclaws
---
Fallout 4- Random vertibird dropping on you
---
Fallout 76- Fucking anything goes
---
There is another Sheepsquatch spawn north of Red Rocket Megastop.
---
Yoooo! What’re ya looking for?
---
Ran into him on the ski slope at top of the world also. Not sure about respawning there. On the slope that has the camp at the bottom, the short slope of the two.

we need more camp budget if they're gonna keep adding camp items.

thanks for the tip. lol

Haha full dive would be awesome.  I'd sign up for a real sword art online.  Death game and all!!!

Gutsy's are beasts. Have you heard about cave crickets though? Boi-howdy, them sumbitches destroy me.
---

---
AA gauss if you are rifleman spec'd is awesome. Mine is only 1 star and I 1 shot max lvl super mutants from stealth all the time.
---
Yeah, I’m kind of considering it myself. People say the game is a lot better than launch, and in a lot of ways it is, but it’s still in a very sorry state. Not just the bugs, but balance issues and poorly designed pvp... hard to have fun.
---
Okee thanks.  Never been there before ..
---
2k caps for 4k fuel?
---
That makes sense. Or maybe in order of how they appear in Book of Revelation. Then the Pale Rider is the last one. Let's wait and see.)
---
What they are yes, but not timers. Just vague pictures and guessing. Through all of the ups and downs they keep hiding numbers in a type of game that people scream for exact numbers.

Thats the painfull truth unfortunately, however most peoples I guess, wont buy atoms and if Beth leave only crappy items in store they may not get any profit at all.

So they can get more atoms out of us next week probably :-(
---
Ooh I like that idea!
---
Thank you!! :)
---
Right?
---
I dont think the game is still so expensive. In uk fo76 on amazon standard edition for ps4 only £14.
---
I definitely want way more of it! More dialogues! And we should be able to actually learn more about some creatures and able to shoot a bigger variety of creatures. Wendigos, Scorchbeasts, Flatwood Monsters and etc!

I didn't realize we're posing this guy, ive ran across him 2 times on xbox at the Farris wheel up in the left top corner. Usually sitting in a large group of chairs

Marsupial is a must for anyone with a gun. It lets you jump up onto things outta mobs melee range.
---
Adrenal reaction is good cause it slowly ups your damage soon as you are hit, unlike bloodied that only starts to kick in at like 50-60% of health.
---
Speed demon is good for running from or toward mobs and boosts reload speed as well.
---
Healing factor will full heal you in seconds once you are out of combat. Wont save you during combat but if you survive you don't need to waste stims to heal after.
---
I feel like a better way to judge it is based on how many hours of entertainment you get for each 14$ paintjob. I doubt you're getting more than 7$/hour worth of value at that point...

There are 880 possible solutions for Bravo this week, so all the solving groups I know are waiting for a letter to appear on the board on Wednesday.

If anyone is in a hurry for it to be solved, and has 880 keycards laying around, feel free to grab the code pieces and use [NukaCrypt.com](https://NukaCrypt.com) to generate the codes and have a go at it!
---
On a side note, I've seen some folks asking how they can help the solving groups. Keycards. We always need keycards!
---
So did you get it?
---
No :( Haha
---
Thats about right....you know...bethesda!
---
Thanks, really good video that I hadn't seen yet 👍😁 lots of interesting info.
---
I tried that one and I'm wanting cowboy boots instead of army boots. But that one is the closest I can find.
---
I've got a anti armour fire axe, it's great
---
Yep their closed fissures there’s actually several and there was a lot of mystery/theories going around, dw their not worth anything even nuking they are litterially just their to look cool
---
I tried a bunch of the other locations and server hopping did nothing. Went to the water park and had it pop after changing server one time.
---
Damnit that looks good...  But doesn't go on Excavator... damnit... Not really interested in the Horseman ones... but that Nuka job looks great - so it's Black and Gold?  
---
(Are you on PC?)
---
There is a challenge for killing wanted players so untill I milk all those atoms I'll be out there killing them
---
That must have been a long time ago, pretty sure that's a legacy weapon and doesn't drop anymore.
---
Tried unbinding it too but I need it for vats and inventory. In other games I use the scroll wheel as abilities, here its really annoying to accidentally open the favorites menu.
---
Why so you can go buy nukashine? How about I buy you a cup of corn soup? gEt a jOb!
---
Yes. Limb damage weapon and you can lower their DPS somewhat. Still scary as heck when you run into 5 of them at same time.
---
Right! I’ve discovered that location on three different characters and still can’t get the reward.
---
Sometimes you can wait and it turns into a metal pile from which you can pick it. Also, use some perk cards as other methods to bring the price down to a little over 1700c. Also have stuff to sell ready to get back a % of the caps in the vendor. The cards can be far cheaper with a little due diligence.
---
I can picture the expression. If you watched the Comic Relief Doctor Who spoof "Doctor Who and the curse of everlasting death" it's probably that of Rowan Atkinson's face as he opens the door&gt;! to find a room FULL of Daleks.!&lt; Welp.
---
I can understand this. I got stung in the ear by a honey bee when I was 5.  It gives me immense satisfaction to go lvl3 bloody mess on a honey beast.
---
Bethesda, make a mutated monster version of my parents having sex so I can shoot more childhood trauma in the face.
---
.... never have I known that I’ve needed something so bad till I was told...
---
I cant reset my hiding vs scorchbeast for some reason. Makes crit/sneak so much less potent. Thankfully if I have a crit built up my instigating dragon can 1 shot most scorch beasts. That being said, the deathclaw poses almost no threat at all compared to a scorch beast... they destroy armor with those fly by acid drops and once your armor is gone you're basically a little bitch.
---
No, no, no! That just sounds like an ass kicking waiting to happen!
---
Welcome back!   Bloodied is the funnest build.
---
Not if you 1 shot them.
---
Occasionally a few are at Top of the World. One times plasma grenade shows them the door, normally.
---
Don't know, I killed Kings all the time and never had too much difficulty with them.  Some headshots and backpeddling and was fine.   Legendary Mirelurk queens though?  Horrible to fight!
---
War rider
---
Can't nuke it sadly, it's inside the Forest Safety Zone (or is that not a thing in Survival mode?)
---
Nah, you were right the first time. (S)he has a trans-dream.
---
They already said this was coming
---
Some people have had really bad luck finding it at all, it can't hurt to share when you find it! I only found one on Reddit that needed it, but 3 friends hadn't found it yet.. so it helps.
---
Eh, if you can find an area with hard cover they aren't that scary. Alternately, in an open area or if it's the variant that has mortars... say adios to your face.
---
I'm still here if anyone else needs the camera. body is at the top of lighthouse
---
It’s the glass....
---
They have been there, but I think there are new fissure sites that are appearing
---
Almost all of those are more dangerous than any of the strongest deathclaws. I can take out a deathclaw in an open field before it gets to me with a non legendary rifle. Specifically the worst of those are the mirelurks and assaultron. Gutsy's would be bad if they were any tankier, they do a lot of damage.
---
The fact that you put ISS at #10 when it's literally a raid boss makes me wonder what you're smoking.
---
Personally I like to become a conduit and jump up onto my pylon, up on the antenna. Not sure if bugged or not but half the time I don't take any damage from being a conduit while I"m up there. I've heard rumors that the damage is increased the further from a pylon you get and I'm leaning toward some truth to that.
---
Na, I can pretty much kill them without them shooting me once.  They just have armor penetrating rounds. 
---
Stealth 3, snipe them about 3-4 times and they go down.   Usually do not come out of "Cautious" mode before they explode.
---
Though it's not going to freeze the meat, it's just gonna slow it experation
---
Still something
---
Are you beeing sincere or ant agonizing?
---
LOL I just had someone do that on Xbox. Blocked them and hopped servers. Haven't seen them since.
---
Yeah, but it would be nice to be able to keep food for later
---
I see.  Well glad to hear that, its really frustrating here.
---
I’d upvote but it’s 76 upvotes I see.
---
Yea easier if you server hop, also unless you fight back or take a workshop, they cant kill you.

Unsure, used to be able to go over but they may have capped it now

Ya the problem was I owned 4 of them so no matter wat they could kill me idk y I didnt think they could either but I wouldnt even be by the workshops and it would show them as enemies and they could kill me it only went on for about 30 minutes but the first 10 minutes I was just trying to get my junk bag
---
Y'all need some energy resistance in yer  builds!
---
Ya I definitely should of earlier
---
You know for a fact that they wouldn't make the NPCs killable. They haven't done that for the actual NPCs in game. Why would they do that for the human ones? 
---
When was the last time you were able to kill Rose?
---
Not really. I will own those skins until the game dies out. If you want to put a value/hour only for the skins you'll have to do so for the entire lifespan of the game. Besides, i'm sure Bethesda will allow us to use PA as decoration sooner or later. Having the full horsemen set will look nice.
---
And really, i don't mind supporting a game i like. I'm okay spending my cash on some skins to show bethesda that skins are worthwhile and they don't have to implement pay to win items.
---
Metro Exodus was 60euro and i finished the game in 30hours max. I'm not a person that usually replays games so the value will never improve for me.
---
Add me on PSN r_castro33
---
For sure I’m On right now
---
Dude. I know you are trying to help but like I said several times now: I have tried EVERYTHING. THEY ARE GONE FROM THE WORLD. They disappear once you finish Signal Strength. Problem is solved now though.
---
We don't need to freeze meat, it's not exactly hard to find.
---
i'm game names maxbrady123
---
I saw an unyielding build tonight that was 34
---
I’ll add you rn
---
You can't damage the cows once you start the event.  No friendly fire.  There are sometimes "extra" cows that you can damage... I just kill those as they get in the way.
---
Pretty sure not even bethesda know what this game is
---
Killing YOU would have been fine. I'm not a fan of CAMP griefing though. dude who was trying to follow me was pissed because I killed him and 3 of his friends repeatedly at a workshop. They left and apparently watched for me to go to my CAMP then just unloaded on it. Followed me when I hopped. Then I just blocked them all and fixed my stuff.
---
Pulled the trigger and got 76 ... enjoying it so far after only one day of playing . Must have put ten hours on it yesterday lol. Level 8 nearly
---
That is some bullshit, straight up.
---
I run a rifle melee build and have talon and twisted muscles. No issues at all for me with weapon accuracy. Vats is perfectly fine as well. Hip fire isn't great but who cares
---
I often wonder if griefers come on Reddit to find the people whining about griefers so they can grief them. Or did I just have the best idea ever?
---
I wasnt that upset about the first workshop but when they kept following me ya it was ridiculous and ya camp griefing sucks I work hard on my camps
---
there's no way that's intentional. right?
---
If you go directly west of the pumpkin house, it'll be set like that every time. The weapon changes though it seems, justchecked on it on my way to a daily.
---
Most griefers grief everyone except people that can kill them easier and this is the first time I've whined about griefers there is survival for a reason
---
I can't see what you are talking about...
---
My tip: place a stash box close enough and you can access it. :)
---
I'm not complaining at all I'm just stating facts
---
I don't see it , I mean i can tell the bottle are arranged I just don't see what it's saying
---
Its a 4 panel story titled closs" that has become somewhat of a meme in reposting
---
No of course, the animation *rigging* is the same, that is what an animation is. In the "let's cook" emote it's a pie. They recycled it.
---
Absolutely. Major gutsy makes me rethink what im gonna do.. i paid an pretty penny for a troubleshooting grognaks axe just for them. 
---
3 star axe and decent armor still hardly hold out for more than just a single bot
---
I'd move glowing wendigo down and colonel gutsy up but the rest is pretty good. Also where would a scorchbeast go?
---
Look at how the beer bottles are arranged, now image a certain 4 panel meme comic
---
oh ok i've never heard of it
---
I'll probably be on tomorrow, I'm going for one last push for division 2's platinum
---
MEAT. SANDWICH.
---
now that you mention it, I did go through that area once and saw the bottles.
---
and I thought to myself "you're just seeing loss everywhere, stop"
---
guess not
---
I agree, but IMO this whole game is as far as you can stray from fallout. The whole thing feels like a new IP with fallout features added in.
---
LOSS never changes
---
I thought the exact thing and took a photo for the memories lol
---
PvE in a nutshell;  
---
______________
---
I loot ballistic fiber, plastic, and lead, so I can repair my gear, bulk up my inventory, and make enough ammo.  Then I use that ballistic fiber, plastic, and lead to go out and loot more ballistic fiber, plastic, and lead, to re-repair my gear, re-bulk my inventory, and re-make more ammo.  Then I go out and loot more ballistic fiber, plastic, and lead....

A wild person, in it's natural habitat.  Watch as it grazes amid the... oh he's fast travelling (or server hopping, you're never quite sure).

---
"Hey guys a 3* over here... wait, some dude 1 shot it."
---
...
---
"Hey guys a 3* ov... nvm."
---
"Hey guys... *gutteral exhalation*"
---
Neat, that 3* just dropped a real deal 3* legendary gear.
---
but it's almost always trash-tier weapon or armor, with equally bad legendary effects.
---
Feels like a "ya gotta know somebody" thing..underground stuffs
---
Cause like 80% of us are scratchin our heads
---
PVP at workshops is part of the game. CAMP griefing is a recognized issue they are addressing, so that's really the only thing that bothers me.
---
If you put on the long or duel bar and use it's flamer mods then use weapon artisan perk to get it too 200% it does 37 dmg 12 electrical per second.
---
Add bloody mess and adrenaline it does even more.
---
It says it's slow but it isn't, it mows through enemies but it loses its dmg quite quickly due to durability.
---

Well since you asked, I can see how people like it, but personally it looks tacky, like supremely edge-lordy, and detracts from any existing sense of realism.

Im pretty sure the vending machine and console are player vending that's coming in soon. M pretty positive of that
---
It's nice we have these options, yes. But it's stupid of them to not label it extremely clearly. If you buy it from the featured section there's even less indication.
---
The ideal solution would be making it both
---
“Am days gone.”
---
*posts I just wasted 4k 3 hours ago*
---
Ya but they were exploiting it to grief
---
I am level 118 and I am not doing the Robot virus upload in Watoga because the Robots all attack in mass and their ammo chews through me like paper... my TSE 50 cal machine gun isn't much help because they want to get up point blank to me and the explosions harm me too... I think that the quest is probably meant to be done with multiple people... but I am usually a lone wolf.
---
For point B, I think this is because they have inventory sorting on so every time the inventory changes, it is re-evaluated
---
my strength is at 42
---
What are you running on your character?
---
A. its listed under camp items. its basically the whole alphabet using those type of letters. i think its 700 atoms.
---
Trading is funny like that too. 
---
Random stranger offers trade. Wants all my maps and 556/shotgun ammo. 
---
Refuses any thing i want. 
---
Get a psn msg that he needs his gear and doesnt have anything of balue to trade.. let alone his outfits.. riiiiiiiight
---
I just log out.. ghost them fools
---
I think this is unfortunately just *one* of several causes. Definitely looks like it somehow scrapped an armor piece here, but how are unscrappable legendary pieces disappearing?
---
full set of unyealding adrenaline reaction and some perks
---
gained a level, can not select scrapper again, nor any of the other cards that have gone missing.  reboot did not work either.  they are just GONE!!
---
thanx for the downvote.
---
What perks and what does adrenal reaction do
---
I am a huge CAD fan, and even I didn't read this from the image. It's a stretch.
---
BattleStation1 Here, lets start off going down your list of complaints, 
---
Q: extended toxic gameplay
---
A: its fallout 76, you can watch my over 950 hours of VODs vary vary rarely do i get toxic, and ontop of that i barely pvp or go into survival mode
---
Q: ganking and endless whining about my previous BOS Role Playing group
---
A: my previous BOS group bought every weapon and skin that they had so whining no. calling them out for the fakes that they were yes. they didnt grind the game they purchased everything so its a resemble complaint.
---
Q: bringing schen8 down.
---
A: i have spoken with my dear friend and fellow member of DreamTeam. he says he has no issue with my gameplay, or how we enter combat. schen8 is his own person with his own channel [Twitch.Tv/Schen8](https://Twitch.Tv/Schen8) and he can make his own decision; as a team we do team missions together, but sometimes we go off and do our own things. grinding the game out
---
Q: leaving team
---
A: what you witnessed was me leaving to find a new server, which members of DreamTeam do ALOT. and when we find a new stable server the rest of the team hops to that server.
---
Q: OP weapons and my ability to use said weapons
---
A: After discovering a new meta in survival mode, you would be a fool to not switch to it or you are gimping yourself. using the said tesla rifle is not an exploit however at the time of you viewing this. there were said exploits being used which my channel is strictly against. said exploits made you invulnerable to damage for a limited amount of time. so yes the target was using an exploit because i did infact kill his friend so it wasnt the damage bug.
---
Q: slap damage to low levels.
---
A: i have a policy on my channel not to attack low level players (i.e. players under level 50) because i feel that would be a detriment to the game and the community itself. us in DreamTeam try to support and grow low level characters so that they can enjoy the game as well and push a positive notion on Fallout76
---
my final notes, if your not happy with my content and vast knowledge of fallout 76, you can freely go view another channel. i provide the best content i can at an expense of my time and energy. i do this solely as a hobby and a passion for streaming and interacting with viewers,  however i am infront of a camera and streaming for 60+ hours a week and it shows i have a stable community of loving viewers, i have great friends one of which is schen8, and i have a strong viewer base. so again if you are unsatisfied with my content simply go view another channel and support them. dont come to reddit to complain about a streamer who you know nothing about.

Just going to offer one explanation to this. Just in the interests of fairness.
---
I have personally observed game areas failing to load on my client, but being there for others. At that point I could run clean through anything that wasn't on my screen. To other players it would have looked somewhat like your video.
---
Not saying they're innocent, but it's always important to consider the full picture.
---
Golf course is tried and true
---
Bounce between white spring and west tek. Clear both and if respawns are on cool down when you are done hop servers
---
Seeing it from a straight down POV, it reads way better. There is no way this is a coincidence and has to be intentional.
---
Thank you for that
---
Currently 48, but talking for a new character
---
Hell... I’m more afraid of a few high level cave crickets. Those things can tank shots and can be hard to hit with all their jumping around lol
---
Low levels included?
---
anytime
---
If you do mayor for a day quest in Watoga you can kill the robots with impunity for experience
---
Being in power armor strips any benefits you were getting from your standard armor
---
Your armor doesn't have any effect when you put on power armor.
---
I agree 100% with this. The deathclaw should be one of the most feared enemies, I farm them for free black titanium. They're not what they used to be anymore.
---
Damn that’s what I was thinking... I didn’t want it to be true 😭 How do I mod my power armors storage capacity?
---
Events are good. Nice way to get fast travel points. Uranium fever is good. Grab all the glowing meat and cook it after. If you can find some high level players to tag along with a tag enemies. Find a rad suit and tag stuff in nuke zones at whitesprings. Was able to help a buddy get 10 levels in a few hours today. Remember all the xp boosters like well rested, well tuned and consumables.
---
Once in power armor any perks from armor is no longer in play. If you want max carry in power armor get excavator with calibrated shocks.
---
Get excavator power armor.  You should already be working on it at your level
---
Mirelurk wasted my ass this weekend. They were tough before, did they buff it recently?
---
I ran into an Indian guy arguing with a girl about meeting her Dad on an open mic at watoga station. I was laughing so hard my dog ran out of the room.
---
I get the 'feeling' is more of a 'you have to hit it x times' rather than 'you have to deal x damage' from the way the health 'bounces back' with every hit/shot.
---
I have been close to this scenario before, luckily I no longer bring that toon to this particular event - the radiation 'clouds' make it a bit of a chore with low health melee toons - and none of my other toons (which are not 'bloodied') can one shot it.
---
If you can't easily write off the cost of a game you find you dont like, you can't afford to take anyone to court.
---
For armor mods, start with leather armor, craft light leather arms, scrap them. The process costs 1 steel. Keep doing it until you have every mod except the few you need to buy. Do the same thing with other armor. The cheapest cost is always arms. You don’t need to learn every one, just the ones you need. At this point I have about 80% of useful mods for every armor, expect metal. Metal is real stingy.
---
 \&gt;I've sacrificed performance to run shadowplay full time now.    
---
If shadowplay weighs you down its time to upgrade. But you must be on a potato because i notice mayb e aframe or two drop when using it and im using a ryzen2200g with gtx960 and 4gb ram, so pretty potato myself.
---
Hmm see that’s the thing lol today’s my second day of playing in over 5 months so I don’t remember everything I should be doing right now... I’ve honestly just been following the main story since getting back in
---
Cool thank you I will look into that!
---
Yeah, spawns are tied to the character that enters the area. My level 30 alt spawns level 20-something mutants at west tek and ghouls at WS. I get 62 charred ghouls at some of the non-clubhouse buildings in WS, but my level 30-something alt one shots those with a sneak attack 308 anyway so it works out
---
The Nukashine is worth it just for the gold helmet.
---
  
---
That said, I got both. Been waiting on these both with intent to grab them since they were datamined.
---
So far enjoying the Nukashine more, but were I to have something other than X-01, I'd go for the War Rider for sure.
---
Enjoying the War Rider for my Excavator set, nice having a new model entirely for when I'm being lazy and need the extra carry weight (which these days is way too often).
---
Considering the cost and effort for another suppressor golf club I wonder why anyone does it at all.
---
Dual drills.
---
Give it eye lazers, rocket launchers and double its speed. The reign of the mecha-deathclaw begins!
---
I didn't think wood could have more than one legendary effect.
---
I know I'm late here, stumbled across this post... You are right on point. This game was a raging dumpster fire when it was released, and it still ain't sitting pretty either. I love Fallout games for the slow exploration, sitting and sifting through terminals at my own pace, interacting with unique NPCs and questing. To be honest, when Fallout 76 was announced as an online game, I was already crushed, but gave it second thought and decided to give it a chance. I mean, who wouldn't want to roam the wastes with their best friends! So I bought it on launch day and went in with all my buddies. Went in hoping for an amazing Fallout experience, albeit a little faster paced than I like, but all I got was a bug riddled experience. This game has had A LOT of bad press, and I realize people do enjoy the game. That's fine and awesome, more power to you! But I think if Bethesda put together an offline single-player mode, with some NPCs and single player based quest lines, it could actually be awesome. I would fucking love to explore WV wastes with a few mods installed and some trusty console commands for exploring areas I shouldn't be exploring..... But, alas I am only dreaming. Instead, we get reality. A reality where as time goes on they slowly pump more and more into the in-game store and push micro transactions for things you had in previous games for free. I mean, hell, nothing I like more than dropping $60 for a game, then having to shell out MORE cash to unlock the items WITHIN the game.
---
I can't make up mind, what are peoples favourite if you had to choose 1
---
You're right. Her Deathclaw Surprise is always fresh and pretty tasty. And I'm glad she helped with yo' tractor. It's what neighbours are for. But if any Wastelander or Settler sets up a Beauty Saloon,then I'm throwing her over the back of a Brahmin and getting her there by any means necessary.
---
The let’s cook emote is a frying pan and steak,  and it’s completely different from the gift.
---
*Uses a Stimpack*
---
Great points here!
---
You are factually incorrect ;)
---
Supposidly the more stars your trade is the better the "pay" in return. I hope that true also because I've been painstakingly saving my crappy 3* items that i don't use
---
I hunt down every one. What else is there to do besides kill the level 10 supermutants that keep spawning?
---
Fog. Crawlers.
---
They didn’t seem very devastating at the end of fallout 3, fighting super mutant overlords. I think you’re more invested in being right than using missiles in this game. It’s more work than in previous fallouts. 
---
My only complaint is now that Vats isn’t slow they miss things way more often. But I just found the homing sight last night so we’ll see if that helps.
---
Join a guild/Discord group of like minded players. 
---
Help out the lower level players.
---
I’d like to see more avenues for getting player made legendaries. I don’t think it should be an easy task but crafting them could be a chain of quests or task / events that eventually results in you building your dream item
---
God dang it I see it.
---
I'm starting to feel like LOSS is this generations The Game.
---
Even worse when your doing a event.
---
Why would you want to get the disease?  Is there a challenge for it?
---
I nearly grabbed a bobbypin on the mat at the gym the other day...
---
I am not sure what you are getting at? If the weight in game is using kilograms then my legendary 5.56 doesn't weigh 22 lbs. It weighs 48 lbs which is even more crazy than 22 lbs. But considering this is the worst written fallout ever what would I expect. I just keep playing hoping they will put someone with a brain in charge and possibly fix this mess.
---
48 lbs is 21.79 kg
---
He's a stalker and gets killed on sight.
---
Any energy weapon ash or goo kill will do tgis which helps with makibg even more plasma cores.
---
Nope because they may tarnish our fallout. And they may be pay to win with blades, but they can never take out skyrim. FOR THE NORDS!
---
Steer clear of the okay hand sign though.
---
That's just plain freaky mate.
---
¯\_(O_o)_/¯
---
How did they kill you? Pvp generally takes a response to trigger.
---
The first time was from my turrets then everywhere they went they kept showing up as enemies and were able to kill me and idk y
---
You lie.
---
You can scrap unscrappable things with this
---
Are you on PS4? Is there a way I can send you a $5 credit for the store? I just bought the bar set, and it looks fantastic. If that’s what you need to complete, I’m all for helping out.
---
Or repair vertibot helipad at grafton steel workshop.
---
If i didn't buy every nonsense i like, i would have over 13k atoms. Never spend penny. Is that foced bussiness? I don't think so.
---
it really messes with the frame rates and throws bodys all over the place making it hard to loot them
---
Ive lost so many of the imposter cards due do it
---
—-closed—
---
They were able to kill you because you owned workshops. When you claim a workshop it opens you to pvp for as long as you own the workshop and it doesn't matter where you are on the map
---
Unfortunately, you can't build both the keg and the punch bowl, as they seem to be linked items and there is a build restriction on it.
---
You changing your behavior is letting him win.
---
I have had this error for 3+ months. Doesn't matter restarting the game/launcher or reinstalling. I literally cannot add a friend no matter what. 
---
This sucks
---
I want to put the Hard Lemonade in it, but I have the sneaking suspicion that it will just look like a bowl of piss.
---
There's a reason I have 2 Two Shot Fatmans, with the Grenadier perk equiped it'll be like I have the power of an actual nuke.
---
It does work. Hip fire accuracy is the only thing effected by this
---
The easiest thing would be for people to buy it on  [https://bethesda.net/en/account/fallout76/shop](https://bethesda.net/en/account/fallout76/shop) (which isn't a real page, *yet*!)
---
I've downed 12-15 queens this week and it's fine. One I did show up late but didnt do enough dmg to get loot.
---
&gt; people posting to make a trade will be told by automod to go to one of the trading subreddits. 
---
What's it going to say "Use Google to find somewhere else to talk about that!"? Yeah, couldn't be convenient and just have a bot post links to a few subreddits.
---
Nearly got killed by a dusky Yao guai last night, it's staggering attacks were relentless and I couldn't get a shot off. Lucky I had my jet pack on and managed to break away with a vertical escape, but not before dropping a mirv frag. 
---
The grenade only took off something like 30% health, but gave me chance to hit it with a few chained critical hits from my combat shotgun.
---
This brought the animal down to below 50 percent bit it quickly regenerated to full health due to its legendary ability. It then promptly began again with it's smashing attack, which made short work of My lvl50 T51 armour
---
I managed to find an elevated position and once again  fly to safety. This gave me the chance to heal and use a psycho. I pulled out my TSE handmade, and began to spray down with automatic fire. This was more effective than my shotgun but still it managed to survive and flee into the woods.
---
I decided to jump down and pursue as I wanted that legendary. It was at only around 25 percent now so  i pulled out the shotgun again and sprinted after it. It's amazing how far away it got in that short time, by the time I'd sprinted up to it id drained all my AP and it decided to turn round and fight me again!
---
With no AP now I had to fight it without my critical, which is a big part of my build. We took turns exchanging blows until the bear decided to chain 6! Of it's staggering blows preventing me from attacking. I was down to maybe 10 percent, spammed the stim button and used the mirv and jetpack technique once again.
---
Finally I'd won, and the 1 star forgettable useless armour price was all mine!
---
This was 1 yao guai though an I'm a level 150 now, deathclaw is nothing compared to these things.
---
Going through the Enclave's files convinced him that the BoS are completely correct about the dangers of technology. He took his inclination for engineering and started learning everything he could about power armor. Self promoted to Knight Sergeant, he's ready for the return of the BoS.
---
This is absolutely not true at all. Every creature in the game you only have to tag them. However scorchbeasts do act strangely with explosives.
---
Nice, ty.
---
I'm fine with Deathclaws not being the top of the food chain. Stuff like Mirelurk Queens, Scorchbeasts, Behemoths, Fog Crawlers, Sheepsquatch, &amp; Sentry Bots should be tougher than them. Nothing else though should really compare unless they are attacking as a horde.
---
There was a suggestion before of having it be a search circle around each of the top players, so you could see where they kinda where but not exact.   What if we went even further, and basically show each player, the size of the circle could be based on how long they have been alive, and the accuracy based on the number of kills.  Or some other metric of the same idea
---
Most over used word on this subreddit.  Griefers! oMG gO bAcK tO yOur pVP sErVerS
---
Uh, and which sub is that?
---
Oh boy
---
The fun ones collecting 250 pieces of wood it's bad enough that the perk won't work but you actually have to click on 250 logs doesn't it matter how many it gives you each time
---
There's a new effect that was added into the game last patch on some enemies that have mounts that is not in effect yet called unlock taxidermy recipe script
---
I tried both. The stealth commando approach seems much stronger. For behemoths, death laws, and mirelurk queens being able to unload half a mag of sneak attack crits is awesome.
---
When its actually griefing ya they make a good game bad and if their is a server for it y wouldnt u go play it
---
Just hit it for the 20th time just now.   No squatches, just mirelurks, muties and anglers.  Swimming in adhesive 👍🏼
---
I had seen someone post it elsewhere. I can't answer that but he did demonstrate it is underarmor, to be worn underneath. So no, it isn't going to strip off all your armor pieces but it isn't going to cover it up either.
---
\^ this. I understand (though am infuriated by) some of the restrictions, but at least give us a clue!
---
It wouldnt be cool if you have fo4 in steam and fo76 in bethlauncher
---
Because the map doesn't display "Player X has a Bloodied Thingamabob for Y Caps for sale!"
---
You can run around for hours without seeing another player. Then when you do, IF they want to open a trade window with you, &gt;99% of people will have garbage because &gt;&gt;99% of the drops in the game are crap.
---
The odds that a random player you just happen to come across will have something you need and is difficult to obtain and they're willing to part with it for something you have are ridiculously astronomical. Using communication outside game brings that down considerably.
---
YES! It is a nightmare when there are brown bags everywhere and I can't remember which ones is mine. People are still going to take your stuff if they really want to but it definitely takes the guesswork out of it
---
I think I put High Voltage Hefe in mine. 😆
---
Also make sure you are not well fed and well hydrated as both give 25% disease resist
---
And nuke alerts should come after 2:30 minutes
---
It's a reward from a weekly. I'm expecting it next week since the punch bowl was released this week
---
2 months later...
---
Dude I haven't even in played in 2 months lmao
---
CBS checking whether it's fixed for me
---
You have the keg?
---
Also it drops every mod plan for every power armor except ultracite and x01
---
They should make other fissure sites nukeable with 3 star bosses. The one near the pumpkin house could spawn a deathclaw king
---
Nope! This game is fine. Love it. Love Skyrim too, both good the way they are.
---
That one was confirmed awhile back.   I had to google it at the time.
---
Nope. If it's a small one they probably want it cleared as it's for such minor things. Bigger bounties I treat with caution. 
---
I found a pair who were not in a team but working together; one was destroying the other's camp and racking up a huge bounty. The catch was if a bounty hunter shot and missed they would risk getting a bounty and the other player would likely attack, kill them and claim the caps and junk. Luckily I'm patient and a good shot so the one with the bounty was taken out and they disappeared to try it on another sever.
---
You can go over 30. I think my unyielding has anout 34 str.
---
Deathclaws were never at the top. What made them interesting was how they were always aware of you and could stalk you for quite some distance waiting for their time to strike.
---
I will now
---
It was the 1st thing I checked to see if I could put in it :) i put 6 nukashines in and 4 random drinks!
---
I'm finding the " intersects with an existing object" particularly annoying as a lot of the "objects" are massive things which make up the terrain (the large rocks on and around cliff edges for example) so what looks like a nice spot with loads of relatively flat areas to build on ends up being a migraine inducing nightmare to try to do anything practical with. I've intentionally kept my camp modular and my blueprints are all 1x1 or 2x1 at most with the stairs removed, but I still end up tearing my hair out.
---
(Can you tell I spent about an hour last night trying to move my camp and I've still only done about half of it?)
---
I felt they never ever were the APEX in all fallout games since F3.  
---
They are tough and hard hitting creatures, but that's it, some creatures had gimmicks that made them way more dangerous than Deathclaw :  
---
Radscorpions, Cazador (sweet Jesus i don't miss those), Mirelurk Queens, Assaultrons etc..
---
better question is, why are they adding skins to the stations already, while the quest is still so bugged that i cant even unlock the brewing station...
---
So basically beggars?
---
Survival servers are for masochistic casual players to donate their supplies to others.
---
Which is totally irrelevant here since we're speaking about pve.
---
Inside building you can't always stay at range. Mobs will aggro you. They will spawn in your back. They will frenzy your face out. 
---
Playing a shotgun build I swear to you that whenever going to the golf club, I got swarmed. 
---
Sure, as long as you're sneaked outside taking mobs one by one you are fine. You can't do all the game that way.
---
...don't they do ballistic damage? I've not seen a mister gutsy with a laser weapon.
---
I don't know how to join the game of some random on PS4,  it's easy to join a friend but how do you do it for someone who isn't a friend?
---
I didnt own it anymore tho
---
What a crappy wep, but thank you for screenshot :)
---
Was playing with my buddy today when he came up to me. He gave me a hunting rifle to which I replied in Discord that it was the first time he ever gave me a weapon as I was running off.
---
My buddy replied in the most deadpan voice "Huh... he only gave me two lead." The Wasteland is a hardcore place, lol
---
There's the new "I have a gift" emote,
---
Some people like having limited edition outfits :D
---
I myself dont have the camera so didn't try, wanted to know if anyone did.
---
Saw the truck 2 weeks ago i think, too bad it doesnt count tho :/
---
I think yes
---
&gt; PVP at workshops is part of the game.
---
&gt; *at* workshops
---
That's one thing that needs to be fixed. This guy was attacked outside of his workshops.
---
It needs to be fixed so you can only fight within the workshop's boundaries. If the owner doesn't show up to contest, they lose the shop.
---
This keeps the cap farmers at bay. They'll huff and puff, but oh well.  
---
Ever upwards.
---
I have always loved a mode with character deletion upon death 
---
If your gunna make scrap ammo etc super rare you should counter it in someway in the perk system like every 5 lvls instead of 1 point you get 2 just as a node to surviving to 5 special if you wanna make lvling harder too 
---
Another thing to add would be weapon limit to 3 and a heavy would count as 2 power armour would increase limit to 4 in your person
---
Nice, thanks for the test! Did the AA launcher forced the bat land? It does have quite a lot DR and also I can't seem to be landing shots ADS on it in air... That's really the only weakness of my HW build; still trying to find a reliable heavy weapon that will make it land. Enforcing shotguns do work very well, but there must be something else - maybe this AA laucnher, or AA lmg...
---
I've done this only about 4 times now. 1st 2 times I got no reward, and on one no loot on queen, even though I definitely did some damage to her.
---
Last two times I got quest rewards plus loot.
---
May be glitchy though. Last couple times I did this it wasnt pleasant experience. One event I got stuck with the eternal machine gun noise, which made things extremely annoying. Second time was very laggy and felt like I was going to lag out any second.
---
This is what I talking bout.. its like when hot lass shows up at a club and there is next gal is wearing the same dress,  we all want to be unique don't we?
---
Didn't think it would have one. I was pleasantly surprised! :D
---
Banning the sub from even being mentioned here seems to be more harmful to the fo76 community at large than it is to the owner of the sub. Ban his personal account, sure, but it seems a bit petty and personal to use his actions as justification for hamstringing the ability of the community to trade.
---
Or anyone...
---
I'll probably get downvoted but I think the whole point is the elusiveness... just a thought.
---
It's the English way.
---
forced to spend... I love it!! \*drinks tears in glass\*
---
Same for Biv.
---
Strange, I haven't heard of this...  
---
I imagine you've already tried the basic troubleshooting methods?
---
No, neither launcher forced it to land, but I also didn’t kill it. I’m guessing you have to cripple their wing or something, but I don’t know much about them.
---
I think the difference between DC's and the YG's is that DC's have armour and most players have Armour defeating effects (And teh belly is unarmoured I understand), and that with an "Average" amount of health means they go down easily.
---
YG's on the other hand I think is pretty much just massive amounts health, no armour.
---
I say this because Blade of Bassett + Incisor (50% +75% Anti-Armour) does more damage to a DC's health bar than a YG's
---
Plasma... I think? Now I'm not sure!
---
yes, that's how it work; it's just quite difficult with no vats build
---
Wish I know. I'd probably wear it to be honest. Check on RedBubble they seem to have good designs.
---
&gt; Is everyone just ok with the fact that the price of the horsemen set is $56 dollars.
---
Yow, you are dedicated to doing challenges.
---
30 hours in, never knew about it and always avoided dark rooms because of it... Fuck me xD
---
I think you actually would have to search really hard to find this game for 60 bucks. Last time I saw they sold the game for Xbox for 30 bucks and they gave you a free controller that usually costs 40...
---
idk about 4 there man. They're scarier in presentation but it gets pretty easy pretty fast to take one on unless you're on survival or the harder difficulties.
---
That being said that first one in Concord is insanely terrifying considering how low the player tends to be when they first get there.
---
&gt; Clap clap for the downsydrome developers
---
Seeing how you are, I'm glad the game made you cry, lol. 
---
I'll jerk to your tears.
---
Erectin’ a vending machine. (Soon)
---
Fallout:Shelter.
---
All my Overseer's log holos are showing as unheard and I can't get them off my inventory to try this situation. Anyone know how I can dump overseers holotapes?
---
Because Darwinism hasn't had enough time to fully take effect. The Deathclaw is the ultimate apex predator. That's why it's still around 200+ years later.
---
It's for making soup.
---
Thanks for your input everyone!
---
No, but if you try to build it  when you have the punch bowl, it says Built: 1/1
---
They're rare but I've come across a scorched ghoul reaver. Thought it might have been a glitch but it looked different to normal ones.
---
I have but only recently when I was online last night. It was fine after I left completely and signed back in again but it still lagged a bit. Nowhere near as bad as before which affected the audio and was unplayable. Never had such a problem like that before.
---
First Nurgle armor, then Khorne armor, what next Slaanesh and Tzeentzh? Also, when do we get from Emperor's side and especially Inquisition?
---
&gt; free 1,2, and 3 star legendaries for almost no work.
---
​Almost no work?  I killed a Legendary Noxious squatch near fissure prime and it took ages.
---
You're obviously better at this than me,
---
War Rider sucks. Looks like a bunch of garbage slapped onto a T45.
---
Seriously one of the shittiest skins they’ve done.
---
I find it hilarious how many nerds think its cool.
---
Yeah it's getting really bad. I saw something that mentioned a big friends list which I have because all the trading. Might have to delete a bunch of people and hope it helps lol
---
Do you have lots of friends ? I have not played since burrows update. Delete friends down too about 100-150. I have been too lazy to do it since bugtesda does not care.
---
Should be a lot of posts about the subject
---
Yeah I have quite a lot of friends but most I haven't seen in months. I may whittle it down and remove the random ones I never see.
---
Yeah I'll try cleaning out my friend list see if it helps.
---
It's a virtual video game. People like you take this all way too seriously.
---
Looks silly to me, like some scrapped World of Warcraft  equip set.
---
im hoping it would happen with the steam release, plus i hope its on the same servers as the bethesda.net users
---
That’s just the way she rolls, I did the same with the lever and handmade lol and now I’m tryna get the mods for the submachine gun
---
I'm in Europe nad they work fine for me. Maybe I am lucky, because in 200+ hours I haven't been disconnected more than 10-15 times
---
Deathclaws are not APEX because they are the most deadly thing in the wasteland, they are APEX because even teh dumb ones can outsmart a human.  
---
Other creatures feed more on each other, deathclaws go after the creature with guns and tend to win.
---
If it’s underarmor then the helmet would be separate, hopefully someone will clear it up. Cool it’s underarmor rather than an outfit, didn’t expect that.
---
Yeah, there's a challenge for getting every disease. 22 total, IIRC.
---
Talos is proud of you son
---
I hope the T51 Northern Lights &amp; Blackbird paints never come back to the Atom Shop, those two are the ones I use the most.
---
Then again, I’ve bought almost every PA paint anyway, except a few I think are lame, so my PA armor has a lot of options.
---
They do, it's just hard to tell. I had to do a double take, lol.
---
Zoom in on the second picture.
---
Player vending machines. They were featured pretty clearly in the Wild Appalachia trailer.
---
The game needs more mods in general there are a lot of weapons that have very few mods. For example the .50cal only has one one barrel and one receiver. That being the prime. Doesn’t even have a standard receiver to go back to if you prime it. What a joke.
---
Just go all urban with one piece of forest, doesn't stand out *too* much.
---
Finally got all polymer deep pocketed last night, at last I could take my leather armor off.  (With a little sad tear for the Energy resistance).
---
I love it when karma comes around.
---
And no legendary.   I hope something can be done with the legendary vendor, but maybe scout armor is just made to break our hearts.
---
Sounds a bit like Day Z
---
They can have both ballistic and laser weapons. I think laser gutsys are much easier because they seem to miss more often and energy resistance is easier to get due to the grounded mutation.
---
We are hold down the trigger and looking at the ammo count... aaand it's gone.
---
”COMMUNISM IS A LIE”
---
Nothing wrong with it. Not everything needs to be handed to you on a silver plate. Would be really boring game (more than it already is) if all these "need to be fixed/changed" post would come true. Rng is Rng.
---
That is how the sloth do
---
Fantastic
---
Needs a sight too, and the gatling gun sight needs a rework, it's lopsided lol
---
I'm just hoping for a silencer...
---
If you already bought the recipe. It's already learned and appears as a paint job on the respective pieces when you mod them
---
So manny guns are just so underwhelming in the mod department. While the pipe rifle has more mods than any one knows what to do with.
---
I have posted this about a week ago with video evidence too, i have raised a ticket with bethesda and sent them video of it happening and have had a few responses from them
---
Yet, we outgrow it at a wonderful speed. (Also, went back to fo4 the other day, pipe rifle drum held almost 50 rounds, in fo76, adds I believe 4-6 above the standard??)
---
I posted this about a week ago but people didnt really care much, also had video evidence
---
This is game changing. Excuse me while I go and break all my high tier guns that I have stashed away waiting to be sold
---
Holy shit you are a life saver thanks for the tip.
---
Do you mean fascists?  I don't know what "facist's" (sic) are.
---
If you do, then be advised that the Brotherhood are wanabees.  Check my flair if you want to feel the *real* smack of firm government.
---
I don't think that's the case because I remember that in Fallout Shelter first you encountered Pestilence then Famine
---
How good would shelter integration be you play the game and wandering dwellers can deliver items to you in game!!
---
And letting you FT while offline
---
&gt; Rewards should be guaranteed
---
You're playing the wrong game.
---
There are two different Blueprints. When you move your camp you get your base packed up for free into seperated blueprints all items are stored with this.
---
The other one is just a preset save manager so you can build your camp designs faster from scratch without placing everything from hand again.
---
Would be perfect for an auction house.
---
I've had this occur to me several times on a servers with low ping. I don't think this is what's going on.   
---
In update 7 Bethesda worked on how when players entered a cell of the map if a player had killed a mob it would remove the corpse and respawn the mob.   
---
Ever since that patch this has been a major issue for me. I feel like they tried to fix the issue but haven't quite got there so we're just experiencing it differently than how it was before.
---
You can use the ProSnap Deluxe ® camera to find the body.  Alternatively fast travel and a wrecked robot corpse should appear.
---
Why does my autocorrect keep taking the s out of facist?
---
And somehow sorted differently.
---
What the fuck.
---
I think you should have to find the weapon with the mods attached. Then when you scrap it, you learn whatever mods were on it.
---
I have heard that you can just build and scrap leather arms over and over and eventually you learn the mods for the legs and chest pieces too which seems counter intuitive
---
Same with armor?
---
It's a challenge, maybe also an achievement (on PS4).
---
In Patch 7 notes: 
---
* **Respawn:** Approaching the corpse of an enemy that was killed at long distance no longer occasionally causes the corpse to disappear and the enemy to immediately respawn.  
---
Could it be that their "fix" is still broken and we're just experiencing it differently now?
---
I thought it was spelled "Sematary"?
---
We care man it’s just nothing new.
---
Everyone knows this problem exists. 
---
There is something seriously wrong with the client if this is possible and that means devs are reluctant to deal with this.
---
That sucks! Really is random though. Got all the mods I wanted for it in 12 scraps. Maybe, in the meantime, just ask someone to mod it for you? I would think most people would do it for free, although it's a legendary, got to be careful about that.
---
'Cos your phone is made by Nazis?
---
no no I meant the actually legendary armour piece that I put it on, I' guessing you can't craft that
---
It’s apple.... sooo.... you’re probably right?
---
i think for a good carry weight setup that motion asisst servos and calibrated shocks give u max benefit
---
Actual PC keybinding for all actions.
---
This game is played on PC too, so why can't we get actual PC minimum requirements for a game in this century.
---
I don't use US keyboard as I don't live in USA and have actual keyboard of my own country. Quickbinds 1-0 work fine from my MMO mouse (Logitech G600 it has 12 thumb buttons to use), but then the eleventh and twelfth keybinds are wrong. Number 11 activates number 12 and number 12 does nothing.
---
Yes I can macro them to correct ones through the mouse editor, but why is this not changeable from the games menu.
---
So we learn that Californians can't spell for shit.  Colour me surprised.
---
BRÖTHER
---
Boo.  What I want would be a a way of applying legendary mods to my Scout Armor.
---
Hahaha love it. I had a lv 70 sumthing try that with me today at uranium fever (im 180) he spawns in so i wave and switch to a tesla to not 1 shot everything, he runs straight up to me and starts hitting me over and over again, i emote help then ignore him and continue tagging enemies and leaving them for him to get a tag then killing them, and he STILL keeps tryna fight me, so im like alrite then mate u wana be that guy, i one shot the next 2 legendaries, and emote a heart, had a good lil chuckle to myself when he emoted the angry face.
---
Not trying to be condescending here but you are dealing with decent odds with the Handmade (or all weapons except the Radium Rifle for that matter).
---
This is no 'well guarded secret' or anything, the odds to 'unlock' a mod when scrapping and the INT curve that boosts the odds are exposed in the esm.
---
A cursory look should tell you that you are dealing with values between 10% and 20% with an INT curve bonus that peaks at x1.36 (although the difference between 20 and 25 is 0.04% so hardly worth it) which is fairly decent.
---
Compare that to the Radium Rifle (I know, this is a logical fallacy of sorts but please indulge me on this one) with 0.45% or armor with 0.6% (talking from memory here but I won't be far off) and 'count your blessings'.
---
being left handed I would like to see this also.
---
And if your not even going to give a end result why even bother posting?
---
The map size and the level of detail and variation in the world
---
Probably your controller, lb broke on my Xbox controller while I was playing rainbow 6 siege and I threw all of my grenades without pressing anything
---
But what if things are OK?
---
👌

I love the new map. Hard for me to go back to FO4 pip boy map. 
---
Mutations are required I can’t even play without marsupial feels terrible idk how I even played F04 without it. 
---
The camp system is my favorite part building a house anywhere I think is cool gives me hrs and hrs of enjoyment and collecting all the new and cool camp items gives me something to keep playing for. 
---
The new vats feels so smooth. Stopping time always took me out of the game felt too god mode this new version feels right and keeps the action going without feeling clunky or too strong. 
---
I also really enjoy the online multiplayer. Seeing other people in game and doing group events is really fun to me even if some prefer solo the multiplayer aspect of this game I enjoy. However I don’t like PvP in its current state and think it needs to be reworked so both PvP players and solo players can enjoy the game how they want.
---
You sure about that? I had a broken auto grenade launcher and it still weighed 18 in my inventory
---
I was thinking that because back when the Nintendo DS was a thing I broke my l and r buttons and it made it un playable
---
I don't want it to be patched if it's a bug but if you message me I will tell you
---
Yeah I can’t play with that controller now
---
No you can't
---
I’ve never had a problem where it is the games fault for random buttons being pressed, it is most likely the controller
---
That’s pretty cool.
---
For now it's not bad, but I have a separate controller if need be
---
Capitalism for ya... everything breaks eventually
---
Um.. 1-hit kill enemies?
---
true apex predator is monotony, rarely seen before level 60, later barely manageable, even in groups.
---
The vendor in the military wing sells a missile silo status tape that will tell you if a silo is in cool down. Combined with checking the map to check if anyone is in the silo. If there is no one in it and it is not in cool down then it should be good to go.
---
He is in Weapons tab though, which shouldn't make selection of armor possible
---
yeah, wooden armor with vault suit looks good af
---
Guerilla Santa.
---
Anti armor gamma gun seems to do the trick
---
For me the survival aspects in 76 improve from fallout 4. Eating cooked food still gives rads. Collecting wood, (needing wood to cook) scraping components down to raw resources. Disease and disease cures, weapon degradation....all of this I would love to have in fallout 4. I understand fallout 4 has its own survival mode I just feel like the the core survival mechanics in fallout 76 flow better while playing the game. Creating ammo at a tinker bench, having a tinker bench, the ability to create a camp at any spot on the map.....I would love a fallout 4 remaster with the fallout 76 game mechanics
---
So... the elusive 3* squatch does exist.
---
Try colonel kelly monument I got mine there
---
Have you got the plans for the Handmade? I built my own and scrapped them and got the Suppressor within - max 20 models scrapped. If you are on PC I can make you a fully tricked out one for free no worries :)
---
Excavator weightload by any chance?
---
Does this include any the devastatingly deadly... house cat
---
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ...... NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Can you imagine all the little fucktards running about shouting FUS ROH DAHHHHHHHH down the mic or the try hards swinging their sword/axes like demented idiots swatting a bloat fly. Nah keep it single player thanks :)
---
Fridaaa!
---
Death Law???? Is that like the mother-in-law from hell? Just asking...FOR SCIENCE! ;)
---
You are not the hero of the story that joins every faction to be their leader and fuck up every other faction in return, because why not. You are a little peasant that has finished studying something and is very smart in some sort of thing that he can't really use in the REAL world anymore. You are so tiny as a person you -"almost"- can't even go alone to the toilet because it's infested with some alien cryptids that hunt you down for their food.
---
If you are really bad with coordination you get lost in this world and you end up in even more dangerous areas where the air alone can deep fry you in seconds, without PROPER PREPERATION. I wrote this in Caps because if you dont prepare for this world you basically wasting your rest amount of ammo on something you cant kill alone and need to repeat everything again.
---
It feels like to me, at least the damage output when shoot to the ground instead hit the enemy directly is much higher.
---
But as i said, it feels like that to me and i could be totally wrong
---
If this actually works for my shash....im breaking everything today
---
Wut?
---
TIL how to free 500lbs of stash space.
---
Yeah I can only play Fallout 4 in Survival, I need those extra restrictions and higher difficulty to make the game interesting.
---
Not having fast travel forces you to explore and find all those little details in between locations, and to memorise where all the beds and safe places are. You don’t get that experience when you can teleport around whenever.
---
(It does lead to a lot of tedious walking though, if they put Vault 111 in the centre of the map)
---
Still haven't worked out how to actually use this gun, I've taken it out twice and got very poor results from my Quad Tesla
---
Killed Maxson for that coat. It was worth it
---
Mole Rat, because not many in Fallout universe have seen Deathclaw, but one could find Mole Rat in any city or village.
---
Also Baby deathclaws are super cute
---
Yeah, I'd like confirmation on this.
---
&gt;This is no 'well guarded secret' or anything, the odds to 'unlock' a mod when scrapping and the INT curve that boosts the odds are exposed in the esm.
---
Could you explain this (or link) further please? Specifically the gain from high INT (15+)
---
Those precious screws though!!
---
I haven’t gotten any worth while drops from that event(a 1 Star mutants wood left leg, I swear every time lol), and 2 times it’s body disappeared I’ve gotten better drops in uranium lol. But at least there’s people getting sweet things 😌 I wouldn’t mind having s legendary drill 😂
---
Ah the tents were something I hunted then upon trying to place it finding it was essential to build a base to put it on to avoid it floating upset me. We need more prefabs that are survival themed. I don't want a fort. I want a ruin that I've converted into shelter with the scrap. Bits of loose concrete/rock objects that can clip a bit. Tarps and tents, loose wooden boards or ground sheets to put stuff on. Also WHERE THE HELL IS THE LANTERN SCHEMATIC I NEED IT. I DON'T WANT ELECTRIC LIGHTS.
---
Me to!
---
Im finding it a bit difficult to believe.
---
So you say it's not legendary, yet. So why are you expecting it to be legendary?
---
If it reads "legendary", then you are saying some other script making it "a fully legendary", hasn't run yet? I mean why would it first be created as "legendary", by name, then some other script makes it "fully legendary". I don't see why it would work like that.
---
There is a lake by a small mini amuesment park down by welch near the high rise mansions full of mirelurks as well.
---
&gt;Braxton Quality medical supplies
---
I did it 10 times to got 2 squatch so not that good. He drop mostly bones and one legendary... plans only from the event
---
Aim for their thrusters in Vats, you will start dropping them in only a couple hits.
---
I noticed that too
---
Id say quite probably. The stuff already exists, in some form.
---
I just spam it
---
How do I stop getting notifications that stuff like this is trending? It’s of absolute no interest to me.
---
My camp is one 2x2, one 1x2 units and a 1x1 all ground floor and individually blueprinted, I can move them anywhere with not issues, you must have a camp with a larger floor area, build small move often.
---
It’s kinda useless being under armor though since you aren’t gonna be running around with just that on.
---
ive seen insult bot about twice, graham about twice, and that bot at least 5.
---
Pretty much every weapon is good depending on your build. For example the video of the guy owning max level ghouls with the drill posted the other day
---
You would be better off asking for the worst weapons
---
My favorite in my anti armor combat shotgun. My most used by far
---
Nukacrypt.
---
Yes, my first line did say it's relative to your build, however the point of the discussion is really to explore people's favourites. Be good to know your favourite weapon..do you have one?
---
Yep - I have three different builds and I have specific weapons that are perfect for each of them, but they'd be terrible with the other characters.
---
Three star Bloodied combat knife. Don't need any other weapons. Just stealth.
---
Well I mean, Mirelurk queens are just, y’know, huge af. And assaultrons... I don’t really think we can count those in with the other creatures.
---
Wait there are Behemoths in 76?
---
Yup! Thank you!
---
Sure but you have to give me a few hours.
---
I am at work and I haven't looked at this for moths, it's been a while since I unlocked all mods for weapons/armor.
---
Ok now we need to how to break legenderies fast?
---
\^This.
---
gta has legendaries.
---
I have two accounts, three PvP characters, 6 mule characters to store my stuff, all interesting armor sets in game, representants of every possible weapon archetype - godroll level, and am generally speaking imprevious to danger.
---
Besides the Gutsy's god shredding ammo, wasteland is a safe place for me.
---
Appreciate players who name the weapons they use and prefer, gives new players information and helps - ty👍
---
I'm waiting a confirmation. This seems like a month late april joke.
---
Yeah, I was just about to say this, outside of the SBQ, imposter, and maybe Mirelurk queens, most of the rest don't even live long enough to clear the gap between me and them. Shotguns are brokenly OP and it seems no one even realizes how broken they are on VATS crit builds when every single pellet crits and has a chance of filling your crit meter to where I almost always have crits ready at all times.
---
Me too, just made a shed load of basic handmades and scraped them getting the suppressed mod after about 15 scraps.
---
Farm more!
---
mules
---
Did it work?
---
Never understood the issue with screws - my main character has 320 loose screws. If ya want some and you're on PC I can give you some - no worries :)
---
Isn't the glowing legendary wendigo that spawns in the golf course at the whiesprings higher than 42?
---
im just too lazy to get the crops you need to craft it before they spoil, got my friend to put the crafting stations there lol
---
Sure currently I love my instigating Gatling gun it can one shot max level ghouls. And 2 to 3 shot nearly everything else.  I also have a 2 shot 50cal that does 10% more damage when you aim that just sheds all the big stuff like level 80 scorch beasts
---
In my last character I had a anti armor, faster swing rocketed super sledge that ruined everything
---
The only thing I learbed from this is do not scrap a lot of weapons quickly.
---
The vid quality is shite. I'm going to create a youtube acount and post a better quality vid after work
---
good grief
---
Huh, I don't think I've come across one with a laser that I can remember. It's the ballistic damage I know all too well, as it tears through my X01 like butter.
---
All my friends have quitted a long time ago and not comfortable giving strangers my stuff to hold.
---
Google
---
The deseases and mutations are a welcome change to the survival mechanics.
---
Also without NPC's I don't have to worry about how boiled down and rail roading  / pointless NPC interaction became in 4.
---
I'd rate it the second worst fallout I've played, with 4 as the worst. So it's doing something right. Definitely more enjoyable than 4.
---
Amusingly I guess by giving me a game that let's me create my own little objectives, it has more agency than 4 ever had. Go figure.
---
My main has 225(ish) after being given 300 by my Alt a while back. 
---
Doesn’t mean that I have enough to be able to lose 150 from building and breaking 10 Handmades to get mods.
---
New set of animations for movement. Now you can move freely when using melee.
---
How about dual QUAD ammo capacity flamers, you know, so they have the effect of a single normal weapon?  
---
Me, bitter? No, don't know what you mean....
---
There a chance for the Sheepsquatch to spawn at any random encounter spot that spawns enemies. I'm not sure if one will spawn in the forest; I did find a nest once but no squatch.
---
I will start some trial and error work to recreate this glitch tonight. My entire excavator set was modded. My first test will be with unmodded PA. I will do this a bunch of times. Then I'll try with 1 calibrated shock, then 2. Then I'll add modded pieces one by one and try different combos. 
---
I'm also going to do some test scrapping a lot of weapons slowly to see if it's the quantity scrapped or the speed.
---
When those bastards could one shot (maybe 2
---
Shot) you it was terrifying
---
*AAE rifle goes sizzle sizzle sizzle and you're dead in 0.5s*
---
They improved them but laser weapons in general are still weak weapons.
---
Dual wield single actions? Think of all the drinks we could make while reloading!
---
MAYpril Fools!
---
Game colors are prettier than real life colors.
---
I suspect they'll eventually reintroduce the limited time items.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/ says that it's not solved yet, so probably not. (atleast not someone that is actually willing to share it, lol)
---
I could never play New Vegas without Gun Runners arsenal. Such a small add on but so impactful to my customisation and what tools I carried.
---
Love those guys.
---
Live dangerous like - plenty more screws to be had amigo, no worries :)
---
IMO worst explained item in the game. I lost armor the same way when I was making a trade I assumed from the message that the paint would be destroyed which makes sense since I bought the paint. Nope, the whole thing was destroyed.  What the message should say is the whole thing destroys not just the paint mod 
---
I then tries using a straight up trade instead of a doggy bag. Can't even see the item to trade which is at least better then losing it on a drop. Went to my bench and removed the paint and all good.
---
Anyway, I get why they won't allow one player to paint everyonea stuff on the server but the message you receive could be worded better.
---
No, disappointingly they just let all that cool, clear, radioactive water fall right out of the sky on to your nice, filthy mattress :/  
---
I've even started building my tents under wooden shelters, the rain annoyed me so much... which is just weird :)
---
You could have literally found it by typing "nuke code" on google lol
---
Rhymes with . . . ?
---
*Elevator infant Larry bait*?
---
*Echo-bun deportation switch*?
---
Changing my behavior in what way?
---
Doesn’t mean you have to yell at people for little things like that
---
Haven’t gotten a chance to try it, just got off work, going home to test this out now lol
---
I use the US flag as curtains and it works lol. Covers the windows nicely but drapes would be better.
---
What I'd really like a kraken-like beast in some of the ponds. But they're sneaky and send their tendrils after you when you're not looking and tear down you and your house.
---
I got stung by a bee at that age and it makes me do the opposite when I see a Honey Beast. I hate seeing those grotesque things limping towards you it’s the most terrifying creature in the game.
---
Level 83 and I usually still run away from them lol
---
Wow, suddenly I really want to play fo4 again. Never thought I'd feel happy about other people judging me. Weird.
---
I hate myself. That looks awesome, I wish I had gotten it. I only play sporadically, I'm on this subreddit more than I'm actually playing.
---
Part of the problem with energy weapons is that most enemies (in PVE) have higher energy resistance rating than physical damage rating.
---
So, not only do energy weapons have lower damage and penetration, they also have to overcome higher resistance 
---
In my opinion, it all comes down to what you like and what weapon RNG bestowed upon you.  Also, the mathematical difference of 1-2 shots to down an enemy is not the main deciding factor in how you play.
---
furious ones work pretty well as a commando build with a focus on vats/crits
---
and well i guess i dont have to tell you but if you hapoen to get hand on an explosive one your having a good time as well
---
Boring nerfed games are boring
---
Also isn't endurance on armor and weapons bugged and not add to health? Or was that fixed?
---
Absolutely. They're fantastic. This is what I want in the Atom Store.
---
Neither am I but it doesn’t make him wrong.
---
Yeah I kind of fucked up I was trying to trade it and I couldn't and I didn't think about why (it had atom shop paint) so then I dropped it to see if that works destroyed it and it was gone. I will agree it is poorly explained. I was also tired so my brain wasn't functioning.
---
oh well that sucks, the game should just remove the paint if you try to trade it because that's what I was trying to do
---
Omg you've reminded me of my long suppressed memory of taking a breath in to play a recorder, not knowing a spider had crawled in. Thanks so much for that.
---
Read the comment in Ze Frank's voice.
---
Man I had no idea about this, thanks for info, this will be so useful! Gonna break em rifles really hard now.
---
Their account is tied to an email and more often a phone number and billing address, your name etc. The police can just ask them and they'll hand it over odds are it traces back to you
---
All skins ill be probably brought back at a big discount when new DLC/content will be rolling out, just like before, to clear the shop. I cant imagine they wont do this ever again, buut then again I've played The Elder Scrolls Blades.
---
Happened to me went I went on spring break with my grandparents out of the blue. They just told me “hey want to go out of town with us” like 3 days before. I missed all of those “get them before they leave the vault” items :/
---
Yup
---
Make a new low level and just run around helvitia
---
But you had a workshop on that server in that game play session at some point?
---
I’m about to drag another friend in too!
---
I was with you until you called a bunch of people nerds for not liking the same cosmetics as you.
---
What! Psh nooooooo
---
Not hard to find but in survival sometimes if u get briefed a bit you lose aid items and a couple times I lost all meat and with the carnivore mutation I need good meat at my camp while I regroup.
---
Some of the challenges are still broken after 6 months and can't be completed.
---
What system? I literally never use mine. I'm on xb1.
---
Damn, I get that they don’t want people to trade atom shop skins, but it’s sucks that the whole item gets destroyed. It’s good to keep in mind: always repaint before you trade!
---
I just ignore them. I had a group of 3 players who kept shooting me last night at WS station. Whatever have fun wasting ammo I just stood there waiting for my team to arrive so we could farm a WS nuke zone. I'm here to pick flowers and farm flux not fight morons.
---
If you do not do enough damage to the queen you will not get loot.
---
It looks empty. It doesn't look full after you put stuff in it.
---
Ya im getting tired of all these good limited time items. Im not a millionare bethesda!!!
---
I dont know, man. I've never bought a repair kit and usually have no problem repairing my stuff right at the bench.
---
19 instances of wood in helvetia - still gonna take a while!
---
Yeah that's definitely the way to do it you have to do the same if you want to sell them as well remove all atom store paints
---
No, we don't need another SB we're sick of waiting for things to land so we can kill them.
---
l agree with the deathclaws not being scary anymore, in fact being snug in my x-01 nothing in '76 poses too much of a problem for me, apart from the few stubborn scorchbeast's that refuse to land! (Pure melee)
---
Maybe x5 characters that's around 100 then next day just do it on 2 or 3
---
Lumber mill directly south of vault 76
---
If you get on top just hide on top of the car and shoot the gutsy that appear from the elevator and the bot pod. Do sneak attack as you stay behind the defence wall.
---
Yeah. Pretty sure that Bethesda was like F' these vault dwellers and gave the Mr. Gutsy 100% armor pen.
---
Yeah I wouldn't think it would be much harder to just auto remove all atom store mods before trade/drop unless the whole item is completely unavailable in the normal game
---
true - that's an option. But I only get 5 characters on xbox and have three active and 2 mules, so it's not an option for me - but would be for others so good advice. Shame this post is already removed tho...;-)
---
Excavator infinite carry weight...
---
Annnd...
---
*You don’t feel that you need to repair more often than usual?*
---
Excellent tip.
---
Gonna try it on something worthless first to see if it works.
---
Knowing my luck BGS will release a new update which will include a bug that deletes broken items from stash 😂😂😂
---
Hey it gave me some good insight, I'm gonna do that now with 5 ppl
---
Got to be too good to be true?
---
When I placed it, it auto fillwd with 2 nukashine, wine, and bourbon...
---
*By the way, I will never buy a repair kit. It should be in the gameplay itself!*
---
Some people hating that the rider sets change your model for PA. But I'm with you having a new look for the excavator is pretty nice.
---
Im getting more of a Bebop vibe.
---
Autocorrect....the name of us all. *bane
---
steam link if you are on pc
---
Guilty! It’s the only liquor I make anyways so why not.
---
For real! It looks like a t45 armor was dunked in lobster parts
---
I had 3 broken rifles and still counted as +/-45lbs carry weight yesterday, just your value is 0 not the weight
---
I got multiple repair kits from sbq. Still haven’t felt the need to use them. I didn’t notice a difference in weapons breaking faster at all.
---
Buff deathclaw
---
I'd like this, would show people the games better than a lot of other games. ( everyone acts like this games legit unplayable)
---
Please tell me your on xbox.  I dont care if it isn't a legendary I need a gun runner in my life
---
By turning off area chat and closing yourself off. Don't let one bad apple ruin the bunch. The 76 community is surprisingly cool for the most part. In my experience for every ten people you run into there's one turd three decent people and the other six ignore you and go on their merry.
---
I am sorry, you were right.. I had a display glitch, and I was so happy about the potential so I got ahead of myself.. I will remove the post.
---
I have seen this post over and over again. If you dont do enough damage then no loot.  This is not a bug or a glitch. Do yourself a favor and instead of running into the event, fast travel on it. That gives you more time to do more damage. My group will either speedrun her or give people time to get hits. It is crazy the amount of people who stand around not shooting her. Crafting ammo is not hard.
---
I just assume they're wielding twin .50 Desert Eagles, because they are very hurty.
---
inb4 "JuSt PlAy tHe GaMe iNsTeAd oF GoInG oN tHe SuB tHeN"
---
Yep.  In fact, my camp is right near a spawn location where I am guaranteed a spawn of one.  If you have enforcer perk set up, it makes for nice farming - just snipe it a bit to bring it in close, and then shotgun until it's crippled, and then just walk up and shotty to the face a bit and/or melee, and it's down.
---
Apparently you did, as I am not responding to the OP ... I'm responding to an inner comment thread.
---
that's what I thought
---
Both my weapons and armor have been braking faster
---
In fallout 4 there where more types of ants and ant swarms they act just like bee swarms and now that I'm thinking about it i think the bee swarms are just the ant swarms with a different model
---
Nuclear winter vault 94/96 and many other quest/game modes are coming. So what exactly is your issue? They're already prividing what you're asking for.
---
Here's the roadmap because you obviously are unaware of it
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps
---
Imagine insulting people for not having the same taste in cosmetics.
---
Ik. The amount of lfg posts on Xbox that are just, I just died in survival give me stuff are stupid. I always report them
---
Theres no point in writing something negative here. Just too much fanboys that attack you once you speak the truth about bugs and shit that should not be in game after 7 months
---
Ok you know that those OP shovels gotta be in there somewhere
---
Otherwise every gun we buy on the market would be broken 😂
---
I'm on the sub probably two or three times a week, for like 5 minutes a piece, usually when I'm just waiting for something else. Like right now, I'm only typing this because D2 is taking a while to load.
---
Nope.
---
I SMITE YOUR HERETIC SOULS, IN THE NAME OF ASUR!!!
---
Sylvie and Sons Logging Camp has a good amount of instances too (15-18 I believe) tightly packed together in a small area.
---
On Xbox they could put it on GamePass, FO4 is already there.
---
Huh never found one, then again, first time I saw the Flatwoods monster and fogcrawlers was yesterday, so fair enough that I've missed a few
---
Wait, do they spawn without server hopping ?
---
Dude if they add maxson battle coat I'm gonna have to buy atoms
---
I had renamed my chasis but not the individual parts. I'm going to do some experimenting to see how I can recreate this and what conditions effect it. FYI every PA piece was modded not sure if this is part of it but I'll find out tonight.
---
All my broken armour still have weight, so I think you may be mistaken.
---
No fr I have level 45 hardened reciecer something stock long barrall silenced toe shot explosion shotgun and it's really good I actually used it to take down scotch beast queen and was doing decent damage
---
That could apply to pretty much all good weapons, in my case.  I have come to suspect that the devs have personally edited and deprecated the loot tables for my toons, as I have not received anything useful as a weapon in the last 50-60 levels.  I killed a 4-star legendary the yesterday and got another 1-star anti-armor melee weapon for my squishy stealth shotgun build.
---
My current toon is 111, and my best weapon is level 45.
---
Can confirm. This should be the top comment.
---
Cool so there are random spawns then. By chance you recall the creature level?
---
What response did you get? I'm going to submit a ticket tonight after I create a youtube account so they have access to a better quality vid.
---
as a newbie, a well built player home isnt immediately obvious as a player home. Several times i stumbled onto homes and thought they were legit fallout places (it took a few days before i even noticed the player tags on them).
---
Still doesn't touch the nukashine, literally gamebreaking I want my money back now Bethesda before I make a post whining about how I'm going to quit
---
Agreed. Also the new bar set should be modular
---
I’ve run into the same problem.
---
I’ve had a character with a full set of weapon weight reducing armor, and it brings all weapons down to 10% of their original weight.  Equipping weapon weight reducing perks drops the weight down further.
---
So, I attempted the same with a full set of junk weight reducing armor and the Pack Rat perk, but it didn’t affect it with or without the perk.
---
Furthermore, when I unequipped all of the armor, and left the perk equipped, the weight remained the same.
---
So all five pieces of junk weight reducing armor was only dropping the weight down by 75%, which is less than what four pieces should do.
---
The plague walker mutation is potent enough when you are sick to do that for you. Be warned.
---
I don’t talk when I have it on anyways though. I only just turned it on because the other day I wanted to see what people were saying for better help defending the Brahmin. 
---
I play Overwatch too and the last time I was in the chat to hear my team I was being treated the same why by a guy that sounded exactly like him. I don’t need to deal with that. And avoiding it will make me a happier person
---
Because it's not
---
bad bot?
---
I didn’t mean forced in the sense that the game is unplayable without them. Just that you’ll have to buy atoms for some of the limited time stuff, because you can’t grind the free atoms fast enough. And I support BGS fully in setting it up that way.
---
The free gift emote was also a highly requested item ! Yes, They're listening :)
---
Agreed. 
---
I was thinking the exact same thing. A few weeks ago there was a white door with leaves/floral pattern on it on sale, limited time item. I'm utterly convinced this door was for sale in the atom shop previously (not limited time, just one of the options available normally but got removed alongside other items).
---
This got me wondering if limited items will return again over time.
---
No. I just did it 10 times in a row and got no legendaries. Had to hop each time.
---
They got me to run a system diagnoses from their launcher and send it to them, then uodate my graphics drivers and run the gane without any other apps open, then to see if i could possibly record it ect... I said back to them that its hapoened once in 500 hours and might be pretty difficult to recreate, but i managed to the first time i copied what scrapped it the first time, so i sejt the video off to them in a new ticket because the one was hust getting auto responses saying to make a new ticket
---
I've honestly dropped D2 after Forsaken. I just feel that when I log in, even without the 2 new dlc, I get overwhelmed by all the crap I have to do just to get my LL up.
---
I really like the plasma rifle with the flamer mod. Also looted a vampires cryolater and tse railway rifle recently, which are good fun.
---
Step 1: buy a mic. 
---
Step 2: ???
---
Step 3: Profit.
---
I use underarmor all the time and never use outfits. What do you mean useless? Useless to you.
---
I'm hoping so, I regret not buying the coal dust PA skin
---
62 maybe? It was high.
---
I am a "raider" and last night i killed a 267 with my 65 so not all of us go after lower levels . I get more caps and most of my junk from higher level players.  Survival  is a waste of time , you cant even make enough caps to cover the ammo used
---
It's not that bad, someone's just mad they can't buy a God roll for 10k
---
For my melee build i love my 3\* ski sword. It looks so ugly but it swings 30% faster so the dps is high. 
---
I also like my 3\* walking cane. Double demage if target is healthy and 40% more damage on strong attack. Kills nearly everything with one hit :)
---
I love my Fixer gun with a mix of build stealth and perks for automatics guns well that rocks!
---
I'm on PS4 I'm not sure I can do that. I'll let you know what they say when I submit my ticket.
---
How about a turd?
---
How are you gonna see the under armor if you are wearing armor pieces over it is what I mean
---
At least if its on PS4 they cant say its your system since theyre all the same specs
---
Not really. Also, when I do need to repair it doesn't usually take a crazy amount of resources to just do it right through the bench
---
Found this screenshot rummaging through my files during my break, it is from a curve editor/viewer that someone kindly made for us (the curve tables are .xml files, this little tool plots the curve).
---
[https://imgur.com/ZMFP8DR](https://imgur.com/ZMFP8DR)
---
Unfortunately this curve is not present in all COBJ records. The more you look into the esm the more 'patchy' and inconsistent everything appears.
---
Well, that answers the "what will happen if i drop my Atoms shop PA suit" question.
---
The people who develop the Atom shop items are not the same people who develop content for the game.
---
 There is also a roadmap out that will tell you all the new content that's coming out so you wouldn't of even had to make this post if you searched. Google is your friend.
---
Ejlhh. Looks like t 45 dunked in lobster parts
---
Very true they won't be able to claim user or system error.
---
So "X" is Intelligence, "Y" is.. Chance to learn?
---
    if post.getTitle().contains("trade")
---
    AUTOMOD.SMASH("!!”);
---
Repair kits are in the gameplay. SBQ drops a better variant of them.
---
I've had this happen to me once or twice in my 600 hours. It was also particularly laggy moment too. It was random, unreliable, and fixed itself up. On the vid its clearly seen how not only its done rather reliably, but also is abused in PvP. I suppose these are two different things, and while one is an resource loading problem the other is a resource managing hack.
---
I have a very mixed build but I have to say I love my Exterminators Fire Axe with spikes. 
---
...I may or may not have given it its own name
---
And turrets are needed for the challenge too.
---
Yeah, of course they're abusing it here. And typically if a bug exists, a hack exists to exploit it
---
I'll trade you something nice for the tse railway if you are interested in selling and on PC. Not talking caps, god weapons offer.
---
Plasma grenades are you friend here...........
---
I stopped worrying about light and Im only playing now to get the Arbalest.
---
Also need serendipity, dodgy , fireproof and adamantium skeleton to mitigate damage because your health is so low
---
I prefer the military one.
---
Awesome to hear.  Just hope it becomes a more frequent spawn then say mothman lol
---
I once had this when I was in my level 60’s playing with my boyfriend. There was a level 30 hitting me and his level 90+ friend standing back, clearly waiting for me to come out of pacifist mode. (My boyfriend was round the corner at the time). For about 5 minutes he was hitting me whilst I was looting, I finally caved, turned off pacifist mode, killed the level 30 and then his friend started shooting me. I go down. Boyfriend comes round the corner with his two shot explosive and kills him. They were on area chat screaming for their loot back.
---
I was wondering this myself, seemed to me that Super Duper wasn't helping. Probably more fair.
---
Im almost 40 i use the .50 mg as heavy weapons are my main weapon and perked. My secondary is an automatic charged laser rifle with a combat rifle as back up in stash when ammo is an issue. So far its pretty good i like the feel of heavies for harder stuff and the rifle when i run low on ammo.
---
if you’re on PS4 i can throw down with you. i’ve cleared watoga. stealth sniped through that mission. mayor for a day will grant you free roam access to watoga. PSN: moonadamt holler.
---
Are things breaking faster?
---
It is a genuine question not cynicism; as opposed to FC consumption using VATS or consumable 'spoilage rate' this I have not noticed.
---
Full disclosure, I haven't run White Knight (when using regular armor)/Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior etc for quite a while so I am accustomed to a certain rate of degradation that might make the difference between 'fast' and 'faster' harder for me to notice.
---
I think it spawned three star but it was fighting those glowing bucks and it quit doing the green glow effect before I could get over there in sneak
---
I fought one earlier on the road near Hopewell Cave
---
I think he was level 50, I’m level 40. Dropped a 1-star which was nothing special, I think an Armor arm 
---
First time fighting one, haven’t gone hunting for them, why are they so special?
---
Ok, cool, thanks
---
I had a stalking mothman appear and it disappeared after about half health, couldn’t find it, is that what they normally do?
---
Nope, x is INT and y is a multiplier for the base chance to learn.
---
The base chance is determined by a global variable.
---
imo you cannot compare fo4 and fo76. The story in fo76 is just poor and braindead. If you hurry through the story you are finished in less than 50h. But i like the teamplay, the mutations and some of the events. Played it for over 500h now :)
---
mirelurk Kings, gutsies, yao guai,sheepsquats, assoultron those are way powerful than a deathclaw. Dispite having 450 ballistic resistance and 200 energy resist they still kill me in a few shots/punches.
---
My favorites are bloodied vatscritDMG combat rifle, bloodied firerate handmade, quad tesla, quad explosive harpoon and quad vatscritDMG plasma rifle.
---
I got both my deathclaws from behind the southern lookout tower near fort Defiance
---
i tried everything, but nothing works. And as you can see on the downvotes, people arent very helpfull either
---
Nope doesn’t work jut tested it :(
---
Typically someone who sees so many faults in a game and discourages new players would fall into disliking the game. 💁
---
I believe so. Once you engage in a fight they don’t stick around very long I notice. And with a decent high health it’s hard to kill them quickly if ure not prepare or setup for it.
---
I got lucky after a SBQ still on chems with my bloodied DCG and killed one in one hit.  Other couple of times they spawn off and away 😂
---
Okay, so INT 15 to 25 looks to get you from 1.25 to 1.3 multiplier to whatever the game has as a base chance to learn for that item.  So, not really worth pushing for 15+ outside using clothing mods (it looks like)
---
I understand your struggle with the servers but the artists don't work on that side of the game. It's nice to see the artists putting out quality content but it would be great to see the Devs iron out the issues as well
---
It just works.
---
Do people
---
Still question the existence of 3* sheepsquatches? There have been some discussions, after the squatch got implemented if there are only 1* in the event.
---
--close
---
for me ping/lag is nearly always borderline too high for comfort; things taking a second to process isn't that rare
---
I'd suggest steel toed boots with that weapon ;)
---
Did you have to be close to the beast for effectiveness?
---
K
---
The values are actually 1.32 for INT 20 and 1.36 for INT 25 (0.04% increase for 5 INT, why bother coding that? It baffles me...)
---
And if you miss fo76 while in Fo4 just build some bots at the workbench lol
---
I find them useful for dealing with Super Mutants, as my ballistic weapons seem to deal very little damage but energy weapons appear to deliver a bit more
---
The entire point of 76 is to do this, in a noclip interview they talked about how they wanted to create extremely dangerous creatures that are so mutated that they didn’t survive 200 years in the future.
---
If you are chasing the transponders near Watoga/ fissure prime. You can just go to the last one you did an it will reactivate.
---
Nah mate they just bow down in sight of your shiny glorious PA
---
If you’re on Xbox, I’ll craft one for ya. I know it’s not the same as unlocking it, but the offer stands.
---
I had a down right comical PVP moment recently, when a level 52 player began attacking one of my vendor camps, I believe he was actually trying to PVP with a level 36 player that I was trading with, but instead they got something they surely never expected. My level 6 Aid Vendor character happens to be equipped with a level 5 Furious explosive Pump Shotgun, so I ducked out of sight switched off Pacifist and 1 shot them, I then posted up in a good location to wait for the revenge, but they re-spawned at vault 76 and left the server, leaving behind a bag with a nice haul of Junk. Best I can figure, they were too embarrassed after getting killed by a level 6.
---
Depends on your build. Do you use melee weapons or guns? Also, I wouldn’t put too many points into Charisma if you tend to play solo.
---
Good question. I suspect nothing changes as I haven't noticed much of a difference after level 50. Hope I'm wrong!
---
Just our friendly neighborhood Canadian, do what he knows best
---
And I’m the ruffian Aussie 🤣
---
SAUSAGE SANGAS? IS THAT YOU?
---
I love these. Idiots start shit. Idiots lose shit because of their own stupidity. Idiots expect compensation for being idiots.
---
That’s my junk now, bitches.
---
I got it on my xo1... thought it look pretty slick
---
But I can’t insert a photo on reddit messaging setup
---
Nothing else changes as you level. A level 200 is the same as a level 50. 
---
Most spend there time improving their gear by grinding out legendaries.  Or tweaking their perks and point distribution.
---
#onionalwaysontop
---
1H melee.  Tried a lot of different things, but as I progressed through levels, these were/are my gotos:
---
1-20 : machete / instigating fire axe/ 10mm pistol
---
20-30 : vampire machete / 38 auto rifle
---
30-50: vampire machete / death tambo/ deathclaw gauntlet / hardended sniper rifle
---
40-50 death tambo / assaultron blade / hardened sniper rifle
---
50-74: cultist blade / blade of bastet / vampire switchblade / executioners combat rifle
---
Aye at least you didn’t have to download it 3 times! The game is a blast though. People act like there’s nothing to do but I’ve been on since beta and still find new things. Have fun!
---
YOU HAVNT LIVED TILL YOUVE HAD BUNNINGS SNAG!!
---
Will it affect non-hostiles? I once had a griefer drop dead while spamming melee attacks on me; I had welded rebar on my power armor and he was probably bloodied.
---
I’m telling you you haven’t honestly it’s like eating actual dragons meat
---
I hope so too. I really regret not buying that Blackbird pa skin when it was out.
---
Been thinking the same since FO4.
---
Alas, this game has no offline component. Discs for always online games are pretty much just drm these days. You still end up downloading the whole thing.
---
I had to leave my console in rest mode for 24+ hours since my Internet sucks. 🤣
---
I have seen this a lot lately, even with my own characters (I run 2 Xboxes), you can usually team invite when you are face to face with each other, if that doesn't work, check to see that one of you is not still showing to be on a team. when a team splits up the last player who did not leave the team, will often still be considered by the game to be on a team, even though everyone else is gone.
---
Miss my good ol' Medicine Stick. Or when unique weapons looked unique.
---
Pootis Spenser here!
---
This makes me hopeful that one day we can display our toon names and have text chat
---
Tastes like warm lemonade and fear.
---
Thank y’all, and if y’all know is it easier to make ammo for them than ballistic
---
That's dedication to lemonade.
---
Oh yeah dude, camped out about 2 weeks ago , made sangas on the grill by the river, never felt more Australian in my life, my first reaction was "crikey, that fucking cunts good" lol
---
That would be nice and a mail system too
---
Don’t carry 5 billion things
---
Aye now your speaking my language
---
After hearing cunt 42 times in an hour playing with ya, I figured that would hit home for ya
---
Thanks for the help 👍
---
Ana amazingly detailed and varied world, environmental storytelling at it's absolute peak, enemy variation, improved lighting, animation for actions is better. 76 has more widescale improvements than you think, something i only realized when going back to 4.
---
Mate 42 times is rookie numbers I wasn’t even warmed up 🤣
---
Limited time items Suck when it's something you need, but miss out on due to real life happening outside the game.
---
I was out of town most of the week before Easter, and returned to learn about the Eggs that I had already missed out on two of, so I can't get all 6 and the ability to craft the Bunny head like everyone else.
---
^This fucking guy lmao , I need more Aussie friends in my life
---
I use melee but also rifles sometimes I am thinking of just going all out melee
---
Thx sir
---
Which type
---
This is the funniest thread. You dudes need girlfriends or some for of lubricant for your palms. They can't even make existing weapons work properly. The crossbow is an embarrassment, along with many others like the railway gun. Let's move away from the fantasy of pre-laid adolescents, and get back to the basics of making it fundamentally playable. I don't want to double-wield two shitty weapons.
---
Y'know, SBQ, if it's too tart just don't drink it. Way to overreact!
---
Run around the Cranberry Bog, the Beaver Dam Log piles are everywhere and most have around 8 collectable logs each.
---
Anybody know where these are on the map?
---
Also those damn cave crickets and mutated ants
---
Don't think so...yet
---
Whilst this is somewhat a solution for the more hardcore of us, I feel like there could be some improvement to the Atom Shop pricing/value.
---
Great photos!
---
The first time I tried a silo alone, I failed to realize the significance that all the loot had already been looted.  I got down into the depths of the silo.  Ran out of ammo and died leaving a bunch of ultracite and black titanium in my loot bag.  No problem, eh?  I respawn outside the silo entrance but now am locked out of using the elevator because "Silo has already been activated."  My dropped loot is permanently inaccessible. Apparently, I entered the silo just after somebody who launched a nuke and cleared out.  I tried waiting around for the site to "reset" but got a Server disconnect.  :(
---
I spend all last night grinding out the challenge and this is almost exactly what I did. Approved
---
Then you already completed my next test, I haven't done WWR and perks yet. So there is an additional reduction with perks, wow! So inconsistent! Thanks for sharing!
---
Just slightly SW of Solomon's Pond (E of Whitesprings Hotel), there's another small pond that ALWAYS spawns one, if you just want the experience.
---
Would be cool but good look with that, I can't think of a single game that does thar
---
Even the cool little campers you find in game would be cool. Or those metal quonset buildings scattered around.
---
That's great that the player gave it back!
---
I've only done this once, the bag did that lag loading thing for a terrible 30 seconds and then I got it back.
---
Luckily it's a lever rifle so I have painted it now to stop this from happening again. If they released paint for all weapons and armor I think they would see very fast atom store sales for this reason :-)
---
3 star Legendary Badass Ultra Milurk Queen or Major Gutsy or Sheepsqatch -
---
1 star "troubleshooter" wood left arm
---
Every. Time.
---
When crafting fails, fill it with vodka.
---
Oo, yes please.
---
I don't know maybe it was a panic attack or something it else,I was freaking out but I know for sure that my wife kept looking at me in a weird way.
---
I will ask her.
---
My camp is near where 3 occasionally spawn. I'm lvl170 and if I hear their sonic attack I just server hop now. They're such an annoying pain
---
thanks :)
---
If u buy a paint from the atom shop it could never be dropped or accidentally sold..only certain ones tho..like levers
---
I like it! Especially now that the bag drops somewhere in your vicinity instead of right in front of you.
---
im on pc, but i couldnt use the bench anyways :/
---
I tried that and found no Taggerdy corpse in the Glass Cavern.  Had to repeat the whole bloody thing from scratch to complete the quest (this time, Taggerdy was there).
---
I snagged this by complete luck during Scorched Earth. It was insane and I felt like an actual battlefield photographer. A dozen high level players, lasers and bullets flying everywhere, grenades going off, SBQ, tripping over mirelurks left and right when a three star queen shows up... It was the coolest fucking shot I've ever taken. Challenge counted. Photo inventory full plz try again. &gt;:( We need more room for these on console, that has really ruined some cool moments for me.
---
This is excellent! I'd love it if the Prize bot arrived during a SBQ fight.
---
"Congratulations!"
---
Yeah they should all be on one pic.
---
I've snaped a nice pic at highland marsh in the mire
---
And don't forget - dead or alive ;)
---
I think nuking fhe queen could make them spawn
---
I saw in a thread someone talk about a night vision lens but I can't verify this
---
I've looted several handmades, including several 1\* legendaries.  So far, none of the handmades  compare to the standard Marksmans Hardened Sniper Rifle (.308) - which puts out over 2x the base damage of the handmades.  (Handmade autos were in the low 40s per shot, with a 30% bonus for specific creature types.  The Sniper is \~110 per shot.)
---
Because of the higher per shot damage, it uses less ammo and is often a faster kill.   
---
The Executioners combat rifle (.45) also puts out more than any handmade I've found, again including the legendaries.
---
YMMV adn all the standard disclaimers.
---
Gatiling gunnisbprobabky the overall best in the game. Durable, powerful, accurate, easy to find/craft ammo. There’s very few downsides with a heavy build and this gun.
---
Is anyone else as nervous as I am about accessing the rename option via the scrap screen of the UI? One wrong move or slip of your cursor or game pad and POOF, gone forever.
---
I had 5 sets of power armor to rename and it was a white knuckle moment for each one.
---
I think there is a place in the Mire where there is a dead body who was studying them. There is a dead Queen, eggs, Kings and possibly the Mirelurk. Just annoyed I can't remember where it was exactly or even where it was close to. 😞
---
Unless they changed the animation, I believe that the hunting rifle is left handed.
---
I found them all together at "Macs Farm" in the cranberry bog really easily
---
Bloodied gatling gun with +25% fire rate
---
What is a progenie? the little hatchlings that spawn from the queen?
---
Thanks but it's my first ever tse in nearly *cough* hundred hours and I'm a rifleman, so I couldn't let it go.
---
I like that after playing this game for 6 months or so, it's honestly the first online game where the majority of the community is in it for a fun time, and largely helpful. And now with survival mode, the few remaining griefers are weeded out. Nice story. :)
---
I'm with you all the way here..my bloodied GG has this and explosive...deadly
---
most of the strong creatures have terrible loot drops though really all scorch beasts and queens should be a 1 star legend automatically
---
I'd love a variation of this idea implemented. Character can die and respawn, but ALL items are dropped on death, and there are no legendary items - people gotta do with crafted weapons and armor.
---
Excellent reply, thank you
---
Wait till you see death!
---
depends on builds I find kings and queens pretty tame same with deathclaws but can't stand gutsys and yoa gui as they seem to fall into a niche my abilities don't' do well against
---
Sweet! Too bad they removed the effect of martial artist... although this weapon is OP as is hehe
---
"A round lemonade for my tiny shiny armored gun wavin' fellas - all on me"
---
\#1, the ISS, is the strongest. This list, lowest to highest (10 to 1), ranks ALL enemies in the game.
---
The thing is while I have lots of cool guns I don't have any railway rifle and I'm a collector. This puts you in interesting position where you can rip me off from two comparable weapons and still make me happy :p
---
I'll totally be doing this when item display is a thing
---
Would make sense since they have the gift emote now.
---
Whitespring mall merchants have oil lights, including the candles.
---
Weren't ants and crickets exclusive to Nuka World?
---
Takes different materials. Imo bullets are easier since you can get a ton of lead in lucky hole, steel is everywhere, gunpowder is on every super mutant and if I really need to make gunpowder, cloth is super easy to find too
---
oh yeah they were
---
having power armor in your inventory is nice, I never used it in 4 because you had to travel while wearing it.
---
\#1 is the strongest, #10 weakest. Scorchbeasts didn't make the cut. They aren't very challenging unless you are low level. The SBQ didn't make the cut because she's only a scorchbeast that's a bullet sponge. I guess she could be placed at 11.
---
Bloodied/furious buzz blade is OP against SBQ. Bloodied power fist for doing 1500 damage a hit. Bloodied handmade for pvp and general normal mobs. Imo the handmade is the best gun and any unarmed melee weapons are best for melee because talon+twisted muscle= tons of fucking damage
---
Running bloodied build at lvl 120, so Bloodied Plasma Gatling for SB, Squatchbeasts, and other big stuff; bloodied hardened combat shotgun for lvl50 to 70ish mobs; all rise and the Gutter for others. Also have TSE 45 sniper rifle.
---
if your going against people in power armor use pulse mines or pulse grenades it will do around 90% dmg to a x-01 without perks 
---
the mirv fragmentation grenade is also a beast 
---
I'm not huge on pvping but me and my friend duel often mostly to test ideas and weapons in controlled situations against known factors (how much hp / armor / body location ect) to learn the mechanics of the game - was testing grenades saw a pulse grenade bounced it off his x-01 (I have +95% explosive 80% +15 from bloody mess) he basically liquefied on hit from it 
---
later though he bounced a mirv frag I had made and handed him off my excavator armor and 1 hit I was down all the time we were just laughing and being stupid since we were not using our real weapons 
---
and of course the fun of trying to fight each other with black powder pistols no vats no armor lols
---
I've killed 50+,both random and free range events, all being 1*. Who knows, Lootcifer may bless me tonight.
---
sadly only the guy on the photo reacted to my "lets take a picture" emote but it was fun :)
---
Please share!
---
I think that might just be piss.
---
Nothing changes after 50 (yet) other than being able to buy more perk cards and you have the pleasure of losing more caps when you get killed. I lose a lovely 154 caps each time, so it's best if you dont let people kill you
---
So he make her drink "lemonade" somehow
---
I don't like farming for XP, but I understand your situation. I suck to so sometimes for fun I try to find areas where I can pick off enemies without putting myself in too much risk (mainly so my armor and stuff doesn't get to broken up). If you have lots and lots of ammo, a good place to snipe pretty safely is near the train depot (depot, not station) north of whitesprings. On the west side of the tracks is a cliff you can perch on, somewhere between the end of the boxcars and the Sentry bot patrolling up the road. There'll be a bunch of super mutants walking around down there and if you do it right, you can pick them off one at a time (will take a bunch of shots though). They can shoot at you, but they don't seem to have a path up the cliff. When they're all dead you can loot 'em, but there will be some rads so be careful. It's an easy, safe walk from the area around Cliffwatch to get there by simply heading due east.
---
But, really, you can just get a bunch of XP from finding new places, doing easy events like Buried With Honor, and scrapping/crafting stuff. All else fails, go to Whitespring and get your tags in (you'll probably get killed a bunch of times, but so what).
---
May Lootcifer be with you: https://ibb.co/4RrwpZk
---
That center pool reminded me of old 007 movie when it was used to feed people to the pool sharks :)
---
Yeah we met in-game but it did not work. I guess because the game somehow thought he was in the main menu. He wasn't in a team as he just had joined my server.
---
I have a nice railway been holding onto if your interested:
---
Medics Explosive railway lvl 40 3\* +25% less vats ap cost+VATS crits heal group
---
I would like to be able to find my shit if I die more then once! They mark the first bag but much like today(damn death claw)i died twice and neither bag was marked. So I lost a ton of junk i actually needed....and in the swamp...grr..I obviously don't care about the second death as I had nothing on me...just atleast mark the bag with my junk in it..
---
No problem. If you use something that takes fusion cells I suspect you wont ever have to make your own ammo though. Most players just drop them and they are super abundant as well
---
&gt;giving out checking account numbers and Social Security numbers
---
So? You can harass someone with that, but you can't steal any money from them.
---
(you can steal from a bank, but unless you are overly worried of the bank going under because of that, it doesn't matter much now does it)
---
My main is a Versatile/Stealth build (level 210+), and while early in the game I only needed 2 weapons (TSE Handmade, and Explosive Combat SG) things changed and so did I, my list of most used weapons in the order I use the most, (all are 3\* max level).
---
1. Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet (saves Ammo and one hits nearly everything while sneaking)
---
2. Instigating Explosive Lever (Stacks Vats Crits every 3rd Shot)
---
3. TSE Handmade (Still a viable weapon for Hordes or tanky enemies) 
---
4. Instigating Bat or Machete (Saves wear 7 tear on the DCG when playing in low level areas, also usable in PA)
---
5. Troubleshooter's Explosive Combat SG (Great for the SheepSquatch Imposter, or anything for that matter)
---
6. Primed Zealot's Explosive LMG (anything Scorched dies quick, L80 SB in less than 3 seconds)
---
7. Primed TSE 50 Cal ( The SBQ weapon of choice)
---
I run with 4 pieces of Weapons weight reduction armor unless I'm on the Survival Server or specifically going to do PVP, so carrying a lot of weapons is not an issue, and with all the changes to the game, durability and ammo management is much easier when you remain Versatile.
---
Oh yea, I also carry a Instigating Explosive 10mm pistol, I use it to cripple ghouls while playing with others at WS so I don't one hit everything (it still does sometimes), and for some reason everyone wants it, I only do prearranged trades with my main, and literally everyone requests my 10mm, it's not for sale people! I don't care how many caps you have.
---
No need to feel ashamed getting one shotted by a level 5 weapon when weapons scale to 50 for pvp purposes
---
Thanks but I'm weirdly sentimental about unusual or very rare loots.
---
The thing is I encountered one while doing that event just last night.
---
My favorite has to be my BE lever.  with my VATS/AP/Rifle build, its a beast.  knocks back super mutants about 10 feet in one shot.
---
You should be able to lock items. Make them impossible to drop sell or trade unless you unlock them.
---
I had my best gun equipped, explosive shotgun. Fast travel. Load in unarmed.   
---
No bag at my feet. 
---
Back to my CAMP (where I just came from) ASAP. 
---
No bag.. anywhere. 
---
Open ticket.  "**Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to restore lost items."**
---
Die a little inside.
---
Yes, I’m saying it’s possible so whats your point?
---
Thank u at least someone that gets it i literally dont even want to try for workshops anymore because so many people r exploiting it so I'll just have to keep leaving servers which sucks so no more workshops for me haha I also do agree with the survival mode nerf being ridiculous cuz it does make it pointless for them to be in it so I get that point of things dev's just need to fix the workshop pvp
---
Excellent reply, this is gold standard information
---
Did this event around 20times on the 1st day, had 1 3star, next best was a 2star and a 1star together, Got a good drop off the 3* though
---
 https://imgur.com/a/gnCEcFa
---
Friend me (nmprogue) and come to whitesprings or travel to me. You tag them I’ll bag them. You’ll level up quick as hell.
---
Minecraft lol
---
Were you referring to anything techncally possible, or legal, either?
---
“...a mouthful of forever memories.”
---
Brilliant!
---
I did my first one alone at level 35ish with whatever power armour I had at the time. Dropped on prime site and had no problems killing the queen with just me and my buddy. Unfortunately everything besides non explosive laser and heavy weapons have gotten a nerf since then so it's a little harder now but still totally doable
---
When I play survival I dont keep any aid or junk on me haha but ya I guess I should expected there to be more people doing this now that the survival mode is nerfed
---
Understandable man, happy hunting
---
Yea, the Social menu has been really messed up lately, sometimes I only get the option to "Join" a friend, even though they are standing nearby on the same map, or it shows them on the Main Menu.
---
Nice one! I wasn’t lucky unfortunately. 1* Cryolator :(
---
That happens from normal energy weapons too not just ultracite
---
I do agree the survival mode nerf was stupid. salty people that lost alot of caps ruined it most people that went to survival mode before the nerf accepted that they could possibly lose a bit of caps u only getting 10 caps per kill when u can get 68 in the regular mode is ridiculous
---
The police can't just ask they would need a warrant, and I don't think they're going to put that much man power into a complaint like that, with no proof at all to back it up. They're not going to put manpower into that. It sucks, but unfortunately that's reality.
---
They didnt listen to just you. Everyone had that complaint. Infact i bet u read about the issue before you wrote about it...
---
Interested, two good perks, one medicore yet still nice, not max level tho but overall a worthy roll, I'll buy it if we'll settle for fair price. Lets move the negotiation to DMs :p
---
Hey don't judge, it could be just a French thriller.
---
Yes and this needs fixing cuz it's not supposed to be that way its supposed to just be at the workshop
---
Damn, that sucks. Hopefully your next one is something better :)
---
Wait I just read your previous msg. I'm ps4 :(. Sry.
---
Ya I'm gonna stay away from workshops from now on and stay on passive mode haha
---
Yeah maybe not, I have never held on to any, I was just imagining an unuseful 2*
---
Boosting endurance with armour perks doesn't change your max HP, but every other stat works fine and you can get them above 30 with unyielding and perks. Having 30 perception agility and luck is really amazing for a rifle build. Having almost 50 str is totally bonkers for an unarmed build (I've gotten a bloodied power fist up to 2400 damage without revenant perk)
---
At least you don’t get the loud machine gunning noise on xbone when it crashes the hardware.  Every time it happens its like a year of the processors’ life is taken away.
---
For the love of Mothman, yes. Please this. Yes.
---
Only hard lemonade in mine. I'd prefer screwdrivers but have you seen an orange since the bombs fell? Me neither.
---
If you are on xbox I will trade you. I have those but want other plans
---
Sometimes i sneak in and do this even if I dont try to take it over.  I am a bad person.

It’s 250 wood :( 126 woods in. Keep server hopping between flatwoods and Sylvia logging camp

I’m on PS4 but thanks for the offer!

Also u/MrGlayden I see from other responses you've filed a ticket before as well can you send me that number too?

I imagined a game crash while getting out of the sleeping bag and the item is destroyed at player loggout
---
Did this one time with Gamma Rounds.  Was sneaking with chameleon armor on top of the generator grabbing it as it spawned.  The owner kept coming back and talking on their mic questioning what they were doing wrong lol

there is 7600 wood challenge

No biggie, thanks for letting me know instead of hanging this up :)
---
I want to dual wield Power Fists while dual... wearing power feet?
---
Like a jumping, pseudo-stilt slender man leveling mutants and robots alike!
---
I stopped playing after I accidentally dropped my best gun then the game booted me immediately after before I could pick it back up.
---
I can sell you a complete set for 8000 caps, complete with some mods.
---
Lots of mutants to snipe outside WV lumber mill and Grafton Steel, too.
---
Many events are easy (and redo-able).  Perhaps morgantown airport - you'll get a bunch of scorched kills during that one.  Wade airport also has a lot of mutants.
---
I feel ya, been playing Fallout for a while. I had to stop playin FO NV long time ago (first FO i played) because of the deathclaws, i was much younger than tho. The deathclaws don't feel threatening at all in Fo4 and Fo76. Even those jungle or woodland area creatures are more dangerous.
---
Sounds like a good way to sell weapon paint. Hey you want to protect your best weapons?
---
What? No, not at all. Some weapons literally can't spawn anymore, they've been removed from the loot table. The only ones that will ever exist already do and that's what I meant by legacy. Also level 45 is the level cap for whatever weapon you're talking about... Another thing, weapon level means very little in the face of a good legendary roll. I have a lvl 35 rifle that is far superior to all of my lvl 45-50 rifles.
---
Patrolling the Mojave makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
I accidentally dropped a 3 star Auto grenade launcher in a similar fashion. Figured it was gone.
---
Then i remembered the trick of dropping something else and the bags combining, and in there was my launcher!
---
But my god we need to be able to lock favorites.
---
Stop eating sheeps !
---
Why would you list it backwards like that? It makes no sense.
---
Or a sheep?
---
Bloody DGC, which come June everyone will have lol
---
Or a sheep
---
Would be so cool to be able to repair those bicycles you see around the place and be able to travel abit faster around Appalachia :)
---
Ah bummer. And no problem. I've been farming the free range event as well. I've done it 20times since yesterday and have messaged over 100 people to let them know its happening. So I feel ya on not getting what you want.
---
[Every animal kept for breeding has that.](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/861761529359638528/MuqZV1Hs_400x400.jpg)
---
So I would first suggest not taking workshops if you don't want to PvP. I avoid it a lot because it's all about getting the drop on someone or who has the better toys. I skipped it almost completely until I was 100+.
---
If you do want to take one get Contractor and Home Defense. Contractor helps *so much* in making your resources from a workshop go a long way. If you prepare well you can build yourself a safe structure to hide in, stock up on gears/oil/aluminum and easily put down the max amount missile turrets. They are a nice deterrent, but not as nice as having them and a team. Team up! Most people I've run into that see a workshop with max turrets and defensive structures built, multiple people running around, *do* think twice. Obviously you could still get outplayed by a group but that's another story.
---
Yeah bad translation its the spawn
---
So I didn’t find any info out fo76 about Sheepsquatch that he probably mutated animal. We’ve got new clue!!
---
Depends on the mods, but let's talk!
---
It's actually the opposite, which is why energy weapons do less damage than ballistic guns. Most wildlife has less energy resistance than physical, with deathclaws being a notable exception. They have like twice as much energy resistance as they do physical. Super mutants also have less ER than DR. The only common enemy I found with more ER than DR are higher level ghouls.
---
Always been a fan of the bloodied powerfist myself but DCG is OP
---
unsub
---
An excellent idea, though I can imagine the bugs associated with this deleting our fleets of three star items randomly. :/
---
I once dropped an anti-armor explosive gatling plasma and just died a little inside. Now this was awhile ago when plasma weapons were broken as hell and almost unusable but the roll was great. 
---
Been looking for an Ultracite gatling laser to replace it ever since but no luck there
---
Bring back Deathclaw packs like in New Vegas. Always scared the pants out of me.
---
Mirelurk Kings and Queens as well as some Assaultrons give me a hard time (Level 100 here)
---
Those Gunshots of his really enrage me to the point of mindless murder in the game.
---
I'm left-handed too and to be honest in games that let you switch (division for example) it seems odd and makes it more difficult because I've been so programmed by all of these right handed shooters for so long.
---
Thanks a lot! I'll try some of those things out
---
The Division
---
Yea I’m surprised Beth is givin us one in the survival challenges.
---
Every Zelda game aside from the motion controlled ones on the Wii, all had him using his left hand instead of right hand.
---
Always a risk with our beloved Bethesda lol.
---
I went months without any griefers so it’s hard to complain but since last week I’m encountering them almost daily now.  Seems to be becoming more popular or just my luck maybe idk.  I ignore all I can, block and server hop but it gets old.
---
The deathclaw should become stronfer like dubble the hp and double the damage
---
I'm still looking in every paper bag I see, but it's a nice idea.
---
Some of the best perk cards are not available before level 50.  That means you need at least a few levels after 50 to be on equal ground.  at level 150 I am still building different cards to different levels for multiple setups. like i need a level 5 gunsmithing to craft, but a 2\* works better in the field.
---
Like Mr. PrizeBot? Mr. MailBot?
---
where did you get a ring?
---
Wow that’s awesome. This community makes me have real hope!!
---
Or maybe it could trigger like the explosion when you decide to root out the Institute in Fallout 4?
---
Thanks 😊
---
Same here. Some random post mentioned the nv lens with an atom challenge
---
I’m not subscribed to this sub.
---
The LMG has a lot of slots for mods but only a prime receiver is in the game at the moment
---
Although Nukashine is every bit as cool (despite the silly name).
---
I forgot to mention, lock your extractors! Doing so makes people wanted if they steal so the added defenses will *really* deter them. That and always be crouching to hide at a workshop. Some people are only interested in your caps or PvP but if nobody can see you're there you're more likely to get left alone, or the drop on them first.
---
I do the same thing with my important guns. We need more paints.
---
Diablo 2 added in updates for over 5 years after it launched, and the b.net servers for the game were kept online for over a decade. They didn't have any "dlc" just a single expansion pack that added a whole new act, multiple new characters, and tons of new items.
---
Thanks for the tip on the science perk. I have them max'd, but never thought to check while building radium rifles. I owe you one. Great spreadsheet too.
---
Will do. When I get out of work today that is....
---
Thank you for the response.
---
the lemonade stand is adding hot wings to the menu
---
Do you sometimes feel like you don't have partner , or that you are alone except for the city that you live in.
---
not a bad thing to have. 15 adhesive is necessary for sheepsquatch staff lv 50 plus mod. craft and sell my dude
---
like my grandma always said, "Don't start none, won't be none"
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
That's awful man. :( explosive energy weapons no longer drop.
---
The one for the lever actually looks really good..I just got a pretty rare hunting rifle..and there's no paint for that..it's gonna stay in my stash box for now lol
---
Does this still work as I dropped two sets of stuff a few days back and I'm sure there were two different bags
---
Diablo 2 had no microtransactions and they kept the b.net servers running for over a decade after it launched with zero microtransactions, and no pay 2 play crap. Literally buy the game and you get access to the b.net servers to play online on.
---
i might get it for the legendary vendor
---
Agreed. I wish there was a 'suggestions' sticky where everyone can talk about how they want a polka dot bandana or whatever.
---
Looks cool as hell but it seems like it would be too much of a hassle.
---
Diablo 2 was free, warcraft 3 was free, guildwars 1 was free after buying the game, GW2 was free after buying the game. Want me to keep listing more? Because I easily could list at least another 30.
---
What platform? 
---
If you're on PC, you can contact tech support they'll suggest the standard stuff: update drivers, scan and repair game files, run as administrator. It's worth a try, but probably won't help.   
---
Yeah, it varies by patch, but FO76 still has big stability problems.
---
Yeah that’s the worse part, I’ve always loved energy weapons. Probably would have already gotten a new one with a decent roll but with all my friends having quit I’ve had so little drive to play anymore
---
Looks cool.  I wonder if you'd see as many attacks if you *just* had the hole in the road as your entrance, instead of also having the river one.
---
What? Yes they did. Look at diablo 2 as a prime example, they were still adding content to it literally a decade after it came out and the b.net servers were free to play on and were kept open until everyone stopped playing.
---
Yeah I'm already doing those 2 things, currently sat in a corner hoping this level 304 guy doesn't ruin my day
---
Does it count as casual, wondering if it can be modded
---
I agree 110%, would be awsome!
---
Previous games had no problem running servers for decades without needing to add microtransactions. Battle.net is a prime example. Diablo 2's servers were kept online until basically everyone quit playing the game, it still had the servers running when d3 came out and after it came out.
---
Mutations. Marsupial and speed demon alone make the game so much more fun.
---
You probably didn’t deal much damage to it
---
This is literally the only time I take people’s junk too. But it is necessary!
---
weeeeird
---
You put way too much time and effort into this... And we all thank you for it.
---
"Now available in the Atomic Shop for only 100,000 atoms for a limited time!"
---
Sure there are costs, but nowhere near as much as they are acting like it costs. They definitely don't need to have these ridiculous microtransactions. Look at games like diablo 2 that had their servers up and running for decades after the game came out and even when d3 was released. They still kept the d2 servers up even though it was competing with their new game. 
---
They were able to do that without charging people, and were still able to put out content regularly even 7 years after the game came out. All for free.
---
Its ok, if your pants laigh and get ruined you can just dupe some more pants, ya duper !!!
---
Yep I wanted to make a small village with my friends. I saw some players build on the same street and it looked pretty cool though, like they were neighbors.
---
That's an ear tag for a ram/sheep.
---
Probably why it's a *sheep*squatch, and not a *cow*squatch.
---
A sheep actually, another redditor already traced the serial number to a google stock image of a goat.
---
The burrows Outfit was the rescues  divers outfit from far harbour
---
loø, yeah, that happens, hahaha :D
---
Yeah I’m sorry
---
I have been able to run into the "secure" area of the train station vendor bots, when server is  lagging and stuff is still loading after you spawn in or fast travel. 
---
You get stuck in there though when fully loaded, I don't think I was able to use PA to escape either.
---
I have a max level AA/50 pct limb dmg lever action. Love that gun!  The limb damage is just a ton of fun. 
---
I also have a vampire/ss assaultron blade that just wrecks.
---
I wish they would give us a build a bunker option. I like this, but I grow a lot of food. I am north of Flatwoods along the river. Low level area, so I don't really need much in the way of security. 
---
This is pretty ingenious.
---
I haven’t tried this yet but can you rename the PA chassis? Having more than 1 in your inventory is really annoying because of that imo.
---
Too bad for them all this action does is push people who would normally buy Atoms away from buying them. Why would I buy atoms when there are no good items worth buying in the atom shop? 
---
I am an adult with a life so I can't be just logging in every day or even every other day. So all they are doing is limiting the people who have the opportunity to buy it to only be people that have neough free time to log in and check the shop every day. 
---
Most adults that can and would be willing to buy atoms don't check the shop everyday, because we have work, family, and other obligations. So they are literally taking their best skins and making them unavailable to the people who are most likely to spend money.
---
Under walls or floor decorations
---
You must be super lucky. I've been running that event 3-4 times trying to get all the plans, and I've never even seen a 2*, let alone a 3*.
---
Wade airport is so underrated. It's really great for low levels. Yeah, it's a workshop but you don't have to take it if one's worried about PvP. Sure, not a metric ton of muties, but enough to bag some XP, and so much junk around. The place even has Power Armor out in the open (and another set if you have expert lockpick), as well as a mod and a plan usually.
---
Keep in mind it's hunter *or* spawn.
---
I will say that I also built some mirv grenades and they do absolutely wreck shit! I was doing AWOL the other day, there were like 5 of us, the second wave of gutsys spawned so I chucked one in the crowd. It wasted them all! Everyone was like,”wtf bro!? Who did that!?” I felt bad but of coarse I didn’t say anything. Lol
---
Man if they put oranges in we could make orange chicken
---
:)
---
Uh, definitely at least new Vegas. New Vegas deathclaws were way scarier than 3 deathclaws.
---
I have once on accident, probably was a bug but
---
Yeah I know, I meant that I thought the glowing wendigo is weaker and the gutsy stronger than you said, either way I'm sure character build affects this too.
---
Yeah just inspect the chassis and the rename option will be there.
---
Welcome to fallout 76... the long grind for the 1 in a million good legendary drop.
---
But what if I don't like my unexpected neighbors?  I build off the beaten path because I like the feeling I'm alone surviving.  I don't want to be borrowing sugar.
---
Not always. I stumbled across a CAMP that was being attacked by zombies, so I shot at them and accidentally shot a wall of the CAMP and got a bounty.
---
you need to go buy some lottery tickets NOW!!!!!
---
You can do this from the inspect screen in your inventory, just inspect --&gt; rename. Nothing to be nervous about.
---
Really need an app similar to Destiny that allows you to view gear and move it between characters. That's an app I would actually pay for.
---
The bears aren't too bad... as long as you start killing them from a distance and finish them off before they bum rush you. Otherwise prepare to be uh... bear slapped.  To death.
---
**For fun:** 
---
1. Quad double-barrel shotguns are hilariously fun. They just dump damage. If you haven't tried one, you're missing out. 
---
2. Anything explosive. The explosive effect is just so satisfying and percussive.  
---
**For effectiveness**, it's mostly about matching legendary effects to the right weapon: 
---
* Bloodied is good on any weapon, if you're willing to pay the cost of being at low health. 
---
* Quad is great on low capacity weapons like double barrel shotguns and cryolators. 
---
* Instigating is wonderful for clear-speed, when you're solo and using a weapon that hits hard (hunting rifle, lever action or most melee). 
---
* Furious rarely shines, but is great on miniguns. 
---
**As for why we under-value instigating explosive weapons**, it's because there's lots of weapons that can clear Whitespring or Westek fast. There aren't many weapons that put a dent in the SBQ. The sustained high-damage weapons are the ones at a premium because there aren't many alternatives.
---
That’s one possibility. Or it’s intentionally glitched. I killed two noxious sheepsquatches by myself yesterday, one didn’t drop anything special, just bones and meat, the other dropped a piece of wood armor. This has happened to SBQ, sheepsquatch assaultron and even gutsys in awol event. It’s not hard to tell that the management at Bethesda simply doesn’t want people to fight bosses, they want us to farm at WS instead.
---
I've got a quad..just got to master the situations where I use it lol
---
Floor decor. But there is only one type (with a sink).
---
Rifleman Perks, Bloody Mess would all boost your dmg. Bloody mess boosts all Dmg, Rifleman of course only boosts rifles, but it has 3 different cards each having 3 ranks. So iirc you can get up to +60% rifle dmg with all 3. Unless they changed the rank %'s.
---
Thank you!
---
No they don't.  I've found more lvl 9 spawns lately there and it's killing me.  I'm lvl 110.
---
I get what you’re saying but I am slightly biased and besides, they don’t have to be the top, but they should at least still be among the most scary you meet. I don’t expect them to be stronger than the SBQ, but they could at least be scarier than the cave crickets and mirelurk king and various other monsters that it at least equivalent sized to.
---
Sorry im on xbox but thanks for offering your help
---
Or a sheep.
---
yup.  Was part of my regular route when I as farming fusion cores and XP.  
---
2nd set of armor?  
---
Found the first set, but not the 2nd...but then again, last time I was there, I only had L2 lockpick,not L3.
---
Yeah, shits a bit hectic when there are too many. :(
---
I also had a 3 star spawn for me when I was doing the event by myself. That was one heck of a fight but fun!
---
My base is near one of those tiny fissures that you cannot fast travel to. It regularly spawns a level 80 Scorchbeast so I walk over there regularly to kill her and steal her meats.  No power armor, just me, my gauss rifle, and my modded death claw gauntlet.
---
She's easy. Maybe have to pop a stimpak if I forget to kill all her little scorchie-minions.
---
But Gutsy? Gutsy is a beast.
---
&gt; I know this is a joke, but dual wielding pistols would actually make them ~~worth using.~~ OP.
---
Pistols are worth using right now. If you're into cheese and you can get a couple good black powder pistols you can straight eliminate stuff by switching back and forth instead of reloading. My pistoleer has an instigating black powder and an executioner black powder in case I didn't 1 shot whatever mob with my instigating. I also have a bloodied revolver for longer fights.
---
Black powder shenanigans aside, pistols get a massively bad rep because early on they're weaker early on due to no pen perks, but later on penetration isn't much of a big deal. Once you get past certain damage thresholds penetration doesn't do anything, so if you do a stealth/crit/vats pistol build you can actually make pistols as strong as anything else. If you could dual wield them, they would be ridiculous unless the akimbo came with massive drawbacks.
---
Thank you! Just whenever you get a chance to, no rush!
---
I think once they nerfed survival more people merged back over into adventure. Its been happening more often as of recent. And people who hunt down work shop owners just get some pvp! That also pisses me off. “I just want some fusion cores bro, you can have some too! There’s enough for everyone!”
---
So true.....im level 242..i think. And aside from a few events, like the Fashnat parade, and hunting BOS plans....everything past level 75 was hunting legendarys in some form or another.      Good luck OP, start trading, and dont get tunnel vision for sentinel armor or whatever. Theres good stuff put there
---
Your grandma was a straight G. 💪
---
I only have trouble with those if I cannot VAT to target them since they move around a lot.  I run mostly with a fist/melee build (Modded Mole Miner or Death Claw gauntlet, or a Power Fist) or my gauss rifle.  The melee weapons usually 1-shot the little bugs.
---
It's random. I've had decent luck at vendors around nuke zones and events like uranium fever though. After they nerfed tse weapons I got a tse handmade from the trainstation in whitespring that is now my buddy's main weapon. 😁 I had a streak of getting good weapons for a day or two but then it's right back to nocturnal pool cues for a few weeks
---
That’s probably because low level players showed up earlier and spawned level 9 ghouls. Many low level players go there for easy farming.
---
its very odd that skyrim supports dual wield but fo4 and 76 dont
---
It's also not limited by one week so there's no rush just to collect a few atoms
---
I don't take it seriously at all. I'm just describing the marketing plan behind the price of the skins.
---
The queen usually drops the decent level 50 legendarys
---
Hi, it's me, upvoting your shitty pun 4 months later. Have a nice day!
---
why does the paint prevent this from happening?
---
At level 10 I'd stay around flat woods and milk that clean. Shoot and cook all animals for more xp. Do a few main quests but take them slow. Reason is a few quests give special weapons and the lower you are the lower level the weapon.
---
I blew through all my quests and dropped my 1st nuke at level 37 or so. By speed rushing all the quests all my special drops were low. I love my All Rise but I recently had to buy a max level because I was rewarded with a 30 when I finished Mayor For A Day.
---
Maybe it does require master, . . . can't remember. Locked truck (blue I think) at the end of the tarmac, southwest corner. Never opened it.
---
My camp! Lol!
---
I've lost multiple pieces of PA and regular armor while fast traveling, or between logins :(  
---
On the upside, it hasn't happened to me in well over a month now. Maybe over two.
---
She's just as random as anyone else
---
Now this is just me. . . . Make your way towards whitespring, specifically the golf course. There you can jump up on a ledge and shoot gouls through a window. Slow but its decent experience. Make sure and pick up some levels on the way.
---
I agree! make Deathclaws tough again! I want to see one and feel scared and consider choosing a different route, THAT is how tough they need to be!
---
anywhere if you dont pick up loot. there is no repercussions from dieing other than junk lose. suicide bomb if you want!
---
Contractor (2) will make it so you're not spending many of your own gears and screws. You should mostly just spend the workshop's supplies to build your defenses.   
---
If it's not obvious, crouch as often as possible to keep your icon off the map, and keep moving. If you know the name of your attacker, block them for the session, so they cannot track you. If you suspect it's a group, block all of them. Spend as little time at the workshop as you can.   
---
Lastly, if you pull four or more 100% cores, they should last you awhile. You probably can call that a win.
---
i know this is unrelated, however i was just wondering how u guys got factions with ur profiles, becuase i was wondering if that is still available
---
Lol I still don’t know whether we’re supposed to look through the tiny little hole or above it
---
It works if the first bag is fresh and you haven't traveled and returned. I did it yesterday while dropping ammo at Whitesprings Station. PC.
---
This really shows how dumb their management is. Truckload of hairstyles tuxedos and emotes in a wasteland shooting game but no skins for weapons. The head of the sales is probably 80 years old and never play their own games.
---
hehhehe i have a CAMP right near the Overseer CAMP so noobs will be whisked away across the map heehhe
---
I want the game to be more challenging, period. I've basically stopped playing since nothing is really presenting a challenge to me anymore.
---
Found mine at that fair in the top left corner. Not the water park but the ferris-wheel carnival. He was just sitting in a chair in a large group of chairs.
---
Someone tried to trade me for my exploding \*\*\* gatling laser this morning. I laughed in 120%.
---
I waited and watched other higher lvl players come and go and lvl9 for at least an hour.  I was holding a game open for a friend to switch mules.  Never got anything over lvl 9.  Maybe it was bad luck, but I've seen more low levels lately there.
---
I mean I've ran uranium fever and AWOL, and got decent legendary drops, none level 50 though. I ran the queen a couple times in a row and got a level 50 3* explosive hunting rifle, and then a level 50 3* Tesla rifle. The queen just seems to drop better stuff
---
I have 600 hours in the game any 3-star level 50 mob can drop the same legendaries as the queen she's not special
---
Cant drop painted weapon
---
They could be tougher, that's for sure. Shortly after my comment, I logged on for a session. Fought my first mirelurk queen in this game and didn't get touched, though that was probably because I outsmarted her and just ran around a shack dropping MIRV grenades. 4 of those puppies at 5x explosive perk was all it took. She was roughly at my level ~60ish. I walked just across the street and fought a lvl 91 glowing deathclaw, and again he never even got close to me. I crippled him with a plasma grenade, and all he could do was shuffle slowly towards me, easy pickins. 
---
I think what makes them so easy is that they are huge and relatively slow. I've heard the mirelurk queen's poison is crazy, but she launched it at me once, missed, and never got the chance again. They are so big, so easy to hit even with grenades, so they drop fast. 
---
Then enemies that currently mess my world up are wendigos and assaultrons. Small frames, fast, high damage output. They can't take much of a beating, but they are really hard to hit. 
---
Do melee players feel the same? Or are the deathclaws and mirelurks tougher because they have to get in on them?
---
or...a sheep?
---
stay to the forest region and had more in the direction of the savage divide the dry lakebed and the charleston region are good locations to grind and morgantown is good too expecially the events there
---
also what really offers a lot of low level enemies are the powerplants there are plenty of scorched to kill without a high risk of beeing swarmed
---
This is pretty frustrating so 100% for this!
---
My partner's camp is on a small lake/pond with an acid resource and probably 50% of the time her camp cannot be placed. She doesn't want to move, it's a good spot. 
---
So on a few occasiobs she stayed on the server and went to see what was there. Confused sometimes because NOTHING was on that spot. What was however is someone's camp on the next lake and not even visible from her spot. Frustrating as hell, the no build buffer is about the size of an entire camp build site!
---
What is annoying also about not being able to place your camp is that "pets" are lost and you have to go find and tame them again. She is on her 2nd Megasloth now due to that bug.
---
The thing is, if the high level players came and saw a bunch of level 9 ghouls then they left without killing them, the guys came after them can’t spawn new ghouls because the lvl 9 ghouls are still there. I do that all the time, when i see low lvl spawns i simply leave and not waste my time.
---
Yes
---
I’ve seen it in two places. In the car park of wavy willards and in front of the mothman statue in point pleasant. But yea I agree, it’s a dumb way to start a mission line, server hopping is becoming the norm now
---
She drops the good plans though on top of the legendary drop. With over 600 hours myself and every achievement, legendary farming is all that's left until more content comes out
---
i think most people just want the servers to be fixed and stable, and the bugs killed
---
you cannot trade atom shop painted items. So if you go to drop it, trade it or sell it, it will not let you. If you try to drop it, you get a warning that the item will be destroyed. A second check to prevent what the OP did.
---
In fact, it does not show up in your trade window.
---
Considering the handmade has 48 mods, it's your expectation that you be given a specific mod after only 20-25 times, that might be unrealistic. 
---
There are plenty of us interested in crafting, that have invested the time, and screws to unlock everything for any given gun. You can always ask for modification, if you don't want to do it yourself.
---
Creative. I like it.
---
Some what In the vein of this, i have a quad lever action and a quad explosive shotgun,  I have noticed in fast traveling that I will show up with no ammo loaded and will have hand load these 2 over and over upon loading in even if they had rounds loaded before the warp.
---
It was a shame that the mother bloodworm wasn't an enemy like the strangler heart. Some big fat worm with a super high health pool that you had to drain while you were attacked by hundreds of bloodworms
---
How is it that Mr Gutsy's are so over powered... irritates me, lol
---
What plans lol.   They removed serums and the power armour is a joke.
---
My friend had his first experience with something similar yesterday. We do the Sheepsquanch event and the guy who started it went afk as we arrived. The cows were already dead and then afk guy dies. My buddy goes and looks in his bag only to find 200lbs of bulked junk. I don't know what that guy was thinking, but thank you for the plastic :)
---
Adrenaline, Tenderizer , Bloody mess , Nerd Rage all boost damage undernoric conditions. Revenant is helpful in an Sbq/encrypted encounter with others around to stimpak you, follow up with whatever weapon style perk ie: rifle /2h
---
I think they stealth nerfed the legendary drop rates since December or so. Although I did get a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet to drop just recently. But I'm level 190ish.
---
so what i read a lot about and it also really seems to be the case for me at least is that the legendarys you have on you as well as in your stash box are determining the kind of legendarys you get (if you want a two shot weapon safe every twoshot weapon no matter wich level in your stash and clear out your stash of all the trash legendarys you dont need or want to) it significantly boosts the likelyhood of other twoshot drops
---
The farm just south of watoga station is where I did it. Just sneak around back, wake up the queen in the pond and make her chase you towards the kings. Prepare to die as you take the pic as I did after I got it lol but it is def possible, just a pain in the ass lol
---
FO76 did a really good job of introducing an entirely new lineup of monsters. Some of them are crazy but pushovers - like that giant bee thing. What does it even do? Also the radtoads. So easy. Then there's wendigos and sometimes snallygasters. Wendigos are such a cool concept, so skinny and hard to hit, with some stagger mechanics and a lot of speed. Very fun fights. Snallygasters are easy unless they are in a pack. And the hermit crabs are fun, too, in a completely different way. Very tough and can really knock you around if they get in close. 
---
These are the monsters that need to be buffed a bit and highlighted. It's cool having deathclaws around because Fallout, but they can definitely take a back seat IMO.
---
I agree your chances are better with the queen, like any given drop is going to be at least decent. But you can't compete with the sheer volume of legendaries that drop at Whitespring, although they've drastically nerfed the number of 3 star ghouls that spawn.
---
You can still find them from other players, they are just very difficult to get ahold of for a reasonable rate. I have personally only ever touched 3 explosive energy weapons. 1 I main, 1 is in storage, and 1 i gave to my mate who doesn't play anymore.
---
Explosive miniguns for boss fights and explosive shotty/harpoon for everything else. Time is most precious in life and those weapons get things done super fast.
---
SHEEPsquatch
---
I would agree with the Explosive weapon part, but my explosive LMG is not really viable due to its low damage per shot versus .308 ammo economy. I wish .308 was easy to farm like it was when the game was released.
---
If the table is below a sloped or low roof the objects end up placing on the roof
---
I don't know where all of them are but this one is north of silo alpha and west of Berkeley springs up in the hills.
---
Almost all my weapons are instigating or furious. My 2 go to weapons as a stealth and sniper build are an instigating pipe rifle, and a instigating deathclaw gauntlet. But I am really starting to like that new .50 Machine gun from the PvP servers last week also. I think it does a good job in Adventure mode.
---
What!!?? If you were going to leave for longer than 30 seconds why wouldn’t you just back out to the main screen? Sheesh... sucks to be that guy FR!
---
Dude, Junkie items are TERRIBLE thank you immensely for this post. IDGAF about doing the weekly now, saved me from a huge disappointment.
---
Additions are lost on death, terrible.
---
I'd recommend getting a cryolator and becoming a support character for the queen fight. You don't even need to spec into it since damage isn't the main goal, you just want to get the freeze effect on her so the heavy hitters can do their thing. Once you get her frozen switch over to your shotgun for mob control, then switch back to cryo when you see the queen has thawed.
---
This should solve your loot problem and get you more XP from killing the mobs.
---
I remember them saying they had tweaked the queen's drops so she would drop \*something.\* But then later they may have said they applied the same tweak to all legendaries, so you're probably right.
---
What I do is camp Sbq lfg religiously , do AWOL Armament every time it’s up and Heart of the Swamp
---
:0
---
Hit events like Uranium Fever that have consistent legendaries.  Farm the Whitepsprings Golf House.  Farm the Burrows.  Pretty much you gotta just keep farming those auto-stim wood chest pieces and furious pipe revolvers until you get something good.
---
I have one of those too and they are really deadly.
---
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Im so @#$@#$ tired of people on this sub ridiculing and downvoting anyone who brings this up!!!!!!!!
---
now we have proof and the Beth devs have commented about it
---
now, we can let the healing process begin
---
I hope all of you who downvoted, talked shit, and claimed we were "lying" about this bug feel horrible for being horrible people to us all, all we were doing was reporting bugs so the game can get fixed
---
*whew* I feel vindicated today
---
1) Be on a team
---
2) Dashboard farm every TEN MINUTES, no sooner
---
3) Make sure no one is in the cell you are targeting before you head over there
---
It’s not so bad when you figure out you can just hang out in the building next to the museum and shoot at him and he can’t even touch you.
---
Holy fucknuckles. That seems like such a random side effect of painting something but is so helpful.
---
Ask a middleman
---
Bad question, real question is what armor or weapons do you have to trade. No ones taking caps for a lot of higher tier armors but good luck idk much about weight redux you might be ok but it’s probably going to cost you 20k+ probably  if you’re on Xbox (I am too) full sets of armor especially ones with 3* are gonna be max caps/reads only every time
---
LOVE this! The hole entrance is just brilliant!
---
I feel no remorse for people who mooch events. I dunno what he was thinking tho. I always close application if I gotta run in a hurry.
---
 Die a ~~little~~ lot inside.  Fixed it for you XD
---
I have all but left arm full set mix all 3 star.
---
Well, if it makes you feel any better I called Bethesda to clarify and I am waiting on their response.
---
It's so you can't give other players premium paint jobs if I had to guess
---
Yeah, I've had the same thing happen when some level 300 dude did all the damage to it. There must be some minimum amount of damage you have to do, and if someone else is taking her all the way down in 3 minutes you're not going to have the time to get in enough licks of your own.
---
Personally I think that's BS and this is a bug and it should be fixed.
---
..... there’s nothing to clarify?
---
Best thing to do is just log back in
---
I've lost quite a few pieces of regular armor as well. Nothing recently, thankfully. 
---
They really need a system to tag items to prevent dropping, trading, etc. I'm terrified my Beret and Hunter's Longcoat are going to vanish on me someday for reasons only known to the Flatwoods Monster.
---
actually it seemed to me only the ones it happened to believed it- many many many people on this sub outright attacked anyone who even claimed this was an issue
---
its great we can finally all acknowledge we werent "lying" about it
---
that shitty knife isn't worth it anyway
---
Oh yea for sure! If I go take a piss or drop a deuce, I Jump back to my camp and go to sleep just to be safe.
---
There is more to this than that. You are also claiming that you can use that disc across multiple accounts. Everything I have seen states the opposite in the ToS and the FAQ 
---
I will post again when I hear back from Bethesda.
---
sneaky commando is one of the highest DPS builds for PvE and even more with the BE Handmade you owe
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds, run leader of the pack and wolf horde when they proc for level 5-10 legendarys and decent xp
---
i wonder if paint jobs also affect it...?
---
I shoot him at first sight now! He never seems to find me when I am just walking around doing my daily grind...oh no no no... He has to wait until I am trying to be in stealth and give me away or worst yet when I am in the middle of a high level mob. That is the only time I will ever hear CONGRATULATIONS it seems. So know it is an instant bullet to his chrome dome!
---
Thanks op. I Appreciate it.
---
Just did this with an alt, my main techniques were to keep to the forest, take two workshops, and do their defense missions without turrets; Pick workshops that have resources you need.
---
Another technique is to pick areas and clear them of enemies. Summerville is good for your level. Farm Leader of the Pack and Forest Horde events as the first drops three legendaries per event!
---
There absolutely is. 
---
The ability to use a single purchased copy of the game across multiple bethesda.net accounts.
---
fyi mysterious savior and life saving armor also proc revenant so you don't even need someone to revive you
---
You clearly don’t understand how console gaming works.  It’s a disc! A physical copy.  You play it on one PS4. Take it out. And play it on another PS4!  I can no longer fathom what you don’t get about that?!?!?
---
I have only ever seen that stand twice! My RNG luck for him is not good.
---
I figured it would work just like naming an item - it's named for you, but once it changes hands it reverts to default name/paint/skin, only mods are kept. But I guess in a way the paint is treated like a mod in functionality never thought it through as they haven't released paint or a skin for a single gun I use...
---
This happened to me before with two scorch beasts and a mothman, they just dont want you getting comfortable I guess
---
This has definitely been reported as a bug with the bloodied effect. This is the first I've seen with instigating but it wouldn't surprise me if you're correct.
---
did something push you?
---
Remember, vaccines are bad.
---
I'm hoping Fallout 5 adopts the season system like Forza Horizon 4.
---
They break too fast, except for the Tesla rifle
---
Found mine at Tyler County Fairgrounds (big Ferris wheel above DC Island).  There’s a seating area with about 3 rows of seats in one of the sections and he was in the front row
---
What do you means by “good legendary”?  God roll?  The types you see traded for big caps? I got “good” drops but it was 381 hours before I got a great one. Bloody explosive pump. But I got other good drops. A lot of melee but one I’ve kept over 300 hrs.
---
You have to slow your DPS for the event to finish correctly. I usually shoot, wait, shoot, wait, etc.., and I haven't had it bug out on me.
---
I went to the giant tea pot and server hopped. took me like 5 minutes. Tourist is dead on one of the pinic tables.
---
Accurate post is accurate.
---
Good to know :) thx
---
Yeah.... once again. Bethesda account is free.  You buy the game. It’s a disc.  If you want to bring it back to game stop. You do so.  They sell it used. Next player buys it. And signs into their Bethesda account.    You can no longer play it. As you’ve sold the disc.  It’s gone.  Now they have it.  They can play.
---
playing solo, you dont need too many points in charisma - most of those are for team.  
---
Lone Wander and Tenderizer are the only 2 Ch perks I use.  Swap out hard bargain when I trade.
---
Good with salt (luck) helps early (slows food spoilage) until you get good doggy and a supply of dog food)
---
Other than that, do you know if you want to use mainly rifle (auto or not), shotgun, pistol, big gun, 
---
energy weapon, or melee (1hand or 2)?  There are multiple perks dedicated to each weapon class, and some subdivision within.
---
That choice will dictate the perks you choose as you level up.  
---
In previous version of FO, I was always a gunner.  
---
For 76, I chose the perks that benefited me at the time I selected them...
---
and ended up as a 1H melee, with sniper as a secondary skill.
---
Completely different play style than I was used to, but I've come to really like it :)
---
Can you explain a little about the bloodied buzz blade and Queen? I run unarmed on a toon and recently picked up a 3\* bloodied buzz blade but haven't used it.
---
Yeah inflation from aholes asking for 60,000 Caps is ridiculous
---
i understand that the dupers have all the best weapons and "caps are meaningless" to those special few who have been cheating the system with duped gear, but the rest of us, normal players who dont play 8 hours a day, those prices are @$#@$@%% stupid
---
I don’t get why the fuck does he hit so hard he kills my health in power armour!!
---
They'd probably just show up and shoot at walls, which I think is a really dumb mechanic and needs to be removed. Mob attacks on player built items needs to be revised to make sense. Sure, shoot a generator or melee some crops. maybe bust in a door and break some storage containers. But why is this asshole standing 200 yards away taking pot shots at a metal wall?
---
200 yards is 182.88 meters
---
Yes because getting laid makes everything in life great and nothing bothers you /s - proud father
---
Yea mainly stuff like that but damn that’s some hot stuff
---
Ok thx for your help 👍
---
Yes, this is old news
---
Yep it has happened to me... I have an awesome pic on the photo group on XB1
---
its bad for me on ps4 as well, at least 2-3 crashes a night, usually the game freezes for me when im trying to eat or drinks something from my inventory
---
the whole game freezes at that inventory screen
---
My latest character I tried to RP as a kind of bridge troll, always building my camps on/under bridges. I gave up because of how weird the bridges behave in terms of placing CAMP items around them. It was so tough to get everything positioned in a way that the system would accept, only to log in one day and find out the game decided the space was taken after all and the whole CAMP is gone. 
---
Kudos to getting this to work. I know it takes a long time and a ton of trial and error.
---
It doesnt really provide anything worth 4.99$
---
I had a bloodied fire axe with ss and +1 strength vanish from my stash. This was a drop not trade so no chance it was duped. Fruends have had recent similar vanished items
---
Yeah a scorched did. While I was looting the SB, for some stupid reason hesitated and in those few seconds I was pushed off.
---
Or sometimes it glitches under texture
---
I just had a camp on top of that bridge, on the side furthest from the steakhouse, and those assholes were constantly shooting at my stuff. Got some crappy legendaries out of it before I decided to move, so...there's that.
---
You need a good low health build and melee perks to make it effective. I'd you have that, expect to do around 500 damage per hit with very rapid hits. It's way more effective than a super sledge on the queen
---
I want dual combat knives!  
---
I literally don't care if they cut the overall damage in half or something -- I just want the aesthetics of it.
---
REALLY THATS A THING? Wow ok thanks mate
---
I accidentally shot prize bot one day while in a fight with a gang of nasty mutants near the pylon / bog town. I was fighting for my life and when I turned quickly he got vatted hehe. Also I met insult bot once and when I interacted he said he was off duty which itself felt slightly insulting 😁
---
Are you talking about the no rads in a nuke zone PA glitch?
---
I have 4 weapons redux pieces
---
And the full set of junk redux as well , 3 stars only trading for god tier as well.
---
Because who can pay 200 k caps
---
"Oh youre at your base just crafting things before goiing out again? Would be a shame if someone just destroyed your camp" pretty much
---
It doesn’t help that Bethesda is stealth nerfing the drop rate. Putting the Watoga robots in an exclusion table so they won’t spawn as legendary was low. Changing the spawn at Whitespring from player spawn to a timer was dirty. It’s literally like they are trying to suck the fun out of the game.
---
You got a left arm weapon redux?
---
I know you can’t scrap renamed items
---
Welcome to the grind.
---
I loved killing them unarmed
---
Maybe, but not everyone can just craft their dream item, if by that you mean crafting them in a way that lets you choose the legendary prefixes.
---
I absolutely understand how it works. Please stop slinging insults.
---
Missle turrets help a lot defending workshops
---
completely organic!
---
Lmao!! This did cross my mind.
---
its easy! all you have to have is 60,000 caps across multiple characters and you can buy one!    /s
---
i agree, its frustrating, and now it seems Bethesda is trying to limit legendaries (removing them from watoga for starters)
---
and 99% of what DO you get is crap 1 star stuff
---
and if you want to buy a good gun, unfortunately there are aholes charging an ungodly amount of caps for weapons that are most likely duped anyway
---
im loking forward to player vending to see what gems we can find!
---
It doesn’t really help in this situation, but going forward I’ll tell you what I do. Since we can rename things now, I rename everything with an “*” at the beginning, this defaults everything I wanna keep to the top. For example “*vampire lever action”, alternatively, you can name everything with an ”/“ at the beginning, and it’ll default to the bottom.
---
Last night when I was selling items to a vendor in White Spring my menu items kept cycling up and down it stopped when I exited the vendor trade menu I also play on PS4.
---
yeah you just got lucky, its all RNG
---
you just as likely could have gotten a drill and then a syringer- BUT! im glad you did get some good loot!
---
You do this from the drop down on the main subreddit. Upper right corner on mobile. Cheers!!
---
Oh forgot to mention, it's like other melee weapons where when you over repair it it does more damage. Just with buzz blades it roughly doubles the damage
---
I’m not trying to Insult you. But you asked a question.  I’ve answered it. And you keep telling me I’m wrong and I can’t be telling you the truth and I’m breaking tos. Like clearly pc digital copies aren’t the same as physical PS4 copies.  I don’t understand why you care so much?  If someone wants a used copy of fo76 for PS4. They can most certainly walk into a store. Buy it.  And have it work perfectly fine.  End of story.
---
I am heavy weapons guy
---
Some of y'all never played Fallout 1 and it shows.
---
Fallout 4 Anglers/Fog Crawlers
---
Maybe... I just think the explosion should be bigger
---
I’m leaning to more god roll ish stuff like 2 shots and explosive shots and Ect, I am willing to trade to if anyone can
---
Or a automatic weapon
---
That shit has been happening to me a lot lately too and it's always the low level people with overpowered explosive weapons. PVP seems to be very broken in the normal game, last night especially at Whitespring some guy two shot me while I was checking my menu. Never engaged him, not in PVP zone, no bounty, nothing. Yet he killed me almost instantly, I lost 200 caps and all my junk which nearby people flocked to. All my balistic fiber, dozens a gears, screws, adhesive and so on. Gone.
---
did the wood collection work correctly? I have about 2000 pieces of 250 logs to collect.
---
The task should be renamed in: search 250 tree trunks
---
Calibrated shocks mods.
---
If i got my hand on any sentinel assasin gear i would let it go for 25k too.
---
Oh got i hope they increase bottlecap cap, cause i have loads of fastnach plans i will sell later.
---
? you can put a drink on punch bowls?
---
It looks like Fallout 40K so gothic retro futurism in the grim darkness of the near future?
---
So your saying there's a chance that the Sheepsquatch was a cow?
---
Is this confirmed? I have multiple faster swing speed and antiarmor weapons in my stash and on my player that I have randomly gotten from hours of grinding and have gotten the worse drops of my entire game play as of lately.
---
I do like my two shot explosive dragon lol
---
adventure definitely needs to keep __workshop__ pvp in/around the __workshop__ that's being contested
---
Wait a second... Instigating and 2 Shot legendary effects use the same spot, they can't both be applied to the same weapon. So how do you have an Instigating 2 Shot Black Powder Rifle?
---
I use Camden park to level up my alt's, nice range of levels and quite a few enemies and loot.
---
Maybe I missed it but what system are you on?
---
lol, no way, you are mega unlucky.
---
Right with you there! SBQ loot pool kind of makes her a waste of time besides some plans
---
&gt; cowsquatch.
---
I'd love to see a cowsquatch with a milk attack like in [Kung Pow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLcu5BwDws)
---
And again again, it just works.
---
Thats a nice rifle
---
\+karma thanks
---
I've had experience with this exact spot and it's tough with The General's Steakhouse there
---
[I built a diner camp way back](https://imgur.com/pTdUBJZ) and would come home to have the back of it destroyed
---
1. I put up turrets but they could reach the super mutant snipers at the steakhouse.
---
2. I put up the concrete defensive walls to hold them off but they would go down with 4 super mutants with super sledges.
---
3. I perked into home defense to get missile turrets with the searchlights but with the cover at the steakhouse they could only sometimes hit. 
---
Everyday was a constant struggle to man the diner with the appropriate resources to repair and the ammo to clear the steakhouse.
---
Eventually I just moved back to the diner to the forest. So I guess you could say I was literally drove out of business by a super mutant owned steakhouse.
---
The radscorpion has always dominated.  In Fo4 I was in the Glowing Sea and watched a radscorpion take out two chameleon deathclaws.  Then it came for me.
---
I got a 3 star sheepsquatch  
---
He dropped a 5 star drill
---
That's what happens when players scrub out of PvP.
---
Whiskey is pretty useful, at least for anyone with party boy. That six strength translates to a lot of damage.
---
Party like it's 2102!
---
Hell, combat knife with +swing speed is nasty enough. Everything else is icing on top.
---
You should tweet that at Bethesda they might retweet it
---
In packs they are lethal. well not really but they were still fun to deal with a New Vegas. That quarry, fun times in that place.
---
I’m on PS4 good sir
---
What a refreshing way to relax after a SBQ kill
---
On the other hand it is obvious that the SBQ scales in difficulty based on the amount of players involved in the event. Perhaps Bethesda put a dmg requirement  to prevent the little weasels who by their presence increase the difficulty but only take a few shots at the queen and then go hide in the bunker, shed, or other spots but contribute nothing to the engagement.
---
I wondered the same. Why should there be any storage constraint other than the user's hard drive space?
---
I was attacked by a queen somewhere in the north part of the mire and just took a picture when I was done cleaning house and it had them all. Seems like a lot of luck.
---
Saw guy with explosive laser rifle (maybe bloodied) he was oneshoting everything.
---
I've dropped so many paper bags out there.
---
Damn Skippy!!!
---
That was my first thought. This gun cannot exist.
---
I live in whitesprings by the mine bathroom and it never gets nuked and its so easy to get the wendigo and 10-12 charred ghouls to get baited into the sentrys
---
You can actually do almost the entire game that way. I've got a severely underleveled character performing amazingly. I've gotten to belly of the beast without having any issues with a level 37 character. Who if he gets hit will almost always lose all of his health.....so ......
---
PvP is a good way to match up two particular skill sets. Going "head to head" proves which playstyle is better if you test it in a multitude of locales
---
I agree. I usually need fusion cores or ammo,as soon as I wait for some to become available,somebody starts attacking the sites and wait in the chameleon armor for me to show up to kill me. I just need supplies and I always share what I get,if someone needs materials.
---
Yes that will be really fun when they add the vending machines
---
Seriously. It can be a ton of work to get workshops up and running, and a lot of resources are used. To have to server hop because these guys stalk us all over the map, and won’t leave us alone? It sucks.
---
I used to have a lot of trouble with yao-guai until I figured out that Blocker is one of the best perks in the game.  Gutsies with the 50cal arm are second only to radscorpions, in my book.  Unless I'm able to cripple their gun arm or stinger, they will fuck me up.
---
Dope! I'm about to go back home instead of Uber driving today! I havent encountered ONE sheepsquatch yet...hopefully it still works!
---
you dont have to be so shitty about it geez, some people like you get so defensive of games and game companies they like they cant bear to hear anything or anyone say anything they dont like about it
---
Are you sure it’s ten minutes?  I was there watching for respawns and it was more like 17 minutes
---
We need tge gun runners to make a appearance in 76 or atleast the dlc
---
good doggy and inert flux will take care of food and water issues.
---
Limit Fast travel and walk everywhere.  Slower, but you will likely discover new things, and pick up the "grind" items along the way.
---
I rarely need to make ammo, yet have 1000+ of every caliber I regularly use, and a loads of other ammo I give away. (are you on PS4?  If so, what what ammo do you need?)
---
Are there missions/quests you haven't completed? Go back and finish them. 
---
   I'm L74.  I'm loosly following the story line, traverisng the map exploring and discovering new locations.  Obviously, have picked up lots of quests along the way, but have not finished a number of them.
---
For example, I have not completed roses quest (Ok, its complete, but I haven't made it back to ToTW to claim the reward), the mysteries quest (2 more steps to go for the eye), camp mclintock (got the quest early; could not complete the course in time, skipped and moved on), or the DMV (just found out yesterday that was a separate/required quest).  Still working my way through lowes taxidermy quest.
---
So how does it go away after taking a workshop?
---
man i hear you, but many people on this sub will not allow you to have any opinion that differs from theirs
---
There are also console digital copies that work the exact same way as PC digital copies.
---
It may work perfectly fine but that doesn't mean that it is in harmony with the ToS. If you don't care about the ToS it doesn't matter, but as this is an online game tied to a Bethesda account some of us do care because we do not want to get banned.
---
If what you are doing is against the ToS and you get caught and banned that is it, no more account, no more character.
---
It is important if you care about not getting banned.
---
PS4 my good sir
---
So Iv only ever learned one mod from scrapping armor. And I’ve scrapped a ton. Is there a perk I need or something. I get weapon mods almost every time I scrap one but not armor mods.
---
Don't quote me on this, but I *think* I read about a fix coming for the plasma/laser gatling bug, which will be handy as that's the only heavy weapon type I use
---
Probably wouldn’t want you to be able to lose something you paid for like that. Would look really bad.
---
Prize bot sometimes gives you more than a prize certificate.  
---
In carious encounters, he's given me water, stimpaks, other chems, and IIRC, even a low end weapon.
---
Thanks for the offer but just got the suppressor, after nearly 40 scraps... :-) Yeah got the plans. My point of this point was that the current system is in no way challenging, it's just tedious server hopping and dice rolling.
---
Hell yeah!
---
[Robbie:] “Are you, uh, a real villain?”
---
[Bobby:] “Well, uh, technically... nah.”
---
[Robbie:] “Have you ever caught a good guy, like, uh, like a real superhero?”
---
[Bobby:] “Nah.”
---
[Robbie:] “Have you ever tried a disguise?”
---
[Bobby:] “Nah, nah...”
---
[Robbie:] “Alright! I can see that I will have to teach you how to be villains!”
---
Hey!
---
We are Number One
---
Now listen closely
---
Here's a little lesson in trickery
---
This is going down in history
---
If you wanna be a Villain Number One
---
You have to chase a superhero on the run
---
Just follow my moves, and sneak around
---
Be careful not to make a sound
---
(Shh)
---
(No, don't touch that!)
---
Ha ha ha
---
Now look at this net, that I just found
---
When I say go, be ready to throw
---
Go!
---
(Throw it on him, not me!)
---
(Ugh, let's try something else)
---
Now watch and learn, here's the deal
---
He'll slip and slide on this banana peel!
---
(Ha ha ha, gasp! what are you doing!?)
---
Ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
---
Just need an option to switch the build area from circle to square.  Then we could build towns!
---
That's impossible in adventure mode if you have pacifist on.
---
Jesus yes
---
If buying a used copy of this game was against the tos you would have heard something about it by now.......
---
do you play whit multiple characters? i know i have freaked out a bit and thought i lost things but i realized i was on a different character
---
im not saying you are mistaken or wrong though! im sorry this happened to you
---
if you are over level 50 and still cant see the scrapper card you can for sure make a vid to help the devs figure it out
---
I think there's also a bug where using the MIRV attachment causes the two projectiles to collide in the air directly in front of the player, exploding and killing you.
---
Stock .308 and 5.56. Both are often used in volume but have small crafting values. If you plan on setting up in a lowbie zone, some .45 and .44 might not be amiss. Large volumes of heavy weapons ammo, of course.
---
Will happen..just a matter of time
---
Me too.  There are a few things we could do.  I have tons of usable weapons in my stash.  I could set you up with decent stuff.   I could show you my route farming Whitespring.  I have good luck there when it isn't nuked.  We could team up and wreck it.  Also, the tip on what you have in your stash influencing what drops seems true.  I highly recommend that.  Nonetheless, if you want, shoot me a FR.  My PSN is the same as here.  I play early in the AM and every evening (I'm EST).
---
Add me Saucy_Buckaroo
---
Hes at the teapot on my server
---
Tht city of angels?
---
It would also be nice to have a lunchbox skin replace the bag
---
It doesn’t. We’re still marked for PVP until we lose the fight for the contested workshop. But that’s only if we travel there to try to take it back. Half the time we don’t stand a chance though, because they’re a ridiculous level with weapons that kill you in one shot.
---
And that’d be fine, the OP weapons and build, if they actually wanted the workshop. But no, they’re just there to hunt the owners down for shit and giggles.
---
Yeah, should have at least extended to 400.
---
Had 40 pics already before the camera, then suddenly was hurriedly making room for sudden sheepclaw encounter. (Honestly will miss some of those.)
---
Shouldn't have to worry about something like this... but this is what we get when the people who made the game don't play it and don't give two shits.
---
Almost salvaged my hunters long coat once. Had a panic moment when it asked me to confirm.
---
Ballistic bock, say goodbye to weapon durability.  Now you’ll have to buy repair kits to support the atom shop!  muhahaha
---
Personally I've noticed 0 correlation between stashed legendaries and new ones dropped, no idea how anyone would even work this out and float the theory tbh! They're just random drops
---
Cool. So why transfer it for said screenshot? It still takes effort, if less of it (I was not aware of the diving suit from Far Harbor, neat). When they could just have easily used a power armor asset for the image, why transfer if you're not going to use it.
---
Well I mean you'd have to hit scrap, and then verify, so that'd be two slips of the finger. And that can happen any time you're in the scrap window, so it's not like it's any added danger.
---
I mean if people are milling around in there it will screw up the spawns :/ not much you can do
---
Biv told me to.
---
Some are armed with a .50cal arm, which seems to function very similarly to a standard .50 MG in the hands of a perked up heavy gunner character.  You can survive, but it does a LOT of damage.  My friend and I did an informal PvP test where I swapped in 9 ranks of heavy gunner perks and shot at her with a plain .50cal after she got smooshed by the Watoga Gutsy Squad and wondered if a player could do that much DPS with a .50.  We figured the Gutsy dps to be similar to having heavy gunner and expert heavy gunner with three ranks each for a total of +40% damage on a standard .50cal with no mods.  Adding master heavy gunner was too much.
---
tl/dr The gutsies with the .50cal arms are hard-bois.
---
Coming :)
---
Love this idea!
---
Inconspicuous? Like right outside the Whitespring front door?
---
Super dumb on the drum mag.  I thought that I'd sacrifice armor penetration for a proper drum but it went from 12 to 18.  Super pointless.
---
Ive dropped my All Rise and couldn't find it one time, and then I had that cool outfit from the sheepsquatch event, I think I accidentally scrapped it? IDK I had it renamed and everything. Luckily I found a new All Rise in a vendor a few days later. Still trying to get a new outfit though.
---
Big man, Napoleon.
---
I don't know what happens to the build engine as soon as you start building under a bridge but it becomes insanely difficult to snap anything the second something is overhead.
---
I am sure you already know given how detailed this build is but a trick I learned was to move objects out of the area, put things on top of them, and then move the whole assembly back in. It seemed to help quite a bit instead of trying to snap them while under the area.
---
God, Radscorpions can be brutal. When I was low level I ran across one that I couldn't kill and it chased me for a good 10 minutes. Every time I thought I had lost it, I'd crouch and see I was in danger and a second later it would pop up and start attacking me.  
---
Eventually I found a car I jumped on and it was less able to attack me. Risky though, I was praying I would kill it before it caused the car to explode.
---
Cool story bro.
---
I take munitions, just to farm people like you.
---
Thank you! You're the best!
---
No seriously, I love the whole "Sky Beam" idea, sounds so much cooler than "Klieg", and it's also a great idea as well. I put work lights up on my roof pointing in all directions. It helps getting back, helps when you're attacked at night and kinda your idea, helps others find your camp when it's dark.
---
Sure, ammo can be crafted, but you don't always have the mats on hand, but do have caps, so might be worth putting it up for sale.
---
Got a friend with a mingun - obviously eats 5mm.  So whenever I see it as loot, I pick it up for him.  (Yea, there is the munitions factory, but ....)
---
I'm glad there's a fix coming for that. I really really hope my mini nukes disappearing will be fixed too.
---
They are there to hunt you down for those sweet sweet caps.  It’s just business.
---
I am so grossed out by that for some reason.
---
I hope this is a nod to the upcoming nuclear winter dlc.
---
It could be a bug within fo76 not differentiating between two  tilesets of the same terrain, one normal and a winterised version for nuclear winter, or at least I'm hopeful it is anyway lol
---
This is why I stopped bothering with workshops awhile back.
---
I killed 2 three star ghouls this morning at Whitesprings, and the corpses vanished before i could even get to them to loot. They really need to fix everything about the stupid legendary mobs.
---
Fellow vault dwellers down on their luck...
---
They never left adventure.
---
My first run in EVER (last night) with the Sheepsquatch  had a 3\* and a 1\*. It started with me 110 lvl and another 119 lvl guy running the cows then by the time we got to the farm there were 4-5 more over 100 guy/gals there. Sheep boi did NOT like my Bone Raider PA and ran me into the dirt but we dropped both of them and I got a 1\* harpoon gun out of the deal.
---
It’s so annoying. Most of the time, none of us can stand a chance against them. For one, when we’re going on supply runs, our perk cards are rearranged for things like Pack Rat and Strong Back. Not that that matters either, since they have weapons that can one shot you anyway.
---
Inconspicuous in that it looks like the 1000s of dead bodies in the map, and it doesn't spawn an event/quest when you're near it
---
Correction let's just hope you don't try to take a workshop on my server because I'll dispatch you like a feral ghoul then feast on your corspe.
---
OKAY, that sounds great I’ll be on in the evening ish I’ll adjust to when you are on, I’ll shot you a request and this sounds really FUN can’t wait man.
---
Coming soon....an additional 50 pictures for storage for the low price of 500 atoms in the atom shop!
---
I really shouldn't give them any ideas....
---
*so you're saying there's a chance*
---
Ooooooo, a square!! Such a small change but it could be revolutionary!!
---
Its all about rng
---
Happy to help!
---
Best song reference OP
---
Soo... if you don't use you ebay armor, can you still kill us ? lol
---
Outstanding!  See you then!
---
It’s a stupid business. So much more caps in the steel, lead and aluminum that just sit there in the extractors because we can’t walk five minutes without being shot down.
---
what is your platform and name ?
---
Not always true.  I’ve had plenty of them take the workshop, scrap my purifiers and generators and turrets and stuff, then server hop, leaving me to pay to rebuild everything (or, what actually happened, go back to playing Borderlands because fuck MMOs)
---
The literally only do it to fuck with people.
---
About the harpoon gun... it has fire rate of 3. That means you get to fire it 3 times every 10 seconds. If you reload too quickly, your fire rate won't catch up. Something you want to consider when you are equipped with lock and load/speed demon or legendary weapon with faster reload speed
---
Bethesda said at Pax east they wanted to do this but it was causing performance issues.
---
I think the C.A.M.P. system we have is a child of necessity rather than want.
---
Was farming crystal yesterday for the camera film challenge. Took 3 workshops. Set everything up. Within 4 minutes I get a notification that my workshop has been attacked and yep, orange dot appears and there comes some Marsupial high jumping and firing wildly. I server hopped. Bored with these morons.
---
U know it boiiii
---
Love the idea of the 'Bucket List' quest.  Great having quests that don't involve killing stuff for a change.
---
But yeah, the whole 'needle in a haystack' concept of starting the quest is not good design.  Took me several hours and 100s of caps spent before I finally found it.  Not fun.
---
That’s just fucked up.
---
Yeah dude the game is easy. Never said it was hard. I said you can't play all the game without being hit. 
---
PvP is one on one. You don't face a horde of 20 ghouls running or a pack of mirelurks coming from beyond water. That's why it's irrelevant. Obviously if you have a single ennemy in an open field, being a sneaky sniper seems a better idea than being a berserker.
---
But go on, keep trying to prove playing a sneak is easier than playing melee, when everything in the game screams "not really".
---
Have you look how long a melee weapon can be used without being repaired compared to a ranged weapon? Have you looked at the material needed for those repair? For ammo crafting? The weight of said weapons and ammo's?
---
I main a melee/heavy specialist. I carry three gatling, a rocket launcher, a few Fatman. I still end using my deathclaw gauntlet because the thing just kills everything. A mininuke often doesn't even kill a single ennemy.
---
The two single ranged weapon I really use are an auto Grenade launcher because I love it, but its absolutely worst than melee, and a TSE gatling plasma because, agreed, THAT is a good weapon.
---
I need more rockets to kill a Mr handy than hits with a meat hook. That's bullshit.
---
You know that can happen when taking a workshop but blame Bethesda for nerfing survival hard. I guess some people lose caps on survival and then go to adventure mode to get the caps back. Losing more caps in adventure than in survival is just stupid.
---
If we were all crying for a way to protect our weapons it would take months if Bethesda did it at all. But somebody might get free stuff from the *Atom shop*?? Flawless protections.
---
My guess is that it's a coincidence, an alignment of randomness that makes for a cool event. 
---
When I was doing the mayor for a day quest in Watoga, my base was a little southwest of Watoga near a junk pile. When I got to the end and was on top of the municipal building fighting the Scorchbeast and the robots, at one point the scorchbeast just flew off... right in the direction of my base. It was felt like a "you're attacking my nest, so I'ma go tear down your home!" move. 
---
I don't know if it was a glitch and he somehow aggroed my base, or if he just randomly flew in that direction for a bit, but for a second I was like "that son of a bitch!" Pretty fun.
---
I think the implication is that they had a workshop somewhere on the other side of the map, which is OPs point.
---
Oh trust me I get it, but they boosted the caps per kill so what did they expect people to do?
---
The Rescue Diver suit (as well as the Arktos Lab Coat) are both in the files, they're just not implemented yet.
---
Yeah you actually have to look at stuff.
---
You only want the effects? There's a heavily radiated place in East side in cranberry bog. Just hop into the water in that small bunker and wait. Server hop and repeat.
---
Havent played the game in months but in the 76 subreddit people sell serums for 100-200 caps
---
That seems like a nice spot! How's the spawn in? Do you end up above or below it?
---
Agreed! My fixer for my stealth sniper build might not one shot stuff but damn if the improved stealth isn't worth it. Had three enemies run past me from behind looking for me the other day. Of course I gave them a few steps then capped them in the back of the dome
---
Tons of people have claimed that stuff is going missing over the last couple weeks. Most are losing stuff from thier inventory but I've seen a couple posts saying things in their stash are gone as well.
---
No word from Bethesda on if this is a confirmed bug / glitch and there doesn't seem to be a way to recreate it.
---
Honestly, it doesn’t even need to be explosive, sure it’s awesome if it does but like you said, they are expensive. I’ve been looking for a gatling laser (Ultracite would be great but I’ve yet to even find a basic one of those) with like, anti armor and or doubled/quad, with executioner. Super specific but those would be the best for me. Twoshot would also be great but it’s whatever
---
It’s still dumb. I can make more caps with those resources than they’d ever make hunting me down. (Also, I am constantly broke, so jokes on them.)
---
Thanks for the quick response!  I meant to ask about obtaining the recipes, not just the consumable serums or effects. Main post edited to clarify. 🤧
---
If the player gets an alert, that would be excellent.  I can see a lot of gifts going unopened and unnoticed if not.
---
"Wangsp4nkr420 has given you a gift!" in the upper corner of the screen or something noticeable but unobtrusive, in case you're in the middle of a fight.
---
Yes I'm talking about ***you***, the legendary war drum or chest armor picture blocking the middle of my screen.
---
The fact that the delay carries over to any other weapon you swap to as well makes it a big problem.
---
I would just be happy with an alternate bag/box that looks like a package if item is dropped on purpose.  Junk and aid dropped on death would remain in a brown paper bag.
---
Themed boxes for holidays would be nice too:)
---
Yeah sure mate. Because nothing says fun and immersion like server hopping to finally get a basic questline
---
I want to be friends with Savage_dadpool hahah
---
And here I am strumming my banjo in the forest.
---
Come at me, level 1 liberators!
---
I think they still drop from the queen, but I've never gotten one. Check the market places, you can usually buy the recipes up for 2-4k caps.
---
Nobody farms me ever , just a warning for the marshmallows out there
---
They are a rare drop from the queen scorchbeast.
---
They used to be a possible drop from the SBQ, but they got removed from her loot pool awhile ago.
---
Afraid the only ways to get them now is from the Enclave vendor or trading with other players.
---
Tempting as i have 30 bottles.
---
If you on XB1, you have to reset your home router, I know stupid right ? Anyway I think it saves some server settings/ip etc. Resetting my primary router consistently allows me to connect to my friends when I can't every time .. stupid but works.
---
So if I take a workshop and leave the server I’m still marked?
---
I got popped once a few weeks back. I’m usually pretty aware but Grahm came strolling through my workshop with Shally moo moo and there I was like a doofus combing through his inventory.  Then bam, I’m down and 200 caps down...  By the time I get back, Grahm is gone.  That was a sad day.
---
I think I might have for the daily challenge but it's bs, they must have been looking for me and everything. How can I be killed like that when I'm nowhere near the workshop? And pacifist is bullshit too.
---
No Ebay armor all natural drops ,you must be one of the crybabies
---
I know this is a post only 2 weeks ago but do you still have some raider armor plans.
---
Traps like what? ( im a new player )
---
Lol you wish
---
im having issues understanding just what information is being conveyed in this thread
---
isn't the final objective of that quest to kill the strangler grafton monster?  did it ever appear for you to kill it?
---
The recipes were removed from the SBQ loot-pool per patch notes.   
---
For random mutations, you can manually get mutations quickly from Emmett Mountain Disposal, since there's a pile of toxic waste and a decontamination shower (with no load screen between). Rad, de-rad, rad, de-rad, rad... until you mutate. Server hop after each mutation you add (whether you keep it or not).   
---
For specific mutations, buy them from other players. Several players sell serums for 100-300 caps on consoles and 300-500 caps on PC.
---
Damn this was 95 days ago when I actually still played. Before they nerfed absolutely everything and made the game dull. Quad explosive double barrell shotgun was the only counter ages ago but now days no idea. It was the only weapon that could do enough damage in between the stagger timer.
---
I mean, you could still mute your mic. Lmao
---
I worked with a someone recently who believed that his tweet to Bethesda, years ago, to have multiplayer Fallout, gave them the idea and that he is responsible for the game. Isn't life funny that way. He obviously had intense developer powers, and wanted me, as his supervisor, to know. He was dead serious with a link to the tweet and everything. Because, that's the level of future game developer, that he was. As in, ***yeah--***, that was ***him***. As his boss, I just said, wow, nice. But I said it really "knowingly". You know. To be supportive.
---
Summerville is great. Just don’t stand next to the tanks if you’re being shot at. You’ll be looting caps and grenades, which you can have fun lobbing at the mutants. There are weapon and armor workbenches on the roofs to keep up with repairs.
---
Agreed, doesn't need to be the workshop build area, maybe as large as 1km surrounding area. 
---
But it definately should not be the entire map.
---
I think that’s the thing that pisses me off the most. All those valuable resources. Gone. They can make so much more caps selling those resources,
---
ROFLOL "my server."
---
Now I really need a small letters plan at my bar to 'list' the possible options available in each bowl, also to remind them to grab purified water from outside to hydrate and let them know there is a bunk bed to sleep it off.
---
Says the guy too afraid to play on survival.
---
10/10 would die from laughing. That scene always got me lol
---
I’d rather dump the resources and workshop than die to those assholes. They’re usually assassin/sentinel two shot morons too. Isn’t PvP mode fun for them anymore?
---
I don't play survival but hopped in to get the Action Hero, can someone explain the leaderboards to me, I thought they changed it so unless you killed someone, you wouldn't show up on the leaderboards. But I immediately showed up as 4th on the list and people zoned and came to my location relatively quickly, so I was showing up on peoples's lists .. I thought I was hidden if I didn't do anything ?
---
No no no, you’re okay. You lose the workshop but aren’t in PvP mode when you server hop.
---
I just want my stash space back. I'm hoarding so many worthless legendaries that it's adding an entirely new level of difficulty to the game. I can't store enough junk to make more than one excursion's worth of ammo. Each session is make a little ammo for steel/lead run, use that steel/lead for actual excursion ammo volumes. I'd like to just make one huge run for lead/steel that will last for multiple excursions... legendary vendor, please.
---
What is the capitol of Mississippi?
---
I don't know, I'm a sniper/stealth build. So the things that get me are the ones I haven't figured out how to stay hidden (scorchbeasts find you even if you are not shooting at them, long as you are within their radius so I find them really tough cause no staying in caution at most while sniping them). Wendigos aren't bad long as I manage to stay out of their detection range (mirelurk kings are a lot scarier as they take more to hit, are fast, and since it takes longer much more likely for them to find me). Friend of mine found a little trick that makes assaultrons a lot better... they're like deathclaws. Shoot them in the leg so they end up having to crawl ;). Only one I really still have an issue with are the ones that melee/go invisible because usually I can't get them fast enough before they detect me (and then I'm just not fast enough of an aim to get them in the leg, I'll just go for managing to hit them before they kill me).  Also, I find as a stealth build if you keep an object between you and the assaultron you can play hide and seek with them ;). 
---
The queen I've found (at least the one I've been tyring to go for hoping to get the weekly) if I just stay far enough away she doesn't find me, she's not very observant honestly. She's just an ammo eater.
---
For me it's the mirelurk kings, that one type assualtron I mentioned, scorchbeasts, and honestly anything that finds me before I can kill it or get it seriously down in health. Oh and fuck radscorps. A lot, they fucking cheat (you can't stealth them, soon as you go caution which you will with any enemy once you get close they teleport straight to you).
---
Ah I miss building in the forest and have my turrets actually kill something that attacks. Mine just got utterly decimated when those SBs attacked
---
Sorry for your frustration,but if you get the contractor perk, you won't have to spend many (or any) of your own resources to get a workshop up and running. Blueprinting defensive structures similarly deals with the amount of time it takes to setup.
---
GW is the only one that could be considered an "online game" and even that charged for updates. The rest are strategy games that had some online component. That's not at all the same.
---
If I jump on top of a structure, they just seem to lurk underground until I touch the ground again.  They just wait, and wait, and wait.  They know I can't fast travel.  They know I have to come down eventually.  Eventually I just bite the bullet, hit the floor and start spinning around in terror waiting for the inevitable poison blur.  I just hit lvl 200, have the ideal legendary guns for my build, a solid end game build, and I still stop and ask myself if fighting that radscorpion is really worth it.  I'll take all three pylons during Encryptid without a thought, jump right into AWOL Armaments, happily defend brahmin against a pair of sheepsquatch, but when a radscorpion shows up I say "fuck no bruh."  Even seeing a *** legendary radscorpion makes me pause and wonder if it's worth the fight on the chance I might get an actual *** item.  I just hate those things with a passion.
---
You have to add stairs to a foundation, and then attach a floor to it before you can build a second story. Make sure where you place the stairs is going to be permanenent, because you won't be able to remove it without building a second, conected stairway.
---
I think so? But yeah, it didn’t show up. I was very sad, haha. When I hit it and it died immediately I knew that the grafton monster or queen wouldn’t spawn and I was just like, “oopsie doopsie.”
---
&gt;all natural drops

\*\*\* Checks post history \*\*\*\*

Lair
---
Yeah, I guess I learned that the hard way, haha
---
I do hope they add more rehashed outfits from 4 into the game, preferably as timed exclusives with exorbitant pricing, preferably without any improved textures and such, saves the team from being creative and convinces the bosses to drive Bethesda deeper into continuing the 'games as a service' model with future releases.
---
Who's being shitty? I was clearly stating a fact. The roadmap exist and it clearly covers what the OP was asking for. 🤔🤔🤔maybe they didn't know about it because like I said it covers everything they asked for. Think about it. 🤔🤔🤔*which is also why I asked for further clarification (what is your issue?) maybe I missed something IDK*
---
TL;DR:  I wasn't shitty but I also refuse to coddle delusional uninformed players. The truth hurts but that's none of my concern.
---
It's one of those things where once you've got it you'll keep finding them. I'm stuck at work at the moment but if you still haven't found it later I'll let you know if I come across one.
---
I've noticed this behavior since Patch 7, which had also screwed up the list ordering.  The ordering has been fixed, but by its logic, a lot of friends are permanently camping out on the Main Menu with no option to Join. 😋
---
Are u?
---
I also live under a bridge near harpers ferry, 
---
TROLLS UNITE !!!
---
Sounds better then running to reddit to whine about a game mechanic everyone knows about I have never tried to take a workshop from someone but if I own a workshop I store my junk and prepare to be challenged I win some and lose some but I understand it is part of the game.
---
he knows he is not entitled, he is just saying the prices are a bit high,
---
Okay, buddy. Make sure you take care of your high horse or its legs could snap.
---
Ah ok let me try that, thanks.
---
Yeah, I thought it was going to bounce back and I wasn’t going to one hit K.O. that sucker. Boy was I wrong!
---
During that whole bossfight thing I just hid under some stairs and waited until the timer ran out. I feel like the robots should be able to disable the thing youre doing but cant cause of the SB attacking them so you can just cheese the fight and let the SB deal with the robots
---
This is just a texture loading glitch.  I’ve had this for two patches now.
---
I don’t think OP knows what he’s talking about. Maybe he meant instigating explosive?
---
Thanks for sharing your story btw. PvP interactions are the main thing I like to read about. I would share mine, but I'm not very well written (and don't wanna come off as being a jerk). Good luck out there, wastelander.
---
ps....find a dense torso mod for your chest armor.  Exploding cars, robots and explosive ammo go from deadly to lightly annoying.  If you rock power armor, I have no advice.
---
And  people are still selling them for around 3k each.
---
Get a poweplant workshop. Or go around whitesprings killing dentry botsm theres 6 to 7 of them.
---
When that happens to me, I go back 5 or so minutes later.  
---
the meatpile(s) usually have appeared, and are lootable.
---
Lat night, I killed several on cottage row, no corpse.  
---
Went inside the resort, did some crafting, came back out.  
---
walkup up cottage row, there were all the meatpiles.  Looted them
---
"Raider" is just a way for people to be a complete dick and grief and not give a shit, it doesn't work like that.
---
&gt; Don't ever take a workshop
---
How about grow a pair and go on survival? Oh wait you'll die instantly and repeatedly because you'll only PvP when you have the upper hand.
---
that sucks.  I love doing that quest, and it doesn't pop often enough for me
---
If it's just editing Text strings, could some make a mod of it on PC and get away with it?
---
One person will intentionally get a bounty and just sit and wait while their teammates are crouched nearby.  Crouching hides you off the map so you think there is only the one person there and they jump you. I've had that happen a few times.
---
One of the best benefits of buying atom skins for your favorite weapons is that it can't be traded which means it's a lot harder to accidentally trade away or get swiped.
---
Not gonna lie if someone steals my workshop I'm moving myself to the complete other side of the map. I just wanna wave at people and go on with my day... and I'm a coward.
---
It's a bug that I wish Bethesda would fix.  It appeared about three patches ago and around twilight it changes everything so that is looks like there is a chalky white ash everywhere and sometimes the brown cliff gravel changes to a whiteish color as well.  Graphically speaking, it's a big takeaway from the game.
---
That nukashine is the chaddiest paint of them all.
---
I took over both power plants and got a nice bundle problem is with greifers your now a target
---
My results were much like yours, and pretty similar to repeated runs through West Tek.
---
My suspicion is that these people are having their asses handed to them on survival. They bought or duped their god-level gear and, seeing that they can obliterate people in adventure, went to spread chaos on the pvp servers only to find that the people over there have both better gear and better skills. So they come back here and stalk casuals to boost their wounded egos.
---
Ok cool
---
love this
---
Nah, 
---
Not a crybabie, to old for that, but only time i see somone that can kill some us that has been playing games like this before they even where out of their dippers is when they have a good setup of ebay armor :D
---
\*mic drops so hard it cracks the earths crust and punctures the core\*
---
No. Every magazine can spawn at each of the magazine spawn.
---
Also astoundingly awesome tale #4 is not in the game.
---
Pretty standard feature in a lot of games where it's possible to drop/sell/dismantle items that I've played, for sure
---
Arch = Radaway.
---
How can you kill what you can't see?
---
Get off my server.
---
&gt;someone who sees so many faults
---
Where's the so many. I name off less than ten faults I've seen other players have with the game. And I am definitely not discouraging new players in any way.
---
Literally all I said was there is no reason to have a Free Weekend because bugs from the beta still exist and you people tried to spin it into your own thing. 
---
What's the point of having a Free Weekend if all those new players are going to do is complain about how nothings changed and then not buy the game once it's over.
---
I found a random encounter that had a 3 Star throwing down with a half dozen Super Mutants. Needless to say, the Mutants didn't last long. Then I spent ten minutes killing the thing and was rewarded with a 1 star Mutant Slayer's Spear.
---
Duping is not a serious problem anymore. Also have you even looked at the market place. Good luck getting any god tier weapon or armor with caps, they have no value long term. If you want a good weapon you have to trade a good weapon for it. Also, just because someone is selling an item for a larger amount of caps and you don't have that many does not make them an asshole.
---
My personal top 5... not counting legendary effects...
---
Lever action rifle. The Dragon. Gatling laser. Mole miner gauntlet. Pole hook.
---
Power plant workshops generate 100% cores at 8/hour, killing sentry bots at whitesprings, or random locations now nets &lt;50% cores.
---
Take two workshops on a low population server for a couple hours, and you can net 32-48 100% cores easily.
---
A well thought out and articulated opinion is not a rant
---
It's a pretty common tactic. A pair or group will pull this off. One will camp your workshop until another in the group finds you. The one at your workshop will then begin to contest it, flagging you and his group members for pvp. In that instant, the group members will open fire on you, and you'll often be dead before you even get a notification that somebody is claiming your workshop. You're then flagged for pvp unless/until you change servers, and they will farm you for caps in the interim.
---
You normally shoot it at nearby surfaces so it rebounds into enemies, not directly at them.  Try to find an average location between enemies to hit multiples with the same shot, or bounce it off a wall to hit something around a corner.
---
To Op's point, I end up replacing the Semi-Auto because the charging and standard variants do more damage and you can simply mash the button to keep firing.  There is a Shotgun/Charging Shotgun variant which has less range, but seems more likely to take out many enemies rather than a couple.  There's also a lobbing shotgun barrel that tosses out a bunch of orb-shaped electrical "mines" that do damage to anything that wanders near them.
---
I've done the event like three times and my first time was a three star Noxious. Wish I would have known people were debating over its existence T_T
---
Thats what I thought! The reddit is full of made up theories and ideas. That people read and take as fact than in game are calling you a cheater because of some bullshit they saw on here.
---
I mean it is a loot shooter and everything else
---
Makes the game replayable
---
noted. will edit bud!
---
Yea with bloodied it’s incredibly OP, just need to keep an eye on the health bar all the time lol
---
I don't remember exactly where, but there was a little shack in the middle of nowhere.
---
isnt the cap limit only 25K, or is it 250k?
---
The invisible body can be in different locations for different people. Last night I saw where it was downed, but only a couple people could loot it right there. I circled around the area while pointing at the ground to find the Loot box. It showed up about 10-15 feet away from where I watched it go down. Once I found it, I looted that 1-star leather leg armor I *so* needed. :)
---
The other suggestion of waiting until it turns into a metal scrap-pile has worked for me as well. Again, it was not in the exact area that I saw the creature get downed at, rather a bit off to the side.
---
Taking over any of the power plants, you can fire up the fusion core processor, but that's slow and opens you up to PVP. If you go that route,behave a team. 
---
Another route is salvaging cores from fusion generators. There are some good YouTube videos on farming routes, but you may get to them after they've been harvested. Server hop and try again. 
---
Some robots carry full cores...sentry bits and some robobrains I believe. So kill them and get cores.
---
As you mentioned, building your own takes time, and some flux is more difficult to get than others, and you might already need it for repairs. I try to stockpile it when I can, use super duper perk, and cross my fingers.
---
Anyone have other strategies? Oh, also use Power User lvl 3: cores last twice as long.
---
“BUT CHANGE BOTHERS ME! I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE EXACTLY AS I EXPECT!”
---
I kill people at workshops and give half the stuff to new players.  Am I just being an asshole? Workshops open you up to PVP. You agree to it. As for survival, I like to fast travel and not lose aid items.
---
PC photo storage seems to be unlimited.  Odd choice, considering that modern consoles should be able to handle a bunch of glorified screenshots.
---
If you had any balls you would share your IGN. 
---
If you have to tell people you are a raider, you are not raider.
---
My camp is under the left bridge it's a 4story tall building so I can make my way up the bridge too
---
Yeah I’ve got a Troubleshooter’s that I use for silos and the ISS. It’s pretty good everywhere, though.
---
The "Event: Line in the Sand" at Ft. Defiance has been giving me 2 power cores each completion recently.  Not exactly farming, but it can be a nice complement to you other efforts.
---
Thanks, that will help a lot
---
The two ways I would improve this:
---
* Crafting should offer the same dice roll to learn a mod as scrapping.
---
* If you scrap something that has a specific mod you want and don't have, the chance of learning that mod is higher.
---
Both of these make logical sense to me.  Buying/crafting guns only to smash them to bits and get something completely unrelated is not.
---
Yea performance dings have limited camps. I hope in  the future they expand on workshops or "town" were you can build a smaller houses with others, could work well with trading.
---
Crybabies  all
---
If they don’t want to come off as a looter shooter they should provide more interesting questlines than ‘explore _______’ or ‘kill x amount of Mirelurks/ghouls/scorched’ IMO
---
The reason it feels like a looter shooter is there isn’t enough content to keep you playing without the promise of a potential ‘super good roll’ on a 3star
---
Id like to know this as well....post it up "raider guy"
---
Or mounted on power armor.
---
Jesus. They were just a shit enemy all around. I don’t mind tough enemies, but at least make them look the part.
---
Got it,  that's friggin awesome!
---
I would assume the railroad tracks in game are what is the trail in real life. I know that at least where I live the app trail was a railroad previously.
---
I used to live below you. That's a nice spot, but sadly I grew tired of not being able to establish camp in this world crap, so I moved a bit South. The room below you which is a little radiated is a nice loot spot from time to time.
---
I'm currently AFK using my phone at school, and I just misremembered. I know it's instigating, not sure what else. But thanks for pointing it out
---
I've heard it's possible, but just never seen it in the 20+ times I've ran it. I'll keep trying until I get flaming barbed plans.
---
Quad Crossbow is shit, as you have to reload each of the 4 bolts and it does not stack like other guns, iirc. sold the thing a long time ago so it might have been changed
---
I agree, but that's the problem is that people are making it more of a looter shooter so the focus more on making it that way. drives me mad, the potential is there, its being pushed in a different way because of an ongoing trend in other "Live Service" games.
---
Do a quick run in WS for sentry bot's, 2 usually at the entrance where you can get to the bunker and 2-3 at the main door, you will have 3-5 cores in a few min's:)
---
Just be fast, those sexy Asultatron's can do nasty stuff to, lol
---
Super mutants at mine. Something fun about having my main character in his jammies, barrelling out the door and wasting them. 😂
---
No it's alright. I was server hopping for like 5-10min then someone messaged me they had it. Thank you though
---
Unfortuntately that won't help you. There are "tricks" (read:glitches) that means you take a workshop and someone wants a piece of you, someone has to die.
---
Stealth bonus is wonderful. Vats crits are wonderful. If you're struggling to kill something with a ranged weapon on a melee character it probably means you didn't spec  the character for ranged. I will say it one final time. If I kill something before it hits me I've already become more effective than a melee character would be In the same situation. Most fights for main missions have enemies with guns so the melee character will take damage. That's it. That's why melee is worse. You simply need more resources to use it effectively and if you enjoy being able to play 6 hours without using any health equipment and never dying then ranged is better. Melee dominates....if you can get close. Most situations however a ranged character is better.
---
How the fuck do you accidently drop a weapon? Is this a console only problem? I don't see people accidently pressing R on PC and dropping an item.
---
Good
---
Events, Events, Events. Anything that defends a reasonable level workshop, Feed the People, Horde, etc. Spend the few caps to fast travel and join the event - it'll be worth it.
---
I have no interest in any story if there are no NPCs to empathize with. I don't care and i have no feelings for some holotapes.
---
As it turns out the devs have ~~nerfed~~ 'rebalanced' pretty much every source outside power plants - I am not going to even bother speculating why they made this design choice - and fixed the bug that restored the charge to 100% upon login/server hop whilst forgetting to fix the ludicrous drain using VATS and Power Attack - Oopsie Daisy - so is either grab 25% charge ones from frames, 50% charge ones from fusion generators and world locations - Watoga Transit Hub/School lab etc - buy them from vendors or taking a power plant and risk being dropped in PvP wherever you are on the map without warning.
---
Pick your poison really. If I had to I would just transfer all my caps to an alt, put all the junk away and risk the power plant route.
---
To me the game is very much like a walk on the beach, you enjoy the sight and hopefully you get to pick up some beautiful seashells. What you’re saying is forget about the seashells dammit, it’s ok to be all drift wood and broken tools, just enjoy the view and call it a day, which is ok to some too.
---
PS4 and his IGN is same as reddit. Have fun!
---
You have the wrong flair, sir.
---
Good bot
---
Once I was carrying out a couple of trade deals with different players - buying fiberglass from one and trading armor with another. I mixed up who was who and offered my Cavalier's Assassin combat chest for 0 caps to the wrong person. Moment of panic before frantically exiting the trade.
---
PS4, IGN is same as reddit
---
Yeah, they should make a power armor mod or something that enables using unarmed weapons.
---
As soon they add bigger servers and rp stuff this is going to be the biggest game ever!
---
I dropped or accidentally sold my favorite weapon - a 3* furious handmade during a late night session and didn't realize until I logged in the next day. I was so so sad. Until my best buddy logged in and gave me an almost identical one he just happened to have spare in his stash. What a friend. Now I offer him any heavy weapon I get that I think he might like. Some day I will return the favour (3* Gatling guns are rare!)
---
Okay. ^okay
---
They are used to make the staff and other items from the event, thats why they dont auto scrap.
---
Sorry if this seems like thread hijacking, but I'm just level 43 and have only started running into legendary enemies (mostly around the Top of the World, as I've started doing Rose's quests). My go to weapon at the moment is just a modded out regular handmade. Noticed a legendary at the Raider camp down the road, so what the hell, I took all the muties out. Anyways, I've done this just three times (in separate sessions), and each time it's given me a decent one-star legendary (two armors, and one weapon). The last thing that dropped was a level 50 executioner's double barrel shotgun, which I promptly handed over to a random at the station (I'm a sneak sniper build, and I don't have any interest in playing any other way). Now I know Major Gutsy's and things like Sheepsquatches aren't going to be wrecked by that shotgun, but it seems to me (with a total lack of high level experience, so I'm looking to be corrected) like with the right perks it could be a perfectly fine endgame weapon, as long as your endgame isn't SBQ fights every session. I guess my question is this: Is a somewhat decent 1\* enough firepower for most people or no?
---
I'm asking the question as well, is it a joke or a legitimate mechanic?
---
i do love this game but im not blind to the many many bugs it has, and being a bethesda fan and playing all the other games that have come before FO76, im used to many many bugs in bethesda games
---
but unfortunately OP is right, if Bethesda really wants this game to survive and eventually thrive, it has to win back the gaming media and youtubers, the mainstream potential buyers really do listen to those and are influenced by those
---
If Bethesda buckles down and just focuses on bug fixing and server stability, it will go a long way to helping this game succeed
---
the recent focus on ATOM store profits isnt really a good look when the scorchbeast queen, the end game boss, is still broken
---
The people who love this game will defend it to their deaths, but they have to acknowledge there are some persistent issues that need to be addressed
---
Did you mean me or the OP ? :)
---
If, me, yes i dont do  survival, but not afraid, just not my type og fallout fun, but i have taken out my share of grifers ;)
---
But four vertexes is more complicated than a point and a radius
---
Unfortunately survival and farming legendaries is the only thing left to do in this game for a lot of people. Farming legendaries for the endgame that never comes.
---
Going in to swap perk cards for scrapping or crafting. R is beside T.
---
yeah. it strips the effect from it and adds an extra step to drop it as well. “dropping this item will... blah blah blah...”
---
It’s a part of the game. If you don’t wanna be able to initiate pvp don’t claim a work shop,  There’s other ways to get junk.
---
What about the "user data" sharing then? Anyone with more XBox knowledge than me shed any light on whether that's a normal thing to expect? This is literally a different XBox user, not just another character on the same profile. Seems all users share the same storage space.
---
25k
---
lol :D
---
Any area in the forest and immediately around it will have great enemies for you and all the events will be doable, unless a higher level gets there first. 
---
Keep in mind zones spawn enemies based on the first person to talk into them, so just because you went to one spot and the enemies overwhelmed you, doesn't mean it will always be that way. Anywhere in the NW corner of the map should be fine for you to fight in. 
---
Stick to the larger towns cities - Morgantown, Summersville, Flatwoods especially, but even Grafton and Wavy Willards even though I'd wait until closer to 20 to head that far. All those places frequently have events, daily quests, side quests, and workshops to take. Workshops are pretty decent early on because often times you get a quest to clear the enemies, then take the workshop, then defend it, so in about 15-20 minutes of playing you completed 3 small quests, got some CAMP plans and supplies, and then if you feel like it you can build resource generators and maintain it. Otherwise just take the rewards and bounce.
---
Thanks everyone for the help, and osrry for the wrong translation, my game is not in english. ill let u know if i manage to find all of them togheter
---
i was thinking based off your comment, maybe artillery range would be more fair, its large enough to enable pvp outside the workshop, but small enough where someone can avoid the across map griefing.
---
Lonely as I am together we cry
---
That's the same way that I got my bounty. I stashed all my junk and went looking for someone to kill me because it was truly unintentional. I got my bounty when all it took was one shot to a wall to get you wanted. It's much harder now, so unless you're blindly launching mini nukes or something to that effect, you don't get a bounty from a slip of the trigger. I'm sure it can still happen if the circumstances were right and those are the ones who offer themselves up as tribute.
---
Lol at these comments.  I don't take workshops BECAUSE I know the rules and don't enjoy pvp on fo76. 
---
But it is obvious he is role playing a Raider. Which means ruthless attacks, cowardly retreats (to live another day!) and loyalty to none but their brothers and sisters. It's not just that the game allows it: its literally the lore. 
---
Don't get mad. It's just War. War never changes.
---
 Workshops are a PvP part of the game. You will have to fight players for one, a lot of the time. 
---
 Its beyond mean, they are trying to kill you. ;)
---
That's quite a wall of text, just to be a complainer complaining about complainers complaining.
---
I'll know for sure when Bethesda gets back to me.
---
int he majority of class action lawsuits, the lawyers take the case on the hopes of a big return
---
Those robots are really tough to deal with using a melee weapon as short as the knives, those gutsys and ISS start firing from quite far away, if I drop my health to below 20 to maximize damage, I become really squishy and have to spam stimpak a lot lol
---
Where is the event? It'd be great if I could get notifications from events like this.
---
Because for gameplay reasons they can't have the exact same enemy be the toughest enemy in the franchise until the end of time.
---
I have accidentally sold my good guns by accident.  I cried once, even if you favorited it can be sold easily if you are not really paying attention. Watch out for that one too!
---
One of my girls Sonni - was born in 76 in the first couple years after the vault closed. Despite her parentage she's just about averge with no great people skills and always ends up second best but she doesn't mind. She's not very competitive and she basically lived for reclamation day to finally see what's beyond that Vault door.  
---
She loves Appalachia, especially all of the strange flora and fauna. She's obsessed with finding Mothman and other cryptids. She has a pet Deathclaw named Garden that she raised from an egg! She would rather run from fighting animals than hurt them. 
---
One day she might become a ghoul due to all the radiation that she constantly has. (please bethesda)
---
Sonni has a deep fear of ticks and bloodbugs and is mistrusting of other vault dwellers who often offer a gift in one hand and stab you in the back with the other. 
---
Sonni has a affinity for MODUS despite his unclear intentions and concealed ambitions. The whisperings that he might turn on the dwellers upsets her and she's not sure which side she would take if it comes to that.
---
//i feel so stupid for typing this omg but it's all in my head and i never talk about it
---
It's a sphere, centered on where you place your module. Much easier to set a radius, than to set full cubic dimensions.
---
Thats the joke
---
Ok.
---
That sure was a lot of posting to convey the fact that people can be whiny. Almost makes you come off as...whiny
---
Counter-Strike.
---
Not a bad idea at all, although I do love finding "mystery bags" scattered around the wasteland. Will I get some 40mm Grenades? Will I get some Wood Armour? How about some Spoiled Meat? The surprises never stop, and each one tells a story.
---
Oh man it’s all good! Throw it out there if something interesting or funny happens! I will say reddit can be harsh lol. I just posted this because it was a pretty funny situation with my son, which he normally doesn’t watch me play so it was good entertainment to say the least. I’m just glad some others found it amusing as well!
---
Yeah i know :( I just want to have fun in a game for a while you know? \*sadly sigh\*
---
I'm not sure if the ENTIRE game industry is at risk since gaming has never been more popular. Back in my day (I started gaming on an Atari 2600) you were shamed for playing video games instead of sports or reading, but since then it has only ever trended upward as people need more of an escape from reality.
---
It's funny how Fallout, a harsh world by any means, is the way we escape from this one due to it's own bleak reality.
---
At the end of the day it all comes down to the competitive nature of humans. I want to grind for that primo legendary because my friend has one and now I want one to. Seems immature, but it is also the driving nature to why any of us do the things we do. 
---
Be the strongest, get the best gear and weapons, earn the adulation of your peers... 
---
I'm not saying everyone is like that, but I believe for the most part people are. 
---
However, I know few people who hardcore roleplay in this game, and to be honest they are the best players around... even if they can't 1 shot or tank everything. Just got to learn how to talk to them while they are in character lol
---
I'm left handed and naturally a left handed shooter, but the british army SA80 is a right handed only weapon, so I learnt to shoot both now
---
It's called free range. Like any other event other than encryption or whatever its called, you will have to check ur map for the event.
---
Agree, I think it depends on your level.  
---
1H melee, build, at the moment, the most difficult, in order are:
---
Assultron that goes stealth - ala the one in Atlas observatory
---
Radscorpions
---
Merluck Queen
---
Maj/Col Gutsies
---
Added you PSN SquatCh_D0G
---
You’re confusing me so much now.  Are you trying to buy a used PS4 copy?  Just go to game stop or Best Buy and get one. They wouldn’t sell them used if it broke tos. Hands down you would see the uproar all over these Reddit forums about it by now.  Do you know how many copies were returned for credit when the game first came out..... ALOT.
---
I enjoy a bridge just a bit north of you
---
Pathetic
---
I know :( But it looks so fun to stand around for hours to get some juicy junk i just wanted to try it out but suddenly someone killed me and it was so not fun. I'm angry ahhhhhhhhhhhh \~
---
Up voted for the sheer reason of using the word fucknuckles.
---
Im saying maybe watch the sunset, talk with other people, make it more about going for a swim with people, but dont focus on scrounging up every single seashell and then constantly say theres not enough seashells on this beach. I posted a while about where they could take the game in a year, introduce different PvE factions (BoS comeback and start taking over / more and more raiders show up after SB's are all gone then have PvE events battleing each other and nuking each others strongholds) But I feel like the community more wants another looter shooter which I quiet frankly am fucking sick of.
---
Workshop definitely best option. Keep in mind weight limit is 9lbs, so while it's 8/hour, it will be full after 22.5 minutes with only 3 cores. You'll need to harvest those 3 cores before more continue to be produced.
---
Thanks for the tip on the "/", I'm always nervous as hell selling a bulk of weapons to a vendor, just sure I'm going to screw up.  Having keepers grouped at the bottom might help with that anxiety!! LoL
---
Ran across one with a laser on the road about halfway between watoga and bogtown.
---
Why are you claiming pvp workshops?
---
Sounds like you trolling, if you not obviously never carry junk while owning a workshop, immediately build a workbench and stash box and stash it and expect to be killed. Also I take thunder mountain I find less people want to go there and also there are schorchbeasts so people don't necessary want that power plant, but works for me just fine. Unless you need fusion cores or to complete a challenge, there is not good reason to take workshops anymore. In that case take it and switch worlds, so you don't own it anymore. if you think that is bad, they can come kill you anywhere in the world for kicks and caps .. avoid owning one unless you absolutely need it and don't just abandon it, change worlds so you don't own it anymore.
---
not even related
---
I think I'm on that same lake and it can be busy. I have joined a friends server and been told my camp was not placed and I've stood there watching someone else's camp despawing so I left and rejoined and my camp spawned.
---
There were two other camps nearby, one down the hill and another on the brahmin lake next to it which I could walk to in less than 30 seconds.
---
Wonder if she had the same issue
---
Where is it though? I know the name I just don't know where on the map it is.
---
well someone link the original image to compare this to as most of us have no $@#$$ idea what you are on about m8
---
I've noticed, at WS more than anywhere else, the bodies are becoming meat piles almost immediately. I know it's supposed to help the server, but it was like they were barely finished ragdolling before they changed over.
---
No thanks. Hated those things.
---
Yours?
---
If you think just getting a 3 star is rare then try getting the proc where it spawns 2 glowing noxious ones ans both at 3 star. That happened to me yesterday and I died on the first one, someone looted all my junk and the corpses disappeared when i killed the second one after respawning. THAT SUCKED!
---
Yeah, but he's listing the price for the whole set as ridiculously high. Sure it's expensive, but it's *the whole set*. I'm saying Bethesda doesn't really intend to make the whole set available cheap, e.g. for everyone, because it is intended to be rare. 
---
Even buying one for cash outright is steep, and I get that. But the people complaining they can't get everything in the shop without paying more than they paid for the game is irritating.
---
IKR I love playing a game standing in the same spot. It’s a shame other people don’t understand the pain
---
What a weak topic. Waste of bandwidth.
---
 how about a Black Russian
---
Well different people have very different ways to enjoy the beach. If there’s certain areas that take a lot of effort to get to, when you get there you enjoy the view but also see a lot of garbage under your feet, it’s a disappointment no matter how you look at it, that’s pretty much the boss fights in Fo76 today.
---
Yeah, I'm on Xbox. Still trying to gather items to sell to start a business.
---
oof, *f* . I guess too each his own, I guess, I just dont want another shitty looty shooty game especially since I love the fallout series. I WANT more story driven events or changes instead of getting more places designed just for grinding.
---
Not that I have found. The trail leaves harpers fairy headed north east towards maryland.
---
Fun times. I had somebody pull a similar stunt back when slap damage was still enabled. I was trying to get my wife into the game; she was around 15 and I was somewhere north of 100. I'm hanging out in her camp in stealth enjoying an adult beverage when some 25 shows up and starts harassing her -- weird shit, like trying to look up her skirt and stuff (civil war dress, at the time). I figure he's going to pull some shit, so I switch off pacifist and get a good bead on him with my lever action. She just sits down and starts playing her banjo and, sure enough, dude pulls out a fire axe and starts wailing on her. Managed to earn around a 5 cap bounty before the first shot rang out. He started spinning around trying to figure out where it came from, but of course I was invisible.... BOOM... headshot. 
---
My wife quietly stands up, bends down, and steals all his junk. We have a laugh and switch servers.
---
And as it obviously detects the other boundary it could snap to it too to enable better space use etc.
---
Love this idea.
---
Sorry.
---
I tossed 3 mini nukes into the face of a scorchbeast and it didn't do a thing really.. Was not impressed
---
true
---
in the golf club, definately yes.
---
Yea you place the punch bowl then go up to it click x for transfer and use square to assign which alcohol can be consumed through the bowl
---
do you even read what you type? and you honestly dont believe you are being shitty?
---
ugh i feel sorry for whoever has to put up with you in real life then
---
good luck with all that! lol
---
people expect you to max out multiple characters to get that 60,000
---
Yup and i have never got response on armor i was looking for and this isnt ebay stupid
---
Yeah pretty sure that is the same one. There are 3 Brahmin always on the neighbouring lake uphill. It's a nice spot and she found the acid deposit totally by accident. I wish there was a way to scout out resources like that before placing the camp ... she is on the dry creek that forms a gap between there and the brahmin lake, just encompasses the boat and cave, happens to include the acid. She is considering moving simply because she loses her pet megasloth whenever it cannot be placed.
---
Survival is for those who dont want to get paid
---
Game coding secret, “random”is just a fancy word for created preset.  If you click random enough times you’ll see the same ones pop up again.
---
It's great! That's what I like doing, finding a location and making a base to fit it. I had a nice one with those steel power towers
---
Dont cry
---
My strength is at 36 with nerd rage / full unyielding etc
---
Come find me if you have the balls
---
ok, then how do you give them the caps over multiple characters if you can only log on to one at a time. also how can they except to hold all those caps if the limit is 25k
---
and if they wait for you to give them all of those caps for the weapon, what is stopping them from just leaving or blocking you once they drain you of 25k from one character.
---
Hell, I've had 0 luck farming spawn points. I find more just wandering around but they're always from the same two series.
---
I'm on Xbox, otherwise I would ;)
---
I think you all are missing the point of what OP suggested. They aren't saying it would be easier for Bethesda to build a cube for the camp over a sphere, they're saying a cube would be easier for players to build in since most buildings are also rectangular. 
---
Since the CAMP is spherical though you end up with a lot of unusable space near the edge of the sphere since you can't go right to the edge with any rectangular buildings.
---
It starts in quite a few areas
---
Southern bell motel in the mire
---
Big Fred BBQ shack in savage divide 
---
And somewhere up top of the forest but can't remember the name
---
Yep, that's exactly where I am.
---
I actually checked the resource map for an acid spot that was central ish on the map then spent almost two hours searching the area with no luck. I was about to give up when it changed to night and I saw the slight glow, never expected it to be there.
---
As far as I know, you cannot craft those yet. 
---
Should be more mixed drink recipes coming out.
---
Because if you're close enough, your build areas can still intersect...
---
That's such bs, what's the point of even having a set zone for workshops then?
---
I killed it in two hits and the event wouldn't complete &gt;&lt;
---
I loved Gun Runners Arsenal!  For it just adding weapons, they added great weapons.  I miss The Smitty Special and Sprtel-Wood 9700.
---
I hope something similar comes to Fallout 76.  They really should add weapons from the previous games.
---
&gt; Actual PC keybinding for all actions.
---
You are absolutely right. That should've been my post.
---
Thanks man!
---
1. Not "your" server
---
2. I would go around and take all the fuckin workshops just to spite you and laugh as you die to me and my teammates over and over if you dared to try and fight us. ;)
---
3. Raiders suuuuuuuuck
---
And you would be killed repeatedly
---
i agree its stupid! did you not get that jist from my original post?
---
Anytime you want, come have a look on the floor in Artisan's Corner in Whitespring. I leave at least 5 mini-nukes, 20 harpoons and 20 missiles on the floor in there every day.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i\_made\_a\_map\_of\_resource\_deposits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/)
---
LOL that's cute, you think you could take me 😂
---
At level 78 you probably haven’t killed ‘sooooo many legendaries’ yet. Get a good tool for farming (like a ghoul slayer melee weapon etc) then keep grinding at whitespring, you’ll get your dream drop eventually 💪
---
I started my own character and after camping in a few locations with water I gave up on relying on scrap acid from loot. Went looking for an acid deposit ... sadly whilst I have one, purified water is a pain and slow to produce now. 
---
I didn't know it glowed through water at night ... handy to know.
---
No prob!  It doesn't get any easier than Whitespring haha.  I stuck some junk on him to maybe(?) hold him longer.  I've see him sit for hours and I don't know if it was because I put a weapon on him before.
---
Yeah. I usually go to 50% health for those and the Troubleshooter’s mitigates the damage loss while letting me take a hit. Then it’s just a matter of closing to shred, stagger, and cripple the damned things.
---
Would love mannequins and more songs if not another radio station. 
---
I don't see why we would hide your level tho.
---
you got a photo I'm wondering where that spawn point is?
---
It took you 30 minutes to kill them both?
---
Yeah, he was still there and there was junk in it when I got there.
---
Lmao!! ❄❄❄snowflakes I'll even give you a cute koala shrug the standard one may hurt your feelz ¯\\\_ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ_/¯
---
absolutely rifleman. ALL of them. Adrenaline, All of them, 1 gun Fu maybe.  Better Crits, Four leaf clover. the sneak attack ranged, all of them. you'll 1 shot a SB no problem. thats pretty much a great weapon
---
Never happen'd to me (Xbox), but when strange stuff happens i usually power down and remove the power cord for a few seconds, test that :)
---
No idea what they were thinking. I know that initially the workshops were going to be the only buildable areas in the game -- no camps. So maybe that factors into the mechanic in some way. But it's definitely something they need to revisit, imo.
---
remember, raiders are the pawns of fallout, weak and worthless
---
Aren't there are three power plants?
---
Does it not count wood from scrapping items?
---
I find the mob of gutsys is probably the toughest, when you deal with one, others with shred you from all directions. For bigger enemies like the scorchbeast and the queen it’s actually a lot easier.
---
Average reply from someone like you.
---
Find someone's workshop at a power plant, most of the time I've gone to these places they havnt locked the fusion core resource collector.... voila free fusion cores lol
---
I didn't confirm when I did he quest but my guess is no
---
Man I have been camped next to a spot just south of Morgantown trying to get razorgrain and I am having to wait. It's for that new mission with the frat and nukashine. I got the ingredients then had a hell of a time getting to nuka quantum and by then the food was spoiled. So now I am dicking around waiting for razorgrain to grow and I only need one more. I'm definitely gonna start farming every veggie. Lol
---
Just checked to see which platform you are on, I'm on Xbox, so unfortunately I can't help you.
---
There’s something they should fit in with the Pioneer Scout storyline!
---
It's a very popular opinion that fallout isn't a looter shooter. It's why this game is so hugely unpopular. It's like a fallout game with far far less quests or content mixed with a looter shooter that is worse than every other looter shooter on the market. 
---
Fallout is a game about story, that is why this game is a 52 on metacritic.
---
I hate having to look through my stash and posting what I have for sale.  It gets really old.  I would rather just put my stuff up for sale and have random people come buy and browse my wares or to just tell people to take a look.
---
“It’s spherical, SPHERICAL”
---
I know it no question
---
It might have been in the game just unavailable, like In the dev room. It's coming soonish I guess
---
Yep like that. Except that you can with patience replace and even move stairs. We bought the new stairs from the atom shop to replace the pillar and iron mesh standard stairs. You cannot take that put directly because "part of your structure would be inaccessible". However if you add an outside stair and single floor panel to the top, then change the wall section next to it to a doorway, you can then remove the internal stair unit and build new inside stairs. Finally it's ok to remove temporary outside stairs and change door back to a wall.
---
I frequently have to join though the XBL menu because of that, not sure how it's working on other platforms.
---
Yes my wife is very lovely - thank you lol
---
Come try me
---
Lmaooooo no you don't. I'd kick your ass and laugh as my teammates come along and kill you repeatedly until you would leave
---
If you're on PS4 you could buy some cores from me..
---
Yeah, it's right here:  https://my.playstation.com/whatsnew/gallery/83b89ff0-6c27-11e9-b843-0216ff64d594
---
That was my first good explosive drop as well, bloodied explosive pump, can’t imagine how many creatures I’ve killed with it. Before that was a two shot explosive laser, which broke so fast I got really frustrated and sold it after a few repairs. Got another one later right before they removed it from Legendaries altogether.
---
id also like to know, im at work now or else id hit up OP's offer
---
I’m aware of this. But the distance that you need between camps right now is kind of unnecessary to me.  I’m not saying they need to bump up right next to each other but close enough to where you can make it look like a community would be cool.
---
Yea, my character was only level 43 and my 300 damage civil war gun was broken.
---
10/10 reference
---
Yeah
---
It is black and gold yes!
---
Thanks, you rock!
---
And you can’t respec, is that correct?
---
Yes you would need a team to take me
---
i mean, this all kind on Bethesda isnt it? why are you berating regular players who are playing the game the way Bethesda has created it?
---
Yeah its normal or yeah its a bug
---
Hmm, food for thought here, I might take a look at that explosive harpoon of mine...
---
ugh, i hurts to read that but its true isnt it?
---
**NO MORE BURROWING ENEMIES PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD**
---
Nah I can take you out on my own. Repeatedly. My teammates would join cause they would want in on the fun of kicking your dumb raider ass 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
That's a solid top 5 -thank you
---
Lol yeah it's normal. All you have to do is be in the area when the event ends and you get rewarded. To get loot from the enemies you have to have done damage to them.
---
I'd like the bloodied railway.  If available.  How about 3k?
---
There is a race condition here between the list being updated and a scrap request to the server.
---
Likely the server doesn’t care if an item is legendary and unscrapable while the client does.
---
Why waste server resources on something that can’t be exploited for gain?
---
On PS4 the easiest way I found was to make a Twitter account specifically for the purpose, then post the pics there, then hop on phone/computer &amp; save em. Pain, but it works. Sure there is something similar for Xbox as well.
---
Bring it little man
---
Again, would if I played on PS4
---
You actually can pick up the quest for that one at a motel..
---
You have to be under the effect of the alcohol when you do the crit strike.  If the Blackwater Brew has worn off when you crit then it won't count.  I think it only lasts 1 minute or so.
---
What? Diablo 2 was. Hack and slash looter, not a strategy game. D2 would be closer to borderlands and other looters. And it absolutely had an online only part to the game where most people played.
---
Nice base + very creative. Plus I love the egg pyramid. Is that so you can find your base entrance?
---
they are plotting against you!!!!
---
Unfortunately I'm very familiar with that response, but haven't lost anything recently.
---
I save my .45s for the radium rifle, I find it better personally although I have no data to back that up.
---
AFAIK the handmade is pretty much the best semi auto rifle you can get next to the lever action
---
dont need to, your worthless and weak
---
Yeah on PC it stores them locally. I believe the reason for the cap on console is because those pictures are stored in the cloud
---
I'm with OP, I think those people just aren't very creative. In the past few weeks I've seen some amazing camps and groups of people doing things like running a bar, shop, trade hub, pet store, church. I've been to a live gameshow where the wrong answer got you killed, fight clubs, and blowout after parties.
---
I see that now. I think I was in denial for the longest time, thinking its what you make of it but now really see whats in the shadows
---
Still break way too fast to be useful, come on Bethesda why such hate towards lasers, it needs to last at least 5x longer to be on par with non energy weapons.
---
Oh ok, kindof stupid that you get rewards for just being there though.
---
Me and my brother would have something close to settlement size without overlapping each other if this were possible
---
Also another form of proof it’s not an issue. This game is available to rent on redbox and game fly.... one copy being used by multiple people.
---
That's what you get for wearing that ridiculous suit around a post apocalyptic wasteland. 
---
Players like you belong on a cross.
---
This makes complete sense.  Yesterday I tagged both Sheepsquatch at the end of a Free Range event immediately as they spawned.  Once dead, neither one produced legendary loot.
---
This seems to be an extension of the issue where one-shotting legendary enemies right after they spawn results in no legendary loot (which has happened to me multiple times, most recently last weekend with the Gutsy at the end of AWOL).
---
Until Bethesda fixes this, you basically have to give legendaries plenty of extra time to spawn in before you attack to ensure they drop something.
---
Im not so much berating players for playing the game, Im more berating players for bitching constantly, giving feedback and turning this into a game that bethesda shouldnt be making.
---
It's coming, I'm sure of it. They know that there is a finite amount of gear to loot, and eventually people will get tired of it when the next best looter shooter enters the fray. 
---
Personally, I would like to see a map wide invasion of hundreds of super mutants and behemoths just tearing everything apart. The only way to stop it is to keep running events and missions into west tek and other spawning sites. Maybe it runs over the course of like a month, with progress bar towards completion being tracked on a community level so no one person with the best setup can solo it and stop the invasion. 
---
Everyday every player will be tasked with a mission to stop the Super Mutants which will require teaming up to do. Maybe you are defending one of the many locations across the map, and if you fail it the Super Mutants gain another spawn site. Finish the daily objective, and the community bar inches closer to victory. 
---
At the end, an all out battle against the final push of unstoppable Behemoths so strong it will takes days of shooting to finally put them down. If we fail, a region of the map should be taken over by nothing but Super Mutants, and so many of them that it will make it much harder to go about your business in that area. 
---
Or they could do something with the survivors coming from outside of Appalachia seeking resources, starting a resource war with us 76's. Fail to stop them and all of sudden certain areas are picked clean of the shit we farm everyday. 
---
And then the Vaults will open, which we already know is coming as they are suppose to be the new dungeons (?)...
---
We also have that Nuclear Winter thing coming too, and something to do with scouts, so we do have things to look forward to but till then we just gotta keep grinding away, because what else is there?
---
I really love the Nukashine myself- it looks really smooth and the gold helmet is really nice.
---
I've been wanting a more badass looking PA set but the War just doesn't feel like Fallout to me. Looks more like it belongs in like Diablo or WOW - just my 2 cents.
---
No luck :/ I have an update for rocket league that is successfully installing right now, but when I switch it to updating FO76 it just stays stuck in one spot.
---
That's just how the events work. I had my camp set up in Flatwoods for a while. Someone would come along 2-3 times a day and do the fertile soil event. I'd be in my camp crafting stuff and get rewarded. Good times.
---
as of this writing, not all at once.
---
Once you hit L50, every time you level, you can Either
---
1. move a single point from one category to another  - or
---
2. pick another perk card
---
Since I made L50, and I'm content with my point distribution for now, I've been picking new cards and leveling  them up for specific purposes - mainly for crafing and trade. (combining hard bargain 1's to make hard bargain 3, combining armor/weapon repair, etc.)
---
you can get plans from BOS ft Defiance desk on 4th floor
---
Right on the bridge it's self.
---
Lucky. The only 3 star I've found rewarded me with a 1 star bolstering leather arm.
---
I have only spawned in 4 times so far.  I haven't had any issues yet.
---
They all have to be in the same picture?
---
I got chased by 6 glowing mirelurk kings yesterday. You better believe I ran.. right into two other players. They killed half while I killed the other half.
---
Exactly. I don't want a stupid mushroom cloud hair-do, I want a paint job for my goddamn combat rifle and submachine gun. 
---
The fact they don't have a skin for every type of weapon just bewilders me.
---
strange, any other thing i can think of is that "clear catch / game data" thing, might be worth testing that first as well :/
---
I was wondering the same thing.
---
You can put down the new red and white checkered blanket under the table - punch bowl in the middle with maybe a couple little succulents on the table - plus the fasnacht confetti - balloons\~ those items work great for a party vibe
---
THIS
---
My friend put all beer and 1 nukashine in
---
i can see bitching about the many bugs and server instability, or bitching about the inflation of trading subs (60,000 caps for one gun???)
---
and what is wrong with giving feedback anyway? why is that bad?
---
and again, you cant blame players for playing a game which was created with the RNG roulette wheel of looter shooter mechanics
---
you cant make people play the way you want..
---
 i say all this, but i do agree with you about there should be MORE to this game than chasing legendaries
---
It's more like boss enemies at the end of events that are guaranteed legendary. It would appear that the game might spawn them in before being assigned as legendary.
---
You're lucky. I was changing some perks up, and I think I accidentally hit drop on my tse handmade. Couldn't find the bag anywhere. My best gun gone.
---
I take a workshop south of my camp every once in a while to top up on concrete and copper when they're getting low.  Usually it's a couple waves of 40+ ghouls or some super-mutants to scare away. Two nights ago it was three waves of radtoads. That was terrifying.  They destroyed a fair amount of my workshop and killed me twice by just swarming me and ripping me to shreds. I did end up with a crapload of radtoad omelettes when all was said and done.
---
10/10 would defend again.
---
A wandering pack of glowing Kings are without a doubt the toughest enemy I 'be encountered.
---
Agreed! I was level 20 when I wondered onto deathclaw island. When it popped up I peed a little, but was like a 2 min successful battle. I die when I visit top of the world almost is seconds.
---
Thanks for giving us a “cribs” style look into your pad!  I’m in the ash heap so I know all about being in a terrible looking area haha 😂. Sick setup man!  👍🏻👍🏻
---
50+ Gutsy eats through my ammo just as much as his eats through me.
---
Recently a player trashed my workshop at Grafton Steel. Just destroyed everything &amp; didn't even contest the workshop. Anyway, he becomes wanted &amp; I caught a glimpse of him on the map before he fast-travelled to WS station. I turn off pacifist and head over there, and as I'm killing him he gives the "confused" emoji, like he doesn't know. He dies, I take his (substantial) junk pile, and log off. Small compensation for having my workshop destroyed, but maybe he learned something.
---
Hope those are some quality rounds bro... 200 sounds is less than a drop in a bucket
---
good idea!
---
For others maybe. For me I'm having trouble finding the lead to make them.
---
I did mine at Sunrise Field. There seems to always be at least two Mirelurk Kings around the area and a Queen pops out of the water after attacking a few Mirelurks. All you have to do is wait for the Queen to spit out eggs and then go wait on the roof of the shed for all them to get close enough together.
---
You need 3 different things in a picture, I managed to get the Queen, King and Hatchlings in 1 picture and for my 2nd char, I got a Queen, King and Radroach. They can be dead or alive, but I did it alive. I did mine just south of Watoga. The key is 3 different things, I had 1 Queen, 2 Kings and 2 Hatchlings on my 2nd success, have 1 Queen and 2 King's doesn't work. I have a video if anyone needs.
---
The quills weigh 0.2lbs, the skull weighs 3 lbs. I farmed the event a bunch of times and kept getting overencumbered quicker after each time. Finally realized I had like 12 skulls tying up 36lbs of weight.
---
the problem is most of the times I run into them I get 3 of them and only see them at 5-10 feet and get slapped around then as I try to use marsupial they knock me out of the air - because they all hit me I keep getting knocked down and even with defenses like bonuses against melee its just matter of time before I'm stun locked 
---
luckily I play in a team 90% of the time so when this happens friend can pull 1 of them giving me time to break off and use my heavy firepower to level the play field as he uses his mobility to dodge and weave
---
Niceee nicee. You can take a picture after they are dead too.
---
The Combat rifle is still pretty sweet, I have a bloodied that I use regularly.
---
the handmade is better, i have an all rifle non auto perk build, and handmades out perform combat rifles
---
Yes, this is how it works. Without an event timer on the map this is how it should continue to work. I hate it when I see an event, fast travel, and then it's almost over. Being able to join an event last second and still get the rewards helps make up for the times I've wasted time, caps, and food spoilage showing up to a failed event. Also, some of the events are dang fast. I got the notification for Encryptid while crafting at Whitespring. I immediately stashed my junk, hopped in power armor and fast traveled. I got there in time to only get a single shot off on the imposter before it was over. Got the imposter outfit for my trouble.
---
I don't have trouble with this - pick up canned dog food wherever you go - you get plenty of purified water + radaways and stuff from completing events.
---
they really are a horror show weapon each of those mini grenades does almost as much damage as a full standard frag and if you get caught in between all of them wow is it bad to be you 
---
I mean I've crippled both legs of a death claw and cleared 65-70% of his hp in one detonation
---
Only the horns are needed for the sheepsquatch staff and club. The quills for the sheepsquatch shards. And the skull doesn’t have a purpose other than scrap for none as far as I know.
---
I can vouch as well, I have a 1* bloodied that I carry around on my bloodied melee character and it’s a solid setup!
---
What level do lever rifles start  dropping? I haven’t found one yet and I’m at about lvl 30; are they better than hunting rifles? Sorry if I’m bothering anyone
---
A group of difficult monthly challenges could be nice. Not just long collection challenges but something interesting.
---
Kill a Deathclaw with a Tomahawk from 100 ft away.
---
Kill 3 Enemies with a single Power Armor Impact Landing.
---
Kill an Enemy by shooting a thrown grenade in VATS.
---
I think there's one in Sugar Grove.
---
Since I hang out in flatwoods sometimes to trade and get food from Brahmin I normally lurk around and give the fresh vault meat some aid / clothes / plans to get them started.
---
Lol
---
Hey buddy, I bought you a $10 Xbone gift card. Check your personal messages for the info :)
---
I think this would be a perfect idea and it really makes sense
---
What system do you play on? I have a few vendors that are still active.
---
Favoriting an item will get you an extra confirmation screen when you go to scrap it. Haven't tried selling or trading a favorited item yet.
---
Unless you hit a guaranteed spawn spot Behemoths are rare. I've ran into maybe two. The one I know for sure happened as a random enemy at the Whitesprings entrance.
---
There is no "end game" for a wanderer.
---
Lol. Man that sucks.   
---
On a related note, I had that happen to me once, and I jumped down and didn't die. I got all the stuff out of it and then fast traveled to my CAMP.
---
Sure. I was just thinking we would get a mail box to put in our camp and if someone doesn’t then they just don’t want any mail or maybe have it how eso has it
---
Correct, i killed and watched the thing goes from solid to invisible before my eyes. When it died it definitely wasn’t transparent. I don’t think it’s a bug, it’s just an added difficulty. The theory is probably since nobody is running the pylons any more it would go back to invisible. Just use the new camera to locate it, it tells you what you’re looking at, when the body is in the view, the upper right corner would say ‘imposter assaultron’.
---
This made me want to look the episode out again
---
Change it to a 38
---
The same happened to me. I dropped my shotgun and my friend tried to grab it
---
Ok that’s nice advice for from user
---
The spawn rate at Whitesprings was probably changed to help server stability.
---
Lucky Hole mine with Excavator armor get loads of crystal and lead.
---
The rendering for multiple CAMPS in sight of each other would be very intensive. My current max budget CAMP takes a couple of minutes to build out for example.
---
Lever rifles are levels 35+45 only. Idk if you need to be lvl 35 or the mobs.
---
Is it near that lake in the Whitesprings Golf Course? I also deal with constant BloodRage to Glowing Mirelurks.
---
I've seen a lot of people mention that the SBQ does not drop serums... Do you happen to know which patch they were removed from her loot pool in?
---
Let me throw some numbers at you.
---
The base semi-auto Combat Rifle deals 40 damage at a fire rate of 33 (note: fire rate equals amount of rounds per 10 seconds, so divide by 10 for per second). This equals out to 132 damage per second.
---
The base semi-auto Handmade deals 45 damage at a fire rate of 40. This equals out to 180 damage per second.
---
However...
---
An automatic combat rifle has 36 damage at fire rate of 75. This is 270 DPS.
---
An automatic handmade has 41 damage at 75 fire rate. This is 307.5 DPS.
---
So an automatic combat rifle is still pretty decent, but the handmade seems to be better in terms of damage. If you have the same exact legendary stats on a combat rifle and a handmade, the handmade is better. The combat rifle is still a good weapon though. I use an assassins explosive -25% vats cost automatic combat rifle and it is a monster.
---
I suggest you keep your combat rifle, but switch it to automatic. The combat rifle has the lowest fire rate of the 4 semi-auto rifles (assault, radium, and handmade all seem to have 40 fire rate. combat only has 33) making it arguably the worst. Fire rates seem to be 75 across all 4 of those rifles when automatic. I need to test radium some more, it seems the speedy receiver can pump that up to 90. The standard automatics may likely have 75 fire rate.
---
PC
---
If you don't feel like taking workshops that produce them or farming them otherwise, find a person of high enough level that is likely to have some. Most of the time if I am critically low, I just hit people up for trade. Most have a surplus and will let them go for cheap if not for free or  for trade
---
Hopefully it stays that way for you. The biggest plus is that it is far enough away from the blast zone
---
I dropped my gun on an enemy (while looting) due to lag. I didn't notice right away so when I looted it back I'm like " OH SHIT BABE, I'VE JUST LOOKED A FUCKING TSE COMBAT SHOTGUN". T'was mine already. I coulda just left it there, unbeknownst to me. GG Glad  you got yours back too!
---
Yeah I hope it was indeed the last time you said it. You've brought no answer to my questions and you've apparently not read my posts.
---
"If" you kill a monster before it hits you you're better than melee. Except it required you to be stealthy, far off, have ammos, to spare on stims. 
---
If you need 10-30 sec per kill, you are absolutely not better than melee. If you need to farm ammo crafting material half an hour every time you want to play, you are not better than melee.
---
If you are effective only when you have a vats crit available, you are not better than melee.
---
End of discussion you are apparently unable to bring anything.
---
I like the outfits. I wear a different one every day. Today I’m wearing a swimsuit, tomorrow I’ll be wearing a longshoreman outfit. It’s fun to dress up!
---
What?! Have any proof they can be applied to any PA type?
---
I think that would make it even sadder. Although, I feel like this is realistic as it seems to be a very small town IRL that has a yearly event and then it's dead the rest of the time.
---
Nope. On the other side of the pond from where the sheepsquatch spawns, south of top of the world.
---
Lol nice! First, people are freaking weird man. Sometimes I’ll just watch people and observe some totally random and strange things... which in turn probably makes me equally, if not more, weird than them! Lol. Second, I had a guy in stealth messing with me last night so I took some berry mentats. It highlighted the other players but not him. What prevents a person from being seen?
---
I have the opposite problem. I don't use power armor unless in a nuke zone and am constantly having to dump ones that aren't 100%. I currently have 9 on my character and 10 on a mule.
---
 I still appreciate the offer!
---
I had something disappear a few weeks ago, and frantically searched every character (I have 15) and was very disappointed after not finding it, then seemingly out of nowhere the item in question turned back up a few days ago.
---
The character that had the weapon is one I occasionally store Items I don't want to trade on, so I had checked his Stash on more than one occasion, and the weapon was definitely not showing up.
---
Easy to say. But it’s hard when you have late stage depressive disorder caused by a severe trust issue and a sense of abandonment around pretty much anyone in your life. I won’t even trust you when you’re right across my face wired to 3 lie detectors and you want me to make friends online?
---
Themed loot tables across the board.
---
I find it funny/ironic because most of them don a red paint.
---
Those weight rooms get farmed so much the server has trouble syncing. Don't even bother with the gyms, grab your excavator armor and go to the Lucky Hole Mine and collect the ore. The ore is instanced a will always be there for you.
---
I mainly mean the mods make it a hastle since you either have to farm the SBQ or pay out the ear in the market.
---
I think the answer is as simple as a prompt asking you whether you want to give up the workshop, or defend it against another player.
---
Choose to give it up, the new owner takes your place.
---
Choose to defend it and PVP begins... maybe an event should spawn which will invite the server to participate the same way you can when defending against enemies. People joining the event can either choose to be defender or attacker... you show up, click on the workbench, choose either. Upon successful completion you get the normal event rewards for defending or taking a workshop, while the person who claimed or contested keeps ownership. 
---
Honestly though, I can see them eliminating PVP from the adventure server once they get all of kinks straightened out over at survival. With the removal of slap damage, and eventually CAMPS, and I can kind of see PVP going away in adventure mode. 
---
It may just be a matter of time.
---
I've got two moderately high level characters.
---
I have yet to finish the main quest line. I have barely touched the new smaller content batches.....
---
Still haven't seen every location. 
---
When most players say "There's nothing left to do" I just assume they finished the main quest line and went right to farming. Skipped a ton of side quests, passive stories, and exploration.
---
They rushed to the farming.....then complain about it.
---
Groves Family Cabin
---
You realize how common ammo is ? It's not a resource you really have to look for. I can get a vats crit in 3 shots with an automatic weapon. it'll melt everything
---
I think it depends per platform too because I got a few the other day for about 1500 each
---
Meh.
---
This would be great! I would hardcore farm ash heap for specific firebreather loot!
---
Dude a guy did that to me the other day too! Then another guy claimed thunder mountain and as I returned I watched him put the generator and crafting tables in storage then logged off. Wtf is he going to do with that!? It just stays at the work shop right? Why come and just blatantly be a dick? Just going and destroying a workshop simply so no one can use it? I don’t get it.
---
This! One Run and i netted over 300 Lead with super duper. Also you get crystal which sells for 3 caps a piece on the market
---
Need one?  I’ll make you one if you want. 👍🏻
---
I’m a bloodied melee build. I tried it without power armor for a minute, and it’s too dangerous. So now I’m a power armor bloodied melee build. And I’m invincible. Sometimes. Unless I get swarmed. But my super sledge does like 900 damage so I’m fine usually. (Out of power armor, I have some unyielding pieces and my super sledge does over 1000 damage.)
---
Ok, thanks! I’d been wondering; are they better than hunting rifles though?
---
Yeah did that in the end. Got 250 pics worth of film so I’m good for a while now :)
---
Ooh thanks for the tip.  Never been there.
---
I recall players suggesting that the combat rifle has a niche for VATS-heavy builds due to using less AP, but I haven't tested it. I wonder if anyone can confirm or refute that?
---
For a while my base was set up on a junkpile in a pond that constant spawned 4-6 rad toads. Every single time I went to my camp, the toads were there. They dealt no damage to me and would typically only take down one or two fences before my 5 lvl 1 turrets would grind them down. They were pathetic. 
---
So many omelettes and grilled toad legs though. So many.
---
One of the best things about this game imo is the looting.  I'm not big on the story. The only part I have liked is the Rose parts and the bunker. The overseers quest does very little for me. 
---
Saying that, i can spend hours hunting legendaries in white springs and never feel let down.
---
I was fighting a guy on survival in watoga and he killed me and when I went back to see if I had a bag left, there was was a bag with a vampires explosive gatling gun with reduced weight on be ground right where I had died. I messaged him and ask if he was missing something. Told him to tell me what it was, he did, and he was like “wtf how did that happen, thank you so much.”
---
Exactly
---
Explore - loot - craft
---
The entire game is based on this loop. So I guess the game is more than a looter shooter, but those other parts are baked in to the loot loop.
---
 And rats
---
Yeah unfortunately I'm not keeping any of my camera pictures because I don't want to delete all the ones I have already.
---
At least a change at a legendary urban armor would make it worth it.
---
If this was the only game that existed that would all be a good point, but other games have that stuff AND good story and mechanics. It's not like this is the first game to ever invent online play or something.
---
I'm not sure about the armor (haven't found NPC DR/ER in the ESM yet), but you're certainly correct about the HP. Deathclaws have a pretty wide HP range but top out at 1725 (level 91). The Sheepsquatch varies from 4000-5000.
---
Flatwoods monster mind-controlling a scorchbeast and his band attacked my camp few days ago. That was crazy, you can search him for days and then he just comes to mess your razorgrain. 😁
---
Yea I’m going to make some more right now lol. I’ve been leaving all the frags was on super mutants but I’m going to start picking them up. And also I have made 1 quantum grenade but I won’t use it because it feels like it’s really valuable or something!! Lol
---
Honestly would have just server hopped
---
There are trails you can find north of the Mega Red Rocket station, but they don't lead anywhere, basically just criss cross around in the mountains. I'm guessing they will add something in with the Pioneer Scouts update, as that would tie pretty well in.
---
More than agree
---
I transferred a couple fusion cores from my trunk to my inventory, but they disappeared. Frustrating when those things happen.
---
I don't like paying 100 Atoms for the Bye Now emote though :(
---
They didn't even get that song again.....
---
I honestly don't understand why people have so much trouble with Gutsy.  Sure, he hits somewhat hard, you need to pay attention and deal with him, but he's not stupid hard in my experience, and he goes down quick if you focus fire on his arms/thruster.
---
I'll take high-level Gutsys over high-level yao guai or mirelurks any day.
---
Also thanks for the tip
---
Though i have to say i DID get lucky at the gym a few times.  And i dont mean with the Ladys either ;P
---
Still a banger
---
You can't put SPECIAL beyond 15 points. You'll need to trim out perks to get the last thing you want.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
The only downside to this is that I Need to also farm the accid to process the ore I guess
---
I just, very sadly, deleted all of my photo gallery to make more room, knowing it would mess up my loading screen pics.  And I had some really good ones.  Thankfully they're saved in the capture gallery, but I won't be able to see them anymore as loading screen pics.
---
That’s what i did too, simply explored while overencumbered until I could handle most enemies with ease, then do the quests and the events that require a lot of fast travel.
---
And yet the legendary night king only dropped ice chunks! Not even a fucking drill for God's sake
---
Also don’t forget the barbells in the silos, flatwoods motel and in the courtyard of the prison (lots of hanging cans there too)
---
Could be, but my console stores them locally as well.  My capture gallery on PS4 still has all of my old pics even though I've deleted them from the photo gallery in-game.  Maybe it's a RAM limitation?
---
I mean, this is literally options people can do in fallout 3,nv,4 and all the elder scroll games, people using the console and mods to turn on cheats is a thing people have always done in this series and this company's series.
---
Agreed!
---
Well it is more than a looter shooter it just doesn't doing any of the "more" well.
---
The fight clubs are also a fantastic time.
---
that face tho, "accept this or i will murder you"
---
It's just a bug that's been happening recently with all ground textures, it'll switch to a LOD version, or one without proper lighting. When I fast travel to my CAMP, I tend to get bright red ground around my campsite even though I'm not in an area where the dirt should be that colour. It fixes itself after a few minutes, but it's best not to read anything into this.
---
Which of these online games with great stories and mechanics do you speak of?
---
At -75% AP cost (automatic + legendary effect), I get well over 20 rounds off with 15 AGI in vats. Checking AP costs is a bit difficult to do. You need to shoot something in vats, deactivate, open pipboy, and check action points.
---
I suppose it is not impossible to test if you are fast enough.
---
I really hope we get more little events like this throughout the year 🤞
---
I’m level 210 with 600 hours in the game. I’ve done literally every quest, side quest, misc quest, unmarked treasure hunt, etc. that is known to the community. I’ve explored every single location in the game, some of them many times. My CAMP is fully decorated and budget is maxed. I only log in to do daily challenges at this point.
---
Im hopeful it will.   Makes me mad for sure.  One of my best drops I've had.
---
If someone is stupid enough to take all their junk to the event then they deserve to have it stolen, I literally only do the event to get a ton of junk from idiots now.
---
If you're just comparing non-legendary rifles, Frito it totally correct. The downsides are primarily that it uses more exotic ammo (not a huge problem when/if you get the ammosmith perk), and they aren't all that common in the wild, so you have to make and scrap a bunch of them to get the mods (assuming you bought the plans). However, the lack of recoil and hip fire accuracy more than make up for that.
---
I emptied a full plasma core into her a few nights ago and got nothing and no XP from her death. I think it might be related to the legendary bug brought up recently where if you damage something too soon after you load in, it hasnt run the script yet that sets it to legendary. Then when it does run, it disregards your first tag and then doesn't let you tag it again because you already have. So you get nothing. 
---
People have already said that explosives could be an issue, but shotguns can be a problem as well due to their spread and short range. I unloaded 20 shells into a flying SB a few days ago and got nothing when it died. Turned out it was just too far away and even though I got the cursor and sound feedback, it just wasn't enough to register the tag. So now I get off a rifle crit in vats to be sure of the tag and then go to town with my weapon of choice. On the queen, just wait a min to make sure she's fully loaded in before you start firing. Work on the adds while you wait.
---
Pretty sure the 'more voiced dialogue' counts holotapes too...
---
I foresee a musical bundle. Like new instruments, stage props or just stage pieces Etc. ;)
---
Fairly rare, and I sold one last week for about 3500caps
---
You're a charmer ain't ya lol ;)
---
Holotapes are a mere sliver of the story telling. 
---
The terminal entries and notes combined with environmental story telling are often fantastic. 
---
You can in fact empathize with the plight and struggles of dead people/characters.
---
You can get lots of acid from Hemlock Holes or you could farm like Yao Guais!
---
Only 3500? Dam I mean that's certainly more then what I paid for it but not nearly as much as I'd want to make off it lol
---
Pay 5$ for another 50 slots sounds like a good idea.
---
So there still is a way to get that last perk card even though I have 16 perception?
---
Last time me and a buddy did the event I activated all the pylons and my buddy healed me every so often. Was an epic cluster fuck and in the end I got sod all - them's the breaks lo :)
---
Never take your junk to encryptid - and at least you didn't pay the 2k caps for the card.
---
Ik I just meant it like there are a lot of dumb people on the internet
---
Glitches aren't some form of arcane technomancy...
---
They are literally the consequences of "poor coding"...
---
It's rare. I got mine after server hopping for a few days.
---
As to how much...maybe 3-5k give or take, that's a guess.
---
I’ve also seen them used as trade supplements if you were looking for certain items.
---
Uhh Diablo 2 never had regular content updates
---
Its ok. Nothing really exciting or outstanding. Wires running all over. Space seems inefficient especially with a PA station sitting in the hallway by two doors. Bedrooms are really small. I like that it isn't the standard super ugly box done in metal most people seem to go with. A good start to build off of and improve. 👍🏻👍🏻
---
I know, I wasn't seriously thinking you're the same person as another random on imgur.
---
well as i said i dont know if its true however i currently have 4 characters and each character has definitely a pattern of legendarys 
---
its just my personal experience and i can say this works for me when i run a new character i hord as much vampires,two shot , furious whatsoever weapons as i can and i usually end up with a weapon i do want
---
New content is coming out next week. It's one week without a update.
---
2500 at the lowest. But ive seen it go for 3.5k
---
Holy shit, I need you to go to work for BGS and make your super mutant idea happen, because that sounds amazing!! Of all the ideas I’ve read on this sub, this is by far my favorite.
---
Hax. But no, I have no clue. Maybe some mutation/gear combo?
---
Well, Rose WAS a human npc at one point, we just never got to see it.
---
What 10mm were you using? Ate through that thing
---
Yeah I don't get it. Some of the ones who contest workshops just want to PVP and can't hack it in survival mode. Others genuinely need the resources, which I'm cool with. But just to come break stuff for no reason is juvenile, so I assume those players are all 12 years old.
---
Maybe everything else but not the queen, a couple of times I got to the SBQ battle too late, blasted her with my minigun for about 10 sec before she died. 10 sec is pretty long for a minigun to deal a lot of damage, but nada nothing, not even a wing fragment, just empty loot box on the queen corpse. Those were the only times I got zero items from the queen. Apparently 10 sec of minigun damage wasn’t sufficient.
---
That seems like a forced decision on your part rather than some inability to empathize.  Splitting hairs over an arrangement of pixels on a screen.  The voice acting is done so well you have to TRY not to empathize to make that work.  
---
Not going to even mention the fact that it's a video game so this discussion itself is silly regardless, but it seems more on you if you see all the characters in the game as nothing but holotapes.
---
I have one, OP can have it if he can fix me a tamed imposter assulatron for my CAMP :) i really need one :)
---
The Crew I team with frequently take several workshops on a Server and hold them all day, I can't even remember ever losing one.
---
I'm on Xbox, so I don't know how tough things really are on PS4 Servers, but I routinely kill the seemingly invincible griefers, not to say you can't kill me, and I'm not really a fan of PVP in general, but when I need to, I've yet to find anyone I can't kill, I'm not a griefer or a Raider just a well tuned predator that preys on them, and I didn't buy my full set of Sentinel Armor.
---
I used to have a character running a VAT based black powder pistol + revolver build. Scorchbeast was probably the only problem I had because their body parts regenerate. Gutsy are as good as free kills as long as they don’t get to fire a single round at you. .50 cal arm first with a sneak crit shot with the black powder is a confirmed limb destruction. Then either either use your revolver to take out the thrusters or eyes.
---
Xbox, PS, or PC? A buddy of mine lost his torso couple weeks back, needs a jet pack all over again and would definitely buy it off you
---
But like I said. It's still better than the Garrahan paint job.
---
Those are all prefixes, you can't get a gun with anti armor *and* any of those. Pick one, that's what you want.
---
As others have suggested Hemlock Holes will yield plenty of acid, and bears, snallygasters and Wendigos are all good sources. On top of that you can also place your camp on an acid deposit and have a steady passive gain of acid every session.
---
Coming from a guy with the name DevilFangs I figure itd be something right up your alley
---
I still remember fo4 has this Deathclaw instant kill thing.
---
Bloodied vats crit with +1 AGL, here’s a short clip showing slightly better dmg.

So that's what having friends is like.
---
Exceptions do not make the rule, and even the one you used does not compare to FO76's situation. Firstly, Diablo 2 is not an online only game; Secondly, [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) servers were not the exclusive form of online mode; Thirdly, Diablo 2 has had limited patches, requiring less maintenance. An actual resource intensive game on the same platform that compares more to FO76, World of Warcraft, had a subscription fee.
---
I would've gone with Guild Wars 1, a buy-it-once, online only game with no capability to host your own servers; MMO in the towns but makes use of instanced areas outside; often updated (without almost any server downtime I might add) Though even then it had DLC in the form of new campaigns, and even though the game was generous enough that you never needed any, microtransactions existed for character slots and the likes.
---
What do you mean they didn't have content updates? They added new runewords every patch, added new end game bosses such as the hellfire diablo spawn, and uber tristram.
---
You can get a hazmat on top of the Poseidon main building.  YouTube has videos that show where. Wish I had the time to run around with you today. Next time.
---
Yes, after level 50 when you level you can either invest in a perk card and/or level one you have OR switch the location of a perk point. Every level after you get this choice.
---
Looks like you're feeling the effects.
---
They literally tell everyone when the planned patches and updates are.  There wasn’t supposed to be anything this week. It’s next week.  No need to trip out.
---
Good to know thank you.
---
yes every level up you can choose a new perk card regardless of what special point you upgraded and after level 50 you can choose to either switch a special point or choose a new perk card
---
so no worries you can have the next rank literally the next time you level up 👍🏼
---
You can get it right now if you want just switch out something else for master.
---
When you level up you assign a point and then it automatically goes to the attribute you added a point in but you can buy perk cards for other attributes instead.
---
Ok really stupid question as I still can't find this...how do I push to talk on a laptop with a built in Mic? I don't have a headset yet and I can't find the talk button. Sorry I'm nub.
---
Maybe build a camp and rp as a trader?
---
I use a berseker exploding 15% faster reload combat rifle and I LOVE it!
---
Take a break. Some new content coming May 7th, come back, check that out..
---
I like doing the daily and weekly challenges, keeps me busy.
---
Feeling lonely? Need friends? Tired of feeling "left out"??? WELL HAVE I GOT SOME SHIT FOR YOU, my psn name is buddy-crystal feel free to add me
---
We need more traders.
---
well i dont know you sir, but i dont like you just form the content of this one post
---
blocked!
---
Hmm. Im so tempted to do my alt bloodied.
---
I'm having the same issue, it's like they are forcing us to server hop when they made claim that this causes instability in the servers.  I love the game but sometimes I don't understand where they are directing us.
---
I’m 145 now and just recently started to explore the whole map again. I felt that i rushed through the story and way to many locations. Now I’m taking my time, wandering around, exploring, killing, gathering resources. It kinda feels relieving to just go out there and say “fuck you” to Whitesprings, Watoga and Westek. I even found locations I missed at the beginning!
---
Yeah, I tried all that, they were gone.
---
One of them disappeared, so I ran back to it's spawn and there was an unlootable body laying there. =(
---
The other one just poofed and an alive mob was at it's spawn point. Thank god they fixed that in patch 7.
---
You basically have two options. 
---
Lvl 49, you pick a different SPECIAL to +1 to then choice your last Rifleman Perk, probably needing to remove another perk to do so 
---
Or 
---
Lvl 51 select “chose a perk” rather than “move a SPECIAL point” and get your last Rifleman point that way.
---
Not 100% effective when you're spam scrapping.
---
If you’re using shotguns for sbq you need to get as close to her as possible, shotguns’ effective damage drops very quickly with distance. Especially if you have suppressor on your shotgun you probably did very little damage.
---
I'm not but the flow was going pretty well it sucks to stop it all of the sudden specially when some of the new stuff is lack luster
---
id rather it produce bottles of bootleg nuka cola
---
When did they get removed from the SBQ loot pool?
---
No diablo 2 wasn't online only, true, but the vast vast majority of people played on the b.net servers. Sure there were other servers, I'm guessing you mean open b.net? But rarely anyone played that due to hacks.
---
&gt;Thirdly, Diablo 2 has had limited patches, requiring less maintenance
---
They had numerous patches and updates, The game ended up with a ton of patches. They also added new content often with new runewords, and new end game bosses and new areas.
---
&gt;I would've gone with Guild Wars 1, a buy-it-once, online only game with no capability to host your own servers; MMO in the towns but makes use of instanced areas outside; often updated (without almost any server downtime I might add) Though even then it had DLC in the form of new campaigns, and even though the game was generous enough that you never needed any, microtransactions existed for character slots and the likes.
---
That doesn't even make sense, that doesn't sound like fo76 at all. D2 absolutely fit closer to it than guildwars. D2's overall map wasn't instanced, you could walk many maps away without once touching a loading zone. You couldn't host your own servers on d2, you had the option of closed or open b.net. Both of which were hosted by blizzard. The only difference was Open b.net allowed offline characters to be played on it. While closed was only characters you leveled on the server itself.
---
Do you have a robrotron that produces all products on the site.
---
I know but breaking the flow always sucks
---
What part of the world are you from ?
---
I am in  Scandinavia and see the same thing, but if i jump to a server with some US friends that i know things are usually a lot better.
---
If not you will have to go around and trigger everything by yourself :/
---
Like, go and trigger "free run" and high levels will pop up and help from no where :)
---
If you want censius violence and AWOL same thing, go to the area...
---
Thanks for the suggestion mate. 
---
I'm not really hard up for shells to be honest. Not that you can ever have enough ammo though, can you? :)
---
I unfortunately know how you feel. My first real SBQ fight saw me get pushed into those at least three damn times by enemies. Pissed me off to no end.
---
LOL, I almost had a heart attack just by reading this
---
I find the event works better when people keep the pylon folks alive and cyro the hell out of the boss. Also someone actively killing the eye bombers. Helpful perks for this fight would be fireproof and robotics expert to charm the Mr. Bastards snipers.
---
I’ve been absent for a while, so yesterday I fast travelled to Encrypted with absolutely no idea what I was getting into. I died about 600 times, immediately. So that was fun.
---
At your level it's basically just do whatever you want. Personally I legendary hunt, manufacture ammo and play with my build to try new weapons and different strategies. The raids are coming this summer.
---
That I can agree on. It took them 3 weeks to fix the mod issues if I’m not mistaken.  As of now, the only time they had a hotfix was once and it was because of server stability.  Other than that, any bugs will be addressed in their biweekly schedule for the most part.
---
That would be dope!
---
I never said they didn't have content updates, they didn't put out content on a regular basis. Runewords definitely weren't added with every update.
---
Same, I usually get a drink when loading into the game because I know it takes forever to pop in
---
I find it very effective during scrapping. Confirming scapping a favorite requires a different key or button before you can get to the box where you actually scrap it. I believe the cofirmation key is backspace, and my usual "scrap item" key, Spacebar aborts the scrap on the confirmation box.
---
It may be because CAMPS were entirely disappearing in the beginning. I stopper play for months until just recently because my camp could be found 3 times and it never spawned back. I remember camps being much closer then and sometimes even were my camp was and then my camp wouldn’t spawn and Id be screwed.
---
It's not that rare anymore. I've picked up three times over the past month. The shocks are never there though.
---
Damn! Your CAMP is fantastic, and the spot is awesome. My only worries would be the frequency of attacks, as well as it getting nuked a lot now that the Burrows has made Harper's a good target. You've certainly given me a spot to ponder, though...
---
You are right runewords weren't added every update, but new content was. Also aside from .09 patch every patch was only active for under 6 months. So they did patch regularly. The only reason .09 was around for over a year was due to them working on implementing "Warden" anticheat software for the servers.
---
I think so too
---
You evil genius imagine the chaos imagine how many rage quitters there would b lol
---
I agree that the bosses needed to be more rewarding but this ain't it chief
---
I may, or may not, have walked into fissures while looking up and firing at a SB. Definitely not 12 times.
---
Best of luck buddy, most of us are in the same boat.  But the game is playable even with just normal weapons just in comparison my main is 160 and I have almost 600 hours in and I'm still waiting for a great drop.  It's all RNG and the table is loaded with lots of junk.
---
I 100% blame the inclusion of legendary weapons  in the game for this whole phenomenon.
---
We would be so better off if they were not in the game at all.
---
"BrEaKiNg ThE fLoW aLwAyS sUcKs"
---
Right. So that's not an issue of the game not featuring enough content for players. People with 700 hours played over what? 140 something odd days? Is not the player base.
---
You and other players who have put in an avg of ~4 hours in every single day since launch are the extreme. You'd face the exact same problem in every game ever, including previous BGS games. 
---
Players with huge hours played numbers complaining about lack of content and drop rates (because all there is left is farming) is hardly on Bethesda. 
---
You essentially play 76 at the same rate people work full time jobs...... You actually played nearly 50 more hours than I worked since launch.....
---
The lack of content for people like you, who now have little to do but farm cannot be considered a failing of BGS. It's just not reasonable to expect them to provide enough content for you to make a full time job of playing the game.
---
I think you might be right. It's validated clientside, which in this case can be wrong
---
Pretty much this. Once I "finish" my build (getting all relevant perk cards), there isn't much point to keep playing. I've seen all the content. So I've been leveling alts. Looking forward to the legendary player prestige system to redo my characters.
---
Imho, if you put 700 hrs in another Fallout game (mods excluded) the result would be the same if not worst.. I think that in half that time you can see every quest&amp;location in the single player Fallouts AND you don't have regular free patches with new content (small or medium size alike).
---
Like I said, mods excluded, that's something else.
---
Everyone is dead in fallout 76. Literally every single person that left a holotape behind is dead. There's no sense of urgency, there's no motivation to do anything. Why even kill the SBQ? 
---
Yeah it is a video game but you can still empathize with characters in other games. A few examples: The last of us, heavy rain, specs ops the line, god of war and many many others, **the fucking Witcher 3 and the bloody baron questline**. 
---
Every game tells a story and the story and the ways that game tells the story is what differences bad games from good games. 
---
We are all humans and it's way easier to care about some stupid pixels if they have a face. 
---
Holotapes are soulless. There's nothing there. 
---
Do you think that these scenes from The Witcher 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjjKUdZFqiU would have the same emotional impact if you could only listen to them?
---
Except the game works against itself here. You can not craft Legendaries and now we have repair kits to further divorce the game from this circle.
---
It is really strange because I totally agree with you that the intended loop is what you posted yet the endgame is at odds with it.
---
On any character, I fear the Ka-Chunk of those AP rounds!!!
---
Always stuff your junk, and if the other players don't take the pylons go an take at least 2 by your self, 2 is ok and you can handle them, i usually go trough about 5-10 stimpack's holding 2 pylons :) 
---
I do have healing factor, but that usually dosent kick in fast enough, but helps a bit:)
---
You kind of have to find your own thing that you enjoy doing. I like to collect outfits and plans - and I also sell them! I also like to explore the map and find little hidden things - spend a lot of time on there with friends so we always end up getting into something.
---
Right now I'm doing a lot of the free range event for the new plans. Pretty excited for the content next week!
---
If the Vendorbot didn't have the spawn at Charleston Station, it'd be perfect. Damn you, Vendorbot, and your fantastic outfits! I've thought about Watoga, but I really don't want to repair/rebuild all the time. The spot across the way from Whitesprings Station is decent, but it's pretty drab compared to other stations. \*Great\* foot traffic, though. There's tradeoffs everywhere, I guess.
---
Or give us circular fence pieces that autosnap to this wierd cylinder.
---
I despise the cylinder!
---
foreal didnt realize armor and weapons even had more than 1 effect til i was lvl 100 -.- prolly dropped the best stuff ive ever gotten in my life and never knew it
---
Alec Knox, born inside the vault a few years after Vault 76 closed to a security guard. A mischievous, trouble maker of a child who held the title of designated hitter on his baseball team, his father encouraged Alec's competitive behavior, instilling in him the idea that he had to be the one on top in every situation. Passing his time with sports and a love of Gronak comics, he was anxious and excited when the vault finally opened, wanting to get out into the world.
---
Picking through the desolate wastes of Appalachia, he finds himself taken with ideals of the Raiders in the Savage Divide; the strongest survive. Setting up his own base, loving called Fort Knox, over the bones of an old raider camp, he now spends his days raiding through what's left of Appalachia, trusted axe by his side, more often than not drunk of whiskey, or high on fury. Or both, after a particularity good score.
---
Some players carry a lot of acid on them
---
Dog food from spaaaaace!
---
Yeah, the Mire/Bog would definitely be cool. I just *hate* having my place be attacked. I know you can't get away from that, but I had a lot of high-levels destroying my stuff at Whitesprings, and I got sick of it, haha.
---
Lefty here, totally support this
---
I've never understood this, as a multiplayer game most of my enjoyment doesn't really come from the quests but the interactions with others.
---
Whether good and wholehearted, or PvP you can lick the salt off of.
---
That and what you decide to do with your time in the wasteland, become  an ammo trader and spend your time mining, smelting and trading with other players. Go around and help others, perfect your build, sell legendaries, roleplay, etc
---
The list goes on but if none of that really seems interesting then maybe take a break until new content comes out. In the end it's an RPG based around the players being the other characters, some of the fun you have to make yourself.
---
Lol, that Supermutant sendt you some strange looks, hahaha.
---
Thanks for the post :)
---
Yeah I really enjoy this game and I like seeing it improve that's the only reason why I bring this up it just seems like they could take the time to focus on the stability overall
---
wow i just lost all respect for you in that one post...making jokes about disabled people? really?  enjoy roasting in hell bud
---
That time it would be due to latency. There are many times that I've gotten one or two hits on her and cleaned up the adds and still got loot
---
:( poor slothy boi
---
As much as I'd love to do the Forest (and it's certainly a possibility), having a free fast travel point closer to Vault 76 feels like a waste. I know caps are easy enough to come by, but my brain starts having an issue about it, haha.
---
Laser weapons are now made of enhanced cardboards, pulled out my laser to give it a test since they ‘buffed’ the durability, well in the past it would break after killing two supermutants, now i can kill 15 before heading to the repair.
---
Thanks for all the replies, everybody, and sorry for the delay!
---
It worked out pretty well. I have a suggestion about decorating though. Don’t put everything along the walls. This creates a huge unusable gap in the middle and makes whatever you build look unrealistic. Try to separate different areas like kitchen, bedroom etc.
---
There are still bugs but they constantly try to improve things.
---
neg.  been playing same character for months.
---
guess it is support ticket time since no one else seems to be having this issue.
---
The environmental story telling is indeed nice, but i don't agree with the second bit.
---
When everyone is dead there's no tragedy in death anymore.
---
What's sad about death is the people that are left behind, still alive. You care more about a persons struggle when you hear about it from someone who loved that person.
---
I like fallout 76 but there are no redeeming qualities in its storyline.
---
I cannot empathize with the plight and struggles of dead people because everyone is dead. They're all people i don't know or care about. If the game would let me meet and get to know some of those people the situation would change.
---
I actually ran into this with the new camera during the camera quest, out of space for the photos. I learned how to upload pictures I had (PS4) to Twitter to save them, now it's easy. I actually don't need anymore picture space I just upload the ones I want and delete the not so great pics, saves space on the PS4 too. The new camera is pretty cool and takes nice detailed pictures.
---
Nope. That's a legacy weapon now
---
There is a camo paint scheme for the hunting rifle but I don't know if it's still available.
---
Going into space means nothing when you have near unlimited energy. Fusion generators. And the ability to levitate. Whatever that means is. Eyebots.
---
Yes but you're acting like they had a patch planned today.
---
They don't go off your flow man
---
Another person can't put down most atom shop items but they can do any normal plans they have learned.
---
Oh thx I'll check the atom shop again
---
Thats the most impressive part
---
hahahha they gotcha now you backpedalin
---
Path of Exile, Torchlight 2, Borderlands 2, etc.
---
:D yay now I know I’m special
---
Only one way to find out..
---
The combat rifle definitely has a lower AP cost in the ESM: 25 vs 32 AP. I can't confirm whether those values are actually used, but that's a large enough difference that it shouldn't be difficult to test.
---
I've always thought that the scorchbeasts have rubber level of bouncing physics.
---
Love the hat OP.
---
It's a slightly longer equation to determine the boundary.  It's not like they have interns sitting around surveying the spots people camp at.
---
At least, I hope that's not the case...
---
Welcome back!
---
Same. I've been playing since beta with various friends. I love seeing those memories as loading screens and wont delete them. 
---
I wish the new in game camera had it's own album. Smaller pics at a lower resolution. Maybe a photo album you can only view at a user's camp. And stored separately. That would also be neat to see if u visit players camps.
---
Really... Well I paid 3k for mine like a day ago xD usually legacy weapons go for more if I am right
---
I hate how the mirv rounds fly 4 yards then literally shift to straight down. Makes them worthless if fully perked out. They end up killing you often.
---
Nah they were heavily duped. Atleast on ps4 haha
---
4 yards is 3.66 meters
---
Will there be a legendary kit down the road that can repair it to 200%?
---
The way a game tells a story is not what makes a game good or bad. 
---
It's the story that's told that makes it good or bad. 
---
I've walked up to an unmarked location where you have a skeleton sitting in a chair, drinking.... Clearly just taking a peaceful moment before the end and thought about what that experience must have been like. The fear, the inevitability, the attempt to have your existence end on a peaceful note despite the absolute terror of the circumstances of your death. Without one word being spoken or read. 
---
I find there's 2 camps of 76 players:
---
1) People who read books. 
---
2) People who don't read books or read primarily YA. 
---
I'll leave it to you to figure out which group doesn't need an NPC holding a giant sign that says "Let me read you a story"
---
Why does 76 not being the only game in existence make those experiences any less fun?
---
wrong i killed you just last night, i have video proof you crying to get your loot back
---
aww rip I’m on pc so maybe it’s a little better
---
I just picked up a two shot gauss rifle yesterday. Explosive energy weapons no longer drop.
---
Can you really call it a  "glitch"?
---
Oh nice so no explosive lasers or plasmas anymore?
---
If you view the pics and hide the HUD you can screenshot them through the xbox capture system. If you want them stored elsewhere after that, I use the xbox app on my phone, pull the capture up and download it to my mobile. Then you can upload anywhere
---
You can complete every single quest and side quest in under 20 hours without even hitting level 50. The issue is there isn't much to do in this game. There are very few quests and the quests there are are extremely quick and easy to complete and take no skill or anything.
---
Curious, how did you feel about Old World Blues?
---
See them all the time in watogga. 3 spawn locations. When I'm farming PA I go there check the 3 locations and server hop
---
I hear you. I'm in the center of the map now for cheaper travel. I just figured I would get more customers in the forest. I have some nice low level stuff and ammo the low levels might appreciate.
---
I had to start all the way back at abby'bunker
---
How’s that work? Friend request then you gain access to each other’s camp to build? Sorry, I have only rolled lone wolf. 
---
I have no wall decor, but a lot or power and furniture.
---
This whole system is stupid.
---
They can't lockpick a lock I built in my water purifier without becoming wanted, but they can try to steal my whole workshop and that's ok.
---
They can hunt me all around the world and kill me while I have no idea my workshop is under attack because there are times the quest to defend doesn't even pop up.
---
I can stay hidden until they capture my workshop, but aven after taking my workshop I'm still flagged for pvp and they can kill me anywhere in the map.
---
And the worst is that people will just say that's my fault for having a workshop. I'm trying to use the system to get plans and resources as intended while other people are using it to get a free kill, but somehow it's my fault I'm being killed the other side of the map, right? It's not like those people killing me are fighting for resources. I've had people kill me and server hop, I've had people coming to my camp and destroying everything after capturing my workshop.
---
When they announced the game they promised I could opt out of any pvp, but they forgot to mention that in order to do that I'd have to ignore important gameplay mechanics. I'm not against pvp. I play on survival sometimes and it's ok when random people kill me out of nowhere. But becoming a free kill (they don't even become wanted, c'mon) in adventure just because I tried to get resources or plans is dumb.
---
I'm just referring to the player getting banned from the game. That is all. Though if Bethesda does record audio they could theoretically report them to the police. I mean, they mentioned real life threats specifically in the report system so who knows.
---
You can complete every single quest in this game in under 20 hours and not even getting to level 50. MaTN did it on his first play through while taking his time to record everything including the lore. The fact that all the lore and content can be completed that quickly is insane. 
---
There is absolutely no way you are going to complete all the quests in fo3, NV, or 4 in 20 hours, even speed running it.
---
Hopefully ! Haha
---
Hahaha or you'll just talk trash on the Reddit
---
Why is it even a circle? It's not like you can really build on the edges
---
If you are on the same team you can add stuff to your teammate's camp.  I've found a few welcome surprises that way in mine. :)
---
Best I got since I dont play on PS4. He's talking mad shit too so 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
That's what they said, lemonade.
---
Let me give you some hope
---
Every time I loose it all and think I’m screwed, it always turns out better afterwards.  I’ve lost an tse combat to only find a tse handmade the very next day. 
---
I once lost 100s of every type of materials from a pvp battle and on the very next pvp I got, I was able to collect 100,000 of nearly every junk. I also found 4k of every stable flux from this guy. He was level 265 and a duper. 
---
Here are two examples of when I thought all was lost and I hated how my grind went to waste. But it always turned around for the best. 
---
In everything in life we have our ups and downs.  Sometimes people die we love or maybe your house burns down or gets robbed.  Yet we keep keeping on.
---
Loved it. They may be all robots but each of them has a unique personality. They tell you their stories, you get into their rooms and  find a fuckton of mentats, and we all know the plot twist with the villain. Oh and having conversations with your own brain...
---
That dlc really knows how to tell a story. 
---
Fallout 76 is a follow the trail of holotapes. There's no plottwist, there's nobody to slowly get to know and care about is as i said before, soulless
---
Pc
---
You know he recently started making videos again
---
Refusing to follow the story in a game is like forcing yourself to read a book if you hate reading
---
I had the same thing happen on the misstress of mistery quest. Only list half that data though. I gliched in the cave fighting the windigo and had to return to the mansion again to pick up quest line
---
None of them have the stories or mechanics as deep as WoW, and there  you're still relegated to grinding the same events over and over to get better gear so you can grind more easily until you can get a harder event to grind for better gear...etc.
---
It's intrinsic in the game style.  Granted, FO4 had a lot more depth and a bit less grind, but you still got to that point where all you were doing was farming if you wanted to continue to play.
---
It's not about my flow man I'm not dying for content but they could at least keep fixing the minor issues so we stop getting disconnected easily and loot doesn't go missing  instead they just added more stuff so we can give em more money which is fine and all but at least take this time to fix some little things to help further improve the game
---
I've not played PoE but let me guess how that story goes - Some big bad guy/ancient evil/ random guy tried to use ancient evil fucks everything up for everyone. You were exiled (names a dead giveaway) for something you did/type of person you were and now you have to suffer through 39474 Fantasy tropes to undo/fix/deafeat the problem causer.
---
Torchlight 2 I only played very briefly.  The one guy who was playable in the first one gets possessed or whatever and turns on the town/people. WHHHHHHAT A FORMER ALLY TURNED BAD! I've literally never seen that.... It's about as original as the big bad guy not being actually dead and the end of the first one in every sequel ever made. 
---
And Borderlands? I've played borderlands pretty heavily. That's a mediocre story carried exclusively by interesting setting and characters.
---
What? You obviously have never played PoE if you believe that. You don't have to grind the same places over in PoE because you create the places you grind with maps, that you put mods on that you want to fight. Ever single map is unique.
---
For some reason that challenges keeps falling but to 760 each time I complete it, I’ve never had it go up to 7600
---
haha
---
Whitespring turret camp?
---
Agreed. That was the deciding factor in my current character being at Morgantown Station. I can drop off stuff in the ol' green suitcase, and they can use all of my crafting stations/instruments/spare bedroom/radiation shower/water purifiers.
---
I have played for 330 hours and found exatly 1 tse gun in the entire time...
---
That was over a hundred hours ago
---
I feel that whatever eyebots use it not very powerful (I mean they die in 1 hit or if a brisk breeze touches them, well except EDE  how I miss you).
---
Everyone's talking pretty hard in here, I'm on your side man.
---
PSN: PrimordialPear
---
For anyone who wants try their luck, you can bring your team too, more caps for us
---
There are no details and there’s still weeks till its release
---
It would be cool if they had like a Polaroid type camera option so you could just give the pictures to friends or place them in your camp and things like that - so it really would be a bit more special because it doesn't go to the gallery.
---
The game is worth MSRP
---
Sounds like you have been raided before
---
It was fun though, right? Maybe not....hehehehe We did get a couple of nice photos.
---
I think I burned 30+ stimpacks on you.
---
Plenty of people with libraries of legendaries duped to get them, or took advantage of when there were bajillions of tses for low prices everywhere. Duping made it look like we all just crap out good legendaries when they are super rare
---
A way around this might be larger plots of land (like workshop areas) that multiple can build on.  They just need to section it off inside so 4-6 people can build.  Not sure how they could get that to instance each time you leave a server though.
---
How do pets work? Is there still a bug where it takes up build space?
---
&gt; I've not played PoE but let me guess how that story goes - Some big bad guy/ancient evil/ random guy tried to use ancient evil fucks everything up for everyone. You were exiled (names a dead giveaway) for something you did/type of person you were and now you have to suffer through 39474 Fantasy tropes to undo/fix/deafeat the problem causer.
---
Not even close, especially with the update. The only thing even close at all is you were exiled to a new area at the beginning. But other than that, nope you are wrong. 
---
ROFL, you realize you could say the exact same things for FO76 right? 
---
Oh, look after the end of the world there is a plauge turning people into enemies. Nope never saw that before in the Last of Us, L4D, or any zombie game. You can literally say the exact same for this game that it literally follows every single trope as well.
---
Deathclaws ARE dangerous. A single one is not so much if prepared. The real issue is all deathclaws are static spawns and we know where they are. 
---
Now imaging zoning into Whitesprings or the Barrows and instead of ghouls evey spawn was a deathclaw. Now you are crapping your pants if you get 3+ on you.
---
Even the trio of bears is really dangerous with the repeated staggers. Its just a numbers thing.
---
Pretty sure the lever action can be used starting at 15.
---
Rare-ish drop though, I've probably gotten 5 or so in like 250 levels.
---
Can get the plans easily enough though. Pretty sure grafton train station has them, definitely whitesprings.
---
could you try contacting bethesda? if they dont fix things like this thats fucked
---
I bought mine brand new for $18 on eBay.
---
Only Beth knows.
---
Maybe we will know next week.
---
Well it hasn’t helped. Server stability has declined since patch 7.
---
Those issues have happened since launce lmao if they could just "fix it" it'd already be done
---
I lost a 3* aa crit limb lever action and a mutants explosive shotgun. I feel your pain.
---
You’re seeing a lot of posts from 100+ players. At that point most of the game becomes chasing rare items/plans and legendaries. You’re slightly behind where I was when I ran through after launch; I think I followed Beth’s intents and hit the nuke launch point right at 50. But I didn’t have many legendaries then either.
---
I’m a past patch it mentioned something about cryogenic and incendiary armour effects being fixed or something like that. So my guess is you’ll be able to add effects to items. I also heard rumours of legendary PA but i think that’s just rumour.
---
Yeah it was a good time amigo - oh did I tell you pittbull gave me that TSE Combat Rifle after he got that quad damage explosive shotgun? Rips the stuffing out of most enemies lol :) See you in-game later buddy if ya online :)
---
Come to the Zeta Invaders tournament I am throwing on PC tommorow!
---
Seriously there are a ton of things to do they just are not obvious.
---
I bet you haven't beat Grognak and the Ruby Ruins! That took me an entire evening to beat and I didn't even take down the world bosses.
---
Bethesda will just copy paste "we can't replace lost items but will forward this to the dev team for research" reply
---
Low hanging fruit. Glad you are happy though.
---
No the event is called free-range and it is a random event that can spawn around the mire and savage divide.
---
Think you're getting too hung up on D2. I still stand by the fact exceptions do not make the rule. Most client/company owned server games had at least a subscription fee.
---
I am expecting little change to the economy. High end effects will likely require high amounts of tokens, think serum recipes or power armor mod plans. One or two new legendary items will not affect the market as demand will continue to far outstrip supply and the artificial cap ceiling will still make most high end gear unobtainium.
---
Unfortunately you cannot place atom shop items in another person's camp.
---
The downvotes this post has combined with the comments agreeing with you seems like someones trying to cover this shit up
---
It's not griefing to take workshops, being a dick? Maybe, but we're raiders, kinda the point
---
&gt;It's the story that's told that makes it good or bad. 
---
Nah. Voice acting, animations, expressions, they're all part of the story. Regardless of that, fallout 76 has a bad story and a bad way of sharing that story. 
---
&gt;I've walked up to an unmarked location [...]
---
That's the story you made for yourself. You don't know anything about that person. Maybe he was a mass murderer drinking some booze before dying. Maybe someone killed him. Maybe he was poisoned. Maybe he launched a nuke on some poor souls and he was watching them die. Just because you find a skeleton somewhere it doesn't mean that you know exactly what's the story behind that.
---
Btw, go shove something up your rear. I do like reading books and if you're comparing Fo76 to a book you're delusional. 
---
In any book you'll get to learn stuff about their journey and you're with them, watching from above. You get to learn about their thoughts their struggles and all of that. Also i don't know if you noticed but a huge part in any book is describing the environment, describing emotions, creating relations. There's not much dialogue/monologue. 
---
And dear lord you're such an elitist, you feel the need to brag about reading books. I'm not wasting my time with you anymore.
---
Nope.  Legendary farming shouldn't even be a worry until you are 50+.  You'll find some along the way, but you'll outgrow most of them due to leveling.  Once you hit 50, the game changes a bit.  You may do at least one or two farming runs per server hop at that point.  
---
I'll do a couple runs a day, and I'm not swimming in legendaries at lvls 77 and 87 (I sell or give away anything I won't use), but I do have a couple I like on each toon that serve me well.
---
I feel like you’re not getting it so I’ll clarify for you: no single item is $56 and will never be. OP is referring to the cost of all 4 Power Armor paints, only half of which have been released.
---
Sadly it does nothing for dropping. Favorites fall to the ground the same as everything else.
---
It is totally crazy to me that people don't get this
---
My point being is I could list numerous others other than d2, such as diablo 3, which is also free with no subscriptions. Or PoE which is free with no subscription( actually is completely free to play don't have to even buy the game). Both guild wars games, borderlands games, Torchlight 2, etc.
---
that's because quests are not the core of the game, being not a classic fallout, but the "experience" is. I'm level 41, being playing casual, and I just did Rose's second quest, because I love to go around, explore, hoard, build new weapons, doing events, etc etc... Is a different type of game and not everyone likes it, I'm very aware of that, but my point was that saying that after 700hrs of game you have nothing left to do well, is not a great argument imho... that's all
---
I have a 1\* executioners combat rifle.
---
It is my goto for midrange. 
---
I also use it to engage SB's.  Taken down 8 or so with it so far.  I generally hip fire, so I know I have some misses, but to take out an L50 SB and its entourage, takes me about 200 rounds.
---
Has also served to take down the cargobot carrying keycards, and a couple vertibirds.
---
I've looted several handmades, mostly either anti-scorched or anti-super mutant; those dobase damage in the low 40's, with a +30% against stated enemies.
---
  The Executioners has slightly higher base damage than the handmade, then when the bonus damage kicks in, does 60% more damage than the handmade....
---
(OTOH, close in, my goto melee does 2x the base damage of the Executioner, and feels faster)
---
 I am not a rifle oriented build, but I do have a couple of auto/semi auto perks active - 
---
\+10% damage and -30% (I think) armor, and to date, I have neve engaged VATS.
---
The fact of the matter is that this game is a looter shooter once you get past the minimal content that's there
---
Did you miss the point where you can go through all the terminals and holotapes in the same time frame as well? So literally cover every bit of lore in the game.
---
They're everywhere, and **irritating** as all hell.
---
Beep.
---
Be**BLAM**...
---
I’ve justified atom purchases a similar way. I purchased the game for $30 back in December so I feel comfortable buying $30 worth of atoms to make up the difference in how the game should’ve cost.
---
It depends how you play. When I play I only tend to engage in PvP or farm legendaries so I always have a surplus of 1-3 star items. If you tend to follow the story or only compelte events around the map you won't have as many.
---
if you want to you can spawn it yourself, go to b&amp;b barbecue , if you dont see some cows and a dead body with a heardnig hook on it, server hop and it usually starts :)
---
Nope I got one of the last TSE Gauss on Xbox, or at least from what I’ve found.
---
Break into someones house, and steal it.
---
Also, don't get caught.
---
I would LOVE curtains for the windows and being able to draw/close them.
---
It is weird, every time i have tried to make this post i have a lot of people agreeing with my but some how it gets down voted a lot.
---
Together we cryyy...
---
Those antlers are a mod right? And not an actual in game item lol
---
I had two.  Sold one on Monday for 4k.
---
The more you play the more your free atoms are restricted as you complete the challenges, at close to 275 hours I only have a handful of challenges left that are worth the effort (ie; killing 1000 robots with a Black Powder weapon is not worth 40 atoms.)
---
\+karma

Before I forget
---
You can message me through xbox if you want xtoughnerdx
---
Shocks are hardest to get, for sure!
---
Same with me, my camp is above blackwater mine, if I’m in camp I periodically get Uranium Fever rewards.
---
wonderful
---
I am also interested mainly because i need a mule account.
---
Possible.
---
That’s a more likely setup but IMHO a less likely error.
---
I.e. submitting the wrong object for scrapping vs not recognising an object as unscrapable
---
You can also start it by fast traveling to the southern belle motel in the mire and walking down the street a little ways should trigger it\~
---
What spot is this?  Not gonna steal the plot, but could use some acid right now.    I’m desperately out of everything but .308 and no acid for ore
---
For me the true legendary hunt didn't start till after 45/50. Partially due to wanting the highest level gear, partially because your basically about to dead end on building the character &amp; there are only a few routes to further increase damage. Legendary effects being one.
---
On my alt I kept myself from getting too attached to anything under the 45/50 level, and I still am constantly hunting for improved variations of my gear. My main I think I foolishly used a level 15 TS Pipe Rifle until about 40. Reckon I made my own play a bit more difficult with that move.
---
I seem to find way more legendary items when I'm not looking for them. Got a max level 3* unyielding piece last night from a spot I've never once found a legendary. RNGsus is fickle.
---
Will so,thanks
---
That would be great.
---
If you could scrap a legendary.. Keep its legendary in the form of a mod box.. Like you get other common mods and apply it to crafted weapons or armor
---
I didn't have any that weren't quest drops at your level. I didn't get really good things until I was like 70ish
---
Im gonna ask a reddit full of people who play and enjoy fallout 76 how I can get the game super cheap because I don't think its worth what most of us probably paid for it?
---
It won’t let me :/ I’ll add you!
---
yep - lost a whole set of power armor to a server crash 
---
and they were like "womp womp"
---
You just gave me secondhand PTSD
---
Just need to be on a team. You can place any non-Atom item you know in their camp.
---
Can make some interesting practical jokes, like filling their garden with flamingos, or blocking every doorway/window with as many toilets as their budget can hold.
---
Couldn't give two shits if you like me or not, it's true whether you like it or not.
---
&gt; blocked!
---
Good for you, fucking snowflake.
---
The lvl 46 assulttron dominator is nightmare juice even for my lvl 124 character
---
I contacted support about it months ago because I'm also on a shared console and it was full of my sister's photos. They told me to just delete her photos because sometimes consoles have limited storage...A+ support response would invite family arguments again.
---
I completely understand. I got the game for ~$15 from one of those dodgy game keys websites. It had such a bad reputation, i wasn't willing to spend more than that.
---
Now after playing for a while i feel comfortably spending a few more bucks.
---
You can they are a thing.  There are several of us around on all platforms who have the ability to craft them. You're probably more likely to get the plan doing distant thunder event than digging up maps tbh. At least for the t60 stuff.
---
They have stated that they cant/wont return items lost because of glitches etc etc.
---
But hey, buy more atoms.
---
That is only the case if they haven't maxed out the 1400 caps a day limit. If they have already reached that, then the only way to make caps quick is killing people for the caps drops.
---
A bar near the Whitesprings station, I don't use turrets as they eat too much budget.
---
If you like that stuff why play a game that supports it so poorly instead of one that supports it well. Like you know that other games have player built stuff and ALSO have things like persistant servers and like, in game chat.
---
 Been doing that for like 2 days lol
---
There's no tragedy in death because everyone's dead? 
---
That very scenario, the events that lead up to it and how it happened are tragic in it self. The entire wasteland is a tragedy. Every house, every business, every park.
---
The technological advancement of the setting, how far humanity had come, only to still destroy itself over petty bickering is tragic.  
---
I don't need a character telling me in first person about their personal tragedy. I don't need a NPC holding my hand through exposition. Not to say that those characters cannot be an absolutely amazing way to deliver a story.... But it's not the only way.
---
Go read some letters from WW1 soldiers..... You don't know them, they are all dead. Tell me when you read their stories and consider what was happening at the time that you don't empathize. 
---
Go look at some of the most famous photography ever and tell me you can't see a story of suffering or joy. 
---
When people say "I need NPCs or how can I care about the people of the wasteland"
---
I assume they don't read (No offence meant, most people don't. They're used to movies and TVs and direct character driven story telling). And likely don't appreciate art/photography beyond "Oh that's pretty"
---
My Camp is in the Cranberry Bog, near a fissure, I tell everyone that I built there for the plentiful Resources, and when they ask which nodes are there I tell them I'm surrounded by legendary nodes.
---
I get a bit of everything at my Camp, and have had as many as 5 SBs at once, several nearby Spawn locations frequently spawn legendary Enemies including, Mirelurks of all varieties, A Hermit Crab, Gulpers, Fog Crawlers, Anglers, Super Muties, Ghouls, and occasionally a DeathClaw, not to mention the hordes of Scorched, MoleRats, Crickets, and Bloodbugs.
---
I have to make repairs every time I return to Camp, but the attackers provide plenty of materials for that, not to mention all the XP and Legendary gear I get.
---
I have a rebuild Idea that should help reduce some of the damage by the Rats &amp; Crickets, but wouldn't even consider moving, and the best part is I have not once encountered the "Your CAMP could not be placed on this world" message in the past 2 months.
---
When I tell friends to come to my camp, the first thing they say is "What's there?" &amp; "I'm not coming if there are a bunch of SBs".
---
I agree with both sides to be honest, on the 1 side, if I kill a 3 star legendary I should get a 3 star weapon, on the other side, I dont think legendary weapons should really even be in the game bar a few named weapons.  
---
Yes, they are fun and all, however, they become the point to the game and it takes away from anything else, if you dont have such and such a legendary then you wont be able to do such and such.  
---
They completely dwarth the power of regular weapons to the point that regular weapons are completely worthless after a time.  
---
I am at the point now where *all* of my weapons and armor is legendary, because its not worth it to have non legendary stuff.  
---
Why would I ever craft any weapon now? all these weapons plans ive learnt are now utterly useless because theres just so many legendary weapons and almost all of them will trump any non legendary weapon of the same type.  
---
I would like a game mode that doesnt include legendaries at all other than the named ones (perfect storm) for example.  
---
Put the emphasis back onto trying to get materials to craft new weapons, better weapons, ammo ect...  
---
Bring back the cool feeling of collecting all the named weapons in the game.
---
That loading bag bug got me good last night. I dropped about 90 stims, all my steel and about 2 hours worth of loot when a glowing Yao lagged 3 hits on me at once. I actually retrieved the loot after 5min of staring. I dropped some to hit max capacity and travelled to camp. Upon arrival, I noticed the "retrieve your loot quest". Everything I picked up was still halfway across Appalachia. I ran back for another 5min only to discover my bag was still loading. It did not finish loading this time.
---
Where are my Atoms?
---
I totally agree, was playing in pacifist mode and I’m 130 level, a level 60 came by and totally destroyed my camp and I could do nothing.  Was so pissed!!
---
If you need fusion cores go farm whitespring sentry bots. Each one drops a fusion core.
---
yeah, they actually did that on Bethesda / twitch live right now :)
---
It's always been like that for me. I usually get one after about three fast travels, two or so when I'm taking walks. The game just gives you the code pieces. I've had situations where I've killed one, no code piece dropped, and crashed roughly an hour later only to have a dead officer at my feet when I load back in with a code piece for me .
---
I rename all my important crap to XXX whatever.  Started doing this in fo4 so i could scrap starting from the top down.
---
The Post Nuclear Party service includes plans? 
---
I'm new hahaha
---
Message me your xbox name
---
I can't play a single session without running into one. Savage Divide, Ash Heap, Toxic Valley, . . . I fully expect to find one sauntering through Flatwoods one of these days. The stupid part is that I kind of feel bad for them, and their lonely existence. Yes, as I said, I'm stupid.
---
What I think it is, is due the increase in caps. If they have maxed out the 1400 cap limit that day, and they want to farm caps, the quickest way to farm caps if you can't sell things is to kill people in pvp.
---
&gt; What I think it is, is due the increase in caps. If they have maxed out the 1400 cap limit that day, and they want to farm caps, the quickest way to farm caps if you can't sell things is to kill people in pvp.
---
A large problem right now is that a majority of endgame players are in PA all the damn time because of carry weight issues caused by hoarding legendaries for the legendary vendor lol. Personally, I would otherwise be out of PA most of the time and random world spawn cores would probably be enough for me w/Power User
---
Not insulting at all, is it?!?
---
You are only figuring this out now? Bethesda's exec's have been fucking up F76 since the very beginning.
---
They really can't get rid of PVP in adveture due to the workshops. Since only one person can have the workshop at a time. PVP will always be a thing because of them.
---
I know this is super late but running through silos can be good.
---
You'll find spawns near a queen, so your best bet might be to try Swarm of Suitors and let them spawn a queen.
---
I've noticed Sundays are ripe with the little bastards. Frequently kill one to silence the beep to only find another shortly after.
---
Also had one drop two in its inventory this past Sunday. Game bugged out ended up putting tons in mine.
---
All here is correct stuff and the OP knows his shit, but I have to comment upon one thing. Are TSEs the best weapons? Not by far. Is sentinel/assassin meta? I seen total 5 people who knew how to use it effectively, and I killed dozens of people wielding it. The meta evolved and the stuff that was the best in the world of slap damage when duping was rampant is not the best anymore. I.e. bloodied firerate was being sold to vendors then, now its a godroll.
---
I think it’s either a cylinder or a sphere where you plant the device as the center. I have a large setup NW of Harpers Ferry off a junk pile and water pool under some power lines that makes use of the vertical above/below the cliff spot I chose
---
Unyielding or bloodied power armour that would be interesting
---
Yes and I would suggest starting with areas where Queens spawn, like the mire or bog and work down.
---
Does superduper help when you are picking that stuff up? I thought it was just when you are crafting things.
---
Hahaha. 
---
In one sentence you mention describing an environment.... But you dismiss my story about walking up to an unmarked location where I'm literally experiencing the environment. The way that person lived (in a trailer), the way he died, what he was doing at the time. 
---
I don't need some dialogue holding my hand to say "John was 34. He was a miner. He died drinking a beer while watching the bombs go off"
---
I don't need every single detail about that person to put myself into his shoes at the time and place of his death, to think about how they felt, what it must have been like.
---
By taking a workshop you are signing up for PVP, it literally says that when you take the workshop. As for why they chase you around the map to kill you is because you drop caps when killed and beth increased the number you drop relatively recently. So now if you have already got the full 1400 limit for that day from the NPC's then the best way to farm caps is to kill people who have the workshops.
---
It’s happened to me as well. I was able to lure them away, and after using most of my nuka colas and stimpaks, was able to get the all dead. My camp was near the lucky hole mine.
---
Missed hitting that zero lol
---
Power armor is just weak as fuck because no op legendary effects
---
SheepS should drop a new card 1/4 of the time so you have a chance.to go again later.
---
Have you tried hopewell cave?
---
 I know one spawns there I've no idea if it is alpha or not
---
I rename all weapons/armor I dont want to drop/sell as "z______". E.g., "zSniper Gauss". This results in fewer pants-sharting inventory management moments imho. ;)
---
Because when you take a workshop you are signing up for the PVP aspect of it, that includes what happened to you. As for why they do it, a lot of people do it after maxing out the 1400 caps you can get a day. Now that beth has increased caps per kill it makes sense to "farm" workshop players.
---
Great job, brilliant ideas
---
I'm not 100% but I see a lot of "don't use PA in PVP"
---
Also the Power plant North of watoga has a deathclaw pretty regularly.
---
A beach is made up of individual grains of sand. With near unlimited energy you can out 1000 eyebota together to get a modest load up, as many times as you want too.
---
I personally always rename things I want to keep. I always make it "[KEEP] Item name" that way it ends up towards the bottom of everything in the list. Or just a single bracket in front of the entire name does the same thing.
---
I actually considered moving to that area, but way too much traffic. I'm went way down south where I'm left alone.
---
Nice! Glad you are now the owner. It served me pretty well. 
---
Just don't blow yourself up too much :)
---
Hopewell cave varies, the first time I tried it was a glowing deathclaw but after I server hopped there was an alpha.
---
Yeah. The only difference?
---
In video games? Fallout largely popularized those post apocalyptic tropes. They may not have invented them, but they sure popularized them.
---
I have played the Witcher 3, but you're comparing apples to bananas here.  They are not trying to do the same thing.
---
Think of the Fyke Isle tower and how the story was told through that entire quest line.  That was the closest to how Fallout 76 does it and I had no trouble empathizing with the characters in that quest.
---
I'm not saying one or the other method of telling story is better or worse, as that would be opinion.  I am saying, though, that it seems to me you made your decision to not like the Fallout 76 storytelling before actually playing through it which made it impossible for you to enjoy it for what it is, and instead compare it to what its not.
---
There is something to be said for environmental story telling and fallout 76 is one of the best at doing it.  It's different, it's not bad.
---
it works like this:
---
Mob spawns
---
Mob gets bosstag
---
Mob gets Legendary stars + green flair
---
What happens is that stage 3 bugs out due to serverlag and ends up being delayed, if you tag the monster before the flair + stars appears, it counts as you tagging a regular boss mob and not an actual legendary one. So you recieve regular loot instead of loot of a legendary monster.
---
i hope that helps :)
---
Given the special repair kits save you from gathering all the materials usually required to repair sed item, it can potentially save you a lot of time. Considering that a huge mechanic of the game requires you to scavenge for loot I would have to say the special repair kits would live in the P2W category. 
---
People are in their right to complain because this could be a slippery slope.
---
On that same point though, you can complete a hell of a lot more games in a lot less than 20 hours.  
---
Worst case example I can think of that I have played was Medal Of Honor (2010) where there was what? 5 missions that took about 3 hours to complete.  
---
So right off the bat FO76 (which does have less of a questline than previous fallouts) already has over 6x as much play time as MoH, which more content being added.  
---
Much of the complaints could be alleviated if there was a few minigames added into FO76 too (chess, darts, bowling, tennis, card games, pool ect...)
---
I’ve been nuked once but it has totally stopped, there are a few enemies that spawn underneath the bridge but I don’t even bother having turrets :) thanks for the kind words. I’ll link u a few other camp spots I use, sorry the video is a bit long :)
---
I really like the mix of styles in this game. The exploration is fun. The story is interesting for the most part. I like chasing loot and farming.  The strong point of the game in my opinion is that it appeals to lots of different players.  I think Bethesda needs to continue to improve all aspects of the game including story, looting, and building mechanics.  I love how I can play the game solo or join up with friends. I like farming some days, other times I like building on my camp.  
---
I've said it before but I think FO76's best parts are when the players come together.  SBQ, ISS, Fasnacht, etc. These are the best moments in the game to me!  Adding in factions and giving people something to belong to would be great.
---
The very best thing they could do is re-introduce human npc's. Early on in the game after I realized everyone died took away from the story for me.  The human drama in any story is what people find compelling.  They need to continue the FO76 story starting with the death of the SBQ. Add settlers, traders, raiders, BOS, Enclave, vault dwellers and give players a reason to log in.

I like the repair kits. Not super pumped about them being in the atom store but not a big issue. I currently have found 10 improved repair kits and it's awesome of you're mid fight with sbq and your gun breaks.

Since they are so easy to get and horde I don't even see a problem with them being in the atom store.
---
No but if u use PA with 2 excavator arms it should give u more lead but I do that and never see results
---
I did Hopewell Cave for this. Go to the back of the cave and a Deathclaw should spawn. You may need to server hop to get an alpha.
---
I forgot how every single good book or story ever requires long super intense character development and plot twists.
---
Something so vicious, so feral, might hold feelings. Sit down with one, talk about your differences
---
It helps dispose of stimpaks weighing you down!  Junk too, if you're dumb enough to take it to the event.
---
I've done it a few times, but never with *my* card until last night.  I had about 90 stimpaks on me.  
---
About ten other players fast traveled to help when the event started, for which I was grateful.  I activated two pylons, then got on top of that shed to stay out of reach of many of the bots and the Sheepsquatch.  I hit everything I could with my rifles while spamming stimpaks as needed.  Someone else would keep the third pylon activated most of the time, so we all wore that rapacious bitch down and finished the event with time to spare.  It was a good day.
---
I’m really surprised to see you on your most hated website Battle Station and we will just have to agree to disagree about your “content” and what actually happened. 
---
Just in case things had changed I had a look at some of your previous streams and things have evolved, although not for the better. You regularly ask for constructive criticism and feedback so here is mine:
---
If you find a good item (in your opinion) for sale at a vendor, don’t berate the person who sold it. They could be a newbie unaware of its worth or a player with no space left and a stash full of superior weapons. It may even be an accidental sale and for you not to understand this is very strange. You should be happy at your good fortune instead of having a meltdown. Certainly let viewers know but ease off on scolding your audience who are obviously new players. If you claim to have never previously sold an item that you would now keep then I don’t believe you. Your lack of understanding and appreciation of how others wish to play the game is greatly lacking and everyone who doesn’t play the way you do is not a “dumbass” or “monkey”. By the way, people taking pictures at an event for a weekly challenge are not “morons”.
---
You have made plenty of mistakes yourself, even recently. Just to let you know, sentinel armor does not work when crouched and third party mods are not banned, only unsupported.
---
As you raised the point about bos purchasing everything, can I suggest that now you accept items from viewers and buy a huge amount of items from vendors and openly trade that people who live in glass houses etc. I also see that Berserker and Instigating weapons are suddenly great now that they are up for sale in your store. Trading items was yet another thing you previously called people out on all the time.
---
When you get killed by a player who is actually good at pvp, don’t automatically assume it’s an exploit. When you were repeatedly killing a low level guy who accidentally grazed you at white springs I’m sure it seemed as though you were exploiting to him. Also, why is it ok for you to accidentally attack others, but unacceptable when others do it to you? Events and servers do not belong to you. Just get on with your own game and stop trying to explain to everyone how much of a badass you are.
---
My critique is of your public “content” so please don’t tell me where and what I can post. I realise you might hate sites like this because you have no control over the comments but you will just have to live with that. Just saying and I’m not even joking!
---
Yeah I can see how non-PA would be better if you have legendary effects on your armor. But regardless of if I am in my PA or not I get one-shot killed. When I do get a few shots off I never can kill the other player.
---
That dead officer was bethesda's way to make it up to you with the game crashing and you losing your code piece
---
I don’t think you play this game at all because special repair kits aren’t for sale in the shop lol. And also, the materials you have to gather for these items to repair them are materials you should have anyways for your C.A.M.P., like screws, adhesive, etc. so you’ll need them for pretty much anything else as well.
---
Maybe its, like, the calm before the purge of all of the pieces I guess
---
Fallout 76s story failed to get me engaged. It didn't intrigued me at all. It was all follow the overseer's journey. But why do i want to follow the overseer? She said she had a solo quest to do. She didn't want to wait for any of us. When shit hit the fan she still didn't want to wait for reinforcements. 
---
Meanwhile i'm stuck following her because of?
---
Did you manage to solve this? I'm having the exact same issue and no reply from Bethesda Support so far...
---
There's a third one? I know there's posiden @ charlseton and thunder mountain @ mire
---
Yes! I want this. Considering of my nice nature i RP in this game, this would be perfect.
---
And if Bethesda is smart they could do this to offset the whole repair kit fiasco.
---
It's a bug that has been reported numerous times since launch. The "funny" thing is that it can happen when you attack other players too.
---
They didn't popularize post apocolypitc zombies(scorched), especially when it is due to a modified strain of something that accidentally got released. That is literally Resident Evil. Which has been done long before fallout.
---
This game doesn't have any unique or interesting storylines that haven't been done over and over again.  So no, sorry you are wrong fallout didn't popularize post apocolyptic zombie games, they are literally just riding the coattails of numerous other games that have been around for a long time.
---
Hell, fo76 specifically is just pretty much a reskinned dayZ with legendary weapons.
---
Just looks cool at this point haha I get balancing, but then certain things go unused
---
works for all time ones tho like crafting grenades ect.
---
Honestly I hardly see what difference it makes unless for some reason you are determined to build a structure right up against the edge of your build space
---
Like forming a community like Diamond City from Fallout 4.
---
I got a couple of 1* two shot weapons. They weren't bad either.
---
I’d be careful. Moving that fast could potentially get your account flagged
---
If you are on XB1 we should join up. Gt:shadyrebob
---
So regardless of how we feel about repair kits every one you use is less junk consumption in the world, and less exploration and junk collection that needs to happen in order to collect it 
---
That is the only point I was trying to make here.
---
Even if you don't buy them from the store they are still reducing or eleminating the need for junk in the store.
---
I’ve had the bug since survival came out hence I stopped using melee
---
They normally are crap, but at least it's sometimes 2-3\* crap. I save all those for the legendary vendor.
---
Last time I played PoE, I don't think any of that was there (or I didn't get far enough in...it's been a while).
---
I'm not sure that invalidates my point though.  Even if you feel that having a unique map makes grinding less...grindy, it's still grinding.  And if you posit that, which I'm fine with, it's s single example of a different mechanic in a single came that doesn't define the genre(s).  And while grinding new locations is better than grinding SBQ, without a doubt, it still doesn't do more than make the grinding more interesting.
---
Serious question - once you've done a few (dozen? hundred?) unique maps, does the story progress?  Or is that the end game?
---
That wasn't always the case! I made myself mad a few times..
---
ROFL, are you seriously trying to compare a fallout game to a FPS that didn't have a story line? Is that really how far this game has fallen to where it is becoming compared to CoD and shit? 
---
How about we compare it to numerous other looter games instead, which is what this game is closer to. It has nowhere near the amount of story as PoE, Diablo 2, Torchlight 1 or 2, Borderlands 1 or 2, hell Diablo 3 even has much more story.
---
The fact you need to use a game from a genre that is KNOWN for having no story just to make fo76 look better is pretty sad TBH.
---
As your arch nemesis sits quietly at his base, tapping his fingertips together and chuckling softly to himself.
---
Thanks for the lol at work!!!
---
There are over 800 possible solutions. A new letter will be revealed on Wednesday to narrow down the number of solutions. Unless you have 800 launch keys to test each of the possible solutions.
---
I’ve had no issues in months. I had a little harassment a few times, but it was pretty sparse. 
---
I did have to learn how far up the cliffs I had to move to keep from getting nuked, though. 3rd move was the ticket. 
---
It’s a great area because it’s fairly central, so fast travel is basically never more than 20caps from my base.
---
There hasn't been a new hairstyle in months, there was only one set of tuxedos released one day, there haven't been emotes in weeks until the free one, but there's been new weapon skins almost every week.   
---
Do you even play this game?
---
I expect it to be scrapping legendaries for tokens.
---
 These tokens will then be used to purchase 4th and 5th star legendary effects. 
---
I think these effects will be made up of the legendary effects that were removed from fallout 4 to 76.
---
I don’t think they’ll add back in some of the more ridiculous ones, but they’ll add in some of the more gentler ones. 
---
So you’ll be able to put like “+15 Fire dmg” on weapons and such. I don’t think they’ll add in any crazy modifications, but nice enough ones you’ll want.
---
Damn. I have to use a LMG to take down a scorchbeast.
---
I know it was perfect timing!
---
Yeah but at the point you can farm sbq for repair kits you aren't really exploring for junk. You're probably in the lack of end game collecting rares and legendaries and just farming up junk as you run out. 
---
For the average player going through the game it doesn't change anything. Lots of players don't even attempt sbq until lvl 60+
---
U could never have enough
---
But it isn't grinding, I am not sure what you consider grinding. But you aren't "grinding" the maps, you are trying to fill out the full map chart to get better higher quality maps, which have higher drop rates, etc.
---
What do you consider grinding? Loot running? Because if so fo76 is grindy as well because you need to do runs to find gear in it as well. Just like finding gear in PoE.
---
Yeah, god forbid people have different priorities on what they want
---
Good riddance
---
I lost my instigating squad shotgun a while back when I accidentally dropped it with another weapon. The bag completely disappeared. I was a sad panda for a few days afterwards.
---
Especially being top three and in survival haha
---
I renamed all my guns starting with a Z so they are the last on the list, to minimize the chance of this happening. Also in all caps so they stand out more, so it looks like this:
---
ZCOMBAT SHOTGUN  
---
ZGAUSSRIFLE
---
ZHANDMADE
---
ZLEVER ACTION
---
Is it still better than the chainsaw?
---
Ah okay. My team and I are always making ammo so we are constantly looking for steel and lead. Sometimes acid.
---
At least for the pipboy.
---
Unfortunately this is what I’d recommend people to do. It’s too bad though, an RPG game should have multiple ways to play. It shouldn’t be “yeah there are other ways to play, but if you’re not using a handmade don’t go to survival”
---
Don't even try, why bother ? If you want to do pvp go to survival. The first question I have for you is, why even take a workshop, what is your goal ? There are many places to get resources as well as placing your camp next to one. If you do need a workshop, select one out of the way, not a popular one, people are lazy and tend not to travel. 
---
3rd make blueprints of your workshop, build a minimalistic workshop and blueprint it, harvesters, water pumps, generators etc. Get some chameleon armour or not, watch the map, if someone does show up and starts contesting, leave immediately to avoid losing caps, go to a new world, use your blueprints to setup quickly.
---
I take thunder mountain for fusion cores, I can reset up in under 5 minutes flat .. someone shows up, I switch worlds and reset, no sweat .. I don't waste time fighting anyone. 
---
Only stay as long as you need to get what you want and then switch worlds to avoid been one shotted away from the workshop.
---
This has happened to me in PVE as well and it's really frustrating to die when you already hit the enemy 10 times.
---
I run melee and have killed a few people in survival with it. Haven't for a couple weeks but definitely have more than a few times
---
I'm just 3 levels higher than you, and play pretty casually as well. I had only found one or two legendary weapons until recently and I wasn't hunting for them. I just like using my modded handmade rifle, and I haven't had any issues taking on the enemies I've come across so far (I just avoid things like scorchbeasts and sheepsquatches). Where I saw a real uptick in legendary enemies (most 1\*, but also one 3\*) was when I had to go to the ski resort to finish the Order of Mysteries quest. There were a couple legendary super mutants up there. Then, because I was already in the area, another one in the raider camp just down the road from the train station, and yet another down the road at the train depot. Some were okay but not right for my build. I really don't think about acquiring them at all, but that said, an extremely kind player gifted me a great one, which I plan to use when I get to 45, especially to go solo a Sheepsquatch that was spotted in Welch (a level 50 variant; I'll still likely get wrecked).
---
Fab thanks!
---
Any weapon that includes an individual round loading animation can have the loading cut short by firing the weapon before it's complete.
---
I get this problem with the lever Action Rifle all the time, and you can't swap weapons until the reload completes, the LMG is probably the most frustrating, it takes 4 seconds to reload, but only 3 seconds to empty the 75 round magazine, if you hit the trigger before it completes, it will start the loading sequence over again.
---
So I take it you dont remember that days of single player games then, CoD, MoH and all these shooters used to be single player focused, it was literally all storyline, its only recently(ish) that the online play has poked its nose in and people decided that single player campaigns would now be a thing of the past.  
---
People used to buy CoD *for* the campaign and story, this only really changed come CoD3/CoD4
---
I have an executioners gamma gun, it's stupid effective
---
No, I just deck your camp with balloon, party decs and stuff.
---
Diablo 3 builds on expectations set by its predecessor, I'll give you that.
---
PoE uses microtransactions for funding.
---
Guild Wars 1, campaign DLCs and extra character slots else you can't even have every class playable. 
---
Guild Wars 2, purchasable in game money.
---
Borderlands are self-hosted games, no dedicated servers involved.
---
Torchlight 2 is peer to peer as well.
---
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a bunker  
---
Sometimes I feel like my only friend  
---
Is this stray dog I rescued  
---
I'm calling him Dogmeat  
---
Lone Wanderer no more  
---
Together we roam
---
Yeah the additional warning about scrapping items can be annoying but if it helps you from accidentally deleting an important item then it’s done its job
---
It's already unlimited on PC, this is Microsoft's fault and has nothing to do with Beth. But way to knee-jerk complain about irrelevant things!
---
Hahahaha. 
---
Oh god. Resident evil. 
---
I love how you've boiled them both down to zombies. 
---
Post apocalyptic settings are more than zombies. They are theme, tone, environment. 
---
If you think Resident evil has had a bigger influence on the post apocalyptic theme than the fallout franchise you need to give your head a shake.
---
Even a simple glance at gamer pop culture will tell you other wise. 
---
And if you think Scorched are the first zombie like enemy in Fallout, you've somehow not encountered ghouls over the past 15+ years 
---
The Fallout franchise had significantly more impact on the post apocalyptic video game setting than resident evil ever did. 
---
Otherwise we'd all be standing still to pivot, shoot and aim.
---
Use Sentinel armor, always be in sneak. Never lead them back to your CAMP. When I take a workshop, which is VERY rare. I build myself a 3 sided shack next to whatever resource node I want to harvest, and put the fast travel mat in there, so no one can snipe me when I'm harvesting. And a SHIT TON of turrets all around, so if someone does hopefully the turrets will at least take some of their health down. 
---
If I get that "someone is attacking your shit" thing I just bounce, too.
---
All I see is dead wings
---
That’s some good advice!
---
They should have implemented those features before releasing if that was the case.
---
Right now, it's a buggy Looter Shooter.
---
Good to know, thanks. The only daily farming I do right now is for ballistic fiber for my combat armor. =P
---
I would love to watch that! Still seems a lot of effort for dog food XD
---
It would be great for players to make their own towns.  4 friends build their 4 camps together on their shared borders, maybe even allowing snapping between friend structures too.  Could see some really incredible things built like this.
---
Probably not TSE, as the new hot item is now AntiArmor with Explosve. With all the Armor-ripping perks and AntiArmor effect, Power Armor is essentially paper in PvP. 
---
I would suggest atleast getting a set of Assassin's armor peices, doesnt matter what kind, as (as of current) damage reduction is WAY better than damage resistance. With a full set of Assassin's armor, you'll atleast be take 40% less damage across the board from players.
---
 As for rifle, it's cool. Explosive is always a good thing as it can stagger players who are using Sentinels Legendary armor and cause them to get out of their near-invulnerable state of being still. 
---
I would suggest finding an Executioner's Tesla Rifle for PvP scenarios and slapping on the Tormentors Perk. Alot of people rely on Bloodied/Unyielding builds and Executioner's rips right through them. Tesla Rifles are A.O.E. and bounce off surfaces, so you can literally just shoot at their feet and you will hit them. Energy weapons, including Tesla Rifles, also go straight through Sentinels...for some reason.
---
Good luck, hopefully this helps.
---
If you haven't discovered it already — if you follow the path around to the cliff of above the tunnel behind your camp, there are tons of aluminum and copper veins to mine. I loved camping there, and it was a nice bonus that it comes with free chem and brewing stations, and a cap stash/items in the tunnel.
---
Good tips here too. Thank you.
---
I still don't know what "TSE" or "bloodied" are, although I see the terms all the time in discussions. I figure I'll figure out what they are when I run into them.
---
It’s not impossible. It doesn’t make melee harmless. But it does, more than often, impact tight fights. Especially for a full sentinel enemy that requires Crits to kill. 
---
If a full sentinel player is standing still shooting, you would do the exact scenario that causes this glitch. And before you can correct it by leaving and reentering vats, you’re right in their close-to-invincible face and they’re lighting you up.
---
The "no damage" bug has been getting bad lately. I was dealing with a SB last night using a long-barrel gatling gun, and when I spun around to put down a couple of scorched adds, I got zero damage on each of them. Best I could figure at the time is that the barrels of the gatling gun were on the other side of the mobs? Hits me a lot in melee, too... like every other swing or so.
---
Nope, you don't need to have finished Lying Lowe.
---
Any chance you guys are just triggering serendipity on bloodied folks? Or does that perk not affect pvp?
---
Same here, I'm not sure I ever had more of a purpose than when I was stocking up ammo and meds for the Burrows.  Then I spent it all on the Impostor, but with actual raids coming prepping for that is pretty much the current goal.
---
I got photos of pretty much everything. Hatchlings and Glowing Mileurks don't count as spawns it seems.
---
Why not both?...make a quest to find the recipe,then add the ingredients ......like if you want a full bottle you add the ingredients for the cola and the bottles ( glass and steel)  or just add steel for the caps......or just glass for those bottle collection people
---
Very helpful. I am not thinking about this stuff enough so these are great tips. Thank you.
---
They're effects, bloodied is more dmg the lower your HP, and tse refers to "two shot" and "explosive". Both legendary effects, two shot is "shoots an additonal projectile" and explosive is "bullets explode for area damage"
---
I mean yeah, different things are worth different amounts to different people
---
What do you play on?
---
&gt; If you think Resident evil has had a bigger influence on the post apocalyptic theme than the fallout franchise you need to give your head a shake.
---
ROFL, yeah go ask most people who don't play video games to name a game about post apocolyptic zombies. They are gonna name RE long before they mention fallout. 
---
You are missing the point, FO76 isn't fallout. fo76 is a zombie game, not a fallout game. 
---
&gt;And if you think Scorched are the first zombie like enemy in Fallout, you've somehow not encountered ghouls over the past 15+ years 
---
Ghouls aren't zombies, to be a zombie it has to be something that can be contagious, radiation isn't contagious, scorched plague is. 
---
 &gt;Otherwise we'd all be standing still to pivot, shoot and aim.
---
ROFL, you have no clue what you are talking about if you think the old tank controls are still a thing. By that right, for it to be a fallout game shouldn't it be turn based and point and click?
---
IKR!!!
---
That's a good point, upvoted. Once somebody claims a shop they could potentially hog it all day. 
---
Maybe a mechanic could be introduced to solve that issue though. Something like scaling the difficulty of defense to be harder and harder each time, until it would be impossible to defend without help, which could lead to a person losing the shop. Then introduce a cool-down timer so that person cannot just reclaim it to start again at the lowest difficulty. If you don't share resources, you probably won't get help defending it. Share your shit and people will go out of there way to help you keep it. Or maybe they just stand there and watch you die, only to claim it themselves. 
---
Honestly, I don't have a problem with workshops as they are now because, outside of a few months after launch,  nobody ever really contests them anymore. At least not on PC. The last time someone contested my shop we didn't even fight, and split the power cores up between us. Kind of tells you about the majority of the player base here, which is why I don't think PVP in adventure mode is meant to last.
---
I kinda noticed my karma is taking a beating😅
---
Yeah a college education doesn't mean much to some people doesn't mean they get it cheaper
---
Really?  That's lame.
---
So they fixed all those bugs that were really bad in the beginning? I honestly don’t know the state of the game
---
I only have time to play a few hours a night so I’m not able to breakdown every mechanic in the game. Ugh!
---
TSE - Two Shot Explosive.  Bloodied - the lower your health, the higher the damage.
---
They may be using sentinel/cavalier legendary armor.
---
Going out on a limb but if they have say an instigating gauss with the x2.5 sneak multiplier, it'd be a huge initial hit.
---
I don't do PVP (I still have a host of questions about how that works exactly) -- I have Pacifist enabled -- and don't even do workshops because of it. That's not why I'm playing, but to each their own that want to. I explore and do quests like a single player game with other people around.
---
Kill Maxson for that coat every time. Plus fuck the brotherhood. 🤷‍♀️
---
It's called a joke.  Way to over-react!
---
Okay was gonna say if on ps4 to just game share to the other console but that doesnt apply here haha
---
I mean you could study online and save a lot of money so I don’t see your point 
---
Or move to Europe where it’s free
---
Couple of times I hit them with my dragon run up and finished them with my grognak
---
Try building just across the river south of Harper's Ferry. I've never been attacked there.
---
He's dead, Jim.
---
You cannot get at the acid easily because it is under water. Needs an extractor on it which can only be built in a camp or workshop. Best bet for acid is one of the workshops and be prepared to server hop if hassled.
---
Nah fam, you're just backpedalling cause you got caught. But OK whatever helps you sleep better.
---
I have one too with limb dmg
---
Why take workshops? Because you can't put your CAMP on a Fusion Core node? And harvesting 25% cores gets old after a while and sometimes you just want a grip of decent cores?
---
That's pretty cool
---
You seem nice.
---
Or only open the current owner up to PvP if they actually contest the workshop.  Either by stepping inside to stop the capture process or shooting at the people contesting with pacifist off.
---
I forgot to add that chameleon is SUPER nice to have in general. I always make sure one of my armor pieces has it. They can't vats you if they can't see you. ;)
---
My Power Armor pieces are disappearing after fast travel
---
3 pieces gone so far
---
So... yes... there’s a problem
---
Port to Widow's Perch rather than the actual event. It's very close to the Pylon Ambush Site, but should let you load in and prepare in safety.
---
There is farm near watoga with lake, have server with spawned queen in middle of lake, attack her, wait till he shot "granades" it is actualy eggs that will spawn babies, than run to houses and pull king, kill them on 1 place, make photo. Took me two tryies
---
Hopewell cave for sure, few hops and you will get 1, also when you find it take your photo but try to not murder it so other ppl can get their atoms.
---
Cheers
---
There’s a farm down south of the bog, it has it be 
---
Queen , king and hatchling all one picture
---
Easier done at higher levels , go on circles make a pile of corpses , wait for queen to spawn hatches bring both to the king corpses and kill.
---
Once the dust has settle take a picture and walk away victorious... lol
---
Ah dang. I'm on ps4. If only we had cross platform play, I could get you those serums. :(
---
There’s a lot of things that go into account here. Your best bet is to block everybody in your world from session. Nobody goes after a workshop there not at. Make you workshop expensive to claim. Nobody going to claim a expensive workshop if they can’t make there caps back. If you die let them take the workshop then go back in a few minutes. As far as your build goes. Rifleman is not good for pvp. The superior damage does not make up for lack of fire rate in PvP. Most PvP rifle builds are auto commander vat crit builds.
---
First, you only need 4 pieces, because nothing will ever reduce the weight by more than 90% on anything, I run 4 WWR &amp; 1 JWR.
---
I have quite a few Weight Reduction Armor pieces for sale (On Xbox) 1k-5k depending on the Armor &amp; effect, with Weapons Reduction Combat Armor being the most expensive, and FD&amp;C Reduction Leather being the cheapest.
---
Message me on XBL if you're interested in buying some, or if you have any Max level 3\* Instigating weapons I may make you a great Trade Deal.
---
GT= Medieval Paul, usually on from 5pm-10pm CST.
---
Not all but it was never as bad as claimed and it has improved massively. It really is a subjective judgement call when you are talking worth, but I have gotten every penny put into the game back in spades in entertainment.
---
"Cheaper"
---
"Just move to Europe"
---
If you mean taking online schooling instead of university then yes, however you arent getting university cheaper. You're, in this sense, buying a different game because you dont want to pay the full price of another.
---
&gt; a Sheepsquatch that was spotted in Welch (a level 50 variant; I'll still likely get wrecked).
---
I know that one. Guarding the Overseer log in Welsh. We've met. XD
---
I'm' a stealth rifle build, using crafted pipe weapons and stacked Rifle/Pistol perk cards. I'm doing alright so far, even solo'd my first scorchbeast recently, although it too a lot of ammo. 
---
I was just getting the impression that people were finding more legendaries that I have. Good to know I seem to be on the typical track. I'm doing the Order of Mysteries quests right as difficulty allows, so maybe I'll run into a few more as well.
---
Ah ok, that at least makes sense in the progression of the game.  Makes it worth doing at least (aside from gear), if the story opens up from doing that.
---
By the way, yes FO76 is grindy as hell, assuming you want to play at all past level 50 (or however long it takes you to complete the quests).  I wasn't defending that, just stating that it's pretty normal to expect to get to a  point in a game where grinding is pretty much all that's left.  FO76 isn't any different than 99% of other similar games in that respect.
---
The dmg is kinda addicting. I have a decent collection of god rolls and would love to use them but I can’t seem to get away from bloodied.
---
LMAO
---
Sure, did you read what I wrote after my first line about cores ?
---
What kind of butthurted fuckery... he asked a simple, polite question; no one put a gun to your head and forced you to read the entire thing and then leave a rude comment. Unbelievable.
---
I would often find Posiedon abandoned in the middle of the night (IRL time).  Take the WS, hang out, and take them as they were produced.  After a bad griefing event (Sub lvl 20 against 3 Lvl 50+ (kill me to take the workshop.  I respawn, kill, respawn, I run, they chase, killed again.  Repeat until I quit the game).
---
So I started actively farming the spawn sites.  (Some have up to 5 cores of varying charge levels.)
---
Camden park and line in the sand events drop them.
---
gotten a couple more from sentry bots.
---
With batteries included and othe perls, they weigh 0.3, so I dont care if they are 25% - they work
---
Now have a supply on hand, so don't actively farm the spawn sites, but I know where to look if I feel like my supply is getting low, adn I will take them if when I run across them :)
---
Those exploding eyebots are the worst..I lost my junk 3 different times..maybe next time I'll learn my lesson..and on top of that..I can never find the imposter after we defeat him
---
I usually don’t think about it much but when I am in need of more caps, I found You can make marine helmets and sell them to vendors . The roi is pretty good
---
Go to the space station unlock the door with the keypad and there is a spacesuit that is 60 caps and a helmet for 30
---
There are lots of game keys shops... Just google Fallout 76 key.
---
You'll find the game for about ~$12 nowadays. 
---
It is a bit of a grey area on how those keys were obtained but eh, that's one way of getting the game as cheap as possible.
---
Holy crap. Who needs travel agent when you can fly?
---
Are you saying OP is wrong? If you paid full price at launch, you did overpay.
---
Even people who like the game wouldn't advise you to buy it at $60+. Shit, I wouldn't even pay $30 for what is essentially still a beta. The game only recently became *barely* stable in that it doesn't crash *AS MUCH.*
---
Is there a set location for for the plans?
---
How does someone clear their cache and game data on the Xbox one? I'd love to be able to do that.
---
Vendor bots have 1400 cap where you can sell all excess junk and gear you dont need and their cap "stash" refresh every 20 hours.
---
Second very fast way to gain caps is to trade with other players and sell valauble junk and gear you have
---
Skeet shooter I think the perk is
---
Try Mac’s Farm in the Cranberry Bog.  I’ve gotten a Queen, King and Spawn there.
---
At 400 hours your options are biv daily quests or rerunning encrytid to get the last of the cosmetics. The rest is scavenging junk for my gear that destroys every hour or so, or farming better and better lengendaries. I would love if there were more quests for me to do, but we’re just not there. I think with player vending the gameplay loop grind will be so much better for people because they can turn in these trash legendariws for a shot at something great
---
It is, i got it there.
---
The difference with PoE having microtransactions though is, they are purely cosmetic and the game is completely free.
---
As for getting atom in game, no you can't not after a point. Once you do all the challenges you only get left with the dailies, that half the time are impossible to complete, such as the alien one last week, or the camera one the week before that, or the brewing one the week before that. ETC
---
That's just maps too. Path of exile has more than just maps in the end game (and they are also things you can do while you level up, but early or late game it all usually feels rewarding relative to the level your character is). It has the endless delve where you go underground and it only gets harder as you go. Major new mechanics added every 3 months in free updates that sometimes eventually become core. The game is nothing like it was just two years ago.
---
Poe only feels like a grind when you've already played the hell out of it. I've been playing it since 2011 and only certain aspects ever feel grindy. Like leveling from 92 to 100 or farming specific divination cards etc. Honestly no matter what aspect of poe I decide to play, it never feels grindy, and if it does then I've played the league for a month or two already and I take a break until the next league.
---
Fo76 is totally a survival looter shooter. All you're doing is looting and killing. There's not a whole lot more to it than that. But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable for some people. I really enjoy playing it with my roommates for example.
---
Holding the power button down for 10 seconds when shutting down the console I think. This was unsuccessful for me .
---
So sue me I said "special repair kits" instead of  "repair kits". You knew what I meant. 
---
I did play the game, even bought the tricentennial edition. Worst fucking idea ever as the game is simply a glorified asset flip and its still buggy as fuck. I pop back on here to see if they have made things better but once they fix something they break something else. Oh and of course I laugh at how ridiculous fanboys can be.
---
You are clearly one of those people clinging onto the original idea for dear life. Let me hit you with the cold hard truth. They will support F76 for awhile but I wouldn't expect anything significant. They will keep you ticking by till they can finally just pull the plug. Their biggest addition so far has been a shitty PvP mode. I don't see a big resurgence of F76 players, what I do see is the game gradually fade away from peoples consciousness only to remind publishers how NOT to release a game.
---
Sorry. I don't recall precisely when the recipes were removed. I see lots of mentions of April 8th; the same time they combined the vendor pool. I thought there was something official, but I'm seeing lots of complaints about it being a stealth nerf. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgk6y5/dear_bethesda_can_we_get_an_official_response_on/
---
It takes WAY more time than 5 minutes to get a decent amount of cores, unless you have a magic trick no one else knows.
---
Doesn't necessarily mean your banned, could be the game is trying to connect you to server that's going down for maintenance for some reason.
---
Don't do it man. There is no "endgame" so no reason to rush. Just enjoy the ride, rushing just cheats yourself.
---
Need some specifics to offer any real insight.  Offhand, fighting the Sheepsquatch or SBQ, or anywhere there's a real chance of getting hurt or killed - I'm not necessarily going to risk dropping my loot bag if a bunch of noobs are in the way.  I never tackled high-level areas or opponents until I had earned what I felt was the right to be there, where I could contribute.  Also, a lot of high-level peeps are just grinding for god-tier weapons and or caps.  Time is money.
---
Lmaooooodnsjjx like just stop, this is not a valid or sensible comparison lmaooooo this person is literally just trying to be frugal like what the fuck is wrong with you people!!!!!
---
Buy the plans in Harper's Ferry, craft your own
---
Yeah I totally get that it depends on what you’re looking for. I wasn’t into it at first, but the idea of just exploring a fallout world, fucking around, and meeting people is getting more appealing. I see a lot of cool stories here and I just want to experience it and see if it’s my thing
---
Me too, I get occasional level 1 mole rats, ferals, and mongrels but the all come from one direction and my single turret takes them out fast. And it’s a short run to the flatwoods vendor to sell bulked junk. I had been on the golf course and the damn super mutants drove me crazy.
---
As long as you get your piece of paper that says you graduated...
---
I will just be honest I may get a downvote for this but I am here to play fallout not with others , I still treat this like a single player game and never team up , so you are in my game and just have to keep up or go somewhere else.
---
Thanks anyway! And yeah, cross platform really is the way of the future, if only we could get Sony to see that and open up the flood gates. There has been some progress, but not nearly enough.
---
No one is complaining about reading it? The game is already cheaper than what a lot of people paid, and the guys asking for a loophole to get it cheaper which doesn't sound legal other than the obvious "buy a used copy".
---
Doesn't matter how polite the question is.
---
You can by the plans from the vendor bot at Harper’s Ferry. I don’t know of any reliable/recurring spawn points for them, but maybe someone else does.
---
now that I have my power armor I try to pick up every gun that isn't a pipe rifle/10 mm. They sell for 25+ caps. If you can find one with lots of mods on it it can sell for 75+. I make a few hundred per run but I a usually do this while doing a junk run. I also sell every single aid that I pick up. I keep all stimpacks and nuka colas and I will sell radaway/radx if I have more than 5 or so.
---
When you are talking 2010? That was long after those games had any sembelence of story remaining and it was all about xbox live or playstation online, for those games at that point. So I was saying you were comparing it to a game that are known for no story at that point.
---
I do remember single player shooter games, such as goldeneye and perfect dark. Those have story lines and take longer than 20 hours to beat if you aren't speedrunning them.
---
The game you named was even known and shamed for the piss poor storyline it was right when people were starting to get annoyed with the loss of storylines at that point.
---
Nah, you can access the rename feature from any inventory or crafting menu so it's not nerve wracking at all.
---
Hey, thanks for answering my question! I will look around for keys. I am looking forward to trying this game out, the idea of it is growing on me and I read a lot of cool stories here
---
Ive only ever found one in game spawn, its much better to craft your own.
---
Must have scrubbed out of PvP.
---
Here's a screenshot: [https://i.imgur.com/iRr9jYS.png](https://i.imgur.com/iRr9jYS.png)
---
They look terrible, honestly. Kind of a bummer, they could be a neat addition. They don't even use the font on the Pickaxe light.
---
yup.  posted about that too.  about 2 weeks ago.  lost excavator left leg and helmet.  friends having same issue.
---
All he did was ask for the best price for the game and yall are literally acting like he "insulted" people because you cant handle... facts. Stop trying to rationalize the nonsense. Stop trying to make this a legal issue, youre doing too much to try and get your point across; it's falling flat!
---
It's caused by bad server latency, not really a "bug". You can try resetting your router and (if on console) resetting your connection and reboot the game. Fixes the issue most of the time for me.
---
I found mine at harpers ferry after many server hops. There’s other things you can manufacture and sell, I’m sure more people will chime in
---
My thing is if you have dedicated so much time to the game &amp; have everything and are good at not dying clearly bc you are such high level. Why would a simple noob get in the way , if you can easily defend yourself with all the awesome weapons and armor y’all have?? I guess bc there’s good ppl in the game and then there is asshole who just think the game is all theirs. My opinion of course. But thank you for your comment. I do see the sense in it.
---
I remember a post a while back... some guy was legitimately outraged that he had farmed whitesprings for a total of 20 hours and hadn't looted a TSE.
---
I mean im like 340 hours and and ive done basically all of those, i was talking about daily and weeklys. Its not hard to get maybe 3-4 hundred a week
---
i just named all my stuff (in fo4) \_&lt;item&gt;, i.e. \_5.56 Handmade Rifle
---
That works too. 
---
Either way, something, needs to happen.
---
Do you use hard bargain?
---
I'll keep those in mind when I get around to running the numbers.
---
Yes. Yes I am an elitist. 
---
I read. I will gladly reference that fact when discussing the merits of styles of story telling. 
---
If you're a non reader and I've upset you..... Meh. 
---
If you read YA and I've upset you....good. Go pick up a real book. Not this trash meant to squeeze money out of millennials so they can feel booky and post book shelf tours on social media. 
---
There's a good reason I bring up books and reading into a discussion about story telling.....
---
With the exception or oral story telling, it's longest existing form of story telling....
---
Of course and that is very respectful answer to this. I don’t team up as well but when ppl especially lower level or if they just start out if they can’t defeat someone i help. But of course that’s just me. Thank you for your comment!
---
 Yeah I tried for a while. Then went back later but its still the same.
---
 I have submitted a ticket.
---
I wouldnt take it to event if my stash wouldnt be full, but thats another story.
---
The issue is they don’t have everything. Search posts of players with hundreds of hours who have found diddly squat. The games RNG is FUBAR, so they are hitting everything just like everyone else. The issue is that based on their build and mutations, that one hit is a kill shot.
---
Outside of repair kits and the slippery slope argument, Atom Store is cosmetic only as well.  
---
As for challenges. That's still plenty of atom points with the other half of the dailies being completable.
---
So many rads though
---
Skeet shooter like mentioned and also I put a long scope on mine. I also use vats most of the time.
---
That is also true. Don’t get me wrong to me of course this game is amazing &amp; I play for fun not to make money or anything like that. But I do see your point. Thank you!
---
Holy shit reading this was stressful lol
---
Exactly, that was what I was trying to get across to the person above. I honestly haven't played since pre cataclysm when it added in Oriatha(spelling?) So its been a couple years. The last time I played was the season they added those shrines or w/e that opened up a ton of monsters and had bosses in them, they were like rifts.
---
PoE absolutely blows FO76 out of the water in regards to story, replayability, and enjoyability. I completely agree that PoE never ever felt like a grind, the maps were always different enough to be fun and different especially chaos orbing them to make them rares.
---
Damn it, now I might have to go back and download PoE again.
---
If you read my comment i did specifically the worst example i can think of, so the worst offender
---
They usually drop the content every other week. This was an off week. They have done a few fixes on off weeks but that is about it.
---
I suspect you will be disappointed with the vendor when it shows up.
---
One spawns in Berkeley Springs. It’s in a shack on the roof of the salon (northwest part of the town).
---
It takes so long for the area to render when you land that there is no real tactical advantage to it too. So I say fair game haha :)
---
Dude. Biv is one of the best NPCs ever made. Fight me. =P
---
Berkeley springs has a static spawn on the roof of one of the buildings
---
You honestly think that RE has a bigger impact on Post apocalyptic gaming than fallout? 
---
There's the door. 
---
Name anything other than zombies that RE popularized as far as theme and setting goes....
---
I know 100% it’s not connecting.
---
VATS crit bar doesn’t go up on these hits I’m talking about. 
---
But yeah this can happen and it sorta looks the same
---
It’s brutal right now. 10 hits with a bloodied dcg and no damage.  Really makes Melee tough right now.
---
You can also get the plans at the Watoga train station. Craft the level 15 variants, and scrap. Biggest pain, but maybe not for someone your level, is the 8 screws needed each time.
---
Me and my friend took a workshop yesterday. We held it for around an hour. Two guys in T51b pa showed up and one shot us.
---
It was absolutely as bad as claimed, enough already.
---
You think it’s more of a “one-shot nerf” issue?
---
I probably find one handmade a week, and lets just say I play way too much.  I found all my mods by buying the plan, crafting dozens, and scrapping them.  I've never seen a consistent place where you could expect a handmade, and I've never seen one where others said it was a sure thing:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1txh1/guaranteed\_handmade\_spawn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1txh1/guaranteed_handmade_spawn/)
---
Patches dont equal content. I only looked at the last 4 updates but none of then included content...I'm sure there are more than just those 4 as well.
---
It happens PvE, PvP, in and out of VATS
---
Dude just calm down, haha. What facts are we referring to? I'm allowed to defend my point the same way you are, so chill.
---
I was in a trading screen trying give someone a 3 star cavalier left leg for free. some other player was walking in between us and pushing us away from eachother. Somehow the trade screen got canceled and instantly reopened in a trade with this other player. Didnt know that could happen, but i think he knew. 
---
Since i didnt realize i was trading with the wrong person, i gave him the armor for free. I asked him to be a good person and give it back. Instead, he was a dick and tried to sell it to the player i was trying to give it to. 
---
Not everyone playing fo76 does the right thing, but more often than not, we like to help each other.
---
Farming caps is just an excuse. It is always about the thrill of the kill. That punch of adrenaline you get when you take down another player. It's why hunting for sport is a thing. We humans love to kill things that can't protect themselves, including other people, and in a video game we are just expressing those feelings in a virtual world. 
---
I used to get that all the time in Eve Online, like sometimes you'd seriously get the shakes, but the rush afterward was pretty incredible. Especially when you land that first solo kill. Keep in mind Eve Online is a haven for griefers, and is encouraged by the devs, but even then you can choose to be a dick or not. It's our actions when faced with these choices that reflect who we are as human beings.
---
However, at times I feel some players actually cross the line between what is fun pvp, and what is just pure sociopath behavior. Whether it is in a video game or real life, taking actions that are intended to hurt others for fun, without conscience, is a reflection on that person's poor mental state. Normally people feel bad when they hurt others, sociopaths do not. 
---
PVP can be fun without all of the griefing. Just like any combat sport like MMA or boxing. They are just all games in the end, but games are meant to be fun for everyone.
---
Yes they do, they just don't announce it in the patches. They added new runewords.
---
Some people don't like playing The Sims.
---
yes, I also heard that higher charisma gives better prices but mine is only 3. Suposedly grape mentats help a bit but I haven't tried those yet.
---
Lol, I understand the feeling. Felt the same when dmg for TSE was nerfed. But this isn’t dmg reduction, I would rather have that, this is just full on fits not doing anything at all.
---
This post is getting downvoted by people who 1. Don’t run melee and don’t want melee players to stand a chance 2. People who take issue with the harsh language against the game
---
To be fair, I'm not trying to do that but at my lvl it's harder not to one shot enemies sometimes.
---
I bought the handmade plans from Graham the wandering super mutan.
---
Man I have no idea. I'll never understand the logic of a person 1 shot killing something during an event. We herded cows and then some asshole just 1 shot kills the Sheesquatch before it even legendaried last night, and I just don't get it at all. I'm level 122, and even if I can 1 shot something, I'll peg it's leg instead so other people can have a chance. 
---
I get people that want it to be a single player game, I would LOVE to have my own server. But it's not, and I don't. So I'm willing to help other people now and then, and if that means not killing everything in one shot, then so be it. The thing is gonna die, why be a dick?
---
Litereally created survival horror... Which fo76 claims to be survival...
---
Thanks for the offer, but I like enjoying the game naturally for at least my first play through!
---
Thank you for the link!
---
I'm almost level 50 and I've seen an uptick in the number of legendaries I'm finding now that I can take on Whitesprings (unnuked), Harper's Ferry and Fort Defiance.
---
Being out in the wilderness for too long can get you jumpy 😂
---
That is kind of my point, you have to use the worst example you can think of just to make fo76 look slightly less bad. That isn't a good thing.
---
Of course. I have seen where it is literally a one shot one kill thing. But thank you for your comment. Honestly I’m just looking for different insights.
---
Any of those would work, better than the executioners 50cal I got that chews through ammo faster than I can make it. Furious, quad, executioners or even two shot. Any of those with increased rate of fire would be nice. If I could get a 3 affix I’d love faster reload or reduced weight XD but those are totally optional
---
My normal way of getting the daily 1400 caps is to find Uranium Fever. I pick up everything that drops from the event and from the normal mole miners. After scrapping materials, I’m overencumbered with weapons and mats. I hoof it down to the WS Station and sell everything with level 3 of hard bargain and grape mentats. That’s usually close to 1,000 caps.
---
Lmao bye like I am calm, why do yall deflect so hard when it comes to that? Its called an argument, I'm not yelling at you...
---
Nope, Atom shop was P2W prior to repair kits because of the 60+ Hp boost the unstoppable outfits gave you could buy in the atom shop.
---
Where on the map is this?
---
Hopewell, and it helps if you can pacify it lol.
---
They do slightly more damage but it cycles way faster than a bolt action so DPS is higher. The downsides are you can't mod the magazine for armor piercing or extra capacity and you reload bullets individually.
---
If you were on Xbox I could sell you some decent weapons at very reasonable prices.
---
My advice is keep on grinding, the God Role weapons are very rarebit it's RNG, so the more drops you get the more chances you have for great stuff.
---
Don't underestimate the Events that have guaranteed legendary enemies like "Uranium Fever", and "One Violent Night", contrary to popular belief I have gotten a level 45 TSE Handmade from Uranium Fever.
---
Most of my better Drops seem to come from the Cranberry Bog region, but I have also gotten a lot from White Springs, and West Tek is always on my Go To list.
---
If you don't like the game why are you on the games offixal subreddit commenting?
---
I got a sniper/heavy build. I collect stimpacks cause I know there’s no point in using, just on team mates 🤣 in survival I had people spawn camping but the one was on the ground near with a melee. So I’d get real close, and since the minute I attack I’m red and dead, i used my explosive lever action to kill him, and myself. Since I killed my self, i get his caps and keep mine. Win for me lmfao
---
I don't know what's worse...
---
Not getting loot or putting in a couple thousand rounds with 8-10 other players and not seeing her damage go below 75% after she healed. Happened the last 2 times. Not really sure how that many of us trying to take her down and not seeing her damage go down at all.
---
No I meant resetting up a new workshop takes 5 mins, so if you taking cores, just keep taking cores until someone shows up, if they do, use your blueprints and reset a new workshop with your blueprints. You get 1 core every 7.5 minutes, I am running around with 90 cores just farming this way. No point wasting caps or contesting it fighting someone .. just move on ..
---
How am I supposed to answer that kind of loaded question? I'm sorry if you think 76 is so bad, but I love the Fallout series and not survival games in general. I choose to have fun with it and enjoy the company of others who do too. If you think other games do these mechanics in a better way or in a setting you enjoy more, that's your opinion, and I didn't ask for it.
---
completely wrong I was a moderator on it I know the full story,its sad but i guess everything about fallout 76 is
---
I wanna know what kinda weapon someone used to "one shot" the sheepsquatch...I have not seen this yet.
---
*\*seethes in BlackBird paint fury\**
---
My advice is to ask how many hours playing the game the money put in is worth to you.
---
If that number even comes out to a buck an hour you are going to get way more than your moneys worth.
---
this is what in was looking for. I understand not everyone is as humble but I am the same way. I know being a level 66 isn’t much but I consider it since this is my first time playing an online game. I’ve met people like you that actually help and want to do mission and share the loot and I’ve met people that literally do what you have said. It’d be nice to have a server with no assholes in it tho. Thank you for your comment !
---
But youre telling me I can't argue... Deflecting whatever I say. And I know you aren't yelling, or I'd be a little more turned on.
---
Hahahahahbaabahabaa.
---
Hahahahahababaaba. 
---
What the fuck does survival horror have to do with popularizing the tone, setting, aesthetic and themes in post apocalyptic style games?
---
I like the game tbh, I am able to enjoy myself with it and salvage fun. Me liking the game is separate from the facts, and its important to keep those facts straight.
---
I'm with you.  I'm nearing level 200 and I've never found a TSE weapon, and I don't have a crazy set of armor.  I enjoy running around shooting stuff, seeing what the drops are, and trying the Events.  I like dropping unwanted items in the Overseer's stashes so lower-level players might get something cool.  If griefers are wrecking someone's day, I try to help.  Just another squirrel trying to get a nut!
---
Was just thinking about the sentinal armor like you brought up, I've ran into that too and it drives me nuts... Been looking for an aae dragon fo that situation
---
No, this is literally a thing on guides, telling people to farm workshop players for caps after the patch that increased the cap amounts you get per kill. 
---
It isn't about being a dick, it is literally how these people are farming caps past the 1400 a day limit. This wasn't that big of a thing until the patch that increased the rewards caps. 
---
If it was about the thrill etc then you wouldn't see such an uptick in people doing it after the patch that increased the reward for killing players.
---
Even at endgame you still need to farm for junk for repairs, until now. Now you just need it for ammo.
---
yeah, like when your missile turret sees something it doesn't like and starts shooting, i have a small hart attack every time, the whole camps shakes  :D
---
Yeah completely true.
---
What does survival horror have to do with a survival game.... Really? Are you being intentionally dumb or are you actually that bad at reading comprehension.
---
I know what I'm doing now since I'm getting into the game again
---
All I asked you to do was stop rationalizing the nonsense. Didnt realize that was the entire crux of your "argument", but go off
---
Of course. I’ve seen the craziest things and heard the worst things on the mics with people. It’s insane. But thank you. Honestly I’m learning new things I just started playing online and this is my first online game. But I’ve played the previous fallout games. So this is what I do on my spare time. Just wish people weren’t all that bad sometimes.
---
I've been curious about the future of the caps and economy as well. Are there any official statements on how vending will be rolled out? I know the caps limit was said to be going up when they are introduced.
---
I'd also like to see a market hub, some new town that has vendor space available for rent. If they are at camps that'll take a lot of effort to market yourself for traffic.
---
I'd like to see stash adjustments. 25k limit on your person at one time is fine I guess but more caps should be able to be stored at your stash. Its also silly we can't have multiple stashes with independent capacities.
---
I wasn’t able to do anything for the las 20 minutes stuck on error codes
---
&gt; Every game tells a story and the story and the ways that game tells the story is what differences bad games from good games.
---
No? I could give less a shit about the story in a game if the Gameplay sucks. I play games for Gameplay. I don't play games for, in most cases, poorly written stories. If you want a good story then read a book or watch a movie. There are only a million in existence.  Not to say that some games don't excel at good story telling. However, if the game had an amazing story but the worst Gameplay, why would you put yourself through that?
---
If you think good story telling is the difference between whether a game is good or not then you're simply wrong.
---
Why would i fight you? I agree with you. He is a physical thing in the fallout universe. I love him.
---
He's way better than any holotapes
---
If you're on pc i will sell you a plan for half the vendor price
---
I would move my camp around a lot more if I could actually blueprint my existing one, I put a lot of work into it, fighting bugs with the build system all the way. 
---
The design isn't blueprintable because of bugs (even tried piecemeal simple stages of it in a workshop, wont work).
---
shotgun accuracy directly impacts the spread size. hip-fire accuracy mods help a lot, as well as the skeet shooter perk. for the combat, scopes if you don't mind using them.
---
TS tends to miss vats hits for no reason. it's somewhat random, really.
---
What facts are you referring to?
---
I like collecting the outfits but the server hopping and moving around to find those last few outfits is really grindy and I don't find any enjoyment logging in, checking, logging off, logging in, checking, logging off. Pretty mundane form of entertainment. I too am looking forward to the new content.
---
This happened for me during my last 2 SBQ runs. 
---
Last night was the kicker though, there were 8-10 100+ level players trying. We got her down to 50% (took forever) and then we couldn't get her down past 75% after she healed. Usually you can see the damage she is taking, but now it's impossible.
---
ALL I WANT IS SOME PRIME PLANS.
---
Well no thats just the one that sticks in my mind but most games can be played and completed in under 20 hours
---
Do the triad radio array astronomy for mats and craft them.  I have all the learnable handmade mods from earlier in the game farming those 3 sites.  There might be a better route now - haven’t had to do it anytime recently.
---
Yeah I should have focused on that point I think it would be a good opportunity to try to fix a couple things before the new patch so if it does break something they have less stuff to fix
---
My Team works the full circle and we take turns logging at the Golf Club each round, as long as no one is in the cell, it works most of the time, just make sure everyone is behind the Bus.
---
It isn't deleting them.  
---
Chances are, you were in a rush of looting something and accidentally transferred items from your inventory into something, a container of some sort.  I was at a SBQ battle and ran up to loot a Mirelurk Queen and was shocked to get a All Rise sledgehammer from it.  After the SBQ battle I went into area voice chat and asked if anyone might have lost a weapon in the battle and to come up to me and tell me what it was and I'll give it back.  Someone ran up to me and started emoting to me, and eventually we got his mic working and he told me that he was missing the 'unique hammer weapon' which he had borrowed from a team mate.  Thankfully I was able to get it back to him.
---
You need to be SLOW in interacting with containers, Bethesda made a change that makes it too easy to accidentally drop weapons and gear.  
---
WE NEED SOME DAMN LOCKS ON OUR STUFF.
---
But you have to realize, you're the only one calling it nonsense, we don't see it as such. Go off? Unfamiliar with that
---
Sure if you are speed running them. But just playing them normally? No you shouldn't beat a looter style game like this in 20 hours.
---
Level 426! Not your first scorchbeast player....
---
Mega sloth symbol maybe?...
---
I’ve never teamed up, tbh I’ve never really seen the point in it. I’m more of loner but when i see lower level players in the vicinity, whether it be in an event or just around and about I always nerf my perks to do less damage.  For example, if I’m using my Gatling , I’ll take off all the related perks so it only does base damage
---
When it comes to events, I’ll tag but not finish off.  I don’t want lower level players being disheartened and leaving.
---
Im not going to sit here and list every observed exploit, glitch, performance issue and server issue. Every single day this board is flooded with threads detailing the issues, you can read them for further details.
---
Gopher.
---
While I agree with what you say, look at the players on the map when you play, there's actually quite a lot of high level/played an extreme amount of hours players.
---
prairie dog
---
Thank you for that. I’m all honestly it has happened to me , it’s hard not to get discouraged or not want to play bc of that. But thank you for what you do for the lower levels!
---
no its a prairie dog
---
Who says the backpack fits INSIDE the power armor suit? Why can't I strap a backpack on the back of my armor? Heck, I think I could strap some giant motorcycle saddlebags back there and still march around.
---
Ahhhh. I totally see that
---
nuka grenades are great as they can blow up those pesky enemies stuck in ground or walls but quantom grenades feel...... well feels like they went flat before I made them and its like pew....
---
mostly I use mirvs / nuka / plasma (they are everywhere) / molatovs and pulse
---
nope prairie dog
---
 Yeah they do blow up. ;)
---
We aren't talking about mechanics. We're talking about the popularization of the post apocalyptic theme, tones, setting etc....
---
Thank guys, totally forgot about Hopewell
---
I’ve been using an lmg in survival what’s bad is that the higher level you are the worse it is to play pvp everyone says “*insert higher level* only killed me because they are a higher level” but the lower level you are the less you lose
---
I think it has already been mapped out. When vending goes live your machine shows on the map. Players travel to you. Part of the patch is that your camp becomes indestructible. 
---
I think setting up at Whitesprings wont work for most. Part of the game is making a great looking camp and having people come by and drink, play music and shoot the shit. 
---
If my camp is free from being smashed I'm ok with many players stopping by for punch and to bullshit a little.
---
Why? The foundations are already square and they snap.
---
Okay, care to share these unique things that fo76 has that hasn't been done a million times over in other games?
---
Wait until you loot the box at the Red Rocket.  It's full of so much good stuff.
---
Most people would agreee that attacking someone because theyre trying to get a game that you personally love for cheaper, is nonsensical and perhaps even just mean. 
---
You never heard anyone say go off? Aaaaand youre uncultured, lmao. Just take your upvotes and head out tbh
---
same experience, more griefers especially at workshops.
---
I wouldn’t mind a free code so I could pass along my copy to a friend ( whose doesn’t like digital )
---
This game IS a loot shooter at the end of the day. What's wrong with calling it what it is? It's fun either way.
---
There have been multiple exploit, glitch, performance and server issue fixes since the launch of the game. As stated per the patch notes which you can read on this subreddit for further details.
---
Never looted a tse ever and i just broke 800 hours. A few aae pistols  and a lot of good melee drops.
---
I'm assuming your on XB. Clear your reserved space for FO76, and it'll start. You will lose your photos, so screenshot any you can't love without first.
---
As a high level character I think that behavior is unnecessary, I would have to say this is just mostly general selfish douch-baggery as all they have to do is De-buff a bit (take off a couple Perks / use slightly weaker weapon etc to not 1-shot everything) or invite the lower levels around to a team.  
---
Note 1:  If you are on a Team with other players (like these high levels) you will get loot from everything they kill as long as you are in a somewhat close proximity to them when they kill it (even if you didn't even hit it, but if you dont hit it, you get no XP).
---
Note 2: If you run Power Armor - get the Torso mod called "Tesla Coils" as it deals Energy damage to nearby enemies, so you could just run past all the enemies the high level is killing (first, before they 1 shot them) to do a bit of damage, which should allow you to get XP and Loot them.
---
I really appreciate you taking the tone to answer my question honestly. However, I find it very odd that in order to empathize with a character, you *have* to see some physical representation of them. Did you not empathize with the family trapped in the Vault 34 because you don't see them before making the choice? What makes the Think Tank different from a character like Rose? What about the story of Freddy, who might actually still be alive (most of that story wasn't even told through holotapes)?
---
I was also one of the moderators I know the full story and trust me its deep,its sad how it all ended but  i guess everything about 76 is sad.I can ell you what happened if anyone is still even alive
---
I still have ptsd from vats instant teleporting melee kills lol
---
 I want this so much.  I've lost two bloodied auto grenade launchers somehow.
---
Ammo is super easy to make, especially if you've got a good source of acid.. there's a few spots in the South West, if you wear excavator armor, you can grab several hundred lead from deposits in about two minutes, server hop and do it again.. I make absurd amounts of ammo pretty quickly, as long as I have enough acid at least.
---
There have been no attacks, and where are most of these people? I see you, and I know what it means just wanted to give you a little more fuel to let the toxicity out ;)
---
Feel ya bud. My story not so happy. I sold mine to a vendor , unknowingly and when i returned it had already been purchased. My best melee lvl 45 with 40%power damage increase plus faster swinging i believe. So sad lol.
---
Wrote a ticket to Bethesda (3 actually)
---
Got the standard reply (“Sorry for inconvenience... can’t replace ... etc etc)
---
We don’t need the replacement as much as a fix to this problem
---
That’s an excellent point
---
Oh okay I thought you meant it as “suck it up”
---
I think the way forward for open world games in general is more (meta?) systems involving npcs/mobs across the whole map.
---
Think Shadow of Mordor series, think Mount and Blade. An almost board game/strategy layer of AI agents affecting other aspects of the world.
---
Players get the benefit of stuff changing in the game world, and the ability to push back against those mobs (even if it is simply fighting) to influence those changes.
---
 No I'm on PC, I'm pretty sure I have no reserved space.
---
PS. Mine were also excavator with one of new paints (silver).   Were your pieces painted?
---
They were in the Atom Shop during the winter holiday season.
---
Simplest way is to just stay crouched at all times while holding it. Don't give them a target to FT to, if they try to take the workshop, let them. If they're in it for the PvP, they'll move on, if they want the workshop, you can move on.
---
Are you on the ps4?  My husband and I had passed a under the bridge homestead Saturday.
---
"PeRhApS EvEn JuSt MeAn" hahaha I hope so
---
Yes, you are right, and I have been reading it all every week. Theres still an enormous number of issues still present and still being posted about, and regardless, them working on the issues NOW or ALONG THE WAY does not change the fact that we were shipped essentially a beta, at FULL PRICE. 
---
When you get into an accident, If the engine is fucked, fixing the windshield isnt going to really help with anything besides making the car look...prettier.
---
Are you like, denying these facts?
---
Thank you for your comment! And yes that is what I wanted to understand. I understand being a lower level can get difficult to work with but most of them just want to team up and have a good time. (Well I do usually)
---
Alright I'll try this out.
---
Exactly, sure they might be making some money now in atom shop, but imagine the profits if they actually fix all bugs and people come back/start playing it because they heard Bethesda actually took time to repair the game?
---
Exactly this.
---
My X-01 gives me about the same carry capacity as my excavators armor does due to the increased strength chest mod and the leg mods that up carry weight. But I’ll have to look into that, any great sources of steel? Acid is something I have tons of but steel and lead are always in short supply
---
So dead ones work too? Might make it easier.
---
Have some up votes you wholesome vault dwellers!
---
👍🏼. Just don’t ever tell me u got a God tier weapon from a legendary I helped tag for you when all I got is a rolling pin 😂😂😂
---
The thin veneer of civility won’t last long 😂
---
Was one a "death bag" by chance? Normally if you drop a bag, then drop a second bag, it will move the first bag under you and add the secondary items to the bag instead of creating another bag.
---
How many hours have you put into the game OP?
---
I think this would give a good idea of where you're coming from.
---
I mean, the same console automatically uploads up to 10gigs of save data, screenshots, video, etc.. safe to say that Bethesda is photo Nazis, that's all.
---
I was wondering about that too. Thanks for the info. Is the pickaxe pilsner mirror the only type of mirror, or are there other mirrors with different beer names?
---
Okay, if you're going to mention reading g comprehension make sure you don't display a lack of it yourself. 
---
We're discussing Fallout and RE. Not just 76. At least the other guy seemed to understand that. 
---
Also, notice how I keep using the word "popularize".... Which does not mean "Invented, created, first of it's kind" etc.
---
Fallout is arguably one of the most popular franchises set in a post apocalyptic setting in gaming. Games like Borderlands and that newly released game which I can't recall the title of, there's motorcycles and such in it, clearly take heavy influence from the themes, tone, and aesthetics that fallout has built it's success around. We're talking strictly in gaming here.
---
That being said, obviously fallout too heavily from the Mad Max film's. The physical settings are very similar, raiders are an obvious nod etc.
---
No, it was two bags of stuff in my base.
---
Of course, great tactic
---
Sorry, I was confusing it with the 4:8:2006 error.
---
I didn't even get a "good" legendary until I was well over level 100. I've mostly got random junk, and I've done quite a few legendary farming sessions.
---
A lot of people have also gone to the marketplaces here and on Discord and bought nice legendary pieces.
---
Cool.
---
Ah, that is fair, and most unfortunate then =(
---
I find it weird that a blueprint’s budget is less than the actual budget of the structure I’m trying to blueprint.
---
Lmao! Oh heck no! And I honestly think that is ridiculous how someone can get a legendary and someone else can get something like a rolling pin😂
---
I'm at that point now. The only reason I'm not leveling alts is because Bethesda refuses to give us shared inventory between characters so it makes trying to share gear between alts frustrating.
---
Driving a camper through whitesprings
---
Bloodied deathclaw gauntlets, probably. All  I know is a couple of times, and I've done the Sheep like 30 times, is I'd get the pylons and before I'd even had a chance to look for the thing it was dead already.
---
I have gotten several at white springs as junk. I already have the camera so can anyone validate if it can be used to create the camera? I will try by dropping the one I have when I get off
---
Yeah that's my issue. My main characters are 180 and I have full signal assassin's armor and absolutely no blood weapons outside of a bloody laser rifle and a bloody Ripper. But I guess that's half the fun of it farming and grinding for some unyielding armor
---
I dont need 10 people upvoting me to know that Im correct, nor do I need a foolish person to support or believe me when I am sticking up for someone... you calling me toxic is just hilarious at this point. Again, who was even talking to you in the first place? This was initially a response to something rude that someone else said lmao and you just kind jumped out of the woodwork.
---
Accept the fact that this is not a matter of opinions or anything like that, you are just wrong lmao. I dont need to be worked up or mad to point that out, either!
---
No, I didn't want the stuff in the bags, just wondered if the missing bag fix still worked since there were two separate bags for me.
---
If others still get a single bag, only thing I can think of is someone looked inside the first bag before I dropped the second.
---
"This is not a valid of sensible comparison" 
---
Im not denying fallout 76 has bugs. Im saying that problems you stated are no where near as bad as they were. This game has seen major improvments and that is a fact.
---
I suppose a furious rolling pin would work.....eventually
---
Neither do I, and I really hope you don't use this way of thinking on people in your life.
---
Yep - same as me. When my deathclaw is doing like 1700 damage and I can't kill a level 1 ghoul in flatwoods...
---
I harvested them occasionally and the mothman very regularly appeared at my house before the event with him started. Like 5-7 times a week AT MY HOUSE. Thats not him in the field too, just visiting.
---
I 76th this
---
What time? I’d like to join!
---
I still can't do it. I just go a few inches in the air
---
Do you have to claim workshop to use fusion core resource at power plants.? That’s the only resource generator I care about, I assume you do to build generators to power the thing?
---
Lol i doubt it’ll top a legendary Gatling gun😂
---
I hear X-01 power armor would make a great Segway
---
Yeah why is this such a hard concept for Bethesda.  Make uniques actually look unique.
---
I can't see what you're arguing here, there's no lore reason to do the (assuming you mean imposter) sheepsquatch more than once.
---
And there's also no real loot reason to play imposter sheepsquatch once you've got all its unique drops (the resource-use-to-reward is too high).
---
You claimed tbat it was never as bad as people claimed in the first place, but youre also saying that it improved majorly over time. Those are 2 contradictory statements, which is it? Was it not nearly as bad from the get go, or did it improve majorly over time? 
---
Also, how does that quote from a completely unrelated comment apply to this? Are ya'll okay????????
---
It's because it's not supposed to be a 'new quest', but more of a random event that you stumble upon when you're wandering around, like the Mistress of Mystery quest line. They don't want everybody to go to the same place and finish it all together right away.
---
When i get full, i bring up the gallery, use my phone to photograph the old ones then delete them. That way at least u get to keep them.
---
I don't think many people would have done what you did.
---
Got a picture of the queen 6 times and it didn’t give me the quest reward thing
---
Excavator actually let's you pick up about 4x as much ore.. and there's iron deposits in the same area, which should supply plenty of steel. Acid is the only thing you need a bunch of, either for the ore, or to make gunpowder with acid+paper.
---
Plus there's still that glitch where switching servers or server hopping while wearing full excavator's gives you an extra 100lb carry weight..
---
If you're 1 shot killing a SBQ tell the rest of the class your secrets.
---
This is pretty much what I do unless it is for a quest
---
I get that, before this issue and the “one-shot” nerf, I was an advocate to nerfing unarmed damage by 5-10% to bring it more inline with the other melee classes. Now the entire class of melee is kinda screwed
---
Wasn’t aware of that, so drop all my normal stuff save for my hammer and go mining for a few hours. Sounds like Minecraft XD
---
Not in West Virginia. It’s probably a groundhog. Prairie dogs would likely be shown like the Pokémon Dugtrio; because they live in such big communities.
---
I like the idea of the machines at whitesprings, but I also want to build a trading post. It should honestly be at both places at the same time. If someone is using the machine it shows up as "busy". I think it would be nice to only have to travel to 1 location (Whitesprings) if I'm short on time. Other times I would love to chill at my camp and wait for customers.  This will be a great time to have items in the vending machine and trade in the traditional way.
---
It feels like the community is divided in two on the issue of underarmour vs. outfits.
---
It seems to me that a good way to fix this would be to allow players to swap whether it is over / under the actual armor at the cost of caps or mats and perhaps looking dumb with clipping for some choices.
---
One of the biggest mods for F3/4 was just unlocking the full clothing choices in game. I think they should take a page from that book.
---
It took my a lot longer than 20 hours to complete this game because i wasnt just doing quest after quest, this can be said with any game, if you just do all the missions you hammer through it in no time, currently i have over 500 hours in game so its not like theres nothing to do
---
I like bridge camps, they can be fun to build. Looked at this place a few times. Good job.
---
I want to see some air streams rolled out!
---
..but will players be immune from damage FROM camps? Otherwise there's likely to be some deadly traps.
---
Action men, shmaction men.  I'll take my own route.
---
Let us free fly when building camp. 
---
The mode already just feels like an editor mode, there's no real immersion to argue against, what with whole objects instantly appearing. 
---
Being limited to a player body movement with gravity just makes it feel like an editor with a broken interface.
---
Free fly would make it much less frustrating to build.
---
You might want to let the developers know first.
---
Ok, but that wont help someone killing you unless you stay in sneak while in chameleon. People can kill you anywhere on the map. So if you see literally anyone else in the game you just bounce?
---
I remember the first time it hit that stash box!  Tons of great loot!
---
Honestly if I get 100 hours in the game I'm well satisfied with the content. I got my 60 bucks worth. If I'm complaining about needing stuff to do it's cause the game is fun enough I want more so obviously it gave me a good time too.
---
Google loss meme
---
The game was not the steaming pile of shit people claimed it was but it had exploits and glitches like the ones I said were fixed. The game had problems and has seen some major improvments over time. 
---
Man I'm doing great getting all this salt!!!
---
Yes just make sure they are close to each other and on the top right of the camera should indicate what’s being focused
---
I have a TSE Gauss I diddnt even realise it was so rare lol
---
It really is frustrating, brother, I understand your pain lol
---
Biggest pain is to keep 5.56 ammo for hungry handmade. If i had automatic variant, oh my god. No way.
---
I never even thought about the nukes until you mentioned it. I do alot of my stuff towards the south, about the max I spend to fast travel is around 35 caps or so, if I'm going to the forest I'll travel to vault 76 and go from there. 
---
I seen a group of guys there not too long ago destroying someone's camp just up the ridge from blackwater by the billboard. All 3 of them were wanted, they were leveling this guys camp. I just watched from a distance, but I'm glad I never moved there lol.
---
Hmm, the last time I checked / posted about it, it was working. I am going to try again after work just to confirm. Don't want to keep telling people about it if its not working anymore. I know if you fast travel or hit a loadscreen it doesn't work anymore, if needs to be a "fresh" dropped bag.
---
You got me there, lol.  Not 1-shotting the SBQ.  I did try to solo her the other night because no one showed after I nuked the Prime Fissure.  Know what I got for my attempt?  I was looking up and shooting at her, and trying to dodge her sonic breath, and I ran right into a fissure.  Goodbye sweet loot bag.  Goodbye forever.  &lt;hangs head&gt;
---
Just need to find some players that like playing as a team. Once you find a few good eggs the experience is much better.
---
Thank you for the laugh, and sorry.
---
I usually find dead alpha deathclaws beside fissure sites actually. They are very common or atleast for me
---
No one is salty lmaooooo like why do yall do this!!!!! No one is mad, salty or toxic like yall are the ones trying to make someone feel shitty for wanting a DISCOUNT as if that ISNT the real toxicity... like maybe they are poor, maybe they are not doing so well like what the fuck people!!!!! 
---
They want to play the game that you like so much, but its worth it to try and drag then down, because them saying they want a discount makes it seem like they dont "respect" the people who paid full price?? Get real!!!!!!!!!!
---
You are most welcome!!!
---
Also something the high level players should realize:  When they prevent the other players from getting a hit, they prevent a bunch of Legendary Weapons from being generated in the game (that they themselves may want to buy / trade of the low levels).  Some of my best weapons / armor come from my helping a few low levels get loot from kills (which really costs me nothing to let them get the XP / Loot) , so when they 1-shot enemies they are really hurting themselves as well as you....
---
Example 1:  Selfish high level 1 shot kills everything and gets a couple Legendary items (leaving the other players disappointed)
---
Example 2: Smart high level lets the 3 other players get hits on the enemies (or invites them to a team) and they collectively get 10+ Legendary items (and a bunch of XP) and then they trade / exchange stuff so everyone walks away a bit better off (and much happier)
---
If they get lucky and get a particularly valuable item, I will also hook them up with other players who buy/sell stuff, as its a win-win-win (they get caps or trade for cool stuff they want / Vendor friend gets more cool stuff to sell/trade / I get to help out 2 people and it costs me nothing)
---
I had a hard time with a mole rat
---
Were you spam scrapping items shortly before you lost it? It would be nice if we can confirm that this is why people are losing stuff because it's easy enough to protect yourself against until it gets patched.
---
6PM-6:30PM Pacific, each player throws in 100 caps, highest score on a submitted screenshot takes the pot and becomes the first Zeta Invader champion of post-war Appalachia.
---
My IGN is the same, I would suggest friending me and getting on the server prior to start.
---
My camp is the place!
---
The TS effect gives the gun a horrible accuracy vs any other Primary effect.  The explosive effect however, does the exact opposite.  It keeps the pellets in a tighter grouping for much longer.  Changing the gun into a mid range beast.  Combat shotguns tend to be the least accurate overall.  A pump explosive (anything but TS) can do one hit kills on 68 super mutants from the visibility range on console.
---
My votes on no
---
All this game is to me is a looting game, im obsessed with looting o even drop legendaries just to get more junk
---
Man I have 100+ hours into this game and I’m at level 88. That sound still gets me more often than not because I constantly have enemies running up on my camp. You’re not alone in that nor an idiot.
---
&gt; A lot of people have also gone to the marketplaces here and on Discord and bought nice legendary pieces.
---
Kind of defeats the purpose of playing if you ask me, but to each their own. I want to find/earn it. Just buying it takes all meaning from the accomplishment.
---
For me it's usually about how much time i get to spend with each character. 
---
Another thing that i find important is indeed the environmental story telling. Indeed bethesda is good at that but i don't feel that they quite managed to combine the 2. The most memorable moment in the whole main quest for me was when the overseer went to her old home. I was in her home, she was talking, i was in her room, it's more personal that way. Most other holotapes don't have such a powerful environment around them. 
---
Think tanks are better than Rose (and she is one of the best characters in Fo76) because you do get to spend more time with them, you get to know them, each of them has a different personality, you can help them, you see how they live now, if you want you can even go to that tiny village and find more about their backstories. 
---
Even the lightswitches AIs, or that toaster (i fucking loved him)... They had more personality than most of the characters in Fo76. They say and do things without actually progressing a story line. 
---
You spent time with all of those characters and you get to love them. In Fo76 we have Biv, you can just stay nearby and listen. He too has way more personality than some holotape person i'm supposed to care about. 
---
Even in real life, when you fall in love with someone you do it because of the little things that person does or says.
---
There is one inside the waste dump (name escapes me) near whitesprings. Seems to be a random high level death claw each time I go there. I always see one north of Watoga at the electrical substation as well.  This one is generally random as well.
---
Everybody here just needs to fucking relax. Turn the game off, go smoke a bowl, and think about how being the best at Fallout 76 is the least important thing in life. 
---
Go hug someone you care about. Then turn the game back on with fresh perspective. 
---
Have a good day!
---
Yep, if you want tons of ammo, go Minecraft! I usually capture the workshop in top left for the acid for a few hours before I do an epic ammo run like this.
---
This has really been affecting my game in a bad way, I am hoping it gets patched out on Tuesday
---
In the early days there used to always be three within a small area, one with a code, the others with just normal loot.
---
I just assumed the others were decoys, but given I can't seem to remember there being these groupings anymore maybe it was just a bug lol  (but then I don't really seek them out like I used to).
---
It's clearly our lord, Atom.
---
I don't care. I called him out for asking a stupid ass question and you done busted a vein in your forehead.
---
First time I’ve read a theory like this regarding the vendor.  Might be on to something hear.  When I heard them talk about tokens I immediately thought D3. Where a combination of tokens and caps would allow us to pick a legendary effect on one item and reroll it.  Never allowing us to pick multiple effects per item and each reroll becomes increasingly more expensive.  Adding a much needed cap sink to the game.
---
Yeah this is happening quite a bit across the board. It is really fun in survival...
---
Let's cook emote: check.
---
Puff puff pass :)
---
Startin'to sound a bit like Motor Ball in here :p
---
That makes sense, have a Vending Machine (somewhere other than your Camp at a common / marked area) and then Also be able to let all the players in the server know you are selling at your Camp
---
\- As selling some items (like 3 star Legendary) may require a bit of haggling, trading and drinking that a Vending machine would not satisfy
---
This is amazing, I've just got F76 and have literally no idea what I'm doing. Knowing this sort of build is possible makes me want to get out there and do something similar. Is there a subreddit for F76 base builds? Would be cool to see what other people have done too!
---
Xbox :-(
---
I have yet to find any paint plans
---
Ammo Smith + Super Duper = Your best friend
---
Its such a shame about how they priced those cards. I never see encrypted pop up anymore. It's one of the best fights in the game but the loot is almost always not worth 2k so nobody runs them
---
I have built in this exact same location that I have also spent a lot of time in. I get constant visits every time I’m there from the over eager neighbours but on the plus side there isn’t a hole to fall down as you walk past if I’m on your server!
---
Does it still do that? Believe it was event only.
---
I might take a break. I'm tired of getting known beverage recipes from Biv again and again and again
---
I've been knocked into the fissure a few times while looting close to the edge, your clutch bag is gone guuuurl
---
Calling people out for bullshit =/= mad or toxic
---
Again, nobody busted a vein in they forehead, it just was not a stupid ass question by any means and the fact that you thought that it was says some shit about you lmao but keep up the deflecting girl its a good look! 
---
I would say sorry for calling you out, but I'm... not lol.
---
They would kinda fit in with the aesthetics 👍🏼
---
They don't need to farm player for caps. I like to PVP, but never had to "farm" another player to make bank. 
---
I think you underestimate the power of endorphins. These people are hooked. Don't be an enabler!
---
Shit, was there a santa beard you could get during Christmas?? I need that.
---
RIP your junk. @-}-----
---
As far as I’ve seen that’s the one spot where it can’t be recovered. I have ran into situations where I couldn’t recover my stuff at a certain depth of water. Swimming has nothing to do with my situation. The other one I’ve had issues with was if I managed to die in a resource node. It doesn’t always happen but if you get it just right(wrong) it will select the node to loot and sometimes it won’t let you target the bag.
---
Well if yer on PC I’ve got maybe one you could have
---
Thank you for commenting re. the Energy Resistance.
---
Did some checking and you are right that in many cases the ER is lower than DR (Especially: Robots, Supermutants (except lower level), Moleminers and Deathclaws).
---
On animals it seems fairly balanced.
---
There are some enemies with higher ER than DR (for example: Ghouls, Scorched, insects)
---
Overall, the balance seems to be in favour of impact weapons (if all else is considered equal).  Also, it seems that energy ammo is less common (based on ammo distribution for my melee character).
---
Mainly, best is whatever good weapon RNG has bestowed upon you
---
They are dicks. Plain and simple.
---
Most of us high level players are pretty nice, btw.
---
Psh, it struggles to load if I sprint longer than 50 yards. I cant imagine how bad it would be, zipping around that fast. Still, I want it. 😆
---
Make sure you’re using the bottom springboard and standing near the back of it. You just want to use sort taps so you don’t drain your AP to fast. Play an instrument before you go :)
---
Don't be sorry you'd have to have done a good job first.
---
Maybe the new backpacks come with a lava floatie...
---
I guess I should have been more clear.
---
&gt;Though if Bethesda does record audio 
---
Then we can report Bethesda to police?
---
You would be perfectly okay for some game company to record all voip. Its a bit surpiring to me how little privacy is expected.
---
Follow the overseers quest.  It'll generally take you to areas with level appropriate enemies.
---
Stay in the forest until about L17.  
---
(Walk, dont fast travel.  You'l discover more)
---
morgantown airport (scorched), first aid items.
---
Gaully mine (scorched), coal
---
Wade airport (mutants), PA, other mats
---
Move north to Toxic valley around 20
---
Mid 20s, start the Western side of the divide.  
---
Start at path of the wind.  
---
Enemies here will spawn pending other players in the area - if you are getting L48 mutants, come back later, you'll get L6 scorched.
---
Top of the world. Same thing.  Roses quest will eventually take you to areas you are not quite ready for.  Take your time on this one.  Ditto the mysteries quest.  (Rewards will be better if you wait until L45 to compete both of those questlines.)
---
At L30, goto the ash heap and start on the excavator quest.  
---
It'll take you time to gather the materials you need.  If you have a good weapon and rad resistance, you should be able to deal with whitesrpings in a nuke zone.
---
At 40, you can do the rest of the divide, and at 45+, you should be able to venture into the easter side of the map.
---
Don’t let the few bad apples ruin it for you. Majority of the community is great, but there’s always a few idiots.  Yesterday I spent 2 hours in WS nuke zone and everyone was using the “come here” emote so everyone could hit the legendaries. I walked away with 30 of them, unfortunately they were all 1 Star.  I appreciated everyone working together.
---
On the opposite end, earlier I completed the free range event and had some little kid next to me squatting with chameleon armor and smacking me with melee trying to get my mutations to go off so he could kill me. Finally after 2 minutes I got annoyed and turned around to kill him. 
---
As I’m one swing away his buddy turns around and kills me with a Tesla rifle and loots all my junk. I go back to seek revenge and right as I’m about to kill the one, the other buddy turns around and kills me.  I was overencumbered and spec’d into melee so I stopped worrying about it. I just assumed they were 12 years old and went on about my day.
---
Worst I've had was 2x level 80 and 1x 60 scorch beasts + all their damned scorched that spawned IN MY BLOODY HOUSE. Luckily my PA didnt go back to inventory yet. Still did a number on my property though. This happens a few times a week but I'm geared to handle them then go hunt all their kin at all the fissures to teach a lesson.
---
Even then, the worst damage wasnt from them but from Vertibirds. They frequently fly past with nuke cards. Shooting them down sometimes causes them to crash INTO my house. I had one in my crafting area and another inside my living room....
---
That is one of the biggest oversights by bethesda, a shared stash would be huge.
---
Deal. Are you on now?
---
I had someone rob me after I found that box. Luckily my new haul had everything I needed!
---
I don’t think anyone but an absolute douche is going to flop it out and one shot everything in an event.   So, really, those people can’t be helped.  That’s just the bottom line.   
---
As for farming runs, If I’m running WS and a low level shows up I’m all about letting them get hits.   But, be polite, don’t hit me, don’t crowd me out, jump on me, or get in my way.  When we finish the club house don’t fiddle fuck around bc I’m hitting the next leg of the run.  Learn what you’re doing and I’ll be your personal Arthur Fonzarelli.  Act like an idiot and I’m leaving you.  I can only emote “follow me” so many times.  
---
Or at let’s say the Nightstalker event.  Two level 30s won’t stop playing instruments.  I’m getting over run so I go to a tse shotgun and start killing but still crippling a ton of ghouls.  I cripple the Wendingo and they get hits.  Then I get a message that I shouldn’t have not one shot everything as they are killing lots of cripples thanks to my shot shells?  Fuck that.  
---
It goes both ways Holmes.
---
Wo0o0owww so snappy and quick, what a gl0rious comeback! Back to the shadow realm with you, ya fuckin' feral imp
---
If I’m in a group/event, I will tag the target with a crappy pipe rifle to make sure I get a hit, then wait a few seconds to unleash hell. But if I’m alone, say doing a whitespring run, I tend to put myself in situations where I have a bunch of ghouls on me at once, so I don’t care if someone else is trying to grind legendaries. If I got there first, I’ll take everything I can, and it’s on them to try and keep up.
---
A++
---
If I wasn't lazy I might give you something more than an upvote.
---
Sorry man but you're mistaken. The pvp can take place anywhere on the server when you own a workshop. 
---
Im not trying to defend the pvp system in 76, it's just sooooo many people are confused on how pvp works in this game and end up frustrated.
---
The Giant Teapot, laying on picnic table
---
Good to know about the nodes - thank you.  It seems I'll have to start being more aware of where I'm dying.
---
Directly east of Harpers Ferry on the two train tracks that make a Y
---
If you aren't aggro I don't see an issue.
---
I’ve been hoping for a long time. It’s a bummer it’s taken this long
---
I'm the fastest disconnect in the wasteland and got no problem leaving a bag of junk behind.
---
Yeah - around level 25 or something my buddy and I encountered a level 20 Deathclaw or something. We were all a-twitter because we thought it would be an epic battle. 4 shotgun blasts and a ski sword swing brought him down.
---
What if we find out the enclave survivor is controlling them?
---
Very sporting of the fellow/lass. I hope the great wheel of karma is kind.
---
I'm in the same boat
---
Did all the quests, explored the whole map, did a lot of grinding. 
---
New content lasts about 3 days if I really invest in it. You can only kill the "new" sheepsquach so many times before it gets thrown in with the grinding category.
---
What do I do now? I fukin role play my ass off.
---
I was a mole ranger for a while, helping Jr campers build up their camp, give them goofy quests to go on for the best gear their level would allow.
---
Then I was a final boss, built a trap base on top of Seneca rocks, would server hop until another players camp was close enough to artillery. Rack up over 5k wanted bounty and rain mini nukes on anyone climbing the mountain to claim it.
---
Now I'm a wandering pirate, my camp is a ship. Sometimes I pvp, sometimes I help people. sometimes I go to workshops give the player all the known plans I have, a lot of gear and aid items, then smack the work bench to initiate PvP and kill them. Tell them not to trust pirates while I watch them bleed out...
---
"Squat n' Gobble"
---
I take it all the seats were japanese style floor toilets and you exclusively served spicy indian and taco bell fair?
---
Yeah think I’ve got all of them except the firecracker whiskey which isn’t available, so have stopped doing those too
---
That one at the substation is ALWAYS glowing, for me.
---
Are you talking about PA pieces, or PA plans?
---
OP is talking about plans.
---
Happens all of the time! And what I said about that small window of opportunity is absolutely true. Going against high level players in PvP, if this glitch happens it closes very quickly, getting melee players killed all the time! It’s bogus since it’s due to a new bug!
---
We’ve all done it with the fissure sites. Now I avoid them all together unless I’m looting the corpses around them.
---
It’s 2019. Personal accountability doesn’t exist.
---
That was an impressively stupid comment, I give you props for that, you get an update.
---
The Mire daily quests come to mind
---
True, but you have to deal with radiation and scorchbeasts.
---
More like:
---
Beep. 
---
Be*BLAM*
---
No.  I'll be on in an hour
---
It's not your fault man, they are all hardcore fanboys here versus the regular Fallout subreddit. They have gotten so much shit since release they are quite overly sensitive to anything you might say about F76 in the negative (even if its based in fact). I got bored just like you and so many others. A bunch of them are in utter denial.
---
Thanks pops!
---
Where is that car henge?
---
Where *your friend*, is dying, don't you mean?
---
Thank you future robot overlord.
---
It has to be atom store paint.
---
 I guess I'm not on the ban list. They are trying to fix my problem.
---
Borderlands isn't post apocolyptic. It is on a different planet that is run by corporations. 
---
Once again, care to point out what fo76 does that other games haven't done before?
---
I like this, but it's really a reference to this [diner in Bluffton SC](https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c6V6Yqz9MfUpvYNbQhLGfA/o.jpg) and just cannibalism in 76
---
It's still pretty rough trying to get piece plans from Distant Thunder, if I get a PA plan most times it's a PA mod plan, which isn't that great since those can just be purchased from vendors.
---
Pray to RNGesus I guess.
---
Prairie Dog / Gopher / Ground Rat 
---
Fun fact: they are cannibalistic and eat their dead (I have seen it with my own eyes)
---
I don't think you realize you can get 200+ caps a kill now... When you are maxed on the 1400 cap limit at the NPC's there is literally no faster way of earning caps in game.
---
You said you assume “most players who say there’s nothing left to do” skipped everything. I said I think there’s nothing left to do and I didn’t skip everything. Now you say “yeah but you’re an extreme example.” Or maybe your assumption is wrong?
---
Dam really
---
Doesn't matter, tons of P2W items are only temporary. That actually makes it even worse that you only get a boost for a short time.
---
If you don't mind me asking, how many hours in are you?
---
You never had to dupe or play 8 hours a day to amass 60k caps. In 1 week of vendor runs on two characters you can make 19600 caps. 1 week to make enough caps to almost max a character. And that’s not including all the caps you get from quests/enemies.
---
Doesn’t take a genius to realize with those simple numbers how easy it is to max caps a character and to amass even a full account maxed caps at 125k in 5-6 weeks or so.
---
You just sound like a lazy entitled whiny baby.
---
But that is just it, I was long done with the game well before 100 hours, which is why I forced myself to max caps on my entire account, and get every recipe in game.
---
Which is the overpriced one? The bazaar? From what I've seen the prices can be odd, but the lack of activity there is affecting price discovery so there's also very cheap stuff too.
---
The circle of stars on the right arm of the T-51 Tricentennial paint job matches that of the robots when you do Bots on Parade - you might be on to something
---
Yesterday I traveled back to my base to find a throng of Super Mutants. No big deal, it happens, usually it's Commie Bots but whatever. 
---
I have this thing win battle where I track "Second-to-last" enemy. "K, after this dude there is only one more." Every time I'd get to the second to last guy, more mutants would spawn in. And not level 5 base mutants - level 35 Butchers 42 bona-fide badasses.
---
I fought for about 10 minutes. The dust finally settled, I went to do some much needed repairs, walked down the stairs and who was there? 2 mutants and I heard their buddies in the distance.
---
It was the end of my session so I just said screw it and logged out.
---
Well don't hold your breath, we have no idea if this is even on Bethesda's list yet
---
If I just hammered them out yes. But I didn't hammer them out, I didn't rush them. Hell go watch MaTN play through the game, he finishes every single quest extremely quickly and he wasn't doing it quickly, he read every terminal and explored everywhere. Yet still was through it extremely quick.
---
*The jet will make you jittery. Guess she was right.*
---
Aww man :(
---
One of the more ridiculous oversights in this game.
---
I guess it just hasn't struck them as an apparent issue during the 45 total minutes of play-testing they've performed so far. Completely understandable.
---
Putting up walls wont really help if they are really wanting to be a jerk. I know many ways to slither around it with marsupial. Best bet...gets some high level friends. Most people who are gonna take a claim will be prepared to do anything for it. Unfortunately there are many pvp oriented players in this game.
---
In another comment you said you owned 4. If the other team claimed 1 then you still owned 3. The only to unclaim a workshop is by another player taking it from you or to leave that server. 
---
It's not a great system and BGS doesn't explain things very well but pvp is pretty easy avoidable by not taking workshops. In my 400 some hours I've only taken 3 workshops and i haven't had an experience like yours. Gotta play within the mechanics of the game. 
---
Long story short, don't want pvp then don't take worshops
---
Wait ! scrap my 1* rolling pins ? no way...
---
I think it may somehow track the times you have done it and it lowers the stars the more you do it. I solo the event and server hop 2 for 3 hrs a day, yes imon the spectrum, and I got a few good weapons the first day but now I'm about 100 or so kills in and it's religiously a ivl 1 if any. I'd say out of last 10 2 or 3 have just been a plan and the standard junk that some with him. It's still fun and super easy event so hopefully I can do something with these single star items when the legendary vendor is up.
---
For something a bit easier, particularly for lower level players:
---
With green thumb, it’s pretty easy to collect nearly 50 bloodleaf plants in the river around Flatwoods and northwards. Add 50 soot flowers and a whole lot of boiled water and there’s a bunch of healing salves to sell. Add chemist perk and superduper and that’s a big bunch of stuff to sell. With max hard bargain and grape mentats and mountain honey, they sell for 4 or 5 each which adds up pretty quick.
---
If you havent used them before, you might be suprised at how well the x\* vampire weapons perform.
---
I'm a 1H melee build, so I've got swing speed perks, etc....
---
A 1\* vampire machete (L20)  was my primary weapon from L20 to L50.  quite respectable in WS.  
---
Now @L74, alternating between a 1\* vampire switchblade (modded for serrated) and a plain L45 cultist dagger.  Either one shreds the golf club horde in very short order.
---
I'm on PC, unfortunately :(
---
Good point. Or at least the share mentality of a 12 year old.
---
The different is that the single-player games have replayability. Even if it only takes you 300 hours to complete the quest content in New Vegas for example, you can stack up another 300 playing through them again but choosing a different faction, and another 300 doing it again with a third.
---
The game is whatever it is to the players, this is one game you can't put a label on. You have to find your own fun, fun to you isn't always fun for others.
---
I don't even know. 100-120 maybe? I know I got the 76 hours challenge a little while ago.
---
If it was Bethesda it would to bad we arent working with them. Fuck gamestop, fuck think think geek.
---
I would be down with a New town (I think it should be Called "Barter Town") and even paying rent for a space for my Vending Machine (or even a small % of my sales revenue).
---
I agree that it would be harder to convince players to come to your Camp versus to a central hub, (who needs to spend their gaming time advertising "Come to My Camp for Best Deals" etc)
---
I'm going to add you also if you don't mind good sir. For the cunts of course.
---
Dude I think I was on that server with you!!
---
Try at the Sons of Dane compound. 3 mags spawn there. 1 just inside the gate on the left under the stairs/watchtower, 1 in the basement of the house up to the right of the gate and 1 inside the main building where all the instruments are.  So  long as you don't pick any of them up you can server hop till 1 of those 3 spawn as the one you need.
---
They might work OK when killing stuff from stealth with vats crits, but how do they do on sustained dps for something like the queen where stealth isn't an option?
---
First time I fell in a Fissure while fighting a SB, and not looking where I was going, second time was in a feeble attempt to retrieve my loot from the first, we won't talk about how many times it's happened since.
---
Rather have the choice.
---
Besides crafting it, I tend to see them (and other less common weapons) drop from wendigos.
---
So they are proposing that Vending machines will only be at our Camps?   
---
They should at least give players a choice of where to place it (at Camp or at pre-designated locations)
---
Lmao exactly! But if anyone who works there plays with melee, I’m sure they’ve experienced this!
---
I use a Bloody Deathclaw gauntlet and it takes a few hits due to the health regen so I doubt it. However when doing events like this in a group I prefer to use my combat knife which does less damage to make sure everyone gets a hit.
---
This is honestly what I was expecting with fo76.  A vast empty landscape with player organized and constructed towns.  Would be awesome!
---
If you don't mind me asking, how do we mod the handmade to be fully auto? Is it any mod that "improves fire rate? or something more specific?
---
Hey I wouldn't take anybody else's junk either and maybe I've been lucky but no-one has taken mine. 
---
I'm wondering if you asked to be revived. I don't I figure respawning would be quick and I don't expect to be revived anywhere else anyways. The event is chaotic so I don't think it's easy to notice a player go down and even less likely to find a bag DURING the event unless you asked to be revived.
---
Farm all the 3 star legendaries you can before purveyor is out =)
---
Can you get the larger (25 round) magazine as a mod on handmade? If so, I’m going to have to go scrap some more handmades.
---
I’d love to. I’m level 24 and would definitely want to team up! I would be interested in getting some plans with you too.
---
Never asked for a clip. If I asked for something it would be for you to remove the misinformation you’re trying to spread everywhere.
---
Go back to the drawing board and reevaluate your methods. Learn how actual scientific research is done, learn the difference between an assumption and actual fact. 
---
Yes I’m aware it’s a game but if you’re doing this type of research on it then the same methods apply.
---
I just enjoy shooting shit. I really liked using the nuke. Also, they didn't plan out too far. It's better than Red Dead and Bethesda seems committed to righting this ship and doing right by its players.
---
Ya I agree and i had 4 they took them all but honestly this is the first time I've ever had problems usually no one ever tries to take the workshops or kill me but trust me I'm not messing with them anymore haha
---
I think I'll wait for more tangible evidence. 
---
But, do you mean the enemy is not visually marked "legendary"? I've never seen enemies to become legendary while watching them.
---
Really? I run Uranium fever, pick everything up, and just the cooked meat alone is around 200 caps. I run this event at least 3-4 times a day easy. 
---
PVP is a gamble for the most part. You might be killed and lose your caps instead, or not. So you go after weaker players to give yourself better odds, but really you just need that hit. Surely attacking a high level player would yield more caps, but at higher risk. What it really comes down to is getting that hit of juicy brain chems the easiest way possible.
---
When it pays off, just like gambling, we get a shot of those addictive endorphins. And the sounds of caps being added to our bank? Slot machines payouts have that same effect.
---
In the end if it didn't make people feel good they wouldn't do it. This wouldn't be a game, it would literally be work.
---
yup bazaar, ive seen quite a few items end up over the 20k mark that would otherwise go in the 4-8k range
---
Wow, how original...
---
Thankfully dude was cool. That must've suuuucked. 😵
---
I thought that fav'ing the weapon would prevent this...I agree. WE NEED MORE PAINTS! I have come close to losing a great weapon in the manner more than once.
---
This happens to me all the time but what’s even nmore annoying is when I’m fighting the SBQ and I can’t get my crit meter to go off. I’ll have a full crit meter and start mashing triangle while I’m in bats and it won’t do anything at all. I have to drop vats before I can even swing my melee weapon .
---
Selling weapons and excess junk/chems I pick up along the way works for me. I suspect many folks sell serums now after the vendor changes. 
---
But, the fastest way I’ve made caps is by selling half-decent  legendaries from drops.
---
The main ways I do it now:
---
* Sell Chems and Purified Water.  You get tons of them from Events usually, notably One Violent Night.
---
* Sell Legendaries I come across and don't need.
---
* Sell guns from nearby battles.  This is easiest to do around Harper's Ferry.
---
* When all else fails, make a Mutation Serum.  They go for 500 a pop and I have a ton of flux taking up weight that I have no other use for.
---
Depends where you look. Most supermarkets have a full stack of fo76 for 59.99.
---
Go to fort defiance and pick up allllll of the straight jackets - they sell for like 50 caps to vendors with hard bargain x3 and there's a lot of them in there! Plus you can get a bunch of junk and sometimes legendaries in there from ghouls/wendigos.
---
 🤐
---
Good to hear they're trying to get you sorted.
---
Still planning on doing this?
---
I've only done the event about 6 times, and gotten two 3\* items from it, must be my lucky week, wait... Is a piece of wooden armor that lets you breath underwater worth anything?
---
Why at least give a reason when you make a post.
---
I believe if you can take a picture of a dead one, you can find them around Fissure sites (as the Scorchbeasts kill  them) like the one the Queen comes out of.
---
Yeah i put my camp there for 2 weeks. Made it super easy to pull her down the hill and rockets wrecked her. That said, maybe saw 4 summons
---
But then you know there are going to be THOSE PEOPLE who get a shit tone of spoiled items &amp; gift them to everyone on the server
---
I live in a (camper) van, down by the river!
---
How do you get serums without buying from the enclave?
---
this 
---
this right here
---
How do you make serums, do you need plans for them?
---
I'm in the same boat, there's no reward for missions or fighting anymore. How many more times will I run a SBQ only to have it fail or glitch? How many more 3 stars will Ill kill only to get a 1 star item? Jumping from vendor to vendor yields far greater rewards than any fight ever will and with the future "prestige level" or w/e they are doing whats the point in leveling up really high? I don't enjoy the fight anymore because there is no reward for it, it just leaves me with broken gear and no ammo.
---
Yep.
---
You don't have to be aggro to have an issue:

Ok, I've got 677 hours. In that time, I've never really done the whole "farm SBQ" or do the Golf course hundreds of times. I've done both, for certain, but I've never farmed them all day or anything.  I'm level 123. I'm not a min/maxer. I just play the game however I feel like playing it that day. Normally a shit ton of plastic runs, honestly.  My brother got a quad shotgun, and I loved that thing. Then I lost it to the Mama Dolce bug. I went to the forums to see if I could buy one, but was unable to. So I went back to using a non-legendary one, because that's all I could do.  About 20 levels ago I found the BEST legendary I've gotten the entire time,  a 1\* Vampire shotgun.
---
I can understand wanting to find everything "naturally", as that's literally what I did for over 600 hours. But at some point, you realize you can either spend 20 hours a week farming plastic....or you can go "holy shit that person has 3000 shotgun shells?!", and when you're at the cap cap, what's 3000 caps?  Or you've been trying to get the combination of mutations you want, but always end up with something really shitty, and darn it you just want that extra jump height? I've bought serums and bullets on the forums. I feel no shame in doing it, either. 
---
If you never buy anything, more power to you. That's great. But I'm playing a multiplayer game, that has other people that have stuff I want. I'm going to use it.
---
When I said no work, it was because the pathing around this area is very spotty, you can stand on top of the truck and he cant ht you with anything other than that quill chucking attack he does.
---
Yeezzzziiirrrrr , so long as you speak the truth and it's only for the cunts
---
People have amnesia about a built in game feature when it comes to fissures for some reason.  Stand on the edge, as close as you can to the bag of YOUR loot (this does nothing at all for someone else's loot) and drop a bullet.  Everything in the fissure bag will move to the bag you just dropped automatically as long as they're within about 15-20 feet of horizontal distance in the game.
---
No guarantees this will work but you could try dropping a piece of junk or ammo or whatever where you currently are and it *may* teleport the other bag to you.
---
I know that works with stuff you manually drop but I don't know if it's the same with death sacks.
---
Personally I prefer the semi auto. Between having to charge the charging one for full damage and a smaller mag requiring reloads more often I "feel" the semi does better dps over time. 
---
As others have said, I've noticed that the weapon does more damage if you reflect your shots rather than fire directly, though vats head shots especially with concentrated fire work great.
---
This is my favorite weapon. Shoot around corners, into rooms from outside them or do stuff like circle strafe an object to keep mobs off you while indirectly firing.
---
Mac's Farm would be the most reliable for that, my camp is nearby, and I see the whole family there very regularly.
---
Yeah, I would echo the whole "It goes both ways" thing.  If I say "Follow Me," I'm only going to take so many pot shots waiting for you to get over here.
---
Hard Bargain and Cap Collector maxed out are a must. You can pop a Grape Mentat too for better selling and buying prices at vendors.  Cap Collector will let you search cap stashes and I normally pick up double or more then what it usually holds. 
---
Pick up all the junk around the train station (don't scrap any of it) and sell it to the bot you can pull 30-40 caps worth if you clean one out. 
---
Bulk your junk to sell. They won't buy glass and bone scraps but if you bulk pack it, you can now sell it
---
But I lost a legendary chest armor, can't scrap that so any clues how it occurred. I'm sure it wasn't user error, I got this set come at lvl 78 and have played it to 248 so I find it hard to believe I just suddenly was dumb. 
---
Thanks op for posting this. Sad that our stuff is gone and nothing we can do.
---
It used to be that, the first time you fired, you only had as many rounds in the weapon as you had fusion/plasma cores.  You could reload to get access to the full 250 (more with certain legendaries) then fire like normal, but any time you switched weapons it’s go back to the core-based ammo number.
---
Now, you see the full 250, but it acts like the last round is fired first or something.  It’s so frustrating the number and variety of bugs they manage to get in this game...
---
Folks craft them. You can buy the recipe from someone or pay up the wazoo from the Enclave. The hardest mat to get is the flux. 
---
You could also buy serums directly from folks, then vendor them as long as folks are still selling under the vendors’ buying price. I currently vendor one at 460c.
---
I spent once about 30 mins trying to find a dead scorched near Sunrise field, because in heated situation I had accidentally placed my explosive shotgun on it. 
---
I knew the location pretty sure, but I had seen the body to drop into swamp/ditch water and there were some fauna in the water also.
---
It was quite pleasant that the body had remained, was targettable(sometimes they can be completely under fauna and can't be targetted), and that server had not kicked me out, neither the game had crashed. 
---
I mean spending 30 mins just to fish for a right pixel from a water you can't see through, isn't an overly great thing I enjoy Fallout 76 for, but still somehow being finally able to find it and get it back, it felt great.
---
I cam across that same battle and didn't know who to shoot to turn the tide. Turns out I needed to shoot the ants to help the DC, but they  were too skinny and I couldn't shoot them so we all died.
---

He did drop it

Or any other atom only thing.
---
&gt; The end result of this is that with the existing photos culled we just have enough space to delete a few, take a few when there are camera challenges to do.
---
No longer needed, I'm doing the bucket list quest and daily/weekly challenges with no storage left. I don't have room for more pics but using the Prosnap still counts, you get the Atoms and stuff.
---
Although I must say it feels very empty to get a really nice angle and take a pic that is not even going to be saved. I would love an increase to 100 or even 75.
---
If you are on ps4 i can mod for you if u want in about 8h
---
Yeah think I've get a supply drop twice.  Not very helpful

Man I have no idea. I have been to dozens of camps and never been attacked. I assume if someone wants vending machine action they won't have traps that kill the buyers. 
---
Thing will be out next week. We can all hitch and moan then. All speculation because they don't share much info.
---
I took a 3 mo break from fo76 and now that Im "back" Ive found playing just to play, and not trying to endgame anything is actually quite refreshing.  Its no different than replaying FO3/NV/4.
---
For instance, if you have played those and beat them you know exactly whats going to happen so whats the point of playing?  You play just to enjoy it.
---
I did two solo nuke launches the other day, and found myself not overly caring about what I encountered or if I "beat" it/them.  Just engaging in the environment and the content was enough, and yes there is content even if youve been there and done that.
---
lucky lucky lucky
---
When I see a small bounty I go to them and ask if they want it removed &amp; I wont take any junk they have on them. I don't unflag my pacifist mode unless they say yes.
---
even on X1 the tse gauss was heavily duped if you have DR on reload as 3rd star.  as people quit it will become more rare again
---
I'd like to see them add more outfits from Nuka World as well as the Handmade paints they had.
---
Just because someone has something you want doesn't mean they cheat or dupe. Some of us grind door days on end to get that magical item we want. So you can't do that, ok that's fair, but why the hate for someone else who does?cones off as really , nevermind.  
---
Btw. Don't get your hopes up about the vendor, it won't have the items you seek abd if it did bes would nerf them.
---
Can help w/ silo, already in your game just need team ivt.  Gt: Herbalxassassin
---
That's my understanding.  You will almost certainly need to go into your build menu to build it and to use the build menu you need to be in your camp. 
---
You can't fit a vending machine in your deep pocketed  armor can you ? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

“Soldier!!  Why aren’t you unloading you’re combat rifle into those approaching Commie Bastards?!”
---
“Sorry sir, but I just got done firing the mortar...... right sir, commencing fire!”
---
 - Fallout combat logic

Yup. About to now
---
This man speaks the truth!!!! Throw that math at him lol
---
Raider way is to PvP in survival and sell all the aid that tends to be dropped from players.  Normally just end up selling crap loads of aid.
---
Yeah. But I'm still overencumbered and have no idea on what to shed. In my stash gunpowder is no more that 300, fusion cores/missiles/nukes are about 5 each, only rare junk, adhesive/ballistic fiber/screws and no stashed aid. I do have some space but nowhere near how much I'm personally over. And of course the hidden problem with perk cards most of the stuff I have takes up less carry weight on me than it will in my stash.
---
And most planned builds aren’t finished til around level 55-65 anyhow because they require multiple level 49 and level 50 perks. You’re fine.
---
People can ask whatever they like, be mad at the people that pay the ask. Am I a dick because I try to get as much as I can for an item? You are right, I'll be a nice guy and sell you stuff for the price YOU want to pay. Stop being a spoiled child.
---
Hey man, did you ever figure out what was going on? My characters are looking exactly like that today.
---
Don't they have to contest to kill you first ? But yes pretty much if they hostile at the workshop I bounce. I use my low level character, so I stand zero chance anyway, even if I get 1 fusion core it is worth my 25 caps .. I rarely have anyone contesting, but it does happen, normally I am well into my 20-30 fusion cores and that's even if any contests, normally I get bored, but I have had people show up when I am not paying attention .. worst case is they kill me and get around 20-30 caps ..
---
I personally have my inventory ordered by damage for weapons and armor, then aid items  by spoil, and rest by weight. In stash and vendor I usually have weight order.
---
Sometimes when I sell for example large amount of crafted clothes, I use the alphabetical order as several other thinsg have weight of 0.1 as well so the list jumps a bit if I use weight sorting, with alphabetical it's more stable.
---
So they can fit easily into the boundary
---
Your friend is fooked.
---
You could kill a Hermit Crab and take some photos near it. Maybe from the back so you can't see the rotting crustacean inside.
---
Yeah I ended up buying the Christmas bundle back in December. But this beard has been a staple in my Master Roshi cosplay.
---
Nice story! Zz prefix will half errors. Fallout community is the finest.
---
That's my guess. There is just no circumstance where you would bother making it in a game like this and not, some way some how, releasing it.
---
You have to do blueprints in sections. 
---
Lay down a foundation first. Blueprint.
---
Walls/decorations, ceilings and power  conduits, doors/windows. Blueprint.
---
Easier that way.
---
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS!!  Can't tell you how many times my loot bag has teleported around The Whitespring Station, following me like a puppy while I stagger around sorting my junk.  Yeah, you're right, lol - start fighting the SBQ and I entirely forgot.  THANK YOU!
---
This is a huge improvement; I have a lot of sets and managing them was near impossible. Yes, glad they listened.
---
It's way up at the top of the map. East of the Munitions factory.
---
I did this and it worked, thanks for the help!
---
I stopped taking workshops a long time ago.
---
Once I learned most of the PA spawn points, I stsrted farming them as part of the routine.
---
On a good day, some of the spawn points have up to 5 cores.  
---
I have batteries incuded and other weight reduction perks, so the core wieght is 0.3, and I dont care if some of them are 25%, they still work, and last me a good while.
---
Havent taken a workshop since, and I have plenty of cores.
---
my god im so tired of people on the internet
---
did i once ever say " because someone has something I want it means they cheat or dupe"
---
ill wait while you reread what i actually wrote.
---
ok?
---
ok.
---
The fact is the market was ruined by dupers and cheaters, this is fact, verified by Bethesda.
---
the fact is people are charging 60,000 caps for things.  Never said i wanted those things.  
---
I know facts are hard on the internet, but you'll be ok
---
Yeah in hindsight that comment wasn't worth posting
---
No problem, happy to hear it worked.
---
I only claim them for the atom challenges. As soon as I claim it, I log out and switch servers.
---
This is what I do as well. It makes it easier to figure out what armor I actually wear when I am in my PA as well.
---
Well that sucked

I don’t use VATS but I’ve been melee since I walked out the Vault in BETA, we’ve been nerfed (whilst others have guns that can whittle you down whilst you approach) - I’m on PlayStation 4 but I was streaming and playing today and I encountered this. My build relies on getting in fast, delivering hits and getting out. I did think it was sever lag to be honest, as I’ve died at WhiteSpring, then had a ghoul die next to me. Once I respawned the body was a good distance away! 
---
It’s an absurd mess they needs fixing fast. But avoid VATS for the most part. It makes things ten times worse!
---
Actually, unless it has been patched this does not work, never has. A death bag is different to a dropped loot bag. Dropping loot in the vicinity of your death bag will create an entirely new bag.
---
This is exactly how it works on ps4 and its really frustrating.
---
On a $60 computer game. Good luck with that.
---
I have a twoshot handmade.  Are they any good?  it's sitting in my  stash waiting for the legendary vendor
---
The best part is that it’s not a patched one so you get the full resistance.
---
Does this mean you can't paint individual pieces to mix and match?  It's all this or nothing?
---
I feel you.  I spend 50 % of my time ingame building
---
How about Dual Wield as a compromise?  
---
Having 2 X handguns /  sub-machine guns /  Auto Shotguns / 1-handed weapons =  fun times!!
---
I'd rather have the ability to display only the items I am wiling to trade, not open my entire inventory for perusal.   Or new tab called Trade, where I can put said items, and thats the only one a 'trading player' can see/access.
---
Agreed - everyone wants to justify these folks as doing for caps, but listening to open comms reveals that 99 times out of 100 they are 1 bleaters or neckbeards getting their jollies.
---
Well said!
---
I didn't get into them until I hit lvl 75-80 (I'm at 112 now) Most all of my weapons are 1\* and thats it (I have one 3\* knife). I just sell all the armor I pick up because I'm a PA user and it dose't work in PA and most of the legendary weapons don't work with my build.
---
Marine helmets, the one with the bug eyes. I get 28 per at each vendor.
---
&gt; I'm playing a multiplayer game, that has other people that have stuff I want. I'm going to use it.
---
And that's fantastic. I didn't intend to pass judgement, just saying I don't really get it. But I don't need to get it, everyone should enjoy playing the way they want. I may get to that same point myself, but for now I'm just playing and figuring things out seeing what happens.
---
I honestly don't know how far I'll get though. I love the Fallout world, but once I've done everything (or enough that the fun is waning) in Fallout 76, I'll be done with it and move on to something else. I have plenty of other games to play. I don't see grinding for grinding's sake and don't see the need for better and better weapons/armor once I've experienced pretty much all the content. But for those that do and enjoy it (I saw a level 335 recently, wow), power to them.
---
I just lost my mutation in a decontamination shower even though I had Starched Genes 2 equipped.  That's not happened before, though it's been a couple months since I played this character.  I've taken countless showers before this.
---
If you’re looking for the same burst as a Explosive Shotgun in an explosive rifle you are 100% gonna be disappointed.  I run BE IE AAE PA build shotgunner. I one shot everything, including mirelurker queens when I have Adrenaline procd.
---
I also have a AAE Handmade rifler, the Damage is vastly different when I do Wes Tek runs between the two toons.  I rarely one shot anyone on the rifler, it happens but it’s rarer.
---
If you go into a longer sustained damage on a target like SBQ, your semi autos and autos begin to catch up to shotgunners.
---
The explosive effect on shotguns makes them over powdered (even after the nerf)
---
Great Idea
---
\- and for those more mischievous players, perhaps it can contain a live grenade?
---
Are you using concentrated fire and aiming at the head? Rifles are all about precision.
---
yes - yes, we know you want to justify crappy behavior like this as driven by Beth's cap patch - you've posted the same rot at least times in the thread already - give it a rest.  This kind of behavior was happening long before the cap patch and is driven by yoyos just getting their jollies.
---
I put on the clown costume and Faschnact Man Mask and run around firing mini nukes at Brahmin in Flatwoods.

*A class action lawsuit occurs when a large group of people suffer a loss or have a broken end user agreement due to the same company or product. The actual damage to each person is usually so small it wouldn't be worth their time or money to sue individually. But when they form a class, the suit often is worth millions of dollars.*
---
I think they should implement the same thing they did for scrapping favorites weapons. A sort of ‘confirm if you want to drop this item’ warning. This would fix a lot of stuff
---
Yes, there’s also Monongah.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Monongah_power_plant
---
Yeah, I've just got two levels of ammo smith (not quite at super duper level yet) and it's seriously one of the best perks in the game. Prior to that, I could barely use it due to ammo expense. It was a modded hunting rifle I had to use up til then.
---
Unpopular fact of the game: workshops are PVP zones. Do not take one if you do not want someone knocking down your door.
---
Aside from one exploit in particular, PVP requires both sides to consent. Slap damage is consent. Wanted status is automatic consent to everyone on the server. Workshops are consent. By taking a workshop, you are opting into the PVP aspect of the game. 
---
And here is where the disagreements will come from: do not take workshops if you wish to avoid PVP.
---
Lost my 90% weight reduction anti armor grognak axe through a vendor a while back. It was enough to drive me away from the game, since I dont have a single other weapon that compares. Was my baby, I was so happy to have it.
---
Me too. I found that if you're shooting gophers and come back to a place where you've already killed a couple, you can come back in a few minutes with a shotgun and take out quite a few of the recently deceased's palls with a single shell.
---
You don’t have to. Repairing the power plant gives you 400 electricity units which is more than enough to power the fusion core generator and anything else you could possibly want to build including resource extractors. It’s a power plant, after all. It also provides 100 electricity to nearby workshops with an electrical box. 
---
The cap payout for the event is pretty good too at 100 caps plus goodies.
---
Some ideas I see on here are fantastic. Most are "why"
---
Oof, that sounds pretty disappointing.
---
On my way!
---
Lol exactly. Add the ballistic weaving and it was decent protection too.
---
Westek was the real eye opener.  Jesus what a difference!
---
They may allow use to use the build menu at a designated Vending machine area (and only be able to build a single Vending machine) or simply have one spawn there for every player and you go there to load it with stuff and set prices etc.
---
I think they do, but there have been times where I either didn't notice the notification, or something. 
---
As I said, if I get that, I bounce. But I have been killed after getting a workshop, so maybe I either didn't see the notification, or something. I practically don't do workshops anymore, it's just too dangerous until they remove any kind of damage to CAMPs. I don't mind personally dying, whatever it's some caps or junk if I haven't scrapped in a minute. But when they follow you to your base and take out everything? Fuck that noise lol.
---
south of Summersville, on a bench
---
Today I learned something new, thank you. Although half the time I die in the fissure, I don’t even get the prompt to pick up my loot so I just assumed it was lost. Doesn’t happen often but sometimes when I’m shooting a scorchbeast in the sky and dodging his attacks I’ll stumble in there by accident.
---
Hand placing, I've worked up a process to export out the locations, icon type, and X-Y, but need to work through translating them over to pixel placement.

Something long term that's probably a better option than hand placing, but not sure the full effort yet

after a few cups of coffee, i start prairie doggin' too....\*rimshot\*

I used to let low levels ping enemies in whitesprings.  I'm more of a "If you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen" kinda guy...but I've feel sorry for plebs sometimes and let them in on the action...until one day I was taking my time through whitesprings, killing the ghouls while a lowly lvl 20 was shooting them with a peashooter.  
---
I was to the north of the 'spring, going through the bungalows and finishing up the last house (where the glowing one spawns) with a little buddy that was following me.  I'd take my time, let him shoot what he could, and finish them off.  We were making our way to the clubhouse (where the windego sometimes spawns) when I see a lvl 200 in power armor in the distance.  He saw us and ran straight to the clubhouse and killed every ghoul with his grognac axe before we could step through the doors...so yeah...that's why I don't help anymore.  
---
P.S.  There were about 4 legendaries in that mob........we didn't get any credit for...
---
Concentrated Fire is a vats perk?   Then no.  I rarely use vats.   I’m pumping CR exploding rounds into a Super mutants chest and they just keep ticking.
---
Yeah, I'm one of those weirdos that'll put thousands of hours into something I enjoy. So I'll probably stick with this for a long time.
---
I think character deletion is a hard pill to swallow for most.  I would like them to add ammo drops on death, like 10% of any ammo ur carrying would be cool with me and in line with many other past shooters.
---
The way my brother and I have been increasing the difficulty in survuval mode is by playing with the HUD off, on a new character of course.  It's amazing.  I'm actually reading and paying attention, following Clues and investigating rather than beeline to a magical point on the screen.  Using the map and landmarks to navigate since there's no compass.  Having to actually open a box to access it, fallout 3 style.  Not knowing I'm thirsty or starving until I hear the audio indicators.  
---
It's really fucking fun, and a challenge to be sure.  Give it a shot!
---
Added to the list
---
Oh I do. Fuck does that mean I’ve got a duped gun?
---
https://youtu.be/ol6p1kBCetk
---
However what if the Square doesn't favour the direction you want it in. If they made the perimeter rotatable that could be a lot of extra work for Bethesda *cough* and we all know what that means.
---
Someone much more fluent in Flash files could probably do it, but think it would be a significant project.
---
This is awesome man! Also, when he says Chally.. does it remind anyone else of Frank saying Charlie's name on IASIP?

Thanks a lot dude!

I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. Again, this does not work. You aren't the first person to suffer from this issue. There is no way to retrieve it.

I know this isn't really a viable solution for everyone, but the legendary quad harpoon gun has 0 delay between shots (until it needs to reload) , I have a quad explosive harpoon gun and can fire 4 shots in a second (which is a waste on most things).
---
This gun has really crappy durability though.
---
its a bit of a common bug, but idk if anyone has actually posted about it. ive fought a Glowing Mirelurk that was level 1 and was named "Radroach" several times
---
Get the vats perks and an instigating weapon and you're set
---
Maybe its a new thing. Like the imposter sheepsquatch the flatwoods monster is an alien maybe thats the imposter version ive never seen a purple gutsy before.
---
I had one yesterday that dropped 3 codes at once. I regretted picking them up because one of them kept popping up on the screen showing me I had picked it up every minute for the next hour. Must’ve been some kind of server glitch.
---
They are fairly rare. Just recently saw a non-legendary was it level 25 level with my level 53 alt, and realized I see them so extremely rarely with my level 180 main. I mean even generally they are rare but it got me to think maybe they are more common sight for mid level char, than high level.
---
I think I even see legendary assultron heads more often than level actions.
---
They are better, yes. They fire faster and I think reload faster too. 
---
If you use both pistol and rifle damage perks, 308 bolt-lock should be nicely better than hunting rifle. 
---
The bolt-lock is glitched in the sense that when configured as rifle, it benefits from both damage perks. It also helps that those damage perks are from uh, "different class" of perk. Say if the weapon has nominal damage of 100. If it's hunting rifle you can boost it 3x10% so it gives 130. (using level 1 rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman cards). If you use 3 more perks, it gives lesser increase per perk card. IIRC that the level 2 cards are 15%, so 6 specials would give you 3x15% increase, to 145 damage. But with bolt-lock, you get 3x10%+3x10% instead(3 level 1 rifle cards, 3 level 1 pistol cards), ==160. And since the nominal damage of hunting rifle and bolt-lock is very close, bolt-lock wins.
---
In practice you should only use level action once you can mod it well, which will take quite some time. But be sure to have eye out for any handy bolt-lock with nice legendary effect, as it can be pushed further than hunting rifle, with hunting rifle having little advantage over it.
---
Okay. So:
---
1) it doesn't matter that it's on a different planet. 
---
2) The story of Borderlands .... Indeed involves corporations..... Those corporations are vying for what? Tech/resources from the ruins of a now gone civilization that was wiped out by some cataclysmic event..... Which is pretty much the text book definition of Post Apocalyptic.
---
3) Even putting aside the argument of whether it's post apocalyptic, you can't argue that Borderlands doesn't take inspiration from post apocalyptic sources. The entire pool of baddies (aside from creatures) is clear cut Mad Max/Raider inspired. Go watch the NightRider bit in mad Max, look at the aesthetic of Lord Humongous, or look at Master Blaster in Thunder Dome, who is clearly, obviously the inspiration for RedBelly in borderlands. Just because Borderlands has a Space Cowboy thing going doesn't mean it didn't take heavily from post apocalyptic precursors. I mean.... Look at the vehicles....
---
Alot of Mad Maxiness in there. Which inspired much of Fallout.... Which leaked into many other games. 
---
And again, since you keep ignoring the point. I'm talking about Popularization from the perspective of the whole fallout franchise..... Not 76 doing it first..... You need to wrap your head around the difference.
---
why are you so angry with random people on the internet with whom you have differing opinions? are you like this in real life? or jsut when you are anonymous online?
---
good luck with all *that*
---
+karma nice job thanks
---
Super mutants are hella tanky to body shots. You can usually one or two shot them in the head, when body shots will take 5 or 6.
---
One of these days Bethesda will get around to fixing their game
---
You can have a higher level person make you excavator for you. I could do it I just need materials to make it

Lol we’ve all done this I feel

Only PA paints drop.

You really think "most players" have put in full-time job hours time investment?

---
That's assuming anyone ever comes by...
---
&gt; I've been to a live gameshow where the wrong answer got you killed
---
Cool idea, but...pretty much everyone has pacifist mode on.
---
76 is SERIOUSLY lacking in content. It’s sad. That’s why the players need to do their own thing.
---
Also if you’re taking about the new legendary trader, that’s actually to reduce the grind somewhat. Make it easier, not harder to get our dream weapons.
---
Are you on PS4? I drop roughly 10-15 legendaries on the ground every day. I’d for sure give them all to you if you want to add me.
---
Even below level 50 when you level up you can choose a new card that's not in the same category as the special point you added.
---
Thanks for the advice, I almost always run semi-auto weapons because I’m so stingy with ammo. When you say bolt-lock what weapon exactly are you talking about?
---
it's been brought up. Todd Howard talked about it a few weeks ago in those bethesda days where they talked a lot more about Rage 2. Iirc, he did mention they may do something about this but it wasnt set in stone.
---
Remove your mods, fixup your ini files 
---
And see if that helps
---
Sometimes it's unintentional and not malicious. I don't pay attention to the levels of people around me especially if they've come in when the event is half over. I also don't know if that lvl 20 player is their alt rocking a bloodied explosive double-barrel or a newb with a vanilla pipe pistol. If it's an event that can be easily failed, like Free Range, I'm not going to take a chance of failing it if you don't hurry up and get your hits in. I did Uranium Fever last night and used my weakest weapon which still took off 25% health off a legendary mole miner. Then I stopped and waited. And waited. No one else attacked it while it's standing there destroying the extractor. So I finished it off. I'm not a mind reader and I'm also playing for myself and not someone else. I'll make every reasonable attempt not to one-shot things, but I have no way of knowing when you've gotten your tag in or not and what your intentions are. Some people are oblivious to their surroundings and I can't predict that. I'm also competing with the people who maliciously one-shot things so I'm going to try to get mine in there as well. I've had times where I \*know\* I've tagged it and didn't get anything so that means the game thinks I didn't. So I overcompensate by hitting it a bunch. I'm level 121 and I don't have a single perfect weapon or armor for my build. I have 'good enough' stuff, but my dream pieces are still out there hidden by the RNG.  So please don't assume that everyone sucks that does this. It may just not be what you think. If I know there's someone tagging along that just wants to tag things, I will gladly make sure they do so, but most of the time, I don't even know they are there or what they are doing.
---
Look for somebody who got the crafting plan for "The Fixer" from the imposter Sheepsquatch event, of farm it for yourself. 
---
Two points higher base damage than the handmade. Great basic rifle for any stealth rifleman/commando.
---
Captainoob did a spotlight video on it, so see for yourself.
---
IKR!  I use an anti-armor handmade on SB's and it takes forever

Yeah as a shotgunner WT is cake.  Using the scrapper perk you can get enough plastic from scrapping the laser rifles, steel from the assault rifles and gun powder from their corpses to come out ammo positive each run.  You do need lead from another source but shells don’t take much lead thankfully.  I use to think two handed melee was over powdered till I made this bloody shotgunner, I’d never go back.
---
I've had something similar happen to me as well.  I was a much lower level, somewhere in the twenties I think, when three level 50 SBs started destroying my base.  Targeted attacks.  I built in a peaceful little area with no SB sightings anywhere near the place.  These three fuckers absolutely level my base then turn to me.  I server hop, rebuild my base, and three more SB come back to destroy it (and me) again.  Rage quit.  Turned off the system.  Turned it back on 20 minutes later.  Hear the flapping wings, more SB again.  Immediately turned off my system and didn't touch the game for a week.
---
How do I get the fusion cores once I take over the workshop?
---
I'd say instead of making the building area square (and possibly smaller to compensate), make our CAMP have a "soft" border that we can build into, as long as the object is placed partially inside the radius.
---
If you can find the plans for union or confederate uniforms, those are pretty low req recipes. I also farm Harper’s for all the assault rifles and lasers from Super Mutants. Those sell pretty well. Bulk all excess junk to sell.
---
Don’t leave us hanging. Who won?
---
I fell off a mountain like a fool, and my loot bag got stuck on an impossible cliff. I spent like 10 stimpaks falling down to get it, and just as I was on the last fall down, I just straight fell through the map, respawned like a mile away and got disconnected from the server. It was a disappointing half hour
---
I bought mine for 25k and a TSE Lever
---
Tis the price one pays for stupidity.
---
I may be on. Im usually on later
---
Make death claws great again.
---
It's more than likely this.
---
Rename your legendary weapons and put ZZ in front of them, that way they will always be at the bottom of your inventory when you open vendors or containers. I named all my weapons "ZZ 1 Gatling Gun" "ZZ 2 .50 Cal" etc.
---
Yes!
---
I only give ***jobs to other players.
---
\&gt;some items may require a bit of haggling...
---
Vending machine implies no haggle fixed price, and that the seller need not be present for the transaction.    Perhaps a bit 'safer' in that no worries about dropping paper bags, etc.
---
Personally, I do not want to spend one or more play sessions hanging around my machine just in case someone stops by wants to peruse.
---
Additionally, if machines are concentrated in one spot, its one stop shopping, and the resultant competition for 'business' may help "regulate" market price.  
---
e.g. As a seller, you want to know what the competition is selling at what price, so you will look at everyone elses offering and prices, an adjsut yours to be competitive.  because as a buyer, you want the best deal possible, so you will look at every machine before choosing - 
---
if two+ have the item you want, you will choose the lowest price for the item.
---
If yu want to haggle, then you can keep the item on you, and trade/offer just like you do now.
---
Where did you find the plans?
---
Then you're like me!  I use vats ALL the time.  I maxed out all my rifleman perks (I use a hunting rifle and a handmade rifle as my two main guns), the action girl card, and all other vats related cards.
---
Cheers!
---
Good info, cheers!

Let us choose square or circle...sell option in Atom Shop.

Thanks a lot!

Radscorps aren’t at the top of lists because they are relatively uncommon I’d wager.  I once had a radscorp attack at hemlock holes when I was lower level (20ish) and just left.  They wanted it more.
---
Unfortunately I am on PS4 :(
---
Well thank you ! I really do believe you guys are really nice 😊
---
wait until you start ducking every time you hear a wing flap....
---
Spy: perhaps they can bury you in that van you call home. 
---
Scout: It was a mercy kill...you live in a, camper van. 
---
Just what came to mind lol. Love the idea though.
---
Still there ?
---
Well I’m sorry you went through that. That I understand people getting frustrated because it’s childish to do those things!
---
I noticed the tricentenial paint for the torso and head actually match the default (enclave) x-01 perfectly.
---
Unfortunately I don't think anybody has really figured out why it does this, and it seems to spread across PC and consoles from some accounts I've read on here. 
---
My knee jerk reaction at this point is its probably server side, but I have absolutely no idea what I'm on about.
---
super mutants, mole miners, larger monsters all have a chance of dropping caps. alternatively you could go cap stash hunting with fortune finder and cap collector

Where do you live where 4 hr/day is a full time job?

They’re glass cannons. Extremely powerful, very squishy. Worth it in my opinion.
---
You'll need to find and start the fusion core processor. Once it starts producing, just need to walk up to it and take them like you any typical container with loot.
---
I think it requires something like 100 power. Which is why typically you'll want to do event to turn on power plant first, for the free power. Alternatively can build tons of generators or if you have the plans, a fusion core generator which generates 100 power. Note if you don't know the plans, it's a reward from powering up the power plant.
---
they do, but the increase in price is minimal, if it is worth it try to sell it to another player. otherwise just cram it into a vendor to throw it away.
---
Really nice!
---
yeah but I've met plenty of both those creatures before. This was a new model.
---
Yeah it’s weird. Hopefully people Bethesda confirms that the triccenal is. Because a lot of people were asking about faction stuff. I also waiting for them to release that BOS Sentinel paint
---
That's the truth though!  I collected a bunch of junk running around Watoga for maybe ten minutes before heading to the Scorched Earth event.  Then I probably spent 30 minutes walking around the fissure looking at my STOOPID brown bag in a puddle of molten ultracite from every possible angle, like things were going to change somehow.  Disappointing is right.
---
On PS4 I had an issue like this. Turns out having a large friends list makes you “stutter” every 30 seconds or so. Not sure if that helps. I keep mine under 100 now.
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
Try to get hold of 5 unyielding armor, and get your health under 20%. Now your charisma should be atleast 16. Then just sell bulked junk medicine etc. Ofc grape mentats help.
---
this has happened to me a few time recently this weekend on PS4
---
The 308 bolt-lock pipe.
---
I understand thank you so much for your input!!
---
Thank you bro. I know this post is 5 months+ old but I kept getting the problem today and sure enough your trick fixed it!
---
Sure am. Gonna be for 30 more minutes or so
---
I got my first 3\* a couple nights ago.
---
Executioners Rolling pin with normal executioners bonus, 40% swing speed increase, and +1 on one stat (I forget which one).
---
Actually has a respectable damage number, too :)
---
I don't know if you did the event yet, but I took a video of myself doing it (thinking of your post).  Hope you got your own shots however!
---
here are some pix: https://imgur.com/a/EyNjjVz
---
Unless you're sniping then rifles without vats is just gimping, you might as well try bashing things. It's all about headshots and crits. I prefer commando over rifleman but rarely go full auto. They've been hit quite hard with the nerfstick lately but I can still put most things down in a couple of shots.
---
here are some [pix: https://imgur.com/a/EyNjjVz
---
I don't think this is correct, though I'm going based on others comments and have not personally tested. 
---
It is a cylinder, not a sphere. So if you're one radius away from centre, the height you can build to is no different from if you're in the middle. I could be wrong, but my main goal for this game is a big castle, and all my research points to cylinder, not sphere.
---
....dude. that is actually the flatwoods monster. its an alien  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flatwoods\_monster](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flatwoods_monster)
---
Best Enclave event loot I got was a Enclave plasma rifle scope. Never even used/looked/applied it as I’m a melee build. Guess it’s a Camo or something?
---
I only realised the other day there's a dead megasloth at one too.
---
The hunting rifle bugs me as a right handed shooter, but I would love if we could choose which Hand is our characters dominant hand or allow us to have right and left handed receivers.
---
That looks really weird arent you sure u didnt do some game file changing? Some mods?
---
Been nearly 6 months now, anyone seen the canvas bag?
---
I like to read about people who are playing the game the way they want to.  I like to be in my camp, but I also like to sally forth and see what the wasteland throws at me.  As long as you are happy with what you are doing and aren't running around harassing people for no go reason , then there's nothing wrong, or sad about the way you play.  Scrap and build and horde to your hearts content fellow vault dweller.
---
on xbox - absolutely vanilla.
---
What are you talking about. Thats a lie. \*stares at Megaluigi\*
---
You need to be a reasonable high level to get something like a megasloth, because you need to be 20 levels or so higher than it. Partner is level 66 and megasloth is lvl 20, so was quite easy. You also need lvl 3 Animal Friend. 
---
Then you need to find one ... and it has to be a random spawn. There is a difference between pacify and tame ... you cannot tame unless it's a random spawn.
---
The place she found it was under the bridge to wear of the Big Bs rear stop in the Mire. Just below Harpers Ferry. Server hop until one appears, expect all sorts from scorched to a deathclaw or the Insult Bot. 
---
Then you need to get really close to it and Tame should pop up. For Pacify you look through the sight but Tame you just walk up to it. Once tamed there is an option to "send to camp". And off he goes!
---
In the train truck by Watoga Station.
---
I could see ripping off some robot part and jury rigging them to a set of t45. Imagine rolling on a robobrain tread. And firing off a sentry bot gun.
---
I think it was actually the flatwoods Monster, because a gutsy has one central jet while the flatwoods Monster has two of I recall correctly.
---
Jeeeesus Christ, this kid is an idiot!
---
I checked there, but no plans spawns let alone the helmet.
---
The range isn't enough for scorchbeasts unless they are close-by when in the air, I was doing about 1/3 of its health bar when I tested it earlier, and 1/2 for a mirelurk queen, but I didn't have the covert operative perk and was about 30-40% of my total hp (with adrenal mutation). It oneshots  colonel gutsy's though even without the full 20 loaded.
---
The reload is slow though, about 20-30s for the full 20, so this is the major drawback with groups of larger enemies. If that was better I could use it more often. It's a pity there are no mods for it too.
---
oh fn hell - I was thinking Grafton Monster and got confused. Well, I've seen the Flatwoods monster then. Go about your business good people. Just a man being an idiot over her.

The circle of stars is from the in-universe American flag: [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/7c/USA\_Flag\_Pre-War.png/revision/latest?cb=20140626091623](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/7c/USA_Flag_Pre-War.png/revision/latest?cb=20140626091623) / [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/United\_States](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/United_States)
---
The Enclave are descendants of the US Government, so they likely took inspiration from the Old World's flag for their own symbols: [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/07/Enclave\_Symbol\_%28FO3%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20131207122119](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/07/Enclave_Symbol_%28FO3%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20131207122119) / [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave)
---
Any time you spawn into a new area, it will take time for some of the loot to show up.  It's a lag issue.
---
I see it whenever I log into Whitespring.  As soon as my character renders in, I can move, but within a couple seconds I'll rubber band back to where I was (one time).  
---
At that point, I can run around, and loot the trash cans successfully, but no mobs are there, and anything that's not inside a random container (the clipboard on the pedestal, for instance) will show up, but you won't be able to interact with it.  This lasts anywhere from a couple seconds to half a minute or more, depending on how slow the server is (or your connection, or a dozen other factors).
---
Then, everything appears...or disappears.  The robots show up, and I can now loot the clipboard...unless it wasn't there really (someone else looted it, or it's still on cooldown from the last time I looted it), in which case it will vanish.  At the same time, certain other items will appear, like the bobby pin box inside the podium (any static, but not 100% guaranteed items).
---
That's the load order.  So, the weights you're looking for are on that second, static list.  They game assumes they're there, but you can't touch them until the game verifies their status, at which point you can either get them, or they vanish.  It just means you're getting to them before the server can tell your client whether they're really there or not.
---
Yes, I've spent *way* too much time staring at that stuff.
---
Yeah the last time I played weapon and armor durability was never a real issue. I quit because all I was doing was farming materials to make the several thousand bullets I'd need with my weapons for something like an SBQ fight.
---
Woah. Somewhere that I haven't seen before. That picture with the Deathclaw and you sitting down in that truck-chair. Where abouts is that? Would love to take a visit ahha. Awesome pictures man, you've made me a Fan of the picture mode. Might use it for the first time tonight because of these hah!
---
Could be worse kill it then it fly off along the ground then disappear's into the sunset.
---
Oh, okay maybe it happens then. Yeah I've never seen that, if going over the Atlantic, nearly everything happens with like 2 second delay, so I'll try to avoid it. Just see it when trading. Normal games just get 120-150 increease in ping for going to US server from Europe(with my connection), but Fallout 76 behaves quite different.
---
I've never seen them since, I've had a few marine related plans there though. It's the truck with the submachine gun spawn.
---
indeed. I was being thick. Thanks for the reply!
---
Very perceptive! I think this covers what happened to my Pearly Peepers. I don't often mass scrap weapons, but I'm going to keep a closer eye on it in future. Thanks!
---
lol - it was the flatwoods monster and I just didn't realise.
---
The killing around the map is an exploit. Don’t be a douchebag man.
---
The physics regarding that are difficult at best, plain suicidal at worst. It's not like it's D-Walker from MGSV
---
Are you on? I tried inviting you.
---
Very true. I didn’t mention him since he can be a little tough to find also.
---
Hop servers till Lewisburg spawns mutants, should be able to pull in maybe 500caps a run off weapons, plus there is a weapon stand in the north east of town. Summersville is another great Mutant weapon farming spot.
---
Just fired it up
---
You're asking waaaaay too much.
---
Ok ok ok that is hands down the cutest most adorable brahmin ive ever seen! Chally seems so happy i love it!
---
Smarty say: "great job!"
---
Personally I'm not a huge role playing and/or completionist, but if you think about who played fallout 1/2/3/4, for the longest, it wasn't people looking for a 3* bloodied tse penis pump. The game isn't made for those people, and I understand people being upset about that. The game is made for people who enjoy repetitive randomly generated quests. 
---
If you're looking for upgrades, loot, and progression, play warframe. (Honestly it is fantastic, if you have not played it, do yourself a favour) if you're looking for post apocalyptic dailies, roleplay opportunities, and mutant sheep, play fallout. 
---
I'm going to get downvotes for it, but that is what the game is. Like it or not.
---
Not sure why you got downvotes, this is a solid way to get cores as well as experience.
---
Yeah, I think I just need to keep server hoping
---
Which lighthouse?
---
Sorry you lost your weapon, but at least you had one to lose.  600 hrs. and lvl 211 and still haven't come across a TSE anything. Sorry about the sloth too.  I never had one of those either.
---
It’s due to performance limitations.
---
Land view. Is there another lighthouse?
---
Agreed. I don't know what percentage of people play entirely solo, but I would guess there are lots of people who don't have someone trustworthy to help them transfer items 24/7.
---
Next time I’m on, I’ll give my stash a check for any known plans 😊
---
Also try sneaking into other people's camps and taking everything from the stash box if they have one. This will give you access to all of the loot they have in their stash.
---
By following these tricks you'll have more stuff than you know what to do with in no time!
---
Ps4 here and i get terrible lag some servers. Was just in a sbq fight and i left because of it, not going to say unplayable but seriously not fun. Some servers i can barley run the lag is so bad but hopping worlds often helps.
---
Seems like a no brainer tbh. fo4 had plenty of prefab little shacks iirc.
---
a fallout lunch box?
---
But why would triccecental be a power armor then. ( I think it’s a canon power armor skin ) and with X01 the power armor is even more detailed with stars and everything.
---
I agree. With the way Fo76 is structured you’d think that would have been a thing long ago.
---
hey i agree, i get downvoted to hell when i say FO4 was a big step backwards for the role playing franchise into a more action based game
---
im glad they improved the gunplay but the lack of meaningful dialogue choices or other role playing aspects really was a disappointment
---
int he end, only Bethesda is to blame for this, it is they who decided to change direction with the FO franchise
---
Google the patch notes.
---
I’m not suggesting traps will be common, and most traps will probably be simple oubliettes; prisons you have to fast travel out of.
---
need that meme of History Channel guy saying " IT's ALIENS!"
---
Can you invite me to world? gt: TheFooly64
---
An easy way to get codes is through nukacrypt.com
---
Tameables don't just appear at your camp once tamed, they have to physically walk there, so it's best to follow them the entire way.
---
I got killed on a cooking station and couldn't retrieve my loot since it spawned in the cooking station
---
Not weird. As long as you're enjoying it, that's what matters. =)
---
Just sent it
---
Yeah defo, try the train yard next to it as well.
---
all 3 of them? BAHahaha, see what I did there?
---
I appreciate the offer, but I'm on Xbox.
---
grape mentats and high charisma rock
---
combined, they can double the sell price of some things
---
thats exactly the point, for those who haven't done it who kinda want the sheepsquatch rewards we're shit out of luck because everyone has done it already, and no one does it because the resource to reward is "not worth it". Its content / a funny questline that I dont get rewards for because its too challenging and not worth it.
---
You can look up the codes weekly, and you can launch a nuke from each silo. But is a cool down period you have to go through to launch again from each silo though.
---
Not sure how this game was before but I’ve just bought it and I think it may be the best Fallout yet for me. Great music, atmosphere, loot, multiplayer, lots to explore etc and the perk system is pretty intuitive.
---
Exactly!
---
Yikes it’s not self generated ?
---
Endgame? What endgame. Amirite? Hahaha.
---
When you level, you pick a special to increase, and you pick a perk. They do not have to be in the same category. The game defaults to showing you the perks from the special you picked, but you can pick any perk from any category that you are high enough level for. It is bad that the game doesn’t make this clear.
---
Just fill it with a massive amount of toxic water and punish the greedy ones with diseases
---
But how could anyone decipher the code before getting at least half of the letters to show up, which takes (insert some time frame I haven't figured out yet) from the weekly reset? Are there just 1-4 days where it's impossible to solve without the keyword, and no nukes are launched?
---
It’s easier for a attacker to one shot then a defender in most cases.  
---
A attacker can use sneak, crit, chems(boost dmg, all kinds of these), and types of food to boost dmg output to a insane high amount. Add this to a powerful weapon and build like a bloodied explosive for example a weapon can get up to a few thousand damn per shot for a brief duration of course.
---
There’s items as well to help put up a better dmg resistance and even block a percentage of in come attacks... you just have to take the time to know them and use em at the right time.
---
381hrs atm, went on a month or 2 hiatus
---
Very good thoughts. I also might not have the time to fast travel around the map to check all the machines.
---
And in the NW Forest.
---
well a real bad looter shooter in general.
---
But that site won't be able to solve the codes without the keywords, so I'm assuming for the first couple days you can't launch nukes?
---
😂😂
---
We getting sloshed boys
---
Hmmm. It used to always be legendary but that poor guy got nerfed early on.
---
The site linked on the other comment brute forces possible combinations with pieces you enter, but I have heard rumors of people pulling the codes from the dev room weekly which would explain why you see nukes happen after the weekly resets fairly quickly.
---
Well i will say that one bad experience out of the many times you took workshops shouldn't sway you completely off them, just need to change how you play a little. Next time try and stash your junk while you own a workshop and if someone contests it or kills you leave that server if you don't want to fight. 
---
Honestly tho i think there a way better uses of time to get resources other than workshops
---
The problem is the game isn't meant for anything past 50. Can't build a giant cool house or complete more quests. There is nothing to do besides farming rare weapons or helping newbies.
---
I was
---
There's only a certain set of drinks you can put in it
---
Yeah it wasn’t that he attacked me but that he did it after an event when I’m scrolling through my menus and perk cards. Me and one other guy herded the cows and he showed up at the end to tag the sheepsquatch.  When I finally engage him, I take off 70% of his health with one pole hook swing and his buddy steps in to save him. 
---
Not only that, but using chameleon and trying to melee me in order for me to get engaged in pvp when I’m not even moving is just sad imo. You know if his friend wasn’t there he wouldn’t try that. Oh well, 99% of my interactions in this game are positive experiences.
---
Oh, can you put cheap booze in it?
---
Just save up 8-10K and purchase another. Not worth quitting the game over man. 
---
I have a assassins one with swing speed I’ll give you for free if it helps you get back into the swing of things (pun intended)
---
Hopefully you’re on Xbox 🤞🏽
---
Such as? I genuinely want to know not being snarky!
---
No as far as I know the nuke codes are updated pretty quickly after the wipe each week
---
I do that as well. however they're catering this game more toward looty shooty instead of putting in actual shit to do. What do people mostly post about here? Getting legendaries. "So thats what we make of it now, we're looty shooty"
---
How about pistol builds
---
Yep. Lots of the legendary stuff does. 
---
I'm a more buffs and less nerfs bandwagon rider!
---
Just get a beserkers pistol after the buff
---
This is why I server hop when my workshops are contested. Not worth it.
---
Yeah Im having to make a new character for survival since my main is a melee. I have this same issue when attacking NPC enemies also.
---
What platform?
---
Wow that was a sick display of power!
---
Could you share an image of how you're geared and such I would like to have that kind of sickness!
---
:D
---
Innovsurvivalist made a video on 14 locations you can find the tourist if you're interested
---
 I'm sorry does the excavator armor yeld more resources from nodes?
---
Oh great, thanks!  I’ll send this to my friend whose looking.
---
Unless I get a god roll pistols are underpowered especially to that bloodied 2 shot explosive minigun
---
No problemo dude
---
Yeah since we want darker days too.  And darker desktop and darker atom shop and darker menus.  Except no.  We want darker nights.  Can't there be an in game slider for night darkness just so people can have a choice?
---
Resident Evil ISNT a post apocalyptic game though!!!
---
Yeah mine have been pretty positive I’ve had a douche person every now and then.  Thank you!
---
XB1. Sorry
---
I've been putting in limited amounts of alcohol (right now about 3 with a 1/3 chance of nukashine) because of 1 person being able to spam drink it all. I'd be OK with a per-person cooldown.
---
If you can buy it at a vendor and it's not stupid rare (X-01 shocks), you won't get a ton of money.
---
I found one after about 10 hops looking for shocks, and bought it because why not?  My luck isn't that good, so I'd assume they're not nearly as rare as other things.
---
Anti Armor, Instigating and Bloodied are still really strong on rifles.
---
I run an AA lever action and it rocks, just vats heads and you're good to go.
---
I have my camp on top of the underwater acid deposit, I didn't know that the evactuator could be placed on top of the acid deposit in the water and work.  My husband's camp is downhill from mine and he has the 3 brahams that hang out.
---
I've gotten the message saying that my camp can't be placed, but my husband's can.  We go there and it's empty and bare.
---
Looks close to tge real one did it shoot anything that made things glow?
---
Oh no, it certainly has been worth quitting the game over, in fact that's probably the least of the reasons to quit. We've just been spit on repeatedly by Bethesda since release, so my uninstall hasn't left me with any grief at all. After them actually going against their word and adding the repair kits, the game is remaining uninstalled, too. 
---
I appreciate the offer friend, and while i wouldn't necessarily take you up on it regardless, I'm on PS4.
---
Keep this up Appalachia, were rebuilding America... Let's work together
---
There's one on the wall behind a locked door (I think it's some kind of armory) in the ghoul section in Burrows. Not sure if it's a guaranteed spawn but I've been there a few times and it's there every time.
---
Ah gotcha, didn’t realize you had those other gripes as well lol
---
I definitely understand where you are coming from.
---
Haha thankyou!! Took a few tries but I think I got it looking enough like a brahmin eventually :D
---
I'll have to keep a close eye on how quickly the keywords repopulate I guess. I went to launch one last night, excited, only to see the nuke boards all completely blank. Kinda disheartening, and I ended up just roaming the map kicking rocks instead of launching a nuke.
---
Doing the same, just wandering around in the wasteland.
---
This. And character limit of 5.
---
I have:
---
1. Scientist. Dude with gorgeous mustaches from beta, but then realized intelligence has no real applications, and never played him again.
---
2. Cowboy girl. Leveling to 50 with pipe revolver is pure joy, but then revolvers are a big meh.
---
3. Jack of all trades. Mediocre drifter at best. Most player character and my main.
---
4. Endurance build. If you start leveling up gimps...
---
5. Bloodied melee. Secured my only left chance to meta, nothing else.
---
I need more slots! I have pending charisma build for unknown reasons.
---
Yeah they’re completely finished codes that you simply enter into the computer, I did it my first try and it worked perfectly
---
This is really cool.
---
Obviously collecting junk lol
---
i think its because you must be too young to remember that fallout and before that the wasteland game has been around since 1988, that is 31 years
---
Resident evil was introduced in 1996, 23 years ago
---
so the fallout/wasteland games predate RE by 8 years
---
AND Resident Evil is NOT A POST APOCALYPTIC GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It's called a 'bolt action' pipe rifle, and you can usually get them as drops from supermutants after you kill them.
---
Absolutely
---
SoonerAlum.
---
He's the only mutant in the whole game that actually has A TREAT FOR YOU.
---
I've only seen him a few times since beta, the insult bot on the other hand is my stalker.
---
Your better off finding a dead one at a fissure site. I tried server hopping the dam 10 times and I didn’t even see a single death law down that road. This is because this post has started a chain reaction of people server hopping this spot. 3 out of the 10 times I did server hop other people randomly spawned on the dam location hmmmmm I wonder why that is.
---
How much for handmade if you still have it
---
I’m sorry dude that really sucks. I’m always having issues during PvP fights but I know it happens for NPCs as well. It sucks for everyone. I hope it gets fixed for you soon!
---
I've noticed. Some dickhead tried attacking my workshop (not even to claim, he just wanted to PvP) and he couldn't die from my Executioner's Tesla Rifle. This shit sucks
---
it was pretty close. the level 8 mr. squeeze had a hard time but in the end he won. but he was so angry he wouldnt let us trade with him after the fight
---
The only 'end game' currently *is* grinding good loot. The game hasn't got much else to it.
---
let us make rat poisoned wine. drinking it kills you within 15 seconds.. unless you pop a disease cure
---
It really sucks for us melee users. 
---
I get the trade off of, no ammo but you’ve got to be close, but no one signed up for hits just not connecting sometimes.
---
For me, the worst part is that it hasn’t always been like this. The patch that added in the “one-shot nerf” ruined melees chances and it’s really quite awful
---
I only have the one weapon skin (The one for the lever rifle it is so *hnnnngh*) but if other paints also cost only one Oil then I don't think accidentally losing the paintjob it is such a big loss.
---
I’ve considered making a new character. But it’s really lame a new glitch that was added in a patch, has just ruined 1 of few classes of weapons available
---
The problem is, I'm not contesting cmf from Ash heap. Take it, but don't kill me. 7 times and take 80% of the caps I spent the last 5 hours grinding
---
Spheres have more area than a cube. We would have less building space mathematically speaking if they changed it.
---
I wondered this as well. I can't imagine nowadays that a picture takes up very much space. I could be wrong about that though.
---
It has to be a broken ProSnap Deluxe.
---
I've dropped loot in a shallow fissure before and was able to retrieve it by carefully scaling the side of it. It took a few tries but I was determined. Does not work with deep fissures unfortunately. Just make sure not to pick up any junk or your first loot bag with disappear if you die.
---
Makes me wish the sorting function went by whatever value you're checking, and then sort those alphabetically.
---
I guess this is basically about my rifle ignorance in general.  As a shotgunner I guess you can’t have it both ways.  So to really effectively use these guns I need ap refresh, vats, and crit perks eh??
---
I can't believe I didn't know this was a thing! Thank you for the details!
---
I was hoping for the same. This really killed the game for me. All I could think about was me and some friends building a small trading post and have a sense of community. Unfortunately they made the distance too far so you can’t build next to one another.  Once you build a base and max out you are just sitting there alone wondering what to do next.
---
I can't even use in game chat anymore. Every time I log in, the slider for chat volume is at zero. I turn it to 100 and can still barely hear anyone (with headset volume turned all the way up too). We have to go into PSN chat where I can hear everyone normally. This started about two or so weeks ago for me.
---
I believe the legendary vendor is an 'exchange' vendor, not a 'buff' vendor.
---
I know EXACTLY the spot--my CAMP (on PC) is right where the three brahmin hang out!  It's a popular area for reasons that should be clear without much explanation.  Takes me three or four times sometimes to get my CAMP placed...it's nice having neighbors from time to time though!
---
Thankyou!
---
u/valseek u/ladydevann
---
I already had everything in it.
---
Does the rads from the tunnel effect you much inside?
---
Have you tried closing the game completely and re-opening it? I had to do that for the easter eggs to show in the shop.
---
Build artillery...
---
I ran into a scorchbeast in the forest yesterday. Near the top left corner of the map. It wasn't aggro which is weird.
---
If you almost had a heat attack you should consult your doctor ASAP!
---
Site C2 in the cranberry bog
---
My buddy is having the same issue he did somehow manage to borrow another one of our friends cameras. Now that he’s given it back we went and got his on his alt and even finished the bucket list quest so it wouldn’t be a quest item. When he went to trade it to me it doesn’t pop up in his menu now though so idk what the fix is. :/
---
Might be a very bare-bones camp there.  Some folks do that and it isn't immediately obvious.  Drives me nuts.
---
They said before that had areas where players could "build together" has anyone figured out where these areas are at?
---
My friend puts in a bunch of beer and one nukashine\~ makes it more fun
---
It's not supposed to be a looter shooter, but when all the high level enemies are just unholy bullet sponges you tend to need some OP loot with which to shoot them.
---
Not to mention that VATS now seems to use more fusion core durability than before the last couple of patches as well. I'm burning through my cores every SBQ fight trying to melee crit. =( Sucks when your whole build gets nerfed by bugs.
---
Would be nice but...
---
Who gets flagged if  turrets from each camp start shooting at a mole rat in the garden hit the other camp's structures? hehehe
---
Try taking it all of then putting it back on
---
I keep getting teleported back to my launch zone whenever I get enough speed to go anywhere :c
---
That spot is pretty popular for the random event anyways. I had a legendary sheepsquatch spawn there with the updates.
---
I agree, but at the same time that would allow people to move out of the range and still allow their teammates to pick up resources without allowing others to claim it.
---
How about moving outside of the PVP range also surrenders the workshop when it turns off your PvP flag?
---
I messaged them and they said you should be able to buy another one from a vendor, but its bugged right now
---
Hopefully they fix it in the next patch
---
I have a sneaking suspicion they might do that somehow.
---
Well and old and lame trick, 1 friend will travel to your location, then the 2nd friend contests and then cancels the contest, so you won't even see a notification at all, this opens you up with pvp with them, they kill you and just do this over and over .. pretty lame and boring but hey whatever floats these chicken pussies boats to get a kick ...
---
It works though because my main is melee/support so its not super viable for survival anyway. Especially when you get V.A.T.S. headshotted after your melee attack doesnt register
---
Look at your map for their names. Then just find them under social &gt; recent.
---
You can rename basically any equipment that doesn’t stack (so no holotapes, no grenades).
---
Haven’t tried it with outfits though. I assume so, since they don’t stack anymore (they used to!)
---
I love your art so much! You did an amazing job! 
---
And I think I would never turn my radio off if we had Grahm's Trade Radio!
---
It's happening in PVE too. Against ghouls, mole rats, yao gui, etc. Definite bug.
---
It wasn't following her story....she was a main storyline but the bulk of it was going through each of the factions missions and learning what happened to all of them through those pieces until you got finally to the Enclave.
---
The first fissure site I went to had a dead alpha at it. The one right next to watoga.
---
I claimed the workshop twice and I've managed to get 20 100/100 cores out of it and since my workshops were stolen by jerks both times I think I'll keep some distance from workshops for a while. Could you tell me some PA spawn points? I'm not that familiar with them and I'd like to stay away from workshops like you.
---
Lots of barbell farming in the server,  The motel in Flatwoods,  Charleston Fie Department,  Hornwright Estate (has a private gym), the monorail elevator at the very top holding down the board walkways (also lots of concrete), the Penitentiary yard, and all 3 nuke silos, then finish it off at the Lucky hole mine for ore.  Another very over looked resource for lead is pencils.  They are all over the place in the game.
---
Everyone thinks they’re starring in their own movie, yeah.
---
Well they do have player vending coming next week I believe and the legendary vendor coming soon. Hopefully it becomes a lesser issue.
---
Part of the problem is that I find quality 1\* stuff that would be pretty good for a low level player. But they can't use it because it's max level. By the time you hit level 50 1\* stuff is generally not that great anymore.
---
its okay, scorch beast loot is commonly trash
---
that sounds like a great option to add if they went with the non-full map route.  in my other comment i mentioned using artillery range as a "pvp zone" around a workshop for an example. if you left that "artillery" zone you could get a 10 second timer like events give before you surrender the workshop and turns off pvp
---
Forget the powering up of plants. Server hop from NAR trainyard. There’s always a sentry bot and they always drop cores. If you find the level 60+ one it will be a fusion core between 50%-100%
---
Yeah, what price do they show as for you? I'm on PC.
---
I highly suggest for your bloody build you go with unyielding.. only 7 strength, yet 4 pieces bring me over 20. Charisma is beyond max for trading, intelligence is 34 for max durability and resistance when repairing.. everything is just bad ass. Carry weight of 340+ when really low health.. For me it's the build to end all builds.
---
You're a peach, thanks for this!
---
RIP fluffy, may your afterlife be filled with all the vaulters a monster could eat.
---
I love the sketch but for some reason I read this in Yoda’s voice...
---
Behold, the "Reverse Scully"...
---
Fallout 4 'kind of' had that with cement walls. They didn't want to give us cement house stuff in 76 for some reason though other than floor blocks and barricades.
---
Wht did you get
---
Nah, they added a standard receiver for the 50cal a few patches back, so thats fixed.
---
Thanks. I guess I’ll jump on the marketplace and see about an AA Handmade. Did they finally fix energy weapons? I wouldn’t mind one of those if they last more than two clips.
---
Was seen on live streams the day after patch.  You're not alone.
---
Yai definitely should have left sooner and I agree I usually just use them for extra stuff and fast traveling
---
Hahah fair point
---
What do you mean? If you have a cube with 10m size and a sphere with 10m diameter, you'll have more space with the cube.
---
This. And golf outfits from whitesprings. Plenty to find and good sell price.
---
Conan is free on PS4, and it's maybe one of a select few on the console that does anything remotely like this game.. and is does everything worse.
---
Story? What story? Lore? Nope. Base building almost anywhere, sure. As big as you want.
---
But here's the thing, I see where this game excels, some will enjoy things better on Fallout, others maybe Conan.. but it's console, and we don't have nearly as many choices. But we make do.
---
Your criticism is yours alone, let others enjoy games the way they want to.
---
Unyielding I would think atleast that’s what I run
---
Unyielding Sentinel
---
Full excavator PA: +100 carry weight (and minimum 10 str). 
---
Motion-assist torso: +2 str (10 carry weight)
---
Calibrated shocks: +50 carry weight per leg.
---
In total: +220 carry weight from modded excavator
---
You may be hitting jump too early or not standing far enough back. Make sure to let the trap throw you and then hit the jet pack :)
---
I honestly just get input lag in general sometimes I have to push the heal button twice or more to get it to work same with direct weapon switching
---
I’m burning through the cores like crazy. It’s funny because before they nerfed them I basically stayed in power armor 24/7 because I couldn’t use them fast enough. Now, I rarely have one to use and I usually save them for nuke zones. The STR perk that doesn’t take away energy when you sprint makes a huge difference for me in regards to how long they last.

What you are hearing is incorrect.  The team of people on the Appalachian Explorers Discord start collecting the code pieces as soon as the old ones expire, usually in the first hour all of the pieces are collected.  These are ran through the nukacrypt process and it returns all of the possible codes for each silo.  A few people go into the silo with hundreds of keycards and try each combo.  Once they they have the correct code and launch a nuke others take the code and confirm that the code is correct by launching nukes on other servers.  When the codes are confirmed twice the code gets posted on Nukacrypt.    
---
For example Alpha and Charlie were confirmed in about two hours after the old ones expired, Bravo had over 800 possible codes so they are waiting for Wednesday to gain more letters to reduce the number.  Because it is a brute force method they need lots of nuke key cards to crack them early.  If anyone has a surplus of key cards they should consider donating them to this team so they can keep providing us with the codes fast, otherwise the OP is correct that it would be Wednesday or Thursday before we had hope to have nuke launches.
---
I started a couple of weeks ago to help get the code pieces. and I plan to start farming for key cards at some point.
---
You're not going to like what I'm about to post. 
---
In terms of "massively" multiplayer online products, Fallout 76 stands alone as one of, if not THE easiest to conquer in terms of end game "progression". Players beat the first and final boss of the game a mere [day after the game's release](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096860/fallout-76-fissure-site-nuke-scorchbeast-queen-bethesda). This is unheard of. In terms of progression, it took the first WoW guild almost [6 MONTHS to clear](https://www.method.gg/raid-history) the end game progression dungeons.  
---
Bethesda has dug it's own hole with this one, I'm afraid. While the main quest line is engaging, and I did enjoy it very much, it is nominally brief for most players who are advancing through the game's pushover enemies and obstacles. No true teamwork is required, in fact the greatest form of "teamwork" you could identify in the early levels is devising ways to stay away from other people or mute them, as they grief and harass you in clown suits and masks in this "unforgiving desolate wasteland"...
---
So I don't really fault people for complaining on this front. They paid 69 bucks and in some cases more, for a relatively brief MMO experience that is now truly tapped out. No bosses to kill, no progression to be had, no true teamwork required for anything. You can do anything in the game solo, and I have even duo'd the Queen. And I am not by any means, a power gamer. 
---
So, take that as you will, but Bethesda did a great job with the atmosphere and especially the nuke effects, but damn did they drop the ball when it comes to teamwork, difficulty, endgame progression or lack thereof), and skill level.
---
Most likely all to appease the "give it to me now" Fortnite crowd who would likely not purchase the game if it required too much productive and constructive "social interaction" in order to accomplish tough tasks. Those kids of people just aren't team players. And this is a team game, damnit. Or it was supposed to be...
---
I use Unyielding but I hear some people like Bolstering?
---
Right on! Yeah I love taking pictures and with this camera update we had last week, I've been going crazy! But that picture is east of the munitions factory. Way up at the top of the map. Also fun fact, you can build there (;
---
I just upgraded my system and was wondering if my new cards were malfunctioning. I have no problems in other games, so I assumed it was FO76. It's nice to confirm that it's good ole Bethesda and not my pair of 2080s.
---
Regular beers that you can find in the world? Sadly no.
---
Awww, does it have to be brewed?
---
I’ve definitely done this (I think we all have)!  Mine was the Flatwoods RR...then I came across someone’s camp and thought I’d hit the jackpot. Then I got to my camp to discover my stash was empty 😮😂
---
Nope, so far I've only been able to put alcohol I've brewed into it.
---
Unyielding/Sent is also what I run with Bloodied Commando
---
*Someone* has to claim the shop. If a player takes the shop, powers up the core processor, and leaves it unlocked then anyone can take advantage of it. If that player leaves the game (and wasn't on a team) the processor stops working, even if it's still powered, until the shop is claimed again. 
---
If the power plant has been repaired you won't need to build generators, just look for the power boxes to attach to.
---
This just happened to me.. My photo gallery was full.. and without any updates or changes, overnight my gallery vanished. I was just playing last night with a full gallery and now it’s all gone.
---
When on a weapons workbench, you will notice there are several slots that can be selected. If you have nothing unlocked, you will see no other choices. You unlock various mods for weapons primarily through scrapping the weapon. Typically people will learn the plans to make the handmade, craft a ton of the lowest level versions, scrap them, and learn new mods.
---
I believe it is the receiver slot which decides fire type.
---
No
---
He always mentions he's looking for something.....I wonder what it is.
---
Along with this I would like to see more of the abandoned houses and buildings opened up. There are a few scattered across the map that have great locations.  They could clean up one of the lesser used towns and let players make it into a camp.
---
I always try to share kills with lower levels.  I know not everyone does, but a lot of us do. Lots of times it works out great for everyone.  They tag and I bag.  Everyone is happy.  I usually observe what's going on before I jump in and start helping though.  Not all low level players need or appreciate "help" and can get pretty belligerent sometimes if you are seen as taking their kills.
---
It happens to me in my pipboy and one time I randomly exited my stash
---
That would be cool - the assets are in game already so it wouldnt be too hard to do
---
I've only been able to put brewed drinks into it, except brewed "Beer".
---
I think it was the same patch that edited the loot table of the sbq to make certain plans more common and not drop the exact same legendary items as other legendary creatures, i forget which patch that was
---
Assassin's Combat Armour Chest Piece.  
---
Muffled Reinforced Combat Right Arm.
---
The rest is just Sheepsquatch stuff
---
This is also a great idea
---
It may be too difficult to code workshops and PVP to occur only at a set distance. We can all sit here and say, "hey just make it so we only take damage inside the boundaries", but we have no idea how easy or difficult that is to program.
---
🗿👌
---
This is absolutely not true. Every creature in the game you have to do a minimum % damage to get credit. Its a small enough number that it almost never becomes noticeable, but I’ve been in situations where I’ve noticed.
---
Energy weapons were fixed I believe. Good luck getting a good AA handmade...they're the meta now so if you do find one available for caps (most people will only do trades) you're looking to spend 10k-30k for a good one
---
How much bare bone can it be when the terrain isn't altered?
---
Would you mind sharing over DM?
---
I only know of the main two featured on YouTube and this Sub last week
---
I'll probably get down voted for this but
---
Why do you even need/want them it's way easier to just run around and take them off the frames is it not?  And you only ever need one and repair it
---
I got mine from treasure hunting. Get a bunch of treasure maps and spend a session or two hunting. I believe you are guaranteed a plan from them.
---
I ran it yesterday and only 3 people showed up. We failed.  There were a lot of high level players on the servers too. I'm going to announce on here next time so people actually show up.
---
You can find them on a locker shelf with some server hopping at Grafton Steel - got them just the other day.
---
Tyvm! +karma
---
The dovakiin is using the disarm shout on you.
---
He can be placated by dropping a few cheese wheels, first.
---
It’s not really a rumor, it’s true for every enemy. It’s a very small percentage so its almost never an issue, but the queen has a LOT of health, so it becomes more evident there. When I was leveling my stealth sniper a while back, i went into a Whiteseprings nuke with a basic unperked 10mm pistol with hopes of tagging ghouls. I wasn’t getting any credit/loot unless I either dumped the whole magazine into them, or switched to a .44 revolver or my rifle. Very clear that i had to do a minimum amount of damage.
---
I’m a simple man, I see Mothman, I kill Mothman.
---
I hope it makes it so that I can get the gear that I want for my build without needing to trade with others.
---
I attempted to make my first trade ever today for a piece of armor that isn't even in super high demand. Figured it'd be a quick meet up and swap type deal.......nope.......the guy I'm trading with wants me to take screenshots of the pieces I have to trade and upload them so that he can decide if they are up to par with his standards. I spent about 10 minutes trying to do this before I said forget this I don't need this one piece of armor that bad.
---
I keep losing my megasloth too! I wasn't sure wtf was going on... so if you can't place your camp then that's it? Does she see a dead sloth when she does log on? That's happened to me twice already.
---
#notallMothman are bad just stay away from the Wise Mothman who brings enlightenment and bonus xp
---
And also what’s up with all these people downvoting me by saying it was Tuesday lol
---
I have never once seen another camp. If I have it on single player mode is that why? I haven’t gone online with other people other than seeing them in passing because I’m just now really getting the hang of everything.
---
Mmmm Radioactive brahmin cheese.
---
It’s where I live too, for now.. the water and junk combo is great, but the constant sound of crickets chirping from the river is quite tiring. I will be moving as soon as I find a similar location.. without crickets.
---
Oh, that sucks
---
It's got me considering finding a fullset of troubleshooters gear.
---
I didn't know I needed this.
---
No you don't see a dead sloth, just not there. She Just server hopped and went back to camp and he was still there ... so seems it's not every time. Certainly happened that way the other day though and I have read that it's a thing.
---
They don't all go on sale on the same day.
---
Here is a link that might help.

---
Thanks for informing me guys, darn was hoping to get some of the atom shop stuff that I missed oh well, any of you willing to build the non atom stuff for me?
---
Hey, that looks very cool! Do you have other concept art works?
---
Not a weapon, but lost my shielded vault suit while streaming a bit back. I went back to watch the video of the stream and I didn't see what could have happened at all! 
---
I just know I swapped outfits and missed around with it before I logged off. SO maybeeeeee it disappeared while changing clothes
---
 Sucks!! But, got raider undies on for now haha.
---
Is it possible to get a vault suit again? I also never got the Nuka Tapper game on the way out the vault. Blows!!! But that's how it is! Just hope I don't lost something like that again, I really liked that suit yo! Cheers folks!!! 📢🥥🍆🍖🎉
---
42
---
I like how you think
---
Thanks so much!! I'll get round to finishing this off someday haha
---
I'd love that! I remember a post suggesting it a while ago, saying that he could say landmarks that he's seen to make finding him a little easier, play music and commentate like Travis etc  I think it'd add a lot!
---
Public workshops, sadly
---
He’s messing with you, if you do encounter another camp, their stash box will actually be your stash box.
---
Haha thanks!
---
Good trades!
---
They're fine. Lighter than rifles, and likely less AP cost. Many get access to silencers for the huge damage boost from Mister Sandman. I also think the single shot variants with crack shot gives you much less damage falloff at long range verses rifles.
---
The only reason I switched off to rifles was because I got a near god tier combat rifle. A one star anti-armor 10mm carried me through PVE and PVP.
---
Yeah I agree, even though I like having my camp with a collector, and won't anyone else build near it.
---
You can indeed reach both extractors with a camp, but not the water. I set up my friend’s camp for him in that location and it gave him the lead he was lacking but he ended up moving anyways because that location is in the path of wandering super mutants, meaning almost consistent attacks from them.
---
Awesome idea, and needs a msg alert to go with it.
---
Be a lot easier then chasing down new players and shooting at a paper bag
---
Thanks for a nice SBQ fight :)
---
Hope you didn't mind that i added you and one of you friend on my friend list, it's the only way for me to get of the very boring server her in Scandinavian, nothing is going on on this servers.
---
And most of my earlier friends are no longer playing (been around since first beta)  :)
---
So this way i can at least find interesting servers, lol
---
Yeah it can be like that. My partner got it on 2nd try ... just going from Giant Teapot to the Landview Lighthouse and there it was. For me it took 2 evenings and I nearly gave up as a bad job 
---
Giant Teapot - on a picnic table just in front of fast travel spot, after the cars. 
---
Landview Lighthouse - up the top hanging over the railing. 
---
Good luck.
---
Oof.   Thanks for posting.  So what are they meant to be?  Mirrors?  Don't understand why they wouldn't have at least attempted to mimic the proper logos considering Fallout's otherwise strong sense of in-world branding.
---
Well any armor worth a damn anyways. I personally would like to have the option to wear all outfits/under armor over or under.
---
It kinda makes sense. It's like your flag, and it declares anything within set distance from it, as yours. That makes it a circle.(in 2D space, it extends nicely below and above the camp device altitude)
---
Thanks for your support lol. It’s just annoying as hell I really don’t understand why it has to be a random encounter
---
3 HOURS I've been at it !
---
I encountered  ghouls, scorched, gulpers, super mutants, sheepsquashes, a lemonade stand, multiple deathclaws of the wrong type (including some dead ones named "travelling merchants"), crashed satellites, bombs ...
---
You name it, I saw it ! (except, the alpha deathclaw of course)
---
Yeah this would be cool - a trailer park or something where people can have their own little spot
---
Yeah I would really enjoy that - it's nice to have a living voice to follow. I remember the very first time I found him in game I followed him around for like an hour just listening to the fun stuff he has to say. You have a great idea there! 
---
And if you ever finish coloring it - make sure to show it here so we can see it!
---
I’m in! We don’t even need a backstory for it. Maybe you pick up a note that shows a location of a cave and it’s an instanced dungeon.
---
You will see the sale price at 8pm ET tonight!
---
I tried to get a screen shot or picture but, it changed too fast.
---
Yes, fireproof will help with self inflicted explosion damage. Add a Dense Mod to your chest armor on top of that and you’ll reduce explosion damage down almost all the way.
---
Yes it works and you wont blow yourself up as much. I heard having a dense mod on your armor helps as well.

---
Personally I just hop in one spot instead of looking around at all the spots. Try to see if you can find a couple people who would be willing to team up with you and server hop at the same location - that's how I found it with my group - we picked one spot and we all hopped until we found it because it is frustrating to try alone.
---
That would be nice the tactical outfit they released the other week was underarmor aswell liked that one aswell
---
Those things shred me to pieces and I have lvl 50 T-51b. And it’s almost always over repaired.
---
“Security is on point in this mf” haha nice.. this is really cool, just curious if there are any events or anything that your CAMP would block? But thats a sweet camp
---
Thank you for the help and the tip on the dense mod.
---
I found this much better.

If you mean Explosive legendary effect, then you'll need to farm for it. I suggest West Tek.
---
I'm curious what's considered a god roll? I've got a quad explosive rr western that's pretty sweet. I tend to use a 1* mutants western a lot though as it doesn't Michael Bay the shit out of everything.

Ultracite power armor mod plans drop from the queen.

No I'm not bitter at all, honest. 
---
Fix this shit please.
---
Thanks for the help, guess I’m off to get a dense chest mod :)
---
I am lvl 360 I just love fallout man I can't explain it
---
And Pulse Grenades and mines.
---
A lot of people farm West Tek and Whitesprings for legendaries and the levels come from that. The other day I saw a guy who was level 402 and I can't imagine how many hours he has.
---
Just go to fissure site’s near watoga and you’ll get it done way faster
---
Uhhhhh why not do your own thing and let looter shooter players enjoy what they do. Bethesda has constantly stated their intent to reach different play styles. Although you can argue that the story and rpg styles are completely unsupported.. but let them have their fun! I know a lot of people that just like to play games to grind and that’s okay.
---
Yes, that's a late game thing.  Not something you'd bother with at Lv. 50.  They are cheaper in the aftermarket, from what I understand, but they go for 18,000 Caps apiece at a certain in-game vendor.  The Scorchbeast Queen used to drop them at one point, but doesn't anymore.
---
cool story bro!
---
I play bloodied sneaky unarmed/shotgun in one of my toons, Unyielding/Sentinel is my favourite.
---
Just remember that Sentinel kicks in when you stand up and stay put. It does not work while crouched.
---
This has happened to me in the past and I do not know what the cause of it was. Bethesda didn't really give a shit. Basically they acted like I was trying to get something for nothing from them and they would not help even when I had PS4 video. Last I heard they were looking into it, that has to have been 3 months ago.
---
I'm missing Mountain Honey.  Not sure if Biv is supposed to give that out one or not, I've gotten everything else (except for Firecracker whiskey and associated cocktails, of course) and he's started to give me duplicate plans.  If anyone on Xbox has an extra Mountain Honey recipe, I can trade pretty much any other recipe for it.
---
Yeah, that's a bit paranoid.
---
Bethesda doesn't care.  In fact, their proposed fix for the CAMP placement issues is so essentially do what floating bases already accomplish (i.e. consider only a single foundation piece when determining if a CAMP can be replaced).
---
That’s all? What about regular scorchbeasts?
---
I feel you could obtain an acceptable level of survivability for a berzerkers build. You can gain over 400 maximum HP with endurance perks and food. There is also percentage based damage reduction which helps cover the lack of armor. Think lone wanderer, dodgy, fireproof, blocker, etc. The main issue is the damage bonus from berzerkers may not cover the loss of utility from legendary armor slots.
---
Do we know the damage boost cap at zero DT? I feel it would need to be over 50% to be viable.
---
I think there's some value in speculation since one never knows where a good idea might come from. Most ideas will be bad, but there might be some gems in there. Good luck getting a discussion rolling without confusing people looking for news.
---
I tried to get a similar discussion going a few weeks ago, without luck. My strawman had much higher costs, and allowed for the possibility of re-rolling each effect; not because I think it's likely, but because I think it's interesting to test a willingness-to-pay model on the concept.
---
I think you need higher token costs if you allow people to re-roll very specific items (e.g. 3\* heavy combat armor right arms).
---
My thread is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/betrlz/legendary\_vendor\_strawman/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/betrlz/legendary_vendor_strawman/)
---
Great pictures! I love the choice of colors! What filter did you use for the last one? I like to use Daytripper and play around with the settings to make it look like an old color photograph.
---
Never happen.  
---
Just imaging a couple well armed camps getting in an automated firefight because a bloat fly got between them aggro'd a turret.  That's would be way too amusing, boadering on epic, for them to allow.
---
Yea I think they should add some pre existing things such as trailers and already built homes like they had in fallout 4. It was nice to just place a already built structure and then decorate the inside. They also need to add things to not make out camps look so blocky, I wish they would just add everything they had in fallout 4 it would give us a lot more to work with.
---
Drop your PA down there and hop on top. You'll be able to get your loot.
---
It's available for ps4 now if you're interested. I already played this latest league on pc and decided to try it on ps4 and it feels different. Almost refreshing but it does have some drawbacks. But I will say I do enjoy delving while laying in bed.
---
I've never gotten them from regular Scorchbeats - the only thing I ever get from them is a piece of meat - bone - wing - random crap weapon.
---
I’m a level 104 and I just wander and kill anything I see
---
Hell ya. Make it look like a campground with fire rings and a picnic table.  Lol
---
I've used weapons that do a total of 5 damage on things like the imposter sheepsquatch and still gotten loot with only one shot. Same thing with sbq.
---
I agree, the trend is more towards PvP than anything else regardless of what Bethesda states, but its fine honestly.  Ill take what the put out and do my best to enjoy it.
---
You'd have be like full blown shitbrained to call resident evil post apocalyptic. 
---
If every video game that exists with a post apocalyptic setting is copying fallout....
---
What about wasteland asshole? Does that one predate you too?
---
They spawn randomly and do will attacks more than melee
---
What if Enclave events gave Enclave tokens that we could turn into a vendor? That vendor could have rotating loot, and would sell pretty much anything that the Enclave sells, but for tokens instead of caps. They could also sell a few legendary items.
---
Maybe tokens could be used for MODUS services, like supply drops with aid items, and ammo? Or courier bots that take loot back to your stash. 
---
Idk, just tossing some ideas out there. I totally agree with you that the loot is underwhelming, and I hope they make it more interesting soon.
---
If they wanted balanced PvP they wouldn't be playing 76.  :(
---
Max damage is just adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage for ranged builds. 
---
Melee builds will add Radicool.
---
Melee also benefits from the strength boosts of Unyielding armor.
---
Ranged VATS builds also benefit for VATS accuracy/AP availability/crit generation from Unyielding armor. Its not directly damage, but it allows you do be more likely to damage, for longer, and crit (more damage) more often. 
---
There’s several utility/survival tools that kick in at low health, too. Like serendipity perk (no power armor) or Emergency Protocols mod (power armor)
---
Everything else people have listed aren’t really unique to low health builds.
---
Oh that is very annoying. Did you try hopping or did it stay?
---
I put moonshine that I found in mine.
---
thank you so much for let me know I'm not the only one without a tse!
---
Because of that I build me a melee and be happy with that. 
---
What I'm curious about is, will the stuff I put in the stashes or the bags at the trading station will be there after I leave the server?
---
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: If the US wanted to win it’s war with China, they should have just mass produced Level 52 Col. Gutsy’s and shipped them to China.
---
Yeah, I think so. I'm not sure why they would bother with mirrors if they're not going to deal with making them mirror.
---
Bloodied explosive 2 shot is best you could get. Also wht lvl is your mutant western
---
Yeah I just crafted a new one, I'm just trying to determine if I'm fucking up and if so how can I stop doing it.
---
I think I have a lvl 50 if u want it
---
Thanks! I think its the saturated filter. I took that one awhile ago so I dont really remember
---
You can't extend beyond the cap of 15 in any special, even with any sort of chem/food/perk as those are temporary and you're unable to sign a card to those points. The only thing you can do is remove other cards to free up a point.
---
Maybe they’ve changed it since I went through that, then. It was very consistent to me when I was getting credit vs when I wasn’t. But that was 3-some months ago.
---
I hope they add more drink recipes with unique effects now that they have the punch bowl. Itd be fun to have more variety rather then either getting a strength buff or blacking out lol
---
lucky you. I scrapped that stuff.
---
when they mentioned play styles Im pretty sure they were refering to PvP and PvE
---
I mean, it's not though. It has less story than Borderlands, and less loot, and less bosses. It does have slightly, more survival...I guess? I mean you have to eat and drink. That's about it. Bases are relatively pointless and they're not even fun. You don't have to protect them. 
---
Maybe don't complain about people complaining that loot sucks on a looter shooter, m'kay?
---
I would not use the term "return" because he didn't take it from you. I would say, he was kind enough to let me have it back.
---
Once sold by accident my Two shot explosive handmade to guy. Worst part is that he already had one or two and didn't give it back.
---
I found it by accident. Happened upon the Colonel Kelly monument and there was waldo.
---
Currently there seems to be a big no build zone even between buildable boarders. My CAMP is on a lake and can't be placed even when there is another CAMP on the far opposite side.
---
Yup. Level 260 and still playing almost every day since launch. For me it's the social aspect. Helping out lower levels. Nuking the queen with my high level friends.
---
Shit... I wasn't even good at killing the queen till after level 100.
---
Well, fuck. It took me 5 tries. RNJesus has not smiled on you today. :(
---
Build your own endgame:
---
* Become a wildlife photographer and take pictures of every mob in the game
---
* Open a free clinic outside of Vault 76 and supply wasteland newbs with health and rad items
---
* Open a paid clinic outside Whitesprings and sell serums
---
* Open a pub, give away cheap booze and sell the expensive stuff
---
* Open a Power Armor garage, where you can provide repairs, mods, frames, and/or materials.
---
Once you have a goal, the game becomes fulfilling the requirements to meet that goal.  Need to farm certain materials en masse, or build your CAMP to appear a certain way to fit that theme.
---
Sadly it also tends to cause the ps4 to bog/crash.  
---
For those that have not done this. A spring board trap will give enough velocity to break the Calc for for how flight normally does a parabolic arc.  You can jet at max altitude across the board by pulsing.  Faster then fast travel, if you don't count the time it takes for zone to load when you land.
---
Almost....
---
I just want to use them where they're designed for, power armor.
---
I can't really understand that.
---
If you have no reason to play past completing your build, what reason you have to finish it?
---
Also helps if you build a tower to max shop build height.  Bit more wiggle room if your don't get flung very high (vertical and horizontal depend on where you stand).
---
Awww, is the OP build sad?
---
Except the module is rectangular too, it has defined sides which could be a pivot point to place a square or rectangular zone fairly easily.
---
Damn, I feel bad. I got in the first try. Keep in mind that I have server hopped 60 times and still never got the Longcoat. Lol
---
There's also a puppy dog at the very top, but he dies for some reason every time I get close.
---
This is almost all looter shooter though, its definitely designed that way. It's not like fan feedback has molded the game from a rpg into a looter shooter. Writing was on the wall since 4.
---
They're not aggroed in the forest. They like to fly by, but that'all.
---
Mole rats?
---
Yeah, I've been playing since launch, but I really didn't have much time to really commit until March.  Now I'm pretty much on par with most others who have been playing since launch and there really isn't much else to do besides grind.  I mean I haven't explored *every inch* of the map and still have an okay amount on my to do list but for the most part I've hit most of what there is to do that isn't trying to grind and get my character decked out.  
---
Now I'm not complaining about that, it's a complaint against OPs complaint about all of the people in the same spot as I am.  It's the nature of this being an online game - I can't reroll a new character and choose a different faction and go through quest lines I can't do on my main.
---
It's and event that can start at southern belle motel and big Fred's BBQ you have to go there for it to appear unless someones there already
---
I think it would be funny if the structures all broke if you destroyed the foundation.
---
Before they nerfed the experience from glowing ones at white springs it was easy to get 10-15lvls from a nuke launch.
---
There's always enough mobs to donate your spare bullets to.
---
Meh much easier if they just gave us spherical walls.
---
Lucky Hole Mine - This has been suggested a number of times in other posts and I finally made the trek to the location.
---
Wearing the Excavator, I was able to mine a good bit of Lead Ore - I came out with 400+ Lead Ore, equipped Super Duper to smelt them, and gained 2,000+ Lead scraps. 
---
Ha! ...now the only issue is to find a hefty amount of steel scraps 😒
---
It's well worth the travel though!
---
Should be a solved link on there. Within a day or two they tend to have three cracked.
---
Ya guilty
---
You’re saying all of Melee is OP and that hits just not working is alright?
---
You’re kinda a sore winner don’t you think?
---
Told y'all need a turd.
---
Late to the party, but I'm looking for an answer too.  
---
So far, I've got it working OK by choosing Borderless Window, and 1280x720 resolution in the game, AND making a text file called "`Fallout76Custom.ini`" in "`Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\`" and putting 
---
    [Display]
---
    iLocation X=0
---
    iLocation Y=152
---
in the text file, the result is FO76 "letterboxed" like watching HD widescreen on an old 4:3 TV.  Downside is lower FPS, which is why I'm hunting for any other solutions.  Fullscreen gains me 10FPS, but everything is stretched vertically.
---
Given games physics if you break the single foundation all the elevated pieces should fly all over the place. :)
---
I've had one spawn within a 3 sec run within visual range.
---
Fast travels back to camp
---
spawns under foundations 
---
while mole rats eat the jukebox
---
Yes! This would be amazing to watch
---
Gotta be a little more specific. You’re asking a lot.  When did you leave?  There’s an update every 1-2 weeks and there been multiple events and new add ons.
---
The other brown meat....prairie dog.
---
Not at all
---
The gameplay. My sneak vats build plays differently than my heavy guns build, which plays differently than my melee build. I love the vats for taking out tons lower hp enemies, but it struggles a bit when legendary spawns/scorch beast take it out of sneak and I lose the sneak dmg bonus. Being hidden is also its biggest defense, so it hurts when in danger. the heavy weapons is great at everything, but is a much higher resource drain (mostly ammo). The melee was a great starter that got me to "endgame", low resource cost, it just felt bad waiting for scorch beasts to land to actually do dmg.
---
Specifically Elecric
---
I love that spot! I have a picture ingame and IRL from the same spot. It's sweet.
---
I showed my girlfriend the spot in game and she immediately recognized it.
---
7 Nukashines at once...
---
Did he end up in Fallout 3?
---
"Not acting normally" seems to be how they act normally. I can re-affirm as well as another post that sheepsquatches seem to prioritize npc enemies over players.
---
Are you diseased with the plague mutation?
---
Get a shotgun, shoot in the general direction where the mobs are, profit :D
---
Honestly, shotguns are fantastic if headshots are not your thing.
---
Give it a go before you get hooked on VATS.
---
Bonus: point distribution is interchangeable with melee, you can seamlessly transition between both. Low on shells? switch to melee and go for a spin in the Ash Heap.
---
Extra bonus: Take carnivore and you can take the Mole Miner's shells, poach their suits/breathers and eat their meat. Nom nom nom! They are the pigs of Appalachia, nothing goes to waste!
---
Extra extra bonus: Scorched in the Ash Heap usually carry shells too - but they taste rancid.
---
Extra extra extra bonus: get hold of a bloodied DCG, MMG or Power Fist and a shottie and go stealth/low health and just melt everything in your path, from a distance or up, close and personal, however the occasion demands.
---
The incongruence of having a suppressor on a shotgun loaded with buckshot should give you a sense of pride and accomplishment too!
---
Ultimate bonus: Fuck VATS and the horse it rode on in.
---
With good items being so critical in this game, we really need a "are you sure you want to drop your favourited item?" message.
---
This is my goto.  It almost always trips when you travel to defiance.
---
Plans, recipes, outfits I want them all!
---
Damn. That’s worse than it is for me. Sometimes when I go to the option, and then audio settings, and then fiddle with all can hear, it team can hear, or area can hear, that helps me. I shouldn’t have to do this, but it happens. Hope that helps you.
---
7600 hours achievement is a time tracker tool,  and 7600 hours is too much by design.
---
Buy the plans and scrap the ones you find at Berkeley Spring. Seems like the respawn is almost 2 days....it's a grind. I'll start crafting low level ones to scrap after I max super duper perk.
---
I have never crashed one time while or anytime close to flying, I have flown in groups of people and had no issues ever. 
---
When you hit the ground it takes awhile for it to render around you so you might get hit by an enemy before they load properly but it is absolutely not faster than fast travelling and you gain nothing but fun by flying
---
You can't have bloodied and two shot together they're both primary prefixes. Two shot is really inaccurate and pistols need headshots and bloodied is okay but you're already squishy with that build as it's all luck, agi and perception so no room for safety measures. Not having to reload every 6 shots is gamechanging though. Appreciate the offer but mine's a 50, also I've got a fairly massive armory already lol. The quad has a prime receiver so I tend to use that mutant's for general shooting.
---
Also I am on PS4
---
I got no one. Well once I muled with a guy we agreed to mule from trading discord.
---
But I still transfer stuff periodically between 4 chars. Mainly shit off my main, into mules. They are nearly loaded to brim. I just join someone who I've traded in past with since after a while I stopped deleting anyone from the first list, typically I try select someone who doensn't seen to be server hopping non-stop. So far I've been lucky, during them time I need to restart the game to switch char(some bug, cant do it normally anymore), as long as the player used as anchor stays on the server, all the stuff is there.
---
I made mistake with my first mule, I didn't level it at all first, then I tried to dump ammo and explosives on it. Drugs too. Well it can't carry shit because of lack of any weight perks, except for drugs maybe. The 1100+800 lbs it has, would weight maybe 100-200 lbs max on my main or alt. And because it's so severly overloaded, I can't do anything with it.
---
Without anyone I've traded with, yeah I probably wouldn't even have an alt. But then I wouldn't have huge piles of useless 2-3 star stuff waiting for Purveyor. I probably wouldn't have IE shotgun. Trading seems to me really essential if you play enough. Maybe if you play for less, you are okay with what stuff the game drops to you.
---
Yeah I've showed some friends the rl pictures while they're at my camp and they're amazed
---
Yeah clipping drives me insane whenever I build a place up. I can never get a defensive fence setup to actually snap. It drives me nuts
---
Maybe a cure? That would be depressing but a awesome touch to his character.
---
Killed 3 scorchedbeasts back to back near fissure site sans nuke and got prime laser gatling plans. They drop you just have to keep killing them
---
Yup... I was wandering around the cranberry bog and found this weird hole in the ground that looked like a fissure only smaller and not marked. I thought... will I die if I jump in there?
---
There is no way it will be atoms
---
Sry im sure I saw a 2 shot bloodied before also I don't need the western I was just gonna give it to u
---
It is 50%
---
One fifty something, play Fallout 76 Reddit Edition, it is where you spend more time on here reading and talking about playing it than actually playing it.
---
Went from level 154 to 160 in a couple days doing 3 hour sessions, just farming the hell out of white springs, weindango cave, pleasant valley, hawks refuge, and treehouse village.
---
More power to ya if it's not killing yours.  I figure about 1/4 of my flights ended in blue screen.  Granted that didn't stop me from building/using a flight terminal for a few weeks.  It's a nice vew you don't see otherwise.
---
Ah shit I’m on pc so I can’t give you anything. I think two shot got nerfed hard. Probably you just want to world hop vendors or farm white spring/west tek if you’re not into trade
---
nope
---
Im down,  psn is Lostkind
---
I hopped for over an hour before heading to bed. Logged on the next morning and Anne was right there. Now to do it for my 3 other characters. &lt;groan&gt;
---
I hope not. I just hope that wasn’t the reason it was delayed.
---
Level 122 and I’ve not even launched a nuke yet, still got plenty of side missions to do, weapons to find, armour to grind, plans and recipes to learn... absolutely love the fallout universe and I’ve not been bored in 76 yet.
---
Look in all the containers,  I found mine near westek and a couple up in the mire
---
Bad bot.
---
High level means more perk cards and ability to refine character, which is huge....but that's it. 
---
At some point every player can one shot or poke a mob with a serrated combat knife and easily kill it.
---
My advice is if you want XP and loot....don't hang back waiting to see what other players are doing, hoping for "etiquette"....get in there and make something happen for yourself.
---
ItS gOiNG tO bE FoR AtOms DuH
---
Yea the perk cards make a huge difference, especially when you create a mule you realize this better, 100 lbs on me turns into 1000 on my level 2 mule, because of this huge carrying weight the mule gets hungry and dehydrated really fast, makes perfect sense lol 
---
I wish they could give a floating stat when I browse my stash so that I can figure out what’s taking up too much space. For the longest time I couldn’t find out what to shed, so out of frustration I dumped everything in a paperbag and pick them up one by one, turned out the hundreds of glowing mass was the biggest weight I’ve been carrying.
---
Yes, but I've made sure I have no diseases when I've gone up there.
---
Oof, that is a tough sell. I guess it is like having two shot and explosive all in one slot. I suppose you could get berserkers explosive for a 75% damage boost. I feel this could work with a pure stealth build. If you will die in a couple hits, just make it so nobody can hit you.
---
Level 135, I play the daily and weekly challenges to keep in it
---
There were three people running around the map telling everyone about the place and inviting people. The gameshow went off without a hitch, you destroyed a statue at a stage they built in a workshop. Then you sat down and if you got it wrong the audience opened fire. It was well thought out.
---
Fly/FT comparision depends where your going and horizontal velocity.  I used it to get to biv for a while and didn't need zone to load to enter the door (flew in from flatwoods so ~ 1/4) board.
---
Start a fresh build! Maybe try doing it exclusively on survival mode if that floats your boat.
---
Awesome! Make sure to look up the mods first as im not 100% on the name but im positive there is one.
---
I still have my original card in my box. Just sitting. Iv just jumped in to other service that activated it. If anyone wants it I’d be will to part with it for something
---
Totally agree I have a route that I travel and it would be great to not have to fast travel back to my camp or divert to some random cooking station to cook meat I pick up.
---
I got mine from an event where I had to protect an eyebot named Robbie iirc
---
Great response. I love fallout as well. I can sit there and farm random spots on the map all damn day.
---
Census violence and other events can give big rewards after playing them enough times. XP creeps up faster than expected.
---
Can confirm it does work
---
I have been playing sense release (not here lately just moved) but I barely made it to lvl 40 as a solo player. I ran straight out of the vault and didn't look back for the quest. All I have done since is move my c.a.m.p. redesign my house and scavenge for food and scrap to modify or build guns and armor with. I find the game quite pleasant. Especially when I am on a server with loads of high level players. They spawn high level enemies that actually presents a challenge for me. To hell with the quests in this game called that from e3 I seldomly was in PvP situations. 
---
Nowadays we are too spoiled. With everything catering to everyone's wants. We are now starting to act like giant brats when we don't get our way. Day in day out I would log on finish making my ammo, go out into the world complete my dailies and go scrapping. I don't want FO to turn into a loot-n-shoot because people these days would rather have COD reskin the fifth, or pretend to be a gangbanger in a shoot-em-up. Yes Bethesda tried to do something new and different and yes it's like choppy water.
---
Destiny ran into the same problem of too many people getting pissy about the legend drops and when they fixed it for everyone they all left because the game wasn't the same. 
---
Wake up and smell the skunk in your face. You cannot always get what you want. And if you do, then you must give up something in return. That's life. So what you spent the time grinding on something you DON'T need. Stop focusing on what the game is not and focus on what it is. Beggers cannot be choosers you are ruining the game for those of us that are actually playing the game. In the end it's all just one big mess of code life will go on. 
---
Go ahead down vote me. DO IT!!!
---
I saw someone with around 530. These guys must have some crazy good shit lol
---
I hover around 5000-6000, enough so fast travel isn't an issue and if a vendor has something I really want...I get it.
---
It also works with scorchedbeasts screaming attack.
---
I really like your ideas with bulking up life, fireproof will work but dodgy and serendipity are really the only benefits.
---
Every other perk adds resistance and even having the grounded mutation lowers beserker damage.
---
Bloodied is just strickly better, as they can actually tank up and their armor adds +15 strength which is actually offensive
---
These guys are just majestic to watch. Saw one (3star leg) take on 5 super mutants (1 legend) solo and only go down to self heal.
---
killed raiders, yes, you are correct on that one
---
Npcs also prioritize it over Players as well.
---
Would also love to know how stalker weapons work in general. I wish my stack of stalkers’ rolling pins came with a user manual.
---
Beer also increases your charisma. I use Hard Bargain, level 3, drink a beer, and grape mentats. I hit Westek and Harpers Ferry as the mutants drop caps and a lot of assault rifles that sell at a good price.
---
High quality shit post ya old bag of bones.
---
Lmao!!!!......IKR!!
---
Got mine from the plan spawn point at the workshop at top of the world one outside and doing the nuke launch event.
---
Are you still there?
---
I remember my first bought with a scorchbeast. My friend and I had to respawn at least 5 or 6 times each before we brought it down. Before you know it you'll be dropping them like bloodbugs.
---
Also, why are you bring weapons with that low of damage to those fights and doing only that much damage?
---
380 here, just love the environment and atmosphere in the game, so whenever I have time I walk in the wasteland and enjoy its beauty. I haven’t played other FO games, this is my first.
---
Really? It must be something else. Targeting hud maybe? I’ve honestly never had anyone blue screen, even with landing in scorched earth with another person haha
---
It is impossible to be atoms because it would be illegal it many countries. Atoms are like real life currency which can't be traded in video games due to anti gambling laws and the like.
---
Good find! I just bought the skin today. I definitely think it’s a possibility that they would add he gun.  Since the Fujiniya Intelligence Bass had ordered a shipment of them, that definitely increases the chances. Either that or bethesda was just trying to make the skin look as exotic as possible.
---
Lone wanderer will work too. I stand corrected
---
I like Fallout too but doing the same thing over and over again would get boring fast.
---
Thanks for all the responses guys, I'll be on the lookout for the plan, Ad Victoriam!
---
You need to get really far away much further than bus now and have there be nobody near the gold club no timer just male sure u kill all the ghouls or it can mess up respawn.
---
That's totally fair. I mentioned 2x or 3x cost of tokens, and after reconsidering, I could see that being more likely than 1 to 1.
---
I think rerolling specific effects would be great, but it would also be significantly easier to get the dream rolls. 
---
This could be coupled with higher cost, but I still feel as if it takes away from the randomness of the current loot system.
---
With your idea in place, you're practically guaranteed to get what you want eventually, which would be nice, but also more devastating on the high end market. 
---
Not that the market should really be the most important factor anyway, but your idea definitely has it's positives and negatives. 
---
I'm more for RNG than higher token cost, even if it ends up being more time spent, simply in order to maintain the rarity of god-rolls. 
---
I suppose I've been a bit redundant, but I mainly just wanted to get my ideas out and compare with others. I appreciate your feedback, and i'll gladly check out your thread.
---
depends i have just made an excel sheet with all the items i could find i included = the cost to make bulk when bulk is needed to sell to robots....
---
i will give you a counter example immediately = 
---
with hard bargain lvl 3 , 
---
take the imported chinese panda, it contains  3 raw cloth, 2 leather, you sell it for one caps, if you break it into components, you sell 30 raw cloth in bulk for 8 caps - the 2 plastic for making the caps = 0.22 per raw cloth, plus 0.78 per leather (13 caps for 15 leathers), so = 0.66 + 1.56 = 2.22 caps instead of 1...
---
I definitely understand that. I just like seeing the different types of variants of legendaries I can get. But I definitely understand that the grind may get boring
---
Here’s why that wont happen: this game has a significant lack of cap sinks. Why do you think the new imposter fight costs so much to summon? 
---
Fast travel not removing caps from the economy is the opposite direction the devs want (need) to go.
---
YOU KNOW IT BOI
---
I have no sympathy for those who demand 3 star enemies drop 3 star loot... But the fact that they don't kinda makes the game a looter shooter.
---
The loot in the game is literally random gear with a random number of random effects. Not a looter shooter? Get real.
---
Thanks everyone for the insight. My apologies for my language, just frustrated is all.

Play around with this if you haven’t yet :) It’ll help you decide which is best for your character. Also search posts on this forum, and YouTube videos.
---
Yea for some reason that happens right when u log in. Happened to me the other day. I reequiped  my armpit and my perks and it fixed.
---
That makes sense. 
---
It was something that crossed my mind and thought id ask. I Love their games, but Bethesda can be pretty sneaky sometimes.
---
Borrowed this from someone else here:
---
Start in Overseer's camp on the river.  Equip Green Thumb perk, start picking up all the Soot Flowers, Bloodleaf and wood from logs you can see.  Follow the river towards Flatwoods, there's quite a bit of Bloodleaf in the river and Soot Flower in the fields at the bottom near Vault Tec Agricultural Research Center.  Spam the collect button while in water to pick up a bunch of dirty water.  In Flatwoods there are several cooking stations, equip Chemist and Super Duper(3) perks, then turn all your dirty water into Boiled Water, then craft Healing Salves.  You should get 100-200 or so, then go to the Responder Vendor in the church and equip Hard Bargain(3) perk and pop a Grape Mentats and sell all your Salves.  Should hit that 1400 limit easily.    
---
If you don't already have it, the Medbay Vendor in the Whitesprings Enclave bunker sells the Grape Mentats and Mentats plans, make sure to use Hard Bargain to buy them.
---
Don’t do any repetitive selling/scrapping/dropping quickly. As best as I can tell, thats the source/cause of most reports. 
---
Slow down.
---
For some reason the engine can’t handle doing those actions in rapid succession and will “grab” the wrong item to sell/scrap/drop on occasion.
---
Holy shit
---
Meat for me, and greens for moo moo!
---
Would definitely only work Well after the base immunity or whatever it's called drops. Otherwise you're going to get more base destructions.
---
Sweet! Thank you man. I appreciate it :)
---
There are fusion cores everywhere. I don't use PA, unless I need to leap off a cliff.
---
I carry 3 with me, if I find one, I drop the one with lowest remaining charge. Also, when I needed more stash space, those 3lb fuckers were the first to go, have about 5 at 100%.
---
Why? He seems quite content with who he is. That's rather the point about Super Mutants, they are invariably content in what they are. Even Strong dosn't want to \*be\* human, he just wants to know what makes humans so strong for such puny creatures.
---
&gt; In terms of "massively" multiplayer online products, Fallout 76 stands alone as one of, if not THE easiest to conquer in terms of end game "progression". Players beat the first and final boss of the game a mere day after the game's release. This is unheard of. In terms of progression, it took the first WoW guild almost 6 MONTHS to clear the end game progression dungeons.
---
I haven't seriously played an MMO since vanilla WoW, but this is a great example.  There is no real challenging endgame content for me even as a solo player.  Legendary opponents are barely stronger than their counterparts and all of them share pretty much the same damn loot table (except the most recent additions have unique cosmetics. meh).  No in game marketplace or even good way to communicate, especially on console.  I'm not giving up on the game and am playing it while I type, but to dismiss the real complaints is wrong.
---
My buddy hopped for over 2hrs, I was lucky he messaged me when he found it.
---
*Maybe you should cut down on the jet.*
---
I help a lot of low level people, but there’s only so much you can help with. At some point you need to help yourself. An example is this level 5 that kept getting killed, so I kept using stims, because he wouldn’t equip a weapon or get out of my way after hitting an enemy so I could kill it so we’d both get the XP. Another low level that was with him even dropped him a weapon he could use and he wouldn’t pick it up. I don’t have unlimited patience. The other low level that was with us (level 12) listened to me and is now level 50 after a week of playing with me. As for events...if it’s the SBQ or Imposter, they are tough so we’re going to give them everything we have...you’ll have plenty of time to get hits in. For other events, I will give it a couple hits then watch to make sure everyone gets a hit and once they do, I’ll kill it.
---
Now don’t start talking crazy!!!
---
This is exactly why I left the swamp.  Nothing ever came to attack me but I heard twigs snapping all around me late at night 😂 I moved back to my mountain.  Tip top where I can see all.
---
I think the token will need to be weapon-specific, i.e. you scrap a legendary MG42 and get a MG42 token, you then use it to reroll your other MG42s but not your rolling pin. If it’s not weapon-specific, the token becomes so easy to acquire, we’ll just collect a boatload of rolling pins and use the token to reroll our Handmades. Garbage legendary is so easy to acquire, this will make top tier Legendaries worthless. 
---
Just in case it’s not weapon-specific, I’m keeping all the rolling pins and tire irons I come across, which is a LOT. But I highly doubt it that those can be used to exchange this universal token and then be used to re-roll my good weapons.
---
Oh my god, me walking into the first train station and seeing it full of stuff and then thinking oh wow, I have all this too 😂 I got about halfway down 😂😂😂
---
While we're at it.. Give it a top down view.
---
I used to claim a workshop, just for the initial reward if plans, then bounce servers.
---
Now that griefing by losers is a thing, I no longer claim workshops.
---
No need to claim a workshop, unless a team us staking out a homestead. Better use if time and resources for a single player to farm PvE mobs, scrap materials and compete quests for rewards.
---
Railway rifle has a much faster fire rate with auto piston receiver, 1 hit per second is wrong value. Please, fix it!
---
I dont get why the camps dont just sidestep either. What I mean is, if someone builds in the same spot you do, why dont your camp just spawn next door ? Surely the game can rotate your place to fit whatever landscape within reason or even just spawn your camp close at least instead of not at all ? I mean dont get me wrong, whitesprings has everything you need really plus vendors. I just prefer my camp
---
To bad Bethesda gives us 5 minutes stories in what they call big updates. I liked the stories they included in notes and holotapes but after 200h there's nothing left to do. And if the next storyline (scout part) will again be 5-10 min read and repeat the I'm gone for good.
---
Thats litt.
---
This is mostly my play style. I roleplay the loan survivor. I explore all the time but rarely interact with other players except a friendly wave in passing. If not for the need to occupy a lead resource node I’d have my camp way off on the side of some mountain that’s hard to get to. Play your way and you’ll always have fun!
---
Plus, this gallery is useless. You can't use the images to share or download. I first thought they would be available on the Bethesda website, but well no... I'm taking an Xbox Screenshot of the Photo I've taken to save and use it actually. So double work doesn't make sense. Why not extend the gallery or make an Xbox Screenshot from the photo optionally too?
---
Nice!  This perk has been flying under my radar for some reason.
---
I was in Brazil briefly years ago and thought about getting a game to take home (I knew little of region codes at the time) but say a 50 dollar game in the US was close to 160 US. When I asked why I was told it had a lot to do with translating and import fees which are insane for electronics I guess. I assumed most people just ordered US copies these days.
---
“Four score and seven minutes ago, you just fired a mini nuke at me. I am going to have to emancipate my foot from your ass!”
---
Thanks for the help
---
Slowly approach the corner. You can do it, I have faith.
---
Huh. I'm glad you brought the bulk thing up bc I didn't know that. Thanks!!
---
With the new update they made it to where you can’t camp in, but around places. 
---
I had my camp on the stream right next to White Springs and ended up having to move it.
---
Will look into the Asbestos, a couple people said Dense so I assume that could most likely be the one.  Thank you for the input, it all helps.
---
Anyone got any nukes on their map?
---
I sold an explosive Gatling to a vendor bot by accident, fortunately I double checked and bought it back on the spot. It was completely my fault in the first place, I got distracted and pressed sell button way too fast. 
---
Now every time when I’m done with selling I quit the buy-sell interface then initiate it again just to make sure everything the bot has is what I wanted to get rid of.
---
What's your issue with this game? You don't have to buy atoms, plenty available for free. What they planned for this game requires more than they have gotten from sales, and you get future content for free. Describing mediocre games that had no future because they didn't plan long term ways to make profit, doesn't change that Fallout will likely offer more at no charge to you.
---
Dude.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
What?
---
Yeah that's cool, thanks for the offer.
---
There is a house cat taxedermy head on the way, does that count?
---
Can confirm.... I've also gotten prime plans from scorched beasts on two occasions... don't remember exactly what they were, but I remember being pleasantly surprised.
---
"Hey you... you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right?"
---
I was able to walk up to him yesterday.
---
Yeah, glad it worked out!
---
The Gun Runners wouldn’t exist yet in FO76, nor would they be near the East Coast.
---
Try using PA in a SBQ, you'll go through numerous full cores in a few hours.
---
Hazmat suit, marsupial, speed demon, sneak perk...a few radaway and nuka grape. If daytime and you have sunkissed perk, cool. 
---
You can decide to stay high and tag mobs or sneak around to loot.
---
I haven't even seen a legendary one.  I've killed soooo many with the little crown but that's it.
---
Hey! Thanks for coming!
---
Yes, scrap, sell, drop.
---
Indeed, I found a dead one first try at Watoga's fissure site. Thanks !

As you can see I’m only using lvl1 gunslinger dmg perks of each rank. I didn’t have adrenaline activated either. The dmg you’re seeing in my short clip is from **Nerd Rage, Covert Operative, Sneak bonus, 3 lvl1 Gunslinger perks, Bloody Mess, and Better Criticals.**

*Graham and Chally the moo moo's fair trades. We find you. You trade fair. Or die. Guarenteed.*

---
I think once dedicated servers are a thing this might happen. I forsee the community building being more like private minecraft servers once we can keep returning to the same server and our bases stay around even when we are offline.
---
Well, all wasn't in vain... I found a Witch &amp; Witch costume plan I didn't have, as part of a random encounter over there :P
---
They’re just reskinned mole rats and they wouldn’t be found in Appalachia.
---
The issue is that a newly released games cost us 42-48 USD on steam with regional pricing.
---
it hella is. Had people come in and 100% trash my camp and then one-shot me when I tried to defend it. Came back and the guy had stripped down so his friends could collect the bounty. Then they just took turns killing me every time I came back.
---
I have a Berserker's Explosive pump. It does 250 without me being having an spec in shotguns, I imagine with 3 sets of cards it'll skyrocket. Might be viable, but you lose out entirely on good pvp perks like Sentinel Assassin or cavalier.
---
Game is "pay to win forever" because of a single time it had an event that barely had any impact on anyone at all. Yeah, you've got like the worst logic ever.
---
Nothing ever lasts forever Except the universe and that’s debatable
---
I had a similar event but I made leather armor set and a baseball bat that was modded for a level 2 that visited my Camp. Apparently when I went through my inventory to scrap stuff my modded baseball bat was gone. So I quickly went to the Overseer's camp and asked him to swap it out with me. I was glad he didn't scrap it. We went ahead and dropped the items and picked up the item we wanted.
---
We need a way to prevent items from dropping, scrapping, or being sold on accident when trading.
---
Care to share the location?
---
Check back in after new content rolls out!  I have a feeling this game is like fine wine, better with age!
---
Time to wire up some autodoors. Set it and forget it! :)
---
That's a saint right there. The average roamer wold of pulled of take and dash. That's a saint right there bro.
---
Understandable but I'm talking not using hunting rifles only combat rifle or handmades. Trust me I know the damage that comes with a good hunting riffle but I want to get away from "snipers"
---
Does it give anything good?
---
I could see that working, but then there would be a ton of different tokens.
---
This isn't a bad thing, but it sort of makes the system less practical in my opinion.
---
I've run into like 2 legendary lever actions in my 300ish hours, and i'd just be SoL if i ever wanted to reroll it.
---
Incisor
---
Same. Now, I like teaming up and palling around with strangers, or my partner (we bought a second system so we could play this game together), but I am good spending 25% farming, 25% crafting, 25% exploring, and 25% questing/fighting. 
---
If she weren't in the picture, challenges probably wouldn't even make up 5% of my time in game.
---
Get the right gun or look up a certain build. That really opens the game up. The day you run into a dealthclaw or scorpion and you smile instead of running away was the game changer for me. My second character was level 33 about a week ago. I had pretty much abandoned it. I transferred some guns from my main (Bloodied handmade), and that changed the game for that character. Now I’m trying to get it past level 50 before the legendary player change comes out.
---
I've gotten in the habit of taking the photo, viewing it and pressing the Xbox button and then Y to do a screenshot there and delete the photo in Fallout. I keep may favorites in the game still show they show up on the load screen, but it stinks to have to limit them.
---
 If you like fo76, maybe take a look at fallout 3, NV, and 4.  4 especially is basically single player 76.
---
I can confirm that when you are selling items in succession, most of the time, your selection goes to the next item in line.  However every 8 or so sales in quick succession, it seems to select the item above the one you just sold.  I've caught myself almost selling things I didn't want to many times because of this.
---
The only time I've seen no-loot tags personally is when hitting scorchbeasts outside the effective range of my shotguns. I'm not entirely sure if that's low damage or zero damage.
---
Junk guns vs Whitesprings ghouls should be a good test though, as they 1k HP each.
---
You're right! he says:
---
*One day we find the thing we want, Chally, my moo moo. One day. Then, we move off somewhere else. Quiet. Calm. Count our caps. Eat meat and get you some greens forever. One day...*
---
Oooh can I get one named Beethoven?
---
It starts a new quest
---
That is the only silver lining. But personally, I think they need to double down on what people like about the game. Burrows was interesting, but definitely not a challenging dungeon. Sheepsquatch and the imposter event was really cool, but just amounts to more farming for very little pay off. I've killed that fucker what feels like hundreds of times, always get shit legendaries.
---
I think it charges quicker but not sure
---
He might not have even meant to drink them all, it is a new interface.
---
Tried to find video on YouTube and didn’t find
---
My understanding is that things you leave in stashes stays there.  Maybe not forever, but it's there for a while.  If you discard items - drop them and leave your little paper bag laying on the ground - when you leave the server that stuff is gone.  That's why you sometimes find bags, but when you search them - nothing.
---
I'm sure someone probably knows the exact game mechanics, so feel free to clarify this or correct me!
---
It’s most likely because you might have moved your green camp box to a different location  while building. For some reason if you place your camp in an appropriate zone, start building, then at some point move your  green camp box to a location where you originally couldn’t place your camp, it’ll give you that alert about the update and having to move your camp. If you’ve gotten it, there’s no way to undo that. However, just knowing about it will save you from having to go through this issue again. You can still build there, but leave the green camp box alone. Or if you do move the box, check and see that it’s an appropriate location you could normally place your camp. Then you should be able to keep your camp there.
---
I 100% agree but everyone else here thinks that putting turrets on the ghoul spawns at Whitesprings is "stealing kills" from people, all of whom apparently can't figure out anything better to do.
---
PS I've never actually put a camp there but it's mostly because I just don't care. I think it's a totally legit tactic and most people are probably just mad that they can't do it if someone else already has a camp there.
---
Careful, now they'll add irons to the Atom shop
---
thanks that looks like some good fun there!
---
I feel like the only YouTuber that would know is possibly captain noob
---
Thanks! I’ll do that! I’ve become a gamer mom 😂😂😂 and it’s awesome!
---
Of course that I have encountered before. We did the SBQ event and a higher level led me to it and he left us to kill it. I guess he genuinely just wanted us to get the XP for it. But thank you for your comment!
---
I'm a lvl 187 and still dont get bored. I do a lot if the events on the map. I do have my 'route'. I start out in Whitesprings then go to the cranberry bog and go through all the fissure sites killing scorched beasts. That never gets old for me! I used to run away from them but now I love the challenge.
---
Oh, wack
---
He did, he had one, sat down on my couch then went back and chugged the rest one after another
---
So cube it?
---
I used to the recent double xp weekend to start a pistol alt so this has been very encouraging, genuinely thank you.
---
I have heaps ranged explosives shooters but nothing cool like handmades and shotguns. Magazines, shielded under armors, and stable flux take up most of my inventory. We need player vending asap.
---
Lol, I'm crying.   😂   Sorry, and thank you for sharing.  I needed that.
---
Buh bye
---
Don't think so, ps4 bogs pretty good from loading everything.  My guess was that the speed of travel caused the game to try loading more then it could handle.
---
So
---
Abbbbbe? Abe! Abe!
---
Had my camp here not too long ago, it’s a great spot! Nice camp!
---
Devs need to lock this function up tight
---
I believe it's a bear sitting on its butt, and it's head is looking up and to its right. If you REALLY zoom in on it, it's a bit easer to see the nose on the left side (or the outline of it), about 2 pixels of slightly different browns are its ears on the right side, and you can see the main black dot as its eye (and you can see a few black pixels towards the top of where the other side of its head is, that could indicate its other eye).
---
The actual image of it is more than likely bigger, but due to shrinking it down to this size to be a small icon on the map, it's not very detailed as a result.
---
The only answer here that matters. Dropping your Power Armor down there and getting in it prevents you from dying as long as you don’t move. You can grab your stuff then jump out or you can  jump on top of your placed Power Armor and grab your loot
---
Bloody mess. It's the best perk for every build. 
---
After that, the cards that correspond to your preferred weapon: slugger, gladiator or iron fist.
---
After that, barbarian if you don't do power armor. 
---
Then party boy/girl, and a big case of booze. 
---
After that is get pretty diffuse depending upon taste.
---
*America intensifies*
---
Yeah I feel this man, however I only ever get Super Mutants spawning inside my camp though, never animals, don't know why
---
Cool. Thanks man
---
What
---
Agreed also the amount of nerfs they have done to different endgame weapons and lowering the drop rate of legendaries have made a continuous grind for weapons. I got my two shot explosive hand made that one to two shot everything in nuke zones and a month later they nerfed it to where it took about 20-30 shots to kill a level 50 glowing one. Which meant I had to go and grind for more xp and new legendaries to redo a new class almost would have been faster to just make a new character if I didn’t want to have a useless main.
---
__There is a house cat taxedermy head on the way, does that count?__
---
I knew I was not crazy
---
Legendary purveyor may solve your ills.
---
Screws are the bane of my handmade rifle-scrapping existence. They’re even rare at vendors.
---
Yeah, if you scroll through the entire in game list of taxedermy heads house cat is one of the last along with normal dog. Just like the ones on the second floor of the taxedermy house.
---
Half man, half cow, half sheep.
---
Did you accidentally build your camp directly on a spawn area?
---
I did this a while back. Always came home to radstags in my house.
---
Hmm...incisor might come before the booze cards, though I've always been a fan of a "bash, bash, bash...bash some more" technique which alcohol fueled rage compliments nicely.
---
Yes you are right. But thats what it was from and they do give out sometimes but that was also SBQ fight. But i have gotten a few okay drops but like everything else..sometimes its drops a beast.
---
Grahm has it.. just as rare as the x01 jetpack and stealthboy. Goodluck!
---
Also, I think it’s a bug with workshops. After it’s contested, you’re red to that player or their team until you change servers, even if you don’t seek revenge.
---
&gt;!Thought this whole comment thread was joke "suggestions". Guess not judging by the downvotes I'm getting.!&lt;
---
are you onn PC?.. can I have your good loot and junk?
---
Try the legendary strangler queen she drops good stuff and alot of other loot as well
---
I agree. I also used to use martial artist but with 40% swing speed grognak it’s not needed. I get way ahead of myself
---
Don't feel stupid! This background to your character is well thought out and very interesting! I love the little details you gave your character!
---
Pretty sure iron extracts ore that you refine into steel.
---
Bye. So sick of these posts. Good riddance.
---
Thanks for all the tips! I’m GiGiMcK on PS 👍🏻
---
You did it
---
I don't want to give out spoilers unless you directly ask for them. It's at Sugar grove but it is one of the most complicated quests so reply if you want it spoiled.
---
After using shotguns for 100+ levels, I know how they work. The range is actually surprisingly good with the right weapon mods, and I don’t use a suppressor. The only issue with the range on my shotgun is that I can’t do damage when she’s flying, which is where I swap to my grenade launcher and spam vats shots. And, for the record, the M79 grenade launcher has surprisingly good vats accuracy, so my grenade spam rarely misses unless she flies away from the group. 
---
Really not sure how I’m supposed to do significantly more damage than I already am, aside from going bloodied which I don’t want to do.
---
I returned an T-60 fully moded to its owner a few days ago.
---
But you can't scrap legendary weapons, so why would this even be a factor?
---
Strike from the sky Brothers!
---
This is Twis7ed Physics and man lol cool story bro.. Sorry for anyone that got into it with this guy over me and thanks for defending good play gg on you guys..the true story is I was afk ammo farming busy with family and life and this guy kept spamming msgs that I'm cheating.. Never thought setting up traps was cheating but ok..he then started to exploit threw the building to destroy my generator lol so I killed him everytime he did so.. 1shot in power armor btw😙...did that about 10x.. Then it was bbq time with family so I went the the roof maintenance room on the roof and sat there until I came back.. Took about a hour..i come back to the xbox and this guy is still spamming me msgs saying I'm going to get banned this and that and still in the building contesting the ws.. He destroyed everything big bounty..he then msgs me hey big guy I have this really big bounty I dare you to come get it..so I go back in and kill him take the bounty.. He said in this thread he had no caps but he did.. I took alot..but after the "big bounty" kill he left and messaged me like 20x more saying I'm reporting you here and there.. So I asked him.. My first response.. to all his spam was about atleast 50-70 messages..was.."umadbro?"and then I received another 50msg.. I never commented back to any of them besides that one time...the end.. I don't get this game sometimes.. This game has a great community but lurking in the shadows is this really ugly side a elitest egotistical evil that thinks I have a Tse I'm the best and you are trash at my feet but when they get 1shot from a not so perfect pvp system everyone is cheating and want to curse you and your loved ones for playing the game.. I'm pretty sure if this guy bumped into me IRL that day he probably would be in jail.. That's how upset he was.. And that's a very scary thought...ive never seen a dark side of a gaming community act this way ever but ive had email threats Facebook stalkers people calling my cell I don't know when I'm with family threating me...i dont get it i just play the game i never duped or exploited the game.. I just like to claim ws and pvp sometimes.. It's part of the game in both adventure and survival... So I don't know what's wrong here but I see why alot of people quit playing this and giving it such bad word to mouth to everyone that dosnt play it.. I hope things change and Beth does somthing one day about this type of toxic play
---
Or just put a / in front, it'll default to the end.
---
There is a thing called don't play on Survival if you don't want to get one shotted. Or if you're on the normal game mode don't start combat with people that are op.
---
For me, its literally everything. I'll have the door closed and locked and I'll hear it open and turn around to see a firefly, chicken, opossum, or even once, a radstag walking through my door.
---
Yeah you either have the "diablo looter"  mindset or you dont
---
Molerats eating through block of solid concrete then goes through solid concrete to escape...lol
---
Yes but actually no. The spawn is close to my base, just down the hill, but they wander into my house.
---
So fair to assume lead is the only scrap one now?
---
I've never seen anyone walk into my camp, they're only ever there when I spawn on it. Maybe it's time to move to Seneca Rocks??
---
Cheeky bleeders. Time to fill the house with land mines. No other choice.
---
Strange you have issues and my friends and I have none, that’s why I think it’s something else. All this was on PS4, not sure what could be different from us to you
---
I would, if I didn't love my location on the map.
---
Normally that's true, but it seems that you may be able to with this bug based on the other reports and video of it happening. The video is of a guy scrapping a power armor piece, but other reports were for weapons/armor. In the video the guy was scrapping a bunch of weapons but somehow his power armor got scrapped when he wasn't even in the armor tab.
---
Which is why it would be nice if OP replied with more info so we can find out if the two are linked.
---
If you still looking, hopewell cave has them, hit them in 2-5 tries, super easy. Also spent over 1 hour at other locations with no luck.
---
Basically.
---
There are definitely tamable cats and dogs in the game. You should server hop at the random encounter spot just North of Braxton's Qualidty Medical Supplies (near the crashed plane)
---
Over 800 hours, level 171, learned early on to use the trade market.. not everyone wants tse, and who knows how many gems you could have sold or traded towards getting what you want?
---
I myself have every tse weapon I could possibly want, every weapon I could want really.. only one I never got was a tse flamer, but I got an executioner's explosive flamer, and that's good enough for me. Trading is what makes it all possible, and building good relationships along the way is great too!
---
Omg. The times ive lagged out and placed a parquetry floor the wrong way! Spend ages making a stair bridge to take the whole floor down and start again. 
---
I get this wont fix that issue but hopefully it will make rebuilding faster.
---
Yes, implement this Bethesda. Then I'll build a giant gladiatorial cage around the spawn point and make visitors fight for my amusement. Winner gets some scraps of molerat and a lot of drugs.
---
Not sure why you assume I’m running into the event. I’m there when it starts. You have several minutes to fast travel there beforehand.
---
Crafting ammo isn’t hard, no. I probably wasted 50+ grenades and hundreds of shotgun shells. The queen occasionally gets bugged out, and I walk right up to her and unload my anti armor shotgun with anti armor mods directly into her face for almost a minute straight. No loot. 
---
If the issue is that I’m not doing “enough” damage, even though I’m fully specced into shotguns and explosives, know how they work, and utilized them effectively for the entirety of the fight, then it needs to be changed. Or, if it’s just bugged, then it needs to be fixed.
---
Yeah, game was broke when it released
---
I'm 125 and missing all level up achievements
---
You need to make an alt
---
I try to role play as my character and have a code, respect the people chivalry, helpout with quests even load em up with loot and what not. But its really hard when someone spawn kills you or sneaks into your work shop and contendkills you or just straight up harasses you for PvP.... Its not fun.
---
If someone asked me to PvP while i was building i would send a team request and send them a message telling them to help build a battle area......but no they sneak kill people and make em rage cause thats fun. Also at the same time someone's misery can be someone elses enjoyment.....fucked up people we are.
---
I'm now trying to minimize my stash to the point that i can collect more suits. Weird thing happened today. I hadn't played much this past week and found a full set of t50 with the ultracite skin in my inventory today. No idea where it came from
---
Oooooof. Thank you
---
No, I sell lead and steel to other players and make  caps that way. If they’re farming caps from other players, that won’t last long if we all stop taking over workshops.
---
Thank you. I have got as far as needing to upload the holotape data back at Riverside Manor...now can't locate the Siphon holotape in my Inventory
---
Praise Mothman!
---
I built my camp around a radroach spawn, great to have free meat since I'm afflicted w the Carnivore mutation
---
I was under the impression they made it impossible to build certain areas of Whitesprings because of this issue. I build all of my camps on resource locations. What spawns there doesn't matter. But one location that constantly spawns a scortchbeast does prove difficult.
---
Dude I just hit 128 on my char from beta(started a new one once it went live and got it to lvl58 with SHIT perks so I went back). After messing up and realizing how to utilize perks I  have had a blast. I just finally got goodish weapons(i dont buy or use the marketplace, only random encounters) and a halfway decent set of metal armor. I can face tank lvl91 glowing deathclaws only now and I still need help. I understand the game can be a grind but just keep finding that slightly better varient or finally a legendary for a suit I don't have yet. I run uranium fever and horde events whenever possible to level up. Make sure your utilising as many of the free xp buffs you can but events man. Over and over. I always enjoy the challenge of doing one voilent night, only you kill everything unarmed not just the wendigo. Make the game a challenge once you break it. Gets really fun then.
---
I've always seen a dead Alpha Deathclaw's body at the Fissure Site West of Prime.  Took a pic of that one for today's daily.
---
The only thing I remember about achievements being wiped was all of them from the beta were. Based on your level I would say that wasn't the issue unless you took a few months off.
---
Since they went x86 seems like it's brought in many of the issues from PC.  Anthem, fallout, WWZ, heck a good half of the recent games ive plaurd had a bunch of ps4 ctd'd reported on the subs.
---
It might be called something else like research data or something
---
Go via your inventory, find any holotape with the quest diamond, load that in and see if it'll take
---
Most likely sold by another player. Lots have been hoarding for legendary vendor and have run out of room even on alts. Ive been dumping alot of 2-3 star heavy weapons (cryo,flamers,missle launchers) to creat e more space lately. Mostly a witesprings station though.
---
Curious they sold that armor though. Would go well with a sneeky vats build, good find!
---
Do you go to the shack to start it?
---
Can I have your ammo?
---
I love when radstags spawn by mine, because butchers bounty lets me harvest double and even triple the meat gain.
---
Environmental storytelling. Bethesda are masters of it.
---
Occasionally good items ( 3 star ) show up at vendors. Before I sold a heap of quality armor because I thought I would always stay in power armor.
---
Now I;m searching for preferably 3 star pieces. Players will sell their 3 star items if they feel they have no use for them. I don't think they originate with the vendor.
---
My biggest issue is the "Locate Stealhboy" quest still being active, yet I've been to the marker and found the stealth boy and have it in my Inventory
---
Can't hurt to open a ticket and link the video, if this is a real issue they need to be made aware.
---
Ok. I didn't realize you were that far. 
---
Despite having done the quest again in the last month I'm not positive but it might be called something else after downloading thr program, I just don't recall what. Other than that I'm out of ideas.
---
Whereabouts are you?
---
Can confirm
---
It would be so nice if the Chinese invaded after the nuclear winter update and the scorched went away. One can dream.
---
same for armor. Took me forever to figure out why my camo-painted combat pieces never showed up at the vendor.
---
I noticed this when I tried to sell some armor I painted. Had to paint it back to standard before I could.
---
I'm under the electrical tower smack between Gregs mine, Horizons Rest, and the Relay tower.
---
They may have fixed it, but that's the historical reason anyway.
---
I wish mobs obeyed rules of access the way we do. Was on the top floor of for defiance (I think, whichever one is the mental ward with all the laser grids). Stupid ghouls kept attacking me... after apparently doing the quest to become an army recruit, going through the dmv to get an ID, and becoming a brotherhood recruit. Then passing the security grids and using the elevator. Tenacious fucks.
---
True. I thought about editing that in but didn't.
---
I don’t see how this would solve my issue. I don’t have any trouble getting xp. The issue is either that I’m not doing enough damage to the queen for it to count, or explosives don’t work, or it’s just bugged. Or some combination of those. Doing less damage so that I can freeze her just exacerbates the issue. 
---
I switch to support any time the queen leaves my grenade launcher vats range. Honestly, I’m usually running around like a madman trying to do as much as I can to help in any big event, but without ever neglecting dps. I’m really not sure how I could do significantly more without swapping builds.
---
Gotta amend that. I'm an idiot. I have a full set of ultracite from nowhere at all. I didn't make it and i can't imagine finding it
---
I was doing the monster mash event in excavator power armor. When I equipped the mask I lost the carry weight bonus and was over-encumbered, so I dropped my (first) junkie’s guass rifle, exc. Gatling gun, and (most painfully) zealot’s Gatling plasma in trash cans nearby. Of course the game crashed and (insult to injury) I found out the monster mash is a pretty worthless event.
---
EXACTLY @ BETHESDA GIVE THIS MAN A JOB
---
Ultimately, the same as rifles. And you can do stealth at queen with the right legendaries, perks and nuke placement.
---
I get legendary drops just from the event i got a 2* assassins for showing up when she died.....
---
I don’t think this is my issue, but I guess I’ll try it along with a random non-explosive ranged weapon. I’ll try anything that sounds like it will work :/
---
Please tell me that he's a melee build and you plan on using axes only.
---
And that you plan on running to Helvetia immediately for the civil war suit and hat.
---
How do you check your achievements on XB1 ?
---
Unfortunately, I guess it got drowned out in a mass of memes or something. Hats off to you for it regardless though. I've never experienced this so I didn't have much to believe about the bug until I saw videos
---
PlayStation for me has quite a few people, with lower lvls being more typical
---
Wow, you just made me realize i'm playing Reddit Edition too. :(
---
Press the logo, scroll to the trophy, go under Fallout 76.
---
Some items like resource collectors will do that. If half of it is inside the line. I have had houses that were moved set party outside the line but couldn't place another object in that spot. Like a turent on a deck that went over.
---
Damn it Todd you've done it again.
---
You're not too far from me actually I'm at the bridge between Summersville and Tygart Water Treatment. It's a good central area with not too many high level enemies to ruin the camp. But it has got to the point where I now keep 3 turrets inside now haha
---
Do not harm the Möth
---
Yeah, same. I get the occasional level 15 enemy but its usually small critters.
---
Hey man thanks! [Here's an art blog](https://pumpkinpirate.tumblr.com/), and [here's my twitter](https://twitter.com/pokepaws) if your interested!
---
we need a lock option for renamed gear iv done this also
---
&gt; It’s not really a rumor
---
If it’s not just a rumor, then what evidence do you have that suggests this?
---
Are you on ps4?  Don't think I can shield it for you, but definitely can craft ya one
---
Claimed the Poseidon Plant workshop to make fusion cores. A team of 2 attacked it, tracked it down, and killed me.
---
Bye
---
Only use .50 rounds.
---
I've not played for a while honestly but I've only bumped into him a couple of times myself. Spent ages going about the map on his usual routes trying to find him once, only to come across him stuck in a fight with some scorchbeasts haha
---
I bought that as soon as I had seen it released. I had been planning to ever since I had seen some of the data mined stuff. I actually prefer not hiding my armor with outfits so I'm ok with it being underarmor. Just a little bummed it's a bit bulky, looks ok on my one character but the one with the marine armor looks like she added 15lbs.
---
I don't notice any difference on the one that I have. It fires faster without charging but the fire rate doesn't seem to effect charge time. 
---
Basically like finding a black powder rifle with 25% fire rate. It's useless. It's amazing how Bethesda eliminated OP rolls like a quad black powder but decided to leave useless rolls in the loot pool for their skinner box.
---
He sounds like...someone...a tv personality...but can’t quite remember who it is...
---
You can have all the one million chameleon wood right arms I have.
---
I just put garden plants along the edge. They make nice targets. Keeps the mutants off my collectors.
---
Here's hoping.
---
Farewell!
---
There seems to be a more active trading scene for PS4, going by the number of posts on the market subreddits. But as to which is more populated? No idea. If your PC isn't too flash, there will likely be noticeable stuttering and crashes to desktop. PS4 isn't issue free either, but I believe most of the bigger problems are history now. There isn't a demo to check playability either. Which makes the decision a little harder.
---
Lol i just want to be able to see the outfit I payed 700 atoms ⚛️ for instead of hiding it under my armor and outfit
---
That’s Chally The MooMoo to you!
---
He's a nice break from the loneliness sometimes, even just a different set of sounds to hear haha
---
Really wish I could find the original reddit post, I'm sure the voice actor commented as well but don't quote me on it!
---
I will don't worry!
---
Great.....Another useless rifle that isn't a handmade or lever action.
---
I usually get contend killed But i dont fight back i wave at them than they shoot me again. Like dont even buy me dinner before railing me. holy jeepers. 
---
BUT if you hold down the build button in build range you can contend it from anywhere in range. Hense me usually getting sneak attacked.
---
Honestly I feel like he’s just trying to find the means to settle down peacefully and live his life in happiness
---
Haha I was rolling when I read this.
---
They should change it to you put one type of drink in there and guests can drink from it an infinite amount of times.
---
At least you’re only missing the level 10 one xD
---
I need to commit all the way to 50 on an alt, haha
---
(I think there was a L50 achievement?)
---
Now I gotta do a John Wilkes Booth character that specializes in one handed semi auto pistols 🤔
---
Even after a thousand posts like this, it still is a mystery why people have to announce, that they quit. Seriously, who the fuck cares, just leave already.
---
I may be Brotherhood and any muties i see need to be nothing more than a bloody pulp on the ground.... except the Mothman.
---
You don't fuck with Mothman.
---
Ad Victoriam. Long live the WVBOS
---
I really don't like how Bethesda implemented legendary weapons and armor that are basically magic into Fallout 4/76.  In my opinion, being able to find and craft different ammo types as well as weapon mods with inherent benefits and drawbacks is more interesting than finding a gun that somehow magically does more damage if you are addicted to chems.
---
Exploration is one of the best things about this game, finding new plans and searching for rare materials would play to the game's strengths, not just running laps around Whitesprings shooting ghouls for a better magical item.
---
Fuck
---
I think this is coming in next weeks patch
---
Congratulations 👍
---
That's a result of the way the game was written. It doesn't reward community building. Very few events reward teamwork. The loot and shoot is what Bethesda made it into. They have dropped the ball on Fallout 76. Now they seem ready to turn it into P2W. That will be the end.
---
Yeah it fixed itself when I hopped but it went on or a long time until I got tired of it.
---
I agree with you, OP, I think the PvP mechanics of workshops are jacked up. I am disinterested in PvP but I am interested in taking workshops for the XP and resources. I should be able to accept the risk of PvP when I want to and if the workshop is contested by another player, I should be able to relinquish control if I don't want to fight and have the PvE mechanics kick back in. 
---
I enjoy some reasonable PvP in workshops, but the fact that I get one-shot killed almost every time makes the whole ordeal worthless.
---
I thought it was a couple of patches ago, I couldn't even defend myself
---
Nice work. Kick ass...
---
Black powder build hype
---
Ranger Outfits are worth a bit of caps as well
---
My opinion on this game is very conflicted, and I'm generally not pessimistic. I'd like to see if others have experienced the same, and if they have any advice or words of encouragement to reinvigorate my interest.
---
Yeah, us pacifists still have the danger of other players destroying our camps. I've kept my camp in a low populated spot because of this. I'll be glad when this is fixed.
---
Power armor does not possess any legendary prefixes. what is better? magic armor that blocks 75% damage if you are standing still, or chunks of metal?
---
He's not wrong though
---
I would think unyielding is more beneficial for melee (+15 str!) But the dr boost would aid a rifleman more...but I'm often wrong.
---
"How many times did I tell you, you DO NOT destroy the camp unless it's next to the golf course. And what did you do?"
---
It isn't, the hop on for the trail would be directly East of Harpers Ferry, just a stones throw away down the railroad tracks that disappear as you reach the border of the map. Unfortunately, the map ends RIGHT where the AT would likely be located.
---
I made a looooong post many months ago involving trail content, upgrades, and incorporating the AT as the "finale" for that content. Hell, even a Pip-boy game called Appalachian Trail, which would be a direct rip off of Oregon Trail but using Vault Boy aesthetic instead. 
---
There's a trail/hiking nerd in charge of a lot of content stuff. Self professed wannabe woodland trail hermit.
---
I have a strong suspicion that it'll work its way in game. If someone on the dev team knows the "Cover your water bottle in stickers from all of the trails you've been on" aesthetic and slapped it on that data mined pip boy, then I guarantee its on the radar.
---
Just gotta keep hoping!
---
Lol YESS!!! I wanted to do this but with Teddy Roosevelt and make him a melee build and wack fools with a big stick lol
---
Agreed. I have sold All Rise once and bought it back. My first character dropped it on the ground and was lost forever forcing me to restart. There needs to be a way to lock the items. I lost a Cowboy hat during a button mashing session when I dropped it on accident when I thought I was reloading my gun.
---
Wow, downvoted into oblivion for calling out the truth? Did I fall asleep and wake up in the other sub?
---
The real question is, have you cleaned out someone else's stash yet?
---
Nice job!
---
One thing I forget to do is turn back on pacifist after survival, mabey he just got lucky in finding you with pacifist off.
---
Also could be you had a workshop. Because of how the game is set up alot of people see that as consent or an invitation for pvp.
---
I haven't had much of a chance with the new camera, but here's a few I took with the old cam.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Po0zwBL](https://imgur.com/a/Po0zwBL)
---
You couldn't defend yourself because you had pacifist mode on. Pacifist mode only takes away your ability to damage other players
---
I watched a sheepsquatch battle 4 fog crawlers, I tagged everyone and just watched while chameleoned up, only had to finish off the squatch with 1/4 his health left
---
Fuck yeah!
---
I'm right next to Morgan town, but never had any grief till now
---
I don't necessarily blame you. Lol
---
Partial reason why Link was my favorite video game character growing up. That and I was a little blonde kid. 
---
I felt so catered to ;\_;
---
Rifles and melee
---
Ummm you could.
---
I have went the many times but the quest never triggers. Just gotta keep server hopping i guess, if that even works anymore.
---
Yes for every lever action there’s probably 100 legendary rollins dropped in loot, so if they let us exchange rolling pins for token and same tokens can be used to acquire top tier level actions, the chance to get top tier lever action will increase tremendously, like 100 fold. Same with all other god tier weapons and armors. This will surely cheapen god tier legendaries. Good deal for us rolling pin hoarders for sure.
---
Someone does apparently lol
---
Gatling plasma benefits from the accuracy,  stagger, and damage heavy weapon perks.
---
I have gotten to the point where that makes me run outside and start shooting. Hopefully I remember to jump into my armor first.
---
I see a volunteer here......lol
---
lol
---
Same. If they want the workshop, I’m fine with that. Let’s fight for it. Hell, I may not even contest it—workshops are also kind of a pain in the ass when you need to constantly defend them from random enemies. I wouldn’t mind handing that off to someone else sometimes. 
---
It’d be nice to have a set timer for how long you have to contest it before it becomes yours and then PvE is turned on for the former owner.
---
It takes just one jerk. I've only had mine destroyed once. I was out in the waste and came back to find it demolished and two guys with a hefty wanted level. The second time, some ass came and started destroying while I was there. I took off pacifist and wasted him.
---
I know how it works, just thought they patched it in by now.
---
First time he killed me we were fighting in a workshop I get that but the second time he killed me was when I went to get a supply drop I called in. He met me at the supply drop and killed me before I could loot it.
---
I always check every vendor when I go to whitesprings. I've found some of my best gear this way. What platform you on? You selling that chest piece? 😉
---
No way to trigger it but server hop lol
---
I just got a email on April 29 saying,
---
"Greetings,
---
We are making final preparations to ship your replacement Power Armor Edition Canvas Bag, however we have been unable to verify your shipping address.
---
Please provide the following information before Friday, May 3 to ensure your bag can be properly shipped:"
---
So maybe soon?
---
You’re right. I always forget about the contractor perk. Will remind myself to turn that on next time!
---
Hic, haec, hoc, brother.
---
Because some people don't use the armor in a way that suits it. Putting a number of perk points on the correct perks and you can use your armor as a battering ram and run into mobs, or using the correct mods to become a point man for your team with Recon helmet and a good sniper rifle. Using the armored player as an explosive man, blowing up cars around the golf course buildings to bring out the ghouls. I enjoy my PA. Each to their own style I guess.
---
I don't think your explaining yourself correctly. I think you mean mesh it to expand the build area and budget as well as build together. 
---
Because another player can build in your area, you just have to be in a team. I built a bed in a friends camp so she wouldn't get disease from sleeping on the ground because she didn't have the plans yet.
---
best method in the event is a camp attack is ALT+F4 on PC. its faster then clicking "leave server" 
---
last time i got attacked i was with some chums, i did that in a heart beat and the damage was minimal. my friends told me they cried about not being able to destroy my camp completely
---
Eating government cheese!
---
Lol sadly you're not crazy.... well about this I don't know you so I won't rule it out JK I'm sure you're cool. 
---
Anyways in about an hour or two I'll be able to post a better quality vid on youtube and I'll update the post with a link and submit a support ticket. I just needed the better vid before doing so.
---
Yeah, I'll re umm I'll re type it.
---
I can craft burning, burning barbed, and poisoned staffs. I think I have poisoned staff plans, I’ll check when I get home. 
---
Also, I can craft Burning, Burning Barbed, electric, and heavy sheepsquatch clubs too.
---
Just sucks getting one shot durring pve and the guy dosent even get a bounty. I didnt wanna lose my workshop :(
---
I don't get on every day
---
The irony is I only turned it on recently as I knew the patch was coming out.
---
"Walked right into that Imperial ambush."
---
&gt;kill a wendigo in a clown costume 
---
Lmao I'm over lvl 150 and still haven't done this. I'm not the only one.
---
I accidentally drop my expensive weapons more often than I’m proud to admit. One of these days I’m gonna really piss myself off and lose it.
---
I wish others would do my work for me.
---
Which country do you live in if you don’t mind me asking ?
---
"You did it! Congratulations! World best cup of coffee!"
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on? Sometimes a power cycle helps with assets not loading properly. Also, if that doesn't work you may have to move your camp.
---
US.
---
Blackpowder by chance ;)?
---
That’s just stupid though. I can make a ton of caps selling lead and aluminum to other players. I think they just want to hunt people down.
---
If only they had wheelchair mounts I'd whip up a Franklin!
---
ya right i know , but better then "the game should do things like this" or i wish devs did things MY way
---
"If I were two-faced, would I be wearing this one?" -Abe

---
On PC fallout 3 an NV have so many mods available you can literally replay the game several times and it will be a whole new experience each time. I lost track of how many times I played those games.
---
Every freaking time. It's happened mid sentence multiple times too. And I thought it was blue screen ™!!!
---
Settlements would be great 
---
thats one reason I'd like to the fallout 76 map expanded 
---
But Fix  The Server Issues And Disconnects First
---
So.....why did they make nuking the Whitespring a giant shoot fish in the barrel loot cave?
---
Ha what a baby. He or she only got 2 water purifiers and a rocket launcher, think I got lucky.
---
I’m in Uk and I just checked and I haven’t had any emails from Bethesda about the bag :(
---
If you owned a workshop you were doing pvp. There is a pop-up that you agreed to when claiming the workshop
---
Did you still have the workshop? He might have initiated pvp again and stalked you. 🤷‍♂️
---
Well workshops are pvp events besides that pa really is more pve focused. Pvp is all about legendary armour and explosive shotguns with mutations. Pvp is extremely unbalanced in every way tbh.
---
Now you just need a Washington, Jefferson, and Roosevelt to team up with.
---
It's like the Odd Couple! With entrails!!!
---
Upvoted for lever rifle!
---
Steel and lead deposits give scrap not ore
---
Have you tried Green Man gaming? I bought mine for 500 Argentine pesos on release date. Ultra cheap
---
I can’t remember but that is a possibility. In the end I blocked the guy anyways so I hope I don’t see him again.
---
Way too realistic for Bethesda. Their motto is. If it makes sense don't do it.
---
Pretty close where the Scorchbeasts come out, pretty sure right next to the fissure, to the right of the cavern on the rocks. You might need to do the transponders to get it to spawn. The transponders around watogo and the bog. There are 4 of them.
---
Pretty sure they post it on the Bethesda 76 website. I saw a list of sales and free items with the last patch notes
---
Usually all I have to do is make a few fat jokes or how big her butt has gotten....
---
Kidding aside, the only thing you can do is server hop or try to be in the area at night. It seems to pop more often if the area is populated. (That's only speculation, physical proof or anything)
---
Level 40?
---
I remember my first beer
---
Dude, hydration is a vital part of a strong body!
---
Nice build :)
---
Unless it's changed, iron extractor gives steel scrap.
---
When I fell in I couldn’t even find a place to properly get out of my power armor.
---
But can i put a 600 mil lens on my pro snap?
---
Pretty sure you have to activate about 3 transponders before you enter the cavern.
---
I read somewhere a suggestion that we have player plots to build a town on the gold course but have a travel camp that was literally a camp to use while you explored an area.
---
Most people with 1,000+ hours in Fallout 4 were trying out multiple builds with multiple different weapons. Something that you can't do in 76 because the legendary loot system is designed to be the end game content.....a skinner box.
---
There is a little path but even so, I died because I couldn't find a place the first time. So frustrating.
---
Got it on my first world went to grab some booze and it was done already...
---
A burning staff sounds good to me how much do you want
---
It is such be. Also its so dark in the water you can’t even see where you are going.
---
The charred ghouls are the worst 
---
those things start slapping you around and the game wont let you  move away easily 
---
and they do massive rad damage 
---
as well as spawning in groups of 6 or 7 now
---
I am aware of that.  My point was more just griping about the shit loot no matter what I kill.  My apologies for being unclear.
---
