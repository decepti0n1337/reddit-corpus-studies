Are you gatekeeping the Fo76 subreddit? Even though im using it correctly, to ask a question involving the game. 
---

---
You are sad.
---
---
---
I'm sorry :'(
---
I mean why not, right? These people are very open to spending money, why not fleece them for more?
---
For the life off me I don't know why they don't have toilet and bathtubs that aren't fucked to hell.
---
Since its release I never bought it and never noticed not having it affecting any game play.
---
Not at all sure what's the purpose of other than it causing one to just waste more time.
---
[removed]
---
Let's me honest here. It's all semantics anyhow. Nothing is micro with the microtransactions in the Atom Store.
---
It‚Äôs busted
---
Only works with the flip switch
---
Broke my whole camp with that shit
---
Had one entry door with the key pad, had to rework everything to include a side door as a work around -_-
---
It's pretty rare for anyone with a Tesla to get close enough to kill me ever since they nerfed the range.  My sniper build let's me kill well from range and my aim isnt too shabby on PC.
---
Yeah it is
---
Fuck... they backed down and made it free.
---
I did a Line In The Sand event with a guy that had his mic on. He was blasting Whitesnake - Here I Go Again while blowing shit up with a rocket launcher the whole time. Was awesome.
---
Easily the coolest guy I've randomly come across. Gave him a thumbs up emote and went to search for my red asylum dress after the event.
---
Shit, they backed down and made it free...
---
Ive never seen this happen.  What platform?
---
I don‚Äôt really have any problems with the game. At 600 hours I‚Äôm looking forward to new quests with wastelanders. I‚Äôm a little afraid that it will somehow lose the multiplayer feel with all the instancing but we‚Äôll see how they execute. I‚Äôd also like to see more maps in NW that rotate each playthrough and the ability to spend more time exploring vault 51.
---
As of right now. Items that go missing cant be recalled unless you move the whole camp.........
---
You know... it just works....
---
So you want to take our ideas and make money off them through ad revenue? How Bethesda of you.
---
What? 
---
PC? I've never seen this happen on XB.
---
Ha! It's funny because it costs money. 
---
Give this kid the Platinum.
---
I think the surprise is how pathetic the first exclusive atom shop item is.
---
Costume vs armor.
---
He smells scrap

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Who cares? Don‚Äôt buy it then... Save your atoms for something else.
---
It‚Äôs like the statues in Elder Scrolls Online, you can only get them with ESO+ which nobody seems to have been upset about when they first started doing that.. you never know they might release these outfits to non-subscribers for significantly more than $5 later down the line
---
Seems like you care.
---
I fucking wish dude, I have 25 subs, and am nowhere close to monetization
---
Can you imagine how itchy that is?
---
Macrotransactions are the new microtransactions.
---
Aside from the Fallout 1st drama the game is in a decent enough place for a new player, IMO.
---
I dropped the game about a week after launch and came back in early October. I've had a lot of fun.
---
Now actually is a decent enough tone to come back. If you're not having fun wait for wastelanders.
---
Not sure why the paint is costing some people 500 atoms. It was listed as free for me.
---
Oh well. All the best with the video then. Make sure to post it here when you're done.
---
Thanks for the info. I was planning on using them as exterior stairs to my base, but will now look at my camps to see if it‚Äôs worth it. What‚Äôs the other item if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
---
I really don‚Äôt... I don‚Äôt have a subscription. I don‚Äôt see the big deal i complaining about a digital outfit that you can just not buy if you don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs a video game.
---
You might imagine that, but in the real world radiation protection means tons of lead.  To keep it short -- no, a real spacesuit gives no radiation protection at all.
---
Could be neat, but they need to make them work with hats first
---
I'd agree if it wasn't reposted. People may have responded to the first but not.the second. Obviously the general vibe here is that 1st is bad. 
---
There's Les overlap in this forum and players than most naively think. There's other subs with their own culture. Which can't be discussed here for whatever shitass reason. But even the hardcore community is much larger than this particular sub.
---
The skin was free for me. Not sure if they changed it in the past few hours or what but I got it for nothing.
---
ah ok cool ..
---
lol must of been a site to see ..  although I must say probably not his fault, unlimited stash and unlimited meat cleavers ... how fun ..
---
I guess they are reasoning that the scrap box wouldn't negatively affect server stability much since not everyone on a server will own Fallout 1st.
---
best comment I've read all day :P
---
Which is a bannable offense, RMT(Real Money Trading.)
---
Because fallout 1rst didnt execute it well like other games could, I dunno stop wasting your time with fo76 and play puter worlds already
---
Yes
---
The lulz.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I dunno. "maybe they'll charge for it" has become the "ok Boomer" of this sub.
---
Literally every thing that comes to the atom shop after i got fallout first should be free. I don't even want that skin but i deserve it. Infact i should get the entire atom shop for free. Unlike other games that i also payed full price for that i don't even play anymore, this one owes me for the monetary exchange i made a year ago. You brought the nuka cola stash back that i was upset that i missed out on, but it wasn't free Bethesda.. what gives? What's next? You're going to add more skins for items i already own and expect the atom shop to work exactly how it always has?? How dare you. But for real thanks for that nuka cola stash.
---
How long have you owned the game?
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt have a legit claim for a refund and just wanted to be rude to a poor customer service rep.
---
shouldnt have waited a year
---
Have you ever looked at eBay tho!? I always thought, what dumb shit loser would ever pay cash for a tse handmade!? The answer is a lot of dumb shit losers buy their stuff off eBay! You can look at the number of items sold and it‚Äôs staggering. Full sets of armor for 200 bucks! I mean wtf? It blows my mind tbh.
---
/r usernamechecksout
---
TFW you travel to another player's CAMP expecting to shop, and end up getting dysentery instead because the gane spawned you in the water and kept you there during the entire load screen.
---
I don't play elder scrolls online. I don't play any games like it. I play online when it's free to do so... That's it. If I'd known it was going in this direction, I never would have picked it up.
---
&gt; Lastly, try not to allow your emotions to get the better of you, you don‚Äôt know me so don‚Äôt pretend like you do. 
---
Wow. Your projection is showing. I'm just looking at the facts as they're presented and all I saw was someone blindly latching onto anything they could to try and dismiss the results. That's what I based my comments on, nothing more.
---
You don't even address that your general argument goes both ways, affecting the "yes" results as much as the "no"s. Probably because it goes against your narrative of wanting to dismiss the significance of the results. Not to mention arguing about the semantics of my usage of "people" over "votes". Ok, let's go with votes. Still very much statistically significant.
---
Unless you want to continue dismissing it further, as it seems to be your wont.
---
Well... They know you have money and they are going for it. They won't stop here, that's for sure. Fallout 1st was a hit. Now grab your ankles because here comes your papi chulo (Leguizamo dixit).
---
But here is the real takeaway. Even here with all the rage, over 20% admitted to subscribing even if they claim they cancelled or plan on cancelling.
---
You'r a champ. No matter what your results are 40% of the people here will claim everyone one is a subscriber, another 40% will claim no one is a subscriber, 10% will have off topics comments and the rest will just take the data for what it is.
---
God damn you're stupid. ESO+ literally says it INCLUDES DLC. Where the fuck does 1st say that? Yeah.
---
The only ppl getting refunds are ozzies that already tried in the set time.
---
You're just wasting their time and your own.
---
It‚Äôs over
---
Okay thank you I was kinda confused
---
It ended at noon today.
---
Yes. It ended at 12:00 PM EST on November 5.
---
It's free now, its no longer 500 atoms so go get it.
---
12:00 PM EST happens when this comment is 16 hours and 44 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/a3p2T5RnQ

I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM.
---
It's not bad to be passionate about a game but they are aggressively passionate. Nothing wrong with enjoying the game, fun can be found in anything but they seem to want to force everyone to like it without the game improving.
---
Lol I was the one that said yes but I cancelled
---
Pretty sure they changed it recently, saw it for 500 this morning, grabbed it for free right now as well
---
that sounds like a latency issue not a bug, i have never seen that happen
---
Update... as of 1900 Eastern Time the skin is Free to 1st Subscribers.
---
Now I am really interested to hear from anyone that actually payed Atoms to buy it earlier today.  Really.  No sarcasm, did anyone actually buy this before it went 'Free'?
---
Most ppl take issue to devs stating cosmetic only then ther fridge shitting on that.
---
Now fallout 1st is a further step making that early statement a bold face lie.
---
Oh, I agree! Nothing wrong with being passionate about something.  
---
But that dude was just straight up being a dick.
---
I'm pretty sure the refrigerator is statistically inferior to Good With Salt and the refrigerated backpack, not to mention that you physically need to be at your CAMP to access it.
---
telling your SO no is difficult man, I think we all understand
---
What is the point of this post? Have you had the game for a full year and NOW you're refunding it?
---
You might want to provide some context.
---
If you've had the game for over a year and only refunding now, you're like that arsehole that eats most if not all of their meal and then wants a refund because you weren't happy with the standard of quality.
---
If that's the case, you don't deserve a refund.
---
No shit, wonder why they had it for sale in the first place.
---
I literally just watched a youtube video that showed the riot armor green paint for 500 atoms and have seen several people comment about the price  as well. I just logged on and it was free for me?? So did Bethesda back track and make it free because people were pissed or is it just free for SOME people? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Expecting someone to spend 500 atoms or $5 for PAINT on a skin that was given for free for a monthly sub is pretty ridiculous.
---
right, like i'd rather shit in a hole than go through the laborious task of dragging that burdensome diseased detritus into my home!
---
Yeah just went and checked, sure enough it‚Äôs free.
---
XB1, and never been able to do that...and I‚Äôve been downed A Lot üòÇ
---
Scrap is scrap.
---
Gotcha, I was confused why the PSA was directed to FO1st members. Excluding the public server only players from this PSA and have them scrap all their bug parts? :P
---
not so much with facts though
---
The Fireman Helmet isn't unique to the Mischief Night event. You can find it all year round being sold by Cap'N at the Whitespring Resort. You can find him in the shops area.  
---
If he isn't selling the helmet, just server-hop.
---
Awesome!
---
Not bad
---
They need to give more atoms before I‚Äôll subscribe especially after seeing what the atom shop exclusive ended up being. I was really thinking about getting one but they‚Äôre not making it very enticing. I would think they would lead with some good stuff to try and get everyone on board, not the same item tinted green.
---
&gt;The odds of getting rares should increase slightly each time you successfully complete an event.
---
Then nothing would be "rare", because eventually everyone would get every item.  üôÑ
---
I smell a Bethesda PR shill.  Your stench is overwhelming...
---
I'm sure a Nuka Cola themed one would do very well.
---
On the other hand, WTF is up with the data-mined Liberator one? Yes, I want 16 liberators on my wall per section.
---
I'm really not the guy, I just believe people should be respectful of others' privacy.
---
I would, but Mr. Fuzzy only plays on Xbox.
---
Just to be clear im not trying to come across as happy about this! Im surprised is all!
---
He is trading junk for better junk.
---
lol at that ranger armor side by side.
---
It is *only* for 1st subscribers. It is not a mistake that it sells for 500 Atoms.
---
It talks about it on private worlds? How will that work with public worlds?
---
It‚Äôs free for first subscribers, unobtainable for those without. Paint for the current outfit
---
Don't even need full Unyielding. Run 3 pieces of Bolstering, 2 unyielding and your set with damage and survivability. Only time I use full Unyielding if when I sell stuff.
---
Same here, the paint is free.
---
Yeah, they happen after you die.
---
Welp return it or shut up
---
The outfit is free, yes. The new skin for it is not.
---
For both pc and console?
---
Lol you literally said ‚Äúknowing you‚Äù in your initial reply. Stop being so upset, I gave you the facts, it‚Äôs not my fault you choose to ignore them.
---
Also I think you‚Äôre upset about a different comment to the one you replied to as I did address everything within it. In case your confused the comment you responded to was a reply I made to another comment specifically referencing the no vote, I responded to add clarity to how the no option was very ambiguous and may not be as simple as everyone who voted no is in opposition to FO1st. I didn‚Äôt feel I needed to do this for the yes option as the actual survey split this option into 4 further detailed answers outlining more clearly the voters thought process.
---
With regards to the ‚Äúvoters‚Äù vs ‚Äúpeople‚Äù thing, I was only further reinforcing your statement that people may have voted multiple times. I‚Äôm surprised that you are so emotionally charged that you attack me for agreeing with you.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs going to be impossible to have a reasonable discourse if you‚Äôre going to be so irrational and defensive.
---
:(
---
I‚Äôd be wary of that bit if I were you. According to where he‚Äôs shopping at he may be up to something.
---
Not as of a few minutes ago. The riot paint recently adjusted to free. Was 500 for several hours
---
They don't look cooler than the Assault mask in my opinion. They are just rare. I would not wear one, really.
---
I hate to be the bearer of bad news. I am not going to say I was one of the top players of this game. 
---
I will say this though, I put in over 2000 hours into this game, from day one. 
---
Over the last couple of months I have noticed a decrease in player on the servers, to appoint that as of a week before the announcement of fallout 1st. 
---
I could only count around 8 to 13 players max, consistently,  everyday.
---
 Mind you I am from Canada, so that being said, I'm most likely on north American servers. 
---
I just recently walked away because I got sick and tired of the game breaking after every 15 to 30 minutes of game play. 
---
Please keep in mind, how many hours I put into this game. I was addicted to it, and if I could not deal with the brokenness of this game. How many other people would be willing to continue to put up with these issues. 
---
On top of that Bethesda throws its community under the bus for the 5th time in a year, by introducing a player first membership, and pushing off the wastelanders till next year, or the year after that. 
---
Honestly how many players are going to invest in a game that is  worse off now, than at launch? 
---
I would have stuck around, if the glitches were fixed, and the schedule for the wastelanders was not pushed off. 
---
I honestly think, and I am not saying this because I hate this game.
---
 I will openly admit I dislike Bethesdas business practices. I think the amount disrespect, dishonesty speak for itself. 
---
I think this game is slowly coming to a end. It honestly hurts to say it. But I think Bethesda is about to wash it hands, and move on. 
---
I hope I am wrong, but again. Why all of sudden, the fallout first membership, and the wastelanders being pushed off?
---
I think this was for a last ditch effort to salvage the game. And bring back some lost revenue. 
---
I wish you, everyone the best.
---
Im assuming both im on ps4. Also assuming you a 1st subscriber.
---
It would've been a hard pass if I had know they were going to sell me fuckin variants for the cosmetic it gives, not just unlock them for being a continuing subscriber. As it stands now kinda fucked cause I bought a year to save some cash on the overall price.
---
IF....it's worth it, if they have not subbed yet I don't see that happening, new players may be on the way due to the upcoming holidays but the influx will always be less and less over time as long as BGS keeps the current pace with content...snails pace. It will never get any better than 20% without great incentives and deeper content. This poll also doesn't account for ppl who won't even be playing 6 month to a year from now either, Fallout firsters or not.
---
Beth, just shooting itself in the foot image-wise, again. People were getting salty! If it is still free tonight I'll take it, rather have the green.
---
Ah, that explains it. It's nice to see that they are so quick to fix things when it comes to the Atom Shop.
---
I gave up on the glowing outfit before I started doing NW. I asked myself these questions : Am I gonna wear the glowing skeleton outfit more than this favorite outfit I'm currently wearing? my answer is no, so I stopped at 3500xp just to get all weapon's skins.
---
I learned my lesson a long time ago, I have to have everything in WoW during legion expansion. I lvled all classes, geared em all just to get all mage's tower weapon skins that will be removed. It made me burnt out and hated the game. And those skins don't even matter anymore right now cus there are better skins.
---
We really need some more walls, just added into the base game. I was surprised that there aren't even a few basic wallpapers for sale at the Whitesprings for 10k caps. It is a great camp feature and a logical one yet only for the AtomShop.
---
If you don't believe me then my PSN is I_SGT_KANE_I, you can ask the OP what he was playing on when he found the guy, and if it's not PS4 then it's not me. If you think i'm just giving out a fake PSN too then shoot me a message if you're on PS4 too. I'll respond with "Fuck idiotic redditors ;)"
---
When did they promise "free bug fixes"? That's a good one. 
---
According to your e-mail, you're simply dissatisfied with Bethesda's practices, you're not making a refund claim for a broken game. An "unlimited stash", containing anything other than junk would over burden the servers. It's true. Junk is different however.
---
Idk man I'm pretty good at this game
---
why do you think that people who dont play the game are still trolling this subreddit after nearly a YEAR? maybe on the first month that was true but you are in serious denial if you think the outrage is from people who dont even play this game.
---
It‚Äôs still free to play. This argument is invalid.
---
This is good advice. The single player content was fun but once that was over I found myself just going to the same places every time I played to farm for junk to make ammo and caps.
---
Seems to me, they meant it to be free all along, just screwed up and put a price on it. Either way it is super sloppy.
---
That's about the numbers I was expecting.
---
OP, What were you playing on when you found this guy? I'm getting accused of actually being the guy by some dumbfuck.
---
Same I wish there was a team death match I‚Äôd enjoy it so much more especially if there was just a respawn into a safe area to allow you to get ammo and loot and then go back into battle with a time limit or there could even be matches of move the payload attack and defend capture the flag. Rip tf2/counter strike
---
Once in a while I'll start singing "Atom Bomb Baby" even though it's not even on the 76 radio. I can't help it. I want her in my wigwam.
---
Because its caused by the scrapbox. Non-fo1st players dont have all their junk stored in a scrapbox.
---
Vanguard Junkies trending up
---
Unyeilding Bloodied steady but waning.
---
The thing I see coming to first is stuff that would be harmful to server stability if everyone has them and also to test the servers in a certain way. So stuff like two camps swapping camps etc I think will come to them. Stuff that would had been impossible if everyone got them. 
---
With scrap out of the stash it‚Äôs frees 400 lbs or more from the box and a lot of the need for the box to become bigger elaborated because now you only have to keep one of a kind items in there.
---
Personally I think there should have been basic solid color ones offered for free. Designers ones can stay in the atom shop.
---
Otherwise this is pretty shitty we have to pay to even have the option to use wallpapers. Practically locking a feature behind a paywall.
---
Outer Worlds is enjoyable but firmly a AA game. I'm a good 12-15 hours into it and it feels kind of like a Fallout 3/Borderlands/Bioshock mashup on a budget. Bits of it look absolutely fantastic (thanks to the unreal engine) but it does feel limited in scope and scale. Not worth $60 (or $80CAD) but worth playing, currently trying it out through the Windows Xbox pass.
---
Explain how FO 1st helps anyone ‚Äúwin‚Äùand I‚Äôll concede to you that it‚Äôs a pay2win scheme.
---
Expanded build areas and larger budget would probably make me buy it. I‚Äôm a build whore
---
World of Warcraft has a monthly fee. I don‚Äôt understand how people think they‚Äôre going to have a continuously supported game without funding of some sort. That‚Äôs not how things work. Things cost money. They have to pay people.
---
Then everyone would just switch to Mutants, because everyone has at least 3-6 mutations. Vanguard/ Mutant armor with Mutants Explosive/FFR would be the new "Meta"
---
I agree with buffing though but bloodied could also use some tweaks.
---
I've actually done this to friends who got into arguments while on mic.
---
"Tell her she's an irresponsible piece of shit"
---
YOU'RE AN IRRESPONSIBLE PIECE OF SHIT!
---
"You're welcome"
---
For a temp fix, and an aesthetically pleasing fireplace in the middle of you wall: put down a door way on to a foundation, place the modern fireplace on a rug, slide the rug/fireplace into the doorway until you get the green, place the combo, select the store/replace option on the doorway and switch it to a wall and voila! Space saving light and comfort, with a nice looking exterior stack. 
---
Pro-tip, you can do this with a lot of things to have them stick through walls for new design possibilities. 
---
Have fun, fellow vault dweller! See you out there!
---
Either they learned a quick lesson or it was a bug, or is a bug. All we can be sure of is that it will happen again.
---
Not a bot, no affiliation with Bethesda. Just asking questions.

MOOOOOOM, IM TRYING TO HAVE AN EPIC GAMER MOMENT!
---
I will check that out!
---
Haha its prolly in the same category as cockroaches and twinkies though
---
Christ, you "whales" will eat up just about everything, won't you?
---
It may be free for people who held the sub? 
---
I turned auto renew off. 
---
So eh? 
---
I mean I randomly got 500 atoms so I just grabbed it. 
---
I was just gonna do weeklies and Dailies for it.

I will join you in song.

Yeah the skin is free for all but the suit isnt lmao
---
I've been sleeping on a mod designed to replace the stealth boy 'shimmer' with a bright, red glow.
---
Might be that you fast travel to the camps with more stuff usually more intense players will spend money on the games they play
---
Just run by and yell YALL MOTHERFUCKERS NEED JESUS
---
He'll laugh. She'll think he's laughing at her. It'll get even spicier
---
Very cool! Interesting how you got the bats without the orange smoke (when you come through the front door). Great job!
---
Down the hill from 76 is where I go. It's only five or six, still more than anywhere else I've seen
---
Call the police.  :)
---
Yeah that was a slap to the face I imagine.  I can‚Äôt tell if Bethesda was being incredibly arrogant or stupid releasing that skin as the first item.
---
I‚Äôm guessing you mean Outer Worlds, and while I‚Äôve heard some good stuff about it, I don‚Äôt like the aesthetic and it seems a bit too cartoony to me.
---
South of the purveyor, where the river starts/ends, there is a trailer with loot and lots of tics. I made a camp there once but the uptake in repair costs made me leave fast since tics always show up
---
That's what I thought too, but someone told me that one doesn't come with a gas mask and the one from the event had/has one attached to it. Was this just a false claim?
---
No, the riot armor is free for you. The Paint is 500 Atoms
---
I sing to the trees.
---
But they don't listen to me.
---
Smart trees.
---
a better poll would be "what percentage of your friends list is in a private world?" with me, its 90-100% in or visiting a private world
---
Thankyou!:D I didn‚Äôt expect anyone to notice the bats downstairs tbh!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

How do you know they were shamed into changing it?
---
r/truebutthereslessrudewaysofsayingit
---
I agree it feels a lot more like mass effect to me as far as gameplay elements are concerned. It‚Äôs hard to compare open world to small hubs. My biggest pet peeve is random settlers talking to each other being in non sequitors like in oblivion. Though fortunately they joke about it occasionally with scripted ones.
---
Before or after removal of slap damage?
---
Erm no I'm seeing it all the time. Often it's their first time commenting on anything Fallout or 76 related too. Look for a low effort 'game is trash' or something and check their other comments. It's usually when the latest shitfest is at the top of / slightly over the drama bell curve.
---
No, I don't know why they care or bother either other than the gaming subs spamming crap about Todd and how we're all apparently buying paid fridges.
---
Played for a year and now you want a refund? Sounds to me like you enjoyed a year's worth of playtime bud.
---
It literally says that it‚Äôs reserved for Fallout 1st folks.
---
Yes, with ketchup (:
---
Here is a complete list with rarity and location:
---
Its impossible to 1 shot her
---
I mean it is not huge but it does free up a spot for a couple luck cards if you replenish your food often and just reload the fridge and your pack with what you need it at least doesn't spoil at the normal rate but I agree it is not a huge advantage but we shall watch and see this combined with the junk collector combined with the next and the one after that may end up at an advantage in fact some might already say that 1st is that paid advantage we feared when costumes with buffs and fridges and collectors came out...

This company has a lot in common with trump. They do horrible things to people, but no one bats a eye.

In the future, I hope controllers get a push-to-talk button.

holly shit that would be sick I am so feed up with the damn bugs but I might not mind that one from time to time hell it could be cannon for the damn hunchback of notre dam mole miners everywhere LOL

I completely agree, but do you think the Wastelanders delay was planned? If we look at it well, almost at the same time that Fallout 1st was announced, it was announced that Wastelanders was going to be delayed, maybe Bethesda is not worried about correcting mistakes now, but they want to polish Wastelanders to the fullest (this is an idea, you shouldn't be taken seriously)
---
Probably lag or someone else behind him with a stealthboy
---
First world problems
---
Dang. Good to know, thanks!
---
And spawned a floor over you to trap and drown you. Ever had that one?
---
I suppose, it has really good mechanics though, stuff Bethesda should work on in their future endeavors
---
point pleasant sometimes spawns ticks.. sadly not always like the moonshiners shack and lumber
---
I see the opposite, I see the same names bitching here all the time with the occasional 3 day old account saying something positive about the game. people who dont play the game arent invested enough to keep trolling the subreddit
---
&gt; blasting Ben Shapiro into the mic while his kid was running around. Thought it was super funny
---
If you think Ben Shapiro, the Nazi Dwarf, is funny you have a problem.  The idea that somebody listens to Shapiro in a place where a child could hear is horrifying.

Here is a complete list of outfits including where to find them and rarity, this would help with pricing:
---
Bethesda is a good company, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll learn all they can from it when moving forward in the future. Well, we can hope they will anyway lol.
---
Here is a complete list of outfits including where to find them and rarity, this should give you an idea:
---
Ah, okay, I'll try that. 
---
It defaults to CAPS and that's super awkward.  
---
(FWIW, I do have PTT on.)
---
The Fireman helmet indeed does not have a gas mask and it's just the hat. The one one you're thinking about is the Fire BREATHER helmet. You get that one during the quest Into the Fire.
---
BLASPHEMY IN THE WASTELAND
---
Here's hoping they take the easy route
---
1) temporarily replace the ''applied'' legendary effect with a different one (ie: 50 DrR while aiming). So as to avoid bricked weapons, legacy content.
---
2) rework the broken effect on an internal build
---
3) replace the temporary effect with the reworked legendary effect.
---
4) no affected guns are bricked, bug is patched
---
The kids need something to eat.
---
Welcome to Fallout.
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs a Fallout 1st subscriber does they don‚Äôt care
---
How do you know they weren't?
---
Look at the situation as it stands. They sold it at 500, got backlash for doing so and then, several hours later, make it available for free.
---
Whatever the actual reason is, doesn't look good.
---
Maybe Bethesda should fix their fucking game
---
It's less than $30, not too much to debate.  If you like Fallout games you'd probably play enough hours to get your money's worth
---
Why‚Äôs that?  Just asking to keep in the loop but haven‚Äôt seen anything lately.
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs a Fallout 1st subscriber so they don‚Äôt care
---
I mean I get 5+ kills a match fairly consistently and I'm only above average skill wise.  Is it rare to get that many kills on xbox?
---
Tesla is only effective close range or if they get right on top of you from height. When paired with a stealth boy It's like holding a sign that says: I have no strategy and I'm probably carrying a silenced explosive handmade, or some other gimmicky Meta. Exploit and destroy. Players like this usually don't have anything on them. Also they tend to be kinda broke. like after 500 caps you don't get anything from killing them.  Buying or farming stealth boys means every engagement has to be worthwhile or else it's back to glitching ... err farming bullets so they can buy more stealth boys. 
---
It was fun for sport in survival because you could clean out their aid and precious stealth boys but now.. if I kill them once and they are broke ; I move on.
---
Whereas English ones are so boring, I mean, no sex...
---
9_9 charming. Blow me, how 'bout that?
---
I DONT know why they changed it. That‚Äôs why I asked. You made a claim and I was wondering if there was proof.
---
Just more conspiracies.
---
I just checked and it shows limited but free.
---
ok boomer
---
üëç
---
That is true but also honest
---
I play pc
---
Don't lump ESO with this trash. ESO doesn't have a joke of a price of subscription like this game that is equivalent of buying a whole new game for next to no content. This game wishes it could be the game ESO. It really is simple. this subscription is overpriced for what you get with it. Plus a few things locked behind a paywall that are pay2win.
---
1) I highly doubt FO5 has been delayed or development stopped, it‚Äôs probably not even close to started. They still have a large amount on Elder Scrolls 6 to even do plus Starfield (think that‚Äôs the name). FO5 is many years from even being thought of. 
---
2)  ‚Äú*You* hope Bethesda realizes they *need* to keep the single player experience‚Äù No, I personally like having it multiplayer. Yes single player is fun but I also enjoy 76 and interacting with other people. I don‚Äôt want to be walled off and told I need to play alone or with certain people. So for that statement you make, to each their own, I don‚Äôt want that to happen.
---
What's your name in game?  I play everyday too.
---
if they add private NW matches im holding you responsible for suggesting it.
---
You need to git gud üòÇ
---
"But was it actually meant to be free all along?!?!"
---
Honestly, we don't know.  It seems like the Atomic Shop's update today went a bit weird in general, like how the Red Rocket stuff is magically back without any announcement on the featured tabs.  And there's no post on the web site about it either.
---
"Ahem! Excuse me, sir? Do you have a moment to talk about life insurance"?
---
‚ÄúI wanna be as unbiased as possible.‚Äù

Well_That_Was_A_Lie_Meme.gif

These BGS cheerleaders are a joke, just like the current state of the game that 17% of these cheerleaders defend and get offended over. Pay for this shit game...i don't give a fuck at all, but I'm entitled to my opinion and you're all a bunch of idiots. White knighting for BGS every chance you get and get offended as fuck over someone else opinion. Go fuck yourselves. The game is shit and will always be shit....keep buying the shit...your fucking loss asswipes. 20% of this sub buys a sub for 76....but they are all camped out on Reddit defending BGSs honor....get a fucking life....
---
PC
---
Jesus, you Bethesda assholes are pushy as shit, aren't you? 
---
You know what else is free? Uninstalling this buggy, cash-grab trainwreck of a game.
---
The skin is now free
---
I think it's probably the opposite, wherein this subreddit is likely overly skewed to people who are biased in favour of the game. After all the game has gone through in the last year, those who remain playing it and patronising this sub are the most die hard players. I'm not judging those people, because what they enjoy isn't my business. However saying there is this invisible majority of people who conveniently skew poll results away from supporting Bethesda doesn't make much sense.
---
I'm not saying its the same people doing it. They are randoms attracted by the daily '*haha look at Bethesda*' posts elsewhere with several thousand upvotes. They seem to have actual accounts with activity in gaming subs but nothing to do with this game. People do come here to spout a couple of remarks about it and then leave.
---
Pay for the subscription, get the skin for free as an exclusive benefit.
---
Haha McKay, real good one. Seriously tho why do you guys complain on the internet about a game that is actually pretty FUCKING decent.
---
Because clickbait YouTube videos don‚Äôt get views unless they say ‚ÄúFALLOUT 76 DID WHAT?!?! Here‚Äôs my thoughts and regurgitated opinion!!
---
Also the spacesuit is back but only that? It is really weird.
---
I don‚Äôt for the most part but, the survey was posted by OP in some other general FO subs meaning that this survey was not just targeting FO76 players it was targeting players from FO4, NV, FO3 etc... I‚Äôm sure you are aware that some people within these demographics, although huge fans of the FO franchise, have an outspoken dislike for FO76 and the fact the survey was brought to them is questionable. 
---
There were also a number of people admitting to the fact on the initial survey post and it is a regular occurrence to see people post ‚Äúwhy do you play this game?‚Äù Posts in the sub admitting to have never played the game but instead getting their opinions from YouTube.
---
Exactly, I want it cause I like it.
---
Bummer. Thanks though!
---
Gtx760? For the love of Christ upgrade that
---
This is a good idea man, I always think the same. And if you send a ticket for this advice? I support you.
---
Bethesda, in your haste to monetize your game don't forget that there are many players like myself who paid full price for this game.
---
I'm not in to candy crush either.
---
If you stand in the open floor to ceiling window with your dick out you're going to complain if people laugh at you?
---
Well said
---
If TES6 has microtransactions then I've lost all hope in the company, they just need a good old game that once its bought, there are no subscriptions or DLC just a game for people to enjoy with a well written story and a new engine¬π11
---
Well they don't need to make an announcement about every returning item, but then I have no idea why they remove things from the store in the first place ü§î
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a free paint.. now you just have to acquire the outfit so you can apply your FREE paint. Also if you finish reading it says ‚ÄúExclusive to Fallout 1st members‚Äù. Not sure how it‚Äôs misleading if you actually read what‚Äôs written
---
No idea about xbox but on ps4 i only see certain names racking up high kill counts.  Like ubsurdly high kill counts.
---
You are only entitled to the privacy you try to keep yourself.  Broadcast your life to half the planet?  Where is the expectation of privacy?
---
Lmao thanks man. I get all my rage out when I play RL, hahaha
---
Same reason the McRib comes around every so often.
---
Gotcha.  I figured as much but wanted to confirm.  Thank you!
---
Lol well here you are tired of hearing about it yet you don't follow your own advice
---
The friends welcome sign.. you can barely read with those letters! Also right after I purchased it the letter set came out which would've let me spell anything (I don't see why they sold the 'friends welcome' sign when they planned on selling all the letters basically the next day)
---
This is the type of bug I like though. Doesn‚Äôt hurt me or make me frustrated. It‚Äôs just the good old fashioned LOL and move on with my day.
---
Lol, this is one of those that is very easy to figure out is fake. It's like those reviews you come across in a small town for a local store that gets very little business. The one's where mom and dad, and friends of said owner are leaving those cringy 5 star reviews of how good the place is.
---
Krill have no voice here lmao
---
You mean I can get a dome if I pay someone to build it?
---
You and the 12 other people in there
---
At one point you could. I‚Äôm not sure if that still works.
---
Fallout 76 sucks.
---
He appears to be buying weapons.
---
They pushed him to far, now he's out for revenge...
---
What system are you on? I'd buy a pirate hat if the price was right.
---
In all fairness a worldspace with 1-8 players, instead of 30 players, could probably cope with  holding more in camps. So it's logical it could happen on private worlds.
---
That said; I would have said the same about stash space and we know what's happened there.
---
‚ÄúBethesda assholes‚Äù lol, you really think someone from Bethesda would take the time to come down to your level to defend their game?
---
Mine is spawned up fairly high without a floor under where he walks out of the machine. He falls, breaks his legs, then crawls around for junk.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I don‚Äôt really know how much I‚Äôm selling them for yet
---
There's also the problem that their camp comes right from private worlds over to public servers "messing with stability".
---
It's one of them bugs. Happens to me loads, and my buddy. 2 at a time once.  I give em names and treat em like pets..... I need to leave the psycho alone for a bit.
---
Some are legendary now. They‚Äôre being hunted pretty hard. I run fissure loops every server I join. After a fast travel, they drop out of the sky.
---
I thought it was 500 atoms?
---
To be fair this is why I've put a floor in the water where one usually spawns along with a sign and a small bridge back to shore.
---
https://i.imgur.com/qnnnZyU.png I'm crouched as I took this for a friend lol
---
That was some quick damage control.
---
Dead bodies can be explained because enemies fight one another. It‚Äôs one of my favorite tactics to use when I‚Äôm getting my ass handed to me. Lead monsters into one another. Snallygasters get knocked down to size thanks to Beefy Boye Ferals.
---
Pretty quick explanation! Funny that it happens to me, I don‚Äôt ever hunt them. Lol. Need to find someone who can explain my Skyrim one now.
---
If we‚Äôre being 100% Oprah honest with each other right now, the best way to do it is how GTA 5 went about it. Let people buy in game currency and use that money to fund all future expansions to the game. Red Dead Redemption 2 came out and GTA 5 is still going strong for that exact reason.
---
Pretty hard to say now. The clean ranger uniform and pirate hat are pretty rare and will only get spendier.
---
When I sing to the trees
---
They sing back
---
But in Vietnamese
---
Lmao I take pictures with them in my skull gas mask so when they come up on the loading screen I look like some badass that hunts scorchbeasts for a living.
---
Level 115 here and I have 60 saved up lol doing the same as you
---
Hey guys! look at this whale!
---
I'm able to sell the pumpkins for 249 and the racks for 749, that's what people buy those for.
---
The cutouts I haven't exactly tried selling yet due to rarity but if anyone buys at x price soon I'll say.
---
Costumes I have no idea but I hear some of em are 5-15k
---
Let's address this accurately, Fallout 1st isn't a pay2win scheme. I think we can both acknowledge that.
---
What Fallout 1st has is pay2win items hidden behind its paywall.
---
The closest thing to an official definition of pay2win is best described here:
---
["In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win)
---
This in reference to a game overall but the same logic applies to pay2win items. Afterall, a pay2win game is made up of pay2win items.
---
It doesn't talk about how much of an advantage you get or how competitive that advantage is. Just that you get an advantage over those that don't pay.
---
So by definition, scrapboxes and the new tent is pay2win by definition. Same too with repair kits, scrap kits and even the fridge and scrap bot.
---
Even by the definitions own standard, it doesn't take the word "win" literally.
---
If you have a more authoritative definition, I'd be happy to defer to that but I've seen none. The next best is urban dictionary, which I would never use as an authoritative source and even it agrees that the definition isn't about a literal "win" but about paying for advantage. Not the significance of that advantage, just that there is an advantage for paying over not paying.
---
To finish this off, here are a couple of testimonials from people who have Fallout 1st:
---
["The tent is total pay to win and sadly I love it."](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dqhnr8/what_was_your_reason_for_buying_fallout_1st/f64igbj/)
---
["so yeah, it is a subscription that gives loads of advantages.. but the most unfair of this subscription is that you are actually able to use the scrapbox and fast travel tent in a public server and that's facilitating pay2win "](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dqhnr8/what_was_your_reason_for_buying_fallout_1st/f64958m/)
---
because it cost the same as amazon prime. and cost more that PlayStation plus
---
I wish I could play with my keyboard and mouse on console.  I cant aim with a controller and hackers are absurd on PC.
---
This always gets me! People will try and say that WoW is a much fuller, fleshed out world compared to 76. But it wasn't always and they've been charging people to play there game,  on top of bying it since day 1. 
---
Oh but Bethesda adds a paid service to an otherwise free to play game and everyone loses it. I just don't get it. 
---
I'm not a 1st sub either so.
---
Careful, shills don't like facts.
---
Pesant
---
Yeah.
---
Who tf are you talking about?
---
Wow...ngl this is pretty sketch. You're gonna tell me that they expect people who paid $13 a month to pay an extra 500 atoms or $5 just for paint for something they gave you for free ?? And then presumably back track and take it back because people are pissed ?? As someone who has been mostly happy with the game ...I definitely can't defend this one.
---
It's 0% for me.
---
I believe on ps4 you can connect a wireless keyboard/mouse
---
They've been in the files since release. They're probably cut content.
---
Have you tried crying about it?
---
Think what you want bud,  but I can leave my biases out of my work,
---
Personally I'd pay less for the ranger stuff. Maybe 1k each at the most. More for the pirate hat. I'd prob do 4k for that. I'm on xbox though.
---
Could say the same about people that don't have first. Both sides insult each other
---
I'd say "That's pretty Edgy" but the entire novelty of this has worn off so much it's actually starting to rot out the subreddit.
---
Also, can I have your stuff please.
---
Why would ANYONE want a good bye from someone as toxic as you?
---
I guess... but the real question is: people still play gta v?
---
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ya I was just curious cause I saw the background of the atomic shop today for the first time. Thanks
---
I edited my .ini to remove the menu music before that was an option.  Is that cheating?
---
I wonder what you would say if the 'yes' would have won over the 'no'.
---
Hypocrisy is a helluva drug
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre whining tbh.
---
ok
---
thanks for the update
---
I heard they only display as normal size, though this was a while back I'm not sure if it's still the case or it's been fixed.
---
I wonder if Xbox supports this?  I have an xboxone that I won in a raffle.
---
How do you get the 5th variant? the one that is just the wooden rack?
---
There's the  kanawha cunty cemetery sometime spawning a swarm of ticks, or ghouls maybe even the "mosquitoes"
---
I do not understand the " Win". Tell me how one wins 76? Pile of caps and Legendaries? 2 million of every resources? What happens when you win? Also how does one check their ranking towards the win?
---
Nice to see that you are hearing our feedback! How much are we going to have to pay for the rotation?
---
Some children always feel they need to announce that they are taking their ball and going home. I didn't care when I was 4 and I don't care now.
---
I guess my point is the ones with downsides should always be better. Bloodied requires you to run low HP, nocturnal only works at night, etc. But 10% on Mutants is just so low it isnt really worth considering.
---
I have noticed slower servers since 1st dropped though. Is that just me seeing that? Quests and events taking longer to move to next stages for example. Maybe that part was true but they thought fuck it.
---
But yeah back on topic: I really want more camp budget and bigger build radius. Putting it behind a subscription would be really disappointing. Although tbh I'd have taken that better than the unlimited scrap stuff.
---
One, this was incredibly well thought out and the most intelligent argument I‚Äôve gotten so far from anyone when talking about this crap. 
---
Second, I will totally agree that the scrap box and tent are advantageous and conform to this particular definition of ‚ÄúPay2win‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure that it‚Äôs the best term for it, but that‚Äôs more because we don‚Äôt have a term for it other than this so it‚Äôs just the closest description we‚Äôve got.
---
So yes, in this sense it is very much Pay2win, but not so much that I think it deserves the hate it‚Äôs getting. To be honest, I often forget about the survival tent and don‚Äôt use it, so it hasn‚Äôt been much of an advantage to me lol. My main personal reason for subscribing to FO 1st is that I would have spent that money of stones anyway and now I can use the private server to play with just personal friends and I don‚Äôt have to worry about randos and trolls.
---
I got help thank you Paladin!
---
Click on the link and read the definition. Even the definition doesn't take "win" to be literal.
---
Oddly enough, some people do. Surprising as that is. Lol
---
None of the stuff is rare at all, it just looks cool lol. I ran the event and ended up with 3 pirate sets, short suit, long suit, fireman stuff and several cutouts. I was really happy with the amount of rewards from this event.
---
And many (me included) paid full price and still subscribed. Doesn‚Äôt mean we need to get years worth of extras free just because someone else paid a bit less for the game.
---
Wait is that a raider skin for the scrap bot??
---
I honestly feel like NW would be vastly improved if they reduced the XP you earn from time survived by 10x, and increased the xp you earn from kills by 10x.
---
Survival mode
---
Vault boy on the shelf
---
It's a "feature*
---
This is how I treat weeks that have nothing I want. They are saving weeks. Although the bungalow is tempting...
---
The pirate hat is worth 5k easy
---
Because I'd like to have all of the information to give him before he spends his money for something that he may regret.
---
What bug crawled up your ass? I'm not interested in fallout first either
---
Think im at about 3k now. I have until 12th, yeah? *sigh* ok well I'll work out how much I need each day and just hit that after I do atoms challenges.
---
Absolutely
---
I'm sorry that you are a bit butthurt. Just asking what your point was.
---
I dropped my clean ranger outfit lol I thought it was crap
---
You seem a bit hostile. Maybe take a break from the game if it's got you so stressed. Eat a snickers
---
fallout 1st is like 1st class for those who want a premium experience. Sure we talk purchased tickets and other people got tickets last minute. all of us who got tickets earlier are asking an advantage to the last minute people. Some of us decided we want to upgrade to first class. Pay a little more for storage and less travel fee. it's good for those who want it and Reddit isn't the majority. Because it's selling obviously or everyone wouldn't be in probate worlds on PS4. I've started selling and trading in the ps4 community too. Way less broke toxic players who are mad cause they can't live out their anti social ranch wasteland fantasy at all the public workshops.
---
Bye OP, I apologize for my comments on the matter on some points at least. I don't think I came off as judgmental on any part of my comments though. Don't feel like shit, because that will make me feel like shit.
---
I did make comments about most of the actual players complaining being unable to afford TWO subscriptions (conswole players at least), but I don't feel like that's poor shaming because I'm in that boat too. But I like the game enough to think I can splurge for bonuses monthly.
---
Didn't mean to demean anyone for being against it either. It's just that most people who were against it were not actual players and it legitimately is the focus of a sinister astroturf campaign, and I'm not just saying that because conspiracy are fun and sexy
---
So, what was your point again?
---
prison always there
---
Ahhh okay. Hopefully it gets fixed! Thank you!
---
Private worlds only can have up to 8 peeps so i guess they could increase the camp size
---
A lot of people are nervous of doing silos, so thanks for sharing the vid.
---
gee and you hang out here in a thread for a game you hate? oh wise one- may we bask in your glory. Tell thee oh ye of such great thought what to play!
---
You don't understand what whining is, do you? Maybe that's why you can't stop.
---
Thanks
---
So you think they won't be able to use their camp at all in adventure mode anymore? I don't think this will be a Private Worlds only addition when it comes.
---
Thank you
---
What?
---
For that matter, they've been part of the background video for just as long.
---
Lol *stop liking what I don't like*...
---
Yeah. Reading through it, with what you said at the end, it reeeeaaally sounds like you're in the wrong
---
Don‚Äôt you get free atoms every month for items such as this?
---
yep, it's literally a kill button.
---
Anyone see the riot paint is now free for st members?
---
How do you hear Italians arguing? I've lived there, it's all hand gestures, trust me.
---
Yeah, I thought that might be the case but I think they changed it. Someone in another thread said it was showing as 500 for them earlier today but they went back and it was free.
---
They were hoping people would buy both
---
Oh fair point if it was posted in the main fallout sub, I don't follow that one. 100% of their fallout 76 posts are just hate and not worth reading.
---
dude, this is so old. Where do you think people get 50k in bullets
---
Was this a question or an explanation? Because the title is an explanation but you end it asking us.
---
Even if it isn't a 5 minute time frame, it is suspicious if one player is like the Terminator and is killing everyone by themselves.
---
cuz 12 Dolla balla yall
---
Ooor they could up the difficulty...in any way. 
---
Why let us build these strong characters for a handful of semi-challenging enemies?
---
That sounds like the main fallout subreddit. They absolutely hate 76
---
The refund request came the moment after they introduced the subscription, which is not what the game was billed as.
---
But you're right. I shouldn't have waited.  I stopped playing in the first month, but didn't refund because BGS was committed to fixing the bugs, improving the game, and releasing free content.  So, I kept the game... waiting.
---
The subscription was the final thing...  I mostly posted so others who aren't Aussies knew they would probably be out of luck.
---
Nope. You lose everything including the game.
---
Lol that was great
---
Fun trick, I was once over weight so I threw a bunch of stuff in the body and ran the rest of the way to my camp, then I looted the scorch beast when it appeared and scrapped everything
---
Bought I got the first atoms. October. Haven‚Äôt got the one in November.
---
I think you get to keep the armor.
---
But... it‚Äôs not like you can get away not understanding percentages in daily life.... tips, oil life in your car, pay increases, etc... they are everywhere. 
---
Sheesh.
---
Well, I'm afraid that even Aussies if they waited a year before asking for one will be denied. The thing that came out said you could only get one if you'd already asked for one
---
 I‚Äôm looking for serious answers
---
Ok good that‚Äôs the only thing I want
---
I was a bug, you can submit a ticket for a refound if you paid atoms to unlock it
---
Sadly pay4advantage isn't as catchy. 
---
To address your final point, there are a number of legitimate reasons why people purchase Fallout 1st. Some just want access to a private world to pay with their friends or children. Some see it as value for money, which it can be that way depending on what you consider to be of value.
---
However, buying Fallout 1st supports anti-consumer practices, namely pay2win items. That may not be your intent but that's the end result. You're enabling and rewarding Bethesda to keep making pay2win items and putting them behind the subscription paywall.
---
That's only a fraction of why people "hate" on Fallout 1st and the people that bought into it. The scrapbox is a large part of it too. Not only is it a highly requested feature to fix the core game but Bethesda also lied to us about storage not being able to be increased due to server stability issues. It seems there's no problem with having scrapboxes on public servers as all.
---
Look for the more rational people here, we get why some people would want to buy Fallout 1st. However you cannot deny that you're enabling and supporting anti-consumer practices.
---
Though, people shouldn't be hating on you for doing so (though at the same time people like you aren't above criticism). We really should be focusing our attention on Bethesda for implementing such a terrible anti-consumer product and some of us do just that.
---
Hope that clears things up a little. Won't change much but I hope it at least gives you some insight.
---

---
Maybe this is more your speed Sally
---
Apparently so. I guess we'll find out all the details after the first uptake of F1st finishes.
---
Stuff like the junk box might only allow withdrawls after your sub finishes. I'd guess the tent might become unavailable.
---
Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.
---
Yes, you keep everything. Canceling only means stopping auto-renew. They still have your $12.99. Not sure what getting a refund will do but acquaintances have told me they lost items. Don't know if I believe them.
---
I really only want the ranger armor because I love new Vegas but the other stuff is fine too.
---
Kill an enemy faster means more enemies I can kill in a given time frame. Efficiency .
---
May have done that to myself a couple times
---
Yea for sure. OP is not hearing it! This whole damn boat is embarrassing dude...
---
They must have realized that was disgusting since it is just a green tint on the outfit for a subscription some people apparently paid 100 dollars towards. Why in the world do paints cost 5 or 6 dollars? They are not even new models just color tints or a skin at most.
---
I could have made that skin in about ten minutes if I had the original skin file (literally a photoshop color filter and maybe some touchups).
---
Maybe a brand new model could cost 5 bucks but this was one of the things that made me stop and think about the atom shop about a year ago or so. I guess inflation in the digital world just keeps going up, why I cannot support this game and am worried about future games. I remembered the days you spent ten or fifteen bucks and got the entire content area of Old World Blues or a huge alien mothership to explore.
---
You also could customize your power armor in the game with numerous colors just by exploring a bit and collecting junk
---
More whining I see.
---
Fridge is not an advantage its a hinderance. Not to mention food is super heavy and wouldn‚Äôt waste valuable stash space on if
---
Amen now if only fo76 wasn't a quilt of bugs like this on top of horrible QOL and game breaking bugs patching it togather
---
Oh are you new? That's cool man. See ya around
---
Mischief Night was fun. 
---
The rewards were bullshit. For all the times I played, I only got two plans for pumpkins and one rack and just kept getting the same plans over and over again.
---
Every log in? Damn
---
I just like to be fully prepared for future content that may be difficult. I don't use a bloodied build though. I prefer max health Junkie/Rifles/Crit.
---
I started switching to prime...
---
I'm an active player with 2k hours playtime. I'm in favor of the game but when I post on /r/fo76 it's usually not because of something good that happened.
---
I'm active on the official Bethesda forums too and you can't say anything bad about the game over there so it spills over here, where I'm also noticing a ridiculous amount of threads being deleted by mods because they are people complaining about the game.
---
I don't think the complaints and outrage are felt by non-players more than active players.
---
Ah, no I didn't buy it. Waiting for the model with the shoulder pads. Didn't think a slight color change was worth it personally. But thank you though!
---
F@&lt;kin Genius!!
---
Well done Ol boy,well done.
---
I wish I could afford too give ya all the golds &amp; upvotes In existence,I would in a heartbeat...
---
One of my favorite posts of the night.
---
Actually, if you‚Äôre on xbox and cancel the sub via the refund option, Beth **may** lock your account, deeming it a fraudulent charge-back, as they *apparently* can‚Äôt remove the atoms you are granted, or the items you have claimed
---
Both...
---
They knew they just screed their subscribers within what a week? It looked bad and someone in PR finally spoke up. The game is a joke.
---
lol it me, except whenever I'm in the shower
---
Yea 5 dollars for a slight color change is abit egregious, which is why I didn't buy it. Now if it was a entirely new model I would be more willing to spend for it.
---
Pull functional content (scrapbox, tent) out from behind a subscription wall. If even be fine with them being normal atom shop purchases. Doesn't have to be free.
---
Satisfaction = less crippling of my hands from RSI
---
One shot, one kill, my old wrists are happy
---
Spammy bullet sponge punts can fuck right off
---
Gee...cant get anything past you can we? oh observant one...
---
Its funny u say your entitled to your opinion cuz thats what alot those people will call you
---
Two people working for Bethesda. Nice.
---
I'd rather take the radiation than the itch!
---
Is it free if you're paying for fallout 1st
---
I think we're slowly accumulating more items but I'm also looking forward to having more customisation. I don't yet have any wallpapers because I'm saving atoms but keep considering using them. The bungalow has my attention at the moment.
---
We get the occasional things for free. Mostly a player icon (meh) but events give us stuff too. Like meat week and mischief night did. Both gave us camp items and outfits (no pirate outfit for me unfortunately).
---
Back during release, I focused my build solely on PVP. Sat by that one white building that spawns ghouls and Pvp'd there. At one point, I killed 27 players in 5ish minutes. It was great fun and I returned all of the loot to the players, but shortly after, dupe glitches came into spotlight and PVP was done for.
---
Grinding for these rewards has really opened my eyes to what people complain about. I'm not good at this sort of game, i don't have the twitchy skills to do it right and I prefer to play Fallout with a controller which i know puts me at an immediate disadvantage. Probably why I do best with shotguns. So I only play NW for these sorts of rewards. 
---
The other day i got a challenge to stay in matches till the end and that's when i started to see this shit. People firing I the air and getting kills, people firing at terrain and hitting people. The worst I saw was someone using a missile launcher and i swear to God the missiles were curving to hit the enemy. It's absolutely disgusting.
---
Thanks for looking out!
---
You failed science didn't you?
---
Freeü§î
---
Because Fallout 76 is laughably bad and still does not feel worth the original money I spent on it.
---
Not sure about that, the clean Ranger outfit was 1K or less before the event, the Hat usually ran for 400 to 500 caps. Now there's a lot more because of the event I've seen them for even less.
---
The party is over bud. Now get back to grinding.
---
Yes. It's stated in the FAQ on the page. 
---
2¬†Ranger Armor Set and Icon/Emotes must be claimed from the Atomic Shop while your Fallout 1st¬†membership is active, but once they have been claimed they will continue to be yours after the membership expires.
---
Okay shill.
---
Oh, I think its only once per sub, so you'll get a new traunch when they re charge you
---
That's what it says in the title
---
I'm not sure if the law applies here because as someone who doesn't have Fallout 1st, I don't see the armour at all, so it's not being falsely sold to me as "free".
---
They better be giving us refunds on the people who spent atoms for it...
---
How much fishy stuff does a company need to do before people realize this is off
---
My roommate subscribed, cancelled, and recieved a refund the day FO1st came out and they still have acess to everything at the moment
---
I did find someone who bought it and I told them to contact bethesda support over it. I've never had problems getting atom refunds. It's shady that they didn't auto credit people who bought it. 
---
The backlash seems to be the reason it went free üëÄ
---
Just give me a god damned blank wallpaper with a color wheel I can select from!
---
LOL that bug on PS4 where you die super fast for no reason IS A MOD ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ omg I'm ded
---
Keep atoms and any emotes/apparel you claim from shop
---
I agree with BGS on this one. It's been a year. At least they are  providing your feedback to the game studio.
---
I don't down vote opinions, fanboys/cheerleaders will.
---

---
Oops, must've missed that. Thanks!
---
That's glorious.
---
I'd be happy with even .1% increase each time an event is completed. Otherwise it's completely possible to run these limited time events as much as possible and still not get the rewards. While some one else could run it 2x and get a rare. Idk, would just be nice to be actually working towards a goal.
---
drop that PSN
---
Got some statistical bias there, all the people that hate the subscription just left the game so of the people remaining you would see a higher average of subs.
---
Game is pathetic and terrible
---
Things would still be rare because not many ppl are going to grind the events that hard, but if you do you should get rewarded. IMO.
---
I appreciate the hell out of that, but save it. I play enough that I'm bound to get another drop in events and stuff, and I'm still quite sure it'll have to return to vendor at some point. But I seriously thank you for the offer.
---
Thank you, I don't check there as often and I should
---
One can hope.
---
Considering you only see it listed as free if you are a member... I think they‚Äôre fine
---
So where do I go exactly to request a atom refund? And can I even get a refund on console?
---
Find the plan and make them
---
Sacrifice your first born to the rng gods
---
No you'd have to do it on your phone or laptop. Go to bethesda support and make a ticket. My friend instantly got his refund of 500 atoms. They seem to be right ontop of it
---
Not $5... 500 atoms. Can we stop with the $ BS? At least say $2.50 since 1st members get atoms for half price.
---
A good number of responders will have moved on from the game but only returned to the reddit to find out what's going on with Wastelanders, and to get the skinny on FO 1st from people who actually play.
---
That said.  The responders to the poll are more than likely see themselves as FO76 players, FO enthusiasts, Bethesda loyalists from past gaming experience.  But I would expect that the big majority of players that you actually find on the Public Servers these days are either 1st subscribers or on 1st subscriber friend lists.  Everyone else has put the game aside.
---
Well, yeah, for sure... but most legacy items are tied to a patch note saying they were pulled. This is either an oversight on patch notes stating it, or a big tied to how they redid some of the scout armor descriptions.
---
If it stays pulled, then I would for sure get the prices being high... just dunno if it was on purpose or by mistake.
---
If we were able to do this, it boxes well for the future. Mmogfails said that the community has a lot of impact on how Bethesda treats us. If we are loud enough, they will change it. 
---
Glad it worked. Let's tackle the PC hacking next.
---
I posted this months ago, the PC version is still full of hackers. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c5uop5/hacking_on_pc_is_out_of_hand_and_it_looks_like/
---
Sorry for the delayed reply, had a bit of a crisis in RL, then got overwhelmed by a few thousand backlogged notifications, still need help?
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done. I purchased the plan for around 2500 caps. It‚Äôs a long grind to make them though as it costs a ton of materials to mass produce them. Looking for drops
---
Snowglobes were trash, we need permanent bobbleheads.
---
Buy the plans from BOS vendor Phoenix in Watoga
---
I‚Äôve done that. I‚Äôm looking for drops though as grinding materials takes too long and I‚Äôm only seeing 1 mod per 10 rifles
---
Sorry for the delayed reply, had a bit of a crisis in RL, then got overwhelmed by a few thousand backlogged notifications.    
---
Thanks for the comment and detailed list, I'll start chewing through it ASAP!
---
Where did you find it? WHERE !?
---
Please...
---
That would never have happened. At least, I hope not.
---
Lets get the scrapbox free for everyone next.
---
Good. Now pay for atoms.
---
Space suits for astronauts who won't be leaving the vicinity of earth - and who will be up there for short durations - have minimal to no shielding.
---
They don't do shit against hackers. Trust me. I reported hundreds of hackers on PC. I still see those people play and cheat in games. 
---
We need to become loud enough for them to listen. Look at what mmogfails said! If we protest enough, they will oblige. The paint is now free, so maybe just maybe this can be fixed too.
---
Now they also lowered the price for a limited time (even the Power Armor Edition is only $ 59.49)
---
Here's hoping.
---
I use controller too on PC and also gravitate towards shotguns in NW. It is all the more rewarding when you do manage to best the superior mouse and keyboard players. It's all fun until you run into the hackers.
---
How dare he
---
I'm not quite sure it was the outrage - most likely a mistake when placed in the Atom Shop, this has happened before.
---
Yea I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs fair to say (about this sub being represented in that poll). But it‚Äôs a not even ball park for the core players of the game. I just traveled to 8 camps, across the whole map, 5 of which had scrap boxes in visible places. When I‚Äôm in the lobby for nw, all you hear is the moth man and robot dance emotes. So I would say a large portion of the players of this game at least bought it for a month.
---
Carry a few on you, I know some "know it all" will say I'm full of shit, but the game drops legendaries according to what you have on your character to a certain degree. I have over 2200 hrs in game and hardcore farm legendary enemies, this is one observation I will stand by. Good Luck!
---
There is only around 6 mods. If you run super duper and rank 2 of Science expert it's not to hard to craft enough to learn all the mods.
---
They fixed this! Let's take on PC NW hacking next!
---
Ah I see your a man of culture as well
---
&gt;  tips,
---
$5 is pretty close to 20% of whatever's in my budget. Don't need to math out an exact dollar amount.
---
&gt; oil life in your car
---
Is it at the due mileage yet? No? Then it's fine. Yes? Time to change it.
---
The car I drive every day doesn't even have fuel injection, much less a pain-in-the-cunt maintenance minder. I just make note of what the ODO reads when I change it, add 5,000 to that, and when it reaches the number I got I change it again.
---
&gt; pay increases
---
What are these mythological creatures and where can I find one?
---
Also, none of those examples are in any way, shape, or form, related to the probability of getting an item drop in a shitty MMO.
---
500 atoms equates to $5. So it's $5. 
---
I don't mind Fallout 1st, and for the people who were allready spending  $15-20 it's a pretty solid deal for them but I'm not gonna sugar coat it to placate people. The atom shop has always been over expensive.
---
Incorrect.  You need to learn to LEAVE the bush.  Us core NW players are mostly willing to help newer/worse players get ahead.  Once you start popping heads you will get more enjoyment out of it.  IGN:  Huell_Babineaux
---
In addition to the outrage, I know three people that cancelled after seeing it today. If they see jumps in unsubs right when the do dumb things, that‚Äôll light a fire under them for sure.
---
Here's a clip from a while back. Something like this might have happened this the op. It's pretty funny. [https://xboxclips.com/ChiIy/0db2a90b-011e-4aa6-81dd-e90c6c1ca3fe](https://xboxclips.com/ChiIy/0db2a90b-011e-4aa6-81dd-e90c6c1ca3fe)
---
Most of them do, but i like to help out and pay them. I make 25k caps in minutes selling ammo by the hundreds of thousands. Least i can do is let them have some caps for helping me craft that ammo
---
Bethesda: "You can get free outfits with the simple purchase of Fallout 1st. The outfits are only part of the deal with various other benefits included!"
---
anyone have an image showing it as free?
---
Man... That's on you. 
---
Silo runs have already enough problems (lag, cores, more lag, loading times) for you to bring your own. I only did it once because I hate the whole thing, but I took my best weapons, best armor, plenty of ammo, plenty of cores, a spare weapon, plenty of stimpaks and radaway and like five keycards.
---
Plus the promise to loot nothing except ammo. 
---
I could do a second run with you, if you are on PS4. My other four characters are at that point.
---
Should have called it cash money ranger paint, look exactly like five bucks!
---
BGS only listens to wallets and purses, not people.
---
This is more than I expected to get out of any response. I greatly appreciate and respect the time and effort you put into a very thought out and intelligent response. Reading through this has made me unaware of some of the wounds that Bethesda has inflicted and it‚Äôs given me some reasons to rethink my stance on the subject. Thank you for this.
---
Yeah I have been doing a bit a day. Currently at 9k
---
That's awesome! I'd love to see it!
---
Find you some decent allies and you can get 700-800 for winning even with 0 kills.
---
I literally laughed out loud at this.
---
According to the google, xbox one does.
---
And you‚Äôre still playing it now? Because if not, and you‚Äôre basing what you say on the game when it first released, then I would say give it another chance. If you are still playing and you feel this way, I‚Äôm disappointed and sincerely wish you had had a better experience. I don‚Äôt agree with your assessment of the game, but you are entitled to your opinion.
---
But then they would have to be bothered to delete it. Bethesda policy is "Do the least work on ingame content to focus on the atomic shop"
---
They patched it months ago to make it less OP.  It's just a so-so weapon now.
---
I thought it was fascinating that BGS is stating the game is working as it was intended.   I made the point in a comment below that this was initiated after the announcement of the subscription pay wall.  If they never did that, I would have never asked for one.
---
I played the game for a few weeks at launch -- maybe 20 - 30 hours total.  You're right, I didn't provide that context here.
---
I didn't post this to whine that I'm not getting a refund, I posted to show that Bethesda is stating that everything is as intended -- which, given the state of this sub is probably not what users believe.
---
I bought the subscription for the atoms, lol. Haven't even used anything else, but wanted both the bundles. I also grinded atoms everyday/week to get some additional things like the jack-o-lantern loot bag and some vaulting things. Couldn't bring myself to shell out more money for the gladiator suit. They had too many things at once imo. Wish some of them were available this week to grind out.
---
Whatever, I don't care anymore. I was just trying to point out how it's not a good thing to post people's struggles on the internet like it's a funny joke. But, for showing human decency, I and the few other people who agree with me are being downvoted and accused of being the guy that is the subject of the humiliation. The world is REALLY going to shit, fast.
---
Light^wood^laminate
---
Dont do NW before your dailies.
---
I dont even use 5.56. I sell them and max cap in 10 minutes. I crafted 50 000 5.56 26 000 10mm 30 000 .45 38 000 .50cal. 5 000 of every type of ultracite ammo and 100 ultracite fusion and plasma cores
---
I then transfer it to a mule and sell it from there.
---
People then see a lvl 18 character with a camp showing 260 000 ammo.
---
I only put 10k of each ammo at a time in the vendor that is open, so not to get capped out, the rest is in a room with no door so it will still show on the map
---
so this post was removed by moderators, i presume? and all comments have been downvoted. i'd like to know what rule i violated.
---
I have 3 spawn next to my camp south west of 96, they are at a crashed vertibird.
---
Fo76 is a bad game is why. 
---
I came back recently and not much has changed. Ther core loop is exactly the same which is sad. 
---
Eso, while flawed, is nothing like fo76s core issues.
---
No. If you are a first member 19,800=$100 (ignoring all the other stuff you are paying for.). That is 50¬¢/ atom at most.
---
I wish I could give you gold. Best idea I've seen in a while. Tent and scrapbox should be free anyway. 
---
Sadly, they are just taking care if the Fallout 1st members.
---
Oh and i forgot 100 000 5mm for my own use and 50k more .50 cal to give to a friend
---
Would not expect much out of Beth, seems like they are completely disconnected from what the players want. Nothing but bug after preventable bug. I‚Äôm utterly fed up with this game see you on outer worlds guys ‚úåÔ∏è
---
If that was the case, we would have a comment from them. 
---
And data miners said this was paid as well.
---
I also bought it, still don't have my 500 Atoms back. So I made a ticket.
---
I'd take that "Leak" with a ton of salt.
---
Having personally  done  SBQ  event at least 50 + times..
---
In my opinion  SBQ is always predictably,unpredictable.
---
Everyone has their own theory on how to kill SBQ  best.
---
I have seen it land and be killed in a couple of minutes.
---
Have seen it inexplicably fly off in to the Sunset.
---
In my experience being on the Fence,or stood on V9 makes no difference.
---
When she lands she usually smacks everyone off the Fence anyway.
---
There is no way to influence what she is going to do next.
---
I have been with High level players and we have all held off blitzing SBQ in the Sky,hoping she will land and failed the event.Timed out.
---
Tonight on PS4 SBQ flew off for a good 6/7 minutes,before returning.No reason for this,at the event was only 2.3 high level Players,and a couple of level 40+.Just one of those things.Event timed out.
---
And that's a whole lot of the stuff.
---
Excavator Power Armor for all!
---
Yep. This 100% this.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs real messed up. I‚Äôm just gonna do NW at night only, after I do all my dailies
---
Good luck with that.
---
Better yet how about we get some wallpapers in game. Or any non event ingame content. At all.
---
I love how bethesda never replies to these posts
---
No, this was a change. Moments after I bought it too. I made a ticket to get my atoms back. Bethesda actually listened to the player base about how stupid this was. Does that mean there is hope for the future?
---
I wouldn't suggest posting this here as they won't see it
---
Haha gotta love those atoms ;) it gives me something to grind for
---
You know, what you're saying just sounds like they're actually good at the game, and matchmaking is so shit they just group people who are decent and people who are shit at the game.
---
Most of the people responding aren't active players or never have been. So the poll never had a chance of accuracy. Not even taking into consideration the fact that any/all social media is a very small sampling of actual players. In the past week I haven't seen another player yet that doesn't have first. On PlayStation.
---
Less than 1000 now they used to be rare but now they aren‚Äôt because of the event dropping them
---
Upvote!!
---
Well, here's hoping I get my atoms back then! Already submitted the ticket. Now I'm just waiting for a response
---
I kind of agree with you. I've been waiting for PVE servers for FO76 since I pre-purchased the game only to discover that all they have for people like me who just want to play the game and not fight or be targeted by other players is a ridiculous pacifist mode that doesn't really do anything and which makes it impossible to do things that are part of the core of the game. Not only that, you're not really buying a private server nor renting it, you're leasing it, and the price is ridiculous ($99/year). I paid the full original price for the game (got pissed when found out the price was significantly less for others less than a week later and still a bit miffed) and they still haven't implemented things they promised they would.
---
They use to go for a hug amount due to rarity but with the event they‚Äôve dropped value but since the event is over they‚Äôre gonna go up in price but for now I would say 8-10k is what I‚Äôve been seeing
---
Oh definitely. I just generally gravitate towards shotguns in games. They're the most fun to me, partially because I like playing a bruiser sort of character that's about getting up close and both doing and taking damage. 
---
But it's so rewarding to do well. The other day I managed to pick up a combat shotgun and several shells, some grenades and good armor and I actually got three or four kills and made it to the very late game. I got screwed because I ended up at the edge of the arena circle and the only way forward was through a nuke some, so when it forced me to move I took a bunch of rads. Still managed to almost kill the guy that brought me down. 
---
It definitely can be a lot of fun, even to someone like me who usually hates online shooters. But like you said, once you find the hackers it becomes considerably less so.
---
I enjoy resource management
---
Sorry to hear that man, stay strong
---
You should to contact BGS directly, either through their .net, or directly via email/twitter.
---
I am deeply sorry for your loss.
---
Do not see why we need to give the benefit of the doubt to the option that literally involves a 100 dollar payment. That is like saying toilet paper costs only five cents a roll if you buy it in bulk direct from the supply chain minimal number of units 100,000.
---
Atom prices have been stupid from the start, maybe I am dumb for having and willing to spend tons of money but cannot get over the unit prices I am seeing for this junk. 5-15 dollars for skins which are literally a single texture file? That should be like a dollar. 
---
Sure you can grind atoms but they need to calibrate their prices and maybe they would have done better.
---
Agreed its been far too long since we had this bug and they need to either fix it or replace it.
---
All the other stuff you get doesn't matter whatsoever. 
---
500 atoms equals $5. The atom shop is over expensive.  Paying $5-8 for skins is egregious.
---
I have FO1st. I'm not against the subscription at all but I do agree the scrapbox should be for everyone.
---
If they make it free now, then it would still cause trouble lol. People would be pissed cause they bought fallout 1st for it
---
Beautiful.
---
I adore this idea, PLEASE MAKE THIS A THING BETHESDA!
---
Thank you for enabling me to finish my Magazine challenges!
---
Yeah I guess your right, in the end it was to much at once
---
Just part of the free to play model, paywall the good stuff and players will be forced to spend more. Some might say this game isn't free to play while I say we were scammed for those who bought on day one and should of waited a month to get this game for $15 or free when buying a controller in some countries from EB Games.
---
I‚Äôm just saying this is a price for 1st members. Use their pricing. You‚Äôre trying to make it seem worse than it is. Stick to facts.
---
I win a often even with hackers on pc. However, i also lose a lot of matches. Its the name of the game
---
You spend 8.33/mo and get 1650 atoms. Your math doesn‚Äôt add up
---

---
It was a mistake. But sure, go pretend that you're some hero or something
---
Hearing our feedback our ass. You don't bother commenting any post except the few good ones. You guys are pulling the same shit you said you would stop when you started the inside the vault. That better communication promise didn't last for shit bunch of liars.
---
Damn this makes sense
---
It was always a lie and things like this hardly effect the server if implemented correctly. Easy way to see is to think of a notepad being uploaded and downloaded whenever a change is made and its a very small amount of data something companies like google drives, sky drive, and icloud does for free.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs lame. I‚Äôll just get over it...like we always do. There were plenty of days I didn‚Äôt do the challenges, so this is just one more
---
They aren't cheating, they just have Fallout 1st
---
Thats the one, thanks
---
Bloodied Is not overpowered. Bloodied unyielding Is. I think the English word for that Is sinergy. Too much, too crazy. Pair it with mutations and that's it. 
---
An interesting approach is to play unyielding and Bloodied at full health and save its magic until real playing and circumstances triggers it. Like a Monk's last explosion.
---
Yup, be careful
---
I think there's only four mods for it, just get the plan and start making and scrapping them... It's nowhere near the nightmare of getting radium rifle mods
---
Woooe beth actually replied. If only we could?get this kind of attention to hax on pc

I didn't realize repairing the Reactor Pipes Quest could be completely bypassed.
---
Thanks.
---
I tried sending them a letter and an email but nothing back. I figured if it gets enough upvotes and is shared with many people as possible Bethesda has to notice.
---
You're assuming that they won't be able to take them into public servers. I'd put money down that if/when the increase happens they'll be cross compatable.
---
I‚Äôve tried letters and email. Figured this was my last hope.
---
I am basing it on old experience I admit, but I have seen little news that it has gotten better. Was planning on starting up again the week they mentioned fallout first (days before the wastelander delay annoucement). Finally got tonthe weekend and bam, smack in the face, handover money for features that should have existed months ago.
---
I passed on it, but it still sits on my PS4, maybe if Wastelanders turns it around I will create a new character and come back to Appalachia, but it still sounds like the unstable, offensively monetized mess that I left. I had much higher hopes for this game, could even forgive some of the bugginess since I knew they were stretching the engine and were apparently novice at network programming, but it feels like they have a skeleton crew on it and are milking it for money.
---
Maybe I will come back as a content tourist in a little time and it will so blow me away I will be converted.
---
Excuse me your wrong! You also get to pick up toxic sludge for camp consular and pumpkins for the scare house. Maybe we will get a new mission where we pick up glass bottles from trashcans.
---
I think your just ignoring the point. 
---
How does my my math not add up when I'm just saying "$5-8 for skins is egregious." Your the one trying to pull out an abacus to rationalize paying $5-8 for a slight color change.

Servers probably couldn't handle it. It cant compete with fortnite. Its still very basic(1 map) and very rough in its execution. It would guarantee adventure modes death as more attention would be put on NW and selling micros.

Omg yes candy crush Fallout!

In what way would this increase Atomic Shop sales by 6,000%?

You Will find them for 15 caps like I do, or pay 25000 caps and a kidney and a bloodied explosive Masamune from Todd's personal USB stick.

Insane economy, like the real world.

My condolences, I just had a little girl myself, I couldn't imagine what youre family is going through. I hope you hear back from BGS.
---
Sorry i didn‚Äôt understand
---
Don't say that or Bethesda might do it and if they do that I will score less then what I get now from 60-100.
---
True. People just like getting crazy. I have lots of some, none of others.
---
I remember before the game came out, when all the youtubers were the only ones who got to play the game, they said that when you scrap junk, it's weightless.
---
Then they said you can't have all the junk you want because of server stability.
---
Then they give subscribers a box to carry infinite junk.
---
Hmm...
---
Neither of them exist yet lore wise so I dint think so
---
Well it isnt ncr its riot armor but really just seems like a way to sell outfits because really the riot gear looks cool
---
*Listen to what i say not what i do*. Famous quote from some guy

It is. :)
---
You buy the Fallout 76 game, and Nuclear Winter is free to play as much as you want.
---
Oh that wasn't rad x he ingested.....kapow
---
as an ex-STW player, i completely agree with this statement.  the second fortnite BR started gaining steam paragon got shut down and stw got a skeleton crew
---
Hell based on logic something so big and HEAVY(proof are the bones we get) that it should only be able to stay in the air for a short time at best and should be grounded when found normally.
---
Hacking would be even worse, although it's already pretty bad. Maybe if we had some sort of anti-cheat it'd be a bit better. When TF2 went f2p, the hackers came out in full force.
---
The lobby would be flooded with 13yo's spending mommy's money on new outfits?
---
Bethesda "Done we fixed"
---
Players "Queen doesn't drop awards now"
---
Bethesda "Omg we did what you asked"
---
Theres a bug that makes your dailies null if you do NW first.
---
My sincerest condolences. There must be no greater pain.....
---
I think the reason why they don't is because they really aren't prepared to throw all of their weight and development time into it.  The issues with cheaters and aimbots demand a more proactive response than they can muster.  As long as Nuclear Winter remains a jokey little side mode, they probably figure they can overlook these problems.

Junk. He will buy junk.

This is one thing that needs to be addressed ASAP. I play on console and have not (to my knowledge) experienced someone cheating. I wonder if it's difficult with aimbots because of V.A.T.s or something.
---
Fuck me. It's been a full year and they are still fixing bugs that shouldn't have been there at launch... The combat rifle .44 .45 ammo bug was reported A FUCKING YEAR AGO! Also 'ash piles and goo piles now despawn allowing respawn.' seriously .. what? How the fuck is this a year old game and this is just being fixed...
---
Wow that's a lot of subscribers from a subreddit that's pretty anti F1st subscription. 
---
Does this mean like 40%+ of the regular player base subbed?
---
I wouldn't necessarily make it "compete" with Fortnite, more like use F2P as a push towards Adventure Mode.
---
That was a just a gladiator costume that was up for sale last week
---
Its not legion armor though
---
With Butcher‚Äôs Bounty Perk equipped!

I tried STW after playing BR and was so confused. I wonder if they added the ability to nuke your little starting island and start over with the tutorial.
---
I made a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ds2exo/theory_nw_will_be_f2p_after_the_beta_is_over/) earlier but it wasn't received well by this sub.

Yea...no. Of all the things that could be happening, Bethesda asking for subscriptions and then cancelling the game is not one of them. 
---
In a year or two, maybe. But it makes zero sense for them to invite the tide of criticism they got (including from games sites) and then just turn the game off. The bad will that would result would not be worth the money they got from subs, which is a drop in the ocean for a company like this.

In a way, it's already happened, your daughter is immortalised in the game as your character and Bethesda have done this before, I'm sure if someone mentions any of the community managers, I'm sure they'd spread this story to the devs or higher ups and potentially do it for you

I like OuterWorlds.  It has a lot of similarity to FO NV.  Dialogue.  Companions.  Companion Quests.  Lots of set legendaries.  No or limited RNG.  RPG levelling.  Similar clever/humour in dialogue, and main story line dystopian themes, with similar 'choices have consequences' feel.  Even the space ship feels a lot like using Lucky 38 presidential suite as a base complete with crafting tables.
---
Not as many glitches so far.
---
I thought it was some new bug ! I first noticed it a couple day's ago and it happened several times since! Really annoying ! I was recording the gameplay and when i watched it in slow motion ,i could clearly see that the guy i downed kept shooting me while on his knees . This happened a few times ,different people .

76 is not an mmo. It‚Äôs a brushed up single player experience. You usually have 15-20 people on a server, the closest you‚Äôll ever get is the scorched earth event but otherwise it has small population and interaction, and basically no content.

I don't play destiny so I don't really know about it. What I mean is, in the old days, unlimited storage is free, there is no "pay money for moar storage".   
---
Imagine playing diablo back then and you can buy unlimited storage for $$$. Its either unlimited or limited storage, depending on the game design, not depending on the money you cough up.
---
Back then the expansion thing is as big as half of the game, unlike DLC nowadays which only add little things, with the notorious sims having 31 expansions. Some game nowadays feels like a botched version of complete game and they add bit by bit the part of the game for months or years until it at least complete. Usually the culprit is online game.... and SIMS. Sims is like a game cut into 40 separate pieces and sold separately. That is shit.  
---
In Fallout 3, we get 5 good DLC. In Fallout 4 we get 3 good DLC and 3 questionable DLC. All of those are paid DLC. For Fallout 3 DLC, all 5 DLC. All those 5 DLC are good and worth the money since they add more things to the base game (the base game is already good too, unlike FO76.)    
---
&gt; My stance is the scrap boxes shouldn‚Äôt exist period. Inventory management is part of the game. 
---

My condolences.  My son has many chds and RSTS too we almost lost him last year. I hope Bethesda Grant's this.

That‚Äôs the one of the best overall, i have couple more up to date builds on my channel

Haven't seen it myself, but it removes the effects of the primary perk from the weapon after you reload?

Ohhhh ok I‚Äôll check, thanks for the heads up

Actually I bought 1st for the NCR armor and 1600 atoms. Hoarding junk before my month is over is a bonus.
---
is this a copy pasta
---
Very, very, very doubtful seeing how they've been implementing everything so far.
---
Hi theorcakingg,
---
I would suggest: Selling legendaries at your vendor when you can, Get the pharma farma perk so you get additional aid chances when opening up first aid kits, doctors bags, and things of that nature. Also, pickup regular weapons and sell them to vendors with the hard bargain perk cards. Also, complete as many events as possible. Rinse and repeat each day so you can earn the 1500 caps per day and additional caps by selling what items you sell at your vendor station/s.
---
You'd think this would be a no brainer..
---
I was still being chased by the cargo drop as of patch 13, though I don't think it persisted between sessions anymore. Haven't done it on patch 14. I haven't had a freeze in awhile, so maybe fixed. Had different kind of freeze a few times, where the audio makes my ears want to bleed though. Those were completely random.
---
Again a no brainer...
---
I had the same question. Is it the design logic because it is originally sold in the Whitesprings by Cap'n in the toy store?
---
It just works. 
---
But really, this is a new glitch to me. I play on both Xbox and PC. It seems weird to me that there would be a ps4 exclusive glitch. But hey, here we are.
---
I sell all my outfits from 1-20 caps, I don't really care for cosmetics, and hate having my appearal clustered.
---
Eh, get an ant-cheat setup and I'll agree. Just played three games in a row getting auto aimed/1 tapped across the map.
---
Glad I could help in some way :)
---
Yes it is.
---
Still doesn‚Äôt make sense anyway. If its a reward for it in the event, and a variant in the game is functional, it should be
---
That's the thing about spouting so many lies, people have no reason to give you the benefit of the doubt anymore. Even if the smaller amount of server stress is the honest reason, people have no reason to believe Bethesda or trust that they'll only keep it to stuff that isn't possible on the public servers.
---
I cross posted this to r/gaming in tears as I am holding my 3 month old and father of 3 I can't imagine what you guys are going through but if I know anything Reddit can make things happen. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else I'm on PS4 also but I am taking a break from fo76 atm.
---
Where the part where I said Fallout 1st made me stop playing or I summed up microtransactions as "bullshit"
---
I agree. It makes the actual Fireman uniform variant not desirable for use in its intended environment.
---
And you still can. It just won't involve junk items.
---
Is it possible that we could get a picture of the whole of the wasteland in the Nuclear Winter style of the map? So you can see the buildings and roads?

What are your specs?

It's a costume helmet, not a real helmet

Doesn‚Äôt say Fireman Costume

Hi, I'm Bob and I'll be your proctologist today...

It is never wise to set anticheats to just ban for high score values, irregardless of how unlikely a score is.
---
I'm sorry I really hope to see this become a thing
---
I'm sorry for your loss. Also Bethesda has done this in the past. Both in 76 and nuka world so there is a chance.
---
Disposition every month I was suppose to. I got replay them saying on day of purchase. So if you bought it October 3. Nice 3 would be your next drop. Atoms every month. The riot skin for the outfit was free again after I religiously. First it was 500‚Äôcaps.
---
They can be priced at 200 but that doesn't mean they sell. And who's dumber they guy buying the weapon or armor with cash or the guy endlessly farming to get a good rng roll or enough to trade for one on the marketplace.
---
The higher the price, the higher the expectation of quality
---
It works for me, it‚Äôs worth a shot
---
Can you wear a helmet under it? Because I want to have the mole helmet on my character because it has defense but I dont wear it because I cant put a mask over it.
---
That would be swell...

I was trying to move my camp recently and got camp blocked by that thing. Was wondering wtf was happening

One whole headpiece

Evan I made a Outpost at his home and fortified it up to 500 defense with 21 settlers and called it Evans Keep
---
I use the Strength perk card that lowers the weight of chems. Then I get the luck perk card that allows me to search chem containers twice for additional goodies. 
---
Combine the two and you can get some really good chems. Even with low charisma there is money to be made.
---
Why would you say that? Bethesda has been notorious in the past for not talking openly about New Vegas.
---
I always viewed the ranger armour being put behind the paywall as a cynical FU to players who loved NV more and kept asking for stuff from that game.

Barely anything‚Äôs from what I remember. It‚Äôs less then a turret.

Apparently there is a work around for this glitch.  If you reload while crouched it wont bug

Yup, same here. I sell everything for 5 to 20 caps. Goes fast and makes people very happy!

As one of the people who've been helping we have been giving Bethesda an insane amount of free labor out of love of what the game could have been, and the promises we've been given.

The fact that a few other of the group, besides the OP, who've provided Bethesda with countless detailed reports of bugs, exploits, hacks etc all got suspended at the same time, with no traction on the reports and in some cases the tickets sit completely unresponded to more than a week later is "Problematic at best, when you look at the time they've invested.

So even if it was they wouldn't stand a chance. Now that's good thinking.
---
Probably between 25-50 caps. Not sure how much you can build, but I am pretty sure it's a significant limit.
---
If your discord was doing thousands of SBQ you would know better than to do the fight near V9. I never fight the queen on the ground if it's my nuke, you just build a basic camp with a big open floor and she lands on it every time.

Get creative, I make basketball courts, Pok√©mon stadiums, whatever I want as long as it has an open floor area and the queen lands right in the middle.

They changed how the SBQ works, you only need to hit her once with one little tap to get credit, they removed the minimum damage requirement.

Millions to be made as a legendary farmer, especially if you know how to make 3* legendary enemies. Knowledge is money

I commented earlier that I haven't played on PC, I agree with you 100% though. I think V.A.T.s being a thing in game really fucks with anti cheat, however I will admit that I don't know anything about game development to actually confirm or deny it.
---
What‚Äôs the best way to find 3* enemies
---
BSG has not accurately presented its product to consumers and consumers are upset that they paid for something that was misrepresented. When you make bad products consumers are going to respond.

Nope- neither faction are a thing. MAYBE they could introduce some of the masters army but that‚Äôs it
---
New Vegas was the worse FO and I absolutely wish it didn't exist, i'd buy fallout76 100 times over before i play through NV again.
---
Well they soft recon BoS just to kill them off for loot and story. Super mutants soft reconed to add a common fallout enemy to 76. Time line wise not happening as Beth would be hard reconning Fallout:NV. 
---
The riot gear was pre-war gear so it's possible to be found.
---
I fully expected to pay 500 atoms for it. Cool. More atoms in my pocket
---
Well, no it isn't. People inject weapons with infinite damage into the game and can literally one shot her, I've seen it happen dozens of times. 
---
Besides that, a sneak melee build can do 3.5x sneak attacks with a bloody power fist for upwards of 10k damage per hit and kill her in just a few seconds. Even a bloody sneak pistol build can solo her in 2 minutes or less.
---
you can't just tag the queen with a pistol. you have to do substantial damage in order to get loot.
---
The fact that they are charging money on a broken game that you already had to buy for things that should have been in base game that came out broken is disgusting. There is no way that people in QA didn't find these things, they weren't listened to and then they still charged money and feigned ignorance. Thank Law for outer worlds, we don't need Bethesda anymore.

You're fellow Filthy Casuals also salute YOU!

The fire responder one works like a gas mask. Tested out the other day.

The mask protects your from the elements without the -2 perception which is nice.

If you blueprint a ceiling to build on top of her, would it keep her grounded?

Score!!  So happy for you üôå

Hacking doesnt count. And the world record for a queen kill is like 5 seconds and that was a full team

500 to 1k is pretty normal. Bit a lot of them do it for free

Yea that would be great too. We also get on Xbox chat a lot because the game chat is so buggy.  So am easy way to switch between Xbox chat and game chat would be nice as well. But I understand that would be an even bigger issue because Xbox might not let it fly.  
---
We‚Äôve had issues with in game chat where  some members in the group can hear some members but not others. So you might be able to hear someone but they can‚Äôt hear you another person in the group can here then but you can‚Äôt hear that person.

When she's locked in a constantly repeating stagger animation, it cancels the landing, even if she's crippled.
---
Wow that's fucking bullshit
---
Lol "world record". A full team of power fists with full food buffs, bobblehead and magazines and nukashine will evaporate the queen the moment she hits the ground. It's a very trivial fight.
---
No remove bash damage first, then limb damage, then water breathing, then lock pickers, and then 250dr while reloading but not before they remove nocturnal though

Maybe Fallout 1st will finally fund an anti-cheat. Even punkbuster would but a stop to the absolutely ridiculous state hacking is in right now.

That‚Äôs what I was thinking

Made camp below top of the world, start out going to the farm nearby to check for plan by armor station there then go to railroad next door. Run down to kill sentry bot for fusion core sometimes it's legendary. Near it is a hidden space in overturned rail car. Spawns a bobblehead and or a magazine in there, head south towards whitesprings hitting the railroad houses that have magazines along with bank that also has magazine. Check outside bank nuka cola machine for colas. I no longer use water at all. There is also a chance for a legendary around the bank. Hit up the rail house, a plan, mod, potential legendary in there also. Go next door under bridge for another possible legendary. Then to shack with supermutants, possible magazine, mod, and legendary. Then hit whitesprings. Then check daily challenges. I have a shitload of magazines ü§ó.

I thought I may have somehow scrapped all my tick blood sacs and wasn't sure what all had gone missing, but now I know I wasn't crazy it had. I'm just glad my display cases protected what they could.
---
Power fists arent near as powerful as meathooks and they were dealing around 6-7k damage per hit. Literally just look it up on youtube. They kill it in 2 seconds but like you said these are peoplle set up to kill her as fast as possible not 1 guy 1 shotting it

I bet the no is like 6 very angry players voting over and over

I agree with what is mentioned above, another option is to put a note on (I can't use the name of the web), but you should let us know if you do that so that all of us can support you, and if you are not familiar with (web), you can request it in this same post (you just need to edit this post saying: "Can anyone make a post about it on (web)?" or something similar)

It was originally (not sure if still) in the toy store of the Whitesprings where the item still didn't have the effects of a gas mask, it was assumed to be a costume from the beginning and thanks to Mischief Night it was all but confirmed to be a costume.
---
Wrong. The latest patch makes the power fist better. I have bloody ss+1str version of almost every melee weapon in the game and the new best weapon is the power fist because the perk "covert ops" is applying its bonus to every unarmed type weapon except the meat hook. Combine that with "ninja" and you get 3.5x sneak attacks, not to mention the higher base damage of the power fist scales better with the 8 food buffs for higher damage when you are fully buffed.
---
Go try it yourself, the meat hook is old news.
---
When you really have these problems you don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm going to make a reddit account today and ask for everyone to give me upvotes because I have these problems in my life and should feel bad for me‚Äù trust me humans don‚Äôt think like this and this story is fishy enough if you read it entirely.
---
Awesome thank you for the response and info üëçüèª
---
Be nice if we saw more action against NW cheaters...
---
3 @ Moonshiner's Shack, 4 @ Gorge Junkyard, other places are hit/miss...
---
Give it until the Wastelanders update, then come back
---
Oh...my bad. I'm not to that point yet, so I thought it was easy to tag like the other legendaries I've dealt with.
---
Nah she clips right through the base all the time when doing the dust attack, she sometimes lands underneath it too. It's funny to get a melee hit in as she's flying by.
---
Interestingly enough there isn't an option for PS.4
---
An many of us know how non-existent refunds are with Playstation. 
---
Wonder who I would need to contact here in the States? (U.S)
---
B.B.B??
---
Havent looked at the latest patch notes
---
When's that scheduled for May I ask?
---
Drink nukashine
---
It was going to be late this year but they postponed it to early 2020. No solid date yet, just somewhere between January 1st and March 31st
---
Luckily you don't play on PC then!
---
Oof, alrighty thanks for the help
---
I‚Äôve enjoyed it for around 1400 hrs give or take. Still playing it. It‚Äôs a lot better than it used to be but it‚Äôs really getting hard to talk myself into playing it these days out of boredom. Once you hit end game there isn‚Äôt much to do
---
no problem
---
Also don't worry, you gave your best trying to help them with your detailed bug reports they chose to ignore mostly and move on to other shady things
---
It's obviously not in the patch notes, just like the meat hook using double perks wasn't in the patch notes. I found out through testing.
---
Keep in mind that there is only a charge for muling. 
---
Couriers assist in high value trades (I.e. escrow services) free of charge. 
---
Muling, however, I agree on the 500-1k. 
---
I charged a guy 400 caps to hold about 20 weapons while he chanted characters.
---
Thanks for that fix.
---
XB1? I have a few for trade... and I can do all mods except auto...
---
I tipped 5k this week cause they were amazing.
---
Honey beasts during meat week I picked up 2... have a few for trade if you‚Äôre on XB1, also I can do all mods except auto...
---
I'm going to have to play skeptic here.
---
You have a brand new account. Within 4 minutes of creating your account, you posted this story, and re-posted it until auto-mod allowed you to get it through.
---
[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhn1m1/what_can_i_do_to_be_immortalized_in_game_because/) a few weeks ago also had some of the same structure as your story, citing other games that have had similar memorials to fans. (If you want to see how that post looked use Removeddit)
---
I'm not asking for proof here, as that'd be morbid. But, regardless of whether I am right, if you truly expect to get a memorial for someone in a game, I think it's very likely that someone from that studio would reach out to you expecting proof. A reddit post by itself does not get someone immortalized in a video game.
---
Haha very funny
---
Give me that fresh paint.
---
I suspect unyielding will be nerfed soon so that it does not stack.  It seems inevitable, given its popularity, and game companies biased toward nerfing rather than buffing.  Remember when two shot was really two shot?  And that got nerfed even before everyone had one.  :(. Enjoy it while it lasts!
---
He‚Äôs not using it for anything though, it‚Äôs just a poll.
---
Not Trump, Winnie the Pooh
---
Well i didnt know that it wasnt in the oatch notes because i havent looked at them. And of course the meat hook using double wouldnt be in the patch notes hasnt it been like that since launch
---
Good ideas,
---
With due time and the release of the Wastelander's free DLC, we'll see more raider orientated items.
---
Is this actually a thing? I only have three plans left (solar plans) to learn and the last three runs standard expert  then standard and didn‚Äôt get any plans.
---
I've had this experience as well but that's why I don't claim workshops lol unless I'm trying to farm xp and there are better ways to do that lol.  It's just one of those things where if people can be shitty they will be. Not saying there are good guys out there. But some of the high level guys just want to be ass hats instead of helping new players out.
---
You Monster!
---
I've encountered this once.
---
I guess Mr. Lvl 200+ felt like taking my caps 35 at a time but was too lazy to power up the power station himself. 
---
Literally waited till I finished it then popped me as soon as I exited the plant. 
---
Repeatedly. 
---
Real tough guy.
---
Yep - seems to be.
---
It‚Äôs a dumb system,  rng is obnoxious.  They could give the special pieces through challenges, like they did with named legendaries, and we would find that more fair.
---
They just silence everything that effects them, and silence those who don't comply in the community (kinda like China)
---
Glad I stopped playing. Had my fun 500 hours after release but then the game only made bad decisions. Battle royale was the last straw. And now I come back to the subreddit to see theyre milking all the mmo addicts for p2w content. LOL
---
Same thing, multiple times, 3 times it was the same guy so I guess it's a small world
---
Yeah...no.
---
Yeah, used to when the ammo factory was bugged awhile back, nobody wanted it. Now, every time you try and claim it theres at least a lvl 150 strolling up with a TSE .50 cal mg
---
It's the Spacers Choice....
---
PREACH!
---
we can dream right
---
Wow, what a coincidence...I came here ready to complain about that exact player :)
---
I can‚Äôt really add anything except to say this stuff is insane and I totally agree.
---
No. 
---
Some bugs are gone. Others are back. It's the same game. 
---
Well, ok, there is a battle royale mode if you really love that idea. Throw in a few new small quests and a new "dungeon". But that's basically it. 
---
It's the same. Wait for wastelanders to come out. That may make the game playable again but that's a ways off.
---
Anyway, that's how you can melee the queen down in seconds. Even without food buffs I'm hitting for an easy 4k per swing while in caution and take out massive chunks of her health but she always flies away when she regens so the fight typically lasts until she lands a second time.
---
I only played one game and I died pretty quickly but I stayed to spectate. My teammates were on fire, they survived until the end, there was only one other person left. They ended up losing because the circle closed in on all 3 of them. I didn't think the circle could get that small. That other person somehow won.
---
I agree  with  you unless they pic up a full set of one of those nuclear launch codes  but still
---
Thats funny its genre is a mmo.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
I would like something like a servo armor design with Christmas themes, or if not, do something like Forza Horizon 4 that fills the snow scene for winter events (in addition it would reduce technical problems a bit by putting a neutral color on whole map, white)
---
I just don't get it man, I know PvP is a new thing for Fallout and things like balance, concept, etc all take time...but how they could just launch this back in June and still have absolutely zero anti-cheat as a baseline, whatsoever, is beyond me. If tiny ass little indie games can have FairFight or BattlEye, there is absolutely no excuse for one of the biggest AAA developers in gaming. None. It's not a big ask. Get BattlEye. It's not the end-all fix, but it's sure as hell a whole lot better than literally nothing at all.
---
I avoid this sub mainly because its toxic in most ways. Also, Outer Wilds isn't as good as it was hyped up to be. It's not a replacement for any game and definitely isn't spectacular.
---
What's different in this patch? I'm pretty sure Covert Operative has always applied to unarmed weapons.
---
Bethesda went full sellout ripping off their customer base who bought the game by turning it to a subscription based one (and a pretty expensive for the kind of garbage they've accustomed us)
---
Next single player Bethesda game better have Denuvo+++  or I'll rip the shit out of them !
---
Wow, way to go. Maybe start doing that more fucking often.
---
Should be a mutation to see stealthed enemys
---
Noice
---
Vending meds ammo and plans.  Killing mutants. Selling bulk scrap. Outfits for idiots.
---
Making the scrap box available for everyone and also making the tent available for everyone but maybe behind a quest would get me to sign up for the subscription. Until then, nope.
---
I don‚Äôt see it
---
thanks for that
---
Yes. It‚Äôs classic f2p scam model. Suck em in with a fun game that you role through until you hit the programmed issues points that force you to chunk out the change to keep and improve the experience. 
---
Only, I see Bethesda putting parts of WASTELANDERS functionality‚Äî-namely the consequence/results of the players decisions and actions ‚Äîbehind the first subscription. 
---
THAT will probably lead to a successful class action against the game in the US. Before that you can argue and debate whether they‚Äôve broken cosmetic only promise. But getting us to become addicted to private servers BEFORE the dlc is so we rely on them to the point we won‚Äôt raise a fuss.  Plus I think they are winnowing our the non payers so the effect of partial dlc pay won‚Äôt be large. However, for those of us who preordered the game at $79 with the absolute promise of no p2w and FREE dlc that‚Äôll be a clear breach and they‚Äôll be facing new suits. 
---
I doubt we will even get a 5. This is 5. They probably are also introducing private servers to try and link them to an expansion that‚Äôll ostensibly be 5 but will link into 76 on your private server. 
---
$100 just to be allowed a bigger storage box??? Oh, and a slightly less laggy and freezing server experience?  Those of you who paid, you do realize you paid $100 to hold more DIGITAL items and be able to play a bit longer with AS MANY lags as normal...somehow I don‚Äôt think those are worth $100...and do you not see the insanity. You get atoms...to buy items that you need to store...so they included increased stash so you can store more and still have space....to buy items that you need to store...loop loop loop.   INSTEAD of a business model of free INCREASED STASH so MORE people will buy stuff BECAUSE THEY CAN STORE IT.  And loop it that way.  It‚Äôs all in how you start and what you emphasize. 
---
Bethesda is CREATING the ingame necessity to buy rather than incentivizing you to buy. If I buy an item in game I EXPECT THE GAME to save and store it. NOT to MAKE me buy to be ABLE to keep buying stuff. 
---
Rant complete. 
---
Desire to stop replaying NV complete. 
---
Desire to log onto 76, quelled...
---
It is interesting that most that post seem to drop 76 and replay NV....
---
Let me just offer my upvote and condolences.  I‚Äôm not too high level (just shy of 30 in MW) and am grateful I went PS4 route.
---
It was just a way to pull in some Fallout 1st subscribers, not to mention NCR wasn‚Äôt a thing and won‚Äôt be until 83 years after the events of Wastelanders.
---
They‚Äôre getting the hint that people will pay for nostalgia, so we could very well see an Enclave Tesla and original Hellfire Power Armour skin for the X-01 or Fallout 3 skins for the powerfist and Deathclaw gauntlet or even unique outfits like the ghoul mask, the antagoniser, sexy sleepwear, merc variant outfits, roving trader and the various settler outfits to name a few
---
A new feature to fallout 1st, play on dedicated servers with punk buster on, just 29.99 a Month!!
---
I don‚Äôt see what you did there.
---
Chameleon armor does that. Anyone can where it. Berry mentats sometimes work if he is within range. Whoever is defending the workshop is generally at a bit of a disadvantage. Staying crouched and using cover helps to avoid being Vats'ed to some extent. You can also use stealthboys. I would also recommend crouching before you fast travel to your workshop and while you are in it so you don't appear on the map.
---
&gt;Sadly, they are just taking care if the Fallout 1st members.
---
Yet another reason I haven't got the subscription. I refuse to get it while people who can't afford it have their issues get ignored just because they're not rich enough to sign up for Fallout 1st.
---
I tried but his gun killed me in like 1 or two shots
---
I tried but his gun killed me in 1/2 shots
---
It's a joke with my friends, we're all trying to group and hit up NW for the grind, oh but let me just finish my dailies, an hour later....
---
People are using cheats to farm xp so they can get the Hallowe'en rewards faster.
---
Might be an idea to let the tent be a 1st benefit so there‚Äôs an actual reason left to subscribe other than private servers which I think should get a free locally hosted version for up to 4 players
---
Sorry you had to deal with that.
---
Exactly. I'll believe Bethesda cares about people (and will also subscribe to Fallout 1st) when the scrap box is available for everyone, and the tent is also available for everyone, but maybe behind a quest with skins for it in the Atom Shop.
---
Pardon the grammar, please. I'm exhausted.
---
Wow that's a lot of downvotes.  Literally about 25% of the queens I fought I wasn't getting credit for.  And I'm max dang heavy gunner with a be lmg.  That's how bad it is on PC.  Hackers and meat hooks everywhere.  I have a list multiple pages long of all the known hackers I've personally discovered in game.  If I see them near the queen, I don't even bother going anymore, because it'll be dead before I can deal 1k dmg.
---
Apparently it's not cool to have a strategy to fight the blatant cheaters and greifers?  They know what they are doing, they do it intentionally to prevent others from getting loot.
---
I guess it's apparently old news with the update.  We'll see if it actually works, or if the queen will just fly off the map still.
---
That. Is. INCREDIBLE. I never would have thought of that!
---
PS4 pro and normal PS4. On PC i got no problems at all running the game.
---
If that is true, have no reason not to believe you, that is utter bullshorts. Had it happen because NW, but at least there is a work around. Just blank no daily or (gulp) weekly, rage against the machine! Put in tickets please, submitted tickets and reddit seem to be the only possible way to get through.
---
For christ sake! The op was from my FB group, I saw his daughter's picture, he tried to contact Bethesda in other way weeks ago and I recommended he goes here. The hell is wrong with you people?
---
Of course. One of the perks for subscribers is reduced or free atom shop stuff, so long as you‚Äôre subscribed, on top of everything else.
---
Hacking does count.  Because there are hackers in the game, and lots of them.  More every day because there are no punishments.  And there's nothing you can do but hope the hacker won't steal the queen all for themself as I've seen them do many times.  Thousands of rounds wasted and I got no kill credit (this was a low level char where I would struggle to get credit even without cheater).
---
Bethesda corrected it a few hours ago, anyone who paid will be refunded the Atoms
---
To quote Pete Hines,
---
‚Äúwell, it's not an MMO. so if that has you worried, you can worry less.‚Äù
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1045330591305076737
---
It‚Äôs just a shared single player rpg without the rpg.
---
I am okay with a monthly subscription that helps keep the game afloat. What I am not okay with is a monthly subscription that gives me a marked advantage over those without the subscription (endless junk for more, easier crafting, and a tent that saves people a lot on fast travel caps and saves you the caps you'd originally have to spend if you wanted to place down your camp long enough to access stash box so you aren't walking to the nearest train station while overencumbered). When they adjust the subscription to just being servers and atoms, then I'll get the subscription.
---
I was seriously so pleasantly surprised when it turned out to actually be a really fun game mode. I thought riding the battle royale wave was such a lame thing for Bethesda to do, but it's honestly a great mode. Which makes me 10x more upset that it's just being completely ignored on PC. Not even a "sorry guys, we're working on it" to tide us over. Just completely ignored.
---
I saw that guy in game too.
---
Unfortunately it is the only PvP in game, that lets asshats still use all of there specifically collected PvP gear and build. Hard to fault them in that respect. IF that was your fo76 thing, now you only have workshops. Beth just needs to put some useable form of PvP back into the game. There are many good suggestions here, from reopening survival to making passive part of choosing world's, ect
---
Take workshop, get resources, leave area.
---
I never bother building anything on a public server because all the high level players are usually bored but too addicted to leave so they go and take the workshop for something to do.
---
It‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt stand up to higher level players on my original character...I just couldn‚Äôt be bothered.
---
And on my new character I‚Äôm not trying to build an overpowered sneak ranged or melee behemoth but just a solid pistol one for something different...so no PvP lol.
---
Stopped playing around the same time as you did, did just about everything and couldnt be bothered spending hundreds of hours farming for digital items in a make believe world.
---
And as for outer worlds, I uninstalled that after a week, nothing but a scavenge sim with fetch quests and a bad shooter.
---
I just woke up. You mean I'll get the green version (and coming versions?) for free?
---
I second this. I was getting the Atom bundles every time they came out, whether I was interested in the additional outfit or not. Also occasionally got the other packs when I was a few atoms short on stuff or didn't want to grind. I genuinely thought the money I was spending would go toward fixing the game, fool that I was. Then the very same day that they released the Arktos Pharma glorified reskin of the fridge, I crashed five times in five minutes at Fort Defiance. Since then, I haven't spent a single cent on 76.
---
Considering I play with a group that has probably killed a cumulative 1500 queens and this hasn't been observed/discovered, I'm doubting it's even true.  Or just as important, i'm doubting it's a big deal.  What's the problem, are you trying to use that damn meat hook build and ruin the event for everyone else.  Normally people are happy to see it basically stationary in the air.  You can't really miss it, so you just get under and light it up with a Gatling plasma because ammo for them is basically free.
---
I love outer worlds but it's a criminally short game. It's only about 30 hours or so.
---
But you're paying for fallout 1st so is it really free
---
Give it to everyone! FO first subscriber vote.
---
I want an assultron patrolling my camp.
---
Why the hell would I buy a year of that crap. I can throw $22 away, but not $180 lol.
---
Neither the person in your post, your other customers of future customers will see this. The subreddit is a literal fraction of the player base. These posts are such fucking cringe
---
Yes, you‚Äôll be able to claim the Riot Ranger and Desert Ranger Skins for free as they become available, however I can‚Äôt confirm for the Elite and Advanced Ranger armors as they might rotate every few months as part of the subscription offerings.
---
But Riot and Desert Ranger are 100% free skins to be absolutely clear
---
&gt; those who remain playing it and patronising this sub are the most die hard players.
---
 Yeah  I agree. I believe the poll is an accurate representation of this sub Reddit- which is probably a very small size of the player population.
---
Send that clip to Bethesda via their report a player form on their website.
---
I know it's free now (which is hilarious when you consider all the subscribers that accuse the non subscribers of wanting everything for free), but this is exactly why I wouldn't feel sorry for subscribers had they left it not be free.
---
There's so many hackers that I watched a squad of 4 aimbotters lose to people sitting underneath the map.  There was legit at least 8 of them on one game.
---
The mutation drops invisibility when you fire. The armor keeps you invisible as you fire.
---
Grenades are usually pretty good for forcing people to move. That is when you vats back.
---
Although I agree it‚Äôs probably a fake account, grief can do weird shit to people.
---
But having extra pair or arms would really help, like you can eat while playing.
---
Yeah, I didn't throw anything valuable in it, just in case it didn't rez back, but it was just a bunch of weapons to scrap. Would have probably taken me another 5 mins to walk back or find somewhere to scrap, but once I put it in the scorch beast I was home in under 2 mins
---
&gt; Made me mad and sad and I thought it should get some visibility.
---
Yes, let's make it very visible so that everyone can know that when Bethesda mistreated them they decided it wasn't enough that only they were mistreated and decided to spread it to everyone by discontinuing the tools those people relied on. I'm sorry some people got mistreated by Bethesda, but taking it out on the community is the worst way to combat it.
---
when the game launched they were "pay to win" everyone freaked out about, bonus carryweight, XP, etc, all for Atoms
---
It doesn't apply to the meat hook.
---
I did, I just think it's something people need to keep posting about until it's at least even acknowledged to be a real issue. Everyone complains about cheats in every game, but this game mode is drowning in hacks. More games have cheaters than don't. It's horrible.
---
OH WELL, THERE'S FLO ON MY LEFT AND THEN THERE'S MARY ON MY RIGHT
---
AND JANIE IS THE GIRL WELL THAT I'LL BE WITH TONIGHT
---
AND WHEN SHE ASKS ME, WHICH ONE I LOVE THE BEST?
---
I TEAR OPEN MY SHIRT AND I SHOW "ROSIE" ON MY CHEST
---
CAUSE I'M THE WANDERER
---
YEAH, THE WANDERER
---
I ROAM AROUND, AROUND, AROUND
---
You can't use that type of logical argument with this hate train. It's just different enough for the Outrage Bois to dismiss entirely. I tried and tried and kept getting "uh, akshually, that's an MMO" response. I learned to just let it go.
---
This so irritates me. For every few nice players, there are bad ones, and it‚Äôs always a lottery. I hope this never happens to you again, godspeed.
---
Him among so many, and they're name spoofing too. Using streamer's names and do the same things.
---
And the last time you did anything was 5 months ago. I'm betting this is the original account.
---
Gotta find it and make it, my man. The apocalypse happened remembet?
---
&gt; Maintaining a server takes time and cost money. Bandwidth, which map76 used a lot of, cost money.
---
Yes, if you choose not to go with any of the free ways to host a website you will have to pay money. To my knowledge the following map has no server costs associated with it.
---
https://dan-parker.github.io/Fallout76-Map/
---
It *is* possible to target a nuke on a team if you use a terminal to reveal enemies, but it's pretty dang unlikely to get 4 codes, a briefcase, hack a terminal and drop in a nuke in the first minute. 
---
Impossible 3 times in a row.
---
That's right, but you said "the latest patch makes the power fist better" and I was wondering what changed
---
Yeah I couldn‚Äôt even get a shot off, I would die as soon as I come back to the workshop
---
I‚Äôd be in a NW private match with myself and still find a way to lose
---
MMO is abbreviation for Massive Multiplayer Online. Massive meaning a single server can hold thousands of even millions of people on that one server, on the lines of WoW and such. Fallout only holds 24 on each server, a mere 8 on private servers. It's not an MMO and I doubt it'd ever be able to run as an MMO especially in it's current state. It is however, an online action/survival RPG. üëç
---
The latest patch was when I discovered it. My apologies if it has been around before then. Either way the power fist is king.
---
Thanks for the tipüëç
---
I don't understand, just ignore it and continue to play
---
What fallout game have you played that gave you all the ammo you needed for free?
---
You need advice for getting ammo?
---
Since Fallout 3 I didnt want anything else then a coop mode. Fallout isn‚Äôt my most favourite franchise, I play a lot of stuff in my 35 years of life and 20 years of gaming. But I like Fallout as a lot of folks around here.
---
And while Skyrim together still isn‚Äôt working that well and will take a lot of time, Fallout 76 is what we get when we want a coop Fallout. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, that‚Äôs why I like the private world with friends and that‚Äôs why I spent money from time to time if there is something useful in the shop (not the cosmetic bullshit no-one needs).
---
What make you think make me stop coming to reddit 5 months ago in the first place? I recommened him to comes here and I have proof. Will upload it later since I'm at work and this phone can't catch screenshot.
---
I like the world better than fallout 3 and 4 I think if they ever got their heads out of asses it could be great. I like the world, I like my character. I enjoyed what little story they had. I stick around cause I have hope for better stuff in the future.
---
You can say that again. I hadn't seen this type of thing pulled before so i originally suspected nothing. I even put it on another subreddit. Then someone pointed out what had happened.
---
I‚Äôd say bring on all the macrotransations , it‚Äôs the players themselves asking for more . Bethesda were right !!!!  
---
What has my favourite hobby turned into ?
---
Makes sense to me. I understand why this upsets people but private worlds have less players in them then public worlds therefore they can build more without the game crashing or struggling to keep up. And severs cost money and bethsaeda gotta make money so yea.
---
And I'll be waiting for proof. If i see it and i can't find anything disproving it then I'll admit I'm wrong. But until then I'm sticking with this.
---
I haven't quit playing, but I play very rarely now. Would play more if the game was stable. Would also buy FO1st if the scrap box and tent were available to everyone. Would even be fine with the tent behind a quest with skins for it in the Atom Shop since, as of my posting this, everyone's tents look exactly the same.
---
Agreed. In the beginning the devs didn‚Äôt have a way for a player‚Äôs stash to go over a certain amount due to server stability. As the game evolved the devs found a way for players to have unlimited scrap. That should never have been put behind a paywall. As the game improves all players should be given access to those improvements. Unlimited scrap isn‚Äôt a utility, cosmetic, or additional item. It is a literal game improvement that didn‚Äôt exist before and should absolutely not be withheld from any player who paid for this game
---
Ribs and PvP are a winning combo.
---
In some cases yes but I think it's good to have both especially if you're charging 60 bucks.
---
I do it for the human element. But to be honest after today im having a really hard time defending Bethesda. Ive stuck to my guns through arguments and being roasted by my friends on this game. Now im not going to quit the game but i cant defend it anymore.
---
When I first started it was because I wanted more Fallout without replaying one of the other games for the dozenth time. Now I play because I‚Äôve made some good friends through them game, I enjoy the story, the events are fun, and I just overall enjoy the experience. Now mind you I didn‚Äôt interact with another player until after level 70 and I really enjoyed that solitude, but the social aspect has really completed the experience for me.
---
Baa!
---
It is a fun game and entertaining story, but at 59 it is kind of short and shallow.
---
Fine. I fire storage in my scrap box. I like that. Increase my building limit. And budget. Hell I like it more as a first member. Bring it on!
---
When you've put it that way, they've been VERY human over this past year, haven't they?

Why does anyone play a game?  Because it‚Äôs entertaining.  Much of the ‚Äúscummy stuff,‚Äù as you put it, is deemed so by a fantasy narrative.  For instance, let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm enjoying the game this week.  Next week they come out with a $50 item that is super cool in the atom shop.  I would imagine this is something you might see in a negative light.  But I enjoyed the game and everything it had to offer this week.  Nothing was taken away from my game.  Without spending a dime I can see the cosmetic in other people‚Äôs camps.  The fantasy narrative is driven by this idea that now you are in a world where you are without;  where the key to your entertainment is now locked behind a $50 paywall.  It is not a paywall, it is a $50 add on.  So those that play enjoy the game they have.  They enjoy the things they are doing in it, and they may find a personal value on things to come which are free or otherwise.  If you are truly trying to get behind the psyche of those that enjoy this game, as I imagine you are in addressing you with sincerity, then you have to understand that most of the players who truly enjoy this game are naturally people who see the glass half full.  They appreciate what they have and I would venture to say are not very entitled in general.  I think you can dislike the game and be all of those things too.  But the opposite is likely not true.  I can‚Äôt see someone who is a ‚Äúglass half empty,‚Äù entitled, rarely satisfied person enjoying the game.  That is not knocking those that play it or those that don‚Äôt.  Many play and have concerns or misgivings too, so the player base runs the gamut.  But if you wanted an honest answer that‚Äôs about it.

The truth is, game was rigged from the start
---
Goddammit Bethesda
---
I do..over powered bloodied build..the non legendary fixer brings back a small challenge..i mean still sneak commando can almost 1 shot most things..but a bloodied ffr handmade as my main..its not even fun anymore. but for runnin westek or whatever..ill bring the lvl50 reggy fixer. Saves on 556 too lol
---
Nah
---
\[x\]Doubt
---
Lol
---
Oh here we go. Digital items take no time and skill to make...
---
Sure buddy...
---
I still love it but I do wish I had gotten it on sale.
---
The junk pile was rigged? Oh shi-
---
He‚Äôs end of his wits about scrap. He doesn‚Äôt want to slave for scrap anymore. Not will go get one of those protestors signs and be protesting around your camp. Waving a gun and shooting up the place
---
20% of a userbase choosing to opt into a completely optional paid subscription is actually incredibly good. 
---
Look at standard conversions of a free app to a paid version, this is 100% not necessary to play and only adds quality of life and locked in Atom purchasing. 
---
I'm this industry 20% is actually quite good and if they're getting at least that amount from the overall playerbase that's huge numbers. 
---
I don't know how you are basing your assessment that 20% isn't good.
---
If you don't like the game please leave! By! Can i have your gear!;:::):):))))
---
All I'm seeing is pictures. But that may just be me making an account to see it and not knowing anything about facebook. And although i do apologize for jumping to conclusions on things i still don't see definitive proof.
---
This happened to me over the weekend and it's working fine for me now.  I honestly just left the game alone for most of the day then came back to it working fine.
---
&gt;why do you think that people who dont play the game are still trolling this subreddit
---
I'll tell you why I think that...a simple look at some of the profiles is very telling...many are very active posters...only not on FO76. Many have their first entry within a couple days of FO1st being announced. That's not my opinion,  that is something very easy to see for yourself.  That, of course,  does not mean all are trolls, there are certainly people that play or played FO76 that were upset by the sub but a huge chunk, I'd go so far as the most virulent anti-Bethesda posts, were kids who never play or even visited the sub until they were whipped into a frenzy. Again, easy enough for people to check for themselves.  I, personally,  never even had a reddit account until FO76, mainly because I always played single player games prior and knew I'd need to connect with folks to get the most out of the game...
---
Well yeah. But we aremt back in the 90/early 00s so the business model has changed a lot. Servers require more power to function. Bigger playerbases etc. This plus games are a lot more expensive to produce and devs need paid, Diablo didnt release free updstes and content. It was set.
---
Sorry I haven‚Äôt been playing for a year- I joined during the free weekend and been having a blast since!
---
Because it‚Äôs fun
---
This here folk is a proof that most of these astroturfers are completely clueless.
---
ESO is nothing like fo76 core issues?
---
Laugh.My.Fucking.Ass.Off.
---
ESO was so dysfunctional at lunch (and continued to be so for a few years) it almost got canned off the air.
---
Of that 20 only16% plan on staying. 2% did a year. Odds are after everyone has their ranger outfits and no new content comes out this #will hit 5% in 1-2 months. Its neat for some buys because of all the perks. Perks become mundane if nothing new happens. Now wastelanders will change this, but still, no, 20% is not good. 35%, sure, but 20 is bad.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôve offended you all. I‚Äôm new to Reddit. I wasn‚Äôt aware of the rudeness of asking Bethesda to honor my daughter. ( not sarcasm) The game came out before she was born and I just thought it would be nice if they did something like that. They did it before with Fallout 4 Nuka World DLC.
---
Yes- the bot wants no one to get together and acts on That
---
Same kind of. I have a jeep to go on dirt trails and the gear with some guns to go out further into the desert. Due to financial reasons I'm not running off into the desert like I used to. I sure loved being able to go out and explore the desert.
---
Yeh I never got on the bloodied op bulids I tried beserker but the buff wasn't worth the effort. Sneaky commando is fun enough for a casual gamer like me
---
Those robots were unforgiving during the event lol. Revenge before they take over will make them finally getting me worth it.
---
I have a lot of fun with this game. I meet people all the time via area chat. They‚Äôre 90% non hostile and usually really really fun and helpful. 
---
I play this game like a post apocalyptic Second Life. I don‚Äôt care about grinding. Yeah, I like to kill my PVE enemies but I don‚Äôt need to be some OP one shot god build guy. 
---
This game is fun for me and that‚Äôs ally hat matters (to me) at the end of the day.
---
I‚Äôm new to Reddit, I did this because my Facebook group suggested it after I sent a letter and a few emails to Bethesda. If Bethesda wants proof I‚Äôll give it to them. I was unaware of how some people might try to scam people with this sort of thing. I‚Äôm sorry if I angered a lot of people
---
The Ranger armour says CPD on it. Also yeah. The gladiator outift isn't a Legion outift
---
op's original pop'al
---
My name is Elijah Barbera, I‚Äôm a huge fan of your games including your most recent one, Fallout 76. However I have a sad story to tell. When the game first came out my wife and I were pregnant with our first child, a daughter that we named Aurorabelle. Our daughter was later diagnosed with several congenital heart defects. I wanted to create my character for her so I named my character after her. Soon after she was born she was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome. Unfortunately, our daughter died a month after she was born due to her complicated heart defects. It‚Äôs been very hard to come back to the game since then. I was wondering if you could do something for my family. 
---
What I‚Äôm trying to ask is, is there someway my daughter could be honored in your game? I‚Äôve heard stories of developers adding things to their games, like Spider-Man including a marriage proposal for a fan. Perhaps you could add a grave with her name on it in the preexisting graveyard in the game, perhaps with some flowers or a teddy bear on it. I understand if this is too much to ask but my family would greatly appreciate it. It would mean the world to me and would make coming back to Fallout 76 easier for me, seeing as my character reminds me of my daughter.
---
Sincerely,
---
A grieving fan.
---
Well it‚Äôs gone now. And final note this isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôd want to honor your passed daughter anyways, unless you paid for it
---
I enjoy the game. I've put hundreds of hours in and more than gotten the entertainment I wanted out of it. I certainly want to see it improved, and I'm certainly disappointed with many things...but I still have found plenty of relaxing fun jumping on and playing.
---
I honestly expected NW to be hot garbage, it isn't. It's a fun twist on the saturated BR genre, with my absolute favorite game universe of all time as the focus.
---
They could certainly be doing better than they are right now, but in my opinion given the vast amount of updates and improvements we've seen over the year they are still trying (even if some of the decisions, like a subscription model to replace the most anticipated free DLC of the year, are astonishingly poor).
---
Most of the times I've hopped on Nuclear Winter I've played on average for 3-6 hours at a time, enjoyed 90% of the games, and maybe ran into one blatant cheater. Lately it's been SUBSTANTIALLY worse. So I'm here to complain about it with everyone else.
---
I will, for sure, stop playing Nuclear Winter for now. But that doesn't mean I/we shouldn't still voice our concerns. Fallout is my favorite game series. I'd love FO76 to reach a point like ESO someday.
---
"Fallout 76 bad. Give me upvote."
---
I think it'd be awesome to have something like that. I ran around with my friend as the BoS for a good while when the game launched, but once he stopped playing I kinda just wandered around as a field scribe until eventually, I stopped wearing the gear.
---
That being said, I've still been on the lookout for others doing BoS stuff. I love roleplay, although it seems like a lot of people do very very light RP on Fallout 76. I'm probably a bigger RP nerd than you'd be looking for.
---
NP! I totally always screw up the locations of the pipes, so I hack and pick.
---
The AI doesn't have fun playing too. If you're not into RPG, Fallout is not for you. Or be a bit logic, use less to none ammo (melee) and farm from the AI.
---
Had never heard of this person before the 1st thing appeared, yet they mysteriously also seemed to pop up at the same time. And somehow people are believing everything they say. 
---
Looks like before they started with this, they were doing Anthem till the start of May, with the end of October being the first time they've done anything since, probably just to get some attention cause of this crap going on
---
I voted keep but my plan is to keep the subscription only up to the wastelander dlc. I need to build up my resources before it lands so the private world is great for that. Then I'm going to play the wastelander dlc on my own private world so I can go at my own pace with no interruptions but more importantly I wont be screwing up anyone else's game. If the dlc is really good then I may keep subscribing, but if it bombs and has all the bugs/glitches and problems of earlier updates then I am finally done with it and will be uninstalling.
---
Got the game 4 months after release for 1/4 of the price, it has kept me entertained for 6 months or more by now, feel like I've gotten max value for my money.
---
Always been a huge fallout fan, so I just had to try it for myself
---
now wastelanders is going to be released 2021
---
I like to run several in my hot bar. I would use the Tesla for tagging mobs or killing trash mobs. Aa25 for sniping weaker mobs. Furious handmade for higher health targets as furious will get a chance to work longer+the limb damage is good for crippling things if you dont run tormentor perk
---
The problem with that line of thinking is that it's short sighted in the long run. Let's say that fallout online costed 400 dollars a month. Would that be a problem with you? Can you fork it out that easily? That's how the newer generation is handling it. That's where the line stands. The cost to play is no longer about being a part of a community or enjoying lore but it's boiled down to pay to play better with skins on everything to make it seem like you're not playing a mobile game. So what's short sighted? The game lore. It's beautifully rich in potential and content but it's being sold out for cheap and being thrown away effectively since the community can't mod it. 
---
So if you enjoy it, cool. I do too. But I am worried that I won't be able to in the future. So should you.
---
I always hopped over to the white springs station after and people would sell the outfits to the vendor! i got a imposter sheepsquatch outfit, fireman outfit, and whitesprings jumpsuit for very few caps.
---
Could be added to Eagle Eyes imo.
---
what are you doing in your camp that you need curtains?
---
Cancelling on the first month. I don't care enough to flip this pancake to pay for another.
---
The funny thing is that subscribers who thought it should be free was called "entitled" and other degrading words yesterday
---
I havent found any games that engage me quite like this. The enviornment, grind, and lore are right up my ally.
---
Thank you for the useful advice! :)
---
Sheepsquash spawn rates went up on random event locations
---
As long as you left after TSE was nerfed to the ground, nothing has changed except they made energy weapons slightly better
---
Thanks!
---
Nice.
---
Let me guess, you love the game and never complain about it. I really hate this attitude that people who don't share your opinions are trolls/bots/people who never played the game. I'm more inclined to think that the Bethesda bootlickers like you are the fakes that don't even play the game.
---
I'd go for some sort of metal paneling, to match the metal walls.
---
I love wallpaper, I used to build just with brick all the time, because it was the only material that wasn't just bare studs on the inside. Outside of the house looks nice, inside like crap. But wallpaper allows us to hide those bare studs and make it look like the walls could actually be insulated.
---
So yeah. Metal paneling. Or even variations of the existing wallpapers, so you could have that blood stain or tear on just select walls, instead of every wall.
---
&gt;ult though? Bethesda cou

'man' LMAO

Their agenda is to make money. Like any other company.

Why not do him a solid and let em know that you could hear everything going on? I know he should know to turn off the mic himself, but sometimes people get so caught up in an argument that they forget.
---
I plan on keeping it. I paid around the same for WOW and I enjoy fallout 76 more then I every enjoyed wow. I am totally ok with supporting in finically while having a blast playing it. 
---
I really hope they increase the slots on the private servers- quite often all my friends can not fit in together at the same time.

You poor summer child

---
For what my child?
---
HA! THATS WHAT YOU GET!
---
 You did nothing wrong.
---
Its just a joke, I was implying they want to have his subscription as long as possible jeez.
---
If you take over a workshop, you have to keep up with pvp people and learn when to give up a fight if it's too much.
---
I'm hoping they meant 2020 cause that's when it's actually being released. That or it was a joke
---
Yeah I miss the OG survival. Back when I could one shot shitty food builds in excavator instead of having to use 3 or 4 of my precious 556. Back when killing a level 200 with my level 50 meant I was gaining 400 caps at a time and only risking 100, or better yet only risking 5 caps by getting a bounty. Back when people would drop nearly all of their aid and I could just get 3 kills and have to hop to adventure because I'm overweight with chems. Good times
---
FT puts you close to the C.A.M.P. in my current base, just North of the Top of the world and the lake with train tracks over it, FT always dumped me into the lake because my C.A.M.P. was always in the back of the base. Now that I have moved it to the very edge of the circle, middle of the highway, my FT spot puts me also on the highway.
---
Though if you are crunching away on doritos or something man, fuck you.
---
The guy who bought the Fallout1st domain name hadn't played in 8 months...
---
You almost killed me with a heart attack. Next time you make a joke like that bring a AED please
---
&gt;I really hate this attitude that people who don't share your opinions are trolls/bots/people who never played the game
---
Dewd, I stated that looking at profiles can tell you a lot, I never once said anything remotely like "if you dont share my opinion, you're a troll". No, you're a troll if you've never played the game and never had a post in the sub ...until there is controversy. It's simple and easy to see, go look at people's profiles.  Its very enlightening
---
I only grab workshops if there is an Atom challenge.  I also make sure there is area I can hunker down for the 15 seconds and avoid being sniped .  As soon as I claim the workshop, I immediately log off and  join a new world so I don‚Äôt run into poachers.  I get why they do it, not complaining, it‚Äôs just my way of avoiding them.
---
Cripple is not stagger
---
Oh, I know. But Lausee's business sounded so preachy, I just had to go there.
---
I totally agree with you dude, I haven‚Äôt got the game yet and I joined this sub just to get more of an idea of it and it‚Äôs sad that all people want to do is complain now a days. I‚Äôm still going to get it because I‚Äôve watched a ton of gameplay on it and it still appeals to me (mainly cause I like fallout lore) but also berthesda make buggy games that‚Äôs just them ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Well don't worry it's the not Bethesda shills that have more votes
---
It would be nice if we could just get the wastelanders update that should've come from launch. Not rely on players to make the experience better. But I like being there for those who have come to me for their real world problems.  I guess that's something that people would like though, to have unscripted real conversation. And I'm here for just that.
---
Oh look, they made it free. Guess it wasn't as simple, eh troglodyte?
---
I came back to the game after borderlands 3 disappointed me and it really scratches that looter shooter itch and I love how deep the weapon and armor customisation systems are.
---
Exactly the other way around lmao. The description for eso+ says it includes dlc.  1st does not. Wait I‚Äôm pretty sure I just said that...can‚Äôt really comprehend, can you?
---
Never had any issues with event even with tons of people around. Actually was a really easy way to farm rare cosmetics because it popped up about as much as meat week events.
---
Have you seen the damage difference between shooting her in the air vs ground? Her damage resistance is ridiculous in the air. You could just as well throw pebbles
---
Could have plied my "I read like half a psych 101 textbook 15 years ago" wisdom to offer them free fallout centric relationship counseling, I guess.
---
I already said what I see when I look through profiles, complaining from 5 year old accounts and "I launched my first nuke today Bethesda is awesome!" from 3 day old accounts. You tell me who you think is real and who is damage control.
---
It‚Äôs an alright post to make, but the subreddit is a fraction of the player base which seems to hold a few easily upset people in this group so it‚Äôs also a fair call out. The majority of players making the difference are contacting Bethesda Support directly for Fallout 76 and not posting about it here. I suppose you could call a portion of the Fallout 76 subreddit, ‚ÄúSlactivists‚Äù as a result of the consistent upset.
---
Recently there's definitely been an influx of people that don't even have the game visiting this subreddit just cause of 1st. Even this person's last poll had a bunch of people saying they hadn't even played the game but had voted
---
My headset mutes when you flip up the mic, though I didn't even have it plugged in as I was watching tv.
---
That man is a hero
---
The projection and irony of this post...
---
Try out the filthycausuals sub. They have an explicit rule about negativity. You'll be safe there.
---
I think some people just had high hopes over the game and need to look past the negatives of the game (bar the stuff that actually matter like not being able to physically play it) but still just enjoy the game for the free to do what you want and the lore! Plus customisation is always fun!
---
Using a tse that misses every shot and not having any tank perk cards on is why you lost. You didnt need a laser back then and you dont need one now. I used to dominate survival servers with a one star level 35 semi auto bloody handmade, and a bunch of shitty unyielding armour with 1 chameleon piece on.
---
Of course there were always 1 or 2 guys with full assassin sentinel armour and legacy weps but most of the people that had those were pretty shit at the game and just relied on the armour too much anyways
---
Nuclear Winter.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBPrSO0w7As](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBPrSO0w7As)  around 15minutes for me, when TSE was imba. (Golden times of all day SBQ farming)
---
Now i don't feel like wasting ammo you have to grind and lol, how the hell you want melee all those turrets and bots?
---
They really ruined melee huh. I forgot how great that used to be when a bloodied power fist with 40 strength  did more damage than a 10mm pistol
---
I would have if my mic was plugged in.  Too weary to get up and plug it in.  :(
---
I hate unrealistic bullet sponge enemies

Hope you had fun though!

That's because he posted it in the main fallout subreddit. Those people hate 76

I was really hoping he was browsing reddit before the drop, so he might see it.  I didn't have a mic.  Didn't expect so many people to jump on here, probably was a little rude of me.

NoT tRyInG tO bE aN aSsHoLe
---
People seem to have gone into the game expecting a fully fledged fallout game even though it is supposed to be an mmo set in the fallout universe
---
You might also notice that I never once gave my opinion of the game in my comment,   yet I'm a bootlicker. Eh?  I  only that it's very easy to verify that a huge number of post that were done around the announcement of 1st were from people that never posted in the sub and yet were very active on other game subs.  No need for you to get defensive and hostile especially when it's easily verifiable what I stated. Chill, it's a game, not a life choice
---
The Brewing Station has a sink. I use it for my kitchen
---
Stop shooting her.
---
Oh :( I used a bloodied MG if that makes it any more believable. I just wanted to share a proud moment of mine, I guess if you guys dont believe it and downvote me I at least can still be proud of myself lol
---
Already cancelled and received my refund... :)
---
Of course, I understand that. But I know I've also seen some that haven't commented or posted anything related to Fallout before coming here. Some that haven't even used Reddit for months.
---
Hey buddy, if they fucker you over not delivering with Fallout 1st, you can contest it on your credit card since they didn't deliver. Your credit card company will usually have your back.
---
I bet this is a fairly good indicator of how people are subbed.  I have a feeling a ton of people who are subbed just subbed for a month to either get the caps for something (as I did), or just try it out, and won't resub.
---
Half of the time you get unlimited ap because server is having trouble processing everything. So you can just abuse concentrated fire and crit her in the face nonstop with a heavy weapon.  With stabilized, her resistances are always reasonably low.  Problem is vats consumes fusion cores.  I just wish that would be fixed.
---
If I'm killing her too fast, I'll just stop firing.  Killing the queen isn't really the objective in that event.  She will die, that much is certain.  But more often than not, you'll be getting better loot from the five other legendaries that spawn if you let the event go for a while.
---
What? This doesnt effect the server like that. Your game still has to render the same exact shit as before and the camp size stays the same
---
Gotcha, I just try to let people know so that they don't dishonor themselves anymore than they have to. When you let a private outburst like that be public, you're essentially inviting people into your private life to mock or to form opinions on it.
---
Don‚Äôt shoot her when she is in the air
---
People went into the game expecting at least a functioning game with content.
---
Remember when they advertised "no npcs" as a decision? Seems they were just too lazy to work on it before release, and they'll add it down the line.
---
The reason the game gets so much flak is warranted. The reason so many youtubers comment on it is because it's true. 
---
The reason we should complain is so they dont try this shit with their next games. I couldnt care about the idiots still paying for this trash. I could care however about them using the exact same methods in ES6.
---
Filthy casuals is a very positive subreddit
---
Easily verifiable is taking a look at my post history and the people I've called out for praising fallout on 3 day old accounts and all the comments of praise being similar brand new accounts. This isn't a new issue.
---
According to Australian law you can receive a refund in any account you want. The whole "we can only put it into the card you used to buy" that is widely used by many stores is incorrect.
---
It's almost as if you can make a decision on a game from all the credible sources reporting on all the fuck ups. Do you know how stupid you sound? It's like saying you dont believe Nazi's are bad because people never lived through it, so have no right to complain.
---
Also, I bought the game and played it at launch. Before you try to make out I've never played it.
---
I sell serums.  Chameleon has literally no downside.  I can't keep them in stock.  Weightless armor is easy enough to come by and with the right 2nd and 3rd stars can be ridiculous for sneaking or not.  250 caps for a serum, absolutely no reason not to have that mutation.
---
Fair criticism about the game = toxic
---
Um, I replied to your comment that said that there were not people trolling the sub that didn't play the game. Again, simply not true, its very easy to see that there are a ton of comments from people that don't.  Simply admit you were wrong, quit trying to change the subject, apologize for making assumptions about my opinion of the game and move on. In other words, man up. I somehow doubt that's going to happen though...
---
The reason there are no NPCS is because it makes sense in the story....the whole point is that the survivors of Appalachia all eventually got wiped out and the inhabitants of vault 76 have been released to repopulate the wasteland. NPCS wouldn‚Äôt make sense.
---
Use a Cryolator maybe
---
Good to know, thanks for the heads up!
---
That's a very convenient excuse for them to use.
---
Excuse or perfectly reasonable storytelling method? Why does the game NEED any NPCS
---
Possibly because fallout was known for its great interactions with its NPC's, before they started to water down the game features.
---
Also you make a good point, why does the game need NPCs now, when they clearly decided the game didn't need them?
---
Dem da rules
---
Yeah, but freezing and burning were both effects in FO4.  The Perfect Storm is the only burning ballistic gun in the game as far as I know; and yeah Cryolators are in 76 but it was also in FO4.  I just want a freezing gun that will work against the queen.  I sort of think 'Suppresors' is the replacement.
---
We need better turrets in general. What we have is shit for for the level 68+ enemies that attack camps anywhere out east.
---
So a guass turret, sure. i dont care if they need lots of power either. I got my fusion generator.
---
Also, the turret AI needs to be fucking overhauled cus it sucks balls. Yeah yeah, use a spotlight... doesnt do shit for me.
---
Ever try explosive bait?
---
He prolly too drunk to count caps.
---
I feel like it‚Äôs scrambled eggs on the ideas of what they‚Äôre using, they look like legacy weapons now.. My head hurts.

Well great now you gave them the idea. üòÇ
---
I had a similar experience. Was fighting in the C-berry bog against some legendary super mutants, I‚Äôve got my trusty-rusty super sledge out and I‚Äôm whomping and whooping when a scorch beast flaps its raggedy old ass in and was like, ‚Äúyo, me too!‚Äù So we‚Äôre fighting, we all got our dukes way up, it‚Äôs like a damn family picnic when the Doritos run out. Well, I chance a sultry look to my left and there‚Äôs a Mr. Handy with some Brahm√≠n. Old farmer Handjob says to me something like, ‚Äúbest be careful, these roads aren‚Äôt as safe as they used to be. Seemed awful strange since we were in a soggy trench and not on a road, but whatevs. I‚Äôm about to put a hurt on some of some of the scorch beasts cronies when I hear a scream like Machoman Randy Savage screaming into a drain pipe after getting his nuts caught in a rat trap. You guessed right: Sheepsquatch. He‚Äôs throwing barbs, the mutants are stuck in a trench with some mirelurks that felt left out, and the scorched are their flying rat are mad as ever. Long story long, it was a hell of a hoedown... fun time though.
---
I sincerely hope I haven‚Äôt, or at least haven‚Äôt encouraged any budding plans for them to do so üòÇ
---
Elemental legendary effects are in the data files, some think they'll be added as 4 or 5 star weapons
---
Big oof. That's not what I said, you should read it again before trying to demand an apology.
---
clap..
---
Weekly weapons make a return as rewards for NW after Wastelanders drops
---
I think I hate these kinds of post most of all. Dude just play and find out for yourself. Only your opinion matters.
---
I know, I actually do keep from shooting her but all the other people won‚Äôt stop. They don‚Äôt listen if I try and tell them either so I just sit on top of my tent and heal every few minutes while I wait.

You can‚Äôt see me in a single player only game.
---
How do you find these couriers on xbox?
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs percentage based.
---
Literally cropping a perk card 90% of the time.

&gt;:^(
---
&gt;why do you think that people who dont play the game are still trolling this subreddit after nearly a YEAR? maybe on the first month that was true but you are in serious denial if you think the outrage is from people who dont even play this game.
---
That was your entire post, so yeah, it is what you said. Feel free to leave the apology in DM if it's too embarrassing.  I'm heading to be now, but I'll be happy to take this up in the morning with you.  Cheers!
---
I am also getting this ‚Äúbug‚Äù.
---
F(Freezing)I(Instaging)E(Explosive) vats crit lever action?  Sign me up(with atoms).
---
World of Warcraft has way more than enough content to justify a monthly subscription. It also has a far bigger playerbase to have to maintain than Bethesda. Not to mention any WoW bugs get patched quickly, unlike Bethesda who still have bugs from fallout 4 in their game.
---
Also fo76 has been running microtransactions since day 1, the takings from that should have been used to fix the game, which clearly they didn't with how the state of the game is.
---
Yes, I have it, send me (may be on PM) some list/album/spreadsheet what can you offer for trades.
---
I think it was delayed so they could rush out another monetization method.
---
Why would they work on a mode for existing players with very few microtransactions, when they could delay it and add a sub for that extra cash.
---
Bethesda have shown they only care about money. Remember they joked about it not having a battle royale mode? Then realised they could draw new players in with one, then all of a sudden it's not a joke no more, praise Bethesda.
---
Checking your post history shows that you commented in the same post about Bethesda shills I have been referring to, so why don't you stop acting coy as if you don't know this is a problem. Oh wait. You're one of them.
---
I encourage everyone to look at this guy's post history if you want a good example of a Bethesda shill.
---
How else did they mess it up?
---
OOORRRR you could get Fallout 1st with some other bugs included, so that you forget about day 1 bugs
---
Could you kindly post this to r/fallout and see what reaction you get.
---
That sounds like a discount to me ;D
---
Could you also be getting stream sniped? We've had that happen a few times to my team (I'm not a streamer but I play with one).
---
Absolutely. If people are stupid enough to pay for it, you cant blame Bethesda. Though you can blame the people who pay for it if the monetization bleeds into future titles.
---
And the best thing is people saying that the atoms you get justify the price. Atoms cost nothing to make, they could sell them cheaper but they know they have plenty of sheep to fleece.
---
He's a shill, ignore him.
---
The guy clearly hasn't actually read the definition of P2W, and is spouting the scripted lines of the shills.
---
no bro, there are always survivos, whether it's vaults or refugees from other places, npc are necessary to make fallout fallout, making those decisions about whether which person to help, factions, more storyline, lore etc
---
bro üòéüí™
---
How about turning on push to talk.
---
I have it in my kitchen
---
I give this thread about an hour until the mods notice it and delete it just like all the other NW hacker complaint threads. Fo76 mods use excuses like "no witch hunting" to remove threads like this one constantly.. Which ironically leads to more people posting similar threads because they can't see the dozens of previous ones that got deleted after a couple hours. Im surprised this one made it 3 hours but it's 3am est so mods must be sleeping.
---
Perfect example of the sheep Bethesda are out to fleece. 
---
"I just buy any crap Bethesda throws out."
---
The same dumbshit losers who buy fallout first.
---
Cause they made the best fallout game fallout 76 and started this fucking franchise that bethesda is running into the ground with their greed and ancient creation engine.
---
If it freezes, probably it is Imploding lmao.
---
keep shooting and gain perfect aim
---
**Bug**: opening the Pip-boy while sprinting will lock out most controls, again. This hasn't happened to me since they supposedly fixed the issue months ago. I couldn't move or look around, only access the map and take a photomode picture. [https://youtu.be/onAyXKd165w](https://youtu.be/onAyXKd165w)
---
bro
---
Yup, awaiting the usual shills to appear.
---
Jet, quantum x01, t60 power armor, brotherhood of steels origins... just to name a few
---
Got him.
---
5000 is a massive sample size.
---
Seems your mighty lords Bethesda disagree with you as they changed it.
---
It's the players fault. They started by going back on the cosmetic only promise, trying to see how far they could push it.
---
If you continued to support the game after that debacle, you cant complain now. You made your bed, lie in it.
---
I bought the year with no regrets thus far.
---
No, your not crazy. This is astroturfing. You want proof that Bethesda can do something like this? Watch your bethesda show or whatever it was called a few months back. They had people paid to woo in the audience and cheer for crap no one would cheer for.
---
Can you please calm the fuck down with the negativity? Nobody cares that you quit borderlands 3.
---
Yes, some of them are extremely good. The ones I would hate to be without are Perk Load out Manager and Better Inventory.
---
Plan to keep it till Wastelander drops and see how things will be.
---
i had a russian guy who once went apeshit because i dared to buy all 3 of his hunters longcoats at once
---
under certain circumstances it can disable some primary legendaries of the gun, mostly those that modify the stats of your target (anti-armor is an example)
---
bloodied etc are fine though iirc
---
Wow, this comment is ironic.
---
&gt; It will be the most complex game they have ever made!
---
Daggerfall, also known as Buggerfall happened decades ago, you know. Every next TES did nothing but simplifing, downsizing and dumbing down themselves since then.
---
It was Bethesda's magnum opus. Even when it came to bugs. The kind that forced players to edit saves to fix their playthrough. Or even get out of the very first dungeon.
---
Whoosh
---
If you could just narrate every interaction I have in this game, that'd be great.
---
Whilst I waited for a legendary Scorchbeast to land and fought some scorched, I had to fight a Flatwood Monster and a Sheepsquatch. 
---
And yes. I have a video of that, mostly boring, fight.
---
Dunno about consoles, but on PC nobody serious fights with melee. Whenever I see someone wielding a hammer or claw or whatever silly melee, I think they're joking around. About 80% of pvpers I meet use explosive lasers and teslas; rest are heavies and oddballs like gauss rifles and plasma throwers.
---
My PSN is Cactasboy13 send me a friend request.
---
Bet you will in the future
---
Nah bro, what we are witnessing is them milking the remnants of the 76 fan base for everything they can get, before closing the game down - which they‚Äôll probably claim was by ‚Äúplayer request‚Äù
---
Which leads me to my next point, what happens to all these items that have been purchased for real world money when the servers switch off?
---
I do like that I can display things but using a display case for four food items as a representation as my pantry in my kitchen just looks silly.
---
I'd much rather have them use the metal shelving as a display so we could make stuff like a pantry or a workshop. Or have them pre-made so they don't take up a ton of space in the stash/budget...
---
I do not, but thank you.
---
I never figured out the issue, but I downloaded Cloudy's Mod Manager and using that to compile everything through that fixed whatever the issue was.
---
Amen! I freaking hate the new map...
---
Like I was saying you get a good score for hiding in a bush and getting 3rd.  I get a better score with 4-6 kills and a win.  Its worth learning to actually play.  Plus it is much more fun.
---
\*screams internally\*
---
Nice, I scored yesterday. One dude whose camp I traveled to had chucked a bunch of random outfits including the white springs jumpsuit.
---
I bought a year due to having a MS credit so it was like $41. 
---
My friend and I play a lot of the events  and that alone is worth it.
---
This
---
That kind of attitude is why there are betting limits at the casino
---
Its dead.
---
Completely agree with you
---
first off . if you did your a bellend and part of the problem as to why we keep getting treated like shit . keep it up .....
---
Well, i launched a nuke and tried to kill it. Only got it to approx 75% after it healed during the 30 mins of quest
---
Oh definitely more fun, it's just a question of time and effort for most people. If you haven't already honed your skills or, like me, suffer very much from VATS skills rot (I was never brilliant at battle royale, but I was decent enough), then it's just not possible to get good enough within a week to reach that 14000xp target. In that circumstance it is an intelligent choice to bush hide.
---
Also when you get good at bush hiding 300-400xp is pretty much a minimum. Top 5 gets you 500+, 2nd 650ish and 1st 1250xp. I reckon that on average I finished games in perhaps 6th or 7th by the second evening (400-450xp) and also won it 3 times (once without killing anything) and came second twice. More often than not when within the top 10 I would ultimately get killed by a npc such as a SB, encryptid or assaultron - all of these things are not impressed by bush hiding - I can imagine that the npcs are irritating to all players though.
---
Reaaaally like that rotating inventory idea, maybe the place will liven up with Wastelanders
---
why ? .... we all know it's broken and not worth it . stop feeding the beast please .
---
NW has a completely different set of rules, the weapons do different damages as an example. The Tesla rifle was OP and now its nerfed in NW.
---
How old are you? I play with all adult player faction and we run queens often
---
I dont disrespect you for for hiding for your rewards.  If that's your best way so be it.  Like I said though I'd be happy to play with you, or anyone to help them improve.
---
27
---
Its been around since day 1 of NW (people used the cheat to access the Dev room in Adventure mode for whatever its worth).
---
Now since they tied some lucrative rewards to NW, it made it more popular than usual. I noticed a huge influx of players that I assume dont normally play NW.
---
Now they get a taste what players have been putting up with since launch of NW.
---
Dm if you are interested in joining- we use Discord
---
Auto-correct fail?
---
What's even funnier is the majority of cheats on offer are based on a subscription.
---
Freezing Cryolater, rival of Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Gun for most useless legendary
---
Absolutely, these things could be great for NW/other pvp if there's first a grasp on infrastructure. There's still a massive fallout audience out here regardless of the current state of the game, bringing them back to a horrendously broken pvp experience just solidifies the lack of desire to touch it.
---
Getting the basics established, semblance of balance, stability, and anti-cheat means the fun game modes can be exactly that - fun. NW is fun. Despite things people might argue, balance, explosives, nukes, whatever...it's honestly a fun experience overall. But having zero anti-cheat whatsoever negates all that fun 100% for pc players.
---
And then charge them for it
---
You guys are missing the practical side of the argument. People that live in metal houses without insulation in winter will end up freezing to death. 
---
I wouldn't be offering just wallpaper I would be offering practical things like insulation. Having to deal with the cold might be a good element to add to the game in time for winter - also covering everything with snow would be nice (it never snows where I live...)
---
AAA title??? AAA pricing, yes. That's about it.
---
If I could make a living doing it, you can bet your ass I would.
---
No.... if you pay $100 you get 19,800 atoms as a first member... that‚Äôs about 50¬¢ per 100 atoms.
---
&gt; People went into the game expecting at least a functioning game with content.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Remember when they advertised "no npcs" as a decision?
---
You complain simultaneously that people went into the game expecting something other than what they got **and** that Bethesda told them what they were going to get.
---
Ok.
---
I truly love the fallout world! I love exploring it, and it seems a lot of the current fanbase is still here for the roleplay element. I will certainly agree the game is bad, but it is possible to make your own fun in it. Even when you literally have to make the fun yourself.
---
As for supporting Bethesda, I've got an uncommon opinion on them (at least one I dont see voiced much). I do not care about anything they do. I dont have any faith they're going to get better, so I dont think anything we do will matter. Buy 76 or dont. Buy a billion atoms and a 30 year membership, or buy nothing at all. I truly dont believe itll change anything. So I'll continue to have fun in their world, and whatever they do is their business. Their crap will rarely effect me personally. Like fallout first for example. Terrible thing, hate it. But it has not effected any of my experience with the game (aside from maybe some cheaper junk from players). So yeah, screw Bethesda but they ain't gonna change so why bother?
---
When I spawn into my camp I wind up in some sub-water untƒìrworld that I either have to jump out of or eventually fall through the map and wind up pretty far from my camp.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that title was from the launch days and not new news. The whole free to play thing is what aged like milk..
---
How do you propose they integrate something into a space that has both 1st members and non 1st members in it, while cutting off all Wastelanders content from the non 1st members? Cause it ain't happening. 
---
I'm sure they know people will be even more pissed off about that than they are about 1st if they made it part of the subscription. Content like that is actually something they properly advertised as free
---
I personally hope not, I don‚Äôt want their attention distracted.
---
Getting Todd a new Tesla is a priority at the moment.
---
GTA 5 also has rampant cheating/modding and that is the most successful game of all time some developers just choose not to play the whack a mole of catching, banning, new cheat, catching, banning etc.
---
I hate this stance personally and think any intentional cheating should earn a ban.
---
It doesn't work like that. Reply doesn't allow me to add video files or gifs
---
Was there even a blog post about this update? The first I heard about it was when this post was 17 hours old, but I checked the official site a few times earlier in the day.
---
Itzcmiltzertime
---
I intentionally only mentioned things that have exsited in previous fallouts, no new assets required, wouldnt take long at all. Modders would have done these things week one
---
Represent!
---
FkingGarbage.
---
Put this in the Trashcan and BURN it already.
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like it, but seeing how things have been going recently... there will probably be some over priced atom shop stuff, recycle the Christmas stuff from last year perhaps? I‚Äôve just started Outer Worlds and won‚Äôt be getting back into 76 for some time.
---
Some people were asking for the ‚ÄúI will subscribe in the future‚Äù option in the two posts OP made. It is fair to say that some people will be waiting for the likes of wastelanders to drop before they sub. You‚Äôll probably see a peak for subscriptions about that time and then a sharp decline in the following months unless they bring out some new amazing content but I don‚Äôt see that happening either to be fair. The poll obviously doesn‚Äôt account for what will happen in the future it was taken in the present day, I don‚Äôt know why you would even mention that, unless OP has a DeLorean with a flux capacitor that we don‚Äôt know about lol
---
I really am enjoying outer worlds
---
Weird. Still haven't seen a server that wasn't full. And that's in some Oceania based server probably
---
So almost 20% of Fallout 76 players decided to subscribe. 
---
Yup. Bethesda won.
---
I bought one off a player vendor for 999 yesterday.  I have no issue hoarding them for now and waiting for the value to go back up.
---
Psn sarw442, join and travel to me.
---
So If I buy FU 1st for a month and increase my camp, it'll still stay bigger after that month?
---
Speaking of which,... I'll trade a combination of white springs jumpsuits, shorts and pants jack o'latern suits, jack o'latern, pumpkin stands, and pirate hat..... for a pirate outfit. 
---
Xbox: Zombietickler86
---
Will do. Thanks!
---
You didn't know? Dupers have them rare masks by the bushels. They are obtainable if you can suck dupers off
---
How any game company today releases a 'AAA' online title with zero anti-cheat is mind boggling.
---
I've commented on this topic for quite some time (NW cheating), and wholeheartedly agree with your comments. Personally I logged into F76 for 2 things- Survival and NW. Love Fallout; love the PvP even more so. 
---
The cheating in NW was bad before, but the Halloween specials brought... well... Halloween lol.
---
As a result of this mess, I don't feel motivated to play right now - and NW is a big part of that motivation.
---
I've played countless online PvP games in my time- the ones that fall are the ones that do not address cheaters (or balance decisions for a whole other topic).
---
The .45 pistols from FONV Honest Hearts DLC.
---
I have quit most "grindy" "farming" games . Too little time to keep up with rng. Played fo76 over 1100h . Not one usable drop. Mostly all i did was farming gear. Met a few dupers and they filled my pockets once i got to know them. Now i just jump on sometimes for an hour
---
I don‚Äôt think so, but there is an easy lineup to get you to wastelanders.  First, check in every Tuesday just to see if you are missing anything.  Otherwise, the outer worlds, then delve into death stranding, then Star Wars, civ 6, Christmas with family, take family to see Star Wars movie, check out the new cod MW somewhere in between because it is really good, dragonball z in January...and before you know it...wastelanders.  If you experience any major lag time try tropico 6 or check out persona 5 if you‚Äôve never tried the series.
---
If people feel the need to complain, then they should. If you want to see nothing but positive posts about Fallout 76, you'd have to make another subreddit dedicated to that specific purpose. The game is a mess and there's a lot of reasons to be negative. The fact that this subreddit gets 70%+ positive threads is a miracle in itself.
---
Brother! Sister!
---
Patched, you can only pacify small animals.
---
Totally different game. I enjoy it but the lack of customization and lack of open world really cripple it sometimes.
---
What are you talking about?
---
If you reply vial email you certainly can attach pics and vids to your outgoing email.
---
Bailey spoke the truth and that's why they hated him xD
---
First, learn what being taken advantage of really means.

You want no mtx? Go play most a single player games

Enough with the Cosmetic Only shit too... There's a reason that tweet Pete Hines replied to was deleted.
---
I've had the exact same thing in the same location. It was an epic battle to watch. In my case I ended up watching a low level 30 character get mulched in the process
---
Aaaand it's gone
---
Master your inventory, don't let it master you.
---
Ditto, and as a fat guy I really should be dressing up as Santa more often.

Owl_No is my username on psn

Oh? What kind of animal am I looking for? I can't get a Yao Guai or Deathclaw any longer then?
---
Obviously - I have too dry a sense of humour....
---
I have zero interest in the wallpaper though, particularly of the sorts that are available. The wood paneling one is the only vaguely acceptable one really....better if it was actually wood panelling though. Even that one makes a base feel like you're trapped in the 70s and/or a sauna

---
But why tho? Bethesda support has an option to attach pics and vids, why not just make them work and let me do that in the first place?
---
Why would you ever want to change your All Hallows Night camp setup?
---
I'm certain they'll do a Christmas event. I really want to see a Thanksgiving event as well. I just hope they start these events the week before the holiday. It would've been nice to have all the pumpkins in my camp before Halloween.
---
At least next October my camp will look great for Halloween.
---
He is not incorrect.
---
I miss playing with a keyboard and mouse - sooo much better than a controller
---
Yes. Only dogs, mole rats and things like that.
---
Well, lucky you, the main Bethesda team is probably making their next game, because y'know, they don't do most of the development for 76
---
Thank you very much! I appreciate both links!
---
You have to aim with a weapon to pacify and tame it(and only if you‚Äôre double their level or higher). You need to have space in your camps budget if you want to send it there and I‚Äôm not 100% sure on this but you might need animal friend/whisperer to be level 3 to tame them (probably wrong on this).
---
Dang so if you crouch you are constantly a tank, even if you aren't reloading?
---
*Obtainable if you don't wish to cheat.
---
Bummer.
---
If you check player vending you should still be able to snatch up the plans. Some of the stuff was pretty cool. Also, most players haven't changed thier camps yet.
---
Or he can keep paying for mtx just to spite the whiny cunts in all future titles.
---
Keeping it... it just works
---
I hope you don't do like I've seen some are planning to do and are going to buy it again next month and try refunding it again
---
Wastelanders being delayed is the best outcome for FO76. It shows they know if it is a turd they're going to lose players. I wish they had this mentality when 76 was released and delayed it a few months to finish the game. But we can't change the past.
---
Radicool irks on how many Rads you have, not your health.
---
I mean this is just my personal experience man, like this subreddit was made to discuss fallout76 and the original post to this was stating that it‚Äôs just a load of hate and whining which I understand it gets a bit long to deal with. But there is always going to be toxic people on the internet it‚Äôs the con to social media (along with many other things) I could be wrong though and he meant it in a funny way but eh life goes on
---
Xbox?
---
His issue is with Radicool, not Unyielding.
---
Do you still have C.A.M.P space ? i heard somewhere it takes up to 10% to get a animal in your camp
---
No sorry, ps4
---
I agree so far this was the best event they've had. It was a lot of fun. Faschnat was second because the masks were awesome.
---
I agree totally that a delay js better than releasing trash, but some smaaaall amount of new content within the next 5 months would be nice
---
You can just pick em up from a player vendor if they are duped enough. No one knows
---
Thanksgiving is pretty low key IMO and I'm in America lol.
---
Really it's just about the food and getting together with family if you're lucky enough to have one. Maybe watching the parade on TV...but past that there's not really much to the holiday. I can't really think of how they'd make an event out of it other then something like Meat Week. Gather ingredients and then cook it...
---
You mean small bullets, big bullets, and energy bullets isn't enough for all the guns?
---
Christ... People suck their dick over New Vegas... There was 3 or more TYPES of some calibers...
---
I'm enjoying TOW but God damn... That ammo thing is dumb...
---
... Thats one case of modifying files, which many people claim its not possible in consoles. You don't need a cfw to use cheats.
---
New content would be nice. I'm using this time to work through my back log of games. For me at least it's a good thing. I've spent too much time in Appalachia.
---
Did you know that this is a blessing too?  If you stay crouched, you will keep the +250 buff, even when not reloading.  So use this to your benefit.
---
The exclusive green Ranger armor is now a free item for subscribers.
---
Lol was referring moreso to weapon and armor customization. There are mods but it‚Äôs clunky and not as fleshed out
---
Radicool only gives max 5 str or +25 to carry weight.
---
If you check OP's numbers, you should see that radicool only plays a minuscule role here.
---
Completely agree with you. There is definitely a correlation with what you have in your inventory to what legendary enemies will drop.
---
That's weird.... Tamed a deathclaw 3 days ago.
---
Should probably make turrets functional first lol. I stood and watched my missile turret get mauled by a level 3 ghoul last night
---
Open a new ticket to get your answers to those questions .)
---
I‚Äôm not sure the difference then.  I have noticed that my guy gains even more carry weight if I take my character as low as possible health-wise. I‚Äôm talking about significantly below 19%.  No clue why that happens either.
---
I like exploring Appalachia. Imo it's the best fallout game, in terms of worldspace and environmental story telling. And opposite to most others, I like bug/glitches as long as they aren't gamebreaking. I find it amusing when the physics engine goes haywire.. It's a part of the Bethesda charm.
---
Maybe. But there's the matter that easily findable cheats are being sold. That's how it works. You want to sell something, you got to make it visible.
---
Doesn't make any sense to make a cheat and give to everyone.
---
The mods too... Ugh
---
Again... I really enjoy the game but dammit...
---
I have an explosive laser and you can easily get wrecked by a tesla, gamma gun, or literally any weapon at all if they catch you in VATs. Its not just legacies man. Not sure why you sound legit salty as hell.
---
They could work with the Parade idea and the gathering of food. We could gather corn and tatos hunt some delicious Scorched Beast (Being the only Bird like creature) have a meal. Then a parade through Grafton which would of course lure in a bunch of Grafton Monsters we'd have to take care of.
---
Though TBH it'd probably be something lame and unexciting.
---
They postponed wastelanders because it was suppose to release very close to outer worlds. So its better to release just the shitty fallout first subscribtion and take all the headlines in gaming news so outer worlds will be buried under it. I think it was intentional to release this piece of crap to stop outer worlds from making headlines in the news. Bethesda is jealous.
---
Attach a link to a youtube video
---
Just another example, my ps4 runs software from an external source and i'm not using a cfw.
---
It was very popular in its day until they nerfed legendary effects against other players. Went from 1 shotting people with lever actions, to capping damage at 110 and then it was all about commando, then out of no where they nerfed the legendary effects and I remember logging onto survival and doing 6 damage per shot to someone with my handmade. They never really fix anything. They should have just scaled all damage against other players down by a certain percent.
---
Nooooo! HeHe. I'll try and take a wee vid or some photos! It's looking good! Just need to stock the Vending machines and we're back in business!
---
I really want to continue it, but I just don't have the money for it. I know $12 isn't much, but I gotta pay for other things :(
---
I tried but there's no option to open a ticket to fix Bethesda support problems. That's why I came here
---
So you take over a PVP zone and are mad about PVP?
---
Also. Melee is garbage in PVP. You should learn to crouch.
---
I bet they will be thrown in to nuclear winter
---
3 days ago??? So we can do it again? Thank you for the info. I remember they made a patch a few months ago and we couldn't.
---
Thank you not only do my explosives get nerfed but I am flagged as a cheater. Yes it is I whom hit harder than a nuke on event areas. My landmine perimeter with orbital strike and quad fatman was worth every cap and perk point.
---
Go to filthy casuals
---
I dont think the problem is the negativity, atleast the way i feel about this fiasco is that i dont give a crap about fallout 1st i just want to enjoy a game and read info/discussions about it which i do on this subreddit... But its a bit tough to find good posts when 90% of this sub is getting spammed with the same thread, id much rather see a mega thread full with people hating on 1st so that its easier to navigate plus it gets the same point across regardless (maybe even more so if bethesda sees the amount of upvotes and comments)
---
Ok thanks I just sold a jackolantern long suit for 8.5k and I didn‚Äôt know if these were the same value
---
It's really very good, especially at the beginning but honestly it ends pretty quickly. It's great though. Can't wait to see what they do with a sequel.
---
Drinking and drugs too, don't forget that.
---
I guess Op was right finally when it actually became free, and didnt missed anything./
---
attacking the messenger, as per usual.  
---
Yeah I made a spell mistake , that was indeed so much more important than what OP was saying.
---
They need to do a bit of snow. We'll definitely have snow in real Appalachia by then.
---
For once, nice move Bethesda and thanks .  
---
I had opened a thread about it and had been downvoted to oblivion by the fanboys telling me how I was stupid to think 1st items should be free.. Here we go.
---
Yes. Is there a problem?
---
Really? I rarely see the tenderizer and when I see the plans they're like 5k. I have a tenderizer for 10k
---
Yea and the people that bought it will get a refund.
---
No it‚Äôs funny how fast they change their mind
---
I know the feeling. Going for the glowing skeleton costume was a nobrainer for me.....as I've already spent 10 months wearing the normal  one (I've never had matching armor...) so my interest is completely unrelated to Halloween. 
---
Sooo many times I've thought "I wish that this suit glowed..." and now it does. It is so worth two long evenings staring at the inside of a bush for sure. I may never play NW again though because it was a utterly boring experience otherwise.
---
Believe it or not, some hackers use hacks that actually expose player tags so they can see them from as far away as they want
---
Smart
---
Assuming meat week will not return (doubtful), give it a year and they will be worth a ton.
---
...or, if you are the kind of person who believes in people and thus thinks Bethesda speaks the truth, it was always meant to be free. They didn't change their minds about repair kits, scraps kits, refrigerators or scrap bots, so why would they change their minds now, unless it is true that it was always meant to be free?
---
Is this a rich person thing I'm too poor to understand?
---
There is a bar in whitespring with some of the choices. This would be a cool way to introduce the firecracker whiskey that was supposed to be in game, or the kegs. Biv rocks.
---
I think the issue with that weapon is that it is not legendary, and it weighs a lot so it uses a lot of stash space. It is still a unique weapon but since meat week isn't tied to any specific season or time in the year, the event could return at any time. I am just keeping mine for collector's sake...
---
"  Another issue is that during PvP, melee is apparently SUPER op and ranged (no matter the \*) is absolute garbage.  "    
---
This is just absolutely not the case man. They have to be up your butt in order to even hit you. A gun will drop someone way before a melee should.
---
Because it requires "forward thinking" when designing the networking and they cant be asked to spend the extra effort to do it correctly.
---
Belieaving what the client says is always a bad idea. Thankfully games such as CS:GO are designed very well limiting what kind of cheating is possible.
---
Yep it just was fun how fast they change their minds
---
It is higher than the ESO+ membership percentage, so for Bethesda it is a win. Might not be for you, but it is for them.
---
I‚Äôm sorry and I hope you recover quickly! I know that feeling of trying to respond and it‚Äôs even worse when their angry. FEEL BETTER! :)
---
Same here I have one hanging on the wall.
---
Yeah it's really the only issue anyone had with FO1st. There would be no controversy if they just gave it to everyone and they would massively improve the game for everyone too.
---
Sadly patched :(
---
Yep, but it‚Äôs just fun how fast they change their mind
---
...or, as I mentioned, they didn't.
---
They don‚Äôt, if someone write down 500 atoms there is no error, why you have to complain? :/
---
didn't call it a coincidence, didn't say anything negative, are you all right mate? always take leaks with a grain of salt. Even a broken clock is right twice a day
---
I didn't know that, thank you for the knowledge kind stranger. I think they could give Biv's bar a quest line where you grab a bunch of different booze and then you unlock him as a rotating item vendor.  I mean this seems reasonable and easy to do. But I'm just a gamer not a dev.
---
what does better inventory do ?
---
Sometimes people do snipe to claim. But every time I've set up workshops I have a 90% chance of people not sniping me and helping on "defend" radiant quests. 
---
Used to lock all resources. Now I leave one or two free if I workshop claim as a "thank you"
---
400 points just completed for you? 
---
I know it's annoying but you don't have to exaggerate to make your point
---
I've heard people can get banned for even having them. Especially the dev room items. So if another player sells or drops an item that you can't get legitimately, I don't want to risk it.
---
I beat in 10 hours so no it's not a 30 hour game. Just like upper echelon iirc said.
---
If NW was f2p then there would be even more cheaters since they can just get a new account for free if they get banned.
---
Just more junk honestly. Some people dig it but it‚Äôs not end game stuff. Just novelty. I didn‚Äôt keep any of it didn‚Äôt keep any of the Fasnacht stuff, meet week stuff, or any of this Halloween crap. I‚Äôm just not in to cosmetics.
---
For some dumb reason I have 3 right above my bed, lol.
---
Lol üòÇ yuppppp
---
1. Your not familiar with fallout games are you? You loot everything in all fallout games.
---
2. Your not familiar with survival games were you gather resources to keep yourself well stocked
---
In previous fallout games you had clear stories and characters to talk to. Even fallout 4 had good characters and cool quests. I wasn't just looting everything I found cause that was not an option due to the carry weight penalties.
---
There is a couple, one renames all the items so it begin with a description, for example \[food\]Radstag meat, which orders all the items together in the list,   Another lets you click the tab at the top so it only shows certain items in that category, for example if you click the Aid tab it switches to Aid(Food), click again and it switches to Aid(Meds)
---
stop shooting at her or just cripple his wings with perks like "one gun army"
---
Lol I always get downvotes but no one ever tries to defend Bethesda. You guys are hilarious!
---
Sounds like an open world survival game to me....
---
Scavenging and scrapping and crafting are huge elements in a survival game...
---
Well try telling that to console players
---
That's true.
---
This is probably the last thing on their list. Bethesda are not really considering something as a bug, when it has some kind of workaround. In this case, you can just buy more Atoms. How convenient...
---
&gt;Do you know how stupid you sound? 
---
 Not as stupid as you telling someone they shouldn't like something that you don't. 
---
 Do you walk around restaurants telling people they're stupid for eating a food that you don't like?
---
 The world would be a better place without dingleberries like you.
---
You know, the internet may hate FO1st, but I'm seeing Scrap Boxes in almost every CAMP now so...
---
Contact Bethesda support, I they gave me the atoms last time I did.
---
Can we get the same for beds too? How about a reason of that nice large vault tec bed instead of these little kid ones.
---
That's pretty dope, wish console (PS4) had fan made quality of life like that.
---
Glad I don't feel the need to play this game like it's The Sims, not worried about stash space because I have 8 mules. As far a build budget goes, I make due and don't need to decorate my camp with clutter, function over flare. I don't want my camp to resemble a funhouse or circus tent.
---
Yeah, and that's all this game is about. In fact it's completely balanced and made around looting only. The carry weight doesn't insta slow you to facilitate looting. The vendors have a limit on the caps they have to avoid having too much loot sold. Literally every aspect of the game is about looting. There is nothing else apart from that.
---
Hey guys hey hey guys Fallout 1st bad give upvotes
---
I learned the plans because I want to complete all of them but the actual weapon I gave one away and scrapped another one. Weighs to much and I have no use for it.
---
They just need to bring the mat back. I don‚Äôt think it will cause any problems. Bring back the fast travel mat please.
---
You can mod fallout 4 on console
---
What happened to the junk you had in the scrapbox?
---
It was their choice to choose the inferior platform for playing. They can't blame anyone but themselves for this.
---
No. There‚Äôs not enough content for it to be single player. Maybe after wastelanders but I just have the feeling the dlc won‚Äôt be what they‚Äôre advertising.
---
I usually do 16-20 min. I know there are plenty of steps I could take to speed it up.
---
All that done, so you can kill two scorchbeast queens and be out of ammo again.
---
Is that why a persistent complaint about the game is lack of unlimited storage which you had in all other FO games?  Bit ironic that other apparently non looter games have gotten everyone so accustomed to unlimited storage that when faced with limited storage they complain.
---
Dude did you have a stroke while typing this or something?
---
Gauss turret is a strange request. I don‚Äôt hate it, but it‚Äôs not near the top of my wants list haha.
---
I've seen Tenderizers for as low as 500 caps recently. Seems like most people who want one already have one. I just have one for display.
---
Bethesda should fix this. This game is SURVIVAL, you are not meant to have any ammo!
---
I also really enjoyed this event. It had the same chaotic feeling as a SQB battle which I really enjoy. Especially when the assaultrons unleash hell.
---
Twas a grand time. These events are always a hit. They should do one for thanksgiving and one for the holidays.
---
This sounds more like you're pushing your own negative narrative in between the lines than really inquiring "should it be single player?"  Answering your query, no I don't think it would be better as a single person game - I bought it to play the game with others and I enjoy playing the game to this day with the same group I run around with since the BETA days.
---
Lmao yes, that adds an element of rng to it !!!
---
Had two weeklies and a daily auto complete, but I got the atoms. Even a buddy of mine logged on and got like 460 atoms out of no where and starting looking around to see how he got them.
---
Why are you downvoted so much lmao
---
That double and in title will forever bother me.
---
How do you even find games with 30 players. I have to wait like 20 minutes to be put in a server with 20 players.
---
It‚Äôs great to see the response time when the issue is with fallout 1st or the atomic shop! Glad you guys care about the game and not solely your sources of profit! :D
---
Do you have a source? I was looking for latest datamining images, but couldn't find it.
---
Thats kinda crazy, bcos we got guys using PA-texture glitch and it would take them 7minutes anyway.
---
This reminds me, I need to change my privacy settings so anyone can send me a message just in case..
---
Easy, they just make the Wastelanders version of Appalachia a separate mode to choose from on the main menu.  Just add "Wastanders" next to "Adventure", "Private World", and "Nuclear Winter".  If you choose "Wastelanders" without a FO1st subscription, the same thing happens as when you click on "Private Worlds" without a FO1st subscription.  With or without Wastelanders being FO1st exclusive, I believe this is how they will keep the content separate from the original story content of Adventure mode.  Isn't supposed to be about people coming back to the area after the Scorch plague has been dealt with?  Can't really have that be the story and then try to integrate it with the story of trying to find and destroy the source of the plague.
---
As for bashing it's useless for sure and every weapon with this is like without 2nd star, but if they'll fix 250DR while reloading it's pretty nice affix to have, especially with weapons that you reload frequently or it takes significant amount of time to do so. But it mustn't deactivate main effect like it sometimes do now (there is a workaround - you need to be crouching while reloading).
---
They won't add anything for the camp to the base game, it will be all atom shop. If they can't make money of it, they won't add it.
---
Same here but she lands even with me pelting her with bullets same with everyone else
---
You were fine with paying more on top of your paid subscription LUL
---
Same. I guessing they just mean she just lands less often if you're shooting her
---
You can play it single player, but it really is designed more as an open world survival game than a traditional RPG, and that relies more on things like a player economy.
---
Don't worry about it.  Play your game and move on.  Folks that dupe, if it's serious enough, or even worth the company's time to try and fix, will get sorted out.  Otherwise, business as usual.
---
It'd still be developed by BGS Austin mostly. By that alone, it wouldn't be THAT much better, if at all. They simply lack the competence, expertise and experience to pull off a good game. Almost all that is good with the game is attributed to other studios. Nuclear Winter battle royale is BGS Dallas' work. All the quests were handled by Maryland. Everything else was apparently Austin.
---
The poor combat balance, Austin. The plethora of bugs, Austin. The iffy areas with misaligned models or flickery textures, Austin. The power armor rework that no one asked for that took months to fix, Austin. The bugs that get fixed and then return at some later patch, Austin. The list goes on.
---
You expect these people to do a better job at a single player game than a multiplayer one? Maybe marginally. I mean everything is less complex by default but as I said before, competence, expertise and experience is severely lacking.
---
I believe so especially for 20.
---
Damnit! Now I'm gonna have to rebuild my entire camp to implement these cool tricks! AGAIN!
---
Only grab workshops if there is a challenge. I'll sometimes power up the power plant and set up the food processing plants with neon signs saying Free Food inside. Now that I got the Fallout 1st I generally just ask low levels if they want to claim a workshop in peace and invite them to my private world. Even am getting prepped for some Silos runs for them so they can get them done for the quest without worrying about some high level knocking them down as they rush for the terminal and steal the nuke.
---
That says a lot about your browsing history lol, mine brings up ads for market trading bots for some reason and I‚Äôm not a stoke broker I just searched for some information on it this week lol.
---
No. I will continue to trash this game until I get my money's worth or I get a refund. I will go on whatever platform I can and I will voice my opinion. FO76 is not even a game, it is a SCAM!
---
Oh shit, I need to go delete some stuff
---
It‚Äôs actually really fun, all the toxic people who hate on it don‚Äôt even play it, most of us don‚Äôt even notice the controversies in game, it‚Äôs pretty fun
---
Sure you can! Just prepare to spend $10 on it.
---
No problem. If you end up not getting one you can let me know, I know how it is being a bit of a completionist, always trying to complete sets.
---
They will, but they will probably be a Fallout 1st exclusive.
---
Just reality where all the triple A games will be *live services* so get use to it also was being sarcastic.
---
Thanks. At least you didn't insult me or mock me like the rest.
---
This and +1END not giving HP :(
---
Okay, okay, so hands up who downvoted me for wanting a gilded pickaxe? That weapon was beautiful. It deserved a makeover.
---
I'll give you 10 caps for one of your extras.
---
You can't stop the stuttering. It is a feature of this game and you have to deal with it. Even streamers with beefy PCs are experiencing this every 5-10 seconds.
---
We either get nothing or broken crap like the Halloween event.
---
I've met a lot of really great people playing this game, but every few days you seem to encounter some Fucktard that just enjoys annoying other people, or thinks they are entitled to everything for nothing, or they're more important than you.
---
Met one a couple days ago while visiting another players Camp vending, the player started shooting me as soon as I began looking in a machine (Not theirs), so I backed out, turned &amp; toasted him, he quickly came back seeking revenge with his Tesla, I wear full Bolstering Heavy Leather Armor, so I Trashed him again, and he came back yet a third time, only to die even more quickly before he was even in Tesla Range, at this point he messaged me that I was cheating because he couldn't hurt me, I replied that I was not cheating, and he was just ignorant of the games mechanics, to which he replied that I was being reported, then blocked me, lol.
---
Came for this one.
---
I am glad, i bought it at beta. Because ppl were running around and had absolutly no idea what is happening, helping each other and shit like that. It was great.
---
Now idk, i belive, you can enjoy it, but not as much as when game was released.
---
Solo , silo Alpha around level 46, took me about an hour.
---
Dadgum Mole miners.. Get off my lawn!
---
And has hackers anyway
---
they must have seriously fuckulated two shot in 76, then, cause if you had it on a high alpha semi auto in Fallout 4 the game's difficulty curve fucked off to cancun.
---
Yes give it to everyone!!!
---
Get another game worth your time for the same price, try the older fallouts if you havent yet
---
Yeah you have shit reading comprehension. Lol
---
You claimed a season pass gives access to paid DLC, the point you obviously missed is Bethesda doesn't follow your definition of season pass or subscription seeing as they call ESO+ a subscription. But yeah keep failing to miss the point. Continue to demonstrate why you fanboys are mocked so badly due to your insane mental gymnastics.
---
Right after we get the one that says, don't one shot melee the legendary
---
If everyone isnt having the same crashing problems maybe part of the problem is your isp, equipment. 
---
Do I get occasional crashes, sure.  It‚Äôs not rampant for me though. Mischief nights was laggy but I was able to complete them and only had one crash during the event
---
But they will soon offer their own "native" anti-cheat software for only a mere 20.00 bucks extra a month....
---
Yeah gets repetitive and boring quick lol
---
There are 2 random encounter locations near that fissure. One has a chance to spawn up to 3 scorchbeasts in addition to the one that comes out of the fissure. Both locations can spawn sheepsquatches. 
---
Random encounter map: https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg
---
Haven‚Äôt experienced any of this in months (okay maybe frame drops)
---
If they can't keep making money they have no reason to keep developing the game. So basically me paying a subscription means you get new stuff. You're welcome.
---
Well, did the brahmin survive?
---
Even before Fallout 1st the game did so well that they just hired 20+ more people for the studio. If they can pay out 20 more salaries and Zenimax are still happy with the money rolling in they are not doing too bad.
---
A thing like ESO+ and Fallout 1st will always just be for a select group of players who is both interested enough in the game and has the income to buy it without it being a burden. It would never ben nor planned neither targeted at a group as large as 35%. And the comparison was to Zenimax other online game, regardless of age. It is about how they, as a company market their product.
---
Me too.  I put a prime auto on mine and love this gun for sbq runs now.  I focus mostly on the mobs while unloading on her some to ensure I get my share o loot.  I hate the ammo issue but so far I am able keep up.  I‚Äôve narrowed my build down to three handmade.  A TSE, a FE and a ZE.  Looking for a TE and a AAE.  My favourite currently is the FE.
---
I'm sure it doesn't mean much to someone trying so hard to avoid reality. This game has been a nightmare of server stability since launch, and it hasn't changed. They are using cheap Amazon shards, ffs man.
---
I do crash outside of MN. Everyone does. A few days ago I got the "server not responding" thing, and got sent back to the menu. When trying to log back in, the game froze while loading; I had to restart the game and I crashed once more not even 20 minutes after that.
---
What I'm trying to say is: defend the game if you want to, try to sell it to OP if it means so much to you. But don't fucking lie, because it's painfully obvious for everyone that this game has probably the worst servers and the worst stability out of any multiplayer game out there.
---
Their mistake from the beginning was trying to fit all these different experiences into one multiplayer box. The people who won‚Äôt  or can‚Äôt play an online multiplayer game immediately felt excluded, the multiplayer fans felt like there wasn‚Äôt enough happening, and eventually there was a rift between PvE and PvP players‚Äîwith each feeling like they were being alienated at one point or another. Making fans feel excluded or alienated isn‚Äôt how you make a great game. 
---
From the start, 76 should‚Äôve had a real story with fleshed out characters and a dedicated single player experience. Most Fallout fans are single player RPG fans first. That‚Äôs how that story should‚Äôve been told. Let the fans who want to just pay their $60 and play a Fallout game have that experience. When story DLC comes out, let them buy it individually. 
---
Then there should‚Äôve been a multiplayer experience‚Äîbasically what we have now, but focusing on events, loot etc. Nobody trying to complete story quests and having their immersion broken by other people. That multiplayer experience should‚Äôve been broken into two modes‚Äîa PvP and a PvE mode‚Äîso that players who are wary of PvP or getting griefed could know they wouldn‚Äôt have that forced on them and those who enjoy PvP could have a guilt free experience. 
---
That multiplayer experience could‚Äôve been funded as it was initially, with a subscription model or some combo of the two. 
---
All this would‚Äôve led to better content in all modes and not alienated any part of the fan base‚Äîwhich would‚Äôve led to much less (if any) backlash and bad PR.
---
Its always creepy to here what is going on in personal lives. Yesterday I was playing COD Mobile and kept hearing these kids trying to get my teammates attention. Of course after the game ends, he photo comes up and you realize she is like some 22 year old with 2 kids and is not really taking care of them or at least choosing a game over them for the moment.
---
Post revised with egg types.
---
They gave me a free fridge and collectron.  You could have them too if you wanted.
---
Stay out in the open.  Get off buildings and fences.
---
I have 600+ hours in the game. It absolutely has improved since launch. Last fall I would g disconnected multiple times per hour, how I could go 8 without any issues (while streaming even). It sounds like you have some issues on your end.
---
Of course you haven't. Everyone on this sub complaining about constant crashes is lying.
---
&gt; It's all digital items that take zero real resources to make.
---
You work for free?
---
but they're not paying more on top of the subscription because the atoms come with the subscription
---
Noice, I've had to narrow down my weaponry lol I've got 2 ranged and 3 melee
---
Sure, and the dozens of people reporting the same thing are lying too!
---
Shills, man. Pointless.
---
They likely sell the accounts after a certain amount of wins.
---
Digital resources take real physical resources to make -- the real physical resources you give to the people who make them.
---
This game is already shitty enough, they made it a battle royal ffs
---
According to a leak, Bethesda will add soon what they called "borderline" items to the Atom Shop, to see how the community reacts. 
---
If the whales prevail, they will continue to break their "only cosmetic" promise and cross the line towards P2W. And let's not fool ourselves, this *will* happen, because the shills will eat all the shit Bethesda throws at them and then praise Todd for it.
---
I mean they've never acted this quickly to change due to backlash before, which leads me to believe it was actually unintended
---
I just started toying with a non legendary tactical gatling plasma.
---
Used it for most of mischief night.
---
Seems to be a decent weapon, especially against bots.  Also seems to be very conservative on plasma core consumption.
---
If the  25% faster fire rate also decreases spinup time, it may be a bonus.
---
Might want to try yours out before deciding to dump it.
---
From the other comments so far it looks like it is an unpopular opinion, but I think it would have been better as an offline, single player game sold for $30, and with no microtransactions. Or alternatively, as a full single player "Fallout 4.5" game with at least one more year of development, so that all the content from the Wastelanders update is already included at launch. Although I would not object to the inclusion of some sort of simple peer to peer coop mode where the other players are like followers, as long as there is still an offline mode and the implementation of the multiplayer elements does not involve compromises that make the single player experience worse.
---
Obviously, this is subjective, as I mostly play solo myself, others may find the multiplayer aspect much more valuable. But for me, the occasional minor interaction with other players is not worth all the negatives. The multiplayer conversion seems to be responsible for the majority of serious technical issues (disconnects, lag, bad performance compared to FO4, all sorts of bugs that are new in FO76 and are related to unreliable and slow client-server communication, and so on), as well as gameplay limitations and design choices related to making the game online and the associated business model (non-persistent world, stash limit, vendor limit, scrip limit, camp limit, nerfs, perk management, grinding, and more - all with the goal of balancing a multiplayer economy, saving server costs, and to extend the gameplay as much as possible to maximize atom shop revenue).
---
Of course, if (and that is a big if) the game somehow delivers on the original promise of years of free content being added, then the business model may pay off in the distant future. As I do not expect the next single player Fallout before around 2029, if FO76 manages to survive until then and receive "Far Harbor" sized content per year, then it becomes the largest Fallout game by the end, and I would not mind buying 1 month of subscription each year (about the price of a DLC) whenever the major Wastelanders-like updates drop. However, based only on what we have right now, the "live service" model was not a good idea, not even in terms of profit (considering the costs of converting the Creation engine to a client-server architecture, and that FO76 sold only a fraction of the copies compared to FO4), and I also suspect that the above optimistic scenario for the future would come at the cost increasing monetization that would become more and more similar to that of ESO over time.
---
Welcome to the world today. Lots of this incivility/sense of division is actively encouraged by some of those in power. Video Games are very much reflecting the trends in the greater world right now. We don't really get along with each other like we used too. We no longer accept people with different opinions/viewpoints. I will be the first to admit that I have fallen prey to this myself at times. 
---
But the current President of the most powerful nation got their by being a self obsessed asshole. After that happened, people really started questioning the national/communal spirit we had previously. This has since spread throughout the world.
---
I'd rather boycott run on sentences.
---
Or well they could just fix the bug and then add the freezing effect? I know that's just crazy. 
---
I would rather see wounding return and get some of that crazy stacking bleed damage going. Plasma effect was kind of cool too.
---
I know it‚Äôs a real problem lol
---
Maybe we should change the name of the game/mode to Nuclear Fuckup.
---
I know a lot, if not most of it, is or was stuff that was duped. On Xbox at least. The same tse handmade, same be handmade, be Gatling plasma, unyielding sent set etc. but I did see a tse fixer for 99.99 the time I looked so it‚Äôs not all duped guns!
---
I‚Äôm an avid power armour user so the bezerkers mod conflicts with my play style. That‚Äôs why I wanted to sell it. I‚Äôm gonna list it for 200 and see if it goes
---
Tbf I've noticed servers being more dodgy and slow again since the subscription came out. They must have just thought ah fuck it do it anyway.
---
But yes I do think it should be for all of us. I want my weightless scrap!
---
I play single player/solo on this game 99% of the time...
---
If only that were true. I guess it's better than acknowledging the fact that you're  playing into the hands of a lazy marketing team. It's weird to me how people are justifying microtransactions and bogus subscriptions with this argument. We all paid for the base game and even that wasn't worth any money in my opinion. Launch was a mess. Bethesda and Zeni haven't earned the $60 for base release and they sure as hell aren't still putting half assed content out because you paid for Fallout 1sted and a bunch of shitty skins.
---
They already confirmed this is in the works a while back.
---
Old, bug closed as wont fix, please buy more mtx
---
People have been asking for this since release... Get ready to pay money for it!!!
---
Save this post I bet money they add it to Fallout 1st.
---
It should've still been released, but as an actual Beta, what we had was not a proper beta, people just got to play a bit a week early.
---
How would nuclear winter increase atomic shop sales 6000%?
---
These are important facts, we need to know.
---
100% agreed. Minus the praise. There will be some, but with a lot of this utility stuff I've seen a lot of "this shouldn't be there... but take my money anyways". There will be lots of hate. Everyone will be like "look how upset the community is" as they all buy the shit
---
Ooouuu fallout tower defense! I'd love that. Have 3 minutes to build with unlimited resources. Then take increasingly bigger waves of different creatures until your team of 4 is killed.
---
They'd have to restrict the building to some basic items to stop us building a concrete bunker and hiding inside though.
---
Most people do not like this game and also Bethesda has been acting like assholes. That overall is going to bring more toxic people in general. Also I am pretty sure the engine is very old and exploitable. Again another thing that will bring greater then average toxic people.
---
Its strange, because a few years ago "being toxic" was "being a gamer" in some ways. The toxic gamer was the general view of the gamer. Gaming has become so big and accepted now that its flipped. It is a good sign that many are even identifying "toxic behavior" nowadays. Previously that type of shit was almost protected in the gaming community.
---
My camp
---
Why so certain about a christmas event? I think that they will go on vacation and nobody left to handle all of that stuff
---
I believe the correct term is "Fortified" egg nog.
---
I don't run into Flatwoods Monster nearly often enough. Last week/two weeks ago, whenever it was an Atom challenge, I had to run around with a damn tin foil hat in my inventory the whole week before I finally found one and could put the stupid thing on to fight it.
---
I disagree with that. Junk if the true currency of the game and lead to the countless hours of inventory management. However I understand that differing playstyles could lead to this disagreement. And it‚Äôs obvious that from the beginning of the game the devs didn‚Äôt know how to differentiate a limitless junk from the stash
---
If it isn't about Fallout 1st, expect to wait a long time until it gets fixed.
---
Johnson‚Äôs acre is one of my favorite, south of the map slightly to the right of the bear, on top of the Little Rock is a fun suprise. And a beautiful view
---
Lmao
---
I got one sentence in and stopped reading. You're still totally wrong, but. It's *you* who doesn't understand basic economics and market principles here, not me. Regardless, you being a dbag doesn't earn you any points, just a block. So long idiot, try reading a few books and learning a few things. You'll look far less foolish.
---
I'm sorry for accusing them of being wrong. And I'm sorry for jumping to things. The only reason i did that was because there was a lot of proof against them. If there is a way i can pay them back for my stupidity in game then let me know. I'm on ps4. Also I'm sorry for their loss. And just to clarify i did not downvote a single thing on the original post. I never do that unless they do the equivalent of out right admitting what they did.
---
Private 8 person servers for subscribers, and private locally hosted 4 person servers for everyone else including scrapbox for everyone?
---
I didn't start playing until after Christmas, so "recycled" would be new to me....
---
Its the same subscription service as in elder scrolls online.  
---
You know, ESO, the game that launched as a buggy mess, but after a total redesign is now regarded as one of the best MMOs on the market.
---
It's a game not a political revolution, either get with the program or don't.
---
Various cryptid and mutant animal eggs for different effects of egg nog
---
So 15 bucks worth of atoms on top of your 15 dollar subscription that includes private servers, a skin, tent, and scrapbox? Its basically free.
---
I haven't tried since the latest patch but it has always been hit or miss in my experience.
---
Wow, they STILL haven't fixed this?
---
The promised land!
---
Yeah I remember that bug. I had a freezing pipe pistol that I used for awhile and fucked up a lot of static spawn points before I realized what was happening.
---
That said, I've used the Cryolater a lot and haven't seen that issue. It did have the ash pile issue like other energy weapons but I haven't seen this particular FO4 bug at all.
---
I find them at night near where the gulpers are, and they have to be glowing. It seems random but I get them about 1 in 5 server jumps.
---
I just bought $5,000 worth of Fallout 76 merchandise from the Bethesda store because of this thread.  Gonna pay a dozen supermodels to walk around in Fallout 76 t-shirts in Times Square now, brb.
---
Well its not that they did anything directly to melee its just with the 110 dmg cap in pvp it makes it kind of useless without the 1 hit potential
---
Not at all.
---
Why are you in a games subreddit exclusively to hate on it and shit on people who do like it? Just ignore the game and it‚Äôs subreddit and go away
---
And then add 70 years of nuclear innovation. Up top 2022 when the bombs dropped
---
Unfortunately it isn't statistically meritorious.
---
If you could get a random sampling of ~100 players across all platforms, you would have a solid result set.
---
By querying the reddit, you are only getting players who are vocal and/or interested in coming to reddit.  How do you account for that bias?  It could be that these players are also the ones most upset, and that is what brings them here, but the other 90% of the player base are fine with it.
---
I'm not saying that is true, it's just what it is.
---
Upvoted! Hope Bethesda read this post and good luck üëç‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Is it a bug or is it part of the cheat engine being used?
---
Theyre "tide" pods now, theres a challenge where you eat them, and try to survive.
---
&gt; encourage everyone to look at this guy's post history if you want a good example of a Bethesda shill.
---
Lmao. Why yes, I do believe I mentioned earlier in the thread here that the fallout subs are the only ones I belong to, it's the reason I joined Reddit in the first place. I also encourage everyone to take a look at my post history, it's been consistent and it'll show exactly what I'm talking about, showing all the posts that are from people outside this sub, just stoking the flames. 
---
Do you really believe that there are more fake positive posts than trolls that don't even play the game? You've said you played the game for more than 2K hours ..think about that for a minute.  That's as much as a full work year in less than 1 year of the game. I have played every single FO when they were released.  So, yup, I'm a fan ..and I'm old. But again, I've never hid from that. I try to help people in game and I try to counter bullshit here when the lies and misinformation get too deep. 
---
Now, can we get back to the topic at hand? Are you ready to man up and apologize?
---
If you are on pc I would like to get that plasma off you!
---
Ps4 unfortunately
---
Definitely a bug, it's on PS4 not PC.
---
Well, did you meet up with any sexy asian women?
---
why were you downvoted...?
---
I've been checking every chance I get when it's night time and they are never there :/
---
&gt; So almost 20% of Fallout 76 players decided to subscribe.
---
I doubt this is that accurate.
---
Great question! 
---
  Halloween being the only holiday for which I decorate, my objective after clearing IRL stuff is to raze my "budget is full"camp and remodel with all the stuff I picked up during mischief night :)
---
The same 7-8 players kept coming back for me
---
The problem with all the people defending this is that these players aren‚Äôt engaged in real pvp. Watching a map to see when a workshop is claimed, fast traveling to the exact location the other player is at, one-shoting them while they‚Äôre unarmed and busy building a resource collector or fighting off wave 1 of 4 of whatever they‚Äôre having to defend against, all while being over 100 levels higher than them? Not pvp. You didn‚Äôt have to put in any work to find them and you have no risk attacking them. Not pvp and I just don‚Äôt see how it can be any fun for you either. The last guy that did it to me didn‚Äôt even bother to take my loot bag or claim the workshop so what‚Äôs the point?
---
Hey there,
---
The team are aware of this issue and are actively investigating. Thank you for the reports as always!
---
Thanks for paying 10 bucks or whatever for a subscription! My 80 bucks for the tricentennial preorder is nothing compared to that!
---
I got 8 last night.
---
Here are the realities that I'm seeing in game;
---
* More than half the Camps I visit have Scrap Boxes
---
* 40% of my friends have purchased 1 year subscriptions, 30% have 1 month, 25% are waiting to see what happens when the 1 month expires.
---
   * The few that haven't gotten it wish they could, but can't afford it.
---
* I have not experienced any Griefing while using my Ranger Outfit and Icon. nor have any of my friends.
---
* It is not "Pay to Win" it's simply QOL, and Cosmetics. 
---
Like it or not, for those who play this game a lot, it's a great deal, on a 1 year subscription you are getting 1650 Atoms a month at \~1/2 price.

---
And it was in fact night time in game?
---
Not worth 10k at all. They used to but now they aren‚Äôt that rare anymore
---
the game is extemly buggy - even for bethesda , and no -  I am not a "hater"
---
Wait... Cryolator and Flame thrower?
---
Good idea. Like mothman eggs give bonus xp vs using mirelurk eggs give a damage resistance against mirelurks and bugs.
---
But it‚Äôs a space suit. Not a earth rad suit. So the nuclear power would not really change that. Some spacecraft (unmanned) use nuclear power today and for a permanent base on the moon or mars we would have nuclear power. But a spacesuit for those would still not offer much rad protection.
---
I can see a valid argument about the tent. It does give an advantage when you are out and about. 
---
The Youtubers will always complain because that's how they get views.  I actually can't watch them because the majority of stuff they post is not good or valid information.
---
Your way is much quicker.
---
Repairing the Pipes,and killing the Robots is time consuming.
---
Also you can end up in a fight with a Robot during the repair, timing out,and have to do it all again.
---
Recipe*
---
Lol yes, you can get a flamer mod for the cryolator and the plasma gun that turns them into flame throwers but with blue cold flames and  green plasma flames. So it's a flame thrower for rifleman perks.  Believe they also work with the friendly fire perk.
---
It's actually what's holding me back from subscribing, and ironically, the thing I covet most from Fallout 1st. If they just gave it to everyone, or made it part of a quest, I would gladly rent a server every once in awhile (I play solo so it wouldn't affect me enough to pay for an entire year). I'm not mad, I still enjoy the game, but yeah, I will not subscribe based on that one pay-walled item alone.
---
It was so much fun and it was cool to see everyone in costume. I didn‚Äôt get to play as much the last two days due to work and missed my chance at getting the pirate outfit. I got like two hats but the costume eluded me.
---
I agree.  Always hit-and-miss.  Never been able to discern a pattern to it.
---
Do you know if I need to apply for the refund or it will be given without it?
---
I pay up to 1k for 3* scrip weapons, so 500-1k isn't really saying much.
---
Both these items are scrip.
---
No idea why  cheats enjoy cheating so much.
---
I play games for the enjoyment,and challenge.
---
My theory is they dont really get any real enjoyment when they are using Aimbot.
---
They are the gaming equivalent of internet Trolls.They do it just to piss gamers off.
---
&gt;There should be some benefit to the sub, but nothing that comes at the expense of other people's gameplay
---
There is absolutely nothing about it that affects others gameplay, prior to getting the Forward Tent, I used a Mobile Base for one of my characters, the use of Blue Prints makes it very quick to deploy with more functionality than the Tent, and the cost is insignificant.
---
It would need to. Because in the fallout universe everything runs in nuclear. Ever seen back to the future? There Slater culture was far more important for longer and their future had hoverboard and in stead of YouTube they had TV's with the ability to view 6 channels at once. Technology changes things. You can't say they used a flight suit with very little radiation in the 50's for a space suit so it should be the same. 
---
The space suits should have radiation protection because if the evolution of the technology of the fallout universe which is nuclear
---
Can you at least make bug fixes a 1st exclusive ?
---
I‚Äôd pay 5$ to use my BE Gatling plasma over that garbage green ncr armor
---
I will pay up to 25 caps per scrip point, so 1k max for 3* weapons, 375 max for 2* weapons. Others will pay more or less, but it won't sit in your machine forever at 1k, I promise.
---
Teach a man to fish...
---
I think what they're saying is "Bethesda makes buggy games that's just them" sounds like you're justifying making a buggy game because they have in the past. While I've played most Bethesda games and have relied on modders to "fix" their previous games I honestly would like to see Bethesda held accountable more for their bugs. It would be nice to see them improving rather than just chalking it up to just "Bethesda being Bethesda" if that makes sense?
---
With you on this, there's moments I need to actually use it to survive but when it refuses to fire after spinning I die and then I get angry over it.
---
Not easy using a bloodied minigun with ffr at low hp when it wouldn't fire lmao
---
No, just the existence of other players out there gives the world a different feel. Being able to visit other players camps. To see how they've decorated it. To watch them while they are sleeping. To lean in close and breath in the scent of their hair, all the time hoping they won't wake, won't spoil this perfect moment.
---
Why would you want to take that away?
---
They still dont have a "no mic" emote?
---
I'm probably going to be an asshole for saying this, but I don't think Bethesda should do it. Imagine if every fan came up to developers  asking to put a loved ones name they lost into their games in some type of way?
---
It's a bit different if the developers come to the person/family asking if it's okay since it's their decision to do it and under the circumstances that the developers want. But when someone comes up to the developers and asks them, it's a huge moral issue because if Bethesda ignores them, they look like assholes, decline it, they still somewhat look like assholes and if they do it then everyone is happy.
---
Not only that, but it also feels narcissistic in it's own way. Sharing about the death of your newborn daughter is okay and fine. It has to be a hard thing to handle and cope with, I can't even imagine how horrible it feels, but to ask developers to put her in some shape or form into the game, and other people's lives without them even knowing it? What makes her so special to other people? To the person she was everything and I get and understand that, but majority probably just don't care.
---
I truly don't mean to come off as an asshole and I'm truly sorry for the couple's loss, but there's really no "nice" way of saying that asking developers to put your daughter into the game is a crappy thing to do
---
So you didn't even read what he wrote but say it's bullshit and hes a fool? 
---
Everything you do is attacking him personally instead of answering with facts and rational arguments. That's foolish.
---
The way how aggresive you react to negative opinions about the gamee make you look like a payed shill.
---
How old is he? I think that's an important piece if information.
---
lol - I assume thats better? Ill get the hang of it one day.
---
&gt;At first I tried to play this game as I would play a fallout game.... which is always looting everything.
---
There, fixed it for you. Much shorter too.
---
I thought I was the only one who actually likes Biv but guess not!
---
There‚Äôs a trail heading into the woods near the east side of the ammo factory.
---
Train tracks south of Sunnytop
---
Lots of cool sites northeast of Freddy‚Äôs...lots and lots of empty space there
---
Train tracks east of Harper‚Äôs Ferry
---
Tanagra
---
They might take you seriously
---
this happens to me a lot. Good tip.
---
I‚Äôd rather we get some actual content like bug fixes or DLC
---
I have seen this aswell.alot of bugsstill aren't fixed.
---
Automatic refunds will all be handled and sorted in a few days for all accounts flagged with the purchase of the product ID, if you haven‚Äôt received your refund by Monday this coming week (11/11/19) you can contact Bethesda Support in regards to the refund. If you have to contact support directly be sure to make a note of the time you spent your Atoms if you remember, just incase they ask for that but it‚Äôs unlikely as they can just scan your account for all purchases made I believe.
---
Nope, sorry, about to be blocked person, but he started the name calling, and he got back what he was giving, far less than what I'd normally say, in fact.
---
I'm not reacting negatively to people saying bad things about the game, and you're reading anger where there was none. That's on you, not me.  Reacting negatively to people not understanding the basic economics of the situation. Dude played about 150 hours, months and months ago, and still wants to come on this sub to complain? Makes me wonder who is paying people like him and like you to badmouth the game. See, ridiculous statements are ridiculous, even when you're the one making them. Bye bye now, you won't be missed, you won't even be remembered.
---
Welcome to retail.
---
#16 TIMES THE DETAIL
---
To be blunt, Fallout 1st could have just been about locking in a low price on Atoms for the year and I would have been content.
---
For the sake of not having everyone retreat into their own private worlds, I agree that private servers should be a subscription-based thing, but everything else, the Scrapbox especially, should be available to everyone.  The Scrapbox is such a drastic improvement on the gameplay loop that they are crippling the game's potential not offering it to everyone.
---
The TENT - yes, it's nice having a forward camp like this.  It allows you to put your forever home in a safe place, like the Forest, and use your TENT abroad.  But at the same time, this is just as much an indictment against the goofy system they have for enemy NPCs attacking CAMPs, and the rules regarding nukes as well.  If you improved both these things, which are long overdue to begin with, I think the TENT would matter less.
---
I mean... I wouldn't mind paying for private *servers* (even though I'd rather be able to host it myself for free, like many games used to do in the past).
---
But the private "worlds" that Bethesda is selling are nothing more than private instances, that some f2p games offer for free (and with better privacy controls, mind you)...
---
12yrs
---
Tagging u/[Ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ladydevann/) as this seems right up her ally as something to champion. :)
---
Good point!
---
No i love my nocturnal bash 250 reload middle launcher!!! This would ruin my build!
---
And and
---
tbh I was expecting more salt... I don't even have Fallout 1st just wanted to see what people had to say. r/fallout would have destroyed my life for this post.
---
He should just make a grave or a memorial in Minecraft like everyone else
---
This would be entirely dependent on them doing the right thing and getting an anti-cheat  working.
---
Nope, by rpg standards, the story is bare bones with not many memorable moments.  The world is big but largely empty, nothing really stands out other than the Whitesprings.  Without online, this would be labeled as the worst Fallout game in it's current state.
---
Dang looks like I'll be one shotting every mole miner from now on. Just for the laughs
---
That is not true.
---
I did 2 SBQ runs last night on PS4.
---
First SBQ run there were a dozen gamers on the Roof/Fence blitzing her in the Sky with all sorts.She landed at least 5/6 times.On the last time i think SBQ Glitched out,staying on the ground for a good 3/4 minutes not moving whilst everyone killed her.
---
On the the second SBQ run later on,there were just 4/5 players,2/3 high levels,and 2 level 40+ players..SBQ took minimal damage,landed,glitched out and started jumping from one place to another.Flew off for 5 minutes,reappeared,flew over and disappeared again,returning when there was 1 minute left.Everyone except me had given up and gone.
---
To be fair, while it *is* awesome on a Minigun, it doesn't change the fact that it's still a junk effect on 95% of weapons.
---
Same here. On xbox
---
I managed to kill a lvl 237 at lvl 70 but he had a teammate
---
Omg investigating? You should have fixed this already and ready to ship like 3 patches ago
---
It looks like the "No" button got stuck. There are a lot of scrap bins in the game right now. As there are alot of people on here just for the trash talking and dont even play the game i expected the results would be a bit one sided. Good idea for real OP but you are relying on humans to be honest on the internet. We're not there yet.
---
Don't give him the stuff then teach him how to get stuff
---
stealth crit builds can be your friend! especially bloodied or explosive!
---
There would obviously be less outrage, but probably also a fair bit lower sales of the subscription, especially after the first month is over. I guess the company has enough data from ESO Plus and the crafting bag, and the feature is considered to be enough of a major seller to make it worth for them even with the backlash.
---
I just moved my camp and all my blueprints disappeared. So, that was fun. I keep telling myself, ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
At first I tried to play this as I would play a fallout game... which is not looting everything cause the carry weight does not allow you to, and then do meaningful quests regarding the main story or cool side quests. There you go, fixed even more.
---
Same with me. I was given this game for Christmas last year as I‚Äôm a big fallout fan. I‚Äôm not happy with some of the issues. But those aside I love exploring and it‚Äôs like my second life. I enjoy evolving my camp and the people I meet along the way. Only have came across a few aggressive players most are friendly. I‚Äôm always asked why don‚Äôt  you play something else but I‚Äôm addicted to it.
---
Oh no doubt, they should only have it be possible on the minigun honestly.
---
I'd like a little 'has voice chat muted' symbol next to my name, so people don't waste their time trying to talk to me.
---
Jesus christ you are one seriously petty and bitter old fool -  do you even listen to yourself? Grow a spine and find something productive to do mate. If what you said was REALLY your standpoint, you wouldn't be wasting your time stalking a fallout thread. You're just here to throw a tantrum and make a fuss, it's plain as day. Go on, shoo. You're stinking up the air I breathe xD
---
Heavies are really powerful. Too powerful imo. It's just that rifles almost always benefit from sneak and pull off at least double the damage via sneak attack all the time. Some nerf must be made to stealth builds but that's my opinion. When you are out of stealth, nothing can beat heavies except melee builds
---
&gt; Hes erm officially not old enough to play @ 12yrs. Im a bad parent but i cant see the harm in this game at all.
---
Have you listened to the holotapes?
---
I would say let him learn, that's the best part about the game. I mean sure revive him, show him where to get stims and maybe once you've seen he can do it all then give him some of your spare items.
---
let's say you give him an amazing gun, when he finds his own it won't matter to him., Give him something to survive with bit leave a gap for improvement.
---
Totally agree
---
Crazy seeing the very few dedicated players still, the most wholesome thing ever. Props to the rest of you guys still left dealing with Bethesda‚Äôs bs!
---
I agree. Story seems sketchy AF but photos seem legit so not making any claim about the veracity of this, but it doesn't even matter. It's weird and kind of narcissistic of these people to ask for this and I don't think it should be rewarded.
---
That is a valid reason. I will not subscribe because I honestly think Wastelanders is their last chance. Bugs are still in the game since the release. PA mods that have been in the game are still not working. Not ones that I would use but should be working.
---
Because it's a multiplayer game
---
I will be keeping it for monthly up until wastelanders comes out. 
---
If wastelanders is broken I will not play 76 anymore. If wastelanders is good I will subscribe for a year
---
I enjoy playing with my 5 family members that play and it‚Äôs just a more enjoyable experience in a private server as to a public server. Plus I‚Äôm convinced that private servers have much more legendarys than regular servers
---
I also feel like an asshole for adding on, how does adding a memorial in a video game that gets shit on constantly a good thing? What does it add to help with the grieving process? The only thing I can imagine it does is give attention to the parent.   
---
Plus, the newborn daughter didn‚Äôt know of the game. All the stories you hear, it‚Äôs because the child loved the game to death.
---
I remember people telling me launch week that they'd have this game fixed by December, February *the latest*.
---
Find one or two common ammo types you don't use, put that ammo in your vendors for a cap each.
---
Doing events gets you paid in items and caps as well as exp.
---
Walk most places even if fast travel makes more sense, you'll save caps.
---
You are 100% right for the lucky handlfull that have BE lmgs, or miniguns can instantly kill everything. I have a AAE mingun which is powerfull (maximum of 75 damage a shot so far) and with stablized perk I ignore 95% of my targets armor in total. It is fun but damage bugs prevent me from getting full damage.
---
&gt;  it also feels narcissistic in it's own way
---
Absolutely. I'd never force thousands of people to share my personal grief with me.
---
[u/MutantsOnly100](https://www.reddit.com/user/MutantsOnly100/) maybe you can suggest to Elijah to honour his daughter with something within the boundaries of his C.A.M.P. I think it would be a nice trade-off.
---
I believe people wouldn't be so mad.
---
There was a leak recently that Fallout 1st might get a trail period similar to ESO plus (basically get a few days to use it randomly). Fingers crossed it's true :)
---
When you get to higher levels earning caps gets easier.  Eventually, you run out of things to do with them.
---
It reads like a pissed off Yoda
---
Selling drugs to vendors will net you several hundread caps / day :-)
---
I got 4 tenderizers and all the plans
---
You have to select it on the store
---
For people like me and I assume you who have caps to spend with no problem I would agree. I think most people like to set down in a nice place and not worry about moving. And if you know the map you can figure out where to scrap and store.  I think the infinite scrap box could have possibly made the servers a little more stable. Would have cut down on the amount stuff people drop.
---
I think you need to balance a bit of both. 
---
Early Game
---
At the early levels, he needs to understands the survival aspects of the game, such as getting water and food, and the consequences of not doing that. You don't need to go crazy with a camp, just have him make a bunch of boiled water and shove some of it in his stash, which should last a while. You don't really need to give him much of anything, just guide him to places where he can get those things and have fun killing things together. Make sure he learns at a low level when to kill things, and when to run away. It might help you create a new character that is low level with him, so you don't just kill everything for him.
---
Mid to late game
---
Once he knows the basics and he is starting to develop a build, the type of help you do can change. He should be independent in terms of getting the basics for survival, but tossing him a new chest plate, or some plans to craft something on his own isn't bad. If you were playing with a friend, they would probably help you more at this point by dumping tons of stuff on you, whether stimpacks or tons of ammo. As long as at this point he understands how valuable those things are, the gift is appreciated and helps the two of you to just have fun.
---
no, and he wont either lol. What is it? Cant be worse than what he sees / hears in real life in a city centre.

Agreed. As much as a death of anyone in your family can be hard as hell, let alone a baby, respect them on your own in private instead of trying to bring it to a game. This won't make moving on easier, and as hard as it is to move on, you gotta do it.
---
Make him buy more stims from you, and charge him more if he needs them because he ran in like a ninny, less if it's just regular attrition of gear.
---
I got to be honest man. For me the only advantage the tent has is the scrap bin. I set it up by watoga station so i can put my junk straight into the bin. Unless youre just starting fast travel costs are fine. It has a banjo. Instruments are everywhere. It has a bed and stove. Which are everywhere. I 100% agree that it should have been available to everyone. But the only thing that i use it for is the scrap bin which is part of the subscription. Which yes should have been available to everyone. But its not. Its less a free fast travel point and more a mobile scrap bin.

Are you running the AAE with adrenal, nerdrage, chems/food buffs and a sliver of health? Just asking not trolling, so not trying to bait another bloodied is to easy with no drawbacks thread but theres a lot more that goes into it then just slap a bloodied gun on and L2win 
---
Plus heavy has that sweet sweet LMG for the drop it quick fights thatd be delicious murder if I could keep enough 308.
---
You have to actually switch to the weapon to see the updated damage (on the PC anyway). Have you tried actually wielding the weapons? You can also turn on damage display in the menu and try shooting stuff to see what numbers pop up...
---
A 12 year old has almost certainly heard every bad word you know of and seen far worse online than anything included in this game. 
---
As for your main question - I would let him learn the consequences of his actions in the video game.  He rushes in?  That‚Äôs his error which hopefully he learns from.
---
I have not heard "Head-Carrots" before. You are awesome.
---
Don't teach a man to fish ... and feed yourself. He's a grown man.  And fishing is not that hard.
---
I'm starting to think that Fallout 1st is a good way to move each player away from game, because maybe Bethesda wishes to close it. Expansion postponed? That could be the reason for the delay.
---
Selling drugs to death claws will net you several missing limbs per day
---
Negative, you are exactly the kind of RP nerd I am looking for.
---
I have been playing tabletop RPGs since the 80s, the bar is just set pretty low here to keep entry open. I fully expect that there are people interested but they don't know how to do it. 
---
We also have to kind of redefine how RP happens in 76 as there is a lack of usable emotes and social tools in the base game. You almost have to take a tabletop approach and describe everything via voice.
---
Its not a bug but a feature to give you incentive to pay for atoms. Or maybe Bethesda just hates NW mode and wants it to fail into the ground.
---
Is there a bug with AAE weapons? Regardless, I recommend you go low health build whether your weapon is bloodied or not. Get adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage then install emergency protocol to your PA. Trust me, you'll fare much better. Or just get bloodied weapon. Even 1 star bloodied will outperform a god roll AAE minigun. Even better, get a 50 cal or gatling
---
Sells pretty quick for 750-850c from my vend. May be able to get a little more
---
okay, thanks!
---
I would not trust that leaker too much, but it is a reasonable prediction regardless, because the subscription is already similar to ESO Plus, and as far as I know a one week long "test" subscription was already data mined (it might even have been the reason why the subscription was disabled for a lot of people exactly 1 week after launch, because they got the trial version by mistake and it expired).
---
Absolutely agree
---
You're not wrong.  I agree.  Not to diminish the experience of someone else, I have total sympathy - my younger brother had died a month after birth due to lung defects, my father passed away two weeks before my wedding due to cancer, my sister-in-law last year had lost her baby due to complications with pregnancy, and the husky I had since he was a puppy had to be put down. 
---
This is of course not to compare experiences, but rather, everyone has bad things happen to them, everyone losses loved ones.  
---
I can understand some things - like how they gave the terminally ill kid a chance to play FO76 before he died, or how Evan was added to Nuka-World, but I think it has to come from the developer.  You can't start a campaign ASKING for inclusion, especially not a social media campaign, because as you said it puts them in a bad spot.  It becomes a no win scenario - if they do it for one fan, then why can't they do it for others, if they don't do it, they are the bad guy. 
---
So I agree - it's not fair to put Bethesda (or any developer) in the position to respond to tragedy like that.
---
Tyvm for your reply! Truly appreciate the effort of dev team making the game greater.
---
This is the spell check police. You forgot a letter e unless is by slang for something else these days? Also dear god that's one hell of a mutated smile.
---
I know thats why I think minigun should get a buff. Anyways I traded my BFSS grog axe for the minigun to try it out I like the minigun but it isn't as powerful as my melee build.
---
Nvr heard or seen anything about this
---
There are quite a few.  Many of the tapes in the very beginning of the game are pretty intense.  Course language abounds in about half of them.
---
Hive Mind of Reddit.
---
Uhhh no. Not a scam. For it to be a scam, objectively speaking, the game would have to be unenjoyable for the majority of the community. If it was unenjoyable for the majority of the community, bethesda would not be turning a profit. If Bethesda wasn't turning a profit, the game would have shut down ages ago. common sense.  
---
 I personally love playing the game with friends, and have logged quite a few hours in it. I can see why folks would hate the game if they're antisocial nobodies with no friends though - after all it's an online game geared towards co-op play. As with any co-op game, things get stale playing alone. But as far as the game being a scam? nonsense. You get hundreds of hours of playtime easily for 60 bucks (less than that now) and all future expansions are free.   
---
You're just being ridiculous.
---
I don't have adrenal and nerdrage yet. Just normal heavy perks and Chems. But with those two perks I could probably pull off 120 damage a hit at best.
---
‚Äú...Also, none of those examples are in any way, shape, or form, related to the probability of getting an item drop in a shitty MMO...‚Äù
---
Aaaaaand, scene. 
---
That‚Äôs a wrap kids. Thanks for proving my point.
---
Don't bite the hand that feeds you but that quote never mentioned what to do to hands that don't feed the company. Guess its ignore them and punish them till they open up their wallets.
---
Counter point...if it WASN'T for the scrap bin how many players would have subscribed?
---
Like a lot of people have said  , the atoms travel tent and private servers are really not that big of a deal so IMO the scrap bin is the selling point
---
You just have to take your time and enjoy it. 60hrs in, im still on my 1st playthrough.
---
If you sleep for a day, outdoor mobs will respawn; so its worthwhile to revisit locations.
---
I had a feeling I was misspelling it. Phone auto-correct wasn't giving me the correct spelling for it either.
---
I am sitting on 4900 atoms that were free so I know a way I can get those items. But I don't want to purchase them with atoms whether free or paid as I don't want to send the wrong message that we are willing to pay for utility items.
---
Hmm. You might want to try going tri barrel with low health. You really need higher damage per shot to penetrate that DR. Minigun with full health build don't sound too efficient
---
Except you wont destroy someone from a mile away with any of those weapons, but it's still instant death from unlimited range with a legacy laser rifle. If you can see them, they're dead.
---
Just collect absolutely everything and sell it. You can get around 1200 caps everyday from the bot vendors. If you do that as a "morning daily routine" you will earn caps and lose your soul very fast!
---
It all depends on your setup. I made over 50k caps yesterday, and spent 30k. I like to vend,  so I scavenge the waste land for wares to hock at my camp. Takes a little while to get going, once you do it's easy street after that.
---
Just use the generic 'spice' item since it's not really identified what spice it is.
---
They did a bad work then, it only pushed people further away from this mess and into The Outer Worlds thats just marvelous.
---
Camp system just needs an overhaul completely. Personally want less restrictions as I'm tired of it showing green and still won't let me place it.
---
I got a much better idea, screw the radtoad egg, screw the frog eggs, screw the mirelurk eggs, screw the mothman eggs, screw getting deathclaw eggs, and screw trying to find radscorpion eggs! 
---
Give us Rad-Chicken Coups. We'd use corn when making it like how we use razor grain for the brahmin. It would produce eggs that would be used for the updated recipes. I mean seriously! Most of the eggs in game look unappetizing as all hell! I'd much rather deal with radchickens. Also instead of ginseng root i'd say just spice in general, given that ginseng can be annoying to hunt down.
---
It's intentional.
---
In a single player game, you don't have to worry about any sort of economy or money sink, there is no interaction with the player and anyone else. 
---
There is an infinite supply of resources in this game.  You log out, and later stuff respawns.  Vendors have infinite money (not all in one day, but over time).  This creates a scenario where money will just continue to inflate...as it is there are multiple players that have max caps across multiple toons.
---
YOU WHAT!
---
Yea I sounds about right. I don't have tri barrel unlocked, but I'm not really worried about it. I'll unlock those perks eventually.
---
It's all good this kid is clearly going through something lmao. We owe him a thanks for feeding the beast what a laugh
---
Excellent response. Couldn't agree more üëçüëç
---
I agree, fasnatch and this are my favourite events
---
Not as far as I'm aware, I've got rank 3 and it's removed 75% of negative effects
---
Yes and that is how the majority of my crew use it for. They put one down at whitesprings and another at Vault 94 when we do raids so we can get in and out. I'm getting the consensus that most people are not happy about the scrapbox being paid for.
---
If they add any collectable junk it should only scrap to cork so it never accidentally gets used in crafting and it should be ultralight weight. No thank you to interesting items like ornamental vases that weigh 10.0 pounds each.
---
Did the main quest part where you had to befriend a deathclaw...didn‚Äôt work and I actually thought it would by clicking the prompt...got mauled like a fucking dumbass
---
There are many viable ways to make caps. My favorite is to run supermutant-heavy areas and sell their weapons. Harper's Ferry is great for that. Many supermutants or at least scorched that have some weaponry too. And the vendor is right in the area so it doesn't even matter if the looting puts you over weight limit. My second favorite spot for farming weapons is north of Whitesprings. I start at the train yard, clear it out, go north along the tracks (usually more supermutants), kill the Sentry Bot on the highway and then go south along the highway. The highway goes soon under a bridge where there are more muties or scorched (or both) and then go to the waste disposal location just right next to WS. If I'm in the mood I go check WS houses for ghoul legendaries... and then end at the WS train station to sell everything.
---
Don't forget to pick Glowing Meat from any glowing creature. It sells quite well. Basically any non-basic meat that is coocked sells reasonably well. You'll end up with some meat doing nearly anything, so don't let it spoil and cook it.
---
Bulk junk sells also nice. Just tag Plastic (needed for bulking), Gears, Springs and some other profitable material and loot the related junk.
---
And don't forget to use Grape Mentats and + Charisma Alcohol when selling item (or buying something). If you have the plan for GM and Mentats, then it's not difficult to get the material for the craft. With Super Duper perk and Chemist perk, you end up with a lot of GMs. If you don't have the plan, some players sell the GMs quite cheap. Even when bought for something like 40, it's worth it when you manage to sell for 1400 in one batch...
---
You‚Äôve changed your rationale substantially since this thread started.  So it‚Äôs not because space has radiation but because of the proliferation of nuclear power in the canon? Either way it‚Äôs a space suit. It‚Äôs designed for space in that canon - hence the name. It‚Äôs not designed for the earth. Regardless of what has happened in the FO universe with nuclear power the suit is still meant for short (hours) walks in space and therefore would be optimized for that purpose. 
---
Honestly by your argument  ‚ÄúNormal clothes‚Äù  would offer more rad protection than a spacesuit in the FO universe since they are used on earth.
---
Was that 800+ hours solely of gameplay, and if so is it not including loading times, server crashes, laggy/rubberband, and other sources that increase your time played but not let you play?
---
When calculating your cents/hour did you included the money you spent on atoms and 1st membership? Technically you should only include the script cost over the time you use it, but that is a lot of work for little change so, meh.
---
And last, and probably most inporant, are all of those hours you logged of an enjoyment and satisfaction level you are confortable paying for. 
---
Once all that is considered I'm sure the cent/hour rate will go up, though whether or not it is still worth it is entirely up to you.
---
i dont have the actual piece myself, it was at another players camp
---
It‚Äôs free for me today for some reason
---
Man, we need something like that in Brazil, I am jealous of you australians now. I convinced two friends to buy this mess with me, one got a refund the other is still mad at me. In 30 years of gaming this is this the biggest scam I suffered (along with Indiana Jones back in 1991 for Master System console). I am so glad we got The Outer Worlds, game is amazing. Would be great if Bethesda would admit they failed with the franchise and sold it to Obisidian so we could get a decent Fallout game again.
---
I'm looking for one  Plan: Pumpkin Rack, the empty one. I have minimun one of the other plans from the event, including the alien blaster, or caps to buy one. 
---
If someone is interested, please add me: MrNabo
---
Just like IRL, giving him /everything/ does not teach much of anything except dependence  and entitlement.
---
I get that he probably wants to fight the same cool critters dad fights; you know his L5 character is not ready.
---
Your role is to play guardian angel and adviser, with a good dose tour guide.  
---
Give him his lead to roam, but advise against going to areas you know he's not ready for. If he insists, sure, save him when he gets overwhelmed.
---
  Steer him to the questlines you know he needs to complete, lead him to locations where he might find useful stuff.  Yea, you can make him a BoS L5 rifle and turn over a supply of 308, but if you lead him to some rooftops where he can find his own sniper rifle...
---
Save him when he gets overwhelmed.  In the process, teach lore (and game mechanics.).
---
Lol, thats another reason to get a refund. Never risking getting in this mess again.
---
wow great luck on the pirate suit, would you be willing to trade or sell one if you are on Ps4?
---
&gt; People love to bitch.
---
Well played. your post is a perfect example of that .
---
Man that sucks. People can be suck complete ass trolls.  I like to imagine that in cases like that it wasn't you, that person had a REALLY bad day.  They got in trouble at work for something halfway their fault, they had to sit in 90 minutes of traffic and almost hit a car because they were distracted on their phone, finally they pull in to pick up groceries only to realize they left their wallet at work.  23 miles away.  So they had to eat leftover spaghetti that wasn't good the first time.  Again.  Then they discover that their 14 yr old didn't walk the dog like they were supposed and the dog shit everywhere.  Finally they check their bank account (doesn't matter he can't buy anything his wallet is at work) to find they double charged his car payment and he has $11 left.  Then he logs in and sees your camp.
---
BTW- it wasn't me.  But I have been that guy in the past.
---
I probably worded that badly (I was rushing off to a very important meeting about web pages &gt;.&lt; ).  What I was trying to express was that having (or not having) the benefits in question shouldn't change the gameplay - the details of the game and how you play it shouldn't change by subscribing.
---
A second free fast travel is a gameplay change.  Unlimited junk is a gameplay change.  The color of your dress or the wallpaper on our camp don't change any of the game mechanics.  That's where I would really prefer to draw the line.  I get that some of those might come with a cost (which I don't like, but I understand), but they shouldn't be withheld because you don't pay a subscription.
---
I'm pretty sure every component of this game results in fractions once modifiers are calculated (damage enhancement/reduction, chance to "X", etc.)
---
I've heard of visual bugs in instances like this, but the game engine itself shouldn't have an issue with fractions (it's just a floating point number). I run Class Freak 3 on most of my toons and have not observed any issues that I'm aware of, but who knows...
---
Someone datamined the Game and said it doesn't stack at all. Apparently it works like water breathing. It is just a one time effect
---
Shit happens but the World doesn't revolve around you buddy.
---
That still doesn't make it okay for you to bully or harass the people that are paying for and/or enjoying the game because you don't like the developer.  
---
If you want to boycott Bethesda products then never buy another one of their products again.  Don't punish other players because you're so immature and arrogant to think you know what's best for them.
---
Your attitude is making me want to buy a subscription to FO76 just in spite.
---
There should me more ‚ÄúNights‚Äù events or silly day events that happen only on a single day each month. 
---
One Violent Night also comes to mind of a template to copy and ‚Äòfork‚Äô
---
Yeah it shoukd have come out as a fulltime BETA until minimum january, but as long as neccesary, just focus on fixing bugs for the entire beta time then when it was in a release state release it then
---
Just more reasons why we need text chat in the game. It should have been in from the start. Sure voice is nice and in groups it's better, but there are a lot of reasons why someone doesn't want to or can't use voice chat.
---
Join the club. I've been going on about this one for a while. It's getting so damn old getting killed because my weapon will not fire when its suppose to.
---
We have "spices" which they use as a generalized cover for various spices.
---
I can agree with that. If the gameplay does not change for everyone than no gameplay change should happen.
---
For real they‚Äôve been doing this for decades and they still have the same bugs from fucking Morrowind. It‚Äôs like they haven‚Äôt learned a single new thing in all that time.
---
The guys an idiot fo1st defender. Just move on and let him eat chalk.
---
I've sold around 15. So at 500 they sell ok. Right now, the one in my machine is at 666 and hasn't sold for a couple weeks. I just bought 2 yesterday for 20 each. Probably gonna drop it to 400 today.
---
Earning Caps is something you get better at. You aren't limited to 1400 from Vendors each day. You earn Caps from Quests/Events and most importantly from Player Vending. Research the type of things people want to buy and don't pad your machines. Do research in to pricing and make your prices competitive. I make between 5-10k from Vending each day. Basically don't sell crap, sell cheap and you will sell fast. Caps become a farmable resource and with enough knowledge you will be begging for places to spend them. I spend all of my Caps on Plastic, Lead and Gamma Rounds currently
---
What was that? Must have been the wind....
---
I'm in for emotes, even for new emotes you can buy. The only new emotes have been fallout 1st ones and the raider one lately.
---
I and a few of my friends have built movable large camps, it‚Äôs a nightmare but with trail and error it will work. I did the Brahmn launcher and one of my friends has a town he moves around constantly, it‚Äôs a bodega, house, garage, and two guard towers. It‚Äôs all trial and error and a few will stop working. We don‚Äôt use the blueprint system at all, just build, move, and use the automatic blueprint the game makes. Some items won‚Äôt work, if a Brahmn dies and you store the camp it will stop working and balloons seem to cause problems but it is possible. Good luck!
---
I got meet russian women lol.
---
^^^^^^THIS GUYS GOING PLACES
---
I second this. It's so stupid having it in the pool if it doesn't work at all. I've gotten some decent guns that would have worked well with this, but nope
---
I mean, rather that than "I'm playing a game, ma! I'll take out the trash later!"
---
No.
---
Plus this would give you the feel of running a full farm. Cows, chickens, and grain
---
Yes, I will agree with you it was a major selling point. I also believe a decent amount of people would argue that is a reason why they didn't purchase it. I was all for private servers but I think the scrapbox should not have been included with that. Since Day 1 everybody wanted more stash space. Why put it behind a paid service? Yes to make money. I just feel like it's a low blow.
---
Can you link me to that datamining information? I have a whole set of unyielding/\*/better sneak and if it indeed doesn't stack, I could replace remaining 4 pieces with something else.
---
The private world by itself is worth it in my opinion. Not having to deal with other players  when you nuke whitesprings - that alone makes it worthwhile.
---
what challenge was worth 400 atoms? most daily challenges are 10-20 atoms
---
"I don't want to get something for free because I don't want to send the message that we are willing to pay for utility items".
---
Its probably because most people with fallout 1st are in the game and not on this sub, saddly. Even looking at these numbers, it doesn't make sense to me on how I'll  server hop, and a huge majority of the server is all fallout 1st members
---
Yea bloodied is a whole build with a lot synergy you cant compare a specific tailored build with just a weapon type. It gets even harder comparing numbers when bloodied just increases damage which is easy to see increase and something like anti-armor makes the target softer which is harder to see on paper
---
Now see, THIS RIGHT HERE is how to disagree with someone and not get a rude response. Thanks for this.
---
All your points are entirely valid, and yes, I'd say I'd need to cut the total number down in order to get a more accurate picture of how much I spent per *enjoyable* hour playing this game.
---
I've spent not a single dime since purchase, bought not one atom, have no 1st subscription, so I'm not adding any cost to the equation there.
---
I'd also need to add in things which are impossible to calculate - 'this game has brought my fiancee and I lots of enjoyment because we finally have a game we can play together which we both like to play" is a difficult concept to price.
---
Overall I think I've more than gotten value out of my purchase price. At the same time, it would piss me off if a game I paid that price for *understanding the content would be there for years to come* suddenly stopped running at all because nobody paid the power bill at Bethesda, so to speak.
---
Memorialize my deceased infant in this game about post nuclear-war horror and gore... seems like a good idea.
---
We all been there. Eventually you learn petting things in the wasteland doesn't end well.
---
Teach him to be good. Help him understand the best builds and why they are the best, but allow him to make his own choices in that regard. Help him understand the game mechanics - there's a lot of math and opportunity for learning there. Course, this requires you to know all of the mechanics too =).
---
Don't hand him the best armor / weapons. Let him farm for them himself. That's a huge part of the fun of this game. But if you find something in the course of playing with him, obviously hook him up =).
---
How?   
---
Please kind person. Explain to me how you did it. I tried to do it like the video showed and could not get it to do right no mater what. It looks great with the vendor machines and everything.
---
"We are investigating". Nothing needs investigating. It just needs fixing.
---
That's because there is no end game content. Holiday events give us something to do and the game just feels empty afterwards.
---
Yeah the private worlds are nice but it's the scrap bin that everyone wants
---
Thank you for the input!
---
I hear ya.  I‚Äôve got a handful of nice guns in my stash for when, if I get bored with me handmade commando build.  I keep some slugger perks for my sweet sledge when they get too close.
---
I just dont believe people would be as mad if they gave the scrapbox to everybody. I honestly don't need it. I manage my scrap easily without it. When you put way too many hours into a game you learn how to do that. I'm just trying to get everybody's opinion on the matter and throw mine out there.
---
There are decorations, but they‚Äôre less common than Christmas or Halloween decorations, mainly fall foliage arrangements and cornucopia.
---
There are parades on thanksgiving day, American football games. 
---
Dinner usually is the meal, but it comes early with roast turkey, turkey gravy, stuffing/dressing, mashed potatoes, green been casserole, sweet potatoes (referred to as yams erroneously), cranberry relish or sauce, bread. Dessert of pies including pumpkin, pecan, apple, cherry, etc.
---
Scrappy Metal Walls. Got it. I was doing the thicker Wood Walls. We will try again.   
---
Thank you.
---
Now I feel dumb, I sold mine for 25 caps in my vending machine and it got snapped up.
---
Equip the weapon and the Damage will update.
---
 will also take any good executioner guns and melee. also looking for assassins sent armor wich is what the guy was supposed to give me
---
Would you consider me having my afk alt account in my group as "group" or solo? I use him to share  SiN, adrenaline rank 5, etc. He was expressly built to be an afk mule / give perks / buffs.
---
Your right about that bloodied does increase overall damage but doing the math bloodied will still end up doing more damage in the end. With every perk you can possibly use AAE is pretty good. But once Chems and bobbleheads come into play its pretty much over. The amount of more damage you can do with Chems is about 80 percent more in total.
---
haha, yeah they‚Äôre expensive! i just got an extra out of the forbidden knowledge quest.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for those elemental Arrows üëÄ
---
Hmm I wonder if the Fixers sneak effect works with it then. Speed bonuses are like that, you just get the highest one..
---
Since the scrap box I'm able to put some good stuff up for sale rather than being forced to scrip or sell it to vendors
---
The miniguns damage isnt the issue with it in my opinion.  It's how long it takes to start firing.  Same issue I have with the gatling plasma and the gatling laser.  In a video game environment (not rl) those seconds are agonizing before it starts shooting and if you're playing with others the mob is already dead half the time before you even get a shot off.  Couple that in with the fact every single mob in the damned game has a stagger effect (brilliant design Beth, no really, top notch I've never played a video game before decision) and the gun sucks hard.  I have literally been staggered to death from full health without ever firing a bullet. With my 50 cals even if I do get staggered I'm instantly back in the action.
---
If your son is 12 just take it casual. Just give him his basic workshops and show him the ropes on where to go and what to do. My kids aren't interested in trying so I don't push it.
---
Leather coat is 30k???? I got one yesterday doing an event in the mire.
---
idk if this is the case, but does the scrap box hold unscrapped junk?  or bottom level scrap exclusively?  I assume its the latter, im just not positive
---
But without the intelligence bonus...
---
Direct quote from u/jaj22 in the thread; 
---
'Master thread for the dataminer AMA Oct 13th 12:30pm    
---
"Legendary Sneak Armor: +5 Mod Detection Movement, +15 Mod Detection Sneak Skill. Does not stack for multiple pieces, which is probably a bug." (I'm not fluent in formatting so I copy pasted the info)
---
I sold mine about a month ago for 1000 caps. Big and useless to me anyways
---
This was solved on Nexusmods a while ago and a few other modder players have made similar alternative fixes that seem to work well. 
---
It‚Äôs not unsolvable and seems like it could be fixed with a crude yet relatively simple adjustment to the freezing script
---
Yeah don't get me wrong, the bin is insane. We have wanted unlimited scrap storage for ages. Its the only reason that I came back to play at all after a few months haiatus.
---
I mean I gave you a handful of guns that will overcome me if you're in range but if the way you PvP is standing out in the open miles away with no cover then I guess maybe it's your bad? You're not going to win in PvP if you're trying to use your PvE gear, basically no matter what. I sacrifice my PvE playstyle for PvP. Assassins Armor, and tank perks serve literally no purpose for when I'm farming junk and legendaries. If you like junk reduction, ammo reduction, and food reduction armor that's great but don't be mad it's not good enough for PvP. You have a much easier time farming than I do, I have a much easier time takin that junk from you.
---
I am actually going to be offering a pumpkin service next Halloween. Starting October 1, 2020, players will be able to come to my camp, pick out which type of pumpkins they want, and for a cap or two a piece I'll go set them up in their camps. I still wish I got that empty pumpkin rack, but what can you do.

A delay doesn't necessarily mean it won't be turd, mind you. Not with this game, not with this Bethesda. I'd like to give them the benefit of doubt, but after 1st, I can't in good faith...
---
Another question: Do you consider using a manual firing macro with a gatling gun to be an exploit? FWIW, a primed BE gatling gun using a firing macro to shoot at 5 shots per second is roughly equal in dps to a primed BFFR .50 cal.
---
I'm not sure either.  I refuse to subscribe to find out.
---
Yeah and i agree. Should have been if not free then available to everyone at least. If Bathesda gave a crap about PR it would have been. Its like they dont know that the first hit is supposed to be free. And while i subbed to fallout first and am currently contributing to the delinquency of videogames i think its the first good value from this game. I dont have the fridge or robot because its ridiculously overpriced. To me, 1st is not. To others its like bathesda slapped they momma. People can stomp their feet and angry type all they want but nothing is free. Ever. This game still needs alot of work. I really hope they right the ship. But they're not going to do it for free. Im sure there is at least one person at bathesda going "uh guys, this is a bad move". They really need to start listening to them. But i think at this point they realize that they are not going to get favorable coverage no matter they do. Hell Angry Joe is still screaming at his camera using day 1 footage. So i guess they're just gonna go for broke.
---
they absolutely will.
---
they'll bring their overstocked camps, and overstocked storages into the vanilla worlds.  
---
"you dont want crashes? get fallout 1st" -Beth
---
seconded, nothing more infuriating than fighting someone if nw and you gotta stand there with your dick in your hand spinning barrels
---
It used to be pretty wonky, some negative effects weren't reduced at all. Only issue I know of right now though is speed demons food and drink usage doesn't get reduced. But it seems they fixed everything else. I did read something about empath not working right, but I dunno if it's due to class freak rank, I don't use empath anyway. I use rank 3 on all my characters
---
U got a TE handmade, AAE handmade or AAE 50 cal?
---
That is group, because you are getting shared group perks.
---
Now that you mention it, I'd love to actually see GROUP speed runs, too! Almost treat them like the raids in actually having a team set up... one guy hacks, one guy picks, one guy has mainframe cores, etc.
---
That control room is going to be super fun with spawns, too.
---
Also, I've found that a server without turrets usually ends up having more lag in the mainframe cores, and laser grids.  Usually the big indicator if the run isn't going to be the best time is the initial medical scan.
---
My best PA time is 10:03, IIRC. Also - a good trick if you run dodgy, put kinetic dynamo on your chest, so you can restore AP when hit!
---
Do you think maybe a flaw in the atom shop is a reason more people have not purchased atoms? More unique items or skins could have helped. I personally believe it starts with the game stability. More people are willing to support the game if it runs and plays good.
---
I thought it was gonna be great when they removed it for the simple reason that I played survival strictly, and farming ghouls in white springs shouldn't get you #1 most wanted within 10 mins. I was sad when they did cause I couldn't find anyone after that and I think that was truly the final nail in its coffin.
---
Someone has the Plan: Pumpkin rack half empty
---
Sorry it's my go to pessimist joke.
---
But seriously I'm hoping for the best if they can't deliver on this after a 5 month delay then the future of 76 is bleak.
---
its a pathetic cash grab for a game that hasn‚Äôt added content for 8 months and had little to no end game content to begin with
---
&gt; using it means you can't place your camp in pubic worlds anymore
---
zero chance this will be accurate.
---
the fallout 1st people, will absolutely be able to bring their camps, over budgeted, into the regular worlds.
---
most likely they wont be able to *add* above the standard limit in a vanilla world, but their overbudget camp will definitely be allowed to bog down the servers for the non-players
---
ONLY bird-like creature!? Radchickens! Hello! Seriously, just double their size and blame it on those experimental growth hormones at the project paradise facility. Also on top of that why not have some super mutants, maybe friends of Grahm, show up with him and they could be using (American) footballs instead of mini-nukes. Wouldn't be about killing them, more of playing some type of tag football with them.
---
No, I think they need do make the stabilized card not require power armor though
---
 I know theres a few people methodical enough to conduct legit controlled testing of game mechanics but for the most part people posting about all this are just going off feelings and seeing your damage on paper shoot up irregardless of what you'll be shooting at feels better then...well my damage looks okish but with perks and legendary effects I'll be stripping X% of armor off my target doing possibly just as goodish damage
---
Which leads to the problem of today's game vs tomorrow's game. Today bloodied may out perform but if you nerf it down to a lower level then what happens tomorrow when an xpac drops with higher armored enemies? AA is laughing as it melts things at pre-nerfed bloodied levels while post nerfed bloodied is dying every other fight struggling with it's new spit ball shooting status
---
I personally feel like a low health build should be a glass cannon.high dps low survivability...if anything needs buffed its poor berserkers. Let your full health full armored guys do ok damage and have a fat health bar between you and a respawn
---
I forgot about those chickens I've only seen them a few times.
---
like, i want to assume that its *SCRAP* only, and not unscrapped junk, because that would make more sense.  but this *IS* Beth we're talking about here.
---
I'd say take the newest blue wallpaper, remove the rockets, make it a nice evergreen color, have wooden paneling on it up about waist or gut level. Would look nice for a billiards room.
---
I've had things happen like this to me too.  I like to hop to a different world so they fall to their doom.  Like free therapy.
---
I'd say let him go. A little duping would do the economy good
---
I say everyone should be given it, I'm not against that as a 1st Member.
---
But it should be limited to 800lb for the free version and infinite for the 1st Members, that way everyone wins and the scrapbox is no longer a only member item.
---
Personally, I've never witnessed a legenedary spawn and die so quickly that it didn't become a legendary. Someone would have to kill it within a few seconds of spawning for that to happen, I suppose. However, I have actually witnessed the Mischief Night event close with the final boss which did not become a legendary at all... and roamed around the area for several minutes firing on people. I did personally witnessed it spawn and not become a legendary. Perhaps it was glitched or perhaps Bethesda set up the possibility for that event's final boss to not become a legendary. It would be hard to know which of the two scenarios actually occurred for the Mischief Night event. Perhaps the event you saw was actually one of the rare times when it didn't actually spawn a legendary?
---
No. Why? Just enjoy the game, don‚Äôt snitch for no reason.
---
Is going on for months for me. Sometimes scaring the living crap out of me when sneaking around and it drops right infront of me.
---
It was likely lag
---
All I'm seeing are great ideas here! Egg nog, hard egg nog, chicken coop- awesome. Fall is a harder one to add items to, but maybe have a decor table that is already simple and "set" with some fallout thankgiving food and plates.
---
I usually sell them for 500 as well, it seems to be a good sweet spot.
---
Yesterday during a NW match some guy was asking why his girl had her pants on when he, and I quote, "gonna eat that ass after this match"
---
Despite the immature crowd, I hope they do add her in. There's a small cemetary along the northern fence of morgantown airport. Anything to help a grieving father. I don't understand what's wrong with you assholes, this man is clearly looking for a way to cope and needs personal closure. I'm not sure if I would ask the same but I think OP needs some in real life friends to reach out to him and maybe help memoralize his child in real life ways like starting a garden in the name of the child or a charity. I hope you are listening OP. I'll add you in game if you play xbox
---
I semi-agree I guess. There's plenty of ways to avoid getting VATsed. Chameleon armor, stealthy boys (which I think need rework for sure,) Simply hiding behind things and being out of range. If you dip behind a wall it'll cut VATs off, but it can be a crutch for sure.
---
I stand around and pick up as many as I can and sell them. Easiest 1400 caps I ever made
---
If he was a Fallout 1st member, let him be.
---
Don‚Äôt get married to a mistake because you spent a lot of time making it. Things don‚Äôt get better like that.
---
Snitching is a word for pussies. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with informing someone of wrong or illegal activity, in this case a cheater.
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
The tent can block a players base from spawning in, it should get relocated or something so a players ONLY camp can appear on the server.
---
If you have the right perks and level and pacify it Rose has some surprised conversation when sees you do it.
---
Game's broken anyways. Also I used to care about duping but with this FO 1st crap I'd say go on. Dupe like you've never duped before. Destroy the economics.
---
Her damage resistance doesn't change. It's always the same. The only thing that changes is your weapon's damage fall-off range. So if she's further away, you do less damage. If she's closer, you do more damage.
---
Bomber jacket and the science scribe outfits sell in less than an hour from my machines for 500caps all day long.  That's why I love getting them, guaranteed quick turnaround for a decent amount at .1 storage weight.  Only thing that sells better (for me) are liquor recipes and mr fuzzy tokens.
---
It was awesome!  I had a full set of ts armor and had fun killing those assaultrons!
---
All these people complaining about Bethesda.... Move on they got your money already.... Your no longer needed here
---
But they already did in the Solucum Joe's so I'm hoping they let this happen least they could do
---
A bit powerful, should have all those 3 eggs.
---
Unless he is subscribed to fallout 1st. Dont ban those players. They waste money on this game for us healthy people to enjoy new content. No money, no bugfix eh eh?
---
You mean making the game work. Because it is not.
---
Hard Egg Nog/Fortified Egg Nog would be +3 Strength instead of the +1 Intelligence.
---
I guess we can use Spices.
---
Yeah, that is why I think we should be able to domesticate them with chicken coops (yes I just realized I was using the wrong spelling). Would also be nice to be able to use carrots and make rabbit cages as well. I mean look at titles like Metro. In Metro Exodus they kept rabbits and chickens for food as they were quick to reproduce and could provide additional goods.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice, but they‚Äôll probably make you pay for it
---
Don't try to tell people they've made a mistake when they clearly haven't, sunk cost fallacy doesn't work like that. If *you* don't believe something has value to you, and *I* believe that thing has value to me, guess what? Neither of us is incorrect! Isn't that wonderful?
---
The empty rack isn't obtainable in the game nor did it drop from the event. It is in the camp build menu but there was no way to get it.
---
The alien blaster plan is a bug and it's actually one of the jack o lantern plans. When they translated the plan names, something broke and that's what it was named. But when you learn it, it will only unlock a jack o lantern plan.
---
"i dont like the thing so nobody else is allowed to like the thing! Even if it improved since i tried it or they enjoy it for reasons different than me!"
---
Also, um. It's a VIDEO GAME. Comparing 76 to Nazis just makes you seem like an over-reacting asshole.
---
That's a good idea. Most of us are farmers.
---
See the part about you having a game you can play with your wife. That's a value you can't quantify and is almost always worth the purchase. I'm very glad you got to have that. (Hopefully you guys game share and got even more value from the purchase!)
---
I myself have my gf who adores the Fallout series and even with all the issues still plays it once or twice a month and enjoys it. I didn't. I stopped when I wasn't having fun. I propably would have gotten a Refund if not for the fact that we game share and she can still get value of it.
---
P.S. Thanks for the compliment about how to politely disagree. I never get why people have to be angry all the time over having different opinions. I dislike 76, a lot. Just the base game's restrictions and grind-ish mechanics are not to my liking. Add onto that the fact that they are selling in game benefits after promising they wouldn't, lack of QoL updates and care in general just makes it worse. It also makes me a little bit sad that people are buying atoms and 1st Subscriptions as I am sure it reinforces Bethesda Upper management of their practices. But in the end that's my opnion of the game and if other people can play it and have fun and enjoy it why should I rain on their parade, you know?
---
Really? That's so cool!
---
Or make it a drop from the next limited time event. Assuming they have one in time for the Holidays.
---
Except its free for 1st, not $5
---
And give all the buffs.
---
Well Hell yeah.  Bitching is one of my favorite things to do.  Almost up there with talking about my dog to people who are at best mildly interested.
---
The whole game needs an overhaul. And we got it. It is basically the same game, only we have to pay a monthly subscription for it.
---
I think this is one of those times where it costs us nothing to support but could mean the world to this guy. Loss of a child is no easy thing, and my upvote doesn't cost me anything or harm me. That said, I hope this post is legit, because I want to support it.
---
Yes.

About 9 months ago on PS4 I learned you can get the marine tactical helmet plans and easily make the 1400 caps daily that way. They cost very little to construct (1 glass, 1 plastic, and three rubber) and get you around 25-30c each. With super duper and hard bargain 3, you‚Äôll make that 1400c in no time each day. Need materials? Either farm them at common spots (watoga high school for plastic, grafton gym for rubber, etc) or but the junk from player vendors. 
---
I just switched to pc from ps4 recently and just two days ago got that plan at a much lower level than before. And it‚Äôs still the best way for me to make caps. With that and a still crappy player vending inventory, I made around 6.5k caps yesterday alone
---
Just because its broken doesnt give u the right to cheat or exploit
---
I use a BFFR handmade and it shreads
---
So you're trying to sell the actual weapon for 10k when you've saw the plans for 5k? You realize the plan is always worth more than the item, right? Seems like most people list the tenderizer for around $1k. No idea if anyone's buying at that price.
---
Didn‚Äôt even play it. Seemed like more lag and less fps while doing the same thing we always do, run around Whitesprings.
---
Yeah now I remember the other reason I stopped playing nuclear winter mode. That's what causes that bug. I had it happen last night when I accidentally clicked the wrong mode.
---
They didn't introduce a $5 private world only option, they went with one package with a ton of free QOL stuff that doesn't cost them anything so they can charge significantly more money. 
---
That fast travel camp could easily be a pioneer scout squirrel quest reward. But it's easier to just be lazy and throw it into a higher price subscription, the only subscription... It's not okay that it can block a players camp from spawning in either.
---
The scrap box just shows they are fucking liars. I don't want infinite scrap space and I don't care about more stash space, but others do, so if it's possible to not crash the server they should implement it for everyone else.
---
Outfits and emotes, who cares, immersion is gone with floating camps and underground camps and shit anyway
---
Had this issue come up when I went to use my anti armor explosive minigun.
---
" Mode wasn't popular so they ditched it. There was literally one half filled server on PC for all of survival mode. No other servers because no one played it. No one playing = not worth dev time. Go back to Rust. "    
---
I server hoped regularly on survival PS4 literally until the day they nerfed PvP and it was a different game.    
---
 "The pre nerf PvP meta was bullshit and you know it. One shot vats crit builds or teslas or GTFO. That, or use cheats or exploits to give godmode. "    
---
Due to the nerf Teslas are more popular than ever in PvP now. I rarely is ever remember seeing teslas before the nerf    
---
" LOL, you act like people earned their god tier pvp gear in survival. They did not. They farmed it in adventure or bought it on ebay or traded for it in adventure."     
---
Who fucking cares where they got it? That's not a point I was making at all. They got it for PvP and that's what they'll use it for regardless of adventure mode or not.     
---
" Sounds like you're just salty that your ebay bought duped gear isn't worth dick anymore. "     
---
Looking at ebay seems like it's worth roughly 150 dollars for my set of armor, if anyone happened to be selling it. What is your nocturnal food reduction armor worth?
---
proof?
---
12 year olds are world experts at swearing! Much as people might not wish to admit it.
---
I agree

Hahaha

I'm building a new camp about once a week, and I'm finding new tricks each time. Last night I figured out you can place a "cycling light" inside the left "locker" of the vendors to give it a custom look. You'll need a roof, or second story floor near the vendor  to do it. Start by placing a cycling light on a roof tile, and then connect it to your vendor power connector (these lights work like the one type of posters that need direct power even though it doesn't have a visible connector. Now exit build node and "activate" the light and cycle to your desired color. Now re-enter build mode, and you should be able to select that light and then be able to maneuver it into  the "locker" portion. Just fiddle with the sticks until you see green!
---
Beware that you will no longer be able to select or access that light once it has been placed. The only way to "undo" this is to move store the vendor or move camps.
---
The purpose of games like Fallout is to provide an immersive escape from reality. While the death of a child is a tragedy beyond compare,the original author's request on this platform is inappropriate.
---
Fallout 76 turned out to be one of the biggest scams I‚Äôve seen in the gaming industry. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you like it or not, it is still a scam.
---
DCG only way I know how
---
A few days ago I posted a story of how I have utilized my FO1st membership. The posting was quite controversial, but I also posted it right around the time of the debut of the service, so toxicity was high. 
---
The meat of my post was that I decided to help out a couple of low level players that had requested some help on Reddit. They were both in their 20‚Äôs as far as level. Personally, I‚Äôm 368 I think, with about 1150 hours in game. 
---
Utilizing a private server, I launched a nuke on WS and basically was hands off. Letting them get the glowing ones without my assistance other then getting them to spawn and risking them up a bit so they‚Äôd go after the n00bs. 
---
One of the guys died well over 10-15x, but he didn‚Äôt give up. One other guy shadowed me while I launched the nuke but I intentionally let him fight all the bots. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt going to let them just have me to all the work and them getting one bullet in so they can reap the rewards. Didn‚Äôt do that with my kids and I‚Äôm certainly not doing it for n00bs. I provide the venue, the instruction, and some free advice, and simply ask them to pay it forward when they are high level, which they will be able to achieve on their own because they learned how to grind. Not how to beg for handouts. 
---
Don‚Äôt give him a fish. Teach him how to fish. Even if he needs to drown a few times. Ok, enough with the clich√©d metaphors. It‚Äôs a fucking video game. Who cares? 
---
Have fun.
---
the proof is in the downvotes friend
---
The winter event last year was Fastnacht, which is a German Carnival or Mardi Gras type celebration.
---
Christmas decorations were available, but I would not expect a Christmas seasonal event.
---
No. Only more useless crap in the shop.
---
What kinda dog?
---
Sorry what does DCG stand for?
---
My main issue with you is that you push so much hate in your initial post towards what you call "food builds" and blame them for all your woes. That's why I came off so harsh. I'm not a food build - I'm fully optimized for doing max dps in PvE. I wrote the guide on how to min/max for solo pve. I also have a fully optimized pvp character and I've done quite a bit of pvp. You're assuming that I just know nothing about pvp. That is not true at all. There's simply no point in playing on survival mode as it was unless you go there for the express purpose of ganking, and that, to me, was only fun for about a day or two. Not because I was dying all the time, but because it was so poorly balanced, and it came down to who saw who first. There wasn't any skill involved. My issue is not "oh geez those nasty pvpers are impossible to beat". My issue is that the game mode just sucked. The balance was awful. Even at the highest levels, it came down to who saw who first, and the person that got first shot won, every time. I can't do any normal activities that I'd do in adventure mode on survival. I can't nuke whitesprings and farm ghouls for legendaries. SBQ? lol. On top of that, I've met multiple people using exploits to give themselves godmode. And that's just the in game exploits. On top of that there are blatant cheaters using AA, wallhack, godmdoe, teleporting underground, etc. Most of them moved to NW, but some still exist on survival.
---
I've also put a lot of time into Rend, a game that is a lot like Rust or similar games. I'm no newbie to pvp based survival games. IF they wanted to do a proper open world pvp mode for this game, they should remove all legendary effects, period. Force everyone to make brand new characters. If you die, you lose everything on you. Buff up player walls and such and add different tiers, add proper siege type weapons and allow stash looting. Make it a proper survival game. Not this watered down crap where everyone brings over their godly pve earned crap.
---
Heavy weapon spin ups broken for 4 months.
---
Fallout 1st has all bugs fixed in a week.
---
I see where you coming from, but unfortunately it sounds pretty ignorant, because Bethesda already did this multiple times already, and it's not narcissistic in anyway, we have empathy even for people who don't know, like Justin Cole, Erik West, Evan Miller and u/NoohjXLVII's brother Evan. who all has been immortalize in previous and current Bethesda games, and some of them are there because we asked.
---
So I kindly ask you to up-vote this anyway and let Bethesda do the deciding.
---
sorry Death Claw Gauntlet
---
With 12 Years i already played GTA and several Horror Games with a concious mind of a 18 yrs old. I knew what i play and that made it even more fun. If your son can handle that, he will play this casual game like a pro e sports player lol.
---
There is no reason to coddle a future gamer, dont be scared to spoil your child in that relationship xD seriously thats super weird for a 12 years old. I dunno your son, but i would be pretty annoyed beeing watched like that, getting parental advises for the future while playing games. Just enjoy the time you have with your son, that is the most valuable lesson.
---
"Hey guys! I'm a broke bitch so don't play this game!!!"
---
I use a TSE lever, AAE lever, and Instigating sniper rifle to full effect. Was hitting for 1500 dmg in sneak mode last night.
---
Ahh ok gotcha
---
im currently running a bloodied sneak commando with a be handmade and an instigating pump shotty. wearing full chameleon armor with nothing else good on the armor and max sneak and escape artist as the main perks for sneaking. Bloodied for that really high damage and sneaking helps me last longer. got explosive on the handmade so i not only have the little bit of extra damage but also find enemies around corners.  the shotgun is instigating with 10% aim damage and reduced weight. use the handmade for long range encounters and shotgun for close up and to save some 556 ammo. do use vats on the handmade but not that often mostly when im dealing with a crowd or big enemy like scorchbeast. in terms of sneaking im able to sneak right in front of enemies and will only get noticed when im right in front of them and try sneaking into them. could sneak past everything if i wanted but tbh its kinda boring at times going from place to place one shotting most things and barely getting seen.
---
Maybe, it is hard to tell without access to sales data. I do suspect the percentage of players willing to spend real money only to support the game (rather than because they want the items for themselves) is low in any case, and it is easy enough to spend only the atoms earned with gameplay.
---
Where would I find these plans?
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I have upvotes now. Maybe because what I said could have been construed as selfish, even though that‚Äôs not how it was meant to come across.
---
Yea I aware of the data mine :) I know to take the whole of with at least around 30 - 40 barrels of salt xD But if they do, I'm gunna abuse that scrap box :P
---
The problem is they limit bandwitdh to 100gb a month. I was getting more than that. Also, this will just host static pages, you cannot deploy a full application with backend and a database.
---
is you mean cards, my rtx 2060super runs it at 4k 40-60fps on a 55tv
---
I currently use a be handmade with some stealth and various other things and hit about for the same
---
He might have actually been a 1st member. He was a low level but had some rare gear. He was dipping though so that could he got it. He left the passageway way leaving the courtyard in whitesprings full of nuke mines. Thousands of them. He ran off when I saw what he was doing. I'd hate if some innocent player picked them up and got banned for it. I left them be.
---
You are literally paying more money into a game because it isn‚Äôt in a good state right now because you think that will be how it improves. That is the definition of sunk cost fallacy, and I understand if you have a hard time seeing it.
---
Yeah i invested in a troubleshooter set after getting embarrassingly owned by those assaultrons. Made it so much easier
---
He's a Saint Bernard and he's two years old and he hey wait a minute I see what you did there!
---
-2 Intelligence
---
This sounds exactly the way I run my build for the most part excluding the shottie even use a be handmade lol
---
black friday sale in the atom shop?
---
I see snitching in this case as unnecessarily telling on someone, especially when what they‚Äôre doing doesn‚Äôt effect you in any way. Dude, have you done that glitch? I have. The person doing it is doing nothing but wasting their time. If they‚Äôre trying to rank up fast, cool. It takes a long, loooong time doing it that way, they‚Äôre just wasting their time poorly imo. Don‚Äôt report for that, just do you and adventure elsewhere. If they‚Äôre using the exploit to get resources, who cares anymore. They‚Äôve put in unlimited scrap boxes so there is no standard on how much junk a player should have. I say let it go because reporting them would just be a waste of everyone‚Äôs time. Hell, debating it is a waste of my time. And I know the ‚Äúpure hearted‚Äù will always shut down ‚Äúexploits‚Äù, but there are varying types and this one doesn‚Äôt matter at all. It would be different if there were people using aim assist and flying in competitive modes like NW, we see how active bethesda is at actually stopping legit cheating...
---
no, bloodied build, nerd rage, endurance skill for strength from rads, unarmed mutation (something claw).
---
Also, you cannot stim while they're spinning down. I can't count how many times I've died to the spin down on my gatling plasma in the raids.
---
If I recall the name correctly New Havens Church in the Mire has some neat lore from the time when the Scorched first appeared.
---
Happened in FO4 with the guy‚Äôs brother who was unkillable
---
It's not about losing free stuff, it's that it's an expected gameplay feature that's not working. Not everyone cares about it, but it's really no different than people being upset about any other bug.
---
i have to admit those assaultrons were some of the toughest mobs in the game when they grouped up, like 4-5 assaultrons all chasing you is kinda terrifying
---
the only thing i am bothered by is the scrapbox, but i just work around it. a buddy of mine has the subscription and the only thing he actually cares about is the private server
---
Yeah I hated the point system and the removal of the people on the leaderbored. It just made finding interesting pvp content such a ballache.
---
Best times I had in the game was the killers on the map. Loved getting the top three status and building a workshop Fort or hunting each other through forests.
---
only picked up the shotty cause i could find a bloodied 10mm pistol lol but it does decent against most common enemies.
---
Source of this leak?
---
  Seriously y‚Äôall, if the guy is telling the truth about it, which seems he is, why is it a big deal? They could easily add a name to a grave in the game somewhere way too easily.
---
  While they are doing that they can fix some other bull crap that needs fixing, 
---
  AND why not GET RID OF SOME COMIC BOOK CARTOON COSTUMES AND BRING IN SOME APOCALYPTIC RUSTIC STYLE CONTENT FALLOUT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR?!

You're just dumber than rocks. You must not even know what dlc is. Show me where the fuck it says 1st includeds dlc or a season pass or fuck off.
---
Imagine ending a post with ‚Äúdiscuss.‚Äù
---
Im literally paying zero more money into a game I'm still enjoying. It would help the conversation along if you read for comprehension. I don't have a 1st subscription, and I've not purchased any atoms. So, you are entirely incorrect in your assessment of my personal situation, because you aren't paying attention to what I've already said.
---
You can't tell me or anyone else what to do. If you don't like the game don't play it. I'll do as I please.
---
Unpopular opinion: Biv is so fucking annoying
---
I found two there last night, and it was night time in the game
---
That's only if you mix it with MD2020 or Night Train. :P
---
I scrap them for steel üò¨

So. Much. Candy.

They missed an opportunity to add a new disease that you get from excessive candy consumption. I must have picked up and consumed thousands.

My dad should be memorialized for dying when I was a kid too! And my grandparents, and my aunts. I miss them all, so they deserve to be memorialized.

Come on, she didn't even develop a personality yet.
---
stimpacks and aid nah just help out.
---
take him to get the big items together. make him work for the scrap they need for whatever they are working towards.  it's ok to help out with the last 10 or whatever item needed.  always end on a high note.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
I can tell you are a noob because anyone with experience in the game gets their caps maxed all the fucking time.
---
Newborn daughter didn't even have a developed personality or a set of likes or dislikes.  This is an asshole thing to request.
---
I've tried to answer this question about 3 times in my head, and it's not easy. Good question.
---
My immediate thought is - YES - as you are using a 3rd party process to automate something... but, I think a normal gamer type person can click a mouse 5 times per second, but don't know if that translates that well to a macro (maybe, I'll try tonight).
---
That also brings out - would having Perk Loadout Manager be an exploit to swap the hack/pick cards?
---
I think we'd have to draw the line at - is it something Bethesda has put in, or has approved for use as a 3rd party? That also brings out - well what is a macro? Is it 3rd party? Yup.  Is it an addon that modifies game files? Nope.  do MANY modern controllers and keyboards have the ability to assign macros? Yup... so is it ACTUALLY an exploit? Then you have the question of when is a macro an exploit?
---
So... that's a really good question.
---
Here's what I found over at /r/speedrun (which is obviously talking about a bit of a different type of speedrun, but let's just go with that for now).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/21spiz/are_keyboard_macros_cheating/
---
Also from their link in that top response from a speedrunning site:
---
What's the deal with turbo-functions, glitch-abuse, cheat-codes, savestates, save-warping, scripts, and newgame+?
---
The rules for games are community-driven. Whatever people agree upon as the best way to play is what will be done. However here are some guidelines:
---
Turbo-functions
---
Not allowed when the official stock controller doesn't have this function. Turbo is unfair to those who don't have a third party controller with a turbo function.
---
Glitch-abuse
---
Allowed, but sometimes limited. One way to limit glitch abuse is to have certain rulesets or categories that have restrictions on what you can and cannot do. Generally glitches will be allowed, however. If you don't really understand why, then consider this: The game merely executes the code in the way it was programmed to do. The game is the law. If you start trying to get at "developer intentions," then you start a game of guesswork trying to figure out what exactly was intended or not.
---
So I'd say you would put that in it's own category.  I'd also say using Perk Loadout would put you in your own category, so I think that's fair (as it is technically "unsupported" by Bethesda officially).
---
But I'm not the authority (if there even is one).  Sorry for the long winded answer, it's a fun thought exercise!
---
My sneakiest sneaky ninja uses a bloodied hunting rifle (silenced), bloodied 10mm and executioner fast swing knuckles. Shadowed unyielding armor, ultralight when possible. Nothing explosive because it breaks immersion.
---
Yup, Harper's ferry is an easy place to hit your daily caps.  One run through should bout do it.
---
 *"We all paid for the base game and even that wasn't worth any money in my opinion "*
---
that is fine for you, but i've logged HUNDREDS of hours into this game, and thew world itself is brilliant, its a fallout world and ive loved exploring it
---
so your experience does not dictate the experience of others.  you did say it was your opinion though, so i respect that
---
You know I could understand if the rest of us got Fallout 76 for free and if we wanted to have ‚Äúspecial treatment‚Äù we can join FO 1st.... BUT WE ALL PAID THE SAME MONEY SO FIX IT FOR US!!
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for ATOMS I PURCHASED! I feel like I have been robbed... when you buy ATOMs or earn ATOMs hey should be available right away. 
---
Tired of your Shit Bethesda.
---
But we do have a campaign like this before...Note from Miller.
---
Heh.
---
When I do Uranium Fever I have two guns ready, a sharing gun and a one shot gun. I usually level the first wave of Mole miners and make it clear that I'll do the same to the legendaries if anyone pulls the one shot bs. Each time I've been ignored I've collected the next two legendaries. It's very, very hard to outdraw a bloodied vats build folks since after seeing it I only need hit Q, Mouse1 and it be dead. I don't like being a dick, but some people need lessons taught.
---
Oh give me a break. I don't need to be reminded of my grief through someone else's in a video game. Let alone a newborn who didn't even get the concept of games.
---
You make so many assumptions about me.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the\_bloodied\_heavy\_weapons\_tank\_an\_end\_game\_pve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the_bloodied_heavy_weapons_tank_an_end_game_pve/) 
---
\^I'm not the random noob you think I am.
---
I never played on PS4, but I can tell you that on PC, there was literally a single half filled survival mode server and that was it. And that was months before they actually removed it.
---
I mean I'm real happy that you have an optimized pvp set of gear? Congratz? I do too? Do you want to whip out our check books next to see who has the larger bank account? This isn't a pissing contest.
---
I get it but I fight from a further distance so I never really worry about that.
---
If you inspect it, you can see the value. 20 caps. Not too bad.
---
A locally hosted server would probably mean it would never be able to connect to regular environments. Only new characters.   
---
Bethesda has to be able to make money to pay for new content. If people are disconnected then that‚Äôd mean no atom shop, which means no revenue.
---
Eh I'm fine with how it currently is
---
lol
---
what do you sell the tokens for?
---
you actually pay less in cash to get 1st, and get the "free" atoms which equal MORE than what you paid for 1st
---
plus of course as mentioned above you also get all the other stuff
---
I think this is selfish, and puts a huge burden on the developer. If they say no, there could be backlash, if they say yes, then you have them being flooded with a million people asking for their dead to be remembered in game. 
---
Is a grave stone and memories not enough? Why do you have to burden others with your grief?
---
Everyone suffers loss.
---
I sold one for 2k a week ago was kind of surprised though don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worthy hat much
---
had the same thing happen yesterday with gunpowder i wanted to buy. very annoying
---
What in the world is wrong with you people?
---
How does this in any way affect you?
---
So he gets the girl's name put in the game...so? What then? You'll cry and moan about THAT?
---
Wow, this is the most toxic I've ever seen a group of people... Crying because someone wants a baby's name put in a game. You must have reached a new low if that's what upsets you today.
---
Seriously some of you need to take a good, long, in-depth look at yourselves as individuals. This is ridiculous.
---
Wish we could let the community give us an unofficial patch like in previous games.
---
It‚Äôs almost as if you‚Äôre the nazi, telling everyone what they should and shouldn‚Äôt do.
---
5.56 currency? Never heard of that one.
---
I haven't had a problem with the limit yet, but I imagine I will when I run out of serums to buy.
---
Aw man I never picked it up for free what was it for
---
AA with Stabilized just not effective together. You gain 50 + (45/2) = 72.5% armor penetration which is actualy 36-38% damage increase. If Stabilized value not get halved because you using AA, that would be a good damage boost.
---
ok, im kinda salty at this post
---
i missed all outfits, and havent been able to find any at vendors, i spent hours last night trying
---
SALTx100
---
Mwahahahahahahahahaha, LOL
---
Try going there AFTER Heart of The Swarm, I haven't tired after the update but that's what I used to do.
---
They lowered the cap limit to 25k and recently raised it to 30k to limit inflation caused by dupping.
---
My pacifist pursuit of the skeleton outfit reward continues still. Last night my solo team finished 2nd twice where the only other combatants left were a 3 man kill squad each time. I think they may have misunderstood my intentions as I wandered naked and unarmed out of the bushes. One time my killer actually teabagged my corpse (which was good for a laugh since I don't play multiplayer much and hadn't seen that in years) and the next time all 3 players continued to unload clip after clip into my corpse to make sure I wasnt just playing dead.
---
Still no regrets.
---
ok, so are you willing to sell/trade for yours please?  im  on ps4
---
They used to bloom every time during the Strangler Heart event.  They haven't been recently.  
---
I know this because I farm blooms and pods for Radshield and Disease Cure.
---
I checked out Dyer Chemical during two Heart of the Swamp events, both before and after.  I also participated in one thinking that this might make a difference...  no blooms...
---
If you've found blooms lately, it could be related to lower levels doing the Dyer Chemical quest rather than the Heart of the Swamp event.  
---
In any case, my thought is that either they have tweaked the blooms to happen less often or they introduced a bug that prevents them from blooming.
---
FALLOUT NV SNOWGLOBES!!!!!!!
---
Server stability, I‚Äôm told.  That said, I just reinvest mine in interesting legendary items. Replenishing my caps isn‚Äôt a problem
---
An adult or teen man makes a lot more sense than a 1 month old infant. That seems fitting, and it seems appropriate enough. This is just, imo, weird as hell.
---
&gt;I also have a fully optimized pvp character.    
---
&gt; I even went so far as to use a second account that I hid in a satellite base that provided my pvp charcter with extra perks, strange in numbers boosted empath, etc
---
That's a lot of work for a mode you claim is 100% "who saw who first." Your actions speak louder than words dude.        
---
    
---
And for the record, no ones ever lost anything meaningful in PvP in this game. That's the point of this post. Stirring up the people who act like they'd rather have you piss in their wheaties than down them in a video game. I'm salty as fuck about survival mode being removed and do 100% blame the people who had no business being there being scared. They got the top 3 removed, they got legendaries nerfed, they made bases invincible, got slap damage removed, and more. This game is so soft compared to release. They wanted a 2nd adventure mode with extra XP and Survival Mode is the 1 thing Bethesda listened to the loud cry babies about. So much so that IMO that is why the # of players went down.
---
no, people who snitch are pussies
---
Yeah like in FO3 where they had a baby and a modder made it so you could eat it
---
To each their own. I have plenty of what I need.
---
It's 2019 and I'm not 85 I don't write checks.
---
It started off at 25k.
---
Simple answer:  They're trying to control the game's economy.  They don't want people to get filthy rich because that devalues caps.
---
I'm not sure that they've ever publicly given a detailed explanation of their rationale, so if you want a deep dive on their reasoning and how they came to that number, you might have to ask them.  (Unless I've missed it somewhere, which is certainly possible.)
---
Haha they were just hugging you with lead XD
---
I can tell you some pieces make a notorious difference. Stand Fast, for example. I was already equipping Fixer and hard to detect Urban armor, and it became even sneakier.
---
But it is included, free to 1st subscribers.
---
It‚Äôs because caps in the engine are an item and not an attribute. 
---
They don‚Äôt take up the data of say your favorite BE handmade with all the fixings but it‚Äôs possible that having no upper limit could cause weirdness. 
---
Keeping that limit low makes the economy throttled which given the lack of large cap sinks at end game is necessary to keep it from being destroyed by would be merchant princes. Especially since one must be online to trade.
---
Why can't I use my Halloween Loot Bag anymore? Nowhere in the description did it say that it was ONLY for the Mischief Night event. If I had known that I could only use it for a week I most definitely would not have bought it.
---
Near the damn (south side) is a sunken rowboat you can hide under pretty well...
---
Oh. Now that makes sense. I just wish my corpse could have sent one last emote to say thank you then. Lol.
---
common sense? the sheer amount of crazy bugs in this game make it hard to really know what is a  bug and what is "just working"
---
I use 5.56 as currency too.  And .50 cal. 1 round = 1 cap. When your caps are running low, throw some 5.56 in your vending machine and they will sell out within the hour. Everybody wants 5.56
---
Somewhere in the asylum(fort defiance) can't remember the exact location inside for the rare spawn one
---
The skin is free for 1st subscribers, I guess I'm not understanding what the problem is?
---
So I‚Äôve heard! I guess if you‚Äôre sneaky enough you don‚Äôt have to worry about the hit on DR/ER when equipped. Thanks for the input too.
---
I flipping love this idea. But only if I can have domesticated cats, too. I try to build my camps where they spawn but I would totally be a crazy cat lady in the wasteland and need this in game. They could collect rad rat meat. Just sayin‚Äô
---
I've seen that trying to get items listed for 0 caps.
---
Sometimes exiting the trade window then reopening fixes it.
---
The fans mentioned were people who actively played the games, there alone is a big difference between immortalizing them as fans, and the daughter of a still living fan who herself did not get a chance to play, as harsh as it might come across.
---
Fix my car... What the fuck are you doing looking around in there? You don't need to find the problem, just fix it
---
Yea I get it, if you have a full Unyielding bos combat armor set 3* then that would work much better than PA.
---
Extra credit made a YouTube video about video game inflation kills games
---
Sure, if you want shit games with shit mtx by a shit company with shit business practises
---
Quick tip while using Escape Artist: do not crouch while behind cover, you have to crouch in an enemy's sight to actually lose detection.
---
Also, don't forget to turn off your flashlight, it makes sneaking impossible when it is on.
---
I personally refuse 5.56 in high level trades sometimes. I don't want to take the time to convert those into caps when I want to grind Encryptid. Sold a bffr .50 cal for 45k recently, it was a little in his favor but I needed the caps
---
The only known consistent spawn point is Drop site C-2 down in the bog. If the plan isn't there, server hop, If it's not the plan you want don't touch it, just keep server hopping. It took me 6-7 hops to find it back in the day.
---
I also wouldnt expect anything else from a raider. I wont capitalize that because raiders dont deserve a capital "R". Lol.
---
For a rough window of what you‚Äôre looking at, you‚Äôll want perks that decrease heavy weapon weight, increases its damage as well as for shotguns, weapon degradation perks and explosive perks and then try looking into legendaries with the secondary explosive prefix, which may warrant using the fireproof perk to negate the splash damage
---
You sound like a baby dude üòÇ
---
It makes perfect sense for the private servers to require a subscription. It makes no sense for anything like the scrap box or the tent.
---
Otherwise, anything that bethesda accepts money for after the initial purchase of the game should only be cosmetic, like they said before the game was released.
---
And some things caps cannot buy. It would be one thing if you could go to a game vendor and get say a BE handmade for 75k. Then eliminate the cap limit because now there is incentive to save up and spend big.
---
Or im just tryna have some fun and youre taking it the entire wrong way.
---
Wtf is a game pad? A controller?
---
I'll say something I said before. 
---
Shitty Behavior (Bethesda) + Shitty Behavior (Your post and the like) = Shittier Environment. No one wins. Your post is pointless and will be removed.
---
After spending time reading most of the comments in this post, it seems almost all of them give their perfectly respectful reasoning as to why they don‚Äôt agree with this.  I don‚Äôt see any examples of the toxic comments you‚Äôre mentioning at all.
---
Who loves Egg Nog for real! ‚úã
---
Thanks, I'll look into steam's remap funtions. ESO let you customize every single functional button so you were not at a disadvantage when it came to spamming custom aid items. But the favourites wheel on F76 is unresponsive when Yao Guai herds are attacking, or if explosive rounds are vibrating you. But I'll have do a google search on steam now

In my experience, best stealth is achieved by wearing ultralight shadowed combat armor, with your chest being Stand Fast and all those sneak perks. 15 agility is enough: you are invisible whatever the lights (even when the mod says "improves stealth at night/dark areas"). Ghouls, scorched, moleminers... they just bump into you, midday. 
---
You need some DR because some enemies are bugged and will spot you from a mile. Like, a charred ghoul will come running towards you from 20 miles away, or a scorched will start looking for you in the darskest cave because he knows you are there. Also, events like "Meat Week", where stealth is deactivated by default. 
---
With the set I suggested (and defensive perks), you get perfect stealth and 300-400 DR. Not bad at all.
---
obviously its not unplayable for the many many people who have spent hundreds of hours playing and enjoying it
---
Morrowind had bugs
---
Oblivion had bugs
---
Fallout 3 has bugs
---
Fallout NV had bugs
---
Skyrim had bugs
---
Fallout 4 had bugs
---
Fallout 76 has bugs
---
why are you acting so surprised, you knew what you were walking into!
---
Maybe play a game worth 60$ base and 100$/yr and I'll retract my statement. Otherwise, lolnah
---
That's all your opinion. You obviously feel personally slighted somehow, but this game and the developers. Somehow you've taken that perceived slight and used it to make a terribly false generalization, because everyone else must have the problem. It can't possibly be you. Nope. Never. /s
---
Dont be a douche then? Lol. Like youve never called somebody a dickhead just messing with them.. foh dude.
---
You are saying that people still playing this game it is because they still trying to pursue the fun on this game because they paid it ? I mean if it is not that just tell me because i am lost right now...

It‚Äôs one of my favorite holidays, but then I like to cook and get along with my family.

Cherry pie can generally be found year round here, but as with just about everything, it‚Äôs better when cherries are in season and everything is scratch made. Out of season the pie filling, more likely than not, comes as a canned product of cherries in what amounts to a very heavy syrup. It‚Äôs not bad, but it can be much better when made fresh.
---
As a heavy gun build I wouldn't mind a buff.
---
But as a heavy gun main, the majority of heavy guns genuinely do not need a buff to be viable

Go to fort defiance. On the left there is a door locked by a red button near it.
---
If you played the questline through, it shoild open. (Not shure about it...)
---
After you enter the hallway, go right after that again a right turn and you should see an elevator.
---
Go to the 3rd floor.
---
Just outside the elevator you have a door in front of you. In there is the first spawn location for a rare asylum outfit.
---
From there go to the other end where you find a room with some other beds. There is the second location whete it can spawn an asylum outfit. 
---
Last one is just located across the room you entered. Its a toilet with some showers. Near the showers you can find the last spawn for a rare asylum outfit on the bench.
---
Sometimes you also find a tin foil hat there.
---
Hope you have lots of luck. I think i miss 2 outfits to complete my asylum collection.

They axed survival mode because it was a broken mess and it needed to go back to the drawing board to be reworked. I don't think it had anything to do with your so called "food builds" being scared. More like it just wasn't popular enough to warrant the resources.

Youre a fucking idiot. This time its not a joke.

Great advice. Doesn‚Äôt change anything, bud. I‚Äôll keep doing what I want and you can keep shilling for a shitty game.

The empath bug involves strange in numbers increasing damage taken instead of further reducing it.
---
* False Cause Fallacy (or Casual Fallacy) - assuming that people who are playing and supporting the game must be because they are suffering from Sunken Cost Fallacy
---
* Hasty Generalization - that the game, in your words, "is shit, with shit microtransactions, from a shit company". A bit of Ad hominem in there as well
---
Not that you even made an argument
---
*COMMUNIST DETECTED ON AMERICAN SOIL. LETAL FORCE ENGAGED.*
---
Bloodied is plenty powerfull so it wouldn't need a buff but for the others definitely
---
Your girlfriend would probably enjoy talking to you about it if she enjoys the game. Just don't be condescending because you think the game sucks. But anyway, explosives don't have to be in PA, nor shotguns or even really heavy weapons. However in PA your heavies ignore armor and have increased accuracy. It's good you guys are gonna be playing together
---
Well if you chose the inferior platform you pay the price. The game was made for PC. Most of the problems many people see, are because of low powered consoles trying to play the game. Even the Xbox One X is marginal on a 4k display.
---
Every time you continue, you prove your own point more wrong.
---
Why are you here?
---
I think that Bethesda is dead as a game development studio. And now this shitty-greedy game publisher is out of control. I didn't buy Fallout 4 and 76 and that's saved me from disappointment two times. How can we change modern game development? Cause we can't play Fallout 2 and New Vegas until we die.
---
The colored outfits can spawn there?
---
There's a few cap sinks, Vending Machines, Encryptid cards, and plans/resippies
---
Wrong sub.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
someone locked the front door but I wanted to take a look at what plans he had for sale so I picked his lock to get to the vendor. Not sure why he locked door as I saw no other way in. I did not know picking locks automatically makes you wanted since I took nothing and nobody was around to see it..lol...anyway I get back to my camp and I am wanted for just 10 caps. Some loser that was over level 200 just walks in and kills me quick. Then he camps outside, not sure what he was doing but he was standing around outside for over an hour. Its like he was just waiting for a wanted person I guess.
---
So... Let me get this straight. Your upset that keyboards have more keys/butttons then a controller?
---
If we like people would still ask for stash space to go up lol
---
I shouldn‚Äôt laugh.. I just imagine an indifferent mother looking down her nose every time I hear ‚Äúlive with your mistake‚Äù (or read in this case)
---
Because this post is stupid and this trash needs to be kept off this sub that‚Äôs why. If he gets to ask for his daughter to be put into the game, then I want my grandfather and my grandmother too to be remembered. I want my dog that passed away to have a statue.
---
oops
---
WellüòÇüòÇ
---
Yes. I‚Äôve picked up green, brown and white.  I assume all could spawn.
---
I didn‚Äôt buy it but yeah, that sucks.
---
It used to be that for some mutations it didn't reduce them enough to matter. Say a mutation has a minus, like minus AGI. So at 50% reduction it halves the number of minus AGI. But, at 75% reduction, you'd find it still had the same number of minus AGI as 50% because it didn't round up to the nearest whole number. Instead, it would round down, making some mutations better while others would see no change between a level 2 and a level 3 perk card. So lvl 2 makes -2 AGI, and lvl 3 doesn't go to -1 AGI it just stays at -2.
---
That's how it used to be reported as working, around 1 month after beta. That extra special point to have 3 in just seemed wasteful to my build, so I stopped at 2. Haven't changed it since I started playing again last week, don't feel the need to yet.
---
Similar with the melee swing speed perk card and legendaries with swing speed. LVL 3 card for 75% swing speed does not stack with faster weapon swing to make 100% faster. Just something like 80% faster.
---
That's how it used to be reported as working, on here. May have changed, I haven't really kept up.
---
Plans and mutations yes. Not so much with encryptid. Purveyor sale is the only time to run encryptid for fixer plan. No other reason to run it unless it‚Äôs for fun.
---
I‚Äôve found myself hitting all camps during each game session so I can unload caps on some stuff so my vending machines do run me up to the limit.
---
The problem is not heavy weapons. Fast firing / low damage per shot weapons in general, like the minigun, gatling laser, etc, are heavily diminished by how the armor system works in Fallout 76 (also Fallout 4). The lower the damage per shot, the more it's damage is reduced. This is just the nature of the FO76 / FO4 armor system. A far better system would be to give a flat % damage reduction. That way your 500 damage per shot, 1 shot per second weapon does as much effective dps as your 50 damage per shot, 10 shots per second weapon.
---
Despite this, the .50 cal and gatling gun are both very good heavy weapon options. A BFFR .50 cal is among the top dps, best handling guns in the game. It does far more dps than a handmade without stealth. With sneak attacks, the handmade does do a bit more, and since heavy weapon stealth / vats crit builds aren't a thing, it technically does more damage potential. BE Gatling Gun is insanely ammo efficient. I one shot everything but Scorchbeasts, and they die in only 2-3 shots at most.
---
Thanks for the advice buddy, but this is about spamming healing aid in a duel/fight etc. It's 3 actions for custom aid on controller, and 1 single action on for custom aid on keyboard
---
It was but a lot of misinformation. Heck during beta I was going to cancel preorder but a bunch of people were saying they were going to remove the stash or increase it a lot and it was only a beta hence why it was so small. I really regret sending 90 dollars on this game(Tricentennial edition).
---
May I ask why you subscribed, and why you now want to cancel?
---
I love that youve gone through and changed your responses to this convo. Lol.

What about if they use a nuke?

I want my grandparents added in and my dog too. Then everyone else can ask for their relatives as well. They could just fill the whole game with content on memorials for fans. Call it Bethesda‚Äôs fans family cemetery 76
---
wow i pay 100 each, how many you have? i‚Äôll come by
---
meaning we are 2x lees effective as food builds
---
I'm sure they'll find ways to keep fallout 1st customers entertained, but nothing of value or substance for the rest of us. Gotta keep the pay pigs fed; second class citizens can hold their breath til spring.
---
I didn‚Äôt
---
Yeah this and the other guy's replies are totally unrelated to my post....but ok thank you for telling me what you do with your ammo.
---
Weapons alone from doing Westtek runs make you reach the daily vendor cap limit easily. Cooked meat also helps if you don't have much carry weight.
---
What I meant to say is that the reason for a stash cap isnt junk, junk is just a number. Whether you have 100 steel or just 2 steel, it's just an integer. With weapons and armor it's more than that because not each one is the same, that's what puts the strain on the server
---
I've ran the event over 50 times. Only quick end game content you can do and you get multiple 3* spawns. Sell my Fixer plans for 15-20k, it feeds the next round of Encryptid
---
...so you wanna know if there's a way to get the riot armor for free then? Hah. Come on man you know the answer to that
---
They don't care if you don't pay, your obviously a human so your not the targets. Its them whales they are after.
---
Yea it's the same with most subscription games sadly
---
I put my scraptron station behind an L shaped bar setup, he stays there behind both bars tending bar, Bob the bot. I just wish we could throw a skin/hat on him, I want to dress him up like the Whitesprings tuxedo bots, with a top hat.
---
This is only food/drinks dude, not stim/rads etc
---
Like I said, opinions doesn't matter at this point. Look at the facts.
---
He's talking about godly weapons and armor. No one is going to sell you a B5025 handmade for caps, at least on PC.
---
My question is, if you make use of that extra CAMP budget in your private world, what happens when you go back into Adventure? Will it keep your CAMP as it was prior to your changes in your private world?
---
OOOOh that's very helpful! I didn't realize PA was so ill advised. When i was watching her, EVERYONE was in PA. and i haaaaaaaaaate it.
---
Scrip man. They should have made scrip unlimited and allowed people to reroll stuff on gear for high scrip costs, then allow scrip trading. But to make that OK, they'd need to fix duping.
---
I‚Äôve heard you can but I haven‚Äôt tried it myself
---
No problem :) hope you enjoy the game lol
---
Yeah Lockpick and Hacker are perfect examples lol, might get a bit annoying switching them out (perk loadouts coming eventually, yay) but it's worth it for the extra 6 points
---
Oof
---
This is extremely useful. Thank you my dude. Ill be comparing this to what I already have and seeing what improvements I can make to my own with your suggestions.
---
The minigun benefits the most from the Stabilized perk since armor is what makes it not deal as much damage.
---
Yup thats why I got it
---
 I have one serum recipe left to buy and dont no what I will do then.. lol
---
That would make Power Armor basically obsolete. What we really need is legendary Power Armor.
---
gotta keep those points used best!
---
How?
---
This. I've tried every which way the internet said. During the "heart of the swamp" after, before, at night....everything.
---
AWOL does the same and its free. Decent chance you get a weird glitch where if you kill a legendary it will turn the next closest enemy legendary. Wish I knew how it happens.

---
My experience is that although they have the potential to do higher dps, they're considerably more fragile and don't do well in nuke zones. Staying in stealth vs. SBQ is also finicky. If you can't stay in stealth, they straight up do less damage than a heavy weapons build like the one below:

---
I run both, they're both fun, but if I had to choose one build for general pve play I'd go heavy weapons power armor for sure.
---
Your keyboard plugs into your monitor?
---
Did you shut your game off or just play something else for a while? I'v left my console off for hours and came back to the same error.
---
Boy has to learn... give home everything and they‚Äôll never learn how to work and succeed... kinda like real life...
---
I knew that have the IP atm, but I figured they could reach out to Obsidian since they made it.
---
I too hoard junk, mostly just clean or unique varieties but it would be fun to have some more. Especially if they add to displays in any way, thin vertical glass case to take up less floor space would be fabulous, or a legitimate shelf to place on a wall.
---
There was an immediate huge drop off in players after the nerf. I don't think that PvP enthusiasts who played survival religiously called for nerfs and then quick because they got what they wanted. I also don't think it back at the drawing board being reworked either. If anything PvP will make it's come back in faction contested areas of the map, or in the form of a mod you can buy for your own private server. At this point I don't think they'll do anything in this game they can't monetize from here on out.
---
Let me know if you still want this?
---
Seems a bit overboard.
---
No, it plugs into the PC, which is connected to the monitor. Anything of sense to ask?
---
Not sure if you knew but Biv does have quests associated with him. You can learn how to craft the all the alcohol. It‚Äôs a repeatable quest that you can do daily. You start the quest from the quest terminal that you can build in your camp. You said you were a low level so I‚Äôm not sure if you knew this or not.
---
I really don't care either way except adding a name to a gravestone would probably change my handmade to using .308 ammo or make my clothes fall off every time i ate canned dog food, such is the way with FO76 features  vs bugs
---
1) Past games being buggy doesn't justify this game being buggy
---
2) People are getting tired of how the same bugs from decades ago keep showing it even today. Bethesda has had years to fix them but they won't because they think the community will fix it for them.
---
3) Fallout 76 was probably Bethesda's most broken release ever.
---
4) Bugs are much easier to ignore in a singleplayer game with a ton of content, not a multiplayer game that is considered by most people to be lacking a lot of content
---

Wait what? How\`?? I have "Better inventory" installed and i long for this! I can't see anything other than the slider to adjust the prices. Your help is gold!
---
I read an article that said that a company only needs to have between 5 and 15% of its player base to support itself financially, at least when it comes to mobile games, it was about Whales. So if this sample size is any indicator of the player base in total, that means Bethesda was correct when stating it being wildly successful, or whatever wordage they used. 17% is more then enough to justify the subscription fee and keep the game going. I still don't agree with the decision, and I stopped playing back in April, it was just a disappointment for me and I honestly don't hold out hope for Bethesda's future games. But, all they have to do is maintain a player base big enough to keep them financially secure and they will be successful whether I agree with their business decisions or not. Only thing to do is to wish them good luck and move on, even if my regards are sarcastic and full of cynicism.

Try a less common location, I have yet to encounter a server where someone's Tent was in my CAMP location.

I use a PC, try using a controller vs a food build, and see the serious disadavantge of having to pres 3 times more buttons to consume each food item

This games bouta be overboard.

One every two months!

Cue Picard "..its trying to communicate."
---
you really seem to be invested in hating on this game, why not just give it up and move on? i cant imagine any reason in my life i would dwell on something that did not bring me happiness, it is just a drain on your psyche and a drain on all those around you whoa re subjected your your ranting.
---
So I play a game and i find i dont like it.  Why in gods name would i EVER go onto that games reddit board and continually bitch about how i dont like it?   
---
Does this make any sense to you?
---
Your power armour eats HP foods?

same here I'm getting married in 3 days so my "disposable income" is no longer a thing
---
It might actually be some kind of effort to keep people from becoming multi millionaires so we‚Äôre all on a sort of even level. I dunno. There are ways around it, people who have multiple characters they use as cap banks, etc
---
How would the double xp help players like me who are lvl 250 and have stopped playing the game because the game is infested with bugs and they rarely add new content?
---
I wouldn't mind if they made it a little more predictable.  Like, the first weekend of each month or something.
---
Stimpaks on low health every 30 seconds lol
---
why make 10 flavors if you can‚Äôt get vanilla right
---
So reintroduced?  
---
Ouch
---
Why does that matter?
---
It‚Äôs to curb inflation. We‚Äôve already seen how greedy people are.
---
Mine has stopped working too. 5 other people we play with have the same problem. I'm going to be pissed if it was only useable for a week. Nowhere in the description did it say anything about using it only for the event so I hope they fix it soon.
---
Now if we could only get a retraction from angry joe, yongyea, and the rest of YouTube‚Äôs scum
---
So you want a controller that has as many keys as a keyboard? Cause your keyboard is pluged into your monitor for some reason?
---
I have a perk for that buddy that hits every 20 seconds, the main problem is being forced to use a wheel which takes a few actions to use
---
I'm with you on this one, I'm level 247 and have all the perks I want unlocked and don't care about XP.  I literally sign in, get my scrip, do a handful of events to get plans and maybe do some challenges if they aren't incredibly stupid.  Other than that there really is almost no reason for me to keep playing but I keep logging in almost every day...
---
For or from? Also, where did you hear this?
---
I take it you are one the ones in question....
---
I would on Xbox for what it‚Äôs worth. I don‚Äôt have one but out of principle only deal in caps. On crazy weapon I get is either from scrip or enemies. Selling for a few caps is reasonable.
---
Exactly. For 12 dollars you get private servers, cosmetics, tent, scrapbox, *and* 16.50 dollars of atoms, i would consider those atoms to be an awesome deal, if not a freebie. So spending 30% of your monthly freebie atoms on a cool skin is hardly a problem at all.
---
Does that shit break ridiculously fast or have I been mislead?
---
I recently found out that you can get a Small Backpack plan from the overseer chest in the Morgantown Airport, I think it give a bit less carry weight than the scout pack. It's a good boost until you can make it into Toxic Valley
---
ive never seen any other spawn points either, i still try though just in  case
---
They gave us our scrap as compensation. Which was equal to what we lost, so it was ok.
---
Actively investigating? Like a year before even acknowledging it being an issue? Coooooool.
---
Any word on when the next 2XP event will be live?
---
This would keep me interested a lot more. I am level 25 and quit playing because it was too hard to level up solo  and the game felt way too grindy for me.
---
It was a tongue in cheek joke
---
hmmm that is news to me, is it one of the locked BOS rooms in the BOS hallways, or set within the asylum proper?
---
Yeah, never worked
---
I subscribed to a monthly plan of fallout first, to see what it's all about. 
---
canceled the subscription yesterday as soon as I found out that the paint costs atoms.

won't be resubscribing anytime soon.

This is a reintroduced bug fixed a few patches ago, opening the Pip-boy just right after sprinting ends will lock out most  controls, players cannot move or look around, only access the  map and take a photomode picture mode.

And waste perk space no that sucks.  If your always starving i say stop geting deasese

If you're over level 50 and take a workshop, you're fair play as far as im concerned. 
---
Dont hop in the lake if youre scared of drowning.
---
yea, everyone stop complaining about all the lack of new content, terrible sub service that adds no real value, added bugs with every update, crashing, stability problems, pr nightmare, lack of players, poorly implemented mechanics, months long bug persistence, sluggish response time, greed, overhyped updates, general cluelessness and incompetence and just enjoy the game and spend money on reskins of god damn grills that are in the base game
---
Really wasnt expecting to get a refund so that's a nice surprise
---
Bathtub egg nog.
---
I don't know if it will help retain players, but I definitely want it for me.
---
I think that might be specifically for private worlds and I really hope that's the case (as much as I need more camp budget)
---
Come on, lets assume we are not idiots.  
---
We do file it as a bug report, but to cut through the white noise of all the other reports we often also contact community managers, **Following the process Bethesda suggested we do for critical issues.**
---
Was this on Xbox? There was a guy repeatedly surviving in the fire with 0 health left, and he'd just wait until the fire killed everyone else. I and several others reported him and took multiple videos. I haven't seen him since.
---
I'm not sure you speak English as your native language, but No, I want assignable foods/drinks to a single use button, like in every other game. Not once did I mention needing more buttons, and keyboards plug into PC's &amp; it's also a TV, not a Monitor
---
I would love to see this lol.
---
The plans are for the mods. There is no plan for the base weapon.
---
No mystery there at all, I‚Äôve been in this sub for a year now, don‚Äôt care about fake internet points. I get it, I just don‚Äôt agree and will voice my opinion regardless.
---
If we ever get the prestige perks, which iirc were going to be retroactively awarded for ever 50 levels or something along those lines.
---
But that's about it I can think of.
---
Correct and if the components r in the normal stash, it does not break down the bug parts.
---
Why wouldn't you just play a good game or at least a good Fallout? Inb4mypersonalopinionitsagoodgameidrathereatshitthanasteak

M Kings are not as bad as Queens, I faced 5 or so at one time and they didn't anything to me, I Just fried them with Explosive gatling gun

Bethesda, I would also like my deceased grandpa to be immortalized in this game. He had never heard of Fallout and could barely use a VCR, let alone a computer or video game console, but he died and I loved him and I play Fallout so gimme gimme gimme!
---
Probably not unless someone is threatened. While not cool, you are allowed to say mean things.
---
I really doubt that's the case, they can't just stop them from going to adventure or force their camp only in private worlds. This is just them selling camp budget now.
---
nothing happens.. Bethesda doesn't ban anymore
---
ESO memorizes you favorites wheel last choice, and then so turns it into a single use button.  A mechanic than would make it fair for cross control/keyboard support, like in GTA V, ESO and many more with fully customizable buttons
---
As long as camp budget increase and the items can be placed anywhere; it would be cool.
---
They are doing a good job demonstrating how much Bethesda doesn‚Äôt give a fuck.
---
Because of the community (that actually plays the game), creative player camps, trading, community events, and Nuclear Winter.
---
I'm sort of curious by what precedent you're basing this on.
---
Even Valve, well known for modding projects, doesn't allow modders to redistribute voices.
---
Ugh. I still have nightmares about my retail phase.
---
Why not just use keyboard?
---
This is old news and not related to 76. Go bitch about it in the appropriate place.
---
Actually laughed out loud at this, good job.
---
Ugly stuff, isn't it?
---
It doesn't change the point of my statement. When they announced Fallout 1st, they gave you a heads up that it'll have exclusive sales in it, which is what you made this post bitching about.
---
Congrats on being right about the paint though.
---
And this sub wonders why community managers don't engage with them more. Jfc
---
Yes, and ESPECIALLY do this on Tuesdays after the new weekly challenges go live... Or you'll lose those, too.
---
You just read why I don't use the keyboard, the 42" screen? Hellooo tap tap tap
---
I'm a monthly subscriber. I say give everyone the scrapbox and make the tent available in the Utility section of the atom shop. Aside from that, make private worlds actually persistent and able to host the full 24 player count.
---
That's normally my MO, but my wife says I should try to be nicer.
---
I just turn chat off.
---
Heh, I ain't doing it. Heck I've unstalled this shitshow. Bethesda cheats on us why not cheat back or in my case just unstall and put your time in something more usefull.
---
The grind is real but that‚Äôs usually the case with live service games. The bugs are what ultimately drove me away.
---
in general can we just have a bending over ‚Äúassuming the position‚Äù emote

So your keyboard is tired to your monitor?

Hey man I'm 33 usually on after 4:30pm est.

---
What is that the gun Id number? I‚Äôve been playing since the start just never bothered with taking specs gear serious.
---
Because people are looking for any excuse to hate on 1st subs,it's pretty sad and I'm not even a sub
---
You‚Äôre exactly right. I managed to sell a couple that i had for 5k and I feel like I ripped off the buyers.
---
IMO they‚Äôre pretty much worthless. They are ridiculously heavy, especially with mods, and not a good weapon. Also everyone hoards limited event items so there are too many sellers. By bringing meat week back so soon it made the value of those limited items even lower.
---
Don't worry might be a Fallout 1st exclusive monthly double XP soon enough. 
---
Jokes aside(hopefully) overall I agree I don't play as much as once did so not spending money or planning on fallout 1st having me come back a weekend a month might spark me into playing more which could lead to me investing in the game.
---
Sure you can join me if you want when im on
---
There are more legal consequences for inaction on an active contract (subscription) with consideration (money) involved - they HAVE to promptly deal with Fallout 1st issues.
---
For me this is worse than not being able to fire. I hope it will be fixed.
---
Todd sends the guys to their house, kapeesh üòé

I'm confused.  Is there something new here?
---
It's been known since March of 2018 that people couldn't reuse the original dialogue lines to make a new mod like this.  
---
I'm not an expert, but I imagine that this has more to do with copyright law and less to do with "Bethesda is a shitty company."  I've heard that being lax with enforcement of your own copyrights can lead to losing some of your legal rights regarding them.  That could be total bullshit.  I'm way out of my depth when talking about copyright law.
---
Unless there is a massive outcry, nothing.
---
Hah I‚Äôve thought about it before but I mentally cant accept losing that much. Even if it pays back with 500 cap serum sales. I may have gotten there if this wasn‚Äôt my second high level toon collecting patterns.
---
Probably not for me, I don‚Äôt have FO1st üòÇ
---
Just a couple of points of reply to some very well thought out points.
---
There are rumors on sites that through data mining people have found that there will be new emotes and outfits every month for FO1st. Im not sure how concrete these rumors are but it seems legit.
---
As far as I know, the monthly atom equivalent is about $15. I'm not sure what that would be Canadian but it works out relatively the same here in Ireland. 
---
Players who bought the game are already getting love. You're getting free DLC and those vault raids when they release. My understanding is that the reason a sub was introduced is there weren't enough sales being made through the Atom Shop to fund free DLC and servers. However, I would be more inclined to believe that FO1st was planned to drop when the Wastelanders DLC did but when Wastlanders was put back to 2020, the owners of Bethesda got them to drop the sub now rather than wait in order to make money so the company looks more profitable in order to sell it on.
---
As with server space, the space needed for the scrap stash is included. It is a stability issue. Its why it hasn't been increased above 800. IIRC there were a lot of gameplay issues even when it was increased to 800. 
---
I agree with the idea of more atoms being earned but again the argument would be there are amble ways to earn them through daily/weekly/character/social/combat/world challenges. Maybe a small increase from 40 to maybe 50 or 60 would be good.
---
The cost of the sub is reasonable especially if you pay for the year. You're getting it for $8 a month which if you look at it you're getting double the amount of atoms alone before the rest of the perks. From checking the currency rate $13 is $17Canadian. At the minute here in Ireland Im paying ‚Ç¨15 but if you convert $13 to Euro its ‚Ç¨12 but we also have to pay tax. But on the broader scale, ESO+ is $15/month. WoW is similar. There are a few other MMO's that I had checked (cant remember the names) that have subs and their all between $10 and $15 per month. So all in all its actually decent value for what your getting. 
---
In my opinion from what I've gathered from readiing through posts and comments on FB/Twitter/Reddit and other social media sites, the general feeling is that the people who are angry about it are using the 'Pete Hines said it will all be free' argument. The issue I would take there is that they aren't looking at the context of what was said but rather just taking it and running with it.
---
they should add massed tatos too
---
If it‚Äôs through PlayStation DM‚Äôs and it‚Äôs like racial/homophobic/sexist slurs and such, you can report them to PSN and something might happen. With no in game video it would be hard for Bethesda to do anything.
---
The best solution right here.

My bad, that's from the Save Everything mod

No, as I said, it's attached to the PC. Which is neatly confided within a PC desk, , so I'm at least 2 meters back leaving no keyboard wire distance, with the distance I have to sit back for my eyes safety
---
I have had no issues with my scrap box... It's been allot of fun having it along with the mobile camp.
---
Damn, that's one of the benefits of 1st
---
I see. You want a wireless keyboard.

Yeah I‚Äôve had the usual smack talk and stuff but this guy just called me every name under the sun, tried to bait me into workshop areas, and followed me around for 30 mins lol. I know I could mute him but I don‚Äôt like doing that, don‚Äôt ask me why cuz I have no idea.
---
Feel better? lol

Best thing to do is ignore them, if they get a reaction from you that's what they're wanting and they'll keep going.

---
Block them  and them jump servers. Don‚Äôt subject yourself to stupid people.
---
I wish that was an option dude, but the game auto disables keyboard in controller mode for some reason, so even xpadder is down the drain to customize buttons a bit. On keyboard I can take on 7+ max level assaultrons using HP food builds, on controller it's a job to kill 2 assaultrons being forced to use stimpacks, which also have an animation cooldown
---
Yea I always feel better than everyone around

Yeah do t ask me why I just don‚Äôt like doing that for some reason, I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve had so many good encounters with people asking for help through their mic etc...

Make the workshop item a catbowl and scratching post that requires wood, cloth, plastic, and brahmin milk.

I think that memorials in games are usually done for people who were a big part of the community and played the game more than most, not dad family members who never played the game. 
---
It's nice when it's the community that wants the memorial, not so much when it's asked for because it is something other people have gotten IMO.

It‚Äôs a counter troll. Turn your mic off and spam I don‚Äôt know emoji. They will get so mad they just leave.

It's as if F76 is the only game with microtransactions and a subscription.

It would definitely get me playing again I'm at level 185 and 2xp would definitely make it easier to level up took a break from the game need something else to grind but I would come back for 2xp events
---
Was it fun the first time? Now imagine it being considerably less fun than that.
---
Oh yea by giving us a broken game, a broken game that was missing allot of features, and prioritize ways to get more cash out of us by putting those promised features that should have been from the start behind a paywall. What now huge amounts of items in your stash would cause server problems, lets give the 1st guys a box where you can stash infinite amounts of scrap. And there are hundreds of different and unique items marked as scrap in the wasteland wouldn't that not cause you know.... server instability? 
---
Yeah I understand how businesses work. But I also understand how cash grab predatory businesses work. Soon we'll have the creation club back and drain more cash out of you poor souls. Mark my words.
---
Trademark dilution is one of the reasons that they don't allow this.  By not protecting their trademark, they weaken their claim to it.  Allowing whoever wants to reuse their work without proper compensation would be a bad business move.
---
The modders were never 'allowed' to reuse assets from previous games.  Most know that this is strictly forbidden and don't do it.  Some may not know (or don't care), and they get called out on it when it's found.
---
OP is operating on his feeling about what he or she wants and a hatred for the current company, while most everyone else is operating on actual codified laws.
---
I wish I had the coins to give you an award
---
If you want it and continue playing, then it just retained one player. Thousands more will likely think like you and be happy then it will work. If a game that I‚Äôve grind a lot for has a double xp weekend then I‚Äôm always hoping over to that game for a bit even if I haven‚Äôt played it in a while.

bloodied 50% vats crit damage 25% less vats AP cost.

PC players will absolutely not sell god tier weapons for caps, because most of us have literally 200k+. I saw a BE plasma gatling sell for 200K and I bet the guy could have gotten more. The best weapons would sell for enough caps on PC to literally max out 3-4 accounts, if they sold at all (which they typically don't).
---
Yeah, I should have to do that because some folks get to pick two camp spots...
---
Faschnaut isn't exactly a well known holiday, but we got an event for that? Plus what better traditional american holiday to celebrate in the world of fallout than thanksgiving? Besides maybe Independence Day.
---
I'm always disease free buddy, the problem is food and drink are 10x better at healing when spammed in a fight/duel than stimpacks, and the only instant heal controller users have is stimpacks which heal over time, and have an animation cooldown to top it off, so i'm extremely disadvantaged against a keyboard food/drink build

I left for the better part of year. I have been having fun.

But when I left there wasnt much in terms of content. If you have already done the content then i can see it being drastically less fun. 
---
Also i changed up my build. No longer will i wade into melee. I am a sneaky snake who bips from a vantage point.
---
I love NW but I genuinely found that playing it made me a better Fortnite player...and I f\*\*king hate Fortnite :D
---
They would make and atom shop item
---
You want numbers? I have sneak vats critical commando build. For PVE I have a quad critical -25% AP cost in vats handmade. Pipboy says I have 78 damage. Through adrenaline, gunfu, concentrated fire head shots, covert operative/mister sandman, and tons of critical multipliers, I have hit upwards of 1,200 damage per shot. Critical hit portion of my damage is about 150, 300 on a head shot. I have 80 rounds in the clip and it costs me zero AP to shoot in vats.
---
I had more fun with my second character.
---
Faction contested areas with pvp sounds like a lot of fun honestly. Having an objective and reason to pvp would be cool.
---
Cry some more.
---
It gets very boring half of the time doesn't it?
---
Going on the long Raider quests and heading back and forth?
---
I do agree on the curtains! I hate getting dressed in my camp and my cheeks hanging out the bottom of my dress for the whole world to see. I‚Äôm claustrophobic so having no windows is a no go. Maybe curtains that cover the windows 1/2 way so if there are any Peter gazers our there they just get a little sneak peak.
---
I do know that is the reason Disney, for example, so vigorously defends their copyright on all the many many properties they own. That's the reason they often cite, at any rate - " If we let this one person do it, suddenly we'll be forced to let everyone, and then we have no copyright at all". Not saying that's true, or that it isn't, I'm not a copyright lawyer. Just saying that's the reason often given.
---
Clearly, but in a sick way I can sort of relate to his comment, when you want something to work so bad and it keeps taking wrong turns you kind of hit that ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù point. 
---
That said, duping still sucks.
---
no, its just karma farming/view farming chief.
---
Make it use Mothman Eggs and we can all celebrate Moth-mas this season.
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been suggested but why not let us buy atoms for caps.
---
It all depends on your build type. If you are a vats build, god rolls may include two vats effects. Crit builds may want 50% vats crit and faster vats crit fill.
---
Etc..
---
This is great idea, I use emotes pretty much, because it's the easiest way to tell squadmates something, e. g. you have some loot for them, because most of them don't use mic. I would add something like stay hidden or danger and so on...
---
I‚Äôm level 250. I want more cards I get excited to level up. I have changed my build many times to optimize it to my play style and weapons and I‚Äôll probably change it again when I get my next best weapon. Plus double xp in Nuclear winter can drag you out of adventure mode and get you some of those rewards you get from leveling up. And some people would like to level up their mules or different playing style characters. I know guys who have characters for killing queen, a different one for vault raids, a different one for PVP, and one that holds all their chems along side their main character all on one account.
---
My understanding was that was a mistake and they corrected it,  when I saw it was listed as free for 1st.
---
Playstation takes these things VERY seriously. If he sent you voice clips through Playstation DMs, report it through the message. Depending on what exactly was said they will at the least get a soft ban.
---
People are getting the premium subscription service to be able to sneak attack solo SBQ on their own private server.
---
Could be many rolls, like most bloodied explosive weapons or anti armor faster fire rate are considered God weapon, but like the guy above said it really depends on your build
---
I 10000000% agree with this:
---
 \- IF you see a large glowing green fissure or hole in the ground, **TURN AROUND AND RUN** =) 
---
Run...run very very fast. Do not look back...just fucking run :/
---
Just out of interest though dude, what controller do you use?
---
Mysterious stranger perk perhaps?
---
The issue is server latency combined with owner interaction.  
---
Example:  50 cores.  Owner uses tinker bench to make a few prime cores and inadvertently uses one of his for sale cores.  Due to the number offered (50) not being available, and latency to update...  you can try to buy them all and the transaction fails.
---
I have come across this with many consumable items and the fix, is to buy them one at a time...  not intuitive but it works.
---
Yeah if they added a sneaking vault boy or a vault boy with an empty ammo box being shook up and down it would be a real help
---
I have encountered this bug when game loads or after fast travel. Restarting game fixed it, but it reoccurs sometimes.
---
Follow that. Embrace power armor. It's a must if you want heavy weapons. Abandon your dreams of using shotguns - they do not work well in 76 at all for end game due to how damage and armor scaling works. Explosive weapons like rocket launchers etc. are not very good. For raw dps, a bloodied 25% faster fire rate .50 cal is your best bet. Primed (uses ultracite ammo which you need to craft) is even better - will do roughly 50% more damage to SBQ. For efficiency with regular farming, a Bloodied explosive Gatling Gun does wonders. There are options in that build guide for a 2h melee variant as well, which you can use for farming until you get good weapons. The weapons I mentioned there are what are considered "godly" end game weapons. However, you can do almost as much damage with 1 star variants - just a 1 star bloodied .50 cal does wonders with the right build.
---
Same subject, different question...
---
Does class freak 3 while in power armor completely remove the negative effect? As in, the 75% reduction is gone.  I seem to have one toon, once I put power armor on my strength goes to -1.
---
I can not imagine how over the top disgusting a language could be to offend someone with the name richard-geres-gerbil
---
New player here. Fianc√© and a few buds have been playing daily with minimal issues, other than the Halloween Event being a lagstravaganza. Very few lockup‚Äôs and disconnects, with solid performance overall on the Xbox One X. 
---
The sound design is fantastic. Wildlife sings, wind howls, and your shots echo in the distance while shell casings slap the floor with a satisfying ring.
---
Game has been a non-stop blast. We‚Äôve been completely hooked for a week straight, with no end in sight. 
---
+ Build Mode
---
+ Environmental Storytelling 
---
+ Beautiful Orchestral Score
---
+ Tons of Classic Fallout Tunes
---
+ All the junk loot/ items/ clothing/ armor and guns you‚Äôd expect from Fallout
---
+ Immersion 
---
    Sit on chairs and couches, cook on that pot over there, sleep at campsites, ‚Äî or build your own‚Äî, watch as your mate reloads his sawn-off with nice 3rd person reload animations after decapitating a ghouly boy, etc.
---
+ Item Trading 
---
    Trade or drop any (not Atomic Shop) item with friends and other players. It‚Äôs awesome to give and receive ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) in this game.
---
+ Huge, Detailed Map
---
    West V is gorgeous and sprawling with tons to uncover. The addition of multiplayer really doesn‚Äôt hinder the overall detail of the world you‚Äôd expect from previous installments.
---
+ Nice draw distance with minimal pop-up (X1X)
---
+ Atomic Shop currency can be earned by simply playing the game
---
- Inability to ‚Äúdrop and display‚Äù items 
---
   You‚Äôll need recipes for a lot of things, and junk items can only be displayed in Display Cases (This isn‚Äôt entirely a negative, just a disclaimer for the pro interior designers) 
---
   
---
About Fallout 1st..
---
   Some cool goodies and additional items that are fun, but aren‚Äôt required to fully enjoy the game. There is plenty of content to enjoy in the base game, and with the current deals on the game, you can‚Äôt go wrong. 
---
Is it for you?
---
   Having friends to play with is a plus, but the community has been killer. Super helpful and giving folks all over the place. You‚Äôll meet tons of people along the way. Servers are richly populated.
---
If you enjoyed past Bethesda Fallouts, you‚Äôll dig this.
---
Tl:dr: Great co-op game, nothing else really like it on the market. Hater‚Äôs gon‚Äô hate.
---
Instead of cheating and complaining. A good solution is to not play, instead of ruining it for people who still like it
---
A max level weapon with 3 beneficial perks. Anti armor, junkies,bloodied, furious or instigating are popular main ones. Add Explosive or quad capacity and Pair that with faster fire rate or some VATS benefits. Those arent all but some of the traits to look for. Its subjective to your build but since most people run identical builds it doesnt change much.
---
why should i? i can do the event alone if i want
---
Unarmed bloodied unyielding melee and bloodied unyielding commando are what Rio is likely referring to. Just be aware that getting the legendary armor and weapons for that requires a metric crapton of farming. You're better off going with a heavy weapons power armor build due to how easy it is to get that gear for  your first toon.
---
That's all good and said, but I get scammed a lot by teams that try and steal bulk, so sometimes a rooftop or hiding place is no option, especially if the scammers are good builds too, food is instant heal as opposed to atoms heal over time :(
---
Tbh they should do exp boosts every Friday night to Sunday night. And on the 23rd of every month increase that to 2-3x
---
I‚Äôm level 70 and only carry maybe 10 or less stims and 30 rad away. Depends on your build kinda too. Food can be more valuable than chem heals
---
I like having a shooter, and a melee character to choose from. Both are near 100 now, so I don't feel totally underpowered, and can pretty much do whatever I want most of the time. It just depends on my mood for which one I pick, and i get to make extra bullets for my shooter while on my melee character :)
---
its fun
---
Oh so they were able to restore the lost scrap?
---
That Fasnacht music was the best part.
---
This sub is fucking stupid and always bitches about stupid stuff I hate these kind of posts
---
Really?  
---
Have you been tracking the history of bugs in '76 ')
---
I got it solely for the ranger outfit.
---
I noticed often after returning from NW it will revert to the brown bag, until I'm on a new server or reset app.
---
I understand your quandary for the most part, but you can just turn off controller mode for fallout and use the wireless keyboard/mouse.
---
99.99999% percent of the population doesn‚Äôt care when you die (leaving approximately 750 people to care, which is still on a very very high end for average people. I would say only 7-10 really truly care, 5-10 are modestly upset, 10-12 more will likely think about it for a while then move on)
---
Is that character wearing Unyielding armor before getting into PA?
---
Lol my aussie bud has been mentioning this, glad to see its not just him getting uranium fever.
---
Lol, yeah, even public outcry doesn‚Äôt seem to motivate Bethesda into action
---
Obsidian/Interplay are the original creators of the Fallout franchise. Bethesda bought mpat of the rights, and then when Obsidian tried to make their own Fallout Online game a few years ago, Bethesda dragged them through the court system for a couple.years and got them to settle put of court for about 2 million, from what I read on it.
---
In Skyrim when a Dragon went below 75% heath it would Crash Land and finish the battle on the ground. I think it would be great if ScorchBeasts would at least land after taking the same amount of damage.
---
People will have varying opinions about what an ideal roll is based on the needs of their character build but overall it's an item with 3 highly desirable effects on a highly desirable item in it's class.  
---
So a bloody explosive 25% lower vats cost assault rifle is probably not god tier, but take those effects and put them on a fixer or handmade and a lot of people would call it god tier.
---
Oh, I know the reason why Bethesda does it.  I just wondered why Op, or anyone on that mod's team, would have ever assumed otherwise.
---
I farmed event 44/7 and got like 5 full sets of plans and many plans around 10 copies. not a single EMPTY RACK. Noone has it. it doesnt exist. Dont expect anything to work properly with Bethesda
---
This! If they don't enforce it every time, then it opens the door for the perpetrator to say "Well they didn't sue so and so", which sounds dumb but would actually be a fairly plausible argument, especially if paired with a "it's because I belong to x socioeconomic group"
---
Bethesda got an early copy of The Outer Worlds and thought the board were the good guys..
---
I mean, bloodied heavy weapons with a bloodied .50 cal does more damage than a non stealthed bloodied commando build. Stealthed bloodied commando does more, but it's not THAT much more dps. It also only gets good once you're running a full unyielding loadout, preferably with uny + ap regen, using stealth boys, eating AP regen food, etc. Even then staying in stealth isn't guaranteed on SBQ, and unelss you run full Uny + Sentinel, a stiff wind will blow you over. Rads are also an issue.
---
Unarmed uny/sent is also an option, but again, requires a lot of good legendaries to make it worth using, and is still very prone to dying.
---
Or, he could get a bloodied .50 cal, use emergency protocols in PA, never die, and do 80% as much damage while never having to rely on stealth. They're all viable builds, but the PA build is so much cheaper to run and so much safer.
---
I can't remember, I'll have to check on that.
---
Does wearing unyielding under cause some sort of special Stat error?
---
DM me your discord and I can add you to mine!
---
I realize this is likely impossible to answer as the chances you knew the exact amounts of your scrap is probably small but... did you get your scrap back? It did they just give you a bunch of scrap?
---
Sorry, I was a courier once but then I got shot in the head and buried.
---
Yeah now that they changed the price, the name of the game is keep up not catch up.
---
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
It's a bug.
---
Not everyone has it.  I've never run into it, but several people have.
---
I want my gold fish
---
I cleared west tek for weapons then walked to a station and sold. Saved up 10k caps and bought a serum recipe (herbivore takes bone, fertilizer, ultracite, one flourencent flux) now I make serums and can clear vendor with 3 per character per day. Over 7k caps a day with little effort.
---
I wish I could, the only problem is I have no mouse rest as I have to sit so far back from my screen and desk. I may have to look into Xbox controllers with extra buttons, as a commentor said on this post, or maybe a keyboard controller hybrid if there is something close
---
Maybe also think about using L1 as a basic spin up like the real guns do. Theirs two triggers, a spin up trigger that will never shoot but be ready to at the instant the trigger is pressed. And maybe this will also make people running heavy builds with mini guns happier.
---
I carry around 30ea stims/radaway and 10 disease cure.. I also carry around 20 colas..
---
in my stash I keep around some blood packs and purified water (20ish)
---
pretty much everything else gets sold to the vendor when I do my daily caps run.. the exception being grape mentats which I use for the vendor buff
---
Yeah I probably should have but I didn‚Äôt want to give him the satisfaction, he eventually left but I‚Äôm not lying it was at least a half hr probably longer. I just threw out a few emojis every now and again but he was relentless, it was really funny to see him get so frustrated but at the same time it was some real low down unrepeatable stuff and I‚Äôm Irish so I‚Äôm used to some foul language lol
---
Could be controversial?
---
I would want the following:
---
"Enemies near"
---
"Stop shooting at a dog, you're giving away our position"
---
"Stop thirsting my kills"
---
"Stop striplooting everything we kill, or I'll let you die"
---
"We're literally in a gun fight right by your bush, please stop hiding, and help".
---
If they can make emotes for these, I would pay **money** for them.
---
Use traveling pharmacy (a strength perk) and carry them on you, you can hold 10x the amount you can rn in your inventory
---
You are not fighting against a pc player though if you are on console so both players have the same disadvantage .  Or is there a way to use a keyboard with a console?
---
Usually any weapon type that has these perks: 
---
For Melee: 40% faster swing speed &amp; +1 STR
---
For Ranged: Explosive &amp; 15% Faster Reload OR 25% Faster Fire rate &amp; 15% Faster Reload.
---
VATS God Rolls are not as sought after, but 33%+ Hit chance &amp; +50% Crit Damage or Crit meter fills 15% faster &amp; +50% Crit Damage.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking, at least he left those audio clips in the DM‚Äôs I suppose
---
Good idea, but if they really wanwant to retain players they will release the epic levels or whatever they announced awhile back. At level 200+ myself, xp to me is meaningless and there isn‚Äôt much more to hop online for.
---
Its fun to be challenged again tbh
---
Ok, boomer.
---
&gt; OP is operating on his feeling about what he or she wants and a hatred for the current company
---
Translation:  I WANT THIS THING AND IT IS EVIL NOT TO GIVE IT TO ME!  BECAUSE I WANT IT!  AND YOU SUCK!
---
I can try to dumb it down a little more, but OP has already set a pretty tough standard for that, so I don't have a lot of room to work with :P
---
Box wise, theres really not much you can do.  But, if you're the type that like to hold alot of aid in your person's inventory then make sure you rank up Traveling Pharmacy perkcard to a level 3 and have it equipped.
---
I highly suggest creating a second account for storage purposes though.  If you are a Fallout 1st member, or have a friend that is, then you can easily transfer things from your main account to your secondary mule account for later use.
---
Best of luck, hope you are enjoying the game.
---
Yeah it would definitely make the game more combat focused instead of hiding in a bush by the border. I suppose some could be controversial but overall good ideas.
---
They can license any or all of their work how they want without it affecting their other works.
---
True enough but this is a brand new player, he doesn't have access to a full set of uny gear, much less a full set of uny / ap regen / harder to detect while stealthed or uny / ap regen / sent etc. Though I'd argue that if you're running sent armor for a commando pve SBQ killer build, you have your priorities wrong, since if you're being hit, you're not in stealth, and if you're not in stealth, you may as well be running heavy weapons with power armor and doing more damage and taking zero.
---
Id expect these to have a purpose once Wastelanders drops
---
Their biggest disadvantage is they don't have a mouse.
---
So constantly packing up your camp vs just having a tent? That‚Äôs a pretty big difference. If you just use a barebones base I get it, but some people spend a lot of time on camp placement.
---
&gt;The contents of your inventory does not change what you get. It seems that they are generating a seed server side and using that as a base for their randomized functions.
---
&gt;There are theories that the seed is tied to the character/account, however this is only speculation on collected drop patterns. Due to the way computers work there is no 'Totally Random', it just depends on how the seed is generated and what functions they are using. We do know its not based on inventory though.

Get to Quote myself YAY
---
I'm *mostly* joking about mine, but I definitely support getting some more communicative ones for NW.
---
No, I was just asking because some people who are newer to the game don‚Äôt realize that you actually unequip all your clothing when you get into PA. So, if your stats are temporarily buffed by Unyielding before you get in, those buffs will disappear once the PA is equipped.
---
Well tbh they ain't too bad
---
I have a PC dude, just with an Xbox controller plugged in. There is also no option to use keyboard with my screen size
---
Yes they prob dont care at all about inappropriate or disgusting language.
---
Targeted harrassment or hate speech are totally different beasts though. I remember they banned a streamer at launch for his harrassing a player and justifying it as cleansing the wasteland of homosexuals or something like that.
---
If i remember right he even saved the stream so beth had little problem finding evidence.
---
I would think a game pad and joystick would be a subcategory of controller.
---
Yes it was. 3:00 am in game time.
---
Yeah the clips were rude and vulgar but not half as bad as what was said in game. Actually I just remembered he told me he reported me on some forum, said he told them I scammed him. I missed what site he was talking about but I either way that will tell you the calibre if individual I was dealing with.

I checked any strength mods on the power armor too, none.  It just seems odd to me that is does this.  I'll have to check what armor I'm wearing, I am almost positive I don't even have any armor that has any +1 strength on it.  I have several mutations, but it's almost like wearing the excavator armor nullifies class freak completely.
---
I use xbox one enhanced Wired controller. I also have the buttons in the buttom of the control to open the wheel if i need it and switch weapons using my pinky finger and never having to move my thumb off the joy stick.
---
Your build has a lot of flaws and will struggle to output the damage you need to thrive endgame.  
---
The only way to make it work with both shotguns and melee and explosives all in 1 build is generally going to be with super high end equipment which as a new player you won't have.  
---
As a new player my advice would be to pick one option and run with it.   
---
Also if you want to use heavy weapons, power armor is required to take the best perk available for this weapon class "Stabilized".  
---
Here's an outline of a generic heavy weapons build that will also be good with explosives with 3 points to spare to customize:   [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d334f69&amp;d=sr2s32sq2pe2eh2ib4ic4id1ip2a72a12lu2lt2l71s21s01ls0cu2c60&amp;w=c72&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d334f69&amp;d=sr2s32sq2pe2eh2ib4ic4id1ip2a72a12lu2lt2l71s21s01ls0cu2c60&amp;w=c72&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)   
---
A melee build can omit power user and stabilized as it doesn't need PA as much as heavy weapons do but as a new player I think the above build is a good jumping off point to learn the game with.
---
An more exclusive stuff to 1st.
---
Variant 5/5 Pumpkin Rack doesn't exist. You can stop looking now.
---
Richard is actually very restrained when it comes to bad language Lol
---
Good source of 5.56 when you blow up a teammate's turret ;)
---
Make a lvl 5 mule with all three Traveling Pharmacy perk cards, transfer said chems via courier, voila!
---
Same for Imposter Sheepsquatch. I inadvertently solod her when nobody showed up to my pop. I just activated the three pylons and shot her as much as I could until I died. Took only four deaths before she was done for.
---
I'd be too lazy to get the ingredients. I can't even bring myself to boil water. :)
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, thanks.
---
It‚Äôs a re-skin for the Ranger outfit and helmet that came with F1st. 
---
If I recall correctly, it makes the greenish helmet more brown and the brown jacket more green.
---
I do agree with this. It seemed that every couple of days (real time) I could find them. Now is seems about once a week I find them.  I look whenever I see stars in the game.
---
Ya I forget which floor. But you can see through the door. There‚Äôs a laser that spawns on the shelf and a fusion core you can see.  If you want I can show you. I‚Äôm on now gt: Anna Hilfe
---
Be careful you‚Äôre more likely to get scammed than for this to work
---
Try setting your food and drinks on the up down lift and right slots for easier use
---
It depends somewhat on your playstyle and the perks you're willing to take.  Investing 3 ranks in Thru-Hiker means you can carry all your food and water with you.  Likewise if you invest 3 ranks in Traveling Pharmacy you can carry your aid items in the hundreds for selling and using.
---
So how much is the minimum for stimpacks and radaway to survive a fight?  I only need about 10 stimpacks and 5 radway at most for the Queen fight for my rifle characters.  On my power armor stand there and take it characters I've gone through 20 stimpacks.  If you're going after the fake Sheepsquach robot in power armor, prepare to die a lot and use 50 stims.
---
Anytime üòÉ!
---
I thought this is what people do to avoid that. Oh god....
---
This is great. I‚Äôll try this!
---
Prefix: Bloodied (PvE), Junkies (PvP or hipster PvE), AA (Both, but less effective)
---
Major: Faster Fire Rate (all), 50% VATS Crit (Rifles), Explosive (all), 
---
Minor: 15% Faster Reload, 90% Weight Reduction (mainly for heavy weapons), 25% less VATS AP cost (highly desired in combo with 50% VATS Crit on Rifles)
---
Mix and match, depends on weapon.
---
Ooof. Ya, playstation still usually takes it serious. They may only give him a soft ban of a couple days or so, but often times that's enough to let someone know they were out of line. Each subsequent offense has worse consequences, until PS finally takes away their account.
---
It's been a year and we still don't have pepperoni rolls, the iconic food of WV. They are known for lasting a long time and being ready to eat. Literally the most obvious Fallout food. I doubt we'll see egg nog.
---
Yeah that makes sense. 
---
Back when Final Fantasy XI launched on PS2, there was a full keyboard with a split PS2 controller on either side of it. Something like that would be great. But you may still run into the issue where the keyboard gets disabled. I really wish it wouldn‚Äôt do that, so you can swap whenever you want. Sometimes I like to lean back and wander with a controller but swap to KB/M for intense fights. 
---
Another option might be a steam controller in KB/M mode.
---
Here‚Äôs a rough build based on shotguns and explosive stuff. 
---

---
There‚Äôs still 2 points to play with. I focused more on damage and less on defense. And also left out perks that are affected by PA. It‚Äôs not the best but it‚Äôs a good start. 
---
I have a similar character/build. But she‚Äôs using the broadsider and auto assault rifles.
---
I am sending you a PM currently, this is the wrong sub.
---
I think the opposite. More people will play the game then, more potential customers, more demand, higher prices.
---
Data: " I think it's saying it loves you Captain"
---
That is a possibility, mind you "controller" wasn't a word used until the PS1"controller" was invented, but I could be wrong
---
15 of each is my go to on stem and radaway but if im going to the blast zone i double it
---
I was on the right one but my post wasn‚Äôt long enough and now I can‚Äôt repost
---
Sell your stims, i think most people happily pay anywhere between 20 and 50 caps each when you‚Äôre like me and go through dozens in a session and can‚Äôt be bothered to grind
---
This only happens to me when I play adventure mode without mods (I play on PC), which is ironic.
---
I found the couriers page on fbook tho
---
And they are also dickheads
---
At low levels it's not easy to control the instinct of hoarding them because you can't craft them efficiently yet. There's been a point where I had on me almost 2k between full stims and diluted ones because of how common they are later in the game, especially from certain dailies.
---
But there are alternatives. Stimpaks are a good way to make caps. Sell them to bots, and sell purified water as well, and use healing salve instead, it's very easy to make loads of them with the Forest recipe. Otherwise if you enjoy the power of full stims sell healing salve and use stims, it's up to you. Know that healing sakve is only as effective as a diluted stimpak, which might be more convenient depending on your planned build, and they use the same hotkey as stimpaks as well. 
---
RadX is absolutely worthless. If you have mutations it supresses them, and other things work better without this drawback. Sell every last one you find.
---
Many players sell the recipes for Stimpaks and Radaways for a few hundred caps, and you should buy them as soon as you can. It takes very little to craft them and even less once you have access to the Chemist and Super Duper perks. Once you are there you can even carry no stim or radaway at all, having the ingredients in your stash is easy and you can craft them from everywhere in the world that has a chemist bench (healing salve can be cooked at a cooking station as well).
---
I can't tell you much about the other chems because I don't use them much, but I often craft them just for selling them either to bots or to restock my vending machines for the occasional Junkie visitor.
---
i think i know which room you mean! im at work or else id take you up on your offer, so thank you for offering, that was nice of you
---
im gonna start checking that room too!
---
my psn id is FritoZ, always looking for nice people out there in the wasteland!
---
It can be hard at first, but if you keep at it with good friends this content can be very enjoyable. Even solo when you get the hang of mechanics. My team doing back to back since week 1 and we realy enjoy the content. Really hope vault 96 is open for business soon.
---
And yeah rewards could be a little more apealing and stability also(even with PS)
---
Level 25-35 is when a lot of people quit in my experience, you aren't high enough level to do the hard stuff but you've done most of the easy stuff and the Ash Heap, which is where you should be heading is just so boooring. It's why I always encourage people to take time in the low levels. The game really opens up once you hit level 50 and you can start looking for end tier equipment and don't have to constantly worry about dying in every battle.
---
As for double XP, there are ways to get more XP without it. Put more points into INT, do the Mothman lighthouse quest, take some chems and make sure to sleep before you go to an area with lots of enemies that's doable for your level. Super Mutants are a good source of XP, so hit up Huntersville or one of the other places where they spawn. It's probably best to avoid West Tek until you're higher level.
---
Double XP weekends are great though and should be frequent enough to encourage playing but not to just become the norm.
---
That‚Äôs just silly. I don‚Äôt want to have to switch characters to do a transaction there is no point. You all did that to yourselves.
---
That true, i currently have a 1st subscription, but if wastelanders turns out to be a shit bag im gonna sack it in and probably wont bother playing rhis game entirely after that, might end up just hopping on for anything new they do drop and head off again
---
They are just buttholes. Not giving them satisfaction is best, but block now and you won‚Äôt ever have to worry about them.
---
These are the kinds of people who, when they grow up, make a bookstore business and glare at everyone who comes in.

Ditto on the curtains. Also the shower and the fireplace set.
---
I consider a KB and mouse controllers and they definitely don't fall under game pads.
---
I'm level 219, carry about 100 of each ....,
---
 inert flux as water, stimpacks and radaway and radaway diluted.  No radx as it bad for mutations ..Carry about 100 dog food and a few of each of other items .... mentats, nuke cola etc
---
Thank you so much!
---
It‚Äôs already bogging down. I‚Äôve seen countless outfits up for sale with no replies. I think the window is closing fast. Everyone that wants one has them.
---
Ah. Thanks for the clarification. I couldn't find that much information on the actual Github FAQs.
---
Basically it starts with a major damaging prefix, the strongest currently are Bloodied for low health builds and Junkies for full health builds.
---
Then it depends on the weapons and the users' preferences, say usually on melee weapons you'd want Swing Speed and STR, but for some weapons like the DCG or Meat Hook, Power attack damage might be desired as well.
---
On ranged weapons, it really depends on your perks, say if you are using VATS build, you would like all VATS related effects, such as +50% crit chance and +15% crit refill; if you are using demolition expert, you'd like explosive; if you don't use both mentioned above you'd want fire rate. Some people who are not using VATS build but too lazy to aim might want both fire rate and -25% action points cost on VATS.
---
I may have a picture and I will look when I get home. But when crouching you have a what looks like a sword sticking out of your chest. If you use the photomode and view your player from the front you see tears near where the collar bones would be and viewing from the back there are tears where the shoulder blades are.
---
If anything it‚Äôll be introduced with vault 94 raids since that vault is suppose to be a raid and is apparently completely frozen on the inside
---
Practice makes perfect!
---
I gotcha. Definitely a disadvantage then.
---
Good ideas
---
On the wheel?. I have tried that, if you meant on the wheel, but it's not fast enough if your against a bloodied build, sometimes the wheel stops activating all together too if you're being melee'd
---
They have not granted any sort of replacement ‚Äúscrap‚Äù
---
I can straight up tank her now, while using all 3 pylons. Just have ot keep a diluted stim active.
---
We definitely need more emotes that rivals can't see. For some reason, the help and gift emotes can be seen by rivals.
---
I got nothing.
---
It's been happening since I done that's quest where you gotta play the instruments
---
Wow, really? I had no clue those could be seen.
---
Here you go. Google found this. 
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/N0l2x
---
That sounds interesting, may have to invest in something like that. Especially for MMO style games that need a fair amount of buttons
---
I think they may see is as all dupers are not created equal. All though with F1st these dupers have a place to store unlimited steel.
---
&gt; A lot of people kind of gave up ... but we paid money for this product and we have a right to demand from Bethesda to do something about it!!! 
---
Maybe you should ask to see all their supervisors??
---
Yes, it can all be traded.
---

---
This is my current build. Wearing mostly vanguard and one chameleon scout armour. But will be switching over to the same effects as wood armour. 
---
Weapons are: instigating lever, vampires laser rifle, furious combat knife.
---
I believe that you type "Courier!" and one will answer
---
Yep I think you‚Äôre right
---
Yea, I kinda understand why the gift emote can be seen by rivals, as it is in the same spot as the taunt and PvP emotes, but i don't get why the help emote is also seen by rivals.
---
20 -40 radaway 20 purify water sell everything else
---
Ahhh lol I‚Äôm on Xbox !
---
I really enjoy starting again from nothing. Game gets way too easy at end game with all of my god roll gear. If there was a "seasonal" or "ladder" mode where you could start over from scratch with everyone else, that had interesting new mechanics, unique rewards, etc., I'd be all over that. I've thought about organizing a "purist" legit community that only plays with others on a private server with no outside trading. Requires new characters, transfer nothing from your other characters. I think that would be a blast.
---
asking for build advice without posting your build is not advised.    
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is great. But you know what I still want? Snow.
---
Glad to know people are paying premium prices for "investigating" 4 month old bugs. Your boss company is a disgrace
---
None.... As a bloodied build your health should be very low, if you get hit it should kill you... If you take rads most likely will kill you the idea is not to get hit and not to take rads
---
If you play on pc just use your keyboard and mouse?
---
If you plan on using heavy guns, you miss out on a significant accuracy/penetration boost that can only be used in power armor. Shotguns aren't nearly as effective as they used to be, so ideally you would use the shotgun to ground the Scorchbeast (or cripple the Yao Guai, Deathclaw, Megasloth, Fog Crawler etc.) And then switch to your heavy gun to finish them, or you could spec into VATS and crits and then use that to boost the shotgun damage enough to be relevant. 
---
Also, the best advice I can give for builds is pick one weapon type. If you want to be able to compete against anything you run across, you need to specialize in a specific weapon class. Otherwise you'll just end up as mediocre in the end. I think that was the goal, unlike FO4 or Skyrim where you could eventually be a master at everything, this game has limited amounts of perk points, which forces you to soecialize to get the most out of your build.
---
With the card system though, you could build up other cards and swap them out. Shotguns, heavy weapons, and melee all use Strength, so you could max out all of them eventually, and then swap out as you decide you want to use different weapons. Shotguns for leveling/grinding, heavy weapons for boss events like SBQ or Encryptid, melee for when you don't want to waste your ammo.
---
make a new character with a totally different build.
---
That does sound cool
---
Its pretty good controller base black is $20. You can getting the wireless version for $80 but gamestop carries the wired version in different colors. And remember if your on pc most likely your playing against a modder and fallout now has a mod out for auto eat
---
You can probably get by with just 1 point in Gun Fu. You‚Äôll lose a little damage but I‚Äôve never noticed it being enough to really matter
---
We need content, legendary players, perk loadouts. Xp event is useless if you reach level 300 and have nothing to do.
---
Carry diluted stims and 10 diluted radaway. **Aid is too heavy to stash.**
---
Scrap them repairs, craft ammo, mod armor/weapons.
---
Mags and bobbleheads are cool in aid. Keep those
---
it was enjoyable for me (when it worked, ps4).  my only "criticism" is that it was a little too hectic to be snapping pix, haha
---
With good inventory management I see no need to use it.
---
happens to me alot, been there for months
---
yeah just get the perk card that reduces aid weight, or armor that does, and carry them.
---
There is a tremendous reason to put these things behind a paywall... because people are willing to pay for them.
---
IF the scrap box and tent were available for everyone then there would be whinging that the servers weren't free. It doesn't matter a fuck what Bethesda do there will always be whinging.
---
The campfire event is part of the public event rotation, so you cant start it by entering the area anymore. Under world challenges (I think) you'll have a list of tasks to do to obtain badges. It's quite the grind though...
---
Just be happy it's not the mayor of Grafton
---
Psn is imaloserbaby68. I have a melee toon at lvl 99, and a shooter at 90. If my wife is watching TV next to me I have my mic off, and if she is playing I keep it on in party chat. I'm more than willing to follow around and help out, and turn on chat if I need to when she is watching TV. I'm 50, and mellow most of the time, lol. Usually play around 7 ish wst
---
I wouldn't carry more than about 30 stims, maybe 20 radx and radaway. If you aren't using traveling pharmacy or weight reduction armor then it's a lot of weight.
---
It does break pretty fast, but not prohibitively fast, unless the server is laggy. then it'll register a ton of hits on dead enemies, and degrade easily 3 times faster.
---
I could see some related content being associated with 1st, but the map changes and implications are going to be much much too large for Wastelanders to be set up as solely F01
---
Was going to post this too. Assuming 5 weekly challenges at 50 atoms each (they aren't), and 5 daily challenge at 20 atoms each (they are also not), I come up with 350 atoms. If we value atoms at $1 = 100 atoms, I get $3.50. But I guess with the caveat of 'like' I suppose we could call this hypothetical scenario a valid approximation?
---
I've also had a professor tell me I must not be too good at math. So there's that.
---
I bought and still intend to buy fallout 1st 
---
that said I think the tent / scrap box should be for all players
---
the costumes emotes private servers and atoms should go to 1st players
---
*knocks on door
---
Hello, would you be interested in hearing about The Cult of Mothman...
---
You could obtain badges from that "scout" events/quests for about two weeks after release of ever upwards patch, but after that two weeks BGS broke these quests and you couldn't get any, they release some patch to repair that, but it doesn't work so I don't know what....
---
I had it mostly happen on a new character while it was under level 30.  Mostly for resources, recipes, and pve defend events.  Eventually just quit bothering since it just caused more grief then it was worth.  Folks like to cry PvP, except it's so unbalanced it may as well be griefing.
---
Possum Challenges are still a thing to earn badges. Server hopping to hopefully get an event going when there is a very small chance the event will even give one. I did Campfire tales at least 10 times and didn't get one. In the time it took me to do that I did two Possum Challenges, and the two badge dailes(25% chance) and ended up with three.
---
Wow, I really need to read some tips on making caps. I tend to use all my stimpaks, water etc. by going to events and my ammo too.
---
well too bad, but i do appreciate your advice, thanks again for the tip!
---
It's not usually the melee players who take the kills in this event. I have two weapons that I use, my axe and a rolling pin that I use to tag the enemies. I'll clear out the low level ones and then wave everyone over and get out of the way for the supervisors, that is if someone doesn't one-shot it from across the room.
---
I usually carry about 15 Stimpacks on me.  Any more than that and I start selling them.  Rad-X and RadAway are in a similar boat around 8.
---
You can use Traveling Pharmacy to carry more, but I find it's not worth the SPECIAL points.  I used to carry upwards of 60 Stimpacks, but when Survival Mode came into being, where you could lose Aid items on death, I downsized and ended up never looking back.
---
Hope it works out!
---
Same, I played some again for the Halloween event with a clean install.  It was crashing and freezing quite a bit.
---
100% this!
---
It took me a couple days before I tried a solo run, but once I discovered that the only robot you actually need to kill is the Legendary Sentry Bot it became a cake walk.
---
The extended event start timer was great because you could run the event in adventure mode, and then pop over to a private world and do it all again.
---
Still looking for that Plasma Grenade plan -.-
---
Even with the nerf on Campfire Tales, it is still the best way to get multiple badges a day. You can do the dailies, and those help chip away...however, if you want them fast, your choices are Campfire, doing the Badge Challenges under the World section (which do require a lot of running around) , or straight up buying a plan from someone (which can get expensive) .
---
I thought the story in GTA V was awful, worst out of the series. I beat it the same day it came out, it was very lackluster. GTA IV had THE best story in my opinion.
---
Any 3* pool hook, rolling pin, walking cane, or other RP-friendly weapons are my God rolls.
---
Turns out when you celebrate awfulness, every week is Hanukka!
---
People are dicks. Its why I prefer dogs
---
What he was saying, is he would stay regardless of the XP boost. Meaning, he's not being retained. He's just being appeased with offerings of "dem phat boosts".
---
What platform?
---
Didn't happen when MMO's hit the scene. Those video games literally built on paying to access it, ontop of the retail cost of the game
---
Most of the ps4 community seems pretty good.  It's just the "pvp" in adventure or grief friendly stuff that tend so draw the annoying folks.
---
LOL
---
Yes, personally. I have four toons levelled up, and enjoy the early game, although it is frustrating to have to hide from enemies you‚Äôd normally take with ease. It‚Äôs also a good way to vary your game.
---
They do work now, but the drop rate is between 10-25% depending on who you ask.
---
I only use diluted Stim packs and Radaway, as I don't ever need that much healing. (I just die üòµ)
---
Use Chemist to get 4 diluted per Stim or Radaway
---
I‚Äôm always amazed Bethesda knows it‚Äôs happening and can‚Äôt find players all of a sudden having 25k steel and wood...lol
---
Ironically the cost of steel is the same... go figure...
---
The private server is what I really wanted. I didn't buy it because a bunch of guys in my crew have it.
---
So since I‚Äôm mainly melee wit a smidge of rifle,
---
I‚Äôd want a meat hook wit FSS,etc...
---
&amp; for my rifle,I‚Äôd probably want a FFR/vats somethin or other,since I don‚Äôt do bloodied nor Junkie...
---
I like too keep my health high
---
Ya‚Äôll are the best,thanks again for the enlightenment.
---
Yer all A-1 In my book
---
Instigating LA, Instigating Gauss, and Instigating Sniper with an in-progress scout armor set for WWR/sneak buffs. The WWR is great for carrying random other guns to try out and hauling WesTek weapons for scrap.
---
Xbox lol I hardly ever see anyone selling them and if I do they're so expensive lmao
---
You can get badges from all 3 of the scout events: campfire tales, dolly sods and toxic valley. You can do the 2 daily but have to wait for campfire tales in the event rotation.
---
This was fixed. They do drop now.
---
Real Egg Nog should be made with Rum added.
---
That sounds really nice. :)
---
I would have been fine with its colour, it was the rockets that made me sigh. Really doesn't fit anywhere other than a kid's bedroom or comic shop.
---
If you're Bloodied, you have low health such that Purified Water can become your de facto "Stimpack."
---
I usually carry about 12-16 Stimpacks on me, and they only come out in emergencies.  Purified Water covers everything else, like restoring HP between battles.
---
It‚Äôs an upright bass
---
Build your alts, it‚Äôs great fun when a low level ghoul can kill you with one smack. Leveling up is the most challenging part of the game. Once you reach high level most creatures become too squishy.
---
Vintage Nuka Nog
---
Cool, friend request sent.
---
Their just a bunch of idiots looking for their next outrage target i wish admins here would ban them. Its just causing a divide that doesnt actually exist.
---
Need to join them from the social menu in game.
---
Just get Healing Factor mutation.
---
That's an Atom Store item if I've ever heard one.
---
Pro Tip:  Dont shoot at her in the air.
---
Definitely need one that says 
---
"I need the bullets that you just stole out of the box i was looting you ninnymuggin"
---
And
---
"You've stole my large crate 3 times. I'm about to shoot you."
---
Goto social menu in fallout 76. Once they make a private world you can join by clicking their name, and then join. It should say "FriendsName[Private]"
---
I had wanted Multiplayer Fallout in the Manner of 76 since Fallout 3, even if we had never conceived of Camps everywhere way back when. Options ever come up to turn your Dweller into a Ghoul or Super Mutant and boom, dreams are alive
---
I enjoyed it a while back.  Tempted to give it another go on private instance again.
---
It brings back a bit of challenge to the game, makes crafting useful again, and feels way more balanced.  The bonus to private is that first in zone tends to set spawn levels.
---
Nah, it was on PC, but that's exactly what happened.
---
No. I mean some people pull out their nice tablecloths and dishes for family. Some people might even have some Christmas decorations up already, including the tree. Specifically people whose families can only stay for one holiday. But those people usually pick Christmas to do together, not Thanksgiving. It's really a minor holiday. I think a lot of people use it as a planning session for Black Friday.
---
Thanks ! That should work, will try it.
---
Yeah i believe everything should be cosmetic. I don't believe the scrap/repair kits should be in the store but at the same time they really don't effect me. I know where to scrap my junk and have so many Improved repair kits.
---
Regular ps4 my end, and event was fine for me with no crashes or freezes. FPS was piss poor but thats to be expected with 20 players blowing up cars
---
Oh I've farmed 94 haha. Have my pa and solar. No interest in the thorn. And don't really care about rerolling haha
---
Some kind of bug involving a mixup with the notification sound and the guitar, I guess
---
Well, Fasnacht is the end-of-winter event in March. Wouldn't be at all surprised to see something for Christmas this year.
---
Inflation for one. Plus imo, I think there was some intent for people to use the barter system seeing as its a survival game so the use of ammo as currency was supposed to happen.
---
Guys please be nice to the messenger
---
I agree with everything except the tent being in the atom shop. They could have used the pioneer quest to earn it. Would have been good for a quest.
---
No, instead have to have double exp for NW and Adventure till Wastelanders comes out to give them to reason to hurry up plus help me lvl up as its harder to lvl up now that I am lvl 240 and would like to add some alts as I only have a 2nd one at lvl99.
---
They have not said.
---
With some good sweet rum.
---
oh well since Tshmack said so i better do it..... /s
---
your crap post actually inspires me to do the opposite
---
Ah so not looking like anytime soon then :(
---
No idea, but at this point I expect anything worth being excited about being behind a paywall now.
---
Yes people will always cry that's just the way it is. Do you believe if the scrapbox and tent were free it would be less of it?
---
Nuka Rum
---
Its the whole FO community. Never come across a community as toxic in 30+ years of gaming
---
Well that answers my curiosity at least.  Could just be a ps4 issue in general üòë
---
Depends on your build. If you're running power armor heavy weapons, absolutely take it because you will want to carry diluted stims, diluted radaway, rad-x, chems, etc. If you're running unyielding unarmed or unyielding commando, it's less necessary, because yes, if you take hits, you're going to die and you're doing it wrong.
---
Yup.  Ideally it will drop with Wastelanders.
---
I know, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, it won‚Äôt let me select it as my drop bag in the atom store anymore. It was working at one point, now it‚Äôs not.
---
I can jump on with that. That's all cosmetic stuff and if people want to spend money on servers they should get some extra cosmetics and emotes.
---
Alrighty then, Thanks
---
Why are you people still here. Hope mods start banning soon. So we dont have to have this negativity.
---
Very true. Caps are too easy to obtain, and there aren‚Äôt enough appealing cap sinks in game to spend on.
---
It's fun to try out different builds. I started melee/heavy guns and now I've got melee, heavy gunner, commando and a pistol guy. The different play styles and hunting for new gear is nice after min maxing a build.
---
Sorry , i'm german and didn't give a f on a lil rant
---
I'm proud never supported those liars but guess you all don't want to be told the truth.. i can understand your hurtings
---
And lastly, i didn't even checked if it is , because i dont wanna play an unfinished game..and btw - you can play pirated games online if thats the case you think it can't be pirated..right now it is not worth to be pirated with all this bugs/glitches and crap
---
wow , you must be bad in gta .. feel sorry for you
---
 Almost nobody sells it, it's huge grind of events in ash heap
---
low effort game gets low effort post
---
These people are just entitled or trolls trying to stir up trouble mods need to start banning them.
---
Do you get offended when complete strangers say mean things over the internet?
---
Run vaults, they work beautifully now on private servers. So much fun since I started running them two weeks ago. Kill the queen, it‚Äôs a blast trying to figure out a great build to solo her.
---
This is a great idea. I feel like gathering quests would be the easiest to verify. Maybe a collection of teddy bears, or have the player find and wear a specific outfit (mix and match different pieces), different animal hides, hide an item somewhere on the map and give the player clues to its location.
---
I don't. I miss Meat Week. Mischief Night got me yelled at because I needed stable flux and nuked it. People got really mad but, wtfever it's the best place to farm the components.
---
What universe was this in?
---
Catch me tethering someone to the sbq
---
But what do you do with all the ones you pick up? Just dump them? It doesn't take long to end up with a lot of weight in chems when you're not using traveling pharmacy especially if you happen to hit one violent night.
---
What a trash reply. My bloodied character takes many hits before dying. The only thing that can actually just get me is SBQ
---
Most likely around Wastelanders. Early 2020. I don't think there is an official date.
---
I'd say gear him up with some basic stuff at his current level depending on his build but make him earn his own legendary gear. At the end of the game that's what it's all about anyway.
---
And the paywall is a Private server with an 8 player cap, which is a considerably reduced potential load for the server processing, compared to a typical 76 public server with Camps spread across the map
---
I don't blame them when the vast majority of the replies to their comments are inflammatory.
---
I used whiskey with my melee character. And I carry a few whiskeys on my rifle build for when I‚Äôm over encumbered by a few pounds and want to fast travel.
---
Evil and creative. I like it.
---
I've done lots of RP on MMOs like World of Warcraft, and done a little bit of tabletop stuff. I'm all down for things like using text for RP, been trying to find others to do that since voice doesn't really work in Fallout for me.
---
I'd totally be down to help you out. ^_^
---
I usually show her my fatman and she lands.
---
I would suggest helping him out with the rarer mod plans as they can be a bitch to find but for the most part, I'd say let him do the work himself. He will enjoy it more. Just be his backup when things get rough.
---
And I don't buy into the age thing when it comes to gaming. My boy is 4 soon and he plays games daily. He's actually in his room playing GTA right now.
---
So the people shouldn't be mad that they went back on their "better communication" pledge? We should what roll over and let them do whatever they want to game and franchise people have loved for over a decade?
---
What, exactly, *is "legendary players"?
---
I don't believe everybody would go to their private worlds all the time. I can see a few people doing it who really want to play solo. I personally enjoy playing with other people and is actually the only reason I still play this game. I have been playing with the same group of guys for 10 months now. Everytime I log on they are in public servers still. The reason they log us into a private world is so we can run clean Vault Raids. We shouldn't have to do this because the game should have been stabilized by now.
---
Missing -25% AP cost to in vats. On some weapons with the right attachments you can hit zero AP cost per shot. That is godly.
---
Yes! I started over after 140 levels on my first character. Found out i missed so much the first time around. Also switched from pure commando to stealth sniper/ explosives. Now i got 2 lvl 100+ characters and know much more about the world around me. First time i was rushing through some parts of the world.
---
I'm curious to see what consoles people are using specifically. I experienced the respawn crash on two occasions. The first time was while the event was running. The second time occured after  it had already ended and I was still within the area. I run a base release Xbox One and it already would on occasion experience a frame drop. So my point of pondering is if all the activity, combined with a mass of players in one location is making the console wig out
---
Yeah that doesn't surprise me somehow lmao, I've been on that grind myself and I definitely won't be selling it if it ever drops
---
What system?
---
3 out of 5, which is also unfortunately how I‚Äôd rate the loot from that encounter.
---
Bethesda needs to hire you, ideas are awesome

Just making double XP isn‚Äôt going to get people playing more, especially high level players. If they want to play and need a challenge, you just start a new character. If people are bored and waiting on new content I don‚Äôt think they will come grind just for the XP (most people aren‚Äôt going to, yes a few players might). People that I know that are getting bored still play like once a week for a little while. 
---
But in all, I don‚Äôt think double XP is the answer to making more money, retaining old players, getting new players to come. The wastelanders update and DLC‚Äôs past that are going to be what either brings it or not much else ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Bloodied for PvP has been nerfed. Bloodied is a glass cannon build, designed to deliver extreme damage to eliminate the threat before the enemy can fight back. With damage capped at 110 per hit, Bethesda has converted Bloodied builds from "glass cannon" to simply "glass."
---
Likewise, explosive damage is extremely easy to mitigate to the point that it barely damages another player with the right setup for PvP.
---
I would like us to be able to fsvorite junk items so we don‚Äôt use them
---
Oh man...I want a big ballista like the dragon hunters in Dragonheart. Make it a deployable turret.../drool
---
Ew
---
The game is an unoptimised mess. Regardless of what you do to fix it. Reinstalling doesn‚Äôt work. Rebuilding database doesn‚Äôt do anything either. We really just have to wait until Bethesda decides to fix the crashes.
---
I‚Äôm actually in the minority, but the game crashed so much for me it corrupted my old hard drive and bricked my PS4. Reinstalling the OS didn‚Äôt work, so I had to replace the drive entirely.
---
I like the new helmet, looks better with the Enclave outfit. 
---
Not big in the coat either way. I spend most of my time crouching and it annoys me that the jacket ‚Äúdrags‚Äù on the ground. And yes, I know this is stupid.
---
You wont get banned for picking them up. This glitch has been well known for over a month and bethesda obviously isnt concerned with it since it. It's not as game breaking as the people that still to this day dupe BE gatling plasmas lol
---
Rose is certainly more developed than the rest, but she's nowhere near the complexity of NPCs from past games. Plus, you can't actually interact with her outside of turning quests in
---
Honestly all I'm hoping for is a reroll that let's me keep my learned plans and hopefully my stash
---
Anything beyond that is pure bonus
---
You dont get banned for buying from vendors. Its plausable denyability. All bethesda did to me was delete the item.
---
Dialogue trees is a different issue. I think she is more complex than at least half the companions in FO4
---
Good idea, we'll add it to the subscription - bethesda , probably
---
Don't forget the cranberry pie.
---
You shouldn't be shooting her in the air most of the time... but not for any of the reasons the people here are giving.
---
There's only anecdotal evidence that shooting her in the air stops her from landing, it's no more accurate than the people that scream about getting off of fences/the tank/etc so she has "room to land".
---
If her wings aren't crippled yet you should absolutely should be shooting her until they are... but beyond that the issue isn't bugging her out so she doesn't land but rather the ineffectiveness of it.  Because of the size of the SBQ people misjudge just how high up she is, she's well outside the effective range of the heavy weapons most people in the fight are using so all you're really doing is draining your own ammo for little return.
---
Beyond that whether she lands or not is just rng... until she actually bugs out and just hovers there for five minutes straight without even attacking.
---
My guess is PC if he's talking about no cheats.
---
Very true, not a VATS build personally, but I think most who are go for overall damage over AP cost per shot. VATS is a mixed bag, builds matter more to get the most from VATS.
---
Hunt down a vampire weapon (and) healing factor serum.  Those will reduce the number of aid items you need to carry.
---
If your stash is full of junk, try scrapping it.  The component parts weight less than the whole.
---
I try to hold 50, even though I know I don't need anywhere near that amount.  But it came in somewhat handy during Mischief night, as I didn't have to take a break to go farming.
---
Once you pick up mutations, you'll want to use diluted radx/radaway - full strength suppresses mutations, diluted does not.
---
Sell off the extra to bot vendors.
---
I started running nuke zones about level 27.  But it was a bunch of levels later that I discovered inert flux is drinkable and weighs less than purified water.
---
edit: nuka cherry removes something like 300 rads, and does not affect mutations..
---
Message me your discord info and I'll invite you after work. I'm always looking for new people to play with.
---
Not at all. They will just find something new to complain about. It's been the same since launch. It's actually that bad I've seen people on Twitter containing about it and in the next sentence say they don't even play 76 but are ESO+ members.
---
More likely and easier to work is that they'd effectively have two camps. One active in Public and the other larger active in Private. Private Camp effectivelly a compound, while the public functions like an outpost all things considered
---
What a trash person to respond like this lol if you do not agree tell your side lol.
---
I keep my health as low as possible as do many other people who use bloodied, you can do it differently with out being a dick about it.
---
Now I replied thinking about most normal players that do not have full unyielding combat bos fully modded because that is not the case for most players.
---
Sell them at vendors or stash them to sell at a later day
---
And watch the Lions play football. 
---
And some other poser teams.
---
Have an upvote, worm cowboy.
---
I‚Äôm not sure of prices, but I will offer 5k for a pirate hat.  And I paid 10k for my long pumpkin suit if that helps
---
You sell or stash them my dude.
---
True, but considering what we make with it, that‚Äôs more of a Lawry‚Äôs Seasoning Salt kind of spice.
---
Exactly, less people, larger camps. I feel like alot of people have forgotten about the days of the weight exploit and how Youtubers and their followers abusing it would cause crippling lag for any player around them
---
Lol not in the slightest, but you didn‚Äôt hear the things he was saying and I just worry that the next person this guy meets might not be in the right mental head space and could take this guys advice.
---
Because they were acting entitled?  
---
It's really nice that Bethesda decided in the end to make this a free gift but the people that signed up for 1st have been bitching about there not being any promised "exclusive discounts" in the atom shop and these reskins were literally both exclusive to 1st members and at a discount compared to what they would have cost if they'd been up in the shop for anyone to buy.  Bethesda actually gave them an exclusive discount and the response was to get pissed off about why they weren't getting even more stuff for free.
---
It's not the first time there have been color reskins in the atom shop of previously released items and none of them have ever been given away free to the people that bought the originals.
---
The people that bought into 1st were specifically promised and delivered the Ranger outfit that they all got.  The ONLY mention of ANYTHING additional coming in the future was the exclusive discounts.  People that bought into 1st knew this and yet when that discount arrives their response is to demand they get more free stuff.  If that isn't entitlement I don't know what is.
---
That would be awesome with party boy
---
To a lot of us, leveling up means nothing anymore.  I have 40+ level ups to spend still.  This game needs a paragon/pretiege system badly.  Pushing back legendary perks was the most disappointing news of the year to me.
---
Making leveling up fun again!
---
Is this buffed with chems/food/alcohol? I'm not hitting quite that hard with my bloodied gatlin but its only a 1star
---
*edit*
---
I have nerd rage and adrenal and the full damage boost perk cards what am I missing?
---
That's the problem. I already can clear vendor caps after about 10 minutes of gameplay (curse you unyielding Charisma bonus) and would rather hang onto chems to sell to other players. Dang stimpacks weigh 1.0 each so I can never stash them.
---
Diluted stimpacks heal for 20% burst healing which is all you need if you're also using Nerd Rage and weighs half a pound each. You can carry 40 and that's only 20 lbs. Just replenish from your stash/survival tent after using them. Another good suggestion was Purified water which heals 25% over time, also at half a pound each.
---
I'd recommend using Blocker in place of Traveling Pharmacy, as well as Serendipity, Lone Wanderer and Nerd Rage.
---
Yea but getting to relevel and rerun the quests too
---
Well you adked if i gotten any revenu from it, so here is the revenue. 250k caps from it
---
Totally agree.
---
I used to love this game now I just feel like an idoit who has waited a literal year for nothing. I hate myself for liking this game and investing so much time for nothing. Absolutely nothing. The only thing I care about are the people I met who played the game and now 90% of them dont even play anymore.
---
Exactly, the people shouldn't be mad that they went back on their "better communication" pledge. Why? Because they should be more understanding after seeing the constant responses that are intended to arouse angry or violent feelings(inflammatory comments). If people are genuinely upset about the game and want to see it improved, they wouldn't attempt to tarnish Bethesda's reputation in the process, they would express their dissatisfaction in a private message to BGS.
---
I‚Äôd be interested in a roleplaying version of this
---
If you get hit or take rads, it should kill you.
---
Yeah, that explained everthing I'm sure.
---
We already have the Hellfire Power Armor. It's an exclusive 'paint-job" for all power armor sets once you reach Rank 100 in Nuclear Winter
---
&gt;I haven't played since around Patch 11 and so glad I stopped then. 
---
If you haven't played since patch 11. I'd tell you that things have stabilized quite a bit since then...there were updates to PA, one would assume, and is rumored to be, to support legendary PA, but it's not like it was a huge inconvenience,  you just had to requip the armor pieces to the frame. There was a glitch that could freeze up the game when getting out of PA in certain situations,  but that has been fixed for a whole now...
---
This subscription works the same as the elder Scrolls online and I've been expecting it since launch. They'll probably add in the future a way to expand the stash by paying caps or atoms and this will bring back some of those who left because the scrap box is such a betrayal to the community.  I'm quite sure of that. I'll probably do this myself when wastelanders will come out, which will be the best time to announce a bigger stash for everyone. Because, that's the plan isn't it? I'm just saying.
---
I was easily selling those plans for 1k caps, and each of those outfits for 10k.
---
Edit: pumpkin short and long, ws jumpsuit, pirate suit
---
Find a legendary armor with the effect to reduce aid and chem weight by 20% = 0 weight for everything!
---
spiced Nuka Rum.
---
I expected private servers to cost something.  That's how it has always worked, going back to my Battlefield 2 days. I did not expect the "private servers" to be existing game instances on Bethesda's infrastructure with virtually no options or controls for the people paying for them.
---
QOL and convenience items should not be locked behind a subscription. Period. Moreover, it's rather arrogant of Bethesda to expect more money from the player base after having delayed their first major content update and with the game still being as rough as it is a year after release. The number of issues that linger, along with the number of issues Bethesda introduces when patching or adding content makes 76 continue to feel like an early beta. The whole game feels like it is buckling under it's own weight. Performance is middling even on solid hardware. And then they have the nerve to snatch up community suggested features and lock them behind a sub fee? No thanks.
---
Because I purchased it for full price believing the developers that it would be supported by cosmetic only micro transactions. Because since BETA we can't have more stash due to the game not being able handle it, now it's hid behind a monthly pay wall
---
There are some areas on the map you can build your camp at, set up an extractor, and farm tons of lead.
---
Sounds delicious
---
On more levels than the game, that's for sure.
---
Wellwhen i logged on first thing in the morning i saw that for fallout 1st players they gave us a skin for the ncr armour. Well both me and my teammate saw it was for 500 atoms. But later that night when i got home it was free. So my post doesnt really matter now.
---
You know I actually was curious on how to get th Hellfire power armor, thanks for letting me know about that. But I meant a powet armor set as a whole for adventure mode not just a 'paint job'
---
The nuke silos have a gym each with lead.
---
Longtime quitter over their bullshit here... last time I played was during a double xp weekend. Not sure I'd reinstall though now they've gone full scammer mode.
---
Lucky hole, but you‚Äôll need to do some leveling before going into that
---
There are lots of items that contain lead. The wooden blocks are 1. Tag lead for search. I pick up everything and scrap. I never have lead issues
---
Are you on pc ?
---
I noted where people spawn on my cliff side build and actually installed a fortifaction behind that rock lip. Just incase a player takes a step backwards. Specifying spawn zones would be great
---
Teach a man to fly fish... And hell probably starve
---
What aid items are you hoarding? Drugs, water, Rad-X, RadAway? Stimpacks? Food?
---
Lol, I answered his question regarding how many stimpacks and the reason why I carry minimal so yes i did infact explain everything pertaining to the question he asked. 
---
But thank you for... No valid input.... It sure has helped.
---
They aren't hiding, but they are indeed pretending as if the 1st outrage never happened.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker
---
It was something along the lines of, if you are 50 or higher you can go back to level 1 and you get some type of benefit for it. That was the extent of what I knew - nothing about what the benefits could be, what you kept/lost, etc.
---
Shoot the mines.
---
Lucky hole mine. You can collect a lot of Lead ores. Wear an excavator PA to collect twice the amount.
---
I would have bought the subscription had it been like you said. I can't understand the future of this game though with Pay to Enjoy mechanics. Where does it end? Where's the next fee? I don't know, so I have to wait and see. 
---
Fwiw, I was spending 15 a month in atoms before. The price really doesn't bother me. I just don't feel paying for Fallout 1st helps this game become a game I'll enjoy more.
---
Lucky Hole Mine
---
- you find lead ore and then smelt it into lead
---
- will give you 200-300 lead + other metals
---
It's letting you know a perk activated. It's an audio cue.
---
It's the bass cello thing for me.
---
Be more understanding after they have lied, used shady tactics like stealth nerfs, stolen community suggestions to monetize, and ignored any complaints for the whole duration of this game. Be more understanding when we still have bugs from fucking launch that have never been fixed. We still have bugs from previous games that got fixed by modders but Bethesda couldn't be bothered to fix. Nobody is tarnishing their reputation. People are pointing out all the stupid shit they've done. Bethesda keeps doing more stupid shit to tarnish their own rep. Also private message them? They don't listen to public feedback what makes you think they just won't ignore private messages. Jesus I have never met somebody that is this much of a shill and is this blind.
---
They would take the flamer and cryolator and move them from almost useless to 100% obsolete.
---
It would have been great if the game was only heist missions
---
I doubt they are rushing it. They intentionally delayed it till next year so it looks like they are trying to do it right
---
I run Breach and Clear every time I see it on the map. You usually get a good amount of lead ore from that as well as other ores. Smelt it down with super duper and I usually end up with upwards of around 75 lead scraps per run.
---
Hackers only server
---
I'll give it to you for free tomorrow when I'm on..
---
I do love the whitespring jumpsuit of you want to give it to me cool if not I'll still give you the suit
---
Cans of any kind (can, tin can, aluminum can, disarmed can chimes) contain lead, as do pencils, rat poison, paints, and probably a number of other items, including weights that can be looted from gyms if other people did not do so already.
---
This completely defeats the purpose of playing on a private server, though,  doesn't it?   If I ever decide that I do want to play with others, I will just go back to the regular adventure mode.  I, for one, am enjoying being the only human on "my" planet... üòÅ
---
I've heard good things about the comparisons between AA, FFR and Explosive. I do believe the consensus without hard numbers is FFR beats out both AA and Explosive. FFR delivers more rounds at base dmg than the added dmg by bypassing armor or adding explosive dmg.
---
Edit: would love to find a FFR lever to do some testing.
---
Well AP reduction is in the third star slot, so there are no competing damage prefixes. You can have your BE or AAE or FFR or whatever for damage and then -25% AP costs in addition. It completely removes the need to worry about AP refresh gear on certain weapons. I can sprint all I want into a fight and be able to vats everything down so long as I have a single AP for activation cost.
---
Yeah well this is as easy a a press of a button to help facilitate the flow from content to content
---
Wasn't armed.
---
Haha, aren't we all... üòñ
---
Funny enough for FO4 I made a mod for the harpoon gun that does the opposite of this. 
---
Instead of a rewinding tether - the pull works the opposite way - it‚Äôs a grappling hook that pulls you towards the contact point. 
---
Great for melee and snipers
---
Twice but still fun.  The second time was just as I was trying to grab loot from legendary sentry.
---
Not in my eyes. I use private servers to avoid random people, but I'd still play with friends.
---
I have a pile of junk by the river I built the machine on i did not realize I could get lead like that.
---
None of mine are playing anymore, and I'm finding that I am OK with that.
---
I'm so tired of people trying to reach out to Bethesda on here lol.
---
That's true. I'll poke around New Gad and look for some stuff to do around the area.
---
Ouch.
---
I have a full rack, reaper cutout, alien jack o lanterns, and practice jack o lanterns. I‚Äôve already gotten the suit though
---
I have raider power armor can I use that when I find a mine
---
Its alright, cheers.
---
With my fully optimzied toon, my BE gatling gun gets to I want to say \~700-800 damage per shot on paper before adrenaline. Keep in mind this is primed as well. I make up for the loss of the speedy receiver by using a manual shoot macro that shoots even faster than a speedy receiver. With adrenaline and chems, I think I can hit 1200 per shot. Definitely always one shots max level super mutants though. I'm not usually big on explosive weapons, but in this case, it really shines.
---
The same could be argued of BGS tbf
---
Anyone got a picture haven‚Äôt hopped on in a couple days
---
Once you start using Lucky Hole mine you wont bother with anything else. Requires acid to break down the ore but you'll get over 1000 lead from one run.  
---
Sugar Grove has tons of pencils. Watoga Highschool has a lot of paint, Wes Tek has quite a bit of paint on the roof.
---
[https://fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com)
---
You can find the nodes here
---
Read carefully.
---
I think 1500-2500 seems reasonable if you actually want to sell
---
5k for a pirate hat???? Really?
---
[deleted]
---
All the childrens toys are painted with lead paint.
---
If they listened to public feedback they would of released a statement on fo1st or not even done it, would of never implemented more utility items in the atomic shop, and would of fixed half of the bugs that have been around from launch. What makes you think they do listen to feedback considering they never bother to respond?
---
&gt;would probably change my handmade to using .308 ammo
---
Well, that would be a more appropriate calibre for the AK (handmade). Just saying!üòÅ
---
But you won't feel it because of the anesthetic.
---
&gt; Also, please make fusion cores and plasma cores on these guns to reload  ammo with lesser conditions like you've done with fusion cores on power  armor. Producing and carrying so many uneven fusion cores is not feeling  nice. TY 
---
This is why I dont use weapons that uses this ammo, its so annoying.
---
So bloodied is the best prefixed overall?
---
TSE shoguns now are shit scatterguns.
---
Use something without TS.
---
There isn't even much atomic shop crap to begin with coming out
---
I'm thinking of something but I'm not that sure since I didn't played on my PC since I moved last year. If you add the game on Steam as a non-library game (dunno if that's really called like that in English), launch Big Picture, go on the game's tab and check if there's an option like "controller settings". I know for sure that I was able to map crazy combination on my Steam Controller, I know Steam reconize Xbox and ps4  controllers now, but I'm not sure that you can map it like a Steam Controller. But if you can, you'll be able to do something like DPadUp alone = quickwheel in game, then in Steam's mapping DPadUp+any key = 1/2/3/etc.
---
I'm sorry if that doesn't work. Maybe you can find other softwares to do it, but since I used a Steam Controller, that's the faster thing that come to my mind.
---
Not arguing your point, I'll be first to admit I'm not the guy to talk to about VATS and have not dabled in any sort of VATS builds. You have to build your character for max AP &amp; AP refresh in order to benefit the most from God Roll VATS weapons...auto aim just doesn't interest me to solely focus on it, I like to do the work myself tbh. Please elaborate any further knowledge you have on the subject for everyone's benefit.
---
Just saw someone already told you about that D: sorry about that double posting
---
actually you'd just need both hands, but a full set with weight increase is convenient, I run it with emergency protocol all the time.
---
If you have traveling pharmacy you can carry as much as you want. I‚Äôm sitting on hundreds on my medic.
---
As far as dps, yes. You can get comically high dps with the right bloodied build. And with the right luck perks you can still tank some major damage while dishing out enough to one shot a legendary Sheepsquatch or Scorchbeast
---
I‚Äôve got over 1300 hrs on PS4. Switched to bloodied build around 200hrs in and still advocate that it‚Äôs the most fun way to play.
---
Everyone has a dead loved one, there simply isn't space for all of them. And if you can't do all of them, it isn't fair to give special treatment.
---
Dump the power armor and try full sneak standard armor with shadowed, muffled mods, enjoy the sneak bonus.
---
Anglers are quite the enemies, FireProof 3\* helps and tale out at range. Good loot.
---
I really doubt they are rushing to finish Wastelanders. They will try to figure out the new business model and look at all the data first. The game is barely making any money and Bethesda know it, so that is what they will do before releasing anything ‚Äúfor free‚Äù.  They may even delay Wastelanders once more.
---
Suggestions and stuff are cool. I'm just tired of all the complaining to Bethesda, theres like 10 posts about the same thing every day.
---
Not trying to say it's a bad place to do it just tired of seeing most of it.
---
There's a gym in the responders firehouse. There's a gym at Bolton Greens. There are four can alarm chimes at the amusement park in the southeast that I forget the name of.
---
Hit all that and you'll get over 400 lead scrap.
---
I‚Äôm not looking for any excuse. I enjoy the game and pay for the sub. But I‚Äôm not so up Bethesda‚Äôs ass to have no critique. Not that you are but man it‚Äôs as hot in here as a political thread. Opinions are so hard driven your not allowed to ride the line without being charred up. Sub Reddit‚Äôs use to be a great place for civil discussion.
---
Nuka Grape is the Rad-killer ;)  
---
but in all other points i'am with you! 
---
...btw - i had have the same prob with that inert flux :D
---
I maxed out demo expert when I got my BE handmade because I wanted the most damage I could get. While it did bump that up, I was killing myself left and right. I ended up taking it off completely and putting points in to Covert Ops and Serendipity. I did just get a BFFR handmade recently and I'm loving it. Not sure how much I'll use the BE now.
---
As rare as it is that it will block a camp placement you will also occasionally benefit by using the stash
---
Yes Bloodied does the most damage but you can die pretty easily as you need to be at 19% (or 9% if you're insane) health to get the most out of it. For full health builds, Junkies with 5 addictions and actively using damage boost chems is where it's at.
---
As for secondary effects you'll want faster fire rate or explosive.
---
It's the real end game tbh.
---
Started over with my wife, trying to level without questing. We are exploring, taking workshops, building camps... it's great, once we get to 50 we will probably continue on the questing route. We are having a blast.
---
Because I love fallout, I want Fallout 76 and the rest of Bethesda's games to get better, and I like having discussions and debates with people, especially when they use really bad arguments like "Why do you express an opinion I don't like? Why can't you just stop expressing your opinion so that I don't have to acknowledge that different opinions exist?"
---
Don't really enjoy explosive legendaries: it feels too magical. Explosives are fun by themselves, even when they cause less damage compared to almost everything.
---
Gyms for the weights (you can look up where on YouTube and/or Google), those hanging tin can traps, paint buckets or build a CAMP on a lead node and extracting it are your most efficient methods.
---
This is the OP's 2nd point -- the cores with the least charge should be used first, like what happens with power armor.
---
\&gt; nuka grape....
---
Oh, I didn't know that...
---
High level friend of mine taught me the nuka cherry trick.  Its easy to find and worked well, so I've never tried the others. 
---
Bottoms up :)
---
It‚Äôs a trade off. The game is easy enough as is why would you want to make it easier?
---
Yes, restarting is fun.
---
 Choose what build you want: Melee, Rifle, Heavy Weapons, etc. 
---
Then you can spec out the build using a site like this: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Hit up the Feed the People event for that Canned Stew for the bonus XP. Sleep regularly for XP boosts. Cranberry edibles also boost XP.
---
It‚Äôs not even in the atom shop for me so what evs
---
IMO the only thing you should get by paying is extra atoms every month in a bundle (discounted from buying the bundles outright), some cosmetics and possibly exclusive sales.
---
the scrap box with unlimited junk, the second fast travel/tent AND private server options should \*ALL\* be base game for all players.
---
You can keep it
---
Thank you for letting me know!
---
ugh, the server usually takes longer than your whole run just recognize that I'm putting the fixed cores in their slots
---
Thank you! I appreciate it
---
No problem
---
so you are still playing the game?
---
I love how people always try and get extra by threatening how not doing so would cause people to leave the game.
---
Should be called "Rad Nog"... just saying!
---
Well it's true that heavy guns don't work when aiming.
---
Just flip items other players sells. buy serums under 300 sell to NPC vendors for 400. Easy profit
---
One of the reasons I signed up for Fallout 1st is so my son and I could play together in our own private world to avoid the lag on public worlds.  I have 5 characters on my account.  I asked my son do you want to play along side with my high level character or one of my lower level characters.  He wanted both of us to start at the same level with no help from my other characters.  So that is what we are doing.  I basically point him in the right direction, give him some advice on best camp locations, and provide backup during fights.  I do know the spawn points for the crafting plans, so I helped him find the plans by placing a map marker and then he goes and finds the plans.  We are both having a blast and I can't wait until he levels up enough for us to fight the SBQ together.
---
In my head, that's what I sound like. But only in my head...
---
If you‚Äôre a sniper I would keep it. Any other build I‚Äôd ditch it for something else.
---
Well, personally it annoys me to no end when I'm in a battle, and have to sit through a long reload-animation while avoiding damage, only to have a core with 78/500 charges loaded in.
---
Wait... you have VATS in NW?
---
No actually this is very reasonable, they‚Äôve already delayed it to February/March just so that they can really work on it as much as possible before the holidays and fine tune it in the weeks afterwards so good on you for calling it out. 
---
I forget that as a gamer who gets heavily engrossed, games are a form of art, it needs time, it needs correcting, it needs rough drafts and backup references.. and we‚Äôre definitely in for something we didn‚Äôt expect come Wastelanders regardless of where we hold our standards
---
Some attachments on certain weapon types lower AP cost. An automatic receiver on a handmade, for example, reduces costs by 50%. Other things like a dot sight, quick magazine, aligned stock and barrel further reduce AP costs. All of those combined with the -25% AP cost legendary allows you to reach zero AP cost on any weapon with those attachments (also think 10mm and pipe pistol).
---
If your weapon costs zero AP to use, you do not need to worry about having high agility or AP refresh gear because you only need a single point to activate vats, and all shots cost you nothing. It eliminates the need to manage your AP. You essentially have an infinite bar during vats shots. That is what makes it god tier. 
---
My agility perk allocation is all towards damage from sneak attacks and adrenaline, gunfu. I use to use Action Boy for the AP refresh. I put those three points into more adrenaline damage ramping. So I also inadvertently increased my damage thanks to the legendary prefix by being able to remove my utility perks.
---
I believe the junk stash should have been a quest reward.  The tent came from 1st membership and the ranger outfit from the atom shop for everyone.  1st priced at $10.  Would have worked just fine for everyone
---
And you lose the ability to reload while crouching! jk
---
I had a similar issue a while back, but I would hear windchimes for any and all notifications.
---
Wouldn't retain me, I'd just play during Double XP and still not buy atoms or 1st.
---
Not disagreeing! I'm just surprised to see people surprised by the fact that the first thing they released was... a barely noticeable skin!
---
Personally, I am of the opinion that First needed less scrap box and tent, and more skins (preferably more like the PA skins than this one) tossed in. But that's (probably) just me.
---
And instead of you disappearing and ending up somewhere else your cloths do.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Wastelanders was already done, but they're waiting til around Christmas to release it as a way to tempt holiday shoppers into picking it up. Cause nothing really makes people look at things as much as being brand new or a major update...
---
Haha! You're a hero! All that suffe- er, playing!
---
1600's Europeans: "Did somebody say SPICES???"
---
My dad used to say my grandfather couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. Never slowed him down! Why should we stop??
---
I paid full price for it, doesn't seem free to play to
---
Even before wastelanders was delayed double XP weekends were the only reason I logged in. Now I'm just taking a hiatus until wasterlanders and playing The Outer Worlds instesd. At this point with wastelanders I'm not sure if even DBL XP could bring me back :'(
---
Assuming they don't yowl, you're probably better than you think you are! :)
---
This is not a record, when Fallout 76 first launched, we had a period of about 5-7 weeks of absence however that was definitely a result of the holidays for most of that time
---
Your welcome.
---
The best weapon is deleting that dumpster fire.
---
This. I wish I had thought of this. I need you to tutor me in your smart-assery!
---
I would drink the shit out of this
---
What do you play on
---
I bet they‚Äôll spring one on us tomorrow.
---
Probably an exclusive or heavily discounted skin for subscribers if they do, that‚Äôll definitely be a sought after piece for the collection
---
I thought that was grandma's special recipe.
---
Best part of the game is the early game.
---
But I bet the number of players triples with Wastelanders release.
---
Seems like a good time for this conversation! Like signing up for the vault just minutes before the bombs drop...
---
Digga, dann halt deinen Ball mal gaaaaaanz flach.
---
Was du hier abl√§sst ist schon kein Trolling mehr, sondern einfach nur noch peinlich.
---
Ausserdem kannste das Spiel nicht "raubkopieren", da du nen Schl√ºssel brauchst.
---
I had this idea recently, too. Either a double XP weekend or a themed event (Mischief Night, Meat Week, etc.) once per month would be awesome. It obviously takes more time to make an event, but if people know there will be a double XP week or weekend, it would probably bring some people in, at least for that time.
---
As long as it's free, you're good! Haha!
---
&gt; private servers 
---
private worlds are not private servers
---
have u done the "Nukashine" quest from Bif ?   
---
if not hury up \^\^  7 - 8 Various of Nukas wait 4 you ;)
---

---
I started over on a double XP weekend a few months back.  It was really fun because there was this whole "I wish I knew that when I started" vibe regarding perks and which junk to bulk/sell/drop.  What types of legendaries I should hang on to vs sell, what to buy when I see it and what doesn't matter, etc... 
---
One new thing I'm trying is I'm going to not use a single perk point/card until I get to a certain point.  Right now I'm thinking level 35 but we'll see where I land.  Right now I'm around level 20.  It makes it much more challenging with a huge reward for myself in the future to be able to spec all at once instead of wasting points on junk reduction, traveling pharmacy, whatever now that I'm more familiar with the game mechanics and where to farm certain resources. 
---
Of course, I'm just a casual and my main is only level 78 so I absolutely don't have everything "dialed in" by any means lol
---
Enjoy!
---
an actual private server allows you to do almost whatever you want with it, it could stay up 24/7 no problem
---
Same
---
I can only ever achieve a 15-20 kill game if I‚Äôm really feelin‚Äô it, and if my team is gone after the first couple minutes (nobody to compete for kills against lol)...usually only average about 7 kills per game. 
---
I get murked the rest of the time. Lol
---
acid isn't terribly difficult.
---
wendigo teeth, waste acid containers, suprathaw antifreeze, coolant caps, some insects, yogis...it burns, but you can get several just from hitting acid nodes (without an extractor)... rat poison (i think).  Some players sell it in their machines.
---
Oh, this is me predicting what Todd will say. You know, like Daft Punk says: "harder, better, faster, stronger". I never played Daggerfall, but I did try a couple of the old Fallout games, and may I just say: not bad! I was expecting some unplayable mess, and that is NOT what I got.
---
I think the furthest back my ES history goes is Morrowind. The skills and items blew my mind! I played it after Oblivion, and was significantly more impressed by Morrowind...
---
Look at Fasnacht stuff. 9 months later and no one is paying any higher than they were before if you can find anyone willing to buy it. I got burned holding on to that stuff. I learned my lesson on banking on an idea in the future when the game is constantly changing.
---
So one of the biggest incitements to buy 1st is the ranger armor and you wouldn't expect to at least get the extra paints/armor stages with it after paying that much? those 1650 atoms should be for spending on fallout 2nd class members atom shop, it's pay to pay. 1650 atoms is nothing also you can blow that on one shitty bundle.
---
Block as others have said but if it constitutes consistent harassment it could be seen as bullying.
---
I'd also report with as much info as you can. Your report alone may not do it but it could be one of a few reports this person receives that's enough for a temp or permanent ban.
---
mdr
---
From what I remember, every 50 levels you‚Äôll receive a legendary perk/skill point (I can‚Äôt remember which it is) to put into your build which carries over to any new and existing characters. So basically if your highest toon is level 525, you‚Äôll get 10 of these perk/skill point which your lowest level toon (can be literally just out of the vault) will have access to as well. But if you have a second toon reach level 50 for the first time, you won‚Äôt receive the extra perk/point because your highest level already unlocked it
---
You were the most mischievous by nuking it.
---
What about a fruitcake recipe? Razorgrain flour, spices, rum, sugar, mutfruit, blackberries, cranberries, tarberries, starlight berries, and firecracker berries (or some combination of berries).  Could be +1 to strength and +2 to charisma and luck, maybe -1 to agility. Satisfy 30% hunger and 60HP, maybe 10AP.  I figure it outta weigh a pound or so. What do you guys think?
---
It‚Äôs absurd that they have ignored their fan base once again.
---
for critters
---
If that's the thing they need to keep players, they're is a dire state. Could you imagine what kind of friend someone would be if you had to buy them dinner once a month to keep them as a friend?
---
Absolutely brilliant! It'd make Scorched Earth much more fun and easier
---
The events are dead now. I didn‚Äôt do meat week the second time once because it was A: either too burnt out or B: have all the event rewards so what do I achieve out of it. Same goes for Fascnatch, unless they release the last four masks that no one has
---
I have never seen this happen.  Not that I doubt you, I've just never observed this.
---
They are rushing it,  They just aren't prioritizing it.  It doesn't make them money.
---
That fallout 1st subscription was released just days after announcing the delay.  It took priority, because it makes them money.  The quality of that tells me it was rushed.  I don't foresee them caring too much about the quality of that update, as nothing released so far has had any quality control.  Also, they won't want to miss the cash opportunities of the thanksgiving and christmas holidays, they already know now that they aren't going to have time to mess with a silly free update.
---
Damn
---
I havent recieved anything as of yet. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
i hear the stand up bass play sounds when my notifications pop up, and you are saying you hear a guitar? strange glitch it must be!  i wonder if anyone hears any other instruments?
---
Ok, I see where I messed up: I was either wielding my instigating supersledge, or comparing my junkie grognak to my sledge (same base damage) and wielding a junkie weapon display the buff on all other weapons (so my supersledge and axe always had the same base damage displayed) :/
---
Thank you guys, it's reassuring knowing I don't have to addictol and start cheming up again \^\^
---
well I rent servers for sandbox games like Space Engineers - Wurm Unlimited - Ark (when they finally get me to admit it exsists....) 
---
and I'm paying 11$ for a 12 person server in Space Engineers right now so 13$ for 1st + all the atoms and such is pretty on the money 
---
also compare it to similar games which want me to buy 60$ worth of DLC twice a year and minimum bonuses its pretty low in price 
---
Specially when you look at your getting around 160$ish of atoms for 100$ Plus the ranger suit Plus apparently free variations of that suit its pretty solid deal and I'm 100% happy with that
---
BUT - still even with it I think the Scrap container and tent should be for all players I am plenty content with the tons of other features they have added
---
Yep, and I took the entire set.
---
I have singles of all the flavors, but only multiples of quantum, cherry, and plain.  Guess I'll be visiting the vendor in WS so I'll be able to experiment with effects.
---
I'm not going to subscribe because Bethesda still hasn't fixed many bugs and still hasn't implemented the quality-of-life changes people have been asking for (like text chat and perk card loadouts).
---
Just report.
---
Yeah, for npcs. VATS in NW doesn't target players
---
nah the game's economy is just inherently bad
---
Good point. A long time ago I suggested having a core recharging station, but was shot down pretty quickly.
---
I experienced a guy on my randomly generated team brag about the fact that he buys accounts online for under $10 and can cheat in hundreds of rounds of NW before they do anything. He said he has it down to a pretty specific time frame before they will punish you. He said 7-10 days. I watched this clown shoot directly through walls and mountains to kill people not even visible on his screen with a SHOTGUN. Bethesda appears to be doing almost nothing to combat this issue. 7-10 days is completely unacceptable.
---
It would be a completely new mechanic, since there wasn't anything like that in FO4.  That alone means it probably isn't going to make it.
---
But I'd be all for it, I haven't been fishing-famous since vanilla WoW, so I'm game to give it another shot here.
---
I haven't played in over a month and a half, also have not complained about the subscription services or dupers because I don't care. Cheaters are in almost every game, and this seems to be the only game where people whine about it on a daily/ hourly basis. If you don't like something, don't do it or be around it, it's that simple.
---
We totally need a fishing mini game
---
Yeah but if that was the case I would have to pay 12.99 a month for my friend to be a better friend and be more useful
---
I don't get how they would make it free to play.  I'm not saying it can't be done, but I don't understand how they would make it work considering your SPECIAL stats are derived from how you created your character in the regular game mode.  Would F2P players not be allowed to have SPECIAL stats higher than 1?
---
Any weapon type can have a good build, focus on what you enjoy and go for that. Gunslinging, sniping, melee, heavy weapons and explosives all have builds around them. Wouldn't worry bout it until level 50 though
---
What play style to you enjoy?  All builds are viable so long as you chose specials and perks to support your choice.  If you can't decide, I recommend a strengh build.  This will allow you to specialize in melee, shotguns, and heavy weapons without having to waste time moving special points.
---
This is the best reasoning I‚Äôve heard from people so far. I was unaware of the stash claims and it‚Äôs been very little of what people are screaming in protest of FO1st, so I didn‚Äôt know about it until I made this post. It outrage i can understand and get behind.
---
smart people have too much steel already
---
Just started my second playthrough as a melee/heavy weapon PA build.  Having so much fun finding things I overlooked and actually completing quests that were broken for my first character.  Do it!
---
I just have the suit but no hat. I missed it in the atom shop also.  What price would you like?
---
they do have the fish lamp :)
---
there was a thread a while back that brought up WV native critters missing from the local wildlife - IIRC, snakes, fish, and birds were on the list. (even though we hear owls at some points), Also IIRC, the topic branched to BGS doing a great job with ambient sounds, to include insects.
---
How so? Because the only fee I have to pay is my Xbox live subscription, I choose to pay for Fallout 1st.
---
I am sorry to hear that someone got to you like this.
---
By keeping this loser busy You saved someone else from his abuse (and that someone else could be more sensitive to such abuse).
---
So thank you on behalf of that ‚Äúmore-sensitive-someone‚Äù
---
I like my Instigating Gauss Rifle for ranged, and my Large Deathclaw Gauntlet for melee.
---
There is no such thing as enough steel.
---
If they want to retain players, they should stop treating us like shit.
---
Level 250 and I have have 100 perkscards to spend..
---
I'm sure they could figure out a bunch of ways to do. 
---
They can give free players a char with lv1 special stats like you said.
---
They can make the forest region free to play.
---
They can remove the link between NW character and Adventure mode characters. This would give NW characters their own unique SPECIAL levels.
---
Unpopular opinion trigger warning:
---
IDGAF about Fallout 1st.
---
I mean it's not for me, and I have no interest in it. But if you want to pay $13 a month for a bunch of atoms, exclusive access to a handful of outfits, your own personal world free from random fuckery, unlimited scrap and a T.E.N.T. ... fine, whatever, I do not care. They always said the private servers (even tho that's not really what these are) would cost $$ to run and they're throwing a bunch of crap to add value to that monthly fee.
---
Yeah, maybe there's a slippery slope to these things but I'm prepared to worry about that when we get there.
---
Also maybe it's a pilot program for shifting 76, probably around the time Wastelanders gets here, from a one-time-purchase to some sort of a freemium game that offers tiered free/by outright/monthly subscription options, and I'm sure that'll be controversial but ultimately fine too if and when it comes.

Bethesda got spoiled off having their community fix their games for them. They can't rely on that with Fallout 76 and it's showing in the worst way. Unless you refunded the game early like myself. Then it's just hilarious to watch.
---
Yes! And darts, pool billard, and whatever..
---
Or perhaps double, triple or quadruple dmg modifier of those unwanted prefixes (as in 50-100% extra dmg in Assassin, Mutant, Troubleshooters etc...) and put a bunch of lvl 100 enemies in game.
---
I thought this was funny ü§£
---
it would be nice if a fix was coming for the fixer.
---
That would be okay I think increasing the legendary spawns would be better
---
Fallout 1st was supposed to be released along side wastelanders but wastelanders was delayed but 1st was already done so they decided to just release it anyways. The extra money from 1st is also helping development with wastelanders to make sure it's the best it can be.
---
I also choose this guys dead grandpa

Wow. That is quite telling. Also the guy is a proper wankstain.

I think that would be even worse.

This is infuriating when it takes so long to connect, just to get the message your spot is taken.  There should be no problem computing an overlap of your camp area and any already there.  If the distance of the center of yours to any of the existing ones is &lt;= the diameter of a camp, abort and try another.  Simple!  At most you have (max # of players per server) - 1 comparisons, beyond trivial for a computer.
---
Plus, switching to another server because of the camps "fixes" the excavator PA carry bug for that session.
---
Uhhh, what now. Does this mean you can Spiderman around downtown Boston?
---
People keep forgetting that Bethesda is using the Creation Engine, their engine - which unlike modders, can easily modify. They‚Äôve already made drastic changes to the engine for instancing technology for Wastelanders (dialogue, NPCs, etc) and the Vault Raids. Also, we got the physical camera and now getting gold panning, so I don‚Äôt see why fishing can‚Äôt be added. Always a possibility!
---
Well said, my friend!
---
Don't you just love the broken promises Bethesda keeps throwing out at the community. 
---
First it was the legendary player bounus, after level 50!?
---
Then it was the wastelanders update, to be released this month!?
---
Not to mention after every patch, nothing is fixed. Just one line of shit after another?
---
Oh and let not forget about, Toddy boy Howard's promise, that there would be no additional cost to players after launch.  FALLOUT 1ST membership?
---
God, you got to love Bethesda magic carrot, that sucks people into this game. 
---
And this is comming from someone that has put in over 2000 hrs, in to this broken down golf cart. Lol. 
---
Not trying to be cynical, I love this game, but homme don't play like that. 
---
I just walked away a week ago. I may be back in the future. But after year 1 and the game is more broken now than it was at launch. 
---
It just makes you wonder, where Bethesdas prioritys are?
---
In my opinion, it not this community. 
---
Nonetheless, I wish you and everyone the best.

---
\*Nuka Wild is the name of the last one.... now i remember !
---
Actually, 50 cal is quite frugal with AP (30 per shot) and with -25% AP cost prefix you can have some VATS fun, if you're specced into that. Not on par with certain modded autorifles, but decent.
---
I think the best thing they could have done with 1st was give more camp budget with the private servers. It's been a very popular request for the last year and would have deflected some of the 'I'm paying for normal performance' criticisms, due to most people acknowledging that extra camp budget isn't something many games offer in significant amounts for free (due to the performance affect).
---
I know they mentioned it's on the way, but IMO they should have really given us at least a 30% increase with 1st's launch. 
---
That aside, I do agree that more skins would have also been good. Instead they basically flirted with P2W, gave the idea of charging for performance, and then threw in a reminder of New Vegas so that everyone could talk about how much better that game is. xD  
---
Truly a brainfart from whoever is making these decisions at Bethesda!
---
I know right?
---
I feel as though people are wanting a combination of red dead online and fallout 76.

---
I wasnt sure if you continued down into the debacle below. Last time i made an assumption, that happened. Lol. Im hesitant now.

Prolly Jet withdrawl.
---
Was thinking the same, why can't survival mode be pve survival? Buff up the enemies and make them a bullet sponge again.
---
Yeah, that could be it.  I only really know the PC economy.
---
Pumpkin suits was going for 15k but now the event has ended probably more. Go look on the trading sub and you‚Äôll see what you can get. Plans I would hold onto them for a bit as they‚Äôll be worth loads more.
---
If they increased the spawn of legendaries I would fully believe they would increase the chances of nocturnal, gun bashing, limb damage and water breathing effects to drop too
---
Were reskins of the armor advertised as a feature of buying a 1st subscription?  No.  Then why should you expect anything?
---
Bethesda was VERY specific about what came with your purchase of a 1st subscription with the only grey area being these forthcoming "exclusive discounts".  No one that bought into 1st should have expected ANYTHING additional coming with their initial purchase outside of these discounts unless otherwise announced.
---
Maybe I worded it wrong. I do care about the game, I DON'T care that someone sucks so bad they have to cheat the game UNLESS it will affect me in any way. Then fuck those guys
---
Is that good or bad? There is already a bunch of stuff to do and plenty of food sources. Just gives it a little more of a survival feel to me. Plus, they went and put fishing poles in the game for junk lol.
---
Don't count on gold panning - I don't recall seeing anything *in writing* about that, only a cinematic.  Until they actually talk about gold panning, using those words, you can't believe in it.
---
And I won't comment too directly on their expertise in the creation engine, but given the number of things that are blatantly wrong with 76's implementation of it, you can probably guess how I'd lean on hat subject.
---
I guess the truth hurts.
---
This needs fixing. I'm playing NW, a fucking game mode I don't want to play, to earn the stupid fucking outfits that will take days to get. Now I go to earn my daily atoms and the whole fucking thing is ticked off. Ffs.

---
Honestly, I think the infinite Scrapbox just shouldn't be a thing in the first place. I think its a huge premium band-aid that is used to mask the unbalanced scrap system. Like instead of balancing a system of give/take, we suffered a year of  ^(give)/TAKETAKETAKE, and now have a paid option to say fuck it.   
---
I think a real problem is its not worth the actual price. It makes Bethesda look like they value 76 way more than, well any other paid service for games. Even ESO is a better deal in every direction. I think a better direction for 76 to go is a division of subscriptions that still equal the current price of 1st if you bought into all of them but also make the ranger armor and emotes a reward for subscribing at all. Like private servers and the tent for $7 and the Scrap Box for $4 or something, first time buying either gets ranger armor and the emotes to show you support the games future endeavors. I think a division like this would see a lot more subscribers for multiple months instead of a huge drop after a month or two that Bethesda is going to see.
---
Plotting how they can monetize patch 15 for maximum appeasing factor to the overlords in management.
---
That wasn‚Äôt a cinematic, it was real-time footage haha. Guess they‚Äôre doubling down on resource collection. And yes, a lot of issues with this version of the engine needs to be ironed out.
---
We do have frogs for all the irradiated bass lol.
---
IN GAME!
---
I don't think you'll meet too many people who would argue against Berserker being buffed to be comparable to Bloodied.  Likewise, the suggestion that Nocturnal should never cause below-normal stats during the daytime (instead, just return to normal) is a popular one.
---
It'd be a great combination but Rockstars game engine for red dead is so much better than what the creation engine can do. If obsidian had the rights to fallout and Rockstar let them use their engine to make a fallout game, it'd be a contender for goty.
---
I read it all man, I‚Äôm on your side üòÇ but I‚Äôll definitely be selling 5.56 for 2 caps now that I know there are buyers! Just kidding ü§£üòù

Fallout 1st comes with free Customer Support Kits.  
---
They'll be coming to the Atoms shop soon for 500 atoms each!
---
Since nobody gave you the right answer. Legendary players were envisiooned as giving you the ability to make one of your special stats \*legendary\* every 50 levels or so, which would provide "better" perks for it.
---
Edit: I would have provided a source, however searching for a dev interview on youtube gave me a cancer.  
---
And I wouldn't one to regurgitate any youtuber's words, so ... I'll go schedule my chemo.
---
All I'm saying is it should get ejected to the outside of someones camp radius or something. I'm well aware of how you benefit from an instant stash anywhere on the map and that has nothing to do with the problem.
---
If they allowed me to rent persistent 24 people servers, I'd pay for more than one.
---
I'm a first subscriber, but I think I'll cancel. If they make Scrapbox free for everybody, I will not cancel/will renew the sub.
---
This should be a feature for all of us.
---
When I was that level, I was lucky enough to find a player vendor with a shit ton of black Ti scrap so I didn't have to spend forever hunting it.
---
The real record will be when we can go five minutes without someone still whining about almost two week old "outrage".
---
Shhh shhh in-fact you‚Äôve just gave me an idea. I‚Äôm going to do sell people 5.56 for a premium subscription each month. Yowie Wowie!
---
I minored in Programming, I am guessing most people don't understand how it can be a pain in the ass to track down why a particular bug is occurring.
---
Not sure if you play ESO but something like that would suffice. It wouldn't have to be anything to extreme. I do see what you're saying though, makes sense.
---
I have a 3\* bloodied handmade and it drops back to base damage with every reload.
---
I play in NZ and I seem to get a lot of Pacific Rim nations going by user names (JP/HK/KO/Aus) so I guess so.
---
Oh I've no doubt there's reps of some sort on Twitter, Reddit and other sites but these people think you're a shill if you aren't dribbling bile out a foaming mouth while gripping a picture of Todd so tightly your fingernails are bleeding. Commenting 'it just works' any time a person posts about a bug or even vague issue and thinking it's the most original clever shit ever.
---
I like the game. I play it most days. I don't have Fallout 1st. Fuck y'all if any of that is a problem to any of you.
---
Agreed, 300-400 of newly found stash space changes the survival aspect of the game.
---
That would be nice.  I'm prepping 2 alts right now that could benefit from the XP boost to ease the painful process getting to lvl 50.
---
the SBQ bugs out and zaps back and forth when someone stands on an elevated surface where her hitbox cant fit in. This usually happens if someone is on the fence/white roof of dropsite v9.
---
To make her land quicker when she gets stuck in the air, make sure everyone is standing on the grass, she lands pretty much instantly when the person with agro stands on a surface where her AI lets her land.
---
Of course, this doesnt work if she gets stuck in the air with a cryolator!
---
Hope it helps out.
---
There should be a better game that has a better story, oh wait thank you outer worlds...
---
That is exactly the implication - though I initially worked with a different franchise in mind.
---
To be honest, I don‚Äôt think a double xp event each month will make a big difference. If it corresponds with new content then I would say Yes but there‚Äôs nothing really exciting right now about 76 sadly.
---
They are listed as "Post" Content and with the "ATX\_" header, meaning "Atomic Shop"  
---
It's why everyone lost their minds when we could finally open the game files.
---
Xbox for me as well. Also interested. Lemme know if you get something like this together
---
I didn‚Äôt expect the skin to be free especially with what you get for subbing the first time the entitlement is funny within some people (incoming downvotes) from anti 1st ü§§
---
Attempted to add you, but it says that it's an incorrect username.
---
These are really the two schools of thought on pricing.  Are you pricing things to get rich yourself, or are you pricing them in the interest of making sure anyone who wants one can afford to get one?
---
Unfortunately, you can't tell the difference when it comes to the customer.  So, you should ultimately think about it from the standpoint of "If someone were to buy this and resell it, at what cost would I not feel ripped off?"
---
That would be an awesome idea but I agree with some of the comments about adding a new mechanic etc
---
1 - I don't think that was 'in game footage' the way you mean it to be.  It's hard to tell for certain, but that could absolutely be mocked up or (less likely) CGI.  Not hard to do either way.
---
2 - Either way, a scene in a trailer isn't a promise of a feature.  Hell, if they came out and said 'we're adding gold panning!', there's no guarantee that it will ever happen, but that's not the point.  Too many people have been fooled by reading into what's been shown/written, and then disappointed.  Don't fall into that trap.
---
Are you Texas Red? There‚Äôs no way I can match you with this Big Iron on my hip
---
Yeah, it makes sense for sure.
---
Go commando, you can have w or 3 good guns and have a scope on one for long range if you want, for pve commando sneak build is amazing and efficient
---
Damn you have more patience than me. I basically soloed about 90 hours and I was able to obtain most of the stuff I wanted. I got my $60 worth from the game.
---
Ewe! If everybody gets scrap boxes I better get my l Benjamin Franklin back!
---
I still haven't looked at the results. It doesn't matter. I'd like to see the results from the first poll. 
---
Also I don't know what I said that was hypocrisy. I gave my opinion that when I travel to camps probably 6 of 10 have a stash box. My point is that this particular community makes up maybe, generously, 25% of the player base.
---
Also, instead of getting so fucking outraged over a $13 subscription. Perhaps some of that passion should be pointed at things that make sense to be outraged over.
---
Yess
---
Bloodied is super strong too and you won't have to be super low health you can be like half health and still kill stuff quickly if you have sneak, escape artist and covert operative, action boy is great, vats is also good in pve but kinda boring way to play imo
---
Isn't there signs for Nuka Cola Cranberry in the Cranberry Bog? They could totally add it in as a very lore friendly thing.
---
Nah didnt raise any hope. We are all in a perpetual state of disappointment lol. You would have been a Wasteland Hero if you would have be able to. Infact, I would have edited Foreigners song "jukebox hero" to "Wasteland hero" and followed you around while you built them
---
Hit high density enemy areas and kill them all server hop then repeat
---
I really hope not. People keep asking for this like it naturally should be in a fallout game. Next will be pets (not the Dogmeat kind), mounts, professions, classes...
---
That'd be cool if we could craft nuka colas quantums for days
---
Hey look, I dont want to set the world on fire. I just wanna start a great big (business) flame in your heart.
---
Get with a high rank. Go to west tek. Shoot everything at least once and let the high rank finish depleting the health bars of all the scary around you.
---
Best way (that is still a grind) is to follow high level players around (or ask them outright if they don‚Äôt mind so you can join their team) and get a shot or two on the enemy they are about to kill.
---
As long as you do &gt;1% damage you will get credit for the kill.
---
What I do is go with those legendary farming dudes and offer them the legendaries in return for letting me tag along.
---
Good trade if you ask me.
---
Its pathetic people are downvoting you for saying you dont disconnect much. I rarely disconnect too and I don't care if people don't like that fact.
---
demanding an apology because you disagree with someones reddit comment is some real boomer shit
---
Like a $13 subscription for a game that we paid full AAA price for and it has less quality than an early access indie game?
---
Time to go to private server, own all worshops, then worskshop hop around until you have 5k in everything. Take a break, then get another 25k of each scrap. Then you are set for a couple days.
---
At this point if they had a beta for wastelanders or something I ‚Äúmight‚Äù consider a month subscription if they had early access or a play test but they don‚Äôt listen to feedback lol
---
Are you charging me for each reply? I‚Äôm not sure what subscription plan I‚Äôm on anymore
---
Now its my turn "shhhh shhhhh"
---
I fear that people are already letting BGS go. Two weeks ago this sub and most gaming subs were on fire roasting 76, but looking at even here today the fire is waning. At the time of writing this comment, only 2 of the top 50 posts on this sub mention the 1st and Patch 14 issues one of them being your post. Maybe everyone that got upset moved on to other games, but still shows there's a ton of people that are just dealing with it. [We can't let this keep happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reAcdKO7kMg), but the past year shows they kinda ignore drama till it dies down enough to fan the flames.
---
I stopped playing after the XP per kill was useless... let alone the amount of ammo wasted on the kills.
---
I have been wanting to try this for a few days now and will on the weekend when I have more time.
---
Any tips to this? Should I build defences or just the extractors?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reAcdKO7kMg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reAcdKO7kMg)
---
Do I need to file a ticket Bethesda? Please respond...
---
You make me want to grind out the events just to get it now lol. Well done fine sir. Let them eat cake!
---
I paid out the ass for the power armor addition, in the beginning, pre launch.  Not to mention the 50 dollars in atoms credits I paid for. 
---
I was off work for a few months because of a surgery. 
---
I became addicted to this game. I have mixed feelings about getting my moneys worth out this game though. 
---
I kind of feel like I did Bethesda a favor by playing as much as I did. Lol. 
---
I am glad you feel that you got your money's worth out of it, that is all that counts in the end. 
---
Once again, I wish you the best.
---
‚ÄúTHE ANSWER IS CLEAAAAR‚Äù
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ perfection!
---
I actually enjoyed the one I did a couple weeks ago but the rewards didn't really justify the effort. I'll do it again soon though. Really lame it timed out on you.
---
&gt;i should say i was soloing
---
unless your a mega-super-pro, don't solo. it is not made or designed to be solo content. this is the only part i see as user error beside the 1 death
---
- attempt 1: dying, no idea why this is a complaint, its made to be a tough team challenge. but im assuming part2 is where the frustration really is
---
- attempt 2: blocked means you did not do the task the robot needs you to do for it to progress, there is a bar in the top right corner that has what you need to do (normally cores/interlock/valve/card swipe)  always check the corner because it does not always give you on screen prompts/markers
---
- as far as falling through the floor and getting kicked out goes, it is a bug that happens when your system did not load the vault in properly.  it was not a time out.  the game did not register where you went so you "respawned."  that "respawn" counted as a death and is what made the vault boot you.  (ive had this one happen to my team before)
---
- all this said i am sorry that you had a bad experience.  hopefully it does not sour the taste for you when the next set of vaults launch
---
News flash (and get your tissues ready) Bethesda doesn't care what you think.
---
Let it sink in.
---
Additionally, they're making money on it so they're going to focus on "true fans" (/s) that bought the subscription and not the people complaining/boycotting/raging and are trying to force Bethesda to be ethical in their business practices as well as skilled in the product they put out.
---
That's a tough combination of weapons to optimize simultaneously.  If you pick up skeet shooter (Perception) and Enforcer (Agility) your shotgun will be effective at close to medium range.  If you prefer rifles, you can go the commando route because handmades are great at near, medium, and far range.  If you don't specialize, you are likely to have a rough time with bosses at higher levels.
---
I have to believe at some point they're going to give us more ability to have actual pets and if they never do that is a colossal missed opportunity. But yeah, chicken coup would be amazing.
---
I do extractors really. I get all the factories too for fusion cores, ammo workshop for ammo plus all the materials over there. I hit them all up as I am able. Don't even need to lock any of them so you save a lot of materials. If you don't save it in time so what lol. Just go repair what is needed and reap scrap and kill whatever is still there.
---
Thanks for that. Also, forgive my ignorance, what trading sub?
---
This is an auto reply from a developer. 
---
Please insert $3.99 USD to file your request for a support ticket. Mastercard not accepted.
---
Do you power the factories as well? I think you have to to get the cores correct?
---
And thanks, I cant wait to try it out
---
It really depends on the mood of the rng gods.  One time I was doing it solo the game spawned around 90 mole miners - 15 per wave with two waves per supervisor...  I barely made it and wouldn't have if I had to put more than 1 bullet in each one.
---
You can‚Äôt say it as it gets deleted. But it‚Äôs market and 76 as one word.
---
It's very much a cap sink issue. If there were more capsinks where sitting at the cap limit would be hard, there wouldn't be the need for trade only. You'd actually want the caps to further sink whatever you were sinking.
---
I would go with the Horizon Zero Dawn way. Its a lot easier to make and understand.
---
Do you accept 5.56 as an alternative payment method? I could sell you some and then you could sell it for double the price üòâüòâüòâüòâüòâ
---
I'm sorry to hear that, but also congrats!
---
This is peak milennial/zoomer narcissism. I sympathize, but this is 100% grief talking. 
---
Take some time, process, recover. Move on. You'll always remember her, you don't need a in-reference in a video game to remember her by.
---
only on the Fo76 subreddit do you get down voted for being nice lol.    meanwhile in game it's  "Greatest Community ever!" people.      goddamn subreddit needs to take it's bipolar meds.
---
I use them to keep my Adrenaline combo going. Nothing like that +60% damage for five minutes.
---
There are, but I think it also says "Coming Soon!"
---
If you have access to a private server, repeatedly clear Whitesprings, West Tek and Grafton Steel.
---
PC or platform? Specific pumpkin plans you notice going faster than others? Is there a rareity to them or pretty even ?
---
You can also get the food factory and load up on everything in the map. Then sell it all to the krill while you enjoy that whale life.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Do you take *every* workshop or are some not worth the time? Like not enough resource nodes or whatever
---
Oh, it's not stopping me! I belt it out! I just think it's a public service to the players of Appalachia not to hear me. 
---
Me-"WELL, BONGO, BONGO, BONO, I DON'T WANNA LEAVE THE CONGO... "
---
Unknown Player to his team-"WTF, is that!! Weapon up, Boys and Girls, I think we're about to be attacked by a horde of Glowing Wendigo." Lol.
---
I bought a serum recipe for 7500.  Within 3 days across 3 characters selling the serums i got my caps back and now just profit
---
Inside the vault tomorrow.
---
I was listing all the plans for 1k. The full, half full, half empty racks sold slower than the pumpkins, but they all sold. I'm sure sometimes they were being bought to be resold, as multiples were bought by same person.
---
Edit: xbox
---
I get all with acid lead steel junk and copper primarily but I do try getting them all. If you dedicate a few hours to it you will have more than you ever had probably total your whole time playing lol
---
Play The Outer Worlds.
---
But I can see you in the forums. Say what you will guys, I just can‚Äôt take how Bethesda is treating us. I‚Äôve bought every fallout game in the franchise. I‚Äôve been here since the beginning.. I could take the bugs and I could take the broken events. But the paywall killed me guys.. I wouldn‚Äôt even mind paying it but it all just seems so wrong and underhanded. Good luck fellas.
---
Wastelanders is released as a "game enchancer" and not called DLC and they charge 100 dollars for it.... /s
---
Go back to your troll hole.
---
This is an auto reply from a developer
---
We have looked into your profile and have seen you no longer posess enough 5.56 rounds to use as credit. Because you did not follow the exact 30 page guidline to storing your extra ammunition, it has since required your currency to be deleted. 
---
We are truely sorry as there is currently no way to grant you previously lost items due to user error. Please enjoy your day.
---
Sweet!
---
I got the month for 1st for the specific reason of filling up the scrap bin so I can un-subscribe.
---
It seems the only stuff i‚Äôll be missing is asbestos and ballistic fibre now!
---
More qol features in the shop such as pip boy colors
---
√ó2 XP weekends
---
What would the given effect be? Xp boost? Damage boost? How will it work with nuka nut?
---
idk how that would possibly be easier for bethesda to implement tho.
---
the player would have to actually create 2 different camps?
---
or bethesda just arbitrarily pulls 75% of the camp into the public world?
---
the members are going to be able to go back and forth between private worlds (presumably still a *new* private world every time, atleast until they become dedicated (but i doubt that will happen at all, they will just load old data for workshops).  
---
I feel like the easiest possible thing for bethesda to do, would just be to have the maximum camp budget be higher on a private world server, then just let the camp be at 150% budget on public (or what ever amount).
---
They may even just give members special permissions so that they just always have increased budgets over regular players.
---
moral of the story here is that there absolutely wont be a limiting factor *forcing* subscribers to *stay* in private worlds.
---
New method of travel, fly across the map tethered to a scotch beast. I like it.
---
Make sure you fast travel before leaving server. It saves your progress even if you fast travel to the location are are like for example your camp while so you aren't really leaving your camp but still saving.
---
There is plenty asbestos and ballistic fibers to be found around areas and from enemies while doing the workshops.
---
Hey dude. Don't be a dick. Hard enough for the Community Managers to do their jobs and manage the community given that they pretty much ghost us if there is a hint of backlash.
---
Yeah, they should just do their jobs irrespective of the harshness of the community but these aren't the community managers we have unfortunately.
---
Free to play implies it costs nothing to play the game, this was a full price game from a AAA studio, it can't be played for free
---
Damn man I sell them for 125 each and they go super fast
---
Some badass weapons such as the tommy gun can use a healthy buff. MG42 can certainly use some better ammo yield and more mods.
---
I can‚Äôt wait until they have the continued server so your workshops will stay up.
---
You won‚Äôt ever need to rebuild anything at all!
---
That would be one way to ensure people login on a regularly scheduled cycle. Of course it would also mean additional, concentrated server load and fuller maps. Double edged sword actually.
---
And boot people from your server too. If you appear offline it still shows you online in fallout's game menu.
---
Just do your dailies before you log in a NW match.  I had never had that problem and the first time I tried NW they got auto completed.  Now I just do my dailies and then go do NW and have never had that problem again.
---
Totally putting this as a craftable in my FO4 mod for my holiday update.
---
 It is a bug that happens when you go from NW to Adventure mode.
---
Throw a grenade and blow them up
---
It wasn't scrap.  If it was scrap, it wouldn't bother me at all.
---
I have been buying armor from traders on the market, as well as vending machines for as long as they've been around.  There were a lot of rare and A-roll pieces in there - as well as a number of great low level pieces that I save to give out to new players.
---
Can confirm as a person who started over recently from a level 90 something (casually playing since launch), character. 
---
Levels 20-45 took ages to get through.
---
Probably taking any suggestions from salty krill.
---
I‚Äôve had ghouls respawn where ash piles were and be invincible and not hostile. Are you farming on a private server?
---
Not sure about Bethesda but your one is having this post removed by mods.
---
Oh damn. That sucks. Try another ticket and hound them.
---
What plans for handmade would work best for commando? My main issue is scrounging up ammo
---
Berserker should be even higher damage buff than bloodied. People running bloodied get themselves well covered in good armors, but berserker basically requires you to run around naked to get some mediocre buff.
---
Better gameplay + NPC will bring more players back
---
Nuclear Winter should be Double XP every damn day....it is so stingy and this Halloween grind is such a chore =\_=
---
&gt;I submitted a ticket requesting that a character be restored from backup
---
OK...but why? 
---
Because it went missing, or it got corrupted and you can't log it in, or because you lost an item you don't want to have lost?
---
Their response will very much depend on why you're asking.
---
If they want to retain players, they need to stop treating them like garbage.
---
I‚Äôm not paying Bethesda to play it, I‚Äôm paying Microsoft. It‚Äôs no different for PS4 players paying Sony. You can‚Äôt bitch about Bethesda making you Pat to play it when it‚Äôs not them. If you were actually being charged a subscription fee by Bethesda, then I would also be outraged, but that‚Äôs not the case.
---
xbox hmm. I wonder how much difference it is between the two. I've been practically giving my extra plans away but that was during the event. Will try out the 1k for a bit. Thanks.
---
They care about what people think... but they care about the people that actually play the game.  When this sub gets brigaded by people from r/gaming or the fans of some desperate youtubers Bethesda doesn't have to use that as a metric for how successful their decision was... they can look at their data and whether or not the people that actually play the game are speaking with their wallets.
---
Reddit outrage isn't worth much.
---
I mean for fuck sake Blizzard had an honest to god human rights protest on their hands that if you believed Reddit was going to turn Blizzcon into a massive shitshow and bring the company to it's knees... and now Blizz is just worried about where they'll put all that Overwatch 2 money.
---
there's this new thing, it's called google.
---
There's literally 20 guides on where to find lead
---
why do people insist on spamming forums with the same posts ooover and over with easy accessible info
---
This would be a great mechanic but considering the bugs already in game I imagine it'll be far FAR off into the future before they can even think of implementing it properly.
---
All you need is a good game, with minimal micro transactions. That alone will retain players.
---
Sneaky shotgunner here. Have an instigating one for alone and a furious one for boss fights. Use vanguard armour with harder to detect while sneaking on all pieces. Shadowed if possible. (Really wish cannibal wouldn‚Äôt unsneak you..)
---
Yes because there is still the pay2win tent behind the paywall.
---
If Fallout 1st was just the private worlds + atoms, maybe even the armour too, people wouldn't be anywhere near as pissed. Maybe pissed off that it's YET ANOTHER monetisation scheme for the game but not the level of outrage that it currently has.
---
The pay2win items behind the Fallout 1st paywall is the main issue, not so much that there is a subscription service.
---
Coming soon the the Atom store!...
---
How about they dont cherry pick posts because of negative feedback. They have yet to comment on anything and that whole week they only responded to 1st questions and problems. Only. So fuck them
---
-5 Agility, +3 Strength, +1 Perception, +7 Charisma, -2 Luck, *Warning, you get drunk and start fighting everyone, for 5 minutes people can kill you for caps without suffering from consequences*
---
Fallout First was already so off putting for me that a double XP weekend wouldn‚Äôt bring me back, unfortunately.
---
I agree, usually Anti-Armor and Two Shot usually means 20-30% damage but stuff like Troubleshooters and Mutants are restricted to certain conditions. Hunter's and Exterminator's are usually bad since very few worthy locations that benefit from those modifiers are almost nonexistent.
---
That too. Like I said, we have the CMs that we have, sad but true. However, your attitude doesn't help in any regard.
---
At random, you'll end up nekked with only a Santa hat
---
There are no BR servers, so the game connects to North American servers by default anyway.
---
I just left last week too. You‚Äôre right, after that many hours it hurts to close the door.
---
I‚Äôve ground out 12 and 13 badges between the challenges, events and dailies on two characters... when I hit 16 on both I‚Äôm hosting a bidding war for them!
---
Nope. Not until they deal with NW cheaters first
---
In my experience, they seem largely random. They do seem to appear at night, sometimes remain open in the morning, but they‚Äôre not open consistently.
---
I plopped my little tent down near Dyer and return to it periodically.  Blooms definitely still appear, but they‚Äôre certainly on a loot timer like other plants.
---
If you use green thumb, chemist and super duper, one harvest can net around 40-50 radshield. That will last me quite a while.

We‚Äôve been hard at work on Fallout 76 this year, including our biggest free update yet, Wastelanders
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more
---
Just find a bunch of posts from here and official forums and show them all the times they could do it and point out that they're lying to you.
---
In as nice of a way as possible of course. You want their help afterall.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had weeklies auto complete... the daily thing is annoying though. It seems f you log into adventure before NE after dailies resets they should not auto complete.
---
Had to look that up; yes, that would be simpler.
---
What I've gathered about Berserker is that you can wear stuff but you'll need to have the refrigerated backpack to deny the underarmor DR and:
---
A) Break your gear to keep the legendary modifiers  but deny the resistance or
---
B) Wear low level / light leather armor.
---
1st subscribers don't need couriers anymore! Just drop your stuff in a mailbox, log out, log in with the other character, pick it up. It's awesome! I totally managed my alts today with no stress!
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right to do this. I agree with this action because it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted.
---
My cheque is in the post. Thank you again for this excellent customer service.
---
Ammo to damage value is weird on this game, from Hunting to Gatling to Minigun; so does the MG42 to the Hunting and Pipes. 5mm however is lighter, cheaper compared to .308.
---
No avoiding the ammo issue, the best solution is to make your own.  If you're a VATS player, then my preference is Tweaked Receiver, Stabilized Long Barrel, Reflex Sight, the magazine that gives you ammo capacity +armor penetration (stinging?), and the percise stock.
---
seen as i play solo and it is my understanding that novice mode is the solo play option as well. 
---
Attempt 1- i was trying to find key cards which are small in unfamiliar area while enemies just kept re-spawning, it is bad design it doesn`t make it better/harder it just make it a nuisance and frustrating that you have to kill the same enemies over and over again with no real progress
---
2. I absolutely did it was at the position it needed to be and noting was said on why it was blocked as it should have been progressing 
---
3. if memory servers it was a side step and i begun to fall. I was relatively close by and i was still in the vault and some time passed before i was booted, enough time to get mostly there so if the system read me as "respawned" how come it didnt boot me instantly?
---
There should be a double XP weekend every weekend becuase Bethesda are money grabbing twats.
---
Just because i hate people like you i will post one of these every week for the next 2 years. Hooe your account gets deleted in a glitch
---
I had way too much fun with this conversation. A thousand upvotes friend. Alas, my little raiders want dinner.
---
I don't think that the person who responded to my ticket was lying - they were just incredibly lazy and likely didn't even read it completely.  As a result, I got the generic "So you lost items?  Sorry, dude - can't help." response.
---
So if my simple ass Is following proper...
---
Then essentially,‚ÄùFurious‚Äù would be an option as well?
---
Like,Furious,AA,etc the first,FFR etc the second,&amp; then whatever I can get for the 3rd &amp; so on a so forth?
---
Cause If so,I‚Äôm thinkin rifle wise,it‚Äôll be a Furious ‚Äú1st‚Äù prefix,&amp; for my Melee I‚Äôd probably go Vampire,avoiding bloodied &amp; junkies...
---
If I ain‚Äôt right,it‚Äôs aight,I never claimed too be the sharpest tool in the shed,Lol

I‚Äôm kinda just happy my post got any attention,cause all these knowledge bombs are b-e-a,utiful.
---
Not just for me,but for the greater populace.
---
Thanks again ya‚Äôll
---
Love it when we‚Äôre all gettin together.
---
‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it so groovy now,that people are finally gettin together,think it‚Äôs wonderful &amp; how,
---
That people are finally gettin together‚Äù!!
---
Sorry bout that,just happy In general,
---
Just got outta work &amp; such,Lol
---
You mean pirate costume build? Rifle, pistol, and meat hook.
---
It just works
---
We also dont care what they think. At this point anything we can do to hurt the game and community is a good thing.
---
I sold two firemen outfits for 8k each and they both went in two days. Pirate outfit I priced and sold for 7.5k in a day. Had someone offer 1300 per plan on the marketplace, but it didn't happen. I have the plans listed at 1500 each in my vendor. Sold one of them. Whitesprings suit is listed at 9k but has been sitting a couple days now. Short pumpkin suit I'll probably list at 10k, see how it does, and discount accordingly.
---
Peace and love brother!
---
You get to keep your outfit
---
The CMs aren't allowed to comment about 1st.
---
They did mention companions from the factions who would join us on Instance/Interior based missions and would be able to be found at the camps. But those are likely "Unique" companions. I could see generic ones make their way to the shop. Would honestly just use the in game challenges to finance them. Would at least care to see a Duraframe Eyebot who could use its laser and play staticky versions of songs from the Capital Wasteland and New Vegas.
---
As a father, this breaks me up and I feel for him and his family. As a gamer, I feel for any grief a company gets for not responding to these requests, or any moral conflict they'd feel to respond, but not responding is the only option given the amount of grief/loss in the world and the precedent this would cause (flood gates open to all others suffering loss). 
---
I feel it would be awesome if he came back to the game, with his daughter's name remaining and playing it through. There are enough CAMP items, junk display options and letter sets out there I feel he could really make a memorial to his daughter for himself to enjoy and for other gamers to recognize and respect. I am sure there are some in the community who would lend their creativity as well as their extra plans to assist in a CAMP build. I am truly sorry for his loss and hope they find (some) peace and easing of pain through it all.
---
What weapon...?
---
I'd probably toss it in as a quest reward for some farm with a small quest on the basics of raising animals.
---
Much better idea than mine.
---
I think it counts as feedback. If your consumer doesn't like something, it must be the consumer's fault I guess.
---
Meanwhile teams have been completing on expert with plenty of time left over for months.
---
I have 2 full sets of strangler PA and have completed each mission a ton of times.  You failed 2 whole times, so sorry about that... We failed dozens of attempts on each mission, learning each time, until we figured them out.
---
You want this game handed to you on a platter but acquiescing to your demands to make it trivially easy to the point of being boring as fuck would ruin it.
---
In other words, git gud.
---
I'd say BGS are better at crafting interesting worlds than stories tbh.
---
Handmade or Combat
---
It's 100% a lie. They may be very misinformed or new but it doesn't make it any less of a lie.
---
The idea that an item can't be restored from a save/backup is ridiculous in our day and age. Not just that, there are countless examples where they did.
---
Whatever the intent, it's a lie and they should have it pointed out to them that it is. I mean you shouldn't have to but that's not the kind of company we're working with here sadly.
---
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uXj4ULnrtJJqyIPW7VGPWGQ7966QiaLUi9GXD8Q7FE0/edit?usp=drivesdk) you go.
---
Also,&amp; I mean...it ain‚Äôt the best,but it worked fer me...
---
Is make sure ya jam an instrument,take a good nap...&amp; farm you some cranberries from that farm over by The West Virginian Lumber Mill &amp; make you some pies...
---
It ain‚Äôt much,but It helped it go quicker fer me.
---
It wasn‚Äôt until my second playthrough/character that I realized there where cranberries available outside the bog...
---
Think there‚Äôs 9 In total by that farm.
---
One would think a billionaire company would have figured it out by now. Modders used to roll out fixes that Bethesda said were "very hard" all the time.
---
It's lack of interest, nothing else.
---
Double xp would be great right now, I can get my build done
---
Guessing the recipe was a camp buy.
---
Very professional of them
---
I‚Äôm level 200, I don‚Äôt need any more XP. I want bug fixes and DLC to retain players.
---
I really do think the camp system needs reworks to make it snappy and fun to use more often. Certain objects are bugged and have a larger collision box than they should. Like the Campfire Tales tent. Try placing a bed against the tent walls and you're buildable space is much smaller than a regular tent you can place. It's these little things that make building a tiring experience.
---
And Molerats can create ground anywhere they go. Why can't we level the ground a bit to prevent floating foundations.
---
I wasn't demanding anything,  I was asking you to man up and admit that you were mistaken. I see that is not going to happen, even after I reposted your entire comment to show you exactly what you posted and what I replied to which had nothing to do with my opinion at all, it had to do with your comments that were shown to be false.
---
You know it's Bethesda preventing them from doing that, right?
---
Like getting mad a cashier over company policy
---
I don't think another one has been given a date.  I just keep myself within a few hundred of Max at all times until a sale hits.  Lets me try a few hops to see if RNG is in my favor and if it is spend a few hundred more.
---
I‚Äôd love double xp, I always sleep till well rested and eat canned meat to get that 10% extra experience, sometimes I have the cranberry thing too to get it up to 15%!
---
I've played this game since the Betas. I bought the Tricentennial Edition. They sure as fuck don't give a damn about what I think, or what you think, or what anyone thinks except their investors.
---
All our suggestions for new features have been added as Atomic Shop or Fallout 1st paid items. Open your eyes.
---
Price that stuff way higher if you have it, sold two firemen outfits for 8k each and pirate outfit for 7.5k all in two days. Details posted in the below thread.
---
Nuh uh, I grabbed his junk! You're just jealous!
---
Omg that is awesome. And make the hat a sort of reward.
---
Ah but that requires access to a private server
---
Oh it doesn‚Äôt change the server? I was always under the impression that when you logged in and out of your private world you end up in a different world than before.
---
what is the max amount of scrip you can have?
---
You shouldn't have to pay just so it can run. Think about that for a second.
---
What weapons do you use?  You're halfway between a food build and bloodied.  I would drop some if the qol perks for more offense/defense.
---
I carry 30 each diluted radaway and stims.
---
This, big time. I seriously questioned starting a new character at 50 or so because I wanted to make some changes to my build that I would have to have about 15 level-ups to fix. Here I am, at 95, build is even better than I set out to achieve and I still have like 20 in the bank.
---
I've seen between 10 and 15k lately
---
Yeah, I know I could get a lot more but doing the math at 50 ea that's 22500 caps for the whole suit and I know no one will pay for the whole thing from vendors etc etc etc I'm offering a service of speeding up their achievements etc etc etc dont need it to play etc etc etc but charging more than 50 just feels, I dunno, bad?
---
That's just me though bro.  You went down there and did the quest to get those tokens so only you get to decide what that time was worth.
---
Re downloaded it ... nope can‚Äôt turn bloom off still, cye
---
Don‚Äôt even get as far as considering xp
---
I'd make another character only for Wastelanders. If you know the story already, I don't think you can enjoy a new build that much. Just a personal opinion.
---
It's definitely an improvement.
---
I do think the events it chooses could stand to be balanced out though.  I feel like I see Tea Time an inordinate amount.
---
You paid for it a year ago and there's nothing in the subscription spectacular enough to warrant all the outrage. I have my $60 out of 76. If you don't feel the same I wonder why you're even bothering. There's plenty of amazing games to play.
---
And no, I mean actual problems that really affect people.
---
Mothman is wise.  L√§mp.
---
Its more like getting mad at a manager over a company policy. Its the highest authority we have access too so if we hate their policy that is who you take it out on. They dont want to hear it, find a better company
---
I agree I dropped everything and ran to these events! They were a ton of fun and the rewards were actually decent for a change!
---
So was I. I had heard that there was a five minute failsafe so if you get knocked from a server you can get back in. I didn't think it was the case if you changed characters, but then I noticed all my workshops were still built, just not owned. So Ibtried it with a couple of plans and it worked. Give it a try. Just use something cheap in case it was a fluke!
---
True. If they tried to implement this today, the gun would probably end up flinging the user halfway across the entire map, fully restricting the player's movement indefinitely, rendering the intended target immune until the server resets or crashes, and deleting some random player's inventory for good measure.
---
Yeah thats the only one really annoying me. Shouldnt be public at all.
---
Lmao with my anti armor explosive black powder I might have to do that. I need a meat hook worth a shit.
---
I play a sniper but since rifleman and commando are both in perception you can easily switch them out when you want to do events like scorched earth
---
Todd only knows.
---
1000
---
Community managers aren't literal managers. It's literally their job just to pass information one way or the other. Maybe direct your anger somewhere else, this is quite sad
---
Which events are you talking about? Because stealth got me through mischief night, and gets me through most queen fights, as well as the other events I usually run like uranium fever, one violent night, etc.
---
Escape artist is a key perk, you just run out of direct view of your enemy, crouch and they lose you.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Literally just changed all my perks and weapons from a Power Armored Heavy Gunner to a Stealth Melee build. It's actually pretty good and fun but in public events I feel largely ineffective to an extent. I can solo the ISS just because my healing factor takes up all my damage there. But so long as you can stay hidden, you keep regaining health and at the most, doing x3 damage with whatever weapon you're doing. Its viable in PVP as well
---
Yes and no.  You *can* wear armor and benefit from its Legendary perks *as long as it's broken*.
---
It is still more dangerous than Bloodied, yes.
---
Listen man, hop into your workshop once or twice per hour, grab your shit, and get out of there. Stay crouched while you do it. Don't build anything but the basics there. If someone takes it while you're gone, go to Offline mode on Xbox (not sure if this exists on PS4), and change servers. If you have friends with a private world available, or you have one yourself, use it.
---
I totally see your point, but I know some people will pay extra to not grind (see: possum badges).  I paid 30k for that damn High Capacity plan cause I couldn't take it any longer!
---
No I'm not. I like wearing what I have.
---
I've been playing with my boyfriend's little  brother who is 13. He loves video games but he's not the best at combat, much like me. I got him into f76 and he loves all the aspects of it. It's also his first fallout game. I'm not as high lvl as u but I help him out when he doesn't have any radaway or stimpacks. But every time I give him items I explain the mechanics so he can use them better in the future or find/make them himself. I also decorated his camp a bit and he's been saving caps and buying plans as he loves building. Personally I say give him a hand with some things for the first couple times but teach him how to do it himself and then let him provide on his own. Ps you're an awesome dad!
---
2.1k upvotes later... Still no bethesda reply. Post about mini gun spin up gets reply after 40 comments. Are you serious, Bethesda!? So disrespectful to the players who are still playing this crap shoot
---
Hey they dont want their company being badmouthed dont be a shitty company or work for one. Job are a choice. You pick where you work.
---
Thank you ! (:
---
Then you wouldn't be checking up or logging in every weekend to check to see if it is available or not. Padding their login stats
---
"We're sorry hackers are chasing away all the players on PC, here's 500 atoms for sticking around!"
---
Yup
---
&gt;understanding that novice mode is the solo play option
---
dont know what or who gave you that idea, even the misc. mission says "50+ __team__ recommended" 
---
&gt; trying to find key cards which are small in unfamiliar area while enemies just kept re-spawning, it is bad design
---
because its made for a team does not mean its bad design, 2 on gaurd, 1-2 on objectives
---
&gt;how come it didnt boot me instantly?
---
as explained above its a bug, i dont know exactly how it works or what triggers it, all i know from experience is if the player falls through they eventually get booted
---
Appreciate the comment, but I think the last remaining concerns about breaking the storyline went out the window when they added an NCR ranger outfit a cool eighty-some years before the New California Republic was even a sparkle in Tandi's eyes.
---
Yeah, I think so too. I think they wanted something to compete with Outer Worlds. This was their "pay attention to us instead" card, and it backfired horribly, because they can't help but be themselves.
---
Theres a clear difference between using DLL injection to dupe legacy weapons and spawning disarmed mines because you are over the carry weight limit. people are doing the throwable "dupe" by accident all the time.
---
legacy duping is a problem, piles of mines are just silly.
---
. For a high level player there's nothing to do anymore except get on for 5-10mins get the easy atom and get off. (Tuesday mabye 10-20 for the easy weekly)
---
Sierra Bravos are "animals" for purposes of the Hunter's prefix... Might be worth it for those folks running uber-melee builds to hang on to a Hunters (particularly with secondary stars) automatic rifle or smg to get the Bravos to land.  +30% dmg is basically same as first star in any ranged perk x3.
---
Should be better report real cheaters
---
There's a pretty standard setup most mic-free players I play with use.
---
Sick emote - "Dear sir or madam, I find myself in dreadful need of aid. At your earliest convenience, please review my health bar and produce the appropriate aid item to assist." 
---
Gift emote - "I've got something for you, come and get it!"
---
Let's nuke emote - "Let's nuke!" or "Anyone have any nuke codes?"
---
Follow me emote - "Follow me" or "get your ass over here, I'm dropping a nuke!"
---
Scared emote - "Danger/enemies near me. Please approach and prepare for combat."
---
Taunt/PvP emote - "Shit, I've been spotted! Engaging, need assistance!"
---
"No" emote - "Nope, never going to happen."
---
I second this.  They have been able to give me atoms whenever this bug happened.
---
I really don't understand what people expect them to say. It's already been stated that ANYONE remotely connected to Bethesda would get SHREDDED on this platform. Any PR rep sent out will NOT be able to revert the decisions everyone is mad about, and any quote they could possibly say will just be painted as "pandering" or "PR weaseltalk".
---
What exactly could they say that could possibly make the raging mob listen?
---
That‚Äôs what should happen after every ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù event ends, they could even just add different rewards so the other ones stay rare. Why do things with 76 feel so lately added in and rushed? It‚Äôs a shame because the Halloween event kept me playing, now it just feels lifeless again.
---
&gt;East Regional Penitentiary.
---
just do us all a favor and never post condescending crap like this.  grow up.
---
Would be nice if they gave away the empty pumpkin bench that never dropped during Mischief Week...üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüò≥üëç
---
Considering it's likely Bethesda will take off between christmas and new year's to be with their families- which they have every right to do and i will wish them all a good vacation-, doing it earlier would also give us the benefit of having them around so they'd be able to fix any bugs if it launches with them (And let's be real, WHEN it launches with them).
---
At this rate another 3,5 years &amp; I'll get there
---
When you say soon, does this deity you worship, tell you of something bad coming?
---
No problem.
---
Strip down and punch things naked. Bonus points for only using food and beverages for health upkeep; extra credit if you only rely on drinking water and food out in the open, without any cooking or additional treatment. Pretend your Big Boss, lather up your cheeks with some grease, then go commando on those muties. Wield a berserker weapon and go Rambo to the rawest. Cook meat, let them spoil, then use it as your only consumable like how the pioneers did it back in the day. The possibilities are virtually unlimited.
---
Who are all these people on a downvoting spree? I'm out, this is clearly a touchy topic. All I said was they arent rare ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
None of these suggestions.....get 3 others whove done the back pack quest then you start it and go to swim area test and have those 3 do it repeatedly. While you dont finish they will n u get xp
---
I really hope so.
---
This is partially true. If you can already see an enemy with the red enemy indicator triangle above their head, you may see them imitating an emote that you or a teammate is also making. You aren't seeing THEIR emote, you're seeing YOUR emote. And you're already close enough to see them anyway. And they can't see your emote.
---
It depends on your mic settings.  I don't remember what it defaults to but it can be set for world chat or team chat.
---
Sneak, sniper build here. I always keep an explosive black powder rifle with me as my "big gun." It's my scorchbeast killer. The sound is so satisfying!
---
I'm curious how you figure these are your crates if you're the last one to get to them.
---
A beta test, maybe on separate new characters. Early access is a no for me.
---
It's a no brainer business decision, beyond me why they don't do this.
---
is two shot not as good anymore?  I don't see it mentioned in this list.
---
HaHa you dick
---
I just feel like it would be a good survival aspect to it since it has that feel to it, being as how there aren't any NPC's and the story of why.
---
‚ÄúAccident‚Äù????? Someone purposely makes their character overweight to purposely and repeatedly spam the button to produce objects to scrap or sell... by ‚Äúaccident‚Äù.... right...
---
You get to keep it, 100%
---
I have had it happened when i have not logged into NW first. It used to happen all the time, did not have it happen for weeks then just the other day had it happen again. Seems like if you go on NW first it is likely to happen but also has a random factor to it. Very frustrating.
---
Because I find it. I tell you it's there and im standing right next to it when you take the bullets out of it while I take the gun.
---
Yo dude did you ever get the mod up?
---
Why? I cant even stay logged in to play for 45 mins without this piece of shit crashing, I cant play NW at all without someone cheating. Fuck this game and fuck Bethesda.
---
Toxic people* and yes they're still prevalent. You can still use tact and be a toxic person.
---
Sociopaths do it all the time.
---
Check your range stat.
---
Unlike most weapons, shotguns deal 0% damage when out of range.
---
Some mod configurations can cause the range to drop below 0 on shotguns. Make sure you get the highest range possible to avoid slap damage.
---
Definitely shrinking from what I've seen.
---
Kay......
---
Do you ever stop seeing players you used to?
---
The free weekend brought a bunch of players to this game on xbox i would like them to do that again.
---
This should have been implemented since launch, or have certain events or enemies that give 2x Xp every week just to give people a goal and something to look forward to....gonna be a long contentless winter for sure.
---
I will probably not play on a private server any time soon (so no, I was not)
---
Probably wouldn't, Nukashine doesn't. Probably XP if they did the usual cranberry bonus. That recipe would go for loads of caps then
---
I'm really not concerned about people having a ton of mines.. they are too heavy to carry a ton of, and its only worth 1400 caps a day...
---
and as for the steel, you realize people are using cheat engine for infinite ammo...  there are much bigger problems in this game than piles of mines that wont go off or piles of cleavers that take ages to spawn and scrap. have you seen the videos? its not faster than just clearing westek for weapons and scrapping them for 20 steel each, the cleavers are 1 steel each and you have to produce, pick up, and scrap them one by one. its NOT a viable way to mass produce steel.
---
hell, if you just craft and scrap lv1 leather armor with super duper, you get more steel than you started with. is that a dupe too? no, its slow and less efficient than normal farming, just like the cleavers.
---
I was going to ask same thing but realized, much like the subsequent poster did, that the monthly atoms should credit on the theoretical monthly renewal date. I bought the year subscription, so the day of the month I bought it is when (I assume) my atoms will credit.
---
Losers in denial downvoted you. The truth hurts.
---
That perk that gives xp bonus and the perk that raises charisma per team member. Higher payouts and more xp on missions.
---
directly craft.. no
---
some kind of scrip... or just the current scrip used to re-roll a star.. yes please sign me up
---
How do you think it would feel different if it were changing?
---
I'm seeing less high level players, but a lot of new low level players(Could be alt characters). But I would guess the player base has dropped, I know I haven't seen some of my friends playing since survival was removed. 
---
I expect to see returning &amp; new  players when wastelanders comes out.
---
Yeah, I meant to add onto that. I'd say it stays about the same. Most pop in and out. I'm a big trader so a lot of the people on my friends list are still grinding away
---
Does that happen after a long time playing?
---
Yeah, when the duping was going crazy and people had like 250,000 TSE handmades etc on them it crashed the servers but at least it armed the populace 
---
Yeah a stalkers pool cue was probably my greatest üòÇ
---
Idk I prefer to have it on time periods where there are new rewards for nuclear winter hehe
---
Kaboom!!
---
If Fallout 1st can't be relevant as it stands, it really brings to question if it should be relevant at all.
---
Idk if that'd do the trick for retaining players, since most players in the endgame have more levels than they know what to do with.
---
Now wait until you hear french Canadian swear word you will understand even less
---
"Ostie de collisse kess√© qu'y fait ak sa tabarnak de  build de one shot tous les simonac de legendary icitte"
---
But why would they do something they can't directly monetize? Maybe if you pitched it as a thing that they can sell in the store instead.  "Only 500 atoms! double xp for 48 hours or Monday at noon EST, whichever comes first"
---
Might be a little much at that point but I do agree they need more recipes. Make the Nuka Factory a workshop cowards. And add that blaster
---
Honestly, until you build up a nice inventory to keep up with ammo needs you might be happiest with a melee/gatling gun build.  Gatling guns won't cost you too much and doesn't chew through ammo.  You can wear power armor (pretty easy to find) and stay well protected until you find decent armor pieces.  My 3rd character is my commando and I didn't play it much until I had gear to pass along.
---
If you want to do commando then I'd recommend carrying a handmade, 10 mm smg, and automatic pipe rifle.  That way you can use 10 mm, .38, and .556 ammo.  Only bring out the handmade for the harder to kill enemies.  Good hunting to you.
---
So we go from blasting raiders in the face watching the eyes and teeth fly through the air to making fkng egg nog.this is the dumbest game in a long time.
---
Oh you mean like having 3/4 of the daily/weekly challenges autocomplete w/o rewarding the atoms? You mean like that kind of switching-from-NW-to-Adventure kind of bug?
---
Right now, there is a Legendary Module you can buy from the Purveyor that applies to craftable things like the Solar Armor.  It's easy to see how you could expand that to be whatever type of weapon you choose to craft, although not being able to see the module's perks before crafting makes it kind of annoying.
---
Candy Crush is free to play, paying for the game in order to access it means not free to play, Skyrim isn't free to play
---
How do some people even dress themselves in the morning?
---
And make it taste like coconut
---
I‚Äôve traded a lot too, 550 or so on my friends list. I see the same thing you do.
---
The fact that they've said wastelanders is free for everyone multiple times the past year is a pretty good indication
---
I want to see a video of this. Even a staged one would be fine. Can the servers handle it?
---
My gues is another meat week for Thanksgiving. Maybe with the introduction of the new radgobbler boss, a legendary Turkey with 3 heads, razor sharp talons, a beak hard enough to crush rocks, lightning speed to rush you with, and poison.  ( lol kinda sounds like that old pokemon now that I think of it) Introducing the new talon dagger plan, poison quills, and a badass radgobbler suit with mask. All followed up by a nice purveyor sale on black Friday. :)  
---
Just a pipe dream though
---
It‚Äôs all well and fair they take time off... but... shouldn‚Äôt they already have seasonal events... already made.. so they can just flip the switch?
---
They're not gonna officially do mods like that, it's an online game.
---
It doesn‚Äôt effect me nor does it bother me but all you‚Äôve mentioned is either duping or cheating the system period. 
---
Super duper is literally a perk card which gives you a chance to produce extra and is part of the game. 
---
Which part of the game allows you to produce free mines or other throwable sans sell them or scrap them for nothing? 0
---
So whether it‚Äôs a dupe of a TSE, armor, Nuka cola or a mine in the end is a dupe/cheat so there is no way to justify it. 
---
Wrong is wrong and not part of the game or intention of any built mechanics of said game. 
---
So if you want to justify the current dupe of throwable but dead set against TSE duplication it‚Äôs kind of a hypocritical stance since neither is part of the game.
---
Honestly, I'm more prone to find out about it through either the web site or Twitter...
---
It's good if it gets posted about a lot, OP. That shows Bethesda we want it. Ain't nothing wrong with that
---
Yes, the fallout 1st subscription is right up there with starvation and police brutality. Very serious indeed.
---
First you need 4 people.
---
You give 2k caps to 1 to go to lucky hole mine in an excavator armor to pick up lead ore and switch server and repeat. After, make him go to collision course, on a server that has 3 crates, tell him to pick up the pre war money, close app and rejoin. He should be able to loot back the pre war money again.
---
Now while he does that, you and the other 3 friends, go do the vault raid mission meltdown or the one right afterward. (I do this on meltdown so il explain the step for meltdown). You go with 2 player sharing rad sponge and with ghoulish level 3, so your health will never drop. You unlock the engineering section, but do not complete any quest marker. Cricket will spawn, you loot them, after they stop, you ft out and restart over. 
---
After 3 or 4 runs you buy the acid from your 3 friends. Each run is 400 acid per person, so that is in total for 4 runs 6400 acid if you got it from every one there.
---
You get the lead ore and raw cloth from your other guy.
---
All of that was an hour and a half. The rest is you pressing x for 2 hours with ammosmith and super duper and you get like I did 45 000 5.56
---
You can do those step solo to save caps, but its better with friends.
---
Oh and for steel, scrap weapons. Lots of weapons. You guys know where to get steel right?
---
Exactly, but Bethesda has more shit to do with Fallout 1st...
---
There‚Äôs a trick to that! Watch that vid and see how I put them in no more than three at a time. If you take them all out at once, they tend to lag out. Most of us carry a full set so we don‚Äôt have to take them all out and repair on the spot.
---
so one method for infinite steel is okay but another isn't? alright then.
---
Larger, look at all the different user groups here on Reddit and other social media outlets. 
---
There are hundreds of smaller closed groups as well as a thriving trade and selling community. 
---
Look at the amount of money used to buy items and I‚Äôm not talking eBay either.

Hey with me and you all we'd need is 6 more people!
---
I lost count of the number of tickets i have submitted on this issue. All with video evidence.
---
I'm on ps4 it's not impossible to cheat but less common I would think but thank you.
---
Think you are a crybaby whiner who needs to get over yourself. Don‚Äôt have to have first membership to enjoy the game. You get better things making it easier for you in the world ‚Äúyes‚Äù.  But people have already voiced their issues and Bethesda is still banking on the first memberships regarding the whining trolls who want everything for free. Suck it up. Nothing in this world is free.

Literally all we can do is not buy their games in future, nothing else matters to them.
---
They‚Äôll add it just in time for Valentine‚Äôs Day /s
---
It's getting smaller hopefully else gamers deserve games like Fallout 76 + Fallout1st, Madden, WWE 2K20, Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Far Cry and all the other cash grabs.
---
"What are we all thankful for!?"  
---
"BLOWIN' UP CARS!"  
---
"When do we want it!?"  
---
"Wait...what?"
---
Wow, deleted my comments cause you want to censorship and take away my rights of opinion. Way to go. You look like a fool. Honestly don‚Äôt have to have first membership to play and enjoy the game. Get over it and stop whining over the first membership. Hasn‚Äôt stop people from buying it cause all your whining it just gets people more wanting to buy it to despite the whining trolls.
---
They stopped being opinions when you do is talk about how bad the game is to every single post. We dont care to hear it.
---
Same. On PS4, most encounters are simply against skilled players. Either that or somebody is just lagging and teleporting across the map. Still killable though
---
Nuke them thell arm one way or another lol
---
Am i the only one that want power armors only for meta? Power armors in the game should unlock roles in the game (support / tank / dps), if you don't wear a power armor in a "end game" content then you are a nothing. Power armors should have unique strong perks / mods so players can make meta builds for the end game content... This game needs end game only content, for high level players... this content should be playable only with power armors, if you remove the power armor then you don't have enough power to defeat the enemies or to help your team. 
---
(When someone enter a power armor then mutations and some player's perks should be disabled.)
---
there‚Äôs not many on PS4 so your good, mainly pc also xbox has got a amount off them.
---
They spanked the dupers hard if the can figure out the cheaters I'm sure they'll suffer the same fate
---
Pete Hines said it one time before the game was released
---
I'd say give him plans since he'd still need to gather resources.
---
Aye definitely! What platform are you? Xbox here.
---
Yea, don‚Äôt let this crap go on. That just makes the game lag and cause people to have unfair amount of caps and xp they did t work for. Those people are trash.
---
So to make this a thing, we could eventually get a quest from the Nuka Cola Plant's automated systems when it's  rebooted or something, the plant proceeds to launch the new flavor with the help of the Vault Dwellers.
---
It's really funny to read these dev trackers. They only hear and respond the feedback they want to hear. But I can't really blame the CM either, cus they would lose their job if they ever made a wrong comment on fallout1st or lying before the FO1st scrap box; that junks would cause server instability.
---
One can only hope. Im on hiatus until march because there is nothing for me to do in game, i just like to keep up with the goings on. Lol.
---
if you are fine with people having infinite steel from mass crafting and scrapping lv1 leather armor with super duper.. you really should calm down about the cleavers. they are both exploiting flaws in the game design to slowly accumulate steel. wanna have a race? you dupe cleavers and ill run wekstek and lets see who gets 25k steel first.
---
The chances of us ever being able to directly craft a weapon/armour piece that's tailored exactly to our characters is more or less zero I suspect, though a system along these lines might be plausible:
---
 \- Reroll a mod of your choice on an existing weapon, held in check by locking it so once it's rerolled, you can't reroll the other 2.
---
\- Applying the currently existing crafting kit to a weapon/armour piece to convert it to a legendary (maybe an option to pick 1 to 3 stars with the cost increasing accordingly) and again, if only 1 of the mods can be rerolled. 
---
\- Perhaps devise an option tied into that which allows legendary gear to be scrapped and it rewards scrip at a lower amount than the exchange machines rather than the legendary mods. That gives you a choice, hold onto it for the reset for a bigger payday or top yourself up if you're just short of what you need or have to free up space.
---
That said, if that was a path they went down, they'd either have to flag the item as untradeable/unsellable or clearly mark that it has been rerolled so whoever buys/inherits it knows what they're getting and dealing with.
---

---
Lol sure but
---
I regret buying it at beta because the 80$ edition dropped to 40 a week after, and you can buy the pre order bonus on the Xbox store now too
---
Lol your dumb
---
Mmm if they allowed people to do that they would honestly probably get more subs. The pull of getting 3300 atoms all at once would be too great for some. "NOT FALLING FOR YOUR BUNDLE TRICKS THIS TIME BETH"
---
Reckon it‚Äôs getting smaller, judging by the amount of ‚ÄúGoodbye Appalachia and 76! Bethesda did this so I must now stop playing!‚Äù posts lately.
---
You are thick. And probably 13. Have dinner and go nap-nap for school tomorrow.
---
‚ÄúThat outfit?‚Äù
---
There's no way Nuka Cranberry would have real cranberries in it.  
---
Given the information we have on the prototypes from the Kanawha plant, it'd likely be red house paint, or blood, or some kind of crimson isotype.  
---
Hell, maybe we have to hand mix ultracite with Quantum and that turns it red with a "real cranberry flavor!"
---
Lone Wanderer was a recent flair addition at a [redditor's request](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/da8rjd/add_lone_wanderer_to_the_flair_list/).   
---
I was pleased to see it added.
---
Yeah, so if a team member agros a mob or breaks Pacifist, etc...
---
Ps4. Cross platform needs to be a thing already lol. Just let pc stay by themselves as the master race they are with all their cheats and exploits.
---
Glowing skeleton outfit you need 14k NW xp before the 12th
---
Is there a picture of said outfit?
---
Don't be butthurt pls my man
---
Seems very active on PC.
---
Thank you for the update. 
---
So basically what ive done is all i can do and i have to wait for a moderator to see it and hope they agree?
---
i honestly think bethesda doesn‚Äôt care.
---
What? You dont lose the outfit.
---
I have an instigating bp rifle with a vats and sentinel perk that‚Äôs great for reducing health from a distance as a stealth sniper, but switch to other weapons after the first one or two shots as the enemy closes the distance to me.
---
I've been trying to get this to work as well. My theory is to use a "chain" of black powder pistols in different favorite slots, so that you could literally do "pirate style" and shoot one (skip reload), switch to the next, fire, (skip reload) and then on to the next. VATS kinda gets you stuck in reload sequence. I think one key is to take advantage of the "renaming" feature so that each gun has a unique id for the favorites (otherwise game confuses them). Speed Demon mutation helps with reload speed, Bandolier perk with ammo weight. Now that legendaries drop, I think this is getting more viable.
---
For the medium and small boxes, if you and another person are so close to them that you both can instantly grab items out of them AND the other person somehow hasn't noticed this, I recommend not telling them. Just grab the loot.
---
For large crates, if you and another person are so close to them that you both can instantly grab items out of them... Well, they beep. You can't lay claim to it because you told the other person that the bright orange, beeping box exists. Probably best that you just get there first and stay quiet about it along the way.
---
Oh, no doubt there are people who use hacks. However, the 76 crowd are so terrible at aiming that pretty much anyone who has played a multiplayer shooter before can noob stomp. 
---
And Bethesda haven't seemed to got the message that the 76 fanbase suck at shooting, and absolutely detest it too. People complained about "one shots" so much they made damage caps and removed any sort of skill based combat from the game, and made it about 95% about your build and how it compares to your opponent's. Bethesda removed marsupials because some people couldn't lead their targets, etc etc.
---
I experienced two freezes over the last two, 4-hour sessions. Xbox 1 (old) direct wired to the modem, modem served by 1 gbps fiber coming from a dedicated (unshared) node. This was while opening exterior doos leading into an internal cell, once on private server, once on Adventure server.
---
I'm sure it's getting smaller or at best staying the same. They haven't released new content for a while and they won't until next year.
---
 I try to log in every day but find myself getting bored very quickly these days. Now I'm just playing other games to kill time until Wastelanders.
---
 I'm sure the population will be booming again once Wastelanders and the other updates (like legendary player system ect...) drop
---
If not for a caps cap initially, we'd have multiple multimilionaires on day one thanks to glitches.
---
It was rational initially. It should be continuously and progressively increased now.

---
seriously?  why don't you just go find another game that you enjoy and let the players who still like 76 do our thing?   Or let me know what games you are really enjoying and I will go on a mission to destroy that game even though I'm not playing it... unbelievable.
---
Congrats, great story!
---
I'm not, I have $12.99 available for leisure.
---
I think staying the same. All sane people left it long ago, and "true fans" literaly dont care about anything
---
Always thought about this, if you reach level 300, maybe 400, you just get Fallout 1st. Just free.
---
Offline mode on Xbox Live makes it so that a griefer can't follow you from server to server using your Xbox Live profile. Sorry about that, my wording wasn't as accurate as it could have been.
---
We can craft legendary armor like the solar armor from the vault raids, so being able to craft legendary weapons in the future wouldn't be a surprise for me.
---
already deleted the game there is no going back unless they trash the paid shit, and give us the scrap box
---
Totally. NW is my jam. Its awesome. I feel really bad for pc guys that basically can't play it. Cheating is non existant on xbox, with the exception of dudes hiding in the university glitch and a rock on the mountain you can climb in.
---
Seriously... how the fuck does any of my words that I wrote say or even speculate that I‚Äôm fine with it at all??? Are you just stupid or a troll? Or both? 
---
What part of anything I said whatsoever gives you the impression I‚Äôm ok with duplication of anything???? 
---
Learn to read dude or whatever you are... 
---
Race yourself...
---
Thank you! We‚Äôre very excited!
---
I‚Äôm imagining op putting on clown makeup as he finishes typing that sentence
---
And it might help if others express the same desire.
---
Left the game a few weeks ago when first came out not even that is enough for me to come back, if they get rid of fallout first and make it free and maybe just private worlds can be monetized, until then I will not be returning to the game.
---
&gt;Because since BETA we can't have more stash due to the game not being able handle
---
We've had multiple stash increases since beta. It has doubled in fact. 
---
Second it's only junk that is unlimited for 1st, not all stash. For junk the sever does care if you have 1 spring or 10K springs, it doesn't individually track them like it does weapons,  armor, aid, etc.
---
Hasnt seemed to work with other games doubt its gna work here
---
10% while aiming is incorrectly described. It works all the time, hipfire, aiming, VATS.
---
It means 10% while aiming is 2nd greatest damage increase from 2nd legendary perk. It doesn't change the projectile to explosive, and doesn't trigger anti-explosive damage reduction effects some stronger monster have. It doesn't put monsters into caution. It doesn't give a damn about fireproof nor dense chest in PvP.
---
And it's actually the best 2nd star for bloodied sneaky sniper.
---
Give up on two shots, they're universally weaker than anti-armor and their accuracy is non-existent.
---
Some necessary (but not sufficient) conditions to let \*money\* resource limitless are:
---
1. You can ensure none will obtain it in illegal way, like duplication items - not ensured today.
---
2. Money must be somewhat hard to obtain - currently it is not.
---
3. Players have some significant more need of money than it can be generated. (aka, money sink). We currently have some real expensive plans to buy, but nothing we could spend tons of money forever like the infamous "Gamble" from Diablo.
---
let money limitless now would only create an absurd inflation, followed to make money useless (because everybody would have plenty of it).
---
That might be a reach. Lol.
---
Get XP boosts. Raise your INT with brain fungus soup and berry mentats.
---
Do not loot. Just kill and fast travel.

Super Mutants &gt; Ghouls &gt; Moles &gt; Scorched
---
I could see adding legendary affects at random using some sort of scrip or cap purchase. 
---
I'd prefer it be random but it might be nice if you could select it too.
---
I‚Äôve noted on Xbox that there are fewer players on the Adventure servers even on the weekends. That being said the people on those servers are usually a mix of a few mid-level players (under 100) outnumbered 2-1 by high level players (level 100-300). I haven‚Äôt seen a player over 300 in a month. The last ultra high level player (301+) was an 856 buying odd ball plans from my vendor.
---
Hello, I was thinking the same just few days ago. Could be cool a system where we can try to make legendary perks at normal weapons and try to get certain specific perks too,for exmple paying caps and fluxes an NPC that do it! We should deserve more to have legendary without have to wake up every day hoping to have lucky. It's my thought :)
---
Damn- that really hit close to my mark
---
You're missing the point. They have a good weapon and good armor. I have a double barrel and no armor. They take the ammo only to keep some rando from getting it instead of letting their teammate have a decent weapon. Not once. Not twice. But THREE times in the same game. I'm literally standing right there and I say dude can I get that ammo for the gun. But no, they're jackasses. Plain and simple.
---
Bashing attack is too weak. It can be really good on Shredder minigun.
---
Bashing just isn't necessary when you can already kill mobs in one shot.
---
This skill needs a big rework. Right now it is just underwhelming.
---
Eh... I got these items for free. I don‚Äôt really feel like gauging fellow wastelanders.
---
Upon subscription renewal if monthly, or on the monthly anniversary date if annual.
---
I was just having a laugh with the "dick" comment haha. Nah, you get to keep all the bonus items if you unsubscribe. You keep the Scrap Stash too, you just can't add anything to it.
---
Yeah! Shame bud, we could've started a wee helpful group!
---
Eso was better recieved than fo76. 
---
I wouldn't expect ppl in this sub to accept that truth though. 
---
Btw i play the game and its still a shallow hollow game.
---
Indeed.
---
&gt;What part of anything I said whatsoever gives you the impression I‚Äôm ok with duplication of anything???? 
---
uhh when i explain that crafting and scrapping lv1 leather armor with super duper makes infinite steel, this is how you replied.
---
&gt;Super duper is literally a perk card which gives you a chance to produce extra and is part of the game. 
---
ya know, you can get infinite screws with the same method of crafting and scrapping assaultron heads. get with the program buddy, bethesda doesnt care about infinite junk and neither should you.
---
So do I. So does everyone who can afford a PS4, PS Plus every month, videogames, a good ISP...
---
I just can't justify spending even more money than I already have in a half assed ~~cashgrab~~ videogame.
---
He has shown us his holy visions and shared with us his warning.
---
No. They are not going to hide missions behind a paywall.
---
That is fantastic. Congratulations to you both!
---
Go for damage early on. The enemies get insane HP scaling for an open world game.
---
Get one of each tier for your desired weapon type (9 cards in total). This way, you can tweak your damage to fit your target and dump the rest of the points into utility later when you complete your build.
---
8 Crazy Nights at Freddys?
---
How do you know how what mods affect AP cost?
---
Thought. Do you help out other players a lot? Maybe we could do something and cover both platforms? For others.
---
After all this nonsense, its just got me very hesitant every time they say anything. Im exoexting the worst now. That way I cant be let down.
---
This is not correct. If you solo her, she lands very regularly and here's why:
---
If the majority of people are on the building and have her aggro, she won't land.  She wants to land on them but she can't. If someone is very nearby in one of her typical landing spots (usually an open area, I'm not suggesting she has set places to land), she may land. However, the people on the building are typically bunched together, are shooting her in the air, and have her aggro.
---
She has a sequence she goes through. If she is staggered in the air, this causes her to skip the landing portion and usually will crop dust you. If she can't land, she will do this fairly often. It's not much of an issue if you are solo and she can get to you. If a limb gets crippled, she will land.
---
Here's something you can replicate on a multiplayer server: stand in an open area--behind the building is good. Shoot her enough to gain her aggro. Sometimes you have to compete against other players for the aggro since they are shooting her too, so you have to deal decent damage. Shooting her in the head if you can helps a lot. Once you gain her aggo she will land right at your feet. You know you have her aggo because she will turn her attention to you and circle around right at you--be mindful to maintain aggro, but once she does this, you're good. I've replicated this many, many times for obvious reasons. It seems, this part I'm unsure but seems to be the case, that the person dealing the most damage/has dealt the most damage, is the one to gain her aggo.
---
I hope this helps.
---
I'd say smaller due to stagnation.  Wastelanders being delayed then fallout 1st exlusives being pushed down our throats is going to send ppl packing.
---
The whales will stick around of course
---
I am part of a faction and we help out new players. If I see a low level while I am now busy I will investigate to see if they need help.
