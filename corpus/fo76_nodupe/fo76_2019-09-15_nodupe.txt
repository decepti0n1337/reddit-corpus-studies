Yea, it starting to look like i will scrap my unneeded perks and just it on the coins for a week or two before making any decisions.
---
---
---
Far from it.
---
There's hardly a market as it is. I've spent two weeks trying to sell really good weapons on Discord i nthat channel and i got no responses, just a mindlessly repost every fifteen minutes or whatever it is.
---
Can someone remind me what category they appear under when looking at a vendors icon on the world map? I’ve heard conflicting things and not many people seem to sell them in my region so I can’t test... I want to buy them for my alt but can’t ever seem to find them.
---
Well, I'm not saying the nerf is like dying, I'm just saying that the acceptance process is the same. I will never have my same damage again
---
Sounds good, ill jump on now
---
You know, 150 years ago, people only had kids so they had extra labor working in the factories and mines and fields.  You are parenting wrong.  Take the day off and send your kids off to work for once.
---
That sounds like the worst idea. They know why bloodied is the mist popular, right? Because fighting bullet sponges isn't fun.
---
I think it's misc
---
Thank you so much!
---
The 4th and 5th star slots should be for QOL legendary effects for weapons/armor. And you can upgrade using modules
---

---
Weapons: more durability, more accuracy, weight decrease, less recoil etc.
---
Armor: more durability, weight decrease, specific resistances like rad/poison/energy/balistic etc.
---
This can free up alot of QOL perk cards for more important perks. Or you can stack them to max out stats.
---
No, but basically all damage bonuses are added together now instead of multiplied together, which results in a lower output for people stacking a lot of buffs.
---
Never.  Never stop saying this.  amriddle01 doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.
---
What's stupid is that...someone please clarify, wouldn't it be easy for Bethesda to go and check [Odealo.com](https://Odealo.com) and see what weapons are glitched or what effects or stats are glitched, and then cross reference in their own systems and go "Holy shit, this IS bugged, fix this, we found it." 
---
I'm guessing not since the weapons are an INDIVIDUAL statistic they'd have to track and not a whole subtype of weapon that's bugged, but still. You'd think Bethesda with all their money would start buying the ewapons just to find the fuckers with them, ban them, remove the weapon, and just get the fear out there that Bethesda is actively trying to find them, mabye scare off a few people. 
---
You know...if they cared about the balance of their game, which we know they don't.
---
Yea probably best. Ima just grab rank 1 of my desired perks for now and keep an eyenon the PTS forum before committing. I dont play much more than 2- 2.5 hours a day max. So between dalies and what not, i dont grind many levels so going to be a kittle hesitant.
---
Fallow through, take one for the team, ammo factory, whats rads and funky duds to start on my gunslinger, undecided for my 6th slot, be a few weeks before its unlocked anyways.
---
Heard
---
Spend it maybe?
---
There is a rage chronicles video where he was doing the Uranium Fever event and he deactivated the event on the pipboy.
---
After that, the yellow icon of the event disappears and he puts himself in front of the gunshots of the other players. 
---
PvP starts and he kills the players on the event.
---
Don’t know if is still possible though.
---
Sorry about my broken English.
---
I don’t like the sound of One Wasteland at all. There’s nothing appealing about this change in the slightest. So awesome I need to use half my camp budget on turrets, spend more ammo, and repair my weapons and armor more often. Big vault boy thumbs up.
---
Evil giggle
---
aww, bless
---
I don't think I've ever had to repair a set of PA so personally I'd say no.
---
X01/T51b or SH/T65 is the way to go. or excavator I guess.
---
But like, WOW has a limit of like 200k, idk why its so low for fallout.
---
Are they cancelling their pre-order? Day 1 players remember the posts...
---
People were desperate to brigade the game with bad press before it was even released or played. There was 0 news and the *main sub* was already complaining about things. All we had was a trailer. I mean Bethesda didn't help by fucking up loads of stuff and proving some of them right though.
---
T-65 is regarded as the best PA right now. That or maybe Strangler Heart.
---
I just need 3 points. Take my Radicool and go punch bad guys.
---
Any of them are fine. we're talking a few caps and a few percent damage reduction difference between them. Granted I'm level 300+ so I may have a different view point
---
Good.  I love grinding Lucky Hole Mine daily to have enough ammo to fight Earle 1-2x a week.  Gonna be a more special event now that I can only afford it less often.
---
4-5 legendaries are pointless, they're just a stupid prestige thing. People are SOLO'ING BOSSES WITH \*\*TWO\*\* STAR WEAPONS, eithe rbecuase they're duped, or the build itself is broken (bloodied commando/sniper/melee, etc etc etc etc etc).
---
There is no performance or growth increase by getting a much higher star legendary, ANYTHING bloodied or junkies is going to do insane amounts of damage, and at that point it's just you farming enough stimpaks and med-x's to just sit there and beat the shit out of the boss. The legendary armor isn't that hard to come by either, and in a lot of cases the perk cards give you effects that make you very tanky or have lots of effective health. 
---
So like...4-5 legendaries, who cares lmao
---
It's definitely a word all right.  But is it a *good* word?
---
I always thought we needed more server options. One of my ideas was to have a server with extreme weather patterns that lasted much longer. It would also have more strong and weird enemies and also, preferably, be PvP.
---
So glad i stopped playing before that time, probably wouldve ruined the game for me, i just returned a week ago and its been a blast, i even convinced the guy who i played with at launch to play it again w/ me.
---
There are a few price guides out there usually use them for my vendor when I do put it up might be a bit cheap but all my aid goes as soon as someone turns out to my camp high turn over is better than taking up space for weeks
---
Power armor breaks so slowly does it really matter?
---
That's my situation as well I feel bad
---
I am very excited. I  look forward to seeing what this new season has to bring. 
---
On another note, if it is at all possible, could you please post more on the legendary perk Cards, I have yet to see any real details on this subject, other than 3rd party sources, In which I find to be slightly misleading, and not covering the full features and details of this new addition to 76. Or could someone possibly direct me to a direct link on this subject provided by Bethesda it self, incase I have missed something?! I would appreciate it greatly. I am kind of surprised it wasn't incorporated into the newest inside the vault, under the consideration it being introduced tomorrow. 
---
Thank you again for all your efforts on keeping this game moving. I greatly appreciate it. 
---
I truly wish you, and everyone all the best! 🙂
---
A million times, this. I can't stand this damn message. I hate the accent the lady is using. The oddly worded sentence about salvage. I can't stand it
---
Yeah, I misremembered the end date and got worried when I saw the date that day. I logged on as fast as I could and I breathed a huge sigh of relief. Then I noticed the option was greyed out. Missed it by about 6 hours and got super bummed out that I grinded so much just to miss the last 5 levels. :,)
---
This, same with Straggler Heart.
---
Oh.......  
---
After all this time one char at 118 and another who hit 50 last night I'm still learning. I just want to make sure my shooty stick kills things big boom fast so they die easier.  
---
Seeing the HP bar do that as of late is so weird. That's not how it has been for the shotgun char. I noticed last night my Rifleman char's rifles started doing the same thing.
---
I reckon they drop this coming update. They're not there on PS4 right now iirc.
---
Exactly, and to further your point on their wealth too, here's another kicker:
---
Now lets just say we're two really sensitive players hypothetically, and we like to play fair, and we like to see others play fair. 
---
Now lets also say we like some items in the Atomic shop and we also like the idea of paying for Fallout 1st. 
---
So now we're in a position where we are willing to spend more money on Bethesda,
---
Now what happens when we come across thousands of instances where we are not only denied loot from a boss, but we can't even complete events due to Exploiters, Cheaters and the likes, and then we decide "Well, this is crap, I'm quitting now".
---
Bethesda has just lost potential profit, which within international law standards in quite a few countries is an essential lawsuit for economic harm. 
---
So not only are Bethesda proving complacency on this matter, they're also losing money in the process.
---
literally explain to me how it takes days of preparation? It doesn't matter how long it takes someone to get a build together to one shot bosses. The fact remains once that build exists, they can one shot for the rest of the games life, and that's a problem. The build should never one shot to begin with, bosses should not be one shot in any multiplayer game ever. 
---
I also hardly think the buying of duped weapons is less of an issue than people make it out to be. It doesn't really matter. Either it's a duped glitched weapon that's killing the Queen in under a minute, or it's a squad of bloodied/junkie gatling users, or it's one guy that armed himself to the teeth with a full heavy bloodied build with chems, mutations, all the buffs, and he's just solo pumping the queen's scorch bootyhole by himself. Is that a problem? Not really, until it becomes a fucking norm.
---
Lucky hole and the train yard for the acid to smelt it
---
Too bad doesn’t matter for those of us on iOS
---
Level 177 here. I still haven’t done Rose’s quests. No interest in doing so either.
---
No. It never was. Since power armors do not break. When they do it's extremely rare and people have abundance of repair kits.
---
T-65 is the best power armor at this moment.
---
Nope, they respawn when a player arrives at the area for the first time that session.
---
[removed]
---
Good man!
---
Good.
---
I guess, but I feel like it is still pretty shitty to describe how a change is not intended to feel like a nerf overall and how it will lead to easier balance/buffs, but then it goes live as a major nerf across the board with no buffs. If BGS came out and said hey we are reeling in damage output that would be one thing, but they have pitched this change as quite the opposite
---
My camp is on an acid extractor, and I get plenty of acid killing Earl’s demon spawn.  I found recently that I can’t just server hop anymore to refresh the mine.
---
Don’t forget the obligatory eulogy of so and so who will never play this game again and so on and so on, paragraph after paragraph
---
I’m not that mad about it. I’ve been running a vampires fixer and an aa-e laser rifle.   More than anything I’m excited for the one wasteland due to my friend finally got a gaming pc so they’re only around level 10 and I just hit 80.
---
I think the biggest issue is that builds that are really unoptimized are just gonna go down the toilet. Bloodied will be worse, but thing about pistols and snipers. I’m on console so I haven’t played the pts, but I am worried.
---
I don't think they ever can stop duping for good. Players will keep looking, trying to bug out every menu, break a calculation, lag out a server... GTAO still has sites dedicated to finding dupes and that game is yeeeears old. For some people that's the fun: working together to accomplish a goal. Not a goal I approve of but a fun goal to them.
---
Although sometimes the rockstar devs patch them in a few hours, which is crazy quick compared to Bethesda.
---
Tldr: dupers aren't Bethesda's fault. Not patching quick enough is their fault.
---
I'm a basic rifle build with one good gun for my build,I'm so dead lol
---
Good deal. Enjoy the new armor, it's good stuff... especially if you were using t51 before like me.
---
the only way i can viably see Bethesda dealing with hacked and duped glitched weapons is putting in an auto ban system that will ban EVERY single player that does a certain amount of damage in a certain amount of time. If you chunk even 1/10 of the scorchbeasts health in no more than one second, the system automatically flags/bans you. 
---
From there, yes, people will be innocently banned for whatever reason, and they'll appeal, and then Bethesda will manually go through logs with the ban appeals adn check for themselves if the player is legit or exploiting. That would take a lot of community backlash and a bit of manpower to do, but it would work in the end, but Bethesda won't do that. 
---
I'm not sure why it's so hard to just make a system that detects if someone days above a threshold of damage in under 1-3 seconds, and then auto bans them. How is that hard? If a player nukes a third of the Queen's health in two seconds, auto ban him. H'es obviously fucking hacking. Let them fucking appeal and manually check.
---
Any word on shotguns? I will be pissed if this gets nerfed again. I have been playing this as my main since launch. Not to speak out of turn. 
---
I wish you all the best! 🙂

---
This is my current build it's to my liking  i can use explosives like a fat man if there's too many mobs and i can if i want switch some cards in strenght and get a big gun or shotgun build. It's a little safer than going full damage but less than playing in power armor with full health this is my ideal build though for pure damage you'll need to take all 3 card of slugger and sacrifice barbarian, with that build you'll die easily (i don't die this often but you can die easily) but can deal a decent of damage : one shoot charred ghouls, deathclaw ect but you need to be warry of any group of enemy with ranged weapons and bugs, bqsically your worst enemies would be 1st mr gutsys in group with the high rate of fire, high penetration, then human/super mutants that get automatic weapons, then ghouls especially groups of charred ghouls. With ghouls you sometimes  hit one from a group of two attacking and the hit often doesn't register and you're left with two ghouls hitting you at once and living you with 1 hp or killing you because blocking is hard, sometimes they wait before hitting so you block before they start doing anything and you get killed because you can't hold the blocking.
---
Anyway I currently have all pieces of  armor in unyielding : 3 secret service (arms and chest) and 2 bos combat armor (legs and fyi bos combat armor plan can be found in the grafton robot vendor) i have this coupled with the possum backpack with plate armoring and currently have 500 ish physical armor and 440 energy armor (but it does feels weaker than a power armor might be a bug i don't know). 
---
Important note for the arms mods you want to get weighted with further amplify the penetration of hit (very useful againsts bosses).
---
I deal approximately 1700 damages when i have a little over 20% hp (which isn't optimal for this build but i usually do this to avoid dying from random encounters) and 2000+ damages when under 20%. 
---
If you want do do the most damage possible you'll need to take : whiskey (adds +6 strength) fury (adds 30% melee damage +some damage resist) x-cell (adds +2 to all special points) + melee bobblehead (adds 20 % damage) + groniak the barbarian ( haven't tested them yet since i'm collecting them) + food adding melee damage (food stack up, don't know if they patch it tomorrow) and i haven't done it yet but only with whiskey and psychobuff i manage to deal 700 damage on SBQ and/or earl or 1700 if i manage to hit their heads (to headshot earl you'll have to jump and time you power attack) with this build you can see your hits directly on the life bar of bosses which is pretty cool. For a demonstration of a build similar but more concentrated on full damage best weapon, critical hit, using adrenaline etc just look at this : 
---
https://youtu.be/83eVc3U8eLo
---
Hope this helps if you have any question feel free to ask
---
You right.
---
Honestly I'm excited for more weeklies. I didnt mind most of those. 
---
Working full time the level up daily stinks
---
Now THAT was funny! LOL
---
A few months ago I would not believe  that alot of people have god rolls stashed away that are not being used...now I'm curious what the next guy is hiding away in his stash when I know the insane stuff I'm hoarding in my stash...I got scammed for a handmade before. a B-exp so it's like how the hell can I trust to trade my legacy's?
---
Also way more cap sinks. I would love the ability to start events for caps, like the imposter.
---
Yeah anything above 350-400 caps is excessive af.
---
Exactly.  I've planned a build through nukes and dragons with the legendary system. But a lot of perks are vague at best.  
---
What I'd love is the devs to host a Q&amp;A on here so we can ask questions like...
---
* Is electrical absorption HP healing intended? 
---
* How does Sizzling style work with fireproof and at what levels do returns deminish?
---
* Legendary endurance increases HP, but legendary charisma doesn't allow more shared stars.  Is this intended?
---
* What are the actual values of damage increase on the exploding perks?
---
A lot of stuff is great to test, but these perks require a huge commitment to grind.   It would be nice to have a crystal clear explanation on each card.
---
Because to get Ballistic bock, Bobble heads, The 3x Chem stacks, The Food, The soups, it takes time. 
---
Duped weapons are just duped weapons, if someone trades for one, or gets one given to them fair enough.
---
Glitched in weapons literally kill these bosses in 1 hit. 
---
Duped and Glitched are two entirely different subjects. 
---
A whole squad of Bloodied builds yes they can easily down a boss within a short time. 
---
Which is why I'm not against the calculation change, but what I am saying is that by not REMOVING any of these literal scripted in weapons, 1-shotting bosses will still be a thing. 
---
The bloodied builds aren't 1-shotting SBQ or Earle. Sure they'll one shot the trash legendary mobs, but if you see someone take down Earle or SBQ in less than 3 seconds, that's Black market Glitch weapons AND also the reload bug in action. (I can load 300 rounds into my Bloodied black powder rifle with 50% crit damage, then i can fire it AS FAST AS I WANT)
---
Personal preference really if u look at the dam  difference, ie the damage u take. There's not much in it. Personally I prefer t60 but because I farmed the BOS elder paint, I also have a set of raider as it seem to use less ap, as well as excavator for mining used them all to kill the queen 🙂. FYI raider is well underrated for repairs etc they all give a dmg reduction and rad resistance so just use what u like. With the one wasteland update that may change but probably not lol ,  I'm a  lvl 389 vamp tank and 260isd stealth bloody
---
I want Rose themed camp decorations so I can build a shrine to her. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Best NPC in the game.
---
If only I could use my Nuclear Winter paint jobs on it...
---
A wise old salesman once told me: "It's not stupid to ask too much, it's stupid to pay too much". There will always be people who are willing to pay.
---
What exactly about the core of the engine is dated to such an extent that no amount of upgrading can remedy? What important technology do you think Bethesda needs which cannot possible by included in Creation Engine?
---
Edit: also, unrelated, why do you do the triple space thing? You have to actively insert a blank character to pull it off, so why?
---
I think it should be really hard to beat with a high failure rate, but you should be guaranteed an amazing return if you succeed.      But that would mess with the Skinner box strategy.
---
Our Queen is lonely as we exercise daddy issues on Earle.  She at least gives us repair kits to heal the holes in our armor.  Dealing with her farts is a small price to pay.
---
Once the update hits this week, all of us that like Rifleman builds are pretty much going to be forced into using Commando, damage on slow firing weapons got nerfed to a ridiculous amount.  If you are mostly a solo player and don't care how much ammo you have to waste to kill something then you might be ok. 
---
Vampires on a rifle is a bit of a waste, that is way more useful on an automatic.  You would probably be better off looking for Junkie's, Anti Armour or Instigating, or maybe even weapon specific like Troubleshooter's.  Not entirely too sure what will be the best.
---
I am not sure either which weapon will be better.  A lot  of people say now that Lever action is the best but I like Pipe revolver because it uses pistol and rifle damage perks. (if it started out as a pistol.)
---
You got it
---
Will do

bss meathook fullybuffed with meats and drugs,   crit shotting from stealth, its like 5 shots, pretty much dead upon landing.
---
Nope https://youtu.be/9EeNcV7OxZU?t=293
---
Would be a great idea if Bethesda could pull it off right
---
I was asking about karma and how it works. It was a question.
---
I’m just so excited that I spent so much time acquiring bloodied/unyielding stuff for this to happen. I kinda knew the nerf was coming, but still wanted to shake up my sniper build because I couldn’t damage shit during SBC or ACP. It will be nice to slip back into my CSA and disappear again haha.
---
Like it already is? Most rare items or guns don't trade for caps. I've turned off vending eight months ago because I don't need to sell to the public to stay at max caps. I just sell flux to my friends if for some reason I dip below 25,000. Mostly after a month of fast traveling. I've been sitting at 5000 gold for the last month because I already got the Gatlin plasma, T-65, and SSA. All forms of currency seem to have been trashed one way or another. Today's new currency is Nuclear Keycards.
---
Revolvers aren’t silenced. You don’t get many shots from sneak
---
Medic build for sure
---
Use mines to cripple them.
---
Nah, karma is a pretty bad system. I don't want to have to give purified water to homeless people again.
---
Yes I did it was really fun
---
😂
---
I was going to ask wasn’t sure if Damage Calculation was coming tomorrow? are legacies going to affected by it or remain powerful
---
Repair costs for power armor are pretty insignificant for all types, except maybe the Ultracite set if you are having any difficulty finding enough ultracite. I don't use the perk to reduce how fast power armor breaks and I repair once every 20+ hours of play. Depending on your play style you may find you repair less (if you typically kill from range before the enemy can shoot back) or a bit more often (if you're mostly fighting with melee and/or of you get hit with a lot of explosions). In general, repair costs will very quickly become the least important factor in choosing your power armor. You're better off looking at things like defenses, rad resist, or special bonuses. My personal preference is to run with a full set of T-51b for max physical/energy resistance until I get T-65. T-51b is little low on rad resist but that's easily fixed with the right consumables, and you can get a full set just from scavenging. I also keep a full Excavator set with bonus carry weight on both legs (giving a total of +200 carry capacity) for when I'm going hunting for materials.
---
Black powder rifle worked for me. If you have a power armor frame use that for protection. You should be able to snipe her as she stands on the walkway, run back to previous room while reloading, rinse repeat. Throw a few plasma mines in her path to slow her down.
---
Still isn't 1-shot though. And you're going to the length to buff yourself to high hell AND risking your own life to do that. 
---
I'm all for the calculation change, but my issue is with Magic damage, and also Glitched in weapons. (I shit you not, weapons that WILL kill these things in 1 hit like the fable Alien Blaster laser rifle Gauss powered mini nuke launcher thing).
---
In the long run, without removing those kinds of weapons, all they're doing is slapping us in the face because people will still use them to 1-shot literally anything AKA Earle and SBQ
---
You need to scrap insane amounts of armor pieces to learn all the mods. I'm 293 and still learning some of them on certain armor types and I play quite a bit.
---
So, I was wondering about this.  I only went to Atlas after all the donations started, and it seemed like a waste of space if you couldn't get inside the observatory - was there a time when you could?
---
I bought a 150 from a vendor a few days ago for a hundred caps each. After opening them all I pretty much made up the Caps I lost plus had a bunch of plans for my alt.
---
Back in the day when it was happening and the presents gave you script there were people just dropping legendaries everywhere. They would open a whole bunch of presents, buy a bunch of pieces from the purveyor, and repeat over and over. There was so many legendaries being just dropped into bags it was ridiculous. I probably picked up 50 or 60, actually started getting choosy and only picking low-weight 3-star weapons because just didn't have the space for them.  Those were the good days.  Lol.
---
i recently had the exceeds max on turrets when i have no turrets
---
\&gt; I know that I not only speak for myself but others when I say...it’s gotten old.
---
DUDE people will act like it never happens but being op in a pve game will absolutely get boring.
---
BL3 got pretty boring when I realize Moze is capable of soloing the game without any good guns. BL2 was boring when the bee+conference call killed everything in 2 seconds.
---
So to clarify how the SPECIAL cards work.  They give up to +5 in the stat, but can't exceed 15.  I'm guessing that this is applied before other sources like unyielding armor and aid items?  And on top of the stat bonus, you can actually slot perk cards in using those bonuses, unlike other sources of SPECIAL?
---
There was a raider town built in the ash heap around a small tunnel. Very nice location and built
---
I’m pro damage-recalc and am amused by the predicted whining but fo 1st really is still terrible, best not to lump that in with the rest of it 😅
---
Dude I just sold three one star bloodied for 30000 caps. I’m starting to feel bad
---
Personally I pay up to 500 for them if it's a one off but if buying a bunch 250-300 only, other wise I just supply the mats plus extra so they can give me one and sell one if super procks then bonus for them
---
Some refrencing this want others to know they have supported and enjoyed this game before it was cool or stable.
---
Ain’t nobody but Turtle got time for that!
---
Many people have been putting trade weapons on display with descriptions, but I like your idea of a trade section in the machine itself. Maybe the owner of the vending machine gets a on screen notification "player a would like to make a trade for" and then name the item like it does when you sell a specific item.
---
I like it, because it's so over the top it's hilarious. And doubly so to think Senior Executive Killer Dealer Thorpe had it so bad for her he nuked a dam. She definitely had *somethin* goin on.
---
Level up was my nemesis as a high level. Sure, you can do the alt character mad dash to level 2, but at that point you’re not even really playing the game. At least with one wasteland we can run through some new spots for xp
---
Is this a PC only phenomenon?
---
This is how I'm already playing my character. I can swap from heavy weapons to rifles on a whim with just the annoyance of having to change out a bunch of cards. I'll be happy to get more points in special stats to help with that. Most of the actual legendary perks seem kind of useless so it's an easy choice on what to take.
---
I have a two shot, faster fire reduced weight auto grenade launcher. It breaks so quickly, it kills the fun. It got replaced with a M79. Perfect for events. 
---
The thing about Explosive is your shots in VATS hit with total strength, unlike other ranged weapons. An instigating or Bloodied grenade launcher can oneshoot most enemies with the right build.
---
Just a heads-up, the slow firing rifles got their damage wrecked on the PTS. We'll see tomorrow if they'll buff them at the last minute, but probably not
---
Try them out after the patch and see what feels the best (just FYI: the handmades and fixers can use hardened receivers and use the rifleman perk)
---
I usually share lvl 2 marathon
---
Legacies with effects like bloodied, junkies etc that boost damage output based on x criteria will be effected, they’ll still be the most powerful in the game aside from hacked weapons but will see a damage reduction along with all others
---
You trynna get in on the complaining posts early huh
---
I am on right now. I can give you one for free
---
Nuke em if their prices are too high.
---
It's a glitched weapon like the new lasers that have unlimited ammo capacity
---
I myself wouldn't suggest there not being a limit, however not ever raising the cap limit is just weird. Game has been out for almost 2 years and yet they don't raise it..... Ever. If you look at the lfg on Xbox, people get scammed every 3-5 minutes, something in game needs to be done to prevent this.
---
I like the idea. However, the fact that we can't even climb a ladder makes me pessimistic that this would ever happen.
---
I vote Turtle as next NPC added to game.
---
In all the daily ops I’ve done I’ve never had to just stand and wait. I’m under fire the whole time. People run because the faster you complete them you get better rewards. I run them as a bloodied build also and I’ve had a lot of fun doing them so far. I can’t wait for them to be live in game tomorrow.
---
Running pacifist so
---
I'd hope the Scripted in weapons were a PC only issue, as I'd never wish my worst enemy to have to deal with it. 
---
The reload glitch and Magic damage is on Console though.
---
How about reddit style... Upvotes in the wasteland. J/K
---
Not from what I’ve played
---
This. I do the event often and don't use cores, so, I sell them. 50 or 100 caps, depending on stash space/caps I have.
---
I've always sold mine at 500. And they move frequently.
---
Even if you aren't bloody the prefix is still better than anything non legendary simply because you are going to be shooting things that a lot of the time are shooting back and therefore you will be losing health. So as you are getting shot your weapon is going to be doing more and more damage until you hit that stimpack. Which for me sometimes meant killing something before I went down. And the handmade doesn't have to be automatic for it to be useful. With that being said though, if you ever do go auto it's really hard to go back.
---
Servers offline and the maintenance starts and I-
---
JIZZ. IN. MY. PANTS.
---
They're not. What they are doing is listing them for insane numbers. Just because an item is listed for a price, does not mean it is worth that.
---
True...
---
They should’ve done it so the areas around the nuke area would have rad storms and would lower in severity after the nuke zone went away
---
very valuable on that market we cant mention.
---
Dang so no Unstoppable monster plan?
---
I respawned in the tunnel and running to get back in was when I got the notice of someone taking my junk
---
So I’m full rifleman build and have been running around with a furious handmade with hardened receiver. Obviously not the most convenient setup for that legendary, but probably much more effective than if I converted it to automatic?
---
Cool or stable is still in contention....
---
I only wear my F76 shirt indoors.

All I did was type UPDATE TIME in the search bar and came up with this. Huh. So weird you couldn't find it.
---
Obvious Troll is obvious.  Come on ppl. The user name checks out.
---
Depending on your charisma, you can sell them to vendors for 450-500 caps. Technicly there's no reasons to sell them for lower.
---
But the problem is that if you manage to easily reach your daily 1400 caps cap...you can't sell serum anymore...
---
So you are just better drop their price to 350 caps to make sure you keep selling something.
---
I'm at this point right now, i'm selling too many Stimpaks and Radaways to vendors. I easily get my daily 1400 caps and nobody is buying my 565 caps serums...
---
I'm just better droping them to 350caps. Ppl who are selling them at 500caps+ may just not understand it yet.
---
308, easily. It is the most resource-consuming, so, everyone buys it. 45 and 5.56 come second.
---
2mm also sells quickly. But if you plan to craft for profit, craft 5.56.
---
Stay well rested and exp buff food. Also always do Wise Mothman event at lighthouse.
---
There are plenty of level one cards that come in handy that I’m happy when someone shares them. Good with salt; happy camper; strong back (more useful than a level one in thru hiker or similar because most everyone has those, and strong back is just a flat bump up); travel agent. Level one of adrenaline is good, too, because that’s where you get 70% of the benefit of that card. Strange in numbers if you have some low/mid-level players running with you (“how is it I’m jumping so high?!”). Likewise if I get a low level on the team I’ll share aquaboy.
---
interesting i mainly have are junkies and bloodied legacies and same applies to ballistic guns. Only Gatling plasmas i have various versions of it like stalkers anti-armor vampires two shot. but I'll see tomorrow how everything goes test out to see if my it's all stick to my junkies explosive handmade or junkies faster fire rate  handmade
---
Wait...what?!
---
5.56, .308, and .45.
---
All the factions are built to be shades of gray. A karma system would be pretty difficult to implement in this stage of the game.
---
Sad but so true. Yet here I am, still playing embarrased to mention the hours I've logged.
---
Ok then can you give on to my friend who Is on X-box? His gamer tag is TensiveCat41168.
---
For the bloodied: Lvl 45, Bloodied Bashing +1 perception. Nooooo clue what that means :)
---
I'm taking master infiltrator for sure at least at rank 1. I don't mind the minigames and I used to have a fun little farming route with a bunch of safes I'd unlock. Thats how I made caps at launch. Bethesda later dropped the enemy level in that particular area so I stopped it.  Now everything should be max level!!
---
Aside from that I might just rock QOL perks. It might be nice have the survival shortcut, ammosmith, and What rads active.  
---
Guess we will see. If nothing else I might just roll rank 1 on everything for awhile and see what shakes out!
---
I even have an 10mm with 400 range too
---
My personally most anticipated update for this game! Crossing fingers all goes well
---
Those same confused casuals get shit on in reddit forums for asking genuine questions. The game isn't particularly good about relaying pertinent information, and if you come to reddit for it, be ready for someone to belittle you and imply that you're stupid.
---
People who buy it, need it. And we know they are using a LMG, which practically drinks ammo.
---
I stopped using my bloodied faster fire LMG because I never had enough to make it my "main".
---
Will I be able to have a good time as a junkie build after the update? I like to role play and the junkie is fitting for my character.
---
Nah... Reminded me of a buddy. Never watched it.
---
Something else to add, discovered on the PTS forums, is that each Rank based on how well you did rolls individually:
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/427880/daily-ops-elder-tier-rolls-3-times?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/427880/daily-ops-elder-tier-rolls-3-times?language%5B%5D=en)
---
i.e.
---
Completing a Daily Op on Initiate, Paladin, and Elder each has a separate chance to give a special plan.
---
If you earn Elder Rank on your first try, you will have an 80% chance roll to get one of the special plans, but you ***ALSO*** still get the 10% roll from Paladin level and 5% roll from Initiate as well.
---
Meaning that, *in extremely rare cases*, you can get ***up to 3 Special Plan rewards for finishing a Daily Op***.
---
I like that idea
---
Sleep now in the Mire!
---
Thing that makes my head scratch is I've never seen a fixer drop... am I doing something wrong?
---
A is the better weapon but B is worth more in my estimation. 
---
Really depends on which you will use more I suppose.
---
I concur.
---
Don’t get me wrong you’re bloodied and junkies weapons will still kick the shit out of stuff compared to other guns especially if you’re well optimised you just won’t be one tapping stuff anymore since you won’t be receiving massive multipliers
---
I honestly feel kinda upset about this rebalance, I've never experimented with op bloodied builds, and after this new patch that godlike power will never be accessible again, besides like hacked weapons I guess lol. Wish I would have tried a bloodied build at least once before now, but them's the breaks I guess.
---
You're the second person I've heard this from. Does that essentially make my build nerfed? That would really suck if so...
---
And so it begins. Lol
---
You should see the handmade you can get. Personally the super combat rifle and the gilded glitched .44 are the best for high levels but the pipes are nice since they have max damage for a lvl 1 item.
---
Nice
---
Like Christmas Eve, but your parents are going through divorce.
---
Oh definitely, I just like being able to share the rank 3 stuff because I know it’s rather than the rank 1 and 2 stuff because charisma isn’t helpful with the combat aspects of the game (at least to my knowledge).  But yeah any perk being shared is appreciated as that potentially frees up a spot for a different perk.
---
It's gonna be more difficult for all players. Time/Hits to kill will increase for all builds.
---
I can't comment on the legendary perk but fireproof with a dense torso mod makes you nearly impervious to explosions right now.
---
I had a similar experience today, nuked FP and spawned both events, came to ACP only one player joined me, beat Earle with him/her (can’t remember the PSN ID but it sounded like a woman’s name) then went to join a small crowd at Dropsite and beat the queen. It’s kinda cool to have those back to back events, feels like real ‘endgame’ content.
---
If you’re dedicated rifleman then I’d keep it the way you have it. Handmade can be very viable in semi-auto form, and the extra damage from furious is a nice bonus after each shot.
---
If you ever decided to switch to commando, then you’d find a lot of success with that combo. But for your current build I don’t think swapping to full auto would be a net benefit
---
Now I need a IDGAF emote for when you use it.
---
That’s not what I mean. I just don’t want to have to stop and pull up my pip boy and go the the perk menu and change out however many cards just to open a safe or mod some armor. I don’t know how you would interpret that as not liking RPG’s or understanding how they work. 
---
And in a game like this where you can keep raising your level there should be some way to keep it interesting other than to redistribute the same amount of points you acquire by level 50
---
I bought an instigating lever action off someone, base damage is less than a 50 cal hunting rifle, but it fires faster, and reloads faster. Double damage at full health means a lot of things get one shot.
---
Lot of materials to craft &amp; scrap enough to learn the mods i wanted though. Have seen up to 970 damage on unarmored heads when sneaking + full health.
---
Sbq shows like 30
---
I just use advanced repair kits on them  And it weird my left arm and leg take the most damage.  And T65 being the best is debatable but we dont have to get into it here.
---
I’ve heard that as well. Can’t remember where I read that, but I do think that’s the case.
---
It’s still going to be one of the highest dps builds at full health so yes
---
They are also displaying it in the game
---
I just alternated between main and alt for levels.  Hopefully it isn't everyday again. Mabye just an xp goal...25k or something.
---
Fuck the "market prices". All you do is say: "I have to sell this for 30K" and the weapon is stashed. 
---
Put it in the vendor for 3K. Someone will be happy, you will have the caps and extra space to KEEP PLAYING. 
---
I have bought and sold jewels cheap, and it feels great. Last one was today: powered assassin's marine chest +1 agility. 500 caps. Buttressed and Ultralight. And before that, it was a bloodied faster fire Gatling laser. 2K. 
---
It's a game. Have fun.
---
I appreciate you sharing your honest opinion. I agree with you. I think it’ll be a good thing for more casual players like myself to contribute a reasonable amount to events. As opposed to everyone giving a lot being a bloodied chemmed our fooded out build of some kind.
---
As much as I like the game, I really don’t want to take the time out of my life to dive deep into those mechanics and maintain them every time I play. I like to log in, do my thing until I get bored, then do something else.
---
I sort of love her voice I wish there was a PvP event to interchange the radio presenters, tied to the raiders and settlers. Rose and that other happy bitch representing. And rose plays punk rock 🤷‍♂️
---
They sell to a vendor for 500 with max CHA bonus (which is easy to get). Selling it for anything less than 550 is just throwing away money.
---
The whitesprings UFO
---
Best base I've seen
---
Some mods don’t really do much in general unfortunately. There’s a ton of mods for the “traditional” rifles that don’t change damage, only critical damage or fire rate or something else entirely. The mods I’ve highlighted here are the most noteworthy (in my opinion) since they’re the ones that will impact your damage, and most people want to maximize their base damage above all else.
---
Might have been trying to get the shop steal glitch to trigger.
---
You’re technically losing money at that price, given the vendor tax
---
To every lamp, even your pipboy!
---
Same here, I got my instigating Fixer from Gramps. Grandma just gave me garbage to sell for caps.
---
*A man of culture*
---
Surprisingly I never knew Ace could do that he has an nice use 😂
---
How much detail do you have on this? 
---
Because I’m *vastly* curious if it makes sense to run an op 3 times, once at initiate, once at knight, once at elder, to get the most “rolls” per day? Yes, it’s a big time investment, but you’d be theoretically at a 95% chance instead of a 80% chance (once at 5, once more at 10, and last at 80%)
---
No one does monster mash for some reason.
---
I’d love to compile that type of data but I don’t know the exact “hits” per second for each of the swing speeds. I don’t play melee so I (selfishly) haven’t spent a ton of time looking into that. I’ll look to see if that info is out there for future updates to the sheet.
---
What about the guy who uses a “magic” Lmg or minigun on accident ? We all know Bethesda’s track record with appealing innocent players who were wrongfully banned
---
Once again, little PSA, I’m pro damage-recalc and preparing against the whiners is a great exercise but let’s not lump “canceling fo1st” in with the rest of it because fo1st is still really horrible
---
It was trash in Fallout 4, I out damaged it with a pipe pistol even in that game!
---
I was fairly happy with the B/e/15 I got. I just wish there was a silencer.
---
I have a triple damage switchblade that swings at very fast shit is funny for a lvl 5 item.  No tire irons or chinese swords though. Well yet.
---
Guess that means I am a psychopath
---
Jetpacks are hard to find? Is that why I see them for 1000+ caps clogging up vendors every single time I go around to camps shopping? 
---
Anyone who's ever killed the queen is swimming in jetpack plans. I drop them in the middle of nowhere just so I can be sure nobody will pick them up and sell them for rip off prices in their vendor.
---
I don't know i like Rose. She's the only bot that has a personality. The only one of the robots i like on top of that are Ace and the two male and female bots that are stuck in their loop...lol
---
I play Bloodied unyielding, so, I have like 7 points in Perception, which become 25 when armor and underarmor do their thing. 
---
The smart thing to do, however, is to save some levels, to move special points here and there.
---
Charisma being “helpful” with combat... I think that’s perspective and gameplay style. A lot changed with public teams. I used to run Lone Wanderer at level 4 because of the boosts it gave to AP regen and the 20% less damage. I’ve run a Ch of 7 specifically to run Lone Wanderer at 4 and Tenderizer at 3, and both helped immensely. But, that said, you are correct that for most players - players in teams - yeah it’s pretty light on combat. You have tenderizer and suppressor and that’s about it. If you squint, you can kind of hypothetically see how bodyguards helps in boosting your overall DR but... my armor is pretty good as it is :)
---
I mostly liked the titles you'd get from karma and level in FO3, and role-playing evil versus good characters in that game.
---
If they added it to Fallout 76 they'd need to improve the number of choices you have in quests for it to have a point. Wastelanders was a start in that direction at least.
---
There is a trend in video games for morally ambiguous writing though, which is arguably more interesting and realistic than pure good vs. bad, especially when paired with a faction reputation system. Bethesda painted themselves into a corner though with making the reputation the grind that it is. People either won't want to jeopardize their hard earned faction ratings, or won't care once they've bought their plans.
---
Maybe having some permanently useful, intermediate benefits like increasingly better barter rates and/or a higher cap limit from that faction's vendors would be good, with no hard cap on reputation.
---
I'm thinking the same way  is that even with this damage recalculations is that junkies and bloody will still be more better or just as good as the other legendary weapons just like you said won't be as destructive. I used to use anti-armor handmade, 50 cal, lever action just about everything Anti armor.
---
is a damage output was all right but I feel like these other legendaries like mutants anti-armor, Nocturnal,  need Buffs I don't think I don't think tomorrow is update are buffs, hopefully in future yes
---
People always say they couldn’t find anything with search. It’s hilarious.
---
Yeah and make the nuke also spawn a rad tornado that destroys camps and players in its path. Then players can loot the scrap from the destroyed camps.
---
Bless you Angry Turtle
---
Oh shit, it's on!
---
And furthermore, optimized bloodied melee builds will always deal more damage per hit than any other in game. There are 2 players who just posted a duo kill on the colossus in 0.3 seconds upon the first swing. They show all of their buffs and bonuses and they were using 100% legit in game mechanics. They would also be flagged and given the 2 of them have almost 50k subscribers alone. The outrage would never outweigh the benefit for the players dealing with it on pc
---
I feel your pain lol. Been on vacation for 2 weeks and don't get home until late tomorrow night.  Hope it comes back and praying I don't have to manually update........
---
Other sources don’t give you additional perk points. In the effects tab of your piping you can exceed 15 and that’s where unyielding and other effects go.
---
Allow it to come as a legendary.
---
Ok.
---
I can only share 1 star. I usually do scrapper, because who doesn't need more materials. But after walking into a trap camp, I was able to escape because I had light footed equipped. Thats now my go to.
---
yeah.. they aint brain implants D8
---
They killed it in under half a second yesterday.
---
Happy to do so. I hope some of my info can be of use to you. Keep up the great work with your calculator. It’s an awesome resource for anyone interested in the nitty gritty stats like myself.
---
It is not really losing caps, it allows to get more than the daily 1,400 limit at vendors.
---
much ado about nothing
---
They were in the PTS, they *should* be in patch 22 tomorrow
---
by your response I can assume you have it?
---
Hilarious is when someone builds a whole field of them and leaves the terminals unlocked so I can change all of them to start producing gamma rounds.
---
But you are not seeing the big picture: most of us sell serums in our machines when vendors have no more caps.
---
Lol damn I wish i did that.
---
It’s too bad that the time frame they would have happened already passed, that being from around October 2077 (immediately when the bombs fell) through around October 2087. That’s when Nuclear Winter would have happened.

---
If you complete a Daily Op on Elder on the first run, you will still get rolls for the lower accomplishments as well.
---
But that doesn't equate to 95% regardless. It's still one 80% roll, one 10% roll, and one 5% roll. You don't just add the numbers together. They are independent of each other. The odds of all three combined only raises it to about 83%. It's still quite possible to get Elder on your first try and get nothing for the day.
---
who is dualwielding?

I have a camp in the Ash Heap; the Flyswatter Vertibot tends to spawn right above it, meaning I get to hear Melpdy's *soothing* voice almost every single time I launch the game.

There's still going to be a lot of places sub-50s shouldn't go, but one wasteland should help a lot
---
Thanks, I’ll keep an eye out for misc! Hopefully the new season will bring lots of high level players out so they’ll be easier to find.
---
I was reading the PTs feedback comments and I was it mentioned twice by two different peeps.

No different than any other days where all y’all do is cry.
---
Before Wastelanders I think.
---
Ooh.... That explains why I'm CONSTANTLY having to repair my 2 shot hunting rifle....
---
It's never too late to start, my friend. Even funnier when you glitch past a locked door and find a hidden collection of the ammo factories and change all of them to gamma rounds. I would like to know what they owners think when they return to camp.
---
That’d be a big improvement! Though it feels like it’d be tough to pick a balanced value when making a chunk of xp a daily (thinking of the new players). Ideally they could keep level ups for that one weekly challenge and come up with a fair xp goal for the daily, but I’m betting we’ll be back to the leveling grind come tomorrow
---
You need to obtain the plans from the Encryptid event. I can help you out with a standard if your on Xbox
---
Sneak was broken during meat week because of the prime cuts monsters
---
Stealth worked fine on the PTS, it's just inside the instanced Daily Ops where the enemies always know where you are
---
That being said, lvl100 monsters are *a lot* more perceptive than we're used to
---
Its gotten old because of the lack of content,  now it'll take longer to kill the bosses for the berserkers switchblade everyone loves,  let's be honest,  they could do better,  they want to improve something? How about the garbage loot tables, or the countles bugs that plague this game,  the nerf doesn't piss me off,  its that they spend their time doing this shit instead of fixing the damn game.
---
Yeah I’ve done the Bodyguards and Lone Wanderer as well and wondered if either were worth the points.  I mean if I was part of a team that went for ultimate synergy I’d certainly consider rocking a build to give that stuff specifically to get the team as optimized as possible but it feels like combat-wise S,P,A,L are the spots to maximize and the rest you just put whatever you can spare into so you can have some utility perks like lock picking, hacking, green thumb, etc.  It would be awesome if we could do load outs for crafting and other non-combats parts of the game.  It’s really too bad the game feels centered so strongly on combat as I feel like you have to have a combat build at some point or else end game isn’t going to be fun.  Sure they have some CHR and INT dialogue options and in a few places you can hack a robot or laser control to assist in the mission but it would be easier to just be combat.  I could be wrong here but that’s been my experience so far.
---
Ah a below average roll unfortunately. Nonetheless, I wouldn't be surprised if you get 20k+ by shoving it into your vendor a couple days
---
 
---
Then use proceeds and go shop :)
---
I just hope that melee isn't utterly useless
---
It’s time or money.  If you have hit your 1400 limit for the day and are that hard up for caps, you are choosing to sell them for less instead of just waiting for the next day.  You’re selling at a loss, it might be by choice, but it’s still at a loss. 
---
Of course, if people are buying them to turn around and sell them, they’re netting less money per day themselves, but people again do it because it’s faster than more efficient ways of making money (a camp with 10 industrial water purifiers can get hit max vendor caps in a couple of hours without any loss of money)
---
Indeed it does. Angry Turtle made several YouTube videos detailing the effects/how they work. Good news: They stack with existing Perks - so Fireproof and the Legendary variant stacks with the Dense armor mod will make you pretty much a stone when it comes to fire/explosive damage.
---
Interesting details.
---
It’s not the same....but effectively it is. You don’t get a 95% chance to get one, but you do get 3 different chances and can maybe get 3 in one roll. On *average* you should end up with a plan 95% of the time. Ish. I don’t feel like actually crunching the math.
---
Thanks for the link!
---
I understand why you’re selling them, but you are choosing to make less money.  That’s fine if for some reason you really want to rush caps (if you are desperately in need of.caps for whatever reason)
---
But you’re still selling at a loss.  Period.  You could have made 500 caps from a vendor. You are making less than that (Plus a vendor tax) because you aren’t willing to just wait another day.
---
Edit: and the bigger picture is, that 550 is still a fair price for the serums.  Sure, some people might want to sell for less, but 550 is the best price for a serum + money to cover the vendor tax.  That is a fair value for the serums. You could fairly bump it up a little more and make a profit.  People should not get mad when they see 500+ caps for price, since over 500 can still be fair.
---
:D
---
The 3 levels or 10 legendary weekly is pretty good.  I think 10 legos is super easy, but I'm in my second year of playing so I have secret honey holes to make sure i get mine.
---
It just get frustrating sometimes because I can clear whitesprings and west tek without even a danger warning, but can’t see the damage I cause on SBQ/ACP.
---
my question is, whats new meta?
---
I'll do you in the bottom while you're drinking sangria
---
I'm on iOS and in Australia. Double no for me.

Dude, that's not how statistics work though.

Here, use this bad boy, it will show the math.

Personally I am looking forward to it. I play the game for hours every day and it really gets old after a while.  I want something new!

Does he still ask you to pull his finger?

Why not create them? You can pick up enough materials by farming.

That's not the tang I was expecting.

Not yet anyways.

If you didn't grow up in the Cold War, they probably didn't have much cause to cover it.  But yup, the same thing also happened after the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs.

Been in game since launch.
---
My camp is just outside Watoga, regularly attacked by super mutants and scorched, with the occasional scorchbeast or fog crawlers. I guess I’m probably going to have to repair a lot of things.
---
Before the donation event began, you could. In fact, Dagurre’s first mission sent you there originally. It’ll be reopened when the BoS proper arrives.
---
Can you eleborate I don’t understand? You can’t use legendary perk cards if you are already full of regular perk cards? Not in addition to.
---
You may not, but the buff lasts for a short time. Still enough to be of help.
---
Learn something new every day. Thanks OP!
---
Yea the old grappling hook is pretty over used.  Plus pretty sure you would have to nail the terrain for it to function on.
---
Nerfed? No. They can, like all other guns, use follow through and far-flung fireworks (note: Do not use fireworks or other explode on deaths, they are buggy right now).
---
Though everything has reduced damage now.
---
Is she voiced by the same actress that DJs Appalachia radio?
---
I had this problem for the longest time, and it also kept having me put in the type-t fuse or whatever everytime I wwnt down there, I ended up just doing one day without installing the fuse for the hundredth time and it worked, so maybe give that a shot?
---
Yep, we do, only to piss you off / annoy / bother / trouble and otherwise upset dipshits like you.
---
Liquid courage...nice.
---
I still laugh when I get “Sweetwaters Special Blend” which is basically just a hot toddy.
---
Let’s say your STR is currently at 15.  Then you level the Legendary SPECIAL Strenght card To +5
---
You will have a 20 STR (and get the bonuses for 20 STR) but you are still capped at 15 for the number of perk cards you can assign to STR. It also says this right on the card.
---
It's up to Bethesda to put in the man power to do so. Which they won't, we know that.
---
What exactly that all means !? I don't understand you there !
---
You can use a Legendary S.P.E.C.I.A.L. perk card to add perk cards to a maxed S.P.E.C.I.A.L. but once passed 15 it will just not increase your total of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points like an Unyielding armor set does ? Is that what you mean ?
---
Serums make big money, but faster money can be made in other ways. When I am running really low (500 caps) I join Line in the Sand or Uranium Fever. Five to ten minutes, and you get to actually play the game. The materials you get can also be used to craft marine helmets, which sell well at vendors. 
---
I sell serums for 500.
---
Darn, bring that I searched all morning and this was posted 5 PM EST. unlike you, I have a fuckin job.
---
I totally dig Rose, if only she'd stop threatening me.
---
Wait whats happening? Does this mean it will be harder to kill enemies? I can barely handle how hard it is at level 45
---
We'll get 'em, it'll just take longer (The queen is back to being cripple-able)
---
I actually plan on popping off a couple Earl's and Queen's as soon as I can after the patch to ring in the new era 😁
---
Lol. You’re the one getting all angry and cursing.
---
Cause you know you got called out. Which means you’re also a liar! I mean look how upset you are! It’s hilarious! 
---
Lol
---
I agree, I want to show my allegiance! 😅
---
I did okay with a 50 Cal with Limb/Speed/Armor ignore
---
Of course, that's one of the perks of having a dad joke telling Grampa around.
---
1-2 shitting are you the guy that left fertilizer all over my camp?
---
Yes, they would be flagged and banned as they should be because that's still suspicious as fuck. Bethesda then goes through the evidence, sees that they were not using anything out of the ordinary, and indeed just found a way to stack so much bonuses they were godly, and they are unbanned/unsuspended, then Bethesda knows that there might be a balance issue with...whatever, bloodied, the bonuses, the colossus's health, whatever they could think of. 
---
I'm a firm believer of one thing, no matter how hard you try in this game, you should NEVER be able to one or two, or three, etc a boss. Period. Ever. That's fucking ridiculous. If you're allowed to do that, there needs to be a heavy drawback, like you taking 200% more damage, your limbs crippling much easier, you being more susceptible to stagger, the boss enraging and gaining more health and damage if you damage it THAT fast, something. Less then one second? That's utterly ridiculous, and honestly I think Betheda should immediately check those vids and blatantly nerf anything they did. Make shit not stackable, reduce th effects, something.
---
What those players did is impressive, but ultimately unhealthy for the game. Even ONE PLAYER being able to do that to a boss, fucks it up for upwards of 23 other players at a time, then they server hop and do it again on another day.
---
where can i read about the changes? I cant seem to find any info/numbers.
---
Then I would recommend two handed sneak melee build using either anti armor or instigating weapons. This will allow you to maintain damage while higher health and when PA is needed. Sneak bonuses will allow you to make up the damage on other players who run with lower health.
---
[This would be my personal build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4845c8&amp;d=s42ss2sm2sn2sg2a72aj2ar2a12l71lt2lu2i44c62ce0ej4pe2er2p00), but you can tweak it to suit your needs. Incisor(strength) is a strong melee perk, but if you run an anti armor weapon it is not necessary. This focuses a lot on sneaking to get the same damage output as other bloodied melee builds, if you are okay with doing substantially less damage you can move those points elsewhere and just face tank the damage.
---
If you want to go more tank focused I would pick up more endurance perks like adamantium skeleton and life giver to make you more tanky and not suffer as much from enemies cripple effects.
---
For mutation I would suggest marsupial, healing factor, speed demon, scaly skin, grounded, twisted muscles, herd mentality, and carnivore. These all have must haves for melee builds and can be supplemented with electrically charged and unstable isotope if that fits your play style. For your build carnivore is probably a must. Melee bonuses from cooked meats are too good to pass up.
---
For armor I would look for Vanguard sets with sentinel(less damage while standing still), harder to detect while sneaking if you are going the sneak route, and most importantly +1 strength. Every point of strength is going to count for high health builds, armor is a good way to get permanent boost to your strength points.
---
It would have to be a reaaally expensive perk card tho...
---
Oddly enough, despite my obvious misspelling, yes, I do tend to leave large quantities of fertilizer on people's front porches! 😂
---
I don't know exactly what it was, but I just can't stand her. I was so put off by her I had a hard time doing her quests and was so happy when I could finally get what I originally came for and move on. Is there a way to bypass her quest on an alt so I don't have to put up with her again?
---
You know what's required to craft serums, right? Ultracite and flux are the primary ingredients, and those materials are not cheap to acquire.
---
You have to server hop or complete on a private server.  It may take a few or several hops but you can get it done.  Dont worry about getting the sample back. I have counseled about 20 people on this problem and they all have been able to complele it this way if they try.
---
My wife used to get pissed at me because I played the game more than she did, so I’d be level 70-something and she’s level 30-something and getting wrecked by level 60-something super mutants or some such because they all scaled to my level. Now she’s 120 and I’m 369 and it’s not really an issue anymore lol
---
you can if you pick up 256 items, the game stores that many of the last picked up items and doesn't respawn them, once those nodes are off the list they will respawn.  They fall off the list around 2 days or so , haven't figured out the exact amount of time yet (or it just could be I"ve picked up 256 things by then)
---
OMG ME. I hate Rose so much. She's like what a 12 year old would come up with as an edgy-raider bot. NO.
---
As a great fan of the Power Armors in the game, allow me to enlight you, fellow vault dweller.
---
From worst to best:
---
Raider Power Armor=&gt;T-45=&gt;T-51=&gt;T-60=&gt;X-01=&gt;Ultracite Power Armor=&gt;T-65
---
I hope this helps you on your quest for a better Power Armor. Have a good day, friend.
---
Just wait till the update drops.  scrap all the perks you 100% know you don't need now or ever, leaving all the perks that you might occasionally use (crafting, qol, etc). 
---
Then just buy a card with 5 ranks that you don't need, rank to 5, scrap it, rinse repeat until you have all the perk coins.  
---
It's a royal pain in the ass, sucks in every possible way, and is a terrible system.  Enjoy!
---
Yeah, there's several things that don't add up about this story.
---
I knew it was you. Try to keep it on the crops next time.😋
---
Yeah! And make the boss drop 3* rolling pins cuz that’s about the quality of rewards in ACP! (Sarcasm)
---
Surrender Dorothy
---
It’s not selling for a loss. It’s just not max profit. 
---
Selling for a loss means you sell for less than it cost to craft. 
---
And maximizing profit per unit is a bad strategy for any business. You want to hit the point of maximum profit which includes lowering the cost to raise units sold thus increasing total profit. 
---
Basically you’re advocating for Sony to sell the PS5 for $2000 a system because like 4 people would buy it. But hey, that’s a ton of profit per system.
---
you are looking for a server where someone hasnt completed it since the data reset.  It may be fixes with tomorrow though.  I would hope it is a priority.
---
Can we not do another nuke started thing?  Like someone over in austin can start a end game experience without a 10-30 min slog thru a lag silo.
---
Sorry, it's my first day 😉   
---
u/aurick_411 just explained it much better than I did:
---
"Let’s say your STR is currently at 15. Then you level the Legendary SPECIAL Strenght card To +5
---
You will have a 20 STR (and get the bonuses for 20 STR) but you are still capped at 15 for the number of perk cards you can assign to STR. It also says this right on the card."
---
I feel bad for the megasloth. Every time I see one there are dead baby sloths near by. Ever see a living baby sloth? No, they are all dead and momma is *pissed*!
---
Oh, you need to hit the icons in between the buttons.
---
Cursing = lying ? Great to know cultists aren’t just in Appalachia ya fuckin mook.
---
legendary perks, 1 wasteland update (enemies scale to your level), daily ops (repeatable dungeons geared towards higher lvl/better geared players), and a major change to the way damage is calculated that will result in an overall nerf to players damage output.  how severe the nerf is depends on your build but in my testing on the pts my ttk seems only very slightly worse.
---
It's a rather large update imo
---
1 minute to 5 hours, give or take.
---
It takes as long as it takes. There has never been a set time for how long these maintenances take. It can be anything from 1 hour to 4+ hours (with bigger more problematic content patches).
---
I list mine at 640, which is a 15% profit over what I could sell to a vendor and enough to cover the vendor tax.  At that price, only players who really want/need the serum will buy it.  And I’m fine with that. .  
---
I max out vendors with purified water and other crap I find.  Earn extra caps from events (such as you) when I’m doing whatever.  If I don’t feel like playing for an extended period of time in a day and don’t have a stash of purified water, i can pull some serums off and max caps quickly.  
---
In the end, I have not sold anything at a loss.
---
We’ve been trained to rebuild the post-apocalyptic wasteland of America. We can build fusion reactors and machine high performance weaponry. 
---
And we can’t run a screw off on a lathe to save our lives. 
---
Also we didn’t know how to boil water.
---
Oh ok thanks, you confused me for a couple of minutes there lol. 
---
So basically it is just a stat buff like food, drug and the Unyielding legendary effect. 👍
---
You both share the same hate for her, so why is the friend a psychopath?
---
Thanks. I think I get it now
---
That's 130 days
---
magic 8-ball says......."very doubtful"
---
Thanks, i just recently started playing when the game came to gamepass
---
Wait, if my strength is only 10 and I use +5 STR, does that mean I can assign new additional regular perk cards to my strength stat?
---
Rifles have good single-shot damage, but their sustained damage per second is dogshit compared to heavy guns and automatic rifles. For boss fights, you'll want heavy or commando weapons, anything else will just be dragging everyone else down.
---
I cant believe so many are actually excited to grind more bullets just to do the same stuff and get the same trash loot 🤷‍♂️
---
Weapons with explosive area damage make cloaked assaultrons an easy kill.
---
Keep reporting it. At least you conscience is clear &amp; if Bethesda ever does anything, they're on the list.
---
Did somebody say gamma rounds?
---
Yea that's sucks. I was IOS and then my iPhone broke so due to that and knowing xcloud was in the future I decided to get an Samsung galaxy S10 and will never look back. Apple doesn't care about its customers.
---
But you can always move the excess perk points to another benefical special. Meaning if you have STR 15, and you rank up legendary STR perk card to max rank (+5), you can move those excess 5 points from those original 15 points you already have in your build to another special using levups.
---
This is basically how I feel. I'm excited because something different is happening during a time where I can barely go outside without restrictions, but I know that that excitement will fade within a week because, ultimately, we've done everything there is to do. The random limits on everything, the fact the weapons I think are fun are horrible to use, and the grind just aren't fun anymore.
---
Her voice always reminds me of Amethyst from steven universe.
---
I wouldn’t mind but I explained how it works and then broke it down for you.
---
Wasn't there an atom store sign that said "the most trusted camp in the wasteland' or something like that?
---
That might put people at ease...
---
I’m fine with playing support by making the boss take more damage from everyone else.
---
My hope is that someday, this game won’t be all about dps.
---
please give us the option to murder her
---
Oh honey, no..just no.
---
Is there any sign of the aforementioned "Steel Dawn" questline or will that probably just end up being a weekly quest or something?
---
I had insult bot pull the ghouls I hadn’t killed at Camp Venture. Came over to insult me, and then a bunch of ghouls all jumped me at once. Wasn’t very good for me.
---
also, one more thing. assuming turtle's testing is accurate, the only way TSE+DE is dealing that much damage is if the developers F'd up and demolition expert is applying to the two shots as well. I can see that happening considering they had to overhaul multiplicative effects, like portions of the TS mod. wouldn't surprise me if the interaction with E (and demolition expert by extension) went over their heads. happened in the past with legacies, plus explosive is hell to code. it was back in Fo4, too.
---
I guess TSE out damaging BE checks out, because of the new formula. the double explosion might be enough to give it a small edge over BE. depends on the weapon, really. and the damage reduction from bosses reducing the explosion to ~0 means B is still better than TS, probably. not to mention the accuracy and durability penalties. but when it comes to TSE+DE, it's clearly not the splash damage that's broken. because even when buffed by demo, it's not powerful enough to cause that gap between TSE+DE and everything else. no, that gap looks more like the ballistic portion is being buffed by an extra 60%.
---
The succulents is part of a bundle (maybe sold separately?) in the atom store dude.
---
Seems to appear fairly regularly these days.
---
Walk to the left side of it instead of over the dirt pile
---
I tried to do this the other day and when I placed the module down, my camp deleted. Because it's part of a preexisting structure, it cant be replaced with blueprints. Spend the last 2 days rebuilding my camp.
---
Yeah rifleman is sadly not too viable for queen fights, but if you have a heavy hitting rifle you will at least contribute in a large group. 
---
I have a Berserker rifleman character and haven’t ever tried any big boss fights with him. Mainly because if I get into power armor I’ll lose my broken armor that I have on, but also because I know I won’t be able to help too much anyways.
---
No, it really isn’t. If you don’t want to PvP, stay away from workshops. It’s one challenge nobody is forcing anyone to do. It doesn’t even turn up that often for me.
---
Does fire proof mitigate that?
---
They're shoved in a bundle now? I remember getting them as a seperate item for some dirt cheap price.
---
It’s dropping today, isn’t it? Has it dropped yet? Have you got legendary perks yet?
---
Thats what I used until I found a JE Gatling gun now I've traded a couple tse Gatling guns for powerful junkies weapons. One way or another the TSE Gatling gun has done more for me than any of weapons. I literally traded my first one along with 2 other guns for a Junkies Explosive 90% weight reduction Gatling plasma. Its a badass work of art
---
Just put this soothing tune on in the background.

You live and learn :)
---
Most recently he told me he heard I was late leaving the vault; and it was a pity I hadn’t been late entering it.  Ouch.
---
Well, the exploiters were smart they would do private groups with friends or just randos for trade and drop them in people's camp.  It is one of those you just have to fix the problem and not punish since it is so damn common.   
---
If it was early on when it was first found out (again not like it is the first time) then maybe bans or week long suspension would be reasonable. Overall with the new perk coming out and it being multiplicative off ammosmith ammo will be a joke anyways, kind was to begin with.
---
Currently working on an alt and want to do this. What wall do you have to glitch through?
---
I think we are all in agreement that the untarnished coffee pot is a very desirable item at 25 caps.
---
Even more reasons to wait it out :) thx for info.
---
This is why ppl been wanting the Chinese officer sword. I get it now. I kept wondering why ppl were trading for it lol
---
That's not what most people mean when referring to magic weapons.
---
Here are some numbers from what I had
---
Bloodied Pipe Revolver: Current damage 558  After nerf 244.  RoF 6 
---
Furious 10mm SMG: Current damage 104.  After nerf 98.  RoF 91
---
Two Shot Gamma Gun: Current damage 347.  After nerf 249.  RoF 91
---
So yeah, it really sucks for Rifleman builds.  We will be using a hell of a lot more ammo.  If you have a Fixer or Handmade I would suggest modding them to be able to use Commando perks.
---
I guess I could really sit down and figure out how much caps is end up spent getting the materials to make the serums (ammo, materials for repair, etc) to REALLY determine if it’s selling for a loss or not, but fine let’s say “not maximizing profits”.  
---
The difference between us and actual businesses is we aren’t going to go out of business by maximizing profits, and given the cap limit, we really don’t have any incentive to sell more, faster.  We have no rent.  We have no salaries to pay.  Maybe we have an R&amp;D expense to buy the plans the first time, but in the end I could take the rest of this game‘s life to sell the item and the only cost was the weight in my stash box.  
---
But the bigger issue, and more probably to the point of the OP’s post, is that over 500 caps cans till be a fair price for a serum.  if people \*want\* to sell them for less, great, but higher is still fair.
---
I sell them for 300 even... Between Earle and SBQ I get enough Flux to craft more.
---
I'll always buy out vendors they have em listed for 200
---
If someone is there for plans and event completion, and you show up to PVP them, and they express disinterest, and you *keep doing it*, you're doing it to be a prick and it's griefing. Just stop fucking with people who are minding their own business. It literally is not hard to do.
---
Yup, 5 more 😁
---
Wastelanders took a while. I don’t remember exactly but it was hours, 3-4ish.
---
What's the ammo perk card coming do ?
---
Huh? All you do is go into camp build mode and the select the camp unit (E button on PC). The camp then folds up and you can drag it anywhere withing the build radius and place it back down. Its movable just like any other object.
---
You do not place down your camp in the same place using the pip boy menu.
---
Sure but I’m a right side of the threshold kinda guy.
---
Oh, now I understand... I don’t go after someone if they tell me to stop unless I want that workshop for myself.
---
It’s a stat buff if you are using it over 15. 
---
* Scenario 1: You have a STR of 15 and have Strength +5 from the perk. You end up with 20 STR and 15 points of STR perks.
---
* Scneario 2: You have a STR of 10 and have Strength +5 from the perk. You end up with 15 STR and 15 points of STR perks. 
---
So long story short, the perks will let you allocate perk cards up to the limit of 15, but you can still benefit from other bonuses over 15. (So for example, the +5 STR in scenario 1 still gives you extra Melee damage)
---
But you could just put jt in a slot keep it level 1 and if later it changes its like half a level up to change to something else. Kinda like a slot bank until you have more points
---
Yes the best to do is move 5 SPECIAL to 10 you can end up with a 15/15/15/15/15/8/3 in whatever order you want.
---
And forever reason doesnt include energy turrets.
---
If your build is absolutely centered around the re railway then don't do it otherwise make the trade and then use the cry to get the gun you really want
---
Someone posted on another thread that come the update their camps won't place and they will have to rebuild. I guess we will all find out tomorrow if that holds water.
---
I've repaired my excavator a few times, but that's cause I tank earl, SBQ, imposter in it.
---
You never actually own a Gauss minigun. You own a Gauss minigun shaped hole that you constantly dump crimson flux into.
---
Mole Rats and Bloody builds. Expect some epic rants to come.
---
base +80%(ammosmith) x 150% (legendary perk max rank) so say you are crafting 5mm you would get 450 rounds.
---
Same my main build since beta/preorder is crap and just now im specing in it. My melee is actually built decently so I play my second character more. Its definitely more fun to be optimized but like you I dont give a shit about min max godmode. Hopefully the patch makes things more balanced eventually and not harder for everyone
---
New character then enemies scale to your level then just run through it
---
Jeez man calm down. Just spitballin here. No need to get worked up.
---
Kinda ultracite will become cheaper but normal ammo cant go lower then what it is already in vendors. The value that will crash will be ultracite fusion and plasma cores.
---
I’m referring to magic weapons with the range mod on top which makes them really viable for everything
---
Look at the real world economy. Remember hearing boomers talk about how little things like gas, groceries, etc used to cost? Well we'd get exactly that in the game but way quicker than the real world. It's not like things would be any different in a video game.
---
Do you keep it on your character at all times? If not its just a quality of life perk.
---
lol. Not for long
---
True, it's a fairly small problem. I just feel the legendary perk system is costly and unforgiving of mistakes. The idea of clicking the wrong thing and wasting level ups makes my tummy hurt
---
issue is you can't mod the melee as it breaks the speed and damage.  knuckles suck btw gotten a few and they are just so lame still even being glitched.  
---
I've known about this bug for quite a long while since I move camps so often and always forget the collectron, that is why I have think it is funny they keep saying you have to scrap the collectron all you have to do is store it.
---
I mean what did you think they prayed to?
---
$100 says there will be at least 5 posts about food &amp; water drain seeming faster than before, happens every patch
---
Oh holy mothman.
---
[https://imgur.com/iO0MqDq](https://imgur.com/iO0MqDq)
---
That's me stepping on that poor bald man up front in the OP pic.
---
It’s my theory that not even duped lasers will cut through all the shit a PvPer will do to mitigate and avoid damage... I personally suffer around about a 70% or so damage loss because of my build. It’s a lot harder to kill people with my laser when I realise I forgot to take my Grounded Serum (-50% energy damage dealt) and impossible to kill people in ass/sent or properly done power armor builds. The only real way forward is Formula P stacking with an explosive gat plas.
---
I've managed to get a few good ones, i find the most luck comes with spamming pictures and hoping one comes out clear
---
So my bloodied build will be poop basically?  Or just less crazy?
---
The problem is that then most maps would be covered in a fucking rad storm for a large majority of our playtime.
---
Right now normal high level enemies are dropping to a single shot from for example a 50cal though, they're the exact opposite of bullet sponges.
---
Sbq and earle are a seperate issue however, they should just reduce their insane damage reduction, first magic weapons would have to be fixed ofc,  but I think the change to damage as a whole is a very necessary and good step.
---
There's a whole world of builds opening up for us 😁
---
The special events always run until noon est on the day they say it's over. I've made that mistake before..
---
Ends on 12 pm est of that day.
---
Can confirm it doesn't work anymore. Its a bitch when youre trying to actually get pictures
---
Well now I wanna know what it is.
---
You need to look it up on YouTube it’s the best way to understand it.
---
Yep. Did it that way countless times with no issue. 2 days ago when I did it, it wiped my camp. Didn't use pipboy menu. Did it through build mode. Placed it down and poof... my camp was a fart in the wind.
---
All good now tho... the way I rebuilt it is better than it was before.
---
It has no weapons. They were removed. Bessies purpose was to transport the building supplies over so Duchess could build the Wayward. Shes basically the Wasteland equivalent of a semi. Theres some dialog either in the questline or maybe even random between the characters but its something to the effect of "Im glad Bessie doesnt have her weapons anymore..".
---
I'm PC
---
There are TWO requirements for it to be a magic weapon. 
---
First, The fire rate HAS to be 200 or higher. (I’m not sure if you can modify the rate of fire to be higher, and if it works or not)
---
And secondly, the first legendary effect HAS to be instigating, junkies,medics, or stalker. 
---
If for whatever reason you don’t have that legendary effect, then the SECOND legendary effect has to be 33% vats hit chance, 50% limb damage or bashing damage. 
---
You don’t need to have both legendary effects, just one of them is fine. However the fire rate is a must. Without that fire rate, the magic effect doesn’t seem to work. 
---
If you want better information, go to YouTube and search magic weapons by angry turtle. It’s a long video but very easy to follow. And it will answer all your questions.
---
definitely. make sure you swear at them as well
---
FYI: season finished. Another starts tomorrow
---
And I’m surprised that with this many patches it’s still a broken steaming buggy pile of shit I can’t stop playing for some reason.
---
I don't look down on the balance beam, I look forward, with a slight downward tilt.
---
I use the crosshairs to direct me, just air at the end of the beam, and you'll do a straight line from where you are to the end of the beam.
---
I'm probably a bit more experienced with platforming, did all the vistas and jumping puzzles in GW2's base game.
---
Yeah, my English sucks.
---
They'll be back up tomorrow when season 2 starts
---
Events like this start and end at 12 noon ET. You’re a bit late, friend.

Thanks bro ✌️

Turrets need ammo?
---
Yeah, I could get that thing one shotting almost anything in the game.
---
No, it ended at the correct time. You misunderstand how the game clock works.
---
No argument there, but it will be more plentiful.
---
101 GB patch incoming
---
This update is the literal Y2K of 76.
---
Eh, I don’t see it as a bad punishment tbh. You have to rebuild every single thing all over again? They probably have enough junk materials to do that.  
---
Wish they would think of something better. 
---
90% of the time I have to rebuild my camp anyways because it can never be placed down.
---
I saw some damage tests someone did and it's crazy how weak "armor penetration" legendaries are.  You'd think it would be better.
---
I'm sorry but if it's the 30% damage increase that's still kinda bad. +30% from an already drastically low number is literally a fraction of the buff it really needs.
---
End game for me is building an awesome camp. Then doing one last thing to make it better while juggling the camp budget. Then finding out something you did glitched a foundation and now that foundation cant be scrapped. You then spend the next month or so convincing yourself that that ugly floating foundation is livable with only to finally give in and replace your camp to delete it. Then your camp wont place back down as a blueprint and you start all over.
---
There are no daily or weekly challenges when there is no active season.
---
got to be in a team and not a public team
---
Even if the event was over, that grenade shouldn't have done damage unless PVP was initiated.
---
Or are grenades exempt from this?
---
Fuck Ive been holding off on finishing the main story. I guess now more than ever is a good time to finally finish it.
---
You can but it has to be a private team. Can't be a public team. I was building in my wife's camp a few hours ago.
---
Pfff like they’d ever risk loading you up with pretend dollars when there’s the possibility the charge might bounce?
---
Hmmm.  Google translate can’t seem to make sense of that mess of a post.
---
Im new to the game and got a level 45 big machine gun that shoots out 308.less vats, extra damage to low health enemies, and better vats accuracy. Every enemy I've pointed it at has died in less than a second, except for a behemoth that took half a clip, I ran out of bullets, and had to beat it down for ten minutes with any guns I could find lol.
---
I'm okay, I just have a bug up the butt about jetpack plans I guess haha. Your idea isn't even a bad one. It would be a fun thing to play around with.
---
I'd rather have the bugs fixed first
---
Not overly... but I do see it as a missed opportunity kick off raiding quests when tuning into her radio... kinda the the anti-preston if you will... I have another settlement that needs your raiding 🤣
---
If someone builds a whole farm of these on a public workshop and leaves them unlocked, they're trying doing the server a solid. It's kind of a lame move to change them all to gamma rounds.
---
Yes a storm is coming and a drop in player base will happen. Mind you the numbers are already bad. But a 74% damage nerf is game breaking for unarmed players. Boarderlands did a nerf also in the past few months massive drop in players and content creators stopped playing. So this is going to effect a minority of players rather bad. Not so much the power amour heavy gunners. As there going to stand back and shot away. But a bloodied unarmed challenge build is going to suffer a great deal. As you can’t hit as hard the mobs can hit harder. And there is only 1 unarmed perk card to the 3 for most other weapon types. So balance. No
---
I’ll take you up on that... :D
---
Turns out, the real NPCs were the friends we made along the way.
---
Jetpacks are great for ghoul mobs, check it out.
---
Grappling hooks are cool too.
---
Who ate all the damn sweet rolls?!!
---
I have a laptop so I can play it on the go anyway
---
How do I make a private team. I got to there name on the list but just gives me the option to add as friend, mute, block, and report player.
---
wait. cant you just server hop?
---
The cores are absolutely crazy where you could get over 9 from 2 normal almost empty ones.
---
Hahahaha absolutely
---
We should be able to make anything if we can make a fusion reactor, but then balance.
---
Being able to make a hat that feeds us food and water to avoid the pointless food and water meter would be useful too.
---
Even more than the voice of that DJ they added
---
Not over early. Ended as scheduled, 12 pm est Sept 10 till 12 pm est Sept 14th. Imo, it should have been longer considering how many mats had to be donated to get the event.
---
Wait what?
---
Oh sorry maybe I didn’t explain it well. I didn’t mean “your camp can’t be placed down, try a new world?”
---
I meant like, if I want to move locations, I can’t ever place down the building I already finished. I have to start fresh because “object is floating”.
---
Saving all my junk for this lol
---
I leave Hacker at lvl 1, and lockpick at 3. Its annoying needing to decline the perk/stat swap every time I want to change cards around. But in the future, it may mean I get to scrap/skip those 6 cards on existing/new characters.
---
Get the ammo legendary perk.
---
The changes mean there's a lot more variety in most aspects of the game though. Yes across the board damage is nerfed, but way more of the legendary effects are actually competetive, you can go to all locations in the game and still get relevant exp and legendaries, same goes for events, and legendary perks open up way more options for your build.
---
I'm very excited for the patch, while it doesn't directly add a lot of new stuff to the game, it gives us a reason to use and experience so much of the stuff that's already in the game, but we're forced to ignore atm.
---
Retail vs wholesale vendors
---
Now with 3x the lag and latency
---
Who said anything about the machine being unlocked? You can lock the factory but leave the terminal unlocked.
---
Uses the same ammo as the Blade of Bastet, just keep on the lookout for sword ammo.
---
Season ended last Tuesday. New starts tomorrow. That's why there haven't been any daily or weekly challenges.
---
I remember back when you just *did not* log out while in Whitesprings area unless you wanted a 75% chance of spawning into a nuke zone, or sometimes into an incoming nuke. Good times.
---
Definitely weird how this game always does stuff at noon. I started to wonder if this game is made in Australia or something.
---
Almost always 12pm-12pm EST
---
neither of you should be in a team of any kind. Then you should be able to invite
---
Yea in that regard it is easy to funk it up. As there is not gonna be a proper reset/respec system that includes legendary perks. Which by itself is very odd for a game like this.
---
Lacks mobility? Eh...unless you’re a low level, not really. Marsupial helps you get around for most of the things in the game. If you have a jet pack (even a basic level 25 power armor with a jet pack will help you access different areas.  
---
And obviously if you completed wastelanders you most likely have your SS jet pack by now. 
---
The grappling hook kind of sounds like a good idea, but then again I don’t see any situation where I could tell myself “gee I wish I could grapple up there somehow” 
---
And grapple a scorchebeast down? I know it’s a video game and there’s way too many unrealistic things in the game. But I doubt you can grapple down a scorchebeast down. I could see that happening MAYBE with a harpoon gun, but the realistic side of me says that the flying beast will most likely just drag us along in the air 🤣
---
Perk Loudouts aren't coming with the patch tomorrow.
---
Woo shit... I haven't followed anything to do with legendary perks so I am completely clueless
---
Same here and specifically bought this new iPhone to play games on given I had an 6splus before I shoulda went with the asus rog phone like I wanted to
---
I can't wait to play my favorite game at *a* fps
---
PM'd ya where as to avoid violating subreddit rules.
---
I do that a lot to goof around. 10/10 they do it back.
---
I’ve been using my Berserker rifleman build again lately. Guess we’ll see how it fares tomorrow!
---
I hear you, but man I remember when I first played and I got to the Top of the World and it was surrounded by Lvl68 Super Mutants. The fight lasted like 20 minutes but I kicked their dicks in with a hunting rifle and grenades.. that was such a fun fight.
---
If you plan on using ammo factory, do it at workshops so you dont compromise your camp. Fyi, players can get through any locked door using photo mode and any door or wall with power armor. Locked doors at camps are nothing to those who know how to step through them.
---
Ok ok interesting ! So if i have only 2 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points allocated in Perception, i can use a Legendary S.P.E.C.I.A.L perk card to allow me to add a couple more perk cards. Really cool, thank you very much for the precision ! 👌
---
They are already readily available in game.  If you make them even easier to acquire, there is less reason to play the game.  There is nothing wrong with needing to earn things in game, as long as it's not too difficult.  If you're looking for a short cut, buy them in bulk at railroads.
---
People create their own content, still remember the vendor that had Dirty water for 30caps...Yum Gamergirl bathwater
---
Fed76 doesn't even give price recommendations for plans.
---
But I agree, their price estimates are massively inflated.
---
That’s what I’m thinking
---
Yeah but maybe my charge would be less likely to bounce if they didn't bill me early every other month
---
I too am excited about having enemies that I can't just one shot. I've been running around a lot lately with weapons I'm not spec'd for just to get some of that "I could die doing this" feeling again. Although I do still enjoy single tapping from time to time.
---
A weapon has to have 200 fire rate (or close server lag effects it).  Two shot doubles the effective fire rate.  Explosive also doubles the fire rate , but not vs queen or earl (immunity).  Also you have to have one of the following effects , 15% block on an armor piece or instigating or stalkers or junkies or 50 limb damage or 33 vats hit or 40 bashing damage. Any of these 7 effects will make a shotgun magic in vats only. Or any guns with 200 fire rate magic.
---
The easiest way is to have a 15% block armor piece and craft a minigun with accelerated barrel,  instant magic weapon for you
---
Downtime is almost always 3 hours+ I cant remember if ever it was less than 3.
---
I loaded in as soon as a nuke was dropping and it destroyed my camp. It was literally perfect timing.
---
Well the perk description is really off then, because it reads like later sneak attacks are boosted, not that you get a boost after one hit regardless of whether the second shot is also a sneak.
---
Legend says he's still copy and pasting what he says into Google translate and changing the language so he looks smart.
---
That would be me and my alt, I two box with a 15 charisma pack mule sharing adrenaline for whoever is lucky enough to team up with me, also means my main always has adrenaline.  Two boxing has massive perks in this game.
---
Same alt is 4 starring ammo factor tomorrow too :)
---
Think of it like tenderizer - after the first attack, all subsequent attacks are boosted.
---
Then it will get to be the mobile game it clearly wants to be
---
I'm down. (398)
---
I think server options would add serious longevity to the game.
---
I also heard that the ammo extractors will take a permanent part of camp budget even when camp is moved. So if you have them in your camp it’s best to keep it in place so the budget don’t go to waste
---
That's what I had hoped.
---
I need to show YOU some music
---
Also weird how it's been that way from day 1 and people still haven't caught on
---
PSN is Neockwon
---
Gotcha, so in the case of a Gatling laser with 182 fire rate I would need TW or Explosive with one of those 7 effects to make it magic?
---
No reason either way.
---
But if you have perk card packs (those that you get every 5 levels), you want to save them until servers come back up after patching. Because right now on live, if you open the card packs there is a chance that you will get duplicate cards which will be automatically deleted (there are set of rules and reasons for this but no point writing them here now). After the patch that is no longer possible, meaning you have a chance to get more perk cards/coins from them.
---
I cannot stand it and would've completely avoided that entire quest line if possible.
---
[here you are. not so soothing ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6NJKFyqAy5g4YciLirrtlQ?si=q3Z39xXYSai_6gJ1AIclpQ)
---
That's an idea! the game needs rad tornadoes
---
Usually some times 182 is close enough. Faster fire rate would work too.
---
I am watching YT. And not playing anymore tonight. 
---
Good luck to everyone.
---
Same my man! Dad of 5 daughters 4,6,9,12,14. It’s rough man but it’s such a great game! On Xbox also GT SGTSAPPER88 Army Vet and agree it sucks being low lvl I’m 65 and with out this game the demons would win man! Such a great community!!!
---
What? Is that a part of the new update? I use PS remote play occasionally but it sounds like you're suggesting something different.
---
Ideally and this is just my thought process is since you get six slots once 300 it is best to move your points to 10 of 5 special and the other two use the few spare points as needed use the 6th perk card to add 5 for more QoL. From there I will focus on the ammo and maybe infiltrator and hot swap as needed provided I have the perk coins to hot swap.    
---
Honestly the other perks are meh to me the chem one seems kind interesting at least. but everything is just meh.    
---
Really what is legendary is the 5 perk points so you can have 30 total opening up so much and allowing for true dual builds and functioning gimmick builds. at 50 you have a total of 56 perk points if you are level 300 you still only have 56 perk points(7 base 49 from levels) so you have just effectively become a level 80.
---
You’re the one all full of anger my dude. 
---
But yeah. You lied. You never did a search. We know people lie about it because they think it’s easier to ask and have someone give them than answer.
---
Fun fact. Honest people don’t get all buttsore like you’ve gotten. They just walk away. People that lie, they do what you’re doing. 
---
Getting all aggressive and insulting cause they want to get ride of their accusers. 
---
Cultists. That’s hilarious! I love how stupid that is.
---
Hmm ok. Do you know if there would be anyone that would want something like this? Plasma weapons aren’t really my specialty but don’t want to scrip if someone could get use out of it
---
the deathclaw mask looks real good they should add the body suit. They should add super mutant and goul skins and mask
---
I do some daylies, shop, run the events I enjoy, and on weekends I do nooks and grind rare outfits.
---
The storms would have to move, and could be no larger than the nuke zone. It wouldn't be necessary that the storm lasted as long as the nuke zone.
---
Wait even if you switch targets? So it’s adrenaline but with a single stealth kill to start?
---

It’ll be fixed tomorrow allegedly
---
Assumed it was part of the fear mechanic
---
I've been getting worried with all these posts coming up. Supposed to get my monthly Atoms on the 17th or 18th. Hope they come through!
---
I think you should spend time reading before posting
---
I've paid for no more than 450 for one.    
---
A player dropped 4 on my 2nd char last night during "Feed the People". I'm only using two b/c the other two aren't ones I like. If you're patient you can find similar prices. If you're not you'll give in and likely pay too much.
---
Yeah the back door has a big square vault door too though.
---
There's a third smaller square vault door behind the wallpaper in that one wing of the resort too.
---
I guess they just stuck that big vault door in the main entrance for the sake of making it look like a fallout style vault.
---
honesty this sub is now an absolute shithole between what you just described, and the constant candyland circlejerks that dominate everyday. kind of like this one..🤔
---
Lol everyone is going to be huddled around the safe zones now
---
bj's tho she's the wagers of the lazrg sea?
---
Fear mechanic. Aim down sights to make it stop, or keep going until the the clip is empty
---
I personal can’t wait for this perk card. Ammo has always been easy to make being I never made any guns prime. But with this new card you will get a crap ton and enemies will also drop ammo you use now. So I would def think this glitch will soon be a waste of camp space and time
---
Don’t forget ur weapons will be worse too. It might even out.
---
It applies to the single enemy.
---
If I shot Earle from sneak, it applies the debuff. Shoot him again from sneak, the duration is reset.
---
Shoot a different enemy, it... probably moves? I’m not 100% sure.
---
I’m also fairly certain it doesn’t apply to explosive heavy guns.
---
Hold this L, but here’s a tip for when you spend your scrip- feel out the RNG seed by buying a 1 or 2star- if you like the effect or weapon Theres a higher chance you’ll get another weapon with the same effect or the same weapon with a different effect. Each random chance “seed” has only a couple of the weapons and a couple of the effects at a time. If you don’t like the seed, hop servers for a new one
---
Type in fallout 76 magic weapons on YouTube and watch angry turtles video on it. It’s in depth and will answer any questions you may have. Everyones advice here is somewhat accurate (including mine lol) .200 ffr is not required but makes it easier. You need only one of the magic effects and it can be on armor as well, not just the weapon. An example of a magic weapon that doesn’t have 200 ffr is my 50L pump shotgun. Destroys everything. With that said the 200 ffr is useful in boss fights. That’s when I break out the Junkies FFR Gatling Laser.
---
I could use some more legendary modules, so any dupe that works on them would be most welcome.
---
Well explosive heavy guns are not renowned for their stealthiness
---
I had 2 people come into my camp tonight and call me a bunch of slurs because I had the pride flag as my icon. They made fun of my camp and said a lot of mean things.  I locked them in my camp. They picked the door. They got badly destroyed. ¯\(ツ)/¯
---
***Never*** play on patch day.
---
They aren’t, but the perk does say ranged sneak attacks, so it is possible.
---
Hey, I’ll be the first to admit it, I love a free ride. I’ll take it anytime, anywhere. But to, and I can’t believe I have to say this, ride accusers? That seems cruel. I can’t get down with that. So to recap -
---
I search for the time of the drop until 7:30 AM EST, when I go to work.
---
I get home around 9, make a post immediately (forgetting to search a second time) [blaSPheMy] {VeRboTEn} (“biggest mistake of your life”) - Football Player, Mr. Deeds (2002)
---
You take the ride on the hate train. 
---
Great conducting, sir. Truly. Unparalleled use of your speculative logic. Hope to see more!
---
I saw angry turtles video and made a comment asking why he said about saving perk card packs and he replied and since then I’ve been saving them. I have 80 level ups and about 20 some perk packs of more not really sure. Just ready for tomorrow
---
Have a few steps over the PTS and, oh well didn't really found this annoying or destroying the game.
---
Yes, some boss and high end enemies need more bullets to die but that not an issue i still one hit some trash mobs without any problems.
---
The only issue is the way where low lvl players have the same efficient as high lvl players, imo they just need to get ride of this lvl that shows up at the right of the enemy health bar (because it's really confusing, also we gonna need to take some time with the one wasteland update and find this ""normal"" i'm pretty sure we gonna see some peoples get upset because there is low lvl in ACP or any event, in fact that doesn't matter if he is lvl 5 or 375, if he know how to play that good !)
---
Currently the biggest challenge you can't get is the DailyOps imo, some scenario can be really hard but clearly not impossible event in solo and doing the run in elder (below 7min), i spent most time in it and I don't feel like the ""nerf"" have an big impact on it or on the ACP.
---
TL;DR
---
Don’t believe you.
---
All I said was a lot of people say they did a search when they didn’t.
---
And you lost your shit over it. Guuuuuuilty.
---
So whatever.
---
Thank you.  i found the pawn shop, and already had like most of the stuff.   it's kind of funny, i had 4 pieces of the map, and had filled all but the first of the clues.   so a quick trip to the capital and i got it, and finished the quest... and now can get to the front door of vault 79... ok.. kind of anti climactic quest.
---
ive been trashing legendary weapons and just randomly rolling at the rusty pick for different stuff, its mostly junk.  so thats what vault steel is for, i was wondering.    i also got the overseer quest finished.   only thing holding me up was the vault 76 tape i thought i was screwed because i didnt take it from the vault, but apparently teh bot at the vault entrance can also give it to you.
---
i want to get into vault 79...
---
"BLoOdY bUiLdS aRe GaRbAgE NoW" lol even tho it will still do the most damage than any other build it will become trash since it won't be OHK enemies now.
---
It’s the only way they could get people to finish the boring quests...
---
I hate raspy girl voices.
---
I think he just put out several videos about these new legendary cards you may want to check that out too.
---
Should be up around noon ET if all goes well. They'll have it back up no later than 3pm even if they run into lots of problems. Anything later than that is someone doing something stupid like interrupting a database restore. I've had that happen. Overly proactive infrastructure guy thought waiting for a restore would be a good time to rearrange cables.
---
No.
---
Asbestos provides drastically better fire protection than Fireproof does (oh man the irony).
---
Fireproof seems about the equivalent of a 50/50 mix of Dense torso and Asbestos Torso. Half the protection of each.
---
When I was using Fireproof alone I was getting killed only about half as quick as without it from the falling embers in Monongah mine. With Asbestos torso I could dance on the embers all day with no damage.
---
On the PTS... it’s been open to test for awhile now, but closed today.
---
Sameeee..
---
He did I’ve watched some I watch at work when I’m hiding or right before bed. Will watch last few tonight.
---
Stranglerheart wearers like this comment in solidarity

Is gatling plasma gonna get nerfed.
---
Let's all agree to say it seems the same to us

and it must just be them.

Count on not playing during your lunch
---
And in the meantime you could have sold 20 for $400 while waiting for the sucker to come along and buy it for $500.
---
Really? I'm 530ish champion points in ESO and I feel like I tear through enemies when questing with minimal effort. Public dungeons I find public dungeons fault easy alone and can solo most world bosses.
---
Is this like when Kanye argued that he was on time because it was 5:00:14sec pm?
---
Oh, you’ll get in eventually.
---
And if you chose one of the endings, the pawn shop is your only way to enter into the front room.
---
Any word from the PTS testers about buggy Legendary Perks? I already saw news that Legendary CHR points won't let you share perks, but Legendary END does increase health.
---
Last thing I want is to dump perk coins into Ammo Factory and find out it actually makes less or it disables Ammosmith or Super Duper.
---
Did anyone else notice that Beckett would complain about the robot squawking over the radio? I originally thought that Rose’s message every time you load was a bug but then realized that Beckett was complaining about it too...

I’m a Xbox alpha insider so I had xcloud streaming preview and just regular streaming for android and loved it. It’s laggy but it still neat. When I was using xcloud Preview on my galaxy fallout wasn’t on there but the regular streaming streamed games straight from my Xbox so it was neat. I switched to iPhone and I’m about to switch back to android because iPhone is pretty much shitty being only xcloud is on android, shit fortnite is only on android now. iPhone is just turning into shit.

Thank you. Her voice was too cartoony.

This month was first time I ever got my atoms the same day I was charged. I get charged on the 12th and usually it’s with in two days but this month it was same day.

I kinda like it but she talks so goddamn much
---
.o   ,
---
I have to watch him a couple times to really get the gist of it. 😂
---
My fav is when I'm using my bloodied combat knife to clear trash mobs, and I have to stab them 3 times in VATS with a 300dmg weapon to kill them cuz the first 2 stabs don't connect for some reason.
---
im impatient.  which is weird because im an explorer and not much of a quest doer .    i like digging around the wasteland and poking around and exploring allthe different corners.  so i have a big pile of quests to do.
---
Why even pay for it in the first place....
---
I'm just frustrated I didn't get to do a max bloodied/junkie build right. I dappled in the arts of it, but I found the limited bloodied build I made to be to squishy, and the junkie build too high maintenance. 
---
Glad I can keep my heavy gunner Power Armor build and still be badass though!
---
Great use of the lingo muchacho. Know that because I care so very deeply about this little chat of ours, I’ve gone ahead and ignored my husbandly duties of the night. They include -
---
- cleaning the workout room
---
- chugging a natty ice
---
- laying pipe
---
This is so my thoughts and energy could coincide with you and your ever-important sense of belonging. If I don’t support that I don’t see myself sleeping tonight. Or ever again. 
---
Christmas for me this year will come tomorrow morning when I wake to the gift of another message, another inkling of your words. You alone can make 2020 the best year of my life. Please. Don’t leave me out here, alone.
---
Dont oevrthink it man its just a fun suggestion
---
Yeah what I'm suspecting will happen, since I suspect they won't fit in normal camps at all otherwise, budget wise.
---
Ignore the fire rate 200, there is video of a fixer that has a fire rate of 98 being magic and it wasn't two shot or explosive killing Earl.   
---
Though latency does have a huge factor in if magic happens or not.For me if I am on a private server my 255 minigun (instigating ffr 90rw) always is magic, however on a normie it is not. My 142 penta gauss minigun is magic on normie servers more often but on private it is only sometimes. My UGLs that have FFR do magic more often than my FFR GLs.(green vs red maybe more particles in red screwing up lat for me?)   
---
One thing in all my testing I personally noticed is always hit the same spot the more focused you in one area with the damage overlapping the faster the magic kicks in.   
---
Magic damage has been around since Dec 10th patch in 18 when they first tried to fix rubber banding it caused mutant weapons to become magical then in March of 19 they patched it, couple month went by they fixed rubber banding again and boom magic again and this has just been a cycle. Typically it is 1-3 affixes that can be magic with this last one it was so so so many that the cat is out of the bag and everyone knows about it, instead of being in small circles.   
---
If you don't live in PA find an armor piece with +15% block it is the best to have as most any automatic then has a chance of being magic.   
---
So now you know the source of where it comes from, The current affixes for weapons was already mentioned below. Also don't get too used to it, it will be patched just like it has been many times before, then the hard rubber banding will be back and a new set of magic will be out when that is "fixed".
---
Maybe it's intended but just has a small window so it's difficult to pull off?
---
Omg shut up. Nobody cares about your excuses and reasons for lying.
---
So tomorrow is the shadowland's  pre patch? How  can I confirm this?
---
I get the impression some people here play this sub more than the actual game.
---
I completely agree with that. Lol I’m from America so understanding him sometimes is a little hard but I love his videos. I watch him, juice head, Captain noob, tyyr, sh games, and innosurvivalist. Def way better content now then it was back when the game first launched. Lol
---
But that would make this a nuclear...
---
Wait for it....
---
Winter
---
My first char is a Stealth Sniper. Level 119. I'm really good at this kind of build and character.    
---
I LOATHE Bloodied, Junkies, and other things that require my char to be gimped.    
---
I have all legendary gear and nothing god tier like most people want.    
---
A 2hd axe for low level mobs and to save ammo.    
---
A combat shotgun for mid level.    
---
A Dual Fixer lv 50.    
---
Combat Rifle 3 star Two Shot.    
---
A 3 Star Lever Gun with Explosive shot.    
---
I tend to sneak kill almost everything b/c  do the most damage that way.    
---
A sniper IRL or in-game fires slower, higher caliber rounds, and has to make each shot count. IMO, that means taking out a leg on most enemies, the weapon arm on any enemy with a weapon, and headshots for a lot of enemies.    
---
If you can get a Combat Rifle 3 Star that does almost 200 or more pershot with Quad, Anti-Armor, or Instigating that would be good. Not sure which effects are in what tier but you get the idea. I think the +50% limb or VATS Critical damage are also good. For the 3rd I would shoot for Faster Reload, less VATS cost, or the 250 DR while reloading.    
---
The odds of you getting exactly what you want are't too good.    
---
Avoid extra damage to a certain enemy type. I still haven't used or switched to a Prime receiver yet b/c it makes the weapon use Ultracite ammo.    
---
IMO, you don't want lots of heavy armor. You can mix/match if you want but I have effects on armor like:    
---
Reduced ammo weight.    
---
Reduced Food, Drink weight    
---
Reduced weapon weight.    
---
IMO, stuff like that is good for us. We want to be able to carry a lot of food, drink chems, etc. but also pick up junk we need without 3 pieces making us over-encumbered.    
---
If you can PM me a pic of that 3 Star Vampire I'll see what I can come up with. The Handmade can be made into a non-automatic rifle but it's going to be harder to make each shot count. That effect won't kick unless your health is quite low or you keep it that way.
---
With public teams now available, there is very little incentive to play solo.  Slap on three ranks of Inspirational and pick up Herd Mentality and Empath, and you’re way better off than using four charisma points for lone wanderer.  I’ll join a building team for the extra intelligence xp boost and hardly ever interact with another player unless I’m using their camp or location to fast travel to.  Otherwise, I feel like all your points are valid.
---
It’s weird for North Americans. It’s also not interesting enough to remember or even common enough to encounter.
---
Damn, I just reached level 36 and only got the Chinese stealth armor last week.  What should I expect?  I was finally starting to feel kind of important lol.  I'm still afraid of those 62 level ghouls though.
---
Lower tier.I tend to make those 1 or zero a times.If I have ammo for something I won't use maybe 3 max at higher tier. I don't keep a lot b/c I do use the ammo converter.    
---
I have 3 chars and the only one that has that uses .45 most of the time. I have a shotgun for backup and plenty of that.
---
Believe me, people have been posting about it
---
Yeah it started with a spring bundle iirc but was sold separately. You get quite a few of them too they're awesome.
---
What is overkill is the amount of 5mm used by the Chupacabra that mowed down that brahman in New Vegas.
---
Bessie needs weapons.....
---
#REFITBESSIE
---
I 100% agree with this. A pre war station like the Atomic Radio mod would also be amazing. :D
---
I’m game. PST available after 7pm
---
Lvl: 239
---
Psn: alphaboomer
---
i assumed there must have been, but i havent seen any so i just thought id give my 2¢
---
a mole miner hood that makes the grunt
---
They give daily quests that can reward nice legendaries (though like everything else, they're usually not).  Free scrip with a chance at something useful.
---
I believe they started as a spring bundle then got split. I'm not the most knowledgeable person. I know mine came with a bundle.... I think.....
---
Yeah I'd say so. They spice up the camp with a bit of company. Plus you can always swap them out or disable them when you don't want them around.
---
Sofia and beckett have decent storyline for their quests.  All of them give recurring dailies that give legendaries, scrip and the like.
---
Nuclear winter! Mic communicate and appreciate an opportunity at pvp on a relatively even ground
---
I thought I was clear but looking back I see I could have been better. I am going to bed, which means I can’t check this again for about 8 hours. That gives you plenty enough to craft some high grade retorts and perspectives for me to wake to. I’m just so giddy I can’t fall asleep so here I am calling out again. I feel like I’m on the titanic. Or on Everest.
---
Just some community event gathering supplies for the brotherhood who are en route to the area. That dlc is still coming later this year iirc
---
Got a 2 star Bloodied 25FFR Gatling Laser as a reward from an ally daily, so pretty happy with em
---
Rose talks like she can actually kill the player, pretty big talk for a Nanny bot.
---
*unlocks Ground Zero*
---
You only get "rare" event drops for finishing within the time limit once per day. You can run it repeatedly, but you will only get standard rewards after finishing once.
---
I have made so many pieces of solar armor trying to make a full set of assassins sentinel I have one lol like 4 unyielding two assassins those I keep for maybe a build change I just make them light and put them in the stash and I did the same thing with my strangler power armor I almost had a melt down the look of both of those armors is awesome I love climbing out of the strangler with full solar
---
Pretty much same here.  Lvl 135 though.  Got centennial and pay for Fo1st.  My SO loves it which is why I still play.  Worry that if it's more of a grind if I will be even less interested in playing...
---
Thank you  for the info
---
Everything is magic with that armor from what I understand.
---
You’ll see it in VATS.
---
So the brotherhood won't be here this season? 
---
I must've misinterpreted the roadmap because it made it seem as though we would see the brotherhood arrive in some form this season with an introductory questline and then a full blown brotherhood expansion later on. 
---
I guess I'll wait and see. Thank you for the info
---
I always sharpen my sword ammo at workbenches with Samurai perk to make em last longer
---
For the love of God, yes.
---
Yeah, with the armor that's double magic (not that having both will effect damage). I have my damage numbers showing, but I don't think it shows properly. But there is night and day in vats with or without the effect. I can tell right away when I forget to equip my armor (although mumbles just gave me a TS/33 combat shotty, so I'll swap out the armor now).
---
Every stash skin should have a counterpart scrapbox skin.
---
Tired of the garish blue vault tec shit. It's hard to have a rustic cabin with timber furniture with a jar of jelly babies bullshit blue and yellow scrap box.
---
I'm still waiting for the daily post on this topic.
---
If I have 1 charisma at baseline and get 2 more points with herd mentality...can I share a level 1 perk card?
---
Well, the assaultron vendor will destroy the turrets when that happens with that one.  Sucks.
---
Yesssss...dude, like I had none stop waves of 10-20 scorched at a time plus a constant spawn of SBs flying overhead non stop thru the whole event. It was absolutely chaos, and has happened to me on a couple occasions. It's absolutely a blast for me, because I am higher level and fully loaded always with extra ammo and stims when I do that event, just in case that happens.
---
It's loads of fucking fun.
---
They just started listing plans 
---
https://fed76.info/plans/
---
Legendary special perks do not increase your special or special slots beyond 15.  What they do I allow you to have more total across all specials.
---
#GANGSTALKING
---
That's a little late for me, sorry
---
After the nuke is sropped, the blast zone doesnt disperse and i cant get anywhere near the mine without dying from rads
---
On occasion, but not consistently
---
Understatement.  Its at least once a day.
---
I don\`t think that\`s a bug
---
Im in Pensacola and it took me a second to realize your title wasnt about the storm.
---
As a 100s+ lvl player I am very curious what this will do to the Colossal Wendigo Event.
---
I haven't played the pts but what i can say is that strength from perks and the stats from in game are two different things. The maximum is 15, however there's not really a limit on in game stats since i got around 27 with a full set of unyielding. If i remove my strength reducing mutations and go from 11 strength to 15 then i'll maybe get the same result of 38 or higher.
---
But, with that in mind you can still use buffs like food and bobbleheads to get above your 38 so there's not really a limit as long as you find ways to surpass the previous numbers and go higher. For the legendary perks however, from shared screenshots they showed how every card is upgradeable so i don't think you'll be unable to get 50 strength in game stats.
---
Totally agree, but they gotta pay for each new song.  That's why in the last major update we got the one-off songs that Bethesda made themselves. All the songs they gave in game they gotta pay for.
---
T-51 is better than both t60 and x01 resistance wise( and look's cooler imo) though it has the weakest rad resistance of all armors except raider
---
I sell for 350 each. Any lower and other players will buy out my vendor just to sell them in theirs. I'm not trying to maximize profit, just trying to make them cheap as possible and profit on the volume.
---
Duh
---
Hahha it was apart of the main questline right?
---
Does your weapon fire rate still have to be ~200 for “the magic” to work?
---
You get legendary Perk slots on level 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 &amp; 300
---
I want to complain about the nerv right now, without seeing the actual results!
---
Legendary perks. One is replacing hacker and lockpick perks.
---
The risk is low if you use couriers, who are respected traders. But finding enough high end items to get something that rare.... good luck
---
Cool, I was gonna scrip it, but remembered reading about it here.  So the armor piece will make any weapon magic, or does it need to be high fire rate, and limb damage for shotguns?  Trying to maximize ammo use for the coming damage nerfs.
---
I just want it to work like actual assaultrons. Just a constant beam; no charging the shot.
---
Alfredo.
---
So in my case it would be pointless to grab and upgrade that one, since I won’t be getting any benefits?
---
So you can add up to 5 points to any 6 specials? Not all 7?
---
right, so you have to hunt around the camp for the random items that might be a scrap box instead of a stash
---
We're between seasons. New season starts tomorrow.
---
I don't know why this wasn't implemented from the start, it's not a difficult concept really. Its a fucken eye sore to have this massive blue box when you're trying to make everything blend together.
---
Old season ended last week and new season starts tomorrow!! Hold tite for 1 more day!
---
The season ended last week and the new one starts tomorrow. It brings in many things like daily ops but more importantly damage nerfs across the board.
---
You also have to keep in mind a large portion of the playerbase can't even be bothered to collect ore at radation rumble or put wood on the fire at campfire tales. Sad but we will likely never see proper raids.
---
I wish i could upvote this a hundred times.
---
Does it have the two shot modifier, because of it does it ruins your accuracy with shotguns.
---
You have returned in a lull between seasons.  The first season ended last week and the 2nd season starts after tomorrow's update.  
---
In the meantime, enjoy a nice, refreshing Vintage Nukashine (it's the finest high-quality vintage made from the ripest Nukas in all of Appalachia).
---
Glad we're at an understanding lol
---
I understand how the game works. Make .45 or 5.56 or whatever, but to turn everything to gamma rounds is a dick move.
---
Not to mention the off-brand ring of fire :/
---
Oh my god. I just thought the twisted muscles mutation was the problem, cured it and three other good mutations and then this... I'm depressed. Thank you though.
---
If you use a courier you should be fine
---
I love me a grappling hook (I can see many situations that they would be better than jetpacks and marsupial) I don't think the game could handle it.
---
Thank you Bender (:
---
I have a Bloodied Ultracite Gatling Laser (with the bashing prereq) at the 182 fire rate which is magic if I hold the fire point extremely still on the target. Definitely give yours a try before you sell it.
---
Correct, there are only 6 legendary perk slots for some odd ( actually even) reason.
---
Holy crap, YES! I resorted to making a mod that silences damn Melody Larkin for good, couldn't stand her voice. I also hate Rose but thankfully she never bugged out for me to repeat her lines after every logon.
---
I did not understand it that we would get credited with the extra strength beyond 15, you sure about that?
---
Cazador swarms.
---
Honestly, an overall lifting (or at least elevating incrementally- i.e. new lvl 55, 65, 75 tiers) of the lvl 50 cap on weapon and armor would make the entire nerf. . . wait for it. . . make actual sense.
---
That mask.we are allready wearing it...its just transparent...its basically legacy now
---
&gt; place it in their camp without their consent.
---
How can you place items in other people's camps? Team?
---
And if teammates placed it, can't you remove it?
---
Thats completely fair too, i also have to add that I've never felt unwelcome by any of the teams and appreciate how friendly everyone was the few times I teamed up.
---
I shot her so many times
---
I’m an agi build. Is one handed better or 2?
---
Cheating in an online game that's already piss-easy anyway and clogging up servers with exploited ammo machines is a bit of a dick move too
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooo
---
That's it, I'm canceling FO1st and switching to some other game!  lol
---
Definitely spiced up my camp.  https://ibb.co/NsDntSd
---
Selling serums is like selling cars.
---
Selling serums for 550 is like selling Ferrari's. They have a limited number of buyers because of the price and can only sell a few thousand a year but they're expensive so they still net 1.52 Billion a year. Selling serums for 200 is like  selling Toyota's. Tons of people buy them because they're affordable, profit on each unit is less but they're still profitable and so they net 280 Billion a year.
---
As long as you can keep your vendor stocked (that's the big one), considering serums cost only a few rounds of ammo (to get the HRF/mass) and a few minor ingredients to make.... it's better to be Toyota.
---
I sell them for 350, I can't keep them stocked at any lower price. I only farm about 100 flux a week.
---
Plus the more serums I sell the further that 17000 cap plan that I had to buy to make them spreads out.
---
Besides, I have been using the marine helmet plan to hit vendor caps daily. It's easier to farm those mats than farm flux. Players will buy serums, but they wont buy \~50 marine armor helmets.
---
The secret ingredient is duping.
---
You haven't seen posts like this, because you haven't been here long enough. We started asking for this 2 years ago, it just hasn't made a difference.
---
This is the 1,000,000,001th post.
---
you see, i actually know some of the people that post here, and play with them. and i know for a goddamn fact that this is often the case.
---
He is correct. Your actual SPECIAL number will go up 5, but you cannot exceed 15 perk card "credits".
---
So with STR, for instance, if you already have 15 there and add a maxed out STR Legendary Perk Card, you'll get an increase in carry weight and melee damage, but you will not get 5 more perk card "credits".
---
Where did this drop for you?
---
Well apparently if I don’t run a bloodied or junkies build I suck anyway so..... I guess I suck 🤷‍♂️
---
I'm down lv 400 here
---
My buddy Ace
---
I sell mine for 250 caps. It's easy to make caps in this game and I personally can't stand other players that think their junk stuff is worth thousands of caps. It's better to move your items for a lower price than hold out for that person that might buy your serums for 500 or more a piece.
---
I like the hunting rifle in 50 cal, manually scope an area from further out. It may take longer but they never make it to you, also very economical with ammosmith and super duper.
---
I dropped a load of junk legendary off at the door of the Rusty Pick as soon as I got it.  It's a shame what should be one of the most anticipatory moments in the game is ruined by nonsensical RNG combinations of item/effects.
---
If I were a stealth commando player type and was blind sold a 3 star harpoon gun in a fantasy world, I'd gut the merchant.  Yet the legendary system pays no heed to my build or anything else- just puts together whatever comes up.
---
This worked in Borderlands.  It doesn't work here.  At all.
---
I've resolved I'm not going back anytime soon.  I'll keep scripping the legendaries I get from drops, and wait until I have the plans for the SS armor.  No matter how shitty the RNG is for those, at least it will be a good set of armor underneath.
---
Kiss my ass, Murmurgh.
---
As one of the few high-level players that doesn't use an OP build, I'm used to doing only moderate damage against enemies even though I have good weapons. I think things will not change for me.
---
Nope. They never will either. Only dupers ever see any (albeit rarely) repercussions.
---
good look. this is def one i was looking to get. appreciate before i end up being pissed.
---
sounds like a good idea but maybe they need to fix other things before trying this to mess up everything else
---
Was fallout 76 one of the titles avalible? I didn't see it.
---
Instagating Lever Action
---
Well, extra skins cost money to make, and its not like Bethesda can afford to do that.
---
Such a thing would obviously have to be paid for. And I for one love the fact that fallout 76 is a free game with no paid extra features
---
/Sarcasm.
---
Cool, I had some magic weapons and didn't even know it.
---
A better "radio" is throwing on a fallout playlist on youtube/spotify. I did that for FO4 when I had premium and it was perfectly fitting.
---
Amen
---
Yeah that stings
---
LOLZ getta outta my camp??
---
Sorry but wtf is this “magic” legendary affect I keep seeing on here?
---
They've already done that. I ran around someone's camp for a couple minutes before realizing that the stupid thing that looked like a red rocket ride was their stash box.
---
Well with the unyielding glitch, I can get my strength to 53 right now. So that’s not really an issue. I was just wondering if it would be smart of me to get that extra strength. Even if it doesn’t allow me to use more strength perks, I’m sure the extra carry weight and melee damage would’ve been nice. But if it doesn’t increase me anything then nah. Not worth it.
---
I've done that too. Problem is those stupid incessant ads on YouTube. I then have to Alt-Tab back and forth  and it's risky because sometimes it crashes my FO76
---
I'd keep the railway.

There is no such thing as overkill is exactly right

The New Xbox streaming app and Xbox Game pass app let's you play the games on your android. The app releases tomorrow.
---
reporting shit like this without providing evidence just clogs up the queue for the actually important issues like real hackers.
---
bethesda doesnt give a shit about this exploit, they added an ammo machine, and ammo converter, and will be adding more and more contextual ammo, and a massive ledgendary ammo crafting perk. they are ACUTELY aware of the new ammo demands of the nerf and one wasteland. this is a low priority exploit to them.
---
It's where she stores all the scrip you suckers forked over for shitty weapons.
---
PSN: Neockwon
---
They're not cheap... they're free. You walk into a nuke zone.. and blam... there they are. The only cost is a few rounds of ammo and a few minutes of time. I can farm about 100 flux an hour.
---
If I sell flux for 500+ I will sell about 5 flux a day. 2500 caps a day.
---
If I sell for 350 caps I sell about 20 a day. 7000 caps a day.
---
Unless you're trying to buy all your flux there's no reason to be charging a lot for serums unless you just don't want to be in the serum business and are just selling them as a convenience for people who might really need one. Which is also fine.
---
As someone with all 5 characters CAMPs in the Mire, I'd be tickled if they'd just put a fucking vendor at Berkeley Station
---
I had 4 backpack plans, they all sold for 2900 each. I had 2 grill plans, they sold very fast for 3900.
---
To be fair. 90% of us dont have proper internet. But i would have liked being able to even just try it.
---
Not on the xbox game pass beta app. It will be available officially tomorrow on release.
---
There’s already fish in the game, look at the little damn thing just south of marigold pavilion, just need the option to get them now.
---
The ghost people were created from being trapped a tthe Sierra madre in that gas stuff, so it wouldn’t make any sense. Tunnelers wouldn’t make sense either.
---
And we already have creatures of similar to both of those, mole miners are just shorter and fatter ghost people and mirelurk kings look pretty similar to tunnelers. I’d rather they add enemies that would actually make sense there and pose a challenge, like Earle
---
Dude that happened to me till I reached like level 95... unbelievably annoying
---
They should just add in the radios from Fallout 3, 4, and New Vegas!
---
If you like that try the obstacle course at the campground between there and flatwoods.
---
I've ready abandoned all my single shot weapons except my Gauss rifles and harpoon guns. Levers, hunting rifles, crossbows, etc are obsolete if they aren't meta. Switched to stealth commando from stealth sniper. The rest is just working out what's viable, what's not. Meta builds should be relatively untouched. You'll go from god damage to OP damage. Everyone else will be obsolete or need magict weapons.
---
Is it related to payment method? I bought mine on Xbox with PayPal and it came through instantly. I’m still in my first month so I don’t know how it’ll go next month though
---
I definitely enjoyed it, hands down one of my favorite NPCs. But I can see why someone would find it annoying!
---
several times have I been flummoxed by the red rocket ride stash. i try to put stashes right next to all my vendors, and I've found out if you put the stash box in the right place, you can access it while your character is using the fire ring, so you can get well-rested and do stash management at the same time
---
Yeah, I don't remember the last time I didn't have ABP on for my browsers but I can feel that. When I did spotify, that was because I was paying for premium too.
---
I have the raider punk and he'll be evicted soon too I think. If I hear anything about brown cows again he's gone. He's been warned already about that shit.
---
No, essentially the more independent damage modifiers you were stacking the worse it will be for you.
---
For example, if you were stacking nerd rage/bloodied/chem bonuses/etc you will see reduced damage because the way those stack is going from multiplicative to additive.
---
However if you just had one bonus damage modifier then nothing really changes for you.  Base weapon damage is the same so low levels or people with non-legendary weapons will see little to no change.  This is really just aimed at lowering the maximum amount of damage players can do by stacking every possible damage modifier which I guess Bethesda didn't foresee people doing originally.
---
You have to be on some day tripper to like that!
---
Did you wait 10 minutes?
---
Launch nuke, kill rest of whitesprings, go do stuff out of nukezone for 10 minutes, reload game.
---
Out. NOW!
---
If I could. I would give you multiple upvotes beefy. I read your reply and lmao. Thanks for the laugh. Take my 1 upvote at least.
---
She always has a headache when I ask her. Figures.
---
They SHOULDN'T work in NW. But knowing Bethesda, it will probably be an oversight/bug and actually will work for months and months.
---
Oh god will there be another contender?
---
Really would be a nice, small qol improvement. Been an annoying issue since launch.
---
Anti Preston sounds fun lol
---
I second this.
---
I said new creatures like them. Not actually them in 76.
---
I know, way over the top.
---
5G is pretty good in my experience over phone networks, would have been nice to try for sure.
---
They have raised it, it used to be 25k (or round bout there)
---
All power armors should have all light mods
---
As far as I know the overseer has you go to her anyways. So i don’t think so
---
I'm curious too. Been hearing it in a few YouTube videos I watched today
---
Okay while I *do* want to snap my neck every time I hear *how now brown cow*, I think the cryptids thing is really cool and he’s more aesthetically pleasing than Beckett, with his i HavE a BaR bUt DoNt sElL tO oThErS.
---
I’m sorry you had to find out this way.
---
How, now, brown, cow!
---
There is a toilet you can build...
---
Yeah, but you can still take over a workshop and build hundreds.
---
I’m no vet nor noob, don’t take in Bethesda update logs as nightly reading as many others do to keep up so can’t say I know exact changes percentage-wise will be made, but as a whole I think a rebalance, ie nerf is a good thing for most, other than I’ve read this doesn’t affect the more rare “magic” weapons still? Not sure if that’s true or not, but it’d be nice to get to a SBQ and not see her annihilated within 50 seconds.
---
Only one I’m not thrilled for is the Colossal problem event which is a bit more tedious already as boss appears to be a hell of a bullet sponge, super glitchy arena yet people are running that more than SBQ, so not looking forward to that fight being dragged out longer.
---
Who is this Snow Will guy? Sounds like a white suburban kid dealing coke.
---
Welcome the age of Vampire and Anti-Armor Weapons

Maybe it’s because we actually play the game!

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Sorry what is ABP?
---
I'd prefer a no popup option. It seems to cause framerate issues for me.
---
This kind of idea would be for like a year from now. They tend to take about a year to implement my suggestions 😉
---
1 is Gun FU is pretty awesome regardless if you have space, auto-switching aimbot action.
---
Yep as people did with the legendary run. I’m seeing messages on here from people who actually played the pts saying it’s not that bad. Soon find out if it’s 80%. Or 55%.
---
I don't hate it. I hate that is autoplays over and over and over.
---
Accepted proudly
---
They really need to bite the bullet and redesign their database or something to put an end to that.
---
Lol, i got a bloodied "tommy gun" smg that has now the dmg my fixer will have after the nerf and i still kill everything easily,also when the legendary perks come out my lvl 535 main will become a Jack of all trades, master of all, and with more points to spend on perk cards i will probably get my damage numbers back.
---
Oof. Too soon buddy, too soon.
---
or at least make our characters perform the tripping animation and/or give us crippled limbs.
---
it’s all about the immersion.
---
Yes.  This post nuclear RPG is really missing the post nuclear part in a lot of ways
---
As if the SBQ with randoms didnt take long enough already, its either killed the second it lands on a rare occasion or it takes most of the time, my ammo and my will to live
---
Is this per account or per character?
---
People are worried about their conscience in a video game?
---
This guy actually had his entire camp held up by only a single staircase, over the side of a cliff. And a decontamination shower as an entrance! Vendors were on the roof but it was worth the search to get the chemistry workbench plan for a mere 100 caps. I think his name was something...420.
---
How dare you say that. My grandmother already burst into flames because of this, just upon hearing that her B2525 Fixer was now only going to hit for twice as much damage as a regular Fixer.
---
Wow why not I was planning on getting chr legendary to share more cards
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
I spent time getting a good almost min max bloodied build and it still takes me about 10 minutes to solo a SBQ, think these people are talking out their arse
---
You can get Brahman for your camp?
---
The people that min-max are losing a vast majority of their investment, and bloodied food builds are hit hardest because they drug and eat themselves to high heaven and use Bloodied in order to gain as much damage as possible. While it’ll still work, it won’t be even a fifth as effective as before.
---
It's not so bad for ants if you use ant-i-armor weapons.
---
me too. I like Rose xD
---
I just got 7 or so hfs from the monongah mine area.  I found an ultracite vein that kept spawning dudes.
---
Well that would make sense, if the bosses actually gave anything good.  It's high resources for a fucking rolling pin at the moment with a tiny chance you might get a crum of something youd actually use.
---
Me tooooo. I hate melting everything in a second. And I don't even use the uber builds. Heck I only use 1 1/2 heavy gunner perks and just lots of tanky boi ones.
---
She got over 1000 from me as well.
---
What happens is that you get the bonus strength added to your stat total. So if you got max ranks, your strength would be 43.
---
The thing is aside from carry weight and damage bonus, that's all you get. You don't get extra points showing in your perk screen past 15 and likewise you don't get those extra 5 perk slots.
---
15 is the natural max for any character and that's not changing with the legendary system. What you could do though is fill out some other neglected specials to round out your character, so you could have more Int for the XP boost and maybe perks like gunsmith that you may never have been able to slot in before or more endurace for more HP so you're not as vulnerable as a bloodied build. That sort of thing.

So does mine, and in the PTS I hit for about 48 damage with every consumable buff I can find. Right now I'm not using any consumables to fight earl. 
---
So yeah, it's going to ramp the challenge of the game up some.
---
I saw a camp that had "Eat Ass Every Day" written in big neon letters at the entrance. I shed a single tear. I finally found someone with the same life motto as myself.
---
Right?
---
Sadly on Xbox sorry
---
" I quit, this update made the game unplayable. "
---
" We should cancel Fo1st so Bethesda reverts the damage nerf "
---
Lube up.
---
Would this stop people from nuking whitesprings?
---
Why would I be talking about NW?
---
Companions are worth it for the extra 1 hour of bonus XP from sleeping. They also help with camp defence a little.
---
It comes at a cost though as you have to hear them and see them around your camp, as you've noticed. If that annoys you, you might have to think about whether those bonuses are worth it.
---
For me, Beckett and Raider Punk are the least annoying.
---
Boom!  There it is
---
I’m almost certain there are at least two live at any one time, and kept within a very small circle. Then when someone eventually leaks one to DemonAsylum, he makes one public. I’m convinced there’s one involving a collectron - I’ve seen multiple copies of god roll weapons and armor in collectrons several times in the last couple of weeks or so. I just can’t see how it works though.
---
*excited hands* thank you
---
Yeah but people won't be able to complain about it anymore.
---
It's like... I already gave you my wallet and all my clothes what more do you want from me.
---
Thanks, I made it to 190 today but have not gone into the level up screen so that is good timing. I’ll wait
---
NW is boring and redundant. We are talking about you dying in adventure mode and why your PA is not good against teslas.
---
No Bethesda are making every build worse, get it right
---
No junk at all, you don't need it, just flux, possibly ammo, food/chems, weapons.
---
I dunno. OP is the one worried about whether these cheaters are getting punished or not, so...
---
No, there's nothing to prepare, except maybe getting ammo materials
---
Not like they drop anything reliably good apart from some flux, which becomes useless unless you're crafting ammo with it at the end
---
I heard it in his voice, so bad news for him on next login I guess.
---
I like his videos and innovsurvivalist, between the two of them I am starting to understand heavier accents.
---
Why, Beth still gives it dry.
---
Yeah I've only kept him around this long because I find it comical to put the tinfoil hat on him.
---
What are the crafting reqs if anyone knows
---
I fight a dude in PA regularly and he’s close to invincible already. This perk and the damage reduction mass nerf will be the final nails in the coffin for me...
---
Stable flux, up to 200 of each type of junk (make sure to always bulk lead and aluminum,  the two items where bulking helps save space), 100 more for a few harder to come by junk like adhesive and lead (tailor this extra junk based on what you use a lot of for ammo or crafting), favorite clothes, favorite legendary weapons if they have reduced weight bonuses (only exception to that weight criteria is if it is a really good magic weapon).  What leftover room you have can be used for favorite items you like.  But try to keep stach to 700-750 most of the time.  Occasionally bulk junk to sell if it gets too heavy.
---
Assuming nothing changes: 
---
Each card is worth 2 coins per rank. 
---
Animated cards don’t matter anymore. 
---
If you’re over level 50 you’ll complete a challenge that will give you 50 additional perk coins.
---
It does work for public teams (unless they changed it overnight)
---
By the power of k-lube, it will be done.
---
800 stimpaks. And carry 4k stimpaks.
---
... You do realize I'm not the OP, right?
---
Wait. Of course not. After all, you had the intellectual prowess to compare a fucking video game subreddit cheerleader to *Adolf Fucking Hitler*. Silly me.
---
Well as a high level player with that many hours in the game what have you not done? With the weapon nerf coming in 13 hours I recommend doing as many combat related things as possible. But honestly they will just add more combat goals later so it won't matter really. Everything will still be achievable and if it isn't it will be patched later so that it is
---
It has to do with the damage calculations and how quickly damage can be output compared to how quickly 76 registers the damage.
---
I've seen one absolute Adonis of a man sell serums for 150 caps a piece.
---
Today I saw a group of people setting up camps at the Wanderer. The guy in charge set up signs and stuff, where he places stash boxes and etc. I thought he was giving away stuff to new players, which I’ve been fortunate enough to experience since starting the game.
---
Yes! Bring back 'Jonny Guitar', 'End of the world' (Skeeter Davis), and 'Begin again' (from FONV). Then, add in 'Enjoy yourself, It's later than you think'.
---
I had help with the first parts of the quest and then when I had to kill the wendigo i was only like lvl 17 so for the next 20 levels I heard that same line every time I logged in.
---
I liked Beckett, but he kept bitching about my Faschnat Collectron singing. He's gone now.
---
When you repair your weapons look at the resources it takes and try to not keep more than 100 of each.
---
So 100 steel, screws, adhesive etc.
---
Wood is everywhere so don't keep more than what you need for crafting.
---
Gunpowder weighs a lot so check your misc. tab, you might have a lot there taking up stash.
---
My pp doesn’t like Viagra though...
---
Did you try hiding under a school desk?
---
A reliable source informed me that this is the method used by school children in the 1950's in order to survive the nuclear fire...
---
As a non stealth, non bloodied rifleman with almost all AA legends, I gotta say I probably won't notice all that much.
---
2 per rank? So a rank 3 card would be worth 6 coins?
---
I expect that like a lot of the comments in here there should be a lot of focus on the "bloodied nerf" even though almost everything got hit and Bloodied is still the strongest individual legendary effect and only gets outdone by (and not even  by a ridiculous amount) weapons that also have explosive.
---
Honestly we should be ok.you already have 2 unicorns a b handmade and fixer and if we have a hard time as bloodied then the other builds will struggle as well if not more..I been playing on a level 26 alt at the moment without my b handmade and its rough .I wouldn't lose sleep over it.
---
Wish the mods here would just do a mega thread and move all those repeated posts to the mega thread.
---
I do two RadAways every time my Nerd Rage goes.
---
Yes, you find that out in a questline. She's not like an exact copy, but her boyfriend uploads like her personality style into a Miss Nanny after she dies  to help cope.
---
What? I just woke up at 5am meaning to go back to sleep. I didn't think it started until later. So glad it's my day off.
---
Before FO1st I would only keep 50 of every junk except steel, lead, plastic, and wood which was unlimited. Anything over I would bulk up when I could and sell. Remember only aluminum and lead save space when bulked. So don’t waste plastic bulking junk unless you are going to sell it. Those items that could not be bulked, you are able to sell individually. When you have lots of lead and steel, save space by making ammo which weights less. Now watch what you use often an increase amount as necessary. I.e. I used lots of screws so I increased them to 200. By doing this, half of my stash was junk and the rest was other equipment. Hope this helps.
---
When does it start??
---
Mine too lol, got my online college work done for the next few weeks. And I thought it started at midnight
---
I bekice it should have started at midnight, but I'm in eastern time usa do idk, but soon
---
Yep because it will get much harder to get flux not to mention legacy and magic weapon real money prices will surge.  That will draw the hackers and dupers back to the game.
---
Probably around 12 pm for me
---
About 12 hours early there bud.
---
Ah shit I just finished reshuffling my specials too
---
I have two bloodied builds and I'm actually happy that they're nerfing it. I'm using my full health AA/Vamp/Furious character and it's fun. More bullets, but so what. 
---
I hope this helps other builds become more viable and it's certainly helping the market.
---
Patches always push mid morning on Tuesdays.  You're super early.
---
No way the engine can handle something Batman could do like 10 years ago
---
This would be awesome.  They would probably have to rework the map or at least structures to have 'grappling points'; but it definitely would add something to the game.  
---
I've been replaying FC5 for the past couple weeks where the grappling hook is used a lot after I finished season 1; and it's absolutely a fun mechanic in an open world game.
---
Maybe
---
They're changing the way damage is calculated to make repeated stacking of damage bonuses less effective.
---
If you're not using a build that does this, the effects should be very minimal.
---
Far out I almost shit myself as my PS4 wasn't on to download while at work. You're defs early man it's not for ages yet... Phew...
---
Okay Australian and Asian kids on PS4 - leave them on overnight!!!
---
It's going to be "wake up early" gigs lol.
---
IDT there's a number but this one should be a sizable one.
---
Maybe people will figure out the game's schedule in Year 3
---
There's a Wanamingo Plushie being added to the rewards of the Treasure Hunter Pails.  Maybe they'll add in the Wanamingo with this update or the big BoS one like they added in the Floaters.
---
*presses power button on controller* 
---
Time to make a coffee I guess! Got my brain soup, cranberry relish and other boosters at the ready... If only they were real life as they're quite appropriate right now.
---
I'm looking forward to it. Yeah it's fun running around killing everything in one shot but a bit of a challenge I think may be welcome. Depending how much it's changed.
---
Watch Angry Turtle or Innov Survivalist. They both have vids that go into detail about legendary perks
---
#IM CANCELLING MY 1ST SUB
---
[Lots of good info about perks here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ism5o0/fallout_76_legendary_perks_info/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Honestly it's just a shortcut to save time.100 bucks a year is steep.but I'm not the best with money or time so the 1 hour a day I do get in I dont have to sort through junk and stash weight. I wish that we had more stash space or separate junk storage but it is what it is for now.
---
Same!
---
I feel that people seem to rarely nuke white springs anymore. I haven't seen anyone nuke anything but fissure prime or ACP in months.
---
When it need something other than violet flux, I have to nuke the other areas myself.
---
I like this. Even if it's server specific. Blanket a few servers in snow and maybe we get lucky and hit it. probably a hell of a thing to do but it would be cool.
---
I recommend a good night's sleep
---
Yes. It should be mid morning when update drops but I say get everything you can now
---
Haha not likely
---
Damn, well this is just to get everyone going and getting everything ready for the next season. And when will the BoS appear?
---
Yeah...well...there's no free room and board at my camp...
---
It should hit mid morning tomorrow, but get prepared
---
Well fuck. But still. Prep time
---
People like you are awesome and appreciated. That is all.
---
I'm looking forward to it too. Hoping for the best. 🙂
---
I'd be worried if it was
---
If you cant get it done I can host a private server so you can get it done.just pm me will be back on tommorow
---
I just put my shit away.
---
Amazingly, it still has a 33% upvote.  Go figure...
---
Works great with no special configuration for me.  Frame rate could be hugher, but I'm running on Linux on an older GPU.
---
Ah. The supposed big nerf? To be honest I don't mind if I have to use a few extra bullets on my bloodied build. I hope it helps other builds become more viable. I'm having fun with my vanguard build more now anyway :)
---
So using an in-game mechanic to blueprint a machine is cheating?
---
Already am got my t65 set all ready my ve 15 plasma and alll the perks ready for my legendary cards specifically the rads, poison, and fusion core recharge perks
---
Got a JFFR cryo, probably doesn’t count but a while ago got B 25FFR 15FR Gatling gun which I gave to my friend for gifting me legacies
---
The official roadmap just says "Fall" for the Steel Dawn and Daily Ops update which is the slow beginnings of the BoS arriving in Appalachia.  Daily Ops will be here tomorrow, but I don't know what else Steel Dawn will entail besides this. 
---
The true arrival won't be until Fractured Steel which is set for "Winter" (My guess is December).
---
7500 from me best weapon was TSE+1A AR
---
Thanks I’ll check it out
---
Honest reply; I'm level 151 and I've done a lot of research on how to solo Earl/SBQ but with all the "magic" weapons and builds research I've done, I've yet to accomplish that. Is there a direction you can point me in so ill have a goal that I can set to accomplish? Because I'm honestly just questioning if im doing something wrong. My "grind" feels like wasted time because, as far as I know, I have the "right" equipment and perks but not the results. Not looking for a cheat code necessarily but I'm just not sure what I'm doing wrong.
---
I don give a shit about nerf, I just want moar story and activities, game is made to entertain me, it is not my daily job
---
Only if you invite them to the team I’m pretty sure, not if they join from the public teams list
---
Bow gang!
---
Oof, you bragging about your bloodied build here?
---
Whenever I'm playing whitesprings is always nuked, its been like that for me since before wastelanders
---
What are you even talking about
---
Ah, well then we have plenty of time to get to Winter
---
It's just odd that given their history, you don't think Bethesda is capable of making something imbalanced or stupid.
---
They all come down to the server trying to prevent item loss when crashing by going back to the last know state of things. Items are going to need to have some kind of ID associated with the last user, timestamps, or some other fundamental change, so the server can tell it is replicating items that are already in a players inventory. 
---
Fixing duping should be their top priority. I just don't think they've been willing to make the larger changes necessary to stop it, but instead it seems they keep putting Band-Aids on the problems.
---
Nice, I cant wait to get the Ammo Factory legendary perk
---
I’d like to think I could
---
Cannot remedy this. You get hit, go down, than are getting hit again. Auto respawn.
---
That's very strange. I've been on almost every day since Wastelanders, and have only seen one.
---
Yes, with the exception of shotguns, which need VATS to work.
---
Imagine if they patch magic weapons too....
---
The patch notes most likely will be released after the servers go down and maintenance starts tomorrow morning. 
---
I'd like to read them now too for sure.
---
The patch notes are always released alongside the patch
---
God bless you Joel.
---
Endure n survive.
---
Don’t listen to the other dude who says you don’t need junk he’s entirely wrong. Always keep good weapons and armor, and keep rare/timed outfits as they weigh almost nothing and are valuable. If you have FO1st in the past check what you have a lot of, tag everything else for search and stock up while you’re out doing stuff. If you’ve never had 1st, keep 100 of each junk, more if you like to build camps and repair by hand instead of using repair kits.
---
oh okay, isn’t the patch on a pts tho or something?
---
:) not at all. Did anyone find the entrance to your last challenge? I look forward to doing the next one.
---
You weren't supposed to be able to blueprint it.
---
That's why you couldn't before and cannot now.
---
 https://imgur.com/prYdbC6 
---
I took that photo about a year ago and it has always stuck with me. It's so simple but so perfect. Reminds me of life back in the day lol. Realism is always awesome. Or camps who build around waterfalls or unique things like that. If it's a camp that looks like it was built with a blueprint and hours upon hours upon hours went into it I'm always impressed.
---
Basically, be bloodied or junkies. At least sneak.
---
Another simple question that could be solved by googling it, watching a YouTube video, or finding another post asking the exact same question that’s already been answered
---
The changes are on the pts in an unfinished form. Ideally they want feedback and make changes before the final version goes live.
---
If I had money to throw around you would have another award.
---
Who the fuck sell them to vendors?
---
You're*
---
It's been happening so long that it is now considered a feature.
---
Thanks for taking time out of your day to cry on the internet.
---
&gt;hot toddy
---
wow, TDIL: didn't know that was an actual term, knew of the drink though.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
ohh i see, i saw they were adjusting the levels of enemies to always be around yours but that’s the only thing i could find so far
---
9.5 hours time
---
Her voice reminds me of peridot from Steven universe
---
I think there is a ton of worry about damage numbers and not time to kill. Watching Angry Turtle do his video on how legendary effects are performing in the PTS. He was killing level 100 super mutants at pretty much the same speed I'm killing level 68 super mutants on live with the same weapons and no damage perks besides nerd rage and bloody mess.
---
Can you imagine a Rose collectron though?
---
NO! STOP! That is dangerous thinking...
---
Ohh that.  Yeah I have that but it doesn't always work. The ads always find a way.
---
The other things we know about are:
---
One wasteland (normalized levels)
---
Legendary perks
---
Season 2 starts
---
Daily ops starts
---
Many outgoing damage bonuses are recalculated.
---
Becoming additive rather than multiplicative.
---
Who knows what else, only Bethesda.
---
oh alright, thank you ◡̈
---
”Go get ’em, Tiger”
---
I luv Raider Punk.  I put him in a priest outfit and he rocks the look.
---
Well at 300 you get 6 legendary perk slots so yeah you can only do 6. No matter what you will have 1 gimped special. For me that will be charisma at 3 I will have 5 15s and one 8 
---
Though say you really don't need perception at all you could leave that at 1 and do 5 15s and a 10.
---
It’ll still hurt but I get you
---
I've been to 2 camps that were partially or wholly sunk under the map. One guy had a terminal that dropped you into a pentagram. Another guy built his whole camp under the map. Was weird looking under the world.
---
No. 50 points is way too much and this would remove the entire point of the perk system, you could literally be every build at once and still do tons of damage if that was how it worked
---
If it is a weapon it will get nerfed, even your fists aren’t safe
---
I went and picked some cranberries, grabbed some sugar, boiled some water and picked the gourds from my garden to make 3 sweet Cranberry Relishes; got well rested and am waiting at the gates of Foundation to knock out my daily quests.
---
Think you’ve got your timing a tiiiiny bit off there
---
Level 50s in the forest
---
Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, etc will boost your damage under different scenarios. Now with the damage nerf going live tomorrow you’ll struggle more so maybe finding an explosive version of the lever action is a good start.
---
PTS doesn't get detailed patch notes, just an overview of the new content and things they want feedback on. 
---
Just gotta be patient, we'll know what's up very soon.
---
After I beat Wastelanders on what was once my main character, which had no real direction on a build at all, I started a second character and went with a 2 handed melee stealth bloodied build. I'm at almost level 150 now, and with a level 50 bloodied sledge I'm one-shotting nearly everything. I'm interested in seeing just how much it will affect my build, but based on some videos I've watched that showed comparisons, I still feel like outside of bosses and daily ops I'll probably still end up one hitting most enemies, but we'll see.
---
Yeah, there's one time I can't hear someone at all in Nuclear Winter. Person A talked like Doctor 8 (just noise) and the Person B replied "yes" like he just understood what Person A was saying.
---
Most of the tunnel below the rusty pick has been there since the Beta
---
Whiskey, hot water, lemon and a usual hint of cinnamon and boil it up? Hot Toddy.
---
Lucky hole mine shows they actually prey to the interloper.
---
We're on now
---
I'm torn, that's exactly why I generally don't use ultracite ammo on Earle or SBQ but Earle I can handle pretty well with like 2k 50 Cal rounds as long as my team isn't complete trash. 
---
I generally don't mind hunting for tin cans for an hour to get them back but it'll be interesting to see how much I go through after they nerf bloodied.
---
I like the BoS one tho. I might like her a little better that way tho
---
“Feature” lol
---
Ok but my point is they're not "the interloper cultists" or "the sheepsquatch cultists" theyre "mothman cultists" so why would it be a surprise that they worship mothman
---
I. Am. Amazed
---
Haven’t met Julie yet.
---
Appreciate it🖒
---
You're not really doing nothing to earle. The point is that everyone shoots it. Your gun will be fine against everything else but bosses in general will become more of a team effort or fail sort of deal
---
Unfortunately, no.
---
For the record: here before said storm.
---
Oh so she is supposed to call you every time you get into the game!? I thought it was a glitch. I ended up doing all of her quests just to shut her up. But once you do complete all of the quests she &gt;!ends up screwing you over!&lt; so that made her even more unlikable for me.
---
I got my first explosive legendary auto rifle.
---
I air juggled his ass with explosions to assert my dominance during tea time.
---
Why the heck are my damage numbers so low?? Oh, wait, I’m a little early. I’ll come back tomorrow. Everyone have a goodnight. lol
---
u/Daemoni73
---
Depends on the build, I would say. Since I'm a double agent power armor build, I try to keep a minimum of five gears, springs, copper, plastic, acid, adhesive, 100 individual screws (not bulk), some rare scrap like black titanium, ultracite, fiberglass, gold for repairs but not more than 25 individual pieces.  
---
Flux is a given in your stash; they can add up quickly if you're looking so devise a good plan ahead of time on what you're using them for.
---
My god the effort. This is brilliant!
---
I really do hope Bethesda doesn't let people like you down who are hyped for the upcoming patch. I really do.
---
All the best with tomorrow.
---
It will be fine, rn with a decent bloody build you steamroll the entire game besides the two bosses, even the assaultron at the event dies waaaay too fast, it will be a decent balance if pulled off right
---
Yea i had other people but it just wasn't able to do enough damage in such a short time if I had a longer time and shorter respawns I would have had enough time if my gun did a little more itd be just a tad easier with the amount of people I had
---
Weird rabbit hole, but I think the mothman worship is one of three things.
---
1. Entry level worship for newer recruits before getting into high end interloper worship and ritual sacrifice, which has been shown to be self sacrifice to some degree.
---
2. Fake mothman worship to throw off people as to what they are actually praying to.
---
3. Mothman worship being a side effect of interloper worship, the interloper worship gives them the ability to pacify and "recruit" mothman by worshipping them, then they use mothman for food and protection.
---
There are of course dozens of other theories, but that's just a whole nother rabbit hole.
---
Haha good stuff!
---
i remember when you could drop a weapon, pick it back up and reload it even if you didn't have the ammo for it. well... lets just say i had a MIRV mini nuke launcher on me when i got insulted and got carried away...
---
How about Centaurs from the fallout 4 concept art?
---
They are pretty terrifying if you ask me. Or the Grossman. It's the base of the slender man and an urban legend in the black forest here in Germany.
---
Other things could be a demon or something. I mean, we have the sheepsquatch, that already looks like it's straight outta DOOM.
---
Yea hopefully
---
start grinding lead and uranium ore people are going to be going though ammo faster then before
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Its great stuff dude but when is the patch?
---
Yeah I seem to get at least 80mbps with cable to the house even during peak so would be nice to try out at home.
---
Ha, joke's on Bethesda, my bloodied 3-star prime receiver minigun already only does 1-2 points DMG on the queen. My numbers can't get lower.
---
We've been tru worse with the Two shot and demo expert nerf, I really believe it's going to be fine, and I say it while bloodied myself and while having in the stash all the be weapons avaible, all legacy included, I truly believe we needed a nerf, while my wife takes 10-15mins to clear west tek I run in there and max 4mins later everything is dead while having more ammo then what I started with
---
Let's hope they never touch the +3 specials boost from uny, that's a deal breaker for us
---
Before today, I knew it as "the drink my dad would make when he had a cold or was stuffed up." lol
---
So how were people supposed to know at the time?
---
If you enjoy being sneakysneaky, an Instigating gauss rifle or lever action can hit 1500-2000 with your maxed rifle perks, sneak perks, etc. Of course, a Bloodied would also be a safe way to go, as suggested
---
Dude that takes a few seconds at best, can't tell me you're that desperate.
---
Brilliant. Well done
---
I like it! 
---
Hope I don't get a lump of coal this patchmas.
---
In 11hrs
---
The companions quests give some scrip (Only Space Girl, and becket)
---
It's not that they 'know' to come to Reddit, it's that they get flustered enough to google 'FO76 damage glitch' and the most promising results tend to lead them here. They have a seldom used account typically.
---
PC
---
What build are the weapons for? I’m a level 35 on Xbox!
---
Now let us see if the prophecy is fulfilled. Who wants to bet on what bugs are introduced tomorrow? Amazing writing!
---
Every PA needs lights in every color, not just those that are already available. I often use the red lamp on my x01 because the red eyes are just scary, though another combo I used was the Quantum x01 with blue lights, which is also very nice.
---
I would also like a green lamp or a bright yellow ( more yellow than it already is), the green would go perfectly with something like the x01 horseman skin (the green one forgot what it's called).
---
Ah the calm...   I’m still processing the boatload of legendary weapons and armor I picked up during the sale.  
---
Of course, I can only trade-in 150 worth each day.  But the rest has been stashed in prep for the brave new balanced Appalachia.
---
Honestly, I needed a break from the daily grind for score.   Hopefully the new season game is less of a daily chore.
---
Yea thats a fact
---
&gt; stacking every possible damage modifier which I guess Bethesda didn't foresee people doing originally.
---
Just occurred to me this actually could be them pre-balancing in anticipation of perk loadouts coming. Being able to switch out on the fly could have opened up potential for even more stacking etc.
---
&gt;I know this will likely get downvoted into oblivion
---
I have to start another Bethesda related community shitstorm:
---
I’d rather you get downvoted into Oblivion than downvoted into Skyrim.
---
Roses are red. Violets are blue.  Um... What this guy said.
---
LIttle effort? Lots of patience sitting there and waiting for the cunt to land, only to immediately take off again, and you're trying to hit her from the sky for a solid fifteen minutes. At least Earl is slow and I can consistently hit him. 
---
I didn't even get loot this last time from him, I just got nuclear waste lmao
---
Yes
---
I'm going to assume around 7 to 12 GB. Since it'll be the largest update since Wastelanders i believe it'll be around that range.
---
Ammo or follow through
---
The Ammo factory one
---
Ammo Factory for sure.
---
Some of them don't even need rank ups to be potent, like What Rads?, Funky Duds, and Sizzling Style.
---
Thanks!
---
I think I got like, two gems from Purveyor this whole week, but even then they weren't super-amazing.  A Stalkers/33/25 Fixer, and an AA/E/90 Combat Rifle.  Everything else was varying degrees of "meh."
---
***thanks to the guys who buy junk and gay me around 40k caps***
---
Already cancelled lmao , nah not really.
---
&gt;Be kinda to friends and strangers alike
---
That’s not very Brotherhood of you.
---
I'm thinking my top 3 are, what rads. The poison resist one, and the fusion core recharge
---
Brava!
---
Yeah third are great ones to have
---
Most likely the normal time for Tuesday updates in your area.. it’s 11 a.m. CST
---
And here I thought it was by shots fired, which is what makes sense
---
Thing I do is when Earl starts spitting at me I put away BFFR handmade and use VFFR handmade then lose rads to about 40% health. Sit in one of the nooks on the side and he can't bite/kick me and just tank him until a teammate picks up aggro.
---
I'm thinking Vampire is going to be a literal life saver for bloodies. 
---
Adrenal reaction still active, sacrifice damage to stay alive and sustain time on target.
---
All weapon damage is being nerfed, unless your bloodied, prepare for misery.
---
Thanks for reminding me of the patch I might test it out when I'm back from work but considering we are tqlking about bethesda I feel like they will mess this up big time. I agree woth you that the endgame content shouldnt be do-able solo.(Me for myself killed Earle in about 15 seconds with a magic bloodied minigun) However I like it more with enemies dying faster than wasting about 1000 rounds per enemy. That said I think rebalancing and fixing some of the broken guns is the way to go BUT if they just make normal super mutants bullet sponges I might be done with this game. Even right now about 50% of my time playing gets wasted by sorting out my inventory and farming mats or crafting ammo if they turn up the output of ammo even more I feel like ypu will do nothing besides farming mats and crafting ammo ( which is a huge pain in *** without Fallout 1st)
---
Probably from the fact that they weren't able to blueprint it without doing some very specific fiddling that they found out from a youtube video. That's generally a good indicator
---
Truly inspired.
---
damn ☹︎ i have a bloodied build and it’s the only one i have since i got into this game about 2 weeks ago, r.i.p.
---
Todd Howards , roaming the wasteland , if he hits you must buy atoms or get banned 
---
Kill him and you get atoms (he would be unkillable ofc) 
---
I would shit myself for sure
---
Never noticed a reload glitch being abused other than possibly this one guy who had what seemed like an infinite Tesla that lagged a lot.
---
From my experience 'most' players use magic guns toward the end of boss fights and I usually can occupy myself with enough enemies in most events to not notice what other players are up to.
---
Example: In Project Paradise I just heal my animal and as long as I (and hopefully everyone) get to tag the boss I don't care how it dies.
---
I honestly wish Bethesda could put the community devised Etiquette in the actual game in an effort to reach all the players and not those of us who both frequent the suggest it and care to listen.
---
Today I saw a guy with a pyramid, greendragoon I think his name was, was very nicely done.  And yes I’m totally going to steal this design and do it myself.
---
Dang, that's 7 hours before me, so it'll release at the evening here in Germany.
---
45 and 5.56 sell great, plasma cores also get picked up here and there but for the most part just the first two.
---
Gin &amp; Tonics are honestly great for winter colds though as well.
---
But also if you’re stomach is ever upset, just shoot a small bit of whiskey (even if you’re not a drinker) and it’ll  settle the stomach. (No hair of the dog intended.)
---
Little life hacks.
---
I don’t get getting bonuses from enclave if you have bad karma, the Enclave isn’t particularly bad
---
Energy weapons use *base damage* in calculation formula, ballistic weapons use *paper damage* in calculation formula. Energy weapons already weaker on live servers, than ballistic
---
 ***"They should just add in the radios from Fallout 3, 4, and New Vegas!"***
---
I cried
---
Cool, thank you!!
---
Maybe Bethesda can do some cross promotion with Ol Musky and we can get a new solar roof texture.
---
Cool, appreciate it!
---
I just planned out my build under the assumption I’d have 20 str and 20 luck. Ugh, this just got a lot less cool.
---
There is alot of events with guaranteed legendary spawns, horde events for example, and others, so finding legendary is not a problem at all. Scrip limit is a main problem
---
Well let’s all hope for a quick maintenance session and speedy download size. P.s. hi from the other side of the world!
---
But this removes magic damage from shotguns, no point to go negative range on magic shotty, tested it alot of times, doing zero damage with -6 range and oneshoting with normal
---
I use a BE Gatling gun, very satisfying.  Good strat to use is to prime it and when you do Earle, the spawns give 120-130 ultracite 5mm back, think I’ve net like 5k rounds in a few runs
---
Edit: Autocorrect mistakes (ultracite &gt; ultra cute lol)
---
Junkies does it the entire way through because there are also potential downsides (addictions) one has to deal with to run junkies in the first place.
---
They can't all reach level 15. You start with 1 pt in each. Leveling gives you another 50 points to distribute. Six legendary special perks maxed out can give you another 30, for a total of 87 pts, which is still 18 pts shy of the 105 pts for 15 in each slot.
---
It will be interesting to see what people do. I suspect most people will primarily use legendary perks to build their SPECIAL stats, but depending on play style, they may select some others. I will personally go with Master Infiltrator to avoid screwing around with swapping perks from an already maxed perception stack. I may also go for Follow Through. Honestly waiting to see how the new damage nerf may change my play style and will probably wait a few days before choosing my own legendary perks. Survival Shortcut could be a nice weight saver/QOL since you could dispense with carrying stimpacks, food or water.
---
You can use this tool to plan your build:

[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Angry Turtle has a set of 4 videos from the past week which go through the details of each legendary perk. Some seem pretty useless, although a couple of them may be bugged and may be more useful if fixed.
---
Negative range removes magic effect on shottys anyway, tested it and was disappointed
---
Taking one for the team. That's the only one worth ranking up imo
---
Ha ha you got me
---
Yes but those negatives are minimal if you do it right and executioners doesn’t even work on most enemies because you would murder them anyway. Executioners is pointless but if it becomes double damage it does what it should be doing.
---
You could always try search, just an idea
---
I should test it with BE25 dragon 🙄. Do u need to switch back and forth rly fast?
---
Wow, quite a good read lol. Amazing effort dude, have a fair night and a better patch day good Sir
---
Should be about the same here in Finland as in Germany
---
I haven't wanted to play 76 in awhile, but this post just brought me back when I get off work tomorrow. True poetry. Bravo, friend. 👏🏻
---
**Somebody dropped 30 3 star legendary weapons and i have been recycling them and testing weird "builds" with them**
---
Stealth crossbow. I feel your pain. Replaced crossbow with quad explosive flechhette harpoon gun. I kill myself from splash damage more than I'd like, but only changed perks from bows to heavy weapons.
---
I always get coal in my stocking - which is awesome because I can then use them for barbecues! 
---
Santatron is always looking out after me :)
---
I didn't have much luck until yesterday as well. But then a B/33/90WR minigun hit. I was so happy.
---
Downside of being a bloodied build. Might I suggest some radaway and a build that isn’t OP?
---
I’ve just switched from stealth sniper to commando and my ammo is vanishing at a horrific rate, so I’ll definitely be going for ammo factory first 😂
---
Reading OP's message gives you the +5% exp buff in real life...
---
I mean if we go by that logic then junkies and bloody are the only good ones. But if some weapons require certain conditions just like junkies then they need to do it more effectively. Instigating should do 4 times the damage and vice versa for others. No other legendary matters except bloodied and junkies. Even after the update they will still be strongest just not as much
---
Shotguns in VATS, weapons that fire faster than 100 with the armour peice will make them magic.
---
Google 'Angry Turtle magic weapons' and watch the 20 min video on You Tube for the full explanation
---
It's your punishment for not earning your sh properly. If you got it threw the vault raids it wouldn't be happening
---
I think it looks kinda cool, maybe not with the hell fire paint though
---
By the downvotes I guess you guys like a stale game with no variety. Oh well. At least I had some insight to give others
---
I did it for the first time last Friday.  Solo.  I think the ghouls are several times more bullet-spongy than normal on that event.  Good news is I won first prize.  Bad news is I died like 3 separate times, never did really understand how I was *supposed* to get candy other than find the jack-o-lanterns, and I was stuck with the weird mask until I switched servers.
---
Exactly. I have about 50 heavies that on paper should be worth dragging out. Got some magic weapons and armor  from the sale. Time to start playing with it all to see what is now viable.
---
you could have just rolled an alt to play with her until she was leveled up...
---
If it's a camp a bullet I will buy all the 45s a player is selling. I always need it and rarely find it for sale.
---
Agreed. For now, Sofia is my mannequin, that I use to show off my rare outfits.
---
I swear I saw that info too. I guess it didn’t make the final cut for whatever reasons. Hopefully they will release them in the future. I would love to create funky mannequin scenes at my camp haha
---
Time to bring out my TSE handmades.. dropped them for stealth sniper, now that's been destroyed by BGS, they are now relevant again
---
i need about 60 Sofias for all of my outfits then 🙃
---
Just google “fallout 76 reload ammo glitch”
---
Yes it works with the dragon lol 
---
Best one to use for it in terms of dps would be a B 50% crit dmg 25% less vats dragon in sneak mode.
---
It’s disgustingly fast 
---
But it’s something I don’t bring myself to do, only tried it once in my private server and yeah, Earle was dead in like 0.1 seconds
---
Lol i’ve been working on making an outfit museum for the past few weeks and now cant even execute my goal 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
It would be the icing on the cake if we could use our photo mode poses to pose the mannequins. Probably sell more poses in Atom Shop too.
---
Bloodied will be fine it's the rest that will suffer.
---
I’d like to request “Set the World Afire” by Megadeth
---
She's one of the few character in the game whose accent can *actually* be heard fairly often in WV. So, needless to say I actually really like hers. She sounds right.
---
The ones that are *actually* aggravating are the ones with the damn yankee accents. Very few folks down here sound like them, and Bethesda could have put a little more effort into the Voive Actors.
---
The true application of the Berzerker legendary trait would be this, imo. Immunity to fear, strike fear in the hearts of enemies.
---
You won’t hear ballistic weapons firing until they reload after the bug, in which case you’ll hear the weapon firing non stop whilst they aren’t actually using it. 
---
If you ever see giant chunks of health taken off a boss in seconds without hearing the weapons doing it, that’s why
---
most annoying voice actor ever, needs to be fired and replaced
---
I switched over from PS4 to Xbox due to gamepass, but I definitely don’t miss that stupid uncompressing process that takes eleventy billion lifetimes for patches! Hopefully nobody has to suffer it next gen...
---
Saved, upvoted and frankly, this should be pinned to the top of the community.
---
I feel like the people who are gonna complain are already at odds with the game, so I'm kinda indifferent to them leaving it. Bloodied/Junkie builds will still be usable imo, just not OP, and even if someone is greatly dissatisfied with their performance, there are still a bunch of options. If someone was able to play this game for months or even years, I find it hard to believe they can't spend a week on adjusting to meta changes and swapping stuff.
---
There’s some men you....you just can’t reach.
---
I love that idea!
---
Id better want them to spend that money on actual content creation, than waste on all those songs. You know they need to license all those songs, pay money, right?
---
Now read it again in Oxhorn's voice. Double the feels
---
One camp I ran into had a Huntsman's lodge kind of feel with all of the creature displays present which was neat. Coolest camp I've run into though was probably the the battle base someone setup to fight the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Even though some occasionally sells I’ve got almost 20k 5mm rounds sitting in my vendor. I’ve been too lazy to feed it all into the exchanger.
---
Fifty bucks on a new dupe
---
&gt;No other legendary matters except bloodied and junkies. Even after the update they will still be strongest just not as much
---
This continues to remain my main concern too tbh. I don't mind that they exist, but I'm sick of the fact that they seem to be the absolute best, at all times, sacred and untouchable, no matter what happens, and if you're not one of those, you're basically trash and should just start over and build your character appropriately.
---
Don't worry about the down votes.
---
To complain about bloodied &amp; junkies, about legacies &amp; magic comes close to blasphemy in this sub
---
I honestly can't understand how a single style of play is touted as a meta, even though so much fun and challenge is lost.
---
Anyway, I would like to see some legendary effects overhauled:
---
Nocturnal: currently completely obsolete - out of the drop list
---
Medic: currently only usable for a very limited selection of weapons - revise
---
Instigating: Basically very effective, but usable to a very limited extent in comparison to other effects (1st shot) - therefore buff
---
I think it could use a slight buff to make it a bit better, but no matter how much the second half does people are more likely to swap to it when the target is below 40%.
---
As an off top of my head rework, maybe it should scale up to the +50% bonus damage, with the more HP the target is missing kinda like a reverse Bloodied.
---
Enemy HP : Damage Bonus
---
100-81% : +5%
---
80-61% : +15%
---
60-51% : +30%
---
40-0% : +50%
---
Be about 4pm in Germany, if it releases like a usual update. All going well that is. 👍
---
That sounds cool, hopefully your outfit museum will liven up the wasteland soon enough!
---
hopefully soon indeed!
---
Have they ever added more combat challenges? Ive never really checked them before.
---
I mean instigating could work like executioners but the opposite. Basically declining damage as they go down in health. 100% at full health but no extra damage after the enemy gets to 30%
---
Cool, I also got a ts/ffr handmade, and a tse handmade.  Think it's time to use that armor with them.
---
They need a new voice actress, I've hated so much I mute her questline when playing on my alt. Especially since she is a raider, it's just bad.
---
&gt; Some of them don't even need rank ups to be potent
---
Master Infiltrator, despite many people scoffing at its usefulness, is one of the ones that doesn't need to be ranked up to be useful.
---
Just by having it equipped, you can scrap your 3 lockpick and 3 hack perk cards, as you'll never need them again. Because this legendary perk gives you a permanent +3 in each of those two skills.  
---
This also means rocking Master Infiltrator effectively gives you 12 free perk coins right off the bat.
---
&gt;That's fucking ridiculous. If you're allowed to do that, there needs to be a heavy drawback, like you taking 200% more damage, your limbs crippling much easier, you being more susceptible to stagger, the boss enraging and gaining more health and damage if you damage it THAT fast, something.
---
Yeah, the drawback is called not having 90% of your health bar available and pumping yourself with every consumable buff under the sun. I know you prefer wielding your pipe revolver and RP-ing as Raul Tejada's long lost mechanic brother from Mexico, but some of us actually use good weapons.
---
Lever actions are good for what they can kill in one shot (usually a headshot, from stealth.) But they fire too slowly to have the damage per second you need against anything tougher. If you only have rifleman perk cards, and aren't a low health build, try to get a junkies, anti-armor, or quad fixer or handmade. You'll still be around 20% behind a commando for damage per second but it's still a couple hundred percent better than a lever action. If you don't like clicking really fast, put a powerful automatic receiver on it. It will cost you some damage since you can't max the damage perk cards of rifleman and commando at the same time, but it's still a huge improvement over the lever action. Or hybridize into heavy weapons or even auto pistols.
---
No, thats great too, thanks.
---
Yeah where the download is like an hour, then you get 'copying' for 6 hours.....
---
The dmg nerf should make it more harder, so it could take a month. Just in time for the next patch.
---
I think treasury notes. Not 100% sure because currencies don't show up in the reward menu and I never pay attention in those last few moments
---
Wow.
---
I think just the scaling from +5% to +50% would both make the effect better while not making a new meta of swaping to an Executioner's to finish off enemies and provide a generalists effect to comprar with the others.
---
While on the topic of Legendary traits I am quite convinced we should have a 'Purist' prefix for having no mutations.
---
With something like +50-75% damage on the weapons and the armor giving either +1 or +2 to all SPECIAL.
---
love it
---
Im really looking forward to see how well one wasteland will work.it sounds great.
---
Love u 😘
---
Since they're nerfing damage I'm sure it will be the same or worse.
---
I'm just a little surprised they are not releasing it to the Guinea Pigs first.. sorry, meant pc players... like they have the last few updates.  Much cheaper to hot fix if things go belly-up on release.
---
wish i could see something that shows the information this patch will drop i have yet to see anything lol
---
Alright, if they do treasury notes then they should up the daily fucking limit on the machines
---
One wasteland should change this.if you go back to a place that had level 3 monsters,now they will be your level instead.plus you will get more xp.if you have a low level friend with you they will have the monster at their level.same with sbq and earl.the low level players will now be able to contribute to those events more.
---
What song?
---
Wait are they in the shop now??  I've been wanting those also and waiting. I got the spring bundle, didn't come with succulents. I checked the shop today and didn't see them, did I miss them??
---
Don’t forget you can buy an extra 300 bullion from Smiley at the wayward for 6k caps.
---
True, that said if they are releasing it for all then maybe they got the job done... It's a long shot as we both know but I'm gonna give em the benefit of the doubt.
---
Indeed it's not clear :  , you can get the following: a large XP grant, two in-game currency grants, two legendary...
---
Well yeah, but that dosnt help with the sheer price of the t 65 armor and ss armor
---
Ahhh so scrip and caps
---
They could make it a static item that requires a specific game to craft. A different cabinet for every game shouldn't be too hard. They'd only need to model one cabinet and then re-texture it for each of the different games. There's already something kind of like this in game too. It's the "Frog in a Jar".
---
All I can say as someone who was on the PTS is have an Anti-Armor (auto) or Instigating (single-shot) variant of your main weapon ready. They are the least screwed over prefixes by the update. Junkies and Bloodied are still 'on top' (especially with the INT bonus fron Unyielding), but for your casual player AA/Inst are still generally better than other options for popping heads.
---
*Vault Tec Scrapbox refuses to change colour*
---
OUTSIDE! YOU SLEEP OUTSIDE!
---
Nope. You’re stuck with the grind.
---
Full RGB lighting for all tin cans please.
---
Noooooooooo
---
&gt; By the downvotes I guess you guys like a stale game with no variety. 
---
Yeah... that's the takeaway from this...
---
Maybe people upvote/downvote for illogical and inexplicable reasons and has little bearing as to whether the concepts are any good or not.
---
i’d be first in line lol is this like a forsure thing?
---
How about hunger immunity while playing? 
---
Or at the very least not atom shop locked and and must have the holotape to make it.
---
It’s not that bad if you play daily. You can basically get 1300 bullion a week. Plus you’ll get some as rewards when season 2 starts tomorrow. It’s basically a week per piece of armor.
---
Nocturnal would be a fine perk if we had any control over the time of day we play in like you could in prior games that had similar perks, but in 76 it's more of a trash gimic than an option to most players. I agree it should go the way of Double.
---
oh i see, why would the INT bonus from unyielding still make it good? cause i have a bloodied sneak build but i have a full set of unyielding armor in my stash just in case i ever needed it for the future
---
Get that Sigil stone!
---
I'm not sure if it should work with the same mechanics
---
instigating currently only makes sense for weapons with a high DMG value. Through this adaptation, weapons with high DPS values ​​would have an immense advantage over weapons with low DPS values ​​but high DMG values ​​(Hunting Rifle, Gauss Rifle ...)
---
Much higher damage with the 1st shot (4x) would make more sense, since high-DPS weapons already benefit more from the other legendary effects.
---
As you turn it around, it turns out that rebalancing is not always as easy as it seems at first glance

Elon musk's child laborers have decided to strike, as a result elon has empliyed workers who will do it for less since he's worse than all those strikebreakers bots in the ash heep. Help mine cobalt for his cars but avoid workplace injuries since he won't pay for them
---
FO76 was founded on candylanders and pipe smokers, since those were the only people left in this sub when the burning wreck that was the release state of the game was obvious. Now they are obviously at odds with people who flowed in later (I started this July via Steam sale), and for whom not every shit smells like roses. I think the veterans can rest safe though, since their precious sub will stay unspoiled when the newcomers migrate away to new releases, with November especially being a stacked month for Bethesda.
---
With sneak and escape artist you dont rly need silencer tho, speaking as railway rifle user
---
And then the mods for the pieces.
---
They made the changes to it after the nerf. It will be better, but not by a huge amount.
---
Same! I got to 95 and just couldn't get the last few!
---
In the end, do you think it was worth it? Just curious.
---
I'm 'resetting' my map with 1wasteland. 
---
What I mean is, I logged out at Vault 76 last night so when I log back in I'll play as if no fast travel is available. This way it'll take a few weeks longer to burn through the new stuff AND I'll be able to experience all the areas I've learned to avoid over time.
---
Nocturnal is the new Bloodied
---
1700 a week (i play way too damn much). Plus that season. 2k then i just need to get the 1650 for the helmet. Im grinding for t65 and have emerg prot on torso and shocks on legs so im nearly there
---
I actually think instigating isn't bad, 2h melee and single-fire guns can get great value out of it, Bethesda just really needs to buff single-fire guns.
---
Consider how Vampire's is better on High Fire Rate or fast melee weapons, it's not a problem if an effect is only good on an aproxamate half of the weapons.
---
I think all legendary effects would be good if the conditions were right.
---
For many this does not apply or no longer applies.
---
As long as the use of nocturnal or medic is so small, they could also be removed from the droplists and made to legacies, so they at least still have a value.
---
The 5 piece uny set is more than just synergy with bloodied weapons, adrenal reaction &amp; nerd rage. It's extra special stats are huge. The s.p.e.c.i.a.l. bonuses will not be affected by the outgoing damage recalculation.
---
Weightless armor should still ad up with berserker.
---
Also if you let the Assassin effect trigger always at least lower the tanked damage. It was that way in the early times. A set of Assassin Sentinel Armor made you almost invincible.
---
Right for some reason I can’t maths today.
---
Considering Mole Miners show up wherever Motherlode surfaces, I'd say they've been using her tunnels to get around, in addition to existing mines and their own tunnels.
---
Helmets have no DT so I wouldn’t waste the bullion. You need to get the buttressed mods for the SS armor. I’m not wasting bullion on t65 because I guarantee new armor drops with the BOS content.
---
That's an interesting suggestion but I believe that it would make berserker's too strong. Full health, best prefix damage and defense is a bit too strong.
---
Imagine a full sentinel weightless armor, would be op
---
And yeah, i'd agree on 6% per assassins piece.
---
I think I've got some in my stash box. If so, you're welcome to them for no charge. What's your gamertag?
---
You're right, still it would he a cool alternative if they won't buff the damage.
---
What / who are these couriers you speak of?
---
Survival Shortcut. Would taking this and not having the mutation that increases my hunger, would that effectively stop me from needing to eat anything else? or does it not produce fast enough to offset the need for food.water?
---
If they won't buff the damage then I would 100% agree with your idea
---
ohhh okay i understand, thank you for the info :)
---
The true problem effects on weapons are Nocturnal and Stalkers as they seem to be the most unpopular and unlikely to be fixable in a meta healthy way. (If anyone reading this would like to provide contrary evidence please correct me.)
---
As for the array of 'anti-group' effects I think they might benefit from a damage buff to make their output competitive with the others with their cost just being only functional against their target group. Also does Ghoul Slayer's work on Wendigos and Mutant Slayer's work on Snalighasters and Grafton Monsters since they are FEV mutants? If not it would be better if they did, just like how Assassin's will work on Humans.

Repost this around Christmas ... we’ll need the extra cheer.
---
👏 Well done!! 😀👍
---
that would totally invalidate them as materials. Like what?
---
Groovy. I'm adding you now.
---
They will 100% give treasure notes, not gold. Knowing bethesda
---
The last part relates a lot to me. I am a casual player. I finally cracked the combination to run a nice stealth bloodied commando meele build. I find my build really balanced. I have to be stealthy to so damage, but if I get seen I have to be smart to not die. This will become a lot harder after the new update. Maybe I have to grind for other weapons/make a new build:/
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I had a bloodied one before my new one but it didn't make a whole lot of difference. It's gotten to the point where even the mirelurks outside my CAMP (I live at The Whitespring) are a threat.
---
Isn‘t there a alternate version of the scrap box? But I agree, more skins would be nice.
---
You should try sneaking in your unyielding set. Sneak perks are not needed, your agility will be about 30-32.
---
first pick will be master infiltrator and it will stay on 1. never again changing to lockpick and hacker!  
---
then ammo factory and taking one for the team on 1 for the start. after that i got one free slot for a legendary stat which i dont know so far. will have to play around and see what skills i gonna need.
---
I've never been lucky enough to find an explosive one, though I've been looking. I was really hoping to get one from the purveyor sale, but only got a two shot one.
---
Compared to the White Springs assaultrons 😶( wtf are they supposed to be anyway? )
---
Rose sounds like a nightingale.😂
---
i do actually, i have mr sandman for when it’s night and covert ops for the sneak damage
---
You do realize that the updates is scheduled to start in around 8 hours, right?
---
Did you take off any perks? The damage change isn't coming till later today
---
Everyone's build is being nerfed. I just hope that they continue to work on balance as a priority post-nerf now that they can calculate better how perks etc will affect damage.
---
Shit didn’t realize, I’ll have to repost this later
---
I sell mine for 350 and they sell pretty well, sometimes I get people buy a bunch (to resell to the vendors I figure) which is fine. 
---
Can't go over 500, that's just silly.
---
nothing changes until tomorrows patch.  you either cured or suppressed a mutation, changed perks, or some other user error.
---
I’m curious about this as well. I wonder what it would be like to have Fireproof, Sizzling Style, and a dense armor mod all together.
---
I use heavy weapons for boss fights but not really anything else as the ammo is a bitch to get a lot of.
---
I also use melee weapons for up close, but I hate relying on it.
---
Any suggestions on where or how I could get a good fixer or handmade? I do have a vampiric handmade, but that's not great either.
---
One of the rare few times it would actually be useful - running the silos. The way it is now, it's just against Assaultrons and showing the middle finger to Sheepsquatch.
---
God's, I love her voice. Would do anything she asked. Anything.
---
Xbox
---
One idea for Stalkers I just had would be to bring back the Ranged VATS Melee perk from Fallout 4. Then on ranged weapons maybe just drop the higher vats cost or make it so the enemy isn't alerted.
---
Ah no offense then! I thought it was a fake accent!
---
I did bloodied for a while and it was just too OP. So I nerfed my character, so that it wouldn't get old for me. Too many people with optimised builds complain the game is to easy, and that it's getting old. One-shotting anything bigger that a humanoid doesn't make sense to me. But a scorched or ghoul shouldn't be able to survive a .50 or an axe to the face. I found that sweet spot, now I'm concerned that it won't be possible anymore unless I go bloodied again. And I just got all the blood cleaned up.
---
Same. I was shocked.
---
I'm actually surprised you expected any balances to be made atm from what Bethesda said. I understood it as THIS is the first step towards future rebalancing. As in future not now. It's the one time you surprised me by not getting it because you clearly understand this game, franchise, company &amp; community better than even Bethesda themselves most times.
---
This is the best shit I’ve ever read
---
Just wear asbestos lining on the chest. Immune to fire damage. Dense helps with explosions as does fireproof rank 3 combined. You still get around 28% explosion damage through that your armor needs to negate.
---
Nothing you can do about it
---
because junkies requires 5 addictions, all with downsides.  Meanwhile executioners doesn't require anything, whatsoever.  
---
So yeah, it makes sense the effect that requires a sacrifice works better than the one that doesn't.
---
I agree. They could do a lot better with berzerkers, suppressors etc. They didn't think them through very well I think.
---
Looks like their souls shall live in ur camp budget forever(
---
Bloodied is always better than Two shot. You need to get things like adrenal reaction to make bloodied good.
---
Agree but at least this game does not force you to buy 'cards' like 2K does ala My Team or to do a different build you have to pay for Atoms (VC), that said I just started this game in late July just got over lvl 50 I hope this game does not go down in flames as 2K21 is broken to me out of the gate.
---
I'd like if we could select a station for the jukebox. I love the look of the blue one I bought but can't stand the single classical number that plays constantly. Turning it off doesn't work as it's always on when you return. Spent 500 atoms and instantly regretted it, should've checked here first but impulse buys are sinister like that.
---
Start a new character,only way you’ll see it again.
---
“Convinced”.
---
It's probably an issue similar to when display cases were first available. Shit was a mess.
---
Hi. Help please.
---
How low does your dr have to be for berserker to be useful? Is the stealth armour low enough?
---
Does your damage go lower than base damage if you have more dr?
---
I love how updates are so rare we have a holiday for them. Patchmas. 😆
---
Well said hahahahaha couldn’t say it better myself
---
It was literally hovering over something and hitting the, “blueprint this” combo key.
---
If that’s hard to you I’d love to see what everyday living is like for you.
---
Ok thank you!
---
That would have been the sane, sensible choice, so if course they didn't.
---
one hitting everything in the game isnt fun either
---
...and everyone else.  Buffs are needed for over half of the weapons/affixes to get them to simple functional status.
---
U need sneak to make rifles work
---
You may want to hold on to the vampires handmade. I have a VFFR90rw handmade I use when Earl gets mad at me, its better losing some damage than being on respawn.
---
I think Bucs meant the crybabies who bring it up every patch to explain why they're right, Bethesda are wrong and how they absolutely are never playing again for the fifth time this year
---
Don't think people don't like pvp. They just don't like pvp in this game particular. Way too many ways to cheese in fallout 76. Don't think changing how pvp works is gonna make anything better. Tryhards will always come up with ways to cheat and take advantage, ultimately making pvp shit again whatever Bethesda try to improve.
---
The constant fuckups regarding pvp have turned lot of us into griefers 😆. It’s more fun to blow up someone’s house with explosive bait than it is actively fight them.
---
Get what deserve. Ghosts of ammo factories gonna haunt you for eternity
---
This. How much ammo are we going to spend just farming. I've already invested in melee as a secondary to save ammo prob a year ago. I have very limited time to play and would rather spend that time playing the game than farming.
---
Figures
---
Sounds delish
---
Yep, with Bethesda there’s *always* a catch *somewhere.*
---
Probably, but I'm not 100% sure
---
Neat
---
Use that 3 star bloodied handmade , switch from rifleman to stealth commando.....profit
---
Gunny 5* and Luck of the Draw 3* means i barely ever manually repair my guns
---
Ok I don’t wanna sound rude but I chuckled at the part where they pointed a fat man at a Mirelurk Queen like, sure it seems cool and all, but every end-game player knows it ain’t gonna do squat to it lol
---
From my experience, pvpers that cannot compete turn to non-pvpers and become griefers. :)
---
Those are from glitched NW weapons and magic weapons, the Nerf won't affect either just all of us who play legitimately
---
True. But as a counterpoint, it's all about whether it's worth using a Legendary Perk slot for that, or if you don't mind swapping perks out to Lockpick/Hack.
---
It costs Perk Coins to change Legendary Perks out, and we ARE getting Perk Loadouts by the end of the year.
---
9.5 hours
---
Probably just a personal preference for you, iI always liked her voice as it seemed to suit her raider robot frame.
---
Big sad.
---
Then again, if it's too hard to resolve or too much bother, then just remove PVP all together. Get rid of the traps and turn everyone pacifist. Make it totally PVE co op.
---
Whatever the dev's position is going to be with PVE or PVP, just make a position clear so everyone knows.
---
This current system isn't working one way or the other.
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks.
---
If both people are happy, that’s all that matters. A good deal is subjective, I’ve traded nice legacies for junk and aid, and I’ve traded what I thought was mediocre armor for top tier weapons. As long as the two parties trading agree that its fair, everyone wins. I’d personally like the cryo because I don’t have one, but that railway is nice too.
---
It means you'll generally progress through seasons better. The 10000xp repeatable is easier with the xp bonus from higher INT. It's not just INT though; the extra AGI means more AP points for VATS, sprinting, or the jetpacks, not to mention improving sneaking. STR means more carryweight and bash damage. I believe the bonus PER helps with target hit % in VATS. Who knows what Luck does under the hood. It's overall a really nice boost. Plus you'll never fail/not meet a stat based speech check ever again.
---
Really? That sucks, I was hoping to avoid needing sneak
---
Ass/sent still makes you a lot harder to kill, and you literally can’t be killed if you have enough Quantums and damage mitigation/avoidance perks. I got used to not moving except jumping and if someone starts putting my health down a little, it doesn’t stay down because I have enough time to slam a Stimpak and chug a Nuka Cola Quantum or two in the time my health doesn’t go down.
---
Whoa how did you find my comment? This comment is like a whole month old lol. Anyways, you might want to check this video out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83eVc3U8eLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83eVc3U8eLo)
---
Seems nerf has to be even bigger than how it is in PTS
---
A moment of silence for all the Zenimax CS Reps who will have to field emails of "MY CHARACTER IS BUGGED WTF DID YOU DO" this week.
---
Thanks, I guess I'm switching back to my bloodied one!
---
I really don't know why it was introduced. Historically the games have always been single player, story driven exploration games with karma/rep, choices etc.
---
They would have been better served not spending the time on it, and exploring factions and even 'guild' aspects more.
---
By their own admission they overestimated how much PvP was actually wanted.
---
Love your work
---
Yeah well I heard about the explosive bait so I tried it. It doesn't do anything. A few weeks back it exploded when you threw it, but did no damage for me.
---
Now you throw it and it just sits there with green stink coming off it. Shooting it just plunks it away and still doesn't blow up.
---
So as far as I know, the only way to damage a base is to nuke it.
---
Check my latest post :-)
---
Those of us that are worth a fuck know how broken it is, there’s no “competing” right now. We’ve only got each other to fight, and we all know every trick, stack, and exploit in the game. The current state of pvp is who can cheese match the best, that’s it.
---
If you type “time now in ET” into google it will display the current time. It’s 2.40 am there at the time of writing.
---
oh i see, so it’s just overall pros then
---
Servers go down for maintenance at 10am et so about seven and a half hours from now. When the servers will be back up is hard to say.
---
Sneak gives you the biggest damage multiplyer,  if ur not sneaking with rifles than just heavy guns
---
This friend seems to have convinced a lot of people across the game.
---
You're stuck with it. Maybe put some plants and pictures around those as you're stuck with em. Possibly banned eventually but who am I to say what Beth will or won't do.
---
Same.
---
There’s a way, but the cry babies will report it and get it patched if we talk about it 🤣
---
Yeah removing pvp seems like a way to go. Then again, these 'pvpers' gonna riot and start crying if Bethesda did that. Why they decided to pvp in this broken mess of a game is something I will never understand
---
There better not be people saying that the game is unplayable because there build got nerfed. This was announced around a month ago, so if they really didn't want to stick with there build, they don't have too
---
All u have to do is move ur camp 😂
---
Most definitely 100 percent agree with you but I dont suggest anything on reddit since nobody import reads this stuff and even if devs did try to become involved they are lazy and dont take any user feedback, only think Bethesda devs like to do is create more problems after a few get fixed and ignore game breaking issues at the same time and just let them continue to stay in the game.
---
I like how it is right now. I have no interest in PVP. I don’t take workshops because they’re pvp zones. I don’t want to engage with u if you want to steal locked resources. If u want to run around essentially griefing by blowing up camps and stealing then you should be put at a massive disadvantage and killed by people who actually give a crap. And then if they want pvp after the first death you’re both set to open so have at it. There’s a complete mode for pvp in NW or open a private server. Invite your friends. Set your rules and pvp on that. Simple
---
Personally I hate switching out cards every time, so I'm gonna grab Infiltrator. I will keep it at level 1 and just use it until we get perk layouts, once we do I can just invest one coin to change to something else. The QOL is definitely worth it for me ;)
---
Am I the only one with 900 hours and lvl 150 , one character only ?
---
 I have to get out of camps more often, have a walk maybe.
---
I’ll actually answer your question (Being that I was the one that discovered the repair cost change)
---
Unless you are wanting a BoS Paint job, no T-60 no longer has an advantage over the others. 
---
Prior to wastelanders T-60 was the cheapest to repair, after, its repair costs changed to be very close to the same as the T-51b.
---
Beserker time
---
Hmmm. But when you're at max gold (5000) and have 300 treasury notes stored up, you can't.
---
All i have to say is I just hope its not a massive amount I’m thinking the worst of 70 percent damage reduction but hopef its 30 percent or under.
---
They say remove the ammo machines then move your camp.sign out move camp again and repeat. Supposedly everytime you log out and replace your camp it will remove 1 of the ghost space from your budget.not sure if it works but so far this is the only thing I have read that works
---
I play mostly solo, so I won't invest in the team-based perks. I'll grab Infiltrator and Ammo Factory first, keep Infiltrator at rank 1 and level up Ammo Factory. After that it's a todd-up between defense (Poison, Rad, Fire resistances) or offense (Followthrough). I'll wait and see how the damage rebalance and one wasteland affects my killspeed and survivability first before deciding any further.
---
Sleep?  But what if someone on Reddit is wrong, who will correct them??? No deal!
---
Don't want to fight someone equally exploting so you turn to innocent players? Noice. Typical 'pvper' mentality right there. No wonder Bethesda is constantly giving you people a middle finger every single patch
---
And that’s why. With only ten players on a server that’s potentially 600 new items that need to be rendered in and displayed. That’s a lot of space taken up in the code.
---
I use it religiously
---
" and passed me a handful like it was the boof "
---
Must be a reference I'm too old for or something...
---
Rewards: Another day older and you’re deeper in debt.
---
I managed to get the old man winter helmet twice in a row. A display case is the closest I'll get to having a real use for those things.
---
Lol.RIP stash space
---
so since using uny armor set will be super good for a bloodied build, what about the people who have power armor heavy gun bloodied builds since they can’t wear it?
---
Google patch 22 fallout 76, brought me here. And honestly this is a rare scenario, I play on Xbox and I've never once seen a boss die in less than 5 minutes. I don't think it makes much of a difference anyways if you work for that kind of build then you should have the ability to one shot anything you like. That could just be me, but I would just nerf melee, thats the bigger issue here.
---
Sorry to be so shameful but if you have any more spare I'd gladly take them off your hands! Unfortunately I'm just about to go to work now (pffft, work always getting in the way of gaming) but if you're around later let me know  :)
---
Don't play glass canon cookie cutter build then?
---
What is that glitch? How exactly does it work? It might explain why my JE15 .50 cal is gone.
---
Perhaps, but the PVP players at the moment don't have anything to praise anyways and any time anyone brings up anything about PVP in this Sub, they get downvoted, much like myself right now.
---
So if they do remove it, I doubt there will be much outcry. They're not actually losing anything right now since the current system is so screwed up.
---
This is the first post that helped my small brain understand. Thank you!
---
So, They aren't reducing damage across the board; basically, they're flattening the hill of damage gain. 
---
So a full stack bloodied virgin will feel the "nerf" but my level 28 peasant with a simpleton pipe pistol won't feel the changes, because I'm already only doing the (untouched) base damage. 
---
Tryhards gotta try harder i guess? Boo hoo indeed :)
---
Pointless unless you are melee.its seems like a nice little bump in carry weight as well.guess we will find out soon
---
move your camp should work.  
---
  
---
just yesterday i came across 3 camps with unlocked ammu machines. thanks for the free ammu and have fun with the gamma rounds, gnihihi
---
I actually posted a little overhaul review on hear a couple minutes ago. Take a look and see what you think about those two perks
---
They kind of get it in the pants, really. PA builds have (rightfully) been salty about it for a while. Unyielding is always the way to go 100% with Bloodied. Even 1* pieces are fine.
---
Edit: I will note PA has an invisible extra damage reduction, and with Emergency Protocols it's pretty hard to die even Bloodied in casual play. But then, Unyielding makes Dodgy better (extra AP) and might even boost Serendipity proc chances.
---
i see, thanks for the info :)
---
I know those plans but don't have any spare.
---
Can I build them in someone else's camp for them?
---
I'm on Xbox.
---
These damage nerfs are gonna be scary I was just starting to get good at the game and I'm low on ammo :O
---
How is one shotting an endgame boss considered okay? Seems audiences Bethesda is dealing with has some very distorted standards. This ain't fallout 4 you know. Besides, you can one shot the boss as well if you tried. I have all the gear and aids. I just don't do it cause people gonna be pissed. I bet about half of the playerbase can one shot the boss if they really wanted to
---
FYI :-
---
- Nerf Damage YES 
---
- ENEMY DO MORE DAMAGE TO PLAYERS THAN THE PLAYERS DO DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY 
---
- BOS CONTENT WON’T BE FEATURED ON THIS UPDATE (22) except DAILY OPS
---
I awoke on patch day
---
Thinking it will be like any other
---
I log onto Reddit and see this beautiful nutter
---
♥️😂 Loved the post
---
Btw, you'll need pumpkins. There's some in the small garden in Morgan town airport and also the Pumpkin House.
---
So you agree with the people that say it’s perfectly balanced as it stands? Cause I’m trying  to say it’s not.
---
Explosive dragon is def better than 50 crit tho, crit legendary only apply to basic dmg without perk cards, sadly
---
I've gotten used to buying stuff in bulk from vendors..dont remember if I bought bulk screws but bulk gears - aluminum and adhesive is at the train station at the top left of the map near where they have that small protest event.dont remember the name!
---
Follow through. It's about recouping damage output for me. 
---
Whilst penetrating gaze is a backstep for stealth (or the end of it for instances where critters have it), I'll be taking out the trash across Appalachia more than I'll be doing daily ops so it's worth it as a broad spectrum pick.
---
To be honest, with a new baby and diminishing playtime I won't see all the legendary perks and am building for basically the next few months on a casual basis.
---
Or are you saying you agree with me? Sorry I wasn’t sure if it was sarcasm from how you responded lol
---
Um... last time they came up with this riot and tried to crash servers with hacked weapons?
---
I didn't panic buy but I stopped scripping ones if normally scrip. I ran daily ops in PTS in the burrows and the robots have me a beating. Made me realize the troubleshooting armor could help in there. I usually toss all enemy specific armor but now it's got me thinking.
---
Me pulling out a heavy gun, as a shotty/melee, because I wanna dump dps into a boss to guarantee drops: "haha, one!"
---
Don't worry, my main is almost 160 and I'm still scared of those charred ferals.
---
No. Go ask Bethesda
---
Not a problem. I have both builds on alts; a Bloodied PA Heavy Weapon user for when my friends are online (is less used now, as grinds being character-based means using a main always makes more sense) and a Bloodied Stealth Commando for when I just want to earn XP extremely fast and grind events for SEASONs rewards. Both are extremely capable either way.
---
wearing patchjamas
---
That sounds like good tip, I do the same with enemy specific armor tbh. I kept scrip to, unless it was poo then I dropped it on the purveyors counter for the next player, my stash is full so can't hold on to it.
---
It is saddening that, that is the case however I do utilise a LOT of crit damage buffs, so in the long run with my Handmade I do get quite a nice return from it however, you do make a fair point because the explosive prefix on not only the Dragon, but the Black powder rifle are HUGE damage bonuses
---
Kind of.  When you move the camp you have to place an ammo factory back down before server hopping.
---
So it's: move camp, place factory, server hop, repeat. 
---
 Eventually you'll get down to 0.6% budget used, which is as low as you can get it.
---
Put a silencer on that handmade with a hardened receiver. Dont have to go full bloodied to 20 %health try 50% you have a really good handmade that might not 1 shot everything but would be stronger than almost anything aside instigating when enemy is full health.if you do try it get adrenal reaction serum more damage at 50% health or lower I think
---
Time to become a nat 15
---
Ill be blunt with you, i think they may add one or two more sets of PA and thats it. I have an odd feeling alot of the BOS rewards will be paints
---
Instigating prefix would like to know if there is any room left at The Hotel California.
---
I've nuts with alts. I see alts like grain silos. I fill them up and empty them depending on my demand. I have alts with crap legendaries for days. But I am seeing these weapons and armor a bit different now. I'm excited tbh.
---
That gets rid of the factory but not the ghost budget
---
Thank you I knew I was close...I  never had this problem but it's nice you can kinda remedy it.
---
It's not that simple, that's the frigging problem.
---
Even with a private server, the existing system is still a broken mess.
---
Nuclear Winter is not like Adventure Mode.
---
You don't like PVP, that's cool, go on pacifist mode and you don't have to worry about any of this. You can't hurt them and they can't hurt you. If someone steals some of your food, or from a resource collector, or a collectron or your water purifiers, in 5 or 10 mins you have those resources back, they're still wanted and they can be someone else's problem who wants to gun them down.
---
None of this clearly affects you or your game play experience. If you go on pacifist and don't want to PVP, all they can do is waste their ammo on you.
---
If you're on pacifist, then the game should also make everything at your camp protected too.
---
I'm not ignoring what PVE players want out of the game and I'm not trashing those players out. 9/10 times I'm PVE too. Most of the time, I don't want other players going after me.
---
But sometimes I want to PVP with others who want to PVP...... In Adventure Mode.
---
I shouldn't have to shell out for a monthly subscription to do that, and again, even if I did, the PVP system is still a broken mess so I'd be wasting my money.
---
Yeh I can't wait either, I don't think it's going to be bad at all but thats just my opinion, it may be broken or break me but I haven't really seen a downside from my point of view. Plus I've been waiting for legendary perks since they got announced, one my main I should be able to get the ones I want to so I'm happy, for now.
---
I'm a little worried about the fact that enemies gonna be much stronger, but we don't get higher level weapons. Also respecing gonna take forever, I have 90+ levelup to do (:
---
have you even ever designed a camp?  
---
you're probably someone who has 3 windmills next to your vendors, lol.
---
It wasn't for that robot. It was for all the other robots watching.
---
[You hang around the right crowds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAjQsJxqZwI)
---
I’m with you man, bring on tomorrow! 
---
Wait is the one Appalachia update coming tomorrow too? The enemy scaling?
---
And a bunch of people got their accounts banned for it, didn't they?
---
As a side note, bloodleaf is plentiful behind the Southern Belle motel...
---
Sorry I think I'd rather find someone with them thanks for offer and the tip tho
---
You get 50% extra damage at 0dr and yes your bonus goes down as you get more DR. And yes beyond a certain point it’s worse than base. Someone has done the maths, I’m not sure where it is.
---
Indeeeeed
---
I heard about how legendary perks unlocked are account wide correct? So if I have a few characters with levels to unlock a bunch does that mean if I have enough slots I can equipt some that I didn't unlock on another character?
---
No they didn't because they couldn't actually crash servers and failed miserably
---
Why is it broken if your on a private server?  If u and your friends switch off pacifist and all shot each other once to start things off are u then not all set to pvp for the session With each other?
---
I’ve started saving certain armor types to build up enemy specific sets for daily ops
---
Ammo factory or funky duds.
---
Ammo factory because ammo. Funky duds for poison resistance in power armor.
---
Or even on an adventure. If you and your friends do the same thing would u not be set to pvp for the session?
---
Thank you.
---
I'm not sure. Dense mod for chestpiece shoukd definitely help. Then I don't know if I remember this correctly, but Rank 3 of fireproof won't help you but rank 1&amp;2 are kinda bugged and will help you with explosions which they shouldn't  normally
---
that sounds cool, i got into this game about 2 weeks ago so all i have is a sneak bloodied rifleman build right now
---
Every time I've tried to build ive had to get both of us to leave  and start a team
---
It’s not about not wanting to fight, it’s just pointless the way things stand. We’re all running the same broken shit, there’s no variety or skill involved. All that’s left is mischief, and salt mining try hards can be really entertaining. You guys take the game seriously, I don’t, that’s why I have more fun than you 😆
---
I've gotten 4 legendaries here within 10 mins.gotta be able to take down mr. gutsy at level 50 plus.usually very quiet no one shows
---
Survival needs to come back plain and simple. Add some extra character slots make survival jist that no hopping back and forth between adventure and survival. It makes to much of a disadvantage.
---
Every player that plays berserker keeps their dr at 0. If you’re playing that style you want every ounce of damage
---
I don't, though to call Bloodied a glass cannon is laughable given the huge DR you get from Bolstering items (or massive SPECIAL boost from unyielding) and the massive boosts in survivability via perks like Serendipity, Radicool, Nerd Rage and Dodgy and mutations like Adrenal Reaction
---
Get a duo partner then.
---
A month from now people will know all the secrets and tricks and be easily able to solo the Elder tiers.
---
just using TSE will save you a bunch of time.
---
No problem! Good luck.
---
I hate level up, takes me 3 hours with the max buff my build can support. I presume this will take now even longer because max level enemies will require way more damage than how much more XP they give. 
---
What I hated even more was the level up while using a protest sign challenge. Imagine trying to whack max level scorched in the Forest now.
---
I like those challenges that come naturally from playing the game (kill X enemies) for example.
---
Idk dude. Reload Nail Rifle seems legit to me
---
If I sell them for more id make more caps and I dobt have a problem doing that.
---
I ran about 10 daily ops in PTS and it's a blast. It's a bit simple as far as *what* you do but you can see where they are going with daily ops. I imagine they'll create more complexity. I'm beta days player so I'm used to the hickups the update brings. I may just leave reddit for a week or so to avoid the inflammation on here after tho 😂
---
No new content lol just more poopy cosmetics you have to grind for
---
Ah lol. Oh well, if they remove PVP, that's cool with me. It'll be disappointing there's one less feature, but oh well. The raging idiots will die down and move on to other games soon enough.
---
But if they're going to keep PVP in the game, they should at least make it viable.
---
When the patch notes are published on https://fallout.com/ it will have the size listed for each platform. You'll have to wait around 7 hours for that to be available though.
---
How high are you right now?
---
im going for this.
---
what rads. max rank. i will than remove sunkissed perk.
---
lockpickin/hacking perk so i dotn ahve to keep switching when i want something unlocked.
---
+2 PER so i can equip the perk so i no longer get addicted to booze.
---
poison resistance (probably rank 1 or 2) just because poison sucks.
---
max rank STR (or whatever level i can afford) because i always welcome extra strength but cos im at 15 STR already i wont get the extra STR perk slots which sucks but is understandable.
---
Make it a recipe so if someone's mic quality is shit you can let them know with a *subtle hint*
---
*"HHHGGG. GWGHAOG."*
---
I would hardly call -8 in total across various SPECIAL stats in return for +50% damage to be minimal. Yes, you could also micromanage and pop chems every three minutes to feed the addictions, but that also brings with it the upkeep costs in caps or time to keep a supply of drugs on hand. An executioner weapon requires zero speccing or upkeep, thus its damage increase is balanced surprisingly fairly.
---
I'm sitting on a cool 1600 notes myself, but managed to spend some of that sweet gold yesterday. 
---
At patch 21 this did happen to me, and Smiley was kind enough to give me 300GB before and 300GB right after the patch.
---
Lol im actually at work n bourd 😅 
---
Happy cake day!
---
I don't think its an issue, I noticed this a couple of f'updates ago.
---
Whoever returns the shot to initiate is always at the advantage, that's the problem. Before you did reduced damage, but now you do no damage at all..... Some will pause for a few seconds and then get their shot lined up and then unload.
---
I don’t need to pop Chems either. The addictions aren’t that bad. You just don’t like junkies to be undermined by what is right.
---
I joined up just before Wastelanders came out so I missed survival. What was the diff?
---
Is sizzling style like, for people who really really want jetpacks on their ss armor and won't just take asbestos lining
---
I used to pvp religiously and I can tell you griefing ain't fun. At least on PC. I suppose you are on console? If you tried to grief on PC, people gonna give you a short burst with them hacked weapons and you gonna evaporate within 0.1 seconds. Damage cap my ass. Have fun in your little greenhouse while 'serious' pvpers are dealing with hacked weapons and aimbots. You won't last 30 seconds here lol. Sounds really fun that what you get for not being serious and being a casual
---
Wait until you learn about being able to have the power armor pip boy HUD without power armor
---
Not everyone wants to deal with the extra maintenance of those two builds.
---
Ammo Factory probably although Taking one for the team looks good too depending on how freaking nerfed Im going to be after the changes. Im a non bloody/non junky player. Im not sure how much value Taking One For The Team will give me or if it would be worth the investment. If anyone has any thoughts there id welcome it
---
How does Bethesda screw up their code so bad it causes *this?*
---
I might take you up on that tomorrow. Would be easier than finding the plans and would appreciate the fall theme
---
Can someone with rhythm come over and read this to me?
---
I don't particularly care for Junkies, just pointing out that there are enough negatives that it is balanced. What I would actually like to see if there ever were a rework of certain effects is that Berserker could also utilize Weightless armor without penalty.
---
Instigating 2 hander melees still 1 shot everything other than a boss
---
You can choose what you u want. I don’t think it should be forced on anyone what should be used compared to what they want to use. You don’t have to have two builds.
---
I didn't know the gun was loaded is one of the few songs that hasn't gotten old to me
---
Haha this, if I could load radaway into a syringer holy shit I'd have a field day on all the bloodied builds out there. Like yeah each to their own and if you enjoy that play style then go for it, I just think it's ridiculous in a game with so many options that 80-90% of players all want the exact same shit copied off someone that was actually smart enough to come up with it. Bunch of sheep tbh
---
If you spent atoms on Ace he basically hands out weapons like these even the melees have weird effects
---
On the opposite end of the spectrum, the random diver you can find under whitesprings, who only has a holotape called "FOR THE PRESIDENT" has the BEST fucking voice. I wish he was used more, or had more backstory to him.
---
That's any online game, but what's important is that it's a new type of content that they can easily add variation to: New objectives, locations, rewards, etc.
---
If you want to go bolt-action/semi-auto/single-shot rifleman, especially with the coming changes, I actually recommend swapping to Instigating. You'll pop heads til the cows come home, even after the changes this afternoon. You double your damage in sneak and Instigating doubles that damage as long as the enemy is starting at full health. So, 200 damage becomes 400 damage becomes 800 damage becomes a popped head because headshot critical. At least, a faulty offhand example.
---
You are sacrificing your time in this game to play it whatever you have on hand. Only fair they should work accordingly. Executioners does sacrifice something too. You have to wait until the enemy is low health to get any additional damage. Seems pretty costly to me
---
No rules, you didnt have the PvP hand shake, the map didn't show any players. When you died to a player you lost caps, aid items and scrap. There were also special legendary weekly weapons only obtainable in survival. The only down side they let you take your tricked out adventure character there with no restriction. Survival to adventure with no penalty. Survival should be just that survival, the character stays there and cant go back and forth. They should also restrict legendarys to a point because PvP is dumb period with some legendary effects.
---
YOU HWAT
---
Amazed. Am. I
---
O_o Cool!
---
[Happy Patch Day!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lmsMSQDVPM)
---
(As relevant now as it was in 2010.)
---
Yea I’m on Xbox, we don’t have the problems with hacked shit like you guys do. What we do have are stackable perk cards, magic weapons, and the ability to create lag instantly. If you’ve got certain rolls right now and have a good team, you have super powers. I don’t blame people for not fighting back, most casual players have no chance at all of defending themselves, it’s dumb. It’d be a lot more fun if the average player was capable of fighting back, people probably wouldn’t be so angry if they could engage other players without getting melted every 10 seconds. Removing certain items and fixing a few bugs would help a ton in that department.
---
Okay so just read your solution. Here me out:
---
With your solution not only can I tag everyone on the map for pvp at the same time just for picking a lock I can now also see where everyone is??? 
---
This means whenever I feel like it I can go Wanted and start a rampage stealing junk destroying camps and generally being bad. 
---
The current system where a Wanted player can't attack first is there as a punishment. You are Wanted after all. 
---
However if the bounty hunter fails to kill you immediately you then have a chance to fight back. I'm all for pvp change but your solution would bring soooo much trolling.
---
i see, ive used a few instigating weapons and they feel pretty good. i’ll probably pay the purveyor a visit and see if i can get some instigating weapons for the next few days
---
No problem! I should be able to build them since they are not Atomic Shop purchases.
---
Thanks but i would like to know 100% as i currently have tge Steam subscription and i don't want to cancel it for the Xbox/Microsoft one if it don't carry over to both Gamepass PC and Xbone versions.
---
Bruh....
---
My comment is 4 months old and it's about the Wendigo Collosus random spawn before the Earle was even Earle, before CP, before Legendary Pass and the Patch.
---
Very cute. No wonder you guys still want pvp in this game. Exploits and magic weapons is all you have to deal with so you think pvp can be saved with a bit of tweaking. Come to pc and come fight with real exploiters and hackers milk drinker lol
---
Not panic buy but I did spend some resources making a set of troubleshooters armor in anticipation of the daily ops. Still needing one leg but what I have already should be helpful i hope. Im not one of the meta builds so have no idea how bad Im going to be affected until I try it I guess and decide then what i can do if anything
---
I just think she sounds like Rainbow dash
---
That’s why I don’t play on PC, it’s more fun with the poors lol
---
Train camp near white springs, done on the train tracks and looking like a locomotive with carriages.
---
You sir whoever you are I doth my irradiated headgear to you, if just for the clock faces as wheels (how you managed the levitating part for the floor I am still not quite sure)
---
But wouldn’t you have this problem with any game where you played one aspect of it 1,000’s of times over?   
---
What, are you currently playing a game that has lasted forever and never gets boring? I would love to know which one that is so I can play it.
---
For 40k caps you can gay me around anytime....
---
Fallout games were never meant to be PvP in the first place.
---
Taking damage should really stop the healing progress and some weapons need a clear nerf +weapon individual damage caps
---
Yeah well you don't actually get to talk about pvp or exploits cause you never actually done any in my books. Real stuff happens in PC
---
Well, Dunwich *is* a thing...
---
"Distorted figures walk the streets..."
---
May I ask, what is getting nerfed exactly?
---
Same, ra-ra is froze by the terminal in the power armor room. So annoying 🙄. (PS4)
---
You're a lot nicer than that guy today at whitespring selling all his Halloween plans for 10k each lol.
---
If it started with 500 rad resistance and went to 3000, then it would be worth upgrading.
---
The entire stations, no...but considering the recordings were made by this games times we could get a few choice tracks from them.
---
I would love to be able to get an sbq kill without being in a group and just relying on my damage output(negligible as it might be). I get where reddit might be upset at the changes, but ,did noone think that those posts, showing how much SHEER damage people are outputting nowadays would affect the devs descisions? Not saying that was the sole reason.  I recently ran into sbq, and jumped into a team, 5 seconds before bomb hit, popped 7 lunchboxes. got all fired up. queen comes out and her hp starts dropping likes its a lvl 1 scorched...think she was only alive for 3 seconds....got no credit for that. FUN.
---
It isn't, I had to check though.
---
Did you not know this either I take it.
---
Sounds like a good idea to me, with a few tweaks.
---
My plan exactly.
---
If you enjoy playing with your SO, does it really matter if it takes a little longer to kill something?
---
Right but if u want to pvp with friends. Do that. And then your both open to pvp when u respawn right. So first one doesn’t count just setting yourself To pvp
---
Being at work and being high are not mutually exclusive.  At least according to my younger self anyways.
---
With Bear Arms you become a walking arsenal. It took me an hour to test my LMG's for magicness after the purveyor sale.
---
I just want to have a pistol build Bethesda. Please. No more.
---
I hate her voice and the shit she says and the frequency she says it.
---
BUT
---
I pretend she is voiced by Amy Sedaris, and now, while annoying, I imagine Sedaris being into the game and voice acting for it and shit and it’s better cause Amy Sedaris is cool af.
---
I've been buying a bunch of quad, anti armour and lvc stuff through the course of the scrip bonus weekend so I feel like the game sort of gave us all opportunities to gear up haha
---
I’ll say just ignore them and play the game it’s not nerfing anything to the ground
---
Unfortunately your right. Thats why no ones order is ever right 🤣
---
All damage output basically, its becoming additive multiplier instead of what we currently have “multiplicative”
---
yes, but I am talking mostly about mods that adds damage.
---
for example:For the gatling Plasma, base damage is 58, if you add a prime receiver you get  a new base damage at 72.
---
For the Combat rifle, base damage 40, if you add a Prime receiver, you see the increase to 50 in your pipboy but the actual the base damage stays at 40.
---
Me and my friends don't bother with it because it's a terrible event, in my opinion the scorched and scorchbeasts are horrendously designed enemies and not worth the ammo to kill them.
---
WTF, why isn't this UPVOTED MORE!? Dude, mad props bro, that was brilliant!
---
Does anyone else feel like this should be read in Morgan Freemen's voice?
---
Oh no... Please no! Don’t do this! If I never see another mounted head plan as long as I live I’ll be happy! Alas, I still see 500+ in vendors for 500 caps each.
---
So my lever action with a base dmg of 173 a shot is getting reduced?
---
&gt; with multiple optimized bloodied/junkies hybrid characters   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; .it’s gotten old. I shouldn’t be able to solo the endgame bosses in a minute or less and one tap every other enemy that gets in my way. It was cool at first but it is no longer fun. 
---
I don't disagree with your post in general, and I'm hopeful about the updates, but one thing I don't understand is when people make the most optimised/overpowered builds they can, with all the best kit, and then say they game is too easy.
---
If it's too easy, why not try a different build, or some different weapons? One of the best things about this game is that it allows for many different play styles. If's fairly inevitable that some build are just going to be more effective than others. So I don't really understand it when people pick the most overpowerd combination of options and then complain the game is too easy.
---
&gt; Without endgame gear and optimized builds im not fairly confident that they will be able to fight tankier enemies without feeling like they’re throwing darts at a brick house. 
---
Not only this, but if it takes a lot more kit to take down enemies, newer players are going to have to spend a lot more time and resources in maintaining their equipment and making ammo. That means the various grinds (caps, rep, bullion, scrip etc.) are going to effectively get even longer than they are now.
---
Licencing music costs a lot and Beth went for for some big name acts this time round so don't expect new music anytime soon.
---
That said, I could easily knock up a mod to allow you to stream your own pip boy radio from your own apple/Spotify account once they enable modding in 76 (2024 at this rate...).
---
You just won't be able to stream it to others without running into legal issues
---
Yeah everyone gonna do less damage,  unless you have 0 perks 0 bonuses then you'll do the same damage haha
---
I’m definitely concerned. I’m a casual lvl 194 sneaky melee/big guns build and I really don’t know what to expect. I am going g to be so sad if the damage I worked so hard to be able to make goes kaput.
---
Or how about no damage caps? That way a sniper build could be viable for PvP again. I would love to hit for 800+ damage with a BE lever action rifle. It’ll wipe the bloodied commandos out of the water.
---
mother once told my little brother, YOU BETTER BE GOOD OR SANTAS GONNA GIVE YOU COAL! Jokes on her, he works at a  **coal power plant**  now.
---
There was a Level 151 or there abouts last night doing this on the world I was on, we had some fun fighting back and forth. I'd die, they'd die. Come back with different armor or weapons and try again.  
---
Totally got the impression they were testing out what works best and so forth. If this was you, it was a lot of fun. Till a run on Earle interrupted it!
---
I believe so. You’ll see lower stat numbers after patch yes but don’t let it deter you its not a major hit &amp; all builds are getting hit by it
---
RIP my heavy&lt;\3
---
tell ya friends ;;)
---
Raider Punk's not too annoying, and I've received many 3\* legendaries from doing his radiant quests.  
---
I couldn't handle the guitar riff either.....nor DaGuerre's chatter.
---
It's already fixed, but I can't do the photo quests on my alts since I can't find the dead tourist.
---
Only thing I've done in the lead up to tomorrow is save my perks for Legendary Cards. Plus looked at which ones I want to use and how best to work that into my current Bloodied build.
---
Unless you pop a stimpak just before going down the over damage out right kills you. Somehow nuclear winter does it better since you're basically immune to damage for a short while after being downed it's easier to be revived, we need that leeway in adventure.
---
I totally read this as gigabytes and was like holy ... then I realised, its a slow morning

---
I was considering using Taking One For the Team, but there were two downsides against it for me:
---
1. It only works if there is at least one other person on your team. If you are on a team but solo, it won't activate.
---
2. Most enemies go down pretty easy, outside of something like a Max Level Mirelurk Queen. The enemies that are hard to put down, like the Scorchbeast Queen, Wendigo Colossus, and Imposter Sheepsquatch, have built in HEAVY damage reductions of 80-90% incoming damage being ignored. A 40% boost to the numbers you do against them is near microscopic.
---
Weird I didn't notice any fix for the armor effect when i was in the pts.
---
Fun Fact - that voice is Ahmed Best, actor for Jar Jar Binks! He’s awesome!
---
They were being naughty.
---
At even one Rank of Funky Duds, you nullify the majority of Poison Damage from even the Mirelurk Queen's strongest attack.
---
Mmhmm....nd who has the capabilities to get into places like that easy? 🤔😁
---
🎼🎵🎶🎵🎵🎶🎵🎶🎶🎶
---
Oh shit I know him, doesn't he voice Jide as well?
---
It'll be nice for my newbie level scrub to be able to make it to foundation without getting murdered too much. 
---
Starting over with the rep grind again. Sigh
---
And as a side benefit, if I understand right she will be able to equip 4 or 5 legendary perk cards straight away even if she can't upgrade any until after level 50
---
Yup!
---
There's no season active right now so you won't be getting any SCORE. The new season starts later today.
---
I came across an anti-armor/aim damage fixer at a player's vendor for I think around 2k caps a while back, that's what I use on my commando. Just save up caps and check player vendors frequently - head for the ones that are selling a bunch of weapons obviously, they're usually either a level 10 selling random crap or a high level with a good selection. It really improves your odds over just the purveyor or finding them in the wild (plus you need the rare, expensive fixer plans before you can RNG a fixer). 
---
It sounds like my rifleman is set up like yours - he uses a TSE lever action, an instigating black powder rifle, an instigating power attack damage spear, and final word for dps.
---
Fuuuuuuuuck I forgot this is coming out
---
The bog standard one?
---
I'm spamming this on imgur and on facebook
---
Now try it with a two shot Gauss shotgun :D
---
tHiS wIlL bE dOwNvOteD inTo oBliVioN
---
True. Might rank up power armor reboot. I saw Angry Turtle's video and he was getting saved from death like crazy with that one maxed.
---
My comment still stands. Even Earl in the forest nuke zone where he originally was, still much easier to hit than Queen.
---
Seasson ended and the new one starts today after patch 22 is installed
---
If you don't mind, whats SBQ stand for? But thx for the list of changes 
---
"Zealot's: Very useable for SBQ, might even become"
---
From what I can tell the weapon here is the Nuclear Winter Pipe Rifle. If not, it's one hell of a bug. But I haven't had it happen with my own Ace bot, so I've got no idea what's going on
---
S(corch)b(east) Q(ueen)
---
Already drains faster as I feel, another sneaky patch? It seems that they can easily have script edits on server side. Seems reasonable since total possible access of food &amp; water gain increases, or just to make that Leg perk worth it.
---
Sofia is tolerable.
---
Logs be wiped?
---
Outstanding *Applauds*
---
Hopefully it will be fixed later today
---
Haha! I like your view point on this item.. 😀
---
I check most weeks to see if it’s actually made an appearance... sadly no.
---
I saw a post some time back stating this item was a type of balaclava (bank robber style) so I don’t feel we’re missing much tbh. 👍🏼
---
That's the clever thing to do
---
Thanks, that helps.
---
Seriously chunk a few nuka grenades at them. No perks needed they'll be dead or crawling.
---
And wich ones are you thinking of?
---
Fair enough, but there's got to be some middle ground. I think if you're already wanted and keep picking locks or attacking players, the bounty should increase in % based on current bounty, rather than a flat rate increase per "crime" and if it goes beyond the caps the player owns, then they go into the negative.
---
With other players going after the high bounty and getting a % based on damage inflicted (the one who kills gets the lions share) they turn into essentially a PVE Boss for everyone else on the map. 
---
So if the player wanted to troll and attack other players continuously (note that pacifists would not be affected and those not pacifist are already acknowledging they're open to PVP due to not being Pacifist) they'd rack up a huge bounty and possibly end up heavy into the negative of caps.
---
Huge payout for all involved in taking them down (compensation for the harassment) and that player has been crippled by having negative caps, which means no vendors and no traders they can deal with until they sell off a bunch of crap or grind events and loot to get back in the green. Since traders have a daily cap limit, this ends up being a big pain in the ass for them.
---
Depending on how deep in the hole they got, they'd either end up realising its not worth pulling that stunt ever again, or they'd screw their game up so bad they'd either have to start again with a new character or quit..... Either way, they wouldn't be a problem for others again for a long time.
---
Based on my experiment of only having a 30 cap bounty and how many players quickly came after me for such a piddly amount (probably didn't even cover their costs for fast travelling) with the above system in place, anybody who tried to go nuts wouldn't get very far before they had a pile of players chasing them down. And even if they did, the eventual payout to players would cripple their game play.
---
Legendary specials.
---
By and large, I strongly agree with that sentiment (" better to move your items for a lower price").   However, I price them at 500-550 for three reasons:
---
1. They contain flux.  Raw flux is abundant; HRF, not so much.  If I buy stable flux from another player, it will cost at least 100 and sometimes up to 250.   I won't pay more than that for it (saw one player with stable flux priced at 750).
---
2. I can get 500 from the NPC vendors.   With the ten percent tax, that means I need to charge 550 at my vending.
---
3. Many of the serums use crimson flux, which is needed to make ammo for my primed gauss minigun.  A primed plasma weapon used by a teammate uses ammo requiring another flux (fluorescent?).
---
I'm nearly always fighting max caps.   I don't need to do volume selling on serums.  They're there if someone needs them.   I still have people buying multiple serums on one visit too.
---
I've seen several camps now charging 1K or serums.   I have no idea why that's started.   I'd be amazed if they sold any.
---
Google some YouTube videos - there are thousands. Follow Angry Turtle.
---
I havent heard about it before, really confused by it tbh because some people I've asked on discord avoid talking about it like the plague
---
Pretty big update coming today
---
Ammo factory or the radiation one, if matched with ss armor, max level legendary rad perk you can go into nuke zones ezpz
---
Did that, now she’s level 120 and I’m 369 😋
---
When you get to level 5, go into settings and turn pacifist mode on. Unless you want to pvp high levels at level 5. Up to you. 🙂
---
Just enjoy the game mate and have a good explore. There’s plenty to do to keep you entertained. 
---
In your stash try keep about 200 of every junk item jjst incase 
---
Lead , steel, acid , cloth with always sell in your vendor machine if you need caps 
---
For you legendarys that you find upto level 50 that you don’t use don’t sell at a vendor put into the scrip machine and then once you hit 50 use the purveyor to get legendary items from. Font use him before as you’ll Jjst outgrow the item you got and it’ll become pretty worthless 
---
Anything else Jjst add smithy_bmx
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, but no it wasn't me. I'm only level 92.
---
Yay! With my internet it will be updated in a month, sweet!
---
on PC there are some radio replacer mods that can bring a little more variety, at least until they get old themselves ...
---
"A friend"
---
It’s Reddit. It just happens.
---
Try to focus on a Weapon type and the related perks for it , today a Change on damage calculation is coming lowering damage for all weapons so running a non focused build will give you a hard time on the long run
---
That's the thing I don't think it will cripple them. All people will do is run as a pair and when the bounty starts to creep higher the friend would just claim and boom rampage starts again. 
---
*not even going to mention the billions of presents floating around still haha*
---
Adding a message season is over on top of the ladder was too hard for them, that’s why
---
The PTS update was about 25GB for PC to update to patch 22. But we'll have to wait.
---
I have a 2 shot fatman with -90% weight, fun to pull out on occasion, more so after patch 22 with how I will be able to slot 5 star demo perk into my build.
---
Not specifically challenges getting added, but this update will have those events where the enemies have certain perks giving them a buff like always being able to detect a sneaking player.
---
No worries. I did manage to find what I wanted today.
---
The SMG has a suppressor as an option.
---
Rosalyn was [pretty cute](https://i.imgur.com/RSVc7hD.png) too.
---
400 is great; unless you really want to do volume selling, I see no reason to drop it lower.
---
I love a bit of friendly pvp tbh. Best bet is to shoot somoene, if they put the thumbs down I'll wave good bye, if they shoot back its game on. Or I'll throw up the emote for pvp, I ask rather than pester, getting a wanted level to pvp has long gone, workshops and arranging works for me these days. The worst thing about Pvp is quantums, most people builds are based on how many quantums and shit they can spam, that's why they never came to survival mode then had the nerve to ask for some more pvp based ideas in adventure. I can go on all day about Pvp but it's the dupes that brought around this type of pvp, if it wasn't for the masses of quantums and shit then we'd have decent pvp, but at the moment it's all cheese. They are either using PA and a Legacy Gat Plasma or normal armor and a tesla, plus in sb and spamming quantums and oranges, even some cherries. Worst bit is they think they are good, but if they dropped aid on death their builds would be obsolete. Rant over lol, but it's true.
---
This is the biggest issue in the game to me.
---
Rose always reminded me of Moira from fallout 3. Always assumed it was the same voice. Especially given Rose would give you the same kinda lame or absolutely fucked quests that Moira gave you...
---
You say you are not into sneak/stealth, so besides the obvious bloodied or junkies route you could aim for a crit based damage boost (\~ every 3rd hit is a crit if setup correct). 
---
One of my favourite chars is a gun slinger (crit based) and recently I swaped some cards to add basic rifle capabilities because I got a nice instigating lever action. It works surprisingly well even with basic rifle capabilities and I intend to boost the rifle side with legendary perks even more. 
---
If you consider this, I could elaborate more.
---
I wish more people sold ultracite ammo, fwiw
---
The LMG eats 308 ammo like popcorn, will be a bitch to keep it fed until you can unlock Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
It's just damage
---
16PM GMT plus the download time that, if the patch is as big as It looks, could be a other hour or so
---
EDIT: I forgot the maintenance
---
I've initiated PVP with a number of willing strangers and that's where the fun is at. With friends, you learn their builds, their equipment and their tactics quickly and then there's no fun. There is no randomness to it. 
---
The problem here is you don't like PVP, clearly, and here you are trying to tell me how I should PVP and how I should enjoy it.
---
As I've said in here, if you don't like PVP, that's perfectly fine. Pacifist mode is in the game specifically for those players. But PVP is in the game as well and some players do want to play PVP.... But the current system is broken for those players.
---
I in no way want PVP setup in some way where it messes up the game for those who don't want to PVP and I believe pacifist player's bases should be, and remain, protected so they don't have to worry. I'm all for suggestions.
---
But think about it.
---
You stay on pacifist mode, minding your own business, doing your own thing, and suddenly around the corner you see a couple of players just blowing the snot out of each other until one drops.
---
It didn't affect your game and you just got a free show. What's wrong with that?
---
Only good thing I got from the sale was a Bloodied/+10% damage aim/+15% faster crits Compound Bow, I'm happy, tho I was trying for a nice legendary Bear Arm or Tenderizer.  
---
A good replacement to the 1 star Bloodied Bow i had been using.
---
Your personal inventory is pretty limited. You're going to have to find a balance between scrapping junk, weapons and armor for resources (and mod plans) or selling them for caps (currency but you probably know that already, I mean most people don't jump into 76 without having some experience with previous fallout games)
---
Actually now that I think of it you came at a good time. Tomorrows update is bringing a huge restructuring to the games difficulty. You're supposed to be able to hold your own against most of the games content regardless of your level. 
---
It's going to be a whole new wasteland for us all.
---
May I introduce you to the ‚search’ function of this website/app?
---
The 10mm smg doesn’t have a suppressed option though.
---
No it does not, and it needs one. There was one in New Vegas.
---
I'm not into pvp but I thought your post was good. I'm L320 and still don't totally understand the rules around pvp. I think Bethseda left a lot of people in the dark.
---
In Fallout 4, pistol builds were viable. I ran the Deliverer in free aim all day. No VATS. Hell, even at range I very rarely used the Gauss rifle I carried. The Deliverer was plenty accurate with the glow sights at range.
---
I got tired of hearing her after a while, yeah, but her voice is perfect for her character.

No one should be forced to hear the same voice lines over and over and over and over. Once you're past this part of her mission she stops.
---
You have a problem with the developers of the game. Don't knock Rose's voice for the developer's failures.
---
If you're just bulking to save space (I know this is like 3 weeks later), only lead and aluminium I think are lighter when bulked.  Check that, but I think it's right.  I think most are heavier when bulked.
---
late to the party, but good to see that it isnt cause of my craptastic card, being the reason behind my fps loss
---
The wanted system is a punishment.that's why you start already on the losing side,without the ability to see or shoot first.
---
In workshop you can claim them from anywhere in the area,not only from the red workshop(really is there anyone who still don't know?).
---
Right now my favourite pvp is hunter/hunted. It only gives you a general idea of your where your target is,or you can wait for your killer to show up,but you're already engaged and ready to shoot 
---
.also with vats shot doing no damage in pvp,now it's probably the fairest pvp since lvl 5 pvp. That beside those damn tesla.
---
Could you explain this a little more. I’ve been trying to understand this in order to calculate respawn times for items, particularly lead and salt. Are you saying that I would have to pick up 256 items (any random items) to reset the respawn of items in the world for myself?
---
they haven't fixed it
---
the people bitching about voices are really just bitching about the repeating messages...
---
once you finish the quests the repeating stops. It is annoying as fuck until you complete the quest. Much like the constant phone calls in GTA Online.
---
Fair point, however, that friend can't simply hand over the caps after they're killed.... Oh maybe through trade? (I never used the trading system)
---
If so, then perhaps the solution to that is if you become wanted, then you're automatically excluded from all teams and trades are locked for 24 hours?
---
PTS patch size was 25GB for PC.
---
Some power armor upgrades use it too.
---
Wasn't that part of the stacking nerf?
---
Historically all engines worked on combustion, but hey electric is not that bad.
---
It was an innovation and I loved the change.
---
True, unless it allows extra perk cards to be equipped it would be useless
---
I axed it a question after it insulted me.
---
The trade system yes and the bounty system used to work as you suggest but it was changed. Higher cap crimes and a bankrupt system. All removed. 
---
Locking someone from Teams and trading for 24 hours for going Wanted is unbelievably harsh.
---
Get the perks pharma farma, green thumb, craft your aid items, stock up on stimpacks. Sell any ingredients you don't use before they spoil.
---
The problem is that new music would cost money. And that would cut into profits from the game sales, microtransactions and subscription service which would upset their shareholders.
---
Nothing at all. But as u stated. U tried to blow up others bases. If someone wants pvp. When u shoot then. They will fire back and off u go. U want a system where u can just grief people. I’m glad that doesn’t exist. There is nothing. Literally nothing stopping PvP on adventure servers. U have to initiate it first. It’s accepted. Then you start your pvp. As you say. Doesn’t affect me at all. If they changed it. It would
---
Rare....
---
A few of questions:
---
I know that Herd Mentality works even when I’m on a solo public team because the game treats it as though there are other people on the team with me. Does this also work for Inspirational and Empath? Do they both work even when I am on a solo public team?
---
How does Empath work? I’ve avoided using it because the description says that the user takes increased damage while teammates take less. Despite this, I’ve seen it recommended since the start of public teams. Is the increased damage to the user somehow mitigated by being in a public team and if so, does it work the same if said user is on a solo public team?
---
Lol I just woke up and also read it like that
---
Oh my God, I laughed out so loud! Thanks, and happy Patchnacht!
---
Strenght,agility,follow through and taking 1 for the team on my main,day 1.
---
Ammo factory on my ammo mule. Easy.
---
And I’ve not told you how to pvp at all. I’ve told you how u can easily with like minded people. You’re just hell bent that pvp should be something that’s available for you to grief.  What changes exactly do you want?  Right now pacifist mode exists. You can’t damage someone. If they fire back at you pvp is initiated. You die. Then you pvp. What do you want to change exactly?  That u can sneak up and kill people who are clearly not interested in PVP?  If they are they have pacifist mode off. You’ll do a little damage. The retaliate and off you go.
---
Figure i do something similar to this but more balanced 9/15/7/9/15/15/15. I dont need the strength so i move it to charisma to share point cards. Decrease my perception by 5 and move the points to max intelligence, and luck. So it ends up wasting 20 point coins over time respecing but its worth it to be able to have them in the specials i need them for more cards. Wasted a perk pack and two levels.
---
And that's the proper way to welcome a new patch!
---
What’s the difference between the two? What is *paper damage*?
---
I've shot at another player in the workshop area and it did nothing. I tried everything but it only triggered when I went to the red workshop and plopped the money in. This was just this weekend, so they must have changed that as well.
---
If they're going to punish people for PVP and picking locks, to the point you can't even properly defend yourself and setup to lose 99% of the time, then why bother with PVP in the first place?
---
Yes, there should be some kind of deterrent, but the current system makes it all pointless so they should either fix it, or make the entire Adventure Mode pacifist and be done with it.
---
Omg nooo. Never Johnny Guitar.  I love the FNV soundtrack but that song is so grating. Jingle Jangle Jingle never gets old though
---
season 1 ended a week ago, its over. there are no challenges.
---
I don't think you understand what the changes would actually mean, if they applied to stuff like lone wonderer and weight reduction those stats would be able to reach 100%
---
What do they mean when they say magic weapons? What are magic weapons?
---
I highly recommend going for rifle, choose rifleman perk in Perception, and then Commando later on. The strongest build. Use this site to plan your progress https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks,
---
I'm gonna be using collateral damage and area of effect melee
---
Just don't be in a rush. Take your time and enjoy everything and don't avoid interactions with other players...there's a whole bunch of awesome players out there. Have fun.
---
Yo Mr.Mothman, pass the boof
---
Nah one day isn't so bad really. Back to normal the next day.
---
Ive been playing since just before Wastelanders and I might have only been wanted 3 or 4 times so far. If someone was going to go nuts and try and troll peoe, continually being locked out of those things and ending up in cap debt seems pretty fair to me.
---
I think people need to realise it’s not explicitly a damage *nerf*, it’s a rebalance. It’s (supposedly. We’ll have to wait and see if there’s bugs with the rebalance or not) fixing damage bugs for shotguns and weapons with very high fire rates. It’s making it so that Bloodied isn’t the only viable endgame build
---
It’s very unlikely to make a huge difference in the early game since the recalculations make a bigger difference as damage increases stack up. Being early game and having fewer perks means fewer reductions.
---
Most importantly (for me at least), it’s making team-play more important! If your bloodied build can no longer solo the Queen, you need some kind of team medic to keep you alive (since bloodied looks like it’ll still be the highest DPS, but not quite as much as it is), or a suppressor/tormentor build to help out. Things like this are the way the game were intended to be played, and I’m all here for it
---
The game isn’t about setting speed records for the bosses. It’s a ROLEPLAYING GAME. It’s about playing your character and feeling like you’re surviving in the wasteland. Having a single build type that absolutely dominates the endgame takes out all of the roleplaying. 
---
I’m hyped, and I think almost everyone should be too
---
But the changes I'm suggesting wouldn't affect your game play. Your argument implies any changes at all from the current would, and that's not the case.
---
Yeah. That's why I added pleasantly surprised. Additive would mean 20% x 5.
---
For most players this change will likely only be minor, but if your build requires stacking loads of buffs to get the highest possible damage then you will notice a massive difference
---
People who build to do the highest possible damage will be weaker, I think bloodied builds might become less common but I don't think these changes will ruin the game
---
I forgot about ammo factory, I'll add that to my list. 
---
for launch day they should give veterans, 50 more coins per 100 levels (50 @ Lvl100, then again @ Lvl200 and so on) that would work to address the disadvantage.
---
Didn’t notice it in 3 or New Vegas. Haven’t got a PC so I can’t play 1 and 2.
---
Look if you spent like five minutes with a calculator you could probably work out exactly how much this change will affect you
---
Thanks
---
My sentiments exactly.
---
I’m a little ashamed I’ve put 1250 hours into this game. It’s a broken and buggy steaming pile of shit. But at the same time, it’s my broken and buggy steaming pile of shit.
---
Man you need to press the button to claim the workshop while in the area,not shoot the owner. On ps4 it is the big square in the middle of the pad,no clue on xbox or pc.
---
And again the wanted system is NOT the pvp.it is a punishment in the form of pvp. Stop acting like that is how pvp work. Pvp works by shooting people and engaging without pacifist. Or playing hunter/hunted.
---
If you pick someone's lock, then yes, you are punished. Just like in real life. Works as intended.
---
Is my far away instigating lar using sneak damage perk sniper fecked?
---
I'm a Steven Universe fan, so I like Rose's voice since she's also Amethyst in SU 😂
---
I've at least 4-5 posts on this in the last 2 weeks.
---
I really couldn't care less how they play. I made a joke about using radaway in the syringer, which steamrolled into the truth behind so many people playing the same build, which is derived from an observation formed over many years that a good chunk of the population are unoriginal thinkers that just follow whatever hype seems to be "in" for the week, month, or whatever small amount of time to encompass their limited attention span. It's sad really.
---
Same
---
Or maybe some people have tried a number of builds and prefer bloodied? I don’t understand why so many people hate on it so much
---
You think I should pay for a monthly subscription to be able to PVP with a broken system that's already in the base game, that's the problem.
---
I never said I wanted to grief anyone. My example was I picked three locks and got a 30 cap bounty. I went back to my base and waited for anyone interested in getting that reward and have a bit of PVP fun.
---
Nobody got hurt and nobody lost any resources from me picking three locks, yet while I'm lit up like a damn Christmas tree, even in stealth, I had shots coming at me from all directions and when I did locate and target someone to defend myself, I did zero damage, so I was screwed no matter what.
---
If someone isn't interested in PVP, then go pacifist. If you're not on pacifist, then you're clearly open for PVP to occur. So if someone did sneak up to you and gunned you down, what's there to complain about?
---
If you gotta do some quests or just want to go looting for junk and not be disturbed by PVP, then flick pacifist on. It takes 5 seconds to turn on and off as you see fit.
---
People who are not on pacifist and then complain about PVP make no logical sense.
---
Happened to many too, thought it was because i was messing with my internet. I just went to advanced settings in the network tab and cleared mac address it should restart and was good to go.
---
No, not even remotely. Just that your take that downvoting means that people want a stale meta is pretty poor.
---
You're really going hard with the bad takes, huh?
---
They're mole so yeah they can have tunnels for everything. They could easily get into any vault with live dirt.
---
To be fair literally every information source I've seen, notably including in-game specifically states that special points cap at 15
---
Absolutely. Why was this not the case from the very beginning? I think I'll never understand it.
---
My advice. Stay shotty for now. In vats they have way better dps at short to mid range. Ads, hip fire. Not good at all. But definitely makes up for it in dmg numbers.
---
This would make my comic/film/game shop even more epic an arcade too! I didn't know I needed this but now I need this.
---
It's not the build, but the mentality that's the issue I think.
---
You know... It's funny us as players know exactly what you mean, but I bet nobody at Bethesda does.
---
So, if there's any hope of this getting traction you'll need to specifically describe its position.
---
Why save time do big damage when small damage do trick?
---
Or crouch through.  Still annoying though
---
I'd expect a damage reduction of 15-25% minimum, although estimating stuff like this isn't easy
---
I still think bloodied should be weaker than the 1 type damage effects since it can be so widely used in comparison
---
I already did, but I'll say it again. They aren't supposed to spawn there. It's a bug. If you want to understand the mechanics, I've already invited you to come learn more, just like the other 3000 people in our community.
---
Yes, that would be probably the best option for headlamps. More options are always great news.
---
If as u say someone shot u and u fired back you’d have done damage. They obviously didn’t hit you. Things are locked at camps to protect Resources. You don’t have to use a private as I’ve said. Run around shooting people. U won’t do anything. If they shoot back they want pvp. And away u go. I’ve asked and had u ignore the question. What do You want to change from the set up now?  U want to be able to do full damage to anyone not in pacifist mode so u can kill them, say right after a queen fight, and steal their flux and junk?  As it is. The person trying to start pvp will, if they have a brain, carry nothing they can drop. That’s not true of the person they’re attacking so makes perfect sense they have to retailiate. After securing their junk or not being bothered if they lose it. So I’ll ask again. What do you want to change
---
Well no. I’m not saying there was no warning. There’s plenty of warning everywhere. It’s still a catch though, is it not? You can upgrade your SPECIALS with these cards, but you can’t upgrade them past 15. There’s almost always a *but* in there. They give and take away at the same time. Example, if you have an optimised commando build, you’re using bullets faster than rifleman and you can’t afford as many carry weight perks as a strength build for example. There’s also no perk that reduced rifle weight.
---
I can’t get this to work at all I’m on xbox I’ve been trying for a week now
---
Yes, please. We do need that. It would so much better than no options for some Power Armors.
---
Thank you kindly, fellow Power Armor user.
---
Or to put it another way. What’s the problem with yiu shooting someone and them taking no damage and then blasting you into oblivion because they have the same advantage your demanding?
---
If switching from shotgun to anything you should be going to heavys, much closer special allocation so easier to move. And non auto rifles are going to be feeling the pain more than most with the new update. And stealth doesn't work in daily ops, the new end game activity
---
Me a hoarding traveler: so i started blasting.
---
Because of 50% discount scrip. I got many reduce weight gun.
---
Quad 90wl 33% double barrel shotgun... In vats...   
---
Hope it's still work after the patch cause it's a beast, it's fast and does a great sound, even more when you unleash the 8 bullets.
---
No because that would be toilet roll hoarding level of stupid.
---
Yes the penalties stack but never go below 1.
---
Yes but take strange in numbers and join teams to counter pretty much anything. I run 11 mutations and don’t notice the downside at all
---
Anti armor is one the best preset, both are good and you should try them against a mireluk queen, king, fawlcrawlers.
---
Its not a complain, its a fact. Here is fact: sneak builds are not good atm and devs even admitted that and said they will look into it. Solution? Removing it so people cant even use sneak builds. Thats the issue, its an issue.
---
Thank you, I'll reconsider my set then.
---
I have a spare one but won’t be gone from work for 9 hours and then gotta update. If
---
Your still stuck I’ll sort u then
---
I saw one as well, was hell confused why were there a alley with 6 or 7 buildings until I saw a few of the foundations, sadly I think he's lacking of the budgets so there were only minimal decors in the interiors
---
Agreed. I hide the scrapbox at most of my camps cuz it ruins the aesthetic
---
Thank you for reply.
---
Thank you!
---
Oh, I *WANT* to jump in, max out certain legendary perks, but common sense says to let others find out first, and try a more informed  approach.  Wait and see what turns out best for my casual gaming style.
---
Even if you are alone in a public team you get benefits from herd mentality so there's really no downside to it
---
 I was quoting all the bullshit that'll be coming at reset. That's all your gonna see after 1 wasteland drops
---
Yeah , there will be a few oh u wish or this is useless posts
---
I already felt I through dart at a brick house.
---
A couple of things worth considering; using class freak to negate some effects and creating a public team gives the positive herd mentality effect even if nobody else joins.
---
I gun him down every time I see him. 
---
No one, human or robot, gets away with insulting my mother the way he did....
---
Just a higher one for snipers, melees etc, and a lower one for ARs and most Heavy Guns
---
It’s hardly specific and it ain’t fiddling either. I decided to see just how easy it was and I had it done in under three seconds.
---
You can also find the camera in random toolboxes, I think.
---
[Happy Patchnacht! Happy Patchnacht! Hooray!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqe3MRb3StY)
---
i think both Vats stats are currently useless for the gauss rifle because vats for charging weapons is (in my opinion) broken.
---
therefore i would recommend the AA gauss rifle, cause the effect works with every shot
---
i myself use a silenced instigating lvl 45 gauss rifle which oneshots the most enemies in the wasteland
---
All right, it is really worth it to keep an empty team.
---
I just enjoyed to the fullest the last bloodied night. Did insane dps and spent all my ammo shooting random enemies just because it will soon stop being so fun. Damn I will miss being a T-65/Gauss Minigun demigod killer. Time to step back, study a new build, because the future is upon us and just like we evolve and change, my character will do the same, even without his powers, he will return stronger. Here's to you, Bloodied Explosive characters, may Godd Howard grants you the strength you need to endure these troublesome times.
---
Amazed. I. Am.
---
Gald to learn it, thanks.
---
Plus with the nerf and changes coming at the same time certain existing perks may be less or more useful now
---
I don’t see the point of a damage cap period. Snipers should be able to one shot anybody when built right. But with appropriate ballistic armor in real life, you’ll stop 3 standard 5.56 rounds from an automatic rifle.
---
  Always be yourself💪😄     
---
   \#grind
---
executioners lmg. Nice. Monster gun.
---
Prime the beast.
---
Yeah but Fallout armor isn't comparable to real life ones. No damage caps would end up in even more f-ed up PvP.
---
Go for perks such as strong back, batteries included and thru hiker. Having perks that allow you to carry more essential items will make you life a lot easier especially early on. Also aim for pharma farma and can do so you can get more stimpacks and food
---
You are aware that they aren't legendary anymore?  The devs removed the legendary effects from all of them, it's just a plain old mask now.
---
I'm going with SPECIAL perks because it offers more flexibility. I already have 2 secret service armor pieces with poison resistance, and I can already stand down scorch beasts, mirelurk queens, and kings with minimal ranged damage. It still hurts when they melee, especially kings, but I'll be adding blocker tomorrow to help with that. I plan on adding fireproof to my build tomorrow too.
---
I would say no. It’s two different copies of the game
---
I know it was an unintended bug but my unyielding mask really helped me out through most the mid game! I wish they were just made legacy
---
I disagree - it would make ass/sent armor less overpowered because someone with enough damage per round (example a well built sniper or heavy gunner) will be able to punch through it. A commando will be less powerful in PvP again, as it should be.
---
I’ll take the bullet, each time, head on, point blank. 
---
My stupid self can’t allow me to wait.
---
That’s exactly what supporting a bad ideology means. If you dislike the idea you basically state the obvious. So start coming up with a better solution instead of whining about me thinking for you
---
There's a lot of awesome radio mods in FO4 already. If they made a custom radio station, it wouldn't be too difficult to port a lot of those over. Then they themselves don't really have to worry about the licensing the content.
---
The grind to get to the next area*
---
Ain't no way Bethesda easing up on the FO76 grind.
---
Take your time and Enjoy the game and do whatever you want to do whenever you want  to , you’ll see loads of high levels running around but there’s no need to rush to get there. This forums great if you need any advice or anything and it’s got a great bunch of people
---
Heavy Gunners are equal to Comando if well equipped. They need to nerf the Tesla first before otherwise it's just Tesla again.
---
I knew you Colonel Gutsys are up to something with that dmg!
---
Just because I’m thinking outside the box. Get your cancel culture out of here and open your mind. You aren’t even trying to think about ways to solve anything just how to complain about everything. Start being a responder like your name suggests  and help instead of whining all the time.
---
Personally coming from a bloodied rifleman build with two gauss rifles I’ll tell you this, don’t. 
---
The vats on them only work if you don’t charge the shot, even if you have 95% and you charge it it’ll miss 99% of the time,
---
I only use a quad gauss for spam damage now, if you want consistent damage as a rifleman use a lever action or a handmade
---
I don’t know, a dude firing off 10 .308 a second is definitely going to outperform a dude firing 4-5 5.56 a second.
---
If you join someone in a private team they are able to place stuff in your camp. Some people have actually used that as a griefing method by tricking someone into joining their private team and then placing ammo factories in their camp.
---
From what I've heard the ammo factory is a pain to remove. The only way to remove it is to move you camp and it will still eat up a portion of your budget afterwards.
---
IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS? THAT’S A GOVERNMENT SECRET! YOU OUGHT TO BE EXECUTED FOR TREASON!
---
Those are electric motors not engines.
---
The AR has more accuracy and range. It also has sights and silencer. Silencers are useful if running Stealth.
---
And We love and thank you for it , it’s people like you who win medals (posthumously of course) 👍
---
3 star, too many 2 stars just destroy your stash
---
It was an annoying way to waste an hour of my life to finally roll an unyeilding one lol.
---
Were legendary perks being dropped today also? I thought they were just moving into phase one of “One Wasteland for All”
---
It’s all about how you use it. It’s definitely going to be situational, when it comes to which is better. A sniper for example won’t be able to take out a heavy gunner in a head to head fight, which is why he stays back and shoots from afar, where the gunman isn’t able to reach him.
---
At this point I genuinely hate Andrews sisters.
---
Hopefully you at least got some use out of it aha mines lasted me three characters
---
Having your vendor easily accessible near the spawn point and a visitor having a slow laggy Internet access!
---
I think I will use these:
---
What Rads - so I can get rid of my decontamination shower (I will need budget for the upcoming camp items)
---
Legendary Luck - there are so many good perks in Luck
---
Hack and Slash - I'd love to be able to slaughter a cluster of enemies with one punch in my Grognak costume
---
Take One for the Team - bigger damage is always welcome
---
Always buy 3* even if it’s trash it means you have 40 script for the next day to try again
---
It is just up the stairs, first thing on the right. So some son of a bitch could have stolen it! Why are people even allowed to connect when they’re below a certain ping if they can’t prevent glitches like that?
---
RIP. Luckily I've kept hold of my anti armour limb damage mm gauntlet because angryturtle said it would be viable after the patch. Same with my swing speed instigating mm gauntlet hehehe
---
Sounds like Free States instead of Pioneer Scouts, imo... lol
---
My advice, is to pull a 1 star untill you get your main weapon, then start pulling 2 stars untill you get a weapon to swap what your using, then start pulling 3 stars. The rng on this game is trash. Get used to it. And if you think weapons are a pain, wait untill you want good armor. Good luck.
---
Sounds more like you should be angry with yourself for having not managed your inventory before showing up to someone’s camp and blaming them that their stash boxes aren’t in the places and colors your handicap demands.
---
I'm sorry bud, but I just got here. Things are starting to get serious
---
As far as I know it all drops today , damage nerf, legendary perks, one wastelanders , daily ops, new scoreboard challenge and some bug fixes ( magic weapons fix ?) . So a lot to experience and try out on my day off tomorrow , working late shift tonight but will be checking Reddit on the sly to see how it’s all going . I expect Reddit will blow up with posts about the nerf and also the inevitable stuff bethesda breaks when it releases an update
---
It's been like that for 6 patches now, reported multiple times but some misinformation got spread about it only effecting people with glitched camps so people just up and stopped caring because they wanted glitchers to suffer.
---
I don’t care about any affects I just want the mask because it looks good
---
I got use out of it but didn't exactly need it at that point.  It was nice while it lasted though!
---
Well this is the greatest literary moment in human history
---
I second that. Also InnovSurvivalist
---
This is exactly where I'm at- I'm surprised so many people are throwing away that slot for something you can literally just swap into in seconds. QoL, sure.. but you're not finding anything special in locked boxes. And nukes.. I'm like you, occasionally on a weekend I'll get one or two out.
---
Depends if you need a weapon, if you need one u would do 2 stars, if you are just after a different weapon then roll 3 stars.
---
And that legendary spawns have been nerfed.
---
Now that event ended any way to even buy it?
---
I keep trying to do a pistol build. But keep failing :(
---
Picked up some good legendary pistols in the sale, so might give it another go.
---
EDIT: Dual-wielding would be nice
---
This was brilliantly written and “you’ll always have this community” is correct. This community is the most unique experience I have ever had in gaming.
---
As far as shit you get? Prolly not.
---
I’m late shift tonight , so will be checking Reddit on the sly to see how it’s landed, which will lift my shift a little . But day off tomorrow to play woohoo 🥳
---
Yep the Power Patrol season starts later today... I'm newish too, lvl 54 now...was able to finish second part of board and a couple spaces on the last part before it shut down, looking forward to doing it from day one.
---
You’re going to have to join the dots for me on that one. How would inexperience in camp design relate to thinking the huge vault-tec generator is a confusing choice over a fusion generator when they supply equal power? And three windmills next to my vendors? Yep, you lost me I’m afraid.
---
She is apparently lol...
---
Go put 3 windmills by your vendors and tell me how that works out for you.
---
I assume there's a log in the database, that keeps track when did you  trigger some "events". Like purchasing gold from Smiley, when was the first time you made purchase in vendor/scrip machine.   
---
I don't have further backlog , but with last Patch (21) those logs were re-set to me, meaning I could trigger that "event" again. Depending when is your daily scrip limit reset, this might also give you double scrip/vendor caps for a day if you sell your stuff beforehand.
---
But as I said, it's Bethesda, so it's a 50/50. Worst case scenario you don't forget to purchase your bullion this week :)
---
I bet Rosalyn should've quit smoking... Can't believe Ms Nanny has **that** voice in her voicebank.
---
After this update drops they could really do with fine tuning certain weapon types. Snipers for example should do lots more damage than they do currently, because theres currently no point in using them because a handmade will do more DPS over time. The same goes for slow firing weapons like the lever action rifle and pistols and rocket launchers/ fatmans
---
What gear are you after? Ranged weapons  you don't need more than 2 star....
---
Wonder what new bug it will bring :(
---
I didn't get a chance to get on Sunday to clear my inventory of scrip fodder, the sale left me over loaded with it. So much I'm carrying 600lbs of 3 star junk on me because I can't store it. 
---
So yesterday I realized I had 15 minutes before the sale ended. Figured I could get a few more bargain purchases even though I had no room to hold them. Sure enough I sold a bunch of light stuff like batons and then rolled heavy miniguns and the like...
---
So I'm beyond over loaded at this point. I'm going through my stash and realizing I have *nothing* I can simply do without, so I decide to just log out and wait for the scrip reset. 
---
I pull up pip to eat and drink before I do, as I like to always stay 'topped off' and while in pip I hear the sound of a PA stomping past me. 
---
When I exited pip I see a duffle on the ground in front of Mumbles so naturally I check it...
---
My eyes widened as I see an endless list of 3 star weapons. Nothing looks 'god tier' but a few standouts including 2 exploding handmades catch my eye. 
---
I shake me head in shame as I frantically empty the bag, half curious if there is a weight limit with regards to personal inventory. Now I'm going to be over loaded for days longer than I thought but ultimately I think it'll be worth it. ;p
---
(I'll be getting a friend to help me load most onto a mule in the am)
---
Nice work, cool idea. Bethesad will probably do nothing like this at all. I would be legitimately surprised if a pet could do more than stay at your camp. Personally I wouldn't travel with my pet anyway, but I know others would like to.
---
Yup what this guy said :)
---
How many sources of Damage do you draw from? (Instigating itself hasn’t changed BTW)
---
3-4 Sources, (Ie Perks cards) you’ll barely notice. 
---
6-7 You will notice and it could be a problem. 
---
10-11 Sources, yeah, you’ll be losing around 60+% of your damage output.
---
Okay, but I will accept the 5 story high deathclaw.
---
I would like to see aliens as pets I think it would be cool having something like E.T. in a vault 51 jumpsuit(that doesnt quite fit) following you around as a companion
---
Depends on what you'll be happy with.
---
Vampire Explosive handmade
---
And
---
Stalker's Lever Action with faster reload
---
Or
---
Quad Double Barreled Shotgun with +33% Vats chance AND 25% less AP.
---
All of these might be useful to you, or none at all. It's all a gamble as to what you'll get. But the POSSIBLE  gaining of a God roll is always there. And don't forget there's probably someone that's after what you just got
---
If you haven't seen posts like this you haven't looked very hard at all. Here are the quick replies you'll get here;
---
1. It costs more money for Bethesda to buy the licenses
---
2. Play Spotify whilst playing the game. Plenty of people have their own Fallout appropriate playlists for you to enjoy that shouldn't ruin your immersion.
---
I think that an ammo box would be nice. That way I can stash the stuff I dont use or sell it without taking up a lot of weight in my actual stash
---
Imagine a legendary perk card that allowed you to share more perk cards..
---
...why?
---
Radstorms need to be more frequent and longer
---
Yeh I know it won't affect me as I said, I meant as in bugs that may or may not come with other set ups etc. I know my builds will be viable after the update but certain things I have won't be, some things may bug, a new meta may be born into the game for all we know.
---
So ready for the S.C.O.R.E. grind once more, and having to figure out how my current build holds up with the nerfs. Overall though, super excited to see how this balances out everything overall!
---
Upcoming damage reduction may be the panacea from Bloodied plague. I swear to Crom, it's worse than Scorched.
---
&gt; with legendary perks arriving, I’ll be able to get some of that missing damage back 
---
That is the main reason of overall damage weakening, i assume. I'm sure most players eventually will find their way through changing their builds.
---
Have you looked into Nvidia Profile Inspector? It has a ton more settings to tweak, specifically the Global and Application G-Sync state.
---
I think instigating would be cool if it did double damage to critical hits
---
int. legendary boost your xp or not?
---
Not really because I paid for the items with caps, taking them off ppls hands, who may have needed the room for other more valuable things. So it's win win, people make caps I get gear that may again become viable. Quite the opposite of stupid really, makes the world go round, the game world that is because after all we are talking about a game, not real life lol.
---
Dang it mods. How are we supposed to ridicule trollers when you are so on the ball and doing your job.
---
I’m also glad I’m a hoarder and have kept a few anti armor weapons. I’ve had a anti armor handmade 1525 prefixes forever but always pushed it to the side. Tried trading it away but never got good offers for it. Guess I’ll see what it does after patch today
---
Just few days back I fast traveled near blast zone to witness it myself. I stepped few feet too far, nuke exploded and few seconds later I was was dead despite power armor. It was hilarious.
---
I understand tho, I’m a bloodied sneak food build so the legendary perks for me are dead on and straight forward. But those power armor legendary perks are sketchy as hell, not worth waste investing to get nerfed to oblivion a week later.
---
I am so happy to see people telling you to take your time and explore. I always see people telling people to rush through the wastelanders quests and want to bang my head against the wall. 
---
Beyond what others said, pick up all weapons and junk early on and scrap them at workbenches. When you scrap weapons / armor you learn mods to improve your gear. Scrap from the junk can be used to repair and upgrade your weapons/armor at those workbenches. 
---
Also try and use level appropriate gear. If you are level 20, it’s time to say goodbye to your level 5 pipe revolver. 
---
Beyond that, have fun and explore and don’t get too hung up in trying to get highs level. You will be there soon enough.
---
I got an I2525 lever action rifle. Not from the Purveyor, but after I spent 1000 scrip and then killed ghouls at whitesprings
---
I plan on taking rank 1 and seeing how quickly I use it up, but plan on no other food/water/healing aid. And still having the mutation.
---
Sounds convoluted and a bandwidth hog.
---
Lets see how this plays out, when you can't use vats.
---
I don't think I've literally ever made a gating laser to have been able to find this out!
---
How do you actually get the plans for that? I've been goofing around with PA on my alt and could use the cores (meanwhile my main has no use for them and far too many, and I'm too lazy to transfer them between characters)
---
At least for me when I went to queen below level it was to steal exp from trash mobs to level faster, and I doubt they would lower SBQ’s level as it’s meant to be a server boss not a player one
---
The damage difference would be due to the Exploding secondary effect. 
---
Yes you can get QE handmades.
---
sweeeet, thanks. the first one had some nice things to offer, here is to more fun stuff :D
---
Hmmmm.. I didn’t test that but I believe it infers to if one character has maxed slots unlocked, they all do. I don’t think they are accumulative. Ie 4 level 50’s doesn’t give you 4 unlocked slots, I believe they would all have 1 unlocked.
---
So the way legendarys work is there is a main prefix, like furious, berserker, ect, but theres also a secondary prefix, explosive ect, and a third prefix, so that means explosive is a secondary prefix, which would allow for Quad Explosive stuff
---
You'd be unable to use them for 15 more levels still.  
---
What are you looking for?
---
I got a BE 25 lever action , a AA crit + per handmade , and a bunch of garbo on top of that .
---
Has it been confirmed that fallout 76 will be on ps5?
---
Good luck :)
---
Yes I hate it immensely.
---
I would like to think there will a definite feeling for the lower level players that, as per your example of being at the SBQ fight, that they might be out of their depth running around with pipe guns, a couple of leather armor pieces, 10 stimpacks, and 50 bullets. 
---
'How do I survive in this?'
---
'You'll need gear suitable for it, buddy' will be the common reply.
---
I've heard that the alien blaster is getting a damage buff, but it's not a huge amount of damage, so it'll still suck. I loved using it in Fallout 4 I used it frequently
---
So you are saying they are down?
---
Why can't i log in ?
---
Yeah I've heard a 30% damage buff but really that's trivial. 30% of such a low base damage number will only buff by a comparatively low number also.
---
As far as i know ps5 should be retro compatible. So you should at least be able to continue playing. Maybe without 60fps,raytracing,orbital lasers,and sonar freezing,but like we do now.
---
Oftentimes those lower level players you see are alts from more dedicated players, or people that don’t care quite as much about narrative as they do about being involved in large events. 
---
To your question though, as far as I’m aware, there won’t be scaling down of enemies for low level players, but rather a scaling up of enemies for higher level players. So low level players will be receiving a form of “damage boost” against mobs to make them more viable against enemies. There’s a lot of math involved but overall it’s essentially gonna make it more rounded out for high level players because they’ll start finding high level mobs everywhere (great example being the liberators outside of Vault 76), but lower level players will still be able to do noticeable damage to these mobs
---
Oblivion &gt; Skyrim. There, I said it
---
I saw a level 10 at the SBQ today. After he went down 2 or 3 times nobody bothered reviving him again. A lesson learned for that player perhaps.
---
Why can't I log in?
---
Unnecessary panic buying is unnecessary panic buying anyway you try and paint it.
---
The majority of low levels you see in high level areas are most often alt characters of someone who has already had one or more level 200+ characters so they probably aren't missing out on anything.  I've gone to scorched earth with a level 2 before because a nuke dropped the second I stepped out of the vault on an alt lol.  No chance I would get rewards but I'm sure someone was entertained by the level 2 whacking the queen with a machete.
---
Around 3pm
---
Should be 3pm. i reckon it'll be a good 4-5 hour of downtime like
---
Only legendary perk slots are shared between characters.
---
All the rest:coins,upgrades, are locked to that character.
---
Good work. I love all your ideas.
---
However I'm going to riot on your CAMP until you add the EYEBOT.
---
You’ll lose at most 1 from some stats. Strength suffers the most with up to -3, depending on how many mutations you use. But as stated run herd mutation and form a group. Even solo you’re ahead by miles.
---
I'm bloodied and I have no issues, maybe take more survivale perk
---
so like if you've got say, +50% sneak damage and +100% instigating damage, you now do +150% bonus damage when sneaking and instigating instead of the +200% you'd get if you multiplied +100% (i.e. 200%) and +50% (i.e. 150%)?
---
Dont forget about the entrance inside Whitesprings!
---
My cousin got a box of switches for Christmas one year.  My uncle is an asshole.
---
Any 3rd star is a better bonus than no star imo. There are probably a couple of occasions where i'd accept a 2 star.
---
Patch 22 drops later today so there’s gonna be some shifting around of what’s considered an “optimal build” as players figure out what has been nerfed the most. Overall though, the Legendary Run provides a pretty fun way to have specific goals daily with some okay rewards. New content should also be dropping soon with a BoS quest line being added, as well as Daily Ops to allow for more endgame content, so stay tuned over the next couple of days on the Reddit page to see how stuff balances out (also be prepared for a lot of rage as people’s builds get significantly nerfed).
---
Ammo factory. I will defo be making the switch to ultracite
---
If you've got 1 character at level 300, this opens all 6 slots that all characters will have access to, however the perks themselves are per character. 
---
So if you upgrade Ammo Factory for example, only the character that did it has access to it. As you can probably guess at this point, the game just became a bit more alt unfriendly if you actively play an alt.
---
Perk coins are also per character.
---
999 bugs in the game,
---
999.  
---
Take one down patch it around, 
---
1287 bugs in the game.
---
Sounds like a clumsy set-up to me. Why would I do it when I can build a fusion generator nearby to supply the power?
---
Locking out for 24 hours for using a mechanic in the game is extremely harsh. Especially as so many lock boxes can make you wanted for being within a claimed workshop or camp border but give no indication that it is owned.
---
Rose is actually one of my more liked voice actors in the game but repetition kills everything. I mean, after all
---
*Finally, somebody with the guts to help...*
---
Weight reduction perks are capped at 90%. Can’t get any higher.
---
So is consoles down as well?
---
Sounds like a grand old time, thanks for your comment
---
Yes that .50 cal is magic, any weapon with bashing damage has the potential to be magic if the effective fire rate is over 200 or if it's a shotgun 
---
Two shot is generally worse than bloodied and junkies because it was nerfed a long time ago 
---
Quad is a primary effect, explosive is a secondary effect - so yes quad explosive can happen
---
I am selling my flux at 400 piece and they get sold really quickly. They used to be 250 and used to disappear out of my vending machines a few minutes after putting them in, so I bumped up the prices and people are still willing to buy
---
Ward doesn't have a 5-iron protruding from his skull, does he?
---
Being ona team isnt a problem for me but thanks for the insight on the other. Ill think on it and see what data and info comes to light after it all goe slive before I decide once and for all
---
I personally get the vibe that pets are gonna be more cosmetic than anything. They “might” be capable of attacking but I don’t expect any amount of damage significant enough to really be a game changer of whether you have a pet following you or not (unless Bethesda accidentally creates magical pets or some such)
---
I don't play bloodied, just total unoptimised 'food build' and I don't find any enemies to be bullet sponges\* in particular.  
---
\*by bullet sponge I take it we mean, takes so long to kill that it gets boring, some enemies take a while to kill but not so long it gets boring, I always have the option to switch to a more powerful weapon but have to weigh that up against how quickly it will burn through its ammo leaving that weapon unavailable should a more difficult enemy come along later.
---
Those who are bloodied are going to notice the drop more than the rest of us, though none of us are getting out of this one unscathed. We just have to adapt and move forward with the changes, perhaps they'll change things again down the line if it's not working out.
---
I run a junkies build though I kept the Final Word from my AA days and last night I got an AA gatling plasma, not the best rolls on it at all but it's so I've got something as a backup if I need it.
---
I found a bit of instigating unarmed pieces that I might try.just dont like the odds of the mobs always being full health
---
I grabbed my plans from player vending machines, they where in the loot pool for holiday gifts so plenty are around, maybe join the market place sub and out a post up, someone might give you it for free.
---
I think a factor that some ppl miss is that the rebalance is a first iteration. The new dmg calculations will allow BGS to make future balancing of weapon dmg output and incoming player dmg to be more consistent and easier. Hopefully future weapon balancing will make things like rifles more viable. IMO all weapon classes should have a few weapons that have equal dmg output/dps so you can be a heavy gunner/commando/Melee and achieve the same output/experience in your preferred weapon/build choice thus removing a lot of the “meta” builds, allowing for different, but equally viable plastyles
---
Good idea to check first. Rock Band + PS3 is pretty much why I stopped buying consoles. My band had a jet and the lead singer was just breaking out with his own career, then the yellow light came and they were never seen again.
---
No he's taking the piss because in about 3 hours this sub will be flooded with posts asking if the servers are down and how long for. 
---
We get the same stupid people asking the same stupid questions every time there is an update.
---
its pretty obvious you've never used windmills before if you have to say "sounds like" when you're taking a guess at the setup.
---
dude are you even able to build windmills? 
---
If you don't show me a camp with 3 windmills by the vendors then I won't believe whatever you have to say.
---
You wanna know what's satisfying? An I/50V/25 Lever Action Rifle with Adrenaline, Gun Fu, Grim Reapers Sprint and Better Criticals
---
You wont be able to use a card slot if you are at 15. But if you assign a card, it will show 16 in that Special in the pip boy.
---
It’s already been in the game as a rare drop from the vault raid while that was still active. That was just the suit itself but at least now we can craft it
---
Am I amazed?
---
Fusion Cells, 5.56, shotgun
---
Rockets/40mm grenades don'T even sell for 1 cap each xD
---
Fusioncores got around for 150 each after a while, but I don'T think I'll be selling any more since I got a double magic gatling laser
---
Am I Amazed? (Yes)
---
Went to a camp that had nothing but displays full of garden gnomes at least a few hundred . There’s some wacky camps but hats off to that guy had to take some serious ocd to track down that many .
---
its gonna be a pain for me cus i dont do a optimal build, i do an alrounder build so i can use all weapons without issues, however i have prepared by saving up like 30 level ups so i may have to use a more boring build but whatever
---
I didn't realise that's what survival chem did, that one may have potential now for freeing up a stack of weight.
---
O’ moth man O’ moth man, your words always wise
---
I feel wisdom in me when I look in your eyes
---
I’ll stand tall in your name, power armour all muddied
---
For this game is now more than unyielding and bloodied!
---
Wait for it to actually start
---
For What to start?
---
Just wait for the update buddy..the new season isnt up and running just yet
---
The legendary run...
---
 accidental 5 story high Deathclaw standing over Deathclaw island like Godzilla 
---
Would honestly like to see this...
---
That is a little freaky looking
---
I feel as though at least with a nerf to bloodied builds, we'll get less whiny people on this sub downvoting and complaining that that have to read the posts of people who are 'playing the game wrong'. Everytime I see someone talk about their 'food-build' it always has a load of downvotes and salty comments from people who are put out that they just had to read someone saying they play the game wrong and like it.
---
The last legendary run finished last week. The next one starts tomorrow. You’re in the dead zone at the moment. Just wait.
---
Woahwowowo hold up. The season hasn’t starter? Wierd... why’d they put it in the game before it hasn’t even started?
---
Bruh What
---
You just missed season 1 which ended a week ago, and season 2 starts later today!
---
LEGENDARY RUN HASNT STARTED YET SO THERE ARE NO SCORE GIVING CHALLENGES
---
Ok I obviously do not know how this thing works. Gotta get lectured
---
Oooooh alright. Did I miss any possible rewards by not doing season 1?
---
The 1st one is over the space theme later today we should get a new one..we all start over
---
Ok chill bro. Thanks for da help
---
I would just mute my entire game when she started talking. 
---
What we need is a quest where we can dismantle her, bolt by annoying bolt.
---
damn I want to bring my level 21 friend to beat the Scoarchbeast Queen, while I'm level 238 lol
---
Gotcha. So the ”captian cosmos” one was the last season which is over now? Did I miss my oppertunity to get the captian cosmos rewards?
---
Good idea, added it xD As a scout.
---
Wait for the season to start...
---
867-5309
---
They have said in the future they will make any necessary buffs they can to make those other legendaries viable so hopefully we see a bit of a meta change in the next few months to spice things up
---
Haha when talking with friends about what games we're playing at the moment, I'm always like.
---
Oh right, now I'm playing Flight Simulator, Fall Guys, Satisfactory and ^(Fallout 76)
---
Is this permanent ?!?
---
Yes, all the cosmetics
---
Oki
---
i just spammed my explosive instigating double barrel at one for 10+ shots at the legs and nothing, very hard to actually cripple for some reason w/ that weapon
---
Goddamn that sucks. Oh well
---
A few cosmetics, but the major items like lunchboxes, chicken coop, and ammo convertor will be available as gold bullion purchases with today’s patch!
---
Fantastic!!! Thanks for the help :)
---
Lol you think they can not just change them back to 5.56 or something, you mad lad.
---
I wish I could find &gt;1 star Quad DBs ;~;7
---
I think there's limits to how low an enemy can level to
---
Hopefully there's also a limit to how high an enemy can level to because I do not want to see level 170 molerats
---
Roses are red
---
Violets are blue
---
This Patch will suck
---
you know it too.
---
Indeed! Bravo! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
---
Hats off for this post! 🙌
---
I want a Behemoth Barrage event, on any nuke event a huge version of some of the more interesting creatures could spawn. A Snallygaster the size of a football field, an apartment building sized Yau Guai, a Mega Mole Miner. With everyone having to cripple or concentrate on specific sections of them to dispose of them. Car sized Ants, Bloodbugs the size of a small plane, even a blimp sized Bloatfly.
---
A guy waved me over to his shop and sold me a BE+p handmade. I was in shock. All I could manage was a "bruh tyty" lol
---
Word on the street, I am a console player so no pts for me, charisma points assigned via the legendary perks do not allow you to use them to share peek cards. You could avoid that by just respecing regular points into charisma and making the other special stats up somewhere else.
---
Beth:  "Nope!"
---
&gt;Just because I’m thinking outside the box.
---
Really dude? 
---
I guess that business cliche a day calendar is really working out for you. 
---
You're giving it 110%, pushing the envelope to take it to the next level with your blue sky thinking. Such paradigm shifts are too win-win for us mere mortals. Going forward, let's circle back, drill down &amp; run it up the flagpole. Let's touch base soon.
---
Don't forget to grab the gun off the corpse near the vault before you leave ;)
---
For an off-beat recommendation: It turns out shotgun builds are really fun, especially if you can get a quad ammo capacity double-barrel.
---
Shotguns have a perk that increases limb break chance by a lot, which means you can do stuff like break the legs of melee enemies, making them have almost no way of hitting you, or even take a headshot at an assaultron to get rid of that annoying as hell laser beam they have
---
Shotgunner has turned me into something of a support player in the multiplayer boss event A Colossal Problem, where I mainly run around dealing with the adds by breaking their legs so the real damage dealers can focus on the boss itself
---
Is it going down at 3 or is that when it will be available to download and install at 3
---
Srsly.  I don't even get the rationale behind doing it that way in the first place.
---
They’re common enough, so I’d just drop em
---
I'll bet you can't play on your phone. Phone would overheat and your battery would be dead within an hour anyway. You can Bluetooth pair controllers with phones tho, I used to do it for playing galaxy on fire 2. Even that used to feel like my phone was able to cook eggs on during a half hour bus ride. Stick to your usual method for fallout dude
---
Seems like a lot to waste without offering.
---
exact same thing here. really looking forward to read all kind of reports here during the smoking break :D
---
If on Xbox I'll gladly take them later 😊
---
Yup, and it was polite of you to offer! I’m just saying they’re common enough that if you drop em I don’t think people will be too hurt
---
Oh my god I just launched a nuke, why do they do this. They should've told us, I wasted a nuke!!
---
Should be going down at 3 (just googled it and it may be 2 though. 4 hour difference it seems) and then not sure when the update actually appears.
---
Both i think. But not sure.
---
Well, we can't have that.  We have to pwn the bloodied players and laugh about it.
---
Hi amazed. I'm dad!
---
All the legendary options:

---
A loss leader! This player is playing 3D chess while we're playing checkers up in here.
---
I am indeed. I'll hold on to them for ya. Just shoot me a chat later.
---
Just a side note that your phone isn't running the game, it's streaming the game being run elsewhere. I've played a bit of Sea of Thieves with same service and while it definitely tanks battery it didn't feel like it was causing my phone to overheat or putting any more stress than usual on it. It also ran really well with xbox controller bluetoothes. That all being said, the novelty wears off very quickly and Fallout would suck because of all the tiny text involved.
---
MVP was the quad/33 **and** 40bash combat shotgun. Two major modifiers on the same weapon must be cool
---
I'm just going for the Ammo one because I want to play with a plasma flamer and even with that it's still probably not possible, nor good, but I do want to try.
---
12 hours
---
Bro where my rad toad.  :(    
---
Mine finally died after months when I turned off pacifistic and forgot to turn it back on
---
100 is max
---
Just explore and do whatever feels fun.  First 50-100 levels are 100% the best part of the game.
---
Its happened twice in the last two days for me
---
Why would you have max gold???
---
That was such a sad episode of "Behind the Music"
---
Hey guys I found a new game breaking bug! Something something error log in time out and some nerd language about maintenance! I NEED THIS UP ASAP! ANY WORKAROUNDS TO THIS BUG?!?!?!?
---
/s
---
I have several I built up for myself I’d straight up give you. What platform are you on?
---
Don't shoot the first player you come across. Most of us are happy to help out newbies, but you can bet your ass off the first retaliatory shot to the face will kill you and they'll steal the scrap you have collected since you left the vault.
---
Seriously, I love this community. Since I got back in the game with a new character recently, I've not found a single dickhead. Everyone seems to want to help out in one way or another
---
Yeah love your attitude - it’ll probably suck but I’m going to do it anyways 👍👍👍👏
---
I love it thanks!
---
The lore implications for this would be crazy
---
If you need build advice check out AngryTurtle on Youtube. He is the best in my opinion as he actually tests everything and shows you the results. You can search his builds like rifle sneak and heavy gunner are probably the two most popular.
---
sorry my bad. reduced weight
---
It stacks? I dont use PA and hate to use hazmat and chinese stealth, so could it be viable to use radshields in blast zones?
---
308is my best seller by far,45,5.56,5mm,50.cal in that order for me.
---
Adrenalin broken again to make the nerf more nerfy.
---
No way!! I've been playing solid the last fortnight and had never heard of this. Good call. The tooltip says you can still be 'murdered' by other players tho
---
Perhaps the fast travel bug will accidentally get fixed...
---
I honestly think mutants should be removed and replaced with something that rewards you highly for NOT being mutated, because frankly how many people dont have like 10 mutations?  I think mutations are essential to my experience right now.  I switched to an old character for a bit without speed demon, or kangaroo (wtf ever the jump one is called) and it was pretty terrible.
---
Daily Ops awarding the wrong rewards, or an absurdly inflated/deflated drop chance of certain rewards.
---
Legendary Perks unequiping themselves.
---
A base game quest is obstructed by a broken button prompt. 
---
Some legendary effects may not work as intended again.
---
After picking up no less than 4 ghoul slayer gamma guns...I just kind of give up and hope someone is selling something useful in a vendor somewhere.
---
Reading about players who get these incredible weapons (TSE Fixer??? REally? bugger off), I figure I'm just fueling their finds by using up all the bad luck for them.
---
Mwahaha I'm in
---
What time will the servers be up?! /s
---
&gt;And don't forget there's probably someone that's after what you just got
---
You want to see the shit I've been rolling, I'm surprised the legendary exchange machine hasn't just spat them back out in disgust.
---
What happened to my Seven Star Bloodied Shaft of the Ballsacker? It's been nerfed to all hell!
---
I'm playing heavy without mutations and i'm having a blast. It's mostly for RP tho. How about damage +25٪ but -5% for every mutation? Let's call it "Purist"
---
The biggest issue, especially if it looks like everything should line up and place the camp, is that people often place benches and decor overlapping tiles (putting a picture between 2 Windows) and the camp thinks they're overlapping, floating, needs support xyz
---
Instead of T-posing enemies, they will now do Michael Jackson's Thriller.
---
I sell serums 300 each no more no less. I saw some for 10k each yesterday, I dont usually use my mic often but I to say to the player his prices are dog shit.....
---
Ive wanted to main a flamer or a cryolator from day one but it just isn't possible, im kitted for single shot rifles, and I hear they are getting massively nerfed so figured now's the time to switch to commando and try the flamer dream again, heh.    
---
Just need to figure out a good copper farm really.
---
What's the rendering like on those games tho? I'd imagine playing on a tablet would help with text size, just don't see that their processor and ram could cope the same way a console or pc can.
---
So essentially your device is a second screen? I've not looked into it myself. Phones are phones and TVs are for gaming in my opinion.
---
I have another. 2 or 3\* buried in stash. I love shotguns. will check after update and let you know. will take caps. am on XBOX
---
Or if you have watched Angry Turtle on youtube you'll see he tested each new legendary perk and showed us exactly how each one works. I know for certain 2 ill max out. Might be something fun for you guys to do while we wait the 3 hours or so for the game to be patched.
---
So T(hriller) posing?
---
Australian here and i do the same. I come here first to see what kind of shit show to expect lol
---
"Little Soho" as in the Soho area of Manhattan?
---
Moon light is only reflected sunlight so....
---
It says 10am PDT so for us that means maintenance will be 3pm, expect it to be up around 7-8pm, 6:50pm if we’re all really lucky.
---
Well...technically I think they're correct - but only in one or two very specific circumstances. It requires a bloody build with absolutely every single possible thing stacked on top of it...to the point of doing thousands of damage per shot with an automatic weapon. With that many effects they have crammed in, going from multiplicative to additive could see a drop of 80%....it still leaves them by far the most powerful build/weapon in the game that can do short work on just about anything though.
---
I think the biggest problem is no one looks at it in context, and it's certainly not 80% on anything but a couple of very specific cases which tend to abuse the system a bit. It's definitely a needed patch that I hope will next lead them to start improving the damage for things for the rest of us non-bloody builds so we can at least be competitive. Bloody builds have such a huge advantage across the board that I think the constant drive to make it just a bit stronger really led to it's own demise.
---
28% sounds like a lot, I threw the dense mod on by level 40, and it turned scorch beast shrieks into annoyances rather than "run for cover!" Moments
---
I can help you get rid of them. What platform do you play on and what is your in game name. I sure hope Bethesda is watching this thread. \*wink\*
---
Yes you are an asshole cheater!!
---
I think so.
---
Last minute change trying to fix magic guns makes everyone deal zero damage.
---
Probably but who knows, it would be a nice touch if they had passives too, like backpacks for example.
---
You guys are like an assaultron with a charger head, You are going to explode.
---
No camp space but nice idea  put out all 98 magazines,teddies , mr fuzzies then look at ur camp budget.
---
i feel any "live service" games that are still live will be playable on ps5. may not have any "enhancements", but i cant imagine why they wouldn't be playable.
---
I really like your idea with executioners/instigating
---
Big tips would be to not underestimate INT, CHA, or LCK
---
INT raises your xp gain, so it's extremely helpful for leveling faster which is useful early game. You'll want at least 5 INT to be able to equip perks that let you make higher tier weapons and armor (it's fine to swap crafting perks in and out as needed). 
---
CHA lowers NPC's stock prices and raises how much caps you get selling to them. You'll want at least 3 CHA so you can equip max level Hard Bargain (makes NPC bartering even better for you), Inspirational (up to +15% more xp when in a group), and the ability to share 1 point of perk cards with other team members.
---
LCK is a bit more complicated and you can figure it out later if you need to. Extremely good perks include Super Duper, which gives a chance to make twice as much of something when crafting *anything*, as well as the mutation-related Class Freak and Startched Genes. Those two don't become available until like level 32 but mutations are a really fun mechanic once you get used to them and learn their quirks. Lets you have abilities like an always-on super jump, for trade-offs that can mostly be negated with Class Freak.
---
I also mentioned Teams. Fallout 76 has public multiplayer teams and you may feel daunted by joining strangers, but they're usually really chill and the people you run into on them rarely have specific expectations of you. Public teams also have bonuses for being on them, which makes them very helpful outside of the perks that relate to being on a team. With the update today the recommended team type will be Casual, which will boost INT and thus xp gains (it was called Building until today)
---
There's probably infinite things I could think to tell you, but I will leave you with one last beginner tip: Check suitcases at train stations. It has become community standard to drop off unwanted items and plans in them so that others, especially new players, can potentially find something they want.
---
I rock Quad single actions.  They're fun and hilarious in certain ways (Quad, + limb damage + Less AP cost = Leg Breaker;  So much fun to break the legs of every member of a pack of ghouls, then break their other legs...) and, well, my pistol build is 150, so its possible to use them, but unless you're just plain mule-headed about it, there's a lot of better weapon systems out there.
---
Yeah, that would definitely be nice if they had a small carry capacity for the pets. Who knows though, cause Bethesda hasn’t really added any base level storage upgrades since the boost in stash up to 800 pounds
---
Yeah I know but I just would like to see them tie in things like Armor Ace into the world.
---
It's okay but only as a last resort. If you had a larger screen Android tablet, I could see the appeal. As others have said, it chews through your battery and isn't great for games with text or smaller details.
---
Like how they said they would do it on ESO? I’m guessing so but probably not as a full fledged “PS5” title but an upgrade like Bungie did with Destiny, at least that’s my guess? Once they get enough people onto next gen, my guess is that they will no longer support future content on current gen. just my opinion and I’m more than likely.. hopefully.. wrong, and that support will continue on current and next gen as long as Sony allows it to be supported.
---
Ha! This is gold!
---
Yes you did sadly. Some will be for sale for gold bullion, but you missed the majority of rewards.
---
Why I hate/love update days. I get to read things from stupid people, however I lose brain cells
---
Agreed, this is exactly what I want when I come to this sub!
---
Omg this is just getting ridiculous
---
I think the biggest factor in playing well and smoothly is a stable and fast internet connection. Again I can only use SoT as an example but the front load in to game and respawn from death load times are actually faster on my phone than they are on Xbox one S using same router and Fibre Optic service.
---
?
---
I predict an increase in deaths after patch.
---
Some perks card will stop working.
---
Some or all legendary effects,will stop working.
---
Someone will magically receive 5000 perk coins for no reason.
---
And obviously it's not a season without the petulant beggers whose challenges resetted.
---
Love your focus , I’m bloodied explosive commando non food etc as I hate crafting and food maintenance, and explosive because I have wanted a fairly high intelligence for score xp, I’m never giving up bloodied / the unyieldings too good but I fancy being able to mess about with shotguns &amp; guerilla etc from time to time. I’ve respected before a few times ( luckily nothing wasted to many cards ) but I really need to put some thought into my whole builds synergy and work our what balance suits me between quality of life and high damage. With the nerf aswell as the leg. Perks this adds a new dimension, am I better with the extra special points perk so I can equip extra  perks cards I own or ho for the enhanced type new legendaries , plus with the nerf should I drop certain cards or reduce their levels and increase others etc , etc . If you think this reply is a mess, it’s nothing compared to what’s going on in my head 😂 so I’ll put some thought into the balance I want and use other peoples experiences and some of the number crunchers players to pull it all together
---
Is that for all platforms?
---
That sucks :( oh well that’s life
---
I do find myself answering them with the word Google a lot of the time now.
---
they changed that, im pretty sure. it used to be pacifist only kept you from "fighting back" and initiating "non-murder" pvp. so many people complained about getting killed when they wanted nothing to do with pvp that they changed it so you dont deal OR recieve damage from other players. though there have been workarounds.
---
they should really update that info card that pops up at level 5.
---
Right now it is just an item. You can at the moment buy it from any player selling it on their vendor. I am unsure of price.
---
Yes but it seems to be a rare drop so expect it to be undignifyingly expensive
---
Yeah lots of people are selling the helmet (not a plan). Check the market subs. I think the avg price right now is 5k-6k
---
I dont think it has a plan
---
It’s not a plan, you can only get the helmet itself. It’ll probably start popping up in vendors soon enough.
---
There isn’t a plan; just the helmet. But yes, it’s able to be dropped and given to people.
---
There seems to be max level depending on the zone, my camp is in the forrest and I got attacked by level 50 SMs/robots several times on PTS. Bad enough as it is with the borked turrets.
---
They stated in one ot their videos that enemies will have a minimum, as well as a maximum level cap depending on which area of the map they are. For example the Bog will remain very challanging for low levels.
---
Pc, but I appreciate the care &lt;3
---
I never thought of that 🤣
---
scrap and store all junk, all the time, to prevent losing it upon death. nobody will have sympathy for you if you came to a scorchbeast queen fight and lost a whole day's worth of scrap.
---
and if you arent using it, bulk it and sell it. it frees up stash space, and gets you caps. plus, nobody needs more than 100 pieces of wood.
---
This. I reluctantly switched to almost exclusively unyielding / bloody build about a month ago. It doesn't really fit my general play style for any game I've ever played, but I felt like I kind of had to play that way. Looking forward to dusting off my Vanguard armor and AA weapons.
---
take your time. explore. get the hang of the interfaces.
---
head south east soon as you feel like it. jump into any glowing green cracks in the ground you come across.
---
Update 22 introducing new bug where Todd Howard comes to my house and kills me in my sleep
---
Skimmed through post; didn’t see anything about deathclaws 0/10 hate your idea
---
"Finally about to log off, when in the corner of my eye I catch one last sight:
---
You have contracted The Blight"  
---
Oh my god that ending. I snorted. Bravo. xD
---
Yeah. At least you’re in time for the new season :)
---
Just sent a request anyway
---
Cashing perks in will cause players to de-level. It will say your level is what it's supposed to be but you'll start doing negative damage when you drop below L50.
---
Almost shitting myself waiting to see what they break ...
---
Legendary run was the name of the last season so it's not going to start again at all like captain caps lock said.  This season is called Armor Ace and the Paw Patrol!!  Going to be puptacular!
---
Yeeee
---
I don’t think people red the whole sentence and that why you got downvoted, here have an upvote
---
I used a TSE Handmade almost exclusively for months, and the accuracy issue cannot be understated. Unless you're using VATS all the time, it's pretty awful.
---
I already have game pass ultimate and an extra controller so I'll try it just to try it.  Was thinking it would be neat to use if I'm stuck waiting or doing laundry etc..
---
I have a galaxy tab a tablet which isnt a powerful tablet and a note 10 phone.
---
But is fallout on xcloud gonna work with my xbox fallout account?  Not sure if it will be considered PC or xbox.
---
Everyone says bloodied like it’s the weapon. It’s low health. Use low health with a standard fixer and you’ll wipe out a sb in 3 seconds in the air. Bloodied weapon is the icing on top. And it’s only melee stacking all the food buffs at low health that does ridiculous damage. 20-30k a shot. Bloodied commando with crits. All the drugs and buffs won’t do 5k
---
isnt bingo supposed to be 5 by 5?
---
You already teleport in vats with any melee, however I do think they should rework most of the effects, stalkers doesn't do anything at all on melee weapons. It doesn't extend the vats range, it doesn't increase the chance to hit because every single melee attack in vats has a 95% chance of hitting, it does literally nothing, except waste a roll and actually increases the vats cost substantially if your trying to sneak attack.
---
Thanks but I meant the abbreviations we see here like BR2525 etc.
---
No, buying more of something that everyone needs is unnecessary, so calm down. There I finished whatever this was.
---
Try anti-armor!
---
Am i banned ?
---
Hahahhaa niiice. Looking forward to it
---
Do you mean for when the whole Nuclear Fire storm would occur? I mean for Vault 51's timeline it takes place, what was it, like 2 or so years after the original day the 76ers left the vault and they mentioned it was due to the amount of nukes we had set off in Appalachia. Now granted as it technically is the future and that vault 51 is opening soon, one could argue the ability for us as vault dwellers to override this event in history as it hasn't occurred yet in the main timeline of the game.
---
As for an actual "Winter" as a result of bombs dropping, then yes, you are correct it does appear that it already occurred as mentioned in many of the holotapes, including those in the Wendigo cave which cite a horrible winter that hit Appalachia. Still though, it would be nice to see some snow.
---
Give me a bell when you're free, I appreciate it, thanks.
---
I looked in the settings before writing that comment and now again to verify. Exact words are:
---
"In Pacifist mode, you can't hurt other players and are choosing not to participate in PVP (Player versus Player). Other players can still murder you."
---
If what you're saying is correct, Bethesda haven't updated the settings page to reflect the changes.
---
I'll need to see what I actually have, but I do know I have a couple of Quad 10mm - one of which is explosive :)
---
EDIT: Would be interested in seeing your perk load out
---
I'd like a scrap box that looks like the scrapper station from Fallout 4.
---
Agreed!!
---
It is... I've sold every dupe I've gotten for 10,500 in my vendor
---
Bravo!
---
Bloodied tends now to refer to the build - a bloodied build is a low health build using a bloodied weapon, and yes a bloodied weapon is a big help as it adds what? 80% weapon damage? That's a big jump...now add all your other multipliers on top.
---
Just having a low health doesn't actually do anything unless you have everything else to go with it...it's a package deal.
---
Why sneak then? That is one of the most important abilities especially for low level players. If sneak is taken away, weapon damage nerfed, it's time to move on to another game. Geez...I bet that SS camo UA still isn't fixed.
---
yup because it not only takes longer to kill something but you also have to farm more materials
---
Sausages won't spawn in The Chow Line
---
The quests are worth it yes, but Daguerre's is mainly quests that put you up against robots, so prepare some Troubleshooter's gear and/or a shotgun to use the Enforcer perk with to disable those nasty assaultron lasers.
---
Both Daguerre and Beckett award unique 3* legendaries at the end of their quest lines (an alien blaster for Daguerre, .50 cal for Beckett) and Beckett's also awards a cool Blood Eagles jacket.
---
After their quest lines are done, or if you use one of the three non-quest companions, you can get daily quests from them that reward scrip and I think occasionally legendaries? But imo the main draw is the unique content to the quest lines, and if you don't like the noise they make it's fine to get rid of them afterwards.
---
I’ve seen this done for destiny and now fo76, I MEED MORE
---
I’ve said this last night. I’m on Xbox insider program so I had access to the xcloud preview and also streaming preview. Streaming preview just streamed from my Xbox to my android and it was ok but I had a galaxy phone. So it’s nice but like others said it’s a last resort. Now if I go get a huge tablet I could do it. But I guess best place for me to get most out of it is at work if I wanna hide somewhere and play a little. Lol
---
Code from 2011? We got an optimist here.
---
Such a lovely place.
---
We already have assaultrons thanks
---
It took me about 54 days to max out with both.  I don't remember how long each one individually.  However that was doing the dailies (with extra rep turn in), doing the meat turn in at Ohio River and doing Davenport's daily for extra rep.  I did them every day.
---
I like your ideas!
---
I think for starters though just the pets you tame should be respawned by repairing their food dish. Maybe they are just camp companions.  I'd be happy with that alone.
---
Gun's haunted
---
Is this the last day people ask this question? I hope so.
---
I appreciate this. Thank you.
---
I like her voice.
---
Oddly passive aggressive, but okay. I suppose it'll do to help let people know. :P
---
haha imagine the respawn bug getting fixed
---
1. 30k caps for god roll is a steal 
---
2. there will be no new meta :V some of the prefixes will be viewed as better but nothing more then that 
---
3.market wont tank anything there will be increase in demand after people find out their non meta gun do no dmg
---
I'm running t65 emergency protocols melee. I pretty much never take damage unless it's a boss or the head Lazer on a assultron
---
Sneak is still a multiplier for most (which can be anywhere from x 2 up to x 3.75 typically on rifles), but its effects like bloodied (+80% at 20% max HP) and junkies (+50% with the max of 5 addictions) that are being hit hard because they are now **additive**, meaning they are only applied to the weapon's base damage along with the usual +60% you get from 9 points in the weapon damage Perk cards (eg. Commando, Rifleman, Heavy Guns). 
---
You can even check on [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) as it has a toggle for multiplicative and additive calculations.
---
Now it only does 40k damage per swing wtf this sucks and now its raining right in my eye balls in a way that look like im crying
---
By the numbers, you have to now earn twice as much reputation as you earned by getting from Friendly to Neighborly: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders\_reputations#Ranks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations#Ranks)
---
Allot is always broken. Though how come the unresponsive enemy's wasn't fixed? Used to be able to blow up cars in front of the golf club to wake up the ghouls and they would all come running out at me.
---
No we are most certainly not Rose!
---
Yep and all the damage comes from nerd rage+adrenal and if your melee uny armour. Obviously that also helps with stealth and accuracy as well. You can happily run junkies or even a quad with that build and do stupid damage.
---
There's no actual game rendering on your phone/tablet, it's like watching a stream on Twitch, but with you controlling the game in real time. Your device is basically just sending controller input while receiving a video stream from the game running on Xboxes on Microsoft's cloud, so theoretically speaking, if your device is powerful enough to play YouTube videos, it should run this service just fine as well.
---
No
---
Wait, we can't swap legendary perks out? I'm glad you told me now. From what I understand the fist level of each perk is free. I was going to try them all out.
---
What's your platform? If you're on PC you can have mine.
---
The best legendary perks are the SPECIAL perks.
---
Instigating May be stronger post patch. Angry turtle had some interesting results showing that instigating was better than bloodied on 2handed melee.
---
Yes, and you probably deserve it.
---
What the hell is going on in here
---
If you're into Heavy Guns, Becket's nets a good one, IMO.    
---
If you romance either Becket or Space Lady you can get the Lover's Embrace XP buff if you sleep in your bed at your CAMP. I think it lasts an hour or two.
---
I mean, the system is fucked and you're guaranteed to get NO LOOT unless you use heavy guns or bloodied/junkie builds. I'm a gunslinger wit ha two shot plasma pistol, i lit her up the two times she landed, no loot. It's bullshit.
---
I’d say we just get a weekly script/gold cap not daily, as most folk can’t get on because of jobs/school etc and mainly play weekends.
---
anti-armor on gauss rifle is not very useful as gauss have big initial damage (and the way how DR is calculated), plus 35 level - it's a scrip material. 
---
15℅ faster crit rate is useful for VATS crit build though, with around 26-28 luck and reduced crit price perk you can do critical every 2nd shot. so it's basically build you crit with regular shots and then land chraged + critical head shot, regular shot + charged critical again (which don't miss in general). that the only way that makes gauss rifle useful on long fights IMO. for regular trash mobs looks for anything instigating especially after one wasteland lands.
---
&gt;All other Power Armor models have not only Bright Headlamps, but blue, red and Vault Boy Headlamps to brighten up the mood of this nightmarish wasteland.
---
T-65 hasn't got them either.
---
A pretty big one
---
I don't doubt you. I just don't understand why I end up on servers where nobody is launching at all, or they only launch at the usual two targets. Maybe it's my region, time zone, or platform? I'm on pc.
---
Sounds like a feature to me. Can't wait for this.
---
Sent u a pm
---
I'm only level 30 on ESO.
---
You have to spell it out cause the whole dance isn't t-posing.
---
I hope they fix some stuff that’s bugged in the game already so when I finish this season I can do something in the game that’s not still bugged from launch like all the challenges.
---
I didn't know that was the case, but oh well. Another Power Armor in need of some proper mods. Shame on Bethesda.
---
That's like saying they were never meant to be FPS because the originals were top down tactical rpg. Care to expand on your point?
---
I'm on Xbox
---
I know what you mean on my play through I switched to a legendary flamer on the glassed caverns scorchbeast at the end because I ran out of everything else and it melted her  , thought I had found  something everyone was ignoring or missing, then I encountered the lack of anmo and that it breaks so absurdly fast. So I thought the solution was buying ammo from player vendors whenever cheap and maybe carrying multiple flamer s and quick swapping as they broke so I’ve muled a few I’ve came across and some ammo but when I got into my bloodied commando with a combat rifle then handmade then fixer progression I’ve never revisited it. Good luck to you and please let me know how you get on name on here and in game Xbox Gustavo2695 👍
---
Most of the timers (scripp / gold / caps) are 20 hours not 24.
---
Bro, do you even windmill? lol. Maybe I wasn't obvious enough in my first response, so will attempt to remedy that here: What do windmills have to do with the vault-tec or fusion generators?
---
The only thing Karma was ever good for was getting a bunch of stats for sacrificing it in NV
---
And even then it wasn't that good lmao
---
I got a kicked from a server for maintenance. anyone else having this problem? 
---
Seriously would it be bad I just posted https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/ every half hour on this sub to clear up any dumb questions.
---
It’s the same. B2525 is Bloodied, 25% increased/faster fire rate and 25% less VATS AP cost
---
I hate that box so much it is so huge!
---
Really? hasn't felt like it.
---
The vendors (when they sell serums) is like selling a Ferrari.  They are the car dealership selling at 1500 caps more than the actual value of the product.  If you’d wanted a serum off a vendor, you’re spending 3500.  We, on the other hand, when selling to a vendor (the used car salesman), get the blue book value of 500 caps.  We’re the everyday schlubs selling our items on craigslist or in our local newspaper.  At best we can say our vendors are mini-tag sales. 
---
If I’m going to bother crafting serums to sell, I’m going to sell it at a price that would get me at least the price I would get from a vendor.  Personally, the flux themselves are a better resource to sell since it has more versatility to players, being able to craft their own serums (and giving themselves a chance at super duper), Radiation Arch’s, and linings for under armor.  
---
Given our max caps, and the ease in which you can get to max caps and stay at max caps (since once you have good gear and equipment, there isn’t anything worth spending caps on), I see no advantage in being faster like Toyota.  As it stands, I barely even have my vendor on, or if I do, I’m selling a couple of meh legendaries to cap me off once I’ve hit my scrip limit on all 5 characters for the day.  I can get myself back to max caps (if I do buy something or the off chance I care to recoup my fast travel costs) in a day or two of just selling purified water (which takes even less materials than helmets).  
---
If I do craft them to sell to players, my target market is players who REALLY WANT specific, powerful mutations, and they aren’t finding them at other player vendors because people sell &amp; buy them at super low prices (for some reason people buy them at low prices then turn around to sell to vendor, which is the dumbest thing you can do in terms of efficiency in earning caps)
---
I don’t craft serums to sell to vendors, but I’m not going to craft something to sell to players and then sell it for less than what I would have gotten from if I was going to sell it to a vendor. 
---
I guess long story short, I see it as 500 caps is the value. If you have a serum and you want to sell it, that’s what you should be adding to your bank account.  While selling them for less to players will let you get past the vendor daily limit, I see no real advantage to using serums as a method to do it quickly, given our cap limit and the fact there is no good cap sinks in the game.  I already have to move caps around characters to avoid going over just from doing my daily quests and selling stuff while doing the legendary run.
---
This has worked the opposite for me. Every time I didn't buy the bullion before the update, I had to wait an additional week to get it.
---
I don't know ask Bethesda hahaha. It just adds different challenges to the game that are technically optional. Their will be others that won't let you kill an enemy with ranged weapons and so on. it's random I think
---
They actually are already additive and always have been, they just have a cap of 90% reduction
---
Same here, sitting here at work hoping the day will end soon. Excited for season 2!
---
You'll still take about 10 rads no matter how much you eat but it does work in a nuke zone and can be managed. Chem fiend and first aid help. It's just more expensive as the blooming swamp plants is rng and can be tedious to farm.
---
If you send me you Mom's credit card details I can overclock your power supply which should fix it
---
Well, that and the other dangerous critters. The raiders managed to live there after all.
---
Neighborly to ally is half of the overall rep. My suggestion is to remember to take advantage of any dialog that gives you more rep, do both raider reps (Meat (use queen meat) and defending water pipe) at Ohio river, and also hit up multiple random encounter locations each day.
---
What has it felt like?
---
Pushes it all into Master Infiltrator, like a monster
---
Go to  Bethesda’s forums if you want a better chance of them seeing this. 
---
Mostly they just read here sometimes and us Reddit to see the current mood.
---
my dailys were completed when i logged in, anyone else have this?????////
---
It is.
---
Yeah thanks I’ll definitely that as I would love to know how each one work in practise , the old perks could sometimes be a little sketchy between what they say and how it applies, I read some stuff a few it’s guys posted here but wondered if bethesda would tweak anything between the PTS and the game patch
---
Over time, bloodied would still out dps an instigating melee weapon, but for trash mobs instigating is incredibly good
---
Ward will show up at my camp naked and comment on my guts being had.
---
Rad x won't remove mutations, only suppress them
---
Bug with the second Season, our ranks don't reset and so we can claim all the rewards in one go..
---
Shall we have a sweepstakes on how many posts there are that say:  
---
Are The Servers Down?  
---
I predict 37
---
&gt; the fact the weapons I think are fun are horrible to use
---
Yeah, you would think that stumbling upon a two-shot MIRV fatman and shooting 8 nukes at enemies would be the most exciting thing in the game... aaaand it's out of durability! Aaaand you're out of scrip room for the day.
---
Fallout 76 is a rare game in that it punishes you for playing it.
---
Jeez LOL  
---
How??
---
Gee man, I wish I knew.
---
Yes. During the purveyor sale I was able to move my timer reset for scripp from late afternoon to the morning. This allowed me to take full advantage of start and end day of sale with additional scripp. Each day the reset time was 4 hours earlier than the last day.
---
That’s not how it works. 
---
You can’t just put the water directly *into* the bottle. You have to bend down and slurp it up in your mouth, swish it around to get rid of the large bits and pieces, *then* strain it into the bottle with your teeth. 
---
It’s immersive.
---
Except for the 80% from bloodied or whatever from junkies, that 80% from bloodied is a big chunk when you're looking at damage while nerd rage is 40% damage. Adrenal reaction is the really big one at low health.
---
Why run a low health build and then not take advantage of an extra 80% damage?
---
And quad isn't going to help with damage - better to have just about anything else unless you're running a broadsider or harpoon gun...you know come to think of it, I'd love a two shot harpoon gun.
---
As an aside, if you had a two shot harpoon gun then put the flechette mod on it, would you be hitting (and recovering) double the flechettes?
---
The point still remains tho. Joke of a game mechanic right there.
---
I think you can swap them out but that there’s a cost of a perk point each time you do ?? I read someone say they wouldn’t be taking the ammo one because it was a situational perk but not needed out with crafting so would use up a slit they would fill with something they used all the time
---
Most of the timers are 20 hours. Pretty sure the only timer that us 24 hours is the ally daily quests - those seem to be 24 hours after you turn them in.
---
Bugs Bugs Bugs Nuff Said
---
The opposite happens when drinking toxic goo from West-Tek, wearing the CSS protects you from much of the rads, but honestly it should be the other way around.
---
Hey that's what I'm playing, a  2 handed melee stealth bloodied build  :D
---
It'd be more beneficial if they went for a weapon that had a decent perk instead. 3* is more likely to be kinda butts but for vastly more scrips.
---
This! This is what I needed to hear 🤣
---
Yeah I started bloodied about 3 months ago as a grinding alt, alongside my main. My main was a vanguard junkie Shotgunner which was super broken and couldn’t deal any damage outside of VATS. I’m glad I can go back to that main now
---
The fact that the whole world is relevant again is so exciting for me as well. I just want to walk from the forest to the giant crocodile and still has worthwhile enemies. Today it's possible.
---
sometimes longer than 24
---
Because they forgot honestly 
---
Weird thing is they had it working just fine in fallout 4 survival mode
---
Excavator is also missing them.
---
A big plot point, though, is that a lot of settlers came to WV from Pennsylvania after the war. It's specifically referenced in Foundation (I don't know if it's formally referenced anywhere else) where NPCs mention "youse" and "yinz" and "jawn."
---
Excited here too! Normally I'm off on Tuesdays but I have to go in for a couple hours today. Gonna take my console to work with me for the free internet. By the time I'm done working my download should be done and I'll hopefully get to come straight home and start playing! (Assuming the servers are back up)
---
This was amazing! Great job OP 😁
---
There are 2 reasons players use Bloodied, Unyeilding Armor and Bloodied weapons do up yo +95% extra damage. Any weapon above a 50% Damage buff encroaches on that limit and threatens to just replace the weapon meta. I'm not pro-bloodied builds, but pitching Legendary rework needs to be respectful toward the current meta and thus strive for an as needed approach and a second pass after the first to further improve what is lacking.
---
The basis for all effects should be around Anti-Armor and Two Shot, effects that have no or an upfront cost like TS' accuracy penalty. Anti-Armor feels perfectly fine as a gold standard of a legendary effect that has no cost and gives a consistent buff.
---
To repost my comments from your last post:
---
I think just the scaling from +5% to +50% would both make the effect better while not making a new meta of swaping to an Executioner's to finish off enemies and provide a generalists effect to compare with the others.
---
While on the topic of Legendary traits I am quite convinced we should have a 'Purist' prefix for having no mutations. With something like +50-75% damage on the weapons and the armor giving either +1 or +2 to all SPECIAL.
---
Mmmm swamp teeth
---
They're the ones I've mostly being paying attention to.
---
Agreed. I go loud with the same perks on one of my builds and it doesn’t compromise me at all if I’m careful. A lot of people don’t realize that though and think no suppressor = not viable for stealth
---
Instigating stealth bow with explosive arrows hit pretty hard :) Whether it does later we will see.
---
Me too, and at my age getting excited isn't a good idea! :)  
---
Sat here planning my Legendary perks and moving a few perks around..
---
Dual wielding sounds good. LMB and RMB to shoot the left/right pistol, extra damage is compensated by the loss of proper aiming. I'd use that.
---
Good. As long as I can still run headfirst into groups of supermutants and start swingin with little to no self-control, I’m happy.
---
Don’t plan on getting into the game before 9pm xD
---
Yeah I learned that from WoW. There's always a patch to fix the patch.
---
I haven't seen this glitch. Does it work with Black Powder Pistols also?
---
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ShamelessRedKissingbug-small.gif got me like
---
Was it a glitch, don't need to be so private
---
I’m not sure I’ve ever seen one lol
---
I’m really drawn to them but then perks like taking one for the team or flow through may be very useful after the nerf or for daily ops , which is why I’ll sit on my hand and wait for some real game news and peoples experience as much as I REALLY want to jump in and start playing about with them and the rest of my build, plus I’m bloodied commando and love it but want to bloodied guass shotgun might be fun to try but it’s a big respec for me as only got 1 point in strength
---
They cant detect you if they dead 😉
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/isu7u0/upcoming_fallout_76_maintenance_september_15_2020/g5bo6mv/
---
Yes. Instigating is more likely to one hit a mob than bloodied but on something like earl or the behemoth, bloodied will be better.
---
Maybe but not posting those in public as bans are sure to follow lol
---
Somebody put a mounted cat head on his wall and wrote SORRY next to it
---
It's still hours away from being released at the scheduled time
---
car sized ants. OMG. all hail the new KINGS of the wasteland.
---
For the raiders it took 30 minutes. Settlers took me longer.
---
Instigating can be good on some weapons, when it triggers properly. For example, an instigating gauss rifle headshot kills a mutant (if you sneak) without any rifle perk equipped.
---
Gotta admit I love to hate them, I always make mock faces when she speaks and I always make fun of her with friends, but it's so much fun ya' know?
---
Is it because in timeline terms, all this shit was fixed by the time we were unfrozen do you think? Lol
---
Most who run low health will also have the sneak multipliers and adrenal and tenderiser it’s the crit bonuses. Even with a quad that offers no additional damage it will splatter just about everything......edit not adrenal meant tho one in perception that goes to 5 and can’t think what it’s called lol
---
Whens it supposed to be released
---
If you're lower level and lacking good gear, I would go for two 2*. If you have some solid weapons already, then go for 3*. If you get a good weapon that doesn't fit your build, a 3* is easier to sell or trade.
---
you need to learn what cloud game streaming is before commenting on it..
---
This was really good nice job
---
Released at noon
---
I‘m new (back after the botched release) and I‘m often thoroughly discouraged by enemies in my way that almost one hit me. I already made peace with the fact that I won’t save lots of scrap until later in the game but, if you can’t finish quests and finally get some higher LV blueprints or gear, what’s the point of sinking hours into the game?
---
I don’t know how the nerf will affect me but if it keeps going the way it’s been, I‘ll put the game back on the shelf, for good
---
&gt; How does Sizzling style work with fireproof and at what levels do returns deminish?
---
I assume you have only two choices, either the interaction makes using both uninteresting (like piercing magazine + tank killer + anti-armor legendary affix) or it works flawlessly (like weight reduction armor + weight reduction cards + faction backpacks).
---
The only 24 hour ‘timers’ are the dusky resets at 8pm ET for the faction quests and the 12pm ET reset for special events. 
---
If you mean the timer for your scrip/gold/caps, you control that. The timer starts from when you first sell something to the machines or vendors. Not from when you first log in. And that’s a 20 hour timer, not 24. 
---
If you log in at 2 pm ET and immediately sell one item to the vendor who is at 1400 caps, then that’s when the cap pool refresh timer starts. You have until 10 am ET the following day to clear them out. At that point, it will reset. So you can log in at noon if you wanted and have a fresh pool. 
---
But if you didn’t turn in any Treasury Notes until, say 5pm the prior day, when you log in at noon, the Gold Press machine won’t have reset. 
---
A good habit is to do all three early on your session, even if it’s just one Treasury Note, one 1-star armor piece and one cap worth of stuff (I tend to drop off a beer to get the clock started).
---
You have more control than you think.
---
"Silencer" baby...PA Bloodied heavy gunner tank build lvl 300 is ready to take one for the team.
---
But if I have to use a Vampir heavy gun...😢😐
---

---
Think It's 5%, that is not rare, rare is more like 0,05-0,02 %
---
1 and a half hours ish
---
It’s never longer than 20, unless there is some very weird and rare glitch.
---
Ammo
---
And when you have scrapped your cards: "*hotfix 1: we have increased the amount of coins per card destroyed*". Joke aside, I'll do the same as you, save the coin and probably just take the level 1 legendary perks for now.
---
Username checks out.
---
Never realized how much of a delay it is for yall! Central time is GMT-6 and NZ is GMT+12..... so what time of day is it normally when your servers go down? Like 2pm the next day?
---
Dang...now I need to find one and try it out...that would produce SO much ammo then put it on a heavy weapon build for those times you run out of everything else - just run around shooting things and build up ammo.
---
...Jenny? ITS BEEN SO LONG!!!
---
5.56, 5mm, fuel, 308, 50 cal
---
Stuff like is is just setting yourself up to be upset.
---
This might be the greatest patch since the release of the game.
---
Sure Wastelander was good, but it didnt change the core gameplay.
---
Now we get some semi end-game content (daily ops), a new reason to really visit the whole map (one Wasteland), new upgrades and goal for our Characters (Legendary perks), and -somewhat- a soft reset for combat with the damage calculation change, which offer more versatility than before.
---
It's all good.
---
I just hope for a minimal amount of oddities, because, well... it's Bethesda so who knows ;)
---
9 am is when it is available. Then you have to download and install it AND wait for the servers to come back up. 
---
Like every other update.
---
&gt; We're planning to bring Fallout 76 offline for all platforms starting at **10:00 a.m. ET tomorrow, September 15**. During that time, we are going to perform maintenance and apply Update 22, which includes the start of Season 2, One Wasteland, Daily Ops, and Legendary Perks, as well as a number of bug fixes and other improvements. Once maintenance begins you will be unable to log into or play Fallout 76, but be sure to keep an eye on this thread during downtime because we will let you know as soon as the game is back online. As always, patch notes for tomorrow's update will be posted after downtime begins.

The save files are stored on their end. I can switch between 2 ps4s with no effort.
---
Hell no man 😁 cant even imagine
---
I already had a huge arsenal of various prefixes because of who I am as a person (digital hoarder who can't pass up a good deal). I'm ready! :D
---
You’re welcome. 
---
Wait until I tell you how Pepperoni Rolls are *really* made.
---
Damage wise, bloody deathclaw , need full set of unyielding ideally sentinel, bloody mess perk card , nerd rage , incissor , martial artist , iron fist , blocker
---
I thought it was multiplicative, which would mean 12 U.C. cores from 2 fusion cores if super-duper processes.
---
It's early and math is hard, but I think I might be right. If so that's nuts.
---
Edit:
---
...aaaand I'm wrong it is 9. Time for coffee.
---
Nice, I didn't. Been busy though gathering all I can, I even got a nocturnal ffr FR handmade lol, doubt it will be good but such a nice roll. That said I am ready, I think. 👍🍻
---
the .50 cal. is fun. mowing down enemies with the huge clip while getting feedback on controller is just great.
---
BUT my BE LMG is still the most fun to let loose.
---
Ugh this reminded me that I forgot to buy my bullion yesterday and I won't be home til after the update 😖
---
Me, stroking my Furious Mole Miner Gauntlet in a corner whilst gently sobbing;
---
"It'll be okay baby, it'll be okay. I'd never abandon you. You'll still be somewhat usable."
---
I would bet that the melee AoE perk does not work as intended if you have an instigating weapon. To verify tonight.
---
No, this is Patrick!
---
Pretty sure. Charisma seems to be the only one that isn't acting as fully intended. It gives you more charisma in literal stats, as does Intelligence so that should still do that.
---
If you need more damage stack some food, like deathclaw steak , scorchbeast steak etc, anything that adds strength and endurance
---
No, was a joke. Reddit needs a sarcasm flair.
---
Why would it not be?
---
Don’t make any plans for the new year 😂
---
But why give up that 80% damage? It doesn't seem to make sense to do everything to get to that point then NOT take one of the biggest damage boosts for being at low health. It's not about still doing damage, it seems to be more about doing as much as possible.
---
In perception? I can't think of anything with 5 levels...maybe agility? Oh, do you mean Adrenaline? That's a good one to have with any build...maybe easier now with the legendary perks to have some extra points in a stat.
---
Lol! That Nocturnal could be the new meta. 😅😅 I'm sure you'll be fine! Sounds like you've got it pretty well covered for now. I'm looking forward to jumping on tonight after work to explore and test out weapons.
---
Did Bethesda simply copy and paste all Power Armor Headlamps from Fallout 4 without bothering to make new Headlamps for the new types of Power Armor? It's starting to look that way.
---
This is what I started doing trying to make the workday pass faster
---
And why are you talking about it?
---
only melee killable enemies are killable only by rolling-pins...
---
when scrapping perk cards, only the selected card is left and rest are deleted and no points are given.....
---
most daily op enemies are auto health regen freaks and need same killing power than sbq or the new bugger in the mine....
---
I have an open challenge for both and should complete to clear them but I absolutely refuse to do even that one more time , I pissed myself off so much during the maxing grind that now I could calmly walk into both camps and go absolutely completely postal on them with my AK47 knockoff, and should bethesda ever remove their protected status this is exactly what I will do, Wade gets the first bullet - right between the eyes.
---
It's not craftable
---
Yes.
---
10 am ET is around 2 - 3am NZT depending on daylight savings, so generally getting up at 7am or thereabouts means there's usually a few hours of reviews and opinions here on reddit, and if it's  a sh!t show with the update already being pulled for tweaking, it's a bloody fun read with a morning coffee .
---
Over
---
There are no challenges since there is no season going atm. We havnt had challenges for a week now
---
The main quest is still broken! 76 is a broken cash grab dumpster fire and the Bethesda we knew and loved is dead.
---
there is no new meta
---
Thank you all for the warm welcome and the good advice, I love taking my time on new things. And I love exploring. Donatedtoast on pc, add me if you want.
---
Workshops are PvP area. I wouldn't mind killing you there
---
Whoa. Where do you get your weed?!
---
At daily reset time, don’t log in for half an hour, sort this sub by New, and wait to see if it gets flooded by rage (like it did every daily reset time last season)
---
Skyrim
---
OP is correct.
---
But if you take a workshop, you can be murdered, randomly.
---
And they can try to murder you, indirectly... I think, like if you're standing near a car and they shoot it, you can take damage from the reactor explosion, etc.
---
you should start looking into optimilised builds right now if you wont mini max your character before level 100 you can delete said character and start over
---
The second one put the fear in me 😦
---
Lol boy are you in for a treat today!
---
Ya well you've barely started playing yet them, you need to unlock and level abilities and get gear sets to actually dominate.
---
Won't make a difference, but go for it.
---
This was a great rendition af a classic. Thank you for your ti.e and effort. Its amazing. 👏
---
I love this and all of you amazing people
---
The only things that are a full 24 hours (to my knowledge) are daily challenges and ally daily quest.  Scrip, bullion, caps are all 20 hours and world daily quests (like Lucky Mucker and Vital Equipment) reset at 8pm EST
---
&gt; think people need to realise it’s not explicitly a damage nerf, it’s a rebalance.
---
well its change of formula for damage calculation which is damage nerf to everything... there is no rebalancing its just nerfing everything
---
Not weapons but spent like 25k on ammunition(.45,5.56,.50, and shotgun shells). But 3 servers, player vendors out.
---
T 60 is my favourite. Simply because I grind for the paints. at Paladin now. And that makes it special and rank higher than the others for me. I have donated full modded ultracite and X01 PA to online friends, and kept the T60.
---
May retire it when i buy EP plan for T65 and buld it. But will be bittersweet when i do.
---
Well...you can get the raw strength attribute to 20 as far as weight and damage, but the perk cards cap at 15. IMO the strength raw Special would be the only one worth doing this for
---
Literally can't effing wait, much needed imo. I'm 30 years old but feel like a kid the night before Xmas 😂🤣👍👌
---
Rad-X diluted doesn't suppress mutations, despite the description. I always use that instead of the regular.
---
I'll try to remember to look at it and edit this comment later.  I will tell you it is not an optimal loadout.  I'm not really good at min/maxing a build.  I'm sure i have all 3 pistol damage perks maxed, and probably sneak and a couple stars in in the sneak damage multiplier. anyway, i'll try to look and post something though it will likely be tomorrow.  I'm gonna be playing the new patch tonight!  :)
---
I working tonight so will be checking Reddit to see how your all doing , but day off tomorrow to play 🥳
---
Skyrim...I still play it. Awesome game!
---
I tend to always share level 3 inspiration
---
And Krakatoa, to a lesser extent. Darkened the skies for years afterwards.
---
I’m 33 years old and have a wife and 6 kids. I’m right there with you. I feel like it’s def Christmas and can’t wait.
---
Nicely done, thanks.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
It’s Reddit - of course there’s wrong answers 100% of the time to 50% of the users 😁
---
Yeah it was the dailies I was basing it on mostly.
---
It is going to be disappointing if this is still an issue.  Unfortunately I'd put money on it still being an issue.  The bug response time is pretty disappointing; you would think for a company rolling out a new battle-pass system and having a bug that fundamentally breaks advancement would get top priority but we instead got 10 weeks of "we dunno, try logging out and see if that helps" and I don't see that changing for this season.
---
It's an odd feeling. There was such a lack of any flavor to anything in the game that any personality at all seemed like life in the game...and yet, yes, i hated her...
---
she's SO WACKY AND ZANY. 
---
This game either has dead nothing no personality at all or 100% over the top cringe...
---
Damn 6? I've got 4 and that's hard enough, I take my hat off to you mate. Hard finding the time to play but I love the game if I'm honest so the little time I do get is good enough, for now lol
---
This is fantastic. This community truly is amazing
---
Fucking cry more...
---
You have inspired me to write a haiku.....
---
A Nuclear waste.
---
Of time,yes.  Yet still we play.
---
Let’s go to Whitesprings.
---
All vendors have separate cap pools for a day until they hot fix it
---
Smiley forgets to reset
---
Ward ends up wandering into Crater

Vital equipment is right beside Ward due to him being in Crater

Seems like I got your share on the 50/50 draw.  ( ಠ ͜ʖಠ)
---
Everyone’s camp get instantly attacked by level 100 super mutants
---
"So, are the servers still down for anyone else?"
---
Is it done yet?.....Is it done yet?.......Is it done yet?........................How 'bout now?..................Still down?...............
---
lol, I know the feeling. I got mostly nocturnal or assassin gear from the sale.
---
3000 script that was rolled, recycled, rolled, recycled... until I couldn't roll or recycle anymore.
---
Could we kill the pet for food and scraps too?
---
"I downloaded the update, but I still can't get on. Anyone else?"
---
I have   crap guns anyway ,  am even scared of cave crickets and level 1 scorched .  So I have to now find a BBgun  and a catapult to stand any chance in the game :) 
---
The game is already broken, but it’s a game we play daily, you can moan about it all day long nothing is going to change for the better, if you can’t stand the changes then there are other games our there to play. And before I get jumped on I know a lot of us have put in hundreds of hours and spent $$$ on it. , next month we will be here complaining about something else Bethesda has done wrong ...
---
I would recommend taking it slow, reading all the notes and terminals, listening to all the holos. Learn all the lore and stories. The game world tells a lot of stories, for instance (tiny spoiler) 2 skeletons jousting on golf carts at the Whitespring.
---
Before wastlanders people complained the game was empty, had no story, because they just ran through quest and power levelled.
---
You can get all 3 but odds are low. 80% chance for high 10% for medium and 5% for low. You can run the event as much as you want, it has a daily reset time where the event will change and you can get the rewards again.
---
I fear that the damage nerf won't be enough.  
---
I'm pretty sure I'll log in and still one shot every non boss.    
---
But I'm honestly hoping for at least 3 to 4 shots per enemy to make the game more interesting
---
To bad Tse does more damage than bloodied now
---
The legendary vendor issues me with a written personal apology for short changing me over the last few days , begs my forgiveness and gifts me a Level 300 instigating  anti-armour Furious bloodied vampires faster firing rate 50 vats explosive 25vats reduced weight solid gold Fixer with a diamond inlaid trigger guard
---
Amen to that!
---
Which Legendary perk will allow me to Jetpack the most.
---
If you have +33% vats or a certain kinds of damage reduction armor shotguns for some reason slay. You can just Google magic shotgun. I was talking about a -6 sniper for the auto combat shotgun range and I totally forgot that they are going to Nerf that
---
When does it drop?

&gt;If you comment with your ~~phone number~~
---
Nudes... Missed opportunity bro.
---
Already bought everything worth buying?  Depending on a person’s play style, they might only want a couple of things.
---
Even though it say 5rads/ sec doesn’t mean your taking 5rads
---
If that was true, spamming collect for 100 so you can bulk boil, would be 500 rads and that’s half your health bar. And that doesn’t happen, at least not for me.  
---
Thus it’s probably a display error.
---
.4% chance of three event plans.
---
What part of it? If you mean the Pipboy colours, that's just an INI tweak on PC. :)
---
RadShield doesn't suppress mutations either.
---
Are servers down for anyone else?
---
11am central.
---
The update can be downloaded now?
---
I just hit 52 after playing off and on since launch. I don't have a build for shit or gear to match but am excited for the changes. I hope that since I don't have a great build then I wont see my damaged going down much. Some mobs still tend to hand me my ass more easily than I like as it is. 
---
Leveled up as a stealth rifleman, which is the play style I always have used for Fallouts besides charisma builds which are a joke in 76.  I have looked at other builds which all seem to rely on RNG of specific legendary weapons. I just don't know which direction I should go with a build, especially now after One Wasteland.
---
Words
---
Interesting. I’ve never heard this before, nor encountered anything like that in my hand testing exercises. I’ll look into it to see if I can replicate this.
---
Any other guns you’ve seen this on? And how’d you test it, if you don’t mind me asking?
---
9am central it goes offline. Then you have to download and install the update to play it
---
That's some exciting news ! I really like that approach .
---
Yes, but it tends to be a bit pricey.  I got lucky when I found mine for 4k, I usually see them for 7-10k.
---
By abusing the hell out of every damage buff possible.
---
They dont go super in depth in the full process since these 2 guys are very much end game players, but there you go. This video was made after they had killed it in under 1 and a half seconds.

Absurd.

I keep getting an error code when I try to log in. Did I get banned?
---
Power armor works OK. Wait. WHERE'S MY FUCKING HEAD???
---
At 10. I’m just getting out ahead of the storm.
---
I want an explosive bullet gatling gun... But nooooOOOOoooOoooo
---
Wheres the thread for people being clever and predicting that others will be asking why their game doesnt work?
---
I sell them at 4.5k and still feel that’s too much. If you’re PS4 I can give you one.
---
That's simple. Depends on your progress on the game.    
---
Do you have good enough 2\* weapons already? Then go 3\*.    
---
Two stars are completely useable, but the correct third star is what makes the meta.  
---
If you are looking to trade, 3 stars always. Nobody wants a two stars these days anymore
---
If you have had chickens you will know why you get more manure than eggs.

Chickens dont lay eggs any more.... live birth, which is horrifying the more i think about it.

I picked a couple of AA weapons out as backup pieces, but I'll most likely be keeping my junkies build more or less intact.

I’m high Int as well. Trust me you’re better off cooking, either go herbivore or carnivore. The plus 25% xp and 7.5 intelligence ain’t a joke.
---
If you’re worry about Daily Ops, I switch out vats critical perks in Luck for serendipity and ricochet, and sneak perks in Agility for Dodgy and Evasive. Since there are invisible enemy, and I need to train my aim for Nuclear Winter I decide to go Vatsless in Daily Ops with second weapon. 
---
Farming wise I also decide to get the Endurance legendary for the Chem duration perk and not get addiction perk. I have over 100 berry mentats for extra 5 INT while farming xp. 
---
You’re not losing boss dps since there are more than enough perk points to put all the damage perks. Just need some perks swapping and you’re good.
---
There is that crying Japanese guy lol
---
Oh gawd, I haven’t seen her friends.
---
I can take a good educated guess at this having decades of IT experience and also having a lot of experience with MMOs. The servers come down first thing in the morning, around 10am ET. In short, they'll need to be backed up first, then the patch is applied, then the data restored and tested. The restore is what will take longest, and as long as that isn't interrupted we should be up by 1-1:30pm ET. If anything goes wrong, push that time back to noon ET. If it's still down at noon, they likely ran into serious problems (which happens ~50% of the time) or someone screwed something up (which happens ~10% of the time).
---
EDIT: I'm on the left coast and it's early so I put pacific times not eastern. That's fixed.
---
There will be reports of **a)** a duping glitch and **b)** people's items being supposedly stolen from their stash through a vendor or something, and these things will either be **I)** made up, with a (100-X)% chance possibility, or **II)** actually happening, with a X% chance possibility, where X ranges from 0 to a reasonable number.
---
Note: Definition of "reasonable" is up to the reader.
---
It will play your Xbox character, I believe because you're streaming from your Xbox.
---
I thought I was going crazy with my two shot lever-action breaking so fast.
---
Please.
---
No!!
---
Cause its actually roosters.
---
So what you're saying is that the server will be up again when they are finished with doing what needs to be done ..
---
( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)
---
Just give me your login, I'll be sure to buy them for you!
---
Today!
---
Over total but under real, a few just making the post to try to beat a dead horse
---
Sweet-as bru......
---
*Bloody Kiwis....* ;)
---
Do the enemies you kill give the ammo you use back as drops?
---
In fairness I have noticed that before when taking rad-x and farming the river, but I grabbed 20 earlier and it looks about 10% of the bar I've gone up in rads. Diluted rad-x sounds like the way to go tho
---
But they also live forever and don't need to be fed
---
You ever owned chickens? They shit like noones business!
---
Yeah when I first plAyed back during launch I just did my own thing and built my character as I did in fallout 4. Then I recently switched to a build for damage. But it’s fun and I love fallout games and can’t wait for all the new stuff coming.
---
I want a pet deathclaw...then put them in a mr. fuzzy outfit and introduce them as 'Ranger Bob'.
---
I don't know why...this just seems too funny to not do.
---
So if you run it and don't get Elite, can you try again to get Elite for a better chance at plans?
---
But you dont get any eggs. At least with the brahmin you can get milk and shit
---
I'm hoping they fix the shotgun bugs, now that I've got a nice shotty to play with.
---
With quad the thinking on Earle is that the dps is similar because of not having to reload and a constantly firing. I’m not sure it’s even close to the same as single shot is about 60%’of bloodied.  My point was everyone refers to low health as bloodied. It’s used by junkies as well as lots of heavy builds with magic guns.
---
True.
---
They make a universal tool for that, mini nuke.
---
This is just phenomenal.
---
Cause she doesn’t have guts?
---
No it's not classified as there is no reason anymore to do so. Since they removed the legendary perks that require you to wear certain types/class of armor. You only need "matching set" now.
---
Twice your age, and I actually couldn't sleep last night, I am so excited! There's something wrong with me for sure 😆
---
I wish I could play it on iPhone I’d be buying a decent controller and taking it everywhere with me. But no Apple has to be the bad guy and want money and to take up extra space on my phone.
---
We seem to be out numbered
---
And yeah adrenaline lol. Was thinking adrenal and got stuck. For the record I am bloodied commando. Lucky enough to be around at the glitch and got my 2525 fixer and handy so all sorted.
---
If you asking related to the PTS legendary perks, those have been replaced by perks requiring matching set, so with regard to SS, it doesn't matter.
---
I agree with you. I believe this is the biggest patch to hit the game at one time with the amount of stuff brining to it. Any of the three things would’ve been good to come to the game alone but we get all three and it’s going to be awesome. My camp use to be down under Welch forever until recently I moved all the way above lumber yard. Can’t wait to goto my camp and see Hugh enemies there and not level 5 protectrons. So excited, work can’t end quick enough today.
---
Scraping all the packs of cigarettes to save Rosalyn
---
Todd’s on his way to your house. Hide.
---
I keep hearing that, I’ve never watched it
---
I’m the same. I run a lumber yard but instead of getting lumber packs ready I’m going to plan my night of fallout. Lol
---
More crashes.
---
Where did my daily challenges go?
---
Yes. I was unarmed on the PTS but it seems you could use this to farm ammo.
---
None of them. Jetpack AP cost is relative to your total AP. It takes a percentage for each second you are using it. Otherwise, you'd see Unyielding people jetpack for an entire minute or more. 
---
You need to spam AP food, like Canned Coffee, Quantums, and Honey to stay in the sky.
---
Just feels like it lol 😂
---
I was clever and deleted that before even posting, because of the massive down votes I predicted..
---
Yep as much as you want.
---
I did the same thing. Logged in yesterday early just to get 3 more rolls. In retrospect I should have slept in.
---
There should be a betting system on which bugs will be brought back today. Bring out your popcorn people, I am both excited and horrified knowing Bethesda is messing around with the whole damage system and mob levels. 
---
Bring out yer dead, the end is nigh!
---
Minutes? 
---
I don’t play every dat and it’s more like months for me.
---
I'm just going to say, that I think that "someone screwed something up" is probably 20% of the time, at least! 😆
---
Yeah 6, ages range from 11,10,6,5,3,and 1. It’s tough to get time to play much. But I manage to squeeze in time at night before I goto bed before work. Or on weekends I wake up early and play. It’s good enough, thank you for your kind words and I take my hat off to you as well.
---
Yeah, gotcha... I just wish the Jetpack was more... Jetpack-y. 
---
However, regardless of AP, I've found that the framerate drops during SBQ, parts of Crater, and other low FPS areas allow you to Jetpack insanely high.
---
Whomever that guy is that copies and pastes the same reply to all the questions every patch: We need you now more than ever.
---
No. Some people will still just post about it before taking 2 seconds to check anything lol
---
DOWN WITH ROSE!
---
Well done bröthêr
---
I just started playing since Aug and this game has delivered so much content already that I can barely get upto speed! At least with the wasteland update and onwards FO76 seems like a great game and nothing of the shitshow that was declared at launch.
---
Better over/unders:
---
* A previously fixed bug will make an encore appearance
---
* At least one proposed feature expected to release with Patch 22 will be delayed by at least a week
---
* Within 24 hrs of Patch 22's release someone discovers that either an Atom Store or Legendary Run item/cosmetic will have a significant functional or graphical error
---
Yeah I was going to make a sneaky melee guy for fun, can you sneak up on most robots, including assaultrons? And can you 1 hit them?
---
Yep the eXist. Guy was selling one 8 days ago with a jeP lever and 30k caos for a BE lazer. 3-1
---
I just commented on his post if that makes it easier to find
---
I know! The quests were 90% running 10% running from a crazed Yaoguai.
---
Odd. I just tried it in 4 and it didn't work. Maybe I had a mod.
---
Intelligence will be the other one. 10 additional % of extra xp? Don't mind if I do. That's the one I'm picking up first. I guess I'll be able to squeeze about 850xp from a lvl 100 super mutant this way with my setup and that is before lunchbox buff and possible doublexp, which will skyrocket this number almost to the max xp per mob.
---
Internet hard! How google?! What YouTube?! I should go ask everyone on reddit wtf.
---
If I have Master Infiltrator maxed out and the daily challenge requires me to pick a lock, will i have to remove it to actually play the minigame, or will it complete when i interact with a lock normally?
---
That's what project managers are supposed to prevent, so as long as everyone sticks to the plan and nobody goes maverick they'll be fine. I once had an infrastructure guy take it upon himself to do some cable management while a restore was going. Crashed the restore of course and we lost 4 hours because of it. I wanted to fire the guy but the CIO liked him.
---
Within a minute of the patch being live. Swiftly followed by claims that hunger and thirst have changed and legendary spawns have been nerfed.
---
Take your time!  There's a ton to explore and get lost in.
---
Regarding other players, pvp is opt-in.  Turn on pacifist mode once you hit level 5 (it's in settings).  The community is really friendly and helpful.  If you see a high level player jetting towards you, they probably want to give you some soup and ammo.
---
Use the emote wheel to communicate!  Heart emote means "thank you".
---
You will still benefit from the 5 SPECIAL points statwise, though. So it's not a total wash.
---
I know. I’m a low lvl, 42, and I’m a stealth build with a hunting rifle. When it comes to ghouls flooding the area, I really need that one tap.
---
Ended up with a QE handmade, so I'm pretty satisfied.
---
the last camp build i did got me thinking this same question when i was placing them on a hill near my camps spawn point (i always place my scrap box on top of my stash box, to save that tiny bit of floor space.)
---
 and the scrap box sank in to the stash box only poking out the top of the stash box by a few inches... i know its some kinda bug and i should probably correct it but it looks so much better that way lol 
---
ya we need more options for the scrap box
---
Because eggs would mean the devs have to create a new food item and recipe. That’s, like, *work* man, y’know?
---
TS is only really good if it has the explosive effect in my opinion. TS has reduced accuracy, faster durability loss and the damage is being split between two bullets (62,5% each), which means you can actually lose damage when you aren’t landing both shots
---
So I played at launch and I enjoyed it. It had its flaws but I loved fallout games so much it didn’t matter to me. I played solo the whole time and finished main story. I stopped for about 6 months came back end of last year and the content they put in back then was good. I was grinding for the back pack, then better guns. Then wastelanders dropped and game changed so much for the better and now here’s another big update that will change the game to even better. It def has came a long way from launch and I’m so glad the developers didn’t abandon this game when they got all that hate at launch.
---
Here in Europe it's probably going to be back about 7-7:30pm  My wife is wondering why I offered to stay home and dog sit while she went out with some friends :)
---
yes
---
You should check out Angry Turtle's legendary perk videos, he's tested each of them I believe.
---
*googling Amy Sedaris*
---
You’re not the only one. Buncha psychopaths.
---
at least 5
---
I'd be happier with scrap boxes at all the train stations than new skins.  Yes, I could just move my tent, but often I don't want to.
---
If you have 15 str then add +5str from legendairy card you get carry weight and melee dmg and your str is listed as 20, but you can not put on 5 additional level 1 perk cards to your already equipped 15 level 1 str cards
---
You are limited to 15 level 1 perk cards although you have 20 str 
---
Hope I didnt make things harder to understand. Only using level 1 cards is only an example which I hope would make more sense and clearing things up! :) 
---
PS: str = strenght (just in case someone didnt understand! 
---
Edit: spelling
---
Lol. I love that. Good job man, I would’ve done the same. Until the wife would’ve remembered we don’t have a dog. Lol
---
I like to watch people while they sleep 😴
---
All that I know is that I'll either be in a private world or my vending won't be available, given how many times that's been screwed up.
---
I must find the fabled Bridge Binks
---
Well considering it now makes shotguns actually deal damage outside of VATS, I’d say you can hardly call it a nerf for shotgun builds, but I do see your point
---
[The tourist](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bucket_List) has a small chance to appear at multiple locations. I've found Ansel at Wavy Willard's &amp; Tyler County Fairgrounds several times, as well as the Giant Teapot once. I also found Anne once atop the Lighthouse.
---
Basically, keep an eye out for a quest to pop onto your list that says "Investgate the Suspicious Person." It might also show up on your personal Terminal. If it does, head to that spot and look for the corpse with the funny hat &amp; shirt.
---
I need to upload the photos I took at Tyler County &amp; the Teapot to the Wiki.
---
Yeah but radshield is a complete faff to make and diluted rad-x is handed out like candy from a bunch of events and dailies.
---
ew, man. bits and pieces of *what*?
---
Does anyone know if the healing/ap effect stacks for Retribution with successive blocks, or does it just reset the timer?
---
A good fit bit still agonizing.
---
Instigating, antiarmor, twoshot explosives seem to be fairing well with the change
---
Tbh if you've put thousands upon thousands of hours into this game it's no surprise you're able to melt endgame bosses. You've pretty much finished the endgame at that point lol
---
My plan is to take the legendary perks corresponding to the SPECIAL (s) that I know I'll want, freeing up points to put wherever.
---
That is very true
---
You get irradiated going into an irradiated area with the hazmat suit on. Would you expect any different when you directly handle irradiated water?
---
Great advice about perk swapping thanks very much and that big boost in xp from cooking would offset the time wasted rustling up ingredients etc, how long in real time do they keep for before spoiling ?
---
It is, and his perception on levels of historic forum outrage are distorted by his salt as well.
---
Would you... blow up a dam?
---
Because we're all experts on everything ever around here lol google ain't got nothin on us!!
---
Will do thanks
---
I use an explosive laser rifle. They crumble like rad roaches. They are difficult to see in dark areas like nuke launch prep but still go down quickly if you see them before they attack.
---
Are you *sure* you want the answer to that question?
---
Heavily armed butlers?
---
I've been hoarding crimson flux like a madman in my grind for full Raider. I can't wait to burn through it all.
---
I just wish I would have kept the full health armor pieces before going Unyielding/Bloodied.
---
Oh I know - so many different perks/mutations I forget them all the time.
---
That's nice...I don't do the low health/bloodied build as I'd never be lucky enough to get the armour for it...I just had hundreds of rolls with the purveyor over the weekend (5 characters at full scrip...so that's 100 I think, plus another few each with trading back in - okay so maybe 110-120 or so) and didn't get a single TS, or E rifle...a couple of E pistols, though all single action revolvers...I got 1 bloodied +33 +1A handmade...but of course don't run bloodied.
---
All I really wanted was a TSE, TS, or E fixer, combat rifle, .44 or even 10mm pistol...but didn't even come close. So not even going to think about trying to get suited out with armour for a low health build LOL.
---
It seems more people like her.
---
Too bad we cant get cloaking devices that work like the cloaked assaultron.
---
Heheh FIRE FIRE!!! (sorry I read your comment in buttheads voice for some reason)
---
Previously, on Reddit..
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hikot1/sticky\_are\_the\_servers\_down/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hikot1/sticky_are_the_servers_down/)
---
Mostly minor inconveniences with the occasional game-breaking bug that should have been caught with rudimentary testing thrown in.
---
Or maybe just toned down. Or not on repeat.
---
I'm guessing 250DR while reloading will be back on the shit list, but we'll see!
---
I'm sorry if this has been asked a thousand times, but I just haven't seen the answer. When we unlock all six legendary perk slots, do we have access to the first rank of every card? Or are you stuck with the six that you pick for life?
---
In other words, can you earn the base rank of every legendary perk card?
---
Most daily quests reset at 8PM Eastern. Daily limits (and maybe repeatables, not sure) reset after 20 hours.
---
As expected tho. When she announces the double cross, I just rolled my eyes.
---
My prediction that one major proposed feature expected to be released in Patch 22 will be delayed by at least a week but Bethesda won't let us know until at least the servers go offline and PR will pitch it like it was always expected to be delayed.
---
My side prediction is that this feature is Daily OPs.
---
I could care less about survival tents as I only use them for fast travel points and to dump any extra weight I get from SBQ.  So I dont really see mine enough to care what it looks like.  But I would love to see some reskins or new styles of scrap boxes.  In Ark Survival Evolved there was an item called an Industrial Grinder.  Id like to see something like this on a much smaller scale of course.   A grinder would fit right into the lore of Fallout and it has the aesthetic appearance to be convincing of something you would put items into to scrap them back into the components.
---
[Industrial Grinder](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/arksurvivalevolved_gamepedia/images/f/fe/Industrial_Grinder.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1200?cb=20160728174055)
---
A pet Brahmin would be awesome. I already have a little barn for my fertilizer Brahmin, being able to have Ms Mooey Mooersson kill the nonbelievers would be amazing.
---
Those bits and pieces from using bloody mess have to go somewhere...
---
You sir i want to play with 
---
During the chaos this new patch will bring with
---
And together nuke good o'l Earl
---
While the nerf consumes all my fusion cells
---
Damn i suck at this 
---
But seeing your post filled me with bliss
---
I won’t be able to play the new patch as off to work at 4 so Reddit’s going to keep me entertained all night 😂
---
I just need 5 pieces of Uny. 1 star is more than fine. Combat or leather helps but not critical and depending on your style sent or cav. With blocker and serendipity in fully Uny you’re reasonably tanky anyway at 19%. Give it a whirl it’s a huge difference in everything from carry weight to accuracy to obviously damage
---
Soooo throw a blocking piece back on and go to town 😅
---
....Probably not.
---
Breathe easy friend, because Rose has none, er-well they are all dead for the most part, you even get to finish the job on one of them. I meant my own friends, like when we play together and have a discord call up, haha.
---
im just cheesed off that it will likely be down when I get in from work in an hour and a half
---
Touché. I don’t know why I just started looking up sarcastic definitions of “expert”. Good for coffee reading.
---
Putting "sticky" at the front of the title in the hopes that a mod will actually sticky the post is a little ambitious, don't you think?
---
Hodd Toward wouldnt come to your house to kill you. He'd come to your house and break all your shit while shouting "IT JUST WORKS!!!!"
---
normally its due to people using the default price for them
---
I'll take a look...would be interesting to see if it worked that way as it would make a pretty scary backup weapon on a heavy build if you never had to worry about health. 
---
Plus, might be good for a queen fight - since I don't do a low health build I rarely get that high up for single hit damage and need to use a lot of shots to do much which is ammo intensive. If you were to use a flechette harpoon (much like a shotgun) you'd be scoring a large number of smaller hits at the same time which could possibly add up to reasonable damage (if I'm hitting with 10-20 hits for a few damage each that would actually be pretty good damage overall). Nice alternative to my gatling gun.
---
Or the large amount of people that start to complain about their God tier builds not doing the same damage as before.
---
I've read fallout equestria, she wasn't a raider though.
---
Truer words have never been spoken
---
What was she?
---
He hit me with that same insult.  "You have the face only a mother could love, too bad your whole family died in the great war."
---
Why would you expect it not to? 
---
It's very likely that your current PS account will carry over to PS5's online platform, and that account is attached to the Bethesda one so I don't see how it wouldn't carry over.
---
Thriller dancer ghouls would be the shit!!!
---
I’ve been lucky as to all last season I never had it happen on Xbox
---
Just to confirm: These scaled up enemies have higher experience rewards, right?
---
it's probably going to be the new meta. hop into PA with a heavy gun for bosses, sneak around with an automatic rifle for everything else.
---
but it's going to take around 4 level 3 special perks to be truly effective. you'd need to be well into level 300, 400.
---
1300-6555-06
---
Much love for the one and only real mothman, the wise mothman.
---
wait until you start trading for better gear. fun.
---
I'll take a look...my odds of finding 5 pieces of unyielding armour are slim though. For example - on one character I have a crappy right arm, just useless armour really, but so far every piece of half decent arm armour I've come across has been left arm - like 8 pieces here (none of them unyielding though).
---
the interface is terrible. i'd almost rather let it sit longer than pull it out and adjust the price again.
---
that being said all of my plans are 10c with jetpacks at 150c, with the exception of the rarer plans (the fixer, tenderizer, etc).
---
Lulz. Today is the day the game changes, again, for the what, tenth time? Nothing will change. New things will be broken, old bugs will return.
---
You know why? Because War never changes, and neither does Bethesda.
---
Did it on two characters, I just can’t bring myself to do it on a third. It’s torture.
---
Yeah, this. A lot of people just use the price Bethesda recommends you sell it for, despite that being wildly above or below what the real value is currently. I usually figure they're either new or don't have Reddit.
---
It's times like this i wish i was a mod on here.
---
If you truly feel that way then why even be on this reddit? Why even follow fallout?
---
It’s a good idea, but feeding/petting only applies to animals. Would robots require, say, maintenance?
---
Also - while I don’t have any experience with any mmo except whatever 76 is, wouldn’t having an assaultron following you at all times get in the way?
---
Then stop sucking that dead Steve jobs dick
---
I know you're making a joke but to be fair it also locks a food type/item to a fairly high (60s or 70s) tier of a now-unavailable season. It's a bit niche, unless they're just reskins of radscorp eggs.
---
User name checks out
---
Would you like to supersize that?
---
I... honestly don’t think it’s that bad. It could be a lot worse. Besides, I doubt she’ll have anymore content at this point.
---
I'm personally at 388 and will have 950 coins. I feel like I've done a pretty standered amount of build swapping and such. Probably lost a lot of perk cards to opening packs since I didn't want an extra step while moving cards about
---
So yeah, you'll need to be a pretty high level to max multiple cards
---
Depends on how hard the items are to obtain and what the items are e.g if the are high demand; overall player vendors are much cheaper and an easier way to get loot. But if it's something like a serum (usually 300-500 caps) or a wendigo plushie plan (could be anything up to 5000 caps) people may charge more. But basic items ammo, wood scraps and plans like tables, lights etc are only usually priced up to 100 caps.
---
Thank god lol!
---
burst out laughing
---
I could see that for not having to reload...but I think that for a lot of weapons it wouldn't matter too much.
---
I know most people refer to low-health as bloodied, but I think that tends to be due to the nature of bloody being such a natural fit to low health...
---
Ultimately:
---
all bloodied = low health, but not all low health = bloodied.
---
There's a venn diagram there somewhere.
---
Oddly one of the weapons I have from a long ways back that I REALLY need to try out is a quad assaultron head. My thinking is that since it allows to load 4 times as many shots into it, it could be a really scary one-shot cannon. I'm hoping the damage scales that way.
---
Soon(tm).
---
Dude I loved fallout. I played 76 for a year and a half. I stopped because I hate battlepass and season systems, I didn't want to get sucked into feeling like I needed to play everyday when I was already level 250+ with nothing left to do.
---
But Bethesda can get fucked on.
---
To be honest that’s the reason why I made that name. I had 4 kids at the time. Lol and can’t change name after picking one. So I figured I better have two more kids so I can live up to the name lol
---
they could be saving up for BoS patch
---
The point of selling serums at below vendor cost is to keep making caps after you hit the daily cap of 1600. I think you're limiting your income potential by trying to "break even" on the vendor value. 
---
People will buy from me so they can easily hit the cap by selling them for more than I charge them, and I get many repeat daily buyers on my friends list. With your price point, there's absolutely zero incentive for people to buy more than once.
---
they all generate electricity, duh
---
maybe you should actually play the game? 
---
Hope you get things worked out. I'm not going to sit here and teach you everything.  
---
Goodbye.
---
Spamming collect works again? I thought they fixed that ages ago?!
---
I already told my wife "I don't want to be disturbed tonight". She kinda said "f**k you" with her eyes, so we'll see what happens. lol
---
"I just started playing this game yesterday.  Does anyone know why its not letting me log on?  I restarted my game but it still does the same thing."
---
What would matter is it being the same bethesda.net account. If you're logging through a 3rd party, they're likely different accounts and it won't transfer.
---
16x the detail
---
It’ll be added into gold vendors
---
Will be doing this for the start of season 2, thanks for the recommendation!
---
I can’t get in am I banned?
---
And a new currency: egg shells
---
Don't get too overexcited yet.. 
---
Wastelanders was the first update that holded their promises kind of
---
If only I could be so grossly incandescent!
---
I guess this sentence was overlooked:  
---
"I'm nearly always fighting max caps. I don't need to do volume selling on serums."  
---
Why on earth would I want to sell more of them more quickly?  To shut down my vending even sooner?   There is nothing left for me to buy except the very rare plan I might find in a player's vending, and that happens nearly never.
---
People might not return to me for serums, but I often have people buying 4 - 6 at a time.  If there were anything left for me to buy, I'd be going back down to 450.  However, there simply isn't.
---
Hunger and Thirst has been changed, food is decaying faster, weapons and armor are breaking faster, fusion cores are expiring faster, legendary spawns have been nerfed...  
---
I feel like there's one more that makes the rounds, but I can't remember it at the moment.
---
877-Cash-Now
---
Are the rare plans tradeable? My luck on this game is pretty bad but I know that eventually they should filter through vemdors if they are
---
I am referring to the ladder option.
---
I don't find her too bad. The one voice I always love is Sanjay.
---
"Sanjay here!"
---
He's way too chipper for a post-apocalyptic world.
---
The popup is &lt;1 rad in those cases tho. Even fully submerged in water is &lt;1
---
At level 19 I don't have access to all the perks. Is Aquaboy/girl still a thing, or something equivalent?
---
suggested prices are stupid. don't bother reading it. 
---
if someone sells based on their prices you might get lucky and find a good rare plan buy but usually all a waste of time and caps.
---
A few things:
---
Double has been legacy for a long time now, since quad was better in every way.
---
I’d switch the name of the Slayer effect to be Purifier instead, as a reference to a perk in new Vegas of the same name that’s relatively similar.
---
Medic’s scaling to damage would be problematic since it triggers at crits. It would have to scale at very high amounts for it to be fair (and not refill you’re entire health bar with one crit, since the point is to heal you and teammates).
---
Assassin’s honestly should have a version for all humans and a separate one for players. 25% against players is honestly probably too strong for pvp. Also, it would let human killer weapons do the 50% of your other choices.
---
I find that the majority of players pricing their stuff for over 100. Like a basic building plan you get from workshops can be between 50-350 caps wich is rediciolus
---
She is involved in wastelanders, though, so he warned.
---
Twas the night before patch day
---
not a bug to be found
---
..........never mind.
---
Just because the worlds in the toilet doesn’t mean you can’t have a good day!
---
Local settings will likely have a data transfer option like they currently have when switching to a new PS4.
---
Your licenses and downloaded games are stored online, and tied to your PSN. You'll have to redownload/reinstall them but you're covered there. 
---
And finally, all of your characters and items are stored online and are tied to your Bethesda.net account.
---
So I'm not sure what you're worried about? The only potential issue will be whether or not Fallout titles will be compatible with the PS5 which we won't know until an official list or announcement is made, or after release and we get to try it ourselves.
---
Specific loot isn't dropping/crafting.
---
The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father!
---
Dead. It was two hundred years in the future...
---
Also if you take a rad x by accident, just take a diluted rad x and it will give you your mutations back since they don't stack.
---
I watched that episode yesterday!
---
There's chicken critters in the game, they could just add an option to gather eggs from those the same way you can milk any Brahmin.  Or they could just... not.  How many people do you know that have the Owlet Nuggets recipe?
---
Nah, it's 100% just because they *couldnt be arsed*.
---
I'll be taking ammo factory first for sure, followed up with What Rads. While it probably doesn't need ranked up to be fully effective, the sheer convenience of it removing rad damage coupled with healing factor will save a lot of trips back to a decon arch or needing to carry as much Radway. I suspect staying at 1 or going for 4 will largely be a matter of personal preference.
---
Master Agility or Luck will be going in there, haven't decided yet but leaning towards agility. Survival Chem is one I'm taking now too since I found out today it works completely differently to how I assumed it did.
---
Master Infilt. is another no brainer but the one that I'll skip ranking up completely.
---
Perk 6 is up in the air. It'll propably come down between Funky Duds, Reboot or Power Sprinter.
---
Well why sell any at all then, if you have no need for caps?
---
That's likely due to you "skipping" server ticks due to low FPS and lag. 
---
Are you on console? I'm only asking because that seems to happen exponentially more often on console than on PC. I've played on PC and have never actually experienced that myself in those areas, or anywhere else.

Praise the Lord, and pass the ammunition.
---
Both my heavy gun character and stealth sniper double dip.
---
Both are bloodied builds with unyielding, so they have the stats to dip into the other side. But basically, I don't really cross perk, and they do decently enough.
---
Fun fact: she is also tommy pickles voice actor from rugrats
---
I’m playing now like heavy-commando ) 8/13/8/4/8/7/8 with the same idea: pow-pow from mini or gplasma on boss events &amp; rifle to the rest of wastelands life. 
---
It works. Have to replace perks in S &amp; I from rifle to heavy guns / PA before events
---
Dream to have fast perks set-ups to swap between
---
don't know if I missed this one but the suppressor in the gold handmade skin (not the raider one) suffers from the same issue as the blood eagle skin.
---
Purifier has a nice...enclavy... sound to it, i dig it.
---
Medic's fatman is meta, no doubt.
---
25% against players is fine considering junkie's is 50% and bloodied can shoot past that.
---
Hard to say an economy exists when you can't even properly trade, neither hold enough caps.  
---
Have I mentioned there is no money sink in this game so caps are mostly useless?
---
I have, bought some nice plans for 100-500 caps, when they are worth much more than that.
---
Use. Script. As. Rolling. Paper. Smoke. Thistle
---
Back in the millennium I was working in IT for a major Bank and was paid a shit load to be in standby on case the shit hit the fan.. . Woke up .. checked what happened in Aus and went on the piss all day :)
---
So, I’ll make sure I post anything I find as a thank you
---
Hmm, could you perhaps provide a screenshot?
---
I got my [Kitchen Sink build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=aa51aaa&amp;d=x43x63x73x83x93xa3sg2sq0s31sr1sx2s82sy0pd0pk1pl1pg0ph1pi1pp2p00pj0eh1eu0ee2eo2cr0ir2ip2id2ib4i10a72a12a04a32ao0lt2li2ls2l71la2lk0&amp;w=an2ar2&amp;n=The%20Kitchen%20Sink) all planned out.
---
Fortune favors the bold
---
Yeah, at 250 I think you may have operated as a wholesaler with people buying to sell to the train station vendors or to put in their own machine.
---
I would happily buy just about any plan for 10 caps but I am constantly coming across people who are doing things like selling wooden chair plans for 200 caps, etc...
---
with the nerf I don't know if you'll still be able to pull decent numbers without a dedicated build though.
---
I guess rifles can get away with just a 30% boost thanks to sneak but for bosses you'll definitely want all 9 perks in heavy gunner.
---
**well done**
---
She will always have a place in my heart since she was really the only NPC at the beginning of the game
---
TBF Enforcer with SG is pretty good for hunting big game creatures :o
---
It worked last time (no, it didn’t).
---
So you think a more sniper build with low str (low 6 or 7) and legendary perks to do other things?
---
I'll be honest, other than Ammo Factory, Master Infiltrator and Follow Through/ Take one for the Team, there's not many perks I'm excited about.
---
Lol I didn’t expect that
---
Giggidy

Took roughly four months of continual server hops to eventually find the Red Asylum Outfit. Although the item was acquired before players started to search for each rare outfit. 
---
It is vitally important to know the exact server time when the objects re-spawn, thus able to teleport to the Asylum before other users acquire the items. Nowadays it's near impossible to find the rarest of outfits - Red, Yellow or Forrest Asylum Dresses on a public server.
---
Whilst I did originally stock up with a variety of uniforms. Normally if I found a rare dress I would offer the item for FREE or search out those wearing a similar coloured outfit. Thus given away 4 Forrest, 3 Yellow and a couple of pink and blue dresses to players who deserved them.
---
Regarding the Asylum Headwear there are two caps from recollection that doesn't automatically spawn in the same place. - White and Brown. So are slightly more valuable than the other caps.
---
Downtime is usually 2 -5 hours

Idk, the robot cow outside of the wayward gave me some entertainment.
---
Cheers!
---
It’s really funny you say that because the voice of rose is the same woman who voiced tommy pickles and Susie in rugrats
---
honestly the proliferation of explosive weapons this past week has me questioning authenticity of their origin.
---
They should at least add in one of those animatronic aliens from Nuka-World. Either make it cosmetic or make it into a turret.
---
Thanks, that could explain the difference.
---
I know
---
True, and I've thought about pulling them.   However, I'm often the only one selling serums on a server, so they're there if anyone really needs one.
---
I've always been able to spam collect from river etc. To do it from sink is trickier, you need to "drink" them spam collect on the falling water.
---
Cos fat guys like me playing a female character need somewhere to send dick pics.
---
Ah what the hell. I will send them anyhow.
---
Aqualad/girl doesn't take away the rads from collecting water either just so you know
---
Depends what error code your getting. 4:8:2000 is the ban code I believe.
---
Just watched this - the one who jumped did over 54,000 damage!!!! OMG
---
edit - yeah...some restructuring (nerfs) of damage might really be needed. A rebalance might not be a bad idea.
---
You are correct. I was going to post that they basically are removing leveling...but you are correct. I am just not going to bother reading about or playing the game.
---
Use that huge ugly terminal they gave us all for free, thr personal terminal I think. It will spawn him or her in
---
On the PTS the plans could be stored in world containers, so yes, they *should* be trade able. The gear that I tried to drop gave the 'this item will be destroyed' message.
---
I didn't test exhaustively though, and Bethesda could change any of it at any point
---
Some events can give you rare rewards such as leather coat , traveling leather coat, tattered field jacket, Bos jumpsuit , Vtu cap ect . Be sure to hang onto these as there very valuable for trade . Don’t be that guy that puts your tattered field jacket in the vendor for 10 caps because I’ll buy it again ! Best of luck in your adventures and welcome to the wasteland and also put on pacifist mode .
---
It's definitely linked to the Bethesda account. On the same ps4 between psn accounts I couldn't share fallout first.
---
This "matching set" they mentioned does that mean we now need to buy the secret service armor helmet in order for it to be considered a complete outfit?
---
I suppose that’s fair on assassins, since the cap is in effect, I suppose.
---
And here’s the perk that would be the reference for purifier:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Purifier_(perk)
---
&gt;With 300 plans unpurchzsed, why aren’t people lowering prices?
---
For a lot of people there’s no reason too. You can get 1,400/day from vendors, but there’s a 30,000 cap max.  Assuming no other cap incomes, you can get to max caps without needing to sell to players in \~21 days.   Obviously doing things like daily quests and events,  you’ll get there faster.  
---
Once you have a weapon you’re content with, and once you have armor you need (and now, some of the best armor just uses Gold Bullion anyways), you really aren’t needing caps to buy things from other payers or even in game vendors.  Sure you can probably buy a fun cosmetic here or there, or the rare plan that comes from an event that you otherwise might not have. But really, there isn’t much to spend caps on. 
---
So, for a lot of the longer time players, you just don’t need caps.  There’s nothing to sink them into that’s worth your time.  Valuable items are traded for things other than caps (Such as weapon for weapon trades) 
---
I personally just sell at 10 caps for most plans (since I can’t sell to a vendor anyways) or eventually just drop them on the ground.  Other stuff, I sell for 15% profit over what the vendor would give me, plus the “Vendor tax” because honestly i don’t care if people buy it or not, but I’m not going to “lose money” selling it for less than what I could have earned.
---
Some people just want to burn the world.
---
I sell all my plans at 5 caps each, recipes 1 cap each and ammo is at 1 cap each and don’t seem to sell much 😭
---
🤣
---
Well the only sneak heavy is a flamer. You could but I wouldn’t want to use only one weapon.
---
Oddly he turns up at wavy willards all the time for me.
---
There will certainly be a new dupe method found within the first hour again unfortunately.
---
Probably not. You just need the 5 pieces, which are the two legs, two arms, and chest piece.
---
What kevel are you. And system
---
“Hormone free”
---
I love walking into shop camps like yours and walking around them. Fingers crossed.
---
This guy fucks.
---
After collecting more than 20-30 plans I leave them on train stations or give for free with stimpaks, ammo etc to new players. 
---
There’re max 20 plans in game only which are point of trade imho
---
They did go to Space X to do research for Starfield and Todd did do a shared interview with Elon so there is a connection to be exploited there.
---
Secret Service counts as sturdy if I’m not mistaken. Though from what I read, the relative perks are being changed to just be “matching set” bonuses.
---
...what build am I even looking at here?
---
One charisma, an expert in everything but Love...
---
Bold. I would go as low as 1 second to 5 hours and 1 second.
---
Ammo factory, What Rads, Master Infiltrator, and the one where you get poison resistance for a matching set. Anything beyond those is just bonus.
---
If you already know the plan then doesn’t matter how cheap it is. I’ve been a small time antiques dealer and trader for years and known plenty of different dealers and strategies , some are small profit quick turnover, others fewer sales but larger mark up, the buy it when it’s right in front of you rather than shop around for a better deal , some people sell affordable  usable items others highly priced top tier items, There’s no one way that’s better than the others - however this is a game and has an artificial economy which is ruined due to a scam which gave free caps ( can’t mention the words here or the bot bans post) and also the game give you free caps every day for junk. For high end players caps are basically worthless which is why they do item to item trade only on the other Reddit site, if that wasn’t the case The best way would to be high end, highly desirable stock priced very high because unlike in real life you don’t have to waste any money on a posh fancy shop or advertising to attract your desired fancy customers. Personally Anything not good enough for trading I usually run with the car boot sale - priced cheap because it’s useless to me and taking up space and I’d be throwing it away otherwise. One other way the game trading could MAYBE do it would be introducing a different currency type solely for player to player trading with some safeguards built in and an ingame online auction facility think Sotheby’s or ebay
---
Lol, i was in SBQ at level 7, went with a friend, snuck the whole time, and just popped shots at the queen till i did enough damage to loot then hid inside a survival tent. Wasnt a fun time for me tbh. but i did get a level or so out of it so not all bad.
---
Yeah just play music on the Spotify app on PlayStation
---
Also if you team up, defending a workshop can be tricky as tram members can still pvp on you !
---
What is the lure of quad weapons? Less reloads for dps , but shotguns don't seem like boss fight weapons?
---
I have a melee at 120, heavy weapon and sniper around 90. On Xbox.
---
But I need all the sound effects so i know if something is creeping up on me. Can you still hear everything else?
---
Spotify has an app on PS4 that integrates with the quick menu(when you hold down the PS-button).
---
I use it all the time to listen to music while gaming, it's really handy.
---
Edit: It also shows your playlists, so you can easily find what you want to listen to!
---
Yes, Aqua(person) is still available in the Endurance perks with the same effects as in FO4.
---
the sun is a deadly laser
---
Tbh if your on ps4, ive got, well ive got some plans and recipes, about 30 in all and all plans are 10 caps and recipes are 5,  if its something decent like combat rifle plans or p.a jetpacks it'll be maybe 100 caps, but if they sit there long enough, even they will go down in price.
---
Vendor prices are already super low. Like I don't understand how people are selling serums for 300 when it's such a hassle to make one.  I think people basically give away stuff because they don't even need anything themselves.
---
Yep! Would recommend just turn the music down in the Spotify menu  and leaving game sound effects as they are
---
The problem is you’re the minority. I’ve got just 400 hours and not one time out of the 100+ SBQ’s and now about 15 Earle’s have I ever seen anyone beat them in less than 5 minutes. And the majority take 10+ minutes.
---
I feel like this nerf should and will be nerfed itself. I enjoy being able to clear areas in a couple minutes. I’m not interested in grinding an already constant grind game. The answer to “how do we get people playing more” is never “lets just make them grind longer”.
---
I don't know why you deleted the other thread but I still don't know what build I'm looking at here.
---
1~2 hours I think, I put a batch in the fridge and they last for long hours. I spend ~30 minutes prepping and 4~5 hours sprinting for xp. Good luck mate, hope you find your optimal build and have fun haha
---
I don't remember hearing about his demise...I wonder if he survived? If he did I want him back to help us rebuild the Responders!

Indeed! Originally you could find a [holotape](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Your_order%27s_arrived) related to Duchess and her little operation in Welch there.

Whatsbyour build and what perks are you chosing?

Because chickens are fowl creatures whose weight is mostly poop

I'm not showing my build, I'm showing that I have enough cards to max out 6 legendary perk cards.
---
How can this be a mega post if the subject line isn't in all caps and have at least FOUR exclamation points?
---
OP is low level, around 19 I think they said, so RadShield may not be viable just yet.
---
It's competitive games that can last for years and don't get boring even with minimal updates. Unfortunately, we aren't getting anything competitive in this game.
---
Right there with ya \[T]/
---
If you listen closely, you can still hear him opening perk packs to this day
---
This is the best post I've seen in a while! Ill dm my number for that phone call 😂😂
---
The current build is just a casual, XP build. I'm getting maxed STR, PER, END, INT, AGI and Follow Through.
---
I know, but unless you're using pistols, I don't see much of a build with only 5 str or 2 per.
---
Looks like you took a screenshot of my Perk Menu, we have almost exactly the same amount of perk points saved....but I have 7 more card packs that you. Maxed Ammo Factory Perk card day one...for us anyways :)
---
Oops stoped at 4. My bad.
---
I just want to be able to put a plushie or something on top of the scrapbox.
---
Just put spotify on in the background on a fallout Playlist. There is one with the nuka girl as the cover that has around 500 songs that me and my friends always use! If you set the levels right it even sounds like its coming from the radio in the game
---
cool.  I just hit level 200.  I am going all-in on the ammo Factory perk. I threw a lot of bullets down range. It'll help me Farm less lead and I can probably make a bunch of 45 or 556 and sell it too.

I do this on Xbox but im sure it works the same! There are all kinds of fallout playlists. Some are the songs from older games and others are just songs from that era but it really adds to the experience!

Unfortunately I've accidentally hit the Open Perk Pack option more than I'd care to admit.
---
Still waiting for demon souls remake and elden ring release dates. They should definitely add praise the sun pose for photo mode in F76 if not an emote too
---
Yes, you have access to the cards the moment you unlock the first slot.
---
Ok. I assume the sniper build is stealth. Adrenaline.  Crits build?
---
Lol or 1EOO-G5SS-86 for the people that can't read or write.
---
Not sure, there’s no way to test that in PTS.
---
Haha. I have done that a few times as well. But luckily I don't think I've dropped anything.
---
I literally made a post about exactly this a while ago. Its really frustrating....
---
This is it
---
I will always upvote these posts. The amount of people that still ask is insane.
---
Or, ya know, produce a few chickens.  Be nice being able to kill a couple of chickens for soup now and then, especially when my toon is feeling poorly and doesn't feel up to foraging for a disease cure and a little old fashioned comfort food raised right on the homestead would ease his suffering.

yes she's humanized a bit by the recordings at the police station but gawd I hate her tone and having her snark you up constantly during her quests was quite annoying.

Right so if anything they needed a buff rather than being nerfed further.

Todd will get you!

But agreed - I don't know what you PM'd but I know what you PM'd and I approve.  That slog is unbearable and until Bethesda fixes the glitch, it's no one's fault to pass it along.   Using it makes you realize how much boring grind you had in store otherwise.....

Anytime I go to a CAMP and see a Mole Miner Gauntlet selling for 450 caps, all I can think of is that person has to be new to the game.

Is this update making legacy weapons even more OP?

Love this! Can just imagine a character pulling out all sorts of different guns one after the other.

The calculations are not set in stone until it’s set in stone and we shall see how it pans out in terms of endgame bosses. Going to be very interesting

Or, like me, don't really care about selling stuff. If I need caps, then I start looking up the value of stuff and price it accordingly. But honestly most of the time I don't have the patience to really put much time into looking up prices and such. Just really wanna get in the game and get playing.

True but my god the glitch is one of the most boring things ever lol

Not convinced that much will change overall due to how easy the content is currently for anyone with decent gear. I tested and played around on PTS and am just accepting it as a step to sorting out weapon balancing. Some of the damage changes make no sense however so presuming they are looking at them as we bug reported a few - e.g. why hit already uncompetitive energy weapons hard? I'm just staying positive and not dwelling on it as there are positive changes like one wasteland, season 2 etc at the same time.
---
I will confess I did screen shot around 100 weapons across my 5 characters just to amuse myself post change. ;)

And now we play the waiting game...
---
Thanks for the reminder; if they don't interfere with Daily Ops, they may interfere with legendary perk card selection.
---
Its been like that for 2 years, Bethesda set that standard long ago, it used to be way "worse" before the two shot and explosive nerfs. Its been like this so long that you can't really change it without backlash. Unfortunately for true fallout fans (That which I'm not), 76 is not a fallout game and we need to stop holding it to the same standards.
---
Hey, did you notice I'm leaking water more than before?
---
Power Armor / Heavy Guns build since 76 launch day years ago...

Likely 3-4 hours, sometimes more.

You beat my post by 1 minute haha Thought I was the biggest keener. I know we still have to wait for servers to come back up, but one less obstacle to our legendary perks and daily ops and max-level-legendaries-from-low-level-events
---
Yes, that is one of the strongest weapons you can get your hands on.

It is impossible to know that.

Funniest part of your post is where you said "tested"... Roflmao..... And you missed a 0 on the screw something up percentage.

It varies, unfortunately. Usually, they are only down for a few hours, so they should be back up sometime early afternoon, EST (1 - 3 PM).

Ah the waiting game sucks, let's play hungry hungry hippos

they are offline up until people stop asking this stupid question when they know its been asked a hundred times.

You won't regret it.

Oh nice! I’ve only tested it out on things like super mutants etc but it seems to be really good and that’s without any rifle perks so can’t wait to change my build around :)

How about Ally quests?  Mine seem to cycle at like 12:30AM ET

I think a vault-tec generator that only supplies 100 power is a daft idea, so I’m the kind of guy who would have three windmills powering his vendors. Hmm.

My dog is a shit vacuum, a shituum.
---
Still debating on this perk.  I hate crafting ammo as it is and making more ammo faster sounds wonderful.  At the same time, my few months of first left me with enough lead, steel, acid and cloth to probably craft an entire servers worth of players 20,000 rounds each.
---
I think I can manage to get by with that amount if I really try lol.  But still, more ammo for the same amount of resources and less clicking when I need to sounds sweet.
---
Damn! Didnt expect it to be that big
---
Do you, or do you not have full health bar available to you? YES or NO? Stop pretending like having 90-70% more tanking capability means jack shit. Why aren't you Bloodied? Lemme guess, pro gamer that prefers a challenge, right?
---
Good! Was hoping that was the answer lol
---
I thought you'd get burrows for "the day."
---
Brah don’t listen to the pope , use some contraception . They’re just trying to bolster their numbers lol
---
How do you make caps from vendors? I’ve heard this before but don’t understand
---
are you required to see the report at the end, though? improved health bars and save my stuff really changed my gameplay.
---
Two years now, you'd figure people would understand Bethesda's downtime isn't predictable.
---
Thats what she said?🤦‍♂️
---
I’m at work and can’t log in. Does that mean I’m banned?
---
Why would you use quad, reload speed isn't a problem
---
You need to tweak the TV setting to get the most out of it. Default setting isn’t great but that’s the nature of HDR, default is too flat to look at.
---
30 gbs on PS4. My jaw dropped. I did not expect it to be that beefy!
---
That’s a lotta girth.
---

---
.... but then trigger a random fast travel bug where the victims are taken from one place to another and another etc with death or re-log the only cure....
---
Patch 22.
---
Thats what she said!

0906-0906
---
I can only imagine being a live wasteland farmer. Getting up in the morning everyday to pick the eggs of my captured deathclaw, and yelling at my chickens for being useless, blaming them for all the fingers I have lost trying to get them deathclaw eggs.
---
Let's just call it a 'close to death' build.  Done right, those last HP are REALLY hard to lose.  
---
My issue is that I've spent 20 years in the Fallout universe running scared from a mostly-red HP display, and it's super hard for me psychologically to play that way.  I understand you have quite a few built-in safety nets with Bloodied, death in FO76 isn't even 1% as devastating as it was in the earlier games, and from a DMG standpoint its been (and most likely still will be) the optimal build.  Call it OCD, but I don't think I can deal with that red stripe on my HP bar all the time. 
---
Junkies, on the other hand, I can TOTALLY get into.  Multiple chem addiction was, like, second nature in games like FO1 and FO2.
---
Hey I haven’t played for 3 days - what did this update change :)
---
My kid is going to bed early tonight. Ha, seriously tho.. should be interesting.
---
I think he’s saying that AA is real close to bloodied now for low health builds. He’s not comparing full health AA to low health bloodied right?
---
One wasteland and a damage nerf
---
I've done it all three ways, happened to me as well. I'd assume the game misplaces her mother's AI or code so it causes Jen to recognize her as not being present. But I've also seen other people not have this problem, so, phhhshshsbbsbsbzbbbb, who knows.
---
The report is validating your current dailyops progress, so it's required. And I am not sure you get the rewards without it either...
---
Still poops one star rolling pin so why do you want to waste all that ammo.
---
Not sure I’d have to do the math but possibly, 120 shots plus a faster reload adds up.
---
Edit: it’s not.
---
I didn’t think the /s was needed but here we are
---
Both are still in the Founder's Hall regardless, so they're fine.
---
and I thought my build was weird.
---
33.067 for me on PS4
---
"I haven't played for a few weeks. I was almost 12% through the score run but now I'm back at the beginning. Has this happened to anyone else??"
---
30 gb kinda big
---
Did Beth tell us what's being nerfed?
---
So far the only real change is the ability to play the game has gone from can to cannot.
---
31.33GB on Xbox, available now
---
You can get 30% more shots off. Fixer takes as long to reload as it does to empty a clip so you spend half your time reloading.
---
Well darn. I thought about sending one myself but I guess I won’t bother. Sorry
---
30 GB update - dear god
---
Yep i figured this too. They downvote now but thats because they don't know this entire game is a cash grab.
---
I'm having the same issue!
---
I think it is an all around nerf, damage is now calculated with addition instead of multiplication.
---
You dumb ziyon
---
I'm just waiting for those sweet sweet patch notes.
---
I have water purifiers at my camp, every hour or so I collect about 50 water from them.  I head to one of the train stations (i have one a short walk from my
---
camp) and with a 20 effective charisma (between base CHA, Better Barter, and Berry Mentants).
---
I also sell all the other chems and crap i simply don’t want. 
---
I easily hit 1400 and still have stuff to sell the next day
---
Well damn... Guess i wont be playing 76 in the next 2 days haha. Thanks!
---
Yooo I’m on Xbox. What kind of ammo do you need?
---
29.928GB for me on PS4 (matching OP). Any chance you missed the last update (or some Atom shop updates)?
---
Mole moma gave me an instigating fixer so I'm happy
---
Much bigger than I thought. Thanks!
---
I want to down vote to spite the song. Took everything I had not too.
---
Can you not check yourself?
---
Ooof
---
don't think they'd change much, if at all, in the span of a few hours. AA is apparently outdamaging even junkie's for full health builds, assuming the mob defense/damage ratio hits the 'sweet spot'. which is much easier now with the new calculation than before.
---
similar case with TSE, which is now outdamaging BE in bloodied builds, depending on the weapon. I'm thinking TSE+DE however is broken, and demo is being applied to the ballistic damage as well. so I wouldn't go all in TSE just yet.
---
What a idiot lol.
---
I sell mine for 300, basically as a service to players who need them. I used to sell at 200c, but then some unscrupulous jerk would always buy all of them to resell to vendors for caps.
---
I run enough SBQ and ACP to never really need all of the flux I get. I stockpile the flux mats on a mule, so when I decide to craft stable flux, it's usually hundreds at a time.
---
Idk how if im honest, only recently got the game
---
My build changes depending on what I'm doing. This build is for grinding XP.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Best to play it now, the hippos will get hungry quicker after the patch and less balls will spawn.
---
Know a guy that Solo'd Colossal Problem  in less than a minute with a bloodied fixer. That's the most sought after gun in the game
---
No, I was just gonna help new players...
---
Nvm figured out how, it's downloading
---
It's weird because I've historically played melee builds on most of my characters on the 3D Fallouts (I had too much PTSD from the Temple of Trials to melee through 2 haha) but 76 has probably the best mechanic for it (I'm not shitting on bloodied, it's obviously a good build) but I've just never felt the incentive to go that route on 76.
---
I get the healthbar thing, it's the massive amount of rads that sets me off looking at it more than anything
---
That's what he said.
---
IMO, quickest way to make back your investment on serums is a bunch of small sales.  I sell them for 275 and can get cleaned out in a weekend by people buying to resell.
---
Turn in where?
---
It's live on steam so don't see why it wouldn't be live on Beth launcher
---
They're called Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets. By that logic, would you not go to Pleasant Valley to attempt to claim the tickets?
---
I guess it doesn't make you feel any better I did something similar with a RobCo quest and had an assaultron trying to horde my loot. 2min to spare I got the loot and booked it to my camp (with the Mission Impossible theme playing in my head) Had to go back the next day and repeat everything.
---
The basement of the Pleasant Valley Resort. You should find a protectron down there who takes the tickets and gives you random items left behind.
---
at pleasant valley ski resort. Go inside to where the vendor bot is and down the stairs there's a claim bot.
---
can give you some not common stuff. the fancy shotgun can sell for a bit.
---
Dammit Bergthersder!
---
Its takes a couple of hours
---
AA isn’t effected because it never did anything anyway.  The are mag mods and perk cards that do the same thing.  Everyone said the same when the TSE nerf came but AA never shined.  TSE is going to make a come back for sure.  
---
None of it matters while magic weapons are left unchecked, these are the 30sec Queen destroyers anyway.
---
Yes. I'm still annoyed that I can't apply a red headlamp to my Red shift Excavator power armor.
---
And I also hope that if they're avaible, they don't become obscenely rare.
---
Jesus christ people can be dumb apparently.
---
Guys I just got a bloodied explosive Gatling plasma is this also a good gun?
---
Cryolator also works as a sneak weapon.
---
Yep, they have less trade value than most high end fixers and handmades lol
---
Below the raider vendor bot?  Cool. Thank you!
---
No way, I love the fact you're are literally never to old to game, at the weekend I'll raise a beer for the guys that keep going, fair play. I hope I still have the coordination to play when I'm that age. 👌👍🍻
---
Lol. This would have been epic to see.
---
31.33 on Xbox.
---
Might be able to play sometime today. lol.
---
Damn, I didn't know the CC PA had those missing pieces in Fo4. I really want to place the skin on my T-65 once I buy the helmet, so I hope they fix it soon.
---
u/Ladydevann u/Valseek, Can you please forward this post to the devs? Most of these issues require really simple fixes but they would make a world of difference for the respective situations.
---
Sounds like you didn't quite understand how the update works.
---
I should be updated within an hour but servers probably won’t be back up for another 3 or 4 hours anyway.
---
Mines not coming up for a update have u got the same thing? It’s it’s available to install now
---
The servers aren't even up yet
---
666-666-66 uh 66!
---
Super weird. And 4GB isn't a small addition (\~12% bigger). I did note that I had some Legendary-perk-related load messages when I played yesterday, so maybe I managed to get a content-update? I am grasping at straws... Either way, it's weird that it's such a disparate size. Hopefully your download finishes quickly!
---
Sarcasm is lost on so many people.
---
Well, at least I'll be 2 steps away from being totally finished with the Possum/Tadpole quests when the download finishes. 23/25 on the Miner Badge and I'm done!
---
I think it's fair to say this is a shitpost.
---
Sign me up for fighting a giant chicken as an end boss
---
You'll probably be done with the update way before the servers come back online.
---
We did a queen and Earl in the last 10 minutes...too bad for us the CP event finished 10 secs after the server shut down.
---
He even says in the video that junkies still outclasses AA when factoring in full health builds.
---
Lmfao don’t know why you’re being downvoted for asking a question, but yes just keep your music down low, and you can change some individual sound settings in-game like turning footsteps up all the way or turning captions on so you can hear enemies better.
---
Here we go again
---
or what? stop being so entitled
---
OK Karen
---
It definitely will not be
---
You don’t expect them to ACTUALLY fix any of these do you? 😂
---
I believe so, I’m not 100% sure and I can’t check as I have school right now
---
Personally, I'm most excited for Daily Ops. Here's a buglist to tide us over until servers are up! 
---
Link to my most recent list: [List Number 24](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3k4rr/fallout_76_update_21_patch_notes_august_4_2020/g0btutv/?context=3)
---
***THE BUG SHOWCASE***
---
A few bugs/oversights that I am revisiting just in case they were forgotten:
---
* Event - Powering Up Thunder Mountain - The description for this event [truncates the last part of the sentence, 'on.',](https://imgur.com/a/qGaJCZn) that can be seen in the other power plant event descriptions
---
* Atomic Shop - [Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit body textures are broken again,](https://imgur.com/a/WjQnmzE) this issue was previously fixed in [Patch 11.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ckp09c/fallout_76_patch_115_notes_august_1_2019/)
---
* The Nixie Tube camp item is broken, and just displays a [giant white light instead of neon orange numbers like they do in Fallout 4](https://imgur.com/a/yQvlZhh)
---
* These stairs at Morgantown Airport are [missing a retaining wall, meaning you can see the terrain and geometry beneath them](https://imgur.com/a/YxhMINt)
---
* Nuka Quantum Grenades incorrectly use the ['Pistol' favorites icon instead of the 'Grenade' favorites icon](https://imgur.com/a/dOs8U8x)
---
***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* Vault 94 Strangler Heart Power Armor crafted *after* Wastelanders release will [keep their vines and leaves even when skins are applied to them,](https://imgur.com/a/il5mbmG) resulting in model clipping
---
* PC players can no longer use right click to toggle the Pip-boy view/move the Pip-boy around (possibly an intentional change)
---
* The suppressor on the 'Blood Eagle' Handmade skin has [stretched textures](https://imgur.com/a/usv5Vth)
---
* Atomic Shop - Beelzebilly Head and Suit are [missing their Atom Shop icons](https://imgur.com/a/BVPExqA)
---
* Atomic Shop - Beelzebilly Head and Suit have [incorrect world item textures,](https://imgur.com/a/18LCdcQ) they are using the 'Baaaad News Billy' textures which have white accents instead of red accents (when the player is wearing them, they have correct textures)
---
* Atomic Shop - The orientation of the Classic Jukebox [preview model is backwards](https://imgur.com/a/WgJMqlO)
---
* Atomic Shop - Turning off the Classic Jukebox and then fast traveling away from your CAMP and back, or relogging after turning the Jukebox off, causes the music to play even though the jukebox is 'off'. This also affects the non-Atom Shop Jukebox
---
* Nuclear Winter - Gauss Shotgun does not display correct damage numbers
---
* Nuclear Winter - You can sometimes stop being able to equip or use grenades/mines, both from the Pip-boy and from the Favorites Wheel, cause unclear
---
* Nuclear Winter - The Stealth Field all players receive upon entering the match can sometimes fail to disappear when you loot a container, meaning you remain invisible until it times out (this is likely due to latency)
---
* Nuclear Winter - If you are in the 'downed' state when a nuke lands on you, you are not killed by it. This makes it possible to survive being nuked (unclear if intended)
---
* Nuclear Winter - On rare occasions, the match can display player numbers [higher than 52.](https://imgur.com/a/byLPOTQ)
---
* Nuclear Winter - If you are downed while firing an automatic weapon and then revived, you will continue to fire your weapon without holding down the trigger (this also occurs in Adventure)
---
* The preview models for Aluminum, Copper, Gold, Lead, Steel, Silver, Vault Steel, and the Bulk variants of these materials are displaced too low, and thus can become [hidden behind UI elements such as the crafting menu](https://imgur.com/a/kRL16Gz)
---
* Challenge - Completing a lifetime challenge no longer pops up the '+XX Atoms' notification, even if the challenge is being tracked (Atoms are still correctly awarded)
---
* Event - Protest March - This event fails to auto-track when joined 
---
* Speaking to Crutchley in Vault 76 while the Overseer's dialogue plays sometimes causes your HUD to disappear until you relog or use a workbench
---
* Shooting the dead body of a player who is wearing Power Armor causes armor condition damage to the Power Armor pieces even though the player is dead. Normal armor is not affected by this
---
* The preview model for Toxic Soot Flower is [incorrectly blue, and not white](https://imgur.com/a/1wndC7C) (it uses the base Soot Flower model instead of a retextured version)
---
* Quest - Something Sentimental - The quest reward incorrectly displays your current amount of caps as zero, and then adds the quest reward to that
---
* Event - A Colossal Problem - [Earle Williams can sometimes begin walking into the ceiling and/or floor,](https://imgur.com/a/6itICnP) unclear what causes this
---
* Ammo Converter - The 'sell 2000' option for Flamer Fuel does not remove 2000 fuel from the player, this is likely due to it incorrectly searching for a different ammo type
---
* Mortimer uses generic, cheery Mr. Handy "hello's" which [clashes with the rest of his relatively condescending voicelines](https://imgur.com/a/eLmVd9a)
---
* Ground Pounder incorrectly affects the Black Powder Rifle and The Dragon, despite neither of them being automatic rifles
---
* Honey and Honeycomb both do not react to physics, so they float in the air if they spawn in the world
---
* The 'Salty' mod for the Tenderizer incorrectly [adds 14 pounds of weight to the weapon,](https://imgur.com/a/E4jSvq0) which is inconsistent with the other Tenderizer mods, Peppered and Spicy, who only add 2 and 0 pounds, respectively
---
* Event - Grahm's Meat-Cook - Turning cooking spits and playing instruments during the waiting period allows the progress bar to begin at a higher percentage than is likely intended
---
* The lamp on the preview model of the Chally the Moo-Moo Backpack skin has [broken smoothing groups, you can see individual quads](https://imgur.com/a/woXU01Q)
---
* When shot at walls/terrain, the light that emits from Alien Blaster projectiles [continues to pass through them even though the projectile itself stops](https://imgur.com/a/8BvMhJf)
---
* Alien Blaster projectiles have no impact splash effect (for reference, Plasma/Laser weapons have a small 'puff' when they impact objects/NPCs but Alien Blaster Projectiles simply disappear)
---
* These medical screens inside of Nuke Silos have occlusion planes that let you see objects [behind them visibly unload](https://imgur.com/a/DdNUSHx)
---
* The ceiling inside Pleasant Valley Train Station is mismatched, [there are several tiles that do not match the texture of their neighbors](https://imgur.com/a/hopI8Uf)
---
* Forest Scout, Urban Scout, and Vault 94 Thorn/Solar armor chest pieces have incorrect geometry on the right shoulder. [This extra vertex stretches the texture, and is not present on the left shoulder](https://imgur.com/a/EEZJDOf)
---
* One of the Backpack skins used by Traveling Merchants [has broken textures](https://imgur.com/a/KGoxOhF)
---
* Scavengers at Emmett Mountain Disposal Site frequently [drop 2 weapons and 2 sets of ammo,](https://imgur.com/a/HF9RyUL) which is likely unintended
---
* When using the Ammo Converter terminal while wearing Power Armor, the player's view [clips down into the terminal stand instead of facing the screen,](https://imgur.com/a/LIQtGHS) making it impossible to use 
---
* Event - It's a Trap - [If this event spawns in the Cranberry Bog, South-West of Watoga,](https://imgur.com/a/BocudOC) the Scorchbeast never spawns
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Social Menu - Add a 'Request invite to party' option, that way you can let a person who is in a group know that you are interested in grouping
---
* Nuclear Winter - Add Nuclear Launch Codes and Nuclear Briefcases to the team UI so you can see who has codes/briefcases
---
* Remove the explosion from the Imposter Sheepsquatch's death, the explosion frequently launches the body downhill, making it hard to find/loot the body
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Make Floater Grenades sellable/droppable/tradeable
---
* Make Floater Grenade explosion radius affected by Grenadier
---
* Buff Magnetic Personality, temporary Charisma is not very useful since it cannot be used to share higher rank perks (Legendary Charisma will also have this issue)
---
* Buff the Troubleshooter's/Hunter's/Zealot's/Mutant Slayer's/Exterminator's/Ghoul Slayer's legendary effects; there is no reason to use damage vs. one enemy type, when you can get higher damage vs. all enemy types by using a different legendary effect
---
Transylvania 6-5000. Come at me Bethesda bros. wHy CaN't I lOg In hue hue hue
---
It’s not entitled to want to play a game I bought
---
Same...considering the menu asks by default "Would you like to open a card pack?"...just not paying attention I've probably opened a dozen or so lol
---
Ok so i started playing about a qeek ago. I dont follow them on their  services like Twitter or on their website yet I still managed to find out so anyone who didn't realise shouldn't really be effected in my opinion
---
This is my exact argument for selling my items for way LOWER than everyone else. Plans &amp; mods? 1 cap. Chems? 1-5. I've never sold a legendary weapon for more than 500. I just don't need the caps but I know it may help another player out. That's what i use my vendors for. It helps others, frees up space in my stash &amp; i also get a tiny profit without hitting max too quickly.
---
Started off good with just proper info, then making fun of those who wanted to log in and didnt sit no life on reddit and forums, and then you got even more nasty. Turned my upvote to a downvote. Not because I am one of those who didn't know this, but beacuse of your nasty attitude.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Correction: they can be turned in *very slowly.*
---
Almost have a Gigabyte now,  it says 6 hours left.
---
Np
---
It's not the download that scares me, it will be copying until saturday probably
---
FYI patch size is 20.31GB on PC
---
Is it wrong to. Want to play a game I paid for? Jsut because you’re parents paid for it doesn’t mean other people didn’t work for it
---
Not as far as you may think. You start at Hostile with the Raiders (-2000 Rep). To hit Neighborly, you need 6000 Rep. to hit Ally, you need 12,000 Rep. So technically you’re more than halfway there from where you started. 
---
But it’s possible you’ve already done the bulk of the ‘big rep’ boosters. If all you have available is the dailies, then here’s some tips you can use. 
---
First, for Retirement Plan, here’s the best option to maximize your Rep. Find the Raider still alive. Convince him to return to Crater (+10 Rep).  Then kill him. When you return to Rocksy, tell her Appalachia has a new corpse. That gets you +25. This is in addition to the standard +200 for this daily. Total Rep: +235
---
Second, for The Importance of Communication, decline any reward. That will get you an extra +25 Rep. Total Rep: +225
---
Third, for Davenport’s Photo Opportunity daily, choose to take pictures of Foundation, but turn them in to Kiyomi and decline a reward. That’s worth +75 Rep. Note: You can still go back to Davenport and get Treasury Notes for this. And if you have Cha 8+, you can still get some caps as well. You just have to lie to a robot. I hope you can look yourself in the mirror after that. Oh, wait, this is Fallout. Mirrors don’t work. 
---
Fourth, there’s a sneaky trick you can play on Ward during Vital Equipment. Talk to the Raider Thief and let them keep the equipment. You’ll lose 10 Settler Rep (unless you’re already maxed) but gain 10 Raider Rep. As a bonus, you don’t have to go back to that lazy bastard to finish the daily and get your Treasury Notes. 
---
Finally, you can go to Ohio River Adventures and talk to Bones and Blackeye. You can get extra daily Rep by defending the purifiers and turning in Mirelurk Meat (up to +35)
---
That’s about 350 Raider Rep each day (since you should only be getting Retirement Plan ***or*** The Importance of Communication once per day, not both), although I think you can server hop and repeater the Ohio River Adventure ones. And there are some random encounters that can get you 10 or 25 Rep as well. 
---
If you do all of these each day, you can get the remaining 6k Rep you need in about 17 days or so.
---
Happy grinding!
---
I tried to call you before, but I lost my nerve... I tried my imagination, but I was disturbed.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahaaha yeah...
---
They'll sit at your camp and you'll have to buy them all off the atom store.
---
This market makes no sense lol
---
Deadly tato salads
---
🎵Oh lord, the great collapse won’t be our end...
---
Just doing it casually (and siding with them in the vault), I'm now 95% of the way to "allied" with the settlers. Since wastelanders launched.
---
So, weeks/months from now.
---
Fantastic!
---
Yep - been toying with switching to commando but I have a nice instigating lever action and instigating gauss rifle that it's hard to give up LOL.
---
Still tinkering with it...have far too many points in QOL weight reduction as I'm somewhat paranoid but getting better. I'll probably want that legendary perk that gives you full food/water/health once per 30 minutes - then I could drop pharmacy and that perk that does the same for food/water.
---
I don’t think they meant a group right at this moment
---
Yea it blows. I have a couple which are bugged out. Complete daily quests and large creatures.
---
Yes, still one of best commando weapons. Have to kill things with something
---
Mostly this except for a few notes.
---
1.The rate doesnt matter AS MUCH my lmg only has like 160 for fr and its definitely magic
---
2. Magic shotguns only work in VATS
---
3. For some reason if you get 2 magic effects on the gauss minigun they cancel each other out
---
4. Two shot and explosive effectively double your fire rate making some non magic weapons magic
---
I’m not sold on it just yet, I have a collection of everything so I’m not all to bothered by it, I just believe that Bloodied is still going to be on top. I mean, my b2525 fixer hit for 310 dmg on average in nerd rage, with 2.5x sneak.
---
Even assuming a 40% cut, that’s still 170ish x2.5 which is 425 if my math is right.
---
I think that this is really only going to effect endgame bosses and have little to no effect on normal enemy encounters
---
Oh I guess you’re being sarcastic? I’ve just never used a fixer before and always been a shotgun build so didn’t really know
---
Rip, I had one other endgame player and a lvl 25 that tagged along for help - we didn't stand a chance lol
---
I at least want the CMs to send them over to the BGS devs.
---
I guess those would be really low on their priority list but we can still hope they may get 'em fixed one day.
---
RIP Glitched Line in the Sand
---
By selling to NPC vendors.  Duchess at the Wayward will buy things from you.  All but one train station has a vendor bot that will buy and sell things.  Once you get to Whitespring Resort there are a dozen or so vendor bots on the first floor of the hotel.  Foundation and Crater also have NPC vendors.   Basically if you walk up to someone who is a vendor, select the "trade" option to sell them things you don't want.
---
30.289 GB on Playstation network.
---
There goes my evening playing FO76 considering the PS4 takes ages to copy those files after downloading them.
---
This is more of a flex than a question.
---
You can get 100% weight reduction if you take your armor off lol
---
aye. the western outfits lost their value when the tickets were dooped. you could still get 500-1000 caps. fancy shotgun has fixed effects the fancy revolver doesn't.
---
Too bad your parents didn't pay for spelling and grammar lessons.
---
That’s correct with regard to scaling. If you’re at, say, Whitespring Gold Club, all the ghouls will be their lowest possible level for your level 10 friend while you, a 300, see max level. They will also do damage accordingly - lower damage for your friend and the highest possible damage for you. 
---
Now, some enemies are stronger than others. A Deathclaw will still be scary for that low level while a mole rat at the substation by Tygart isn’t gonna suddenly do Deathclaw levels of damage to you. 
---
I also think some areas will have a higher floor for the lowest level enemies, as well. The Bog will still be more difficult for lower level players than the Toxic Valley.
---
The option to update the game isn’t showing in the manage update screen my x box is having a brain aneurysm lol
---
Nani?!
---

I’m like level 281 and I have a lot of skins for backpacks I own the high capacity one but I never finished that quest I started it but events and my love of collecting got in the way so now I have to figure out what to do
---
There is a ‘loophole’ in one of the reward conversations, depending on what you did during the daily quest, that gets you 25 Rep each time you cycle it. You can cycle if about once every five seconds, so that’s 300 Rep/minute or 9k Rep in 30 minutes.

I'd say try after noon.

---
Yes, 54K+ damage for an unarmed weapon - and it's single-shot rifles that appear to be taking the biggest nerf. Makes sense.
---
Will it still be decent after the nerf? I guess it’s still gonna be stronger than my shotgun build so I might as well just do it anyway lol
---
I mean like a month ago they said this would mean it is easier to buff stuff and that the damage recalculation was not intended to be a nerf. It seemed plausible that they would actually add some of those buffs to the PTS before the patch went live, but I guess that was wishful thinking. 
---
I expect we get a few minor buffs down the road, but large in part this ends up being a major nerf in the long term

It's likely to be me ranting about that. Stupid fucking way to die lol.
---
Nope it’s having a brain aneurysm lol
---
:edit it’s working now stupid thing thanks everyone
---
Not worried as it's a game. 
---
worried about dying to Covid thats something to be really worried about.
---
I have FO76 on PC and PS4 and Fallout 1st doesn't carry over between them.  You would need to buy it on each platform.
---
And so it begins... again. Who would have thought this game would endure 2 years?
---
Not the hero we need but the hero we deserve!

Great work!
---
Yup this
---
Relax, it'll be down for a little while longer.  Put the stix down, maybe go for a walk, or fold the clean laundry that's mostblikely still sitting in the basket...
---
Stealth being nerfed sucks as it effects rifleman, not just commando.  Why exclude a main component to the game for daily ops and why is explosive damage not getting the stealth multiplier.
---
&gt;One Wasteland: Creature levels now adjust dynamically to more closely match character levels, so you can adventure anywhere in Appalachia, whether alone or with your friends!
---
I'm so excited! I was starting to get stuck with quests because they all directed me to the far east where I basically have to sneak all the time to avoid getting absolutely slaughtered. 
---
I didn't mind this too much because it had a sense of excitement. But it made parts of the map feel pretty much inaccessible to a newbie like me. Which is understandable, but I can't wait to explore more.
---
New boss fight the turducken 😆
---
Good question
---
Exactly,  but for melee instigating looks to be the new roll for farming, this might have been better than my bloodied claws for dps.  Aa is close to bloodied in angry turtles testing
---
If all of this actually works, this could be the update we've really needed for quite some time.
---
For me, just being able to put weapon displays back up on the wall is huge.
---
Oh man, nightmare fuel... also I forgot how good South Park is
---
I have a bloodied shotgun at the moment. +10% damage. And I forgot the third one. 
---
But the fact that one of my unyielding armor pieces has the “reduced damage while blocking” makes it so every vats hit becomes an insta kill on most enemies.  
---
I tested it out by unequipping the armor piece, and it takes 2-4 shots on vats. 
---
But with that magic armor piece it’s one shot.
---
Indeed. I am talking about it as a game of course that I enjoy playing, not horrible irl stuffs.
---
They fixed the Queen we can now cripple her!!!!
---
I understand but i'm talking about Microsoft membership as 76 is on Gamepass
---
It also probably depends on platform.  ON PS4 we don’t exactly have a lot of new players coming in since it’s not on any type of game pass (yet), so low level characters are more likely the alts of other higher level players.  
---
Sometimes you can tell - see a level 10 running around in an atom shop item that hasn’t been available for a long time, likely just an alt.
---
**Ahem*... uh, yes, that’s what I said, friend **cough*.

Turn your xbox off and on again. Log in and you should see it update.

I'm so damn happy about it!
---
Sorry to say, u gotta get good bro. I have no issue soloing earl with my bloodied commando. Take him down with about 15min left. Also solo him with a heavy gunner, combination of AA gauss mini and vamp gauss mini depending on how much health. Also solo with bloodied melee. But stay at about 1/2 health, can’t stay in nerd rage, because one kick would kill me when it lands. Also solo with junkies commando, but with full health it’s kind boaring because there no real risk of anything happening.
---
I'd have to play the update first, then get back to you.
---
1-800 suckmytoes
---
We can cripple the queen hell yeah. I can’t wait to go home
---
If you JUST became neighborly, it’s a ways to go....

I got through about half before servers went down hahaha
---
I'm actually running low dps weapons on my characters, it's more fun this way. If I go with my best gear nothing kills me, not even close, except an eventual poison creature if I'm not paying attention. Nowadays I'm only using top tier weapons if I'm farming xp or score to get things done fast.

"The No C.A.M.P. zone at Fort Defiance has been expanded to include the road in front of Allegheny Asylum to resolve an exploit affecting enemy spawns during the Line in the Sand event."

---
Ah okay, I've not interacted on Reddit that much so I was unfamiliar. 👍
---
I hope that they'll put more people to work on 76 once Starfield launches. the bug fixing team should not take away resources from the new content developing team, IMO.
---
76 has most likely been dealt a bad hand because it happened to be thrown to the wolves during the same period the company is preparing for their first brand new IP since TES Arena, and they don't want to fuck that up since their track record is bad on this aspect (and I read that they did fuck up the launch of Arena almost to its death, so if that's true they are literally trying to give one of their games a good launch for the first time ever), but Starfield doesn't have a successfull history to fall back on, so hopefully once that game is out this one will receive some more attention and care.
---
&gt; - **Fort Defiance:** The No C.A.M.P. zone at Fort Defiance has been expanded to include the road in front of Allegheny Asylum to resolve an exploit affecting enemy spawns during the Line in the Sand event.
---
Is this the reason why some events would have all the scorched plop right above the sonic generator?
---
Yes a magic armoe piece makes any of your weapons magic. Wether they can actually trigger said magic is up to the weapon.
---
112 minutes for me.

That's what she said.

After the new damage calculation 30% more bullets&gt; than 36 extra damage per bullet.
---
"Assassin's now applies to human NPCs" Thank you!
---
Bless you for this. These issues could all be sorted in 2 or 3 days at absolute most. Most are just minor art fixes or file attachments.
---
This would make sense given its other limitations vs lever action. As it stands, there is no reason I can see to use hunting rifle over lever action other than if one doesn't have their preferred legendary attributes for the lever action.
---
I haven’t played in so long, what was so good about it being glitched?
---
Most games use hdr for over saturation like shadow hunters, most look Crap and have nothing to do with what hdr is actually for. Some do and people expect it then to look "better", when in reality it looks more realistic, which isn't always better
---
Luckily my download speed is great. The update takes less than 60 minutes to download.
---
I hate that it takes a lot of time for a PS4 to install the update because it needs to copy a lot of files before installing.
---
Edit: My PS4 shows that the full update size is 30.289 GB.
---
If I'm maxed, I can't lose rep?
---
Haha fuck Ward!

Very nice.
---
Agreed. All you can do is wish upon a star.
---
 **Tank Killer:** Pistols now benefit from the Tank Killer Perk Card.  
---
I like the sound of this
---
The thing that bothers me the most is that you're obviously not a stupid person. Like you get some of the issue but when it comes to things that work counter to your cause, you're suddenly tone deaf and blind to it.
---
Here's a perfect illustration of what I mean - equilibrium. 
---
You're right that we've, for the most part reached equilibrium with the items I referenced i.e. serums, stims, ammo. Well, until we get the option to bulk ammo and then we start over again with that.
---
You're also absolutely right that we're nowhere near equilibrium with legendary items. 
---
The problem though is you're on the side AGAINST equilibrium. Actually, to be more specific, you're on the side that wishes to dictate what the "equilibrium" is to suit your own perspective and biases.
---
Once again I turn to the trusty serums.
---
In the early days people on market place groups, subs and even in this sub to try and dictate what pricing should be for serums. Those prices these traders posted were from 500 up to 2k, with a lot of people trying to push 750-1k.
---
The pricing discussion and market forces on the game servers fought over the price and when the dust settled the average market price ended up being 200-500 caps; a very far cry from what the 3rd party traders were trying to push onto the community being less than half their price range.
---
The problem is that if Fed 76 did pricing for serums during those days, you would have been the very ones trying to push 750-1k (probably with a side note that the right PC buyer would spend up to 2k) when the real market price ended up being 200-500.
---
This is the part you don't see. You're not on the side of market equilibrium. You're actually against it. By the very act of excluding ANY in-game pricing, with all the excuses that you give in order not to do so (too hard, regional variation, laughably undervalued etc.) you misinform people as to what the pricing actually is through the exclusion of very key data.
---
It doesn't matter whether or not you respect the pricing that people sell items in-game, that's where the majority of the prices are set. This data isn't the outlier to be excluded, it's the trading sites you pull from for the data of Fed76 that IS the outlier. 
---
The number of transaction that occur in these walled gardens trading groups are dwarfed by orders of magnitude by in-game player vendors. And this is the set of data you cling to while excluding the data set that dwarfs it.
---
I know you're not that stupid to see that this is what you're doing. You're the guys trying to force serum prices to be 750-1k when the market made it very very clear that this was WAY overpriced. Just like how a lot of veteran players think your current legendary item pricing is ridiculously overpriced.
---
Dude, I implore you to be a force for good. Be the pricing site that reflects the reality of the market as it is, not as you'd like it to be.
---
That's of course easier said than done. However, it's absolutely doable. If we can informally get to equilibrium pricing as a community for stuff like serums, ammo and the like, it's no different with legendaries. The problem is Fed76 actively fights against that by the choices you've made.
---
Or you know what, you keep doing you but at least be transparent enough to state on the Fed76 website how you source your info and how you exclude all in-game prices. Then at least people will not be as misinformed about what Fed76 is really about - dictating pricing for the sole benefit of 3rd party traders. Not providing good pricing information for consumers and the overall community with pricing estimates based on real world pricing but misinformation on prices to benefit the select group of traders in maximising profits.
---
Nothing wrong with maximising profits. It does become a problem though when you do so by misinforming people, and that's sadly what Fed76 does. By your own admission.
---
As for my expectations it's very simple in principle - include a sample of ALL sectors of the market. Of course, as you clearly laid out and I'm more than aware of, this is not an easy task. However, like I demonstrated with serum pricing, we've done it as a community. It's not impossible.
---
How you do it with Fed76? I have ideas but I don't expect it to be a magic bullet because it'll need testing and exploring further for feasibility. However some ideas include:
---
**Price check mod** \- Given how moddable Bethesda games are in general, perhaps there's an avenue whereby you're able to skim the data that is displayed when a player visits a vendor. Mod runs in the background, when they go to open a player's vendor, it captures all that data and that data at some stage gets send to Fed76. 
---
Of course, assuming this is even possible, there are a lot of questions that need to be addressed like how do you make sense of the data, do you average across all the data or pull a random sample, how to deal with people activel skewing the data etc. Not trivial but if you're able to easily skim that data from the game and you get enough players to run this mod, that's a lot of free in-game data to help get to that equilibrium.
---
**Community Submissions** \- Have the community help out with screencaps of vendor pricing, of their own if they want to advertise or of other camps. 
---
**Surveys** \- The simplest way to get something closer to more realistic pricing is to just ask people. Of course you can't do a massive list of every permutation of item and legendary effect and expect people to fill in a survey but there are ways to handle it that can be useful. 
---
You could start with a random sample of items and effects to see what kind of ballpark figure that a buyers think is a good price vs what sellers (not just those wall-gardened traders but all player vendors) would be willing to sell it for. That'd give you the ballpark range for pricing. That's not equilibrium there but it's a start.
---
Alternatively, you could have the option for people to rate pricing on Fed76 for each search that they do. By rate, I don't literally mean score between 1-10 but give the option for people to agree or disagree with the prices and if they disagree, have the option for them to set what they think is a reasonable range. 
---
For the items that get a lot of feedback disagreeing with the pricing that your prices are off, even if that's what the wall-garden folk think it should be. For the items that get a lot of feedback agreeing with that price or zero feedback, you can be confident that that price is either close to what the market will bare or is so unpopular that no one is looking for that item at all. Though I imagine number of search requests for that item will make it clear if it's the former or the latter.
---
**Recruit volunteer contributors** \- Have people contribute to your team by making it their job to go around finding these in-game prices for you. I'm sure that there will be some amount of people who want to be a part of a team to help the community out.
---
Now, I'm not saying any or all of these options are feasible or not. That's not the point I'm making. The point I'm making is that it's very possible to include in-game data if you bother trying to do so and not make preemptive excuses to not include the data. 
---
All that I ask is that you try and include in-game data. It won't be perfect and it'll take some time to get right but it'll be better and more reflective of reality than what is happening now.
---
I got a pet deathclaw in my camp right now, he seems to find ways to kill any traveling merchant that comes to my camp, if I start walking out of my camp he’s been following me, making me have to turn around and bring him back to my camp, however if I fast travel he stays at my camp, don’t think it’s supposed to be working like that right now but hey “it just works”
---
What makes you say that?
---
I’m betting your a vamp build and your super proud that “I never die” but I’m also betting that no mater what anyone says, your build is sooo original, and in practice no one uses it because it’s prolly not that effective.
---
This patch seems very good! Thank you
---
I'd been running through all of the challenges that I never completed for atoms, and working through those badges in the last week or so, I  made a bit of a push to finish them up last night, and I would've finished this one if I hadn't gotten kicked off. I did manage to get everything from the Tadpole vendor, though, so small consolation, I guess. 
---
What all do you have left?
---
Isn’t that the kind of chicken kfc use??
---
What’s the atomic shop
---
Wow, it is pretty useless then. Thanks for the info.
---
No offense to anyone here at all, I truly appreciate reading everyone’s explanations. But this is the dumbest, most confusing perk system ever. Maybe it’ll make more sense in the actual game, and maybe it’s just one of those things that is hard to explain in text. But as a casual 76’er who quit awhile back, this pushes me further away from coming back.
---
Thanks for the heads up, bud.  Gives me a chance to get it downloading now, instead of having to wait after the servers finally come up.
---
If you’re looking for a gun to use yourself because your current one is trash, roll 2 stars. The 3rd effect is usually negligible, unless you get lucky and roll weight reduction or something similar. The first two effects are the meaty bits.
---
If you intend to SELL the outcome (i.e. you run rifles but happen to roll a good minigun) go 3 stars.
---
I’m lvl 405 and my main gun is basically a 2 star I rolled ages ago. These days I exclusively roll 3 stars though.
---
Lol I’ll be emptying out my purveyor sale stash for WEEKS due to the scrip/money cap.  I’m not keeping anything I got from it, all garbage rolls
---
Don’t ever accept random team or party invites.
---
I like that it's only got the one option. Makes it real obvious when I get to someone else's camp if they've got one for me to use. 
---
I'd be okay with it if they add "skins" in the sense of changing color or putting some kind of pattern on it, but I'd rather they didn't change the shape. 
---
That shape = Scrap, any other box = Stash.
---
I love the sarcasm😁👍👍players should know by now
---
Beautiful!
---
Forced all the scorched to spawn in a single area in front of the noise maker... thing.
---
Yeah I was thinking a reverse like that would be an idea.  I couldn't do it though man, mutations were like... the FIRST thing I sorted out on my main after beta.  I just sat in radiation, and cured myself a ton of times (serums were still a long ways off) till I had like 4 mutations I wanted, it took forever, so basically for me normal mode is with high jumps, auto heal, and fast run.  It's so weird to play without them.
---
No more workshop ammo factories, but I will become the ammo factory thru a maxed out perk card today. I'll make ammo for you and gather all that sweet xp from anyone...
---
It Will still be pretty much the best of the best but it's taking about a 50% hit ☹️
---
Only saw it being done a few times, but it caused the scorched to spawn in a big pile in front of the sonic emitter, anyone that had an AOE type weapon was able to tag and rake in huge amounts of XP for very little effort. Anyone that didn't got left out in the cold more or less.
---
Again alot fixed that benefits players....but i wonder how much they will break that we have to wait a month to get fixed
---
So much good stuff in this patch. If I ever get it downloaded, I’m excited to play!
---
Wait a bit longer. I don't think that a lot of people have the update downloaded and installed at the moment.
---
Nope ace bot I even have an 10mm with an 400 range too even shotguns too 😂
---
Why are the downloads always more for ps4? It's like that for most games updates too
---
I have this issue too, also at times the game will turn all sounds off except footsteps and ambiance. No enemy noises, so I have to go off gunshots or the captions. I’m on Xbox one. I don’t think there’s a fix besides trying restarting your game, you just have to deal with it until it fixes itself.
---
Not too worried, I hardly do fighting anymore and fallout 76 really just consists of me building camps. And do you know what the new atomic shop is?
---
and it’s still in Beta... seems like NW isn’t one of their main priorities
---
LET'S GO BABY !!
---
Nice never even thought of it.
---
No I do not.
---
70 minutes left + 3 weeks of copying file . I should be back in October
---
‘Twas a fun grind while it lasted.

Agreed, didn't know that was being implemented!
---

I’m so lost lol I have to take a swimming test and a bunch of pics and I have to do three obstacle courses basically something in every category I wish I just did it a long time ago
---
Lots of nice fixes in addition to the new content!
---
Here's to hoping everything works.
---
&gt;**Vault 51:** We've added a new no-C.A.M.P. zone around Vault 51's exterior in preparation for future content. 
---
🤔
---
Takes more effort to smile than frown so I will pass.
---
I don't mind more challenge. Grinding for ammo may suck though. I played at launch when you could one shot a mob with splash damage across the map with a e shotgun, not fun for long.
---
Also SQB can be crippled again... Amen
---
Is this true for the pick-up Casual and Events teams too?
---
Grinding for score just got a little more tedious
---
Before wastelanders the HDR made the game look noticeably better, in that patch they changed the way the lighting works and the game looks worse with HDR and without. 
---
That's just my opinion though, I remember people raving about the "upgrade" when it came out. I hate it and have basically never gotten used to it lol
---
Did I miss a note about addressing challenge auto completion?  That bug was still around after the last fix.  
---
Also didn’t see where killing the SBQ correctly grants credit for that 80 atom challenge.  Are we at a year for that bug yet?
---
You want my paypal then? Because you're wrong son
---
Sounds fair to me.
---
I am not sure I am understanding you here? Are you asking me if I know new items or the free one this week? I am sorry I do not know :)
---
What? You don't like chasing that robot round the shelves ?? That's the mini game of claiming those tickets.
---
So what wonderfuly original build do you use?
---
Wouldn’t it not make a difference because the mannequins would just take up budget space? I don’t see how it would be different from any other kind of display case.
---
Not worried at all.  My builds are in a good place.   I’ll play a couple days and see where I gotta tweak.
---
Hell yeah. Good thing I'll be able to max legendary luck to get my one gun army back haha. Need class freak since I'm running empath now
---
I’m asking what items replaced the grelok bundle, the grelok bundle left the shop with this update and so I’m curious if there’s a cool new bundle in.

Oh for crying out loud! Next you'll be spouting off about how the 5G scandal is just conspiracy nonsense when we all KNOW the truth! This patch is all part of the grand scheme!! The Democrats and Republicans fighting are just a distraction organized by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet while they roll out their "vaccine" that will GPS tag us and track how we spend our money! Mothman has been trying to warns us since the beginning.
---
It's really weird the lengths they go to in order to just avoid lowering the amount of points required or bumping the actual XP gain for these seasons. Like they are trying to look like they care yet still demanding you better log your ass in everyday.
---
Also "One Wasteland" Well I hope you didn't enjoy feeling like you were growing in strength as you progressed because that's gone now. It sucked in ESO and it's a bad idea here.

Free fast travel to faction towns is extremely welcome; also what’s going on at Vault 51? Possible explorable version incoming? I’m excited.
---
it caused all the scorched to spawn from the sky in a group by the radar and an exploding weapon / tesla could tag them all easily, could be exploited to farm XP
---
Eh, even i have to say i feel pretty down all the time but I can’t say your wrong, as it easier to frown then to be happy either way just try to keep your chin up, you never know when something amazing might just happen.

I hope this is correct, it is how I envision it also

---
A lot of folks in the Wheeling area also use those phrases and have the general blended PA/WV accent. I work with a guy who sounds almost exactly like her, but in a deeper tone. (Probably because Wheeling is one of the border towns.)
---
The Overseer gets close to a southern WV accent, but it sounds faked. I've had better luck with holotapes from the Ash Heap, but only a few sound exactly right.
---
Edit to add: there's about four regional accents that I can think of right off the top of my head. It's interesting because the mountains we're so famous for are actually the reason why we have such varying accents. Southern WV, eastern WV, northwestern WV and central WV all have distinct accents. There's also a few localized accents from people who live in counties far removed from the interstates. We studied it a little in my WV studies class but it wasn't as interesting as some of the other stuff (to everyone else) so we didn't linger on it long.

---
More like the keycard. You know how hard it is to knock down that drone with my favorite rolling pin?
---
And they will NEVER be! It’s like Keven from final space.
---
It wasn't that bad. You could never one shot SBQ or even get close to doing it cause most of the damage output was explosive back when TSE was the meta. Bosses are literally immune to explosive damage. Things changed now and people are actually one shotting bosses cause they stack so much raw damage. One shotting bosses were never the norm, never the standards. Now that damage is getting nerfed and people are experimenting with all sorts of setting and builds, people are finding out current damage calculation is ridiculous and needed nerfed long time ago
---
I'm looking forward to it as well. I enjoy playing games with my kids after work so e nights and my daughter has wanted to play this since I started playing it. She is finally old enough (in my opinion) to play and understand the controls, but couldnt really tag along with me. She is lvl 5 and I'm 202 so even with me tagging along with her the balance wasnt there and it just wasnt very fun and hard to keep either of our attention. Hoping this makes it more enjoyable and opens the game up for us a little more.
---
I started playing it again also when it came to game pass and so far I like it a lot more then at release. There’s not really any pay to win stuff, most stuff in the atom shop is cosmetic. I’ve been having fun and now have a almost level 70 character and I’ve been have a lot of fun. There are still bugs and crashes that are annoying but nothing that stops me from playing.
---
95 minutes for me with 100mb FIOS.  Sucks for people with slow ISPs.

People love to complain here. You'll notice the same usernames over and over. If you're enjoying it play the game, if not, well..
---
Well they have enough ammo to start again. 😂
---
Why would I be jealous of high levels?
---
Indeed it was. I’ll have to look for the police reports.
---
As or more viable than anything else.
---
Just the weapons. The Assassin's armor won't give protection from Human NPC's... Not that it's really needed.

Pay to win doesn’t really exist. You can play the entire game and enjoy everything and not spend one dime after the initial purchase. Really not a ton of bugs nowadays. Most are minor. You may have read about the fast travel bug. People talk about it but really it’s just annoying. No game breaking bugs.
---
&gt;You'll notice the same usernames over and over
---
This
---
RIP. You on Xbox? You use speed demon? Want a free serum?
---
Yes, there is a pistol too
---
Come to find out, a lot of people like it.
---
It's been all over the main screen lol for a while now.
---
I don’t know if you have this already but I’m too lazy to read through them all so, 1. Raider waster PAs left arm takes up tons of the screen when using heavy guns, also clips through the weapon usually. 2. Gatling gun sights are blocked when using the large mag.
---
Also, for the M79 grenade launcher you say no other weapon in the game is named after it’s real life counterpart, the LMG is an exact replica of the MG42, and the plan for it is called the plan: MG42 light machine gun
---
Was hoping for instigating lever action myself. Good get!
---
So no changes to the ammo converter... I'm sad...
---
They are supposed to.  👍
---
Damn, your a wizard.
---
1000 MB fiberglass here, i got max 10 mb/s dowload here. Theirs servers might have serious issue with all those people dowloading at once.
---
Yes.  It was crazy, crazy fun!
---
/s means sarcasm for those uninitiated.  I say this as one who did not know this for actually quite a while after using Reddit/Internet.  😂
---
3 minutes for nuke and 3 minutes waiting for event to start.
---
You still had 4 minutes you could of solo'd it no problems.
---
it will feel like forever, but probably until 1pm Eastern Standard Time.
---
Does it work for black powder Pistol? I have a AAE one.
---
Quad shotguns are fun, with double barrels being very powerful. More so iwith the +vats hit chance. 1 shots Earle's minions, and most SBQ ad spawns. Crits on bosses do damage. We have 2 man'ed Earle. Shotguns only. Not a quick fight, but very fun.
---
Im sorry I do not know.
---
Damn, I was hoping they would fix adrenaline this update.
---
Lmao. If I had to name it, then maybe "Elastigirl" because "it's flexible".
---
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
---
Yes, it will still be viable after the patch, based on all we've heard from the folks on the public test servers.
---
I think something we should all keep in mind is that One Appalachia is only just now being rolled out, and the changes that are made will be somewhat fluid for the foreseeable future.  It's quite possible that the various buffs and nerfs for given Legendary weapon perks, including Bloodied, will be subject to change in future patches.  
---
IMHO, though, Beth will most likely *not* relax any potential nerfs on Bloodied any time soon.  Whether it remains the generally-accepted top-of-the-heap build over the long term is not at all guaranteed.
---
Sounds fair, it’s a glitch
---
Makes sense then
---
I didn't get my TV until after Wastelanders
---
Hope they enjoy their ammo tho 🙏🙏🙏 (sarcasm)
---
Adrenaline?
---
Alrigh Bethesda, this update is the best one to date (personal opinion). Please dont fuck it up!
---
This is also a great achievement for the trolls who would join teams and place them at victims camps.
---
Great way to level up your high level character. It will be missed by me for sure.
---
Damn, i bought mine for 13k. Being a clothing collector I couldn't pass it up.
---
Weird. I really dont like it lol
---
ignore everything and just play. make your own mind up. I have nearly 1600 hours in the game. I love it.  People are always gonna complain about stuff. 
---
Lots of things got fixed. Some things got broken. And they're busy adding a massive update which is gonna change a lot of things and whiny clownshoes are gonna be flooding the boards in a few hours because it now takes them 3 bullets to kill something instead of 1.
---
I mean junkies has a right to bitch because they have a downside, where as AA doesn't
---
Farewell old friend it was good while it lasted
---
oh no, this really was my favorite event.
---
They usually release a separate article on the website after new Atomic Shop content is added and accessible to purchase.
---
Thanks wasn’t paying attention to usernames, I’m only level 10 but so far really enjoying it just wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to get blindsided by some structural issues later on
---
It won't though. It's just the weapons, and the buff is very small
---
I don’t even want to remember what it was like to reload weapons before fireworks...RIP to the best season 1 feature.
---
When the Thunderpipe skin is applied? If so then I think it's already fixed in this build. If you've got a pic of that Waster PA in first person then send it over.
---
What was the glitch?
---
I was fine with it on the PTS, and that was with my secondary pc account using heavy weapons but no heavy perks (the build is a complete mess)
---
Very much looking forward to finally playing it on my primary account.
---
Finally, we can force her to land!
---
Did anyone on PTS say specifically which S1 rewards were in gold store?  I know they said about lunchboxes and some of the other items but don’t recall seeing anyone give a full listing or state the full S1 reward list being available.  Would be cool to have all the cosmetics there.
---
They couldn't possibly have allowed it for season 2...SOOOOOO many repeatable SCORE
---
Yeah but you build those once or twice and then never again, so I was meaning once that's done (like I have) its useless unless you build bullets with it
---
Yeah at level 380 I could damn near get a full level off the event if the spawn were high enough
---
Edit, without any xp buffs (other than inspirational)
---
Adrenaline in Nuclear Winter is still broken.
---
Thanks for context I was enjoying game and then confused when I got on reddit to see all these negative posts wanted to make sure there wasn’t something I was missing
---
Laught in junkie build. It is better to tule in hell them be noone in heaven.
---
Still being worked on.
---
Yeah I'm a bit confused about this as well. What if you have a level 100 and a level 10 player teaming up and they face off against Deathclaw. If they stand next to each other and fire at him obvs the level 100 player is gonna take it down in a few shots while the level 10 player is gonna need a lot more rounds. How will that look on screen for the lv100 player after he killed it, will it look to them like the lv10 player is just standing there firing into thin air? And from the lv10 player perspective will it look like lv100 is just standing there doing nothing or rushing ahead cuz to him it's dead??   so sorry if this is a stupid question? :)
---
Looking forward to the changes,
---
You are for the most part correct which is why people will change. AA has diminishing returns on low armored mobs. Right now I am not sure of a mob where that would matter though as most high hp mobs have high armor. It’s really only cannon fodder mobs that have low armor.
---
Overall I think it will come down to what’s the best weapon you have on hand. It’s a very easy swap as there shouldn’t be an perk card differences between a junkies build and an AA build.
---
23 gb... actually I don't know if I have enough space in my ssd drive :S
---
i have a gauss shotty and have all the shotgun perks. enforcer 3. skeet shooter 3. demolition expert 5. 1 adrenaline. 1 gun fu (underrated perk for shotties). If something didn't die it was usually crippled.
---
You couldn't do that on a public team though... So if you private team with a stranger, that's on you...
---
Gatling Gun Gang All Day

BEEF CAKE!!!!
---
31.33GB on Xbox.
---
10 minutes to download , here 
---
Still copying currently
---
*exploited
---
Don't know about ps4 but in Xbox there is a slider where you can change from 50/50 sound effects and music to what ever percentage you want of each.
---
People love to complain. There are some bugs but they are not game breaking, a few are just annoying. If you play the game a lot, you end up looking past them. I personally like the game but I really love the people and friends that I get to meet and play with. If you enjoy the game, play to your hearts content. If you dont like the game, dont force yourself to play.
---
"Exploit: Items can no longer be stacked on objects that are in disrepair."
---
I get why they fixed this but still sad.
---
Yes that was an exploit. 
---
When a Fallout1st tent was placed were the scorched were supposed to spawn, they actually spawned over the generator.
---
I don’t have a picture of the waster PA currently but after I’m done downloading the update I can send a few. Also i didn’t know the thunder pipe was fixed, however it also used to happen even without the paint applied so that might still be an issue after the update
---
Yes. You could block their normal spawn zone with a Fallout 1st tent.
---
Mass XP.  I was getting 3000+ XP per shot with a level 10 grenade launcher (using that to insure other players could get in damage for their XP)
---
The glitch would cause the scortched to spawn in a tight 10' radius directly in front of the sonic generator.
---
Now that it's gone, I can say... When you died and got to the map where you have to choose where to respawn, you'd shut the game off through the console dashboard (not through the game itself) and when you logged back in, the stats of Unyielding would be doubled (+6 to all SPECIAL but END, instead of +3).
---
Thought they changed that as well.
---
They supposedly made it so when one member of a team initiates PvP, it does not automatically include the other team members in that fight.
---
Or do you mean that the rules of workshops are different than standard pvp?
---
I know, the default HDR setting in FO76 is tricky. I’m also using ps4 pro on a sony TV, when I first hook them up I was like ‘shit what am I looking at’ lol
---
The last several times I've played it, we've just played it normally. Still fun.
---
I spend most my day upvoting anyone who get downvoted unless they are been total arse holes.
---
I haven't even seen the small rewards like lunchboxes? I'm guessing it was a PC thing first?
---
Not everyone was super aware of the differences. Some people don’t care to read the updates and skim reddit.
---
I mean yeah it’s their fault, but ignorance isn’t unrealistic.
---
18.6 gig of bugs! (Steam)
---
so whats the best legendary perk to pick first?
---
so they made line in the sand suck again, 
---
cant use the campfire trick anymore for crops
---
cant glitch stuff through each other by breaking the first thing  (think that is what they mean by items cant stack on things that are in disrepair)
---
tnx for fixing stuff that nobody wanted fixing Beth...
---
well atleast SBQ will land again (but we'll see about that)
---
That event is going to be dead as Dillinger now.
---
Good thing I haven’t beaten got yet. Time to slice and dice.
---
the park card.. think it's under agility
---
Not complaining, I spent all day yesterday downloading the game, and saw the little note saying maintenance. Never played this fallout before, and it's pretty fun. Looking forward to maintenance being done and being able to play.
---
Game is being updated. Servers will be offline for a few hours.
---
You can get force a similar effect by standing in a certain place. They can't stop people standing.
---
I'll see if I can get a screenshot this weekend, but the Brotherhood of Steel Fatigues seems to have an issue with the underarmour clipping through it.
---
The game is certainly still more relevant than The Outer Worlds - the game that was supposed to kill Bethesda Fallout...
---
Starting to feel in a loop. In a loop of stupidity.
---
Read carefully dude. I'm not maxing Charisma, only Str/Per/Int and Luck. Not sure where you pulled Charisma from. Also dude, I can move points to make a 12 a 10 and still fully benefit from the +5 card...hence why I said I could pull of the stat array. I'm not sure what you're thinking here, but you're not getting the entire picture. You might want to read carefully.
---
Also, the Legendary Perks (Str/Per/Luck/Int) plus Master Infiltrator still leaves me a slot to play with.
---
I get there are damage debuffs to enemies, but the testing from PTS shows most mobs still die in 1 or 2 shots. You have to either attack or get attacked for the debuff to proc. Which means it's really only necessary for most boss fights.
---
Just download the game again. Patch is like 30gbs anyways so you just need to download like 36 extra gigabytes for the whole game. It less stress
---
Cheers, added to the list.
---
Definitely excited about playing with people so far I’ve been a lone wanderer really glad to see the game isn’t filled with griefers
---
perk.. lol
---
THEY BROKE MUH BOY!
---
But seriously, shame on us for repeatedly 'soft-exploiting' a bug for so long and getting used to it. HOWEVER, it wasn't hurting anyone and was a great bug. RIP in Pepperonis.
---
18.6 GB on Steam.
---
Assuming you don't have an issue with disk space, could have nothing to do with you at all.
---
Try restarting the client. If that doesn't do anything, just wait. I'm still preallocating too right now.
---
The only leeway I can give is that Reddit has to have the worse internal search I have ever seen on any site ever. It is at least 99.9% completely useless.
---
You just made me think: why are floaters in the ground? If they float, they should be up in the trees! Imagine how fun that would be in the forest and the mire, dropping down to attack rather than acting like mole rats.
---
Im pretty certain any error you get related to ping has nothing to do with the Drive that you have it on,
---
For that matter I don’t think I’ve ever had an error like that on Bethesda Net launcher or steam so maybe it’s something to do with the Xbox game pass? Maybe try a VPN see what happens
---
exploit still works at swarm of suitors event at grafton lake.
---
With one wasteland and the increased creature levels i think this event will be well attended a lot more now
---
that hasn't been my experience at all.
---
Saddddddd
---
What the hell why are the servers down couldn't they have warned us about this?! Why am I gettting messages that looks like I've been banned?! Why is every enemy so hard. TOOOOODDDD!!! I hate you!
---
I will try all of this but I have had the error for a couple of days
---
Yep.
---
They lied to me. I thought the most important thing were the friends you made along the way.
---
Should be thankful they ain't banned. You still have them extra ammo so no reason to be pissed
---
Noooooo you bastardsssssss!!!! 
---
Farewell, my old friend :-(
---
Many of those would be wayyyy too op, like the radstag or nanny
---
While I have obviously seen the downvotes, I have yet to meet anyone who was angry or just an asshat. I havent been griefed in game. As a matter of fact, the most angry I've ever seen anyone is myself yesterday when I got pissed off at the mclintock obstacle course but, someone came and helped me. Many people offered. Try the wow and EverQuest private server communities. Those people are beyond toxic.
---
They will have to build new ones
---
The were in the atomic shop I think
---
I play stealth shotgunner/rifleman. For shotty I use (all maxed) shotgunner, expert shotgunner, master shotgunner, scattershot, skeet shooter, bloody mess. I also use perks to maximize VATS and stealth because shottys are better in VATS. If you have an explosive shotty you'll want to max demolition expert as well (although with the new patch this may not be the case).
---
4. A way for a cannibal to get a free buffet after a sacrifice.
---
Because we are vegan, their eggs. Our (their) shit.
---
The update is 31.3;gb for me for some reason (xbox one)
---
I remember when the game launched I had a hell of a time with fast travel and would sometimes just end up with a black screen :p
---
It’s very Bethesda to fix an exploit that wasn’t hurting anyone and helped reduce the grind, while leaving lots of issues that do hurt people alone
---
I didnt give it much thought in all honesry. Just went about my normal business, with just a slight thought that things will likely be different today.
---
I was more sentimental the day before Wastelanders though. Then I really did just wander about knowing things would be a whole lot different the next day, knowing that there would be new places and other humans about. It was kind of strange knowing the place wouldn't be quite as empty as it was.
---
To be real it does say servers down for maintenance when logging in and a simple search online will yield the answer - though I would add in something like downtime likely to be 3-4 hours or more just so people have an idea of when they MIGHT be able to get back online.  Reddit and the Internet in general would be a much neater place if the same questions and answers were not posted by every other person.  Kind of like the people who have an electronics problem who haven’t tried restarting their device first.  That solves probably &gt;50% of problems just like searching would answer &gt;50% of the questions asked in a matter of minutes.  I agree being condescending isn’t the nicest but some people need that to stop being lazy.
---
Yes. Whole game drags on pro after the legendary run update. Was smooth as silk prior
---
Like for real I only put the coop down for the looks. I already get more than enough fertilizer from the Brahmin and she gives me milk too.
---
people are more likely to tell you about a bad experience they've had with something than a good one.
---
20.3gb on pc
---
Based on every single previous major update there will be a other major dupe exploit within 24hrs 😂
---
Damn that's a lot of fixes and new stuff good job Bethesda... I can't wait to jump online later ..
---
Man, my favorite thing lately has been rejecting the event, jumping into the mosh pit, and then ganking any players who didn't enable pacifist mode. Oh well.
---
Lots of posts pop up here from people who finally take the dive and are surprised how much they love it. .Low expectations just make it even better.
---
Nothing has changed. Perks still do all the same stuff.
---
Shotguns are bugged though, not sure if they always were.
---
You're better off with FFR shotgun over Explosive because you will be damaging yourself if you want to do any damage and it breaks the gun super fast.
---
Yay! I honestly hated that. Me and my friends would go to it, abc someone would soon show up and drop their tent down.
---
While I appreciate flexibility, all that really means is your not optimized. I’m hopping todays patch adds some difficulty, because I’ve had to resort to playing “naked” with crafted weapons in most situations to even have a chance at dieing.
---
They will be an Atomic Shop item.
---
Only thing that would piss any of the guys with ammunition factories is to erase the whole camp.if they need to rebuild the whole thing they just wont move it right?
---
Exactly how I'm feeling and thinking. This is not a stupid question at all. These are some of the things I'm trying to figure out as well. Just how is it all going to work?
---
I'm concerned that the NPCs in some events won't be set up for the damage they're suddenly receiving. I once loaded into Morgantown to find Steelheart was in motion and then watched him get one-shotted by a level 62 Charred Feral. Didn't know they could spawn there and never seen one since, but the idea that some events might suddenly be broken stuck with me.
---
Getting ammo will be easier. The ammo factory legendary perk stacks with ammosmith, many people will be able to craft double the amount of ammo. Also enemies will mainly drop the ammo you used on them. Since the game felt way to easy i personally dont worry as long as everything works out( kinda)
---
Good list of game fixes.
---
Hope they fixed more than they broke.
---
The easy XP was the reason most people loved this exploit. I loved it because all the bodies were in the same place and it super easy to loot. It was very convenient for my lazy ass.
---
IDK it all depends on how easily they die
---
Haha you’re right, everyone is always so nice in game. I try to be as nice as possible to players too, it make the game better for everyone. Also, fuck that obstacle course! I hated that mission
---
Oompfh not looking good then. Cheers for heads up
---
Damn rip to all those bases with the blueprinted ammo factory I saw in them lmao. Gotta grind for that Raider reputation for the ammo maker
---
Merry Patchmas!!!
---
Fast travel bug?
---
Gauss VATS bug?
---
And when are we again be able to see the team leader active quest?
---
Thanks man but I'm good 😊 - I stumble over those carrier vertibots all the time lol
---
I believe you mean *VERY sloooooowly.*
---
See ya next week
---
username checks out
---
She gave me an AA Fixer, Earle gave me an Instigating Fixer, and SBQ gave a Furious Fixer. All in the same session.  
---
I didn't want to peel myself away from that server, but had to work :'(
---
It will erase it. “Anyone with an annoying factory in their camp will receive a camp can’t be placed notification”
---
Holy shit, what an enormous update! I haven't seen any online multiplayer game ever have such a gigantic update, hopefully the pros far outweigh the cons.
---
Sounds fair.
---
Now... how many reddit post will be born with the subject from cheaters?
---
🤔👉👈 my username??
---
No fix for the lighting and reflection bug on all amd navi graphics cards. After months, this is ridiculous.
---
I will miss the lighting fast reload from the Fireworks. Dammit
---

EXCITED
---
Hence the note :)
---
Fixed the Tesla Rifle causing poor framerates! THANK YOU 👍🏼
---
A pet assualtron huh?
---
To be honest I would love to be able to craft a robot and travel with it but I guess that'll just stay in FO4.
---
WOOOOOO
---
Gotcha magic quad = fun
---
[WHAT?!!?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsJc2ZhbXIg)
---
For anyone looking for how long it will last, I would expect at least 3-4 hours.  Iirc the last one was 5-6 hours as they ran into some issues.  I tend to check in 30-60 minute intervals starting around hour 3 if I’m bored and have nothing better to do, but likely someone will post when it’s back online so that the rest of us don’t have to pace around the computer/console while trying to log in every 10 seconds.  Also, you will probably be able to update and even have the update completed before they have the servers back online so just because YOUR update may be completed doesn’t mean you can start playing again as that is just the client side, not the server side.
---
ah ok. still not much better. my peak speed is 1gb/hr
---
&gt; **Tank Killer:** Pistols now benefit from the Tank Killer Perk Card. 
---
I think this is a little BS in terms of the flavour of the card but good to see that pistol builds got another piece to add to their build.
---
When was this patch? I started playing not so long ago.
---
Dude, as I said in my post: im here to play fall out not Goddamn Mario 64. It wouldn't have been so bad if the responders quest chain didn't have a similar quest.
---
My head hurts reading this
---
Falloutbuilds.com
---
Go to that website, find a build you like and adjust to it. From what your saying, you just need a good build, guessing your perks are all over the place.
---
Lol not to mention anyone with a ammo factory will lose there base all together. Sucks for them.
---
My hunter's fancy revolver is so pretty.   😁  that's why it sits on a display by my door.
---
I can be angry and still have fun.
---
I’ll have to brush up on my Angry Turtle videos.  Most of the time, at least one other person is teamed with me, so there really isn’t a downside.  If I’m suddenly the only team member, it’s pretty easy to join another group or server hop.
---
haven't seen that one before, where's the best spot for a tent up there?
---
Scattershot and skeet shooter...I didn’t add Blocker until after lvl 250ish... wish I’d had it as soon as it was available. I think I might be one of the few who doesn’t use Enforcer. If you’re gonna run v.a.t.s., 4 Leaf Clover
---
"Primal Cuts: During the final wave of Prime Beasts, players are now only required to kill the boss to complete the event."
---
Holy shit, that's fantastic.
---
Fallout Radio on Spotify
---
No one ever placed the ammo factory in their own camp. It was always "my friend and/or random teammate placed it without telling me" 🤪
---
No... It didn't...
---
Ive never seen any of these bots before
---
Hahahahaha true. You made me think of DMV quest, doing that was surreal, I was screaming the same thing “I CAME HERE TO PLAY A GAME GOD DAMNIT”
---
Wrong
---
Cool.    Just curious. I haven’t read anything on update.  Will they add camp budget for these?
---
I still play it, I don’t care for the exploit
---
Thanks, I'll check it out.
---
you don't have to be idle =0
---
It's a constant reminder while you're hiding in your camp instead of going out into the wasteland that you're chicken shit.
---
Four or five people with legacy energies + line in the sand glitch = really fun 8 bit pixel game!  My favorite part was the server crashes!
---
It was fun blasting the whole batch with an explosive gat plasma.
---
I just want the player trading menu to let us actually trade... :(
---
Are there any patch notes?
---
&gt;**Exploit:** Items can no longer be stacked on objects that are in disrepair.
---
Well, if I understood this correctly, there goes another CAMP building technique...
---
PC (Bethesda.net): 1.4.0.20 (23.3 GB)
---
PC (Microsoft Store): 1.4.0.20 (37.8 GB)
---
PC (Steam): 1.4.0.20 (27.5 GB)
---
PS4: 1.4.0.20 (35.2 GB)
---
Xbox: 1.4.0.20 (42.6 GB)
---
PTS = player test server = PC only.  After this update completes those rewards will be available on all versions assuming they “passed” the final PTS patch and Bethesda decided to make them live.
---
Yeah it sounds like it's going to hit any kind of 'build' hardest as they're more dependent on stacking damage bonuses, if all your damage is just coming from having high damage weapons and then stuff that doesn't directly buff damage such as AA then it should be a lot less of a nerf.
---
until we get more budget i'm not displaying any weapons. I would like to have a proper trophy room
---
my head hurts how people play this game after years of neglect and what 3 major updates since release yeah no thi game had more than enough chances and ive played since beta what is legit there to do run around launch nukes on earle and queen?? yeah no thanks look at their eso so much content and just a new dlc fallout is somethint they gave up on and are putting minimum effort not just my voice look through the community youll see this game is hot garbage and just a excuse sorry not sorry
---
Cool story bro
---
The only thing I got from your post is that I want Bethesda to have Bessie the Sentry Bot outside of The Wayward to say “smooth mooth.”
---
Mildly intrigued
---
GET
---
Still gonna be hot garbage with the nerf unfortunately.
---
You're absolutely right. However, my good gent, you have forgotten to consider the variable of me being fucking awful at video games in your equation.
---
Sorry but your wrong. More so you play the game wrong because you clearly think cheating is the way to play the game. 
---
It old hearing players like you.
---
They made some camps unplaceable, like with the ammo factory. If they do that with other legacy stuff....
---
Not sure if that's today though.
---
The said ammo converter that's one I remember them saying specifically
---
Brutally honest opinion of my experience is....as much as i love the fallout franchise, i couldnt, and/or wouldnt play this game if i didnt periodically get fallout 1st. Im not complaining about 1st, the price, etc. Im happy the scrap box is there.
---
Playing without it just wasnt as fun to me. Managing my stash between gear and junk was a pain. When i explore, i want to loot. So now every cpl of months ill get 1st to clear my stash of junk.
---
The game is way better now, than before. I rarely have issues with lag, disconnects etc. Wastelanders to me made the game more enjoyable, and now that ive experienced a mp fallout i can say i hope future fallouts have a mp aspect to. I have about 650ish hrs in the game, and there isnt anything that hinders my enjoyment. Excited for the patch today!
---
With daily ops it most likely will be another dead event. The amount of time it takes isn’t worth the rewards to me. That and I have to mute the game because the siren sound.
---
No no the little buff public team things are okay
---
since there is nothing in the patch notes I assume that this exploit still works with "swarm of suitors".
---
If you consider that the levels of the enemies are adapted to the players, it is not quite as effective as "line in the sand" but it is still quite good to farm
---
I think we will kill a lot of Mirelurks in the future
---
Nooooooo I was literally just about to make a design for a fist-fight pvp arena at one of those cargobot landing platforms they have at a few workshops. RIP to my dreams :(
---
Go away
---
True :) I already see a subject like this: "a friend of mine placed 99998 Ammo Factory at my camp and Bughesda is forcing me to rebuild. I will cancel my F1st!"
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAH
---
Yes it did. Now shut up about how you’re a terrible player.
---
Man, I've been noticing that whenever I'm in an interior such as West-tek, my headlamps/Pip-light have such a powerful glow on them. Really overbearing. Especially when I get close to walls, everything is almost white and way too bright. I wondering if this has something to do with the HDR. Anyone else experiencing this, any tips??
---
They need to add them to Foundation, Crater, and at the Train Station Vendors.
---
So did the dozens of times the scorched randomly got stuck behind trees or the wall and you had to spend half the time jumping around like a kangaroo trying to find the one last enemy of the wave glitched out somewhere...
---
I wasn't sure if this meant they'd get that notice upon loading into a server or just if they try to move camps?  I guess we'll see a lot of posts about "unable to load camp" if that's the case 😂
---
I saw that in uranium fever. Got it recorded, crazy shit.
---
Edit: I'm not responsible for this, and I'm working on a short video to show the spawns but I don't know how to make it happen.
---

---
Okay...queen can be crippled but I didn’t see anything about Earle glitching into the ground or ceiling
---
You take advantage of a glitch then you complain when bethesda punishes you for doing so?
---
I see no problem with this, they never said you couldn't rebuild.  Using the ammo factory was an exploit and people who did should have some sort of consequence for doing so, be thankful someone like me isn't in charge or it would have been a permanent hardware ban.
---
Or use  fireproof and never worry about explosive damage.
---
Some online game models give huge buffs, lots of carrying capacity, and way better gear to subscribers and make the game very difficult for those who don’t subscribe, even if there’s is no “winning” the endgame you have to pay to enjoy the game. But from others comments it seems that the benefits of subscribing are primarily cosmetic which is good to hear
---
What about it? I'm ignorant to that event
---
Blueprinting stuff = "cheaters"
---
Not sure I like what I read about the change to Concentrated Fire rank 3 perk...better not mess with the accuracy...it wasn’t OP to begin with
---
&gt;	They gave up on
---
As we get large update
---
Same I bought fallout 1st for the private servers for this reason lol.  Now I'm a lvl 43 so I can go ALMOST anywhere at this point, so ot doesnt matter for me anymore... But this will definitely help out new characters a lot
---
THATS THE SPIRIT WOOOOOOOOO (I’M IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I actually enjoyed that quest. I did it last night. It's supposed to be humorous with all the shit you have to do. My favorite quest thus far is nuka Cola inoculation quest where you get to chose the name of the nuka Cola. "Nuka-Cola: Its Got My Blood In It!" First time in the whole series where I laughed do hard I cried. Just thinking about it still makes me chuckle.
---
ha
---
Come on dude don't make your argument all in your title have some class il fix it for you
---
TITLE 
---
Having a ammo factory makes it so your whole camp cant be placed, people on community are cancelling fallout 1st and eso plus now
---
ACTUAL POST
---
smooth mooth bethesda hurt a camp for your own glitches seems about right anyways i havnt even played this hot garbage in a while so many better games 😅😅
---
There my head hurts less now thank you for choosing vault tech and have a nice day
---
Lmao. Damn. Not going to lie I got really close to talking myself into putting one at my camp...glad I didnt go through with it.if camps are being erased there will be alot of comments on here in a few hours
---
I've got that pistol, my first legendary rifle, and 2 other weapons on display.   Now stuffed animals are another story... I may or may not have all the bears and all the normal sized fuzzies in display.  But yeah, all together they weigh less than a rifle.   At some point they recently increased the max number of  displays from 20 to 30?
---
And pretty much immune to the queens “sonic attack” thingee...don’t know what it’s called 🤣
---
Learn the difference between "your" and "you're" first.
---
Sometimes stuff gets added to the game files months in advance, just look at how long the lunchbox models and animations have been around.  Personally I think the mannequins and PA display will come with the instanced camp interiors so they don't have to worry as much about build budget.
---
Mmm maybe but I am kinda welcoming it, it's going to be easier for high levels like myself to level up now, also it will be more challenging I might have to shoot them twice instead of once now lol.
---
Iv only seen this happen once and it was only me and me other person every other time there’s ton of people so I don’t think it’ll be that bad
---
Using exploits and cheats are CLEARLY the wrong way to play. So here you are, wrong again. You’re cheating. That’s wrong. You even fucking agreed to NOT cheat before you even played the game once.
---
And So you’re a cheater, a liar, and not someone to trust.
---
And while that seems extreme over a game. Experience tells me that how people act in one thing, carries over to other aspects of that persons life.
---
And this proves it. You’re literally trying to get me to accept cheating and exploits as ok and even right.
---
The level 100 player sees a level 100 enemy and the level 10 player sees a level 15 enemy. So during the fight each player would theoretically take the same number of shots to defeat the enemy. The level numbers given are not accurate and intended to illustrate the concept.
---
forcing spawns has been around since day one. This was just the most popular and was often triggered by accident. 
---
And people were doing it without a tent before tents were a thing.
---
Unless they cut investigating damage in half to start it would be way too powerful.  Of all the perks Instigating on most weapons is the least broken and in need of a fix.  Executioners is pretty much garbage except vs bosses at the very end.
---
This is the build im running currently. I run a bloodied Gauss shotgun. Feel free to ask any questions :)
---
Edit: I have a few VATS perks in there, becuase the Gauss shotgun ( or well, almost all shotguns ) does tons of damage in VATS. So basically, I am a VATS shotgun build.
---
[Bloodied Gauss Shotgun Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c433dab&amp;d=sd2sp2so2sb2p00pc2eh2ck0ce0i11ib4ir2s12a72a80a04a30l12lu2lt2l71&amp;n=Bloodied%20Gauss%20Shotgun)
---
I’m glad this fix is in place. Causing this spawn glitch caused my game to lag real hard. Plus all the peeps with OP overkill explosive weapons would hog all the kills/xp. Very frustrating overall.
---
No, but why does it matter, you can't play anyway.
---
RIP to the most hilarious exploit I've ever seen. Watching the clump drop and having two people with launchers open up... bodies and chunks and explosions flying everywhere... so damned funny.
---
Rip the fireworks bug. That thing was awesome.
---
i started playing in feb this year . now at 1.5k hours in game and 3 characters over 200 
---
personally im loving the bloodied (shotgun/heavy gun/melee) build i have made on my newest character, can change between those perks to what i need at the moment 
---
the enforcer perk saved my butt more times then i can count (shotgun perk that cripples mobs) and its coming in handy with earl ( a boss for a event no spoilers)
---
Learn what a typo is. Phones change words all the time.
---
Moron
---
Same here , finished downloading soon but then its the 7 week copying file left lol . Well atleast i should be ready until servers are up lmao
---
Exactly this... Turn off HDR
---
This is the bitch and moan sub. Filthy casuals is the funtime enjoy yourself sub. If you join both it gives you a reasonable idea of what to expect.
---
3214
---
Where is Karen we need the manager to get servers back
---
They fixed it in a way that didn't harm their projected revenue...
---
Guys ive never left my raider bot alone this long.  I really hope he doesnt burn my camp down :( lol
---
Do stupid things win stupid prizes.   I think they are getting off light but \*shrugs\*
---
I was able to level up multiple times in one go because of that and I was already level 280+ the xp amount was insane.
---
Because my school ends in 1-2 hours and I wanted to know if I’d be able to play once I’m done for the day?
---
What does this update do again?
---
I still can't fast travel or respawn and this is the shit they decide to devote their time too?  Horse poopy
---
Haha yeah I never had the auto complete bug.
---
But I feel you on the SBQ atom one I've killed like 50 of them by know I should be rewarded
---
Idk where this came from but it’s sounds like an epic battle speech so I LIKE IT! LET’S GO!
---
yup, now it's going to be just another empty event like Project Paradise again.
---
What? Why are the servers down??
---
as a PTS player I wish you all luck (hits button and locks bunker door)
---
no seriously its actually not so bad your not a unkillable monster but you also aren't soooooooooo bad weak to be unplayable so long as you can read perk cards
---
I was more inquiring about pay to win not implying that it was the case. Many of the posts from when Fallout 1st subscription model was announced mention boycotting the subscription and the game turning into “pay to win” I’d have to go back for specific posts but it seems unnecessary as many ppl have now informed me that it’s not pay to win
---
3 and then 1
---
score will come naturally
---
Farming lead. So hard to keep .45 ammo when trying to level to 50
---
I hope we can go inside.
---
At his level it’s likely that he did the quest to go in that room before they added tickets. I had no idea where to turn them in for awhile because after the quest there was no reason to go back there.
---
Score first, then perks.
---
Crater/Foundation Quest givers will start walking around again.
---
Wow this is a lot of work, amazing
---
You used "you're" correctly!!!! Have a Nuka Cola on the house!
---
1. Check weapon damage 
---
2. Check Magic weapons 
---
only after this the rest mentioned above😂
---
Ok, thanks! I will try this.
---
They sneakily mentioned that there's more vault 51 content coming
---
It is pretty easy to avoid and ignore.
---
The 1st subscription is def worth it if you plan to play long term. You can buy it monthly or yearly. There is an unlimited scrap box you get and that alone makes it worth it, not to mention the other stuff they provide with it. The only sort of drawback is that weight management is part of the survival aspect of the game. What can I afford to drop? What can I absolutely not? Takes a tiny bit of the strategy away but increases the fun. Idk.
---
Grrrr. The dreaded nerf
---
Don’t forget to get the Ammo legendary perk before you craft!
---
Have you downloaded the update yet?
---
Does it really reduce the damage that much? 
---
I still find the points could be used for a lot more useful perks.
---
Before the update had a bloodied pump shotgun pretty much 1 hit scorched beasts. had all 3 ranks of shotgunner, expert and master. 2 in scattershot. 4 Adrenaline. 3  Nerd Rage. underrated Shotgun legendary is Vat hit chance. tried explosive and FFR but still couldn’t reliably 1 shot stuff until i found a 33% Vat
---
Then ask in 1-2 hours?
---
That’s the glaring problem with social media and the way people obtain information today. The loudest sexiest news/opinions get all the views/likes/exposure and therefore seem to be popular opinion.
---
But in reality it’s all bs,for clicks views likes ect. Stay away from buying into ANYTHING you see on social media. The fallout 76/outer worlds stupidity is a direct example.
---
Level 1 legendary perks

Aw I thought it was also armor

They will have to rebuild their camps
---
Nice.
---
My Legacy Mansion u mean...I have no filthy measly hoarder floaty peasant camp. Didn't use the stack method for anything so I'm good.
---
No, but from past experience my Xbox can download the large update in at most 5min
---
Pfft, filthy casual. I'm watching the progress bar the whole time.
---
3
---
Why did this get down voted?
---
the whole damn game is still in beta beefcake
---
Yes! I doubt they would do such, but I would gladly pay some atoms for a good ole praise.
---
I've played it. It's fun and difficult but easily doable if you have a coordinated team
---
Im an Xbox player too will definitely add you but I feel like I’m still too weak to go play with others lol
---
Hahahaha! Come on ! It's bethesda of course you will end up finding bugs everywhere ;)
---
[Hey, kids! It’s me - Mr. Period!](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/07/07)
---
It’s not pay 2 win, but I do agree the scrap box shouldn’t be part of 1st. They over-swung if you ask me. Anyway it’s not a huge deal.
---
Adults proofread before they submit things
---
Same. Last week i saw some dumb idiot that had 5 of those damn things in their camp - fuck knows why, not like it's hard to gather supplies.
---
I rly wanna know my dmg. I used a bloodied fire axe since the cooking event and it was my go to weapon since everything feels tanky (I'm lvl 80 something....) and I dont have the perk cards or the weapons for any other build. I play since 2 months or so, pls don't fuck me in the ass.
---
Yes and it is life-changing.
---
Hopefully it will still have the phantom budget.
---
Thanks going to go join filthy casuals
---
Beefcake? Me? Thx I guess, lol
---
I was playing around on pts and got to say these are nice quality of life perks to look into
---
survival shortcut is amazing gives you a item once every 30 or so mins 100% food 100% water cures all diseases and heals you
---
what rads - slowly heals radiation and gives rad shielding - with rad shield chem it basically lets you walk around naked in a nuke zone if its maxed and its just magic with ghoulish
---
i dont see any NW updates in the notes, go figure.
---
SBQ lol but yeah thats amazing
---
Really hope it's NW related. NW needs an update bad.
---
Fuck
---
&gt;dead as Project Paradise
---
FTFY
---
No fun police strikes again :(
---
&gt; • Armor: The Pocketed Mod for the Raider Chest Piece no longer incorrectly grants more carry capacity than the Deep Pocketed Mod.
---
It only took 5 years to fix that one lol.
---
Edit: Why the downvotes? It's literally been like that since Fallout 4
---
I don’t know, I’m just curious if there’s an Enclave bundle yet.
---
When I'd crouch and go chameleon the bright flash was overwhelming... With HDR off its so subtle I can barely notice
---
 **Fort Defiance:** The No C.A.M.P. zone at Fort Defiance has been expanded to include the road in front of Allegheny Asylum to resolve an exploit affecting enemy spawns during the Line in the Sand event. 
---
it was fun while it lasted
---
Back to your worksheet buddy
---
Some effects will remain multiplicative though, like Tenderizer and a couple of the new Legendary Perks, Follow Through and Taking One For The Team.
---
sorry, I've only seen it once myself, but since nothing is mentioned here in the patch notes I assume it hasn't been fixed.
---
So far it hasn't been that popular either, as lvl 14 mirelurks were probably not worth the effort.
---
But with one wasteland that will most certainly change
---
Tbh when i bulked i didn’t see much of a difference in my space. I bulk when im ready to sell because im a lazy bum.
---
I have a free period, and it is online learning
---
Ok well you can't do shit right now anyway so nothing we can say will help you.
---
Oh, I thought it meant they’ll be unable to move their camp from now on. That really sucks, I’ve put loads of effort into my camp
---
Man at least modify the event so it doesn't completely suck ass if they're going to do this. It takes way too long for far too low of experience to do it the traditional way.
---
Yeah running into constant level 62's when you are 20 was getting old fast.
---
Ghoul chickens
---
All the content.
---
Was it at a Workshop?
---
Well played, sir. Well played. Upvote for you.
---
I'll join a server and sit there confused. I might go clear Wes Tek and see what my damage is like.
---
It's a good idea as it helps counter the negativity. A while a go Bethesda seriously nerfed a couple if effects that were meta and my feed mostly got filled with rants from this sub. In the middle of it all was a FC post of some dude seeing how many bear rugs you could stack. It's a better but sillier sub.
---
I did those exact ones, they were the badges I had left over. They weren't actually that bad, the obstacle courses were easy, just wait for the quest markers to pop up and follow them. There's a swimsuit at Spruce Knob Lake, 2 actually right next to the starting point, watch out for the mirelurks! 
---
I bought some stimpack diffusers from someone a long time ago and never used them until last night, just went to Radiation Rumble and joined the team that the other player there was on and used them during the event. I had some spare perk points and got the Pharmacist perks finally upgraded, so I could finish off the Medic badge. 
---
The Electrician badge was a bit annoying, I'd restored power to a plant before, but apparently it never counted until I did it again.  And, the photograph of a generator, bit stupid that none of the dozens of pictures I've taken of the Foundation Generator ever counted for that challenge. When I did finally try to take a picture of a generator, they never show up in the camera as a 'Generator'. I went to four different places, thinking that maybe it was because the fusion core was out of all of them, but at the fourth one I just said screw this and took a picture and it counted it anyway. Oh well! Ever Upward, argh.
---
The whole thing is a pain in the butt.
---
It’s the same with elder scrolls online, when one Tamriel released it was like 50 gigs I’m pretty sure, completely overhauled the combat, spawns, levelling, pvp, so I imagine the same with this
---
Usually when I’m on a server and it says it will undergo maintenance I log off and go onto another server with no issues.
---
And still rightly fucked over everyone who took advantage of it.
---
Oh , oh yeah. Radiation rumbles my go to for XP
---
Good luck. And I mean patience.
---
5. Gonna take a shit
---
Well i kinda do that too...
---
I can't close an eye...even while listening ASMR 😐
---
As I said i wasn't sure and am unfamiliar with updates. Don't get your panties in a wad
---
Yes I’ve seen some game series go down the drain as they cared more about collecting subscription fees than the actual content of the game. I’m totally fine with Subscribers getting access to unique cosmetics and small convenience upgrades as long as it’s not totally imbalanced/unfair for non-subscribers
---
I’ve found a camp with 20 in it
---
all i will say is think about where the enemies spawn each wave and then position yourself accordingly.
---
As painful as it is to play this game it was great while it lasted.
---
Oh ok ty.
---
Oh damn. Yeah I joined after wastelanders launched, so i didnt get to experience wild appalachia or vault raids or explosive energy weapon days. Just really want to try the mischief night halloween event tho, lol
---
Wait theres was an ammunition economy😕
---
Think it was on whitesprings
---
It made it easier to get through the event and was a great way to farm XP, but more than half the time I went there would always be some level 300+ player with a weapon that would take out all the scorched with one shot.
---
Incredibly frustrating because it would deprive everyone else of the opportunity to get XP. The best I could get would be to search through all the gore at the end for ammo.
---
Maybe I read over it but the light from the light barrel is white and not orange and it has driven me nuts from day one since I always used them in FO4 for atmospere
---
Ok, this time this is an excellent feedback and something I could actually work with. I'll answer "shortly", and would like to move this discussion outside of reddit and preferably onto Discord, if you use it. We've done some of what you referred to - built a Price Feedback Tool, adjusted it multiple times based on community opinions, made a role on our Discord: "community oversight". Despite all that, building a reasonable dataset for the prices in other approach than what we do: "following the global market trends" has been painfully slow and complex process. I'm not against making this discussion public - I just feel that throwing wall of texts at each another is making it harder to explore any of the points here in greater depth, and you've already proposed a solution that could, in fact, make this endeavour a technically feasible one. I'd like to focus on it.
---
FED76 is the first website I wrote and my first deep dive into programming. I admit I haven't thought "outside the box" in terms of technologies used. Having a mod produce the files to be analyzed could actually produce the datasets of the extreme volume that'd be needed to get statistically significant data out. And would do it way faster than our price feedback, simply because of its automated nature.
---
The price tool states that it has been built based on global PC market. I disagree with calling Player Vending global market, and it's a decision based on hundreds of hours of analyzing it, including using VPN to learn the cultural differences. I actually agree this could be stated better, and will think on how to do that before any of the more complicated solutions are put in place. I'm not saying player vending is not an important part of the game, it's very important. It's just not the most efficient one to sell items in. I don't feel it's fair to call the FED project something intentionally misleading. To help understanding the choices made with the tool, let me present a dilemma which shaped it.
---
Let's say that 95% of the community thinks given item is cheap, under 3k. Meanwhile, there's something not widely known yet, that put it's at 1:1 or 1:2 for legacies for 5% of the community, because they want it and want it stop being scripped. If I put it at 90k+ it could score, 95% of community will call it overpaying. If I put it at 3k, 5% will cry out I try to scam people. This is why the tool is aligned around one concept: price is as much as buyers are willing to pay, finding right buyers is critical factor that impacts the achievable prices. I believe this tool helps to share the context about legendary items in the community, and reduce the discrepancy between the casual price and the dedicated price. The intention was never to make people reliant on the tool. Our success is measured by amount of people that stopped needing it to get good prices for their items. 
---
And let's return to serums. If we'd did serums pricing following the approach that we do everything with, we'd say this:
---
Serums have a nice guaranteed price from vendors, and are often used to quickly pick out daily NPC vendor caps. This serves as their value guarantee. Sell them for around 300 if you want them bought en-masse for this daily-vendor-caps purpose. Sell them for around 500 if you don't want buying them out profitable, but still want to provide a serum selection for players that would actually want to consume them. Don't buy them for more than 500 because there's enough competition in the market to guarantee you that you'll find your serums for under 500 caps.
---
I listen to feedback. I work continuously to improve what I know will never be perfect, but what helps thousands of people daily anyway. I will certainly not walk past tips as good as the ones you gave me in the last response, and I'd be honored if you'd join the "community oversight" on our Discord to help us on the journey to help the community.
---
SCORE!!!!
---
that fucking sucked.. it was a huge drag
---
I wish they would be more aggressive protecting spawn points and event areas from building...
---
Hope I can go inside
---
Not sure what your saying. I personally have never found the game painful to play.
---
I don't even mind that fix as long as the spawns in the event are CONSTANT. I can't stand how much dead air that event has in between spawns otherwise.
---
I weep over the death of the English language.....
---
I'm at work and I'm having trouble remote accessing my PS4. Normally I run the updates that way so their ready to go by the time I get home.
---
I'm pretty sure all the servers are shut down for maintenance though
---
They got off WAY too easy. A sizeable gain in ammo and seemingly no threat of a ban in exchange of rebuilding their camp. 
---
Were I the exploiting type, I'd take this deal up in a heartbeat.
---
To be fair though that's a singleplayer game vs an MMO-lite game and it did release on a less popular platform to begin with. Even Fo4 might've dried up a few months after release
---
They are bound to break something with this update
---
I mean i played the event before tents existed and ill still play it
---
Dang ok. Ty
---
Lol it seemed rather content up there. I took a photo and zoomed in close to its eye
---
Already seen a work around. That didn’t take long.
---
I would say the best CAMP building technique so far.
---
My only issue with it is how slow it is  Time between waves is too high IMO and the enemies often just slowly walk around or fail to target the generator so you have to run out past the fence to find the random scorched that decided it wanted to camp out.
---
Just read this, much sad.
---
Burn down the school --------&gt; go home and play = problem solved
---
Yeah, but my nice, reasonably calm Forest C.A.M.P. is now going to be attacked by Level 80+ Super Mutants rather than Level 5 ones. So much for getting some sleep every once in awhile.
---
It's still a fun game though but indeed it wasn't the Fallout killer that some people claimed it to be.
---
I just got this game a few days ago off Game Pass too. This game isn't "Fallout 5" and I'm glad you're not expecting it to be, however I feel like this game stayed closer to the franchise than TESO did. At some moments I forget I'm playing an MMO and not a singleplayer Fallout. I definitely think it's worth your time.
---
It's on the list.
---
Todd Howard clogging my toilet, flooding the entire bathroom and yelling "It just works!" as he presses the handle over and over
---
I like yours the best.😂😂
---
The opposite I would think. Rather than explosives and teslas rendering this event moot for a lot of players who can't get in quick enough will actually have a chance to earn xp and loot.
---
I did the same, but this time I’m at home &amp; have to wait looking on download process 😂
---
Just finished downloading. No copying file ??? Wtf is up with that ?
---
Noise maker... thing lmao 😀😄😃
---
i always wonder why people think anyone cares that youre leaving. bye? i guess?
---
It really wasn't. Every time you logged out, you just took a few Toxic Goo's and shut the game off.
---
You did in the PTS. They were in my inventory, but I couldn't see the Results Screen.
---
Determining if 3 slots in Tank Killer (Now works with pistols BTW) is better than 3 Slots in Rifle damage, Prior to this update, it wasn't.
---
game changing content
---
That’s what I thought but when I’d get on another server the message disappeared and I kept playing. It doesn’t make sense but I’ve done it several times lol
---
Ok then this post doesn't apply to you?
---
Ok i see, but just be careful, i mean give yourself a chance to be able to optimise your build for dps phases or something like that. This is what I mean there. It looks really interesting, but you are either an add killed or a Dps ( Boss phase ).
---
That actually sounds great because copying the file is really time consuming.
---
Huh. Weird lol. You must've gotten a legacy server or something lol
---
I've had several instances of that event breaking due to spawns disappearing or not happening, so anything that fixes or improves that would be great. I guess we'll see how it works out!
---
Get what deserve. Bet you got griefed into duping as well.
---
Yeah, I’ve been feeling that way for a few days and I’ve just been spending a lot of time wandering around and hanging out in my camp.
---
Wouldn't be a terrible idea to add in [this link](https://bethesda.net/en/status) for any newbies.
---
What’s an example of this? Like tucking chairs under destroyed tables then rebuilding table?
---
It shouldn't be that much additional space needed, it just replaces some files with newer ones and as Bethesda tends to keep most stuff in one file those become very huge...and if even one line is changed the whole file needs to be replaced.
---
So I got close too.  I blueprinted it but never placed it in my camp.  My question when I get home will be, once I delete the blueprint, will I be able to relog my camp back in, or am I still rebuilding.
---
The other day? So at least a day went by before the patch when you were aware of it being at your camp and you didn’t delete it...?
---
Greetings from Beth😂 
---
Doit one more time. Ur provider should pay them for ur traffic😆😆
---
Some players were inviting others to their teams then placing the ammo factories in their camps as they can’t be removed. The people who purposely exploited it should be punished but there are some innocent people who got griefed
---
I think there is a misunderstanding here. If it's like TESO it's more like your damage who scale on the enemy,meaning it's the same Deathclaw for you and your mate.The difference is that your stuff and build is far more optimized than the lvl 10 player,thus you kill the ennemy faster than the lvl 10 player.it's not like each one get an "Instancied" mob
---
Missing the Dark Souls community a little extra now
---
Fallout content

But can’t you just join a random team from the social menu, like an event team or a casual team, and then continue to play solo while your teammates continue to do whatever it is they are doing? It sounds like this perk would still work in that situation, as long as you’re not the only one on the team. That’ll make the Lone Wanderer perk useless, though.
---
Edit: follow up thought, does Strange in Numbers work that way too? If I join a team but don’t actually play alongside my teammates, and assuming we’re both mutated, I should get the benefits of that perk, right? That would be a nice complement to Take One For the Team, assuming you’re a mutant like me :)
---
Im only level 32ish lol. I got the 80% more ammo perk though
---
They nerfed everyone.
---
Hopefully they learned their lesson and never accept private team up requests from strangers.
---
Yes it is thanks for helping me out hopefully I can get threw it soon but with this new season starting lol
---
Why did people stoped nuking it so much?
---
I think easier if people are using follow through and taking one for the team. Harder if no one is. The queen isn’t as difficult as Earle though so it won’t be too much harder.
---
Lmao wow seriously
---
I deleted them as soon as I saw them, but I’m concerned because they take up camp budget
---
Sheesh, truthfully I'm not surprised. Only a complete waste of space would do that.
---
Thank God it's now patched/gone though.
---
Haha lmao 😅
---
Hmm, I will trade the 100k 5.56 for the nuclear reactor I have to rebuild.
---
You are being down voted because you did not take the time to even look for an answer. Major update. Downtime unknown (like always, probably 2-4 hrs if this go smooth.) This info has been available for at least a week, from multiple sources.
---
If you are in that much of a rush......

he means ppl that abuse bugs and glitches lol or just bad programing

For sure “game content”, but some doubts about using here word “changing”))

3, 2, 1 and 4 if Leader of the Pack ever pops.
---
I think unfortunately that ship has passed, and we’ll be seeing a lot more of subscription services in the future for all games. The question becomes for me: do I enjoy it and is it worth my time and money. People that have limited time to play have to weigh those options for sure. I was home because of Covid so season 1 was easy for me, but for season two I’ll have less time so we’ll see if I enjoy it. I have one of the coolers (came with red rocket bundle I think?) and I never use it. Too easy to whip up a cranberry relish when I need it. Anyway I’m rambling...I like this game too! Great value for what I paid. Take care out there.
---
Ikr! Not only that but I can't even put my ps4 in rest mode to make it download faster. I tried that and waited an hour and when i went to check on it it started right back from the start.
---
The Civil war dress BADLY clips, almost all of the time. It is worst when sitting, either in a chair or photo mode. Sitting in a chair the front basically dissappears so you're just staring at undies. 
---
The Golf Skirt also pretty badly clips, though not quite as bad as the civil war dress.
---
Lagging and disconnecting probably.
---
thought the same think :D got so much used to it that it took a while after reading to get its not the way it should work
---
Just a question though.... why do they update AND do maintenance on the day of rollout, why not monday?    I’m sure there is an explanation, I just don’t know why.
---
Well, there goes the daily level up challenge.
---
try this?

Will post this even if others already did:
---
Please Bethesda, take the said "fixes and adjustments" for the damage model right now, because the less time we need to deal with the current model, the better. I've been writing about it on the PTS forums, yet I saw no change. BUILDS NO LONGER MATTER. Your perk cards do little to nothing to your damage. That is something you shouldn't allow, but since the patch is going through anyway, the best you can do now is get to fixing that asap.
---
Glad to know someone else noticed this. Certain parts of the map are almost blinding (Toxic Valley is the worst). The light coming from the sun is also white-whereas pre-Wastelanders it had more of a natural glow.
---
Sunset/sunrise look pretty awesome though.
---
ban their asses, dont give special treatment
---
I must have gained 100+ levels doing that lol
---
Think I'm gonna stay here and watch people cry and whine in agony
---
Nice! Thanks!
---
Hope Bethesda doesn’t find out about the caps glitch caused by the fast travel bug. Would be terrible if they fixed that one /s
---
No probs man knew I’d seen it on here somewhere
---
but you need at least 3 people for doing this, right?
---
People on Community? So, what... Donald Glover and Chevy Chase just cancelled their Fallout 1st and ESO+ because they can't place an Ammo factory that they shouldn't have had access to anymoe?
---
I expect nothing and I'm still ley down
---
Good because the trail fireworks can be banished from my inventory, bad because I liked damn near instant reloads...will be missed for sure:(
---
its a big update. it probably wont be one even when you get home from school.
---
I like the current end game content but it needs to give me more of a reason to do it. There's nothing I want from Earl, the Queen, Sheep or Project Paradise. I have no reason to do any of those events expect for fun. Wish they'd add some super rare rewards that are worth grinding for.
---
I have this issue every time I launch.
---
You have to find where the game is installed and copy the Fallout76.ini from there to the My Documents&gt;My Games&gt;Fallout 76 folder.
---
Idk why but the game deletes this file on exit and can’t reconnect when launched without it
---
It's ok it's only 115 dollars of real money if you want it 
---
And I know I will get downvotes for this but if i had 115 euros of very free money that I would not miss i would buy the whole season pass
---
today As the last one was a grind and half.
---
Oh well back to 60 INT and eating cranberry relish for the next 2  months.
---
It wasn't game breaking, but certainly broken.
---
Single-fire guns per-shot accuracy goes up by 10/15/20% each rank. Automatics were supposed to go up 2/3/4% per shot only, but at third rank were actually going up 20% like rifles. Stealth Commando builds could engage from a safer distance as a result.
---
Yes, they've decided to cut their losses and leave the servers down permanently.
---
So what happens to nuclear winter
---
I will miss being able to wander the NW of the map after a hard day of work and not worrying about getting ambushed.
---
But I guess deaths never make you lose much anyway....
---
One of the devs said it’s delayed till later this year
---
There is no "copying" step though, I just got done with the download, and that was it.
---
Ah shitzer
---
Yes they post them. Def exciting
---
Put the controller down. Mommy is calling.  Its bath time.
---
lol. but why?
---
Cool so i can expect bullet sponges with a high end build then. Gonna be fun to waste 5k bullets on a boss.
---
Yeah, that's a great point.  Unless the NPC's/bots you're supposed to be protecting from harm are scaled in level to match their new surroundings, they're simply dead meat if you miss even one enemy attack.  It'll be interesting to see if Beth thought of this ahead of time, and if so, how its being mitigated.
---
All kidding aside just don’t put yourself through the aggravation my friend. If it makes you upset just move on. I’ve taken short breaks from this game and others. Eventually it won’t make me happy anymore and I’ll move on. Take care.
---
Protectron and Liberator? I'd KILL for a liberator.
---
I would assume only 1 would be fine. Just like the tent it only affects one-two spawn "points" but I am assuming if the game identifies that one can't spawn, it throws EVERY enemy from that spawn timer into a secondary location like at LITS
---
It might have been a glitch lol but I’m okay with it.
---
Clearing West Tek was my first plan too! Just want a feel of what my new damage is like now
---
Yeah man. I didn’t want my response to sound like one of those “my opinion matters!” whiny comments because who cares what I think. But like you just said, people are gonna be put off. Especially those of us who are kinda hoping for a reason to hop back into WVA.
---
Apparently they're making the score more easy to get so people with actual lives can complete the run.
---
Apparently.
---
Why is PP always empty? It's a cool event in a nice location, but nobody is ever there. I need those damn bear arm plans.
---
That's insane. Like why choose then to do that?
---
My mineral extractor, collection, and ammo plant
---
yea. i have tried probabyly most bleed weapons in a few different builds because i wanted to see if they anyway useful for endgame. 
---
the answer is no.
---
anywhere after level 15(max) poison just stops doing all that much. hell even against a level 5 enemy its not the best and is easier to jsut melee a third time to finish them off.
---
And you're an exploiter if you were doing that.
---
@Ladydevann
---
Will you please do me the courtesy of giving me an update on your comment here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hio4tb/comment/fwhlm2g
---
I've been waiting for MONTHS for someone to acknowledge this problem, and the closest I ever got was your comment a few months ago. Why on earth do you not take this seriously? I've totally given up on this game and at ever getting any response from you or anyone else with any remote relation to the development of this game, except for these monthly patch notes where a tiny part of me is hoping that you have fixed this thing reported by me and other AMD GPU users several times with repro instructions and screenshots only to see that, apparently, we still don't matter at all. I guess the percentage of players with and AMD GPU must be shockingly low in the grand scheme of things, considering how little your development team seem to care about this.
---
I get that at this point FO76 is probably using an older fork of the dev teams internal Creation Engine, and that the engine engineers are probably few and occupied with maintaining the main branch  of the engine, and so there's little resources devoted to performing "legacy upgrades" on the old engine, but this is not feature development! This is bug fixing the shading changes you made with the Wastelanders update. Which causes severe visual artifacts related to Global Illumination when Enlighten is active on AMD GPUs. Please, as I've said many times, if you're just not going to fix it, then say so!!
---
It's interesting how there's plenty of members of this community who feels the instinct to downvote these comments of mine, and I can see why you might think this is hostile or that I'm having a bad attitude, but please understand that at this point, I've attempted to get a response in pretty much every way fathomable. And now I'm just tired. Tired and frustrated.
---
Wow I love reading these thanks, no I'm not being sarcastic I legit love reading things like this I don't know why
---
5% is 1 in 20 and considering the amount of time ACP takes that is rare enough to be a huge pain
---
Even glitching through a silo run would take at least 10 minutes, then there's a minute timer on the nuke, 3 minutes for Earle queue... Basically a player going through at lightning speed would still take up to 30 minutes and then have a cool down to wait to launch another nuke. It's very slow for a 1/20 roll to not be considered rare
---
Who's laughing now?
---
Supply vs demand. Whenever a dupe glitch is found everyone is going to dupe their BE Gat Plasma or B2525 Handmades and Fixers, so they're everywhere. But no one dupes a B2590 Fixer or Handmade. And I really wish they would because I want to get one without selling my soul to Satan. 
---
I'm rather tired of seeing the explosive gat plasma as well. Some people completely ruin public events by insta killing everything so no one gets anything. Bethesda should just remove the barrel splitter attachment from the Gat plasma and laser rifle. Would solve that problem while letting people keep their explosive energy weapons. And removing the laser splitter would fix the hacked guns that have the splitter that makes them do beyond stupid damage.
---
None taken. WV is an area that isn't super culturally important (like DC, New York, Las Vegas, etc). So a lot of people don't know much about the area. Which for someone from the area, it was so fun to talk to people who used VC when they'd try to explain where they needed to go for quests. Most people pronounce Kanawha and Monongah wrong, because they just don't know.
---
And that's basically the problem with the accents in-game. Very few are correct. Melody Larkin is, and the Overseer is close but not exactly. But most NPCs sound like they're from way away from the area, which for some characters is just weird.  (For clarity, Rose doesn't have an Appalachian accent and neither does the radio girl, but their voices dont grate on my nerves as bad as Page and Ward.) Mort gets kinda close, and Duchess's accent is thick but sounds faked as well.
---
That will get me through the workday until I can get home and start exploring the new content. 😋😋😋
---
This is the only thing I’m sad about😭😭
---
Jesus dude. Use Google
---
Haha
---
Damn, I was really hoping they'd buff temporary charisma like from magnetic personality and such so we can share higher level perk cards. At the moment it just feels like a useless perk.
---
Just ban them.
---
They reduced the XP the ghouls gave and then they reduced the legendary spawn rate of ghouls/removed the non starred legendary enemies. I think they also reduced the spawns, because it used to be that leaving the server and coming back would respawn the whole area and now it doesn't seem like it. Maybe that will change today though.
---
Its the bug that showed up that makes the stim healing bar regress itself as it’s healing, right? So you heal “less” than you normally should? If this is that bug, I’m hella glad it’s fixed cause it was driving me crazy and I had no idea what was causing it!
---
i only do her for the repair kits.
---
Yea! Us carnivores need something to sustain us while at camp!!
---
Patch notes are pinned
---
Having them spawn in all over the place and half the time you can’t find them cause they get stuck was a pain
---
LOL. you are the type of player I enjoy playing games with.
---
Scroll down literally a handful of posts and there were 90 of them about the patch notes.

&gt;Public Teams: We've renamed the "Building" team to "Casual" and removed the Casual team bonus. In its place, we’ve added a “Daily Ops” team type, which offers bonus XP for completing Daily Ops (+25% bonus XP to start, +100% bonus XP for a fully bonded team). 
---
We did this in part because it is not possible to build in Public Teammates' C.A.M.P.s., and partly because most players were using the Building team the way we had intended Casual to be used anyway.
---
So the Casual team boost to luck is gone?:/
---
Does anyone ever use the Role Playing team? I don't think I've seen a single one active.
---
I actually do [have one](https://i.imgur.com/qj9dMBl.jpg). I spent like 20 minutes trying to NOT have this shot clip, so it is hardly the worst, but, I think it shows the golf skirt clipping.
---
It’s patch day. Bitching is a guarantee lol
---
Yeah, I won't know where to spend that 30-60 caps it cost me a day...
---
This Reddit group is entertaining as hell because you just don't know what people are going to do......
---
Can't wait for the comments on this one. Lol
---
?? You calling me a troll
---
Sure you did
---
I wonder if they fixed the one you can do for Guided Meditation, though.
---
Not surprised
---
Maybe they eat their eggs because you leave them locked in a coop while you walk 32 miles around the block
---
Mischief night is so much fun. Not that long to go till then!
---
This is the biggest insult
---
I just spent so many caps doing quests revolving crater and foundation....in the past 2 days...wow... 🙄
---
Rose is meh. But Eugenie...now theres a voice i could eat for breakfast...shes super cute/charming, has a beautiful voice AND forever smells like bacon?! Girl of my dreams right there.....
---
(281) 330-8004
---
I didn't like it. Too much lag. Glad it's getting fixed but I kinda get why people liked it. Aside from loot and exp, it felt super satisfying to aoe bunch of scorched
---
My thought is that Junkies vs. Bloodied will be a much closer decision.  Bloodied will still  do more damage overall because of perks that stack, but not by near as much as it used to.
---
Nobody use to play it before we could do the tent thing. No it’ll go back to nobody paying attention to it
---
Cool, thanks
---
yea but people only knew how to use tents because youtubers started uploading videos for the views.
---
im sure you can still force their spawns like the old days.
---
As a rifleman I am pissed I never tried that!
---
I remember fast traveling to a camp once and seeing a deathclaw in front of the camp so on instinct I took out my two shot gatling gun and started laying into that thing. Little did I know the player used wasteland whisperer to tame the deathclaw. The player was literally a deathclaw egg farmer lmao.
---
A month is too modest honestly...
---
Bullshit mines copying right now it’s been stuck on 35% for so long
---
I enjoy my quad tesla on my main.  I hope the patch notes are not wrong about the frame rate drop fix.
---
Ah, did not realize that.  Well, that's at least something.  I still have a feeling I'm going to need to build a more fortress-like C.A.M.P. than I have, but there is a significant difference between Level 50 and Level 80 mobs.
---
I’m excited I’ll have Time to swap cards and arrive at the scorch queen before she is dead
---
Necrophilia huh?
---
About damn time. Honestly, they should have a centrally located free travel point in each of the regions.
---
I want them to add a :^) emoticon to the game
---
The only lag I ever saw was when people were using Tesla rivals. Otherwise you could drop a post mine where they spawn at and it would obliterate all of them at once.
---
My low level accounts with level up 2 or 3 times during one of that if I got to do it by myself
---
I love these posts every time
---
I quit I’m sorry I quit did about 3 weeks ago I just couldn’t do it any more. This game broke my heart. I’m not gunna lie I started with Fallout4 and never looked back. I don’t have the love of 3 or NV but I admire y’all. The only thing I miss is the community. I still come back weekly to read what’s going on. I used to start every morning eating breakfast watching what info juicehead had for me to get through the day till I got off work to come home and play. I write all this to say the community was and is the best part. Thank y’all for all you do.
---
It's not being lazy. There are tons of people with family and job, and they simply don't follow content creators or forums. And the fact that it say's in the game is easy to overlook as you autopilot just press play. I know one guy, he is smart and have family and not slow at all, he just starting game then while it loads he go and grab a snack or something, and when he comes back he just press play. He didn't know about this, thats why I am saying it. Let those few who didn't know, post their questions then. Not a big deal.
---
My curiosity is piqued, how many bear rugs CAN you stack?
---
just the one
---
It also created a weird bug with FFR railways. If you burst fired the trigger really fast in VATS, you could fire off 15-50 shots before reloading. You spam the crit button too to put out insane damage.
---
SO on a serious note.
---
Traditionally Beth has always aimed to have the servers come back online at a specific hour of day assuming they don't run into any delays. 
---
I can't remember precisely but I feel like they usually aim for 3 est, though if anyone else remembers more accurately what time we can expect things to go back up I would appreciate it.
---
Ur right here my friend!, I’ve lost every brain cell today after waking up and not doing the normal fucking thing and looking at the reddit post, sorry if you lost any chromosomes.
---
Checking claim ticket
---
Will try! Thank you
---
I get you but at the same time to say Bethesda dislikes the builder community is abit much, they constantly give builders new skins, items etc for building, and it's all abit far fetched and corny considering we just got survived the apocalypse, now let's make a xmas tree of a house. If anything they spend way to much time designing things for builders than they do core elements of the game.
---
It's not like people aren't using teslas while doing the exploit. If you gonna do it, get your teslas outta here
---
Yes. Placing a Survival tent in the right spot caused the spawn points to glitch and drop all the Scorched directly in front of the signal device.
---
So rebuild your camp.....not too hard. dismantle the BP to get the parts back. the only thing this affects is the BPed workshop ammo factory and the people using it. (It will not effect my camp at all).
---
Sounds like your looking for things to complain about......
---
There are many much more valid things in FO76 to harp on. Pick one.
---
Oh yeah cause this exploit is so much worse than the other exploits people do. Gtfo lol. Placing a tent and causing a glitch and their fault. People purposely trying to glitch and duplicate shit are the problem
---
Oof
---
Making room for all the new stuff lol 😆 atleast that’s what I’ve been doing 👍
---
Tbh idk. The servers are still down but im pretty sure you have to completely rebuild your camp tho lol.
---
That's my area code 😏
---
That or the other top tiers that Regs sells
---
There's also use cases for non SS underarmor since every "family" has different SPECIAL buffs
---
The best content. People tell me, they say, wow your content is terrific. I know more about content than anybody. The devs say, wow, you know more about content than we do. I tell them I know the cyber.
---
There still the strongest after the patch.
---
Secret service is missing some mods. There's also armor weight and vault 94 bonuses
---
someone *cough* may have made a post on this here forum and added pics explaining how to do it.
---
Still no new revolver/ pistol skins? :( 
---
At least the flamingo lamps are cool.
---
Its "easier" (since you can trade for them) to get a specific roll of other armor types. 
---
Additionally, if you want to get max sneak, you'll probably want leather or wood armor since they weight less
---
Tank killer  and a buff to modern renegade? Hell yea, ill take that!
---
10 minutes ez only copying is so fucking annoying
---
Thanks for the offer. I'll send those right over. /s
---
they fixed the teslas with this patch, so the lag should be gone(but now so is the exploit)
---
Yeah lets see if obsidian try to do marketing with someone else IP again in the future to promote their own games (not like grounded)
---
It's a wonder people are even able to come to Reddit and make posts to begin with.
---
DonkVW feel free to add me I’m on at evenings most nights in the uk
---
Yeah, +1 to this for sure.  Speed Demon already has its drawbacks with food and water requirements, it doesn't need a third one.
---
I have but one upvote to give, though you deserve so many more.
---
Exactly as NW is set in the future 
---
Maybe they'll scrap it or release as standalone F2P game
---
How dare you not include the liberator
---
Lmfaoo
---
Will this affect custom maps in any way?
---
I thought about swapping to a SSD, but I'm going to buy a ps5 as soon as I can, anyway.
---
Hm, not sure if they could easily fix those two outfits but I'll add it to the list.
---
Again more pessimistic thinking. I expected
---
No more from you.
---
I think they are scaling back the ban hammer for now. With how wildly they swung after the last dupe wave, I think a simple "move your camp, you ne'er-do-weller!" is a good move on their part.
---
But, I'll still remember that guy's camp that had 20 of these machines pumping out 50 cal ammo that were all unlocked. Thanks for the 4000 rounds of ammo, dude!
---
They should start to remove some pre-Wastelanders events, beginning with LITS.
---
Exploitful LITS:  Cheap way to get XP without any bothersome immersion.  Remember, the player to max out 6 Legendary Perk cards first gets into VIP Heaven when he dies!  
---
Exploitless LITS:  Defend the old asylum from the Scorched at all costs!  It may only have ferals and bugs now, but there used to be some BOS heroes in there!
---
Yeah they posted it right after I posted this. Does the new season cost money?
---
Legendary perks, 600+ perk points to spend &amp; 50+ perk packs to open, Ammo factory maxed 1st, then working on legendary S.P.E.C.I.A.L perks....hope to max them all by tomorrow afternoon.
---
By blueprinting the ammo factory you could then place it anywhere in a camp or other workshop. You could place as many as you wanted but it caused server issues.
---
Hopefully you don't have any Nukashine available in your C.A.M.P. .  It could take weeks to track him down.
---
No problem, you are not an idiot, it is installing the single player version of the game, that is why the size is 30 gb, you can play it offline
---
1 800 Life alert. For when you've fallen and they won't stimpack you back up
---
Easily? 🤷🏻‍♂️, should they? Yes.
---
No it never does
---
Because of how much it is adding to the game! Completely overhauling combat system, completly changing how the servers respond to every individual player (one wasteland for all), adding new faction with questlines, adding a whole new battlepass for season 2, adding daily ops and adding a whole load of new perks. It's a lot of additions and it's all free for everyone. I wouldn't be complaining really.
---
Yeah, I know. That's what I said.
---
Thats also true.
---
They said they fixed these ash piles and goos multiple times. Well it still ain't fixed so I'm not getting my hopes up
---
This is why I ALWAYS opt for armor piercing mods over bleed damage.  I’d rather deal five extra damage right away than 15 damage over 15 seconds.  Most enemies don’t live longer than 1-2 seconds.
---
Brace for the, " Why do I have to rebuild my whole camp?" rants. So many lols.
---
Has anybody noticed the score meter doesn’t  increase in power armor? Or is that just me?
---
No fix for VATS yet? Ugh...
---
sure
---
To be fair the servers may not even be back up by then...
---
Yes, can download rn
---
Yes sir
---
What’s your gt? I would like to come purchase some serums!
---
There are caps up and down, so something may cap at like 25 for low and 45 for high. but there are caps so it wont drop something meant to be 60 down to 4.
---
&gt;Critters: Now cap at level 5 and can no longer spawn as legendary.
---
Does that mean no lvl100 chickens? :(
---
Same lmao
---
My ammo machines are still up and running...LIL NOT PATCHED
---
If you've ever seen an amazing build on Youtube or literally anywhere it more than likely used a pile of "tricks" to make it happen. It's hard to label it an "exploit" when there isn't any real gain. Duping is an "exploit" because you're generating illicit game items. Merging a chair with a toilet so you can actually sit on it is just people wanting to build.
---
well, it does contain a lot of changes as well as new stuff. so it makes sense that it would be big, even on PC it is roughly 20GB.

also, are shotguns still doing magic dmg in VATS? my mum plays the game and uses a shotgun to fight when she needs to and then goes back to looting and decorating her house.
---
I like the Marine Wetsuit. No diseases from water.
---
*laughs in energy weapons*
---
Some of these are just suggestions/what you think bethesda should do, not even things that are objectively wrong. "Cattleprod should be named Caddle Prod because that's how it was in the old games" is just one example
---
it was meeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Zurkly feel free to add me
---
Ahhh I mis read. My bad lol.
---
Some of those missing mods are getting added today when Light and Ultralight should be available. I'm going to Ultralight all my close enough pieces that I am keeping for now. Not sure what else might still be missing but we've got to be close by now.
---
It's simple, 45 ammo is crazy expensive in materials to craft.  Even the Ultacite version uses more materials than other popular ammo types.  You should get at least as much .45 ammo as you get for crafting 5.56.
---
The people that I have seen using these were making either .45 ammo (Fixer) or .308 (LMG).  The LMG is a hungry beast....
---
Yeah. Mines been downloading, but very slowly for some reason (XBox btw). If you're on console restart the system to get it to appear.
---
Where can I get tickets for this Ted Talk
---
why don't you guys try to use legit ways and not depend on glitches bugs ? they are gonna get fix it either way after everything got fixed or not
---
It kills me that Bethesda continues to fix these innocent camp building tricks, because the camp builders are the ones who pay out weekly to buy things/bundles from the Atom Shop. If you continue to alienate them and upset them, they aren't going to buy camp items because what's the point? Sigh.
---
I love this game, I love the community. But some of these decisions, man. Please give us a better building system, or just let us have our tricks! u/ladydevann
---
I was just starting a new Wonderland camp on my latest character that I was really excited about, too. :(
---
Hopefully the daily ops will make up for it
---
I just usually skipped her quests until I wanted to do wastelanders
---
Do you see any posts announcing they are up? 
---
If yes, they are up.
---
If no, they are not up.
---
Reddit is not that hard to use.
---
Most damage is being nerfed from this update so most of these guns wouldn’t be as strong as they sound now.
---
me too.  i do it on my private for the 1k steel.  then go look for the red dress.
---
Why not go look??
---
ah me too, I'll believe it when i see it. my point was that i participated in the glitched event many times without much lag, when ppl were only using explosive weapons to tag, no teslas. and it was great
---
Was punji board stacking removed?
---
Waaaaaaaaah they fix bugs waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
---
I too am curious and hope this won't effect no clip builing
---
Allegedly! 😅
---
https://i.imgur.com/dR1M6EG.png
---
Is that a new weapon released in S2?
---
My ammo factories are still up and running
---
Experiment. I don't have a tent so if people didn't show up to Line In The Sand on the odd occasion, I would force the spawns using my character. There are certain spots you can sit. Shouldn't take long to figure out. What will they do in Patch 23? Stop me sitting on a fence?
---
I can’t tell if this is satire. There has never been an ammo economy lol.
---
It sure was. Dammit.
---
Ouch.
---
There was an exploit at workshops where you could stack the desks and containers onto a spring trap and have it destroyed and itd respawn the items inside when you repaired the stack. Wasnt really useful because of how slow it was but you could technically get an unlimited amount of certain scrap items and if you're lucky 1-2 caps each time you repaired.
---
I'm assuming this fixes that exploit.
---
Hopefully never, it’s a great tradeoff for being a glass cannon
---
So are bloodied builds not META anymore? I currently run a Bloodied Heavy Weapon Power Armor build.
---
Are shotguns viable now?
---
How do we get the displays?
---
I really doubt anyone has enough perk cards to actually test out these builds
---
You want to get herd and empath as well. there's no reason to not be in a team now. Herd gives up to +3 to all specials even if you're in a party by yourself. And with others and strange in numbers it's possible to get +4. 
---
Empath also works in a party by yourself. You take more damage.. but then take less damage. 
---
probably should get speed demon as well. You'll get hungry and thirsty quicker but not by much if you have class freak 3. Oh and healing factor. will save you a lot of stimpacks. with class freak 3 all drugs lose 13% of effect. but if you pop a lot of drugs you may want to give it a miss.
---
as someone who uses no particular legendary prefix and only major legendary effects im actually curious to how much this update screwed my build.
---
Just call 36-24-36...hey!
---
Thank sir. And to you as well.
---
I’d give you all my atoms if I could. Great poem!
---
It's like lmgs benefiting from heavy guns. Or the gauss rifle becoming a shotgun but still being a rifle? Shotguns now work with stablized
---
You have a server running while all servers are down, man you don't half-cheat!
---
all in and around.
---
Yeah it's satire lol, people either charge their ammo for 1c each or they're told to get fucked lol
---
I won't miss aholes blowing up entire waves. before anyone else could get a tag.  
---
The regular event is still decent XP.
---
No lol, idk what OP is talking about. Using ammo as payment is just as useless as caps.
---
you will probably be able to get those with Bullions when season 2 ends, like you can now get some camp items from season 1 that way
---
Except it's an overall damage tweak, not a nerf to bloody builds. They would easily lose half their player base if they singled out bloody builds, they're the most popular by far.
---
I don't have an issue with people with "food-builds", but I do take issue with people that have food builds and then whine because they can't hold a workshop.
---
Super Duper only ever gives the base amount before any perk, which for .45 is like 12 bullets, so it's not as useful as one might think.
---
That was because of the tesla bug, which made the game a slide show, no tesla player, no problem
---
Fucking hypocrite, net even an hour ago, you offered ammo for trade.
---
Nobody is forcing you to use it.
---
Oh word awesome! Thanks for the advice man!
---
Why can't I earn any more Season 1 rewards?  I can only log in once every couple of months when the internet satellites align over my deserted island and I'm upset that this game isn't specifically tailored to my unique situation!
---
It's not a glass cannon
---
Deathclaws need a buff again.
---
Dude, you need to look up the definition of pessimistic. I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
Anyhow, it's not pessimism or what actual word you were thinking of. Just pointing out how far up your own arse your head is.
---
Thinking outside the box... lol.
---
Armor CHA boosts also seem to help... not much, but some.
---
Risk-reward (even more so now) First time I’m seeing someone complain about intelligence on unyielding. 
---
Plenty of other options to stack intelligence. You’re not being forced into anything.
---
Please don’t complain about something that isn’t broken.
---
Vault 51 future content. They must be working on something big.
---
skin for the handmade rifle in the score system i believe
---
"MDGA" - Make Deathclaws Great Again
---
Some game engines really don’t handle object collisions well.  Some game engines are totally fine with it
---
I suspect fallouts engine does not handle object collision well and wether it’s observable or not. Allowing these tricks to exist may be causing server stability issues
---
That is a legit reason to fix these bugs
---
My camp spawned back with my ammo factories up and runnung... I only have 5 ...but they are working
---
I see what you did there....
---
i dont have fun with this, lets remove it for everyone
---
The chance of people knowing to protect all 3 animals are really low and therefore not worth it at all if you want the plans from the event :(
---
so if you got ammo factory’s already there gone?
---
You don't have to run it to grind xp.  You just feel like you'll be missing out if you don't.  Its not that big of a deal.
---
Nope
---
I’ll sometimes join one for the CHA boost if I’m about to buy/sell a bunch at an NPC vendor. High charisma slightly improves prices.
---
I have a SS Chest Unyielding with dense and a trouble shooters SS chest with jet pack , my other armor is a mixture of leather, metal, combat and I'm sticking with that. There is no reason you can't ignore a meta and go your own path.
---
I love when people do this with legendaries, though. Easy buys for scrip.
---
A while ago. Only legacy camps still have it. Unless they also exploited the Ammo Factory glitch.
---
glad im not the only one who saw that.  That's going to end up saving a reasonable amount of caps in the long term when grinding reputation with those factions (especially crater when the tubes are in the galleria or the dude you have to kill is on the far side of the map)
---
Yup Just finished mine
---
the visual images i get in my head of this being attempted definitely makes me smile
---
Or Liberators.
---
Was in the the bog a couple days ago, armed with a knife, and got my butt handed to me by a pack of 10x L54 liberators.
---
At least molerats have to be within slice and dice range before they can do damage :)
---
he tested on one target, which is heavily armored. These results dont apply to all enemies.
---
Gd it, additive calcs are really the way things should be for an FPS RPG but it's disappointing sneak attacks aren't included :/ that just means building permasneak is more important than ever
---
She is worth doing if you are a heavy gunner.  It doesn't take much to craft 50 cal or 5 mm and if you have a gatling laser you can farm fusion cores at the power plant.  Typically I go through about 3K of 50 cal.  Though, lately with the use of magic weapons it takes much less.  I'm in it for the treasury notes, repair kits, and the possibility of extra legendaries.
---
If you think that the Queen isn't worth it, then you must think that A Colossal Problem is a colossal waste of time...   Unless you are just there for the screws, it takes way more resources for a cursed legendary and a few plans.
---
Oh a "If I don't use it no one should" kind of guy , stop crying it's not hurting you in any way , you want more xp use it , you don't want to die from 2-3 hits don't use it , but don't go around telling other people what they should do !
---
Wrong sub.
---
You gotta be ambitious to think they'll actually sticky anything useful at all.
---
Go get your satisfaction from project paradise
---
I'm hyped for new content but I'm nervous about the dmg neft. I dont understand how the nerf will work. it says damage will be stacked additivly instead of multiplicitivly but I thought it already was. lt just seems that the more damage cards and buffs you have, the less damage you will be doing(the nerf will hit you harder). Which kind of defeats the purpose of a well built build. Idk if someone could explain it to me if I'm wrong that would be great.
---
Unfortunately the inflation of prices for everything has made caps a useless payment in most trading communities. People use ammo, but usually it’s futile as they are just as worthless currency as caps due to all the dups.
---
😕
---
Probably not a lot. The nerf was supposed to hit the most bleeding edge builds and it seems to have done that well. The further you are from that bleeding edge the less you will be affected by the nerf.
---
Yeah. We found another good guy exploiter like everyone claimed to be during the last dupe wave. 
---
I'd like to see that work in the real world. Someone gets busted for having a counterfeit money machine in their basement, but uses the line "I wasn't making it for me, I was giving it to kids and my buddies, I didn't use it! I was just helping the community!" when they get caught.
---
I know that's you, Quentin Tarantino
---
Stealth ability.  
---
The lack of shadowed mods on Service armor is going to be much more apparent with very perceptive lvl 100 enemies around.  You lose out on a good portion of stealth capability by not utilizing shadowed mods, or wearing armor that can’t be shadowed.
---
I’m anticipating a lot of “stELTh iS brKn!!!” post because so many players are used to halfassing along with just 30+ AG.  They’re going to be unpleasantly surprised when lvl 100 mutants spot them every time.
---
And all you can do is Ad Hominem. Which I guess I have to point out to you is childish and a fallacy to your argument. You are saying nothing about you and just attacking me for my statements. When you grow up past 5 let me know.
---
Errr, honestly no idea. I never thought about it and always thought team-based perks need the vicinity of team-members to actually work. But now that you mention it... good question!
---
That's awfully good of you. I'll be on tonight (assuming the update has loaded).
---
People with explosives destroying entire waves depriving everyone else of XP
---
Honestly it'd be funny if it deleted their camp and materials
---
It happens with other weapons too sometimes, explosive plasmas, lasers, etc.  I’ve seen it many times at scorched earth, encrypted, and project paradise, and now at a colossal problem
---
It's a good question and I have not seen it covered as PTS doesn't seam to have NW.
---
Logic says that Legendary perks will be disabled for a more level playing field.
---
But nothing concrete till servers are back up.
---
\*equips Enforcer perk\*
---
I agree with you to a point. They give us new items... either to sell atoms, or keep us grinding the new seasons to keep us playing..but i dont think they actually understand or care about their build community. 
---
Majority of items we request over and over are pay items or high level score reward.
---
Exactly. I loved it when the matte black skin came but they need to design new guns rather than paint over everything. As you said though so much more could be implemented than lawn Flamigos with lights. I like camp building and I've made mine based on the game I'm playing, because I love the old versions of the game but 76 building breaks me a little bit inside with the camp builds 🤣. You feel good wandering then all of a sudden that Apcolyptic feel disappears because some guy built the playboy mansion in the mire, dirty hooker included. Jsit to bright and unrealistic, I don't role play but I like a game to feel real, or a real as they can make it. Fallout isn't meant to be bunny rabbits and rainbows.
---
The usual post patch drill. Hang back for a while to see what old bugs resurface and to make sure there are no posts on here about vendor/display exploits.
---
Do you know the spot to place the tent?
---
I prefer it when people don't use this exploit. I'd rather just snipe them. Its more fun. I'll be playing that one more often now.
---
They putting a large update into FO76 right now, so the 76 servers are down. Its maybe the same servers?
---
Probably not as much as people with synergized builds. Buffs are additive now meaning the more buffs you have stacked you'll have a higher % damage decrease from before.
---
I started the 32gb download a bit after 10a EST.  Install finished about 15 minutes ago.
---
getting like 3k exp for 1 shotting an enemy from stealth compared to 300 exp for face tanking the crap out of something and wasting aid items and ammo.
---
i would like it to be less of an advantage. ive got a bloddied build that i dont use because i dislike being low on health.
---
Update is a red Chinese communist plot, confirmed.
---
Nice, I have my main level 315 and all the other level 50...if I understood correctly they will all have 6 slots and 50 perk points. Good.
---
lol yeah that's how i read every patch, a list of things they may have fixed....maybe
---
Exactly right on enemy-specific Legendary weapons. Should have higher damage for being specialized. **Risk needs to be balanced with reward.**
---
Imo, Troubleshooters/hunters/ghoul Slayer etc.. should get that +50% or more. The risk is higher because the weapon won't perform as well against 90% of targets.. but should be better than other options for it's specialty.
---
Nocturnal too now that I think of it... Incremental and time gated effects... Require a lot of foresight for optimal use. There should be no penalty, and should have huge peak damage around midnight.
---
I play junkie and having that general 50% bonus for -2 in a few special (completely negated with Herd Mentality) is nice... But clearly superior to type-specific. Small risk.
---
In my opinion, Berserker should have highest damage (low resistances is more dangerous than low hp, bloodied has many perks that synergize with constant low hp). Massive risk, should carry massive reward.
---
Upvoting would help maybe... MAYbe.
---
But they can still place 100s at a workshop
---
Free travel to factions means I might move my camp close to where thistle spawns
---
Good. That shit along with dodgy etc doesn’t doesn’t belong in NW anyway.
---
Interesting, I hadn't thought of that.
---
I feel like the combat had a free states skin but I'm not 100% on that
---
There is one for combat shotgun but looks like a garbage. No db skin so far. Wish we get super shotgun from doom eternal
---
m8, I have 5 base INT, full health build, so no UNY armor, I skipped 75% os the NW challenges, sure, I could log in everyday to play for couple of hours to grind the daily challenges and I had no auto complete. I didnt farm any XP boosting item. not even sleeping at my camp, I always forgot. aaaand I still finished the pass two weeks before its end. 
---
now they are adding even more weeklies.
---
you’ll be fine, brother!
---
You wait for them to be released in the Atom Shop, whenever that is, and then you buy them with Atoms.
---
Sometimes, aesthetics matter more than practicality.
---
Course, given that you have to manually get all the good rolls yourself, the older sets still have that going for them.  There's really no way I'll be able to surpass my 5/5 Unyielding AP sets.
---
1.  create legendary coins; perks to be chosen in about a week or so
---
2. SCORE - daily and weekly
---
3. Daily Ops  
---
Not exploring the Forest unnecesarily.  It will happen naturally enough by doing events.
---
Make all player camps instanced spaces separate from the world, would make camp budgets irrelevant and exploits a walk in the park.
---
Anything is possible with enough Vintage Nukashine in your system.
---
IGN Meidara, hi there 😊
---
That recently happened to me but I never knew it was because of tent placement
---
Makes sense.
---
Wait, you don't enjoy seeing 2 teslas and 5 explosive gatling plasmas spamming into a crowd and turning your console into a jet engine and your game into a powerpoint?
---
Ok
---
Those perks could actually be worth it now.
---
Did a ctrl-f for framed legendary run wall placement fix and didn't find it?
---
Hey kid you want some t e x t u r e s
---
Well you just kinda proved why it has such an advantage.  You have to use low health.  Not everyone likes that as you pointed out yourself so it is a choice of pros and cons.  I do think that the exp gain from the intelligence should be changed though, it was not an issue before the legendary run but now that you can farm exp to progress in the legendary run it does make me feel like I have to use it because it saves so much time.  Also why would you want it to have less of an advantage if you already dont like being at low health? It would be even less appealing that way
---
I mean I'm just guessing but I was thinking it was the trick using the flamethrower trap.  I'm by no means an experienced builder so I could be wrong.
---
The update is 32 GB.  Obviously, you need drive space for the update file itself - the additional space is for the update file decompressed, then an additional 50 gb (more or less) for the ps4 to backup the existing game files, and a bit more space for the PS4 OS temp workspace while it updates.
---
Once the update is complete and verified, the backup copies and the installer will be deleted.
---
I like them thiick
---
Happened the last 4 times ive done the event.
---
Sometimes if you fast travel away and back again it will cause the enemies to re-spawn in the event area.  
---
But yeah, I've ran into that as well at Poseidon where the spawn ends up between the doors.
---
Yeah, I think I'll just deactivate mine for about a week.
---
Where did you see that?
---
I guess you have a she. Mine is a male 98% of the time
---
Fanbois gotta fanboi...
---
\+15 INT is exactly 30% more XP since you get 2% more XP per INT
---
BFG!
---
They just need to make camp items much more flexible with regards to placement WITHOUT charging atoms to do it.
---
Eat shit or die
---
Poseidon and Line in the Sand are two different events. 
---
And your explaining a one time glitch in the game, vs what he's saying about the event glitching out all the time. 
---
AND, you solved your problem without cheating.
---
Tough luck. He's still exaggerating.
---
Ha. I compare it to a hairdryer and a heater. It's autumn now in our area, it got cold, but my room is warm enough because of the console (and this is not a joke).
---
Thank god. Now I can be harassed by ward free of charge!
---
So what was delayed this time
---
I’m going to miss looting ammo at other people’s camps.
---
Line in the Sand can now go back to being a ghost town.
---
“Event - It’s a Trap - If this event spawns in Cranberry Bog, South-West if Watoga...” 
---
Correction: the SB does spawn, but frequently will draw aggro from creatures/NPCs located at the train repair yard west of the event. To complete the event,  a player will often need to race to the train yard and kill the SB’s opponents; only then will the SB head off in the direction of the event. This situation also happens frequently at the event located near Tanagra Town.
---
Post deleted in 3,2,1...
---
I've lost hundreds of caps to this. I'll take it
---
They just need to revise the whole build system and allow clipping and complete freeform building, with the only limiter being the camp budget.
---
I don't see why they're concerned so much with players building traps or floating camps when there is a simple solution to preventing people from losing their junk to traps.
---
Just make camp areas act like events and make you retain your junk if you die within a camp zone while not in pvp with a player.
---
It needs to be changed back to survival imo.
---
Did you try turning it off and then back on again?
---
Ditto!
---
It fits the very definition of a glass cannon, which is someone who does a lot of damage, but is built more on the fragile side and thus cannot take more than a few hits to the face without dying.
---
It was a glitch where you could blue print the ammo factory that was at the converted munitions workshop
---
They are already talking about instanced camps.
---
Nah, just make them shit out mothman eggs
---
You really are unable to think about this huh? Let me spell it for you since you are having a hard time. You have quoted everything I said because you are unable to think for yourself and bringing any actual intelligent conversation to the mix. You are only capable of saying “haha look what he said” again I don’t have time to argue with people who never took philosophy classes in college. When you do learn to take your own stance rather than berate every convo then we can have a civilized chat but unfortunately you are a long ways away my friend. Good luck.
---
I hope deathclaws are actually scary now instead of butterflies
---
Yet this guy above thinks UNY will take you from 300xp to 3000xp. Lol what is with these people making up complaints about something that isn’t broken...
---
Double wall makes sense in game logic and it's because there isn't an equivalent way to do this in game. 
---
I can't speak for the flamer one but changing farm tiles into floors so you have plants growing directly out of wood or concrete makes no sense and breaks the in-world logic.
---
Yeah, I don't see this issue blowing up at all. However, good luck if it does.
---
I mean I have a porto potty in my camp and I have yet defecated once inside it. It just... works
---
I’ll be on tomorrow around 8pm
---
no need to report that kind of stuff... earning 5k experience every 30sec might have raise a flag ;)
---
sucks because they glitch out so often aswell and you have to reset the game and hear her fucking voice again
---
Cheating is cheating, don't be a douche and cheat.
---
Dont worry, anything can be milked with enough determination friend!
---
Hmmm, well it’s been pretty well documented in this forum and elsewhere online, and it has gotten better for me personally, almost never happens at scorched earth anymore.  But it did happen many times at line in the sand.  That event really got boring again once the novelty wore off so I quit doing it anyway.    Glad to hear others aren’t experiencing it so much either!
---
Lmao I’m so glad my gf won’t be coming over tonight because she’d just be ignored for the evening 😂😂
---
Yeah cause 76 effecting fallout 4 is the wrong sub
---
Haven't heard of it, what does it mean? You just don't eat anymore? Why?
---
This is the only aspect that seems like it could be good, if true.
---
My update was also around 32GB
---
You broke it. (It’s a feature)
---
You would claim the workshop and blueprint the machines, it was that simple.
---
Floating shit castle with a big ole dance floor.
---
How long did it take?
---
Thank you for acknowledging that this post added nothing.
---
I've done 3 ACPs and 1 SBQ events today, visited Smiley and bought gold, ran away from a lvl9 I gave plans and items to because he initiated a trade and it initiated my social anxiety, and thought about how my junkies build would never be the same after today.. 😁
---
When doing bug testing with assaultron heads and cryolators, you bet that bitch was the target practice
---
Thank the holy mothman for healing salve and its extra lubricating ingredients!
---
I play full melee and unyielding isn't really an option for me, at least I have been told from people who do run bloodied and unyielding (level 500+). At level 320 I feel like I have missed a ton of experience. I could be vats 1 shotting things from a mile away and earning much more experience while taking much less damage.
---
Everyone runs bloodied unyielding because the benefits are so much more greater than everything else, that should make anyone aware that there is an issue. There was an excryptid event and nobody else would take a pylon because out of 8 people only two didn't run bloodied/unyielding. I put on my block gear and wasted 50 stims just for the event to fail.
---
That's a sweet idea
---
This isn’t a trading post!!! Maybe if your read what I typed you would understand that I’m asking for a safe trading system to be implemented into the game ..(when bots can’t read this is what happens) hey moderator can you please not have these bots post these comments in my post thanks!!
---
You can do most of the challenges in about 30mins (the daily’s atleast) it’s probably do able for most people. But for people that can’t because of family or Job etc. Bethesda said there will be more double score weeks during this season so maybe people can benefit from it
---
oh look, more skins for the handmade assault rifle. where is the combat rifle/fixer love? AND HOW ABOUT SKINS FOR GUNS THAT HAVE ZERO SKINS! LIKE THE LMG, GATLING LASER/PLASMA, OR GUASS RIFLE!
---
I hope she gets her head stuck in a cone of shame
---
They should bring back the grab attacks from fallout 4 nothing makes you piss your pants more than when you lose control of your character, automatically turn behind and get slammed or thrown up in the air by a death claw 😂😂😂
---
Who down votes dark souls?! 😦🙁
---
I did that once before 327 tickets.....
---
"do you have a....claim ticket?  Checking....claim ticket."
---
Remember this words "it just works"😆
---
Would youblike to see my void
---
House
---
Because PS4 updates essentially create a copy and then deletes the older version, so you need enough drive space for two copies. There's more to it than that, but that's the basic jist.
---
it's almost like no one is thinking this through.
---
3 then 2 with a little bit of 5 for me. At least getting the one legendary perk I'm sure about (What Rads) and I'll make a start clearing out cards I know I don't want, just to make card swapping easier.
---
Then checking the SCORE challenges to decide what to do today. And travelling to crater to carry on the rep grind (that's the 5 mentioned earlier if you wondering). I'm probably not doing 4 unless there's a neat event in the Forest to do, I'll just see how my damage seems while playing normally.
---
For Daily Ops I still need a couple more level ups to get decent stuff swapped in for Stealth and Covert Operative e.g. been working on Dodgy but don't have it up to max stars yet.
---
O wel didnt read to much about it, this game can be wierd sometimes
---
When folk use bloodied auto grenade launchers doing that shit on everyone, I just stand at the spawns with my bloodied plasma rifle with flamer attatchment, roast the entire spawn groups then spin to them and stare at them giving the ole "Thumbs up" emote until they stop
---
Lol someone was mentioning this last night and no one believed him.
---
In....pleasant valley....
---
All this shit and still
---
No fast travel fix ?
---
Im done.
---
Save your gold for Lunchboxes, which will sell three for 100 Gold Bullion as of today.
---
Uninstalling completely
---
My IGN is Fullytron. From UK and play pretty much every night.
---
Thank you for commenting on my pointless post with a pointless comment, I feel closer to you now.
---
Rng 🙁
---
Altho solar is always 3 stars
---
Yup!  I let all the thieves run free. Except the Blood Eagles. Those bastards never want to talk.
---
It's random. Pray to RNGesus and maybe it will grace you.
---
Glitching discords that I won't name
---
I wish it would also work on the combat rifle/fixer as it has its own mesh, animations, and holding position. there is no reason on why it cant be for the combat rifle/fixer
---
IGN MrsNekrosias. I'm usually on after 8 PM est.
---
Safe to assume its gonna be a minute
---
I had no idea because I'm lazy and never read about this game.
---
It would actually get me to play NW haha
---
No, it shares the slots but each char has to level up cards
---
that's the best news!!
---
An honest question here. Do you really believe it's not broken? Join any party of higher level players and they all run it. At least on XBOX. I even see lower levels running it. I would estimate over half of all players run that combination.
---
Whether it's for insane damage or more experience, it is absolutely more beneficial to run it than anything else. **Nothing else comes close to giving as much damage and level progress**. That should tell you that something is wrong. I don't think lifting up other builds is going to fix this either.
---
Players: This game is unplayable because of bugs!
---
Bethesda: \*Fixes Bugs\*
---
Players: Oh you fixed the bug that made the event easier and exploitable? Don't fix THAT one.
---
:\\
---
They are lucky they didn't get bans/suspensions tbh.
---
There is a guy that was apparently banned from the subreddit that is famous for his builds named TYR. He has the best builds possible
---
So is the enemies level going to follow me all the way or is it stil capped at whatever it is now
---
Yeah, from the last season this was the item I was most excited about. But the interface is so absolutely terrible, both before and after it was tweaked. I even removed it from my camp - just didn't feel worth the camp budget it took up. The thing is too big also IMO. Bad design all round.
---
This makes me nervous about the other future update I was excited to hear about surrounding perk card loadouts... I wonder if they'll butcher the interface to that also making it just as slow and tedious to swap loadouts as it is now to swap individual cards around.
---
You own a pickup truck with a lift kit only on the front wheels don't you.
---
We can tell =)  Folks make posts all the time with "Ideas" that are already in the works or have been brought up so many times that they are actually not allowed to be posted anymore.  That is why I just wanted to let you know that it was already a thing that Beth is looking at.
---
Do you want to be the big spoon or the little spoon?
---
Ok so here’s my story. I got secret service Arms and chest first. Roll each piece twice and got 3 star unyielding for all 3 pieces. I said man that’s easy. So I got the legs..... I rolled those legs 80 times each and then finally I got them to be 3 star unyielding. I didn’t have the weapon weight reduction I wanted back then being I was still using my armor to let me hoard more. But then when I switched my build to be a bloodied stealth commando I actually had good prefixes on it like agility and stealth. So I don’t wanna have to roll anymore since the legs killed me. Like after rolling the legs that much I don’t even craft the weapons. The gauss shotty I rolled once and got a 2 star bloodied one never rolled again. Plasma caster I rolled once got a assassins never rolled again. The mini the best I got was a two shot and the pistol I got was junkies. I did how ever just get a 3 star bloodied plasma from Beckett’s alley quest other night and I got a vampires mini from purveyor. It’s all rng and it sucks but it makes it exciting when you roll the piece you’re looking for
---
Fast Travel: It is now free to Fast Travel to Foundation and Crater.  
---
About time.
---
I think the patch notes stated you will have the max number of slots unlocked on all characters based on your highest level character. So if you have a lvl 300+ all 6 slots will be available. 
---
It also stated the ranks are completely separate though, so your lvl 300 toon with a rank 3 card won't be available on your lvl 50.
---
I had last update , completed legendary run as well, I don't have best internet speed, oh well time to upgrade line speed.
---
Did you go to manage game? I can't seem to get mine to show up.
---
Have they fixed it tho or just made it as so you can't place the tent on the road anymore? If so what happens to the tents that are placed there already. Will they stay or have to move them. So many questions 😂
---
And the sad thing is that most of these will probably never be fixed. 
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser turning red with beam focuser* modification applied bug has been there since launch for example. And the fact they made the Black Matter skin work for the fixer variant but haven’t made laser rifle skins work for the ultracite laser rifle variant just goes to show how unaware the devs are. 
---
Also, seeing those Power Armor visual bugs with the gaps and all makes me believe the T-65 is bugged as well as it has several gaps around the arms and chest that shows the frame underneath and it always looked very unnatural.
---
Am I missing something? Is rebuilding a CAMP supposed to be a punishment?
---
Check if that damn vertibird power armor is in the atom shop.
---
Happened to me once. 5pm is when they change over in the UK, and the new daily and weekly ones came in with some completed and some half complete. Looks like they'd counted everything I'd done that day (from midnight onwards) towards the challenges, auto-completing some but not paying them. I lost about 6000 potential points then.
---
unfortunatly idk because i dont have this tent and  I've only seen it once
---
It's a lot of fun.
---
I don’t think that was a one wasteland thing, either way I don’t like the idea of removing the debug. I don’t know why they need to keep making an easy game easier.
---
No shit you're gonna be sick of it after 1000 hours lol. Some of us are nowhere close to that, so we can just keep playing.
---
Might wanna watch leakers videos. They’re making vaults for us that are instances. Budget will be more and we can do more
---
It's per character, if you scrap your level 600 perks in hope you can boost your other main it won't work, if you own a level 300+, your new character will have the 6 slot tho
---
Happens all the time with my pump shotty !!!
---
See this excuse is acceptable. I don't have an Xbox but from what I understand, there has been a drought as it seems Microsoft is more interested in supporting its future systems. This is an acceptable excuse.
---
But for people who have PCs... and access to a big catalog....
---
Last I heard it was only working as intended on leather, but maybe also on Combat according to Angryy Turtle.
---
People play because they enjoy playing. Why should someone who enjoys the game justify why they want to play it? Why do you like to play any game that you like? Just let people enjoy a game and piss off with negativity.
---
19.4 GB on PC. Came home from work and just wanted to relax and play a bit Fallout 76. Turned on the PC and as soon as I saw the update I knew my day was ruined. 2 Hours left of downloading...
---
Took about 45min to download, waiting on servers now
---
It works with literally any gun, if you've ever swapped weapons back and forth to see your mag completely empty you've actually caused the polar opposite effect of the glitch which in a sense means you did it backwards without realising :P
---
I need my daily fo76 hit , oh no what am I going to do today with all this free time :( my update time is 50hours on my slow line..
---
What ideas aren't allowed? I'd love to know lol
---
Why is it so hard for some people to grasp the fact that maybe we just enjoy different things..?
---
Edit: I mostly play out of boredom and still enjoy the game after 500 or so hours.
---
That bonus really worth it though? With four people it’s only what a 4-5% increase right. With one person it’s only 1-1.5%
---
Or Fo 1/2
---
I don’t think they will add night vision to to Ranger helmet since it could be considered “Pay to Win”, but the light makes sense. As for the ash pile thing, I don’t think that’s how making ash piles works. The laser from a laser rifle is a powerful concentration of energy that can turn things into ash. The Tesla rifle is concentrated energy as well. The flamer is just a continuous blasting of fire. I don’t think small electrical shocks would turn enemies into ash. The Shiskebab could probably charr a body but not turn it to ash.
---
&gt; You really are unable to think about this huh? Let me spell it for you since you are having a hard time. You have quoted everything I said because you are unable to think for yourself and bringing any actual intelligent conversation to the mix. You are only capable of saying “haha look what he said” again I don’t have time to argue with people who never took philosophy classes in college. When you do learn to take your own stance rather than berate every convo then we can have a civilized chat but unfortunately you are a long ways away my friend. Good luck. 
---
Rhetorical question. Condescension. Conclusion not based on the evidence, coupled with more ad hominem hypocrisy and a touch of superiority complex. Straw man fallacy coupled with provable lie i.e. this whole comment thread. Another straw man fallacy with more superiority complex (more overt this time) and hey, look at that, our old friend the ad hominem hypocrisy again. Insincere close.
---
I just pity you now. I really do.
---
I think we're done here. Thanks for playing. Better luck next time.
---
There is one also in the season pass. Edit: I think I am mistaken, there doesn't seem to be one.
---
So that's what all those Line in the Sand posts were talking about.
---
Who needed +4 luck lol
---
Low levels can destroy their level one enemies meaning high levels tag them and low levels finish them off, how the turntables
---
if you have slow internet, even a extra 5gb is a nightmare
---
I think they're showing the uncompressed sizes.
---
Probably because, much like Rust players, Fallout 76 players have become hostile and black like this poster.
---
Some players act like dicks because they don't want people asking legit questions about their game.
---
Others become dicks because their base was destroyed and their corpses eaten in the dead of night when they were offline.
---
I don't even have a vendor at my camp cuh
---
Yeah well on Xbox game preview when Conan exiles was on there every time the released a patch you had to always download the whole game again. But damn 80 gb is rough it’s like a call of duty game lol
---
The cheat should be stop
---
This was 20 hours into a 30 hour job. If you've ever been to a data center and wonder why they have a lounge with couches and a TV...that's why.
---
See ya kid.
---
Sure. Keep on exploiting. Bethesda will eventually fix it
---
I don’t understand this “not worth it” stuff. When you are level 150+, very little in this game is challenging and the SBQ and Earle are the two things that get close to it. If you aren’t willing to use resources in the few actual challenging events, then when DO you use them? That’s WHY you have resources...to use them!
---
Just wait and try it. It's difficult to explain, but don't worry... you won't find a level 5 having an equally easy time strolling the bog as a high level player with good gear.
---
It just won't be impossible for them, or as easy as it is now for you.
---
I can see you flying straight at the cargo bot with a rolling pin winding up to smack it
---
It ruined the feel of a battle where it's you and *maybe* one other guy running back and forward because a few of the enemies just sit there?
---
It was obviously an unintended feature, also known as an exploit, but it was damn fine while it lasted. It inspired me to work in a Rank 3 Ground Pounder as I want my reloads to still be as fast as I can get them.
---
Right hand side in the Sub rules.

Mind ~&gt; blown
---
What do you mean changed back? NW didn’t replace survival. They were both there at the same time.
---
RIP to me... A few weeks ago a low level asked to join me, and I invited him to a group, so he went to my camp and built and ammo factory in my living room.
---
I've been building my camp in that spot since the beta and no one ever has their camp there and now I have to start from scratch. :(
---
Because I enjoy the game, and how I choose to spend my free time doesn’t affect or concern you.
---
It’s odd that you’re seeking justifications for actions that have no impact on your life.
---
Who knows? Beth being Beth.
---
The things didn't cause that much visual lag, really--
---
The mothman version was your average black fog machine, with tiny projectors near the fog machine that showed spinning mothman logos on the ground (which you'd probably miss anyway, depending on where you placed it)
---
The Halloween one just put out an orange fog with flying bat particles
---
unintentional features = exploits... to Bethesda any way. The last Code of conduct basically says if you do anything "unintentional" it's a bannable offense....BS.
---
I think if the game has a glitch it should be fair game ,my opinion,probably be downvoted to silence for it but in fallout 76 it’s really you against the game
---
Legacy camp FTW
---
That's the official notes from Bethesda. The numbers you see on downloader usually don't reflect the actual size. Like you would sometimes see the download size to be 60BG when actually it's closer to 5GB.
---
Piss off ghost.
---
Not sure. But, probably not, since it's mostly only a texture change. and the map UI is not a part of the main hud.
---
This was my thought too, why even bother ranking it up if this changes? And the accuracy bump with one rank is pretty poor. Will test it out before making a decision for sure. But those 33% vats hit chance rifles might be even more important for vats users.
---
Play a real building game - Minecraft.  Seriously, I've given up on Fallout '76 as a building platform - it's just too god damn frustrating between the bugs and Bethesda constantly changing how things work.
---
Pistols can be pretty decent, as long as you get Adrenaline going and are meta.  But the Gauss Pistol still being kneecapped by broken VATS hurts.
---
TBF, it is a change that was asked for multiple times here. So they tried to give players something they wanted. 
---
But you are right, the weapons still aren't worth the inventory space.
---
Sorry I'm not English but what is an instanced camp?
---
Lucky I don’t have any at all
---
This was my issue when I was melee. I just stood there waiting for her to land, and then she never did. Now I am specced to range, I was hoping to do the favor to make her land for the other melee guys. But then I read it doesnt work and I got sad. Not I got happy again.
---
It will block them. If you load in and your tent is blocked, it won't load, just like a camp
---
At first i thoight i would hate instanced vaults, because i hate loading screens but i realized that i already fast travel to everyones camp most likely in the middle of nowhere, ala loading screen so that eased my mind a bit.
---
What about berserker damage numbers with med x and psycho addictions
---
Good. That was getting super-annoying.
---
They would have had to ban thousands of people. The servers would have been super empty.
---
You buy them from the atom store when they're available. They're not part of season 2 rewards.
---
This is really useful thankyou. And thankyou for the list from console players! When it says scrap box: 20 is that for ALL of the scrap boxes? I always had thought some were more expensive but I guess not
---
I was told it's much more of a hassle than ranged and I attempted it and got chewed up by super mutants very quickly. Weapons don't really matter too much with adrenal and low hp/uny. You could use a board and still 1 shot things. It wasn't so much about killing them as it was about not dying while running WT super mutants.
---
It just didn't seem viable. When I switch to my gunner character it has 95% hit chance from a mile away. It seems like it would benefit much more with quicker and safer kills.
---
I will see what this damage nerf does and think about if I want to really respec my character. Can you share your build?
---
You won’t regret it when u get a Warglaive
---
But this isn't a "different thing"
---
That's the point of my post. You've been playing the same thing since 2018.
---
Like this isn't World of Warcraft where updates are frequent, meaningful, and steady. 
---
It's like Bethesda makes a change to how a gun works, and suddenly that's good enough reason for people to keep playing for another year.
---
like... what?
---
Dont worry, should be coming in patch 17390
---
Absolutely NOT. 
---
Part of the fun of the game, for a very large segment of the players, is the fact they can have camps in the world, fully accessible without having to zone it. And it's awesome and yes, I would stop playing if they took that away.
---
with double xp and all xp boost it was around 9000xp per shot every 11seconds
---
Looks like scorchbeast meats back on the menu boys!
---
Thanks Internet Explorer!
---
They may not do a great job of it, but they definitely have a QA team looking at everything before it hits the PTS. The problem is that QA teams in general know nothing about the application they're testing. They're just good at documenting.
---
No, it's a reskin of the handmade.
---
what do they care, their camp was ammo converters
---
Cashing in my 350 or so perk card packs...I stopped opening them when shitty cards were clogging everything up.
---
It frustrates people because it feels like the only bugs they fix are the ones we like. If it benefits the player, its fixed quickly. If it breaks a fundamental quest for progression, takes months.
---
It'll get posted when it's available
---
Gigabit Internet is your friend....my update finished in less than 30 mins.
---
Sometimes they do minor changes and fixes to NW during the updates, even if nothing NW related is mentioned in the patch notes.
---
Got a lotta haters and a lot of homies,
---
Some friends and some phony.
---
I salute you sir, well played
---
I really don't understand why there is so much hostility. I am asking WHY people enjoy playing this game.
---
For example, I enjoyed playing this game because I forbid myself from using fast travel (Which I think should be in the game by default) but it made it feel more like a sim. I made my own fun by role playing a little.
---
Does anyone else do this?  
---
I really fucking hate these "because I like it" answers. You're thinking i'm attacking you, and i'm not.
---
35 fb here .. 12 minutes left to be fully downloaded zzzzzz
---
Because it's a cool trick you can use to place camp items closer together for these tiny prefabs they sell to us. I'm assuming people who dont care about this glitch aren't camp builders
---
Best selection yet
---
Because you are on PS4 and Sony makes you backup the entire game.
---
It's delayed today. I think there's an update or something. Haven't seen any posts about it.
---
Ahhh you got me!
---
I up-voted your post because it was a valid question, the others are just having a bad day because of the patch download so are down-voting everything here at the moment.
---
Yeah, and the fact that this is posted literally hours before a significant content drop is hilarious. 
---
OP acts like they are truly inquisitive but all their really trying to do is stir up some drama so they can get into arguments and debates.
---
Even then the ammo economy was 1c per ammo. You were not selling 556, 45, FC, 2mm, or 50 for anything more than 1.
---
Best update of the year.
---
Is it live? Are perk coin account wide like eso champions point?
---
Cheers for the answer :) and gutting, well its was good as long as it lasted
---
Because Fallout as a franchise are probably my favorite games I've played and the social aspect of being able to play 76 with my friends allows me to look past some of the issues with the game. It also helps that I started playing right after Wastelanders dropped so the game still has plenty for me to explore and I didn't go through the horror show that was the first year(ish) of the game.
---
Poor you.
---
I wonder if magic shotguns still work. Finally used some and it was nice for things that were super spongey.
---
&gt;ammo factories cannot be placed anymore if blueprinted
---
YES, thank you. I have been changing ammo factories to Gamma rounds for the past 2-3 weeks. This is a good fix!
---
It should be updated when servers come back.  Nobody knows what's in it today though.
---
ahh okay thankyou
---
You could make some cool things with it. I'll miss it, but I'm not going to complain as long as they keep making fixes.
---
I rolled all 3* pieces the first time I crafted any armor or weapon with legendary modules.
---
Hyperfiber is your friend 2gbps internet soon to be 10gbps ....
---
Yeah I get what you’re saying but I was mainly meaning for like events like leader of the pack. Now instead of just doing for the challenges we can get viable legendaries from them
---
That would be financial suicide though. 
---
You do get that right? 
---
Not everything is black and white
---
that event is crap with out the tent in place 
---
with it in place you get a bit of lag yes. but everyone gets a chance to tag everything that spawns  and that = loot and = xp equally shared by everyone there 
---
personally i use a explosive shotgun, take 2 shots when everything spawns doing about 1 - 2 dmg per mob, and then i stop shooting to let everyone tag in 
---
i wish all  events could be like this 
---
its sad that the main complaint that everyone has is there is a lack of spawn to kill. and the currency limits are stopping us from playing 
---
its really like beth wants us to stop playing
---
Yep, started the update now, looks about 7 hours. So hopefully it's done by the time I'm off work 🤞
---
Yo it doesn’t matter whether or not I’m wearing a stealth suit, I’ve only ever been able to damage another player once the entire time I’ve been playing, even when they clearly have pacifist off. It’s bloody ridiculous
---
I enjoy camp building, but don’t feel the need to use exploits to do so.
---
I switch my perks around constantly to experiment, but tbh if you’re dying super often as a Bloodied melee, I think you don’t have the proper defense perks set up / strong DR armor. The key to surviving mobs as a UNY melee is boosting your swing speed and DR as much as possible
---
I wonder how much of my PS4’s lifespan has been consumed copying fo76 updates.
---
There is? Don't remember seeing that.
---
I didn’t plan for the perks and I’m not sure why
---
If I was a developer on the game and I asked "Why do you enjoy playing my game" would you give them such a pissy answer? 
---
Think and then answer again please.
---
way to take advantage of our queen
---
I hope so.
---
Oh just wait. Days from now people will still be posting about it, acting like they were the first to discover it.
---
&gt; If you don't show me a camp with 3 windmills by the vendors then I won't believe whatever you have to say.
---
dude you're talking about stuff you don't even know. I'm not going to sit here and try to teach a fool.
---
Your replies will not be read.
---
Adding legendary perks and making a TON of ammo, gonna need it with One Wasteland
---
This\^\^ now I'll start doing the event again on public.
---
This is the main thing.  For 3 SPECIAL points, you'd kind of *expect* it to function like this.  That's almost the whole point, that you'll get this 95% accuracy if you missed the first couple shots.
---
Wait, so the family of 5 mutated opossums that spawn outside of camp are now replaced by a horde of heavy hitting Super Mutants? (Takes Gauss Rifle off display board)
---
This game should have been free to play and not a full price release.
---
Nuclear Winter keeps me playing. I still hop into adventure mode occasionally.
---
I hope they don't screw up even the perk loadouts system... It must be simple as a emote wheel but with the various loadouts to choose from.
---
Anyway i agree, the ammo converter could potentially be one of the most useful C.A.M.P. item, instead it's just a pile of crap.
---
I wonder what new bugs were getting this time.
---
lol good
---
You can get the top rewards (i.e. a Bear Arm plan) with only two alive, but it's a much lower drop chance.
---
But, yeah, good luck on getting enough players together on a public server to even achieve that...
---
Aw, the simple life of a character under level 50.
---
Ammo one def because I love ammo. Lol and then prob the special ones so I can max another perk out
---
and here i was looking forward to playing after work 😂
---
Out of the house but have my ps4 on rest mode. Hoope it actually begins dling it so that by the time I get back home I can play
---
You can also sync your phone and PS4 so you don't need to go in the quick menu.
---
30gb+ for me, xbox. Got 30 mins left out of 112 mins
---
Is "What Rads?" still available? Cause I'm freaking taking it.
---
I know what you meant, my sarcasm was because they demonstrably offer a lot more new content than that
---
I highly doubt that, ever use the rug glitch? Or the shelve glitch? What about the double sided walls that produced a petition to get it back into the game last patch?
---
I’m level 131
---
HTOWN WHAT IT DO BABY
---
well thats an event  I wont won't go to ever again.
---
It'll go live when the servers come back up.
---
So we still have magic weapons?
---
I may be in the minority, but adjusting damage calculations. I don’t bother with min/max builds because I play to enjoy the content. It sucks going to an event to have people one-shot all the leggies.
---
I think one is the the Seasons system as a reward
---
You can no long glitch the ammo factory from the workshop into your camp. Bethesda decide to both patch that and force anyone who has one built to completely rebuild your camp.
---
For people who frequently changed their camp, not a big loss, they’ll just build a new one.
---
For those who had their perfect base, well...
---
I’m glad I never learned how to do that.
---
probably some heavy guns one or the ammo one
---
How? Is there a new area to explore?
---
New Raids?
---
how about a basic one that shouldn't be too hard for Bethesda.
---
New Events??!
---
Because we all love doing Mama Dolches for the billionth time right?
---
But what have they REALLY changed?
---
They made a new perks sytem (system changes)
---
They scaled the enemies (system changes)
---
It bothers me I can't kill my brahmin for meat. Melons restore hunger with carnivore though. Why? Who knows.
---
While it can be toned down, let's be honest: Only recharging the core would make it the worst legendary perk. I'm swimming in cores even though I use them actively in weapons and jetpack.
---
Fair enough, just thought it would help people sad about their camps building budgets.
---
Same with angry turtle
---
I don’t know why they’re holding off, I bet they’d sell a lot. And especially now as there’s the biggest update since wastelanders
---
If the Leader of the Pack wolves spawn as three star, I’ll be doing it every time.  One star, maybe I’ll do it if I need to bang out a quick event for a challenge.
---
Invited a guy to my team and he built one at my camp. At first I didn't know what it was, did some research and scrapped my whole camp and started over. Hopefully that took care of everything.
---
Ever visited gaming subs before, they’re almost all the same
---
Sometimes you just have to do a bit of scrolling
---
It doesn't matter is players complained about it, if it was affecting some back-end stability.
---
Bravo
---
Track record isnt exactly the best in the camp build aspect right? What harmful glitch included the double sided walls last patch? They said it was a mistake, I'm assuming this is also a mistake
---
Well I’m glad that I can possibly have it downloaded by time I get off work. Trying to leave early from work being wife and kids actually went to parents house. So I can game and no one will ever know lol
---
I don't like the SS rolling mechanics. My favourite set is my Marine Unyielding set, and my SS armor needs two pieces of "no falling damage" to be effective. I have those pieces, but I said to myself: 'do I want to roll for the perfect pieces or jetpack fun is enough?' And that's it. 
---
It is more fun to check vending machines and buy things from other people than to get locked inside the Rusty Pick and craft, scrip and destroy in the dark.
---
I didn't know we could only still play games that receiving meaningful updates. We better spread the word then, don't want people accidentally enjoying an inferior game.
---
* Guys, everyone quit playing classic games, there's not been any meaningful updates to them.
---
There, I hope they all got the message. Everyone should download WoW now, those updates are more steady and more meaningful than we've ever experienced!
---
Meh... you dont even need Gigabit internet. Mine is 200mbs per second but when I put my ps4 in sleep mode it seems to be like 500+. lol
---
The camps would still be on the map, you would simply 'zone' into it when approaching or through fast travel.
---
I put mine down last night because for over two weeks it's not given me any milk. The replacement gave me 5 first try
---
I agree, one of my faves is scorched earth and I can hardly get there before the queen is dead
---
Do you ever actually even get hit? I ran my friend through close quarters with a rifle build and had to use like 1 stim waiting for him to tag everything first. I guess at the SBQ you might.
---
I both love and hate your face. =)
---
😂 I have a large friend list but it's just because 99.9 of people in this community are awesome and super helpful and a few I trade with also.
---
I still mix an match. Only SS I have is Torso for the jet pack
---
See if I can finish Ounce of Prevention quest. I'm at level 30. Haven't played much in the last 2 weeks. At level 30.
---
This is good news. Looks like I'll be finding a way to take enforcer.

Not everyone is running a bloddied sneak build , I use bloddied heavy no pa , and I like unyielding for the various bonuses even if bolstering would benefit me more , and to answer your question yes , I do get hit plenty of times I do die a lot but still use it because I like it . My set is unyielding weapon weight reduction I carry a arsenal of heavy guns because I like to use them all and and this specific combination of effects helps me menage my weight and enjoy the game Whitout being overcarry every 10min 🤷‍♂️
---
I think I am going to go this route too... I have too many maxed out cards and want to uber up my characters.
---
just loaded into a random server and spent the scrip.
---
Weird. I never had to install it. Game launches right away
---
Thanks I'll go read that sometime, but I probably won't.
---
Wouldn’t call £20 a full price release for a triple A
---
Also the amount of content we get for free anyway is a blessing, would’ve been another 20 quid dlc each time we got something like wastelanders or even wild Appalachia
---
Could you post a pic of the atom shop?
---
Thanks. Gonna wait a while until people make posts about the new bugs and broken atom shop items.
---
So out of curiosity, are C.A.M.Ps that have a bootyhole load of ammo factory’s still able to repair them or are they sol if they get destroyed?
---
Legendary peeeeerrrrrrrkkkkkkkkkkkks yeah baby !
---
I should probably mention - my gamer tag is UCGSQUAWK
---
honestly if you just play a couple hours daily you fcan easily finish it early
---
I wonder how many Flamingo Units the lighted rebar legged flamingos will cost
---
It just depends on play style. Everyone has different priorities and I can see why people might want that perk. I'm looking at taking damage boosting and team based perks
---
I’m sure there’s a lot of other people who do the same, or are appealed to different aspects that didn’t catch your interest.
---
is tht in the score system? i thought that skin looked different
---
I’m kinda bummed that they’re these giant metal boxes that stick out like a sore thumb. I guess I get it for PA but not sure why we can’t just have the normal mannequin displays from FO4 for normal clothes.
---
Oh, well there go my hopes. Maybe we'll get more survival aspects in adventure mode one day.
---
I have a question about the special ones -- I know they don't let you put more perks in than 15, but do they let you go over 15? I've seen videos that suggest they do e.g. "Get strength on a melee build as 5 more strength is extra damage \[even if already at 15\]"
---
That's what I'm saying, regardless of the patch 22 outcome, we need to come together and kick ass! Also Dark Souls is 💖
---
Human NPCs and Factions was huge, and that was the reason I came back and sunk another 100 hours into the game.
---
But from what I understand, that has been the only really big content additions to the game... and one that just NEEDED to be added.
---
I don't consider changes to a player progression system to be "content" nor do I consider a scaling patch for enemies to be "content"
---
Quests, new NPCs, NEW PLACES TO EXPLORE... That is content.
---
yeah because its none of their business why the fuck i do anything. 
---
1k hours of course youre gonna be bored. 
---
id say do something that makes you happy rather than be critical of what makes other people happy. 
---
on the point of under leveled, this update everything will match your level.
---
Patch 23
---
- Fixed bug that creates a black hole due to an issue with new weapons
---
- New deflated kickball texture
---
- Stimpaks now heal 2 rads and -20651 HP
---
- Fixed bug that crashes game when approaching Ward at foundation
---
Same here! Additional points is all I need. Weapons get boring quickly and I want to be able to quickly change builds.
---
I didn't say any of that. I'm just saying that people feel frustrated, because the game's two problems are the grind and the bugs, and it often fells like the only bugs they fix are the ones that make it less grindy.
---
Daily Ops are being added today... basically new raids in 4 different locations that are new every day. 
---
We just got a large new event a couple weeks ago (a colosal problem). 
---
We just had a large update in April that added new questlines, weapons, human NPCs, allies (wastelanders)
---
We have a new BOS expansion coming in a few months. 
---
Clearly you are just trolling.
---
I thought the same thing when I first got 76 running on my new TV. But at the time I was using the HDMI cable that came with the PS4. Then I shelled out for an 8K capable, HDMI 2.1 cable and the results were amazing. Colors pop and aren't washed out. Darks are crisp... Something to consider.
---
The sooner you get our missing property the better.  But even worse, I was getting a quest and he says something like, "remember that medical scanner you killed a guy for? turns out we have like 10 of them but it was the principle of the thing"
---
you're going to have to install an update today unfortunately .once you get started join a public team, building teams are good for getting more XP. You don't need to engage with your team mates to get the benefits of being in a team.
---
Don't be scared of higher level players, people who enjoy griefing other players tend not to play this game for long, I'ts just not for them.
---
 Players trying to get your attention may be wanting to leave you a gift. use the hello emote and a thumbs up if this is the case.
---
look out for an event called leader of the pack, It pops up in the top left part of the map and is an easy way to get Legendary items early on.
---
Nobody wants to buy grenades, mini nukes or missiles.
---
After you have scrapped items get into the habit of bulking junk, this enables you to sell to vendors at the train stations.
---
Once you have a vending machine at your camp junk sells quickly, sell loose screws at around 3 caps each. Bulk Lead, Oil and Springs sell for 40 caps per unit Aluminium,Copper and Adhesive for 50 caps per unit. I sell bulk steel for 15 caps per.
---
Drinking Nukashine will send you off on an adventure you may not be ready for.
---
I used over 1500 scrip and everyone one of them was put back into the scrip machine. They were mainly nocturnal/ suppressors/ beserkers.
---
Yeah, unlike Season 1, this one doesn't appeal to me as much.  I like the weight bench.  I also like the greenhouse tiles.  And that's about it... and unfortunately, they are on completely opposite ends of the board.
---
The Communist stuff just doesn't appeal to me.
---
I think after the novelty has worn off or the people who farm non stop until they have all the plans have gone away most ops will end up needing to be soloed so learning now is best bet probably
---
The marine tactical helm, which looks like a wetsuit hood, protects against air and waterborne hazards. You only need one item to protect yourself while adventuring in water or the smoke.
---
Most likely they will do exactly what they did with Wastelanders. Probably a new set of non PA like the SS armor and probably a new set of PA. Either way I am getting 5k bullion and waiting.
---
Yup. Game on!
---
VICTORY SCREECH
---
Not bad for 360 picks. Good stuff’s drop rate is always dropped during ‘sales’, yet you still got a few keepers.
---
To answer your question the trading keeps me invested, there’s a lot to play around with but not a lot of ways to get specific things, it helps to keep it fresh for me.
---
There's a ton of glitches Bethesda knows about but leaves in the game because the community finds them as useful tools in the game. They reintroduced the double wall glitch last patch right? Why? Because it was a mistake on their part, and that didn't violate TOS right? Not to mention the other camp building glitches that aren't even mentioned. 
---
But I can stand still for 5 minutes waiting to fast travel or watch people play with their glitches magic weapons, hacks on the PC, and legacy weapons you cant even get anymore... or or the countless amounts of Christmas presents that are now the new currency making caps obsolete
---
Daily Ops is brand new content, and it’s a repeatable Event for you and your team, with tiered rewards. 
---
It’s basically a mini-raid. 
---
And Vault 94 is opening for exploration as well. No raid timer. 
---
It seems like you haven’t stayed current with the upcoming changes and think it’s just ‘system updates’.
---
I will defer to you then, I could have sworn there was an armor ace themed stand, guess I was wrong.
---
Nothing special really ..nothing free
---
Too bad that they didn't apply it to Windigos as well...   Now that would have made Assassin's at least worth keeping...
---
I mean we already have Zealots, Ghoul Slayers, Mutant Slayers, Hunter's, etc.  The only class that doesn't have it's own form of weapons are Cryptids.
---
That was the legendary effect, not the explosive class weapons themselves. Missile launchers used to look even sillier when a minigun dealt more explosive damage per second than them.
---
Laziness is my guess. One model and one system used to display two distinct sets of items.
---
What BoS content?
---
A quest that says take this item and bring it to this area of the map?
---
These "quests" are ruined right out of the gate because people can fast travel around with ease and finish a quest in 5 minutes. 
---
I swear fast travel contributed to the bad press against this game and it's a mechanic that they can't take out. Bethesda shot themselves in the foot I think.
---
Never used the exploit. Glad to solo it though. Over 800 steel from scrapped weapons plus a level of XP make for an epic event every time.
---
Let the water wash away your sins and bathe in the holy glory of FC5 radio.
---
People were unbanned with beam splitter handmades and freezing fixers in their inventory, of course nobody got banned for this lol
---
"I haaaaaave a structured seeeeetttlement..."
---
No worries. Mines chipper7773. I’ll add u later when I’m home and the update is done
---
It was fun while it lasted. Oh well.
---
Additionally the perk that allows level 3 lock pick and hacking seems interesting. Not having to switch perks, but at end game the rewards from doing that just aren’t worth it. Perhaps for Nuke runs tho.
---
10 hours to me. Ps4. But I am a teacher and have a shitload of tests to mark, so, I will work non-stop until it's ready.
---
Mostly the special ones and follow through
---
My bet is that it’s a reference to Korg from *Thor: Ragnarok*.
---
You know what. You live and learn. I've sold weapons for maybe 40% of their value before. It's all good.
---
Urgh 28, you’re right. Sorry.
---
Trash. No sale on that old bundle. Welp thanks for posting anyway
---
Gauss pistol is the best pistol in the game in terms of raw damage still I believe.  Although it's hard to maximize it because the pistol perks are in the same tree as sneak.
---
At least mine didn't copy, hopefully yours won't either.
---
Demanding better from your favorite game is a bit of a silly thing isn't it?
---
**Update - 12:25 p.m. ET:**
---
Maintenance is now complete and we've brought Fallout 76 back online for all platforms.
---
Well Wastelands brought the first two, but continue to troll.
---
Scripts you spend at the purveyor for random loot and the gold is used in end game for the SS armor and Gauss weapons. Also PA and some other things.
---
The ammo one.
---
Appreciate the post as always!
---
hero!
---
On steam its 18 gb so
---
But you don't know if the camp glitches/exploits are leading to server stability problems which would affect pvp/pve and overall experience in the server for everyone
---
Lol. Sometimes this subreddit is just a tough crowd :) thanx for the upvote
---
The Moth man theme is cool and all but there’s way too much useless shit
---
They reintroduced it because the game needs money and camp builders spend the most.
---
1) ammo factory 
---
2) fallow through
---
3) take one for the team
---
4) funky duds
---
Not sure my last two yet, maybe legendary Intelligence and strength so i can move some points around to charisma.
---
Such a nice little magic shotty. AA is also nice with the new patch.
---
"Maintenance" they say.
---
Good luck. You can't pick up a turd by the clean end.
---
EDIT: aww, butthurt much? I love the game, but I'm gonna pick on it's flaws.
---
Half way downloaded so really hoping not!
---
Atom Shop floors all have an ugly, off-angle haze.  
---
Floating and Support nannies in CAMP mode are now causing more frequent camp corruptions in which no structural items can be moved or removed at all requiring placing a new camp and starting over.  
---
Placing wall decorations, especially pegboard weapon displays on the sides of foundations will sometimes cause the decoration to become unselectable, requiring the whole foundation piece to be removed, which can be a problem if that foundation was integral to the Floating or Support Rules.  
---
Brewers and Fermenters should snap together, in fact a lot of things should snap together.  
---
Suggestion: redesign chairs as animated objects, like the coin-op rides, so the player actually moves the chair to sit down but the chair legs still return to their placed position. The reason being that chairs placed realistically around tables cant also be used to sit in.  Or better yet have chairs snap to certain tables so when the player sits, their character interacts with the table.
---
No way! Sweet. Time to ass blast with my alien ass blaster;)
---
Great idea, does everyone who wants to play the game also need to live in the same country to avoid the same inconvenience 👏😂
---
But this isn't 2000 and this isn't a Nintendo 64 game. 
---
It's 2020 and this is an MMO. MMOs need content. 
---
Where do you think WoW would be now if all the devs did was make changes to how talent points work?
---
You spend Scrip at the purveyor at rusty pick, a bar at the edge of ash heap.
---
You can spend gold bullions on endgame gear, but I  won't spoiler
---
Yeah. I think if I were to run it I would just do it on a ranged character since you can wear pretty much anything. I've made peace with missing out on the extra experience, but damn people are scared of opposing opinions here. Like some random reddit comment is going to magically take away the only reason they continue to play the game. Thanks for actually talking with me.
---
&gt; a way to take enforc
---
One Man Army works well for me on bosses if you wanna go heavy
---
Because the demonstrably false claim that all new content is nothing more than "minor system changes and bug fixes" makes it seem in bad faith.
---
Is this your 2nd first time coming into the game then?  Because [you posted that you got the game a year ago and were just installing it then after not liking it at launch](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b95ero/first_time_playing/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
And script is also used to buy the modules you need to craft the Gauss weapons and the SS armor.
---
Earl's vocal sack.
---
Hell yes on all of that sweet, sweet Mothman content. Finally something I'm excited to spend on! 
---
Thanks for the lightning fast update as always!
---
Glitching camps items closer together to fit them into smaller spaces, also with prefabs, also making more scrap walls, also the camps you can marvel at that use them to make spaceships - pirate ships - esc. The point is, we need an explanation of why something as useful and harmless as this bug, is getting patched when assumingly no one reported it? That's just an assumption, maybe someone did.
---
Welp. It was good while it lasted
---
They did say that some creatures will have caps so hopefully lvl 100 or the most OP and annoying creatures in the game will be maxed at like 50 or 60
---
I'm just as excited for this update as I was with wastelanders. I kinda want to make a new character and see how the game handles now.
---
Because I won’t have to carry any purified water or food. Don’t have to worry about using through hiker, don’t have to craft disease cures, don’t have to hope for food and drink perks on armor, etc. I’m so happy to be able to auto gen a 0.1 weight item that solves all those needs once every 30 minutes at rank one. Just need to carry some stims and a couple of rad always.
---
Indefinitely.
---
It's not really a raid.  It's more of an alternate boss to the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Mind if I ask, what’s the issue with the farmable tiles to other floor change?
---
Wow level 75 liberators .. that's better !
---
Bruh I’ve been playing this game almost exclusively for almost two years now and I haven’t even cracked 850 hours. 
---
Maybe people still play the game because we didnt sink 1000 hours into it as soon as possible....
---
I really wanted one for my shotgun character but never got lucky
---
I could be wrong two. I believe I saw it in the datamined files, but lots of that is likely Atom Shop purchases, not Season Rewards.
---
Not as bad as last week
---
Same here, I love that you can max it out to 150% ammo production and then on top of having ammo production as a regular perk will be epic. I am still angry to my core that players can't sell ammo to vendors though
---
no vertibird power armor
---
why even live
---
There are much better ways to accomplish that goal.
---
I doubt it.  I’m sure the event is coded in such a way as to set parameters for each group to have one single star leader.  Otherwise, we’d sometimes get multiple stars.  The devs didn’t touch event coding or balance.  We simply got two huge blanket changes in one swoop.
---
This is a very ambitious update, and there will be problems.  For example, squishy friendlies to protect in events vs supercharged three star attackers.  None of that was considered while trying to cram p22 on the conveyor belt.
---
Free Range is MUCH harder on the PTS, because the Sheepsquatch boss went from mild mannered Bruce Banner to the Hulk.  If someone doesn’t protect the Brahmin full time with good DPS and a Friendly Fire shishkebab, a three star stingwing will kill them off very quickly with legendary poison damage.  If the Brahmin aggro the sheepsquatch, kiss them goodbye.  You can’t kill it fast enough to save all of them.
---
Similarly, Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble and Riding Shotgun got much tougher.  The increased power of the enemies greatly overmatched the slight buff to friendly HP.  If an enemy spawns as legendary, friendlies are in big trouble without the DPS we used to have.
---
We will have to accept that perfect victories will be the exception, not the rule, going forward.  Escort and protect events will be even more unpopular.  Trust me.
---
Comparatively, Daily Ops are a breeze and offer significantly more compensation.  I think they’ll supplant events, by and large, save the players doing their best Don Quixote impressions at Heart of the Swamp, hoping for the elusive leather coats.
---
As of 12:25 p.m. ET maintenance is over and the game is back up now. Thanks for your patience today during downtime!

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

Tbh this feels like it was exclusively done to fuck with the people who spend all day pvping with duped explosive lasers and millions of duped quantums. Sorry to the 4 people who pvp legitimately
---
Just 55 hours to go. Slow Internet sucks so much.
---
That wouldn't explain why FO76 is shit compared to every other game I play on it
---
Yes I'd wait until 50 to spending it unless
---
You're approaching the cap for either. 1000 scrip and I'm not sure on bullion 4 or 5k. 
---
You unlock the ammo machine (faction backpack mods are pretty nice too)
---
Those of us with slooowwww internet are tired of getting up and knowing that our platform is basically out of commission for 6-20 hours while downloading a large file. At best I get between 10 and 13 Meg's a sec download speed. On a PS4 a 10 gig download is about 3 hours, at optimum speed and in rest mode. This update is about 30 gigs and my internet is running between 3 and 6 Meg's a sec download speed. 15 hour download. Lame shit. Maybe if I'm lucky it will be finished by tomorrow. Life in middle of nowhere, WA, USA.
---
I agree with every word. I love it but can't solo it. A user here the other day did a great post on PP. Now I just need more to join.
---
So... no mannequins this update? Fucking lame.
---
ye but you can stack ammo above 30k thats why there was ammo economy
---
That and uranium fever are the best for steel and wood
---
I have a couple alts that are over 50, so I figured I'd use one of them to snag this perk while I figure what to do with my level 430 main and his massive pile of cards and perk packs.
---
Bruh 31gb on xbox. And with my super fast internet speed, thats 31 hours of downloading.
---
So then....leave? Adios? Sayanara?
---
Plenty of other fish games in the big video game ocean man...
---
That bug zapper is interesting
---
Damn thought it was gonna take longer, started making dinner!
---
See I can understand that. Player interaction is incredible important in games like these. I would almost consider it one of the main driving forces. 
---
Yes I can see how trading with players would be an interesting aspect. It's a shame Bethesda didn't focus in on this more.
---
I still have 55 hours to go. I just wanna play. It's also 33gb big.
---
Wow, thanks for the huge round-up! We'll sort through these and get them entered on our side for investigation.
---
OLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
---
Is it also warming?
---
Genuinely excited indeed, but not for the atom shop
---
Hehe, I'm sure the Op and I didn't mean to seem like we were bitching or starting to crap all over the update, just being curious and maybe wasting some time while we all wait for the servers to come back to life :)  But I'm just wondering how it will work if you have a lv100 player standing next to a lv10 player facing down an enemy and for the lv100 it's a lv75-ish enemy and for the lv10 it's a lv15-ish enemy. And the lv10 player has a weapon that can 2-shot a level 15 enemy and he fires one shot and takes down the health bar on the enemy by 50%. From the lv100 perspective, without him firing a shot, will "his" enemies health bar also drop 50%?  sry, I'm home self-isolating for 2 weeks, bored and my mind starts to wander. :)
---
Guess I have some things to buy

I don’t think you understand the definition of mutually exclusive. You can have both. NW

Wasn’t created from survival mode so it cannot turn back into survival mode. They can add back survival without getting rid of nuclear winter.
---
Was it in one of the new no build zones?
---
"bland, unimpressive, and kinda ass" is how I would describe this post.
---
It was because you had an ammo maker
---
I feel your pain, one thing you can do to improve performance is to get SSD in place of your HDD, got tired of running to locations before they could load.
---
Man I waited a whole week for this. Thanks anyways mate
---
Ok Cheats McGavin
---
Dammit Todd. I thought we had an agreement. I won’t rage quit over combat mechanics if you don’t mess with my camp glitches.
---
I'd just save up some low level gear and wait for a double xp weekend, before this update it was pretty easy to get a new character over level 50 in a couple days.
---
It does fill up a lot of rewards on the board though - I imagine they'll put this one as a reward and the armor ace ones in the store.
---
Nooo, is the mothman gas mask tied up to a bundle ?
---
I'm not saying they're bad just that they feel lazy on Bethesda's part. Yeah +5 in a stat catergory like intelligence(for xp) or strength (carry weight, melee, etc) or any other depending on your build is good but to me just seems like they saw it as an opportunity to be lazy instead of trying to make more unique legendary perks.
---
Nope. Just the slots
---
em as far as i know legendary enemies spawn rates are based on level of mob not their type
---
Nice!
---
Now that you're done, and have made many new friends

This game was a priced as a AAA when it was originally released. Mind you, that was back when they were still maintaining the lie that the only items sold would be cosmetics.
---
How do they have such terrible shop with such a huge update? Beth really needs to fire their atom shop guy. I volunteer myself for the low cost of 10k atoms per month.
---
I don't do that event because the fucking noise machine lol fuckdatnoisebrobo
---
If this get wooshed can i be green?
---
Dunno why your getting downvoted bud, thought it was pretty funny
---
Yeah, we tried to tell Bethesda that all the explosive attack perks were shit but they ignored us.
---
Having said that, there are a bunch of decent perks. You mentioned a couple of obvious ones but the poison and fire resist ones are solid and probably could get better if we see more elemental attacks in future DLC. There's also Follow through and one or two other combat related cards worth a look.
---
Also, I wouldn't shit too hard on the special perk ones. Yes, it's really lazy in terms of implementation effort but for certain builds, they could really do with the extra perk slots.
---
😂 small world. Yeah off work today and heard a rumour that everything was resetting so I did the dailys and got my gold before the update began
---
*  **Class Freak:** Fixed an issue that caused some Mutations to not interact correctly with the Class Freak Perk Card.
---
Such as?
---
Fast travel has never once been a feature people complained about; people rightfully hate the fast travel map bug, but it’s universally acknowledged that fast travel is much better than having no fast travel and having to spend 10-30 min walking your character everywhere. 
---
Honestly “fast travel is a bad mechanic and bad for the game” is the most ridiculous hot take I’ve ever seen on here lmao
---
nah
---
no.  
---
one lvl 300 char unlocks 6 perk slots for all characters on this account. perk coins have to be collected for each single character on its own.
---
I am level 50. But I am absolutely terrible at this game when it comes to optimizing my character so I get my ass kicked by a lot of mobs. I'm a casual gamer so I'm just playing to have fun. Explore, refine my CAMP etc.
---
I am sure that someone will come on and verify that merge glitches cause or don’t cause camp placement failures. We will then all know the truth. If this is true my merged kitchen sink will cause me nothing but trouble when I get home from work.
---
Saucy!
---
damn right im ready. im also ready to post about what i do like.
---
Boooooooooooooo
---
It depends why you left. Personally, I’m excited for daily ops.
---
I left my xbox on when I was off to work this morning - fingers crossed it doesn't auto-off and actually installs the update otherwise I'll be hours LOL.
---
Damage nerfs and no update to adrenaline? Awesome.
---
Teehee
---
It’s my game and I wanna play it NOW!
---
So amontoo, you exploited the game.
---
Oh, sounds cool
---
Lack of content really. I finished the two main quest lines and felt there wasn’t much else to really do
---
*tormentors intensify*
---
What are u talking about? U can get +5 points for six S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats... it cant get any better!!!
---
You lucky , my ps4 update is 77gig on my 4mb line is 50 hours
---
Fourth world conection says hello
---
Edit: 11 hours through steam
---
The server rejects sneak bonuses when other players nearby are firing heavy guns at enemies eg. SBQ so its not so bad on a public server. Also they have to adjust / balance weapons and fix a lot of broken ones in the game too.
---
Text chat mod, you can ask questions from people who play way too much.
---
Ah. I messaged like 12+ people asking how they got it and if I could buy the plans. Feel like a fool now.
---
Ammo has been duped since TSE weapons were big. People just forget or don’t care.
---
Lying liar
---
damn man, hot garbage for a major patch day lmao
---
Please don’t fix #12 treasure hunters outfit! Looks great with ss underarmor/jetpack.
---
No, upon logging in the camp containing them just won't place. It will be packed up as if someone was in your spot.
---
That was a quick AF maintenance. I love it! I still have 25 more minutes to go with downloading the update, but I’m excited to see what’s new! Thank you very much for all that you do!
---
As long as older bugs or new bugs don’t run rampant I’ll be ok. I highly doubt I’ll be ok.

I’ve instructed my 10 year old to install it. If he hasn’t I’ll be grounding his arse

nerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd
---
For sure man, hopefully there’s some quality of life improvements in store at some point. I’ve always been a singleplayer game fan, so this being the first game I got interested in any trading aspect on is probably holding my attention more than most!
---
Sounds like you may not really like this sort of game if you felt like there was nothing left to do after completing the story. Daily ops will provide repeatable content, but that may not be enough for you.
---
Man these comments hurt my head almost as much as these changes beth keeps making.
---
Like what?
---
Oh Actually I started playing upon release and then got bored of it and put it down for a year until Wastelanders came out. I know you think 1000 hours is a lot of time, but to someone like me who plays Rust, 1000 hours isn't much honestly.
---
I also "buffed" my enjoyment by avoiding fast travel whenever I could. The idea of instantly traveling to anywhere on the map in a game described as "post apocalyptic role playing" didn't fit too well. And it made content patches essentially pointless. 
---
Like what is the point of accepting a quest if you can just fast travel directly to the goal? It changes a piece of content that would be a couple hours to complete, into a few minutes...
---
Nerds didn't happen at all 🤣
---
busted
---
I'm confused. And I confuse easily.  So, I have 1 ammo machine I put at my camp. I don't use it, just decoration I guess lol is my camp fucked now?
---
forgive me, it totally does seem i’m wrong! the score one seems kind of... lame? why is it almost the same reward as the blood eagle one lol... but oh man if this camo one is atx i guess im spending atoms
---
I think this is accomplished by placing PA on a spawn point
---
No. That is not what many of us want. So again, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
---
No fast travel was complained about a lot when it first arrived in Oblivion. It as almost universally hated. 
---
Then as the cell phone generation grew up, without patience, they thought fast travel was great. 
---
Even World of Warcraft knew that instantly teleporting people around the map was a bad idea, hence why they forced you to ride around on taxis. 
---
Players think fast travel is great, because it makes the game easier. That's the problem. 
---
Like it's great if Bethesda releases a new quest to complete, but what's the point if players can fast travel directly to their goal? Usually a quest involves like... a journey?
---
I’d love one for the LMG that makes it look like the MG34 or M60.
---
I didn't even k ow it had dlc. I'll have to sign back in. Thanks!
---
I was at the shed behind App. Antiques the other day to get the ammo case and went in weapon drawn and watching for the molerat that gets me every time I go in there. Would you believe I actually saw it stick it's head out the ground to look around!!!! I've NEVER caught them doing that before. 
---
I fired just as it ducked back down and managed to kill it - it ended up exploding out of the hole. Those little buggers end up tearing me up while I try to nail them every time...it was so nice to catch one of them unawares for once.
---
lmao fun fact, this was pointed out within hours of this iteration of the PTS.
---
*Laughs in Modern Warfare*
---
Did they finally add armor showcases?
---
I can’t wait for a level 100 radroach to hate fuck my camp to death
---
Glad it was fixed before the release!
---
When was the last bunch of Fallout 1st items released?
---
Typical
---
You don't want to be a loser like them.
---
Yeah, I usually average 45-50, but this patch is coming in at 20mbps for some reason. If I unplug everything and move my system to the other end of the house and direct plug the Ethernet cable I can get up to just under 400mbps off my gig speed, but I have so many attachments on my Xbox it makes it a pain in the ass.
---
I left months ago but I haven't unsubbed to this reddit. 
---
It just amazes me to see people talking about the same events as they were doing in 2018... I had to ask "why"
---
Legendary run awarded both along the game board. Probably how you had significant quantities of either.
---
Gold bullion cant be used until the end of the wastelanders quest line. You also cant earn any through gameplay / events until you finish the quest line, i put off finishing it which seems to have been a mistake, missing out on earning gold every day, and those plans are expensive! id get moving on the questline.
---
Scrip you use at the rusty pick, in the ash heap near charleston fire station to buy legendary weapons / armor.  Scrip maxes at 1000, and items max at level 45/50, so id just save it until you get to level 50, unless you are nearing the 1000 scrip max.  You can scrap legendaries for scrip at the Rusty pick and all train stations in a machine 150 scrip max per day.
---
damage is garbage for bloodied no, base damage on my b2525 fixer is 198, with all 3 levels of commando maxed, as well as bloodied mess, gun fu, concentrated fire, etc. Im only hitting at about 333 to the body and 600 to the head of anything
---
this is BS, way more than a 50% loss of damage that they said it would be
---
"I mean, why add something that is in high demand to the new Season for free,  when we can sell it for atoms and make tons of money off it?"
---
\- Bethesda
---
So there are no more legendary fixers?
---
LOL - yeah, no little ones to do it for me so have to trust to the Xbox (I'm so screwed).
---
Good to have him well trained for it! Though won't be long before he's booking time on your xbox to play if he hasn't already LOL.
---
Cheater cheater pumpkin eater. Got what you deserve.
---
Restart system and then go to manage game, it should be there.
---
you'll get to enjoy it after work hopefully! I haven't played yet either (wifi at this part of the house sucks) but you will deserve it after working. Cheers!
---
You should head over to your ISP and have a discussion about the meaning of super fast internet, because it sounds like you're getting ripped off
---
Hold up.
---
The Power Armor Display is also for outfits? I can finally start putting these things out for people to see?! HOLY CATS!
---
There he is. 👍
---
You know why.
---
Holy dedication. Nice work.
---
Merging items is quite a common trick so how fucking long did you think this lie would last? I've no problem with my camp and it's fair to say a lot of other players will find no change with their merged camps.
---
Not ammo converters, ammo machines
---
These camps were essentially just pumping out loads of ammo that it shouldn't have been able to
---
Thank you for your kind words. Hope you get to enjoy it soon also. Have a great day or night whatever your time zone is
---
Haha. I 100% believe there are post hating on the Line In The Sand fix.
---
Game companies have their players fill out surveys all the time. It's important in online games to keep in touch with what the players enjoy about the game so that they keep coming back for more. 
---
Apparently asking "why do you enjoy the game" is too much for some people to answer.
---
Only the naming is the same. The effects are still there. But I have multiple fixers and was afraid the legendary effects were broken.
---
Yep already does but he has a PS4 pro so I get it when I want mostly. Always bloody working tho.
---
Well if you're running the HDMI through the VR box at all times, that could have something to do with it. There's some degradation when you play on your TV while the HDMI is connected to the VR box. That's why I only hook up my VR when I'm playing VR.
---
New 100 lvl rats take some Gb)
---
Hi, this is a visual issue with the dynamic naming system. Your legendary effects should still be functioning even if they're not listed in the name. We're aware of this one and working on it!
---
BGS uproots huge swaths instead of bits of code.  It’s kinda their MO
---
So mothman gets a lot of love but nothing for the Order of Mysteries? Really?
---
and with the egg shells you can buy different cake recipes witch give you different buffs

---
Yeah I been leveling both characters waiting for the perks. Some amounts of ammo is getting crafted after 😂 add us if you want will play some dailys ops. I cant wait to see the new  assaultron with miniguns.
---
It’s ridiculous.
---
Being content playing what you enjoy is a silly thing too, apparently.
---
I brought a level 12 alt there and there was already two level 200+s.  I popped a couple lunchboxes and then they knew exactly what I was doing.  So when all the Scorch spawned in they gave me a few seconds to get my hits in.  I came prepared with 20 some Molotov cocktails, threw those down and after it landed they wiped everything out. Rinse and repeat, gained 5 levels in 5 minutes.
---
I know, right? Reading the patch notes, there's no way that can be more than 31.32 GB of data.
---
My friend, you’re going to be extremely excited.
---
Check the Update 22 patch notes.
---
Lmao
---
Congratulations - you're a greedy bastard.
---
I have a bloodied autogrenade launcher to hit those levels as well, but that doesn't leave anything for anyone else at the event. I would whip it out to compete with people like you though.
---
Thanx for sharing your results :) the most interesting one imho was the med/e/15r fixer. Even though it’s not everyone’s play style, it’s a perfect roll and a nice addition to a collection
---
Did you do all the enclave/free states/BOS missions?
---
This game is more about exploring and events than just story content though.
---
Can’t handle the girth, huh?
---
I actually haven’t read the patch notes yet. So I can’t tell if this is sarcasm or not.
---
Wow totally expected mannequins this week.
---
Sooo nothing?
---
Well, I guess we don't fight a tonne of Blood Eagles, but at least if they show up in your daily op and you only had an assassin weapon left... I guess it's a particular edge case.
---
Nope.  Met a legendary lvl 100 mole rat and friends at the Flooded Train Yard.  Fun is not the F word I was using.  Burrow, bite my ass hard, repeat.
---
Errm a pre existing mannequin and a PA station would of sufficed. I guess the BoS have these units dotted about? They have no context to me atm.
---
I'm not pleased at all.
---
There is
---
Only thing I saw that interests me is the Death Ray Bug Zapper. I guess I continue to wait for the corset. Soon™.
---
Yup. I imagine that, with perhaps with an exception or two, this will be the TSE nerf issue all over again - a lot of crying up front, barely a whimper on the back end.
---
Guess I'm moving out of vault 51 now😣
---
Just did the mall ops solo in 9 mins. Camouflaged blood eagles were a pain in the ass. Tough but fun. Lots of ammo. Collect what you want before you look at the report, because once you do it teleports you out.
---
100% sarcasm
---
Stay fabulous!
---
I did not realize that. Thank you, you've just freed up a lot more room in my build.
---
I don't know. Are you?
---
Did they fix the 95% chance shot missing 100% first shots?
---
Why do they have the Shadman skull-mask?
---
nicely done!! also a side comment...for those of us IT guys in here, the silver lining is that every buggy patch is another year of job security for our brethren in ops and support!
---
I got 4tb of storage so I’m good there it’s just my internet is subpar.
---
why not?
---
I wish I could I almost skipped a class to start the update but once I got time I started it and theres 15 hours left, yay:(
---
The event was so bad with the exploit. Like, if I wanted to mindlessly grind for xp I'd just go unyielding bloodied and kill super mutants or whatever not waste time shooting some measly scorched ads once every minute for five min or whatever.
---
I always left whenever some asshat showed up with his tent. Completely ruined the event, ecstatic that it's finally gone and anyone who thinks else wise is a brainless exploiter and can eat shit lol.
---
I'm not going to rush into it.
---
Something I’ve been wondering, with the one wasteland changes.. will creatures be using all their skin variants, or is everything going to be glowing for me now? Would be cool to still spot a Yao guai ghoul every now and again.. 
---
anyone on ptr that could give me a heads up?
---
I should’ve known.
---
Wood you believe it
---
Man with 4 lunchboxes and my FFR 50 cal I could get close to two levels doing this...ahh the good ol days 🥴
---
No I didnt
---
1200 is steep
---
Mole rats are classed as full strength animal enemies.  They can spawn at lvl 100 on the eastern part of map.
---
Enjoy!
---
I am, sounds like the prydwen in a way, I think it's BOS music.
---
wait what
---
patch?
---
No I didn't. I had workbenches glitched together and I used the flamer trap to merge different items into my wall
---
I have. Most of it was 
---
"Change the broken systems!"
---
"Add a big menu of shit you can buy with real money"
---
"Add a season pass that is more suited to a BR"
---
Any new raids? (real raids) nope. 
---
Any new land to explore? nope.
---
Oh but you get to fast travel around the map to complete these new quests that barely work in about 3 minutes. That's content right? 
---
Well technically yes... that is content... I guess...
---
How?
---
I agree 1000%.  All my CAMP builds rely on the flamethrower trick so this one really hurts.
---
Its not like just anyone who walks out of the vault can go out there and pop all the buffs they did on a daily basis.  They only did it that fast with a lot of planning and testing to gather the right buffs.  We are mere mortals, in a Vault Dweller/Wastelander way of course.  This will be interesting to see what they can do with the new nerfs.
---
The PC Update was 18GB. The actual space lost after the update was about 7GB. When they update stuff they often remove stuff too.
---
Oh we can play the game properly! This patch is sounding more iconic than Wastelanders I can’t wait to load it up in FIVE HOURS 😂
---
Did you read the patch notes? There’s a pretty big infrastructure overhaul.
---
Any idea if we can still use the flamethrower trick for double-sided walls? Here's hoping all this was a mistake or bug.
---
We already knew about #1.
---
No I didn't dumb fuck
---
The downsides of being an adult, work and having to share our toys with the next generation.
---
I'm considered essential so didn't even get a brief break when everything shut down earlier in the year for covid...in some ways that's great, in some ways the break would have been nice.
---
Normal scorched not scorchbeasts? Normal scorched in Morgantown should not be level 28 lol.
---
Haha yeah I’m just messing. Our internet is slow as hell.
---
Doing that now.
---
you are welcome.
---
I mean regular scorched, not scorched beasts.
---
I’ll give you 1 cap per wood? Take as much as I can get!
---
Yes but they will have probably scaled down to other players like everything else
---
TY for your reply. I get all of your points and they're good ones, but I don't get the time issue. If you're on the game Especially in an Events PT why wouldn't you join? XP, Legendary, rare plans, loot, environment, really the works. I rejoined 76 this year so you vets been there done that but even Free Range is always empty. I don't understand how some Events get instant attention like a glitched LTS vs say PP. Sure one is easier but is that really it? I guess it's why people are renting their garments lamenting the "nerf" bc now their Free Ride is over. Life is work so we want to escape but is easy fun? Really? Idk maybe.
---
Scorched, not Scorchbeasts.
---
This. I'll actually do the event again now that I know some prick wont one shot everything before it even touches the ground. I hated that bug and am glad it's gone. It would have been fine if everyone used a weak weapon to tag but not being a giant douche is too much to ask of some people.
---
Eh, At least I get to farm all those fusion cores and XP by myself. 🤷‍♂️
---
The Brotherhood Bunker, is that Score or Atom?
---
Yep! As others have mentioned, we did add a new Daily Ops Public Team that gives you bonus XP for completing Daily Ops.
---
You can catch more details in the [patch notes](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/it9qed/fallout_76_update_22_patch_notes_september_15_2020/), but here's the gist of it:
---
&gt; Public Teams: We've renamed the "Building" team to "Casual" and removed the Casual team bonus. In its place, we’ve added a “Daily Ops” team type, which offers bonus XP for completing Daily Ops (+25% bonus XP to start, +100% bonus XP for a fully bonded team).
---
:0
---
You either have an ammo factory. 
---
...or you are in a no-build zone which isn’t your fault but has nothing to do with merges objects.
---
Will do, the throttling on the DL is killing me, my bb is 250mbps and I'm pulling 1.35mbps off the beth servers 😥
---
Thanks for the tip!  I had read the Patch Notes section relating to Daily Ops, but it wasn't there.  It is under "User Interface" changes lol
---

---
 &gt; Yep! As others have mentioned, we did add a new Daily Ops Public Team that gives you bonus XP for completing Daily Ops.
---
 &gt;
---
 &gt;You can catch more details in...
---
First find out if you can refund perk coins, this sounds like a must take for PvP with all the try hards with Tesla’s and legacies.
---
What exactly do you mean can't complete?
---
Only your blueprint for the ammo factory should be invalid. If you didn't place any down in your camp it should all be ok.
---
Still hasn't shown up. To think I deleted about 60GB to install Forza Motorsport 6. Going to have to find more space.
---
Oh know I exploited the game using ammo factories btu I am going to hide that fact so people take pity and hop on my deranged bandwagon.   
---
Hate to tell you kid but no one else with merged lost their camp.
---
This wasn't a exploit it was a fallout 1st feature.
---
As a PvPer, thank you so much for clarifying.
---
Actually I admire the idea that Bethesda had about keeping only 24 players on a map at a time. I've often wondered what a small-massive-multiplayer world would be like. 
---
But the problem is, things like fast travel, the lack of pvp, or any real group content kind of ruins it.  It's like they were going for a DayZ vibe of coming across strangers, but didn't push it far enough. 
---
Like in other games like Rust or DayZ, coming across another player is kind of a big deal. But in FO76... you'll be lucky if they even wave to you before teleporting away...
---
sbq can be crippled now forcing her to land. enforcer will be more useful then ever as it has the highest % to cripple a mob
---
With one legendary perk I get to stop wasting time shuffling Picklock and Hacker cards in and out every ten minutes. With another I get to cut the time I spend farming lead and acid and cloth and gunpowder in half--or more. Those two alone are incredibly valuable.
---
You didn’t read the Roadmap, then. 
---
They discuss Daily Ops, Expeditions, New NPCs, New Questlines, New Companions, etc. There’s even a new Event called ‘Bombs Drop’ that we have very little information about.
---
Your premise is flawed.
---
I'd imagine most people using bloodied builds are fine, it's just this sub which has a lot more butthurt in it than you find in the actual game. In the game people are mostly sound, and helpful.
---
I started a thread a while back just for people to talk about the sorts of weapon they *like* to use and share pictures of their legendaries and ended up having to remove it because it got downvoted so much and I was sick of the salty comments from people who were annoyed that someone was clogging up their subreddit with discussion of suboptimal gameplay and felt I needed to be told that I wasn't just playing the game wrong, but I was also redditting wrong.
---
As for the tweak, it does sound as though it will have a bigger impact to builds as a whole, not just bloodied, since it will reduce the buff you get from stacking buffs to the same thing. If you have several perks and legendary buffs giving you bonus damage then you'll have less after the tweak.
---
SFE, Better Inventory, Perk Loadout Manager, Save Everything
---
It’s a super easy event. What do you expect?
---
Are you on console?
---
It's all I opened this post hoping to find.
---
Are they level 45-50 legendaries?
---
Where’s that permanence in workshops bit I remember seeing when I bought a year of FO1st?
---
WHY does anyone need to justify WHY they like a game to someone? Play what you want to play, for whatever reasons you want. I don't care WHY you like WoW, or literally any game you play. You like it, that's enough of a reason to play it. I'm not looking for your validation or criticism of the games I play, so again.. piss off with that.
---
No one said the Legendary drops would be scaled.
---
I'm genuinely disgusted now, but thanks for the post!
---
I'd like to see what Bethesda's justification for this fix is. If it causes stability or performance issues, I'm all for the change. If not though and it doesn't otherwise cause harm then...
---
The black matter skin shows up correctly on the weapon, but the Jack-O-Lantern one from NW doesn't...
---
Y’all need to watch some folks on YouTube who play the PTS. :P AngryTurtle, for example, showed everyone that it cost a Perk Coin to unequip a Legendary Perk a couple, maybe a few, weeks ago.
---
While I understand your feelings on the matter, the flamer/generator budget glitch was an exploit, through and through. It wasn’t intended to work that way, and could be abused to build way beyond what we’re supposed to. It was inevitable that it would get fixed. CAMP building is hopefully going to get some major love in December, so keep looking forward to that.
---
I do not believe it does, your best bet would be to start or join an ops team to increase your chances of having people join in. If anything, I believe you have to be on a team for others to join and if you join alone you are staying alone. The fact that the location is instanced leads me to believe that. However, I greatly encourage looking into it further as my knowledge may be based too much on assumption.
---
I only use that event if there is a daily to kill legendaries.
---
Because it's in the patch notes. If you had an ammo factory, your camp is invalid. Thus, you had an ammo factory. Stop cheating, and stop lying about cheating.
---
Weird. I got it off steam was 18 gig and only took 10 mins just went on to check the atomic shop quickly and just turned it off. well hopefully picks up
---
Yeah... its not like it was infinite xp it was just nice xp. Im around 280 and I was getting around 2 full levels from the event with lunchboxes, SB Brains, and that soup from mama dolce. But its not like you could do it over and over again lol.
---
I actually think I saw a video where someone had a budget glitch working in pts. So yes I'm sure there is one this patch.
---
That's fantastic news...i only need to get myself a fixer now lol, my alt hasn't got one, might have to nick my mains lol
---
i soend massive amounts of time at my camp building and decorating, i never used this flamethrower glitch. just saying.
---
I was doing ok with a quad double barrel but it's performance against armor is going to take a big hit. I was already thinking of swapping cards and using Final Word for boss fights. RIP shotgun build... there's not a lot of incentive to swap back, apart from creeping through West-Tek with a silenced instigating pump action being really fun.
---
Always leave it to the "builders" to provide the best examples of how to be a fucking drama queen.
---
Yes, because you used the glitch. Bye camp.
---
Me too but in fallout that seems a little much.
---
two weeks ago. It is the first Tuesday of every month.
---
No!
---
Get it out of my head!!
---
Why the hell do that for decoration...? if I'm reading correctly you will have to rebuild.
---
Well they designed everything else around fast travel. 
---
If they made it so you could only fast travel to events, or maybe gave it a cool down like a hearth stone, I could see it working. 
---
I agree, not having fast travel in the game would make it tedious but in the same breath, having it available too freely I think was a mistake. 
---
Everyone knows that the engine is a pain to work with. Even when the devs try to create simple fetch quests, there are bugs. So knowing that, it just baffles me that the devs will spend all this effort on making ONE quest work, when players will complete the quest in five minutes using fast travel.
---
I'd love to grab the outfit, but the skins and camp items are getting kinda old now. There are way too many Mothman bundles, and they have yet to be expanded on ingane since Wastelanders.
---
Ammo and maybe extra charisma/strength havn't decided yet.
---
I’m down to group. I’m usually on around 6pm pst on weekdays. Psn djinnub
---
Pretty sure they did.
---
And*
---
no more ammo factories 😪
---
Yes because you are not able to spawn your base now
---
Yikes. I'm gonna complain less about my two hour download now.
---
Crazy, I do one or two ammo runs a week of the mines an grafton. Have zero ammo issues while running commando.
---
xbox
---
Does INT or LUCK factor into whether your craft a 1-3 star legendary?
---
No access to Summary Report :&lt;
---
one more time, ScOrChEd !
---
Yay!! So bored of my fixed skin
---
Your expectations, unrealistic. 
---
It's a low level area. 1 star is appropriate given that that's what we use to get.
---
nope
---
just joiking I'm not sure, but if it doesn't you can believe they will patch it. I hope they dont patch it
---
Yeah, that's what I thought. I don't remember what level things were before, but when I was doing that one repeatable mission at the airfield near Morgantown, the one where you fire a flare and then you have to defend the site while waves of scorched spawn and you wait for a cargo bot, I ended up having a really hard time with it this time, whereas before I was able to complete it fairly easily.
---
what is happening to ammo factory
---
yeah but that's caps we get to save now
---
I’m curious to know if that’s an intended effect of it. If it is, my heavy will be maxing it, but until I see some confirmation I’m not spending perk coins on it.
---
It made almost two years of farming, trading and grinding feel so worthwhile.
---
More Mothman crap, no doubt to be followed next week by more Communist crap.
---
IT'S TIRED GUYS, GET A NEW SCHTICK ALREADY
---
What a shit update
---
That's what I thought. Seems like they messed something up with the lvl scaling.
---
I can't wait to see her land on top of the bunker now. I already have a screenshot of a normal one standing on top of it.
---
Y'all be careful when spam dropping grenades now!! Don't go dropping your fixers into the void
---
This perk is an absolute must for power armor builds now we know it’s intended. I wasn’t sure whether to get it in case it was patched, I’ll definitely pick it up now, thanks a lot for clarifying.
---
It's the fucking technical definition... an exploit is literally a bug used in a manner unintended by the programmer to the users advantage.
---
that'd ruin their revenue model. not happening unless it's fan-made.
---
They'll be on the atom store later most likely. Along with the mannequins.
---
 It worked this way on test.  Adding str over 15 still gave me extra carry weight and melee damage, but I could not assign anymore perk cards.
---
what an eggcelent question
---
I know this is prime meme material but he hasn’t said anything like that to me for at least two weeks. He says “we haven’t needed that bone saw yet but we’ll be glad when we need it” or “we’ll install that circuit board right away.”
---
I do his daily on two different characters and his dialog seems fine to me lately.
---
But people love to hate Ward.
---
It's almost always a busy event when I play. Usually we get the venison collector full, and toxic sludge to 2/3 full. It's hilariously hard to keep a bloatfly or radroach alive for the kelp spawn though.
---
They'll be an Atom Shop item later on.
---
They straight up deleted all of the evidence that shows they had that listed as a perk.
---
This entire game is a glitch though.
---
nope we were both standing in the area, fending em off at the two doors
---
big oof
---
I've got the day off! .... aaand the download will be done at exactly the time I need to go to sleep for work tomorrow. So I can use up *all* of my bandwidth, *all* day, and *might* get to launch the game before I have to stop.
---
I feel less special knowing that you named your deathcaw the same thing.
---
Thanks for the response!  I must admit I'm surprised.  Both by getting a response so quickly but also by the fact this feature was intended.  I was nearly certain it was a bug..
---
This changes my plans alot.
---
They are not.
---
Thanks a bunch! same to you
---
Because much like Bethesda it's better at making shit than a genuine product.
---
You get used to it.
---
i think he means they will still suck but will be a higher level
---
is t60 better than ultracite for boss fights?
---
I once saw an entire group armed with bows with the flame mod doing the tent glitch,it was a magnificent sight, flaming scorched everywhere!!!!,and now people will just camp the cliffs killing the scorched as they spawn behind the wall.
---
I don't seem to have any issues with CAMP building.
---
Get ready for the incoming massive wave of PMs 🤣🤣🤣
---
Same boat as you, it's 29.635 on ps4 and it's telling me 8 hours. So there's a decent chance I'm not even playing it today
---
Bro yes that’s 60 caps right there, if you count out and back
---
Stars arent scaling its a level 50 item instead of level 10. Still pretty useless though.
---
Both the Scabber and Waster Raider Power Armor skins from the Atomic Shop take up so much of the screen in firsts person mode that they ate actually difficult to use. 
---
If you use either Raider skin with Heavy Weapons, and first person, you can only see around 1/3 of what’s in front of you.
---
Yeah they're just as dumb as people who used the doublesided walls glitch. All glitchers should be banned so you can play alone in your sandbox.
---
I don't like WoW. 
---
But deny it all you want, Blizzard knows wtf it's doing when it comes to online games, and they set a lot of standards BECAUSE THE IDEAS WORK WELL in an online environment.
---
That's basically the Raider Collectron.  He has "tattoos" and chains and shit just like Rose.  He even talks about how there's a real...*spark*...between them. (GET IT!?   HAHA ROBOT HUMOR)
---
It's been a pack? also it had nothing to do with preordering, it was the deluxe edition of the game. Now the deluxe edition of the game includes the raider and settler pack. The tricentennial pack has been purchasable separately for quite some time.
---
Also, the preorder bonus for 76 was the Fallout Classic Collection (Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics)
---
Having it blueprinted won't delete your camp as long as you never actually placed it in your camp. Guy I play with BP'd it and only placed at workshops. His camp is fine.
---
Yeah, that's never happening. 
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'd love for this to be a possibility but Bethesda is never going to introduce something that'll take money out of their pockets. 
---
I'm not even talking Fallout 1st. I'm talking future paid mods. Once you get the server code, people will hack at it to add mods to it. 
---
Worse still, it could be rife with exploits and hacking that'll be brought back into the main game. You'd have to have it so that characters in these private servers could only ever exist in these private servers. At least that way all your cheating only affects you.
---
Wait.  You’re running a lumber yard? So you took over a workshop for real? ;)
---
Because they can make money off of it?
---
Immediately saved to camera roll. Thank you so much!
---
JOOR-ZAH-FRUL!!!!
---
Who reported the glitch I shall do nothing about them immediately.
---
cool thanks
---
I cant wait to have to pull up my map 6 different times to fast travel to the new free locations,  as i didnt see anything about the damn fast travel bug being fixed. 🤦‍♂️
---
I'm jealous you have a job i hurted my knee got surgery total ligament reconstruction and a ligament transplant been out for 1 year 9 months and can't wait to get back to work
---
its bad, at least from the first 30 mins of playing, my level action was hitting at 1200 in vats, i got 300 for the same hit today
---
I think theyre still trying to make up for the original release. That's why they haven't charged for any updates or dlc lmao.
---
Have fun playing.
---
1) Valseek said it's intended but not yet on the card description (that's for the other commenters)
---
2) It technically works against the Sheep but the healing isn't fast enough to keep up with her much higher damage output.
---
Did somebody say scorched?
---
I'm of the opinion that some magic weapons, minigun for one. Feel thematically better with magic effects. RIP instagating explosive mini.
---
I hope for this in general as time goes on. It's inevitable but so long as Bethesda makes money they'll be no official support for a server outside of their ecosystem. I would imagine if they did allow or support it it wouldn't be connected to the current character you have. I would imagine a truly private server would be it's own ecosystem with a separate leveling and the likes. Better that way tbh.
---
Nice!can I pm you later...?kinda want to shoot you a offer.have a few rare things that you might consider for one or 2 of these jewels.
---
I can't kill anything. They get down to just a sliver of health and then dont die. The fuck?
---
You are very welcome!

---
I'm actually surprised that it didn't happen sooner.
---
C'mon dude, you should know what Bethesda is like by now. Short term revenue is all they care about.
---
It’s 100% intended. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itcdkn/comment/g5dht2s?context=10000
---
Its like it was on the PTS. My handmade which isn't bloodied did 192 damage before the patch and now it shows 154.
---
Effectively im not expending a noticeable amount more in ammo.
---
oh I'd forgotten about the mannequins
---
A perfect post. I pray someone important reads it. I use Enemy specific weapons bc I like to but it really is pointless.
---
Well when you said "an" instead of "and" every single time, i feel you need propper education.
---
I'm so sad! That was REALLY fun. I hope they add a new event that bottlenecks the enemies so you can shoot them like fish in a barrel. What a blast that was!
---
Too bad I asked Bethesda to do this and they said OK.
---
You are welcome!
---
AngryTurtle on YouTube has a in depth guide you could check out
---
Thank you! Updooted!
---
It does the same thing to me, but once you step out of the armor it all completes correctly.
---
my aa 50 cal still rips em apart, but the rubber banding on health is still there
---
And?
---
Damn that paddle ball string is OP
---
Was hoping to hear about FPS and performance updates. I literally run the game at all the lowest setting and still can't manage consistent FPS. I have a mid tier PC that should be able to handle the game :(
---
yeah, it is a colossal problem.
---
*I will see myself out*
---
thanks for the info!
---
It’s been a pack forever..
---
At least you had a partner. Did it solo, don't recommend it. I probably won't do it again lol
---
I might be wrong here but still I am very certain you could buy that bundle at any time you wanted on ps store and the equivalent to xbox and pc Im guessing
---
I agree it takes away the preorder benefit, but at the same time I find it personally to be a pretty whatever bundle, maybe they didnt make enough sales or something idk 
---
All in all I think its stupid to re-release it since it was preorder, but at the same time whatever
---
Scaling is in the background I believe, that's how ESO does it. Try fighting one and find out, but it should feel the same to fight a level 1 scorched and a level 28 scorched now. Kinda sucks away the feeling of progression, but opens the game up for earlier levels / newer players.
---
Why not just share the spreadsheet rather than sharing an image of the spreadsheet?
---
Angryturtle on yt did 4 vids going into some detail, and actually using each perk card. Worth a watch
---
I thought it was just me and my B had been downgraded!
---
You're attacking me for someone else's answer...
---
Maybe if you thought about the question, rather then just attacking me...?
---
This excuse of "I like the game just because" isn't why I asked the question and you know it to be true. You yourself don't understand why YOU like the game and you obviously can't give me a good answer other than "I just like it".
---
okay well... that's fine. But what that tells me is that you're satisfying an addiction, rather than enjoying the game.
---
If you said something along the lines of, 
---
"I enjoy the trade"
---
or
---
"I enjoy the PVP"
---
like other people in this thread have answered, that would be fine. But you're not giving those kinds of answers aren't you? You're just attacking me because you're insecure about the game you play.
---
I’ve noticed that they have a very low tolerance for people who exploit unintended “features”, so I really hope nobody’s surprised by this
---
You need to do the research yourself instead of making assumptions. 
---
The Burrows takes place in ‘the same game world’ but it was definitely new content.
---
oh what a shame
---
I’ve seen several folks say folks with the ammo factories cause their frame rate to drop. (Private Facebook group so I can’t link and screenshotting would be rude.)
---
me too, not sure what im going to do, this sucks
---
And right after they had that admittedly good Mothman camp bundle for 600 atoms for 24 hours recently even. I love cryptids but I'm beyond sick of mothman and the idiotic cultists. Give us some snallygaster stuff if they really need to keep doing cryptid themed items.
---
i didnt even know this bug was a thing until i saw this post. now to be honest i havent really done the event in like 70 levels but still
---
What's the text chat mod?
---
An update that everyone is happy with.
---
I don't know who thought me dying to a "Weak Feral Ghoul" the first time I did anything on this patch was a good idea but they were wrong. Everything now takes 3 times the bullets, 3 times the stims and 18 times the frustration, all for seemingly the same rewards. I don't get it.
---
He's got his eye on you.
---
No offense.
---
Huh? You could hit 9k or more from tagging (not killing) with a low lvl explosive weapon during double xp. Nothing about what they said indicated that they would kill the lot like a greedy bastard lol
---
Cool! Appreciate it
---
I spent weeks getting to where I was now I’m where I was before the mutations and, armor, and perks
---
The game was too easy before. Now it will be more challenging.
---
Stop whinging and shoot more
---
Todd’s Ferrari needs a new tyre
---
Might be the ones you need to melee to finish off
---
I'm home on furlough being able to enjoy the update. To the contrary, enjoy your paycheck stability! Means you have the means to enjoy the game a bit more. I'm jealous of you 😂. And just pretend you're at the lumber yard in 76 killing hulk ticks lol.
---
Right there with ya bud. Apprentice electrician on the job site, currently on lunch. Don't want to risk getting cussed out for being on my phone any other time.
---
Oh shit! Weeks?!?
---
About 32gb on XB1... currently at 62% and certainly not moving too quickly.
---
Ah same as me really, just got the ore glow i stead of better inventory
---
why? they were the best perks
---
Ok but OP and likewise I weren't talking about ammo factories.
---
Wowie
---
I am annoyed that they keep using the R-91 in promotional material but don't have it in the game. I hope with Broken steal, they will bring in more weapons to the game and ones that are not locked behind endgame grind like the guass weapons
---
It would work but in its own ecosystem. I *really* want what you described but I want it as a sort of alternative to the Bethesda official world. I'd like to be able to use this game as a large sandbox stuffing it with fun tools and mods and just go crazy. I'd like to make a truly survival server. Make it super tough to navigate the world.
---
You missed it bud. During the cool down for season 2 you could claim all unclaimed items. I missed the 100 by 4 and I was sad. :(
---
Well, all I see are level 28, and they are definitely harder than before the update. I'm not sure what level scorched I was getting before, because I haven't played for a while. I tried the Morgantown Airport repeatable mission and the scorched waves were WAY harder than before. I beat it once before and it was fairly easy, this time I died twice and gave up.
---
Oh no. Not sure I can live without Perk Loadout Manager.
---
Nope it's an reported glitch eventually it'll throw out an high range wep or super fast swing melee
---
The hero we needed
---
I never build turrets anyways
---
So glad I got fiber internet last month. 1000mbps down.
---
So is Daily Ops the only BoS related thing in this update?
---
Its still early
---
So what that means is that you're see a location you've seen before, and there are some re-used enemies.
---
You're not actually GOING to a newly created area by the developers. You're going to a pre-existing place in the world and fighting some modified NPCs.
---
Right? 
---
Here's "new content" in my mind... 
---
"Players will get to explore "The Pit" from classic Fallout 3 with new NPCs, quests and items to collect. Explore the ruins of Pittsburg and make your way through the new story"
---
 I never considered the Powerpoint analogy- excellent comparison!
---
I'd go throw myself off the monorail elevator since there's no vertibird PA but my T-65 would save me anyway so what's the point
---
No vertibird, clandestine T65, X02
---
How long should I wait
---
Won't take long for it to be updated.
---
seems obvious you should have claimed them
---
Hot damn they fixed the tesla rifle! No more obnoxious lag.
---
Oooo
---
I wish I hadn't played it if that helps. I was just learning the game and now I get killed by Weak Feral Ghouls.
---
Anyone else fixers were renamed The Fixer?
---
Oh give it time, they're coming.
---
People on this sub read like 2 words of every post then just start typing whatever they feel like.
---
Nahh rookie numbers I'll do it for 10k Caps
---
not enough asses
---
I can't wait to get online and try it out!
---
indeed
---
Oh, and another one: people talking about how they accidentally scrapped some Perk card or another that they really needed and there should be a system to buy them back or there should've been more notices in the way to prevent them from doing it.  
---
That'll happen.
---
People have heard enough "fallout 76 bad" over the past 2 years, so your post sounds like another loaded question to just say the same thing again. 
---
But maybe really all your point was was that fast travel is bad, therefore fallout 76 is too.
---
I think all the legacies are still very good, I mean you can do the equation in your head now with base damage
---
give it time
---
The Barrows was an **all new area**. It simply existed in the same geography. It was its own instanced area. 
---
You clearly are out of date on the content, because The Burrows has been around for a while now.
---
On pc it was always crowded. We even notifying people in chat mod so they join the same server for event. Well, it was...
---
Lmao dude its 7am. An honestly who gives a fuck? You sound like you need a proper education on how not to be a fucking loser.
---
Please dont kill me though bro. You legit look like a school shooter. Love you!
---
That was a mistake on your part.
---
Guys what happoned to camp bulding? I am confused pleas expaln
---
Yup. BOS style
---
This is heavies, not rifles I’m talking about.
---
I thought you said are not at first.  My bad.
---
No. From what I saw they had a mixed reception but Bethesda somehow thought it was smart to remove these perks but keep the universally unpopular explosive attack family of perks.
---
Oh maybe not. I ran into some eyebots and they still only take like 4-5 stabs to kill.
---
Get out of here with your logic.
---
They said scaled legendaries. That obviously means I should get 4 and 5 star drops now, because I'm too high level for crappy 1 star scrip garbage from an event that has only dropped one star gear for nearly 2 years.
---
Oh damn, there goes me excitement :(
---
I think it’s supposed to be done as fast as possible and that’s the challenge
---
Was almost worried people wouldn't:)
---
31 gigs? That’s almost as big as Wastelanders!
---
Strange because the scorched seem harder
---
Camps in the vicinity of Vault 51
---
Fuck, really? Thanks.
---
Edit: Wow, I finished it but I need to find friends. That was intense.
---
You're really angry over a simple question that others have alrady given satisfactory answers to. I'm just going to block you since you don't seem intent on actually answering me, and just want to attack me instead. Good luck!
---
I swear they do it to have something to bitch about.
---
Just finished it with one other guy, I joined late. Invisible raiders inside the mall, very fun. Took about 15 minutes but I had no idea what I was going into. Interesting reward system, gotta see how well I can do and what I get next time to really judge it
---
I've probably wasted around 20,000 since wastelanders came out, but this is just an estimate of three characters doing all the quests and probably around a hundred dailies each. So honestly probably more like 50,000
---
Same bro, I'm a truck driver on a 17 hour shift. No chance for me to play.
---
BOS Paladin here! Im very glad to see a nice perk for the PA users!
---
Finished heist like couple weeks ago on a mule account, had no problems picking gold (siding with raiders)
---
For PC versions of the game, you can install mods.
---
Tech Chat, is a mod that adds a limited text chat system for PC, something that doesn't exist for the PC side, but exists on the consoles as part of the console environment (ie: PSN | XBox Live).
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151/](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151/)
---
The other point is there's no point in developing a product you're not selling. Bethesda and any business really is only inventivized to make or invest in something if there's a clear business case for return. 
---
Your idea from an objective sense serves as a way for people to branch off the "vanilla" game, where all the micro transactions and main playerbase are. Doesnt seem to benefit Beth one bit.
---
How were the rewards for doing it?
---
Quick note, the way I understand it, the slow on her rotation if you cripple her legs is *very* slight, but it is there. But I know it's more important that you can force her to land now. Really glad we were able to get this into the patch!
---
&gt; Fixed an issue with the Tesla Rifle that could result in poor framerates for nearby players. 
---
THANK YOU!!! Earle is playable again! 👏

 &gt; If the enemy has the Resilient Mutation they can only be killed with a melee attack.
---
JUST EAT THE POO POO
---
Is it an actual area that you can explore? Or is it just "dungeon size"
---
Because the area where you fight thew new raid boss could be considered "an all new area" even though it's only as big as a gym.
---
Hmmm thought I remember animated/gold perk cards giving 5 coins per level on PTS. Wonder if they standardized it for simplicity.
---
You're not wrong. The salty spoiled brats are all out on patch day.
---
You encapsulated the sense of entitlement exquisitely. Nice work :)
---
Country roads....
---
Ah right, i thought so. I quite enjoyed it actually. Just need a team to enter with
---
If it happens at volume it will be tomorrow.
---
Servers are up man, I've already almost all the challenges easily
---
Holy crap, thank you! I am now even more excited for today’s patch!
---
sorry misread that
---
* **Bonus Damage:** We’ve changed the way that damage bonuses are calculated so that they now apply additively instead of multiplicatively.
---
* Please Note: While stacking damage bonuses will now have a smaller overall effect on your damage output than before, these changes will make the resulting damage much more predictable and allow for future improvements. This is very important for the health of the game going forward. It will also create better opportunities for us to make smarter and more effective balance changes.  
---
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ You stupid shits forgot to take firerate into account so basically you gave ranged builds a buff while nerfing melee by taking the one thing we had worth going melee, IE Higher dmg output each swing because, Ranged  can shot like five times or more for each ranged swing even with a +40% swing speed..... Math's hard huh ?
---
I'm not insecure about anything. I just don't feel the need to justify anything to you about any game that I play. I play a game because I want to. I don't seek validation for the game I choose to play / movies I choose to watch / things I choose to do because I don't care. 
---
You can stop trying to play 1st year Psych student and try to infer there is confusion on my part or some underlying addiction as to why I play. It's not there. You aren't getting a more satisfying answer from me beyond "I just like it".
---
Anyway to disable it for pvp?
---
Piercing gaze removes stealth and all stealth related bonuses. Every current daily OP has piercing gaze.
---
Probably cause the servers were down when the dailies reset.
---
My understanding is, being online (main menu) and/or in game when the dailies reset is what triggers the bug. not being online during the reset means it never happens to you.
---
I personally wouldn't spend scrip until your lvl 50, for higher level legendarys. I would finish the main story line first which you have to do to unlock gold, and I would buy the SS jetpack mod plan and the chest piece plan for once your lvl 50. Also dont buy the gauss pistol if your not a pistol build(I bought it once I finished the story and I was disappointed) or just buy legendary modules, so you can build legendarys with scrip.
---
my legacy flamer is performing as expected. about the same, even on high level trash mobs. but sentry bots and deathclaws, pretty much anything big, is noticeably tankier and taking about 3 to 4 times as many shots to kill.
---
Poop.
---
Enemies in the “Uplink” Daily Ops mission always spawn with the Piercing Gaze mutation, which greatly improves their Perception. So, yes, sneaking is harder to pull off.
---
Edited for clarity that Piercing Gaze always spawns on enemies in “Uplink.” The notes don’t say it spawns in every Op.
---
Yes and it was glorious when trying to farm XP.
---
I don't know what you guys are on about, I love the converter. Use it all the time. It's great to help keep my stock of used ammo up.
---
Ummm.. I suppose they could be worse but i only unlocked initiate rank the rewards werent amazing
---
Thank you, Keiji! This is a fun fact indeed. Only if I kept the Quad xbow ....
---
I never said Fallout 76 was bad. 
---
If it was bad I wouldn't have sunk over 1000 hours into it. 
---
My question was, why do people keep playing this game despite the lack of any real content?
---
People get very aggro when they are asked this question. They'll even attack fellow fans of the game.
---
Never attacked you, but you do you, bro.
---
Oof. Yeah preupdate things often default at like lv 6 in Morgantown. Not 28 for sure!
---
Thank God you aren't a dev.
---
There's a hurricane passing thru town atm. - gulf coast FL resident
---
It doesn't seem so bad so I hope I can update the game.
---
That seems impossible.  Bethesda would never mess something up in an update.  If it's true that large QC department they have for fallout76 is going to be in a lot of trouble!
---
Serious question though, could they feel as difficult as level 12 Scorched instead of the lower level ones they were before?
---
Hi, as others have mentioned this isn't a new addition and has been available for quite a while. It's leaving next week, so we're highlighting it in case anyone wants to pick it up at the last minute before it's gone.
---
Or course, more handmade, shotgun and melee skins when there’s still tons of weapons without even a single skin
---
I don't know. Make it an option?
---
You gotta melee to finish it off
---
Really anything would be nice.
---
They may not be super powerful but they can be super fun!
---
*facepalm*
---
Yeah, ive just read that bit mate cheers
---
Given archer is the neglected child of every weapon type I would imagine. I do not mean this in a mocking way, I tried it out myself to a lack luster realization.
---
Awww line in the sand spawn glitch was patched (it was funny as hell to see the scorched just rain into one spot)
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Bro people can't even figure out how to barley open an close doors in this game. You think they can read a line of text with instructions!?!?
---
and why is it at the top of the resource list for God's sake
---
There goes another minor cap sink. I would've taken like a 50% discount.
---
is there this mutation that you cant kill them with ranged weapons? try to bash them.
---
If you haven't tried it already, Melee it.
---
Resilient means it is only killable with a melee attack.
---
My deathclaw is named Clarence.

Read the ops info before posting a bug report ffs.

---
Ahh, yeah, well that's definitely its own animal.  I was primarily talking about ballistic pistols.  Most of the other energy pistols (i.e., laser) have their own, even worse, issues.
---
Did they buff the fatman? Mine jumped up an extra 1000 damage after the update
---
Explosive lasers do ballistic damage, so I don't think this will affect them.  Could be wrong tho, haven't tested.
---
It could be a big f-u to telsa rifle users, and I am fine with that actually. That weapon is stupid but I am concerned about unintended consequences.  The healing is so high that a well co-ordinated group could get a "healer" outside the team using a tesla or similar to keep the core team healed up.
---
Definately a game-changer, huge consequences to both pve and pvp strategy.
---
Nope.
---
Same man. Out here farming, and its gonna take at least 2 days to download it anyways 😥
---
I would be one of those thousands, and yes I would have just stopped playing. Yes it’s easy to get ammo, yes it’s not hard to farm or even craft it, but I only play about an hour a day. I was getting enough ammo from 5 machines to play for that hour. It was nice tbh.
---
If stingwings are as horrible as I fear they could be then I am going to take a break from the game, I think.
---
More Mothman shit?
---
You can do it tho. Keep going!
---
M14 would have been better.
---
Some people are slow. What are you going to do.
---
Edit: It's started.

---
Fallout 1st tent when placed just nearby the event would cause enemies to spawn closer to the tent, allowing for easy kills.
---
Its 1:30pm for me, also 7am isnt early.
---
I wish Bethesda would have given us more player interaction options.
---
They should allow players to set their camp as "hostile" or "welcoming" that way it could encourage some shenanigans and PVP.
---
Like as a Rust player, when I first heard that FO76 players were creating trap bases, I loved it. I wished there was more of a system built in to be aggressive to other players, but the fact that they tried and partially succeeded in making functioning trap bases amuses me endlessly. 
---
But right now there just isn't much you can do with other players other than like... show off your gear or wave to them.
---
you to to run up and bash them with your weapon to finish them off
---
Meh, it's just like any other computer interface. I don't have many issues with it. I save up ammo, convert large quantities, exchange about 10k points at once, and move on. Maybe once a week or so.
---
The daily ops team I’m pretty sure
---
Look around for a note
---
Fantastic, thank you!
---
Surprise suprise, my pre patch build still absolutely shreds everything, never woulda guessed.
---
Read the fucking ops info.
---
Yaaaaas. Decent patch!
---
Drop them to 1hp than Gun bash them.
---
Resilient requires melee attack to kill. In the patch notes.
---
Why are some glitches ok and not others? If I was a dev, none of these glitches would have shipped.
---
Stop using bad gear
---
I knew people would post about this one haha
---
Look up the effects the enemies spawn with. 
---
Resilient is one of them.
---
You gotta bash em
---
Can confirm. I had a small chunk of budget left last night. Not only is it gone now, but if I remove any camp items, I can't put them back down because it's saying budget is exceeded. /u/valseek
---
The armor ace PA display is there but its not part of the season 2. It's in the atomic shop.
---
Do you have to be on a team for OW to scale correctly?
---
Oh yeah ive just found that! Thanks man
---
No cap lol
---
secet service with the black skin(unreleased)
---
You're the weak link here.
---
Haha yes seems that enemy might be in need of a name change now :D
---
I understand the point, but I would simply rather not.
---
It is not the game's fault that you can't read.
---
I asked Bethesda to nerf you and they said, ON IT! We’ll also pretend we like them! Tee hee!
---
Oh, snap! So we can actually talk to other people in the world? Or is it server-wide?
---
No one should have said anything. Lol
---
Read the ops info.
---
BOSS music? Ruh roe.
---
Easier to post a complaint!
---
No, you're pretty correct. It was better before wastelanders and now it's awful. When I used vending machines I have to click shop and then twist because the text will be unreadable if it's over the vendor terminal screen or any light really.  Had to turn HDR off because of that. And the blinding bright light when you go into chameleon
---
Its comedy lol
---
When is the removal of thirst and hunger bars coming?
---
I also played kapkhan for multiple seasons and I have found that it is quite is to switch over to valkyrie, her gun has slightly higher recoil but its a beast. Also she has more uses and overall is better in ranked as everyone checks doors. Hopes this helps.
---
Ok what the heck is a wanamingo
---
well, thats it with selling .50 at 1c/each.... :D  
---
thanks man, awesome work!

---
which of these things do you like or dislike, and why,  Mr. 1st Year Psych Student?
---
It was never going to be added today. It's coming in a few months, as expected.
---
Dont call us needs bro
---
I dont know , i dont have that one
---
so, did they fix the menu for dropping/scrapping items with skins?
---
if we attempt to drop a favourited item the prompt that pops up is by default selected ‘NO’ as ‘I dont want to drop it’, so if you panic press the button you wont lose your item.
---
but if we try to drop an item with a skin the pop up is set to yes. as ‘yes I want to permanently destroy that item’, so if you panic press you’ll lose your item. 
---
did they fix it?
---
Yup. The enemies force you into [Danger] within a radius
---
Out of everything they could have done, why more communist gear? I don’t think that’s something anyone particularly cares for, and I don’t understand why they keep adding it to the game.
---
But I suppose it’s free, so I can’t complain that much.
---
Took me 22, mostly because I'm a dolt and I'm bad at video games.
---
Had a feeling sorting by new would be good for a laugh today.
---
Today is going to be fun day I see...
---
Only yooooooou.
---
Hmmm i detect sarcasm in that last paragraph but my crippling retardation makes me want to put my phone number down
---
For people like me too stupid to read patch notes:
---
* **Enemy Mutations:**
---
* **Piercing Gaze:** This mutation is always applied to enemies the “Uplink” Daily Ops mode, and gives them greatly enhanced perception of players.
---
* **Volatile:** Enemies will explode on death
---
* **Active Camouflage:** Enemies will be cloaked when not attacking
---
* **Resilient:** Enemies can only be killed by a melee attack
---
* **Freezing Touch:** Enemy attacks will freeze players
---
Just saw that
---
I took a long lunch to come home, fix some things at work, and to launch the update so it actually is ready when I truly do come home. ... that said 30gb download on PS4???? Holy shit. It may only just be updating by the time I get home.
---
Gotta hit him if he’s resilient.
---
On console it lags with such a big area and things spawning. I like to do it, but it can be very annoying and some of the people I play with don't like to do it, so we'll skip it.
---
Look into the patch notess and info given aboutbthe daily ops in the bethesda site.  The enemies in the ops will have a randomized mutation to makenthem more difficult.   The screenshot you posted show an enemy that has the resilient mutation, meaning thatbthey can only be killed using melee.  That said, you can still knock thier healthbar down to near zero, but requires a melee strike for the killshot.   Looks like all the hatred for increased bash8ng dmg on the legendaries might subside a bit
---
If people would take the time to read about the game, it would erase 99% of the complaints people have.
---
Hmm, there was a budget exploit we fixed related to generators. Is it possible you were replacing generators a lot prior to this patch? If so, any excess budget you could have gained that way would be removed with the exploit fix. 
---
If not, I will circle back with the team and check in on what may have caused this for you
---
I'm looking forward to finally using my AA SS shishkabob for more than beating on cows and friendly scavengers!
---
Oh wind your neck in ffs, it was one event and the reason loads of people would always turn up is because it was fun, so maybe stop whining and try enjoying the game for a change.
---
Don't know what your talking about. Maybe your using the wrong ammo. The bullet's in my Axe kills them dead.
---
What kind of rates?  7.5% APR? 10%!?!? Outrageous!
---
This is why reading is important
---
Don't jinx it.
---
I think that was just around not long ago. Might be awhile.
---
there is the armco ammo appliance or whatever which is a small machine that produces ammo for your camp. 
---
it’s a item you can buy from the raiders once you reach ally status with them.
---
people were glitching the ammo factory extractor. that one in the converted munitions factory workshop and building copies of it at tbeir camps.
---
3 hours for me
---
Do we even need that? Since when was penalties for not eating and drinking a problem?
---
That should have read how do I uninstall perk load manager?
---
no mention of the .44 missing the bull barrel?
---
Good to hear. Remember when people said the last legendary run was impossible to complete even if you signed in every day and completed every challenge? 😂
---
Hey, I'm dealing with a bunch of metal for work today so maybe we could trade scrap? Lol
---
yeah i think its something on your end. mine was 3 hours.
---
So it begins...
---
Holy shit, 900 ultracite .50 cal and 5mm rounds per craft? Guess I’ll be taking this perk first
---
Are you sneaking? If no, I would definitely suggest that, it’s a game changer.
---
Mutations showing your full negative side effects even though Class Freak is removing 25-75% of them. It was just a visual bug.
---
Lol, same here!  I was wondering why they seemed so crappy.
---
Is Camo Blood Eagles the same for everyone? Making them invisible while they also have perfect perception made for a really good challenge, even though it meant that sneak was impossible.
---
Yes, that's the point of the whole damage reduction thing.
---
What, did you think a damage reduction was going to increase your damage output?
---
They shrunk the budget 😐, I didn't use any camp budget exploits yet I had to remove multiple objects to place a single piece of floor decor. 😤
---
Not finding one in his little camp area
---
They already have extremely rare and valuable cosmetics that drop from events
---
yup. gonna miss that
---
For daily ops, do you need to make the group then click on the location or can you enter one and wait for others to join you before it starts a timer?
---
My update was 2-3 hours and I am playing the game now.
---
If you are paying, then it’s your fault.
---
Using the flamethrower to destroy CAMP object used to let you place other objects on top of the broken ones, so when you repaired it they fused together and looked nice.
---
Isnt it still one of the most damaging builds though?
---
How does it show up? Or does it not appear as an option at all?
---
So are one handed weapons better than unarmed?
---
That one was BS
---
Ok, nevermind then
---
Still able to exploit it, just not with a tent.
---
I'd rather drag my nuts through broken glass than get my info off youtube, where a 15 minute video is 13 minutes of pointless jabbering and 2 minutes of worthwhile content.
---
mine looks like about an hour
---
I’ve been doing elaborate and creative housing in ESO since launch.
---
The building in F76 is agonizingly bad.
---
Don’t worry.  Ur duped legacy weapons are even more OP then before.
---
OK let me know when you find it
---
Don't forget to use the Woodchuckers perk, lol.
---
They did the math 😂
---
Already came across one major issue. Logged on my level 290 character and received my 50 perk coins and they instantly got wiped.
---
here we go
---
Mine is about 25 minutes total download.
---
Finally i can mod my camo underarmor and my friends can finish ounce of prevention
---
To be fair to OP if you go on fallout.com in the roadmap on the homepage it does say “steel dawn all new quest line” on the Fall One Wasteland update.
---
Blame Captainnoob and Tyr for dropping Earle in 1 hit. Melee needed the nerf more than anything imo.
---
So you went from a one shot to a three shot. Gosh I don’t know how you can go on.
---
This should have no effect on those possums spawning.
---
Oh no, it's a challenge now.
---
Still max and min levels for areas.
---
6 hours. Left PS4 on so i can play after work hopefully.
---
I have the plan. All weekend long during the sale...not a single Fixer :(
---
In fact, out of like 16 rolls, I didn't get a single good 3*
---
&gt; should have read how do I uninstall perk lo
---
Don't have to uninstall.  Just removed the perk load manager from your custom ini file and it won't load the mod.
---
Really? cause I cant one hit kill a mirelurk with a b/ss/1s powerfist while in nerd rage and 3.5x sneak attack.
---
You don't have to melee only, you can use a gun and put an enemy to 1hp and then gun bash them to finish them off.
---
It's not something you get, dude. It's a region on the map where Vault 51 will be in the future. You can't place CAMPs there anymore.
---
The interface isn't user friendly.
---
A thing you missed, bug since day one:
---
When a feral ghoul's limb gets blown off, no epxlosion sound plays and no blood gushes out of the stumps. They just switch to "exploded" in the most unsatisfying manner. 
---
This is especially noticeable when they "explode" from bloody mess kills. The body simply switches to the "gory" variant midair and falls to the ground like paper. 
---
A couple other enemies probably suffer from this as well but this one I remember since day one.
---
Another issue on the Gatlin Gun which I doubt they've fixed, when auto firing it in 3rd person you can see that the cylinder of the gun containing the barrels only plays the animation for the first barrel's rotation, on a loop. 
---
What this means is that instead of having the cylinder rotate fully, it goes back and forth between two barrels since the same animation for the first barrel's rotation plays over and over. On 1st person the animation is fine though.
---
RIP End of the Line shootout.  I must have gotten 100!levels there.  I’m kinda glad because now I can use my tent again.  Sounds like good changes.  Not sure if I like the mob levels being normalized to the player.  I remember when they did this in WoW and it kinda destroyed the mystique of higher level areas.
---
Jack can be applied, but the preview did not show the paint
---
It shows up and adds the atom shop icon, but the textures themselves don't change.
---
Haven't actually crafted it so I don't know if the problem persists on the model the weapon uses while in use or it's just a _go model problem.
---
mine was 90 minutes, then a couple hours for the servers to come back.
---
We could really do with Vault 76 themed items. We have had very few since the beginning of the game
---
What weapons, armor and build do you use?
---
both one and two handed will never be top tier since unarmed will have higher damage, speed and only costs 3 perk cards compared to 9 to get full damage.
---
the only difference is if you want to wear PA.
---
The spec ops BOS mask?
---
"So we've added in a new skin for the LMG. It's a stick. That's it. Just a literal stick. It's not even the same size as the LMG."
---
I am Xbox.
---
You should take the time to read some of the posts that people put on here. It is definitely a people problem.
---
Wish they'd at least keep the old damage on private servers. Been a real hit to my RP.
---
&gt;**Fishbones:** No longer flees from nearby hostiles at Ohio River Adventures.
---
... what
---
If you hate it so much, then why play it? If you want It to be better, focus on the good, and interact more with the community with your suggestions and ideas that could potentially improve the game. You never know when they might listen to you.
---
Order of Mysteries is the most underrated faction.
---
This is broken overpowered.
---
Noice
---
Enemies are just as easy to kill, I'm not stealth, melee or rifle, ammo factory: am I a joke to you op.  Legendary perks aren't that hard, like level 500 max.  None of your points are valid.
---
I get more than 15 days off from my job in this time period. People downvoting you but the comparison is accurate (if anything, my actual job is more lenient).
---
Less damage over all for everybody. Thats pretty much it.
---
Sorry you think my typing "piss off" is an attack. Didn't realize you were so sensitive. I'll be sure to avoid these triggers in the future.
---
wait what. thats.. just dumb
---
So is the rootin tootin cowboy hat still bugged because I've about had it with the shit support team
---
Genuinely feels like it's just been forgotten about lol.
---
I really don't like these seasons/battle pass grinds and was hoping for some story related stuff to give me a reason to play lol
---
This guy gets it, UI and game information should be displayed in such a way that it's easy for new players to understand the basics. I shouldn't have to go to a 3rd party wiki page to find basic information about enemy design or what to do vs not do to any enemy. you don't need to spoon feed it, but have some visual cues or a better health bar or something.
---
They are working on this, though I'm not sure how it will look to outsiders.
---
15 min.  On pc. (Covers head awaiting the beating)
---
It's not like there's anything you can do to avoid it or change it. Things are the way they are now.
---
See AngryTurtle on YouTube
---
Not that simple.
---
I’ll trade you an I.O.U. Toilet Paper, final offer
---
It does not change numbers in pip boy. But should be working, turn in your damage numbers and test it that way
---
So I assume fusion cores aren’t affected?
---
Hell Yeah! About time!
---
They maye be taking a shot at legacy explosive energy weapons.  Its just a theory, since I dont have any.
---
Sorry to here that. I hope you get back on your feet and back to work. I’m def glad I am working and not dealing with healing from a painful surgery like that. Hope everything works out for you.
---
Can I still do those quests after I pick one to raid the vault with?
---
Read up to changing the building team and casual. So does this mean casual will no longer have the luck bonus?? I only used the casual team play for my group.
---
Yay! Now I might be able to have a pet that won’t die at the first mole rat that wonders into my camp 😆
---
I like them all. Because I find them fun. That's my answer to part one and two of your question.
---
Legacy
---
My shotgun still is magic
---
Are you really surprised?
---
A lot of WFMU playlists on Spotify work so good with Fallout
---
I... don't believe you.
---
It's not just Bloodied man, everyone does less damage now. Damage is calculated based on it being addition instead of multiplication. Bloodied sees the biggest loss because we had so many stacking effects that multiplied off each other, but we still do the most out of everyone.
---
Wondering the same...dmg seems a bit too low
---
There were people such as myself who avoided it ***because of the tent exploit.***  People like me will go back to playing it now.
---
Piercing gaze is a new effect that negates all stealth. Get a set of troubleshooter armor to help with survivability against them pesky robots.
---
Have a level 300 character. You unlock your first slot at 50, then 100, 150, 200, 250, then 300.
---
Thank you I honestly can't wait I'm a truck driver and I miss it
---
My update took like 15 minutes
---
my deepest condolences 
---
jk lol
---
All that is great but can it stop an Ant, Mirelurk Hatchling or RadRoach from taking you out during the SBQ fight?
---
The rewards still suck for the SBQ once you have no use for flux aside from ammo, the legendary has no increased chance to be better than your average legendary
---
But everyone will argue it's for the challenge or something, like any fallout past 2 has actually been difficult
---
Hol up. Ppl are still upset about this? Season 1 you couldnt even finish without the repeatables and/or the bonus score weekends and now youre saying u can finish over 2 weeks early WITHOUT all that?! I finished season 1 about 3 weeks early and did NOT play this game like a job, i missed dailies, i didnt grind out repeatable xp, and usually i completed most dailies in under 30mins of play time. Sorry if this offends you, but for a free “battle pass” u dont need to spend atoms to get, if you cant complete season 2 you dont deserve to. Play ANY other MMO or game with a battle pass and tell me the FOMO is harder here. Any easier and they may as well just make it a seasonal bundle that unlocks for everyone day 1. Bring on the downvote idc, but that wont change that THIS is meant to monetize the game so we can get more FREE updates like Wastelanders and Fractured Steel. Youre all a bunch of whiners, i got a full time job and a family and still have plenty of time for this game and other games.
---
Well fuck.
---
Remember the season just started, ignore all these preliminary numbers, people did the math last season and claimed that even if you played every day and did every challenge you wouldn't finish without paying, and yet they were wildly wrong
---
.... my WhiteSprings UFO camp has entered the chat ....
---
A fart by any other name smells just as bad.
---
Hmm.... are they aware Adrenaline still doesn't work in Nuclear Winter?
---
It's great normally. They really fucked em over with the draw nerf tho. I used to put out as much dps as my commando (yes full bloodied with the items to match on both)
---
Where can you find it in the shop?
---
Is there a set note I am meant to find? Cus I can't see any sadly not even the ones from before the patch
---
Only if you 5-3.
---
That's very cryptic! Any clues as to where one should begin searching?
---
PSA you can still get the same result by standing in a certain location, and no i won't say where.
---
Mine says 9 hrs left and been downloading for almost 4hrs
---
Piss off, stop being so god damned negative.
---
Rule #1 food builds only
---
Super duper unlikely
---
This, like 20 levels from this
---
&gt;I expect that like a lot of the comments in here there should be a lot  of focus on the "bloodied nerf" even though almost everything got hit  and Bloodied is still the strongest individual legendary effect and only  gets outdone by (and not even  by a ridiculous amount) weapons that  also have explosive. 
---
I mean I knew it would be low hanging fruit but I still fucking called it yesterday.
---
OH NOES I HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT!111!!!!11!!!!
---
I couldnt one hit kill a mirelurk with a b/fss/1s powerfist while in nerd rage and with a 3.5x sneak buff.
---
stupid policy when you consider how some fantastic games were built on unintended "tricks" skiing in the Tribes series being a good example
---
Turning all the bosses into huge bullet sponges is garbage.  One Wasteland changes makes me want to play less, not more.  I feel less powerful and have to use lots more bullets, bashes, and stimpacks.  The XP gains don't balance out the ammo and stimpacks used.
---
I too would like to know the answer to this.
---
I bet your job isn't only 45 minutes a day
---
I personally think the CHR Bonus is better for events than even the Events PT bc CHR affects your rewards like drops for gear and plans. More XP is inferior to rewards imo. I'll take Formula P during say Meat Week and I saw a difference in rewards albeit RNG. Also Grape Mentats is plus +5 CHR so bonded team is getting you about same vending benefit but for whole time Plus the better drops, at times. Lastly the Roleplaying Community is big in 76 so I see L4G posts daily to join up and RP as the BoS or Responders etc.
---
Open perk menu, at the very top!
---
it still works like an LMG but the attack animation is a two handed swing but you only hold the stick with one hand. and reloading it causes your character to enter the exit PA animation regardless if you are in PA or not. and it will take 3 months and 2 updates before they fix it. also the skin is not removable.
---
I like how you included a video to show us this 'bug'
---
I especially like how the first thing you do in the video is kill a robot with melee and still shoot everything else and doing nothing to them, thinking something is broken
---
I just continue to use the ammo supply from the Raider faction. Gives enough passive ammo to satisfy
---
I've never experienced the correct version of this event.  I'm gonna be so lost the next time I do it.
---
Bloodied weapons was based on multipliers. Heavy guns is less depending on it. So bloodied weapons lost more than machine guns. Stealth builds are now NONSENSE. Gauss Rifle is bugged, Sniper Rifle is slow. So the only way is .50 cals from this update
---
I just noticed all my Bloodied weapons lost half it's  damage smh.
---
Excellent news 👍🏻
---
Nope. Shadowed doesn't help when the enemies literally have a mechanic that forces [Danger] in a radius.
---
Shadowed is really bad and always has been.
---
I heard tell of Dorsey leaving us a note
---
I just find it very strange that you like a game but you can't put your finger on why. You have no real opinion on how the shooting feels, or how the enemies scale, or what the storyline is like.
---
You just like them all.
---
k. I would have thought for a 1st year psych student you would be able to portray why you enjoy playing your favorite game.
---
This is a total shock!  Who could have seen it coming!  Oh yea... this guy... [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/isn5xq/psa\_legendary\_charisma\_does\_not\_allow\_you\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/isn5xq/psa_legendary_charisma_does_not_allow_you_to/)

You can only have 6 legendary perks
---
We are assuming it is a bug as Endurance gives extra Health. For now, we can move points from other trees to Charisma and then use the card on those other trees.
---
**BUGGED - I loaded into one, screen was blurry the entire time and robots would not die. Once you deplete their health they remain alive and just swarm you for repetitive deaths.**
---
No claim ticket detected.
---
They are forcing a rebuild because they don’t know how to remove it.  I would happily have them just vanish, but they can’t program so whatever. I’ll be sad to have to put away the LMG again. Legendary ammo will be nice, but god forbid they balance crafting costs.
---
My 1k+ rifle build would like to have a word.
---
so far I'm not enjoying one wasteland every enemy is harder now its much harder to play solo
---
Had to redo all my fixers names lol
---
Now you know my outrage when playing on a BFA private wow server where they accidentally buffed Survival Hunter to where it was actually viable. But then quietly nerfed it back out of viability because "thats blizzlike" while half the server functions dont work and a couple other classes were still broken and seriously OP.
---
I'm pretty certain one of the server's team was doing pvp and kept getting murdered by a survival hunter so they bitched about it till someone fixed it.
---
Steel Dawn when
---
Adding more I cant get the others to drop 😂 but seriously anything more I can get from events that's rare im in.
---
they were just saying that we were told it was coming this season. that is 100% correct.

Im aware and can still be annoyed by it, thank you lol

I disagree they seem to be following the live service crowd after how well it worked for GTA, fortnite and even Minecraft each having free DLC with micro transactions and being gaming behemoths in their own right

Nothing probably, future content might be exploring the vault in adventure mode.
---
/u/valseek  Small Guns Bobbleheads are not working.
---
All damage modifiers are based on additive math now. Go to the Fallout 76 damage calculator on github and test each one. (I’ve done this.) Everything that increased damage under multiplicative, as far as I’m aware, does less damage now under additive.
---
If you get near Watoga, the quest should auto-start and it'll put a quest marker up.
---
For instance, I'd go to Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02 and go south.

Garbage

I've been dancing for 2 minutes thank to this post. I'm a magic shotgun user, magic shotguns are what shotguns should be, not a wet towel

I was looking for Vampire's last got so lucky, last day of sale someone dropped two three-star items at Rusty Pick, must have reached scrip limit, turned in, got a three-star vamp assault rifle, got very lucky.

Every enemy I've found so far is level 50.

If this is how it is now... then, that's me done :(

I assumed there hasn't been too many new players coming to the game.
---
Alrighty
---
I just solo'ed my Daily Op and achieved Elder with ~30 seconds to spare. I also had the melee only effect and the Mega-Assaultron at the end, so I guess you guys just need to work on your efficiency.
---
To be fair though, I had a lot of practice on the PTS, so I was able to "hit the ground running" as they say.
---
1) Piercing Gaze spawns on all enemies during Uplink.
---
2) You don’t have to use melee to damage Resilient enemies. Just to kill them.
---
You multiply them. 1.8 x 2.5 = 4.5
---
I got the outfit on the first go 🙃
---
So more Mothman crap... sigh.
---
I still haven't gotten my fucking caps from that.

I had it trigger on PS4

If you don't see them, disable your Perk Loadout mod.

Yeah me too. Just thought it was strange.

I have been trying to farm those tickets but the drop rate is so terrible lately. Scorched, ghouls, I kill them all. I think I got 2 over the past two weeks. I’ll even buy someone’s tickets!

I want the Fancy Shotgun so badly but the RNG gods have been kicking me in the teeth.
---
You use to be able to place a camp right in front of the vault 52 door in the north west forest. It just looked cool thats about it.

That is a very good question. I was just running through the lists but never thought about Fusion Cores. I see Ultracite Fusion Cores are at there but I did not search out Fusion Cores in a separate list at the Tinker Bench.

Remind me....

Yes, stealth is useless in the ops
---
Actually there have been TONS! Xbox especially was recently inundated with newbies when the game became free with Xbox Gamepass; you quite literally can often today still find servers with more low levels than high levels. I’m sure a portion of them are alts, but based on the low levels I’ve talked to recently, most are new! Wastelanders + Gamepass brought in tons of new blood!
---
Bye BOS puss
---
Lol. Is this sarcasm?
---
They've said a scrip increase is forthcoming? Genuinely curious as I haven't seen anything about that.
---
Just face tanked the daily op solo with this at 2*... definitely going to max it out eventually.
---
Man they can't run ISS and project paradise, are you surprised?
---
Yeah, after this update not really worth going to the Fort Defiance event anymore unless one wants to farm the caps from the straight jackets inside the building.  :/
---
Oops replied to the wrong person.
---
No regular fusion cores are built at the chemistry station
---
Thanks! I literally only do the workshops for the challenges and then I'm out. So I wasn't even aware there was an ammo machine for them haha level 230 and still finding shit out lol
---
A lot of people at home can't play because they're still downloading the rather large/good sized patch.  I opened the Bethesda Launcher before going to work so when the patch launched it automatically started downloading.  It should be done when I get home or a couple of hours later but I should get a few hours in and a movie before bed.
---
Just earlier today I nearly crippled my legs with 1700 kilos of weapons junk .. it was good while it lasted
---
Bugs where I don't possess reading comprehension? No, those got patched in kindergarten.
---
Me: "Screw you 76 and your bugs!"
---
Also me: "But I'll see you tomorrow."
---
I reported every name I saw when hover over the tent. I am the person that reminds the teacher about the homework. Behave children!
---
Good to know. I was sad to see my anti armor fixer to just be a regular fixer.
---
Specially when the first or second swing doesn’t even register
---
it might be time to go yeehaw again then. especialy since tank killer now works on pistols
---
Any explanation as to why my screen was blurry the entire time?
---
Just want to clarify that the healing effect is intended as others have mentioned, but only while you are wearing PA. If you're *not* wearing Power Armor and it's still healing you, that would be a bug we would want to address. Thanks!
---
I can't tell. I'm still updating. 
---
I'd be searching for any datamine posts in the next few days. Also there is a PA skin from the last datamine that hasn't been released yet.
---
XD
---
Damn, I'm about to max this out then. The amount of energy I see on a dialy basis makes this worth it.
---
Want to see a magic trick? I'm going to delete this post!!
---
But not Tormentor, sadly -- these should both have been changed to affect pistols /u/ladydevann pretty please next patch?
---
NOICE gonna wait for a whole day for that 43 GB update to finish . I hope it'll be worth it 😭😭👍
---
Haha friend was complaining just now about a guy on his public team kept shooting the enemies but didn't melee bash them to finish them off. I swear people need to read.
---
They’ve said multiple times that it’s turned out to be quite the hard bug to pin down but they’re still at it.

They want their camp showcase challenges on the forums to be filled with trash submissions.

I solo'd it as well. An amazing perk.

Any chance of giving Mysterious Stranger a buff? Right now he's borderline useless.

All that salt is gonna give you heart disease
---
Where can I find him?
---
so i got 2 friends and we did it in 10 mins, but i never saw an operation report to claim reward.. i turned off sfe ect and nothing.. so i wasted my time i guess, never got to claim reward
---
My pistols just took it up a notch.
---
Nice!  Do they have any in the shop right now?  Pretty sure I don't have any.
---
I use whatever armor is decent, high level marine and enclave, I focus on unarmed and heavy weapons, use a bloodied power fist and an exploding furious Gatling gun
---
do you perhaps find it to be challenging?
---
Did they nerf all weapons my lever action and handmade do way less damage it seems my sneak build my lever action would one shot at westech and now i dont
---
You're dealing with a hivemind here that will spit on you because they think every single glitch is "unfair" and "breaks" the game. I can understand going into a public lobby and someone having 10+ down. But if you ran across someone that had one/two or even in private servers I see no issue with it. It was always nice coming across people that had one and left them unlocked with 5mm ammo in them.
---
There are the ones I know of in Whitespring-
---
**Whitespring Entrance** *https://imgur.com/a/Dho8Y4E*
---
- Plinths are misaligned
---
- gaps in the railing, seemingly opposing each other (right looking out is fine for the central section, but the far sections are missing, opposite on the left)
---
- lunchbox is too far away from the microcar outside the utility building (still placed for the truck that was there pre-wastelanders)
---
**Whitespring Interior** *https://imgur.com/a/PLlf1UB*
---
- In the crafting area, there is still a light emitter from the old armor workbench that was removed several patches ago
---
- Already mentioned - the gap in Aurum
---
- In the TV room next to the whitespring cinema there is a weird light emittance from the left of the front wall, with the last part of the left wall being darker.
---
- Pretty classic Bethesda bug - in the Whitespring cinema, the fronds on the potted palms clip.
---
- There is a weird lighting bug in the bellhop area, objects aren't being lit inside with a really harsh cutoff.
---
- The sign for Creekside Lodge in the whitespring mall is also almost unlit when viewed from an oblique angle, Black Powder shots for comparison.
---
I for one LOVE this mothman bundle
---
So... RIP power leveling yourself I guess? Only downside I can see so far, since stuff just simply can't spawn at high levels for you until you're high level. 1-60 gonna be a pain.
---
What even is the bug?
---
3 hours later and still at least an hour to go 🙈
---
Hard to avoid the Piercing Gaze enemies as they spawn on every enemy in Uplink. 
---
It’s not hard to kill Resilient enemies either
---
I'm level 277 and I plan on leveling up daily.
---
Lmao i don't think any post on here has made me laugh as much as this one.
---
Good bye to power leveling my friends...
---
Rip best skin
---
Shhh that would make sense bethesda doesn't like that
---
Thanks! Somehow I missed that.
---
Where do you find that ?
---
I was using PA so not a bug. But damn, that is really nice for people who use PA. Finally some love on our end.
---
since unarmed benefits from both twisted muscles and talons, AND has higher base damage and speed, the powerfist will always outdamage any 2 handed option at 1/3th of the card cost currently.
---
Melee damage +25%, better chance to cripple limbs, but unarmed also has "Punching attacks do 25% more damage + bleed damage"
---
that might change after todays patch but i dont think so.
---
Edit: after logging in after the patch, the gap certainly got closed, the weapons seem to be pretty even damage number wise now (though unarmed still is faster) but it should only be a difference of 20's instead of 100's of damage now. so as a melee build who wanted ot use something else then a powerfist, this is a welcome change!
---
though it seems unarmed still has the advantage in legendary perks, the 3 levels in iron fist almost seem useless too, without it i got 227 damage on a powerifst and with its 238
---
I’m super interested to see how it fairs during Queen fights.
---
No not really.
---
When Line in the Sand bug is being used all the enemies *drop out of the sky* into one big pile.  
---
Radiation Rumble isn't anything like it.
---
Are you on PS4? Murm gave me one this week but I’m a rifle build EDIT: I can’t read lol just saw your flair
---
Lackluster additions this week... which is a bummer considering this is such a big update. I love Moth Man and own all kind of Moth Man related stuff, but they gotta give us more diversity in their offerings.  
---
Where's Enclave related bundle stuff?
---
Here’s the deal. When it comes to an exploit ask yourself this simple question. “Does this have any negative effect on me in any way, or am I losing out of something because the other guy is doing this?” If the answer is NO then keep going about your own business. If the answer is YES, then complain. 
---
Here is a great example. Making double sided walls, no. Making the ammo factory, no. Using the flame trap to glitch other camp items, no. None of these items will have a negative effect on you. 
---
Here is one that will. Stacking traps on top of one another to kill people at camps, yes. It was an annoying glitch that did have an impact on players. It was also removed. 
---
Most people look at this game as a fallout game with  friends. I don’t care if you glitch your camp. It doesn’t mess with my experience. Now if you are running around with modded gear and killing other players, then yes you should be banned.
---
I just find it so funny that people in this thread are mad Bethesda didn’t ban ammo factory exploiters. What did they do to you, Not buy your over priced ammo??
---
Edit: words
---
What are you on about?
---
I stopped doing the event when people glitched it.  Lag was nuts.
---
No poodle skirt comeback... again.
---
Anyone using magic weapons willingly to exploit the game should be banned.
---
I almost feel like that has to be fake some how, it's insane healing that makes you invincible
---
&gt;That was literally in angry turtle's video
---
You say that as though ever single person playing this game  knows who he is and  watches every single video he makes. I assure you that is not the case, nor should it be.
---
1-800-GeneralNow I will give you AWESOME car insurance!
---
You’re the ignorant guy filled with smug certainty when you actually don’t know what the hell you are talking about.
---
I am 8 levels behind my husband, and want to catch up so we’re hitting level 150 at the same time. We only do new quests together. We stopped playing for a year, and I’ve been doing dailies and re-exploring areas I haven’t been since launch. I decided to explore Defiance because I remember it being tense, fun, and feeling the closest to F3.
---
I became hopelessly overloaded and placed my tent in front on the road, then left it there to jump off to other areas for the next few days. The “defend Fort Defiance” started once. I have no meta builds, no meta weapons, don’t use VATS, and low powered armor for role play reasons (light leather). I vaguely recalled doing the event once before over a year ago.
---
I got fucking destroyed. In a panic I ran and tried to take cover everywhere, but ended up burning all my stimpacks, food, and colas, failed the event and was wondering what in the hell had just happened, because I didn’t remember the event being that insane before. It was as if whole clumps of scorched were spawning directly on top of me and the turret. I was exclaiming to my husband on video chat “What the hell is happening?!?” over and over while it went down.
---
I crawled away from there with all my equipment wrecked thinking that Beth had wildly buffed the event, but now as of this morning know what happened. I accidentally broke it.
---
Take your smirking “suuure you’re innocent” and cram it. With actual Cram.
---
C busssss
---
What? I didn’t hear you.
---
Hard to find friends on ps4.. welp, at least I can get a handmade easier now
---
Yawn
---
Definitely not, for my sole Fusion generator has been on its place for a few months. Perhaps one of my Atomic Shop items caused the trouble? If this possibility is present, please notify me so i could give you a list of them below.
---
Thank you....so yeah...it's a nope !
---
Nowhere does it say that steel Dawn was released with one wasteland.
---
I finally got a mega sloth in my camp and had him for a couple of weeks but he just disappeared at the beginning of the week.
---
Why does that happen? Was it because I swapped out the animal friend perk cards? 
---
Did something actually kill him? How could I tell if it did?
---
Lemme get a pet tick, she could make a blood pack like every 30 minutes or something
---
I think they are talking about the ammo thing(i can not think of the name sorry) you get from the raiders at max level.
---
No one can truly explain magic effects,  it's why their magic.
---
Their effects that shouldn't be happening.
---
Why are you calling me a 1st year psych student? Did you think that I was calling myself that? No. Let me explain: you insinuating that my unwillingness to answer your question infers that I have an underlying addiction or some sort of general confusion about my enjoyment is the behavior of a 1st year psych student who thinks they know everything there is to know about Psychology and they try to psychoanalyze situations in their life that do not need such analysis. That must have gone over your head, that's okay. I'll admit that might be somewhat obscure of a thing to say.
---
But, as I said before, you'll get no more of a satisfying answer than "I just like it" from me. At first because I didn't owe you an explanation of why I liked something. Now, it's because there's a hint that it irritates you at some level that I won't. It amuses me. That's called being obstinate.
---
I freely admit that I should have claimed the rewards right away and, I personally, have no excuse.  But you're ignoring the fact that life doesn't always work on Bethesda's schedule.  
---
I'm willing to bet that there are players who missed out on rewards simply because of life events such as being sick etc.  Is it too much to ask for the rewards to still be available from the last season?
---
Enemies normally spawn infrequently or get stuck pathing to the fort.
---
Shitty waste of time event, just like Tea Time, Feed the People, Corpse Flowers
---
*not....my bad.
---
Yeah that difficult glitch of weapons jammed together! I'm pretty sure only a genius could come up with a script that checks your items on game start for glaring irregularities!
---
I had a guy rip me apart over a workbench near my camp. He then ripped apart my camp and when I went to visit him at his camp he had a ton of those. 
---
That wanker.
---
I did it without knowing, i just needed ammo so i placed the tent and then they all went to the center
---
Man. Everyone so on edge when mentioning dupes.  Lol.
---
ah ok thanks!
---
*but...lol.
---
Its literally one of the most talked about point in the last few weeks in the subs and basically everywhere fallout 76 related. How did you miss everyone talking about the damage nerve lol
---
I can hear “it’s” voice saying that even.
---
I had a good chuckle.
---
Walk around the north of watoga and you’ll find a note that’s what your “supposed” to do before a daily op but a lot of people don’t
---
Besides the adrenaline part it sounds like the patch is working as intended.
---
Congratulations?
---
Outer Worlds was never supposed to kill Bethesda Fallouts or 76, that's just internet fanboy bullshit. Outer Worlds was just expected to be a better game than a Bethesda Fallout game, a return to glory of sorts for the original Fallout devs, which it was. Better story, better characters, better gameplay, better everything really.
---
Not saying that means people have to like Outer Worlds, people can like whatever they want, but without a doubt Outer Worlds is far and away the higher quality game, regardless of which game you like more.
---
I don't play 76 much anymore, just once in a while to see what's improved (usually very little if anything). My buddy absolutely loves 76, plays it regularly, it's one of his favorite games EVER. And even he admits that Outer Worlds is clearly the better game, even though he enjoys 76 more.
---
After the sports - the weather forecast....
---
IT'S RAINING SALTY TEARS!
---
Oh noes. 50000 robots
---
As i told a random over ingame vc, we are playing entirely different games. After he talked about the upcoming patch and being panicked.
---
Sorry I always fall asleep hearing his voice
---
Does the BoS expansion offer a new land mass to explore? 
---
Or is it just... instanced dungeons and new quests?
---
Are you implying perk cards are scrapable?
---
Interesting, so the modifiers are different for others then, Bc mine were invisible enemies.
---
And iiiiiiiive had the time of my liii I iiiife ....
---
You're going to love hunting down the scorched hiding behind a tree after 5 minutes of wondering why nothing is spawning
---
Get level 300.

How the hell do you look at the report on PC? Everytime i completed an Op it said to verify it to exit but i had no clue where to find it.
---
Whew. My balls dropped into my shoe.
---
Oh I thought they were the same for everyone.
---
He said he's done being that guy.
---
Sad
---
I played casually almost every day but made no discernible attempt to scorewhore and only got 3/4 through.
---
Pfffft.
---
Just what I wanted, more mothman crap.
---
Its gonna be pretty much grindy if you're new to the game. 
---
It wouldn't be much of a grind if you already had a leveled character but since you don't you gotta count all the hours spent looking for mats. Discovering the farm areas. 
---
Its not much better in fo76 some people would actually call it worse.
---
Now if only I had a magic weapon.
---
Frustrating that a 50 caliber sniper now takes 8 rounds to put down a super mutant, when it used to take 2.
---
Suggestion:  Make this a Google spreadsheet.
---
Let's say you do scorched earth and you lose 95% health, if a tesla wielding player shoots you will this benefit as well
---
Would also like to know
---
Did you say corset? Where can I find an image of it? I hope it can be passed off as piratey.
---
Still isn’t shit compared to modern warfare, I think my last one was like 80. I’m on apartment internet so it’s still gonna take a while unfortunately.
---
Don't celebrate me too much, it's actually not that difficult.
---
As a fan of the fallout 4 building system myself, I have to tell you that 76's camp system is definitely way worse. Way too grindy since you have to find plans for every single build peice, then find all the materials. And the system itself is so limiting and restrictive that you cant even create something good looking without a few exploits. Not to mention that the camp items in the atomic shop are overpriced as hell. (Just like everything else in the shop). The only great part of camps is being able to build wherever you want. So if you wanna buy fallout 76 just for the base building, then I'd suggest not getting it.
---
I'm sorry I seem to have missed #1. How does that work? How much does it cost?
---
Valseek is official as official comes
---
How do you do double sided walls now? I thought they removed that in patch 21? I can only place double sided doors by snapping them to different adjacent tiles.
---
Since we are going to have to fire more bullets to take down enemies, can you please increase the weapon condition bar or just make it degrade slower? Thanks!
---
Thanks for sharing, it's good to at least see that it is being recognized (though clearly not prioritized), for what it's worth.
---
Thanks for the kind words, I love fallout but am concerned with the approach to balance here.
---
There's lessons to be learned from other multiplayer games that failed.. like MechWarrior Online.. when something was too good, only nerf... Never buff. As a result, no play style felt good. Here in FO76... It's bloody commando meta, and only maybe heavy PA comes as close to great. We need Many Different FUN playstyles.
---
Thats not a glitch. They're literally working as intended no sarcasm. You should be meleeing them as last hit.
---
Well you said you were a 1st year psych student. 
---
And I figured, someone who is taking that kind of a class, would know how to describe, using their own words, why they like or dislike something. 
---
That's it.
---
You're smarter than me, obviously. But you aren't willing to explain why you like the game. 
---
What a developer emailed you and asked you specifically what areas of the game you enjoy most? Would you show him the same hostility. 
---
I'm on YOUR side.
---
Yikes. My internet downloads a gig in like 1.5 minutes
---
Ooh you seem really cool and in the loop. Wowwe. 😎
---
Curious to why you ask that? Doesn't it only work with energy attacks?
---
to equip a legendary perk is free. to unequip costs one perk coin. you get perk coins by scrapping excess perk cards.
---
Hey could you please elaborate on it?
---
It's clunky and slow.  It seems like the interface is purposely designed to waste a bunch of time.  It's faster for me to just go farm lead and steel and make more bullets, and then I get the included benefit of earning XP.
---
Have you tried to melee them?
---
My friends gonna be pissed he put so much time into his base now he’s gotta rebuild 😂😂
---
Ah alright, thanks!
---
punch them...they only die by melee RTFM.
---
do you have to unlock that perk card or if you're already a super high level can you just start investing points into it?
---
Does nobody read anything when it pops up right in front of them?
---
Wow that's crazy, it's almost like they changed the way damage is calculated but idk no one is talking about it
---
LOL. For real tho. But hey, I’ll miss those days
---
Damn I was hoping that wasn’t the case
---
So when Valseek said this wasn’t supposed to be a nerf it was actually a nerf. I am shocked
---
No, that doesn't make any sense.
---
Oh wow! What a bummer it’s gone!    
---
      
---
*thank you for explaining it to me too!
---
clownshoes
---
Your tears perhaps?
---
Long-time FO4 builder here. Resource costs for building in 76 are quite low and you'll easily amass enough material to build in earnest by level 10.
---
The grind is in obtaining the plans you'll need to unlock workshop objects, decorations, lights, generators, and other types of walls and floors. The game initially provides you with very little to work with variety-wise.
---
In terms of flexibility, 76 is incredibly restrictive. No rug glitch, no wire glitch, no Size bar reduction, and no group select. With few exceptions, every structure piece has to snap to something else. No floating walls, no varying angles, nothing. It is almost impossible to remove collision.
---
Basically, the more experienced you are with FO4 building, the more annoyed and frustrated you will be with 76.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Can you wear those red Mothman goggles separate from the hat?
---
Yeah I think I will be skipping Ops with that variable myself.
---
Yes it states this in the patch notes
---
Dude... Read the mission description, especially "enemy mutations" part!
---
Um... go look op the daily ops mechanics lol that’s should explain it for you
---
**GARBAGE. UPDATE.**
---
Do you need a xbox controller to play?
---
derp
---
Same just noticed this as well
---
Why weren't they claimed when they were won? Those people were able to play enough to win the prizes, right?
---
lol you can gun bash 500 robots in a tunnel before they kill you. Bs
---
Servers are up on xbox
---
Oh thats so confusing I did have a glitch like this before thats why I was worried but also there is a invisible robot
---
It's like they hate FO1st subscribers out of spite for needing them to fund that show on Amazon.
---
why would someone want the penalties removed? do people actually whine that they have to engage with a couple of simple survival mechanics?
---
I’ve spent probably over 1000 caps to get to crater during the duration of the nuke quest

I actually just joined the reddit group today and didn’t really notice cause I just started playing again like 2 weeks ago
---
No a bug
---
Idk whether you're trolling or not lol. Basically its a bug where when you go to fast travel somewhere the map it'll just exit the map and won't do anything,  happens quite a bit and sometimes will happen multiple times before it actually lets you fast travel.
---
So what you're saying is that you're not op now, boo hoo
---
There is too much logic in this reply. You also failed to fall in line with the groupthink. Expect two infractions against your account.
---
It opens level 0 locks and terminals automatically. Also get +3 lock picking and +3 hacking, all in one card, that doesn’t take up normal slots
---
*cRy MoRe*
---
Latency is annoying for most fps. Wasteland 3 on xcloud on the other hand...
---
Haha that part I knew, just not the unequip cost. I guess that's not the worst. Probably to prevent loadouts changes on the fly constantly.
---
Shoot them to 1ho then bash them
---
I play it all the time on XBox... but my camp is right behind Ft Defiance. Before I moved to that neighborhood I usually sat it out unless I was close to leveling.
---
Someone mentioned earlier either later this year or they just decided not to do it.
---
I love Daily Ops for one reason: it's demonstrating just how little people pay attention to how the game works.
---
Scrapping perk cards, collecting 400 unused levels for more perk cards and scrapping them too, opening the 50 unopened perk card packs , then scrapping them as well. Slotting all 6 legendary perk cards at max rank (level 748). Grinning, logging off and going to bed....
---
You should probably ready patch notes. They didn't just change damage they changed a lot.
---
It’s a beginning for the rest that is coming. Just because the content isn’t added as fast as you would like doesn’t mean it wasn’t added. 
---
Same goes for the Earl event. It’s a new instance and a new boss and a new fight. 
---
This game doesn’t seem to cater to your playstyle. It caters to a different playstyle. And that’s why you’re bored with it and others are not. 
---
Mystery Solved.
---
Yes, especially if you not directly connected to the router with a ethernet cable. Also it's a pretty sizable update, unless your use to downloading 30gb updates super quick.
---
Same. I’ll PM you
---
TLDR?
---
They take damage but will not die until a melee finishes them.
---
8
---
Your camp is only gone if you placed them in your camp. Guy I play with had the blueprint which he only used in private world workshops, and not in his camp. His camp is still standing.
---
C'mon, don't be a cocktease. What is it?
---
I’m at school and have AP homework
---
Chr legendary perk card DOES NOT allow for sharing of higher rank cards, instead move points into CHR from another SPECIAL stat and then take the other stat with the Legendary perk card to increase it by the equivalent amount
---
Holy shit. Are you me? I think after months I finally finished that quest chain and shut that annoying bitch up. I was just muting my sound for a bit when I logged in.
---
Alright, what's broken?
---
:(. So, worthless for non power armor builds that use cores for weapons? 
---
I'm super sad about this.
---
Well I did read the patch notes but I didn’t see that they changed melee damage
---
I never heard of a patch "breaking" an exploit but ok. Unique take on it.
---
Yes for points to lvl up legendary perk cards
---
  Thats better than your ally immediately going hostile and shooting up your camp, which is what Beckett did to mine :)
---
  Is it just one particular ally, or any ally you place?
---
Man. That’d be an amazing Alpha for Project Paradise
---
Every event has people that don't know what to do, bitch about it then when you tell them how to figure it out they get pissed.
---
[There's an R91 skin for the Handmade in the files](https://youtu.be/EpZhMjCVQcw), but it's been in there for months now and they haven't yet added the promotional screenshots that would appear in the shop, so who knows when they'll release it. I check these threads for it every week the same way so many others check for the Vertibird PA.
---
It's fun. That's all there is to it. Fun is fun
---
The one that makes you immune to energy attacks, because it's a no brainier
---
Also, in case anyone hadn't heard yet, there are NPC's in the game now.
---
Or the scorchbeast staying behind the asylum. I noticed they didn't fix any pathing on there.  If you "fix" a bugged event, fix all the bugs.
---
I'll try again later when my annoyance dies down, lol.
---
Taking one for the Team, Funky Duds, Legendary STR, AGL, Luck and not decided for certain on the last one, either another Special stat or Electric Absorption.
---
Ok so it wasn’t just me then that’s good to know
---
You mean two-shot is actually doing the damage of two shots again, the way it was intended, before it got nerfed?
---
I'm surely glad I stubbornly held onto my TS gauss pistol, rifle, and minigun, because hopefully they intentionally fixed it.
---
Fusion cores also count under the perk, at max with ammosmith you get 4 instead of 1.
---
Excellent work with the chart, got that saved down and stowed away for future reference:)
---
Square up, play doh
---
Gospel? It's taking what he said at face value. He said the penalty would be removed with One Wasteland and it hasn't been. Plans change, that's fine, but he said a thing would happen and without any new info, it didn't happen. He didn't say it was a maybe thing that might make it into One Wasteland, he said it's something coming with One Wasteland. Simple and clear. People need to stop making excuses for Bethesda, they don't deserve it.
---
So does the damage go lower since the names gone?
---
Just use pa and a vamp minigun, bash em to kill em but shoot them to stay full health
---
You can build one CAMP in Fallout 76. That's your home. It's got a budget more limited than a full settlement and shouldn't take you all that long to collect resources.
---
There are "settlements" across FO76 which are called Workshops. You can build there but they are PVP zones. It is possible to own all the Workshops and build in all of them simultaneously, but again, you *will* be PVP'd at those locations.
---
I missed a total of 3 weeks during the last season and still finished it with a week to spare.
---
Yes on my big guns
---
I've been a pistol build for a long time. Definitely a welcome change
---
They changed damage calculation, no specific weapons. It applies to ALL weapons.
---
wat
---
Weapons that cap at 45 only exist in variants of *5... Ex: level 15, 25, 35
---
Exactly. People wouldn't feel the need to glitch the event if it fucking worked properly.
---
Try a shredder on your minigun. I wonder if tomohawks count as melee for that mutation.
---
i find people complaining about a challenge to be challenging.
---
Vanguard's gear isn't all that good
---
damn man. i'm hoping to move within the next couple months so i can finally get out of this hellhole
---
RIP my hope that I would one day discover Abandoned Bogtown. ☠️
---
Go complete collision course.  It usually drops a melee weapon, or you can pick up one off one of the dead scorched.
---
or find (a cheap) one at a player vendor.  I have a couple in my machine, but they are 3\*.
---
Not bad. Are any specific to NW again?  Or anything specific now to Daily Ops?
---
Second
---
The new Ammo Factory Legendary perk card should help with this.  From other posts I understand that it will stack with Ammo Smith, so you get 250% more ammo when it's maxed out.
---
Tyvm, are they tradeable?
---
1) you can't go that high
---
2) godmode =/= "a little help"
---
I actually found a bloodied explosive gatling with bash damage. Crit-sniping with it is amazing.
---
I was using it while my update finished also. Not plausible for long term play but will definitely come in handy if my home net goes haywire.
---
Well I mean if you don't want your stash box because it looks boring, I'd gladly take it off of your hands... But to be honest that shit should've been given to everyone for free, and Fallout 1st shouldn't even exist. They tried to pull an ESO with their crafting bags but completely forgot that while crafting in ESO was completely optional and niche, crafting in Fallout 76 is almost mandatory and is definitely one of the predominant features of the game considering how much they try and push crafting gear and building player homes. Yes it sucks that you aren't getting your money's worth for purchasing Fallout 1st, but in hindsight you were setting yourself up for failure by trusting bethesda with any amount of monthly payments. I mean I preordered the game for $60 and a month later it was on amazon for a third of that price. All I got for that was $5 worth of atoms and a lame armor set despite the fact that if they had given us Fallout 1st for free it would've made up the difference.
---
swarm of lvl 100 super mutants with missile launchers are my favourite right now.  Even sneaking they lock on and literally poon me :P
---
I got to admit I kind of like that clipping on the Strangler Heart PA. Wish there was a way to intentionally have that occur for those who want it.
---
People are protesting in the streets right now
---
Big oof
---
Thank you for your time!
---
P.S. I see Communist Fence and Blood Eagle Nest are in a change list. I'm using them in my C.A.M.P. Perhaps this information can help FO76 team with a resolution of mentioned budget problem.
---
I ran through it a melee build until the final boss. My JE Gat plaz is still as good as before so I shot the last boss to hell and bashed it and still got elder rank.
---
Yeah, it's great.  Mine took like 15 minutes. I mean, I don't have those speeds, but yeah
---
Choose wisely -  if you change your mind, they charge a point to unequip a card.
---
I see youre a person of culture too
---
Waiting until Fractured Steel &amp; Camp Interiors.
---
So.. fix the fixer?
---
it's not meant to be easy. wtf. come on!
---
Bethesda: here is new challenge, it's very difficult and strategy-specific.
---
Players: I don't like this new challenge, it's too difficult and requires a strategy I'm not used to.
---
It is a thing.
---
I wonder how my camp will fair,  I get quiet the variety of unwanted visitors to my outpost.  Guess I will find out tonight when I get home and settled in.  
---
I do hope that some sort of solution is found for your situation.
---
In the movie I referenced, Korg tells the illusion of Loki to [‘Piss off, ghost.’](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=Cr-wOQSUWQk)
---
I have a feeling that a pop culture movie is more likely the source of the comment than the esoteric radio show you mentioned.
---
Currently at work on a construction site in Denver. Can't wait to play in 4 hours
---
Vats seems to help with the latency issue in this game.
---
Turtle did a video on heavy weapons after patch, TSE with demo expert outdamages BE with demo expert now and those two are top in class right ahead of JE and AAE
---
Kinda sucks for 308 rounds. I use an AA lmg with ffr. Burns through ammo like shit through a goose.
---
I have bloody, mutations, unarmed, full unyielding armor, melee and I went from 1.8k dmg to 360 dmg. It is ok but not nearly as good anymore
---
You have to bring it up to even join the event. That ops info.
---
So skip this one.
---
Oh just wait till the Chinese SS users find how dry fucked they've been with this patch.
---
And camp builders with turrets that are pointless.
---
Stoked about the ss camo underarmor
---
We talked about this in length before, Im the one who made the visual bugs list that came with wastelanders, Ive been lurking for a while, but I honestly dont think we'll get a fix for their "upgrade" I wish more people had a chance to see the game on max settings pre wastelanders, I think they'd have a different oppinion on the graphics.
---
It’s because going from 35 to 50 wouldn’t make sense.
---
E P I C
---
So is that why my wepons seem so weak this update my lever action would one shot with my stealth build and it doesn’t and my handmade doesn’t hit as hard either anymore 😔
---
I remember when it would take 4 hours to download a song.
---
Same dude
---
Why did they remove these? None of the perks except the SPECIAL ones are really appealing to me
---
Aha!
---
And how would bethesda know who is doing it willingly?
---
It is honestly a stupid mutation, make enemies invincible to all damage except Melee.
---
Its a bug there working on it
---
Anybody experience invincible robots doing Daily Ops?...
---
Why would they even affect you?
---
I solod earl last night with your gun.
---
1 point adrenaline, 3 gun fu : this is the way
---
It’s not here yet. So we don’t know. 
---
That’s part of the allure; *what’s coming next?*
---
check the raider vendor
---
Assume u r talking about melee only enemies.  Btw, does my power fist count as melee?
---
I am getting the drops still, just no ending summary.
---
Ahhh kk I can wreck them then bash them with rifle butt to finish them off, or it needs to be a proper melee weapon?
---
That's hacking
---
Went to an event, 1 level 100 super mutant that every shot i make takes  tiny chunk of health off and i would need to put hundreds of shots in, kills me in 2 shots, then is joined by a dozen of his friends and i just gave up as i spawned and died in a second. 
---
So far it seems that people that have the 'almightly powerful weapons and secret setups' will love it, people that don't are just going to get stomped, which is depressing.   I have a sniper rifle, fixer, tesla and they just do NOTHING to enemies. 
---
That and i think for the first time, i've caught the SCORE auto complete bug. :(
---
Start a new character, get them to level 2. Takes about 5 minutes
---
Just scrap the ones you dont need. Why would you need to save max cards you dont use anyways?
---
Hack and Slash is core.
---
Take one for the team, Follow through and Exploding palm are optional.
---
The other exploding perks are a waste of coins
---
I already saw that post.  I'm just afraid that some how that post was wrong.  It's like the best perk ever, good job guys.
---
Mine too!
---
I honestly thought it was Napoleon Dynamite but I see your point 🤣😂
---
It’s not released with this update sadly mate
---
If you dint use them scrap them
---
Turrets will take 5 mins to kill it.
---
Lol glad I decided not to build a camp there...
---
You wait for it to be released in a few months, then it will start automatically.
---
It's funny, the final boss was one of the easiest parts of my first try.
---
I was at the Galleria, and there was no end to the stupid invisible Blood Eagles, and I had to keep switching back and forth between my TSE laser rifle and TS shotgun because even the dogs are invisible and they kept sneaking up on me. But once it was one-ish on one? No problem at all.
---
Now we can get her to land more easy for the asshole magic weapon fucker who doesn’t let everyone get a tag in before killing her.
---
You wait until that content actually releases later this year.
---
Yes. A totally awesome glitch.
---
When it's released, you can start
---
Yeah, this patch blows so much, how much is your power fist doing now out of curiosity?
---
From the title alone I thought this was yet any other whine fest about the nerf lol
---
I just sell things based on what they're worth to me...and my particular build and remaining weight. Some lucky dude got an two-shot explosive handmade because I didn't feel like carrying it anymore.
---
Let me give you my straight answer. With all my melee perks, mutations, and unyielding set, I went from doing around 1.8k dmg to 360 dmg. And what’s worse is I just started this build 2-3 weeks ago. (Edit- I’m bloodied)
---
Same as before. Bethesda patched it then reverted the fix. Use door frames and they clip into each other but on opposite direction.
---
are all their bugs unintentional? Or should we play a broken game knowing their intentional so we’re not breaking their code Of conduct. It’s boggling my mind how I’m suppose to play this now without being banned
---
Gonna make ward but the black guy version. Ward's brother from another mother
---
There are many scenarios where you are halfway through and then something happens to prevent you from returning to the game for a while.
---
Here is a better question, why such a pushback on such a simple feature request that can make things easier for other players?
---
I mean, it's not like I'm asking for access to rewards that weren't earned.  And is it so hard to understand that some players might not have picked up all of the rewards before the board gets wiped for the new season?
---
Haha, I wish I was that beaut of a man, Im not though! Just a thief of good names :((
---
Edit: just a quick for the record: this is the first time anyone has said anything on it, it feels a lil shitty cause Im basically a freud, but ay, hah
---
why not lol.
---
Haha.
---
Lot of cool things in this patch and a bunch of improvements the community has been asking for. Looking forward to jumping in after work!
---
Do you have any Idea how much they cost?
---
Yeeeep. Just because you're the perfect victim doesnt mean you deserve to be victimized. I know some guys who troll this hard just for kicks, this isnt a hypothetical, it has happened.
---
why would they be trolling? some of us have never experienced the bug.
---
I know how you feel.  Even with Sneak and Instigating weapon I can't kill supermutants at West Tek with 1 shot.  Takes 2 to 4.
---
Outside of the legendary Perks I used 1-2 pieces of Troubleshooter's Armor and 20 or so stimpacks to tank damage.
---
Uhh, isn't that a bit strong? I LOVE IT
---
I literally can't tell the damage difference on regular enemies.  It's hilarious.  This "nerf" did absolutely nothing for me.
---
No, Valseek commented on my post saying it was intended but only for PA users.
---
No you can still damage them with any weapon. They just have to die by melee. That is all. Brr brr bash they’re done.
---
Great. There go my plans to dump all my food perks and add some rifle perks
---
Sounds like I'm gonna enjoy it more, as I thought when hearing about this nerf. Nice, appreciate the update. 👍
---
well good sir consider me subscribed to this awesome blog!
---
Tried to fast travel to Freddy Fear's House of Scares ended up cycling through loading screens endlessly while the game did nothing. Had to force close the game in Task Manager... it's always something.
---
they a snitch.
---
or the kid in class that reminds the teacher they forgot to assign homework.
---
You are supposed to navigate to see that screen. Is that coming up by default, or are you navigating to it?
---
This never happened on PTS after playing it once.
---
Try joining and immediately backing out. Should go away.
---
That's what new characters are for.
---
Here's to hoping my junkies explosive shotty will be okay for invisible enemies in the new ops. 50% less durability means I dont need to run gunsmith :)
---
Not a glitch, bathesda replied on one of my posts confirming it is supposed to work that way but only in PA.
---
I already know most will disagree with me but im.not enjoying One Wasteland, my character is not in the end game yet. Its now impossible for me to clear any place or do any event without using 10-20 stimpaks or using all of my ammo. im lvl 43 and I can't supply run the forest without getting wrecked. im fine with increasing diffulculty but most of the enemies for me are now bullet sponges. its not fun its just aggravating for me. Before anybody jumps on me this is just my opinion I was really enjoying it but this update is a killer if your not in the endgame. It shouldn't take 3 point blank blasts of a shotgun to kill a weak feral ghoul
---
One player wasteland
---
100 bullion each and you can buy 3 from each vendor in Crater and Foundation.  I hope that is per day cause then it gives me something to spend bullion on.
---
Thank god Bethesda knocked y’all off your high horse. 
---
And yes, there’s supposed to only be 3 digits there.
---
Legacy weapons have broken damage and are still competitive
---
Yup, from what I tested both bugs still exist. Bloodied is weaker now and enemies are tougher so I expect to die a lot more often from the bug that locks me from using a damn stimpack or run for my life.. and the worst of all.. not a word from the devs.
---
Everything's still good as far as mobs go. Bosses are a different story.
---
Okay but this is Bethesda we're talking about which also contributed to my lack of faith in the game. Haven't they refused to fix some pretty important things? 
---
I feel like, if the engine can barely handle NPCs in the world, or how it's so hard to design a simple quest, is there any REAL hope of anything more advanced coming our way?
---
Because in my opinion, if you earned the reward, you were given the opportunity to claim it. At that very moment. What could possibly be easier than that?
---
6 total at level 300. You cannot have multiple of the same legendary perk.
---
Yes seems to. Very BOS.
---
Riiiiiight 😉
---
cosigned
---
Try running past the enemies with your insane AP and tanking everything with Dodgy perk.
---
I had no problems despite Piercing Gaze.
---
*Yes, the world’s problems all started in 1991.  We didn’t have any racism or genocide or poverty or disease before then.  Damn that Al Gore and his invention!!*
---
So my bf had this issue for days and literally was about to give up. Have you tried going in one server and then going to another?? He had the issue where he could add the fuse but it wouldn’t let him analyze the blood sample since he had already put that in the first time he tried to do it. So we just kept changing servers and it finally worked.
---
For me I quit the game and it worked. It’s really frustrating how this is STILL an issue. Best of luck.
---
At level 80, I'm hoping adjusting levels doesn't mean encountering level 50+ enemies everywhere.
---
yeah not everybody obsessively seeks out every crumb of info on a game update day after day until its release.
---
I noped out after trying to bash using my shotgun build. I skipped on outta there and then canceled my sub. I got 9 more days on 1st.
---
So an unlisted ability? If so that perk is totally worth a slot. The amount of healing is awesome.
---
I dont like the dps nerf or the super spongy enemies now. Otherwise ok.
---
261 :/
---
It’s not always just wasting ammo. I have unloaded into groups well past their limit. It’s a good way to get a groups health down so they can be quickly taken out with melle.
---
So what you're saying is you literally did not read anything beyond the title of the thread. Also no, you have to reach level three because going from one to two is part of the Vault 76 tutorial and doesn't count.
---
Same :/
---
By "invincible" do you mean the ones it clearly states you have to kill with melee? I've heard about em.
---
It did nerf builders and it did nerf punjis again.
---
No, because I read the Daily OP's description that they need to be defeated by melee.
---
Holy crap I NEED that camo AR-15 skin. The stars and stripes Handmade is pretty awesome too.
---
I did as well. Maybe it’s random per server or something
---
&gt; That's hacking
---
How is Bethesda developing a script in their own game considered "hacking"?
---
For those confused... No this this is NOT the Ammo Converter, nor for the Bouillon Ammo machine
---
This is for the people that blueprinted the Ammo machine maker from the 'Converted Munitions Factory' workshop. Basically a copy/paste exploit.
---
Well actually from what i've gathered from this post, things are pretty much the same. 
---
I guess some people consider a new dungeon or a new npc that comments on the weather to be "content" but I guess my standards are just a bit higher. Especially from a two year old game made by, supposedly, an multi-award winning game studio.
---
But who knows. Maybe I just expect too much.
---
I’ve tried literally everything about a hundred times but thank you, I’m going to just wait until someone in Bethesda figures it out.
---
There was a high risk/high reward playstyle with bloodied unarmed before. Now it's just pointless. High horse or no, they just brought the build behind the shed and put it down for the sake of "balance".
---
It literally tells you that you have to BASH. THEM. DOOOWN. Seriously, only melee attacks can kill them
---
Added it
---
Nope! Because I can read, I read the instructions and saw the clear description that they need to be melee killed.
---
Brilliant!
---
these guys are trolling right?
---
Refused?  No. 
---
Had delays, yes. 
---
Thank you for confirming your pre-existing bias and belief that people or entities cannot improve themselves over time.
---
Are you running mods? They might be interfering with the Operation Report.
---
Wow you need to seriously fix your build. That's not viable at all.
---
Daily. One for daily ops and one for NW
---
There is "Survival Shortcut" as a legendary perk. Take it and you dont need to care about food or water anymore.
---
I'm aware of that. That doesn't mean the info is nonexistent.
---
Wasn't that event broken upon release?
---
The robots weren’t dying for me is that normal?..
---
Oh that as because of this !? lol
---
While I don't doubt your experience I have not seen it yet. I wish people didn't downvote people for something that is easily plausible.
---
Were you not looting bodies?
---
I thought daily ops utilized the contextual ammo system, if so the mobs should be dropping ammo that is appropriate to what you killed them with...
---
And resilient enemies from what I understand you can just bash with your equipped ranged weapon to kill them when they are 1%, you dont need to swap to a melee weapon.
---
Also look into a vampires heavy other than the gatling gun, it will save you some stimpacks for sure. And the ROF keeps you pretty full on health, so vanguards becomes a good option out of PA.
---
Yes, let's blame Bethesda because people are idiots and can't read. People like you are the problem.
---
I even photoshopped the perk a perk screen with a Pick a Coin ui element and they didn't steal my idea.
---
40 minutes of carpal tunnel for some stupid perks
---
Instigating power attacks still kills stuff +
---
They couldve made it a Chocobo:(
---
I don't agree as the nerf was neccesary to keep the balancing in range.Also the game really was too easy overall. But that's my two cents and other opinions are good. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
---
Bye bye.   
---
I mean if someone placed it in your camp you should have moved to get rid of it.
---
the patch notes DID say they will continue to make adjustments to the build types as they get feedback fro the PTS players.. so we will see
---
Did you know that molerats are made to burst out of the game in the opposite direction your going so just walk backwards and they will pop up in front of you for an easy kill.
---
Well, I can tell you that every time I was not online when the reset occurred, I NEVER encountered the autocomplete bug.
---
The one time I was online when it reset, I got the autocomplete bug.
---
There was a post with people compiling data on it, and they showed that people who were not online when the reset occurred, did not encounter the bug. Those who were online could get the bug, ~~not~~ but not everyone.
---
tldr; Don't be online when the daily challenges reset.
---
Again, where? Also you guys can stop being rude.
---
Yeah, i could not be bothered to count that in. In reality you will be able to miss alot more days with the xp and double score weekends!
---
What does it look like?
---
 **Exploit:** Items can no longer be stacked on objects that are in disrepair. 
---
OH NO THE FLAMETHROWER TRICK IS GONE
---
Whoot!
---
As a Texan, what's "snow"?
---
Ah, so you want to be able to doxx people you don’t like!  You want there to be the ability to intimidate someone into silence. How very curious. 
---
That wasn’t a very well veiled threat, by the way.  If you have a problem with what people on the Internet say, there’s an easy solution for that.
---
**By the way, what’s your full name and address?**
---
Thank you for buffing pistol perks and alien blaster! :)
---
You get all the legendary perk cards right away. But you can only unlock so many slots based on level.
---
What is a magic shotgun? Like which effects need to have or mods
---
Sorry, a lot of people moan about having to level up so it's really easy to TL;DR when the title and first sentence makes it sound exactly like one of those moans. And saying 2 instead of 3 was misremembering the level progression.
---
Chill
---
Lol, I'm a grandmother 😂
---
I got hooked on gaming the day I got my first PC 21 years ago!!
---
I had the same thing happen, I was in PA though. Got out and it worked, so maybe not the same problem?
---
Robots have to be melee'd to die, gun bashing counts, check the ops window before joining.
---
modded gatling plasma will never get its projectile fx back, will it :(
---
See I thought about that but then I have never really found anything amazing with terminals or in locked containers.  I am really looking forward to some of the other ones.
---
Cant be an Even, if your Odd.
---
It's because they already have the "pop out of the ground like a mole rat" coding in the game.
---
So because it's Todd "It Just Works^TM" Howard....
---
No it's the weapon itself, even without skin it's invisible
---
So because people don’t read patch notes we can’t read? Instead of being rude just calmly point out Where it states to melee.
---
In reality the number of days you can miss will be a lot higher with the xp and double score weekends. This is just raw data, that i uploaded because i was curios and thought others might be to!
---
You better be kidding!
---
Probably never

Did anything happen to the people with the factories or did they just disappear?

Wondering how long it'll take for fallout 76 to take up the entire 1T of mine lol 2 years and I feel like it's taken up 20% just in patches.
---
I do like looking for a new build, I'll admit. Especially now that we have level 100 mole miners who want my booty.
---
One more thing to try....use an upgraded prosnap camera instead of photo mode.  The upgrade has a zoom that lets you stay back.
---
I had to fully rebuild. I've been running into the same issue for months, and not sure what causes it.
---
Amazing. You all need to buff energy weapons in general next. A laser rifle should be equivalent to .45 or 5.56 rifles. It breaks extremely fast as well.
---
It nerfed high level camp builders.
---
Better to switch to heavy guns and not waste levels swapping cards
---
99% of complaints like these (like the one I'm replying to here) automatically blame Bethesda when it's entirely the complainer's fault. The game very clearly says that you need to melee kill. Idiots don't see that and instead of doing anything rational like, you know, reading the instructions, their first response is 'Bethesda sucks herp derp'. I would call that being rude.
---
Okay I love how this community is immediately on the attack for a simple question. I’m not the only one to experience this. I didn’t see where it said to melee if someone could point that out it would be much appreciated. Everybody calm down we all love the game.
---
I'm on PC. And a I asked a level 500 who came into my camp for help and he did. Thank you for offering though bro.
---
Why is that perk useless?
---
You can still shoot them, then finish with a gun bash
---
They just want to give us the cult of this broken game what we desire xD
---
I am unsure I have not tried stealth yet but ill let you know once I do if I'm having the same issues.  It sounds like you were not in a daily op but in case you didn't know you will be unable to be in stealth for the daily ops but if you are just talking about the normal game I am unsure of what the issue might be
---
I guess that's fair but I mean that's kinda rare isn't it?
---
I'm taking LPs for SPECIALs.. and I don't do enough queens to be swimming in repair kits.. sure as shit ain't buying them..
---
I get what you're saying but junk just got a lot more valuable today...
---
And I can tell you that I was NOT online when I got hit with it. And I can tell you I was playing NW literally during the reset and did not get hit with it. And for every example of someone getting hit with the bug while being online, there is someone who didn't.
---
So, as I said, there is no known cause. There are LIKELY causes, but there is NO KNOWN CAUSE.
---
I disagree, bloodied unarmed isn't a powerhouse anymore. It took TWO hits to kill a tick! The nerve of it!
---
Is it just longer named as being a legendary fixer, or are the effects gone too?
---
Ah indeed, just took the skin off an tried.
---
When you go to the Daily Ops Uplink, it tells you under enemy mutations.
---
The shotgun I use has marksman’s which increases V.A.T.S accuracy by 33%. Doesn’t sound like much, but when you use V.A.T.S it causes all 8 pellets to do 200-500 damage. If you add in concentrated fire you can hit even higher.
---
Two shot is horrible and shouldn’t be used with shotguns. It ruins your accuracy and in turn you will have to barrel stuff enemies to get the effect to work.
---
I find doors tend to glitch and it says something is floating. So I remove them when moving. I haven’t found a fix other then prepping before hand,sorry.
---
Still no fix to the Bog Town discovery bug? I need that bad boy for my free atoms!!!
---
Oh alright thank you.

Feels good man. Now i can have both the Ammo Factory and What rad active at the same time! &lt;3
---
I skipped over 3 weeks of dailies and still finished the last run 3 days early
---
Was this because of an ammo converter someone else placed?
---
My build is exactly the way I want it.  It's not designed to be a powerhouse, cheesed-to-hell, minmaxed, one-hit-kill machine.  It's designed to help people in my party get more XP and better shared cards (since I can share lv 5).  
---
S: 1

---
I'd argue vampire explosive flamer... vampire anything in fact, I just stood hitting robots with my gatling gun and couldn't die. Nor could they but that's fine.
---
I am with you a bit. I am still not at the point where I have ever perk card I want for different builds, so I have settled into an okay allocation, and focused on getting my cards knowing I will soon be able to eventually just use my points to respec occasionally. I do really wish I could just pay legendary scrip or caps to reset the score.
---
This comment or the armor? At this point I’m excited for either
---
That was so annoying, failing for no apparent reason!
---
I haven’t mentioned Bethesda at all. I literally thought it was a big. I’m playing the patch day 1 have waited ours to play and am excited to dig in. I didn’t see at all where it said to melee.
---
Youre allowed to an opinion! All good friendo!
---
TShooters gear just got a lot more valuable today....
---
Nice. Thank you for that.
---
no need to read patch notes, its clearly written 6 lones above the "join" button.  
---
edit: and by lones i mean lines....
---
Pro tip (because I didn’t read carefully): the perk levels just *auto-unlock* certain levels of locks and terminals, but even just one star already gives you +3 to hacking and lock picking by default. I assumed you had to level the card up for that as well but surprisingly not
---
You the same guy that did these poems on bungie forums?
---
the medics flamer 50% vats, 15% faster crit meter would be interesting for a healing flames build if that exists
---
You really wanna grind rep on another character? 🤢
---
Thanks for the info, I did not know that.  I didn't really have time to loot because I was constantly under attack from five directions lol :)  I'll try that next time.
---
Lol.
---
Like the scanner in the Nuke silos. When it gets your genetic data for the access key
---
I didn’t want it, and seemingly nobody else wants to go around throwing grenades. What a waste of time
---
It's one of the first things that's stated when you start the daily ops. I never read the patch notes and the "resilient" modifier was kinda in my face.
---
Thank you. Very clear answer. I admit I skimmed that I thought it would be like a run of the mill event. Very interesting that you have to melee. Sounds fun gonna jump back in.
---
Same. One or two more shots on the high levels for me. No biggie pop a psychobuff and back to one shotting
---
 Not trolling!    
---
 Thank you for explaining it to me! I think I’ve encountered that one, but just figured I clicked out of it or something.
---
So if you equip the rank 3 do you still get the 2 ranks worth added to pistols or does it cancel all benefits of the card?
---
would also like to know this.
---
The Curch of Mr. Pebbles doesn't even get flair.
---
You haven't, no. But the guy above has. As have other people on the reddit, on Twitter, and no doubt in game.
---
Bash them
---
Yeah I just had a play, I'm only level 40 and a pretty casual player.... did a quest and an event and it near wrecked me. Burning through all my ammo and stims and weapons degrading due to all the extra shots...and seemingly not enough extra to make up for all the extra repairing and crafting I'll have to do to cope.
---
I'm sure it's great for people who are in the three digit levels and have some challenge again but it was a decidedly less fun experience for me.
---
Flexing with my elder bonus without even trying. Sounds like you need to not suck buddy.
---
She has tried nine times between public and private.
---
Yeah I had to run key over to house quick and hit update and it’s 33 gb on Xbox my internet isn’t the fastest but it’s 100 down so it should be fine. I got to work another two hours and then do stuff with wife being her birthday is tomorrow and should get some time in tonight. Going to be hard getting off tho at a decent time lol
---
Yeah I saw resilient over their heads but just thought they were stronger robots. Was very confused. Glad I can kill them now.
---
Just had this now, the uplink progress stops completely bug the mobs keep spawning, no way to complete it :(
---
Did you read the original post?
---
Edit:  The OP’s subsequent replies are just as pretty.  Clearly, you’ve misidentified the a-hole.
---
And where do you hear this song?
---
No, they're not part of this season rewards. They'll be in the atom shop along with power armor displays most likely.
---
Only at bench to my knowledge.
---
I need better friends then!
---
Damage equations where changed from being multiplicative to additive instead. This resulted in a lower net damage for all weapons and builds.
---
This is the damage "nerf" everyone has been freaking out over the last month.
---
With 1000 hours into my toon I think I and many others have the right to be upset
---
thank you 4 your updoots
---
Modern renegade has twice the cripple rate aswell.
---
Dude did You just get out from a vault? The Nerf is real and talked about for some time now.
---
yesno
---
I don't think bash dmg is tied to commando perks so I'm not sure that will help
---
I also have basic heavy weapons, just vampire's, and it's fine.  V2515 mg42 and it shreds regular enemies fine
---
Just started, I die quicker and enemies are tuffer. Sux
---
It’s pretty easy
---
He seems to want what I’m already carrying. I can dig it.
---
The armor is going to work with any shotgun in vats and I think any heavy weapons with a fire rate above 200 (I could be wrong about the armor affecting heavies). With the armor, the weapons themselves do not have to have a magic effect. Regardless, the magic heavies definitely do not trigger until the fire rate is close to 200, not 100. So, sadly, no dice on your handmades
---
The servers are back up but there's a update
---
You know, they did use to drop, for real.
---

---
Some commentary here already about this \^
---
Lol I made 59 Ultracite plasma cores with just 8 regular plasma cores, this is amazing
---
Never thought in any game, I'd need to look up if I can or can not do something in game for fear of being banned...🙄
---
If they tell us what we can't do I want a GD book on what I can do...
---
Okay I left out some words but still y’all can understand it I hope 😂
---
Well after experiencing what I thought was a bug I didn’t bother trying to join another daily ops to read the description. I waited hours and out of excitement hit join immediately. Really all a big misunderstanding.
---
Is that a bug?
---
Earlier this morning someone confirmed it was not able to share a higher card. You could take a different legendary special perk card and move the five point from that into your charisma.
---
30 GB for me
---
The gamemode in which you need to just stand around a certain area would be pointless if you could just stay hidden the whole time.
---
Shouldn't cost anything to remove a perk. Completely goes against trying new things out.
---
I meant those weapons are hacked, not a glitch.  So hackers will find a way to get around it.  I still agree with you though that they should go away.  I don't want hacked weapons in the game.
---
Lol, same. I had to two shot a mole rat last night. 
---
And for the past few days, fully-loaded teams failed ACP, Project Paradise, even fking Free Range.... wtf?! If this is a taste of One Wasteland, I already hate it.
---
A genuine case of having to learn to play and get good. I commend your bravery in shining a spotlight on your own inadequacy in such a manner.
---
Solo or group? Current best is 9m 30s solo for myself, trying to figure out how to lower that for sub 8m solo.
---
I just ran it twice, both times in a group, and was still the only one using melee.  It's like people can't read or something. 
---
Also, can anyone explain why my beacon was stuck at bonus X 0 for 15 minutes?
---
Shoot them down to min health and finish with bash. Only kill shot has to be melee.
---
How do you fit 100 in the camp space? It would not fit.
---
They’re telling you to shoot them until their health is 1 and then bash them for the kill...
---
Yeah sure, I agree with that.  It's just that it also isn't that hard to do them quickly.
---
There's no story content, so you'll probably remain bored with it.
---
Yes but it went from op to useless 
---
That’s not balance
---
Probably just use a melee weapon for whatever the OP is
---
If the enemy has the Resilient Mutation they can only be killed with a melee attack.
---
Nah, got a link?
---
You’re right in that your camp can’t be built the same way again because of the ammunition factory restriction.  The rest can be rebuilt.
---
You accepted the ammunition factory, when you could have been rid of it sooner.
---
Exploit is an exploit. If you dupe and hack in a private server and never interact with anyone, you still get banned. Just because it doesn't affect anyone and it's 'cosmetic' doesn't mean you are not an exploiter
---
Had that. Turned the game off and on again, that fixed it for me.
---
Waiting to log in!!
---
Here’s some stuff in the meantime https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itehcd/sooooone_wasteland/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
No, you could shift 'real' special points from another stat to charisma and fill the special you removed them from with a legendary card though.
---
So from what I can see bloody has been nerfed. Specially melee. The Damage output of my partners Deathclaw Gauntlet +1Strength went From 2155 to 350ish. My bloodied 50. Build doesn’t seem to be too effected although enemies have definitely been scaled up and I got downed by a molerat. Does this now mean he has to utilise the new system and rebuild for long range with new cards? Is that the point of this nerf? It hardly seems fair for his playstyle
---
Maybe in 3 years
---
The Silo run is far easy...
---
This. Takes away any challenge. Time for you to find a team.
---
Do more queens then.  Get an alt or friend to get ammo factory.
---
Melee to death...
---
scrap what you didnt use in 5 play sessions for a start, play the game and see if you want to adjust your build to the new environment. then you can still scrap the rest.
---
Wait I didn't hear, what happened
---
Only at the bench. It does work with other perk card that boosts ammo production and gets some pretty high quantities.
---
Yes, you are missing the part where you have to melee them to kill them. Kind of an important detail.
---
You need to melee them to finish them off its a mutation
---
Oh so you can dmg them, just can't kill them, btw are all ops melee focused or are there any ranged ones
---
GL, its faster as a team. More people standing on an uplink the faster it goes.
---
It's not grindy, but expensive. At least if you want a better home than a wooden house, you'll need to find and/or buy the plans from vendors in train stations, the Whitespring or other assorted ones like the Responder bot in the Flatwoods church. For caps, of course. Materials aren't rare and can be found pretty much everywhere if you know where to look, the limiting factor for me is mostly concrete because I have too damn many foundations.
---
I would suggest claiming workshops and completing Defend events, they reward CAMP object plans - even expensive ones like the Small Letters. And don't focus on great CAMP builds yet, do some leveling and questing and it'll come naturally sooner or later.
---
That reminds me, I need to go hunting to restock nuke cards for my vendor.
---
I was...pleasantly surprised...to see how well they sell when I started doing it.
---
Right? How the hell is that not a thing?
---
Read. Gotta melee to finish them.
---
You don't have to neccesarily.  Plenty of good things without rep
---
R91 model is in the files and it's labeled as a handmade skin, so maybe it will come one day
---
You realize, you posted this the day a patch was released deleting exploited camps and items, right?
---
So everyone saying you exploited.... Are all within reason.
---
Glad you figured it out but ... Your timing and misunderstanding caused the drama, not them being dramatic and insane.
---
UPDATE - and now I am getting dm'd by OP, lol.
---
2nd UPDATE: more dm's. Threats. Name calling. Childish behavior. Apparently there's a comms ban on posting publicly for him? Good.
---
I responded to his dm and claims I waited an hour to respond and got mad I waited so long?!?! Lmao.
---
Seems OP is just a toxic person now. We made him toxic, I guess 🤷
---
Apparently I "snitched" on him by saying "my camp is still here. What else did you have". How is that a snitch? Lmao. Kid is delusional.
---
http://imgur.com/a/SM7Gx0v
---
3rd UPDATE: The hilarious part? He's upset for being called a cheater/exploiter... and now we have it in writing that he's rebuilding his camp using said cheats/exploits.
---
Wow, way to negate everything you said here and in DM's OP. (BTW, anyone wanna tell OP that stacking exploit is supposedly fixed I'm today's patch too... And could result in the camp being deleted AGAIN)
---
And who called for him to be banned as he claims in my DM's? I don't see any calls for that.
---
This is honest truth: an incredibly generous high level gave me his tickets to turn in so I could get the shotgun. I didn’t get it. 
---
**76 god damn tickets** and I didn’t get it.
---
Should have studied Reddit before playing. I traded in two magic weapons for script
---
Thank you
---
Did you not read the quest description? It tells you what buff the enemies have. You had one where enemies can’t be killed unless the final fatal damage is melee.
---
It was 31GB for me on PS4 mate
---
Breathe lol it’s okay.
---
WTF?  Bad?? really?? Because I'm annoyed that I as a range based character have to use melee for the final blow???  How does that make ME bad, when it's 100% a design choice to Force guns not being able to work.    If I knew it was melee only I would have build according, but without Perk Loadouts in place yet, I'm not going to constantly swap cards ... that's not fun, or HARD, it's just stupid.
---
Mama Mole rats started taking steroids and you dun got nerfed. 
---
One wasteland mechanic makes mole rats higher level and thus stronger and Bethesda changes damage formulas which decreases your damage.
---
Yup.  Not one shoting for me because I use heavy guns, but same effect
---
I sincerely truly despise anyone working for bethesda game studios at this point. Absolute joke concerning the recent bug patchs/fixs.
---
Slap it till it's dead.
---
From Pistol builds:  \[NONE LOCATED\] :)
---
They got the feedback from the PTS and they didn't change it yet.
---
No. Enemies can have all kinds of mutations when I did it on the PTS. Invisibility was one of them. Some freeze you, some explode of death and can hurt you.
---
exactly.
---
I was initially put off by this too, but it makes sense for these Daily Ops. If stealth wasn’t nullified, we’d literally be able to just crouch through the entire thing,  pop off a boss and be done. I can see why they’d want to avoid that. Honestly, once you’ve done them a few times and learn where all the checkpoints are, you’ll be able to solo in under 8 minutes without stealth. 
---
Hopefully the future missions they add will be more varied. They say Uplink is the first of many to come.
---
These posts do nothing for my faith in humanity.
---
Bring on the asteroid!
---
I only enjoyed PVP and all the cheating made me quit.
---
They can only be killed by a melee attack. Before starting the daily op it says this under "Enemy Mutations". Also they will have enhanced perception of players.
---
Is it a thing that does stuff ?
---
They will be in atom store. Those things will bring in tons of cash.
---
It doesn't remove rads.
---
is that instead of players, or as well as?
---
Oooo.
---
RIP line in the sand :(
---
Yes. The game is a game now. Those of us who have thought out builds have a challenge. I would assume the game might be a little too hard for those who haven’t strategically lined their perk cards up.
---
\*laughs in One Gun Army\*
---
Finally, that flappy bitch is going to ***SUFFER***!
---
tse fixer?
---
big if true
---
Hopefully not too expensive
---
A lock is a lock.
---
It’s unfortunate that it isn’t made more obvious that the player’s item is locked, though.
---
I always loved going gunslinger in the other fallouts. Also had a lot of fun tweaking my build from a low damage dealer to a heavy hitter. I am a semi auto user. I mostly enjoy using my bloodied 50% crit Wester revolver, it hits things pretty hard
---
It was 31gb for me on Xbox :)
---
I’ve been bugged out of finishing an ounce of prevention and I’m about to hop on and try before my kids come back home, will let you all know what’s up with the whole blood sample diffuser and if they fixed it, I’ve been trying to finish this quest for over a week.
---
More than happy to help you along the way. I sent you one already.
---
Sorting by new and scrolling through posts made ever since the patch dropped, counts, right? I just used that phrase out of courtesy :)
---
From yourself aswell
---
Are the shotguns rare? I had 4, been playing since wastelanders update. Its the revolver I been after and never got out of 60 or so tickets. Mostly get a shotgun or cowboy with chaps
---
Hence the quotes
---
I’m in EST, but I should be able to depending on when we do it. PSN is WorkablePuffin.
---
All sources.  Enemy has to stay aggrod on you or it n looses effect after about 10 sec according to angry turtles video.
---
He had multi floor building filled with ammo factories
---
Yep, like me.
---
Oh yea!!!!
---
For the first time ever, I died from fucking mole rats today
---
One more question related, i finished in 9 minutes with my team and there was no reward. It simply teleported me out of the Burrows and that was it. Did i do something wrong?
---
I am buying it. It's all about the science of immersion!
---
Are you saying they were not sincere about the great camps builds? Once again cant destroy my camp as its not rebuildable as is. Heres a shelf you cant put anything on it but enjoy.
---
Ah I see
---
16x the detail and all that
---
Yess yes thank you my gods i luv u (no homo)
---
It was $80 CAD, typical triple-A price, on release. Same thing in the US, $60 USD typical price for a triple-A game. 
---
The fact that they quickly (not on release) dropped the price doesn't mean much in that context, other than pissing off people who paid the full price on launch or through pre-order.
---
What quest was it?
---
Also, good raider skin for the handmade has it so the glass of the scope is painted gold, even though that would make using the scope useless
---
No, they act like floater grenades or ss armor.
---
He ran off to start the Steel Dawn questline. You have to find him!
---
Do you just have to be on a team or do teammates have to be close to you?
---
God bless your soul.
---
You got your wish.
---
Go to watoga! A side quest will start 🌟
---
This I so helpful and already did what top guy suggested, gave u medal as well m8 u deserve it!!
---
Nope, those items are character bound
---
Nothing's really changed. You'll need a build to be more optimal now, and even then things are bullet-sponge. Like, it's good to not one-shot stuff. But unless you've good legendary rolls on weapons, you'll have a far more difficult time. Avoid scourchbeasts and shit without that, etc.
---
why am i being downvoted, please explain why if you're gonna do that. they're asking a question, so help them out lol
---
It needed to be nerfed because y’all were taking advantage of the fact that your little sister fister (yes, I call power fists sister fisters) takes advantage from two perk sets at the same time it’s either an unarmed, or a one-hand. Plus, y’all got a jillion chems to help you witch no one else has. And if you think other build don’t have high risk, look at bloodied heavy builds. 1. They don’t have stealth so everything is trying to attack them and they can’t just crouch spam. And 2. They have to R-E-L-O-A-D, making them vulnerable and it doesn’t help that their fusion core can run out making them sitting metal ducks with no health.
---
Right there with you
---
Now, I know about the mutations on enemies from the pts patch notes and how they work, but is there something in game on the ops that explains how the resilient mutation works?
---
Note: I have not had a chance to play an op yet.
---
Have to melee them to finish them off. Says it in the mission description.
---
New daily ops are causing aound glitches when using headphones. And the game freezes while in the ops. No sir. I'm avoiding it like the plague.
---
I believe it's a legendary modifier that requires the finishing hit to be a melee attack.
---
Today’s Burrows/Robot/Resilient combo is one of the hardest combos, because of layout, assaultron boss and Resilient.  I think only V94 would be tougher.
---
Joined a team and got 5:45 on the first try.
---
If you know the dungeon layout and someone obviously doesn’t, the Follow Me emote helps.
---
If I shoot them for long enough maybe the enemies will have heart attacks from laughing at me too hard!
---
Weapons are useless that it took players 2 years to trade for. None of the perfected builds that we have all built are usless b2525 fixer last night hit the queen for over 1000. Today's test almost 200. The damage buff ruined the game.
---
Clearly you cant read...
---
Resilient enemies need to be finished with melee weapons
---
Curses... I just hope you don’t get the same plans over and over again
---
Apparently unarmed melees were doing less damage than other types of melees during the PTS. Guess how they fixed that...
---
They nerfed all other types of melees.
---
That is exactly what I thought they were doing. Guess they forgot?
---
Thanks 👍🏻! I should've figured but I thought switching worlds would have done it.
---
People don't even read this days
---
It is literally right there what do you mean
---
lol
---
Thats still not a very good reason to remove them from the game. I bet somebody is sad becuase they took them out
---
I'm loving it... :-)
---
God please give our community the ability to read amen
---
Edit : this is my exact problem with reddit , guy has thousands of karma yet is a moron yet we still consider high karma players gods 
---
:(
---
No. You will never use them. I pre ordered tricentennial. Only skin I use is 10mm.
---
Can confirm unfortunately that after crafting it still doesn’t show for jack o lantern skin
---
Yet my camps that are merge heavy still appear just fine. No changes to existing camps again.
---
Someone in the other post said rank 3 doesnt apply to pistols. Can anyone confirm this?
---
If so is it a visual bug? Or is it not actually applying?
---
At least it’ll be easier to get your ammo back with the new perk.
---
And the key card should be easy.
---
Not really
---
I have all 5. 
---
Level 134, 98, 94, 54, and 8.
---
Just made my last one, but I wanted different builds and didn't want to have to respec things all the time. You might find a build you enjoy more than your original one.. because that's what happened to me.
---
Up to you though.. I made all of them except two of them and my first during bonus XP weekends to make it a bit quicker.
---
For what it's worth at level 40 I completely agree. I popped on and did a quest and an event and it tore through my ammo and stims. Once those reserves run out it's going to make it a real slog as I won't be able to afford running into many enemies to get supplies or ill just end up using more ammo than the supplies let me replace.
---
*Your, lol this is the first time I’ve seen someone get the spelling on this way, usually people spell you’re as your. 
---
No offense, it’s a common mistake, I just thought it was funny.
---
&gt;**Communist Bunker:** The interior walls of the Communist Bunker are now hexagonal rather than cylindrical to help players more easily place wall décor.
---
Great, but now all my magazine racks and other displays are partially or completely trapped inside the hexagonal walls.
---
Sent you one. I also have no problems running it with you later in the evenings.
---
It's the same as any other console in the game.
---
You can gun bash them to kill once they are down to the sliver of health. Resilient enemies must be melee hit to be killed. Active camouflaged enemies will be invisible until (and often during) attacking you. Freezing enemies will use a freeze attack on you to slow you down. I can’t remember the name of the other mutation, but it makes enemies explode on death- hurting players nearby. These mutations rotate daily and are given when you look at that day’s daily op description. As stated above, the mutation that always appears is penetrating gaze (?) which means you can’t use stealth.  Enjoy.
---
He knew having the ammunition factory was wrong.  He could have prevented this situation.
---
Is this build type still plenty strong? Was considering making a change to Heavy weapons too as Ive got a couple of strong weapon rolls on heavies I want to use as well and it wouldn’t require me to waste away perk points like you said.
---
Can we get this "exploit" back as it's own event? Set up a stage with robots playing music and have the Scorched mosh pit spawn in front of it. I enjoyed seeing how far we could fling Scorched with a well thrown explosive. No real unfair advantages to it, just a ton of scrap, loot and XP.
---
I started that quest, and got up to the point where you have to go run an op before I had to quit for the moment. Does he show up during that?
---
I have 3 toons..
---
a rifleman and a commando for public servers.. and the third is for the PTS.. it's set up to flip flop back and forth between rifleman/commando so I can test for both my real builds
---
There's a bug alright. Just not with the game.
---
“It just works!” LMAO!! ❤️
---
Bruh
---
Depends on if you have a semi-auto or fully auto mod on it.
---
Yep it was horrible during Earle fights, I was running at a solid 0 FPS
---
It punches me and I die
---
I’m having no problem.  We’ve killed Earle a handful of times and queen and we’ve run the daily ops and got I think it was around 7 mins
---
It's the same type of menu system in every other computer.
---
It's not about the speed, it's the functionality.
---
My bloodied 2h melee build got SMACKED lol. I'm not sure what direction I'm going to take it as it's my only character.
---
My melee build can still 1 hit level 50 ghouls like it used to.
---
Awesome glad you got some back at least
---
I got 3 diff characters. Story again, another built, more knowledge for other choices, and it's fun. And they can help each other. And u can be selective.
---
I just run the 1, other than getting the other trophy from faction siding there's no logical reason for a 2nd.
---
I do appreciate that it's not just a cake walk type of mission.
---
I've only done to daily ops though.
---
Yes, they nurffed mine too
---
I mean, I have all the best weapons and am bloodied and junkies. Honestly me soloing the queen and earl in a couple minutes wasn’t really challenging. So I welcome the challenge and it will give me more incentive to find ways to beat the endgame.
---
Definitely no. The only thing I use from that is the power armor paint. And I don’t even use power armor any more. It’s just sitting in my stash collecting dust until the displays are added.
---
Eat shit
---
Just try a new build, if you like the game your just gonna have to adapt
---
I've been a bloody build the whole time now I'm on my 4th character whos vanguard sent, but I have yet to see if he's still good with the new update 
---
I was pretty bummed about the tse nerf back in the day because I literally got my first tse handmade at lvl 50 and started leveling up and they nerfed it literally days after I got it.
---
Probably not until next patch. There is a small quest in watoga though.
---
I'm not noticing the nerf at all. But my level 388 char is leveling so much faster. Am loving this one wasteland thing
---
I'm sure a yes would have worked just fine karen.
---
No it wasnt that there's a difference between what happened to me and mutation the assualtron was not there at all not invisible just wasn't there and you couldn't shoot it or anything and it would teleport out of no where every time I spawned
---
You can sneak up on most of them yes, I use a *instigating puncturing power fist and I was able to one hit things, not usually robots though. And so far nothing today.
---
Nope, seems like there would have been something said about that beforehand. But between the patch notes and the newsletters, there wasn't anything mentioned about a new questline. 
---
That should have been a pretty big clue there wasn't going to be a new questline added. But here we are.
---
Well shit
---
Ive no problem with the idea behind it. But they've gone too far. I'd gladly accept a middle ground.
---
What am I looking at here?
---
My newest character.. I redeemed lots of the lunchboxes from the legendary run with him, so anytime I play I pop them to get up to double XP, and always stay well rested.
---
I have another one of my characters make a bunch of cranberry relish and give it to him as well.
---
What do you mean with that? Sry if Im stupid, you mean other cards better?
---
Yikes. Ur almost making it seem like its working as intended.
---
Does it just start if you head to watoga or do you need to speak to someone?
---
But I like when it goes pew pew
---
Ah shit.
---
What about placing power armor chassis’s down at spawn points?
---
No it’s not worth
---
Then why the fuck does BGS keep giving me cursed shotguns?
---
So it's performing exactly as expected? How is that "broken?"
---
I just finished the challenge in 9 minutes with a team but there were no rewards displayed. Did i do something wrong? Where can i check the rewards?
---
you should get in touch with bethesda and tell them
---
Extremely.
---
move your CAMP.
---
It's 21:12 where i am and my download has still like 3 hour left. I will play tomorrow.
---
THE SUBJUGATOR WINS THIS DAY YANKEES.
---
Suddenly that 40% more bash damage perk isn’t so bad
---
As well as
---
true but they're still in the game. I have one. Vamp is definitely the way to go, esp on this one where you can't kill at range. It procs health regen even if hitting them for 0 damage as they have no health left.
---
That’s the current mutation. The whole point is they have to be killed with melee.
---
I also used the laser rifle skin, but there are other skin options for lasers now.
---
We knew about stealth not being a thing in Ops for the longest times. Also, look at the mutations next time.
---
Honestly, any cosmetics you get from these overpriced packs will mostly likely be replaced by atom shop stuff or event rewards pretty quickly.
---
Joined someone else who was on the 2nd uplink in the Burroughs died twice swarmed by robots but got the hang of it.. it’s a good challenge and my trouble shooters powerfist paid its way.
---
Yeah man i run heavy guns with uny armor and love it.
---
No. Ive got it to rank 5 and tried to equip tier 3 perks (it says ive got 9 chr) but can't. Turns out I should read stuff that's not on the game to know these things in advance.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
No you guys aren't understanding you couldnt see it it wasnt invisible it was completely gone but I would die to it randomly when I was battling other bots while I knew there wasnt anything behind me so yes it was a glitch you remember the invisible invincible enemy bug from along time ago it was that
---
No direct punishment but today's patch made it so if you had one your camp couldn't be placed and had to be rebuilt, or somethjng like that.
---
What on earth do you mean enemies had high health/armour. The most difficult enemies in the game took a few rounds at most and being able to solo end game bosses in a matter of minutes without cheating or using magic weapons was way to easy. If you were finding things balanced before I suspect you need to work on your perk set up a little because honestly even after the nerf it’s still a very easy game. And yes the piercing gaze is going to make your stealth build useless. That’s there to promote team play and make other builds more viable. But even then you just get them close to death and bash them.
---
You could have moved your camp earlier.  Instead, you let it sit there until you’re now forced to move.
---
I don’t understand how my gauss shotgun won’t kill the robots in the daily op I put out crazy damage with that thing so I tried my 3* fixer nope my other 3* fixer nope ok I try my legacy 3* exploding laser rifle nope their at 0 for their life meter but still attacking the only thing that worked was a melee weapon but by then I had no more stims to keep me going
---
The "resilient" mod was the first thing I noticed...and I realized I was in for a shitshow lol
---
My character isn't at all spec'ed for melee but I decided to wing it all the same
---
edit: I'm surprised by how many people are posting about the "resilient" mod as a bug when they're just not reading
---
Remember hivemind here good, glitching that doesn't hurt anyone bad...  
---
I personally didn't see an issue if people only had one or two or did them in private worlds. I get it why people were not liking the guys that ran like 10+ as they probably hurt the servers. But one or two? Nah not bad.
---
You can get their HP to 1 with guns than you just gun bash or melee them.
---
You know "Two-Shot Explosive" it used to tell you what it was. Like "Two Shot The Fixer" now it reverted back to just "The Fixer" and you have to look at what it is. Figured I'd save some people the "where did it go?" Moment
---
Fuck that, I don't want the game dumbed down so the lowest common denominator is able to function. Make it even more complex and weed those dolts out.
---
it feels like this was an update for the players who are 100+ and have the best gear already. For everyone else this is just ridiculous. I really hope bethesda makes changes to this its seriously making me want to stop playing ive already went through 25 stimpaks I'm all out and that's jusy from one event I used to be able to pull of no problem
---
What u mean?
---
I dabble with an alt that is going with a different build and different choices.  And with a new theme all the way around in camp design, decor and outfits.
---
But I can see the danger of losing focus from your main and what that might mean.   I did it because I was just doing dailies,  My camp was the way I wanted it, all the story line quests were done  so other than grinding for experience there wasn't a lot to do with my main after I knocked out the daily stuff, maxed my caps and got my script and gold for the day.
---
Now with Patch 22 it seems that I will busy for a while but once I get caught up I can slip back to mucking with my alt if I want and have other things to do.  Some of them might be things I have already done but maybe I can do them a little different this time around.
---
I run T-65 PA with leg carry weight mods and I only use my [50.cal](https://50.cal) TSE and my build is as much damage for heavy weapons then Qol stuff after that,I never use buffs as I always forget to eat them, nothing special going on here, maybe PA is coming in to its own as all the mobs only got me down to 75% hp
---
I get why people do it, but I hate it. It's so disappointing.
---
Actually yes if this doesnt get fixed i will link you my gameflip. Time is money. So if wanna keep supporting this dumpster fire and your money is green its all yours.
---
Man that sounds just like the exact description of that op in the event instructions. What horseshit.
---
THIS IS AMAZING NEWS YAY!
---
Well we will have to wait and see, someone will probably buy the whole thing day one so
---
Did you have a munition factory?
---
Take One for the Team does not work while undetected and Follow Through only works with ranged weapons. I believe exploding palm does not deal damage based on the weapon's damage, so it is not very good. Not only were melees hit the hardest, but many of the best legendary perks don't even work with them.
---
I currently have 4 characters.
---
My main, Big Red, is really the only I play on. The others are named 
---
The Collector (he holds all of the unique weapons, items and armor I pick up, along with God rolls I don't really want to trade and stuff like comics and bobbleheads)
---
The Trader (she holds legendary gear with a value higher then most, strictly for my trading list, along with event cosmetics and plans of value)
---
The Mule (he holds all of the legendaries that are only worth scripping. At the end of my play session, all of the junk legendaries I've picked up go into his inventory
---
The Newcomer (not a character, but an empty slot that gets deleted every day for the level up SCORE challenge
---
i was talking about the in game bosses most other things still fell easily
---
He was planning on keeping our 200 million cork all along!  He was playing the long con!
---
I didn't personally find it that bad. The only time this comes into play is at the end when you have to kill enemies. If you spec correctly you shouldn't take much damage waiting for the uplink. I ran PA with electric absorbtion healing off the energy blasts and had no issue. Swapped to my JE gat plas for the last few enemies, shot to 1 health and bashed. Not even that hard tbh..
---
Luckily I (and presumably many players) don't find enjoyment in instakilling everything
---
Change build
---
wait - you mean that the enemies you are required to use a melee attack to kill only died from a melee attack? WHOA.
---
Why do people call legendary weapons "magic" i think Bethesda should know about this so they can call it the "magical run" instead of the legendary run.
---
Don't try to exploit stuff. You shouldn't be underground so bethesda didn't think about players loosing loot under their
---
Had my first issue with this this weekend. When I was going into power armor before mine collapsed my power was pixelated
---
Lol ok sure
---
And the pass-through power conduit no longer seems to be able to pass through.
---
What are you shooting?
---
The only playtime the others get is to get them to level 50 so I can utilize them for the Purveyor
---
What!?
---
True, but not helping
---
Stealth is basically impossible in Uplink.  That's what Piercing Gaze really means.  It's intentional and specific to that quest.
---
Why is the update so big filesize wise? A ridiculously big game has just gotten bigger for no reason
---
Get a group.
---
Yeah, that's all I meant.  I think there are better choices.
---
Shut up, moron.
---
You clearly can’t read.
---
Did you read daily ops tab?
---
Nope. I pressed Esc after mission completed and it teleported me outside. Guess i'll have to look for rewards manually or you have to unlock them ? Are they automatically added to your inventory?
---
What are some of your guy’s heavy builds running?
---
I’m going with just five right now till I figure out my cards.
---
Ammo, PA revive, Energy hits on fusion core, Luck , and Agility right now.
---
Yes piercing gaze will always be there (possible a different permeate mutation with future ops goals)
---
The second one changes daily
---
Welcome to playing a MMO, guess now you can't cheese the game anymore; cheers!
---
If your on PS4, I'll trade the mask for the outfit
---
Yep it’s still an easy game. Also seldom have problems completing the other mentioned events as long as a single one of my friends is around so..... 🤷‍♀️
---
2018675309 lol
---
We believe you 😉😉
---
Thanks, just came back to the game
---
No Deathclaws are worthy in FO76. Shots to the belly are just too much for these tiny lizards. Not like the dangerous beasts they once were.
---
i got the screen blur earlier as well and as a sneak bloodied rifleman the burrows hurt my soul
---
Edit: dont know why i was downvoted i know how the daily ops work was just talking about a visual glitch that probably had to do with me being at low health for bloodied
---
If you're intentionally doubling the Unyielding effect, you *are* a cheater.
---
A 5/5 Unyielding set boosts all SPECIAL except END by +15 each at low health.  Not a single point more.
---
Yeah insane I have to use my shotgun get them down to 0 if I keep shooting them it doesn’t mater they don’t die until I tried my power fist then I tried a sledgehammer they worked crazy I have to switch my shit around to be stronger in melee to do this and wear troubleshooters armor
---
I read it, but in a team of 4 ranged (3 rifles - 2 obvious bloodied, some other build, and a myself, a shotgun build) we were able to whittle them down to barely any health and bash did nothing to them as a finisher. I was unable to melee them. I don't know if that was the wrong approach or not, but I did read the directions and it simply did not work for me. Maybe I'm an outlier and I did something wrong, maybe it worked as intended. Either way, I played the game to have fun. So far, it was a frustration and not fun. I get enough of those in my day to day. 
---
I'm not saying that people are not paying attention, just that I did pay attention and still had a bad experience.
---
I cant care less about punji and trappers. All i care is merging using the destroy function.
---
I haven’t been able to try out the new update yet. But I want to say because of the the new way enemies scale the damage resistance went up and maybe that’s why?
---
Privates servers are meh, better to play with people, what is worth about Fallout 1st, is the scrapbox, and tent, and the montly income of 1620 atoms. (Also the ranger and cosmetics stuff)
---
I’ve scrapped so many fixers at the legendary exchange because of this bug😭
---
Legit question.... How do you get a group in the event?
---
Read
---
Better equip fireproof then
---
You could do that with the xp challenge.  And I'm sure they're going to have weekend specials.  I don't think it's that bad.
---
Excelent! I was just wondering yesterday "Only if I could use those useless perk cards for something..."  
---
It is also kind of bad to have to scroll more than needed to find a perk card you want because of those you wish didn't existed.
---
Ninjas and Covert Operatives will need to learn to adapt their build for upfront combat/survivability.
---
Vats users may also need to adapt during the mutation that makes everything invisible.
---
Ranged users will need to adapt during the melee kill mutation.
---
Daily ops will be much easier with a group.
---
Not really true. My Instigating DCG with 40%PAdamage was dropped from 300 to 230 dmg (full health stealth unarmed build) in pipboy but now I am unable to one PA kill yao guai from sneak. Before the patch same attack was enough for legendary SBs and sheeps.
---
Right, I enjoy more of a challenge. I remember back in Skyrim, the game was mostly dead to me until the “legendary” difficulty came out and revived the game. This is much along the same lines to me, and so far I’m liking the fact that I don’t pop every enemy I come across into a bloody mess with one shot every time I set eyes on something.
---
Edit: oh no it might take 2-3 shots now, still more realistic than one-shorting everything.
---
Find a group willing to help hou out. I'm sure there are plenty. All in all the community is helpful.
---
has the hardended reciever? i can change it to a powerful automatic reciever but idk.
---
Umm, you might want to look again, my dude.
---
Why do people give a hoot if other players use these
---
THAT GUYS GOT MORE AMMO THAN ME AND IT ISN'T FAIR &gt;:c
---
I haven't done this because I was worried when it was patched it would wreck my camp in some way, but I don't care if you are using one, it's your own risk that doesn't effect me in any way
---
Exactly what im saying.
---
Heavies were the least affected by the Nerf as far as I'm aware
---
It wasn't for me, I'm not exactly a full bloodied build or junkie...
---
Still time gated.  Doesn’t take long to get plans you need.  Takes an age to get them all.
---
I agree there. Planning ahead of time of course is pretty important, like even a squad set-up. Having just 1 super tanky person running around with a rolling pin could've worked pretty well.
---
Ya but if you’re complaining about something you support with your money it just comes off as...I dunno, I’m not sure I have the words for it.
---
They'll be fine. Essentially printing money that they get to keep.
---
not mentioning it in the three blog articles that existed isnt a confirmation that it wasnt coming today, and thats why op *asked*. i just dont get the bad attittude. it wasnt a dumb question at all.
---
Missing texture on the side of the pelvic area, once you notice it you will never be able to unsee it.
---
Thanks, good guide!
---
So, I tried this solo in my melee setup.. and it was REALLY hard. I died like 10 times, most of my armor broke, and the end boss I ended up forcing into a corner and just chipping his health away while he sat there looking at me... I hope it's easier with a team?
---
Yeah no kidding. A little teamwork goes a long way
---
A couple team members on auto rifles knocking the health down and a couple on melee to finish them off. Chop them mobs down.
---
what plans would have taken months?
---
Chanage perks to survive mode and you will be fine i have no problem with my Blodied commando...
---
How long are these rewards available for?
---
I have 5 characters and cycle through them.  I get bored playing 1 build all the time, and being able to switch keeps me engaged.  
---
I have a heavy weapon power armor character, a pistol character, a rifle sniper character, a bloodied commando character, and a melee character.  With the new legendary perk system, it seems even more advantageous not to swap builds on a single character.
---
This is just a guess, and likely the games size is not increasing significantly, it just needs that much scratch space to store the new files temporarily. Most of the games data files (audio/textures/etc) are just fancy zipped files called archives. When patches are large, I imagine its easier to include the new archives rather than providing just the updated files, unzipping them, updating what needs to be updated, and then re-zipping them all on the machine you are using.
---
Yes, it’s changed.
---
You just missed all those months you could have grinded.
---
Yes, i skipped it but is it automatically added to my inventory then?
---
nope me too this update is horrible
---
U do realise its on utube and a bethesda dev couldve accidently stumbled on it.
---
I'll trade but I dont have much interest in the helmet, also won't be online til late tonight
---
Sounds like the game is just a tiny bit harder and your crying.
---
No,also me
---
What build are you lol?
---
Most Fallout fans care about PvE and single player aspects so they don't want BGS to put time or resources into NW. Also the game mode was never really advertised, so the PvP community on 76 is extremely small.
---
Something like this? https://m.imgur.com/a/HWmxjgn
---
I agree just it was so over-kill for me and my friend but overall intriguing!
---
They're in there
---
I tried it, it's A LOT better. Thanks man!
---
Just swing wildly until you connect with something.
---
good. being able to one shot everything is only fun for awhile. i like my games to not be braindead easy.
---
Which ended up me just camping around corners because I couldn't get near them and swapping to a melee just took too long haha
---
Whats cheesing? Trading for the best guns and armor to deal the most damage? Thats what i did so its just a slap in the face to og players that put in all the time.
---
Yikes!   Thanks for the reality check 👍
---
I didn't say it was a dumb question. I answered the question, and OP wanted to have a debate. OP got one. The attitude was a bonus.
---
git gud!111!
---
They have been in for a few weeks
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Ants? They were pretty tough even at level 30. Once or twice I saw them take out the deathclaw in the power plant NW of Watoga
---
Dude just shoot the bastard, run up to it and bash it. Don't be dense
---
You can just move the CAMP L item rather than the camp itself and it should change the spawn in point
---
cya
---
I'm just going to skip this daily ops. My stealth commando gets obliterated within seconds.
---
Maybe start with Valley Galleria.
---
Whats your point?
---
Nope, I tried solo and burnt through all my Stims. Died a ton trying to beat the final boss, then as he had about 20% health left a Daily Ops team request popped up, and I joined it and that kicked me out
---
Someone clearly couldn't read. Lmao
---
Full power armor with mods and the shotgun which i never even started the rep grind for.
---
I got 3 pieces of armor, no mods, and the minigun. All thst total took me like a month and i just couldnt do it anymore
---
Yeah then we should go to their houses and burn them down and kill them how DARE THEY GET FREE AMMO AND NOT HAVE TO GRIND RAIDER DAILEYS TO GET THE LEGIT AMMO MACHINE LIKE ME &gt;:c
---
why do you even care dude chill
---
Just curious about why do i have to get a certain build so i can do something that is *daily ?*
---
Sounds like you build and gear need some fine tuning. I am having no issue and am absolutely loving this update
---
What has changed?
---
use PA
---
Honestly I feel too sad for shotgun runners I don't care if they get some help 🤷‍♂️
---
The nerf is no where near as bad as people are making it out to be, its just a load of bloodied builds complaining that they can't one shot everything they see anymore. The new daily ops are fun and with steel dawn coming out soon its a good time to get back in.
---
*Cries in having only one The Fixer*
---
beat me to it
---
wow, that's crazy! I can't believe you couldn't kill them with a shotgun even though the game literally tells you that you can't!
---
No because pvp is disabled during pve events like scorched earth
---
The daily ops was added today.
---
I can’t wait to place it in my camp
---
Yeah i fking understood but why?
---
Before today it took me under 5 minutes to solo earl and less for the queen. That’s with just a fixer small guns bobble pshychotats and soup no exploits or any of that. I’m not trying to do a weird flex as it was common to be able to do faster than myself. Compared to any other online rpg sort of game this one was super easy. People who didn’t focus on their builds are going to have a rough time but that’s how rpg mechanics should work.
---
Legendary perks are for experienced veterans.
---
It's called content. Haven't you been used to it by  now?
---
I wish the budget was a little bigger, there's pre made in game structures with tons of stuff everywhere and it doesn't cause any lag so I think they could bump it just a bit. I have a hard time with my builds sometimes because of that - as long as it doesn't cause lag I think it would be ok. Cause I wanna buy atom store stuff but I can't budget to even fit all of the stuff so there's no point to buy so much :/ I've dropped over $200 on cosmetics lmao
---
oh yeah none of that has changed.
---
I'm gonna get so swole, bruh.
---
The only monetization this game needs is the base price it sold with. They literally spend all of their budget on atomic shop items to the point that it actually degrades the quality of new content. It's foolish to look at how rough and unfinished this game is and say "this is definitely the best it can be". I literally checked out the new Score board today and the very last item you can unlock wasn't even showing up for me. Just empty boxes. Not to mention that while I was doing a daily op my character would just stagger around for no reason, almost like he got hit by something despite the fact that there were no enemies around. This game doesn't need gimmicks to attract more players, what they need is to spend the time to optimize and refine the content they already have, because no way in hell has bethesda done a satisfactory job with this game as a whole. The concept of forcing players to play so actively is just detrimental to the player's experience as a whole. While it is nice that they made it more accessible for more players, it's also kind of unreasonable that they're encouraging us to go around and do arbitrary tasks for atomic shop items rather than actually adding new and substantial content to the game.
---
Unarmed does take advantage of those perks anymore that was fixed at the start of wastelanders and the dmg the unarmed weapons are at make them useless when bloodied is supposed to be high risk high reward and now it’s high risk mediocre reward
---
Seems mostly whinning withuot any actual suggestion or context.
---
You grabbed a super sledge on a rifleman build and expected to do good?
---
I've seen with my own eyes and the nerf is not that heavy. I cant say about bosses since i havent tested It.
---
But im pretty sure It wont make that much difference. Its too early to be bitching around. Get your build together, grab your legendary perks, optimize it, then you may come again with proper feedback for the community
---
I mean I have like shotgun perks lying around and stuff. I'll give it ago! Thanks:)
---
How many can you build in your camp, is there a hard limit?
---
So If i get revived by it i stay at about 80% rads?
---
No, the fact that bugs that make the game more grindy, interfere with quests, etc are left for last, and ones that may make an event easier or whatnot are squashed immediately. Its akin to Rockstar fixing glitches in GTA Online that help a player earn money without having to buy money from Rockstar, but ignore the bugs that allow players to run around a game session in God mode, killing everyone.
---
Bethesda: we are making extensive changes to the game.
---
PTS Players: here are hundreds of posts about the changes over the course of several weeks.
---
Bethesda: changes are live, here are the details.
---
Players after downloading Patch 22: OMG where is all this coming from?
---
mostly bloodied that took a hit, that and junkies, the other didnt suffer nearly as much
---
I played the Campfire Tales event for the first time since the update. It was nonstop waves of level 50 Bloodbugs. I went through 15 Stimpacks, my super sledge went from 200% to broken, and my axe went went from 200% to 50%. It was super stressful and I won't be playing the Campfire Tales event again anytime soon.
---
I feel more of a connection to that than I should. Saw the update and got a bit of time to mess around with legendary perks on my main, but spent the whole day tutoring instead of getting to try it properly. And way too many of the econ problems I've been going over again and again talked about either exchange of lumber or costs of lumber or something else
---
Wait is that canon
---
im a bloodied rifleman with full unyielding a bloodied lever action. i should not have to shoot a wendigo spawn 3-4 times in the head to kill it i mean it just doesn't make sense im been trying to transition over to automatic rifles but have yet to get a good handmade drop and dont have fixer plans.
---
This update is so damn broken that i cant even venture out anywhere in the wasteland without becoming swiss cheese thanks bethesda for releasing the bullet sponge update so my weapons cant kill anything while im at level 32.
---
Maybe it depends on region but here in Europe the last time I saw people at that event was during the community event of "Wiping out the Scorched plague" or whatever it was called, in the meantime until the first posts about the exploits appeared it was just popping up and disappearing again after the timer ran out.
---
Well you and I will have to agree to disagree there (but I appreciate you being civil about it). If they do have a good amount of double events and stuff, that's better, but a 15 day grace period is just too little in my opinion. I go out of town a lot and I don't wanna get stuck at rank 88 and have to use atoms just to get my end-season stuff. I guess we'll see though.
---
He didn't say he was leaving lol.
---
Also use ammo smith it doubles what you make.
---
I was able to bash with a flamer
---
Yes and it doesn't revive. It auto heals
---
I have never heard of getting more xp for more damage. If you tag it and it dies everyone gets the full amount... I was doing 5-10 damage to a scorched during LITS and got at least 9k per round. Wasn't killing any of them myself
---
Now what were level 25 super mutants are level 42. I bloody give up with this game 😔
---
I believe the mob perk combo is randomly generated every day, it's just unfortunate that the melee kill only one was picked for the first day.  That being said...
---
I ran Daily Ops for the first time this morning and I loved the chaos.  I enjoy struggling to overcome challenges in games and I don't mind failure.
---
80 times.. wow, You don't give up easy do you??!!😁😁 - I stopped after 3 😁😁😅
---
I started a new character and got them to around level 75, then only used them for extra daily scrip. I love my main build way too much to really use anything else
---
Me too. My thanks to Beth for upping the challenge and making it so I can’t just casually stroll through endgame locations.!
---
There is a huge problem w the ammo factory...ppl are making the ammo and then using it as trade. It's one thing to have one for personal use, but 20-100 for trading....that's a huge issue
---
You can only bash if you have enough AP. You can bash with a minigun.
---
Yeah. I can’t even play this game anymore
---
From my experience from the PTS, it’s a cool down and not a fixed reset time.
---
Ok. I'll try to get my friends to play again first, then I'll make posts n stuff.
---
Very much agree.
---
To be balanced I'm sure there's now some enemies who will come down in level and make those areas easier...but I liked having something to work up to, so I don't really see that as a bonus either.
---
I log on for a little bit of play after work. I don't want to have to spend more time carefully replacing ammo and stimpacks than actually exploring and doing quests.

 And all the adhesive I'll need to keep weapons and armour repaired...I'll need to start an industrial sized farm at my camp haha!
---
Oh! We are! Sorry, you couldn't be here!
---
It is
---
Again, welcome to playing a MMO; where changes upset the balance of top damage dealers and puts you on a more even playing field. Every single MMO has had this happen and people somehow act surprised when they are knocked off their high horses. At least bloodied is still top damage so considering your gear is still god tier not sure why you are complaining; everyone got balanced not just you. Bloodied broke the game balance, now it just breaks it a little less and the low health players die to enemies like they should have from the start.
---
Ah no prob man. And yeah, all weapons got nerfed basically. They changed the way they calculate damage causing all weapons to do much less damage than before. The pain is real lol. Welcome back and hope you enjoy your time here!
---
Hmmm he hasn’t reported back yet....must be good! 😂🤣😂
---
We've known for a while it would cost a point. Lol
---
Retired my crossbow last week and switched to an instigating gauss rifle (not shotgun).  Can one shot most 60 level 2 shot 100.  Bows have been nerfed to irrelevance.
---
\*whoosh\*
---
I think you’re looking for the rainbow 6 subreddit.
---
Damn. That just sucks. It'll make it a lot harder to complete.
---
Still working but if that’s the case I’ll be pretty bummed. I love the Jetpack and even as it was I wished it was a little better. It certainly didn’t need a “nerf”.
---
get better guns, they nerfed dmg, bloodied and junkies took the hardest hit, try to get an anti armor gun
---
Are they going to allow anyone to enter an instanced camp or will it be limited to player and teammates? I don't entirely trust it to be implemented in a manner that isn't bullshit
---
Are shotgun builds over?
---
The Vault Boy in the weekly graphic on the main menu is holding one...something tells me it’s on the horizon.
---
Ammo prices can't drop any more than they already are unless they star allowing you to sell ammo in bulk
---
I'll ask around. Thanks! :)
---
I knew it was bad when I first loaded in to the game at White Springs Station and was killed instantly by a level 60 mole rat. I hadn't taken a step or even move from the load in spot on the tracks. Was dead seconds into my first world after the download.
---
he said his build is viable but was worried about gunslinger builds. you missed the point to get karma being an asshole.
---
The new damage numbers are growing on me. I was upset at first that I could no longer one-shot harder enemies with my sneak build, but it seems fine after playing for a bit. The damage numbers feel a bit more natural now, while still allowing you to be powerful with a good build.
---
Because it's Bethesda and all they did was probably copy/paste and reskin the Brahmin...
---
Use the internet
---
8 characters so far, planning another two :-)
---
B sniper
---
B commando
---
B hvy gunner
---
B shotgunner
---
B 2h melee
---
B 1h melee pistol hybrid
---
J commando
---
J hvy gunner
---
Wip Furious or AA commando
---
Wip Furious or AA hvy gunner
---
Why? Found or traded for good shit, and wanted to try different builds.
---
Brought several up during 2x exp event, go full uny gear and a rapid fire gun, join a public team, tag everything at Radiation Rumble and Guided Meditation. Food and chems. Not sure if this method is busted now with 1Wasteland.
---
PA Reboot has no animation either. It's an auto heal back to "full" health without removing rads. It also does not proc Revenant.
---
It's worth it for the stashbox and monthly atoms, if you like looting and buying cosmetics/decor. The private server is quite useful for transferring items between characters if you don't have friends to hold stuff for you. The survival tent is handy for having secondary travel point and stash access. Yeah, it's worth it. Unfortunately, now that I have it, I can't play without it. So they got me good and hooked.
---
Well. Guess im not coming back still. I keep reading the updates but it's just battlepass stuff and events. I want more quests. Wastelanders was almost a good idea and it seems like bethesds just doesnt build on it
---
The roadmap says Fall.. so I;d say Oct/Nov. December is definitely the winter roadmap territory.
---
He never said he was leaving lol.
---
use a set of troubleshooters armor, and if u alone get lone wanderer they will do nearly no dmg, one star trouibleshooter armor is usable, u just want the -15%
---
Looks great but no space to build anything
---
Why does it matter? Just because it's something minuscule doesn't mean it's okay. What you think of those ammo factories? Two walls is okay but ammo factories ain't? Where do you draw the line? Bethesda knows where. It's called 'if it's an exploit, it's a nono'
---
i found it infuriating. dead over and over, used every stimpak i had and then got slammed with a resilient assaultron at the very end that melted me in one shot. I'm lvl 200,max unyielding combat armor, max tse handmade and i was a helpless baby in there. Add to it the bug where vats kicks me out after a single shot, i had no chance. I hate this game sometimes and rn i want to throw in the towel completely.
---
I agree 15 is small, but you have to include xp, especially with 75% more exp for an hour every day, that's a ton more.
---
I did. Not sorry either. I'll feedback your comment!
---
If I could set to use 3 legendary modules per build I would gladly do it. Otherwise this is BS. Also, how is the Solar Armor always 3 stars? Why is it more special than the SS?
---
Its a reduction, but honestly its not that bad - I'm using a bloodied gauntlet, and it still 1HK level 50/60 mobs, and takes 2 punches to kill a lv100 super mutant.
---
I think today was the first time I experienced it in earnest... as in I clicked on the location, hit Confirm, and absolutely *nothing* happened.  The map didn't even close.  Again and again.
---
I've had it where the map closes... maybe this happens once a week or every other week.  And usually you just take a step to the right and try it again.
---
Actually. Its 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. Level 91 and i have two legendary perk slots!
---
I can't even hear his voice lines over the sound of people constantly shooting the mobs and not meleeing them.
---
i have enough strength for the two handed perk cards since im at an impasse between going gauss shotgun or bloodied auto rifles
---
Of course not.
---
The communist bunker now has a smaller interior
---
the dmg shown on weapon is if the enemy has 0 dmg reduction, count with the armor the enemy has aswell
---
I do feel myself underpowered right now when doing WestTek or anything else. Not talking about daily ops, the first one I started the first shot I got the first death I got. This nerf is non-sense, the problem here is that they did not explained the hidden details under the change of calculations on damage (I mean why the sum of our bonuses and not the product, they are basic mathematical operations that may not be difficult for a programmer). Seriously its frustrating to not being able to one-shoot a single mutant hound. Hope the they do not introduce a nerf that make radroaches seem like a sheepsquatch.
---
I only did super mutants with stealth. The suiciders were a bitch but the end fight before the big boss was easier since stealthed or not they had a big diamond tagging them
---
Sometimes they just disappear, they could have been killed while you were gone but unless you find a corpse you’ll never know for sure if it was killed
---
The update has made scorched into bullet sponges while im sitting there looking like swiss cheese.
---
B)
---
The sarcasm is strong here, at least I hope it is for OP's sake.
---
If you think the money they made from initial sales of the game are enough to fund the continued support of new content plus server upkeep much less even make back the production costs of the base game then you clearly dont know much about game development, I’d say this game is constantly teetering between barely afloat and insolvent. As to your daily ops gripe about being hit by something that wasnt there, I 100% bet the enemies were cloaked. Check the patch notes or better yet just read the daily ops mission description.
---
NY waived the job seeking part luckily. I haven't had offers. I also have a job to go back to buy I work in live entertainment / theater... Who the hell knows when that will work itself out lol.
---
No, the posts where so long ago. This guy would do the same thing before every big update for destiny. He also stated it with "Twas'" l so I was just wondering
---
I saw resiliant robots @ the burrows &amp; decided to play around in game for a while before trying an op...
---
So far I've dispatched a mirelurk queen.. exploding 50 cal no probs.. the king was nastier as usual.
---
Then I ran into a 100 legendary sheepsquatch.. 50 cal was fine till I ran out of ammo but it went down okay..
---
Legendary scorchbeast next.. ultracite gatling minced her nicely.
---
In-between these I encountered two lvl 75 colonel gutsys.. now they were NOT fun:P
---
So yeah.. I'll try the op but I'm not hopeful!
---
And 100 generators?
---
How do i view the daily ops report at the end to exit the mission? i cant figure it out.
---
I think its unarmed but not sure. I've never used the power fist.
---
And fixers seems to be broken. Test another weapon
---
Because everyone reads notes and comes here everyday? 🤡
---
Bloodied builds going to feel it lmfao! Lazy man or woman or creatures build. No more unyielding non blocker builds lol. Got to respec your characters. Pop on after this big patch and freak out that you can’t one shot any more but you die ten times more with this update. I say I very much like this patch. Scrubs going to have some work to do and not be lazy.
---
Just the usual then
---
u do know that a weapon bash is enough right? u dont need to switch at all
---
So all pets will level up now!? This is amazing I need to go find a new deathclaw
---
More like 5 minutes to notice it.
---
5... I don't often play with them but they're all different builds.
---
Levels are 203, 120, 150, 90, 60.
---
I actually love the levelling up process and making new builds. Got a heavy PA bloodied / melee. Same but Junkies. Bloodied Melee. Berserker. Bloodied shotgun.
---
Stealth bloodied commando checking in. Switch out your stealth perks for defensive agility perks and you will not have as much as a problem. You will still die, but not as much, a good vampire weapon will definitely come in handy. Did it 12 mins solo. 
---
Even if you aren’t specced for an assault weapon, a vampire one will still be effective in keeping you alive long enough to rush them and whack em to finish them off. 
---
Stealth perks have no benefit in the daily ops. Swapping them out just for the op mission for defensive perks is the best bet. 
---
I also use vats heavily but it’s no good at the pace the enemies are coming. That vampire 10 aim 15 reload I have is a blessing.
---
No, but it’s even more complicated than that. Not only does it have to be separated Forest or urban sets, those sets only count as whatever they were when they originally dropped. Some have had paint jobs, so you don’t even know what they were in the first place.
---
Are the daily ops the same across the servers? Because the first one I did definitely wasn’t the robot one that I’ve done since. It was in the shopping mall with blood eagles and dogs that turned fucking invisible
---
Yea, and what is worse is that 2-3 weeks ago I knew the risk but made the build and I had finally started to deal some good dmg. Bethesda doesn’t want that to happen though
---
Yea that scared the piss out of me when I logged in. Thankfully it’s just a naming glitch.
---
I have to ask did you level and equip the legendary perk follow through. I’m not nearly as geared as your character is and so far I’m only shooting a couple of more shots per kill with only rank 2 equipped.
---
My second try was with a group of Germans. My German isn't really good but we still completed it fast enough to get the elder rank
---
Full set of Anti-Robot Armour (-75% Damage), been useful for Encrypted for a while, now even more so.
---
Love my set, just a shame it's not matching.
---
Only for daily ops and the colossus wendigo event gave ammo returns I thought.
---
Yeah send a ticket in
---
I just did Jail Break and if anything it’s underpowered in our brave new world.
---
Right?! I’m having a blast crafting insane amounts of ammo :D
---
Hack some terminal...skip the reactor lockdpwn...pick some door... and presto...
---
Bonus? Hack turrets and see the robots go bang  hahaha
---
interesting. I've been fighting robots in the burrows.
---
I feel like some of my budget is missing today. Anyone else notice this issue?
---
And I can live up to my moniker Ray “The Crippler” Stevens.
---
Ummm if you can read that's 2 in 35 mins
---
I can’t wait to feast on these bloodied tears posts all day today.
---
press esc (on pc) but i have heard that some of the nexus mods - mods  could cause the report not to be displayed
---
You are welcome

---
I'm on PC and was on for an hour with no issues.
---
Looks like bash damage guns are back on the menu!
---
Well, it’s OP for scavenger-trader type of players like me 🤔
---
I haven't been taking notes, but most world enemies have been around lvl 75 for me (as a lvl 199) and SBQ enemies and "boss" enemies with the crowns have been 100.
---
I'll try to pay more attention and update.
---
\[update\] Interestingly enough, last fight SBQ was lvl 95 while the adds were 100
---
I assuming it's there so you can't just sneak and do everything but for killing the final enemies without firing a shot but yeah it's annoying that a whole style of play is just completely cut off.
---
It would once in a blue moon but not 2x in 35mins
---
depends on the perks you have, maybe your build is way more optimized than mine to do insane amount of damage. My build is kind of a hybrid between bloodied melee, bloodied rifleman and carryweight.
---
People are complaining about this??
---
See that’s the problem. I don’t mean to be at all offensive but end game content is supposed to be something to work towards. And from what you’re saying you’re relatively early. I do agree rifleman needs a little bit of a buff but.... that’s a whole other thing. People who have ground it out need endgame activities balanced to them.
---
My biggest problem is that I have a Data cap of 100gb a month from my provider.
---
Cant even one shot a radrat with a bloodied mole miner gauntlet
---
Downvote ☝️? Dafuq?
---
Dude this is the perk I’ve been waiting for!!!!
---
just logged in and my damage seems way down
---
Get a vampire weapon and just shoot them constantly. It still heals if they have no health left.
---
I loved this glitch cause it allowed me to keep stocked on 40mm but at least daily ops enemies drop 40mm so I can do that instead.
---
They cant remove hacked weapons. You can only wait for powercreep to fix that
---
And thank goodness it was.
---
Is ss armor heavy or sturdy? Thinking about the legendary perk that reduces ranged dmg
---
yep. I'd recommend reading the patch notes and the game's newsletters.
---
I don't mean from a player point of view. Of course a players wants to go as far as he can.
---
I mean from a game designer point of view. If you were to design a final boss battle, how do you want it to feel? To play out? Would you want a player to be able to circumvent that because he thinks he put enough effort and time into it?
---
In short: can you explain to me the game design appeal of a 3 min final bossfight?
---
Sorry it’s taken so long. Where are you from if you don’t mind me asking
---
You are right, I meant 1h
---
I just works..
---
2 shots to kill a SB....casual...
---
Those are just gulpers without eues
---
Did you actually try playing the game or did you just look at the numbers and then come to complain because all though my damage numbers have gone down the actual ttk an enemy for me isn't all that different.  Gouls are just as easy to kill and super mutants are slightly harder.  To me the game actually feels like a game again and not just a god mode simulator.  I am actually enjoying the game more
---
yes - supermutants stealth headshot pre patch 2500 dmg and post patch about 1800 dmg
---
Our weapons are still powerful enough.
---
Taking One For The Team, Blood Sacrifice, move points from Agility to Charisma and share Rank 3 cards then take Legendary Agility to recoup missing Agi points. Be a team player and capitalize on dying.
---
There only point is that they are fanboy, this company could literally bend them over and they would ask for another please.  And the other fools on this sub would give them a thumbs up.  One guy I saw on this sub appeared to be salivating because a Beth Mod responded on their post ... oh thank you so much for all that you do... or some shit I saw them write.... lol... I can't.  Fucking morons..
---
&gt;...camped around corners and *bashed* them as they came by.
---
Resilient sounds like it could be fun but I wouldn't want to mess with that either if I was doing stealth snipering.
---
Don't you know ammo is the rarest resource in the entire game? Oh wait, it's not? You can easily obtain thousands of rounds?  
---
Well shit.
---
Ohh! Well unfortunately I only have Unyielding.
---
These resilient enemies just opened a can of worms for this game. MELEE IS BROKEN. A lot of times attacking the enemy doesn't deal any damage even though you hit them. When will bethesda ever fix this stupid bug? This was tolerable when you are just casually grinding.  However fighting these resilient enemies with my bloodied melee set up is just frustration and suffering.
---
are you trolling? tell me you are trolling!
---
My main is a Junkies hybrid and took about a 25% damage hit. That combined with one wasteland balancing enemies should make for good sport. 
---
My secondary is a melee bloodied. That character went to bed last night able to do 800 damage per hit with unstoppable monster and woke up today being able to do 286. They didn’t nerf bloodied for melee, they gutted it. There is absolutely no way at 20% health you could seven or eight hit a Yao Guai and not die. Never mind a pack of them, or more than a couple super mutants (read: West Tek interior). It has become an unviable build. 
---
Please understand I don’t play that character anymore and I am not complaining about this. If anything I’m just more surprised at how deeply and drastically they cut bloodied. 
---
I feel like the only bloodied builds that will survive this readjustment are stealth commando builds. Melee is unviable at 20% health.
---
Korg, Planet Sakaar
---
Chin up, you only went from 430 to 205.
---
I went from 1.5K down to 450.
---
Edit: on the Supermutants in WT
---
Nothin like pumpin yourself up for a earl, queen, or daily op run.
---
To be fair, most patches have plenty of unmentioned things. Sometimes they're minor or stealth changes to things the community doesn't like, but sometimes they are genuinely good like the flamer buff or the introduction of the fire damage in general. If they wanted to pad out the patch notes, they could include the other things they already do without making pointless fixes
---
My current issue is that weapon bashes have pretty bad hit detection and if an enemy moves even slightly into my model, I miss and they get to keep killing me.
---
Put pacifist on.
---
Yes lumber prices and everything building wise has gone up some or double it’s a weird time.
---
Wait till you try another game and realize how easy fallout is even after the nerf
---
Placing down a tent where the enemies spawn, making them spawn in another area instead, easier to aoe and nuke. Don't give more experience points, but easier and quicker. I did the event legit when no one was around, and I got same xp just it takes longer to kill them obviously, but the spawn rate are the same I believe. I am not 100% sure about that.
---
I have 5. My main is level 365 the others are all around level 100. I play a lot lol. I like having different characters so I can swap stuff with them in a private world. I have a guy who holds all my good legendary guns. He has almost 400 pounds worth. If my main guy had to take up half his stash weight with guns that would suck. I also enjoy different camp spots. My main guy is all about sales so the vendors are front and center. Plus I have him located right in the middle of the map for easy access to shoppers. My other characters I do more strange builds, I don’t care much about selling things so I go to remote/unique places. Lastly stuff like the recent scrip sale. I had all 5 guys loaded with 1000 scrip. Which meant 5 times as many assassins cryolaters...lol.
---
Just played for an hour and it was smooth,  no crashes on my PS4
---
How do you get plans for the fixer?
---
Haha ya it sounds intense, I cant wait to get home and give it a try.
---
Good luck in the Wastelands.
---
I unlocked it but I can’t find it anywhere?
---
I'm still trying to wrap my head around the difficulty of having to shoot twice instead of once. I mean, what the fuck Bethesda?
---
Yeah, i added to a edit to the post clarifying that the number of days you can miss will be a lot higher with the xp and double score weekends etc.
---
Go get it! I’m looking forward to get 4 star Ammo factory to increase crafting boost to 230% combined with regular perk :D I’m never looting ammo boxes anymore :,)
---
Did you also remind the teacher that their damn Lunchboxes weren't granting the XP they promised, ripping off countless players who thought they were doing something nice when, in reality, they were zeroing out the benefits for everyone around them?
---
I thought not.
---
That's why I have zero regrets about LITS.  It took Bethesda well over a *month* to fix that problem.  LITS was simply averaging out the loss.
---
It got removed months ago on the PTS.
---
I promise you, I am not.  I even streamed my game on Discord with the team I'm farming with to show them it's not working.  Damage does not improve.  I'm tempted to try and find a two-handed melee weapon and test the perk cards out with that, but so far I can only confirm that one-handed melee perk cards are not registering for me.
---
Actually, it was stolen from minecraft, which invented building
---
thank you sir
---
I agree. I run instigating melee (with 21 str) and it's pretty bad now. If I power attack I can sometimes kill enemies in 1 hit, usually 2 now (level 60 enemies). It has taken up to 4 hits for the level 100 super mutants. It's going to take a while to get used to.
---
The only good vampire weapon I have is a Vampire Explosive Mini-gun.. but I managed to do it with my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I don’t really understand the damage change but since I haven’t really been using optimized legendary effects I’m hoping I’m not to affected, did have one bloodied weapon I like so if bloodied is nerfed that’s a pity
---
What’s the point of a stealth build if you can’t use it? Oh ... and a non-melee build. Let’s put a fucking mode together that shits on your character and has mutators that don’t exist anywhere else in the game. 
---
Daily Ops is trash. Is it supposed to be fun getting swarmed with enemies, dying and then loading back in, unable to move or access your pip boy? Regardless of mutators, glitchy and stupid.
---
Well....it is a mystery....just sayin.
---
*whoosh*
---
That is their downside
---
Most PA builds already spam explosive gatling plasma, stimpacks/quantums, and stealthboys. Teslas and explosive lasers are the only good decent counter to them, and now they are going to be healed even more.
---
They've done a great job on this item. Everything I hoped it would be.
---
I didn't think people were actually going to post shit like this. OMG I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
---
RIP to giving FREE AMMO to players
---
I’m a level 36 on my own. One of the daily challenges is to complete it. Tried a couple of times now and can’t even kill 1 thing. Get there health all the way down but they just do not die...
---
Sludge lung is bugged and requires that you get a second disease. Get sludge lung, swap servers, then get another disease. I just napped on a dirty sleeping bag.
---
I’ve only done LITS once and I thought it was weird that everyone just used grenades on this bunch appearing right behind us. It sucked cos I’m an unarmed build and I was useless. Ha ha. I thought thats a rubbish event.
---
How can I get Ammo Factory now? I just came back after playing from beta to about 9 months so I'm behind the curve.
---
They changed the way damage calculations work lol
---
Check the patch notes.
---
They’ve tweaked damage modifiers.
---
Make a group, join the ops. Other people in your group get the message someone is in an Ops and they do the same. You'll join someone in there automatically. If you're not in a group it will automatically be a solo Ops.
---
Did you not reach the patch notes, or hopped on the reddit in the last couple weeks, or even just scrolled down in the last couple hours? They changed the damage calculations from multiplicative to additive. Everything is doing less damage, but everything is easier to calculate. Bloodied is still doing the most damage.
---
Is the part where you freeze in place, can’t access your PIP Boy and have to leave the game and reload a part of the quest as well?
---
No.  No one else is having this issue. Just u =)
---
It’s not a trading post .. stupid bots
---
Well now I know which perk my fresh heavy gunner is getting immediately to sustain his crippling addiction to 50 cal bullets.
---
You have no investment into building a caracter, farming gear and expect to be able to complete endgame content?
---
Sounds like fun (challenge)
---
Dear OP, search for posts mentioning the word 'nerf' from, oh, about a month ago. Come back after reading all 4000 posts.
---
Well I thought after getting the arms and chest with in two rolls. I literally said wow this is easy.... yeah Todd proved me wrong lol
---
😂😂😂
---
I don’t think theres a limit
---
Thanks. So basically there is no way to have regular armor and have hazmat/PA level of protection
---
I had to do it 3 times with different groups to get elder, which isn't bad because I got 2 rare rewards. Only one other player seemed to know the layout of the burrows, that'll change pretty quick though.
---
Yep. I maxed out the charisma lwgendary perkcard and now I know i wasted a shitload of perk coins.
---
Not a bug, designed, there has been numerous posts about it.
---
Someone even put up a PSA about it yesterday
---
This daily ops was not fun lol I get lost in the burrows too easily and my AP stopped regenerating half way through the fight. Only 2 of us knew what to do with the uplinks and we only barely got the initiate rank with seconds to spare. 
---
I couldn’t even bash the robots to finish them because AP bar was stuck at zero halfway through the op. Plus I fidget to loot ever for my ultracite ammo because we were pressed for time to complete it. And there was still a ton of bots in the tunnels after we beat the boss, so I wasn’t going through with fighting them again 
---
I’ll definitely try the ops when it’s blood eagles and muties though
---
If only you guys had fought for improved PvP instead of forcing their focus on the waaay too easy PvE. 🤣
---
Nothing to do with the amount of ammo...I have 6000 rounds on me and 500 violet flux to make more...the point is that I worked on this build for 300 levels and it just went to shit....I one shotted every creature in the game except the sponges...I dont mind wasting some ammo on the SBQ, a Mirelurk Queen and so on...I do mind having to 3 shot a super mutant now...
---
It's almost as if Bethesda didn't want everyone 1 tapping almost every mob and is taking the necessary steps to correct the grossly overpowered nature of the game.
---
If an extra shot to kill, which isn't much difference too big an issue, you're probably best off taking a break like many others are I'm sure.
---
Multiple posts before server went live stating that legendary charisma doesn't allow perk sharing. You need to move those perception points to charisma then use legendary perception.
---
I’m a melee build as well.
---
Do you have Glowsight3 equipped?
---
I’d venture part of it is the enemies are higher level than we are accustomed to.
---
I have not done a nuke zone yet, but I just did radiation rumble.    Not on a team, Glowing ones in the 70s and higher (instead of maxing out at 62), and my SS ghoul slayers switchblade doing about 2/3s the damage it did pre-patch.
---
Thats with incisor3, martial artist3, glowsight3, and a ghoul slayer weapon.
---
Saw similar at UF.  Mole miners from L40 to 100.
---
I generally used a vampire SMG there - great fro tagging.  It did about 1/3 less damage.  Still takes them out, but requires several more shots to do so.
---
They said scorched, not SB
---
You fixed the floating glitch of the weapon display rack, but created a new glitch where weapons that have skins/atomic shop skins are displaying invisibly.
---
Ok I checked, I was wrong about the first part I admit. But it’s still bs seeing all the melee builds complain that they can’t kill bosses the fastest anymore. It’s just annoying the fact that you can just get a weapon and be done. You don’t have to spend hours getting thousands of rounds of ammo that you know you know you’re gonna rip through after like 3 events, and you don’t need to spend time and ammo to get like 4 attachments but you can’t buy the plan for it so you have to get like 100 guns to scrap of enemies when they have an extremely low chance of dropping just to scrap them all and get every single attachment EXCEPT for the ones you actually need. Y’all just get one attachment on your op fist and you’re set. No need for anything else, oh it broke? Don’t worry, just get like 15 metal and boom easy.
---
they will simply say its fOr sErVEr STaBiLiTy
---
Same way we always had.   Serendipity, dodge, blocker.
---
Vampire explosive gatling was perfect for it.
---
My response is still valid if I add "yet".
---
Me fellow lad, it gets even better. 4 star Ammo factory combined with maxed out regular ammo perk gives 230% ammo crafting boost. It’s just **makes mind blowing sounds**
---
If the CAMP was easily moveable and replaceable then this whole post wouldn't be necessary... How is that not obvious?
---
Revolver player here
---
Just don't mention the war.
---
To be fair it does make sense based on the scaling thing. Apparently seeing the annoying little b'stards off earns a lot more xp.
---
If you are on xbox I can do it with you. Ive done it in 10 minutes solo as a non bloodied unarmed build. 7.57 in a group who died about 4 times.
---
Anti-Armor explosive .50cal here. It was a blast to pop a bunch of lunchboxes and farm when someone put their tent in just the right spot.
---
&gt;You mean two-shot is actually doing the damage of two shots again
---
Not really.
---
Explosions kept their multiplicity and I think that's part of what's happening here.
---
I'm not gonna lie, they had us in the first half.
---
Then dont, I dont understand why you need to one shot everything?
---
Oof. Almost had me.
---
if you find that infuriating maybe you should put the controller down and go outside for a bit
---
It’s not mentioned in the patch notes. Patch notes are way more recent communication than the roadmap posters.
---
I work construction and am working most days and don't get much time to play at night. I feel ya
---
Not being for it is not the same as being against it. There is a system in place, and it works fine. Some people are going to miss out. That's life.
---
of course bro! and it's shameful the amount of hits you need to kill low level enemies even being high level with bloodied melee weapons.
---
Not you can't even stroll through the forest if you're a higher level.. they really want to make this game as grindy as possible don't they.
---
You play in NASA headquarters?
---
Hey - I’m new to the game. When I opened it I expected to be told it needed an update. But it went straight through to the game. Will the game update automatically?  Did it do it earlier?  I saw new stuff in the atomic shop. And a new menu on the bottom left. But I can’t tell if it’s updated. Do I need to do something?
---
well, i think my build is really unoptimized, Perception 9:
---
3x master rifleman
---
3x rifleman
---
 it depends on the situation which perkcards are in the remaining 3 slots:
---
3x glowsight or 2x expert rifleman + green thumb or 3x tank killer
---
the other damageboost is 2x  covered operative
---
I can help you out if you’re on PS4. Don’t forget, you gotta melee em to fully kill em.
---
Hey! You’re finally awake!
---
Best thing to do when out of the loop and a new update drops.    Read Patch Notes.
---
Even bashing them?
---
Read patch notes
---
I am playing solo including solo sbq and earl so not a team player 😉 I will take the legendary agility i think
---
If you have any mods that affect the UI like perk loadout manager or the health bar stuff, it conflicts with the daily ops screen (and legendary perks)
---
Yes, just talking straight up DMG...sneak headshot and I was doing over 2k...now it is like 400...base DMG with adreniline 430 to 205...ridiculous...
---
Alas, almost every mothman item except the glowing glasses that I actually want.  The night vision goggles are nifty, though.
---
Sorry
---
yeah sorry i read it again and noticed the Typo with "LMG" i will be doing extensive testing tonight as i have 8 toons covering ALL weapon types, looks like a long night for me but we will get to the bottom of this
---
And it still doesn't increase damage per shot like the card says it does.  Only accuracy.
---
The ONE creature you can never out run, trick by jumping up / down cliffs or even hide inside a building to get away from. WHO KNEW a freakin' rodent would be the ultimate scourge? Just wait until patch 23 when the squirrels join them with aerial bombs and attacks from the tops of doors and roofs!
---
They've redone the whole combat system which I don't code games but can't imagine that being a little thing, plus overhauled the perk system. Also adding slow release content that will need to be there but just in the background waiting to be activated. 
---
I still can't justify 30gb with that going on but like I said I don't make games so whether it's plausible or not I can't say.
---
That has not changed though.
---
But it didn't work
---
Make a daily ops public team, people who want to run it with you will join. That's what i had to do.
---
Tbh, I like going in blind on a first run of things(not watching, reading patch notes, guides, etc.) Of course, it's still important to read what's put in front of you instead of just skimming over(the resilient mod). 
---
But 3\* pistol? All I got was a 1\* pick axe haha
---
and report the player who uses the hacked weapon
---
Welcome to the new world.  
---
Leave it to people to exploit a game and play it in a way it was not intended. Then garner an army of sheep who meta the exploit. That makes gaming much less  interesting when it is only a race to see who can kill the boss faster rather than experience a grueling fight where you are actually afraid you may not win. Then you have cheaters... a whole-nuther-storie.
---
Honestly they did a super terrible job with explanations on this. I didn't notice the tiny text but quickly figured out that resilient needed a specific type of damage to take them down. Meanwhile I have no idea how to exit. It just says "View the Operation Report" which is not a hotkey, I've pressed every single one and just have no clue what to do. Classic 76 lol
---
Are you joining a public team? If not, either find or make a daily ops public team; like-minded people will join you and do ops with you.
---
Their aware enough to come here and post and scream about here, but they aren't aware enough to see the weeks of posts advising that this would be happening.
---
It’s not really ‘one tapping’, I die a lot in any events, especially losing fluxes after SBQ, it’s basically their ‘high risk high damage’ system at work. But now they made high risk less worthwhile, people would just go full Hp and not die at all, I’ll probably do the same.
---
Running pretty smooth on xbox.
---
I definitely agree that you should bail on the game, if it is that much harder for you now.
---
Damage, it seems
---
It was FUN, man. I'll def be mourning it.  Not even for the XP, but for how hilarious it was, when everyone would gather up and just unload, and scorched bits would go FLYING. Made it easy to loot all your corpses, too.
---
Rad-x is broken in Nuclear a winter and does not provide radiation protection, multiple people on team had same problem and tried up to 4 rad-x each.  @ladydevann
---
Odd, but I guess not game breaking when in first person mode as I normally am.
---
agreed. you changed my mind
---
I am quitting this game, until my bro gets home from work then we will **SLAY.**
---
I dump in private servers and have a lot of trust that my game won't glitch out
---
It’s shit! Pube of health bloodied deathclaw, unyielding around and 3
---
Hits in a level 60 wolf . Wtf
---
Wow this sucks. I bought a ps4 copy a few weeks ago because I wanted a fresh start and now everything (but me) is a bullet sponge when I'm already having trouble maintaining ammo and stims. I logged in to play a little and don't even want to bother.
---
You just stood still for 5 minutes?
---
Can’t wait for the Mothman Bundle Bundle. A Bundle of Bundles for the price of one Bundle.
---
I do wonder if we’re ever going to get some Mothman Cult content though. Maybe some quests for the faction itself?
---
They are here to stay. They are propably gonna change them at some point but that is in the future.
---
You can always buy the one shot kill fo76 edition for a low price of 300$. Then there is the one shot kill and not be one shot killed fo76 super special Retodd Howard edition for 760$.
---
What do you mean?  Damage nerf?
---
PC, but thanks for the kind offer.  It'll be a fun challenge trying to beat 8 minutes solo.
---
I think for general overworld travel, it *does* feel better.  If you did the PTS, going back to live just felt broken in comparison, running around one-shotting everything, no care or fear at all.
---
But there were some outstanding issues.  Daily Ops end up making DPS king due to the unrelenting swarm of enemies.  Gunslingers and Riflemen just can't keep up.  Laser Turrets are ridiculously tanky.  And the general use of the crude base damage metric as the basis for their algorithm makes the effectiveness of some weapons quite dubious.
---
Bro I fully understand what you are saying, you are not alone on this! Shameful patch from the top to the bottom to be honest.
---
From patch notes; 
---
Earn Perk Coins by scrapping your unused normal Perk Cards. Each Perk Card you scrap will grant you 2 Perk Coins per rank. 
---
For example: When you scrap a rank 1 Perk Card, you’ll receive 2 Perk Coins, and scrapping a rank 3 Perk Card will award 6 Perk Coins. 
---
##Edit: outdated info below
---
~~Make sure your leveling up the animated cards and scrapping them to maximize the amount of perk coins you get.
---
Irc you get 3x the coins for scrapping an animated card.~~
---
Have lots of friends on here and Bethesda needs to hear if players are disappointed in their product...Have a great day!!
---
This has to be a troll...
---
My bad then, don’t really browse this sub much thanks
---
The Fo3 assault rifle skin please
---
Best perk imho
---
Alright you got me. 
---
At least you got to play some post patch. Here I am sitting at my desk procrastinating on Reddit about post patch “raged and confused” drama.
---
Using workshops was the safest option. Couldn't get caught this way since it's gone when you log out. This was pretty fair way to punish people I think. They could have been banned
---
Was a barrel and the map of the fifty states involved in this bending over?...
---
Well, I feel a lot better about having to wait an hour now.
---
Now is the time I finally decide to prime all of my guns, but now I need to launch some nukes so I can make flux first lol
---
I gotta admit its a silly mutation really. I suppose its something for the melee guys though.
---
There’s a mission in watoga
---
Ive got a tip.
---
Each site has a doorway you can walk into and still be in the circle for the quest. This will funnel them into it for easier kills.
---
Tshooters gear is the answer to all robot related issues. A must for any bloodied build in daily ops.
---
Actual answer is that patch notes today said “critters” are now capped at level 5 and can no longer be legendary. I’m assuming that includes chickens, as well as foxes, squirrels, opossums, etc.
---
That sucks. I like NW.
---
Just look at your pipboy. They'll pop up.
---
Good one - you winz one Internetz!
---
Still here lol!! This isn’t Bethesda forums buddy, it’s reddit lol! nor did I support one side or the other.. lol moron
---
Bois i thank all of you i got my shit back
---
Oh yeah, I was already thinking about that as I attrited away Stimpaks at an *alarming* rate doing the Daily Op.
---
What would you rather for the helmet?
---
As long as you’re not mixing pieces, like excavator arms with t65
---
I would look in to seeing if rebinding your keys for things would better suit your needs. If holding down a button in a certain place is bad, see if another key would be better. Speaking as someone who has hand issues as well, this worked best for me. Also, stabilized armor mods help with gun movement when looking through a scope keeping everything steady so you don't also have to hold your breath (with another key press)! I really hope this helps a little!
---
I was tired of sub minute Queen kills and one shot everything. And they nailed the non stealth Daily ops, else It would be easier than It is right now
---
Make the instructions clearer. It’s shit game design if you expect users to read microscopic text or don’t make it clear going into the game mode. 
---
A player shouldn’t have to log on here, read the patch notes and then load it up to understand what the hell is going on.
---
Bad Design.
---
Fuckin hell. It just never stops being funny. Why can't anyone just admit they placed the fucking things? 😂😂
---
170, and no. I can’t find a decent legendary or armor, so I have the beast I could find. Perk cards are pretty optimized though. 
---
But is that really where we are you need a specific setup for a daily mini mission?
---
No. Go claim the ammo factory as intended if you want an ammo factory at your workshop. An exploit is an exploit, regardless of how you perceive the benefit or detriment.
---
Did you read the info? They have a mutation. You need to melee it to kill it.
---
You can actually turn off the noise on the device.   Just click the panel on it after it is repaired.   Have to do it again each time it is repaired though.
---
Yeah. Thankfully with legendary luck I cna put that card back in my build
---
Me too lmao this happened to me first run(no I didn’t read it) and I just figured it was a glitch that the bots wouldn’t die. I quickly left the op and opened the menu back up to read and realized I’m the dumbass. 😅
---
Edit:spelling
---
Yeah I don't think they thought about what the players want and just did what they want
---
450 .50 cal per craft?  Sweet mother of mercy.
---
I don't feel bad about going full Ultracite Ammo builds now.....this rocks.
---
Now other builds will actually be used, this is what balance is all about.
---
If there is no reason to un-equip those effects for other effects then that effect (bloody/unyielding) is too powerful and it destroys the balance of itemization.
---
It makes it so players don't want to do other builds when one covers almost every situation through superior utility or has too much damage added.
---
You having to go full health to do certain events is actually good for the game and shows the game is more balanced now.
---
They only die to melee. Says it in the daily ops guide
---
also shooting limbs not the torso or heads.. legs on ASSaultrons especially...
---
Go print some more pamphlets, man.
---
&gt; Exploit: Items can no longer be stacked on objects that are in disrepair.
---
Bethesda please :c This was one of my favorite parts of camp building. I know it's a glitch but it was a nice one. Now I have this [dumb gap](https://imgur.com/hEzzQeg) in my bedroom walls as im trying to build a new camp. Please put this back. Or just add a feature to allow us to place two sided walls!
---
I am a melee guy and I didn’t like it. It’s nonsensical to have a challenge that requires you to stand in one place to charge up a meter, but throw tons of enemies that have to be killed with a melee weapon who stand 30 feet away. You run over, kill them, run back to the circle only to have to run away again 3 seconds later. Eventually I just had to sit there and sponge bullets to fill the meter.
---
Interpretation is must different than making solid statements supporting whatever it is you like to believe lol stop while your behind please
---
So, just for clarity, you are confirming that the flamethrower trap trick still works? All my CAMP builds rely on that trick and I was bummed to read about it in the patch notes earlier.
---
Damage rebalance is definitely going to cause longer fights, but as long as enough people show up and do decent damage i wouldn't worry much
---
I did surface to air but I had a minigun as weapon
---
Bwahah, just went. Sigh...level 50 and died immediately to my Vamp LMG.
---
Must've turned in more than 60 last month. No magic shotty for me :(
---
I'm in the same boat. Melee/sneak build and it's taking me 4 hits or so. I get its nerfed but I'm not even getting sneak shot bonus.
---
Spoiled food always did, nothing new here.
---
Same. Don’t get me wrong, the ludicrous display of dozens of Scorched spawning right smack dab in the middle of the arena is always fun, but this was always a fun event for me to begin with. I love myself a good wave defense.
---
So should I expect my camp to not be there when I log on today if I happen have a ammo gen there
---
still dropping those evil gnasher grenades **^(ugh)**
---
That would be THE BEST THING about this patch if it is true.
---
I had resilient bots in the burrows.  It was crazy, I tried it and was hamburger pretty quickly. Put on PA and was unkillable. Wierd. I had to kill literally every robot myself though because apparently my teammates can't read.
---
This was also weird: the beacon was stuck at "x0 bonus" for 15 minutes. I stood next to it, jumped on it, brought my team next to it. Nothing. Just stuck. Then it went to 100% and finished. I probably killed over 100 bots in that 15 minutes.
---
Don't listen to haters OP, you are absolutely right.
---
They are helping you complete the event. why care so much about How people play the game they paid for? Jesus, too many problems around to be bothered by someone whos using a weapon to Help me
---
someone should collect them and print a book with it. i suggest the first sentence of this one here as title 🤣
---
The more team members around the uplink the faster it completes.
---
wow thanks a lot, really appreciate this but it seems last patch (from this morning) fixed it 😀
---
That prevents people from killing my pet!? Omg
---
The Tricentenial PA skin does not apply to Excavator, so living in Same, didnt get to enjoy it that much.  The uncle same outfits are ok if you like that sort of outfit.
---
That said, I still have/use a couple of weapons with the tricentennial skin.
---
I just crafted 90 000 rounds for my gatling laser, using only 10flux. Not gonna lie, felt awesome
---
I liked that people could make trap camps, TBH, some players were supposed to be ‘raiders’, they just made it practically impossible to deal with.
---
In the first weeks of the game every person I met was met with a shotgun pointed at their face.
---
\-checks OP's post history
---
\-like third post down:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iaxrpd/ammunition\_factory\_in\_camp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iaxrpd/ammunition_factory_in_camp/)
---
Edit: after being called out on this, OP deleted the post. How pathetic
---
The generator glitch was a budget glitch. Not the flamethrower one tho. That’s fundamental to building complicated camps, not bigger camps
---
&gt; cheese it to the objectives
---
I love that term.  IMHO it doesn't get used enough.
---
I agree, this is a race, not a slog through enemy waves like Vault 94 was (and what I was expecting).
---
Run to waypoint &gt; activate &gt; run to waypoint &gt; activate and wait &gt; run to waypoint &gt; activate and wait &gt; run to waypoint &gt; kill all the things.  Collect 1* nocturnal rolling pin.
---
I didn’t get my helmet
---
Nonsense like "Melee only" shouldn't even be a thing. It's incredibly lazy as a "challenge" along with respawning enemies constantly. Maybe try telling your team what to do instead of posting on reddit and making fun of them? Just a thought.
---
Dammit. This is like the third time I have seen a post like this. Stop playing with my expectations while I am at work.
---
Okay but
---
POV: Wasteland Tycoon
---
Make ammo sell for 1 cap; becomes 450 or 540 caps, etc.
---
You should proabably check it out. It is BoS related, but not the Steel Dawn questline, they are still working on that.
---
Legendary perks were meant to come out awhile back, but finally arrived with this patch, so take the road map as a general guide vs actual timing.
---
The sharing perks feature is based on base charisma, not modified charisma.
---
Has anyone noticed ps4 frame rate improvements in the last couple of patches?
---
It 110% needs a nerf. Fighting players who just hover and rain down fire or lightening has been the most annoying change to PvP since wastelanders.
---
Well thank you for testing and my apologies.
---
I liked going to the easy area of the map on the left and to the not easy side on the right of the map for a challenge. 
---
If you don't follow the bloodied ultra mega 'i'll trade you that for 80,000 caps' this specific combination of items gives you a 17.34% extra damage when the moon is in the second quadrant... extremeness of it all and just want to play a game, the right side of the map WAS a challenge. 
---
Now everywhere is the right side of the map.  I can't sneak anywhere anymore as it takes three power hits from my weapon to take down an enemy, so everyone knows i'm there and i die in a hail of bullets.    If i want to snipe from afar, well that's 200 individual shots to kill one of them, so i hope i brought a packed lunch, im going to be there a while.
---
Yes! Very seriously! 
---
Not going to dig reddit for my issue and it seems it's not only me who lost hours of game time for simply using logic, I hope more players post about this issue it's ridiculous and needs a hotfix.
---
Yes that is correct. I haven't seen any change to the flamethrower trick. I was able to merge items and embed objects into walls no problem.
---
I'm lvl 43 before a group of ferals in Toxic Valley wasnt a huge deal. Now its 10 stimpaks and 100+ ammo. This kind of combat is not viable after 5-6 encounteres with enemies if you don't already have 100+ of everything. My entire stock of ammo and stimpaks has been depleted after only a few hours playing. this isnt enjoyable for me. level scaling should be optional imo. It'd be like playing Skyrim and taking 5-6 hits of a Daedric Axe to kill a rat. its extremely punishing to people who don't have perfect builds or aren't lvl 100+
---
I think a dev noticed after seeing ABOUT 30 TENTS AROUND FORT DEFIANCE
---
Okay? Do what you will, it's just an observation. Also, there are now public groups for those wishing to team up for daily ops.
---
Game isn’t built for “resilient” enemies if you aren’t a melee build. Let me put away my gun while some armor piercing Mr. Gutsy is killing me in 4 shots and get out a melee weapon. Or the punches that don’t connect when I try to hit a robot with my gun. 
---
Garbage design.
---
So, is it actually fixed? Can I use my beloved Teslas again?
---
Should work. But you lose the effect after losing aggro. Thats why its on the last spot, im not really decided yet.
---
As stealth i dont want to be aggroed/out of stealth. I might get legendary luck and some crit perks
---
I would also love to hide my jetpack. It looks weird when I'm walking around in my Bathrobe.
---
You can still do this in a much cleaner way with the rug glitch
---
Sprinting/ Vats/ Jumping?
---
&gt; Here is a great example. Making double sided walls, no. Making the ammo  factory, no. Using the flame trap to glitch other camp items, no. None  of these items will have a negative effect on you. 
---
If they impact performance on the server, they negatively impact others, period.
---
"Farming" the ammo with the exploit using the factories is seen as no different than the dupers of old. I certainly enjoyed hacking their terminals and changing them to produce .38 instead of 5.56 or .308 (most common ammo types I saw being made). Up to Bethesda if they should be banned, but I certainly wouldn't shed a tear if they got some sort of slap on the wrist for knowingly using an exploit.
---
What weapon? Have you tried one of the stocks with improved bashing damage? Those have way higher durability.
---
You did better than me. Dcg with 40%swing speed. 32 min for my first run. I did notice that I got my stealth attack bonus on occasion even though it said danger.
---
I feel you. It took me until lvl 80+ to truly enjoy playing the game. Because I took some time to decide on a build and was really having hard time progressing. But after I became a Rifleman, after I hit high levels with nice guns, I was safe. I was feeling safe roaming. I would hit the Forest to calm down a little and get the stress out of me. I am still waiting for the update to download and so scared of what I’ll find. Sometimes we need to kill some lvl 5 liberators to keep going, stay connected to the game....
---
I'd like to thank all of you for being so friendly. The last patch fixed the bug, as you guys told so 🤙🏻
---
Also, since you intentionally sought out the means for placing one and did it yourself, then tried to lie about it here, your 'cool designs' deserve to get fucked. It's a shame it's not permanent.
---
This is very helpful! Gotta find those mods!
---
Oh I was having fun. Before the infinite waves upon waves upon waves of robots. How the unholy crimson fuck do they expect people to do these masochistic daily ops? Did one for the challenge and now I know yet another thing I'm absolutely ignoring going forward. I like a challenge, not...whatever this is. Probably shouldn't of tried it solo, but I've seen enough to know it's not worth my time at all.
---
Well now we can shoot Scorchbeast Queen's wings and force her to land.
---
No worries, I read the patch notes and thought the same thing. The garden tile change does suck... I did the original floor swap tutorial for that as well incidentally. It was a neat way to put crops into pots and have an indoor garden.
---
From patch notes;
---
##Edit: outdated and incorrect info below.
---
~~Only scrap max rank animated cards if you want to maximize the amount of perk coins you get.
---
Animated cards increase the perk coin reward by x3.~~
---
Really? Hmm, cus i love the level scaling. It keeps the whole map relevant, engaging and challenging. 
---
My level 32 character almost died twice capturing that food factory in the forest for the challenges, it was super fun.
---
are y'all in a Daily Ops??
---
Same. I missed several weeks, but I logged on daily for the last week of extra score. Got to 79 and just used atoms for the rest of it
---
Given that all players are affected by the damage change then idk why pvp would be affected at all
---
There are actually perks already in the game for that.
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
Dope thank you
---
You are correct, you can only get +15 to every SPECIAL minus Endurance. Still OP as fuck.
---
Aye! I work in a lumber yard too! Man looking at this post was like looking in the mirror!
---
Yup
---
Yeah I guess that explains why they can't be fucked fixing it when the majority of players are blind anyway
---
Godmode? It only works with energy weapons. That means there are lots of situations where this perk just won't activate at all.
---
3 rank 1 cards give 6 coins, 1 rank 3 card, gives, wait for it, 6 coins!  There is no difference.
---
That's awesome, and a relief, to hear. Could I bother you for a rundown? I've tried to do it before but I think I must be missing a step somewhere.
---
He sounds like Kellogg from Fallout 4 to me
---
So you’re saying you never once went over the speed limit, not even one mph/ kmh ? Save me the irony..
---
I haven’t had ultrazits since I was a teenager.
---
I have also had no issue with the nerf. And am loving one wasteland. I'm leveling much easier with it, at level 389
---
You got me good take an upvote stranger
---
Ohhh so when you posted about it a month ago asking how to get the plans for it, that's just something you never followed through on? Seems legit. And now you've gone and deleted the original post lol
---
I've spent a considerable time on my character. And i don't slam others for their play style.
---
So with the damage numbers change, that's what is going to make the SBQ event take longer as for the most part, builds are doing a bit less damage. Not majorly, but a bit. As for the intense amount of mobs coming from everywhere, the SBQ spawns random creatures from all directions every time she lands, and for the duration of the time that she's on the ground. So the more she lands, and longer she's on the ground, the more additional mobs you'll see coming into the fight. And with One Wasteland having everything scale....Well, these SBQ fights should be a lot more interesting now.
---
42?  I've not seen a single enemy below 50 yet.  Its either 50 70 or 100 for me..?!?!?
---
this \^
---
on my secondairy char i didnt feel like collecting alot of plans again so i made a base out of prefabs and junkwalls
---
Never switching back to the normal receiver on my LMG. Prime ammo crafting saves this weapon.
---
Try the Campfire Tales event. Now it's nonstop waves of level 50 bloodbugs. Yet it's still labeled as "easy" in the description.
---
I just went to the Whitespring Golf Club to search for a Legendary enemy and got insta-killed by a swarm of ghouls.
---
I don't see how Bethesda thought this would make the game more fun.
---
But bruh, I run a min-max build with 20 buffs and a magic weapon and I want a more challenging experience.  /s
---
It's an exploit and it's good that it's gone. Plenty of other legitimate ways to earn a ton of XP.
---
Ha ha.  No.  I didn't think I have fast internet, maybe it's faster than I realized.  It's also the download speed of the computer/xbox/ps4.  I play on pc.
---
maths is hard
---
do you know if the pipboy is considered part of the hud in this case?
---
The only mod I'm running is better inventory which only affects the PipBoy UI
---
You may have just changed my mind.  I really was not sure which perks I was going to pick up other than the ranged exploding one and the sneak attack damage one.
---
These mole rats ain't playin. It was pretty funny when I came up on my first pack, after the update. Lots of jumping, running, jetpacking. But yeah, ammo and gear ain't gonna go as far anymore. Oh well, still need time to feel it out
---
still up in the air but I don't think so, no. if anything is going to top unarmed it's going to be 2handed anyway.
---
The nerf isn't a game ender at all, but as a non-bloodied unarmed build, it is DEFINITELY noticeable.
---
The pint sized slasher machete skin, still does not correctly apply to the handle.
---
Absolutely, full health heavy weapon power armor build is for you.  You can absorb massive damage, you only need to point your heavy weapon in the direction of the enemy and you don't need fast reactions.  
---
Try to get a two-shot explosive .50 cal or AA Explosive .50 cal.  You can lumber around sweeping the enemies.  If maintaining a consistent ammo supply is difficult, use a TSE gatling gun or AA E gatling gun.  The normal gatling packs a decent punch and does not chew through ammo as fast.  Good luck and good hunting.
---
Edit: A vampire explosive heavy weapon might be your best option also.  This will keep you healed most of the time and you'll likely just have to point and shoot 😁.
---
Bought*
---
From what I noticed, sneak is nonexistent in daily ops, so it wasn't working there. But I even tried it outside of daily ops/events and had the same issue. Even when crouched with \[hidden\] status, the damage was flat.
---
Perfect! You’re a true trooper of the wasteland lol better get ready to defend it, I hear those super mutants like to respawn.
---
That would be amazing.  I spent a TON of modules getting my Unyielding set.
---
How do you join with others? Every time I press the shortcut to join from the pause menu I just enter alone, even though I was in a public daily ops group
---
I like turdles
---
Ultracite ammo boost are even crazier!
---
Its like rng for your timer /s
---
This is so much appreciated!! Thank you for taking the time. Bravo!!!!
---
No you are right
---
How many points do you need to max out a card?
---
What a chump 😂 I'm sure he'll delete this post soon as well, but at least you got to call him out on it
---
Considering how much of a pain in the ass they are, it's great news
---
This gives me hope.  I’m outta town and unable to play until Sunday to judge for myself.    Thanks for posting 😊
---
thats fine for you - if you need help from these cheaters its ok for me.
---
i dont need help from players who sprays their explosive bullets all over the display so i report cheaters
---
\*Sees model train set and shooting arcade\*
---
Do want.
---
I hate it. Playing a bloodied sneak character. (Today?) it's Resilient Robots, which means u gotta go in and melee to finish stuff off. On top of not being able to stealth at all. So yeah, don't even wanna bother
---
? Are you under the impression bloodied commandos are upset with the update???
---
lol that’s what’s up man.
---
Dang I was prepared to tell you to go to the Microsoft Flight Sim sub reddit to announce departure times but you got me.  Good one.
---
Ah yeah it's deleted now too 🙄🤣
---
😃
---
I’ll be a little upset if I can’t fly across the map anymore, gotta test this out later tonight.
---
Start is actually rank 2.
---
EG: I am rank 8 right now with the arrow on the next prize for rank 9.
---
No one said there wasn't. That doesn't change my suggestion.
---
I can’t really notice a difference after the nerf with my full health junkies heavy gunner.  My j/e 50 cal is a little different but my j/ffr flamer and j/e gat plasma are as ridiculous as ever.  Takes two blasts from my j/e combat shotty to fell a lvl 100 super mutant.
---
Isn't it fun? I was randomly blasting away at the Valley Galleria. Bethesda sure knows how to make the game more entertaining. Or not. What's next? Irradiate or poison you with plagues? How about launching nukes directly at your camp so that when you return it is all destroyed?
---
It could have clipped through the floor and died of fall damage, or clipped through the floor and called that his new spawn point, or called another random spot a couple hundred meters from your base his new spawn point- you can try moving your camp module and relogging to see if he comes back but he may be gone forever
---
The whole update is shit IMO
---
As someone who has a small backyard flock of chickens, I can confirm that fertilizer is the number one export from a chicken coop.  Eggs aren't even close.  Bethesda is just being accurate.
---
I like a challenge. The longer the game can provide it, the longer I'll play.
---
My fancy pump action don’t think so :D
---
get a vampire weapon. bash to finish. profit.
---
so it's a challenge for you to do? because it's bland and boring?
---
Friend of mine has Bloodied Commando and is getting 380 damage in sneak headshot...lol before he was getting over 2k in headshot damage...I played for 10 minutes today, scrapped all legendaries that i needed and finished for today. I didn’t got chance to play much but noticed that my Bloodied baseball bat has damage gone from almost 800 to 300... not bad...lol
---
Germany. They always update during prime time... But it's okay as long the patch works.
---
I've currently got 3 characters. I have my old main that I'm probably going to start playing more often again that is a Heavy Gun PA build (Two Shot Gauss Minigun ftw). I have my current main that's probably going to get set aside once I finish getting the SS armor chest piece, who is a unarmed character. He's been pretty fun, but I miss my Power Armor. And then my third character is a Commando build that is only down around level 52ish, and still has a lot of work to be done on.
---
Because there are no other game breaking bugs to fix other than this one
---
Do you even lift, bro?
---
&gt; * Primal Cuts: Quest targets will now appear on all Prime Beasts, instead of only on the last few, which will help players track down any wayward Beasts.
---
* Primal Cuts: During the final wave of Prime Beasts, players are now only required to kill the boss to complete the event.
---
This IMO confirms my suspicions about why Primal Cuts wasn't completing properly often during the last Meat Week. For example in the one with the Mirelurk Queen, she was barfing out little unseen Mirelurk Spawns that you could never find and that was preventing the quest from completing.
---
oh no, well i will be doing nothing but build/perk testing all night so if i find out something i will let ya know!
---
But you did figure out that the game isn't broken, right?
---
Its dull asf
---
Question: it asks to export the .ini into the games directory, but I think the map mod also does this. If I extract one, will the other be deleted/overwritten?
---
This makes up for the ammo factory glitch being removed for sure
---
Yeah, this was a pleasant surprise! My camp gets radrats from time to time, and I genuinely think the turrets (all heavy machine gun ones) are killing them faster than before the patch.
---
Now people can’t do enough damage to kill each other in PVP. It was already bad before with some 1v1 fights lasting forever. Now those would never end.
---
Bro I would love a pet Assaultron, my best wet dream
---
Agreed, probably going to take a break until the next major expansion.
---
Probably spend the evening scrapping and choosing Legendary perks on my 5 characters... yay
---
I had a horrible time, I figured I would be able to solo my daily ops. I was so so wrong. For my location I got the burrows, the enemies were robots, and they were resilient. I go in with 77 stimpaks I exit with 2.
---
BUT you also use alot more ammo now, so in the end its not as op as it seems
---
Future content.
---
Atm I chose ammo factory max out, follow through maxed out, legendary agility 3 and survival chem 1, I understood from angry turtle that taking one for the team does not work only with you in the team so
---
As long as ultracite ammo crafts more than regular, ill still be using it.
---
Imagine if people complained this much about the actual problems in this game instead of taking a combat knife with you to daily ops.
---
As others have said, all legendary perk cards are unlocked at rank 1. If you have an open slot, you can fill the slot with any rank 1 legendary perk. 
---
Each perk card you scrap gives you 2 more points (or correspondingly more points if cards were combined)
---
* To upgrade one card to rank 2 takes 50 points. 
---
* To upgrade one card to rank 3 takes 100 points. 
---
* To unequip one card takes 1 point. 
---
It's a nice small boost for high level players, but will require fantastically high levels to get the 6th slot and upgrade the ranks on the cards you use.
---
You make no sense
---
A molerat now gives me the same xp as a max level ghoul did before, so yeah the xp is increased.
---
Ran west tek just there and I’m getting the same if not less from scaled enemies as I did before
---
Yes your friend was wrong. It's future content.
---
I’m so close to being done work the excitement is going even more. I know I wanna try daily ops I wanna build a better camp, I wanna try our legendary perks. I wanna see if my guns are not powerful anymore. Just so much. I kind of feel like the game just came out this is how excited I am.
---
It seems though, that there are a lot more legendary perks geared towards melee and PA than for rifle meta.  Perhaps this was part of the thought process?  Idk.  I switched out of melee awhile back.  It’s fun, but you miss out on tagging enemies in events.
---
I feel like melee got hit the hardest with this new patch, maybe a little too hard lol
---
Am I reading this right?  Plans only drop if you are under level 50?
---
You need to be undetected for that perk to work right? The mutations make it so that sneaking is basically impossible. You get spotted in seconds through walls
---
I can deal with the huge damage nerf. I can deal with vats not working 70% of the time. As a stealth build, I can deal with stealth being completely useless in Daily Ops. But the resilient buff on enemies can go f itself. It's so stupid as a ranged character that you have to shoot enemies to one health and then run up to them and melee them. I either get shot and they cripple a limb which staggers me which I then can't do anything while I'm stuck in the animation or my melee hit just doesn't register like 50% of the time.
---
Especially when you can buy ammo with caps. You can't buy legendary points with caps.
---
Agreed. My flamer is leaving with more ammo than I went in with. And that's with this pain in the ass bash to kill mode
---
Also going to be set for scrip with the legendarys you get at the end
---
Other weapons also still take their HP down, but that last bit must be melee.
---
You're not wrong
---
they go for at least 5k. usually around 7.
---
Hey I found a bug, I can kill players without them engaging in pvp, pm me for info and video
---
Don't cryptids count as animals, which means the Hunter one applies.
---
I seem to recall reading that somewhere, probably here.
---
Awesome, good to know! Thanks for testing this so quickly, this eases my mind until I get on later to test some things myself
---
Yea I know that, I've done the ops, and the problem comes when the button is the same bind as grenades, has a weird cooldown to it, and causes more dr drop than shooting, also you need to get up close and tank a bunch of damage. it slows it all down way too much, which is the opposite of what Peircing Gaze was looking for
---
Same here, always. No matter if I clean my stuff out, hour later.. oh dang 1 pound away.
---
It would be too easy that way.
---
The Blood Eagle Paint on Handmade also has missing textures on the Silencer mod.
---
I fast travelled on one of the players from the daily ops public team
---
Try power armor with emergency protocols and blocker and get back to me.
---
You’re anecdotal example is nothing more than that. And your final sentence makes youre post really useless in general
---
Sure I’ll take a mirror!! Here is my shipping address ( 権堂2300, Nagano, 381-0833, Japan)
---
I just put myself into the OP’s shoe to say that
---
Have you got the perk card in intelligence for increasing their duration and the one in I think it’s strength for reducing the power consumption whilst sprinting?
---
Your main way to grind it is by doing the dailys and weeklies. The 10k xp is just a cherry on top you get from killing lots
---
I did it solo with a pistol build in 11 minutes. Was annoying but I won.
---
Reading is fundamental.
---
Yeah that ones is bugged for me too, and the overseers holo from Fort Defiance. Not looking forward to running through there again
---
I’m so fucking tired of constantly getting crap two/three star legendary pipe guns.
---
🤙🍻
---
The world is ending, though few believe it. For years, we dwellers have held firm against the wasteland. We have encountered no foe that bloodied explosive or magic weapons could not slay.
---
At least, that is what they taught you.
---
No one spoke of the deadly enemy now rising from beneath, and no one will be left to tell the tale, unless we can stem....the VERMINTIDE.
---
&gt; MELEE IS BROKEN. A lot of times attacking the enemy doesn't deal any damage even though you hit them. 
---
Exactly
---
Thanks, I'd like to hear what you come up with. I didn't get to try it with one-handed/two-handed melees, but it definitely feels like Ninja isn't working on unarmed at all.
---
Duty Calls. There is really only two enemies I truely dislike - Yao Guai and assaultrons.
---
I have one that I can let go for 5K
---
Yeah, I’m hoping my commando build is still viable, took me ages to get it to where I wanted it lol
---
You can still damage him, and make sure you're getting credit for the kill, it just does a fraction of the damage you can uncloaked.
---
Shoot their health to 0 - bash = success
---
Ok I will need to grind my daily’s if that’s your price
---
Three of us just took her out in about five minutes as opposed to two before the update....people are unnecessarily losing their mind
---
Damn! What have you been feeding it?
---
Guess it’s time to prime my shit
---
Good to know.  And as you said; if only the target range was increased.  Spotlights don’t seem to do much.  I’m constantly being hit from a distance where my CAMP is.  Part of it, is that people traveling to your vendors trigger the enemies, yet don’t bother to kill them.
---
It only works with weapons on your character ( not those in your stashbox) . It is also capped so you dont get the full 100% . I cant remember the exact cap but probably 90% as other poster say
---
They’re definitely killing faster for me. Usually my base gets attacked by 2 super mutants, and when the turrets start firing, I have enough time to go out and kill both of them myself. This time, when I stepped out, one was already dead and the second was almost dead too!
---
All carry weight reduction caps at 90%
---
If you can kill enemies with a melee weapon a few runs through the airport and other scorched based locations will get some .38 and .308 but it's a slow process.  
---
You can craft your own ammo but I imagine you'll have trouble collecting lead, steal, and gunpowder early on.
---
Honestly, player vendors might be your friend.  Not everyone sells ammo at this price but it isn't too tough to find .38, .308, 5.56 at 1 cap per round and you shouldn't pay more than 1 cap per round for those.  If you need help getting caps you can add water purifiers to your camp, they produce purified water which sell for a few caps each and you can stockpile a lot of them.  The biggest water purifier is pretty easy to find at camp McClintock which you get to early on in the game.
---
Maybe he forgot to add another 0 to the 1000?
---
Certainly does , my troubleshooters powerfist earned its place in the pantheon of weapons that suddenly became useful
---
A thought, do weapon bashes count? If so did bash damage just become a viable legendary stat?
---
I’m a Junkie, unyielding, stealth, mele build.  I’m not worried.  Other than bosses, I don’t see any issues so far
---
I understand what you mean, i was getting the health down for the melee guys but as you say, it's not that easy
---
Lul
---
I actually don't have Mr. Sandman equipped right now and I did remove and reequip Ninja to see if that would do anything, but still same results afterwards.
---
care to elaborate with context please?  Serious question.
---
Yeah I was only on 15 mins and hard crashed, xbox. Too soon to tell if this is going to continue. Hope not
---
Melee/unarmed are quite an oddity, as they scale directly with your strength stat. They also have dedicated mutations that buff damage. So, it seems odd that unarmed would feel especially weak right now. Maybe the damage formula for these weapon types need revisiting, I'm not sure. 
---
I've not tried the brawling chemist yet, but I've heard that exploding palm and collateral damage are a little underwhelming. I may need to conduct further testing myself.
---
it was my mods. lol.   
---
Also didnt allow my perk loadout manager to work, i had to remove my custom .ini to get everything to work right.
---
Because it makes to much sense
---
Yup they NERFED every single thing in the game
---
I hate people.
---
Lucky hole mine for lead and anywhere super mutants hang out for steel.
---
you should be able to load more plates and increase the stat lol
---
Im glad I clicked on this. And didnt just scroll past thinking someone had a bad attitude haha
---
I wonder what it says about Bloodied PA heavy gunner. It’s basically unaffected because it can tank the damage easy and now requires two shots from a 50 cal instead of one. In action it doesn’t matter, because you usually shoot two bullets anyway. The only difference is that now the 2nd bullet isn’t wasted.
---
I wonder what else you've missed.
---
Isnt that only a temporary buff?
---
Um.. get a melee weapon?
---
And here I was seeing all these “melee builds are Uber nerfed” posts. Devious melee builds raging on Reddit while pumping iron in expectation of one shotting everything.
---
I'm sure people will have better suggestions, but one of the legendary perks gives 40% extra ammo when crafting.
---
Ammo smith perk plus super duper also that new legendary perk for ammo. Then farm steel lead and acid.
---
&gt; don’t know how to remove it.
---
jfc how are they this bad at making games? how long have they been using this engine again??
---
haha - sorry - thats how we spell it in german
---
So you can come here to bitch but not find out if it'll cost you a point to unequip a card for a new system. Gotcha.
---
I bet it's just visual, but it is Bethesda tho
---
Thank you for the information that there is a misc quest related to Daily Ops.
---
Breaking terms and conditions is black and white.
---
Oh I could totally see that. I didn’t even think about the pvp aspect. I have only pvped a couple times and not even once since the Jetpack was released.
---
There is a slight, ever so slight, possibility they fix this tho.. wouldn't say rip just yet
---
Weight bench?
---
I used to spend so much time building. Got bored. Bow I use all prefab and communist fence
---
Where is the supposed fix for the BOS fatigues underarmor that got turned into an outfit but still weighs one pound and had the linings stripped?  The one you lazily repurposed into a reward for a so-called event with mismatched pants, almost two months ago.  Still 'looking into it'?
---
So go to the mission for excavator power armor. Then goto lucky hole mine and get all lead ore. When you get perk card super duper max it out. And you can have around 1k lead every run and then there’s another perk card in intelligence that’s called scrapper get that and go pick up every weapon a enemy drops and then when you scrap it you will get double the steel. Best way to do it. I use to use my melee weapons when I first started and ammo would build up. But once you start using it you will burn through it and now there is a legendary perk that gives even more ammo. There’s way man but it all depends on the level but the power armor I said you can get at 25 it’s prob one of the best. I still use it
---
This.
---
I run a bloodied commando build but had to go with PA and a vamp minigun for this. Yes, not my normal play but still good. Got lost a few times but finished in 12:09 with two of us stumbling through it.
---
I don't know why some players are saying it's the new meta when their accuracy still sucks.
---
Yeah no problem. It’s been called “the rug glitch” since fallout4, but honestly, this works with almost every single camp item or decoration, even signs for the wall conduits. 
---
Basically, place a conduit (small power connector) on a rug or any other object. Connect power to the conduit. Now, select the object that the conduit is on and move it over just an inch or so, and set it back down. Now pick it up a second time and place it anywhere at all in your camp, the wire won’t break. You can have the wire in the ground, through walls or other objects, through water, doesn’t matter, the wire will stay connected. Also works with switches and some other things.
---
But the key step is moving the “rug” (or other object) once with power connected to the conduit. If you don’t do that first, it won’t let you move it to places it’s not supposed to go.
---
It just never lets me switch like that anymore now, only been happening for the past week
---
Now try running daily ops lol.
---
A VATS/Critical build might work for you: Gun Fu in Agility, along with Grim Reaper's Sprint/Critical Savy/Better Criticals would make it much easier to deal with fast moving enemies. Having a high Agility and Perception would help with this build, especially for perks like Rifleman and Action Girl/Boy
---
Are they aware that literally no one gives a fuck about Charleston capitol building? The DMV quest is so mind-numbingly monotonous and lazy that I haven’t set foot in the building since November 2018 strictly out of hatred- yet it gets cosmetic updates in every other patch. Just put that same energy into things that matter.
---
Death by atomic felching
---
My second run I did solo and finished with a time of 8:53 so I think you could get the Elder time solo but it would be very tight. 2 man seems like it would be very easy to get under 8 minutes
---
Cause this hat is extremely rare and does not drop unless you get it as a reward rarely on a new level character: The VTU Baseball Cap is overly large. You can see under the hat a bit and see the cut off point of your hair when you normally wear a hat and is bad to see. The back of the cap (where a cap strap goes), you can see the bald back of your head in 3rd person. Some others say they don't see it on my character but I definitely see it. I can add inages if need to prove my point as well later.
---
I just scrapped animal friend 3.  Hopefully my mirelurk king doesn’t die before I get it back.
---
Dude bloodied is still good and wrecking most things... Even my Junkies is. Its your build not the nerf I'm afraid.
---
I feel you - my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet dropped by \~700 damage. Even worse, as a unarmed/sneak build, the Ninja perk doesn't seem to be adding any damage to sneak attacks for me.
---
I mean srsly, dang.
---
I somehow did it and I don't know how. I was glad it happened though. Saved me a lot of stimpacks
---
Yea I agree. I actually think this is the single worse combo of map+mutation+enemy. Normally OPs are too easy, but here it took me a few tries to get sub-8
---
You’ve gotta be kidding me. The insanely ridiculous damage nerf and now this? Once again, each patch ends up being a disappointment :(
---
Yeah I thought about that too.
---
It’s more of the meta for heavies. Usually range is not a factor, accuracy is not a factor.
---
Hell, it's about time.
---
&gt;One wasteland is healthy for the game.
---
Not if you drive off all the casuals who make up a significant portion of the playerbase. I suspect a massive number of the less vocal players enjoyed the more relaxed experience. That's pretty much gone forever now.
---
I'm not even speaking as one. Just noting this could be the case.
---
Never knew. Thats weird. Good to know it doesnt work anyway, thanks.
---
This is a troll right
---
1-shotting everything and needing 8 shots for a Liberator, if true, is a very heavy-handed swing.
---
I'm a glass cannon. My sole purpose is DPS so I don't use Dodgy, Serendipity or anything that reduces damage. If my Sneak build is taking damage I'm not sneaking hard enough. I don't run a tank bloody build so if I get one shot by a sneeze I may as well die for something. My death = more DR and Healing for my tankier friends. I'm not interested in QOL perks like MI or AF
---
when you ate rotten veggies or fruit while having the vegetarian mutation you didnt get sickness from jt
---
I wouldn’t rely on blueprinting, it’s not worked right since launch. Your camp looks small enough to rebuild no problem, I would just start over. The best thing about rebuilding is you can cater the build to your new location and change it up a bit. Every single brand new build gets you that much closer becoming a master builder, do embrace the challenge!
---
Yes, experience will reflect whatever level the enemy is at, so it’s meant to ease xp gain for higher level characters in previously weaker regions such as the Forest
---
Nah you stopped being able to like A week and a half ago sorry chief
---
I believe they changed into from circular to octagon, and yes, an octagon has less area than a circle of the same radius. That's just, geometry.
---
You are right and I am disgusted by my mistake.
---
Same here, i didn't even know what was wrong at first. Had a dozen glowing red enemies after me. I had a vampiric axe I got from earl so I brought it with me and got my ass handed to me over and over again. Just gave up in the end. I think I might just give the game a break for a while in general.
---
Dog...for real?
---
Like
---
For real?
---
Reward from new season
---
Next week most likely
---
Well if you’re in Xbox friend and we ever get playing at same time don’t be afraid to give me a shot. Gt is in post
---
thanks daddy
---
It's not the build. I've had the same build for a couple of months now. Was playing this morning before the patch and my DMG was 276 with my B2525 handmade. After the update I got on and didn't change a thing to my build and now I'm only doing 171 DMG. The build may still be good for others but I think this is a perfect time for me to try out another build.
---
100% agreed
---
Really? You don’t truly dislike mole rats?
---
You would love dark souls if you haven’t tried it yet
---
Worth a shot though, I’ll be testing it out with my vendors once I get a chance to start running them soon
---
 Sincerely, I can't wait to play before the enemies get nerfed.
---
Im sorry but I believe the board is gone.
---
I mean you had an entire week after season one ended to gather up your left over unlocks.
---
No you could still claim up until yesterday
---
The VTU hat has the wrong texture and gives your character a bald spot.
---
I think most weapons are now struggling to 1 shot most enimies with the new balance to damage multipliers. I remember someone saying that instigating wasn't performing so well on the pts because of those changes.
---
After running Westek I noticed the Super Mutants were way more agro. Plus lvl 100*** so it was fun. But ya, they were moving around more, less sitting looking dumbly into corners.
---
Season 1 is long gone, my dude. Claim your prizes as you earn them, and you'll avoid this type of issue in the future.
---
I actually can't believe the amount of people that have already demonstrated their non-ability to read by reporting that the "robots don't die when their health hits zero!!!!"  
---
Incredible, really.
---
No I went from 2k to 540 garbage now
---
Sofia?
---
‘Sever stability’ is not an excuse. There is no proof that this glitch affected it whatsoever.
---
wait, what's happening?
---
&gt;Or that's you projecting your own entitlement?
---
As entitled as any other player and customer. Don't forget this is a product and just because someone is dissatisfied doesn't mean their voice shouldn't be heard.
---
I also want my cake and eat it too.
---
Guessing pc? I know they said magic weapons are still a thing
---
Level 75....to YOU. What level will it be to the random scorched that wanders by? And what level will it 'see' on the scorched?
---
Nope gone they warned it would be gone on the 8th and it seems that they actually left it there for longer which was nice. I had to claim all mine then and heaps of people posted and added here all getting the answer its gone on the 8th. Do no bad blood .

Has anyone run into....\*peers\* R A D S C O R P I A N S?
---
The one in the bog , east of watoga train station,  6 mobs with 5 to 8 acid each, server hop repeat
---
Psst you forgot to change to your alt account...
---
I just tried it myself. Finished without dying. I like it. Will try again for a higher rank.
---
Trying to do daily quests is taking longer for me now, because I'm always going to run into things that can't be backhanded and beaten.  The Wolf Hoard thing took a full few minutes to do with each one being level 50 for me, as opposed to like level 5 and being beaten by near misses with exploding weapons.    
---
I'm not completely sure how I feel about it yet.
---
You did a good job white knighting them, though.
---
I thought this was already the case. 
---
I spent ages doing a fallout 4 garage prefab and had to redo it because it wouldn’t deploy with the Armco factory in it. 
---
This was a couple weeks ago. 
---
Maybe I’d just placed it oddly
---
I cannot tell if this is sarcasm or not cause it literally tells you this ACROSS THE FRONT on what modifiers are going on for that stuff. Like, just read. This is Fallout: you read stuff  c o n s t a n t l y
---
Since everything is additive now it isn’t worth the time investment.
---
Not in this update
---
and no r91 assault rifle , sad
---
It's a bullshit move on Bethesda's part. End game players that "earned" their power now have to use their top tier gear everywhere. It was nice to hang out in the Forrest &amp; Toxic Valley from time to time to just chill out &amp; play around with some of the other weapons in the game. Now to make it easier for those that don't want to have to "earn their stripes" to go into the bog &amp; the mire the end game players get penalized for being where they are.
---
The argument I keep seeing is something like my level 10 character gets smashed by level 50 mobs because a high level player went through the area before me. Well let me buy you a box of Kleenex &amp; a copy of Minecraft. Do they think that we didn't have to deal with the same shit or were all the mobs always low level for us when we started? I think not.
---
You went to certain areas at your own risk if you were too low level for it, or you learned how to survive &amp; fight if you encountered high level mobs in a low level area. it's all about learning to play the game and make do with what the game world gives you.  For over a year I never fast traveled, always walked everywhere to learn the map, discover unmarked locations, pathways off the beaten trail. I encountered plenty of high level mobs I wasn't a high enough level for or properly equipped to fight &amp; when I took them down I felt like I accomplished something. I remember well the first time I killed a SB in the game with nothing but a Fire Axe &amp; a shitload of stimpacks that was more than twice my level. The game photo I took afterwards is one of my most treasured "trophies" in the game. Or running into a group of high level Super Mutants at Grafton Steel or the Prison because a high level player had just passed thru...good times!
---
When I want a run for my money I hang out in the mire, the bog, the burrows, but I could always take a break &amp; just wander around in the Forrest and other low level areas to just relax in get in some game time. I earned that "privilege" as well as many others in the game as did many other end game players. Now the level 10's can go in the bog &amp; fight the SBQ or join ACP or other high level areas with their 38 pipe guns &amp; plink away at shit and their "contributions" if you want to call them that are minimal at best with the end game players carrying them so they can get the rewards handed to them by mommy Bethesda that we worked for.
---
Gone are the days of escorting a low level player into a high level area to help them power level by letting them "tag" mobs that were at my level, but much higher than they could handle. They just screwed themselves out of that.
---
It does make me curious as to why fixing this was such a priority, but Radiation Rumble is still apparently considered perfectly fine and working as intended.
---
Radiation Rumble is not played properly anymore, ever. It's literally just a huge XP farm, and there's no incentive to actually play the objectives. Indeed, anyone collecting ore misses out on tons of XP and potential legendaries.
---
The astronomically high failure rate of Radiation Rumble should be setting off alarm bells, and Bethesda's own internal data analytics would show this.
---
Enemies also should have a chance to give you ammo from the weapon you killed it with
---
My bloodied character does fine with mole rats.  There are perk cards like ironclad and blocker, I think another one I use is refractor.  With the right perk cards mole rats should not be an issue.
---
I agree. I've done it twice and it was fun. I can't wait to jump back in and see if it continues to hold up. lol
---
I like exploring and collecting things.  I liked playing a build based on a character concept. I liked experimenting with camp builds. I liked being able to go to one area for a challenge,  and to another area to  relax and resupply or fool around with weapons that i didn't usually use. I really liked the stories pre npc. Maybe I'll like having other people around once the BoS shows up. I liked not being forced to powergame.
---
I think bloodied builds are still at the top but not as good as they used to be, especially bloodied melee
---
For account unlocked items you should have them. As for lunchboxes, Scrip and bullion those are prob lost, or Zorbo got them on his way out.
---
Building a square in a circular space will lead to that, not much that can be done without fundamentally changing the outside shape of the structure as well.
---
Bloodied builds were hit the hardest but I doubt they have fallen from first place. Plus you get the added bonus of 30% more experience if you run unyielding.
---
You will just have to see for yourself, my dude.
---
Only played for 15mins, but yeah 1 hard crash. Xbox
---
Lol bloodie build complaining bout mole rat
---
I have a 3 star legendary pump action with explosive damage, and all of the suggested perks and each pellet is giving me around 15 damage? Is the mutant marksman the magic part?
---
Not gonna lie...
---
IM QUITTING THIS GAME 
---
Until tomorrow because I’m staying with family who are stuck on ADSL and it may take years to DL patch 22. 
---
Damn you BT!!!! 95% FTTC coverage my left ball.
---
I haven't noticed any change in the drain since the update and I haven't changed anything in my build or other things either.
---
Does it last longer or just resets the timer and gives more strength?
---
Didn't they say the Melee damage being so low was a error and would be adjusted?
---
Yep
---
I tried my vamps Fixer earlier. Still works as intended. Probably just a visual bug
---
Magic weapons still bugged. I still decimate everything with eyes closed with the only gun i've been using since 1 month after launch.
---
Balance patches never effect me. Kinda boring/broken.
---
Quick tip put on the rank one of each heavy gunner perks it doesn’t effect the dmg that much anymore at least currently
---
I’ve had a couple enemies that wouldn’t go down even with solid melee attacks ... the mechanics in this game aren’t refined enough to have this kind of mode. It punishes anyone who isn’t a melee build, it’s glitchy and it’s not fun when every enemy immediately attacks you. It’s a mess ... not sure why so many 76 fans are defending this shitty mode.
---
Wtf am I going to do with all this flux now?
---
As someone who is religious to energy weapons I am very happy that they fixed the Tesla tile issue, for example on radiation rumble if I use my automatic Tesla rifle I can obliterate large groups of enemies, but after discovering that it basically breaks the game I had to hide my power 😔 but we back ya’ll
---
Seeing as I'm in the Forest... 50 at the most. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
He's simply criticising the thing he bought, same principle as you criticising the game for example
---
How difficult are they you think? I know it says lvl 50+ but could my lvl 30 manage you think? A lot of challenges rely on Daily Ops and I don't want to start behind.
---
This is exactly why I checked the board again to make sure I didn’t leave anything. I was sure I got everything. But to my surprise I had one unclaimed item left. Even though I already claimed the Captain Cosmo suit, they added the helm to it later and you still had to claim it. Phew.
---
Only the one of the intelligence perk, I'm always over encumbered, I can't sprint anyway
---
Son, we've talked about this. There is enough in the damned fridge, stealing the hamster food is really not cool.
---
Sadly I am Xbox. How could you dm me? I would be happy to see it. Melee sounds good!
---
Herbivore and Carnivore allowed you to eat RAW food, neither helped you with Spoiled food.
---
My favorite so far is the ammo factory perk. With a faster firing rate .50cal I burn through ammo so fast.
---
Great if you can report back ;)
---
*Gestures out the window at literally everything*
---
I started with 500 5mm, now I’m at 8k
---
They are. People are just bitching because they actually have to work to kill things. I for one am enjoying not just killing shut in 1-2 blows. It makes the game more challenging and fun.
---
Edit: LMAO at the 👎🏻. Sorry so many of y’all need to work for things now.
---
Do you mean beyond the expected damage reduction that came with Patch 22, or are you not aware of that?
---
Rads, baby!
---
It is "really fun" tanking enemies endlessly for half xp (not really  killing any until the end anyway) or dying repeatedly to cheese the  timer.  I look forward to doing this everyday.  /s
---
Because your stupidity isn’t worth much effort?
---
And is that all you can do? Threaten me with down votes for a system that literally means nothing? I mean I guess the 17k karma I have kind shows a lot people agree with me. But that’s just as meaningless. 
---
So basically your lameness is to use the up/down vote to make me feel bad?
---
My god that’s just stupid and says more about you.
---
It’s a legendary perk added in today’s patch. Go to your perks, there’s an option above them for legendary perks.
---
Join a daily ops team and as long as others are with you then you should be fine with the new one wasteland scaling.
---
Only against a few enemies.
---
I've been in a server with 3 daily ops teams - there's no notification any of them are in daily ops, none seem to be there when i go in and i'm not even sure WHICH team would be in daily ops if i had more to choose from. 
---
The only indication seems to be a "{in daily ops}" message, which means nothing as it said i was in one when i was talking to Ward in Foundation!
---
I’m a stealth rifleman. The damage my rifle deals is extremely bad now
---
The ranks aren't shared, but the unlocked slpts are, so a fresh character still can still benefit from 6x rank 1 cards.
---
everything except Glaive can be sold and traded
---
dont bother, dude just sorts by new and acts like a shithead to all the people who dont like the change or arent as informed. he plays the subreddit, not the game.
---
Unless they changed it switching to live, on the PTS I went in at lv 2 fresh out of the vault with no weapons nor ammo on me against Resilient Super Mutants, and had no issue at all completing OPs. With a teammate you can easily complete to Elder since enemies scale to lv 5 when you're low level. The Resilient mutation also allows low levels to help since they need a 1hp damage to die once shot down, and unperked bare fists can achieve that much.
---
The most helpful thing you can do is standing by the uplink, it'll help it charge up way quicker, helping your teammates more than with kills since the enemies are endless.
---
Buy it from me (PS4) or do encryptid about 150 times....
---
Seems like TS triggers E two times and it's messing with the damage.
---
It could be the explosive shot ruining the shot damage. 
---
I’ve got a AAE pump shotgun that doesn’t deal near the same damage in or out of V.A.T.S as my MM pump shotgun.
---
DEATH RAY BUG ZAPPER? Shut up and take my money!
---
Do they require electricity?
---
I know that’s the one I’ve been looking forward to the most since I saw angry turtle using it on the PTS, also funky duds and master infiltrator should be amazing. I have an old Xbox so it’s still updating lol
---
Finally I can have my paralysis demon at the foot of my Fallout bed.
---
It’ll be here waiting for you
---
Unstoppable Monster https://imgur.com/gallery/aq9zwBj
---
I'll post a comment I made in another post which sums up why I dislike it:
---
The game is one big grind. Most online games are. I’ve noticed single player games tend to be better for people that don’t like that.
---
Right now it’s robots, so you’ll have to deal with a lot of gutsies who can penetrate 100% of your armour, so they’re pretty difficult if your low lvl
---
Just don’t use an energy gun. Ez
---
I acually competed it twice for two accounts for the first season. The second account I just did the dailies and weeklies (less than 30 minutes per day) and still finished a week early.  If you can focus on the dailies and weeklies, shouldn't be an issue.
---
Sweet, I've been lugging around a two shot forever. Great for clearing large interiors so you can still find the bodies
---
Lv 75 ghoul barely gave more xp than an old lv 62 one. I think it gave like 5 to 10 more, but it's there.
---
make sure it is powered. 
---
restart game.
---
try someone elses shower
---
Fucking idiot
---
Refused? No. And why do you say the engine can barely handle NPCs. Ok I’m done feeding the troll..
---
Would recommend badcompanyasarg on yt or captinnoob for wepons they do some great work they do
---
[What?! But you can't do anything in this game without the menu. How have you survived all month?](https://youtu.be/Ye2u1za7Pac?t=296)
---
Todays Op:  Kill only with melee, also stand next to this thing, also the robots won't come anywhere near you.
---
Good game design there.
---
Nice to see some positivity! Im a bloodied build but i think this wont be a big deal and in a week will be the new norm.
---
that's true indeed.
---
I wanna know how to get into one with others. Or do I just have to be lucky and start hoping others are already there
---
Does it at least tell you it's locked, or does it make it look like there's no lock?
---
AT seemed to have tested it in one of his vids and it seems to confirmed that TSE is not quite doing what its supposed to be
---
I don’t really have a specific build, just main rifleman and shotgun backup.  Noticing that my ts shotgun needs twice the amount of ammo to knock things out now and enemies are laying me out left and right. ( mostly in events where that never happened). My armor is wearing out twice as fast.  I’ll probably spend some time on switching to a full on shotgun build and finally upgrade to ss armor once I can get all the mods (bullion cap)
---
There are multiple valid reasons why people quit. Broken score system, can’t fast travel, can’t progress story because it’s broken, ungodly amounts of bugs and glitches. A weapon nerf though? How tf did a weapon nerf break you out of the infinite amount of problems this game has?
---
If you joined a server with 20 plus, maybe. I never saw that many personally. Having less than 5 did not effect the server at all. Maybe the initial load time was longer, but that’s it.
---
Yup.
---
That moment when ants take out a massive hulking lizard beast that's so deadly they put death in its name.
---
flooded trainyard to be specific, game was patching still and couldn't look
---
One of my only complaints. That nice!
---
If I'm reading your post correctly, you're not leaving the game. You're starting a new character for One Wasteland is what it seems like. In that case, good on you!
---
What are you going to make?
---
Any idea what they're actually claiming you did?
---
Nature is healing 💕we are the virus
---
Oh no, I need more of the imaginary bullets I use that cost me nothing to actually make to kill creatures that don’t actually exist.
---
You have confirmed this?
---
Ammo factory, lockpick hacker one, survival shortcut, no rads and electric absorb. I'm a heavy guns PA user.  There very good for my build.
---
I'm a junkie tank, rads dont effect me hardly and heal themself, I can make mountains of ammo. Survival shortcut allows me to kill off the food and water mechanic and stop having to carry food water and lockpick one is super QoL. I value QoL over most tho.
---
Personally the Special stat ones are kinda pointless the game even after update is still easy with proper build.
---
It’s all the weapons on your person (the you’re carrying). It does not apply to items in your stash box. 
---
The weight reductions work off the reduced amount so it breaks down like this.  Let’s say you have 100 pounds of weapons on you. 
---
First 20% reduction makes everything weigh 80
---
Second 20% takes 16 pounds off (20% of 80 pounds) so now it weighs 64
---
Third 20% takes off 12.8 pounds so it’s now down to 51.2 pounds
---
Fourth 20% takes off 10.2 pounds so now it’s 41
---
Fifth 20% takes off 8.2 pounds so now it’s 32.8 pounds. 
---
This is how it was explained to me forever ago; if someone has better/different info, please let me know
---
I know what I'm putting in my secret room now
---
I can deal with vats not working 70% of the time and stealth being disabled in Daily ops when I'm playing a stealth commando but when you have to melee them to kill them and 50% of the time my hits don't register, thats when I get pissed
---
The ones I’m most excited to use is master infiltrator so I don’t have to swap in the picklock or hacker perks anymore, also ammo factory and funky duds for poison resistance.
---
Yup, that’s all you need now
---
Ah man of few words
---
Rose, make of grafton, and Beckett are the only ones I like in the whole game. Hopefully there are some good BoS npcs on the way.
---
To do these as a group, do you need to make the group first or is there a matchmaking/ waiting area before the timer starts?
---
To everyone trying to clown me on my post let me elaborate a little more for you. In life dont we all try to be the best we possibly can right? I have another hobby and thats racing. I dont get behind the wheel of my car and race for participation trophies. I race to win period. I apply that same mentality to everything including this game. So yes i wanna win i dont wanna finish 2nd. So the real ones complaining are the losers. The squishy food builds that didnt set the high dps goals like i do. I wanna melt the queen in 30 seconds or a sheep in 30 seconds and slap down earl in seconds as well. Thats what winners do they win. So for your to basically telling me that my damage is cut in half is pathetic to even things out. When you have a v8 would you still wanna race if they told you to cut your motor in half because its not "fair" and makes to much power?! Heres an idea to the shitty players...get good! Grind hard like i did to get where i am. Start trading see what stack with what and what works the best in situations. Not complaining because we can melt everything. This game has gone to hell because of these constant "balances" in power and ive had it. This era of participation trophies needs to stop.
---
i can finally become an ammo salesman fuck yeah !
---
Nice job man.
---
I sometimes sneak around peoples CAMP and peep through their windows to take pictures of their bottoms. Camera Film is gold.
---
Ahh. That is good :) Then I dont have to do to many of these ops. (They are awful :P)
---
Or you could just hang in there and see what the next phase of balancing/rebalancing things is gonna do.
---
Overall should be more xp simply from trash low level mobs no longer being a thing. 
---
So even if lvl100 super mutant isn't an xp fountain all the mutant hound that are now 60 - 100 instead of 25 will provide a solid xp boost.
---
No more low lvl mole rats, rad roaches, etc etc
---
get more people to stand next to it 
---
which you cannot do if you're solo =0
---
As others have said its all weapons and capped at 90%. Also, its important to know that 90% is unmodded base weight. Added mods will not recieve the weight reduction. Something to keep in mind.
---
Are you even able to define "Using exploits and cheats"?
---
I pray this is factual...
---
In power armor only. I really only use PA against Earl where that is useless.
---
Good thing you can complete the Battle-pass without doing those challenges. I think i will stick mostly with the usual challenges.
---
Not really fan of swarms of auto-gun Gutsies...
---
9 Ultracite cores?
---
Prime Vampires Gatling go Brrrrrr
---
what exactly are magic weapons?
---
Shut up ASHLEY
---
Oof ): yea i was ready for the change but this isn't what i was expecting
---
You can put i.e. 3 points for legendary strength and add 3*heavy gunner?
---
I just logged on now to try a daily ops, I’ll probably be on from 8 or 9pm to 12am central time? Feel free to just add me as a friend if you want, I prefer playing solo but don’t have any problem with you adding me to join on the same server or be in a public team. :)
---
claim the ammo factory. you may have to kill like 5 guys, grab a board and get to whacking if you have to
---
No reason they can't both be terrifying
---
One Wasteland is definitely nice in regards to events. Now I won't have to auto-dump those legendaries from Radiation Rumble since they'll be a usable level. A+ move there for sure.
---
Oh no... they were already a nightmare 😭
---
GunFu negates that bug
---
I'M LOVIN' IT!
---
Anti armor and explosives
---
I've been wondering where he is too. I'm sure in one of Juicehead's videos he spoke to the daily ops guy face-to-face, but haven't run into the NPC yet.
---
I'm fine if it takes me 20 minutes! Just the way it stands it's not even worth doing... The damage is simply not there. And if this is what they intended in the first place, I dont understand why it took them 2 years to do it. It's no ones fault but Bathesdas for letting people get used to the game with the former damage formula... I'm gonna keep playing. Its just lost fun for me. Everything in the game was a tedious grind, but going and slaughtering some boss's speed run style was fun. Now even killing enemies isn't fun anymore. The entire game is just an addiction that's lost its needle... This is just my opinion. I don't think the games gonna die. Just lost a lot of fun for me.
---
I would say stick with it. Your still doing a shit ton more damage than other builds, if my bloody gladiator was anything to go by. It looks like instigating and anti armor are the way to go for trash mobs, and bloodied for big boys. I feel you though. I expected the nerf, accepted it, understood it...then I saw my damage numbers T_T
---
That coupled with rubber banding health bars...tears I tell you.
---
Oregon did too, in theory, but our unemployment department makes Bethesda look competent.
---
Here's to hoping everything works out though.  \*raises a nukashine\*
---
I had to before, i can't solo any end game bosses, but i WAS able to do damage.. now? Nope.
---
A colossal problem boss fight has a bunch of wendigos. I got 100 screws from looting them one time
---
My man, go fight the colossus. They will help you.
---
That's interesting, I wonder why your exceeded max level in the forest? Now I'm curious what my King is going to look like! JUST finished the download!
---
You did not say what kind of build/char you play, so I guess you want some generic tips. You could try to spare some of the lower level bots at the start while you do the necessary steps to pass the first grid, but I am not even sure this is valid anymore after One Wasteland - they might be max level now and make it hard to ignore.
---
Anyway, some generic tips: if you are not in PA, equip at least some pieces of troubleshooter armor to help a lot with damage reduction from bots and turrets. If you have 5, only assaultrons are a threat anymore. 
---
While you are scanned in the room with the biometric scanner - place your PA in the doorway to block robots from entering.
---
If you got lockpick 3 and hacker 3, you can bypass the reactor repair - just turn left once inside the reactor room and pick the level 3 lock you will find at the next door. Proceed inside, hack the terminal and override reactor security.
---
If one of the launch commanders gets destroyed, you can order a replacement at the corresponding terminal. If you got all of them, it speeds up the prep process but you are able to complete it with fewer. Otherwise it is pretty straightforward... or at least it was, did not launch yet after the update.
---
I feel more powerful than ever before as a Full Health PA Heavy Guns build.
---
Ork mentality. If more dakka can't fix it, then it can't be fixed!
---
But, my 1st Op it didn't read much about op on the map screen. Just clicked join and expected a primer or something. Started shooting robots, getting overwhelmed then realized I needed to switch to melee. Then I watched my grognak axe glide thru robots like they weren't there.. yay server lag? 
---
Not sure I like resilient cause my melee weapons sucks. A fast swing Nocturnal Grognak that I thought was amazing many levels ago. A vampire mr handy for funsies, before One Wasteland.. now it makes me sad to use. And a vampire deathclaw.
---
Huh?
---
Are the goggles with the outfit the glowing ones??
---
Thanks, really appreciate you taking the time out to look 👍
---
Only works on lasers but it’s a great perk. Some lasers still do damage instead of healing though. Like the ceiling/wall turrets in the silos.
---
Hahaha inb4 "HuRrR TSE iS dA NeW MeTa, Take ThaT BlOodY BuiLDs"
---
Charleston Herald and the Charleston Capitol building have a lot of typewriters
---
Chicken wings. Rad sauce. Simple 
---
10% buff on falling damage.
---
There. That work wasn’t that hard.
---
(Btw...I renamed my chicken coup Zaxbys)
---
Those perks got axed
---
No problem! I now exclusively do underground wiring at all my camps. It saves a lot on budget and you never see any wires
---
New copies are like $20. You’ve got nothing to lose.
---
Nah stealth attacks had a huge multiplier. Now it's not so much... you wouldn't notice it with heavies, since they aren't sneaky guns.
---
I believe the weapon nerf hit.
---
Well I might be wrong here, but I’m pretty sure it still is took up budget. So unless there was another budget exploit when this became popular, people would be stopped when they maxed out their budget, thus not affecting server stability. Again, might be wrong here.
---
Nothing is giving me a score increase, stopped playing for today will try again later in week.
---
I'm going to sell them or trade them off, sorry hun.
---
They used to be one of the best, before bethesda realized that the damage was multiplying by the amount of pellets instead of being additive. So the "nerf" was really just fixing them.
---
There's still nothing that outclassed a shotgun for crippling enemies though.
---
So they have really nerfed weapons, or the enemies stand more hits? Basically the same on the other hand...
---
As a junkie PA buuld I'm shredding and legit never die.
---
Honestly bloodied been meta for what billion years now maybe it's time to switch. It still does most dmg from what I've heard your just actually a glass cannon now. 
---
It's high risk high reward style. Unlike before u could stack things to a insane degree 1 shotting in stealth and never die.
---
Please, for the love of all that is good, read the Patch Notes before playing.
---
Yeah, they're pretty cool! You can see a preview for them in the atom shop
---
Well I sure as hell didn’t know
---
I wish you could reprogram robots.
---
I would change an Annihilator Sentry Bot's settings to "loyal as a puppy", name him Freckles, and leave him to guard my house.
---
That's fair- I'm sure they'll take a balancing step in the near future. I will say though, even as a commando main I was able to powerfist my way through the Ops with time to spare. Thankfully it seems like that's still enough to kill most things just fine, so at least it's not so bad that you'd miss out.
---
To be fair I also didn't look that hard so meh
---
Trucks are not nature. This is clearly optimus prime on vacation to see his brother Liberty.
---
Probably explains why in the patch notes.
---
Anything that uses ap will eat through fusion cores. Vats will absolutely destroy them. I made the mistake of using PA on my gunslinger and it ate about 10 cores in a few minutes.
---
Yeah my súper sledge went from 1600 to 500 per hit xd but I still one shot critters so I’m not complaining
---
Pretty much all events give equal-ish xp now, however, meaning you might as well just maximise your rewards by not bothering with high-effort less-reward ones. Especially when in many you are the only one who even tries to accomplish objectives.
---
Also don't forget not everyone is swamped in notes. Personally I could use a few hundred more.
---
Then adapt
---
Like explosives, as in the Fat man? Or the legendary add-on?
---
You must have joined well after Encryptid was added. I still see players to this day tracking an invincible, invisible boss around the zone and blasting away without reading the text on screen
---
Aaaaand now I regret trashing the 20 bashing weapons during the scrip sale.
---
They fixed that. It was worse before.
---
Im most likely going to try and trade it when I discover what I want. Sorry hun

Good thing I learned the recipe for Tato Salad from Meat Week!
---
Handmades and sledges: Guys, I can explain!
---
Flamers: You are getting 10 skins? I only have 3!
---
50 Cal: 3? I only have 1!
---
LMG: You guys are getting skins?
---
Not working for me either. And yes I've used it so many times, so I know how it works.
---
Yeah exactly! And everywhere I go I have a potentially difficult fight on my hands. Didn't realize how much more enjoyable this would make the game.
---
Server stability is a valid reason, it's just not one you want to use. Just because you didn't see the impact doesn't mean it wasn't an issue elsewhere, even if just on the backend (which we already know is held together by duct tape and broken dreams).
---
It also can have an effect on player ammo markets, and could be turned in at the ammo converter for other ammo types not made by the ammo factory (mini nukes, 40mm grenades, etc). 
---
An exploit is an exploit. It being deemed "harmless" by some players does not negate that fact.
---
Anything else in the Patch Notes you'd like to tell us about?
---
Oh yeah, weapon bashing is a thing.
---
Aye! Living the dream, slinging lumber! How are you my man?
---
Why would they make skins for guns that don’t have skins yet?  The data shows that we only buy skins for the guns that have skins already :)
---
I’m in the same boat as you (I’m a bloodied pistol build so this nerf basically crushed me). However I have some hope because Bethesda acknowledged that stuff is underpowered right now, but that this additive damage change will make it easier for them to buff what needs it. So I’m sure the stuff that got ultra-nerfed with this will be given buffs as people play and give feedback.
---
Nah we got fixer skins this patch
---
True but if you like using a verity of weapons with rare ammo types it's a bit of a must
---
Yes. You know what they are too so you fuck all with this, define cheats and exploits. 
---
My word what a stupid thing to say.
---
Yeah but in the pictures they aren’t glowing. So I wasn’t sure. I don’t want them if they don’t glow red
---
News since the roadmap saying when they'll be released you mean? If so no because the roadmap kinda covered it.
---
So if im looking for "out and about armor"
---
what is better?    Unyielding weapon weight        or        unyielding plus stealth
---
The new NPC is in the Watoga Towers
---
I don't really care about military or commie stuff, but man some of the generic camp objects this season look really nice. Last season was enjoyable and I'm sure this one will be no different. It will be nice seeing more people on playing, too.
---
Just buy from someone else
---
I like to make new and interesting camps every month or so and try to blend them into their environment. Last camp was a hunting lodge in the mountains and currently I built a strip club, more funny then functional. Over the last almost two years I’ve built a church, a school house, an artillery battery, military check point, train station, built up in the power pylons. I’ve built all across the map, each build is unique and take me between 8-16hrs to complete
---
resets the timer and gives more points
---
What about the Fixer ?;) to be fair the lmg doesn’t even get mods ha
---
Watch Angry Turtle's most recent YouTube videos.  He breaks down his options from numerous tests on the PTS.
---
Join a Daily Ops public team. After you join you'll be able to see which of them are in an op. If no one is and then one of them joins one, you'll get a popup in the upper left corner. Good etiquette would be to only join one when you are ready to do one and then leave when you are done.
---
Shoot one. Pause. It will heal itself.
---
Not really. I only dislike them when doing events and they refuse to pop out.
---
i dont give a fuck about op lol. i just personally think youre cringey and annoying. calm down.
---
Just sit to 1 hp then a quick bash with your gun. 
---
It's not rocket science.
---
Take one for the team, Electric absorption, sizzling style, Funky Duds, and maybe two of the special Legendary perks. You could do ammo factory swaps when you need, it’s only one perk coin.
---
My handmade was over 500 this morning but still melts most things. Something is off with your build because 276 on a bloodied handmade is mediocre.
---
People are still figuring out we had an update today. Let's wait a bit before discussing future content.
---
Well how observant of you to point out the main point of a joking post I made.....Wow.....Such a scholar......Maybe take that rude shit somewhere else bub
---
Depends on what plans you are talking about. If you're talking about the new rare rewards, you have to be over lvl 50. If you're talking about the old weapon and armor plans, then  you have to be under lvl 50.
---
This.  Does anyone keep a brahmin because they need fertilizer?  It's all about the milk.  Make the chickens give us some eggs, and add a couple of useful recipes which use them to the game.
---
Welp quitting fallout again
---
RadAway works as intended, my concern is on the camp item. I don’t carry a ton of rad away, and I’m usually going back to my camp to restock on food and cure my rads with the shower. 
---
It’s not game breaking, but it’s also something that is not working as intended at the moment
---
3 options here
---
He was killed by npc enemies. Nothing you can do about that but to visit camp regularly and heal him up with the Friendly Fire perk card + Shishkebab
---
Some player used explosive bait to kill him. They made explosive baits not to trigger the explosion effect when thrown on a C.A.M.P. build area. BUT if your pet's patrolling right on the edge of your build area, he could be reached by the explosion from outside your camp radius.
---
Your camp budget. Tamed creatures might disappear if you go over 90% of camp budget.
---
Make or join a group first.
---
Yes, they are really hard and in the first attempt I died a couple of times. But the ops are really cool. I like the challenge.   
---
the today’s combination is the worst I could imagine - did it 4 times and the best result was 9:49 minutes in a group of 3 players
---
It clearly proved false the arguments that too many items in one spot crash the servers. When you have 150+ meat piles in close proximity, each with several items "in" it, that's about as taxing as you can get in this argument about the item quantities.
---
Where else in the game are modifiers used in the game like they are in this mode. It needs a quick pop up at the start of the event that explains it for first time players. The in-game event description is vague if you don’t know what you’re looking at. 
---
Regardless, the mode is glitchy, has minimal storyline and simply isn’t fun to play if you’re a stealth or non-melee build player. Using melee attacks from guns is hit or miss. This is exactly the type of event that reminds me why I dislike ESO vs Skyrim. It’s sloppy, it has not attachment to actual Fallout gameplay, and it’s definitely not fun to solo when you’re mobbed and keep dying.
---
Haha damn!
---
May the rat be forever cursed with never ending mini nuke quest rewards...
---
Finally, someone else who is a full PA HG build.. its been a lonely world.
---
If you know you are up against robots (enemies rotate for daily ops), it pays off to have some pieces of troubleshooter armor in the stash to minimize damage received. A weapon bash finishes them off once their hitpoints are down, so a melee weapon isn't really necessary.
---
LOL, you're adorable.
---
I think my only annoyance with this is that, if I switch to a melee weapon to finish the enemy off, I seem to get random ammo rather than ammo for whichever gun I took the enemy's health down with. As a result I end up having to use slow gun bashes to ensure enemies drop the right ammo.
---
Now i can move my tent
---
No, never copied the munitions factory. Didn’t want to get banned or risk anything. I’m melee, so I don’t really use ammo.
---
oh okay, Thanks!
---
I was getting over 5k exp per wave with my build. Super high Intel, lunchboxes, and a flaming bow.
---
Oh, like a BRIGHT glow?  I dunno.  I'd wait a few hours and find youtube vids of people showcasing the new atom shop items so you can judge for yourself.
---
If you're anything like me then take one for the team, follow through and 4 special stats of your choosing. Lots of people seem to want ammo factory but it seems like a complete waste to me. A nice QOL perk sure, but you can buy ammo with cap. You can't buy more legendary perk points so easily...
---
That's the way it's intended. The killing blow must be melee but you can get them down to 1hp with ranged. They actually show this in the develop demo from last week's Inside the Vault.
---
Thanks for the insights. Yes I knew that about it being the same for everyone, I just mentioned it for others who didn't try it yet. 
---
I did use PA. It was the first time playing a Daily Op and I just went it to see what it's all about. I got my ass handed to me.
---
Oh fuck... I forgot about those...
---
Welp, scout master Pompy, looks like you’re on your own cleaning up that toxic snot for the foreseeable future.
---
You don't know that.
---
Downvote me but i prefer doing the event the way as intended, by shooting them from afar way before they get to the sonar machine.
---
More time consuming without the exploit? Totally. More fun though. And at the end of the day, this is what I am here for.
---
All things are not equal with two shot explosive. Bloodied does more damage than two shot, but two shot explosive is doing more damage than bloodied explosive.
---
I think what they're having a hard time with is "reading."
---
It's spelled Earle and no it's not that hard.
---
Not really, this game wouldn't be live still without all the glitches
---
Is that one of the legendary perks?
---
I wouldn’t say it’s barely noticeable, as my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet went from doing 2k damage to barely 500. I personally don’t like the nerf, I get it 2k is way more damage than it should be, but it was balanced with having minimal hp. Now I have minimal hp and I don’t do that much damage. I hope Bethesda will address this shortly
---
I’ve burned through prob 500+ and only got the shotgun once, no revolver.
---
Even without the bugs the budget you get is almost non existent.
---
Wish i could help you out but i know when i joined a team we ran three and everytime i joined them when it said they were in daily ops they were actually there.
---
I didn't even know what button bash was when I went into my first Daily Ops this morning  😂   
---
Definitely an oopsie moment.
---
It had to be said; you were the hero we needed all along.
---
That's a great tip too.
---
I did not confirm this, but I heard from a friend that you can force item respawn in a world if you collect 150-200 items in outside world, I mean junk items lying around
---
 Have 5.
---
First is Taz, a goody goody 150-ish commando rifleman that still thinks the world can be a good place again.  Usually struts around in his enclave getup. Recently discovered chems, and falling fast heh.  Dork.
---
Second is Tazera, crazy lady 180-ish melee.  Loves to f everything up, may have a thing for Meg, not quite sure.  Feels kindred spirit with the Raiders. Helps settlers only when it suits her purposes.   Knows the world has moved on, in it for the next fix and slash/crush/boom. 
---
Third is Pistol Pete.  A wiseass but brilliant and known for his survival skills.   Was surprised when he was asked to be part of vault 76, never knew his insanely rich uncle bought his way in thinking they would need someone with street smarts when they emerged.  Had a brief fling with a hot momma and picked up her junkie habits.  Sadly, she was killed during one of their Palace of the Winding path runs 😢
---
Now he spends his chem hazy days rage hunting feral ghouls.
---
Fourth is T-dog, loves the heavies in and out of PA.
---
Fifth and current is level 20 Zack.  Zack hated the vault with its recirculated air and fake sunshine.  One with the outdoors, only eats veggies, and keeps to himself.  He got a bow plan from his friends at the wayward, and is currently working on Bowcraft. 
---
I basically create and level them to learn how the various build types work.
---
Only base damage is modified by legendary effects. 
---
In your case id guess the combo of higher base damage on fixer plus explosive is outweighing the bloodied bonus on combat rifle. 
---
A be combat rifle though should out damage the fixer.
---
Well shit, didn't know that, but since it was in the notes I'm gonna guess water is now wet
---
That is a great rule of thumb, however the ammo factories are a form of griefing. You could join a private team, place ammo factories in a camp to push them over budget, then they were impossible to delete by the player-owner.
---
I have a ts shotgun and confirm it’s struggling.  I also have a tse in stash I’ll test out later.  I am not exclusively a shotgun build though but thinking about it
---
Enjoy the Cava and relax into it. Have fun and enjoy the new challenges. Also, maybe consider well chilled New Zealand Sauvignon....
---
Haha that’s it I’m done. It’s been fun guys
---
Someone is in for a surprise...
---
Equip defensive perks, use vampires weapon, don't try to kill every enemy (they will just keep spawning more), move as quickly as possible from objective to objective, concentrate on surviving more than killing = 7min clear.
---
EDIT: Use troubleshooters armors or power armor (even if you are not PA character). Even as a bloodied character it's better to survive than to try and stay below 20%, heal your self to around 50%.
---
Yeah just go buy 1 bullet.
---
I ran straight to each objective and killed everything faster than a team could. You straight up can't get under nine minutes solo.
---
Look up a rifle man build on youtube, there ya go
---
They got nerfed buddy
---
it's sturdy
---
Hey... We play a game that emulates a world on fire right? Life imitating art. Maybe it'll make us appreciate our characters lives a bit more having lived our own! 
---
And I loled at the Oregon/Beth comment... When we start comparing Beth to government were in trouble 😂
---
Brilliant!  Thank you!
---
I got it with the pack that gave the moth man jet pack. Never used them tho. I was hoping the clock and door would be in the new bundle. Unless there’s new ones
---
Definitely not my budget (I’m using about 70%) so it must have been one of the first two options.
---
That stinks. But thanks for the info. I had seen other players try to shoot him but I didn’t think they could kill him.
---
Ooooh, okay then.
---
There's a genuine market/desire for a power trip game where you can go around destroying everything by squinting at it. But this isn't the game for that. If you enjoy flying around with a scattered .50 call that blows everything up, fallout 4 is the game for you. You can do it with console commands there instead of trying to force it in a game like this
---
Hey my friend totally agree with you but this sub can get toxic due to keyboard warriors with to much time on there hands. At the end of the day each to there own . We will still melt anything we come up against so slowly slide a middle finger up to the haters . Chat soon my friend 😉
---
Looks like it got the moderators in the second half, whatever it was!
---
Dats tuff
---
Big if true
---
Well I was full life, not really specced up to tank since it was our first try. I have born survivor 3, ricochet 3, the new legendary perk that heals you when in PA and getting energy damage. You could beef that up with dodgy and some chems like buffout.
---
You need to reach the 300/300 dr which is fairly attainable with some mutations (scaly skin/grounded + strange in numbers) and some basic gear. A mix of vanguard/bolstering pieces will reliably push you to these values. Food is also useful as some of them with either carnivore or herbivore will bump your SPECIAL quite nicely (+7.5 END with a scorchbeast lung iirc).
---
Don't be afraid to join a public team, even if your build is not top tier :)
---
you almost had me there
---
I don't think they intended solo players to be able to do every event or you'd get people complaining it's too easy. It took a couple of tries but I've gotten elder with a random from a public daily ops team.
---
Yep i love it too. The forest is relevant again too! Logged on and decided to bang out a few challenges right away, went to the forest to capture the food factory and do fertile soil event in flatwoods, figured they'd be easy peasy.
---
Nope, took me awhile, almost died several times, used tons of ammo and stims (i was being sloppy not expecting any challenge)
---
Loved every second of it. Great patch.
---
Tell that to Epic.
---
Patch 23 Notes: Fixed an exploit that allowed players to make events like Line in the Sand too easy. Collision meshes for fences and other static objects now extend to the height limit.
---
You could already have done that with Season 1 though. People finished like 3 weeks early.
---
dont lie
---
what
---
+8 wood scraps added
---
There’s an old atom shop item where they glow red that I missed. Always really wanted it. 
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if the new icon shows them glowing, but they don’t actually. Rip off.
---
Yeah look forward to that in a few years. They move like glaciers to fix actual problems while piling more and more nonsense on top of things.
---
Hm. Maybe levels aren't scaling down properly. I saw another post of someone seeing way overlevelled enemies in forest. 
---
Dang. Not much you can do at that level since you've got a ways to go to unlock levels :(
---
Hmm, sounds promising. Sounds like bloodied still very viable.
---
It’s not that hard, focus on the waves then on Earle, they arent unlimited
---
The game wide nerf that went live today maybe. Complete rework that changed how damage is calculated. It's been a huge topic for a couple of months now.
---
naw. it was just to make sure it wasn't the rads you had. So it's definitely the shower.
---
Im just going to spend the next few days working towards finishing my secret service armor and finally reaching high enough level with foundation for the guass shotgun see how that treats me
---
I genuinely hope this post is a joke, cause oh my goodness the grammer, the blindness of not reading update notes, everything.
---
WTF WHY
---
&gt;If they impact performance on the server, they negatively impact others, period.
---
I agree, and the first time I saw an ammo farm camp, I was a little annoyed because I thought it might cause server stability issues.   But thinking about it... there are 21 workshops in the game, and they typically have  5 resource nodes.  Each server can also have up to 24 players, each with a resource node or two at their camps.  So a maxed out server might have roughly 125 extractors running.  
---
Even when the daily challenge was to claim a workshop, I rarely saw more than 5 claimed at a time on the map, and usually people would claim them without investing any effort into building extractors.
---
So it is highly unlikely that a few extra extractors were causing server stability issues.  But you know what?  We'll find out.  Keep an eye on things this week, and compare it to last week.  I doubt we'll see much of a change.
---
Blue screws? No. But if you want regular old loose screws you can try your hand at the Colossal Problem event when it happens. The wendigos drops screws and there are plenty there, just dont die before you make it out or you may lose your junk inventory.
---
Can you go to The Bunker and test theirs (if you don't want to camp hop)?
---
Actually it was stolen from builders in real life
---
Complaining already?  That’s a record
---
Remindme! 4 days
---
the reason for this is how they calculate weapon degradation. in Fallout 3 and NV, it was calculated by how many rounds you fired. in 76 it is calculated by how many times you hit an enemy. with a normal weapon, you would get x amount of condition removed per shot, but with TSE, it is 4 times that as you have the 2 bullets hitting as well as the explosive damage. so your weapon degrades a lot faster
---
Yep. It’s not that good though honestly. I’d recommend hack and slash though.
---
It is a de buff on the target so everyone benefit of it. And it stacks with follow through if a stealth commando shoot your target too
---
Correct
---
Lol I actually understand that reference..
---
Adhere to t&amp;cs- no ban
---
Break t&amp;c through exploits- ban
---
I'd love to hear your side of it.
---
what grammer
---
Fucking this right here, the only way to beat it is to put on PA and spam stimpacks.
---
Yeah it was working with my power fist, although I like my junk not launched around the room. I am unsure if demolition expert increases the damage though.
---
Hehe.. naw
---
So basically it increases the amount of ammo you produce each time. I have mine ranked 3 and I make 100% more ammo each time.
---
Even better.
---
I've noticed I'm using much more ammo too, and my weapon is breaking far more often, and I've just been doing a few dailies since the update.
---
Oh, I thought they nerfed it again. It's what I use and top enemies it's basically useless, but there's a lot on the game that doesn't work.
---
Unless you're a heavy weapon user or full auto the ArmCo machine from the raiders can really help out. Also carry a good melee weapon and use that when ever you can. Lots of stuff is easy to kill without even needing any melee perks.
---
&gt; What did they do to you, Not buy your over priced ammo??
---
Is not buying ammo from me because they are exploiting free ammo having a negative affect on me? Does that not have some affect on the economy?
---
Hardest hit? Damn
---
Literally look it up smart guy
---
I work for Bethesda on the weekends.  We try really hard, but spreadsheets are a hell of a drug
---
I don't use any chems, buffs or stuff like that because the 276 was doing what I needed it to. Nothing fancy. I got the build advice from here but like I said doesn't mean the build is bad I just want to try something new.
---
I’ll try it out, thanks man
---
Only ever failed the event twice out of 30 times. Once by my self on private server he wouldn’t take damage and another with 3 low levels. This was pre patch so guess we’ll see now. But always get with a good group and it should be fine
---
Hyper optimized builds and chasing the meta were never any fun to me.  Having the capability to one shot something by balancing on one foot while whistling God Bless America on the third night of a new moon seems like a huge pain in the ass.
---
Rifleman got hit pretty bad too. I go from one shotting most things with h vampire handmade to having to taking 2 shots on some enemies with a bloodied lever. Probably time to pull out the old gauss rifle again.
---
**BUT** I just did an Earl run and it actually wasn’t a huge difference ammo/time wise. Going to switch to commando to see the difference later.
---
UPDATE: There is almost no difference in straight damage between rifleman and commando. I don’t run commando often to save ammo but after 30 minutes with it I am using the same amount of bullets since I’m not 1 shotting most enemies now.
---
If it was intended to make me enjoy the game LESS, then sure.
---
I just hope they didnt patch the raider rep glitch. I'm a quarter of the way into the last level and dont feel like grinding the rest lol
---
ooohhh, I was wondering why that glitch would happens sometimes and not others.
---
What does matching set do?
---
Nobody’s talking about how hard daily ops is? 
---
I know my build could be better, but I did a daily ops with resilient robot and I died literally 30 times. I am a full stealth build and every enemy completely ignored my stealth. I get having increased perception, but total ignorance of stealth is a bit much I think.
---
I’m not holding my breath.
---
With having to bash everything to death after shooting them down to no health I went through 3 shotguns on daily ops. Fortunately I carry like 8 of them.
---
It wouldn’t matter for 95% of players when servers will be down for 2-3 hours anyway. They never take more than 20-30 mins to install on a high speed connection.
---
Interesting didn’t know lvl has something to do with using exploits.
---
Silly me lvl 375 lol
---
It's always good to stock things that players use for dailies and weeklies. Old world food for example. Berry mentats will be hot for a while as ppl need xp for the board game. Either herbivore or carnivore serum depending on the goals of the player xp wise.
---
i had a good time with the first and only one i've done. i'm a shotgun build, not a melee, so i just gunbashed them when they were at minimum health. worked out fine. the boss was pretty tough, but it was fun, yeah! :)
---
The treehouse village now also has a lot of villagers walking around
---
Serendipity and sucking off Todd the God
---
Wait do we have the same mom
---
For me the challenge is key. Think of FO4. As soon as you saved up enough purified water and picked up the Overseers guardian, that was that! Game over. Keep the game as challenging as possible for as long as possible.
---
Lol i remember back at launch the game was £60 and the tricentennial was £80 in the uk (i think, dunno what it is in dollars but its pretty much the same). I paid 20 extra quid for:
---
An outfit i dont use
---
3 blue and red weapon skins which i dont use
---
Some camp posters which i dont use
---
Power armor paints which are bland with dodgy textures
---
Enough atoms for a fridge
---
I personally wouldnt even pay 50p for it. :/ I'd say the base game is worth the price, whatever it is nowadays, but any addons just arent worth it.
---
Yeah they fixed this weeks ago after everyone kicked off
---
I love building camps... except I’ve hit a wall.  5 camps I really like, 3 at a “never move” state, and new atom shop items mean I have to tear up things I like to make the camp work.  Of all the things I like to do in game, this has now become the most limited and it seems to become more limited each patch, without a single expansion beyond new cosmetics.
---
Nor worth it
---
Here ya go  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hIItKekZzIc
---
As someone sub-50, I already don't have a lot of ammo as it is. Everything is taking many more bullets to take down. And that freakin' assaultron at the Hornwright mansion is just annihilating me.
---
An exploit that helped people.  It's about as immoral as Robin Hood.
---
My bloodied build had a shocking amount of survivability, I am unsure how everyone else have had such a big issue with it. PA helps a LOT though.
---
I’ve seen this argument (“they only fix the bugs that people want to keep”) a lot, but I don’t often see people talk about why that is. From my very limited experience in development, there often tends to be two reasons for this kind of thing (and I stress very limited, I’m obviously no expert). 
---
1) the first one comes down to pinpointing a bug. There may be hundreds of bugs, but unless you can easily replicate it, it can take hundreds of hours to figure out exactly what is happening. Game programming is basically systems upon systems upon systems all telling each other what to do. It very hard to know which systems aren’t communicating properly unless you can replicate the miscommunication regularly. By replicating it, you can sit there and think “okay, system x, y, and z are all involved in this, I can scan those systems and start finding the issue”. If you can replicate the problem reliably, you aren’t even sure where to start, you could have to go through thousands of lines of code just to hopefully stumble on an issue. 
---
But that’s where “fun” glitches/exploits falter. Not only are they often easily replicated, you now have thousands of people online explaining the smallest details about said bug in great detail. The developers have half their work done for them, they can easily pinpoint the issue and fix it. And why wouldn’t they fix it? It breaks the game they set out, it’s not an intended feature so it should be fixed. And on top of that, even if a glitch is a good thing, it means a system isn’t working properly and said system malfunctioning can cause bigger, less wanted issues in other parts of the game. 
---
2) And this is the one that people tend to get mad at me for saying... they aren’t only fixing the good bugs, they have hundreds of bugs listed in nearly every patch notes, but those get ignored. It makes sense, when a good bug gets patched, everyone and their uncle flies to reddit to complain. A good glitch gets patched and fifteen YouTube videos spring you about the game getting worse by the day. But a bad glitch gets patched, it gets completely glossed over unless it was a total game breaking glitch. 
---
I mean, it makes sense in a way, you don’t praise a game for working how it’s supposed to, I get that. But people take for granted what goes into fixing bugs. In programming, you can do everything right, double check your work, spend countless hours critiquing every minute detail... and STILL be absolutely riddled with bugs. It’s the nature of the business. And not to mention this is Bethesda’s first major foray into the MMO Fallout concept, so there were bound to be issues. But as easy as it is to accidentally create a bug, fixing said bug can often lead to having to rewrite entire sections of code, or browsing thousands of functions to try and find the issue (see above explanation). So while a small, seemingly insignificant bug being on the patch notes seem like Bethesda just fixing their cruddy game, some guy may have spent a ridiculous amount of time away from his family trying to get that done before the next patch went out. Then he gets to go online and see how Steve in the next department over got to tackle that other bug, when Steve had 27 YouTube videos showing the exact details of the bug and maybe had to spend thirty minutes fixing the issue. 
---
It makes sense to me why people get worked up over “good bugs” being patched, but we need to remember it’s not a malicious thing. No development team wants to spend all their free time on a project, and then go “how can we make this LESS enjoyable”. What they see under the hood and what we see playing the game are totally different things. Not meaning this as a rant or anything malicious, just trying to shed some light on why these things happen. And I’m not defending every Bethesda decision, this game has had a LOT of big missteps that they really need to get in order. But it’s a lot more complicated than “Beth hates us, they don’t want 76 to succeed!”.
---
Same here for rifleman. I actually enjoy it far more but want to test commando before I say too much.
---
The modifier for today’s Daily Ops makes sneaking much more difficult.
---
&gt;Piercing Gaze: This mutation is always applied to enemies the “Uplink” Daily Ops mode, and gives them greatly enhanced perception of players.
---
That’s good to hear thanks. Wanted to make sure I wouldn’t miss out on these as I won’t be able to play for a couple weeks
---
Save it for a rainy day
---
Wow that was a lot  more info than I expected lol. Last time I believe I was a lvl 60,and am returning at lvl 107 .I will be using my lvl 50 t60 PA along with some damage reducing chems  arsenal of two and three-star weapons for those assultrons. Last time I kept running around shooting bots for like 45 min because I didn't know what the next step was. I honestly don't know what my build is but I got alot of points invested in strength which fuels my hoarding addiction of" just in case weapons"and materials. Thanks for the tip about the doorway, I didn't think about that, the only thing I'm wondering is do I still have to destroy/repair the mainframe pieces? Thanks for taking the time for such a in-depth post
---
Agreed
---
Does modus count??
---
Might as well start a tab.
---
Edit: it seems a few people missed your Simpsons reference lol
---
Angry turtle got 8:09 yesterday’s video and he was talking so it can be done solo if you know what to do or can kill enemies quickly
---
It’s unfair. I don’t use meta builds too and the game became extremely hard for me
---
Hehe.... I like it  (build - full health PA Two handed melee, with instigating super sledge and a vampires rocket sledge)
---
Due to nerf it will anyway take super fucking long
---
Oh ps : I do have Max lock pick and hacker
---
I run a bloodied stealth build myself, but I agree that bloodied needed an adjustment from the powerhouse it was. However, this patch seems to have hit stealth significantly too - Ninja doesn't seem to add any damage to melee sneak attacks, and I've heard Follow Through is having the same issue with ranged. If this is an intentional change, bloodied stealth builds seem almost redundant now.
---
Excellent, simple advice, but some people have the winning Darwinian combo of stubborn and ignorant.
---
As a more casual player - yeah I'm struggling a bit right now.
---
Level 40 so basically all the easy areas that I could restock at are now gone, I've yet to run into anything below my level, only the same or higher. I'm burning through ammo and stimpacks at a dangerous rate and worse than that adhesive to keep everything repaired.
---
It's doable...but it means going alot slower and sneaking alot more, and as someone who only comes on for a little bit after work - that could kill alot of the fun over time.
---
I'm not dropping the game and walking away or anything just yet - I'm just not a fan of how much more of a slog the game just became for me.
---
I used to spend 10-15 minutes just picking up all the crap from the piles.  Helped me keep my TS Gauss Minigun with Pentabarrel fed.  She's thirsty.
---
Building is like fo4, there are more stat checks in dialogue like fo3/NV, when you join a game you’ll be dropped in a random public server, you can log out and log back in to switch servers which can be helpful for getting mobs/loot to spawn sometimes. The game is pretty different from 3,NV,4 overall because of the multiplayer dimension. Just appreciate that it’s a new experience that will have different strengths and weaknesses and u won’t b miserable ;;)
---
Yeah, I have to agree with you. Glitches have removed some of the grind. I guess if I get banned for it, I’ll go play something else. No sweat off my back. I buy atoms and have subbed to fallout 1st a few times. They want my money then leave me alone to enjoy the game. I’m not hurting anyone!
---
Yeah I agree, I did my first op this afternoon and did it in 7 minutes flat thanks to a few tse laser users, we zoomed right through it
---
I had about 15 minutes of play before work. I went to West Tek. Mutants were 60, 75, 100. I run unarmed bloodied melee. Prior to patch everything was a one shot kill. 60-75 took about two regular hits. Level 100 I one shot with a power hit. I think I’m going to be doing more running, ducking, and healing but I still do a lot of damage. I’m excited for the challenge. Feels like the old days where things would get hairy and we’d escape by the skin of our teeth and have great stories to tell. My stories in the past 6 months were, “I went to West Tek and murdered everything in 10 minutes.” Not as compelling a story or gameplay.
---
I have a rifle build and with my TSE handmade could pretty much kill anything with one shot under level 30.   With no more enemies under that I'm now taking 4-5 shots to kill everything.   I did AWOL today and died 4 times, I never had that trouble before, all the robots were sponges and I did little damage.  All I'm doing is watching my ammo stash plummet and getting pissed off because I loved this weapon.
---
Some legendary perks require a matching set of armor. One provides poison resistance and the other fire res.
---
Sweet!  If they also implement the pommel horse (from Fallout 4) you'll get an Agility boost.
---
Wait magic wepons...I'm new please explain
---
Okay it’s not that funny anymore lol
---
nope, it's legit possible that the qe is more damage than the b, if the b is 1\* and especially if you have demo expert equipped. 
---
The difference should be slight though and at 5% health the bloodied weapon might catch back up.
---
I ran leader of the pack today with a ts shotgun (mostly to get the weekly legendary out of the way).... and yah.... wolf strength is ridiculous now..
---
Imagine taking the time to produce detailed Patch Notes, thoroughly explaining the new features, and players just yeet right past them.
---
Fact!
---
that was probably me lmao
---
That is not correct. Unless the numbers that I just got a few minutes ago are lying.
---
Autism complete as in if a team mate does one it fills your bar? Or once it's done you just get the stuff?  Cause I did the buy or sell items, and it auto filled it once I did buy stuff
---
Power armor?
---
You get addicted to 5 things and get a 10% damage boost for each one.
---
ideally you want to be addicted to stuff that doesn't effect your build much.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction)
---
So melee should avoid drugs that give -STR. rifles avoid -PER loss etc
---
LCK and CHR are two that are good to lose points in. You can still equip the right amount of perks though. I have like - CHR if i'm no in a team but can still have 5 perk points allocated.
---
Gottem
---
Thank you for the post.
---
Wait, really? I've been going back to Charleston station daily for a little while now
---
Glad my beechwood floor rooftop dome garden camp still exists while im on vacation and is legacy :)
---
That was an issue agreed. I don’t join private teams though. Seems to take care of that. Don’t let random people join your private team.
---
You don’t lose anything if you die. I stay looting until mine falls on me. You don’t lose anything. Right before timer reaches 0 I put power armor on so when I get sent to nuke zone I don’t drop anything then. The chest At the end is junk so I stay and loot every body
---
On the other hand I bought the plan for 12k I think, and glad I did cause haven't gotten one after at least a dozen events
---
Ah should have known
---
Just head to watoga to start a minor quest to find the last surviving brotherhood soldier from the Appalachian chapter.
---
#BITCH, DON'T YOU DARE FINISH THAT SENTENCE
---
Well, its a mixed bag. The level scaling is nice but the dps nerf sucks to be frank. (Junkie rifleman.) I lost 40%.
---
On top of that they never bother killing the adds in boss fights (non PA bloodied builds). I never understand that. Then they crying to be revived and ppl have no dps yadayadayada.
---
I gotta stop shooting Earl and clear the room myself...like wtf...i'm a PA Bloodied Heavy Gunner...can't you just kill the damn adds, so i can keep the dps on the boss !? 
---
I can easily do the work my self with my Bloodied Commando alt character. Grrr 😠😕
---
I agree.. takes just a little more effort for shit to die, all the exp is most welcomed however, it is strange seeing lvl50 eyebots though.
---
From what I read, TSE isn’t the only factor. It’s the demolition expert perk interacting weird too.
---
Playing the game as God Howard intended is like taking it up the bum without lube... and paying $15-100 a month for the privilege.
---
I'm really hoping instanced camps will alleviate that issue. However I doubt it
---
wut
---
Okay good to know, I didn't hear about that mutation. I couldn't enter stealth at all during the op even with 20+ agility and Covert Operative.
---
Every single Daily Ops team I've joined so far had no one in Daily Ops. It made zero sense.
---
Sorry, a few of us did try and get that across as a potential/likely issue while testing on the PTS, but they played a very deaf ear.
---
West Virginia Lumber by any chance?
---
I already have (ofcourse), but I was curious about the new game "feel" from a player perspective, of those who have already tried it out.
---
I am at work too. At my job I only got one day off the past month and this month looks like it will be the same!
---
That's kinda what's got me considering it lately. Are there any subscription fees or anything like that after the fact?
---
Wait. Why won't the daily ops robots die?
---
Every enemy now for me now is level 50+ so I’m having a bit of a hard time. Also I expected the perk points you get could be spent buying perk cards that you don’t already have. Uh uh. You use the perk points to buy additional ranks of the new legendary perks. The first rank is 50 points, then it increases by another 50 points for each rank.
---
As someone who had cloaking enemies today you cant vats or decloak
---
I feel like Turtle Soup.  Anyone else?
---
Thanks, I will!
---
Well good because I’m tired of setting a chain reaction and dying from one blowing up lol
---
They aren't glowing, but still looking good
---
Me too, but the owner was a pretty swell individual that didn’t lock any of them, so I took at the .45 ammo in them all.
---
Meanwhile after years of playing the game and killing the queen literally 100s of times it still shows I haven't killed the scorchbeast  queen
---
it helps a lot, thanks gor shareing👍🏻
---
You dont  eed a melee build. Just gun bash to kill.
---
"you still do great damage"
---
Tell that to my Bear Arm. Damage output has dropped by 600+. My bloodied melee build is fucked 😭
---
Chinese stealth suit from the setterlers
---
Yep, makes sense and thanks for sharing.  I’m currently leveling as fifth character a 20something bow build but   I’m out of town and won’t be able to play until Sunday.  Scared, lol
---
Datamining indicated he was going to leave a note behind, but I certainly can't find one. Has anyone else seen one?
---
Soo is this the finale damage debuff or are they planning to make more improvments in the future?Just curious.
---
We got screwed on the free item this week yet again
---
Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets sell better than the rare outfits you get from them for me. 
---
And I’ve been having some luck with Mr Fuzzy Tokens.
---
And you can state facts. What was the point of saying that, exactly?
---
This turtle video goes into depth about the melee perks
---
[legendary perks melee](https://youtu.be/mSoA2-aWmWU)
---
So I’m still lost, mine said 50 pats, and I upgraded, one of my cards. I still show 211 under the normals perks but show 0 pts for the legendary cards. Is it you can only upgrade 1 per day?
---
Between those two, 1 stealth piece (since stealth doesn't stack and benefit from more than one piece) and the rest in WWR. I have all WWR, but I am a terrible terrible hoarder.
---
By prioritizing them over the energy weapon robots.
---
Melee
---
Double tap.
---
Daily ops uplink is Incredibly hard for a bloody build :/ Even with a good bloody deathclaw or whichever melee. Killed all my armor and died about 20+ times
---
Melee them. Use the search function on the app. This has been posted about multiple times
---
I shoot the resilient enemies with my Vampire's Gatling Laser because they still heal you even when you do no damage. I just fire at them while walking towards them and then bash them.
---
This.... THIS is LIVE CHIC
---
Well that's interesting. I think I've only got about 6 stockpiled so I guess it's time. Was keeping them as decorations but frankly they look like crap since the empty open ones display but not the closed ones.
---
Spoiler alert - you're missing something. Try reading the instructions.
---
Last season there was a bug that would cause your challenges to complete when you logged in and you didn’t get SCORE for them.
---
Melee them dude, if you read the mission details it was there
---
We prefer not too talk about the genocide we committed and prefer not to explain ;-)
---
true it will get SomE of it back.. but my other gear will be wrecked..
---
Is the update live yet? Cause I wanna start downloading already for when I get on later cause I’m on Xbox
---
"Noise maker thing" I have 2 cockatiels and whenever I join that event the noise the thing makes drives them crazy they squawk and scream at it.  Hence noise maker thing
---
They want the old guard to die and forget that they have FO1 on subscription.
---
Now i will actualy go to them!
---
She plays all 5 characters and honestly it’s her least useful one but she says it’s fun.
---
The resilient mutation makes it so robots only die to melee. Give em a good bash with your gun when they’re at the final sliver of health.
---
High health unarmed, which is fucked.  My damage is a 3rd of what it used to be
---
If games have taught me anything it's that no one knows how to read
---
Have no idea what you talking about. I'm using full bloodied heavy guns build, but while i'm not in power armor - i'm using power fist without unarmed damage perk, actually i have only one unarmed-related perk which adds faster swing speed. Yes, powerfist (B/25fss/1str) damage was dropped from \~2k (which was TOO OP) to like \~600, but it still can kill almost anything which is not legendary, in one hit (especially with legendary perks). So, yes, enemies became a bit harder, but nothing critical, personally i'd want to get much more hard enemies. And also, don't forget about as enemies level became overall higher, you'll get more average XP per time - and this is very good addition as XP de-facto became new currency (because of legendary perks system). So, this all is totally ok\~ish.
---
Bloodied commando. Added follow through perk at level 4. Everything dies just like before. And no more level 1 trash mobs. I’m likening this update a lot
---
We have atom challenges still?  
---
\*insert spiderman laughing gif here\*
---
Please explain me how what I just said dosent make sense
---
I thought the reason he's the sole survivor of the BoS in Appalachia is BECAUSE he deserted.  
---
I haven't really been paying attention to the new BoS lore in this game yet so I dunno.
---
Why unyielding?  The only thing is does for you is a bit more xp.  How do you live without stabilized?
---
I'm excited about this too! I only played for a little bit during my lunch break but i hit up Morgantown and was like alright!! I just need to recalibrate bc I keep trying to loot the bodies before i kill off all the enemies like i would do when they were level 9, so they end up hurting me more 😂 I'm excited to check out some more old spots!
---
At work too and have to work OT as a couple of coworkers are sick so wont be able to work when I get home, but will turn on the Xbox to make sure it updates while I sleep then will play this Friday.
---
I hope the event comes back soon. I needa get my hands on the strongman outfit and plushie.
---
Welp. That sucks...I was hoping the SCORE system would get the boot. I miss playing this game without the constant grind. I’ll stick to the other games for now like I have been.
---
High health melee here, my damage is e 3rd of what it used to be.  This kinda sucks as I don't like using guns.
---
Oh I rightly misunderstood this I thought this was about the raider one! 😅
---
Ok panic over.
---
Will do, thanks
---
It's a shame but it is what it is I suppose. I'll either adapt to the new style / something will be tweaked / I'll eventually walk away.
---
For what it's worth I totally get the appeal for higher levels (Those who are enjoying it at least) it just seems a bit rough on lower levels at the moment.
---
DOH! Got it thanks!  I missed that obviously.
---
So it has nothing to do with the glitch but you made the connection on your post. Got it.
---
Yea I can imagine some of the levels 40 to 100 are having some issues with the higher level enemies everywhere. Even before those assaultrons would melt me lol, that lazer face beam is tough.
---
It sure seems to have. I am not very happy. I haven’t figured out the legendary perks yet though so once I get those squared away maybe it’ll all balance out. Def not liking the new level scaling though. 👎🏻👎🏻
---
I didn't realize it was the tents causing this to happen. I thought it was just bug with Bethesda. It was a fun XP farming tactic.
---
It would've indeed.
---
Removes diseases one at a time
---
Nah there’s too many of them. Plus the friggin stagger!  I need to increase my defense somehow. I don’t have the time or patience to track down troubleshooter gear
---
One Wasteland only dropped today....
---
Why did this make it to public release when it was reported immediately on the PTS weeks ago?
---
Well, don't play that Daily Op then.
---
It was my favourite gun, reminds me of the Lincoln Repeater from Fallout 3.
---
No aren't those
---
No but you find one related to Dodge in watoga.
---
I'm really excited that bloodied will not be the end all be all anymore, just because I have never had any interest in that playstyle.
---
For ages I've been doing a straight melee/rifles + stealth build with max STR and high PER/AGI and just enough Luck for Class Freak and Starched Genes. I'm going to be hit a bit but I really only had two levels of damage modification going on (weapon damage perk cards + stealth bonuses). It's definitely going to be a nerf for me, but I don't think it's going to hit me nearly as hard as bloodied folks.
---
I just wish Bethesda had the guts to just outright nerf bloodied perks and legendary effects into the ground rather than do a change that also affects those of us with already non-meta builds.
---
My damage curve felt fine. Could oneshot most minor enemies from stealth, 3-5 hits outside of stealth. Bosses and big enemies were damage sponge-y and difficult, but I did feel like I was making an impact on most of them. I felt like I was in a spot that was neither so weak that the game was too hard but not so OP that it was cheesy.
---
Now I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble keeping up, and the fact you have to spend levels to change your SPECIAL assignments is really hostile to casual players like myself (2-4 hours a week) in a situation like this.
---
if only there was a team up function you could use
---
I ran into level 100 crickets in the bog. Oof
---
They fix these bugs but still allow Players to glitch through my locked doors with photomode?
---
Too bad vats don't work for the telsa, great drop though.
---
Are there pics somewhere of what these rewards look like?
---
This is fanbased sub. You should go to official forums and/or bethesda bug report page.
---
Laughs in melee build
---
One gun army seems bugged, shows 1 star but really a 2 star...?
---
Why did you quit?
---
You could just weapon bash them🤷🏼
---
On of the kids I play with out one in my camp a week or so ago. This is lovely news
---
its timed... not a timer. and its like the whole point of the mission, speed run, stop being a slowpoke.
---
It's people like Angry Turtle and InnovSurvivalist who bring attention to these kinds of things.  I'm subbed and like their videos, but there are somethings like this that get hammered by them and I'm sure Bethe has scouts watching.
---
Thanks. I also prefer solo, so teaming with another person who prefers solo would be good!
---
Unfortunately I believe it says every daily op has resilience
---
No they're not. Those are the mothman glasses. The mothman hunter glasses have a red lens like the regular mothman glasses, but don't glow
---
I love patch day posts.
---
Its off-topic, but how about AAE? I seem to do more damage with AAE handmade than my Blooded one. At least against super mutants and ghouls.
---
These are the types of camps I love to visit. People with imagination make the game that much more fun
---
Crap, I’m trying to remember if I sold my FFR 90% Fatman I’ve been sitting on.   It would be cool if it was actually a useful weapon
---
Shoot them and then hit them with the butt of your gun.  They're only dead dead by melee attacks
---
the circlejerks gonna jerk.
---
it wasnt funny yesterday, it isnt funny today.
---
if it makes you feel better, there appears to be quite a few other players who also don't read.
---
Radiation rumble is amazing now with level 60 enemies
---
Get pneumatic on chest
---
?  What part of bloodied faster fire rate faster reload is vats?
---
imagine sorting by new to respond with the same quip to every post.
---
I thought it was a random mutation; 1 of several possibilities.
---
You can hurt enemies using anything, but the final blow will have to be melee for them to die - bashing works as well.
---
May I ask why it's not worth it? You kinda didnt give me any reasons where as alot of the other posters kinda gave me reasons as to why it is worth it
---
I am gonna be a killjoy and say this is the same exact item from fallout 4, it's just a reused asset.
---
I'm surprised they waited so long to add it, but this might mean they'll add the other S.P.E.C.I.A.L enhancing items in the future.
---
Bloodied melee certainly isn't. My damage output has been massacred 😭
---
Can’t wait for primal cuts in the next meat week.  All the enemies like the crickets, mole rats, toads that should have been easier to kill before the boss will now probably lay you out a few times before completing the event.  (If you’re able to complete it in time) LOL
---
Do you have any other 1 star perk cards you could equip with one gun on?
---
Yeah, they said that the mutations will change but this Daily Op they’re insanely perceptive, that’s why you couldn’t enter stealth, tomorrow should be different.
---
I wish there was a short time to set up like in colossal problem rather than being spawned right into the mission.
---
And seems like they got buffed a little too. My TS-MIRV before patch had about 650 dmg and now it's 1034
---
Totally agree. The people I play with and many more can still solo High end bosses, especially with reenabled limb damage. Also the enemies aren't dead hard yet.
---
I love this subreddit. "Exploits are bad and Bethesda needs to fix them! Don't take away the exploits I like, though."
---
Exactly.I do think they did say in the patch notes they will be having future improvments.
---
Nah every oop has piercing gaze
---
For reals, this is super exciting for me.  I can farm xp just running around the map instead of just server hopping at West Tek
---
I also missed this on my first attempt and was super confused. It’s so easy to skip past some of these menus when you’re jumping into a new game mode and be totally lost. Good luck on future attempts!
---
Legendary Joe
---
No u
---
I see no BOS Elder Rank in your future...no good prizes if you dilly dally, they are meant for teams and good team work.
---
Nah the nerf should have already reduced the chance of those guys ruining the event
---
Everything, VATS is completely broke for telsas and guass rifles since WL dropped. Not all but most weapons are effected, learn to adapt. I run with a couple Telsas' and was hoping that today was the day they fixed it, nope. Gonna convert them to Auto and spray and pray.
---
Yea its something i do like to do, i allrdy like my new location and camp better ;)
---
hashtag ad
---
It’s almost like you need to rely on teamwork...
---
I’ve only done it twice so far, 8:30 once and 8:20 next. Hopefully I can get it down to under 8 solo
---
Not sure if it’s still free but if u have fallout 76 on Bethesda launcher it automatically adds it, you will need enough disk space for another installation of 76 though
---
I try to gauge who's smacking Earle the hardest then shadow them to savage any Wendigo that gets within 10 feet. Like a little bodyguard. When there's no adds it's mag after mag into Earle.
---
No problem
---
There’s a whole sub Reddit for it. r/Bethesda
---
I’m sure the creator will update it soon. But for now it can’t be used
---
my guy
---
Yes!
---
The day when the mod does not update on patchday?
---
Mate, you haven't playing log, have you?
---
Looks like we might now be sellin a lot more Psycho in out CAMP vendors!
---
Ah I know that one. For this seasons ops I actually just wrote an 11 step plan on how to beat them with ease and safety
---
And only for uplink
---
Is your mom named Mom as well? If so we probably have the same mom.
---
I had fun. Kind of.
---
The bots are a pain. Wouldn’t be as horrible if we didn’t have to melee for the killing blow.
---
I didn’t experience “unkillable” bots, because I can read before I attempt something new. Lol. But, I did have a major issue with my gun bash not registering a hit, even tried pulling out a normal melee weapon when throwing the kill shot, but still had a lot of issues with ghost bots deciding they were going to just let that blow go right through them.
---
Same here. I was in a public team. Didn't seem to be much different to events teams. At least with events teams you can check the map and see who is at the event and join, even if they aren't in the same team
---
Part of my 4-8hr/day routine is farming materials to feed my cannons.  Hell, I spend 1hr/day farming lead alone.  ONE EVENT was enough steel for me for several days of Earle fights.  
---
I'm lucky to get 1/5 the steel per event now.
---
Sending good thoughts from the other side of the state!
---
Yeah I'm kind of at a weird stand still in the main quest where it recommended level 20 and now that I am level 20 anytime I try and get near the quest markers all the enemies spawn at level 50-60 and in groups. I keep dying. Don't really know what to do now though to keep leveling up. I've just been joining any public events I can and building my CAMP.
---
How do you "beat" Fallout 76?
---
This is still very strict, most people probably don't complete every single daily challenge every day, in fact it's ludicrous to think that. I barely got half way on Season 1. The Outlaw Pass on Red Dead Online on the other hand is too easy, most casual players complete it within a week. I think the same could be said for most games, developers make them relatively easy because of the upfront cost. Typical Bethesda have decided to take a different, more annoying route of turning it into a grindfest
---
Damn ultracite ftw! Thank you sir.
---
Okay, see ya! Don’t let the door hit ya on the way out
---
If only all these crying posts were aware of that
---
Mods. Survival. Those were at least options in FO4
---
I feel ya but these really were designed as a group effort. I struggled with my first one too (didnt even get initiate), then was on a full team, nobody communicated but numbers helps, second try 8:03 almost had elder, third try got it with 7:55. What worked best was keeping everyone on the uplink and letting mobs come to you, have some ppl using heavies and then melees finishing. Im a bloodied build but vampires was the most useful weapon for this, for melee and ranged. Stealth regrettably, is useless. Hope that helps and dont let that first one discourage you.
---
You already have a bloodied build i take it.
---
While I agree with most of your post, I'll have to take issue with that last paragraph.
---
Building is probably the *only* reason I still play either Fallout 4 or Fallout 76 anymore. Without it, I doubt I'd still be here. All the Atoms I've bought, all those months of paying for Fallout 1st, they'd all be gone.
---
So in regards to the last paragraph, I'm not sure that there *are* 'worse bugs'. I think that they *are* 'actual game-impacting issues'. 
---
We are all here for different reasons, after all. I've never played a bloodied character and I never will, so changes to those mechanics don't impact me *personally*. But when they are changed for the worse, I don't dismiss them as being unimportant, because they are important to the people who *do* enjoy them. Nothing bothers me more than those people who proclaim things to be unimportant just because they are unimportant *to them*.
---
So too are changes to CAMP building important to those of us who enjoy that aspect of the game. Neither one is necessarily more important than the other.
---
Don't dismiss them. They're a part of the game. Some people find them to be important, others don't, but it's a big game, and Bethesda should be catering to all of us. Whether we like looting, shooting, *or* building, there's room enough for all of us. Bethesda needs to remember that.
---
Hahahaha, I mean the survival, combat, world, and  social ones.
---
NOICE  
---
I only recently got my Fixer plans after trying for so long.  Gonna love me a Dark Matter Fixer.
---
Definitely lmao. That was ridiculous
---
This is actually awesome. I can finally move my goddam tent out of the way. Living deep north it was like 50 caps just to drop by and turn in quests n shit.
---
haha. Yeah.
---
I joined a daily ops, already started.... from 38mn.. and the guys were ranting on audio about the unkillable bug ;)
---
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a bullet.
---
It’s a glitch that happens every so often to people apparently, randomly unlocks hella atom wallpapers even ones you don’t own. You can place them and they’ll stay in your camp till u move it and u won’t get into trouble but eventually the glitch will fix itself
---
For real. People act like it’s a good thing. It’s certainly not good for new players having high level people come and murder their wolves!
---
One tier a day so a super rare chance of getting 3 rare rewards. Once you’ve gotten all 3 tiers you gotta wait till all the random stuff is new to get more rewards
---
The game has indeed became hard for me since I don’t use weapon damage specific cards. I want the weapons to function similar to fallout 4 where you didn’t need the damage perks and you would still be able to kill enemies with ease. The damage perks should only be there if you really want to kill things incredibly fast.
---
Thanks for all the advice. What about mid-long range weapons? I’m guessing sniper? What type and legendary perks am I looking for?
---
Now i can start using my tent again at least...
---
As a melee build I prefer to solo it. I hate running to a far off enemy only to have someone kill it just before I get there
---
I didn’t even notice that lol. Still worth it for the extra.
---
I read through the patch notes and honestly you're flat out wrong.
---
No fo real I am a new player so I dont know what they are
---
Maybe it was a glitch or series of unfortunate events but it's happened to me. At least once that I remember.
---
What does B2515R mean?
---
It’s a glitch. Not sure if you’ll be able to apply them or keep them after they’re applied if so. But I believe others have said it goes away after a reload.
---
First thing I did was max it out.  Went from 27 2mmEC to 67 per craft.  Nice.  Also maxed out Master Infiltrator, but didn't have time to test it.
---
The range in the gauss shot gun is quite good and will cripple with the enforcer card.
---
I work the B Shift on a Naval air base rebuilding jet engines (well, really, I'm just one step in the process). After downloading the update and waiting for servers to kick back on, I had JUST enough time to do an event and run on the daily op (needed that SCORE!). Was fun. Really considered taking leave but I gotta save up for our annual 10 day shut down over Christmas lol
---
Ah right, il drop by there anyway and see how I get on but thanks for the heads up
---
Fed76 for item prices, take it as more of a guideline as to what you should keep and what you should scrip. The actual cap prices are kinda out to lunch on some stuff, but it will give you a good idea of what items, with what legendary effects people are after the most.
---
Far as I know Secret Service armor and T-65 PA are BiS. You can also build your own legendary SS armor with modules bought off the purveyor, which makes the armor grind a bit easier for a full set.
---
Also check the returning players post under the "about" tab on the subreddit page, might have some info for you.
---
Everytime I did that event and someone did the tent game all ot meant was one douchebag killed every scorched and everybody else got screwed.
---
It's better when the tent spawn trick isnt used unless your the douche
---
Turns out I was thinking of the wrong thing lol as soon as someone said I glitched or cheated I knew I must be thinking of the wrong ammo machine. I have the crater ammo machine and the converter. And I had no idea you could even put an ammo machine at workshops because I don't use them lol
---
Going on eight hours and the servers are still down?
---
I got some if you want one I’ll be on in a hour or so
---
At least they give you acid.
---
I'm on ps4
---
*rejoices in .308 and .45*
---
Oh. That makes things easier. Thank you!
---
Definitely what rads and survival shortcut because then I don't have to carry radway and food water
---
I'd prefer a pinned post letting people know that the Patch Notes and ITV's exist. 
---
And yes, I realized there is a pinned post of the Patch Notes themselves. We need another pinned post letting people know of it.
---
I know! Finally completed one on paladin lvl after quite a few crashes. Fingers crossed it gets better ay
---
Try new mole rats! The new organic suppository that’s more gentle than hamsters!
---
Well see if you’ve got enough strength to run shotguns on a rifle build that’s your issue.
---
Finish the main storyline, I imagine

I thought all moms were named Martha

Wasted sooooo many stimpacks in that boss battle until I realized it was just better to die, over and over again.

Damn I guess you lost the game- time to make a new character
---
Free or trade? I don’t have much to trade to be honest
---
Wait.... They didn't..... Was this in patch 22?
---
I’m glad you clear ads cause I’m bloodied melee but I have to spend half the fight using my handmade to mop up spawns cause everyone ignores them
---
Me too

Damn dude, get on the trading forum and make yourself a fortune before we all get access to them.

Kagami Mochi also has the same problem as the  Leper’Chaun Vault Boy Outfit.

1) you don’t need a melee build (just to kill for that particular mutation)
---
2) not ever OP will have that mutation. 
---
3) if you absolutely refuse to melee at all, bring a friend... they are intended for team work.
---
Damn i know that feeling all To well. Sorry you gotta do that. It just will be that much more sweeter when you get to play. Have a good day
---
Only the strong and versatile will taste sweet BOS Elder success.

If any camp has reasonable priced junk, I'm there. The only thing I want to see from camps is junk

Thanks for the laugh my friend.

Thank you for the Intel!

I played it a few hours ago on PC.

Yeah

Enemies are tougher now. Patch Notes out front shoulda told ya.

wait that's a bug? honestly thought that was intended / too lazy to implement
---
Cry me a river mate

Play fair or go exploit somewhere else
---
Ammo factory because everything is a damn sponge now. Luck for more crits. After that maybe follow through?
---
Yeah but the Halloween skin doesn’t
---
I'm running both, just sped through Harper's as a test. It was a RIOT. :D
---
Herd Mentality won't show up unless you're in a group. At least that's my experience.
---
Its unfair that if you dont use dmg perks  you do less damage? So its unfair if i choose dmg perks and then have less carry weight and pick up less food,caps,chems?
---
That someone is usually me :)
---
Just done it on 3.. what a chore.  But now it’s down.
---
Alright I can't send a pic in messages either, and after looking at it there's definitely a few things I would change. But you'll definitely want max strength at 15 with basic, expert and master of either gladiator or slugger (1handed and 2 handed respectively) maxed out at rank 3, with martial artist and maybe barbarian. 
---
Then in luck grab serendipity and bloody mess, that will be later on though I don't think you can get it low LVL.
---
Use ironclad from endurance if youre not using power armor, as well as evasive in agility to really bulk up your damage evasion. 
---
This is just off the top of my head and theres definitely plenty of room for more points to be allocated. I haven't played a pure melee build so if anyone else can recommend some good additions then please do. Other than that quality of life perks never hurt rather than maxing damage output because with that setup plus eating the right foods you'll be nigh unstoppable.
---
One wasteland?
---
I’ve been workin all day so i guess i’ll see when i get into it
---
The fixer can have skins now. Any combat rifle skins work on it now [check this out ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itclau/you_can_now_apply_combat_rifle_skins_to_the_fixer/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Bottom line is thus. At no point ever in any of the Fallouts I have played have I ever thought, “ya know what sounds fun?Robots. Endless high level robots.” Was never a thought I had. It’s great if everyone else likes it. Have at. I’m just disappointed with Bethesda overall with season 2. Only cool thing is legendary perks which we were already supposed to release.
---
This. This is what we needed.
---
Damn, so we won't be able to do manhunt, tea time and fertile soil anymore for quick events. :(

I wish, lol I did move my camp up above West Virginia lumber just so I felt closer to home lol

Finally a wise person speaks!

That's laggy too, and it takes AP.

Yah please my guy, I appreciate it. What’s your GT?
---
I did. I didn’t see any other posts at the time of posting
---
Ammo Factory, since I just burned 600 rounds killing 3 enemies.
---
It's because you asked his buddy what a "John" was.
---
Practically impossible for any kind of stealth build though, and that’s how many of us play. Really fun huh
---
This is the build I'm considering:

---
I'm lvl 43 this updaye took all my stimpaks and ammo. im not playing anymore this update was meant for people with perfect builds who are lvl 100+. pin me i hate this update I can't play solo without getting wrecked by feral ghouls or other mobs I should be able to take on. it would be better if it wasn't a flat level scaling until 50. This update is great for people who have already been playinf for a while, i just started a week ago and basically all the stuff I've saved up is gone after a few hours of playing. Im legit sad I feel like I've wasted an entire week. downvote me call me a complainer whatever this update is extremelly punishing to low level players who haven't had 1+ year to grind all the good stuff.
---
But where?  It's been there for SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long.
---
No idea honestly it was really straightforward
---
What?
---
I think as long as the cost, any combination of materials and/or time, were appropriate it would be perfectly reasonable. 
---
Cool idea.
---
I was just thinking "So let me get this straight. They nerf weapons and buff enemies on the same day?" Bold move there.
---
Neither my melee or vats rifle are worth a damn anymore. Dont have a bloodied build im just assuming they still do some damage.
---
Do i look like the kind of person who plays bloodied?
---
Junkies 5eva! And things just need a few more shots. It's great.

I’ve got a bunch of rusty ones to use up, this is good news :)

I thought you meant that they heal the player, that’s why I got confused
---
You can upgrade as much as you have coins for.
---
Level 50. All of them. Mwahahaha... ha... *sobbing intensifies*
---
The problem anyway is that as Commando you can't maintain a good dps on bosses ( Scorched Beast Queen &amp; Earl ) as you often have to reload. Unless you have a glitched, cheated weapon, or whatever, as a Commando, you should vats the whole area and clear this area before thinking to shoot the boss. 
---
It's anoying, most Bloodied builds (commandos/snipers) don't even care. They are mostly on vats build, like wake up wtf lol. I'm having absolutly no issue with my sniper and Commando. I don't understand man lol
---
.Setscale 10 let's do this
---
100mbs/ per second internet, as well.
---
I dont know what you look like honestly.
---
You are 100% correct. I agree with you. The thing is, I tried making food and food buffs, because they are very strong. One example are the brain bombs. I have been sitting for many days figuring out farm routes for it etc, and yes it is very benefitial. I am getting tons of intelligence from it. The problem is, I am not that great of a player and I am not getting younger. I also stress very easy. To be honest, at this point, I rather sacrifice those intelligence for NOT having to constantly keeping my inventory up with sugar bombs, and farming the ingredience, and not to mention boiling that water, which is actually pain in the ass. Collecting dirty water x2 to boil water, and changing the perk and all. I hate changing to harvest perk, and I hate changing to double craft perk, which is very very needed in brain bombs. I also always forget to swap back.
---
So I decided now after many days of testing and thinking. I am actually gonna use the survival chem perk. It's worth it in my situation, to just be able to quickslot and press a button and all problems gone. Yes, I will be lacking some xp, I will try at least to do the cranberries. But I can't do both.
---
I went from ~2400 damage to about 450 
---
Looks like I'll be switching to shotguns
---
What weapon are you using?
---
Never said they shouldn't be heard, just addressing people saying everything is a grind now because they added more challenge to the game.
---
He’s tough but at least you can get him alone
---
I mean if you're on about Nazis they're the complete opposite of commies
---
Well, if your hoarding habit (you are not alone) includes some kind of vampire heavy weapon if would help a lot. Destroy/repair mainframe cores is still part of it, in case you did not know - there are intact cores spread across the room with the terminal and the rooms around. You may not find all of them and probably must repair some at the bench, once again it is a good idea to block the entrance to the room with the workbench with your PA. Good luck!
---
What a drama queen. lmao.
---
I run a poorly optimized jack of all trades build, gunslinger, rifleman and gladiator, stealth with lockpick and hacking perks always equiped out of laziness and i do just fine. Stop crying.
---
I never stopped. Scrip is scrip and I got the camo junpsuit from it too
---
Go full commando and invest in stealth
---
If you have the floor confetti, I'll happily pay, lvl 80
---
We’ve known for a long time about the impending damage nerf
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Stealth is sadly never an option. Every Op will have that mutation as standard.
---
Legendary effect
---
Foreal, mine went from 380ish to like 260
---
That’s what I did
---
is scamming now bannable?
---
Yeah I just checked and it is. I’m debating whether to change builds or stick it out
---
Wouldn't he level up with one wasteland? He'd be like level 75 or 100 rn right?
---
Platform?
---
dude can probably see through the blindfold no doubt. This is not a trend that should be followed ever.
---
Oh damn, I had to look this up to see if Ammo Factory is a perk card, unfortunately, the version of Fallout 76 I have doesn't include Legendary Perk Cards.
---
I read the patch notes ofcourse. Would not expect that every single enemy would standard be lvl 50 in the forest altough.
---
I realize I’m going to be in the minority here but that was a boring ass lame ass bug. That event is one of the only fun waves/horde events and people who would show up and force spawn them from the sky were genuinely were ruining it for me. I don’t see what’s fun about shooting scorched spawning from the air in a cluster for ten minutes.
---
See! I new collecting every type of non gold bullion power armour on a character that didnt use it would be worth it!
---
PS4
---
My fav were lever actions but with the amount of ammo needed now nope not anymore.
---
I sure fucking hope so.
---
The daily ops are actually pretty legit! But definitely recommend troubleshooter armor idk
---
Did they not buff turrets??
---
same thing with a cryolator
---
No time for that now the computer is starting.
---
Same, my gauss shotgun does 1200 and it doesn’t even move their bar, my only weapon that works is a furious mini gun but who has enough ammo for that
---
There was a similar question earlier this month about Earl, Wendigos do not count as animals so Hunters does not apply.  
---
From another post it appears that Hunters applies to ActorTypeAnimals in the coding.  Cyptids are Assigned ActorTypeCryptid.  Though as mentioned in the exceptions below, the megasloth is both. 
---
The exceptions are the Mothman (bug, Exterminators), and Megasloth (animal, Hunters).
---
The Tales magazine applies to specific cryptid as does the buff for Queen of the Hunt (target cryptid only). 
---
So there is no specific prefix that covers all Cryptids, and none for Wendigos.
---
Ah, that did it. Made a public team with just myself and it showed up. Weird, you'd think the negative effect would still show, right?
---
not looking to trade , just tryig to help out new players
---
Didn't fix the Grelok Staff removing the Grognak Axe legendary effects. That really needs to be in the next patch... and please fix the Grelok Hood too, it makes you bald.
---
You are actually right. I bought the game for 60 euro, got zero in compensation for bug testing and reporting their beta game for that price. I wasted 200 shotgun shells just to crash right before event was over, got zero in compensation. You are actually right. If they threated players with compensating for their broken ass game, it would be a different case. I am sorry for reporting those players. Lucky it was only 2.
---
God I love patch days.
---
Reading/researching is definitely the most difficult to attain perk in 2020.
---
Hopefully they made it useful still have to try it out again but I have a TS 50V 90 and before the patch its was sitting around 6280 i believe and after the patch its at 7120
---
Big boxes full of predictable furniture layouts and the same artwork on the walls and maybe a wrap-around porch. Just like real life suburbia.
---
[My apologies in advance for the snark here. I'm not happy at all with this update. I'm genuinely happy to hear that the various builds are OK.]
---
So much THIS. What is seem to be hearing is "my &lt;insert meta-chasing build name here&gt; build is doing just fine. Awesome, I'm so happy for you. Truly.
---
However, for those of us who just play with the cards we are dealt, so to speak, we've been given a pretty clear message: chase meta or stop playing. After being here since beta on 2 platforms with 200+ level toons with FO1st on both, this is not what I wanted, but then again, no one asks the normies, right? I'm not asking for it to be easy, but don't give me a level 100 mob to shoot at with a level 50 weapon. Why not make weapons scale? Or does that leave room for the casuals to play so it's not allowed?
---
So, everyone complaining about the casuals/normies messing up your play, you've won. Just like every grinding game in existence - Destiny, Diablo, etc. - the meta takes the joy of "just playing" from the rest of us.
---
Look, I've got nothing against you guys running these specific builds - you do you - but my yum has been yucked with this "recalculation". I only played for 2 hours and I'm already not wanting to play again. Only felt that way after the season 1 grind. In my book, Bethesda missed the mark here. There are WAY too many other things that need to be fixed before this was rolled out.
---
A likely story. Tell it to the judge.
---
Not everything ofcourse.  But enemies in the forest should not be that hard..
---
Yes, I read the patch notes and I knew it would be tougher. But just heading to your camp and getting waylaid by groups of your own level that just tears through your gear etc is a bit more than expected. I am not packed with legenderies etc that most seem to be, so cut a bit slack eh :)
---
The fixers also arent showing up on the wall weapons rack
---
One per day
---
Oh I do he event too. I just don’t need more competition
---
I think I sold mine in my vendor because I didn't know what to do with them.
---
Ammo factory maxed already, same with Take one for the team and Agility, not sure about which other 3 I'm gonna max next, had to go to work😞
---
sad :(. oh well, I guess we just have to force get along somehow. Sry for my behavior.
---
Yeah, used it for getting Gsync working.  I still can't figure out what why it's not as smooth as it should be.  It looked good before the reload and all the other games run fine.
---
this may be old info but a place to start: 
---
* A helmet can be found at the [Charleston Capitol Building](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Charleston_Capitol_Building) in the Charleston Capitol Courthouse, on a table with a lamp and folder under the collapsed floor. Another can be found on the front desk of the DMV.
---
* A helmet may be found at [Morgantown](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Morgantown), at the street camp, inside the large tent, on a table.
---
* A helmet can be found on a cabinet shelf in a shed to the south of the [North Kanawha lookout](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/North_Kanawha_lookout), to the left of the fridge.
---
* A helmet can be found inside the yellow striped bus south of [Dyer Chemical](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dyer_Chemical).
---
Agree, it's going to be fun trying to keep the cows alive in free range/riding shotgun
---
Just gonna say starting out is going to be a nightmare, and the fact that the current game is made for high level player's is kind of shitty for low levels because I've seen a couple low levels get on shot for wondering to close to me, that and starting out your not going to have alot of the perks that will give you the damage nor the tankieness that you gonna need now that everything does more damage and you do less. I'm currently level 136 running a low health heavy guns build and I get killed quite alot now because of this patch so as a new player your experience might differ but I'd say it's not worth it.
---
Do you have a suggested build I could look at? Been on Google but unsure if to trust half of them lol at least people on here use them and can tell me what works.
---
Look everyone...it's *that guy*.
---
I haven't played yet, but Follow Through was my main LP target.
---
I went in solo as bloodied unarmed w/ unstoppable monster. Was able to finish at the paladin tier, can't remember exact time. I died twice when I got swarmed by machine gun gutsies, and like, 3 times at the boss. I was able to 1shot most of the bots with a power attack. The boss was... really rough, even with whiskey and chems. Overall, not a terrible experience though
---
Ok judge i have no idea who this guy is or what he looks like.
---
good to know if it indeed works
---
Ooh i hope youre right about the aae. Got a bunch from The legendary sale last weekend
---
Railway rifles still slay in pvp
---
Its the laziest way to make the op difficult imaginable. we spend our entire game building to heavy guns only to be useless now. No creativity, im a solo player for the most part, spent the game not caring about melle and selling anything good melle i found because it was worthless to me, and having to switch to melle to take 30 swings to finish off an enemy really sucks. I dont have a decent melle weapon, and even if i did, its frustrating to have to switch weapons constantly during the fights with the slow and sometimes buggy animations.
---
Im not a specified build and have been moving points over slowly
---
Railway rifle
---
Someone else confirm this works and I’ll award this post big if true
---
I've got 100 banked and I'm not even going to bother. There are 2 LP cards I want, the rest are meh for me.
---
TO THE TESTING!11!!
---
I’ll definitely have a look tomorrow then,my luck I don’t have any combat rifle skins ha thanks :)
---
Has anyone tried the Minigun with the "shredder" mod? Does that finish them?
---
Try playin with the football table yet? I get a persistent audio glitch no matter where I go. Gotta log out of game and back in to remove!
---
I don't think it happens so long as you don't close the application. Swapping characters seems to be fine for me but of course whenever my game crashes, I have to fix it all over.
---
Wrong Bethesda sub
---
Yea he threatened me also. Lol
---
Ouch
---
It’s in the patch notes, y’all
---
They should at least guarantee a legendary for those who killed 1 or no wolves.
---
"Does anyone know if you can get a rare reward after already getting one and completing elder rank?"
---
Did you try reading the Patch Notes?
---
Can't bash in V.A.T.S.
---
Same here.  I definitely hit the robot, but it didn't kill it until I bashed him.
---
3 people PA ON OBJ, 1 unyielding ripper running around finishing everything 6:32 its was easy.
---
Do you get a plan for the mask or does it come as the item when your rewarded it ?
---
I don’t. I run only heavies but the YouTuber Angry Turtle covers a lot of builds and generally is pretty helpful. https://youtu.be/thD8fuBsNOM you can check this out if you’d like !
---
I want my damage back
---
What if you are not optimized?
---
I received 2 rare rewards today. 
---
First was the medical machine that you scan yourself with in nuke silos  got that for second timer reward.
---
 And got gallery signs for top time rewards.
---
Both showed up under the rare reward spot.
---
I have a mule build that literally has no combat perks except for Commando 1.  I’m using a non-legendary Fixer with a .38 receiver and a non-legendary Spiked Ski Sword.  I have no legendary armor on the character either. 
---
This alt is currently level 47. I’ve run the main quest right up until I am Become Death and currently doing the Settler-side Vault Raid prep. 
---
I’ve been advancing just fine. Combat is marginally more challenging, but not impossible. 
---
If I can do this with a 99% ‘Food Build’ with no legendary gear, you can probably do it too. 
---
Post your build and get some advice.
---
They do have to be at lower health to do more damage, so i understand to a degree you get less rewarded for the risk. However i think it was just too far above the rest.
---
This update is all about nerfing synergy/stacked effects moreso than anything else.
---
Hopefully when they make 4 and 5 star armor they add a bunch of new effects and re balances to the effects that are already there.
---
Bye bye c u later
---
No longer needed.
---
Then exit vats what
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/builds/

Lotsa builds
---
Wow. I used Bug Spray as a joke (-15% Dmg from bugs). Shits gonna be meta now even finishing that now.
---
I agree. There will be tears.
---
Dang man.  I don't need to hit like a god, but I'm not gonna run around at 25 health for little to no benefit.
---
Will do, thanks.
---
Okay thanks for that
---
Thanks, I never would have thought of that.  Most helpful sir and/or madam.
---
Not crying. Just did not expect it would be that much harder even in parts (the forest) where killing enemies was real easy before the patch. It feels unbalanced now. At least for me.
---
I was skeptical about the One Wasteland enemy scaling but I really like it so far. Combat in what were low level areas of the map is interesting again.
---
Jawn. Hoagie. She’s got...style I can respect, ya know?
---
Sustained
---
Lemme guess you think youre cool because you have a magic gun right?
---
Good to know for whenever I come back to the game. I run a stealth sniper/commando rifle build. Seems like I'll be getting the short end of the stick.

Only thing it does?  I can basically use any bloodied weapon effectively. Wanna use melee? My strength is well over 30. Perception/agility/luck all over 20 for sneak and vats use with any weapon. Intelligence sky high for xp. Charisma high for vendors and speech checks. I swap in PA, stabilized and OGA when needed. Unyielding is just the way to go for routine play for bloodied.
---
Because God Howard doesn't allow freedom of thought.  You must become their corporate slave and do as they tell you.  No fun for you. Access denied!

---
You can play it as much as you want but with basic rewards not tier
---
Same toon? Or alt?
---
I got the solar panel and then for the second reward I got the gallery signs as well I just want that bos spec ops outfit I know everyone does lol
---
This literally just happened to me.
---
I have a bloodied heavy melee build and that works well, especially with the extra perk cards I can add with legendary special perks.
---
Not full bloodied, I will often have 60% health, and use 3 of 5 unyielding. It allows me to take more damage at higher health, and gets me out of trouble when lower. 
---
I am taking more damage now so this helps a lot. It takes two to three hits in daily ops to take the ads out, which is ok with fast swing weapons and perks.
---
3 lines button
---
Literally the day after I got max rep with both, lol. Oh well, still gotta farm bullion for the last few things I want, I guess. Being able to move my tent will be nice, though.
---
Am using a AAE lever action, AAE handmade and a IE dragon. It just takes two headshots to kill mobs. Am always hidden so it doesn't matter if I had to take a Extra shot. Rifleman probably isn't good against bosses and daily ops
---
i mean when you put it like that
---
Glad to see daily ops includes all builds really hit the screw on the head beth.
---
You can apply them freely and they will stay applied even after the wallpapers are out of the store.  I have the commie star one in my camp right now and I never bought it.  I just applied it because it let me use it while it was for sale.
---
Bashing with the weapon also counts. Tried and tested. 👍
---
Haha wow. Kind of feel bad for that city. Probably full of mistakes.
---
Sounds like you should get a PC.
---
. 308 and 50 cal ultracite is much cheaper then regular so thats my reason
---
Look up angry turtle magic guns on YouTube
---
I'm not sure what you mean by my side 
---
I live in this place called reality, where if the developers banned everybody that did such a widespread and relatively minor exploit, than they wouldn't be able to fill the servers that they are paying cash money to run. And since such a large portion of their playerbase is now banned and not spending money in their shop, it becomes harder to support those servers
---
Just for clarification, I'm not in the Navy any more lol I got out in 2014. I was an Aviation Electrician's Mate, worked on SH60B and SH60R helicopters. Just got out and decided to continue my career for the government lol but I thank you for the kind words. Lumber yards aren't a joke either. Worked one during the summer after my Sr year in high school before I left home lol was really just part of a "clean up crew" though. 
---
Hopefully you get some time to play the game. I know how it us with family time. My wife just had her birthday a couple weeks ago and I don't think I touched the Xbox that whole weekend lol
---
True but when your in the daily op alone it's bad
---
I dunno.. I always close the launcher (PC) when Im done for the day..
---
sometimes my favs are borked when I log on again.. sometimes they arent
---
I'll just read that patch notes again. Im sure that will fix any challenges I might have. 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Whole trending post yesterday telling people not to do this
---
That would give the chickenphobic settler constantly running around the place a real reason to be afraid.
---
How they are supposed to balance weapons with high base damage when the old formula just MULTIPLIED your damage.
---
Theoretically if you kept stacking more damage you could eventually reach damage cap that is possible for this game.
---
Low base damage weapons get overshadowed by high based damage weapons also automatics also are getting insane increases when they are the most broken thing in terms of mechanics to have effects like explosives that make accuracy and natural weaknesses less of an issue for handling that weapon type.
---
It's all about balance.
---
World of Warcraft actually had a exploit discovered with stacking death knight effects to damage cap of millions per hit by a multiplied effect that stacked for whole raid.
---
The gameplay has changed so things are more dangerous to you and you can't just solo things too easily. Esp. when it comes to things like daily ops.
---
Can you get the rare rewards at basic rewards level?
---
The event was fun and rewarding when it was shooting fish in a barrel with a fast respawn rate.
---
I went from rarely doing that event to always doing it and really enjoying it.
---
Now we are back to I'll rarely ever do this event again.  Bethesda really knows how to make things less fun.
---
Looks like meat is back on the menu, boys
---
So, chase meta or don't play, right?
---
Yeah my Quad HM is probs coming out of retirement. I'm in Australia at work and so fucked off I can't see first hand what's happened with my build. Another goddam 8hrs before I can play.
---
To a lonely mentally ill person, Bethesda’s changes really hit hard because it effects my life and will now. Now I’m struggling in game now and it’s stressful and not enjoyful even though daily and weekly challenges. Take away the best thing about the game. What do I do now? I have played all the games and have nothing to play or look forward to. #fuckpatch22 I guess I have   Mafia 1, assassins creed Valhalla, and cyberpunk 2077. Then what? Wait for the next game in a miserable circle of life? What’s next, take away public teams?
---
Noice 
---
More cards to scrap lol
---
Ah, good to know about the loadout mod.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
I’d love to go junkies if you have any extra weapons lying around. Right now I’m focusing on stealth until I find a weapon to base my build off of.
---
Check the "How to Loot" part at the start of this one. As far as I know (and have experienced) this is still how it is.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where\_to\_farm\_all\_the\_things/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/)
---
Dude, Bethesda has infinitely more resources than I do have time &amp; patience to navigate a buggy ass game board. If you read my post closely, I could not claim all my loot b/c navigating the board became EXTREMELY slow and laggy that it became unbearable,  impractical and borderline pathetic for anyone to reasonably engage with. Previous season boards and rewards ought to be accessible to players and not time-limited. It doesn't make any sense otherwise. Unlocking your rewards should be a 'rewarding' experience not one burdened with frustration. A buggy board is NOT the fault of the players.
---
I agree with you, I’m almost level 100 and loved the forest. Low level and easy to clear with some events to tick off the daily/weekly challenges as well as the atom challenges. Now everything is level 50 and my route that I usually finished in 20 minutes tops (depending on how many events I join and how much looting/getting sidetracked I do) has now taken me double (actually more than double) and spent nearly all my ammo which I was already low on from the Colossus. Wish this level scaling BS was a toggle option for players who want the challenge it can be on and for players who want to be able to clear the old low level areas it can be off.
---
Well if your on PS4 and wanna take some photos of the strip club and maybe buy a hoe, send me your psn cause I’m planning on rebuilding this weekend.
---
?? Why you mad at double wall people but you're praising broken weapons being around? 
---
Hell one of my buddies go a new hacked weapon thats like a fixer that shoots MIRVs and it crashed the game (private) in like 10 seconds of firing it lol. Fuck those guns
---
That's what I'm getting at, it's very clunky.
---
They fix them because those are exploits, ex the wall glitch allowed unlimited budget, so I dunno why this is being upvoted.
---
They are from a seasonal event awhile ago, there were special unarmed mole miners you had to kill. They dropped random pails and the pails when opened would give you stuff. So as always, we all hunted them down, the women and the children, we slaughtered them like animals. Applachia genocide.
---
Well mate I can definitely say that Uranium Fever with level 100 moleminers and the fireworks speed reload being nurfed was a different experience..
---
Yeah because you gotta finish them off with a melee attack or weapon bash.
---
Idk but I wear chinese stealth suit, probably that's why.
---
Once a day. You’re right I saw invisible enemies too so I guess the reset is around 11 or 12?
---
Just the item. Only plan so far is the Glaive
---
Yep. He kept trying to argue with me. After I wouldn't insult him or give him an answer he wanted to his repeated question, he gave up and said he was just going to block me.
---
Yes  
---
I strongly suggest reading quest info, specifically about enemies mutations.
---
If your intent on getting a set of PA, it's actually quicker in my experience to just run around the various military sites in Cranberry Bog and slap together a set of t-60. It's not the best armor in the game, but you can get a full loadout pretty quick. Ultracite is even quicker if you have caps to spare from buy the recipies from other players. 
---
Excavator does have that lovely +100 carry weight though!
---
Yep, I spent the last month working towards a bloodied rifleman build and was extremely disappointed with how the game is right now.  Actually, I’m dropping the game.  I reached level 101 and I’m happy with that.
---
I’m bloodied commando. I still one shot pretty much everything and rinse a SB in 2 seconds whilst it’s flying. Follow though at level 4 boosts damage back nicely.
---
I wish I had seen this before I bought both ammo smith perks for the sole purpose of increasing plasma core production 😜
---
I think its better that they have made it a proper challenge instead of just one shotting everyone/everything. It makes the game more fun in my opinion
---
Same here man, had a B33 Lever Action that was my baby and now it's in the stash with the other trash.
---
Can build nuclear powered exoskeleton out of tin cans... can't thread a screw. :*D
---
I dunno. When i tried I made sure I was hitting a bunch of zeros first with the gatling. Then chucked a knife and ...nothing. ill try again later.
---
Your target probably didn't have 1 hp so 🤷 it probably didn't one shot them
---
It was terrible, mIn reason I never finished the rep grind, too expensive to keep going back and forth
---
As someone who has re specced 5 times on my main character I do see im behind everyone else for perk coins.
---
Same, I found a guy last week who had 20 all making 50 cal ammo, all unlocked. That was a nice 4000 round bonus.
---
One is uncommon, one is rare
---
It’s like cinnamon toast crunch without the cinnamon. Just “toast crunch”.
---
In the PTS we initially had max levels an enemy could spawn, such as say 25 for things in the old 'low' areas, but a vocal selection of the testers complained that they wanted everything to scale and Bethesda jumped to obey. Now everything scales to at least 50.
---
nerd rage kicks in at 20% health
---
They were added in the update today so everyone has access to Legendary perk Cards upon reaching Level 50.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7YtULG-9k5u5GD6swiIwBVgxspA3Qg6IzLQpJqeNRQ/edit#gid=0
---
I wasn't really concerned.  Just funny that was the only way I've seen the event done, that's all.
---
If you haven't already, invest in Serendipity, which procs the dodge on those Wendigo swipes, saving my ass all the time. It's not just about tanking the damage, it's about avoiding it altogether. I also have Marsupial and Strange in Numbers, so I usually bunnyhop away from things to avoid hits. Never stray from your team or you'll get swarmed. Get asbestos lining to negate the ceiling fire, don't get aggro from the colossus to avoid his kick and spoogeballs. The only times I really die is if I'm not paying attention and get a loogie to the face or three stunning wendigos I didn't see coming.
---
My bloodied gauntlet has gone from ~1900 to ~370. So thats a drop of 1500+.
---
However, unless its something like a mirelurk queen, it still gets killed in 1-2 punches.
---
So although the number is drastically lower, the realistic difference for almost all enemies is I need to click twice instead of once.
---
They are super strong if you’ve got a high level character for sure. You could start a new character at the strength of like level 25-30.
---
Oh ok will do
---
It's in the patch notes.  If people actually read the official posts we'd have a lot less posts by confused people.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if melee would fucking register right when bashing. I had to hit one of those fatass robobrains like 5 times before the bash actually registered. Shit happened to so many enemies.
---
Seems to be working for me. I have level 4 and gone from 2 shotting the supermutants at westtek back to one shotting them. Not noticing a massive amount of difference with the nerf if I’m honest. Maybe when I take on Earle I will
---
You can also unequip a weapon and punch them with your fist and kill them after shooting them, uses less AP, but maybe swapping to your fist or another weapon takes too long compared to bash idk
---
Check Berkeley springs train station
---
I know of him. Seen a lot of nasty comments from him to others. Doesn’t seem like the nice guy type. Wonder why he was banned?
---
It sucks absolute ass. Buggy as fuck, menus are slow, switching weapons is a nightmare and shit spawns out of nowhere. Not to mention registering 1 out of 10 melee hits in a melee kill instance. Wtf.
---
Yeah I’m always running out of ammo. It’s the only thing I spend caps on other than fast traveling.
---
This was my strat- weaken them with my handmade, flip to melee with the left dpad button and finish them if my melee teammate couldn’t get to them. With melee heavily nerfed you need to get creative!
---
I get the distinct impression its gonna be a team cell where you can launch your expeditions from.
---
Ugh wasn’t working for me! I’ll try again next time.
---
You do realise that if enough players drop the game you don't get to play either, right? At best servers become ghost towns, no one drops nukes, many events become uncompleteable. Worst case the game becomes nonviable to keep online and they just shut it down as another dead live-service.
---
It's bullets riddled my fragile body
---
I think they are fine for the most part since they offer a TON of utility.
---
They are supposed to be a long term reward for players who are higher level. While i agree that scrapping cards isn't the best system, you can also infinitely level up as well and they wanted a system to accommodate a long term progression.
---
You aren't suppose to just have it maxed out overnight. Not defending the grind but they want players to not have many powerful effects right out the gate.
---
You can do powerful things like nullify the need for food and water for example and always have the bonus if you are going full health build with food perks with little weight and no need to gather/craft. 
---
You basically eliminate the need to even certain perk cards equipped, you just bypass entire mechanics. Like with infiltrator that is hacking/lockpicking bypass all in one.
---
So part of the balance is choosing what you want to be most convenienced by RIGHT NOW, what mechanics you don't want to contend with. What do you find most important right away?
---
Max level? Dang what a nice crossbow! I am jealous!
---
I think freezing gutsies are worse. You get stunned by the bullets, frozen by the hits, and that ends up with a very annoying stunlock. Not only are you going to die, but RIP trying to get a solo elder run with that and piercing gaze
---
Bye felicia
---
Incorrect, don't spread misinformation.
---
We know
---
For me its not about the good or bad bugs they fix, its about the good intended working parts of the game they unfix such as making certain weapons 'legacy' which then gives dupers a target.
---
Nice, but highly doubt you got Elder Rank soloing it...you almost need 3 ppl to comfortably run the operation with time to spare. 2 man Eldered it with a buddy and we still only had 10 seconds left for the elder rank rewards, but got it.
---
Dang, I just used up my two dozen remaining pails I had left on several characters last week. Found pails only, though. I still have 30 or so empty pails, so I'll get to crafting them a.s.a.p. Thanks for the heads-up!
---
Sorry. Not a console player. Grew up a long time ago so I wouldn’t know shit about console. 😁
---
Does it still shoot bullets like trying to pee after having ... ehm .. fun ?
---
this isn't working for me. knife is quite clearly hitting them as well.
---
Ok, will do ty for the info
---
Follow-through:   hoping that ranged sneak attacks can help offset the nerf.  Funky Duds:  need poison protection.   One armor piece has it; would like a little more.  Sizzling Style:   its fire protection allows me to replace Fireproof with a different endurance perk.  Legendary Agility:  want to equip more cards like covert op and/or dodgy.  Legendary Luck :  want to equip more cards like ricochet and bloody mess.
---
The sixth one will be either  ammo factory or Legendary Perception (looking at all 3 commandos + concentrated fire/tank killer/glow site).   I just need to see how much more ammo I'm using with the nerf and One Wasteland levelling.
---
So uhhh where do i buy the emote from? I just bought the mothman pack and dosent seem to be in it.
---
Yh it's the voice no offence to him it just put me off
---
Did they increase repair costs? Or do you just mean, because enemies will be scaling, you'll be degrading your weapons and armor faster than before?
---
Shhiiiiiiiiit.  Junkie any decent? Like junkies commando?
---
Seems like midgame characters are hit hard by one wasteland. Safe areas aren't safe anymore, you're basically back to square one in terms of enemies. Enemies seem to max at 50 in the forest (at least that's I see) so once you get past 50 with some solid gear it gets easier again.
---
Yeah this is one of my faves and I'll need to be a God to finish it now.... Well....
---
*Commence montage with inspirational music while millions of rounds and hundreds of stimpacks are made*
---
Ok I'm gonna need to get that
---
I did follow through,  take one for the team, agility, luck, endurance and strength.
---
Strength is 1 so that's bandolier and blocker...endurance is for chem fiend cause more dps ... int us 15 so luck andcagi to 15 is also moar dps.
---
Doing ops as a PA Vamp tank is hilarious with a bunch of bloodied builds. Who's the meta now, bitches?
---
No. Super Duper when triggered only gives you a chance of crafting double each trigger but only the base amount.
---
I empathize with your performance issues, but it still kinda sounds more like you gave up acquiring them, rather than the fact that they're timer-based.
---
people want keycards though
---
&gt;Its safe to say ui is a problem if its not getting the message to people.
---
Should I be banned for having a loaded mule in weapon weight reduction armor? He seems to cause some server lag. I didnt use the ammo factory exploit, but a lot of clueless people had them placed in their camp unknowingly.  
---
This game is a joke when it comes to exploit abuse and enforcement. Duping killed so many things in this game, yet most players don't think twice when purchasing or trading for gear that has been duped. Bethesda themselves have failed to police their game taking the most profitable path rather than fixing known issues. If you think they are going to punish exploiters your only kidding yourself.
---
Are you melee and have you played today? Melee seems to have been hit pretty hard.
---
So is there no longer immortal pets, seeing that critters update? I’m a new player and was hoping to get a Scorched Deathclaw down the line.
---
Fuck sake people, read.
---
Enemy Mutations: 
---
Piercing Gaze: This mutation is always applied to enemies the “Uplink” Daily Ops mode, and gives them greatly enhanced perception of players. 
---
Uplink will always bork stealth it seems.
---
I didn’t realize it moved between the two.  Does it carry any special plans?
---
Ok we're jiving now!  Easy mistake,  no worries.  Your camp is safe Wastelander, happy hunting!!
---
Yeah and I recognize that Bethesda is the best epistemically poised to make a decision about the direction of their game- I know this update brought a lot of my friends back who are eager to play now that one wasteland will equalize things between party members. An update came that added a mechanic making a multiplayer game better for multiplayer and a single player user is gonna leave because of it. I didn’t see him in my games anyways. The people who have been trynna fit their single-player square peg into the game’s multiplayer round hole are gonna have a hard time going forward as Bethesda gets better at it unless they adapt their playstyle to explore new possibilities.
---
Fuck RESILIENT enemies.
---
Yeah I guess with one wasteland and these new events this level of prep and tuning will be important again.
---
I'm not. I tried it myself and it worked so idk man. I figured i should tell everyone else
---
Ahh. So one is uncommon and one is rare but they both show up in the rare reward spot.
---
🤣😂🤣😂🤣 bruhhhhhh
---
First legendary perk that I have maxed out.  I'm not disappointed.  I'm good on ammo for a bit.
---
I joined my friends server and did it another 3 times and it was all robots
---
If you're having that much trouble with melee weapons, you can always gun bash.
---
VERY nice patch today. LOTS of concerns addressed with this one. Can't wait to get started. LOVE this game
---
OH NO! You have to actually play the game the way it was intended!?! You poor, poor little man. Whatever will we do without you?
---
I got so scared looking for all my Fixers in my stash until I found them piled up with the same name.
---
Yup, I had to repair all my armor today in one  session, I havn't had to do that since forever :-(.
---
Yeah, why my I?
---
If it's a bad way to introduce Daily Ops, then it shouldn't be in the game at all. Resilient makes no sense whatsoever. Maybe if I could change playstyles on the fly, that'd be one thing, but this is hot garbage.
---
So I’m currently level 30 does this mean if I head to white springs I’m not going to be mobbed by the level 62 charred ghouls?
---
mine has 1x rifleman, 2x expert rifleman, 3x master rifleman and the one that allows you to have more accuracy (2x). Just to deal the best possible damage out of the points I have available.
---
Got top tier with a random second player. I almost done it dolo but was 8 seconds off because the boss demolished me with its guns and I had to respawn.
---
Best time i had with a 3 player group was 7 minutes and 7 seconds.
---
FIRST members get the mothman emote and a robot dance emote...if thatis to what you are referring 🤔
---
Daily Ops is broken.  Not even moving and all the robots find you instantly.  I can’t even move an inch without being mobbed.  I’m not playing ops until this is fixed
---
I've done it dozens upon dozens of times and have never once seen someone hog all the kills...
---
I don't think you understand the bullet point.
---
There was an exploit that allowed you to double the effects of Unyielding to be +30 on everything.  That exploit has been fixed.  If a person used that exploit, knowingly, I'd consider it cheating.
---
We already do you donut
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
 I had this happen to me before. I just STORED the shower. Not scrap it. That’s a waste of resources.  
---
I swapped servers.  And I placed it down again. Worked as intended.
---
I liked the people who weren't even fucking clever about it, I was camp hopping checking vendors yesterday and there was a guy outside whitespring station that just had three of them plopped down next to their vendors.
---
CSA?
---
RIfles got bent over and screwed raw like that scene in TLoU 2.    
---
My best rifle long range Combat Rifle now does 90 dmg and is a Two Shot. I have a 2 star Quad Fixer that does  6 more damage at 96. The SLOW as F Brotherhood Recon Rifle now only does 147.    
---
My main has been largely castrated. I have yet to find replacements or know where to go next. My 2nd char at 56 is a Shotgun. The damage is less but not by much compared to yesterday.    
---
They could have bumped up resistances as well and not just HP. I'll keep saying it: 76 is an MMO and a time sink. They claim these changes are for making things better but it's just to keep us playing longer for little reward. Headshots on most things still do the most damage on everything I've tried so far.
---
I did the classic "spam stimpaks, run away and hope for the best" tactic and got elder so this is now my go too tactic whenever resilient robots is the daily op
---
OP, did you have melee weapon equiped while you were throwing the knife? Because that's the only way I could see this working.
---
If you are holding a baseball bat for example, any damage you deal will be classed as melee. Tomahawk, grenade, riccochet perk damage, electric mutation damage etc.
---
But holding a gun and throwing a knife, doesn't. Unless they changed this in the last update?
---
This is coming from a heavy tomahawk user, by the way. It can be used to complete challenges such as kill 1000 robots with pistol, just equip the pistol and throw a grenade. It will count as a pistol kill. It's weird.
---
Also if you have a vampires weapon equiped and throw a grenade or knife, it will heal you.
---
EDIT: I've not been and tried this in the ops yet, so if anyone else has had this definitely work please let me know. I don't want to get everyone's hopes up!
---
Seriously, I haven't noticed hardly any difference at all on either of my Bloodied/junkied commandos.
---
I never liked the fixer, and prefer my handmades.
---
I’ve had to abandon The Order of Mysteries questline, because of that damn Whitesprings sword. Also abandon the ally quest with the Captain because of the Assaultron. I’m assuming this means Scorched Earth is viable for us now? Been trying to get the decontamination arch but no one’s selling. Discord said there was no point cause it was free, but new players are a thing.
---
You don't need it, just need to play with your build, I haven't changed anything as of yet except add legendary perks and my Junkies build is far more impressive than my Bloodied, by a mile.
---
It’s been awhile, had to dust it off lol
---
Rifleman got screwed hard, best to switch for now.  Hoping they see reason at some point so maybe hold onto your current weapon for a while just in case.
---
Well, the real life Mothman Festival IS this weekend, so I'm not surprised they're doing it.
---
&gt;The problem anyway is that as Commando you can't maintain a good dps on bosses ( Scorched Beast Queen &amp; Earl ) as you often have to reload
---
Nonsense. Yes, you have to reload a handmade more often than a 50 cal, but the fact that you're doing 5-8x more damage per bullet more than makes up for that reload time.
---
Exactly what I just put away sadly. It was so close to one shotting everything but when you do need 2 shots...man that second shot takes an eternity
---
I'll wager every single one of those folks complaining runs a meta build rather than just a casual/normie "build".
---
Yes. It sucks.
---
I kind of figured I would die alot at the start. I played hardcore and survival alot in prior games so it's not something I'm not used to already. If dying alot is the biggest deterrent then I'm alright with that.
---
There’s a new mothman worship emote in the new bundle.
---
Yup. Debating which way to pivot since I already have a rifle commando char
---
Slow firing weapons got nerfed way more than everything else.  You got lucky. :)
---
Pick a perk or move a point that's evil.
---
Truth, truth and more truth!
---
I am a new player(2 weeks) and  I don't see a problem with people useing glitches in this game. I love the game but good god is it glitchy. Last week I lost almost all my gold bullion to regs in the vault just trying to buy the under armor.I would hit buy and get no response, hit buy and get no response. Did that until I got them and then fast traveld back to my camp. Next day went to see what else I could buy and I had less than 100 bullion. I had close to 2000 before.
---
Then today I had to run the new daily twice because the final boss got stuck in a wall and couldn't be hit.
---
So when someone finds a glitch that helps players. Good going.
---
PS: The covenant ammo factory is pretty useless now. It takes almost twice as long to produce the same ammo it did yesterday. Same goes for the camp ammo machine.
---
I would recomend not comming back it aint worth it
---
You forgot most of the playerbase cry griefer over the intended workshop mechanics. Besides you can produce much more ammo farming scrap without the PVP risk.
---
This nerf, this update was the best thing to happen to 76 hands down, I'm not even joking either. All my builds are still strong, I use a bit more ammo that's it.
---
Smart
---
I'm curious if anyone, Bethesda staff or the people celebrating the change, has stopped to consider what happens when you condition a playerbase to expect/enjoy a game that is single-player with some multiplayer elements for two years before pulling the rug out and making most content but farming 'multiplayer encouraged' where events genuinely require teamwork instead of mostly being brute forced while one or two players try to finish objectives.
---
Yes, 76 is a multiplayer. Except it's not, or wasn't, and most people have been happily playing it as a single-player title with a living community and optional co-op. That's the playerbase by and large from what I've seen in a year and a half of playing. Very, very few people genuinely play together as teams. Hell, it's hard enough to get people to work together in NW, the actual team mode.
---
I swapped to commando just today after playing rifleman for over a year. So far, so good. Chews through ammo but it makes daily ops and Earl doable after the nerf. 
---
I do hope they buff rifleman though, as I prefer that play style.
---
Looks like 315lbs to me
---
Yeah, my wall is full of the different handmade skins I have an I wanted to have the dark matter fixer up there.
---
Oh you started after that glitch started happening? No "in the early days" (so...a few months ago) you were able to see and inspect what you were looking at in player vendors.
---
Just looking for him haha. Cheers.
---
Max damage for Bloodied starts at 20% tho. Either way, it's good to see more options for people to use. 🙂
---
My budget isn't over, but it's much higher than it was.
---
Pre-patch 22 - 35% open budget
---
Post patch 22 - 15% open budget.
---
It's literally the same camp. I've never bothered with budget glitches/exploits, so that's not it, either.
---
They can be grindy and fair at the same time, and I agree that you shouldn't be able to max all of them out overnight, but the grind is too much in my opinion. 
---
It can be something that only high-level players can max out, I don't think I've seen many people say that it should be otherwise.
---
Also, while it is true that you can level up infinitely, it gets progressively harder to level up, and if it was a system to where you get say 1 Perk Coin per level, I wouldn't mind as much.
---
The issue I have is the fact that it discourages players using different types of builds, or players who screwed up their build, and need to re-do many of their S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats.
---
Those kind of players are going to be behind the curve when it comes to legendary perks.
---
Or better yet "Finaally" (Ward voice activated)
---
I was watching a video that included some hacks, however I couldn't figure out how to get the photo mode up at the door and accidentally press the d-pad and locked everything up and had to restart. PSA I should have done this yesterday because the assaultrons are lvl 75 as well as the colonel gutsys. I did try to block the doorway with my PA at one of the terminals but they came through anyways.im about to go make a 2nd run
---
If you bought the newest Mothman bundle you should have the emote available on the emote circle. Go to the one that has the puking/robot/original mothman emote and try to see if you can switch them. That’s my guess.
---
I play on PC (steam).
---
I was charging 200 caps per card at the time, as I recall.  The stated value is 100 caps, but for a lot of people it seems to be worth it to pay extra for the convenience of not having to hunt down multiple cards themselves.
---
I've had similar luck with airdrop tapes in the past, people seem to be willing to pay around 10-15 caps a piece.
---
I agree.    
---
I upgraded one right away. My main will stay a Rifleman as I'm a casual player and have ZERO interest in more time loss for so little gain. Piss poor decisions as usual.    
---
Rifles got a huge damage reduction. However, anything with a head takes a lot of damage from hitting it.    
---
My 2nd char a Shotgun build still does a lot of damage.
---
It’s silly to even believe that. I know fo76 could still improve in a lot of ways, as a new player seeing suggestions be upvotes that I thought would be a thing by now, but the quests still hit the feelings hard like any other Fallout.
---
Finally a brave soul. 👍
---
OK I can safely confirm that you do not lose your camp, if you just have the ammo factory stored as one of your blueprints.
---
The blueprint will still be there, but will be marked as unbuildable.
---
Ok, maybe stop forgetting the ammo your converting, stop going in and out of the pip boy and converter. It's really not that hard.
---
No they didnt, as far as I can tell
---
Damn common core.
---
I dunno, dude. Bloodied has a real trade off now instead of being able to instantly kill everything with no consequences.
---
I meant a full respec...not one point at a time per level...that's as tedious as starting a new character...you donut...
---
Im a non meta build and im not having much trouble with the update. Things still die in 1 to 3 shots (scorchbeast about 10 to 20) 
---
I will admit the daily ops boss has killed me a few times because im melee.
---
Thanks for the tips my dude! I will farm some prep kits of food and drugs before I head in. Good luck out there!
---
Yep commando builds if anything didn’t change much. Unfortunately I can’t say the same for the melee mains. Game plan has changed up for them
---
TLDR; the game is too hard now so I quit
---
Okay Karen.
---
Got anything new?
---
FWIW/PSA: **Everyone's CAMP should be fine** ***so long as they didn't build the machines in their CAMP.*** If you have them blueprinted, all that happens is that the blueprint reads "nonbuildable." Your CAMP still gets placed as usual. That's all.
---
Wow.  I like the passion!
---
Knowing the bare minimum they usualy do, they'll probably put up a sign telling u to not touch the fence.
---
Each patch isn't collectively increasing the amount of space the game takes up. If you've got a 60GB game, and there's a 20GB patch, that doesn't mean the game now takes up 80GB. Patches can provide updates to existing binaries, meaning that an updated version of a binary must be downloaded, but that binary replaces an older version of the binary. While it's true that patches can increase the size of the installed application, they will rarely (if ever) increase the install size by the same amount as the patch.
---
patch 24 notes: Vending machines have been disabled due to a bug related to enemy spawning using fences in fort defiance.
---
Only with the realisation that they're effectively useless
---
I just did SBQ with about half the server and it was epic. It's a boss fight.
---
The numbers were squished your not doing that much less in dmg its maybe a extra hit
---
Yea I've clarified in the post...I meant a full respec system similar to other games. One that's not punishing like the current one we have...
---
Nah, same as always. I think he can roll some uncommon plans, though.
---
is that the only way to get a benefit from it now?
---
Fixing the fixers😂😂
---
Ask for legacies and good weapon rolls!
---
Yes. Most of my bloodied legacies still shred foes,  be gp, be handmades and fixers still work well. Trying out my aae and tse collection to find out how they perform. 
---
Bloody plasma caster is shit now. From 700-800 damage per shot to now 300-350 per shot
---
I bought it all, it’s the tropic thunder skin
---
Fuck yeah, finally an end to the embarrassing amount of times I accidentally went to that station just to find mama mumbles’ old toothbrushes and expired hemorrhoid cream
---
Nope literally came back to this sub just today cus of new update nice try this m8 dont @ me
---
There ONE bug that I’ve ran in to. Got the Legendary Agi perk card and a Lv3 thru hiker. It was taking 4 points instead of 3 to slot it. HOWEVER! I was able to get around it by making the Agi tree only need 3 to completely fill it up. So I was able to slot everything perfectly fine as long as it was the last card I placed.
---
A lot of that can be negated by using tactics, especially covering. We're used to playing fallout games by just running and gunning stuff while taking shots to the face, but you just can't do that anymore.
---
Now the risk is even higher for an extremely underwhelming reward.
---
Nothing really changed. Well my bloodied heavy guns are still melting my opponents. I'd say the world is just a lil more dangerous. I mean you can't really stay afk for too long lol. Enemies are all lvl 50 around the place lol ( well...as lvl 302). 
---
I like it, i got melted by a Legendary Glowing Goul lvl 100, it brings you back to really lol, i respect that.
---
The message I have been getting says that we are playing the game wrong. Chase meta or quit, apparently.
---
I’ve had plenty of problems with VATS melee. Both issues you’re having and more. I can watch the numbers roll off the enemy while they just stand there. I counted 8 hits against a rad roach one time. Numbers were rolling, some even crits, but no damage. 
---
I’d really like to play around with the Hack and Slash melee perk but if it only procs in VATS it will be a huge issue. To be fair my guns have had the same issue but it never seems as prevalent as in melee.
---
Oh, I misunderstood them then. I thought cards were account wise. My bad
---
I actually found the game to be quite boring pre nerf. I’m gonna have to agree with you
---
I work in props and costumes. Our clients include Disney and Broadway in NYC. I've art career has primarily been behind a computer. However my current job is 100% hands on in a studio. We are probably one of the least home based things one could imagine lol. And even if we could work the work isn't there and won't be for some time.
---
Yep. Same here. 1.6k to 333. Really?  Im really pissed about it but what am i gonna do?
---
you don't have to kill anything.
---
But you can also just play with the LoS, enemies come to you.
---
I was assuming Chinese Stealth armor/suit?
---
Nationalist SOCIALIST German Workers Party aka Nazis
---
He’s at the station now
---
Mods for the PC version of the game. Perk loadout manager, better inventory, improved health bar, PA huds that simplify the look, etc.
---
Same issue,  all my other revolvers are up but the .44
---
Luckily I carry a full set of troubleshooters wwr secret service armor with me for encryptid.... Came in real handy today and was able to solo the daily op even with that insane final boss.
---
Flyboy helmet has the same bug as the quack mask
---
Really? I have the bundle and didn't see it lol...will look again.
---
Nope, I love it too!! 💕
---
Fast travel to davenport
---
No mods for the game, like more info map, different crosshair and a bunch of quality of life mods, my favourite mod show your percentage of your health next to your Heath bar
---
would love to try a rifle/sneak build now since up close being a glass cannon doesn't seem worth it anymore..
---
Rt
---
Ah fair enough lol.
---
Inventory management is the real fallout76
---
Thats alot......
---
And don’t forget about our old buddy ***Mr. Super Duper***!!! Be sure to bring him along, too!
---
Nothing about the Burrows one is fun, at least on solo.
---
when you want to join the dailyOPs, you open a window, everything is right there.
---
That added with the level scaling I actually think they've done everything right with this update, it's still too early to tell but I'm loving it.
---
I was not impressed with what my rifleman build was doing. But then I switched to my bloodied pipe revolver and threw a tuned receiver on it. This meta values rate of fire much more than base damage
---
Bloodied is still good but you have other options now as well.  Just don't go Bloodied Rifleman, go Commando instead, they screwed slow firing weapons.
---
Yea i hear people complaining that use melee about how its useless but i found a random in a daily using super sledge and two hitting enemies. But i see people complaining that use bloodied handmade about how it takes 5 to 10 bullets instead  of 1 to 3 to kill an enemy and i was kinda surprised at how greedy people can be
---
came back after 2 months break, missed most of S1, the same will probably happen to S2 but those daily ops are neat and an all enemies are an actual challenge
---
Really? so its not worth using?
---
Ah. Thank you.
---
Ill be right with you as soon as I finish repairing my gear..
---
again...
---
Did manage to solo Elder it. 14 seconds to spare. Tbh I used an OP ranged weapon to take all the health from boss and finished him with a bash. But the rest was donde with my melee build adapted with the perks I described.
---
The way the respec system works on it's own I think is really flawed, but with the new damage module, a lot of players are going to have to respec for more combat efficiency rather than ease of life perks.
---
I just think the Legendary Perk system is flawed, and very brutal and punishing.
---
I ran pretty much your exact build when I started and I agree you should go full commando and take ground pounder in Perception as you’ll need it against groups.  Take sneak, covert operative, and escape artist in Agility. And with explosive rounds I run level 5 Demolition expert in Intelligence because it adds quite a bit of damage.
---
I'm glad it's not just me.
---
Trust me, it’s pretty horrible even with one.
---
Bloodied still deals slightly more dmg but if you go full health AA I think that you're gonna be alright
---
This is great advice!  Thanks!
---
What level are you at?
---
I absolutely love that I can do events in the forest and get decent xp from the kills now.
---
Just finished my first run, its was fun because I didnt have a melee weapon on me, all the robots would take damage and then be immune to ranged attacks at critical health, I had to BASH. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. OF. THEM.
---
It the most challenge and fun I’ve experienced in the game for a long time. 
---
Lvl380ish running a bloody heavy PA build.
---
Plus the new daily op ammo looting is is great for gun builds 
---
Did the mechanics exclusive to daily op or is it across the board?
---
Dont lie ffs
---
Last time you one shot anything you left payment on the table. and left
---
I have 400 levels in this game and i run exaxtly the same build supported with Chems.
---
It took me 3 shots of a Level 45 bloodied Pipe Rifle to kill a mongrel at Northolt farm.That once took just one.
---
All this extreme nerf has done has made all weapons other than quick firing automatics obsolete.
---
A dozen times? Does the respawn throttle apply in these as in other events? Or were you getting revived from either a buff or a player? A dozen deaths is probably 5 minute+ of time spent respawning.
---
But where's the Mothman camera skin :c
---
Maybe they werent ready for it yet or they were afk
---
I thought it was bugged! I’m there nailing everything with my 2 shot exploding lever action and that little sliver of health wouldn’t budge. Same as you, I finally read the description and had my “D’oh” moment.
---
Oh no... now u have to actually play the game instead of blowing thru everything....wwaaaaahhhhhh
---
Steel Dawn = October 
---
Fractured Steel = Nov
---
I don't think the exploding effect is going to cut it especially not with Rifles.    
---
My main go hit hard regarding damage. I have a 3 star Lever Gun that has that effect and was struggling to kill level 50 and 65 mole rats. WTH......  
---
My shotgun char's damage is down but not much. I'm not going to waste time changing my main over as I'll find  another way. I do have all the Commando Perks so I can switch them out easily I guess. Learning a new build and playstyle is going to be off.
---
I just got home and quickly ran to whitespring and a 3 star glowing ghoul was in golf club. Dude took 4 clips of bloodied fixer. Man it’s epic let me tell you
---
Cmon bruh u gotta communicate and coordinate to get into the instance together if u just join a random party and start an instance without a word then it iiiis what it iiiiis
---
Yea, lets mock the players who spent their entire game time making a heavy gunner power armor build, that will show them for trying to enjoy the game differently then you!
---
Do yo8 have the subscription service? Is it worth it?
---
Is that the best you can do Sweety.
---
Hate it when Schools out.
---
That’s helpful thank you, I took out serendipity
---
😂 that was beautiful and hilarious and I can relate!
---
Good luck with that m8
---
It’s really disheartening to see the patch list puffed out with these easy fixes that no-one asked for.
---
605
---
Perfect- thanks!
---
True true true
---
You're doing it wrong, get to 19% then try again. My bloody weap has base dmg of 271 my same exact tse is 131.
---
It's funny you think 'at or near level 50' as being low.    
---
My main is only 119 and my 2nd is 56. The latter one can take out enemies much easier than my first after this damage nerf.
---
I’m in your boat, around the same level.
---
But man, when I was level 70, which can still be an easy 100 hours into the game, I personally would have struggled with the challenge, but I would have preferred that than the breeze that it was.
---
And I've done it on 5 chars -- 4 were perfect.  The 5th one just stuck at 'pick up 1000/1000' and wouldn't progress, I had to restart from about 15m back.  At least by that point I was practiced.
---
naw. they stay until you use addictol. 
---
you need 5 of each thing you want to get addicted to. And you can just pop them one after the other rapidly.
---
I'll admit, skimmed during a zoom meeting.
---
I had assumed mole rats were classified as critters.
---
I hope it gets fixed soon. I want to go back and enjoy the new update.
---
Yhea, seems I am not the only one. Seems the focus has been for the end game players and end game gear and the "middle guys" kind of fell between the chairs before you have full rank and all decked out with the juicy stuff.
---
Hopefully a fix will come soon :) Will stick to Nuclear Winter until it does.
---
People will pay 500 caps plus for keycards. Assuming you can trade them of course.
---
I know dude I have no issues using the handmade rifle
---
O wow excellent!!!
---
It was hilarious the first 2 times then I started skipping the event so I agree.
---
Well, time to complain about something else then:  
---
Resilient Enemies suck. Clean and simple. The whole Daily Ops System is build on Teamplay, doing them alone is really hard, the enemies deal a truckload of dmg and you need to constantly swap weapons (because your bash-attack will hit 50/50) and enemies respawn constantly. The Boss is a bullet sponge with 0 strategy or weakpoints.  
---
Really, all of this is pretty doable in a team, but since solo is a thing there should be either matchmaking or some level of adjustment for soloplay.  
---
PS: Also, hope there will be a other perks for the enemies (can only be killed by an energy/ballistic/explosive weapon/can only be killed while out of power armor/in power armor/with a weapon made of 50% recycleable materials)
---
Pro tip on not being squishy.....
---
Use defensive perks.
---
Check a guide on YouTube. Be aware that once you build you will not be able to blueprint it and move as the structures would revert to straight angles
---
so has my bloodied hm and bloodied dc. more than 2/3 of the hp is gone. backpacks aren't working. fast travel is a pain. i'm reloading the game.
---
There’s a note in his tent :)
---
that makes zero sense.
---
I'm glad I've accumulated a set of almost entirely 3\* heavy leather troubleshooter. Feel like I am going to need it here. I think between a troubleshooter's Tesla and Death Tambo, with the right perks I might just be able to pull this off despite my normal build/playstyle of bloodied stealth rifleman - which would seem like the almost anti-optimized build for these events.
---
I remember too and I hated it just the same. The current system is basically like starting a new character. They should let us experiment with builds and not have to spend weeks to see if we even like it. Not sure why you are saying you're happy with the current system. It sucks...but to each their own. I would be happy with a system similar to other games, and am expressing my opinion on how to make the game better and I know for a fact you would enjoy it too. Don't lie to yourself...
---
Nice. Are you noticing a good difference when they LP are assigned?
---
They're only cosmetic i think. Don't know why it even exists.
---
Oof that makes sense now...
---
my best guess was Chameleon Scout Armor haha I missed the obvious
---
The never playing 76, every PVPer is a griefer, it's pay to win crowd are very vocal on this sub.
---
Magic guns are nice, I have one but no one should have to rely on it to be able to kill enemies. I have a min/max commando build and it’s doing just fine, likely because it’s the meta but they shouldn’t have nerfed the casual players. It’s just another idiotic oversight on Bethesda‘a part.
---
I'm like you. I'm really looking forward to signing on tonight.
---
I did try storing it and placing it again. Still to no avail. I’m just guessing it’ll fix itself at some point.
---
Yea, I wanted to put down the new weight bench and after deleting 3 things and still not being able to drop it, I tried putting something I deleted back and no-go. So now I'm afraid to delete anything else because I don't know if I'm over-budget or if it's a bug and I'm going to have to rebuild
---
Out of interest, what was your time? Just wanting to benchmark my run.
---
The one giving you r a d a w ay s haha well, I only liked the weight bench and the locker stash, everything else... let’s say I’m no going to actively do the scoreboard
---
You know it, much needed update. 👌👍👏👏👏👏👏
---
OhhhhhhhThe Irony ffs.
---
The loudest voices have been mard arses who lacked the mental aptitude to play the game, grind out decent armour and perfect a build.
---
Either too lazy,or too thick.
---
Going around with shit build instigating PVp and crying when they were one shot killed.
---
Piercing Gaze is always on.  Later on they may release some that don't have it but currently you are forced out of stealth in all of them.
---
No worries, I hope it suits how you want to play and makes the game more enjoyable for you
---
Wait it deleted your camp if you had the blueprint but didn’t have it placed down?
---
It has always had a prompt to hit Esc key for me.
---
Fire a two shot mirv inside vtu sometime. Make sure you have fireproof maxed.
---
The perks are locked into one character? I thought the whole point of legendary perks was to have them available to new characters right out of the vault, as long as you had earned them on another character
---
Most of this stacks. The Super Duper is base only.
---
No traps. I did have it in front of the red rocket garage, but have since moved it, stored it, scrapped it, reconnected wires, tried a new power source, closing game and logging back. 
---
Guessing it’ll work when it’s ready to. 💁🏽‍♂️ 
---
Over it at this point lol
---
I know, I just hate being that low.  I can play and not die pretty well at that level.
---
Maybe shotguns? You can basically get by without aiming down sights and because of the multiple projectiles they can be a bit more forgiving on accuracy anyway
---
Damn my melee character went from dealing 3k per hit to 400. Rip I guess
---
300 exp? Wtf that extremely low
---
Damn. I guess everyone should be switching to magic weapons now.
---
I guess that's one way to force Bethesda's hand and make them finally fix those magic weapons. It's taken a while.
---
That’s because your build wasn’t severely nerfed like many other people’s.
---
Been bugged for a while now and it sucks.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
I didn't really notice much difference?
---
My commando dmg isn't noticeably worse, but I haven't had a run at the SBQ, or Earle yet tonight.
---
It’s been like this for a while
---
The Nazis said a lot of things not all of them true, hitler was also very much against communism
---
What you are describing is not a hacked weapon more of an imaginary weapon from your mind. Nuke miniguns do exactly what you are describing but nobody has ever made a fixer to shoot MIRVs. I know all the good and bad of fallout 76 universe, if you insist this is real thenan image posted on imgur will instantly clear this up.
---
Read the post.  I'm no longer a daily player because the rpg aspects are not there for me anymore.  I'm not saying bye, read the post.
---
Also, there's a difference between being mad and crying like a bitch. One punches you in the fucking jaw while the other cries. I'm pissed. Go whine about crybabies on a bomber post
---
‘There’s no key labeled Any!!!’
---
No that is not the point
---
I dont need to have fun? In a game I play for fun? Ok.
---
Just not having to swap lockpicking and hacking in and out makes it worthwhile for me.
---
They nerfed everything.  Rifleman builds got nerfed harder than Commando
---
Nah thats the slots not the perks
---
You know not all of us complain about the nerf right, personally i like it. It adds more of a challenge to being a bloodied build and since im a bloodied gunslinger build the challenge of playing 76 now just got a whole lot harder which means more fun
---
My best 3 star combat rifle for mine is a Two Shot and only does 90 damage now. 😡
---
I am gutted.
---
Took me 400 levels of grinding for my armoury.
---
Bloodied players get accused of not playing the game.We were the most dedicated. Spending countless hours grinding.
---
for me and my playstyle SPECIALs are pretty much all there is..
---
YMMV
---
The tent thing is just an Easter egg guys congrats on finding it.....next pls😇
---
With max rank, ammosmith and super duper its crazy, when you convert them to ultracite its borderline ridiculous :-)
---
It would be better if a jolly talking paper clip danced in from the bottom corner of your screen and pointed at the upper right corner where words are, then at your HUD map on an endless loop until you figure it out.
---
Right.  Because disagreeing with you equals crying. You're not worth engaging.
---
They changed their name to appeal to the working class
---
I actually managed to switch easy to commando, but I already had the perks and the weapons for it. True sniping builds will have a much harder time with their IE levers or whatever they traded for. Many of my guns will be collecting some dust
---
Thankfully no. It's only three seconds. Power armor definitely keeps you alive. It was still excruciating.
---
Oh for sure, when a legitimate massive bug like that exists for that long, it can kill a player base. It’s hard to say why it wasn’t fixed sooner, but sadly I’m sure it was someone’s priority. They may have needed extra help, they may not have had all the info needed to find it, and it may have been such a bad bug that it required a mass rewrite to fix. Not saying it’s impossible someone ignored it, it’s not unheard of. But I’m hard pressed to say that they wanted that bug to exist seeing how it would hurt their numbers. Still... whatever the case, it should NOT have gone so long. Things that huge should be top priority among the team and multiple people should be prioritizing it. Idk, dev teams are a weird place to be. 
---
And I couldn’t agree more on your first point... people came to this hot off the coattails of fallout 4. This looks like fallout 4, it plays like 4, and hell it shares a lot of code from 4. But as much as people expected 4, 76 is a totally different thing. People weren’t prepared for the grind, but the devs intended for this to be more of an mmo experience. Sadly, I feel the game was marketed to the wrong group of gamers. If they came out from the very beginning and made it perfectly clear what the game was meant to be, we may not have had that initial massive wave of disappointed gamers expecting Fallout 4, pt 2. That was on the marketing team, a team that literally KEPT messing up for MONTHS. The marketing for this game was an absolute fiasco
---
Not sure how "Bethesda is the best epistemically poised to make a decision about the direction of their game" can be post seriously.
---
Ammo factory is pretty good
---
Yeah, I can put foundations on a resource gatherer, but not the camp doohickey. Why?
---
Not saying it isn't happening, just that I have never seen it and if I didn't read redditt then I would not know about it.
---
Considering when most of the complaints are posted, it seems to happen most to those who are playing close to reset time, and since I work days I don't play till generally 8 or 9 hours after daily reset.
---
That is just my experience, you don't need to get mad at me cause I don't have the same experience as you.
---
Ayyy you rock stay healthy out there
---
I’m cracking open a cold one in honor of this thread too
---
Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
---
You still destroy mostly everything with your build.  
---
Other Legendary Effects (Anti Armor/Instigating/TSE) are more used now because their dmg is less affected by raw numbers (E has other scaling with perks e.g.)  
---
Magic weapons seems to work less frequent it seems, SBQ didnt instantly die today, neither did earle (pretty sure at least 1-3 guys used one today)
---
The higher level almost always drop you a new item.  
---
\- Enough thoughts, here is an opinion: Raise the item level to 100, Add some new perks/effects, add new weapons.
---
It’s level based, I got an anti armor Grognak axe and instigating missile launcher from level 50 wolves.
---
Its ok on PS4. Works and have ”pistols” on rank 3
---
They can only die by melee, so you have to bash them or play melee
---
Yes enjoy it :)
---
No there are not, you should check your setup
---
My Bloodied pipe revolver base damage went from 558 to 244. Had all Rifleman perks and 3 Gunslinger, 1 Expert and 1 Master and ofc all the other perks/mutations for Bloodied.
---
Not really most dont buy 50 cal anyway it's the other ammos that people buy
---
Go back to singleplayer then; there saved you the hassle of crying about losing your exploit abusing.
---
Its not bad, but i wish it lasted longer like other camp buffs
---
I didnt even look at the damage change tbh. Just noticed everything was taking a lot more bullets to take down.
---
Personnaly I am having a lot of fun with everything in that patch, dailyOps included. But I also played a lot on PTS so I know what to expect.
---
DailyOps mutations are totally random but, the setup robot + resilient, for this opening day is the most difficult combo.
---
Maybe bethesda should have forced an easier one for today at least ;)
---
You would need to append it the end.
---
The Chat Mod should be the last one on the "sResourceArchive2List"
---
I think there are issues if you put it further up the list.
---
My Fallout76Custom.ini file looks like this. (Granted, alot of mods don't work right now due to the patch that dropped today.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/s0vvJuE](https://imgur.com/a/s0vvJuE)
---
I'm guessing you hadn't worked on a build for multiple months to get nerfed?
---
I'm with ya for the most part.  
---
But doing daily ops solo with resilient enemies suck, since bashing on weapons mostly sucks.  
---
Daily ops should have matchmaking.
---
Or you could finally put those tomahawks sitting in your stash to good use.  They count as melee damage and are much more fun then bashing to finish of the robots
---
Every vendor I enter into lags way more and takes huge amounts of time compared to the converter which lags literally none.
---
A standard optimised melee build is one with all the damage perks for a single category, it's not some hyper detailed minmax thing
---
True, it does look appealing at the top ... but you really have to commit to it. I’m still trying to figure out which legendary direction to go.
---
Boo hoo you can't one shot every mod in the game anymore......I welcome the change you should not be able to kill everything with a single shot or hit.
---
The respawn time doesn't increase, but it does respawn you in a random fucking spot every time, which is a huge pain in the ass in a maze like the Burrows.
---
I'm going the other way, all my guns are now primed.
---
The ammount of ammo you get with the ammo-perks in unbelievable.
---
Was out today, would have been great for my Vampire Guitar Sword and Vampire Shiskebab.
---
I get that.
---
Base damage in my opinion was never the real issue.
---
I have never been able,or capable to one shot a Queen.
---
Those that were doing extreme damage were not doing it with the Base damage.They were exploiting Chems,food etc,stacking,that was always the problem.
---
Seems to me they thought fuck it.
---
Rather than deal with real issue stacking etc.Just Nerf the whole build by 50 %
---
So those able and capable of circumventing this Nerf will continue.
---
Whilst we are punished.
---
You can shoot until enemies have a sliver of health, then gun bash.  No melee weapon required.
---
Thanks for confirmation either way well worth it to get this perk !
---
My dude my guns do anywhere from 5-30 less damage per shot and while that sounds like a lot it isn't all that bad. I wasn't sure what to expect because Iv'e heard to many conflicting opinions from the PTS but in reality it isn't bad at all. My build hasn't changed at all, just gotta stack those cards right and you'll be fine! :)
---
Honestly i thought i would hate 1 wasteland, but it has been so far the funnest thing ive done in a while. I tried to do radiation rumble, (their is level 60 ghouls) and i failed lol but the xp was ridiculous. Im the shittiest inspect bloodied build ever, my blodied gatling gun does 187 dam and i 4 to 6 shot the ghouls and every other was dropping about 12 to 15 ammo. So im ending in the positive there. Idk maybe its just me but the dam nerf is not bad
---
I looked at his old posts and he seems to reject any anonymity associated with the internet, but yet has a word and a year as his screen name and not his actual real name. So I guess he realized that he doesn't even live up to his own standards of posting and just logged off?
---
If u dont understand that, u need to put the controller down and get out more
---
Of course it can. How convenient, a 100str unarmed build won't one-shot earle just in time for a 100str unarmed build to be possible
---
The easy respond...i new someone would say that. 
---
To make it more obvious, as apparently you think that an Hammade pulls more dps than a 50.cal, use a Gatling Plasma. The Handmade vs the Gatling Plasma...the Gatling Plasma can not only make more damage but it can sustain its dps for a longer period of time. And with an optimised build you can reload your Gatling Plasma even quicker.
---
Other then drugs an buffs. Commando &amp; Sniper builds are pretty much "V.A.T.S" builds. In group activies, especially in Scorched Earth and a Colosal Problem, these builds should mostly focus on adds.
---
Unless you have the build and the team do that ( at 1:30 ) -&gt; https://youtu.be/vDg3XY5WMSA you should focus on adds to make sure everybody can go back into the dps phase as soon as possible. PA builds do not have the build to V.a.t.s. the ground all day in the Scorched Earth Event. They are built to maintain, sustain dps.
---
&gt;Is this seriously the way they went?
---
they have literally been pimping it mercilessly for months
---
But the bug is still in
---
Wish it were a flat hour, but I'll take it.
---
All ammo though.  I was just using 50 cal as an example.  I sell 50 cal ammo easily in my vendors
---
As in you don't need that amount of damage, the nerf is barely noticeable. Your build is the problem if you're feeling it.
---
Would you be willing to trade anything for some plans? Caps guns anything I guess
---
I mean I’m already an ultra casual player anyway. I tend to come back for a week or two then go away for a few months to half a year before repeating the cycle.
---
We also still have the Radeon reflections issue that has existed since Wastelanders.
---
I just realized this. Hope the fix this.
---
If these other improvements don't happen fast I'm checking out. I shouldn't have to use over five clips and 6 stims to run Man Hunt.
---
As a stealth v.a.t.s sniper you'll never enjoy uplink
---
Which is how it works in ESO if you do not have a good build. Not a fan of One Tamriel and that makes me worried about this.
---
Are the legendary perks active now? If so, I played for like 4 hours and didnt get anything.
---
The special cards, ammo factory. The one that gives poison resistance. Everything else is pretty trash. The one card I wanted the most was heavy duty but I guess they decided not to add it last second.
---
Not necessarily.
---
I'm an end game player on most of my toons, and don't have a purpose for caps, so I buy ammo. I can make it, but I like the convenience of not having to swap my cards around, and if someone is selling it at a cap a piece, I'll buy em out of stock.
---
Best of luck. I main a sniper and it’s already been a struggle.
---
Wait, what?  Just stay on it and you keep getting a +2?
---
It's been very rare that I get to do RadRum with more than a couple others, so with two of us defending there isn't much ore gathering. 
---
The times I have seen max rewards has been when we had a full team of people who knew what to do, so we would send out two to gather while the other two defended, and then switch but thats been rare.
---
Crouching, stealthboys.
---
No use for keeping my firework in the grenade slot thanks for the tips
---
I have a job and a life fucktard. Get bent.
---
I don't think many solo players like playing with others.
---
Was really hoping to be blown away by this week's shop...
---
You have to be able to fast travel first...
---
Alr mate just because you dont like the perks doesnt mean it's a bad system me and other heavys are thankful for ammo factory perk and others about survival bypass and master locksmith and hacker one I and many others like the system as it gives higher level plays a reason to play and fir lowers ti get rid of useless perk cards
---
Oh I agree about Fallout itself, I still hate the stash in general. (I always enjoyed collecting unique items or even apparel items), I Can't do that anymore cause my stash space doesn't allow for it.
---
I have a Stealth Commando character, unfortunately it is the only way I can possibly hope to do these daily ops. I'm just glad the melee mutation isn't up every day, so it might be better with other mutations. I can understand why they don't allow stealth though.
---
I truly hope that they add more modes on Daily Ops, cause I can see it become boring very quickly. Constantly having to run to the same spot and killing the same end boss.
---
Dude. I’m a PA HW Junkie spec and I’m doing just fine against the new mobs. Sure, they take more to kill but I’m still whooping ass and take next to zero damage. Go get a melee weapon if you hate bashing and throw it in the equip wheel. You’ll be good to go. The Ops are borked right now, so don’t panic. And don’t let others piss you off...easy for me to say heh.
---
I lost 33 base damage on the LA rifles. That coupled with nothing being under lvl 50 anymore eats up bullets. VATS seems to hit for 70ish vs 230+ head shot without. Might be the vats portion thats not right.
---
I don't get what's so exciting about some of these features. One Wasteland has hardly made any difference in my experience, and the special ops are...pretty bleh.
---
Yes this is another issue i have. It's like the first hit don't count when i smash something. It's about 50/50 on if it does damage.
---
Get off then get back on. Keeps stacking +2
---
I'm a lvl 791, I know the punishing grind all too well at this point. I will say it is much easier to gain perk cards and points at lower levels, As a lvl 791 I need somewhere in the range of 200,000+ XP to level up just once....the higher your level the tougher the grind gets, I wouldn't spend any coin until you know exactly which build direction you are going to go, but brutal choices and no going back totally.
---
Your right I shouldn't but I also should not be getting one shot
---
yeah I just did it solo, it was annoying to run up to them and melee them, if I didn't have to do this I would probably do it under 8mins (did it in 8m50s). I just switched to my tankiest power armor and healed up some rads, it wasn't that difficult
---
She should turn Pacifist mode on.
---
I shall give it a try. I was just about to switch perks over to a straight riflemen again.  
---
I loved my Instigating explosive pipe revolver rifle build I had for about a year. Could one shot everything in the game except for bosses but 'The Times they are a changin'.
---
 I'm going to have to dig through my stash of God tier rifles I've saved over the past couple years.
---
*FEAR THE FIST!*
---
What is a daily Op ?
---
Mine is Mr. Cuddlesworth
---
Everyday you learn something new about fallout 76, most of the time things where drugs must have be involved
---
Glad I read this. I honestly thought the one wasteland update meant they were introducing cross play.
---
You could swap over to commando pretty easily if your a sniper build now
---
some areas have a minimum level that the enemies will appear as but you should be able to do alot better there now.
---
Yes it is.
---
Nah you're fine. And it's all good, just make sure you finish reading them!
---
I haven’t hopped in yet, gotta update but I only update during the night. I also don’t have any legendary builds either. Is it really that different? I’m a shot gunner, mainly use vats cuz that’s the only way I can guarantee the damage sticks
---
I kmow what you mean, I tend to use VATS a fair bit, and done my fair share of using my entire AP bar, waiting to get enough AP for my bash.
---
At the very least, we don't have to do the melee finisher every day.
---
Edit: Oh, happy cake day by the way!
---
Np!
---
There ya go.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/mark-error-404/video/109812699
---
Probably. When I asked him to give us his real full name he disappeared.
---
My buddy has been at 30k caps for months and has almost every plan in the game. Most of the time he just says,"all well" when he gets the caps from SBQ or Earl. He buys ammo too, even if he has 10k and only uses a Lever Action lol.
---
Okay makes sense for TSE but every energy weapon and explosive gun also breaks incredibly fast on top of lower damage to begin with, it's really not necessary
---
wear PA
---
\*and dense
---
  This was the only thing about it I was concerned about.  I hope they add a confirmation window.
---
&gt;secondly it also automatically unlocks player owned objects.
---
Can it even get the explosive trait?
---
But it was fine there are people who play casually. Most people play casually the game should be accessible to all
---
I CAN FINALLY ENTER VAULT 94!!
---
Yeah. Really sucks for stealth players. Oh well I was considering switching to heavy guns anyway, maybe now is the time.
---
Oh fuck yeah, buying that now.
---
Good times!  You must miss them.
---
In my opinion, it doesn't work as well because they're trying to make it some hybrid and please too many people at once.  I would much prefer to have a full-blown fallout MMO.  That's like my dream.
---
That being said i like the game for what it is.  I've invested more hours into 76 than all the other fallout games combined.
---
I am level 430 and I couldn't figure out how to kill them at first. If that depresses you, talk to a therapist? Most people don't bother to read quest text in most online games I've played.
---
Except for people like me who are build purely on the 50.cal machine guns
---
Wayne Gretzky, greatest NHL player of all tie, couldn't bench half that
---
He was actually the weakest person on the team at the bench press
---
It is, and it was pointed out along with the various flaws on the test server.  We still have what we have and if any other systems in the game are an example, this is it.
---
The inference was that it was an account system.  That either changed or was poor wording.  It’s a per-character one, 5x the grind of whatever you expected if you play multiple characters.  The system itself pushes you to finely narrow your character’s diversity in order to maximize the system.  Raw levels?  Time played?  Nope, non-destructive suggestions were ignored and we got these asinine coins.  
---
To be clear, I’m not a fan of calling things a grind.  Anything with work involved tends to get called a grind in a game.  My view is that when the finish line for a system could stretch into infinity + stunts character diversity forcing you to take on the system again = a grind.  The paragon concept of diablo 3 would be ideal:  legendary character is leveling your account with a separate XP bar and separate progression.  Nope, that’s not “the vision”.  
---
So you’re right.  It’s a bad system.  You’ll get a lot of downvotes as negative viewpoints on patch day tend to do that.  Mothman help you if you decide you don’t like the card you dumped 100s of levels of coins into, or even worse, they add new cards.  Haha jk on that, again, this is all we get.  It’s something, it just could have been more with over a year since the system was teased.
---
melee has been nerfed the hardest. it's still viable of course, just a lot weaker.
---
hybrid builds are the future. why go all in on heavies and waste thrice as much ammo on trash mobs when you could be relying on sneak multipliers? of course sneak is useless in daily ops and bosses, but with the special perks and a ton of levels you can run both heavy gunner and commando.
---
I explained already to someone in these comments why I mentioned level. Has nothing to do with being a higher level means you use exploits. Has more to do with usually higher level players have really elaborate nice camps and it’s gonna suck to rebuild those. If you don’t use them then this post wasn’t for you so keep it moving and don’t get butthurt lmao
---
 I enjoy farming materials and run a modest bullet shop so I'm less concerned about gear and ammo upkeep so much as general sucking at video games, lol.
---
I'll take this as your way of saying my gear and build must be pretty decent, and I sincerely appreciate it. :D
---
if they're already crafted, they have the old loot table fyi.
---
XBox One
---
That sounds terrible.  Quick question: The new damage  model, does it apply to nw?
---
Two things: realistic mag sizes and FIX VATS ALREADY.
---
They patched that but have fun ig
---
I have the same thing, deleted a bunch of nonessential stuff, but still at or above budget. I have never had an Ammunition Factory, because I know it will be said.
---
Between the quest prompts in the upper right, voice over dialogue, yellow markers floating above the uplinks and markers on your HUD map, how can it be more obvious?
---
I guess they could drag some golf carts into the dungeon to shuttle you directly from one objective to the other, or set up a service where a dev comes to your house, stands over your shoulder and tells you to turn left or right as needed.
---
It used to. Radiums have been nerfed so hard they are terrible weapons, but I still want one lol.
---
Yes. Sorry for not elaborating.
---
Yeah what I did was just shoot them until I stop doing damage, then one bash would finish them off.
---
Agreed though, matchmaking should for sure be a thing!
---
Dude. It’s Bethesda. This shit is always broken when it’s rolled out. The only question is how long before they fix it...
---
Yeah? My stealth build is f\*\*ked over completely. What's the point of a stealth build if not even sh\*\*\*y ghouls will die in one hit anymore?
---
I hate this level scaling nonsense, what's the point of leveling up your character if the enemies remain the same no matter what? Why oh why does it take a full magazine of headshots to kill a raider? Who knows?! BALANCE.
---
An option to turn this off would be greatly appreciated. Lvl10s have no business venturing into high level areas, pandering to this perpetual lowbie demographic screws others over.
---
miss who
---
Caps and ammo I have plenty of but everything else is fair game!
---
If you use the search function a wonderful human put together a chart that shows all the ammo from every weapon you get with ammosmith &amp; legendary perk!
---
They don't work on it alas...
---
"Barely noticeable"
---
That was a really good joke. Can you tell me another one? My power fist does about 1k less damage and all my heavies do about 200-300 less damage.  If you think thats "barely noticeable" by all means tell me the god tier build you run
---
Booooooooooooo
---
For me.
---
What Rads. It replaces sunkissed
---
Master Infiltrator. It replaces all of my hacking and lockpicking perks. Even at its base card.
---
they're underwhelming compared to handmades and fixers. other than that, they perform exactly as you'd expect.
---
don't really know why they're legacy. Bethesda probably just selected every energy weapon and disabled the explosive trait for them without really looking.
---
I’ll try that out!  Got a stalkers 25/25 just the other day!
---
How is junkies gauss a magic weapon?
---
Yes it’s too much. It’s a legacy weapon and so will never drop. 
---
What you need to do is get your self a B2525 fixer and then trade for an explosive radium rifle.
---
I’m saying just because you’re a high level player that doesn’t mean you use glitches. I’m saying it’s gonna suck for those high level players that DO use glitches to have to rebuild their nice camps. Learn to read or keep it moving
---
Those are legacy. If you don’t have one you’ll need to find someone willing to trade, and you’ll probably need a very strong offer. 
---
Check one of the bartering subs for those opportunities.
---
The problem isn't that they nerfed all god roll weapons and brought harder enemies the problem is they nerfed all the other weapons that NEEDED bloodied, or Junkies to be useful. Ever try to kill a Super mutant with a 10mm pistol. They aren't worth trying to use now. They've practically made pistols scrip weapons.
---
I'ma change that character to a heavy I guess because it'll be the easiest to convert to. I just looked at my instigating deathclaw and it only does 50 damage less than my bloodied one 😒
---
The good times you had playing this game.
---
Weirdly, that’s what I had; Blood Eagles, chameleon, Gallery. Maybe I got in early enough before it switched?
---
Same here nothing entertaining about shooting fish in a barrel. The double standard on exploits here is laughable.
---
When you go to your perk menu look at the very top, there is a legendary perk section now!
---
There is a perk called Ammo factory that stacks with Ammo Smith so you can now craft a LOT more ammo! :)
---
Now we are going to read endless posts about not being able to do the kitchen counters and whatever thing they did with the broken camp items 😅 also RIP line in the sand fun
---
Unless your char is under 50 am I right? My main two are 119 and 56.
---
Not anymore. Those are legacy.
---
It’s a funny meme to pretend otherwise but yeah I’m one player with one perspective and one preferred play style and they’re the actual studio that made the game and have a constant influx of data points and metrics they use to make changes, including the majority of player feedback that asked them to get one wasteland added in the first place ::)
---
I was once down there for nearly an hour redeeming what I had saved up.  Though the rewards were better than the Atlas crates, so there's that.
---
Oh dear, are you ok? You appear to be losing the plot a little, no one is threatening you, laughing at you sure, but threatening? No. 
---
Note to self: don't engage with the angry little men, just let them be angry, and little.
---
i had none of those
---
Fastest time for me was 8.45
---
Just one small note. I just switched to third person and my rate of fire is not as fast as in first person, not sure why that’s the case but it’s definitely a huge difference
---
I don’t notice much of a change aside from the levels of enemies. Things still spawn as they used to but now it takes a bit more hits to kill. I personally enjoy it as it was quite boring to be able to 1-2 hit even the highest level enemies in any area. Now I need to properly plan where I go and make sure things are fixed and in working order. I will probably play more often. I give the update a 👍🏻
---
I Just looked at my phone notification, funny, you sound so caring , as to before you commented then you deleted “ I think this belongs in r/crackheads” stop trying to act like you care and are the shit because yesterday your post got a shit-ton of upvotes.
---
Well, hopefully some other people can report their testing since I am just one stoner and like I said I haven’t tried with the new legendary perk or stat boosting aid...
---
I agree, mobs auto leveling as you level is not good design. As soon as I saw Forest Max Level is 50 I knew there were problems. 50 is basically "max level" in the original design, so forest max level should be 25 at most.
---
I also loved in Morrowind going back to tough areas and kicking arse, ah sweet revenge.
---
Exactly.
---
Sorry, I have a life and don't follow this religiously. What an awful game decision.
---
I heard they were fun once upon a time, I just want to pretend they're still good lol. They're hardly an energy weapon as they dont use energy ammo, so I dont get it. I'm bored of the heavy guns, and although radiums are super weak, why not right?
---
I agree. Already at almost rank 8 on the scoreboard and had a great time doing it, my camp is now a much better source of XP since cultists are spawning at level 50 or higher instead of a level 5... and I run a very basic food/shotgun build. Went over to West Tek and had a jolly good time with some more formidable Super Mutants, it’s a blast to be challenged again.
---
They really did melee dirty. I think I’m mainly just going to use shotguns now
---
Oh I have no idea why he got banned. I was asking if you knew.
---
I havnt played in ages now, but this sounds interesting. 
---
Though there's only really one thing that will make me come back, is there a text chatbox on pc version yet?
---
You are incredibly gullible lol.
---
There is a delay,  = server lag, so usually like 1 sec, holding the trigger on an auto your first few shots won't proc it.
---
idk question 2, but sneak attacks get disabled if your team mates are in combat I'm pretty sure
---
IKR?! All my armor and weapons was at full durability so I went to clear out Poseidon for the weekly workshop challenge and within 10 minutes two of my armor pieces and my main gun were all broken.
---
I haven't received it either. Would appreciate some clarification!
---
u/Ladydevann u/LoneVaultWanderer u/Valseek
---
Yup! Ty
---
The thing is, you already had an option to fine tune the challenge according to your liking or mood of the day. Wanted a more challenging experience? Just had to unequip a few perks. More challenge? Stash your legendary gear and craft regular ones. Even more challenge? Craft Lvl 1 weapons and run without any armor. Want to just chill and run through Appalachia one-shotting everything like a boss? Get yourself a nice bloodied rifle, equip some perks, acquire some mutations and that's it.
---
I really don't get when people say this game wasn't challenging enough. Of course it wasn't, but that's because these people used to play at 20% Health, with all perks, mutations, food and chem buffs stacked, B2525 Fixer or any of the magic weapons and Full Uny AP Sentinel armor 24/7, and wondering why the game was easy af...
---
i’m just being an ass, i enjoyed the wastelanders update but nothing else has been fun imo. i’m waiting for the brotherhood update
---
I feel it was done to even the playing field due to all the ammo exploits that have occurred.
---
Please. Your the one having a shit fit. Lol. You brought in downvotes and all that, because you believe in them. And when you find out that someone else doesn't care either way about them, you have to try and come up with something else.
---
Because you just can't handle the fact you are wrong, you made stupid statements, and you couldn't get under my skin because of downvotes.
---
Oh deary.
---
I m gonna spam my vampire tesla like nobody business today. Win win for all players
---
Cheers 🍻  thank you for taking the time to share this link, I greatly appreciate your time, and efforts. I kind of feel I was a bit inpatient, mind you my excitement may have gotten the best of me. 
---
I wish you all the best! 😊
---
I have a B2525 currently, I'd trade it fo sho
---
Yep, stealth commando here. I gave it a shot solo without changing my load out, got destroyed. Went full defensive and it's doable. Sentinels or trouble shooter gear would really help. My biggest problem was getting lost. I'm hoping this op is at the high end of the difficulty scale, otherwise I'm not going to be able to keep up with ammo\gear repair\chems ect
---
You should watch the videos of Jug on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzPUmfv960), he made some quite impressive round bases a while ago. Made 2 myself and it's a lot of work but worth it. Oh, and while you can blueprint it - you will not be able to put it down somewhere else.
---
the tropic lightning camo skin? that's not the R91.
---
Dude I got shredded by that assaultron in the daily ops, haven’t had anything that challenging since I was low level
---
Don't you mean Unforseen? Oh, wait....wrong game.
---
This is SO stupid.
---
No need for magic weapons
---
 I run bloodied heavy gunner power armor build but the final word 50 cal and I still didnt feel any change in difficulty
---
I ran it with only my buddy and got Knight Rank. Used an instigating explosive minigun with explosive expert maxed, hit the crowds to wipe them to 1 hp, then my buddy ran through hitting them with a baton to quickly dispatch them. Final boss was killed in 20 seconds.
---
I mean, yeah. but my point is that they work as intended. nothing broken about legacy radium rifles.
---
Milkin the brahmin sucks ass tho
---
Yeah but not everybody is going to watch angry turtle. I'm sure hes a nice guy but I can't with his accent. 90% of the time I am rewinding the video to figure out what he said.
---
Have a nice day ! :)
---
Oh! Gotcha! Sorry haha!
---
Early
---
looks like somebody tried the ammo factory exploit. Woops.
---
Guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  I prefer the insane tankiness of power armor.  Now even more so.
---
Ad victoriam.
---
Just out of curiosity i tried a merge and it worked just as always. Saw some say it wasn’t possible anymore. Still have the blueprint for the ammo factory and my camps load just fine too. You just make this part up?
---
Yeah, did that as well; But bashing still not always registers on enemies.
---
Have to check it out.
---
What are some other good ones?
---
I’ll try to find it. Thank you!
---
They don't work
---
With only one person it takes roughly 2:30 per uplink, leaving you with &gt;3 minutes to navigate to each one, kill the final group of mobs, and then kill the boss. Getting Elder while solo is possible, but on this map it's tough unless you've got that shitty maze memorized.
---
put a few of them ammo machines down, eh?
---
Maybe if you punch them or something  idk lol
---
Me neither
---
It is the 4th reward you get.
---
I presume your over level 50? if so on perk cards at top is a legendary bar, click that and that will take you to legendary perk cards.
---
If memory serves me right it was found in the code under items listed with the atx tag. They seem to use that tag even for scoreboard rewards as a way to prevent you from building them in others camps. So who knows.
---
I wonder how much of the game you’ve missed out on, then.  
---
How many hours have you played?
---
Dude obviously a player who is level 300 has most likely spent more time working and perfecting and decorating their camp in comparison to a level 20 player who probably hasn’t done all that much. Which means it’s gonna suck worse for them BECAUSE they have spent more time working on it. This is nothing against high level players. If you wanna make the post something it’s not because you misinterpreted it and now dug yourself a hole that’s fine. Be my guest being an idiot
---
thanks for the great info much appreciated 🙏
---
One tiny line of text before you enter the mission indicates you have to kill them with melee.
---
Complete and utter wank, I know.
---
Out of loop here.  There are enemys that can be onky killed a certain way or something???  What? Resilient enemies? What?
---
You know that means the Daily SCORE challenges, not the regular dailies, right?
---
So its only useful for boss fights because everything dies anyway within a second if I hold the trigger in vats on a targeted head.
---
2/5 daily... challenges
---
Not quests.
---
Not bugged.
---
Lools like a mismatch teletubby mask if you ask me.
---
"realistic magazine sizes"
---
Looks at my quad double barrel
---
I was really worried being a bloodied unarmed build. Yeah my damage dropped a BUNCH, but I'm still 1-2 shotting everything except a SBQ or Earle. Not gonna lie though, seeing my power fist damage going from 1.1k-1.7k (depending on various factors) down to 390-500....broke my heart.
---
Just get water purifiers.  They spit out rad free water with literally no effort.  As for food, kill brahmin and cook them, infinite food.
---
In some other games its a micro transaction. I don't want that lol. Respeccing in most cases is still faster than grinding from level 1-50+. Most builds arent complete until the 60s.
---
It's been okay. Lots of poor performance and the battle pass isn't a great system to stick with.
---
Who threatened you?
---
r/fallout is more popular
---
no idea i have two characters though. after w hole the game just became bland and boring so i gave up and deleted it
---
Huh, now that I take a closer look at it it does have more of an AR15 vibe. I guess I thought it'd be the same one as in that promo picture.
---
I figure Ill make ammo until everyone else works out what the best cards are. You can never have too many bullets :-)
---
Oop, was it worth the 5.56
---
All jokes aside this is pretty stupid. Scaling enemies is a terrible concept.
---
Honestly I think it feels a bit better and balanced, but as a shotgunner I’d say you should be very comfortable. Admittedly there are some weapon classes that seem more of a hassle to work with such as unarmed, one-handed and energy-based heavy guns
---
1) did you exploit and add an ammo machine to your camp?
---
2) were you outside vault 51?
---
It's a pain in the ass to gun bash them though as a power armor build, as that's very ap intensive!
---
No but you read my reply to theirs I never got mad at them,  just your comment wasn't needed,  I literally put lol as in I thought it was a joke.  Noones mad dude
---
Bash.
---
Yeah, I think ours is like 150 mbps, but still really fast for what I do.
---
Me and 2 other guys ran it in under 7 min 3x in a row.  Once you know what's coming, have 1 with heavy Vampire chew up the bots while the others get in close for the kills.
---
Know the routes so you don't get lost.  Hit the final boss hard.
---
Turn off your addons if you have them, some will interfere with the interface for legendary perks (perk loadout manager does at least).

# READ THE DAILY OPS INFO IN GAME
---
Yeah mate. I run a pistol build on one of my characters. He's doing fine on new update with his 10mm. 150 damage per headshot, not the 500+ I was used to, but decent enough. Kills all the supermutants without issue.
---
Legacy laser rifle meanwhile still stomping everything like broken crazy.
---
Definitely notice the drop on my junkies weapons. Glad I picked up a bunch of quad lvc :)
---
Edit: Based on the down votes, apparently I'm the only one who thinks his pistol build fella is fine after update! Or I'm not allowed to kill mutants without issue? Seven 10mm shots, to get 500 xp from a lv 100 mutie. Is that too hard?
---
Well, I really don’t mind the challenge, but my personal take on this based on my character that runs (until now at least) stealth commando with chinese armor is that those like me does not rely on low health buffs or high ammo capacity of heavy weapons are set to have a really hard time, specially for those who like to run solo.  
---
Problem is that at the same time that our damage is nerfed, NPCs are stronger across the map. So, the less damage we do, more bullets are thrown away, more slow reloads (bye bye fireworks), more damage taken, more stimpacks used, more repair costs (armor and weapon). So we are going to spend more time farming for ammo and aids instead of focus on the game events/missions. 
---
Of course crafting and farm for materials are part of the game core but still, I can spend thousands of 5.56 rounds in a matter or few minutes depending on what event/mission I am doing. Sure we can buy ammo... for now.  Until it become scarce item. 
---
But it it just my first take on this.  Let’s see how does it play long term.
---
Edit: the good part is that we get more XP across the map and level up faster!
---
I couldn't do it alone but an glad that no matter what type of group you're in, it says next to the players name if they are in daily ops. When you click on your daily ops options it then says join team. We were able to do it with 2 people but no way I can do it alone. My melee weapons got nerfed in the update and I'm not thrilled.
---
Honestly idk....but I'm open to offers if you don't find one by this evening. It doesn't match my character so am looking to part with it.
---
Bloodied, 25% faster fire rate, 15% faster reload
---
Electric absorption makes energy damage heal you in PA, it's ridiculous
---
Throwables do not count.
---
My guess is it will be set so you can "lock" the interior cell loading portal, be it a door or hatch, so that only you and teammates can enter or you can have it unlocked so any may enter via that door.
---
Do you people know how to read...?
---
Give us bigger magazines, at least. Just did Jail Break--*Jail Break*--and every single SM took 40-50 rounds to kill. Went through 800+ rounds and still lost since I was reloading for the 73rd time when the suicider hit the door.
---
This shit is *beyond* ridiculous.
---
I guess Bethesda won't rest until everyone's a PA/heavy/Bloodied build.
---
In other news, the Ammo Factory legendary perk is no longer optional. It is required.
---
I wanted to put down the new weight bench and was at the budget limit. Deleted a few things and still couldn't place it. Tried putting something I deleted back and no-go. So I'm over budget and I wasn't before.
---
You on Xbox? I can give ya some
---
Yeah, spraying is what you do with tesla, no vats for me.
---
Does that mean I should come back now? Haven't touched fo76 since the last fuck up
---
A bugged Bethesda game?  I don’t believe you.
---
Made just enough ammo yesty to get me through my play session, was saving my mats for exactly this today. I'm so excited! EEEEEEK!! 😍😍😍
---
Good thing I don’t use any of those weapon types \^\^ thanks for letting me know
---
I'm sticking mine at the rusty pick
---
It's still the top DPS build.
---
I just switched to bloodied unarmed a couple weeks ago. Bad timing on my part haha. Still better than having to worry about ammo imo
---
Yep. First solo run was 8:02 (boss spawned in the room upstairs). Second solo run was 7:42.
---
Scrap all the cards, level up, repeat.
---
Idk what type of gun it was for sure but it looked small to me and definitely shot MIRVs lol. It couldve been a mini as I was fairly far away when he was shooting it. I'll ask next time he's online which might be later tonight
---
You have to melee them.
---
Use a good heavy gun then final bash them.
---
O my cards were stacked very right. Went from 1900-3000 damage upper damage if I added food  to 300 damage at most. That's huge especially since melee misses half the time or just outright doesn't register. 
---
Some builds got massacred mostly the people stacking their cards right. Haha why does me doing less damage somehow make the game better for yall? Not talking about the one update and daily ops which seems fire.
---
Blue ridge caravan backpack plan for monkey backpack plan? J25+1PER assault rifle for something? I got some Gatling lasers with stuff on them as well.
---
Also, a little disappointed but if I read correctly, the legendary perk "nuclear proliferation" got cut(generates lightweight mini-nukes overtime).
---
Trick is to select them in vats, exit vats, select again. Yes it sucks. Never happens on the 2nd or 3rd target with gun fu I recommend it
---
Don't let the vault door hit your ass on the way out.
---
I'm lvl 30 and my camp is right behind it. fertile soil kicked in when i started after update. broke both my main weapons and three pieces of armor already.
---
You can ask for anything you want, at least until everyone else with a pile of miner pails opens theirs and floods the market.
---
Imagine your dream gun. Look down, it's in your hand. Look up, you're wearing that ultra rare hat you always wanted. Look down agian, you're riding a deathclaw!
---
But he. keeps. buying.  It’s the irony really.  It’s like hating the smell of smoke but continuing to buy cigarettes because you’re addicted.  Just stop.  As a consumer your strongest ability to force change is to stop consuming.  So while people complain they don’t like how things are and they continue to throw money at it, things won’t change.  The incorrect thought process is that it will change because you can’t control your purchases to fit your dissatisfaction and somehow this will result in a better future product.  If you want a good example of this...years back coca~cola changed their recipe and people didn’t like it as much.  So much so that coke brought back their old recipe and even advertised it as being the original flavor and people started to purchase it again.  Really the consumer dollar speaks and when you buy things you don’t like you create incentive for the product to continue to be what you don’t like.
---
:D :D yup
---
You don't have to be a melee build. You can run up and bash them with your weapon and they will die when they have turned red and have like a tiny silver of health left.
---
Think that Super Duper only work with the "base" (Ammosmith) quantity, but still a great legendary perk imo!
---
I’ve had the fixer plan for almost 6 months, I’ve only had one drop in all that time... it was a hunters....
---
I saw the guy at foundation had lunchboxes and the chicken coop.
---
I have a quad/33/15 reload sitting in the old stash!! Nice!!
---
You did good Bethesda :)
---
Thats interesting. Thanks
---
There was a damage nerf, didn't you get the memo?
---
They screwed up the shotguns. I used to one shot kill practically everything with a shotgun but now it’s practically useless (had minimal effect on the Assaultron in Daily Ops).
---
They think they’re opinion is way to important to worry about which sub they’re bitching on.
---
thanks! I think I missed my chance to hit escape somehow. No way to find the report it if that happens. Seriously challenging to solos this with bloodied weapons. And sneak does not work at all with the robots in the Borrows..... not a very relaxing evenings gaming.
---
I never stocked up on 5.56 but I think that one has just over 1000 rounds. I find AT hard to watch/listen b/c of his accent and his English is off.  
---
I do have the Ammo maker for that one so I can change it and deal with being a Rifle guy longer. The hit didn't have to be so hard.  
---
I mainly go for the head in most enemies and limbs overall but when level 50 Molerats and those mutant muts are so much harder b/c of it.
---
dude, I bet your mom used to dress you funny. I'm right aren't I?
---
Go back and read and re-read until you understand. I guess Karma means something to someone that's been around over a year, and has soooo little. LOL.
---
I have no idea if you are right, but I’m having a hard time believing that a professional athlete can’t bench 155lbs. Especially one that weighed around 185lbs, which was my quick google result for gretzky’s weight.
---
I wanted to know whether or not I had missed something, or something had changed.
---
The roadmap is the only information I seen.
---
Yeah I had the ultracite plans dropped from the Queen and crafted that,  never got to craft it since now 'cause it doesn't really suit my playstyle. 
---
Honestly I tried the op solo with Power armor and I genuinely think I wasted mats crafting It. Losing serendipity is a huge deal and stuff like dodgy is less effective without the agility from uny. I think I'll just slap a troubleshooter/assasin/mutant piece on my set depending on the OP and call it a day
---
Thanks for your help and advice and not being sarcastic.
---
Nice! My 2nd solo attempt was 7:42. I used a Vampire's Bashing minigun and X-01 PA with the Dynamo torso mod. I could improve my pathing.
---
8K Caps?
---
Thanks for your advice.
---
How’s that
---
I'm guessing you are using mods. One of them is conflicting with the new pop up elements. I didn't have any problems in PTS (where you can't use mods), but in live now where i have mods i have the same issue as you. Tried getting rid of few of them to find the culprit but didn't find it. Have to wait for updates for them mods. And btw, if you just leave by fast travel you still get the rewards, you just miss the info page.
---
If by “no one” you mean me then you would be correct
---
&gt;The next year (1981–82), at 170 pounds—still "a wisp compared to the average NHL player"—he set the all-time goal-scoring record, putting 92 pucks in the net.[151] He weighed "about 170 pounds" for the better part of his career.[152] He consistently scored last in strength tests among the Edmonton Oilers, bench pressing only 140 pounds (64 kg).
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky
---
supposedly some players wouldn't hit him so hard because they all liked him so much
---
The only thing it blows is disappointment right into your face.
---
Sure thing.
---
It will damage other enemies, but I'll tell you straight up, it's not worth it.  It doesn't do enough damage or proc enough.
---
It still comes as a shock! And what the f is the story with the "resilient" robots? Basically bullet proof? what if you don't have a melee weapon to hand???? Awful event.
---
I’ve learned the ones that aren’t duplicated in the photo above. But I posted the available ones on that other (trading) sub and they went fast. Good news is everyone will be able to get these pretty easily, drop rates are great.
---
My first run was 8:30 as a bloodied melee using troubleshooter armor
---
You're, going to wanna write that as CSS and not CSA....
---
I'm curious why that changed.  Maybe they will put some level caps back at some point.  I'm sure more revisions will occur. I will pop in now and then to see.  I'm just bummed that the world feels less fun for me with massive "to the player damage scale".  
---
Who knows, maybe there will be a silver lining here I will discover or will come out later. I will certainly be playing occasionally.  My wife will be happy that multiple hour daily play isn't fun for me at this moment.
---
&gt; mplaining
---
For the LOVE OF GOD don't give Bethesda any ideas!
---
Isn't it that way with every update though, tbh?
---
It's not as extreme as that, from what I gathered they were simply stating an issue they had with a part of it not that the entire thing was an issue.
---
I wish I could make my BoS collectron speak chinese
---
Stupid question. When you say "few caps" you mean around the 5k caps price right?
---
Are you on PS4? Someone left on my team and we were fighting the robots. Only after a while I realised you had to finish them off with melee. That was a struggle :)
---
Not all of them are able to be purchased.
---
My Deathclawdmg went from 3137 to 319 and thats straight 90% of my dmg. Im done with the game now. Why i pay for private server when i cant do s#it solo now.
---
Nooooooo. :(
---
Omg I think I'm gonna cry now.
---
Thanks for the memo now.
---
I'd take a shot every time a post like that pops up but I'll end up with alcohol poisoning super quick.
---
Lmao thats the definition of one. It has junkies (magic effect) and ffr to speed the effect up (and on a gauss mini nonetheles). You think you're cool because you use a glitched gun lmfao 🤣.
---
This is why foodies shouldn't have a say in what happens to the game.
---
PA + Heavy Weapons (Vampire's Minigun) resulted in a 7:42 solo run on my 2nd attempt. I got the Vault 94 suit plan.
---
i mean... kinda? you need an absolute shitton of cards to rank up one of these. even with spamming alts to 50 it'd take a while.
---
Honestly just don't use them, they just don't do enough damage.
---
Just a PSA if you use power armor, the new legendary perk card Electric Absorption gives enemy energy weapons a 10% chance to recharge your fusion core and heal you at level 1. 20% at level 4. Its worth it at level 1. 
---
I solod the daily op today with not much difficulty by prioritizing gutsys and letting the protectrons and robot rains heal me while I did it.
---
Not to mention the bosses laser at the end.
---
If you run PA this card is a life saver and bethesda already confirmed its meant to heal you.
---
I never built the bugged traps but honestly miss the trap camps. They should have just massively increased the trap damage.
---
major slowdown like I've never seen during the first operation event I've tried. That's on a €2700 PC.
---
From what I read, DPS is the new meta, right?
---
I learned something today. Ty.
---
I second this, it has decent lore, great graphics and few bugs. Unlike, you know...this game.
---
Gun bash. They take damage untill they have 1hp left.
---
It actually only works with the true base, not the increased from either Ammosmith or the Legendary perk. So for .50 cal, for example, when it procs it’s just +100. But that’s a 30% chance so it always helps. 
---
I equip SD3 for all crafting, even for stuff I know it won’t affect (just in case and as a matter of habit).
---
I didn't notice the team names. There was a coolman I think.
---
Maybe intimidating at first but after a while they'll become as easy as the queen did I'm sure. It was definitely a kick in the nuts to see they could only be taken out by melee though, bit wierd of a trait to be given but oh well everything else seems pretty awesome with this update so far.
---
Don't know if all can be traded, but Liquid Courage Recipe can be traded 100%, same as both BoS outfits.
---
I’ll sign your petition for the the WV Dept of Transportation to paint an OSHA approved Safety Yellow line leading to each uplink.  A flashing LED bike lane may be beyond budgetary restrictions, but even in this post nuclear recession I think we can swing yellow lines.
---
Me too...me too lol that thing killed me like 5 times, and getting in close to finish it off (since it was resilient) was a bit of a challenge. I went into daily ops at about 15% health....awful idea.
---
Sorry if it was me
---
I’d hardly say that performance has tanked they broke the fixer naming and rad x in nuclear winter is broken
---
Can't lie and say my heart didn't skip a beat when I didn't see my JE The Fixer 😂
---
And how do you get more perk points?
---
It's not that bad.  Only like, lvl 500 if you do these 2 seasons.
---
I’m glad we can fast travel to crater and foundation for free but the damage stack is horrible.  Hours upon hours, weeks on weeks of playing to finally get a decent legendary weapon that now is barely better than the non legendary version.  Ridiculous and extremely frustrating.
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda and cross your fingers.
---
The only time I get anything good from mumbles is during the sales, I dropped about 1200 scrip and walked away with a few good items for trading(nothing for my build). I think the best was a J/E/-25 vats railway rifle and a AA/E/FR 10mm submachine gun.
---
Alt f4'd in 2 min and almost uninstalled. It's rare for something in a video game to annoy me this much, but congrats you've done it Bethesda.
---
Can you swap out legendary perks on the fly like regular perks?
---
You can’t, sorry! The whole type your character’s name in failsafe is Bethesda’s “sorry we can’t restore an account or items” trick. U can try to submit a ticket but don’t have ya hopes up
---
I was wondering about this.  Game is still updating for me.  This is both hilarious and disheartening.  Reading is hard.
---
We already have that tho
---
Most activities in this game couldn't keep anyone's interest because they were too cost heavy now that's everywhere.
---
Less player diversity is probably going to kill it for me personally because I enjoyed meeting/helping new people or seeing these holiday type events come alive with so many people work together.
---
Everything they have been doing with these updates seems to be geared toward weeding out more and more players so they can abandon the game soon as next gen hits. 
---
This truly sucks because we are probably years from fallout 5 and as far as I know there's nothing else interesting on the horizon from bethesda. Not that they will update their engine for whatever comes next anyway but still...
---
Fuck that, as a person you have the right to say whatever you want period.  I’m just saying you sound stupid that you have no self control over your purchases as you complain about the constant abuse you are getting as a consumer.  When will you take your purchasing power and move on?  Every single time you buy something you don’t like to get something you want you enforce the habit of being fed shit to get your prize.
---
I guess you live by one of my favorite sayings...if you gotta eat a shit sandwich take big bites.
---
You can contact Bethesda support. But I don't think they restore deleted accounts. However, even though I said that, there's nothing wrong with asking.
---
Also, right now I can't even get in the game, after the loadscreen ends the game just straight up close it self
---
Well that’s a damn shame.  I could have sworn they were considered melee weapons
---
We would all prefer you keep your junk to yourself.
---
Stealth builds are pretty much dead now. And for that matter shotgun builds too. Better start farming up that lead, cuz AR/Heavy is the only thing left actually dealing any damage.
---
For the love of god, who adds a leveling scaling system and doesn't give people the option to NOT use it. I don't NEED the scorched's sh\*\*\*y a\*\* pipe guns at level 50 thank you very much. I don't need their XP either. I just want my stealth sniper back.
---
Not all rewards are available. I know the chicken coop and the ammo converter along with Lunchboxes and such were.
---
Oh no, how will I cope with one fewer triggered wingnuts playing
---
My build is just using my trusty 2 year old Junkies Explosive Gatling Plasma. I don't need a build for it, it kills anything in seconds.
---
So, you haven’t tested it with Demolitions Expert?
---
It's certainly not the relaxing "I've got this, I'm a superhero of the wasteland" evening's entertainment it was last week. I died so many times!!! Resilient robots are proper assholes.
---
That's fair. Also it's pretty difficult for non melee/power armor builds.
---
Ya nerd rage perked
---
Can you share your build?
---
I had a pretty decent time, me and 2 strangers did it pretty easy. No melee build needed, just weapon bashes
---
You're also comparing a none explosive weapon against an explosive one, with perks for explosive weapons equipped I'm guessing. This shows in those numbers. You have to compare an exact duplicate weapon with different main effect. So a BE vs TSE handmade both 2* both same perks.
---
already in the game
---
I just died because of the rads. Yeah it's not working at all. I think your post flair should be "bug" instead of "xbox help"
---
Yeah there’s a new legendary perk “Pacifist Pulverizer” that allows you to initiate PVP with any player regardless of their status or level if you have a strength of 10 or higher
---
Glad you're enjoying them, because I haven't finished it once and rage quit like twice.
---
Resilient is stupid and I hate it
---
It's pretty ok with the follow through legendary perk. I got rank 3 on it, two 2 ranked rifleman card one 3 rank rifleman, and full rank of tank killer. Using a bloodied handmade.
---
I am getting trashed like nothing before, please tell me there are other daily ops or is this it ? I assume these change daily, but for today it's the burrows ?
---
Haven't tried them since the patch but I have a b2525 and a be90 radium and they were perfectly viable weapons before the patch
---
I didn't say I didn't test it.  I said in my opinion it isn't worth it.
---
I'm confused about unopened perk packs, how do we cash those in? I've seen comments on here about saving them up and not opening because duplicate cards in the pack could just disappear. I don't see an option for scrapping the whole pack to ensure we get credit for all 4 cards.
---
Lol thank you for your feedback
---
Sorry for bothering you then.
---
Those comments were hidden, didnt see them until I already posted.
---
Que sera....
---
At this point, that's sounding great
---
what level are you?
---
np, I didn't know he bulked up to 185. I imagine he probably was doing 155 on the bench at that time.
---
athlete stats can get a bit "funny" though, lol
---
I have about 10k caps yes.
---
So sorry. I panicked..
---
I mean like the plans, disease cure machine, and new melee weapon. But yeah I'd do 10 stimpacks per run.
---
Welp, this was a bad thread to click. BYEEEEEE
---
Oh someone probably had a bunch of ammo factory exploit going on. Tsk tsk.
---
My AA didn't change one bit but enemies are a little stronger.
---
My unarmed took a hit but poison seems to be stronger sonehow and some enemies are really weak to it.
---
120.
---
They change daily, location and enemy type. The enemy effects could use some balancing tho
---
When you complete it, don't view the report right away. First go loot the bodies, then view the report.
---
I understand how the system works. I guess what I am saying is the best way to get Max Coin out of unwanted cards. I know Angry Turtle told us ages ago to save our Perk Paks because there is a way to get Max Coin out of them. Just wondered what way is the best way to get max coin? I know you get different amounts for different cards and how the perk is upgraded.
---
I did the math and I personally still come out super ammo positive.
---
Yup TSE and AAE with demo expert are meta now
---
Only the utility items can be bought with bullion, none of the skins.
---
Could throw on dodgy too. Paired with vampires you'd be invincible
---
Yup, I agree with it now that I have more info lol.
---
Thanks - FO4 was already bad enough when it came to building, it's absurd that we needed to abuse exploits in order to plug a leaking roof in our settlements. Sounds like 76 is worse in terms of freedom so I think I'll skip it.
---
It's such a shame; if Bethesda had made a building system that actually cooperated with the environment around it, the settlement could have been spectacular. Instead we're stuck with a grid that doesn't match up with the buildings and unfixable walls and ceilings.
---
Hopefully Fallout 5 will fix it - someday...
---
So because I used the respec feature multiple times I get penalised for this. Seems fair.
---
Good guess. Gotcha thanks
---
Beth will lose players bc of this.
---
I'm loving it personally as a more casual player with a shitty jack of all trades build.
---
Pretty sure everyone complaining was running bloodied or one of those OP broken builds and they're just upset they're not one shotting bosses anymore.
---
yay now my melee build doesn't need to rely on a shitty hunting rifle every time a nuke drops.
---
It is meant to be difficult, but it’s really incredibly hard if your trying to solo it. I would recommend squading up before take it on
---
I join public teams just for all the extra fast travel spots it gives me.. now I have two reasons!!
---
Having to be at 20% health at all times to get max benefit out of it is a pretty big downside to an unyielding build and also you can't use it in a nuke zone.  I used a stealth build and when it worked it was great but even with that I died a ton of times cause stealth is super glitchy (or maybe I just don't get how it works right) cause I have had a super mutant literally walk in front of me and not get detected and then I have had times where they would see my crouched from a long distance away.
---
 While I can understand the statement of wanting to max out your experience gain without being forced into a certain build; that is how a lot of games are set up. Waste land 3 has the same thing but with charisma.  It is up to each person to decide how they want to play the game and to try and force others to change their build because you don't like how something works is crazy.
---
 I am sure there many other builds out there that destroy everything and don't have to worry about dying near as much. As long as people are not exploiting the system then be happy for them. I see people soaking up damage and beating on stuff and while I am a bit jealous of it; I am happy for them.
---
 Outside of hacking a pc game your always going to have to give up something in return for something else you are almost never going to be able to have a build with everything.  Sorry about the long rant and I hope everyone has a great day.
---
TLDR: There is going to be positives and negatives about every build if someone isn't exploiting then let them be.
---
This was terrible.  You can’t nerf stealth 100%, make mele only, and mob Gutsy’s.  It wasn’t even remotely fun on my own.  I counted that I died 14 times before even repairing the signal.  One time I respawn was four times in a group of four Gutsy’s.  Dead the second I came back.  There needs to be a fix
---
My AA5015 hunting and combat rifles are dropping level 75 super mutants with double taps and 3-4 chest shots max respectively. Dunno why everyone else is suffering so much
---
I don't use a cookie cutter build I make my own. Doesn't matter tho I am comparing the same exact weapon with different main effects TSE vs. BE. If you aren't comparing similar weapons with similar rolls of course the numbers will be off.
---
if thats the case I just wasted like 300 levels...
---
Holler when you do it, I'll just lob bug bombs to get a few tags in.
---
Electric absorption is great, fire and poison resistance, ammo factory, and specials.
---
It was a old meta vs new meta type of post.  It sucked when tse got nerfed and so we went bloodied.
---
Good joke
---
But, maybe next time only participate if you have actual info regarding to the situation. I don't have pacifist on and I don't shy away from pvp. But I get confused when I get killed three times when i never seeked revenge, or hit the aggressor
---
Report it to Bethesda
---
I saw a level 300 dumping 5mm from his TSE Minigun the whole Op. He didn't try to melee once.
---
Not necessarily. Just get yourself the Commando cards and an automatic rifle for the Daily Ops.
---
As someone who's deleted and restarted my character several times, how do you do that on accident?! you have to type in that characters specific name as a confirmation check....
---
Daily ops is a joke too!
---
Why? I dont even know the glitch i always just did it cus it's a fun event and gives 3 notes
---
Honestly not noticable in game.
---
Ik right, stacked with power user and you almost never run out of ammo
---
Ouch, can't even comprehend how that's happened. Best luck getting it rectified, I suggest finding the transaction history in your bank account before hitting up Bethesda that way you have proof ready before they can try saying you've never bought it.
---
They changed it. You get 2 perk coins per perk card now no matter what they are. So start scrapping them.
---
I don't think that's what hes seeing they balanced the game and went to far one way. Like why should most if the players be nerfed why not make the other prefixes worth their salt. Instead of just dumping in bloodied people. Went from 1900 no food damage to just 300. That's fucking massive.
---
We got there in the end. I've switched to my melee character
---
That event made me quit playing all I wanted was a backpack
---
Wait really? If so then he’ll yeah cause I had no idea
---
edit: I just checked, there isn’t a blue BOS paint job for the helmet
---
There’s no legendary perk that does this, the only way I can think of this happening is by you possibly hitting him accidentally with some bullets and him hitting you while you guys may have been moving around trying to shoot at the scorchbeast. Do you have pacifist mode on in main menu? Otherwise it’s possible that’s how pvp got initiated, all more likely if he was intentionally targeting you
---
Yeah PA is the way to go. Have you solo’d and got the best rank?  I’ve only squeezed under 12 min solo so far
---
I'm missing alot of them too for the same reason, plus the way perk card packs deleted duplicates. But that is a completely different issue that we tried to address multiple times during PTS testing. And only thing we got them to do is to award us that stupid 50 coins as a compensation.
---
Im playing Daily Ops solo right now and I hate it. I want to try to find a group to see if it's any better
---
What do you mean by stacking the cards right?
---
Not a damage/build expert, but still experimenting on different enemies. I may store everything and run around with multiple 50 Cals and a ski sword. Wasted too much ammo with the rifles, switched over to Vamp .50 and crippled a dozen Super Mutants and then finished each one off with a Ski Sword execution style. As mainly a non-violent person IRL...i found this extremely...satisfying ...
---
So, what you're saying is, we're playing the game wrong. I see. I clearly missed that in the tutorial 2 years ago.
---
I didn't know how I would feel about the One Wasteland of creatures scaling to your level.
---
But after playing for 5 hours, I have to say, I liked it. I liked that creatures were harder to kill no matter where I went. Yeah, I might miss my favorite game of, Morgantown Ghoul hunt. (You have to shoot the ghouls before they touch you.). 
---
And yes, I burned through resources faster. But I was also ok with that. There were times when I would leave my camp with 50 stimpaks, and come back with over 80. Same with grenades and such. 
---
So yeah, I'm fine with it. I like using tactics in these games over one shot killing. I did one daily OP, and while we took a long time to finish it, we had a blast.
---
I uninstalled this game a month or two ago,  should I re download it? Or is it still shit
---
aye. those things are brutal. 
---
BUT there is an easy fix for this. Troubleshooters armor. even just a couple of pieces will make a big difference.
---
I have two characters that have similar names and one of them is just an alt for storage recently I sold tons of stuff and cleared out said character and I deleted the one with all the stuff
---
I'm fine with it being difficult, I've wanted more challenges in the game, but that affect makes it impossible for me to solo. and I don't really have anyone who plays this game in public teams never work for me. So I'll just wait for tomorrow
---
Yes, all three work together.  The formula is: (BASE x .7 x 1.8 x 2.5) + (BASE x .3 x 2)
---
I was really hoping I could hang things on the Brotherhood banners post to make up for the missing banner part, alas I couldn't get anything to hang off of it...
---
Ah I think I understand so you sontvoaw your stuff or caps but he become wanted for killing you so nothing to worrie about
---
Red tick, above your head.
---
You asked if there was a legendary perk that allowed this!
---
Players on the PTS brought this up on the first day, and continued loudly and repeatedly until p22 went live.
---
In response, BGS buffed the alien blaster by 30% and fixed a bug regarding unarmed damage.
---
Good luck.
---
You need closer to 1000 Rad Res would be my guess. Notice that to survive in a nuke zone without PA(with less than 1000rad res) a player has to be in a hazmat suit or the Chinese stealth suit, both 1000 rads. PA is special as in it's a self contained tank so you can't really compare rad res for surviving high rad places to regular armor.
---
yeah, its much quicker than switching from ranged to melee do to 1 hit and then switch back to ranged
---
Where did I say I hate it?
---
Bandolier is my friend now 😭
---
Bruh! Diving that shit so hard. How far up the run is it?
---
Seriously. Also don’t work in Chinese stealth suit.
---
Disable all your mods. Only one i have on is IconSortingTags, that doesnt seen to break anything
---
That’s because they were grinding the repeatable during double score and XP weekends  and Bethesda added way more challenges near the end. This time they will START with having more challenges. It IS easier. The thing I worry about is whether they fixed autocomplete bug.
---
Apparently you only get 1 shot at rare plans per day.
---
A) power armor degrades super slowly, B) start running queen and getting repair kits.
---
This is why I gave my legendary fixer that I tote around religiously a name, “Dante”
---
I don't know what you mean by a meta build but I have a variety of different weapons tactics and layouts all of which are to some extent still viable, again not my complaint.  It's simply the immersion breaking issue of enemies being ridiculously scaled not the difficulty in killing said enemies.  Maybe the majority of users won't care I just know that the group of people I play with tend to enjoy the role-playing aspect and are confused by this change.  I don't know if anyone who is currently unable to continue playing the game from a difficulty standpoint.
---
I had a stealth build, but my rifles do less damage now, both were doing 120 damage. Now one does 116 and another does 99. Its a bit annoying as i was enjoying my build till they changed it. Also a group of level 40 morerats......
---
That's a really good point too!
---
I did an earl, wendigo's took two shots instead of one with a bash damage shotgun.
---
Uh, what a waste.
---
Oh ya totally, I get that.  The thing is that they are admitting to buying a bunch of junk to get one item.  So if you go to the grocery store one day and your favorite flavor of Pringle only comes in a box with a bunch of other flavors that you won’t eat are you going to start buying the box that costs way more than what you paid for a single can?  I mean you might if you could figure out a quick and easy way to make your money back on the flavors you didn’t like.  Or maybe you got plenty of money cause you use dollar bills to start you fireplace so you probably really don’t give a fuck about the extra crap.  But then you got the complainer who makes up the vast majority of people who agree with the sentiments, and y’all just keep buying?
---
I read that in Lil Dicky’s voice for some reason.
---
I was really hoping there was going to be even more honestly, I’m excited for this patch but I was hoping the bug fixes was going to be on wastelanders lvl. I love this game but I just want it to run a bit smoother.
---
Wow so if you don't get them your first go you just don't get them that day?
---
Agree, why even give alts the slots if you can't share the progress? I'd just be wasting time if I don't play on my main.
---
Unfortunately, the masks got bugged out or something so they’re part of a super rare cosmetic drop package that only seems to happen with the Savage Divide events.
---
I was blowing through mags too with a FFR handmade.  Then I stopped holding down  the trigger and started firing single shots.  Went from wasting 10-15 rounds per enemy to like 2-5 suddenly.  Guess I should switch to rifleman because more bullets faster is apparently not good for killing things.  Makes sense.
---
We can get more coins if they are upgraded to the max. Do we max them out first? And what about the Special Perk Cards? Are the Special Perks the ones that move worth more? And do I Max them out?
---
Like I said earlier on, I just clicked on the Daily Ops and I was teleported straight into the event. 
---
A couple of you guys replied to me in a helpful manner, others were sarcastic. 
---
I’ve decided to call it a day with this game and I’ve deleted my level 462 character.
---
This is super useful. Thank you very much.
---
Kinda want the shoot the commie game thing to give Perception
---
The same thing happened to Minecraft.
---
Odd little bugs, that had no real impact on game play, were patched out. But the player base had taken advantage of those bugs to do a lot of fun stuff. The water elevator trick was great, but they patched that out.
---
Or require 3 power attack hits in a PA with Junkies grognak axe with 40% Power attack dmg, psychotats and 5 stacks of adrenaline to kill a wendigo...
---
I even had the perception perk that makes you deal 60% more dmg to glowing enemies
---
Hello, thats why I use Advanced version, until today (after patch 22, one wasteland), it has now the same issue as the standard ranger armor.
---
Yeah, this update was definitely a great big FU to solo players.
---
Laughs in putting your camp on a junk pile and extracting free junk.
---
That’s really weird then, it’s possible the explosive legendary effect can trigger it and since you have pacifict off it’s possible he could have been damaging you thru that while shooting sbq if you were close by to her for melee, he would have ended up wanted since you didn’t fight back tho so this is a pretty strange situation
---
Not gonna lie, I had a blast, but goddamn wasent it difficult. My first 2 tries, I used my TSE25 .50 cal and bashed, but ended in 8:34 and 8:45 respectively (F). The 3rd time, I got pissed, slapped on my Troubleshooters SS armor and swaped to a melee build with my BSS Sheep Staff. Finished at 6:34. Definitely loved it all, but I think this was the forbidden combo for sure.
---
I get your point and I outright refuse to buy a pack that has an item I already own but at the end of the day it's pointless waiting for them to release the items separately.
---
I found this out the hard way. Dove in solo without checking my stim stores and I was fresh out within like 3 minutes lol. Was pleasently relieved when I saw that re-spawning didn't have them getting all their health back.
---
You can paint urban to look like forest and vice versa, but it doesn't change the name.
---
If you can fee aim a automatic railway, you must have some godly pvp skills.
---
Shut
---
Haz suit, power armor and stealth suit have a hidden 90% rad reduction on top of their rad resist. You can not acheive that level of protection without them. 
---
To be blunt, other than the rad recovery rate being handy, you kinda wasted 300 points
---
It is how you identify the fixers... now you need to rename them. I have some good ideas how to name them now.
---
You seriously the the /s at the end of that, because I shit you not, thrice this week alone I've gone newbie recruiting, only for them to blitz the dialogue and not understand what they're doing. Best one was the guy that sprinted through Lou's mine and then had the nerve to ask; "yo, what's with all the turrets"
---
I think that's apart of the mode. If you read the daily ops pop up then you'll see that one of the enemie's mutations is enhanced perception.
---
While i dont care much for this season (burnt out because last season and the fact i wasn't home every day of the week due to work) i think even i will be able to complete it without trying much. They have added more daily and weekly score challenges.
---
South of Braxsen’s medical supply.
---
There is also apparently some inherent rad resistance buff from power armor and hazmat/Chinese stealth suits.  I.e. a flat -%50 rad elimination before the actual rad resistance is applied.  So even in SS armor with 1000 rad resistance you will not get the same effect as a hazmat suit or power armor - ** I did not do this testing myself, that is just what I heard from other who tested it ...
---
Glad you made it!!!!
---
Berserkers forever!!!! I don't know how my damage is now.  But I still look BATSHIT CRAZY
---
well your choice. Seems like a bit of an extreme reaction to strangers on the internet.
---
Am i surprised? Nope.
---
You definitely still have to carry roadway.  WR isn't that fast.  It's actually pretty slow.
---
I don't know if that damage calculator calculates armor penetration correctly for multiple projectile weapons, like 2 shot. It definitely seemed off for shotguns. I'm working on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-SWx4pmSjWkmE_Gwv07WiioIvNCMNbJMJtKFxc-IWF0/edit?usp=sharing) to augment the calculator with that plus headshot damage and sustained, multiple-clip dps. If anyone knows definitively how any of that stuff works I'd appreciate the info.
---
And if you've been, ahem, relying on the trail fireworks reload "feature" oh my are you gonna notice how slow reloading truly is. I gave the ops a run, without changing my load out and got destroyed. You can get around that by dumping your stealth cards for defensive ones. My main problem with this op was getting lost in the burrows
---
vampire
---
Pleeeeeeeaase this! I even have the perk where you can repair it above 100% and it still feels like they break way to often
---
Yeah I didn't think you'd answer that, it's a bit embarrassing huh? 
---
Just for the record, if all you can do is throw out childish insults, make paranoid accusations and weird assumptions instead of presenting a rational argument, you're not covering yourself in glory, you know what i mean?
---
Look I realise it's hard to back down when you've already made such a twat of yourself so let's just leave it shall we? I'll go back to talking with the grown ups and enjoying the game (and it's lovely, juicy exploits) and can pretend you've won something here and find some other poor soul to froth at. You can even have the last word, how's that? I'm sure it will be as profound and erudite as your previous comments.
---
It's just weird. The bugs that severely impact camp building in a negative way never seem to be fixed or when they are its after months and eventually they pop up again. 
---
The good bugs, ofcourse they get removed
---
Read the info about the daily ops, and the mutations. Or even better, do a search about the subject on this sub to find dozen or so posts about it.
---
I'm on pc, and no I havent contacted bethesda yet
---
would it, though? you need 150 cards per legendary card to max it out. with 26 legendary cards total that's 3,900 cards. leveling to 50 you get, what, like 2 cards per level? (seriously what's the number? i don't know offhand) with that assumption you have to level 39 alts to 50 which, really, is a lot of fucking effort. unless you can hit 50 in like an hour (is that a thing? i'm gonna cry if that's a thing. i spent so long leveling my second dude x-x) it would take an obscene amount of time to get them all maxed out.
---
even then, it would be pretty simple to bypass this problem by limiting the amount of characters you can have total and how many you can delete each week. (though idk if we already have a character cap, if not this becomes a whole lot more fucky as an option)
---
That's what I ended up doing. Blast n' bash.
---
Meh, take it or leave it.  Just remember, this isn’t a sandwich you HAVE to eat.
---
Far flung fireworks and follow through. Maybe legendary perception and agility. Sneak bloodied commando is one of the most viable options right now.
---
I wish I had kept the presence of mind to record a game clip of it happening. I was just caught by surprise because I had just come off a loading screen and was completely not expecting something like that. 
---
Griefers and trolls that do things like this are truly pathetic individuals.
---
I dunno. I’m level 170 something and I’m scared. I haven’t had a chance to play yet. I’m stealth and don’t want the game ruined for me if it’s too hard. I’ve never had to farm ammo as I can take out most enemies in a few shots. That’s the fun of a stealth sniper build.
---
You need to melee or bash them for last hit.
---
How about people like me that had some mouth breather invite me to their private team and then place a factory? But no, let’s think with the hivemind.
---
Read the daily ops report. U have to melee them to kill them. It’s literally all over this sub a quick search would find it
---
you can kill them only in melee or by bashing them
---
Dude, I have it downloaded, prepped by God's is a single click from opening, but the wife wants ice cream. No she not pregnant.
---
So excited for EA and invincibility from robots.
---
They nerfed all forms of damage including perk cards while also raising the danger from enemies. All builds were affected, however they didn't want a large gap between subpar builds and a full unyielding bloodied.
---
You want players to consider more itemization and them be useful then that comes naturally from balance.
---
Basically one step back two steps forward. They still want your feedback on what needs boosted.
---
I would recommend balancing damage based on fire rate and put soft caps on them where you get diminishing returns when it starts to get too be too much for weapons like chainsaw. Pistols and scoped weapons need a buff.
---
Nice idea!
---
Read the instructions, their mutation today is have to be killed by melee
---
For example: When you scrap a rank 1 Perk Card, you’ll receive 2 Perk Coins, and scrapping a rank 3 Perk Card will award 6 Perk Coins.
---
Edit: I thought animated played into it too, but they changed it to a flat 2 perk coins, which is nice.
---
New flash buddy, people can have a difference of opinion. Great that YOU like the update but some of don’t and we are freely allowed to discuss our opinions. It’s not being a “drama queen” when most of have to readjust our builds and routes. If I wanted high level creatures I would go to places like Watoga and the bogs. When I want to be able to one-shot or quickly clear out areas of low levels for extra XP I should be able to. This update only caters to those who like dramatic scaling, not the casual players. Bethesda could have easily made this a toggle option or a game mode but chose to fuck over the causal players.
---
The aim is to make U stay longer in the game
---
I just did an earl where someone else's nade killed me, I couldn't see any of the names of the other players, not even that little arrow icon. They were not sneaking.
---
They may have broke events automatically setting players to ally, so they can't damage each other.
---
I ain't holding my breath, personally--I'm playin 76 for basically free rn and I'm thinkin I paid too much for it--but I hear you, and I agree.
---
I have a lot of saved level ups from the first season so I was maxing Adrenaline an scraping it for 10 points a max card.  idk if that’s the most efficient thing to do but think that’s the max you can get for a card
---
They probably stealthily increased the budget cost of something!
---
It’s not hard, just slightly press the trigger it becomes a semi auto.
---
Yeap that's how my team did it. The heavy gunners getting the robots at 1h and i was running around with melee to kill em. When the upling ends , you don't lose time killing the remaining robots, you run straight to the next location, until you have to kill the boss. 3 times we did it, first as a walkthrough and to see how it works (initiate tier), second one we lost time killing robots when we should be running to the next location (paladin tier), third one we got the third tier with 7 min time. It is fun. I like it.
---
I hid behind a corner and came out to unload a vampires gatling laser at it then went behind the corner to reload rinse and repeat then died trying to melee it
---
Bloodied used to be better then TSE, thats what this is about.  BE vs TSE would be new duped vs old duped lol. 
---
I don’t have a BE to test, so thanks.  I wondered if BE could surpass TSE.  My B2525 fixer was at 130 and still shreds with that dps.
---
Dunno it was so easy for us to just tank through the Ops and still complete it in 8 min.. we played:
---
I: Power armor heavy build, Team Medic perk
---
GF: Bloodied build, with a lot of troubleshooters (-15% dmg from robots) equip. Basically it consists of me running to fix the first objective, then the 2nd. we camp that and kill all the robots that come close. throw a stim or some meat when needed.  (carnivore mutation makes scorched flesh heal like mad). Tank through the two defence objectives. rush to the end. kill them all. Took us 3 tries to get &gt;8 min. level 83 and 145.
---
So I don'T see the fuss. With a 3rd person joining (even tho they seem utterly clueless on what to do) it got even more easy once they managed to stand in our objective.
---
The only thing annoying to me: faster event progress the more players there are. solo is impossible to go sub 8 I'd say.
---
Other than that? yeah just read the text of the event and you are fine. They don't hit that hard
---
Also: we are now swimming in so many stimpacks I had to get the apotheker skillcard and share them...
---
My 1st solo attempt was 8:02 and my 2nd attempt was 7:42. My strategy was PA, Vampire's Minigun, don't kill anything until getting to the first booster and then only kill ones that come close enough. For the boss I recommend the most powerful heavy weapon you can get your hands on.
---
As a shotgunner (atm) my instigating does as much as my bloodied (both 285 dmg) but even if the target isn't at full health it still goes down to the Bloodied dmg, rip bloodied.
---
Oh I read it, no where does it say they know where you are at all times.  Enhanced yes, unfairly enhanced that they know where you are at all times?  FAIL
---
Vampire and Anti-Armor for anyone not bloodied
---
The day Fallout 76 died. 9.15.2020
---
It didn't seem like it did, and Tank Killer doesn't apply to pistols. NW seems pretty much unchanged.
---
Oh damn, thank you. I had no idea, I’m on PS4 but I appreciate your help.
---
Why down vote this? Its the truth!
---
I’m so lazy I don’t even go in the building I just jump up next to the building and shoot mad dog through the window
---
I was shooting for the dude in the Old Spice commercials, but I'll take what I can get :)
---
To get more perk points you gotta level up. Sort of annoying but once you get into the groove leveling isn't all that bad! 
---
Personally I am also using Mast infiltrator so that I can pick any and all locks and not use points into Lockpicking or master crafting. I am also using Funky Duds for poisons resists, Sizzling Style for fire and What Rads for rad resists. That require a matching set of armor though. Once you hit 50+ you can check out all the available legendary perks, so check them all our, there are some build/play style specific ones! :)
---
Weapon specific cards, and things like Bloody mess, Glow Sight, and Adrenaline are some must haves :)
---
For me having fun is having difficult areas that challenge me and having areas that I've progressed to a level to which I can feel like I have mastered them.  Walking along next to a level 10 who has the same amount of difficulty killing a mole rat as a level 200 just seems silly.  I've said it since the game Oblivion and I'll keep saying it, enemy difficulty scaling is a lazy way to get around good level design.
---
Legendary items are selling again and junk (acid, cloth, steel, lead and even gunpowder)
---
it will most likely take a year to fix it tho
---
Im a level 410. I just deep sixed a bunch of perk cards I dont need or use. I now how 534 perk coins. How many coins does it take for a card? Also to upgrade a card?
---
Looking through them now. Ammo Factory is by far the sexiest one, since Im guessing you can stack it with Ammosmith...? And then double those two perks with Super Duper!!! Thats ganna be super sexy.
---
Master Infiltrator sounds lovely as does Funky Duds. Im intrigued!
---
Please, the game was getting too easy as it was, they seriously needed to do something along those lines.
---
Oh look, another one. Anyone been keeping count? Lol
---
That gives me hope for the foosball table and shooting gallery.
---
Yeah I'm not arguing you can't get some good shots off, but with chems, perks, and all the rest... a sneak shot from a fixer would do about 12,500 or more for me. I just want the radium rifle so I can hear the cool "pew-pew pew-pew" ya know? lol
---
That's why this was the first legendary perk I added!.
---
It is awesome. 
---
I recently started playing Elder Scrolls Online as I was frustrated with all the building changes in 76 and was blown away with how much we are missing tool wise with building in 76. No collision system, path-finding, multiple NPC's at your home, thousands of decor options, and the list goes on and on.
---
Then I read 76 has eliminated even more ways to build. You either build the way they think you should build or move on. I hope instanced building as well gets better, but I'm skeptical. I miss the freedom I had building. Tired of having work arounds just to build a camp. Who the f*ck cares if things were colliding or floating or stacked.
---
I honestly haven’t really noticed a difference in my junkies and my junkies weapons out perform anti armor. I heard ramblings that AA is now better than junkies, I don’t believe it. That said AA is now stronger.
---
They scale to your level, finally!
---
wow
---
it's much better now
---
seriously, placing down workbenches was ticking my petty ocd like you wouldn't believe
---
Logged in and saw 11 bounties ...knew something from the update had to have a huge change
---
that doesnt make the info invalid.. I didnt tell them to watch AT.. I said he confirmed it
---
Even you are getting downvoted for saying that..
---
Yeah junkie stuff is going surprisingly quick
---
Oof im sorry, well hopefully bethesda support can help you out.
---
Yea it was one of the first things I tried. I went back later with a daily ops group just me and one other guy and we knocked it out in 10 mins an 27 seconds. I got a 2 star bloodied combat shoty and I used a troubleshooters pool cue.
---
You wasted all those atoms....Wow.
---
ESO has building? I've been trying to get into it recently and if it has some sort of building or house related stuff I'd love that
---
I changed the crop planter to the AstroTurf tiles, it looked very nice!
---
I can understand associating perk coins with scrapping perk cards. It’s so that the season perk card packs become attractive to already high ranked players. An alternative way to gain extra coins outside of level grind. Was a pain to unpack and scrap a few hundred cards today but once it’s done it’s done. 
---
My suggestion would be to enable the scrapping of legendary perks so you can get perk coins back in the case of changing a build or adjusting. Not really something that can be done on the fly but still allows people to play with builds. 
---
It was a little painful to scrap a lot of cards that I used to swap around to suit my weapons stash. Maybe I’ll get to see them again in another 100 levels or so.
---
Hey, Bethesda! Hehe, I think you missed to fix the bugged atom challenges like "killed different kinds of..." and "discover places of cranberry bog". 👉👈
---
I have killed several milelurks, SQ Queens, foglers, crickets, grafton monsters, mothman, fireflies and more and still don't get complete.
---
You mad crazy bar streward I absolutely love you , not for you the marathon - nope 200 metre dash straight to the finish line epic 🥰 (typing this whilst hiding in a bush to get daily NW challenge) what’s your gamertag would love to visit and see your new camp if your on Xbox (
---
Yeah that sounds fucking stupid I never cared for melee especially with Bloodies as I was a glass cannon that couldn't respawn.
---
As for damage nerf in numbers my heavy guns were nerfed about 5-30 damage per hit with various weapons. 
---
I think as before anything not heavy gun or commando/automatic is getting fucked. They DO NEED to do some adjustments with certain weapons that's for sure.
---
What happened to Bloodied?
---
Fook me knowing my luck it will take the best part of 6 months to get things like the symptomatic with a chance that low
---
I only tried it the one time so far and didn't do so great lol. Mainly cuz im just not that familiar with the burrows.
---
I missed the middle rank by like 10 seconds. Gonna try again, can probably do much better since I have a better idea of what I'm doing.
---
Learn to read jackass.
---
Nice!  I’m hoping that the 8min mark isn’t too hard to get as I’d like to be able to get those rewards.
---
Turrets are worthless now. Almost half my base was destroyed by 2 super mutants. Gonna need those bunkers ASAP.
---
I would subscribe for that
---
Think the chance of it dropping is 0,25%
---
I’ve noticed my ap doesn’t regen as fast
---
Madlad
---
Fascinating 🤔🤔
---
I can't solo this to save my life.  Stealth is broken and my melee damage is too low to kill the robots... And melee is required today.  Gg Bethesda.  Another wonderful update...
---
Lol. I just like having the things...and to be honest I work 2 jobs and have kids who are remote learning from home. My fallout play time is about 5 hours a week. I only got to stage 26 on season 1 and had to biy all the rest before it ended.
---
it's 50/100/150 per rank to get to rank 4!
---
Well if it were hard I'd spec for it. Ie, troubleshooters for bots, vampire weapons, etc.
---
Everything that used to fit inside won't fit as good anymore. You have a lot less space. I've built camps around it and now some things are stuck in the wall and I can't move them. Will have to move camps and spend a lot of time doing that.
---
dont forget how in this version of daily ops you cant go stealth :V 
---
i think bethesda is trying hard for it to fail
---
Yeah getting trashed as well, I feel my bloody mess does nothing. Just noticed level 50 scorch at the fairground .. bring a friend ..
---
Need to do it on a public server for it to work.
---
Edit:. I was not correct and I are a dumb dumb
---
Ok let me explain that again.
---
Technically you get 3 chances. Slowest time has like a 4% chance second time has 40% and I think best time is 60% (probably completely wrong so feel free to correct me) all 3 basicly guarantee a rare plan. Even if you dont get the best time first time.
---
Yes, it actually seems to be WORSE running x3 level 3 ranks. Running x3 level 1 ranks is only slightly less damage and frees up a lot of perk spots. Kinda a bummer for pistol builds as I relied on that additional damage since there are no pistol/armor mitigation perks available.
---
Guess we will never know as the downvotes suggest.  Good luck fellow wastelander.
---
Yeah, he was universally respected and liked, and played a very clean game.  Plus, it was damned hard to catch the guy to even try to bodycheck him, and he always had a couple of real bruisers on his side to swiftly take care of business if anyone were to ever get out of line.
---
No sir
---
How to you get pets to your camp? I’m out of the loop
---
As a stealth v.a.t.s sniper you'll never enjoy this patch
---
Yo same. I just found the burrows quest last week but didn’t feel like doing it. I didn’t even know it existed til then. 
---
My first run was VERY confusing. Started to learn the layout after the third.
---
Yes, I understand what you're saying and I agree 100%. For me, the moment I stopped struggling against Gutsies was when I felt I had finally progressed enough in the game, I wonder how uninteresting the progress in this game feels for a newcomer without this kind of stuff, really. The game was unrewarding enough already, now it's just borderline pointless
---
Good luck, let's hope Bethesda sort out the atom store
---
I AM a casual player. I'm not fucked over. The game is fine and even more fun now since it has some challenge to it.
---
I'm sorry you're upset they nerfed your brokenly OP build, well no im not.
---
ALSO, something you're aggressively ignoring, this helps new players and lower level players DRAMATICALLY. No longer do they go to the savage divide at level 25 and discover all level 70 enemies. No longer do they have to server hop to get the area they need to go to for a quest to have appropriate enemies. But screw those casual players right?
---
Your outrage is pure selfishness.
---
I am pretty sure there will be a fallout 5. There is clearly a market for single player games, but multi player games are the real money spinners.
---
If you consider how long it took for the developers of Borderlands to make a third game after miss after miss,  almost as a last resort, it's clear to see that it was released as a fallback option.
---
Like it or not Destiny was a game changer, sadly the initial premise of a game you could play with friends against other players or the game itself, has turned into a horrible chore, and a dick waving competition. But they made it that way because the fanbase demanded it. All the magic has gone. If you want the best gear, you have to grind for it. There is an element of that in FO76 but nowhere near as taxing. And there is no rush.
---
I am lucky I have one half way decent weapon much less piles of ones to speck into.
---
Yeah more people buying ammo is a good thing!
---
Many of the "innocent" tricks they've fixed are involved in dupe methods, or they had to fix them to stop a dupe. They don't really care about us glitching a display case halfway through a wall for aesthetic reasons, but they do care if that glitch allows you to dupe whatever is in the display.
---
What happened to the metal crop planters? I dont see those on the season map any more. Not part of the season? Or am I blind?
---
Right?! Most high levels, which are in the 500 and above mind you, are high levels because they don’t build a bunch. They play to level. Correlating elaborate camp builders with ammo factory blueprinting is ridiculous as it is but then assuming those particular camp builders have to be level 300+ is dense af.
---
I used to curl 185 on a straight bar for my warm up reps in high school weight lifting class. Of course I was 287lbs and 6foot 6inches tall tho... but I sucked at benching and only managed to max out at 230lbs. Was able to squat 530lbs and dead lift 850lbs. Some people just struggle with different lifts. This was my sophomore year, later I blew my knee out tore my mcl and acl and again my junior year. Then I gave up on life and stop lifting altogether...
---
Seems like they did a pretty big Nerf to the weapon damage. I haven't got to try it too much yet.
---
Did a Colossal Problem and a player almost killed me with his 50cal explosive. Was on the way out. No enemies in the area, pacifist mode on. He was as surprised as I was.
---
i have it on a couple of my characters....should be able to get a combat helmet skin to match all of the material mods for combat armor. white, red, blue, green, tan black, etc.
---
try this link... [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFJ8wzeIyA](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFJ8wzeIyA)
---
I don't think I've even recieved a rare plan, or plan in general. Just the base rewards. Finished it in everything under than 8 minutes.
---
Yea I don't really like resilient enemies, I like how it forces you to play aggressively but on PS4 I was getting a lot of lag with the melee hits to finish them off and a lot didn't seem to register a lot of hits. (be nice if the weapon bash didn't require AP in this mode too)
---
I'm not.
---
Full HP builds are catching up to bloodied slowly. Probably due to daily ops or the fact bloodied builds dont have free healing anymore
---
Steam?
---
They're doing maintenance today. When Steam is down, so is the link.
---
[https://steamstat.us/](https://steamstat.us/)
---
I don’t know about that.  I’ve rarely ever returned to the same a public server. Now if you’re on a team that does work as you rejoin a friend but I’m flying solo at the moment.
---
yaaaaaaay
---
 kinda wasted 300 points... yes that seems the case :-(
---
And with stealth being disabled in daily ops it’s just great isn’t it /s. I’ve switched to a heavy gunner and that seems to be doing a better job.
---
Unfortunately if you want to continue killing enemies quickly you now have two choices.  Commando or heavy gunner.  You could get away with slow and heavy by going bloody and min/maxing builds like rifleman, slugger and archer, but not anymore.
---
Magic shotguns are option three, but don’t expect that to last indefinitely.  I expect magic effects to be dealt with sooner rather than later, maybe even p23.
---
Edit: All of this was mentioned on the PTS on day one, and repeatedly until p22 went live.  Barring a vague acknowledgment or two, and the incredibly important 4-5 point buff to the alien blaster, weapon balance has been ignored.
---
The imposter Sheepsquatch outfit?
---
Who the hell is down voting these poor guys? Get out of here Tod! Shoo.
---
Radrats and Cave Crickets are right up there too
---
Just because you dont one shot enemies does not mean you're not viable.
---
People need to understand this concept. Metagaming in online games is so hyperbolic, if its not OP its suddenly not viable. Just sheer craziness.
---
Patch 22 can kiss my ass Bethesda you didn’t have to nerf the weapons especially the bloodied Red dead is looking really good now and call of duty just when you think you found a game that you can enjoy playing somebody comes along and fucked it up that be you BethesdaIt’s spent a lot of money and time playing your game of yours oh my friends are pissed off too and I’m sure there are a lot more out there
---
I was considering testing it today but I guess I got my answer. Sorry man, sucks ass
---
No, you could always use private servers to do this. If you log out of yours and log back in within 5 minutes or so you could get back the server you just left.
---
This method has never been 100% guaranteed to work. And definitely not intended to be used as transfering method by bethesda. There has always been a risk. It's quite common to see these types of posts here. Use a friend or secondary account if you want to be 100% safe.
---
You really wanna risk eating an egg when you have no idea what you’re *actually* biting into? I mean sure it’s a terrible reason but think about it, for all we know the radiation might’ve evolved chicken eggs to be extremely deadly.
---
True, that’s interesting and i see what you’re saying. I’m trynna think back to how role playing experiences came about, probably with a bunch of people getting together and fucking around playing pretend like kids do. But a role playing experience can come about from all kinds of different mechanics. I also love single-player role playing mechanisms and think FO1/2 and Morrowind did an excellent job creating a role playing experience by building the world and letting the player explore it. You enter a rich world that was designed from the ground up for you to change it. The role playing experience happens when you navigate that world, through the relationship between your character and the world (being everything that’s not your character). Theres a fundamental difference in how we have a fulfilling role playing experience when everything doesn’t exist for me to change, but rather changes TO me. It’s the difference between playing a D&amp;D campaign with a real group of 5 other folks and playing alone. It’s not just me vs everyone anymore, but me + some people that are quasi-me but have different opinions and playstyles vs a world that then HAS to respond to all of us dynamically in order for all of us to have fun. In this kind of world, the role playing experience doesn’t come from a computer telling you a husky ghoul is terrorizing an irradiated cabbage patch, but from players navigating the dynamic world together. So maybe I bump into some players that say the husky ghoul was a bitch to fight, and still some others who say it was 2ez, and still a 3rd who is so lost asking you plz help how to get to the cabbage patch - it’s a different kind of role playing experience but still one and still one with merits I think
---
It's OK. Patience is a virtue. 😂👍
---
Ew, that is ugly.
---
Ya having to gun bash all of the robots was super difficult, especially since most the robots were those anti armor gutsys that just murder me
---
LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Someone give this guy/girl/it/thing/banana a fucking medal for this level of *insert politically correct term that wont have the toxic cancel culture come after me*!!!!
---
BRAVO!
---
In all seriousness, it is the new patch where everything scales to you dynamically. So when you go up a level so do the mobs.
---
So you can play with a low level friend or higher level friend and it is the same challenge for you both.
---
5 is took quick???! Im sorry your 1 star mutants pipe rifle isnt hitting for what he is. Once again we perfect builds for high dps. You obviously havent figured out what him or others have. It sucks to suck.
---
The same as happened to everything else.
---
I'm not telling you to play melee, I'm stating what a basic optimised build for melee is.
---
It takes me about 4 shots to kill the now level 50 mirelurks by my base with my bloodied lever action. This same weapon used to do about 6000 damage to the head of a level 68 super mutant. Definitely more fun (not!)
---
Hey where is the free thing this time? 😤
---
Thank god, I just rolled a vampire's explosive handmade, this is great news. Thank you!
---
As expected... :)
---
Yeah everything got nerfed, except for TSE I'm still wreaking everything I point it at
---
Rule number one for private world transfers: never, ever do it on patch days. EVER.
---
I've moved stuff hundreds of times, and the only time I've ever lost my stuff was the day a big patch went live. I suspect it's because things roll out across servers and they're not all updating at the same time, so you end up losing your private world.
---
In any case, never move crap on patch day. Hopefully you didn't lose anything too valuable.
---
Your camp will be there, you just can't place down the auto blueprint when you try to move it!
---
Man I  lucked out having gone after my weakest 2 stats first, would have been majorly disappointed about that.
---
I did max out the cleave legendary perk. Is... strange. Not sure if it's the value I was hoping for tho.
---
Im not thay what i spent all this time perfecting. Now you have to waste 20 mins and 10k ammo on a queen for a useless 1 star....wheres the logic in that honestly.
---
Fyi to anyone who didnt know: this was used for a dupe glitch so it isnt just a harmless building glitch. I still want Bethesda to improve the building aspect of the game though...
---
Yep. 10 minutes of "naked and afraid"
---
Must be the explosive effect
---
Probably should report this to someone
---
I have like 12 different fixers. They are all now called “the fixer” every. Damn. One.
---
Yes. I finally decided to switch from stealth commando to heavy gunner because of this ridiculous patch.
---
"meta" would include, but not limited to, bloodied, junkie, etc. Basically any build that requires some sort of min-max balance to ensure maximum damage output. I'm here to play and that just sounds like more work to me.
---
That said, I agree with what you stated, I, too, am interested in the RP side of things. Bethesda "turned it up to 11" when all I really wanted was some more bass to round out the audio, if that analogy makes sense.
---
Read the patch notes. With the new changes and especially daily ops you have to have a build with optimized perks and decent gear. It's just like any other game now in that it gets more difficult at higher levels, which in my opinion is much better. Combat was a joke before this patch, absolutely nothing was challenging, even the endgame scorchbeast queen was a joke and could be soloed easily with the right gear. It also scales so lower level players will not run into those high level enemies, they will be down leveled to their level making the game fair to all
---
This would be an excellent selling point. Id even give new subs an advantage [10k of each ammo or some shit] to incentivise and improve the game.
---
The sound of their bullets impacting just sound like punches for some reason
---
Wish I could relate haha. No one is even running it on xbox with people lower than 100 and I'm 89. Even there few people are running it.
---
Just grab Marsupial or a jet pack and fly up to her. Climb the sky and punch god directly in the jaw, freebird, that’s my motto.
---
Hey, I was here first, get your own bush!
---
Because your probably a foodie who builds camps for fun.
---
Really? Thank you
---
So I don’t have play nuclear winter this time? Nice
---
possibly your health increased or adrenaline wore off, try testing it again. equip and unequip the weapon each time before putting cards on/taking off. sometimes the pipboy acts up. also make sure your food/effects aren't affecting the numbers.
---
 😂 I don’t even bother picking up guns or anything
---
This kinda sucks cause not everybody ran op builds like that I’m just lvl 51 and enemy’s at my level before the nerf were pretty tough I haven’t played the new patch yet but from what I’m seeing looks like the game just got even harder for me
---
Enh, I thought it was fun, really chaotic, and it was literally the polar opposite of my typical play style.
---
The smoke robots lob grenades or rubber balls at you. They take a bit to hit and seem to bounce.
---
That or im going crazy.
---
Question. With Sizzling Style, does that mean have 5 pieces of Unyielding gear....Or 5 pieces of Scout Armor....Or 5 pieces of Unyielding Scout Armor? 
---
If that makes sense.
---
If you had read the post that’s why it said SOME of you. I wasn’t generalizing anyone more people who met certain conditions (high level, ammo machine glitchers, people with elaborate camps) all those things.
---
Yep, noticed this issue in PTS footage too. Angry Turtle seemed to think it was a melee bug under the hood, or a pip-boy visual glitch.
---
How could you go from 2 shots to 1 if the card activates after the 1st hit?
---
It doesn't make sense.
---
Actually let’s add more free fast travel to crater foundation and the overseers home
---
You probably did shot him and the attacking message didn’t pop up for you and he wasn’t apart of the event just jumping in front of bullets so he can get hit
---
Yes, you keep the armor/icons/emotes but lose access to the survival tent/scrapbox and private worlds after your subscription runs out
---
There’s probably like only 1 guy on this server looking to pvp and the other 40 are all playing hide and seek
---
You should be able to get a one star vampire for your build pretty cheaply. And buying troubleshooters armor is usually pretty cheap as well. I'd say get even one piece of ehatevr kind you cna find. The 15% reduction makes a big difference for gutsies because I don't belive it's affected by their anti armor ability.
---
Endurance does add to max hp.
---
Did they erase the ghost space from the ammo factory?
---
Clearly didn’t farm enough if those 5 UNY pieces aren’t also all matching 😉
---
(Hint: make SS armor!)
---
Buffing all the mobs without similarly buffing our defenses is probably the biggest "WTF were they thinking???" issue I have with the update so far. I'm on the junk node near the miner monument, and other than the occasional level 60 mutant who wandered off the golf course I never saw anything worse than level 20 something rats and moles. 
---
Today I log in, and within 5 minutes my house is getting ass blasted by level 75 liberators. I hear the "pew, pew!" as I was in my stash, and in the 30 seconds it took me to finish and investigate they had destroyed 2 walls, a couple concrete fortifications, a workbench, a terminal, and some razorgrain.
---
Not with stealth builds
---
You get to keep all the cosmetics and atoms. The only things you lose are the private world and survival tent. For the scrap box you can remove stuff but can’t put anything new in.
---
I think I w as in that server, stole loads of ammo from him!
---
It wasn’t a bother. Just providing guidance.
---
I cant imagine how you'd get that much of a nerf? Not even my 1.7k went down that low. Maybe XB1 nerf is slightly different?
---
Btw, how the balls do you even get up to 3.1k? All +str unyielding, mutations etc?
---
Make sure not to use Poison Ivy to whipe.
---
I think its set lehendary effects.
---
I ran this with a team of randoms while wearing power armour and over encumbered, its not that hard, i switched to commando just before the update so i don’t know if rifleman has a harder time with daily ops. Weapon bashing their final bit of health and using 5/6 stimpacks was enough to see me through.
---
I could run a few with ya, gt is CrimsonCammando.
---
Angry Turtle did a guide video a day or two ago, where he demonstrated that you don't even have to kill the enemies. Just stand there and tank the damage, speedrunning the objectives to get max loot.
---
For robot ops specifically, use 5 pieces of troubleshooter's armor, dodgy, ricochet, serendipity, and a vampire's weapon (don't need to fire it, just have it drawn, to exploit how it works with ricochet).
---
fix, fixer, fixest
---
I am a casual player as well, and this has been a huge nerf and downgrade for me. Why box everyone in to this one game mode when like I said, have there be options? But no, your small brain could never handle that option because you’re so high and mighty and up Todd’s ass. Great that YOU love it but don’t diminish others who aren’t enjoying themselves anymore. Maybe you need to stop being selfish one and realize you aren’t the centre of attention your mommy made you think that you are, you’re the one who is crying buddy.
---
Junkies shotgun with power armor :)
---
It feels like playing Killing Floor or Serious Sam ... I would have no issue if the mode wasn’t tied to making progress on Armor Ace. I understand that some players want faster paced gameplay in Fallout, but when you combine it with Bethesda’s famous glitchiness ... it just feels broken and tiresome.
---
Stored ones are stored but unplacable, as they always were.
---
absolute mad lad
---
two things. first the damage "nerf", second the higher the enemy level for super mutants the more armor/health they have.
---
Shouldn’t riflemen roll with gauss now?  There is finally a purpose for such an overkill weapon
---
Wouldn't be a problem if the simple 'switch to last weapon' button hasn't always been bugged to hell.  Seriously this is one of the 'how damn hard is it, every other game gets this right like a no brainer' issues and it's been in place since day 2.  As in, it worked at first and one of the very first patches broke it.
---
I think Master Infiltrator should remain at the default rank. This way you still get three ranks of hacking/lock picking but won’t accidentally open player ones, most of which are level 2 or 3 anyway.
---
Only took 5 months
---
You can hot key pieces of armor like different chests at least,
---
I just made a topic asking the same. ha.
---
just noticed that the vault boy in luck of the draw has a r91, too. what's even worse is that the skin is in the files since around launch.
---
I’m still running bloodied unarmed after patch, haven’t had much of an issue killing high level enemies and have already taken on the Daily Op, so I’d say bloodied in all forms is still a good build tbh.
---
Ammo factory maxed, Ammosmith maxed is so great....450 .50 per craft + super duper maxed. The fun never ends!
---
I was killed by a lvl 50 molerat today. I’m lvl 105. This is our life now.
---
I’ve been doing that.  Testing multiple weapons as well.  Constantly showing.   And I first started testing because I was doing craap dmg (like 150) to the robots and went heeeeey
---
I love this but can we also possibly get free fast travel for other factions? For example free fast travel to Whitespring Bunker for Enclave or the observatory for the Brotherhood? That’s probably asking too much though...
---
At least the alien blaster was buffed right?
---
I forgot about that guy.  Now I reread it and actually chuckled.
---
Yep.  My sneaky rifleman build threw on a handful of melee perks I had lying around, and was trying to powerfist them the entire fight.  I died like 8 times before a 250+ dude showed up in power armor and I realized I could shoot them nearly to death and just slap them for the kill.
---
Delete this post immediately - I command it *uses +150 strength speech check*
---
I didn't use a firearm
---
And I'm 100% sure I didn't hit him with my super sledge
---
2 other players just came and crouched besides me then we all stood up and waved to each other😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 and I survived over 16 minutes, I’m awsome a PVP
---
I maxed out charisma, master infiltrator, what rads. Im happy with the second and third. But I probably would have gone endurance or agility or even luck or intelligence if i had known earlier.
---
Indeed
---
The damage nerf is what’s bad. Without it the update would be great. And no, don’t try to tell me why the nerf is actually good. IT’S NOT.
---
depends on what you mean by best. dps isn't everything. but generally, yes. bloodied builds still have the highest dps.
---
although B weapon themselves might be slightly weaker than TSE variants in some cases.
---
That would be awesome! Gt is Reeses0702. I invited you.
---
Nice assumption. Ive already done the queen solo before in 3 mins, so dont play ad hominem and actually look at what im trying to fucking say.
---
Ty for the reminder
---
Yes, you will keep it after your subscription expires. Also, any junk you put in the scap box will still be there afterwards. (you can retrieve junk from it, you just cant add anything back in)
---
Oh damn that’s an eye opener right there, skin’s been there since launch but we still have the janky commonwealth weapons and some new stuff, damn 😔
---
Yeah I saw you added before. Nah I normally just DM on reddit its alot easier
---
I'd rather the gear itself be transferable. My bloodied commando main has scrapped tons of shit that my other characters would find useful, but there's no way to move it.
---
It also killed any desire to run that quest line and rep grind on other characters because then I'd run into the same problem with them rolling things that don't fit their build.
---
Yeah I used to be a sniper then I got a bloodied mole miner gauntlet with the extra blade mod the damage was bananas had to switch my build. So I get the argument but like you said just hope they add some adjustments and make the other builds more viable. Like why not have nocturnal stack giving more damage with nocturnal armor pieces and give more damage overall if I did work at night would think about making a build.
---
If thats the case then id be disappointed honestly. Its only a 1 star and its 2 legendary modules which is 100 scrip plus, the gutter from the quest does the same thing, just doesnt look as pretty. Especially with them remodeling it to look worn. Lol
---
I logged on after MONTHS of refusing to play. I just couldnt get past the visual issues that have been there since launch it feels like. Not to mention the game was getting extremely stale.
---
Logged on after the patch, went to whitesprings resort and checked to see if the same visual glitch was still there and it was. Same for bodies of water and a sword in one hand, the ugly ass visual that appears kills me.
---
These issues for me are so unbearable I couldnt play again because it looks so ugly.  That being said, the 45 seconds I did play, i didnt get to experience any other issues.
---
He prob shot you with the roses syringe.  I know this used to be a way to initiate damage to a player without the pvp trigger.  I dunno if this was patched or not.
---
Thanks mister.
---
Full may matching on Type of armor- all secret service, all wood ect.
---
You mean like normal, master, and expert tier weapon cards or whatever? Yeah u can have all 3 equipped and they’ll work
---
Don’t know why it’s still being called a bloodied nerf
---
Gotcha, that's simple enough. Thanks mate.
---
THIS
---
yes if youre a rifleman youll want all 3 maxed eventually..
---
personally I dont max them all as soon as I can in favor of grabbing other perks I use in my build first.. but eventually yeah youll want to max all the cards for your weapon type
---
white fedora?
---
That muscle mass gets wrecked FAST
---
But will it work if you change the paint to all match up? Cause I know thats an option on all the pieces.
---
Yeah probably not. Like all the other unintended bugs in the other updates.
---
If you put them next to eachother, as when you do the card sound effect gets higher
---
That is certainly an option but I’d like to leverage the strengths of my build (I like to shoot stuff)
---
People sure do throw around the term useless a lot.
---
Yep since you can’t use them on your zero level character we may as well not have them
---
Cause people don't read.
---
Oh yeah, those too. My main has the good backpack, the other 3 have to be satisfied with the +30 carry weight, cause I'm sure as hell not grinding out all those badges again.
---
Where'd you get the plan? Daily ops?
---
Crap, thought I had on all Scout, but I need a right arm.
---
I believe there is a topic in the hot tab with a bethesda reply in regards to this
---
I completed it with two of us. But it’s a pain in the ass defending point B and 20 of em show up. Won’t be doing many of those. On top of that, I don’t have ANY melee weapons because I run heavy gunner.
---
What happened to getting rid of food and drink penalties and the steel dawn questline? Sorry I've been out of the loop both on this reddit and the game for about 2 months and can't seem to find any info on it
---
then yes, bloodied is still the way to go if by best you mean dps.
---
molerats have become the graboids from the movie tremors. 
---
" Burt, it's under the ground! It's an underground monster! Now get out! Hurry! "
---
I tried to change colour once and couldn’t do it, will try it again in the morning and update you.
---
Well at least to me it feels like a slap in the face. I grinded and traded for a long time to get my high-end bloodied weapons and unyielding secret service armor, knowing that it would be able to put out enough damage to dispose of most all enemies (except bosses) in just a couple seconds. If you want challenge, craft yourself an unmodded level 1 pipe rifle. Now, this game isn’t that fun to me, as I should not have to spend more than a couple seconds on trash mobs with over 1000 hours in the game and the best gear.
---
The big thing that sucks about resilient is you basically have to bash if you want to get the right ammo. If you switch to melee for that last hit which is more reliable and has better range, you get random ammo. Found this out after killing a bunch of bots with ultracite 50 and not getting any back.
---
&gt;It would definitely be easier and faster than leveling one single character as the xp needed goes up drastically. 
---
well, yeah? it'd still be a slog, though.
---
&gt;You could level a character to get to some easily reachable point, while picking up that bonus 50 perk coins in the process that is once per character, delete the toon and start over. 
---
shouldn't get 50 points for making a new character if they make this change anyway... also again with the max char and max deletions per week would solve the issue of rerolling low level derps just for that. they could also disallow breaking down cards until you are at least level 50 which would render people trying to abuse the early burst of cards moot since you could only do that X(in eso's case, 3) times per week.
---
&gt;Using low level unyielding set for extra int xp bonus and the already opened legendary perk card slots the whole leveling process would be trivial and super fast.
---
ok but is it hit-level-50-in-an-hour fast cuz if it's not that's 39 x whatever the time it takes to hit 50 to max them all out. assuming the absolute minimum of 1 hour for 1-50 that'd be 39 solid hours of doing nothing but speed-leveling new alts to break down their cards. that said i'm pretty sure it's not nearly that fast, you'd still have to do this shit at least for a few hours on each toon so it would bloat the total time massively.
---
Once again trashgoblyn. Yes.
---
Could be a weird interaction with a retaliation perk/mod/effect/consumable and the explosive damage i guess- like If it triggered an electric bolt from that one mutation
---
Very simply put,
---
It was A x B x C = dmg, when calculating some damage output modifiers before
---
Now it is A + B + C = dmg modifiers
---
Makes damage MUCH easier to calculate and scale. 
---
It hurts in the now, but things will get better as they tweak values.
---
Edit: words for clarification
---
solo it.
---
At least they fixed the bug where more players caused Earle and the SBQ to just outright ignore some damage!
---
Never killed them so quickly before.
---
Random mook enemies are a bigger pain in the ass now though.
---
Why would they want to keep the same net difficulty? The previous state was absolute cancer. Now there's at least a base for improvement. Fix explosive energy guns, remove hacked weapons, ban the rest of the dupers/cheaters, fix damage overflow, and we can have a game whose balance isn't a fucking joke
---
You could have increased your budget by accident... If you use the small generators, and scrap the wrong one( think it was the vault tech one) you ended up with an inflated budget.
---
I hate this update so much. Shotgun builds? Nerfed. Stealth builds? Nerfed. Sniper builds? Nerfed. Melee builds? Nerfed. Nerfed. Nerfed.
---
As if the Heavy/PA meta wasn't bad enough before. Since all molerats, ghouls and all "trash" enemies are now back to being serious threats as if you're some level1 scrub....well.... Tested it out just for "fun" how many auto-shotty shots it takes to kill even one scorched. More than there's shots in the magazine AKA way too many. And that's with the shotgunner perk cards. Without them, well. RIP.
---
My lord, please please PLEASE BSG GIVE PLAYERS THE OPTION TO OPT OUT OF LEVEL SCALING. I REALLY don't need that scorched's sh\*\*\*y pipe gun to be level 50. I really don't.
---
I get it but such a drastic hit in damage while only going up 32 levels in crazy.
---
I just bought the game 👀 i hope it aint soon
---
This is more a result of the changes to damage bonus stacking than the level increase.
---
You can still one shot enemies in ESO if you have a decent build!
---
I think it’s V.A.T.S. that has dropped off considerably. If I manually go for head shots still hits pretty good but with V.A.T.S. it sucks. No crits either using V.A.T.S. are popping up like before.
---
it's probably worse. can't go to whitesprings with a bloodied or magic weapon and cheese the high level ghouls anymore.
---
I wondered since they would be doing ops in there if it would permanently open up.
---
I would have figured Ward to enter the market with a brand of sleeping aid, but he probably had to pivot strategy after BGS tied him to his desk.
---
Am I the only one pissed about melee getting murdered?
---
Yup, that’s in this game too. Iirc a radscorpion omelette removes all addictions
---
Treasure hunter event is coming back soon, so looks like the pool is already updated
---
Has to be the same type forest, urban or the vault variations.
---
Makes sense, ty for explaining
---
It's possible, if you know what to do and where to go.
---
After I figured out what to do I managed to get it done in 7min 50sec in a two man team. 
---
Should be easier with more people.
---
They too busy complaining their bloodied builds are only killing enemies in 3-4 shots as opposed to 1.
---
and that's when you get stun locked, lol
---
Max level liberators are no joke. I got wrecked by a bunch of them at Dolly Sod's, prior to this patch. Knew not to tangle with them again after that.
---
Now those fuckers are right outside the vault. Yikes.
---
If you're on xbox try LFG
---
Yes there’s addictol, just hard to find. Try a few stations then check vendors around your map. 
---
Hope this helps
---
It is permanently opened without the ops!
---
Dammit, then I need an urban right arm and left leg then
---
What he said ! Lol
---
I'm launching a nuke right now on Xbox gamertag astral resin. The only thing I noticed is it takes more bullets
---
You realize the op is timed right? And if you move away to melee kill the enemies that stay at range you get too far to progress?
---
If you want to make the 8 min timer for the best rewards solo you have to tank the damage. Hope you have a vampire ranged weapon or a lot of stims.
---
Also no stealth whatsoever! A staple of fallout games. Because reasons! Like poor game design that would trivialize the encounter in stealth.
---
god i hate endless waves of enemies.  not as much as my framerate hates it tho
---
All damage is now calculated additively, rather than multiplicatively. Additionally, the damage bonuses are now calculated based on a weapon's based unmodded damage, rather than the base damage + damage mod. 
---
For example, say you have a hunting rifle that deals 100 damage, the hardened receiver (+25% damage), 3 full rank rifleman cards (+ 60%) , and bloodied with 50% missing health (+ 50%).
---
With the old formula, your damage would be (100 * 1.25) * (1.6) * (1.5) = 300 damage. 
---
With the new formula, your damage would be 100 + (100 * 0.25) + (100 * 0.6) + (100 * 0.5) = 235 damage.
---
reward list is way to short and uninteresting for it to not be a disapointment
---
Two Shot Explosive with lvl 5 explosive perk was better in angry turtles testing:  
---
TSE &gt; AAE &gt; BE (with perks though AA and B were basically tied)
---
I’ll have to compare manual aim to VATs and see if I’ve got the same issue
---
The main point of using what rads is the healing rads effect. Isn't the best thing in the world neither, but still has some usefulness
---
Sure it is
---
As soon as I loaded in I was set upon by 2 lvl 75 molerats and barely got out alive and my alt is lvl 147 so I can relate.
---
Went into a silo and noped the hell out a there, lvl 75 assaultrons/sentrybots. My bloodied char had enough troubles with lvl 25 assaultrons lol
---
Exactly. I have over 1000 hours in this game and some of the best gear possible. It’s perfectly fine to one-shot super mutants at this stage. If people don’t want that or want their “challenge,” craft an unmodded level 1 pipe rifle and use that. You don’t have to have the best gear to enjoy the game, but you shouldn’t punish those players who grinded it out expecting to be able to one-shot everything.
---
If you were using Demo expert to up the damage well.... That's gone lol no longer effects the base damage multiplier :P
---
Yeah just got it from completing it in 7 min 30 seconds for best reward. It was the rare reward,
---
Or even check reddit and see the talks of nerfs for weeks from people on the pts...
---
I just ran it solo and I thought it was pretty damn challenging but would be much more doable if the modifier wasn’t resilient, then I got to the boss phase and oh my the horror. The assaultron had miniguns for hands AND the laser beam head, damn near crapped my pants.... barely hit initiate level rewards lol
---
If I manually aim for the head it’s almost like before. V.A.T.S. seems to be whats not working properly now that ive had more time. Seems i dont get any crit hits and they are lower figures than a manual shot.
---
Keep in mind, the people who are in their 60s now were in their late 20s or 30s when the NES dropped 30+ years ago. My dad turned 67 this year and he still kicks his grandson's ass at most games. 😂
---
Very true but I had a 99% success rate.  I’m not too salty as this was not intended as a feature but it was handy.
---
Revenge of the molerats.
---
I'm not quite sure what emotion to feel at the fact you bought your way through the whole board within the first 24 hrs... Shock, awe, anger, pity, envy. I just don't know. You've really thrown me lol..
---
there is nowhere to farm materials while conserving wear&amp;tear on gear anymore..
---
Stealth is only barred in the Uplink daily Op.
---
What system do you play on?
---
Lots of great stuff to be excited about. I've only been playing for 8 weeks and everything is still new regardless.
---
I still feel brand new even though I have already logged 270 hours and hit level 97. I think half the time spent was inventory management.
---
Might just be me, never know with this game. Good thing it was mostly junk from the purveyor sale but there was a few keepers.
---
Yep welcome to fo76 dark souls edition
---
its not more challanging we just use more bullets :V
---
Any build is viable if it can kill just because it's not meta doesn't mean it's bad. Bows make for some pretty good long ranged dps
---
I remember back in the day the quickest way to do collision course was to stand in the crater and pot shot scorched as they jumped off the cliff to their death.  Shit XP, but it made the event not take so long.
---
Smart!
---
Kudos for admitting that.
---
its just re blueprinted. I placed my camp right back down. and no i didn't build them, but they're always open to the public lol
---
Also that's his broken with bloody builds as soon as you hit vats and try to shoot them the first 30 bullets Miss
---
Yes exactly my thoughts, I was going to be cheeky and get the Munitions plant but it’s been sat on all day , presumably because it’s needed to maintain ammo reasonably lol
---
i thought it was great fun!!
