I'm on xbox but I appreciate the offer
---
No problem bud. Still nothing lol
---
I end up hotkeying purified water and canned dog food (canned coffee for sprinting, sugar for post vats shot). The only time I'll open my inventory to eat something specific is for ragstag meat or brahmin steak.
---
Even a sorting function would be nice. I mean I can sort by weight and then take off my thruhiker perk but that just seems tedious.
---
Thanks!
---
It is obviously fiction, as there is no way he ran through 10 fusion cores on a laser weapon without it breaking, hahaha.
---
ive always enjoyed the game..last week i was extremely salty didnt play for 4 days but i got over it and im fine now..building up my new alt character helped also

Unless it actually is a magazine

I definitely don't think that's the case since the level 24 Assaultrons at Watoga drop underleveled loot just as you expect (yes, even the legendary ones that seem to have a much lower spawn rate than the Protectrons there) a lvl 24 enemy to drop while vanilla Assaultrons (i.e. has that exact name without something like a "Charred" or "Glowing" prefix) can definitely appear at a higher level. From what I've experienced they just seem to drop the legendary roll at the closest level below theirs while possibly rounding up if very close and obviously rounding up if below the min. level for the weapon in question.
---
&gt; Have you tested that? I've pulled and replugged ethernet cables before, that was a decade ago. Lots of progress in netcode techniques since then.  
---
  
---
I mean you can always find the exception to the rule of course.  
---
But modern shooters do not have very high tolerances compared to a decade ago.  
---
Mind you high ping is one thing, but we're talking about a complete lack of response from the client.  
---
With just high ping your client is still responding, there's a steady stream of packets they're just "old".  
---
With complete packet loss there's just no packets coming, it's a different beast.  
---
As you pointed out it's easy enough to test, just disconnect your router.  
---
Mind you, disconnecting just your computer from your home network is not enough, as your router is still visible (And technically replying to TCP packets and/or receiving UDP packets) even if they don't have a path from the router to your PC.
---
This deserves a medal.
---
&gt;Give me an elite riot gear outfit and Ill pay $5-10.
---
Yeah, sign me up for that too.
---
It‚Äôs been bugged since the beginning, everyone ends up doing that quest and coming here to say the same thing, unfortunately (no offense to you of course)
---
‚ÄúI lost my power armor/ ammo/ tse weapon because of this quest!‚Äù
---
I personally don‚Äôt see how you could lose anything. If you haven‚Äôt changed your button scheme, you should be opening the container with X, and moving things with A, so unless you‚Äôre either stupid, fat fingered, or pressed A immediately after opening it, there‚Äôs no way you could possible lose anything.
---
Wonder though if you can just blueprint a couple of stacked foundations. Might save some time building.
---
Not sure about the others but my first build was a sniper ninja with some shotgun mixed in. My second build is a pistol build. The dynamic is a little different because I need to focus on other skill cards for this build.
---
I've never had a problem with my turrets not killing things unless it's a scorchbeast or in a high level, high density area. One on one, maybe an issue especially if they shoot back, but you never place a turret by itself. 
---
Always have turrets placed so they can cover each other, focus on the same targets, cover the same area, and use a spotlight to help focus and aggro sooner. I use 4 heavy laser turrets and a spotlight in a location that regularly spawns 5-6 mobs in two separate groups and the only things I ever have to repair are the punji boards I put on their path to my water purifiers and the fence pieces that surround them. 
---
gettem!
---
Happened to me too, I think because I managed to hit it a few times.
---
I just stored it and when I placed it back it was fine again
---
I think it will make a comeback like ESO and NMS. The question is will it have the playerbase to support it OR be able to attract new players. I think yes to both. 
---
NMS hardly attracts new players but ESO for example barely has the same type of player who bought it at release. It's almost an entirely different playerbase.
---
 There's a lot of players who held off on buying due to negative press and once new content comes out they'll be giving it a shot.
---
Not to mention there will be players still playing no matter how bad it gets. Bethesda would have to shut down the servers to get them to leave
---
Im reading this while I'm fast traveling. Oops.
---
I'll do you one better - 2 x 3 star legendaries in the same area that bugged out so you couldn't loot them at all.
---
They lowered legendary drop chances to 30% after release cause too many legendaries were dropping. Check the November patch notes
---
Workshops are not worth it. Anything you can harvest at them you can get way faster just swooping around the map scavenging.
---
That‚Äôs what the fuck that is! I see the red shinny balloon every time and I try and open it up or see what‚Äôs in there, but that makes total sense!  Thank you! 
---
Because I totally said make the same build. 100%. Word for word. Yes I did didn‚Äôt I. 
---
Not actively trying to abuse PvP mechanics and not acting like autists in voice chat would be nice. First part is equally Bethesda's fault though. 
---
Yes, however,  why the grief? I was doing my quest for the fun of doing it...
---
I kinda wish I had bought the ‚Äúfruit bowl‚Äù hat or the daredevil suit that was offered for a few days back in November.  Neither really fit the game but it‚Äôs that ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù aspect that makes me wish I had pulled the trigger on either/both of them.
---
I‚Äôve quit yet I still come here everyday hoping for a massive update
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say mobs but there‚Äôs plenty of times when I came back to my camp and a mole rat or mutant or one those flying eye robots just zapping away at a wall or a generator while my turret was doing nothing.
---
I notice a lot more grievers...people bored and pissed off with nothing more to do than destroy camps. üëç
---
It‚Äôs because jaw harp players need to stand. Outside. By themselves.
---
&gt;	Disconnecting just your computer from your home network is not enough, as your router is still visible (And technically replying to TCP packets and/or receiving UDP packets) even if they don‚Äôt have a path from the router to your PC.
---
That's not how nat'd networks work. It's an outbound connection to the game servers, not an inbound port forwarded connection.
---
Well, that's basically what it is, except it required an extensive redesign and rewrite of a large percent of the game engine to accommodate multiplayer.  As such, it was impractical to use FO4 as a starting point.  Also, if they had we'd be complaining how lazy they are not to make a new game since it took them so long to do it. 
---
There is \[a great documentary\]([https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs](https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs)) about what it took to develop FO76.  It goes into some detail on why they couldn't just add multiplayer to FO4.
---
Didn't know about deathclaws bellies. Usually ive relied on grenades, mines or shotgun to blow away their easily crippled legs. A legless deathclaw is a sad and pathetic sight. Poor things. 
---
Wall/ceiling mounted turrets: Barrel.
---
There is a giant stone face on the ‚Äúfloating‚Äù island in the mire. There is a cave you can enter and it is at the bottom of it. Have you seen it?
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll come out and admit it but my post talked about the workshops you take over. One example would be the airport one and if you aren‚Äôt present, your turrets don‚Äôt do anything and your workshop will eventually be overran. 
---
Good question, need some one to nuke it :)
---
Take a close look at what's in your stored column. sometimes there's just a ton of old junk eating up huge chunks of budget. There's also some issues where it will store entire copies of your whole camp as a blueprint if you join a server where that spot is already taken. You might have to scrap those, and then scrap all the duplicate items. 
---
Maxed out TSE‚Äôs of course. Because god mode 
---
No, but I might in the future to support new content. I'm fine with buying crowns in ESO because there's so much content there, and I bought the game for only $10 (never mind that I also pay for ESO Plus). Also, ESO's store prices are a lot more reasonable, but there's no way to earn them in-game.
---
Because they're just sitting on shelves and no one is buying
---
Means ‚Äúfancy‚Äù
---
Welcome to the wasteland.
---
Well I can tell you right now that I run full sent/assassin set and tse dont hurn me if I'm standing  still. 
---
Lol...
---
Good to know, this has happened to me multiple times, super aggravating.
---
or anybody, they won't back down because then they admit the "PvP slap" was a bad idea, but they should back down, it's a shit idea, and obsolete once PvP servers are implemented, how it should have worked all along is full pacifist, you deal no damage and take no damage...  but yeah, I agree when in pacifist you should also do no damage to non hostiles
---
I‚Äôm still working on getting enough acid to smelt out all the lead I got from a single lucky hole trip, acid is always my problem, and even the extractors don‚Äôt really produce enough fast enough unless you really farm them. :( 
---
TSE was broken af and is still not absolutely horrible. 
---
A perfect summation, I think. 
---
Second character is about my limit. I had created a third alt to make the gain a level 10 atom points daily easier but kind of gave up and deleted the character.
---
Currently it's just cap grinding and trying to get every crafting recipe in the game and fiddling with the base building. (I mean might as well right? efficient wiring alone takes some finangling)
---
I think it would take finding a group of players to quest/roleplay with. Kind of shenannigins it like having each person embody a trope and tackling challenges as a group
---
Gotta love it when a single enemy, whether it a molerat, or a scorched from a mile away can wreck your base, and your turrets do absolutely nothing the whole time.
---
It might stem from lack of items in their creations as well. I have a war room but no clutter for this room. It's literally a table, chairs, a terminal to no-where, and the glow map that was from post release at the cost of atoms. They simply need more free CAMP items. And not through the Atom store. An update with free unlocked components.
---
I have a code...
---
Never mind...
---
Same. The only reason I haven't purchased any is that I have gotten more than enough atoms from questing to buy everything that's actually worth buying. If they vastly increased the amount of stuff in the store, especially additional outfits and more camp stuff, then that may change.
---
There is a magazine called "locks &amp; tumblers" that increases the lock pick level
---
Because when given the chance to be an asshole to someone weaker than you or nice to someone weaker than you, its gunna be a 50/50 toss up because people are dicks.
---
At this point I think the reason they're not adding more guns is because the game is so rickety that it can't handle many more unique data entries. Instead we get a ton of novelty melee weapons like screwdrivers and rolling pins.
---
And on console the controller is constantly shaking. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs people leaving the game, if it was they would just have fewer servers going and keep the others full.
---
I think it‚Äôs more that people aren‚Äôt as clumped up as they were at launch. When most of us started there were some high level beta players off to the east, and everyone was clustered near the beginning area. Then you‚Äôve got people branching out on deifferent quest lines so there‚Äôs still clumping, but it‚Äôs spread out more. I think we‚Äôre at the point now where most of the newbies are former high levels starting over, people have found their buddies so they aren‚Äôt looking for more, and just in general people are more spread out doing their own thing
---
If we maintain the status quo, no, absolutely zero confidence.
---
If there are some major changes like a boost in staff and experience, a change in management, then maybe.
---
What's truly the worst is that the game doesn't work around it, either by blocking that area for settlements or spawning elsewhere.
---
Only sprinting ap. In vats it is the same.
---
I didnt ask for your opinion, not only that but my not capitolizing on a sever influx of over powered weapons and armour is an everyone problem. If you dont have it your basocally out of luck, so why dont you take your sorry duping ass and get the hell out of this game. You and your are the reason this game sucks. Not bethesda. You.
---
Im not even going to give you the light of day to explain why im writing so much you sorry peice of shit.
---
Can we just scrap them for card points, resulting in another card pic ? 1 for 1*, 2 for 2*, 3 for 3*, etc.. Scraping a 3* gives 3 lvl 1 cards to pic from the list. This way we can "Actually" change our build out progressively. Don't wanna be a heavy gunner no more ? Just scrap out your heavy cards &amp; redraw new cards for that pistol build.   Make it available at level up like normal. So if you scrap out 5 cards, at lvl up you could pic 6 cards instead of just 1! 
---
&gt; That's not how nat'd networks work. It's an outbound connection to the game servers, not an inbound port forwarded connection.  
---
I never said anything about inbound connections.  
---
If you connect to something, that thing does indeed see your connection coming from your router, and can very much send packets to you.  
---
Otherwise there'd be no connection :/  
---
Suck 
---
Give it 6 months, I don't expect major content changes before then
---
Wait you found a screwdriver weapon?
---
Exploring still is pretty fun, but to do basically anything else you will be grinding for one thing or another. 
---
Then why are you writing, if it‚Äôs clear that you don‚Äôt think the company did any wrong and it‚Äôs just me?
---
Depends on the junk. A lot of stuff actually sells without bulking (gold, silver, gears, ect), it's mostly the common things (Steel and Wood) that have to be bulked to sell.
---
Personally I find it even more of a "~~sorry~~ Fuck you, try again^^bitch " when I actually get a legendary but it's some roll that is hardly better at all than the stock weapon like a Quad +33% VATS hit chance +15% reload speed Flamer. Like gee, thanks Bethesda, now I never have to reload this piece of shit that would break before 4 tanks worth of fuel anyway and after it's finally never I can reload 15% faster saving me 0s of time in combat. It's those times that remind you that the loot table is beyond sadistic and how much of an idiot you were for thinking that if only the drops were actually dropping you too could be like Charlie and find the golden RNG drop after wasting all that time wallowing in the RNG poverty slums littered with garbage.
---
I took on my first SB solo yesterday. I've fought them before with friends and hadn't noticed, but it seemed the sonic blasts did not stop for an unusually long time for me. I couldn't see a thing and got wasted the first try before having a second go in power armor (wish that wasn't necessary). I just assumed this was either because there's usually other people around to keep the SB from laying me flat every time, or maybe it was just another unlucky glitch. Have SBs always been this way for solo combat?
---
They can be annoying. Even more so when you take cover in what you would think is a building that can sheild you momentarily and the fucking sonic blasts go right through every fucking wall like there was no cover at all.. And they're supposed to break off pursuit once you get so far but lately they follow me everywhere
---
Fast travel when encumbered can cost 4x as much. Reduced with perk cards.
---
These camps are pretty tricky. if the ladder touches down on th the ground you'll get an unable to delete inaccessible error 
---
I've had to rebuild from scratch a couple times.
---
In any case, the fun part of an all concrete base is to be able to call in an artillery strike without getting wanted
---
That‚Äôs part of the reason I like the game despite the problems, for me the main draw was always the aesthetic and exploring the world
---
Oh wait.  They added that.. Into the atom store for real money.. (Kidding of course)
---
All of the workshops are in a common area for all to use. Personal house is locked off though. People usually break in though bc I have a tower they want to explore
---
Nope.
---
The design philosophy from the get go seems to be focused on grinding. 
---
As an explorer I am disappointed that nearly every single location is void of interest. Just baffling they made these sites landmarks. 
---
I understand Todd wants to invent the perfect sandbox, but the game is far more Todd's "want" and far less a sandbox. 
---
I'd just take a video of them already being broken AKA Destroyed, pan camera to face and say "seriously replace this."
---
I think you should actually be mad at the person who programmed Skyrim‚Äôs dragons and also the person who copy and pasted that into FO76
---
If nobody knows it works it will be ok.  Perks only get nerfed when they start to seem like mandatory picks...allegedly....
---
Er, I meant drill. It's like a crappier Ripper.
---
They‚Äôre sadder than those New Vegas-Sierra Madre fog people, because mole miners are still (mostly) sane and communicating to each other
---
God forbid you find a decent weapon but can't hit them because of all the damn trees . but their blasts have no trouble homing in on me
---
Is it just me or are they starting to spawn in random areas? I've had my camp in the same spot for week's and only ever saw things like mole rats or the occasional super mutant etc but then last night I get a lvl 60 SB attacking the shit out my camp after I fast travelled back to it. (side note how much does it suck getting attacked while still in a loading screen) My lvl 29 stupid ass broke near every weapon I had not to mention broken armour just trying to put up a good fight rather than just disconnect from server. Couldn't even get a quarter of its health down before I gave up... I'd already been struggling keeping up repairing things as it was with finding enough screws not to mention bullets with lead so now I can't even repair half my weapons and I need to spend a few sessions just after more lead and screws.
---
But ultimately my dumb ass learnt never stay to fight. Always disconnect from server haha 
---
with the backwards fuckin' pageantry of the last patch i've decided to take a break for awhile. I'll probably come back in awhile once I get my moneys worth of the RE2 remake to see all thats changed...and hopefully fixed
---
Is there a trick to printing out a leveling plan?  It print-previews really janky in 3 different browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge).
---
Until it wears off and you don't want to relog. 
---
What's the deal with that anyway. My buddy and I wanted to start a little village but I had to be a looooong way away before I could drop my C.A.M.P.
---
I‚Äôm looking at you Charleston Station campers.
---
Yeah, had one fuck up my base while I was just a lowly lvl 35 merrily crafting weapons. . . and I was in the forest zone where it should not have spawned.  Managed to eventually kill it by expending almost all the ammo and stimpacks I had while breaking all my guns and armor only to get a pretty pathetic amount of xp for a 20 minute epic solo battle.  Oh and I got some meat, brains, couple of shitty leather armor bits and a stimpack.  Woo.  I mean yeah I get that the fact that I don't wear power armor means I burn through healing resources more quickly, but I got far more xp and resources one-shotting lvl 5 supermutants in half the time and without having to deal with bullshit radiation beams.  
---
I've never disliked the game, I think it needs some easier to get into group activities since I mostly play with a few friends.
---
Is one rank of each better than say 3 ranks of one?
---
You're character looks retarted
---
I'm tired of having to repair my armor and weapons only to realize I didn't have fix it good or weapon artisan. 
---
In the far south of the Ash Heap? God I went to an event there and discovered it was being attacked by a scorchbeast. I actually re-logged probably 4 times, and every time the thing would spawn again and spot me right away. Ran nearly to Welsch before it finally gave up or lost me.
---
Master switch is next to the fusion generator
---
Whats with the fear of clipping? Some games, like Dragon Age, even let the weapons float in free air a hand-length off the characters back, just to avoid clipping. I think clipped models looks better than floating items, personally.
---
Yeah, not sure if I wasn't clear that's basically what I meant. They always drop the highest they can within their own level
---
I logged in a few days ago to see the shape of the game and its improvements after I stopped playing for about 2 months. I thought "theres no way its gonna be as bad as it was when i first played".
---
Boy ways i wrong.
---
After about 8 minutes of playing, the server crashed and was knocked back to the title screen. Absolutely shit. Bethesda still hasn't fixed CORE problems with the game and I honestly don't wanna boot up this game again unless they make it possible to play on a local server (not private because I wanna mod the hell out of it because its deeply needed). 
---
The state of the game is still shit and honestly, I hope they scale down on DLC for 76 in order to make Starfield amazing.
---
Oh really? Wow that's generous. Hey you guys should buy some stuff in the Atomic Shop! :)
---
What do you mean it doesn‚Äôt change the point dude? Not a single one of those games has ever had fans flocking away in droves because it‚Äôs in a state of disrepair. You‚Äôre comparing a game that has horrific reviews and is being handed out for free with used controllers at game stores all over the world because it did so bad in sales to games that have won game of the year and have never been anywhere near where 76 currently is. 
---
The difference is, people stop playing those games after hours and hours of great experience months or years after they release because they are satisfied and it gets repetitive, not less than four months in, before any additional content is even added. It‚Äôs completely different. 
---
I usually find a 3* super mutant in harpers ferry after going to the vendor. Either close to the vendor on other side of his location (north) or in the vicinity of the church. 
---
The AI sucks they and sbq just stand there and let you drill them in the face without flinching.   So dumb.   So fake. 
---
Outbound connections go through network address translation. When you physically disconnect a network port, a router immediately clears all NAT connections associated with that port.
---
When the port is reconnected a new NAT connection must be started. 
---
This issue is often solved by tracking the clients session ID server side and when a new connection starts with the same session ID you know it's the previously connected client.
---
Yeah, no..
---
I have my camp usually by twin lakes to farm the behemoth.

---
This. The big thing is that Bethesda didn't call it "Early Access," but are using the Early Access design system (Base systems on "release", months of bug and balance fixes, and a bright horizon that is not going to be here any time soon but is basically why people bought in). To be honest, I rather wish they had called it Early Access, because the game would be *literally identical* but get less "because it was released" arguments.
---
And before jimmies get ruffled, I am not claiming the game is the second coming and Bethesda is perfect and whatever other strawman you might see fit to assign. They screwed this game up badly, no argument there.
---
I will freely admit that I purchased an absolute shit load of Fallout 4 Creation Club items. Probably over $100 worth. They were quality, never affected my console and added a lot to gameplay for me. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to play with work so something new to draw me into a game I loved was a Renaissance for my character. However this was a single player game. In particular the various player houses and the sentinel power armor (truly outstanding Bethesda). So I guess I would consider myself a target demographic. 
---
The Fo76 Atom ship items are nice, but the ones people will buy are already gone. The Blackbird paint was hands down the most desirable, but because it was a limited time availability many players have tried to exploit the game trying to transfer it to people who didn‚Äôt get a chance to purchase it. If Bethesda were looking to MAKE money, my recommendation would be to setup a separate department to solicit common Reddit posters to put out field surveys about new power armor schemes. Possibly just the mods of various Fo76 SubReddits. I can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôre that difficult to program a new skin. And most people have very strong opinions about their power armor. So let‚Äôs put this game into the profit and allow us to paint our armor in various ways, but charge us. We don‚Äôt mind, but it has to be classy.  And we need RAIDER and EXCAVATOR schemes. 
---
Everyone wants to feel unique. I work in used car sales, the most common selling point is color, so take that and make some money. I would pay to be the most hardcore lookin player at the SBQ raid. Or the coolest, or the cutest. Everyone has a different niche, and there‚Äôs money to be made. Medic paint jobs, tank paint jobs, DPS paint jobs, and of course team leader paints. Every group will pick their own ranks based on colors, we just need some colors to pick.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

&gt;Could it be some connection with Elder Scrolls

Yeah, kinda like how there's some connection between art assets in FO4 and FO76. Someone at BGS said 'man, I'm super late on doing my art deco asset design for Fallout....buuuuuuttt those Dwarven faces would probably work.'

No one wants a stable flux. That's the flux you settle down with and build great things. Raw flux is makes you feel sexy and wanted. You know in the back of your mind that it's only temporary but you keep ignoring it until it's too late and they disappear on you.

Yup. You only get 1.5√ó more then rank 1 at rank 2. Only 2x more then rank 1 at rank 3. 
---
You know the weird thing, I experience this all the time, but then there are nights like last night where I will run through the golf clubhouse 2 or 3 times and get legendary items off of almost everything. I might kill 1 or 2 actual legendary ghouls, heck maybe none, but come away with 5-7 legendary items in one round. I feel like loot tables are just....off....in general.
---
If they changed the way damage works people might carry the hunters, ghoul slayers, troubleshooter weapons. But the other items are just better all around.
---
They need enemies that are truly susceptible to different damage types to make different builds viable.
---
I did this for a time. However, I find that he's very hard to defeat and is never been a legendary.
---
seems legit
---
Lead pipe, checking in.
---
Where the hell are those nice looking stairs? 
---
I've had to physically scroll up to get the legendary at the top of the box a time or two ie. if you go to loot the body, the box pops up, and while you're looking in it, the legendary drop pops in at the top, I've had to scroll up to it, even if I was already at the top drop, like caps. 
---
I uninstalled after the recent mess and uber nerfs. Might check back in a few months and see if its less of a train wreck.
---
Honestly it shouldn't be possible to damage or aggro the whitesprings bots at all for players. It's utterly pointless to be able to and just causes problems.

Go find Mothman, FOR SCIENCE!

They are freaky as fuck. You can hear them say stuff like "Oh God" while just standing around. It's like they are truly in immense pain, swimming in their own feces and urine inside their suits, lashing out at anything that comes along.

I honestly don't understand why they don't kill each other to end their suffering.

Unfortunately uninstalled it yesterday. Really don't know when I'll be coming back to it. I did get my moneys worth of enjoyment in my opinion though.

They are all random encounters except for the 'Path to Enlightment' event. There are still other random Mothman (Mothmen) including other Wise versions around the map as well but they won't commune with you, more just fly around and shoot you in the face.

Excellent Series. I guy I used to work with likes it too, but he couldn't sneak to save his life. He ended up beating it by just killing everyone. I literally can't play those games without first getting Silent Assassin on every level.
---
I feel your pain brudda but almost as bad is when you kill a 3 star legendary and it drops a 1 star item.
---
Nope, but my house is on the cliff to the left of the screen.
---
I 0 lock my Fusion Generator to keep the local scorched out, they live quite close by, and the rest is wide open. ;)
---
&gt; (for whatever reason, possibly your weapons weren‚Äôt breaking skin, possibly some glitch, possibly mistake on your part, possibly you didn‚Äôt rock up on time).
---
Or it was just a bug since the same exact shit happens to me sometimes even if I'm among the first ones there, do noticeable damage, and still‚Äìnothing... Meanwhile, on the other hand, I've shown up late, get a few shots in and still get drops.
---
Ok awesome. Would you be on tomorrow morning by chance? 6 to 11 am area?  Ill send you a message on xbox if this is your gamertag 
---
This. It's fair to assume the overall consensus is either "this game will always be trash" or "this game is going to be a slow burn" depending on who you ask. If the game will always be trash, then that's well and good, but it's not going to change, so go uninstall already. If the game is a slow burn, then the game will change eventually, but not as of right now (I stand by my opinion that nothing truly interesting will hit until May, at the soonest). If so, and you don't enjoy the atom/legendary grind, then uninstall. There is a world of games out there, go find one and enjoy it.   
---
And in due time, you might hear news about a big content update that you might be interested in, and come back then, having not spent *months* of your life haunting the sub like a Dickensian ghost wailing in torment about the poor choices you made in life.
---
Some turrets are just jerks.
---
This was a while back, but I had 2 of my 6 turrets become hostile towards me.
---
They were broken, but had a red hp bar, I repaired them and they started to shoot me...
---
I don‚Äôt know but it looks hella cool
---
My guess? They got relegated to random standalone mod offerings from vendors or random overworld plans.
---
Been looking for them myself with no luck.
---
I'm also wondering about missile launcher targeting computers and Broadsider multi shot canisters. I've scrapped so many and not gotten these mods, are they plan/standalone only?
---
Can you learn the BoS mods from scrapping?
---
I don't quite get the mechanics.
---
I totally agree! A few quick change loadout setup would remove a lot of time wasted on the pipboy, standing around like a dumbass target!
---
If you‚Äôve taken Rad-X recently it does suppress the mutation symptoms while it‚Äôs active. 
---
Right! I would love to have that car. I think. Ok maybe not. To bright
---
It's a bug, happens to me as well, mildly infuriating.
---
The hazmat doesn't unequip when you enter the power armor (in the sense it doesn't show it as unequipped). Your character goes in wearing it and it still shows as equipped in your inventory. I always thought it gave extra radiation resistance until recently when I forgot to put in in before getting in and I was taking the same amount of rad damage.
---
Oh well, we are all getting into power armors. Everybody get naked.....
---
I think I found marine legs there but I haven't checked back since then.
---
rip
---
The point is that you don't need to announce that you're going to quit playing *a game*. It's a game. It's a leisure activity. And this leisure activity has been out for two months.
---
Why are people on the sub if they quit the game? Quit is pretty final surely. If you don't log on much then the other option sounds a better fit.
---
You and me both, I pre ordered it. Played all the beta. Still play the game every now and then to see if it‚Äôs better. It still feels like I‚Äôm playing a fucking beta 
---
I earned about 1800 from playing alone, which I spent on the Vault-Tec Power Armor paint while it was on **"a sale"**. I bought the $40 Atom options shortly after the most recent patch hit because I read the patch notes implementing plan tags marking as known. I thought, maybe some appreciation is underway because they are listening, and I trusted there's no way anything could go wrong. I gave Reddit gold to that mod who keeps saying they'll *let the developers know about it* because I felt bad about the bullshit they had to deal with. 
---
I feel horrible for my purchase. Thanks.
---
I didn't spend any of the $40 ... I don't want spend it because there's nothing to buy. What could I buy? I don't believe there's a separate team for the shop. Three months and I think the only new Power Armor paint is the fugly Playtime Paints? Armor skins? Nonexistent. Shit, I could be wrong and there are plenty of paints, just hidden [for a limited time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9xRhwmHBBE).
---
Seriously, what new paints have been added since release? Just as I'm typing [a new skin comes up for a limited time](https://imgur.com/a/2qvNHye). The fuck is this horse shit? Limited time my ass, I ain't buying that when [stuff similar to this isn't in the Atom Store](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9278).
---
Guess I'll go back to [smelting aluminum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StZcUAPRRac). 
---
Three words: orbital strike beacon.
---
You can't really count that. They removed it, clearly knowing it wouldn't work
---
Do you... Do you want me to just put them on your armor for you? Are you PC?
---
Rad worms is messing with mutations. When you recover from rad worms it occasionally removes the jump height buff from marsupial.
---
same here for me in the excavator armor.I'm seeing the carry weight issue as well as a situation where sometimes after fast travel it's like I'm walking with cement shoes on. Sprinting works fine but normal walking is like half speed. If I hop out, let it recall to inventory and then take it out and get back in everything resets. 
---
5 words: *someone elses* orbital strike beacon.
---
Ah, never realised, thanks!
---
What a EPIC SCREENSHOT
---
The enclave underarmor plans still work. I picked up Protective and Shielded since the patch. They're in the Production section, not any of the other vendors.
---
I think that you think you're in the Anthem sub. We're talking about Fallout 76, a game that has been out for months.
---
still it seems sad they made a new perk/build and didnt put in any new guns for it
---
Target range in grafton has at least 10 bottles...think there are a bunch more.  Glass is everywhere though
---
When I saw you say "getting spammed by EEAAAHHHHH" I was dying lol Worst noise in the game 
---
Might be a certain blue police box around there.
---
She dead?
---
Because they‚Äôre like me, hoping to see good news that there is new content to the end game and things have been fixed. I quit playing and I‚Äôm on here everyday reading posts hoping to see some good news
---
Actually no, that's the reason I usually carry a few with me. Whitespring turreters and charlestone campers.
---
Quit no,  taken a break till there is something new to do,  yes.   Imagine my self flip flopping between fo76 and anthem. 
---
Well, if you do get Rimworld and enjoy it, Prison Architect is a good next step, as they have a very similar vibe (intentionally so). On further sim notes, I've been playing Jurassic World Evolution, but I definitely recommend a sale price on that, as the replay value is likely to be fairly low and the DLC design/pricing is ludicrous. If you haven't yet, Subnautica is good for exploration and relatively lite base building. And for something arcade-ish, I've been enjoying Enter the Gungeon.
---
That's fucking asinine, that shouldn't be a thing that happens.
---
Yea I feel this is why I find it hard to relate to the people constantly droning on with complaints about end game who have 300+ hrs nevermind just 100+ hrs of game play...  we're my partner and I are mostly weekend warriors and haven't experienced the vast majority of complaints ourselves because of it .
---
Lay off the day tripper!
---
They should let us equip a tin cup and walk around asking for change like a beggar. 
---
Cute? Fucking weirdo lmfaooo 
---
I‚Äôll show you any day of the week. 
---
The fast travel cost is one of the reasons mine is where it is, I can zip to 76 for free and make that side of the map cheap, or I can zip to my camp to make that side of the map cheap too. It's USUALLY not a problem, most of the time it's just super mutants shooting my damn crops to death, but man... Scorchbeasts are cunts.
---
It's so sad that this is a legitimate concern.
---
Damn! Most likely a visual bug but would love to have that at my C.A.M.P
---
I thought that one was found in a patch showing they they're probably planning on adding it.
---
I'll give you caps if you give me chems and a BJ.
---
I can give you three hundred buddy. :) 
---
I've been diving back in to random ass indie games I heard good things about but never fucked with, and playing racing games again. It's nice.
---
Nobody else was on the map nearby, I dunno wtf happened. :(
---
If you farm for legendaries so much, sell them on market. Anything with 2* or more, with decent effects, will net you more caps from other players than any vendor will. Or sell junk, ammo or aid to others.
---
Definitely. The lack of meaningfully organized end game content is seriously biting this game in the ass. It's missing all the steps something like WoW has, where you get gear to progressively get better gear to finally beat the final boss of the time-frame. 76 is instead "pound all the legendaries you can find because event rewards will be meaningless by the time you hit level 60, so there is only one means to advance, mindless grind."
---
Yep, same here. 
---
Well I had meant because I don‚Äôt want the bounty OR to be an asshole/waste beacons
---
Jesus christ, that's incredibly fucking stupid.
---
You can make 1200 caps every day with very little effort. Or you can just play the game and find plans here and there.
---
Of all the things wrong with the game, this is pretty low down the list.
---
Wow, really? Didn't expect someone to take me up on such a stretch. I'm actually in flatwoods right now, psn is Shadow_King153
---
Skyrims dragons are a cake walk compared to scorch beasts. 
---
sure, but then the next time you equip it, boom all the cells are loaded again.
---
Wow. That's less of an update than the current updates about Half Life 3.
---
Yo chill. They‚Äôre going to nerf it now. 
---
"on the fly build loadouts" was never the intention, they just wanted to make it easier for you to work with what little you get in the beginning of the game, and to make finding a right build easier, they never intended for you to swap in and out lockpick and hacker, otherwise those abilities would just be standard (might as well be at this point), and they certainly never intended for whole build loadouts to be hot swapped...
---
No, it's just ATOM shop stuff that was scheduled to release this week. Nothing's been added to the game.
---
You have crack?
---
Not disagreeing, but how is almost every location without interest? I'm of the opposite opinion, just curious on your take.
---
Dispensing justice does not make you an asshole. And it's not like beacons are super useful for anything else.
---
I‚Äôve unlocked one, I think it was a muzzle break.
---
Geezus. I am good at generating money but all I do is sell crap. You can sell Glowing Meat for 6 caps a pop. I went from 300 after a recent purchase to 1200 in 2 days without even thinking about it. 
---
 My present was a plan whore, created for the purpose and was a good one. Everything has value. Understanding the dealer networks and useful looting makes it quite easy to make moderate amounts, under 3000 say in a day or two.
---
I can honestly say I have never found a good legend from npcs, sorry that's a lie, I had an instigating assauktron blade that had more damage in power attacks. 
---
The best weapon I have us the all rise from the watoga quest. I've had hundreds of legendariea from farming and checked everyone just in case and they are all just... shit. Like ghoul skaters combat knives or chameleons wood armour etc maybe I'm just unlucky.
---
Lol whats a dubed "online survival" game for if you don't help other survive ? 
---
&gt; leather legendary
---
Except I was constantly finding leather armor with comparable or better stats than a lot of the supposedly "better" types of armor. A Heavy Leather set is like wearing a regular armor version of X01 PA but without the nuked zone rad protection of course. Also Wood with the Shrouded mod is objectively the hardest to detect sneak setup armor in the game that also comes with the sneaking move speed bonus. The real question is why is Marine armor even in the game? It's basically Combat armor but it's shittier in both looks and stats.
---
This so much. There are a number of ways they could sort better but really anything would help. Easiest would be a sensical naming convention: like
---
FOOD: Canned Dog Food  
---
FOOD: Deathclaw Steak  
---
HEALTH: Stimpak  
---
yeah we got her
---
Nope, and I won't until A) they fix the gamebreaking bugs present and expand more upon the game, and B) lower the prices down to something at least resembling reasonable
---
Didn't think of it like that ü§î
---
Haha ya man agreed. I was playing with my brothers last night and we were raiding the hornwright estate and this exact thought came too me. It should be in the game
---
How do you know it wasn‚Äôt intended? I feel like they have perk cards so u can collect it and swap it in and out whenever you wish. Else they can go with a skill tree no? 
---
I didn't even know there was a fruit bowl hat!
---
 My recent fav was a Mutants Wood Chest I took off a Gulper, and it went for 7 caps at Watoga Station. :)
---
Awesome shot, thanks for sharing :) 
---
Find somewhere in the middle of the map. It's cheaper to fast travel.
---
I got these Cramburgers man. 
---
why is the door entrance in the air?
---
Yes, I've seen it! It's a really strange place for a bronze face. Maybe something to do with the growth of that "tree"? Maybe the face was buried, and something "dug" it from the ground? 
---
No Man's Sky. At launch an awful game. One year in and it is a great game. Sometimes you need patience and perseverance.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
I have so many extra plans. Which one are you looking for? 
---
I trade A LOT, and never had this problem you're describing. But all my trades are agreed upon here or on discord. Only way I see this being a thing is if someone just approaches you with a trade out of the blue, in which case I just fuck the right off.
---
I am on Xbox I too would appreciate this secret spot. I am lvl 29 and just had a lvl 60 SB destroy my camp, the armour I was wearing and I was struggling to keep weapons repaired as it was
---
hot pink is the usual missing texture color so I would guess its intended.
---
Can you explain how, I honestly don't get it. It's specially hard when the different faction vendors sometimes choose to have 0 caps when I spend caps to go sell stuff to them. 
---
Maybe I'm just terrible at the sales thing, eitherway though the increase has still ruined it. I much preferred the fun of having a random chance to find stuff than having to farm caps for days to get 1 plan.
---
its so interesting of a idea and so just....
---
Just sent you an invite. Accept it. 
---
Pyre  -- just like Vader. Then a descendant can use the charred helmet remains in their fight against Bethesda.
---
Same here, I‚Äôm afraid once anthem drops I probably won‚Äôt be back. Because after anthem I have the division 2 coming out and 76 will probably end up like 99% of my stream library, never played
---
Yeah not like I've been a lead developer in the last year.  Oh wait I have.  Granted not gaming but practices and deployment are pretty much the same.
---
Just got one normal from dropping technical data off 
---
 Beautiful. :')
---
50/50? You have a far higher opinion of people than I do.
---
wait eso doesnt require psplus? i was for months without plus thinking i couldnt play eso
---
I didn't get one(?). Did you type the name right? It is caps sensetive I think
---
Would love a rooftop camp in that ash heap town by the tunnel. Or camp that fit in with the raider rooftop camp in Morgantown. Or being able to take over apartments, despite the pest problems they have.
---
There will always be autists in voice chat, MW2 taught me that. Just gotta find the right kind of voice chat autist enthusiast. 
---
No
---
"I want to kill other players and somebody did it better than me! Mom!"
---
I like the price too high or too low idea as well as the marking what's for sale. I've had many people request items I'm not selling and I've had a few people that I've offered really good deals that people just backed out of and wondered if the prices were too high. 
---
This has nothing to do with the Atom shop.
---
Right. You can't even sell nothing. But then again, it's pretty defeating to find out the item you got is not worth using.
---
Well it depends. I think damage its gattling but I hate the way you have to fire it so I went minigun. Wishing for a superb 50 cal though.
---
I'm settled in the middle of nowhere between bog and divide. Got view, water source, ample space and literally no one is ever there.
---
Gatling Gun, Minigun breaks too fast and does so little damage
---
They released it. That doesn't mean it was ready for release.
---
Far harbor is like 10x better than Harper's ferry. Yeah it is kind of similar with the dense fog but that's really the only main coincidence. Far harbor is also filled with npcs and great quests which I guess is something fallout 76 will never really have.
---
Been saying this and "re"perk ability like ESO so many caps or $5 to respect all your points. 
---
XB1, but thank you for your kindness. I'd like to have the mod tho, always finding better armor. 
---
Not a snowball's chance in hell. Bethesda's already setting up for a transition into a battle royal model, and that's just going to kill the game even faster: it's not what the fans want, and there are far better, established games in the market already.
---
Thank you. Bats have echolocation, not "radars", I don't think they are playing Call of Duty. And it's almost like even echolocation bounces off forest cover.
---
Do you blame them? 
---
How can it be ‚Äúperfectly preserved‚Äù if it still give you 1 rad?
---
lately ive noticed nuke zones to be completely dead..like im the only person there..which i find odd..but then sometimes whitesprings in a non blast zone is extremely crowded..before the nuke zones used to have the entire servers on there..this is something i noticed in the past couple of weeks..but i only fought SBQ once (last week) and the entire server was there
---
Some mods u can learn by scrapping, but it's random. 
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea. Do you have anywhere specific in mind?
---
Yeah, not sure what the pinkening does, mind control or something... not a big difference because most everything is hostile already, but it is cheeky lol.
---
It takes a special kind of shitty coding to crash a system your not even installed on.
---
If you are on Xbox I can give you some decent legendary items to sell at some point. I hardly play anymore and I know they will fetch a decent price, I'm just too lazy to list them for sale. 
---
Where do u get that
---
Im new and im a general of the enclave
---
I read it somewhere on here, and it has stuck with me ever since.
---
It would definitely be a great cap sink. Would help promote more trade for people who are max capped like myself so I can play around with different builds. Now I have to grind to get more respec points 
---
+%50 duration on rested buff!?!! Holy Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
---
We asked and Bethesda delivered! 
---
Also preordered it. Wasn't having too much with the beta or the game afterwards. Then it went on sale. Got it for my wife and we played together for a while. We stopped playing in December. Don't miss it in the slightest.
---
Yep. I did. I'm pretty sure I got a hit of your exact PSN 
---
People don't find TSE weapons all the time. Unless you count buying a duped one. 
---
Gatling. Best damage, good accuracy, low ammo consumption, cheap ammo, cheap repair, reload once a week.
---
It's just because it was wood. It seems what the item is made from fetches more than what the effects are worth. I've sold the same marine item with that 1* effect and it was something like 80. I think they need to work it out because I know a wooden sentinel piece would go for a ton of money on the market. 
---
Whitesprings is pretty good, pretty grass, flat land, tons of people nearby for trading, robot defense force, nukes, golf club xp grind, and the vendors at the resort.
---
No, if you die solo in a silo you have to start the launch process over, which isn't catastrophic but it's annoying as hell
---
I had this the other day. Had to go nuts on stimpacks and hop in my PA for the first time in ages. Thankfully they landed and I super sledged them
---
 There is 1400 across the dealer networks and that refreshes every 20 hours. 
---
 You can loot Whitespring for everything and take the 200 they have just from fucking vases. Now that is tedious. ;) 
---
 Everything has value, some surprising. A Ranger Outfit is a 250 cap item you can easily get 40 - 50 caps with appropriate perks. Farm Purified Water at your CAMP. I get 10 from my 2 large ones quite often. You get a feel for items and if you are frugal can take your fast travel prices from the crap at those places.
---
 The Charisma Deal perks make quite a difference to prices both ways.
---
mine is a tse combat shotgun, run the perks: 
---
master and expert shotgun lvl 3
---
tank killer lvl 3
---
supressor lvl 2
---
demolition lvl 5
---
gunsmith lvl 5
---
enforcer lvl 3
---
sandman lvl 2 (for bonus during sneaks)
---
bloody mess lvl 1
---
special is: 10/9/3/6/10/9/9
---
i could push dmg up a lil more with kicking in shotgunner, and full bloody mess. and so on. but just at that the shotgun does 260.
---
(saw ya online shoulda joined up with us)
---
Not a update.
---
Whoa...what if that was the goal of the game?
---
The Wasteland is now their customer base. 
---
Think about it. The Lone Wanderer has every reason to stick a gun in his mouth with every mission he makes. Depressing fucking stories. Finding fresh corpses and others zombie-ing out. 
---
And the player knows that this area just becomes a desert. 
---
Will never happen...it would be to easy to turn into an exploit 
---
Once at Red Rocket workshop, once by Grafton Steel and once in Flatwoods.
---
If you wait 60 secs after dying the monsters that are there leave.
---
It took a minute
---
That sounds pretty nice. I haven‚Äôt explored much down there because it is pretty dangerous but I am a higher level than I was before. I‚Äôd love to get a good look, thanks for the help
---
That is an outstanding pic, absolutely love it! Thanks for sharing :D 
---
\&gt;Whoever the fuck programmed scorchbeasts needs to be fucking fired
---
one of my biggest pet peeves. Only people who work in the game industry/programming field have the right to say this.
---
When I'm in next, I'll see if you're free to Team up. I'm on a full team tonight. Haven't seen these friends for a couple weeks online
---
How so? I see people who endlessly talk about this game (good and bad), yet also claim they've either quit for a certain amount of time or refuse to play it (on this sub).
---
Yup. I believe their is a few. Traded a mole miner gauntlet off to someone for one and it had a decent amount of mods. 
---
I thought this was a story with me and my friends, because we rekt someone's base. but he killed me once after we killed him 3 times.
---
You speak as if you don't have the 0 caps issue, am i the only one who is getting this? 
---
You can thank u/ladydevann for hearing our pleas and rushing to the devs to let them know.
---
Didn't realize these pop ups were a thing, and I've been playing since launch.
---
It just goes to show that no matter what Bethesda does somebody is going to bitch and moan about it. 
---
Can you implement a system that allows you to preview the clothing from the atom shop on your character before purchasing? Or the clothing have an option of clean or dirty after purchasing? I was highly dissatisfied with the Silver Shroud outfit that looks super clean in the atomic shop only to find out it's anything but....thanks
---
Have you had many people request a refund on ones which have been sold so far.  Also what happens with the copies that won't sell?
---
I've spent earned atoms in game, and was given a PSN card which i turned into atoms as well. I enjoy some of the signs in the store, and i've got a couple power armor paints, because those are the only things that seem worth it. 
---
I got the manta man outfit, but i really wish i could have gotten more. The prices are ridiculous for some of the items, and are reasonable for others. I just hope for more consistency.
---
Exacty. Eso has temple of stubborn or something spend gold get back your points but you still have to level up skills. For fallout means leveling for perk cards not points. The system now doesn't help the issue it makes it worse. 
---
Helpful comment is helpful! Love it.
---
[removed]
---
So you CANT get that instrument, huh. That's dumb, its my favorite.
---
I haven‚Äôt actually thought about Whitesprings before. I usually just go there for missions and nukes but you make it sound very welcoming with a lot of perks. Thanks a bunch for the help
---
You can get one in the Nuka World DLC, its a 100% guarentee.
---
More out by the targets.
---
I usually trade only specifically with redditors so if there's a misunderstanding I'm just communicating via the chat option here
---
That's the way it worked in FO4. You could be walking from Red Rocket back to Sanctuary,  hear the turrets open up, and then get that sweet sweet Cha-Ching of a kill and XP.  I was disappointed when I realized you had to tag an enemy a turret was shooting at to receive XP.
---
Honestly when theres that many projectiles passing through the wings, the damn things shouldn't even be able to fly. Wish they'd do that. Would make everything a whole lot less bullshit
---
 Yeah but take pleasure from selling ridiculous things to bots for fuck all. 
---
 The entire legendary thing has set me off and I just sell em' all. Some lucky guy will pick it up. The whining about their TSE guns being nerfed so they have to shoot stuff 3 or 4 times instated of once has made hate em' even more. I make my own crap. 
---
All vendors reset once a day at the same time, if a faction has 0 caps that means you already bought them out before the next reset. It is pretty simple.
---
The main thing is wait for them to land.  I was in on two lvl 80 SB kills tonight and a lvl 50 not much later.  I‚Äôm only lvl 40 with similar build.  
---
nice..where?
---
People were also wrongfully banned as well. There was a massive ban wave and people no longer play. The ones who did get to a high level within the rules that got banned are probably not wanting to have to start over from scratch , with nothing but a smile.
---
I'm pretty sure it was already under ground, and when the vines sprung up into the form of a tree, they carried it up just like the village. The general structure of the twisted vines and cave system all appear natural based on the apparent history of that place.
---
Far as I recall in the last 3 fallout games you've been able to shoot friendly npcs in every one of them ? I remember having quests get fucked up because of accidently killing important npcs or having them killed by other npcs.. Am I remembering things wrong?  
---
This feels like a non issue and part of them game. 
---
This B team is like a fucking Z'' team, if this game wasn't fallout it would be mistaken for some steam indie bullshit.
---
Someone in the market subs will sell it to u for less..just request it
---
It does but you also still wasted your screws because the LMG itself is worthless. 
---
They are nothing alike. Far harbor was a great DLC that took you to a completely unique area. It has its own weather, flora/fauna, characters and a legit story and back story that made you feel like you were there. 
---
By comparison 76 is well.....Garbage wrapped in trash thrown in a dumpster fire. 
---
No, I know the faction thing, but 50% of the time I will sell stuff to one faction, go to another and that will also be out of caps.
---
I assumed this was a common bug. 
---
Far Harbor was damn atmospheric.  One of my favorite DLCs of all time.
---
Ultracite has the best damage resistance, while X-01has the best energy resistance. Just in case you didn't know.
---
Protip: Not everything is for you. Let people enjoy things. 
---
Cool
---
It's not even that they are hard to kill or too challenging....when I have a pounding headache after fighting even a lower level SB and therefore hardly ever venture to cranberry bog (yay end game!) just to avoid them, it kind of ruins the entire thing for me....wtf were they thinking?
---
 LOL. A lot of the time that's a lie. Sell em' something and make sure they have no caps.
---
I bought FO76 at launch but haven't played it much. I keep lurking on this subreddit waiting to hear that the bugs are ironed out so i can give it another go, but I'm starting to wonder if that's ever going to happen or if the game is just going to quietly die...
---
If that's true I have wasted alot of caps fast traveling to sell nothing 
---
I absolutely agree, and would actually say expand it to all the rail stations along a single line:  so you could travel from R&amp;G up to Sunnytop for free, but Sunnytop to Morgantown would cost caps.
---
Limiting the free travel to a single station away will just force people to sit through a bunch of loading screens, hopping down the line.
---
And they already have something that would work perfectly for it:  the map-boards in train stations (I know there's one in Watoga, can't remember about all of them.)  You could just walk up to the, click on the station you want, and "Would you like to travel to *station*".
---
You could even color-code the pins on the map.  Green Line, Red Line, etc.  (does real life West Virginia do this with it's transit?  I know some cities do)
---
"I'll put my camp up near Grafton Station, take the Green line down to Lewisberg, and from there it's a cheap hop to R&amp;G to ride the Red Line into Watoga"
---
And the worst part? They tend to drop absolute garbage. Even when my TSE was dealing over 500 damage I still hated fighting them because a visual effect shouldn't be what makes them difficult. 
---
It might appear to be out, but it saying 0 caps is often a purely cosmetic bug.
---
God...fucking....dam..
---
Different developers. I feel that if Zenimax had made fo76 it wouldn't have needed PSplus.
---
OK perhaps that's the wrong wording. My point is how in 500+ hrs is that logical? How I see exactly the same stats on items everytime. Never seen any legendary hunting rifles. Very very rarely do I even get 3 star legendary items, and if I do, they are terrible. 
---
Aaaand now. Wait hold on, now. Give it a sec... now. 
---
Changing guns = pp

Changing Games = PP

Relax man, I can see the veins on you forehead bulging from here.

Yeah, paint jobs for PA is not gonna do it. They need really cool skins as well.

---
Do you? Every time I've died I just walk straight back to where I left off like nothing happened.
---
That does sound awesome.
---
I really wish we, the fans, could write in these fun and interesting additions, maybe even fix some bugs while we're at it.  If only such a thing were possible.
---
Ahh, when you said "max level of the enemy" I thought you meant of that enemy type.
---
I would go with ozymandias
---
So they gave you a completely Fair RNG with no pay-to-win options were loot box gambling and that's still too much of a gamble for you. I put in a lot of hours and still haven't found a two-shot explosive weapon but I found some other cool weapons that I have made work while I wait to find what I would ultimately like to have.
---
otherwise I'm pretty happy that the rare drops are actually rare that's something that you don't necessarily see a lot of these days.
---
Hey OP u mad bro?
---
It really, really feels like they have their "B" team working on this game. The magnitude and number of screw-ups is just staggering, I honestly don't believe it's the best the company can do. My guess is that they've basically written it off and are focusing their efforts on Starfield and TES VI, while trying to do the bare minimum to keep 76 from imploding. Well, more than it already has.
---
I honestly don't understand why they don't take the 5 minutes to program 1* legendaries always drop 1*, 2* drop 2* and 3* drop 3*. 2*s and 3*s are already really rare and with the giant loot tables, it's not like the game would be flooding the game with OP gear.
---
P.S. Please pick up that Wood Legendaries and sell them to vendors so Snipers can re-buy them. Wood is light as hell and you can consider it a public service, lol.
---
Because it‚Äôs Garbage. 
---
They are vacant, without story or depth. They look good, but there's nothing there, like a pretty, but stupid person.
---
Blackbird and Hotter Rod (to not be confused Hot Rodder) didn't exist in Fallout 4
---
Oh I have the linings... I just can‚Äôt get the actual under armor to put it on
---
Is it seeded or not?
---
a weak analogy could be how a single rose could cost you up to $10 but you can get a bottle of rose perfume for that much.
---
In exchange for being able to harm NPC's, accidentally or otherwise, you had the ability to reload a past save to mitigate all inconveniences.
---
Say you set a mine for an ambush and some random friendly stepped onto it first, you could screw up quest lines, faction reputation, aggro the entire area, you name it. In 76, you log out instead of reloading, which impacts the other players as opposed to just your own save file. That and reloading does not put you back into the same world in the event you were, let's say, shooting down a Scorch Beast circling the Whitesprings Resort when a Handy runs in front of your rifle and suddenly you've got two Sentries tearing you apart.
---
Also, none of the robots you can kill at Whitesprings yield XP or loot from my experience, meaning they're purely a time, health, and supply waster when accidentally aggro'd.
---
i will check this out tonight and get back to you.
---
do you have exact spot you saw it at :).?
---
was it a legendary rifle? maybe you need a better rifle..i go in there with a tse handmade and do ok.. a bobblehead and some chems may help too
---
Exactly! And it's probably not a coincidence that the red vines were "seeking" that area... Vault 94 will probably give us more hints about it... =] 
---
That is not the mire, that is Whitesprings in the Savage Divide
---
Oh really?  Well then don't bother fighting a scorch beast then. They drop NOTHING.  This game is so disorganized and disheveled at this point I don't see how they can straighten it out.  I stream this game everyday. I promote this game everyday. I am trying to keep my head up but Christ on a cracker. This new scrape all bulk bug is the worst.  Legendaries dropping nothing. 3 star legendaries dropping WOOD ARMOR?!??  Or just spinning for 5 mins while some asshat is duping the server or hacking.  Generally for most of us norms, Scorch beasts put up a pretty good fight.  Then to have them drop a lung, laser pistol, and 10 caps? Garbage.  Make them even harder to kill and have them drop decent Legendary gear.  
---
That describes most of the map. 
---
Scorchbeasts got the machine gun breath
---
How about community world stashes? A lot of times I have extra plans and ammo I don't want and I just find somewhere to put them, but they disappear too quickly. So, maybe community stashes for each region( the Forrest, Ash heap, ETC), but they have a cap. Also, maybe a limit for each player to grab. That, or a way to recycle them or scrap them?
---
Sadly I don‚Äôt. I took this yesterday and I ended up forgetting about it
---
Do yourself a favor and escape the flaming dumpster before it burns you of any more time.
---
Unless they use a chain and then you have to find another way around
---
bos recuring quest. tec data ..
---
You would also need a grilled pony recipe.   Mmmm pony steaks :)
---
Helpful and hilarious. Double karma for you.
---
Same here, I actually just started playing 4 again today and I can't believe how much nicer fallout 4 looks compared to 76 it had been so long I actually thought they were the same. The only thing 76 has going for it graphics wise is the lighting. 
---
Currently sitting on 5820 atoms. 
---
Have used 1800 for the Blackbird paint and 800 on the tuxedo set
---
Thats a total of 8420 all just from playing the game (\~300hrs) and doing the dailies/weeklies (when they work). 
---
I go in with a Two Shot Combat rifle and a lvl 45 TSE neither of them break and we do the Queen with 6 ppl in about 15 minutes. You must be using an automatic rifle or you are taking off your weapon perk card. 
---
Disagree, if you want I'll link you my couple month old post, I tracked nearly every legendary I got since beta, literally  over 40,000 pounds of weapons alone, and there are patterns that can be seen.  
---
Hell, I've been with people getting multiple (record of 6) TSE's per white springs 
---
They were also fun to kill, didn't spam fire for five minutes straight that blinded your screen, and dropped bones used to make end game armor. I WISH they copy pasted more of the dragons.
---
No and you will never be able to BULK them either!!!  Because.
---
Hm sounds like how it would be in real life.  It's like complaining that a bunch of civilians got in your way as you were trying to mow down the bad guys . 
---
In all seriousness though being able to attack friendly npcs has been a part of fallout for basically ever .  Just saying.  I mean sure it's inconvenient, but is it game breaking in the scheme of things? ( especially. This game). No not really. 
---
what does seeded mean.?.yeh iv played about 350 hrs and only got one tse drop..off a super mutant at the munitions factory   tse laser pistol. and that was at about 290hrs of playing.problem is you only get to fire about 20 rounds before it breaks..!!
---
You don‚Äôt need to keep them. If it says known that means you just picked up an extra recipe or plan. It‚Äôs safe to get rid of it or give away.
---
They spawn randomly like other events. Just gotta keep an eye on the map.
---
I do wish they would notify you, though 
---
This one is me! I love fallout, but I am not really getting much out of 76 right now. Maybe when they open up other areas and add new events!
---
Bethesda wants you to know that you are truly getting SCREWED.
---
It's a game dude it's not that serious lmao. There is nothing to "escape" from. Nobody is going to keep playing the GAME if they don't want too.
---
Worth mentioning that they see the data for uninstalls and inactive accounts. So taking a break and uninstalling both sends the point that there's something wrong, and gets you away from the game for a while. 
---
No it‚Äôs not. 
---
I hope it does. I‚Äôm going to go look on YouTube and see if anyone has posted anything on these. Maybe Oxhorn. I have seen him in a while
---
Or he just used the magazine that raises your lock picking one level
---
No, at this point i don't think they can make the game insanely profitable. The vast majority of sales and playtime for a game happen within the first couple months of release, just look at the steamcharts for Fallout 4, and we're well past that. At this point they're not going to get the playerbase to be able to make it "insanely profitable", even with overpriced microtransactions.
---
Same here just not as many hours, I have a little over a hundred I would estimate since I got the 76 achievement a bit ago. Best weapon I have is a level 35 only explosive double barrel and it is pretty damn strong even after the nerfs.
---
Interesting. This post was 22 hours ago but I was on a server about 2 hours ago and the same station had a TON of plans and recipes, and 200 scrap metal. I took a bit of the scrap, some of the plans, added some plans back to it, and dropped some bottled water in. I wonder if it was the same server. PC?
---
I kinda love the makeshift honor system bartering we have. 
---
Did you mod a different magazine?  Many change the capacity. Mine had an 85 capacity drum.
---
Yeah they get double screwed too because pistols are lower damage, auto pistols are even lower, and the game's damage resist system makes single shot damage SO much better than rapid fire damage.
---
Follow the road from whitesprings station south and it will be located between the road and the wgitesprings fence.
---
In group farming events I use a Tesla rifle. I only have 3 perception, so I load up rifleman 1, expert rifleman 1, tank killer 1, and tormentor 3 (luck).
---
... Multiplayer content. By which you mean the SBQ, because that's literally the only thing you can't easily solo.
---
I suspect the game model for 76 is going to be quite different. I think that it'll follow World of Warcraft's modern standards, where users return whenever new content is added, only to leave once they've done all of that content they care to do. And while 76 won't have the subscription income of WoW, I suspect that the servers and updates will continue for at least several years, because they're using it to try and grow an experienced crew for in-house online content, and to be honest, there's good odds that they can use the game's comparative failure for tax benefits. Add to that the income from Atoms (which is a thing, all the angry posts about it aside), and I am guessing that the game will never be the glittering star of the show, but will keep chugging sensibly along until they finish Fallout X (where X is whichever one actually includes both single player and multiplayer ala GTA-V or RDR2, and I hope like hell that when they do it comes out better than those shitshows). At that point, they'll either drop the game whole cloth, transfer value from old game to new through some means such as bonus currency, or release player run server options/single player patch and slowly turn off official support.
---
 Well if you take any vendors caps that reflects across the entire network. So Network hopping requires a good knowledge of the network. So once you clean out the Responders, the first Raider dealer is Sutton Station. There is a map online I think. Its kinda burned into mine.
---
According to this handy spreadsheet I found once upon a time there is only the muzzle break that can be found scrapping and the prime automatic on that is not found scrapping.

I been playing BotW on my switch. Mostly because my PS4 has been taken over by my wife since Kingdom Hearts came out.
---
you'd be fat before you finished exploring flatwoods
---
Just been using my handmade, it still had a 25 round mag
---
Stop bulking. It really doesn't save that much room and you are just wasting plastic. Only reason to bulk is to sell so do it then. Also if you know it will happen why keep doing it? The thing that annoys me is where it uses mods for crafting.  There is a fix but in the future so I have to remeber to worry about my mods till then.  But bulking is the least of my worries because I am always fixing or tweaking things so no reason to bulk cause it will get used or sold if I don't need it.
---
&gt;  I remember them advertising the game as an experiment, a different experience and expected players to break the game share feedback and build upon the original foundation to create the finished product. 
---
So... they sold it as an early access title without a label or any kind of indication on the actual product is what you're saying? Because you just described practically word for word what an early access title is.
---
Probably mentioned at some point, but I‚Äôd really like legendary traits to drop as mods. The levels of RNG to get what you want are too many...
---
E.g.
---
 -Kill legendary mob
---
- game rolls for presence/absence of loot
---
- if loot is present, game rolls for type of loot
---
- if necessary, game rolls for level of loot
---
 - if necessary, game rolls for condition of loot
---
 -...  legendary status of loot
---
-... traits for loot
---
At least if we got it as a mod, we could put it on something we want to use.
---
I put mine in overseer stashes or someplace another player is likely to find them. 
---
But desk fans give you screws and they‚Äôre EVERYWHERE. I sell excess bulk screws to vendors all the time 
---
That sucks, but thanks for the info.
---
I just finished playing and no...my handmade still holds the usual. Mines at 35. That sounds awful though 
---
This really. I don't see any reason to use any other mag. It's OP. (Yeah the weight blah blah.)
---
Would be a server nightmare to keep the cells updated as a vertibird definitely travels faster than a player.
---
That being said... Make it happen Bethesda.
---
Melee seriously needs to be nerfed .... it‚Äôs way op compared to what other builds can do ....
---
I think it's seeded, but I'm biased due to the fact I tracked my drops for months, first posting about it a couple months ago.

Thanks my man i will check it out this evening :)

Then you punch the chain off
---
Theres a quest you get everytime you pick up a "technical data" from a container. They're in random containers, but almost always in the desks in the military wing of the enclave bunker.
---
Great weapon to open with when still hidden. You'll have to level up those rifle perks, though.
---
Traveling between them has an x % chance based on luck or int or whatever of triggering an event. Player riding the tram gets dumped there until the obstruction is clear.
---
With the current game engine it may exactly be literally too much to ask of it.
---
 Yeah its changed. I used work the network and you could reliably get em' there. I did see Wallace with some though. I can make it all but I use BOS heavy Combat as its just the best. 
---
all seems reasonable to me, thats  the game i want to play
---
Is there a magazine for it?  I thought I saw something that added +1 to your lockpick skill and didn't really think much of it until now when someone had a 4.
---
You know one the the mags gives armor penetration and still has a 35 round mag right?
---
Yes
---
There is no friggin risk with melee ...your a running walking bomb .... just run up to the enemy and press the button and it‚Äôs dead .... move onto the next.... sick if hearing people‚Äôs shit about risk it‚Äôs bs. I just play melee now with my sniper build its way more effective.....to sign melee is way out of balance 
---
Ya I know, I got a badass maxed out camp in this spot and it literally takes minutes for it to spawn after I do?üòÖüòÇ
---
Currency hole.
---
It's a concept in successful MMOs for a reason, currency needs to be a finite (or at least not infinite) and necessary resource for it to have value. 
---
Both. I mean assaultron have a certain je ne sais quoi
---
I'll spend money on a game I want to get invested in wholly. After they fix the critical bugs and add more cool stuff to the shop, I'll buy some atoms. RN the rate than I earn atoms is enough to buy some stuff I want anyway so I don't need to buy more.
---
So, (true) story time. In the BoS asylum (i.e. Fort Defiance,) a month ago, I ran into an invincible level 35 glowing green ant on the second floor. I gained it's ire. It would not die. Sneak attack, VATs, no VATs, ballistic rifle, gauss rifle, my trusty Blade of Bastet, grenades of all types, 1k rounds of 5mm and a looted minigun, chem-fueled ineffectual punching, drunkenly stomping on it with power armor from the next floor up, and no small amount of swears later, the health bar would get to maybe 3/4 then heal right up. Immediately. Sometimes, it wouldn't take any damage at all. It followed me through elevators. Chased me up stairs. When I jumped to a location it couldn't follow, it paced fretfully, then? Always. Found. Me. The Hulk of ants. The Jason Voorhees of ants. This single level 35 glowing ant. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead. Which it did not, until I was. I was disconnected by server while on my way to nuke it from orbit; it was the only way to be sure. Looks like it survived. Now we know, for sure. The Interloper has chosen his form: not of moth, but of ant! Where is Leinengen? Deliver us.
---
Well there's your reason lol. 
---
I play on console 
---
Data mining says no to scrapping for BOS
---
This is on the Bethesda plz list.
---
Did you know that you actually can never sell nothing?
---
I finally won this game too. I'll never eat that precious pie.
---
 I'm looking for that. I used the big one for a while but although you eventually kill em', AP helps a lot with Muties and Beasts and all kinds of stuff like that. 
---
 I can reload my 20. ;)
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem. Thanks for asking friend. 
---
*your reason lol.
---
Am I the only one who feels like their job in the Wasteland is to turn off the radios people left on before they died?
---
Am I the only one who enjoys challenging enemies? Sure i have run from my share of scorchbeasts, i've killed some, died a lot too. But is there another enemy on any game where the outcome is in question?  I play Assassin's creed on nightmare mode, slaughter whole regiments in red dead redemption, only scorchbeasts do i go in not knowing who is going to win this time.
---
My favorite solution so far. Good thinking!
---
I apologize. I haven't bought anything from other players before and I don't know what to offer.
---
I can't say for sure but I can tell you that the one person who has made videos talking about that is not a reliable source of information and has all sorts of garbage videos that are as useless as any other.
---
As far as being seeded from all of my gameplay I definitely have not noticed any anomalies that would point to that. It's possible but the game is the game and nobody needs that one perfect weapon to build a very specific overpowered build that gets boring.
---
So probly Assasin, Cavalier then with ap refresh (powered). No magic, just good rolls.
---
It does remember the VATs target, whether you're manually activating VATs or using Gun-Fu. It's glorious.
---
Noticed this too.  Maybe they‚Äôre chinese loot farmers getting ready to take over this game.
---
But I didn't change anything. I don't even have magazine mods for the handmade. As I stated, this started because I couldn't reload when I still had over 20 rounds in the magazine.
---
So, IDKWTF. Maybe I've joined the ranks of those people who permanently can't die or make camps or whatever. 
---
A luck-based event that triggers every so often would balance out the lack of caps being paid. I imagine a "repair bridge x before you can proceed" kinda deal.
---
Fast travel to other destinations would still require caps.
---
Simple answer is no. 
---
The engine is designed for more powerful hardware. You might need to look at getting an upgrade.
---
They won't downgrade their engine etc. For older kit. 
---
Even worse is when it's a 3 star and all you get is a coolant cap. Thanks Bethesda you're so generous... 
---
Real life pies give you rads[?]
---
Reminder: World of Warcraft had an absolute shitshow of a launch, and No Man's Sky is now regarded as a fairly good game. 
---
A bad launch is not the death of a game so long as the game continues to get effort invested in it. Having told us repeatedly that 76 was an experiment intended to last for years, I suspect it'll at least hang around long enough to be a better game. I just think it'll happen slowly. Like, first real content no sooner than May, at best. This will almost certainly be a game people return to as opposed to playing indefinitely, if it survives.
---
Since launch I‚Äôve only ever been able to play &lt; 10 hrs a week. 
---
 No you fool, that's the big AP mag. ;)
---
In fo4 it took multiple ranks to get screws from scrapper perk, and more still to get nuclear materials.  
---
Make it so in fo76
---
One time a buddy and I were headimg to the station over by White Spring and 3 attacked us nonstop for 8 or so minutes and then the server crashed, they were constantly attacking and we were getting hurt everywhere.
---
My normal non legendary hunter rifle unpeeled kills level 68 super mutant in 3 shots, my TSE gatling gun kills one in 15 shots.
---
They didnt fix an Over powered legendary effect they made 2 absolutely useless to make duped weapons useless.  They broke them because their broken game allowed duping.
---
At least call it like it is.
---
P.S. I see what you did there. Literal Bug is literally a bug. Comedy gold. If it wasn't intentional, let's say it is anyway.
---
What proof do you have of these people actually looting all these weapons? You can link me videos of that and it sounds like exactly what OP wants to see as well.
---
It's already there. It is called the cannibalism perk.
---
Seconded! Constructive, force multiplier. Excellent.
---
You mean skyrim dragons?

---
FUN DETECTED!!!

---

---
In their current form, perks are a complete unmitegated time-suck / not fun / screwed up interface.   On PC there is the perk manager mod that makes perks usable and useful.  At a MINIMUM FO76 needs to have an integrated perk manager.
---
I strongly urge Bethesda to not ONLY implement a perk manager, but make all of the perks passive that make sense to do so.   Passive = I should only need to own the card for it to count.   Passive cards could have a nice bright symbol added to them meaning they can't and don't have to be added.   Passive cards could be the reward higher level players get as they continue to level up.  
---
Early in the game you get your cards, just as you do now, as you level up.  Later in the game when you've unlocked all the cards, NOW the packs each level contain passive versions of SOME of the cards that you've gotten earlier.  The passive versions don't take up points or slots and they are active just simply for owning them.    
---
Candidates for passive cards: Lock Picking, Hacking, Barter Discount, SOME of the carry weight ones (not all), SOME of the thirst/hunger/endurance based ones (not all), any other card that is considered purely situational where you don't spend much time "doing that".   (Another example: the one that slows down thirst / hunger when you are at a base or workshop).
---
The idea is that these cards could be ones that you trade out on your character until level 76.  Once you hit level 76 you should get your first passive card and for every 5 or 10 levels after that you can earn additional passive cards that take the place of some of the lesser cards you had to work with early in the game.   This rewards long time players, this lets players who have made it to the "end" get a reward for continuing.  It also frees up some points that can be used to experiment with other card loadouts.  
---
One of the problems FO76 is plagued with is how late in the game you are fairly locked into a BUNCH of cards that are pretty much mandatory to play with otherwise you can't carry enough and you can't do enough damage of your chosen damage type.   Freeing up some points late in the game by letting some of the situational cards become passive / all the time active takes care of all of this.
---

Now on the Atom Store for 2000 atom!
---
Oh you mean their stagger-and-cripple rounds? Fun times.
---
I know their intentions because they said as much at E3, and no shit it could be a skill tree, that's what most of their other games had, but they chose not to because they wanted you to be able to experiment easier, plus the lack of cards in the beginning means you will end up using stuff that isn't part of the build you have in mind because you have to use what you have until you get all the cards for your build, so it's obvious that for that reason alone they needed a flexible system, but I assure you it wasn't meant for swapping in and out builds on the fly, otherwise there would be a framwork for you to store and hot swap builds...
---
Ahh. You have to know what your paying for! Tell you what, 1200 caps and the items needed to do so, and I'll put them on for you.

Thanks - you are actually one of the inspirations for my post. The point being I'm at the end of my tether - and I will hold out for more things / Bethesda fixing things. 
---
However if proved true, I will not play anymore. There's no point.
---
Refractor for reducing energy damage.  
---
Not a single one of these games invited the players to participate in the design and balancing of the game before it was closed off for good either. 
---
Maybe you‚Äôre one of the player for whom this goes whoosh over their heads, or get it but don‚Äôt care. 
---
Maybe you value it. 
---
Some of us value it. 
---
And some of us even understand what compromises Bethesda had to do (ship early) to offer us this. 
---
Why would they? Pretty much everyone who is going to buy the game already has, regardless of whether they fix it or not. It's not in their financial best interests to sink a bunch of resources into it.
---
But I agree, i really get the feeling it's their B team working on it. I choose to believe Bethesda is capable of better.
---
It's very popular now; but near the Top of the world there is a junk pile outside the train station, with water slightly close by.
---
Kind of flat.
---
I am fat now 
---
Use the link tool and link it with imgur
---
The ones at the ammo factory are 3 levels higher and can actually punch holes in tanky enemies.
---
Too bad it takea forever to lock on target and has zero DT.
---
Forgotten to install spotlights, have we?
---
YES 
---
and do what, exactly? how do you even know who's duping?
---
Funny, that place is actually the reason I posted. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a good flat spot and I have been going there every session just to see someone else‚Äôs camp.
---
Wait, does it? Why not the tail up?
---
I can‚Äôt play much; as he game CTD randomly a lot. Sometimes even taking my GPU driver with it.
---
I found a fix of disabling g-sync; and closing everything that‚Äôs not the game. Especially the Bethesda launcher that uses hardware acceleration which can‚Äôt be disabled ( it also captures priority sometimes and causes gsync to lower the refresh rate to 25 lol )
---
Even then, I get random CTDs still. 
---
Just not worth it. Since when do I have to essentially disabled major performance features; close all programs, and nearly unplug extra monitor to try and get a somewhat stable game.
---
Now I gotta admit, in parts..you can see the arts folks that crafted the world cared. Fallout 4 with mods; doesn‚Äôt look as nice as an open world as 76 does for me. Although in all other graphics areas my mods win. Can‚Äôt believe 76 still downs that‚Äôs dynamic shadows that match the enhanced lighting &amp; FX + Pip boy flashlight with dynamic shadows mod.
---
I only got 76 for ‚Ç¨10; but it doesn‚Äôt feel with it sadly. So many issues; never mind the server lag. In games like wow I have an MS of 10-14 in massive raids. While in 76 I empty 6 revolver rounds into a protection and have nothing happen; only for them to zoom at me and then explode as the damage registers very late. Or in some cases, not at all. 
---
Download your phone images to your computer.
---
Make a new post and near the title of the post is tabs.
---
Middle one lets you drag and drop the photo off your computer to pst here.
---
Or upload to a website and copy the url.
---
*Seeded* means that your character is born/created with a built-in luck rating that determines the probability of the quality of the dropped loot.
---
I looked across 10 servers yesterday. It‚Äôs gone since the last patch. Grrr....
---
It's the preferred mechanic to kill other players without a bounty. Hardly worth it to defend the workshops any more.
---
Tired of that 3‚≠êÔ∏è enemy dropping a flare gun? Me too...
---
But their engine is the same from Fallout 4, that game would run 60fps all the time, except for the unoptimized buildings
---
Per world population won‚Äôt vary based on how many people are playing the game. 
---
The number of worlds isn‚Äôt fixed. They‚Äôll be dynamic instances spun up on a cloud provider to match load, and spun down when there isn‚Äôt load. 
---
The number of players per world won‚Äôt vary. 
---
That‚Äôs how any backend is designed in 2019. Otherwise it costs you a shit ton more. 
---
If I remember well you have to kill legendary foes 
---
It just happened to me again on PC after playing for awhile (not first time use after just logging into a server) and ONLY when selecting food/drink items from Aid tab and now at random intermittent times, it used to just freeze when first entering the server.
---
It's probably the hyperbolic descriptions. The game has severe problems, and I agree that they fucked up, but if I can read a post in the nasal accent of Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons and get my wife to laugh, it's probably a bit much. Say it with me:
---
&gt;Worst. Game. Ever.
---
I own Trespasser and the original South Park FPS game. I have tried to play Daikatana on a dare, and finished Aliens: Colonial Marines against my will (also blamable on the Daikatana friend). I agree that 76 is a hot mess and is not great, but anyone saying that the game is complete shit and the worst game ever is (to engage a little hyperbole myself) a whiner who has never truly experienced the horrors of the very dregs of gaming history.
---
Mind you, the hyperbole does not invalidate their opinion when it comes to why they dislike it. It just turns posts from possibly interesting to obnoxious.
---
Send it to your email, make an imgur account, send us link to imgur post
---
My old favorite spot was.
---
Open your map, near the middle is a black flower icon.
---
Walk there in the game.
---
Trust me. It's purtty.
---
That's what a ~~Synth~~ Duper would say.
---
r/fobazaar
---
When in doubt, alt f4
---
I have to make the armor. :) How much would be fair for the plan?
---
Nope. I'd settle for just decently stable at this point.
---
I've had this happen before. It's why I won't capture certain workshops as they have a chance to defend against 1-3 scorchbeasts.
---
That was my recent camp! With the little lake and tucked away cozy cave!
---
I just saw my original offer--it should have been 10000. Is that closer to the ballpark?
---
Aw man I'm such a fan (of the game play) that I have faith that they will fix it. I keep getting burned though, which is why I'm coming towards then end of my tether.
---
And thank them for supplying everyone for reasonably priced god roll weapons?
---
It's a nice spot I found it early in my adventures and stuck there for a long time.
---
But now I cannot log in without.
---
"Your camp cannot be placed.
---
Can you explain?
---
I've put it on Instagram for now. Taken me hours to build it. I'll do my best to try the email way. Just putting a garage door in 3 levels up 
---
Bloodied TSE doesn‚Äôt exist to my knowledge. Bloodied explosive, sure. 
---
Yup. Had the same when I put my camp on a small cove by the the sons of dane.
---
Bloodied and two shots don't go together.
---
That plan was more expensive before the change IIRC. I think it was 12k caps.
---
Yup. Been there since beta. Ate my +1 Endurance chest piece I got from some quest early in my play through. Pretty much lost interest in the game after that.
---
That was a gigantic waste of time and bullets. 
---
At least I got to kill my first SB alone!
---
Changing the level of weapons and armors by using end game materials like fluxes. It makes me real sad to see a perfectly rolled weapon or armor with such a low level.
---
Usually fighting the random spawn beast in the middle. I did find him once in the pool. Lol.
---
Besides interacting with things through a window, I tend to get into impenetrable camps when I load in and they built their camp where mine is.   So I go stand where I think is best, and if I'm lucky I pop inside of their locked building.
---
I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one that gets a kick out of messing with other players in a gentle way.   I've ended up inside of some pretty nice / impenetrable builds this way and I usually leave a sack of fertilizer behind and I take any food / water / extractor inventory that isn't locked.   I figure it will all come back anyway, and it is my attempt at a calling card.
---
If I could light the paper bags of fertilizer on fire and leave them there, that would be even better.
---
On the other hand there have been other camps I've visited where their stuff is broken, so I try to fix it for them.  The last camp that was like that also had a junk extractor so I took their junk when I was done.  ;)   Because life is confusing like that.   (Actually, I was hoping they would show up because I was going to offer to replace their small generators with a fusion generator and free up some build budget for them.  It looked like they had maxed their budget on turrets to defend the place. They never showed up though in the time I was on / around the area.)  
---
We‚Äôve got to be the rulers of you all
---
Haha I could see that my power armour was floating around due to the radiation signal I was tracking was constantly changing. I didn't know if the game had thought I'd abandoned it. I was willing to swim around and try and find it if force quitting meant I was gonna lose it :)
---
I was trying to wrap up a couple nights ago and sell some stuff when a scorchbeast spawned above me at the freaking SUTTON station. So many scorched started swarming. Literally after multiple waves, 10+ were running into the station. I just powered off my PS4 and called it a night. What the heck happened to them since the patch?!
---
i would be fine if they nerfed JUST TSE weapons but what they did was nerf ALL TS and E weapons i have a E harpoon gun and gatling gun and a TS handmade and im just stashing them now cause they hit like nerf dart guns never seen a TSE myself after 100+ lvls but cause of one legendary combo that asshats duped to silly amounts my former best guns are utter shit now, add in the fact it seems every so called patch undoes half of the fixes the previous one did it make me just not want to play anymore. i loved the game for the most part but now its just not worth the time to even fire up the launcher anymore
---
Skyrim ran fine on my old computer, and Fallout 4 was unplayable. Every time they tweak the engine, they push it further, and that requires more processing power.
---
proud of you OP
---
I sure do miss Morgantown. 
---
Oh nice, i lost my power armor b/c i had two &amp; i guess if you already have one on you, the game things you were trying to get rid of it. Luckily, it wasn‚Äôt my excavator but just  some random pieces.
---
I had that happen, for the fucking Red Rocket Mega Stop... buuuuuullllllsssssshhhhhhiiiit.
---
I saw that shit through to the end, but it was annoying as hell. 
---
I just found 1 as a random world drop. It was sitting on a desk in Harper‚Äôs Ferry.
---
By your own logic if people's complaints are bothering you and you're not enjoying reddit you are allowed to take a break from it. You are even allowed to use another forum.  Most of the complaints I've seen on here are valid if repetitive but no more repetitive than people like you complaining about their complaints.  And now I'm complaining about your complaining about other people's complaining about the game... damn it.
---
Second. It's my wife's account.
---
Sorry. 
---
Then I would like to get the bloodied explosive lol. 
---
Get ready to die of water toxicity. 
---
I bulk to sell. And I don't keep doing it. I just discovered tonight what was causing my bulk goods to disappear. Also,  I didn't post this for anyone's opinion. I posted it here because the brilliant minds at Bethesda requested it.
---
There‚Äôs a cliff I live on that‚Äôs pretty good in size and very flat. Not a lot of dirt so a little hard to place a purifier. But it‚Äôs just west of the New Appalachian Central Trainyard and south/southeast of Cliffwatch. It faces Summersville and is very private other than scorched from Cliffwatch every now and then.
---
Any updates on this I‚Äôve had it for hours and can‚Äôt find anything about it online 
---
PonyFallout https://imgur.com/gallery/pdhZMdp
---
Oh, and Bob Newhart called, he wants his advice back. Thanks.
---
Cryolator long barrel.  Give it a shot.  It shuts them up in my experience.
---
Of all the horror stories knocking around thankfully the worst I've lost is only a gas mask to the mamma dolce event.
---
Hope that works. Plenty more to do. Will post updates in a few minutes :)
---
Haven't played this game in a long time, they still spam their screach attack? That's hilariously rediculous.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be as bad if people felt they are responsible for aiming and hitting unintended targets, and the downside of using AoE weapons would be that you hit more than just your one target with AlE weapons. 
---
It‚Äôs a nice suggestion, the lobby that cares about it most is the Explosive Shotgun cabal. 
---
Thanks for the suggestions! I've got Enter the Gungeon and really dig its humor and style but I totally suck at it, lol. I've never made it past the first few levels. I'll install it again and try again :p
---
This is me. 
---
I have Ultracite helm and torso plans. Can trade for both bosbos paint plans
---
My mom plays fo76?
---
Sorry, I meant head and torso mod plans, my bad
---
Heavy combat legs at Harpers. Not other pieces
---
You also can complete Enclave events. The ones I did were the ones where you fix the beacons to draw in enemies and then repair them as needed for about 4 minutes and kill the enemies drawn in. I can‚Äôt think of the name of the event, sorry.
---
Yeah Polar is my other inspiration. Entertaining at best? He comes across as a bit of an uneducated person however he puts forward some logical arguments.  r/Aten_ra did a better job imo.
---
The point being is what these guys are presenting, and combined with mine and others experiences, lead me to this post.
---
I created an alt to get the Handmade plans in the past - I could not believe all the awesome drops I was getting on that char (lvl  18). I also got my first explosive weapon on it, then another (non TSE mind you). This is does not make sense when I honestly have seen 3 - THREE - explosive weapons on my main char who is now lvl 254. Never seen TSE. Always 1-star furious/executioner etc. 
---
Thanks I posted it. Think it's in a reply to someone in this thread 
---
I remember when the first gameplay trailers came out, there was this bit where one swoops down, takes a second to gather itself, and sends out a single blast that blew half a base away.
---
I was like ‚Äúdamn, those‚Äôll be epic‚Äù
---
Nope! ‚ÄúWEEEAA WEEEAA WEEAA thump thump thump‚Äù while I fire blindly into energy blasts directly above me. They go immediately from massive threat to damn annoying bats with no actual fun battles in between.  
---
It doesn‚Äôt help that most of the fissure sights seem to be located right next door to interesting spots (looking at you pumpkin house)
---
Thanks! I loved Binding of Isaac; just checked and I was shocked to see I have 500 hours on it. I've also got Darkest Dungeon, about 85 hours into it but I got tired of the grind of constantly leveling up new recruits. I'll give the others a shot though!
---
I‚Äôm recovering from a back injury I‚Äôve had plenty of time to play 76 along with a couple others, now I‚Äôm helping my buddies who just got the game kinda brings me life tonit
---
Bra r√•d
---
Luckily I am camel 
---
100% agreed, here lately getting them on the ground to even hit with with a fat man or with anything is a rarity in the first place. In the last 2 weeks I haven't ran into just one. No they run in fucking packs and its fucking bullshit, especially when your running solo 
---
What would be a better choice? All I have drawn are lone wanderer level 2 so I‚Äôve got 2 charisma points. Happy camper  hard bargain and rad sponge. 
---
I‚Äôm not good at character building and it shows at lvl 62 and still have to shoot most things 10 times to kill it. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt help that apparently if you‚Äôre the only one nearby they‚Äôll slowly migrate over to you until they spot you
---
The world map is weird, but it's fallout so that's expected.
---
Shout out to the "monorail". I was really hoping one of the devs would make a joke about it being broken down at all times. 
---
You can try market76 reddit, you'll have a much higher chance of finding what you want there.
---
I love how I got downvoted for this. 
---
You don‚Äôt have a choice. 
---
You **cannot** equip the lone wanderer card with one charisma point. 
---
This was awful pre-spawn patch. 
---
Piss off one mister gardener and get mobbed by 80 of them + some sentry bots.
---
Blackbird PA paint. Whoops.
---
And when you finally kill then, they drop shit loot. 
---
Did you leave my decon shower on? I came back to a flooded base.
---
Jerk.
---
Harper's and Watoga have the exact same plans now.
---
This. I never knew I needed this until now. 
---
I actually had a lot of fun doing pvp for the first time earlier today.
---
There was about 5 of us messing around with the ghouls at WhiteSpring.  I had taken off pacifist (which I almost never do) earlier just because I figured pvp was the only content left.
---
One thing led to another and it was a 5 man free for all.  And none of it was the instant-death from pre-nerfs.  It was actual fighting and I had fun.
---
Your evidence for BR model?
---
Bethesda should do this pretty much exactly the same way the mod did it, if a modder can do it they should be able to.
---
Nah. I do that same.
---
At lvl 4 lock picks only weigh .1lb each.
---
You make a great point, that was another thing skyrim had to a degree but then they kind of backtracked on it
---
Damn! You had me excited that there was something I had not found.
---
Hey kid, cut north to the strip, it's way faster.
---
Anthem is coming out this month, if you are into this. 
---
Ok. Will check there. Deleting post. Thanks all
---
While I don‚Äôt disagree with your statement, there are a lot of people that like Fallout and spending time in that universe. The Fallout universe is a very unique one. So I can see why some people play 76 even though they aren‚Äôt happy with the game. I myself have resorted to going back to other Fallout games. I‚Äôm currently playing NV and once I get through with that I‚Äôll be doing another Fallout 4 play through
---
In the same ay that no one posting a glitch should fail to post their system, and their mods, no one should moan about content or end game activity without their level and hours played posted.
---
It's interesting to read this, especially after Skillup kind of pointed this all out and got shit for it.
---
Hope it gets better for you guys.
---
I use the dragon in a crit heavy build. Means you get the most out of it each time you start a fight. I keep the dragon loaded and usually have a banked crit ready for when something needs to die quickly. 
---
Crits, concentrated fire and extra limb damage makes for some fun times; and making collecting player bounties very easy.
---
**First**  
---
It's completely unrealistic to expect even a single person, let alone 4 people to be recording every play session, I mean FFS we used to do A single WhiteSprings for upwards of 4 or 5 hours.  (Yes you can, if you don't know how Google It).  
---
**Second**  
---
 If you check out the posts I was bemoaning my lack of drops and generally crap RNG in general,'while I watched people who consistently had an above. When the trend starting showing patterns I thought I could see. Then started tracking my 2+ drops via a spreadsheet. I still have yet to see a single TSE on my main account, in 320 levels and an almost shameful amount of hours played.  So I've got that data to show.
---
**Third**  
---
Until The end of December (playing since beta) I had kept every drop I had gotten on mules, every single one, and I can link some pics of the patterns showing up with the Right/Left side limb patterns (in some cases 12 to 1 drop rates on specific side, for specific Legendaries. The drops being stored were my initial data points for the "Seeded" Theory.   I've got some pictures of that, but those only shows the patterns in the legendary Prefixes I was looting.   
---
**Forth**  
---
A number of other people have put up similar posts, seeing patterns where they looted consistent clusters of items over and over on a specific server, then when they hopped to launch more nukes they saw a similar, but with a different legendary prefix, pattern.  
---
**Fifth and last**  
---
I also did some controlled tests with vendor hopping (when that was a thing) and treasure maps to show the patterns as well, but again, who is going to record an entire 8 hours of checking the Watago vendor? 
---
 **TL:DR**
---
I can't show you a video of back to back TSE's because I've not gotten a single one, but I have been with people who have looted multiples,'including enough vanilla two-shot weapons they started dropping them for others.    
---
Likely no one is going to be able to show that, because generally people don't twitch their game sessions, usually that's people trying to make money/brand or are narcissists.  
---
I can show you some screenshots, and the results of my data, and that's about it, because if you **actually think of the work involved of tracking 4 peoples legendary drops over a 3 - 5 hour period you'll realize that alone was a stupidly insane amount of work**.. And I've not been able to talk anyone else into doing it again (hell I don't want to, mainly because the twice nerfed WhiteSprings is not fun anymore).  
---
Ironically several/all of these unusually lucky guys quit '76, not because of the nerfs, or bugs, but because it was boring as hell after they had looted nearly everything they ever wanted in just a few weeks of grinding WhiteSprings.  
---
I need to get the mistress of mystery weapons again that‚Äôs probably the only reason I‚Äôd start again other than that I‚Äôm more focused on helping strangers and getting my platinum trophy 
---
If you shoot things 10 times to kill them you‚Äôre objectively not good at (combat-focused) character building. 
---
How many of the following apply to over half the shots your character fires? 
---
X1.6 weapon damage perk 
---
x1.15  bloody mess 
---
x1.05 to x1.07 tenderizer 
---
x1.6 glow sight 
---
x1.5 adrenal reaction 
---
x1.9 weapon legendary 
---
x1.2 nerd rage 
---
x1.2 gun-fu / x1.2 concentrated fire 
---
x1.15-x1.25 chem 
---
x1.6 adrenaline 
---
? 
---
They stack multiplicatively. 
---
It‚Äôs an RPG, not an action FPS. That means you have to use the right perks (and figure out how qualify for them, and how to mitigate their downsides), not that ‚Äúlevel1 does 1 damage and level 78 does 78 damage, level oodles does oodles damage‚Äù.
---
Hey at least you have lots of things to look forward to. Anthem has its own worries but it might scratch your explore/loot itch. And I think in the future Cyberpunk 2077 should have multiplayer too? 
---
Xbox ?
---
There are 2 versions of cups. Single cups without straw always scrapped for cloth, if it has straw it scraps for plastic. 
---
Ps4 I should edit the post to say that. 
---
I find nothing more frustrating when very nearly clearing out an area and then suddenly they respawn and at higher levels thanks to another vault dweller showing up. It‚Äôs like, thanks man, super helpful.
---
Try the train carriages both East and west of the Watoga station - I just found some in the carriages to the east towards the flooded train yard.
---
FOR SCIENCE!
---
I wasn't even thinking about the limited engine, but I completely agree, its just not a good engine for looter shooters. Even just the current fluidity of player movement and aiming of the creation engine is severely lacking, another thing bad for shooters. I'll never forget when I played CoD excessively prior to getting New Vegas and being jarred by how much worse I was at shooting. Not to bash on NV, which is like my favorite game of all time 
---
&lt;harmonizes&gt; To be fair...
---
I know that. I would assume if it got nerfed any or all magazine mods would of been affected as well. 
---
&gt; I‚Äôm worried the game is going to be dead soon. 
---
Says everyone about every game ever.
---
This is why I am happy that I'm immune to Scorchbeasts... They can only do damage to me with melee attacks.
---
TSE needed to be nerfed.
---
Why?  
---
Just because it's seeded doesn't mean you won't get "good loot", it just means you likely won't get exactly what you want.   
---
I've gotten complete crap for weapons, I mean hot garbage more or less, or so I thought until the Meta changed to "bloodied", then the 20 2*+ legendary weapons I had became gold and I traded well.  
---
Also seem to have a knack of looting Sentinel gear, rarely assassin's, but who doesn't want a Weightless, AP regen Sentinel piece of marine or combat armor? (I've looted 4 of that combo)
---
Level and hours played?
---
I wish we had cross platform play. 
---
My only problem with dying in workshop defense is losing caps beyond the ones I already paid to claim it.
---
Congrats on the SB kill.  Hope you got some good loot.  Consider trading any prime receiver plans if you got them, people are still overpaying for them for some reason üòâ
---
rad world degrading your liver making Jordan shiver since 2076
---
Best part of this thread
---
/naaaa.
---
The only blueprint is the one I created of the basic 3x3 structure and I've tried deleting that with no change. The stored tab had only 2 pieces of razorgrain until I trashed those. I wanted to throw down a fertiliser thing but since it includes the brahmin that makes it use far more budget than you'd expect. I don't have the budget for a cow.. 
---
Anyone else pop on here just to see how many "yes" answers there were? Don't get me wrong, I actually like 76, but the prices seem more than a little high to me in the shop, and with all the negative press, was curious what percentage said "yes".
---
It's just unfortunate that when rad worms is cured, all the mutations stop working until you log lol 
---
I think if your budget is full it won't take budget at all, I had a Mirelurk King but my budget was 100% full, he disappeared but my gf was at my camp once and told me he was gone and my front door open with the door to my generators damaged.  I was in a spot before the overseer's camp so I think a player killed him.

Did you check your antivirus ? Sometimes AV will flag online games and remove them. I might be wrong, but with MMO games it's not uncommon. 
---
Um sir im definitely reporting that to bethesda can u stop hacking the gameüòÇüòÇ
---
I had a level 30 Mirelurk King when I was only around level 40.
---
I got mine from doing the leader of the pack event hope that‚Äôs helpful 
---
&gt;there‚Äôs no variety everyone plays the same game.
---
What game is it we're all playing?  I've got two characters, both completely different.  
---
I usually go for a leg on the Sentry Bots, to keep them from suicide-charging me.
---
I got a little known spot.in the south with a lead deposit I've claimed ;)
---
Yeah they don't run they die
---
??  This hasnt happened to me.  
---
because they don't think about VATS crits
---
Heh, I do this too, I just open every interior door I can find, and/or exactly half of the window shutters.
---
PVP shouldn‚Äôt have been included in this game at all**, FTFY
---
Southern end, west of Johnson's Acre will be a flat area with a shallow enough lake to build in
---
I had a Mirelurk King with only Animal Friend so I think it depends on what you're trying to tame, haven't found anything tameable since then though, and I have both cards at rank 3.
---
Nice pic!!
---
Why did you write "Blizzard" there?
---
Sure just let me find a pitchfork and civil war era suit and we can start accusing people of witchcraft I mean duping 
---
I have an anti armour dragon. It‚Äôs pumping out 414 damage. And with speed demon it only take 27 seconds to reload instead of 30........ good for pvp. That‚Äôs about it. Tends to break fast as well.
---
came here to say the same. don't get me wrong, not complaining about anything but sometimes I think I'm playing Skyrim!!
---
They need to rework home defense where each level makes your turret gain levels and increases armor penetration against enemies or something.  
---
Seem nukes are rare now
---
&gt; However, this is the first online fallout game, they have to really figure out how to  \[...\]
---
Stop right there.   
---
\- It's not the first Bethesda online game.  
---
\- It's neither the first Battlecry online game   
---
\- Many of the bugs were all already in FO4.  
---
\- Many others were just a question of common sense to find/fix or understand.  
---
\- Even if ALL the bugs were fixed, the game has still deep issues at the first place.  
---
\- Now that we all have good clues on how bad were the sales, we can say - without any doubt - that it was not a game the fans wanted at all. **The olny possible future for the franchise is Bethesda selling their rights to any other studio.** 
---
Question...

Assuming you've done some WhiteSprings grinding, have you noticed "Clusters"?  
---
I ask because most people are overlooking the patterns because they are ditching the loot they don't want, and not actually tracking.  How many times have you though to yourself "another Mutant Slayers!" or heard someone say it?  
---
 **Example:**   
---
My last WhiteSprings run, the Monday before last weeks ill fated patch, in 90 minutes I looted (7) 1* weightless pieces, (1) 2* and (1) 3*.   
---
I also looted 6 bloodied and 7 Mutants, accounting for nearly half of the total weapons I looted.  
---
   
---
Not the loot I wanted, but the clustering of the same Prefixes was undeniable, and this time around it was pretty damn good.
---
Vats works fine through the SB donut light show and through Robobrain vape clouds. Better still, if you have all the VATS related perks you can drop a SB with one mag full of 5.56 from a non legendary handmade. The enemies the SB converts on the ground are more annoying for me than the SB themselves.
---
Fyi at the end of the dock and kind of diagonal to your right is an acid node in the water.
---
And the water is less than a foundation deep
---
Read my original post in its entirety.   Yes, I use spotlights. 
---
Well have you tried removing your mutations first?
---
Toxicity? You mean drowning?
---
I turn them back on
---
Looks like it's been Nuked already
---
Not crazy, the same thing happened with mine. Used to be 24 round mag, now a 10 round mag. I ended up giving up on the piercing mag to run a drum so I don't have to reload as often
---
Definitely using them right? 
---
They tend to focus turret fire if positioned correctly. 
---
Go digging around in the fallout76prefs.ini located in "my games" there's a number of values you can screw with to help performance if you don't care about visuals. No clue why 76 is so much worse but these guys are lying to you when they say your hardware isn't good enough.
---
Gotta be honest, I am thoroughly surprised at the ratio, even considering this is Reddit, and even with all the people saying they regret it.
---
Good Luck, my windows are out of reach lol
---
Personally, I stopped playing and will jump back in once more content is added. I have too big of a backlog to spend even more time on Fallout 76 doing the same things over and over. You're totally right. People like myself need to take a break.
---
But I disagree with the complaining needing to be silenced so that potential buyers don't come to this subreddit and see a bunch of negative stuff. IMO someone on the fence should be aware of the issues before deciding whether or not they want to buy the game. Fact is, these are some major problems that people are upset about.
---
Look, I enjoyed playing the game. I still plan on coming back to it. So downvote me for saying this if you want, but there is a reason that Fallout 76 is known as the biggest gaming disappointment of 2018. As someone that has spent some time in the game design world, in my eyes the current product is what games look like roughly a year before release: Great foundation, not much substance and very buggy. 
---
Point is, If my decision of whether or not a product is worth my money is based on a Fallout 76 forum's input, I'd  prefer to see both sides and not just have a bunch of fans tell me that it's a wonderful game and to ignore everything else. It's not like metacritic where people give it 0/10 without playing the game. Even the negative folks around here have spent time with Fallout 76 and have far better input than "bethesda betrayed fallout 0/10". They WANT to enjoy the game, but are disappointed for a variety of reasons. I'm glad some people love the game and nothing should stop them from feeling that way. But in the gaming (and even general Fallout) community, this is just not a very good game right now, and the attitude of this subreddit is going to reflect that. If/when Bethesda fixes some of the major issues, things will be more positive around here.
---
So, according to the photo, there are no human npcs, indeed?
---
Yeah. I was dropping a bunch of unneeded junk and dropped my legendary handmade some how. Bethesda needs to fix that. They're not even in the same tab. I don't even know how this kind of bug could exist.
---
Same boat.  
---
I 2-box (sometimes 3-box) and my secondary character was consistently looting plans from safes at nearly a 5-1 ratio compared to my main, most of the plans I looted were due to that characters unusually good luck, that account has also looted four times the number of explosive weapons my "main" has, no TSE's, but a bloodied explosive Gatling gun is arguably better than a TSE anyway.
---
No worries, I just treat it like another random disconnect 
---
Very detailed and thought out response I appreciate the effort. Not trying to attack you or whatever in any way just felt I should say that because it's hard to judge intent by text. My reason for asking for proof though is how do we know those people got those legendaries legitimately as you claim? It is quite possible they were duped items and they pretended to get them from the mobs as a cover story or some stupid shit like that.
---
I do agree it's a stupid amount of work recording legendary drop information especially from a place like nuked white springs when so many drop so I don't fault anyone for not wanting to do it. I really do wonder about this seeded server theory though, it is certainly interesting. I can you tell you though personally the one and only explosive weapon I got was a one off, have never had one drop before or after that.
---
Are you running in borderless? It has horrible performance. 
---
If you see ‚Äúknown‚Äù they‚Äôre useless to you. Drop in a container somewhere you think someone might check a lot, or try and sell them.
---
Hello responders! ***SANJAY*** here!
---
Cool that look great
---
Found torso plans at the trainyard west of Watoga. Look everywhere. First run I found 3-4 (known) recipes. Hour later tried again &amp; got the torso. 
---
While yes but one stray bullet is deadly especially when a legendary is in the middle of the fray
---
or wooden right leg
---
Yep, and there's a junk hole right next to it too. I have my camp there. It's like my mascot.
---
water is a poison. Everything imbibed/breathed is a poison, it is the dosage that counts.
---
scienced
---
In real life too. 
---
I've even had them get mad at me because I was just nearby when a car (that had been shot by super mutants) exploded. 
---
Even better?
---
It just disappears on death leaving nothing but a growing sense of bitterness over a $60 alpha test.
---
I was there for that! I‚Äôve followed Cohh for a long time. I was so salty when it happened. He handled it pretty well though. 
---
No kill them for crashing our servers and making it worse than it already is 
---
I've learned to place all my bulk on the ground before scrapping my collected junk. Pain in the arse but works. 
---
I run out of AP in 2 vats shots with any gun. No idea how to use it.
---
yeah i've killed like 4 or 5 2 \*and 3\* enemies in the past 3 days. 1 didn't even have a legendary and the rest were only 1\* loot.
---
Oh so that‚Äôs the reason why. I kind of don‚Äôt understand how a disease that makes you more susceptible to rad damage can stop you from using marsupial, but... I guess.
---
Possibly. However, I have yet to see any meaningful data on it (as in, properly organized and with a reasonable sample size and control system). I, personally, went through a long period of garbage drops before suddenly getting a few good ones, *without any meaningful changes to my stats or cards.* Now, that is also not good data, so I can't claim it is not seeded. That said, I believe that if it is seeded, it's a bug or oversight from the FO4 code, rather than a design choice. But again, that's just opinion, not data.
---
That's just it people don't understand that most mmorpg like this are basically empty and crappy for the first few years look at WoW when it came out abd a few dlc down the road it had a game breaking bug that caused most of its highly populated city to be abandoned 
---
I turn off the staticky ones and the classical radio. Appalachia can stay on.
---
 
---
* Great work! Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.
---
Teach me master
---
The reason for the high prices is so that the actual player trade/sell component is the primary market. 
---
It‚Äôs a bug in the game that gets the incorrect enemies text mixed up and gives a normal mob a legendary tag when it isn‚Äôt. Same goes to normal mobs with no tag that will drop a legendary. Best way to know if it‚Äôs a legendary is if it‚Äôs health regenerates like the usual legendary mobs. 
---
They're aware of this bug, it's one of the most commonly reported thing here. They dont give much fuck about it tho, just the generic, we hear ya bullshit. 
---
I'm sorry for your loss.
---
Meaning all of the time you'll spend playing and replaying the best damn game series of ALL TIME. Make sure to check out the almost obscene wealth of mods on Nexus Mods (if you're on PC).
---
Im kinda on a pernament break from the game until they add some new shit or really anything.
---
Unfortunately you all are wrong. Fallout 76 was a opportunity for Bethesda to teach their developers how to do an online games - a move away from single player games - without replacing all the employees. Remember that elder scrolls online was/is outsourced to another studio. Fallout 76 was an opportunity to teach their entire company to do online gaming and make enough money at the same time to cover their training costs. 
---
FO76 was never meant to be a long term game like GTA. One year and out at best. 
---
It‚Äôs why they used an old code base. Fastest path to the desired results. 
---
The next game should be much much better. Though I wouldn‚Äôt expect another Fallout game in the next decade while they let this one fade into distant memory. 
---
I was about to comment that it cant get any worse but I've yet to see erotic fan fiction involving super mutants and snallygasters so I'll just shut up now.
---
why aren't screws in more of the things we can scrap anyway?  What are we, a bunch of mutant monkeys taking a crowbar to everything?
---
tbh, you won't wrong
---
true to the fact you could sell to other players.
---
But no-one wants to trade and if they do all they want is the Top of the Top tier legendary's.
---
So i dont think selling would help much unless you can get and farm the best stuff like bloodied or AA deathclaw gauntlets/powerfists/sledges or sentinal/bloodied armour is what most people want they dont want average 2 star stuff so is a stretch to do.
---
Nope, happens with my handmade and my lever action 
---
Hahaha nobody is crashing servers. I know the new dupe and it doesnt require crashing servers. Thats a myth they use to save their reputation. Come on man get woke
---
It‚Äôs uh... it‚Äôs not.
---
Fuck me im so upset about it. I legit turned off my ps4 and just sat for a minute and then wrote this. U literally also cannot create and submit a ticket. I just wish i at least had the torso plans lol the only 1 i dont like fuck
---
Making fun of it is the only possible option after trying to play it several times HOPING it might be good and being disappointed that it's boring and bland. And that's coming from a fan of all the other games.
---
Mod called Better Inventory separates them. You just cycle thru Aid by clicking it. Food, Water, Chems. Does weapons also. Ranged, Melee, Explosive. Probably the top ranked mod on Nexus.
---
What level were you when you got it?
---
If you want security build on a cliff in the great divide. There is many stair stepping flat areas between cliffs where you won‚Äôt need a turret or defenses. Or if you want the most secure location go to the top of sennaca rock. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for a mob to even spawn there and for a person to get there it‚Äôs ten minute hike with marsupial and a jet pack. Great location but lonely. 
---
It‚Äôs also almost impossible to take pictures of the exterior unless you only have a small structure. Also fast traveling can be dicey I ended up moving for those reasons.

The real issue here was ‚Äú**older cpu**‚Äù
---
Gotta have the right specs for your computer or it ain‚Äôt gonna run, plain and simple.
---
Alright.
---
Sorry on my part, if I came through as "prick'ish"..  
---
I'm tired and bullet points help me keep my thoughts organized when I am.   
---
Oh I get that, totally, but I could also completely Doctor a video by having a friend plant TSE's on corpses (you can add things to them for others to loot, I do it often for the fun of it).  In my case, in the WhiteSprings runs I tracked we all started with only our main weapons and armor, and I saw their inventories, because after the 3rd I was incredulously, one of them got back to back handmades (a 2* and a 3*, TSE).  Sure they could have had someone trade with them before trading with me, but I've got to ask why would anyone go to that trouble?  That is allot of work over 8 - 12 hours to yank someone's chain.  
---
In my case, believe me or don't.  
---
I'm  just another random voice on the Interwebs, can't deny that, but I would hope my post history, especially the fact I'm trying to track and in many cases report the fix for, the bugs in the game, lends me a little leeway.  
---
I've gotten exactly 3 explosive weapons on my main, none were TSE's, and 2 of them were black powder pistols. Hell until the late December patch with some of the rebalances I looted so many legendary black powder weapons it was dumb, which was another one of those head scratch moments.  
---
Only thing I can suggest is the next two few hour WhiteSprings / NukeFarming sessions you do, just try and keep track of the legendary you ditch. Not all the details, but the Prefix, weapon/armor type and star rating. It's a pain, but at the end of (2) 3 hour sessions (assuming something doesn't magically change in a patch) I'd be shocked if you didn't notice a pattern..   
---
Like a habit of looting Marine Armor 30% more than anything else, or a strangely high number of nocturnal weapons.   
---
BTW, before I knew Polar was referencing my work as proof of the seeded RNG theory I told him I though his sample size was way, way too low. I'm not saying he doesn't have data, but generally I'd say he'd need half a dozen sessions like that to have a real pattern, he'll in my mind id not be happy unless there was a solid 6 hours worth of data, but I'm also a little crazy. 
---
It's still early access....interesting.  You do realize you are invalidating your own point correct?
---
I went and disliked the vid if that makes you feel better 
---
Nice! I went through a run of indie games back in the summer there are some truly awesome story experiences out there. There was one I loved but can't remember the name, it was like gone home, but in a space ship/station... 
---
PS4 
---
Awesome that you follow Cohh too. I just hit my 5 year sub mark this month. I love that community!
---
You can get the plans to craft it from the terminal behind the laser grid in the BoS HQ. However i accidentally scrapped my left leg trying to repair it and can‚Äôt craft a new one. I have all the materials but it says I don‚Äôt. Very frustrated.
---
Hmm good tip. 
---
This is actually not a difficult concept. Games are entertainment, and I've cleared current content fo76 has to offer. I am playing other games while I wait, instead of threatening and bitching here lol 
---
He just copy pasted the article. OP didn't make that point.
---
dunno if it's still a thing but the lighthouse event does it to, man I lost soooo much ammo doing that
---
now I wait till have 50 lumi fluid or just let others finish it if there are others hahaha
---
Ya know, I realize this doesn't pertain to your specific situation, but I had one attacking my base.  So I just led him away.  Once I felt it was further than he should have been chasing me, I ditched him then fast traveled back and he was gone.  
---
Really really hope they reverse the late December / Early Jan tweak they did to legendary creature...  
---
It's even worse (not trying to diminish your suffering) when the person your with looted a quality 3* and you got a freaking drill, again, for the second time in a row.. 
---
There‚Äôs also the fact that even without that page, yes, every little thing in existence is harmful to the body in some way if there‚Äôs enough of it. That‚Äôs one of the most obvious things possible.
---
But the point here is, drinking too much water is not ‚Äúwater toxicity‚Äù whether it‚Äôs on that wiki or not, it‚Äôs considered drowning.
---
Excavator is a nice set to start out with, dump the t45
---
If this isnt a joke thread, block them on the map so they wont see you coming but observe first and shoot later, might just be 2 friends chilling
---
Lone Wanderer + Fireproof (65%) + around 300-300 armor resistance (50%).
---
Righteous.
---
I have 4 levels of rad resistance and power armor and  they still can do a number on me. 
---
I can only assume you deleted your comment after researching PlayAsMask. nice one
---
Yeah he dropped me a two star furious combat shotgun but it was level 20
---
You do realize turning a statement into a question doesn't make it correct, right?
---
me too
---
theres an overturned train bunker, southeast in the mire
---
Pray harder to RNJesus
---
Why are people losing items? Putting in a container somehow ?
---
Damn good to know i usually wait till i have 50 anyways
---
That‚Äôs awesome!
---
Auto repair in Forest. The house behind also is usable. You can claim both technically
---
There's a broken down one next to Charlston Station I hear about a lot...
---
My mistake I have 2 charisma points. 
---
yeah if others are around and you spam it to quick you will eat up stuff is the point I am making, if others are around or coming sometimes you just go up and shove in 20 lol
---
You know there's one machine in Fallout 4 that is assured to give you one, right?
---
There is still a worse drop. Nothing.
---
Just change the whole inventory system to a wow-esque system. You can‚Äôt tell me that servers haven‚Äôt improved in 15 fucking years. 
---
I got another guys! From the watoga vendor for 209 caps lol still need plans tho
---
I am definitely going to pay you a visit within the next few days. I‚Äôve been wanting to put mods on my sets but everything is way overpriced now.
---
No I mean Skyrim. Skyrim is the carrot the board will show their directors. If Starfield is a hit then it‚Äôs a bonus but if BGS fails with Skyrim launch the party will be over. 
---
Only had that happen once, and that was on a scorchbeast. was pissed as it was the third one I killed. 
---
yeh sorry to hear mate but Bethesda wont and cant reissue items that you have lost in game.
---
so your stuck without marine chest until you find another one. sorry bro
---
Ya event containers the itens ur supposed to put in replace with ur equipment
---
They sell at watoga station
---
I found another!
---
*prepared for the future!*
---
::sigh::  go to the Gwar subreddit.
---
This was my inspiration XD
---
oh good god, don't say that or they'll nerf them!
---
Thank you for trying to help me. 
---
None of those damage notifications have ever came on my screen when I‚Äôm shooting and killing things. I literally have to use All Rise and Black Diamond for anything I want to kill in a timely fashion. Or a lvl 50 hardened marksman rifle for anything else with 113 dmg. 
---
Vats cripple their legs, then snipe from a distance.
---
Holy hell, if you think the kings are bad, wait until you meet Morris.
---
First idea, phone a friend. If you're on ps4 I'll help otherwise. I say do events until you get strong enough gear to beat them.
---
Correct, it usually just boots that person...ü§£
---
While we're near the subject, HOW BOUT WE JUST GO BACK TO COMBINING TWO WEAPONS TO REPAIR ONE. 
---
I'm set up inside one of the monorail spots but I know a few good areas like a tunnel in the cranberry bog and a cave near vault 76.
---
No doubt, but they mechanically behave almost exactly the same. 
---
for sure
---
I would love this. Also, an pick-up-and-equip button. I would love to be able to pick up and immediately start firing a dropped weapon in the heat of battle.
---
I had one drop off map. I mean I literally can see the damn thing but cannot reach.
---
Yes and thats not even the new dupe. Nobody crashes. Zero effect on servers
---
So I'm pretty sure 3 scorch beast at once is a random event located at  certain random event locations.  This is based on me trying to server hop a random event location to find a pet to tame.  I consistently ran into the three SB event.  
---
I didn;t mind because they seemed to not spawn 3x the amount of scorched, who are the ones doing the real damage.
---
Sad when we have nothing better to do...
---
YAY good shit my man :).
---
Thats what we like to hear keep on playing and be encouraged not discouraged :)
---
I mean what new dupe method
---
Can't be armor since he's in PA and that disables armor effects.
---
ow yeah one of the many points where I hate the map bountries being just player clips. 
---
I sneak sniper everything in there 1 shot everything in the face except ML K. HE took PA to take down 
---
Ya haha i try ti be cause like i said i di like it a lot for what it is. Its def not a regular fallout but its fallout ya know lol
---
I went with another guy to a rift, where there was the obligatory scorchbeast. ... Pretty tough, but the other guy is higher level than I am and has a prime gun plus some awesome melee weapon. 
---
Then he dropped off the server. Still, I managed to finish of the beast and its minions. 
---
Then as I was looking for ultracite, two more spawned. They chased me up to a cave and kept me pretty thoroughly pinned down. Every time one landed or I stepped out to try to shoot them, at least one would blast me. 
---
I can't imagine taking on three. 
---
Just curious why you didn't just take shelter and keep repairing your turrets.
---
I stopped playing because I don't like using 30 rounds per glowing one. You should feel powerfully at end game and I feel like I do no damage at level 125
---
That would be sick.
---
Watoga often has legendary bots, although the number of stars varies greatly. I usually just run about to check when I do my vendor runs.
---
I agree. It's almost like it's a bad joke perpetrated on gamers by devs who hate us.  I have no weapons which will damage a Scorchbeast at all, as they've all been nerfed to being useless. I have been attacked by two at once even though one kills me in a few seconds.  They continually attack and your lousy weapons won't even fire while they are firing.  The only thing you can do is leave the server after using up all of your Stimpacs (which are so expensive at traders that they send you broke and you can't even trade fairly to get your caps back by selling stuff).  That is not an appropriate way to program a game.   What happened to you is another example of why no one wants to pay caps to take on a Workshop.  They are a complete rip-off anyway because you lose them if you leave them, if you log off or if you get attacked by some guy and his mule. You really got screwed over big time. 
---
I killed my first wendigo last night and it glitched under a staircase when it died
---
Does the 10mm smg not benefit from guerrilla?
---
in this state of the game it would get exploited by dupers hoarding caps on even more alts
---
It's just annoying... seems to me it shouldn't be shown until it can be harvested.
---
PvP server options (that people HOWLED for a month ago) apparently equals transition to full on battle royal. Jesus, this sub.
---
So you‚Äôre playing a game with RPG mechanics as you would play call of duty or fortnight (pick up a weapon and go whack stuff). 
---
This isn‚Äôt a game in that genre. If you play it that way, you‚Äôll have a very sub-par experience. 
---
I agree haha, they should really hire or just take the mod codes 
---
Thanks. This is the first time I've read that. 
---
I dropped my very first explosive handmade. Realized it immediately, went to pick it up and DC'd. I was very upset. 
---
Watched the doc and feels like a lot of smoke and mirrors. I was saying this would be a coop dlc release for fo4. That way they could have tested their engine online as opposed to a full triple A release using the old untested online engine. Whether that was lazy or incompetence it‚Äôs six in on half a dozen in the other, they need a home run for investors and they aren‚Äôt looking at Starfield they are looking at Skyrim. 
---
There is apparent some changes, namely that it seams it's no longer based on a weapon's base damage output. This is likely a change to account for the fact that weapons now scale with level, and doing it the same way would make weapons that appear at low levels worse at high levels, and makes damage boosts much more important.
---
Ha! 
---
&gt;Makes me wonder why these haven't been introduced yet since they seem so complete.
---
Something, Something, chopped up game to sell as DLC later, something, something, profit.
---
I think the game should just open the mod tools so that modders can fix the game at this point. 
---
Meh. If they never landed and only flew around, people would complain abiut that. 
---
I like them. When they're anywhere nearby, you have to either hide or get ready for a fight. They're a good predator and serve a variety of good roles in the game. 
---
See? Now we‚Äôre taking :D
---
Uhhh, I'm wildly misunderstanding here. Skyrim launched in 2011.
---
Is this some legendary you found out in the wild, or one you've farm the same area for relentlessly? If a wild one, I feel your pain. If farmed, then go suck an egg.
---
Added to that, the scrapper perk is useless. At the very least, it ought to be producing a random screw, gear or spring off of every gun. 
---
finally! The truth!!
---
I only play to sell for vendor caps, and then i'm done.
---
I disagree there. It's not without story or depth, it's just lacking in story personal to your character. I enjoy finding things like the Wasteland Epicurean tour, or little notes about the lives of these people from before they passed. Problem is, without living NPC's or player choice (as empty as that ultimately is in Fallout games), it lacks a personal touch and impact, so it does not appeal to a lot of folks.
---
Which is fair, mind you. Different strokes for different folks and all that, what I enjoy others might not. But to claim them as irrefutably empty and storyless is not quite accurate.
---
Trying playing on OCE servers not at prime time
---
Fallout universe resembles about -50 -60 from our timeline.
---
Do you mean Elder Scrolls 6?
---
Yes!
---
If all they did was take it and can prove it they will be reactivated 
---
If twitch views are any indication, there are currently only 400 people watching fo76 streams.
---
Not even related to pvp...
---
Ah yeah, you're right, it was like 2am, my bad. General gist stands though, tag them for search and you'll end up with more than you know what to do with in no time.
---
Yup, can't even climb ladders or ledges, or go prone in Creation engine games (unmodded). [They're on record as saying ladders are too hard for them.](https://kotaku.com/hey-why-arent-there-any-ladders-in-fallout-5613374) Maybe learn ladders before trying to make a online shooter, eh Bethesda?
---
I already do this. I don't call them "dupers" though. I call them random people at their house chilling. It's fun.
---
 Seems like it might be a decent Idea to fix shit before introducing more shit that will need to be fixed.  
---
Suggestions?
---
I'm on board with 2.5. 
---
I still like the game and think they're making a legit effort to improve things. 
---
I miss it so much. It's cool building stuff and collecting supplies along my journeys, but it's just an extra step for repairing weapons when you pick up so many duplicates. 
---
Yeah, I'm convinced that some sick bastard sits in the office and giggles as he comes up with ways to make the game less enjoyable.  I'm level 57 on XBox 1X and level 35 on PS4 Pro and I've pretty much had enough. I've started playing other new games I've had on the back-burner.  Most are graphically far superior to this pixellated, crashing mess.  FO76 is just a lot of work with not much fun.  Bethesda is committing slow suicide but I don't understand why the company would do that.  So many people have been willing to give this game every chance, despite the old game engine because we loved the Fallout world, as I have but Bethesda seem intent on screwing up the franchise and hammering nails in this game's coffin through tight-arse design decisions and poor programming.  
---
I think they work the same way that Tequila worms do.
---
Always record when you do stuff like this. 
---
Cool. I just wish I knew why it was neon green.
---
If this is true, my condolences, and is literally the comment I've made before, "what if someone picks it up".   
---
    
---
If it's not, back to your cave troll!   
---
There, I've covered all the bases..
---
Try and get a community managers attention, they can sometimes help speed up the process I hear 
---
Yeah for pve or PvP there‚Äôs diff build counters vs melee or Ranged etc. would be cool 
---
 Level up, get better gear and try again later.  Run some side quests and do some whites springs grinding.
---
But can you have one as a pet?
---
Mr.Handy Mail Bot
---
Kinda hard when they use older builds of the game and introduce old bugs lol
---
Well i typically only deal with people from here or facebook groups as well but my shop is at whitesprings so sometimes ill have randos wander in to my trade post and trade with me. 
---
You can pacify them with the Animal Friend perk.
---
Thanks man, and no it‚Äôs not fake we‚Äôre on Xbox and we did record. They emailed the video to the same email that mentioned the indefinite suspension. 
---
&gt; Well yeah you built it out of beer bottles, telephones and soup cans
---
We can build out of literal scrap materials radiation cleansing arches that don't even need to be in an enclosed space to wash away heavy radiation poisoning in seconds. We're crafting Jesus; don't question the miracles
---
Me too. Briefly. 
---
They said previously DLC would be included...  Pretty sure..  
---
Cut for DLC's or not ready I'll buy, cash grab, not yet that jaded
---
Well me too but my shop is in a high traffic area so sometimes ill have randos wander in to my trade post and trade with me. Most of the time they dont have mics so its hard to work out a deal with someone who does not have a mic. 
---
West tek has a fair amount of legendaries, you could also try watoga emergency services and the drowned train yard.
---
Rad worms lasts about an hour then everything breaks.
---
Server hopping or getting disconnected and relogging fixes it.
---
I have a build where I can not be killed with any ranged damage. Even grenades and fat mans. Melee wrecks me though. If they nerfed one shot ranged they should nerf one shot melee :)
---
A i c. K
---
Did the same, the weapon durability compared to the beta is insane, I mean I can't argue too much with a pipe pistol breaking after a few clips for "fluffy" reasons, but in all practical game play aspects it's a bit unacceptable.
---
Sounds like playstation 6 lol
---
Peanit butter and crack sandwich
---
Peanut butter and crack sandwich
---
Well the other night i did notice a little text thing does come up when someone declines an item saying "price to high" right under my trade box. Now idk if thats just a generic response that the game gives you when they decline or not but it got me thinking about those ideas. 
---
Problem as i see it is that it's exceptionally difficult to intermingle 2 completely different loot reward systems.  This has been brought up in other games like the borderlands series how some folk wanted to modify their weapons to get exactly what they wanted vs grinding RNG to get the perfect weapon.  You can't really do both or at least the Dev has to be exceedingly talented to strike the right balance somewhere between the 2.  
---
 Either they have to competently intermingle 2 different systems or completely drop the current RNG system in favor of a system you prefer.  Can you tell me Bethesda is up to that task considering how they've done up to now? 
---
You may personally find it tedious, but you CAN grind until you eventually get the items you desire or else you can purchase those items from other players.  Bethesda hasn't physically locked someone out of those paths.  Player trading isn't a ban-able offense.  Frankly grinding the perfect gear is ENTIRELY the current endgame, so you're complaining that you feel locked out of content cause you don't want to do the only remaining content.
---
I personally don't care all that much for the available vendor plans.  It actually damages the reward aspect of doing events now.   At the minimum they should have come up with some form of new rewards to offset devaluation of plans.  As soon as they made the patch changes I noticed that event participation started declining.
---
I like Bethesda, but I don't think they're..inspired..enough to come up with a perfect melding of 2 different rewards system from simply what we've seen from them up to this point.
---
play devils advocate here, if you read the betesda post.. too many realy rare items inside a short period... will get you flagged. those are rare right? how many did they get ?
---
I too would like this please &amp; thank mods
---
I won't buy Atoms at all. Reasons being.
---
1/ The stuff maybe unique in fallout 76 but vast majority of the ones i've seen were available for no extra in fallout 4 OR for free and better mesh/textures by modders for fallout 4.
---
2/ A LOT of challenges to gain free atoms do not work or are at best unreliable.
---
3/ The pricing of the items are quite frankly ludicrous.
---
4/ Because i hold out hope that Bethesda will allow for private servers and modders to make mods for those servers BEFORE those modders lose interest in modding the game. Supporting the Atom shop allows bethesda to gain a bit more money without fear of competition (mostly), and encourages them to delay, temporarily or indefinitely, the deployment of private server features/modding.
---
RADstag. 
---
Man either that's a lucky break or fantastic job with the CYA...  (or you record everything?)
---
Lmao, I ran into three of them at Whitesprings Monday night and then I ran into four of them away from a nuked fissure last night 
---
Wut
---
Yeah me too. I enjoy killing those robots.
---
I was just saying I don‚Äôt feel like screws are in short supply so there‚Äôs no need to add additions sources 
---
I have a build where I take no damage from ranged. I had 5 people trying to kill me and they couldn't with ranged. I died eventually after running out of my secret sauce. Melee destroys though. I always get 1 shot by a good melee build with full sentinels/assassins.
---
Yes. Somehow lost the pipe gun rose the robot gave out. 
---
Also accidentally scrapped a level 50 handmade once. 
---
Don't think so, but there is a rare solo spawn even for them so maybe. 
---
That's what a Duper would say.
---
I'll pass this on to the devs.  However we feel the turrets were underperforming and were required content so we nerfed them.   They now do damage to themselves and your base instead of the enemy.  Have a great ~~farming~~ game experience!
---
Get drills and Syringers all the time at WhiteSprings, or I did pre-"Black Tuesday" (01/29/2019).. Not done a nuke since then.
---
Dodgey is nuts. Look into Dodgey with full perks and agility items. 
---
I did the same thing to a person.  Their bed was right next to an open window so I used that to get inside.  They were busy crafting so they didn't notice. I have chameleon armor so I ducked down to go invisible and waited for them to get close. Then I stood up. They screamed and disconnected. I just wanted to be friends! Lol
---
Home defense in agility?  Gets you to mark 3.  That's about all I know 
---
Yes i would go back to playing regularly again
---
The ones in Harper's ferry.....do not Fuck around
---
Scream back.
---
I was the same flick flick bang bang bang flick bang
---
Related to that though - servers being sluggish about processing weight is something that needs fixing.
---
Look, the 600 Stash limit is bad enough.  But if I put my junk in there and you tell me it's 598, and I check back a few seconds later and now it's 560, that's pretty annoying.  Same thing happens on my character.  Spontaneously becoming overencumbered?  Oh, wait, no you're not, never mind.
---
Can the random C.A.M.P.   attacks be taken as pets? If so then the SB attack set would be a good test set
---
Yeah, my level 50 Power Armour does absolutely nothing either.  I avoid them too. Surely that isn't how the game is supposed to be played. It's poor game design. 
---
I know this. You are wrong though and the minority. Most people have issues with having a ton of everything else, and a small amount of screws.
---
At least it's only 25 years old and not 200+.
---
If your on PC, once you hit 35 happy to equip you in either a full set of Raider or T-45 PA
---
There‚Äôs a buildable house out there a cemetery a cave just to mention a few 
---
Can confirm, but you will need Fortune Finder for this one. It's in the dirt around the Deathclaw mound, and I only found it with the location pings from the perk. I was able to interact with it when I got close enough. It gave me a total of 92 caps with Cap Collector.
---
I got the BoS for all combat armor pieces (Xbox One) from doing treasure maps, minus the legs. I bought the leg plan off of reddit
---
 Does the AA mag stack with an AA legendary, not sure I would drop to a smaller mag, 85 ready rounds is awfully nice.
---
For real. That‚Äôs taken a lot of getting used to. :/
---
This weeks inside the vault hasn‚Äôt been posted yet. Hopefully they have figured out how to tell power armor chassis apart with the next patch. I know I was ecstatic to see the known plans request get put into play. Hopefully they add a device at CAMP that you can sell stuff. Im also hoping for a 50 lbs stash  that you can share between characters
---
 I like to stick stuff in suitcases or cash registers at vendors.
---
Any mods or edits to your INI files?   
---
Any driver or windows updates? (Check your logs before answering)
---
no make perks work how they did
---
nerf take harder
---
increase missile and nade etc damage or make it ignore most armor 
---
Bulk lead and aluminum are half weight, the rest are roughly the same weight. 
---
  Clearly, that was a major mistake. Hopefully, they learn from it.
---
If they moved explosive to primary mod, I'd be happy with a damage buff, but as it was before they were *way* too powerful.
---
Git gud
---
Meant Elder Scrolls 6 but I refer to it as Skyrim 2 due to sales and popularity 
---
the other day I got nothing, 50+ shotgun shells later - nothing.....
---
Mine is about between Watoga and abandoned bog town workshop. Fast travel to Watoga and SBQ is 3-5 caps, harpers ferry is maybe 7-10. 
---
Then I can get either from Vault into Sutton station-WS, or if I'm westside of Watoga, from there to WS and Sutton station.
---
Only bad thing is there's no collectors. There's SB spawn next to it for little springs, the SB rarely seems home.
---
Honestly, you're probably a bit underleveled for that section.  The Wendigo Cave is tough.
---
To be fair, I don't believe it's actually part of the main quest.  Yes, it's listed under Main, but it's not mandatory to gain access to the silos or anything.
---
TL;DR - *The game would be fine if they called it Early Access instead of "relasing" the game, and their history indicated they'll stick to it for a while and might possibly deliver a good game eventually.*
---
Bethesda has openly claimed that the game is an experiment and intended for long term growth. The problem is, everyone wants the game to be in two different places in its lifespan at the same time.
---
The game is currently in Early Access mode, and I wish to god they'd just called it that rather than "releasing" it, because most of the rabble rousing ammo would be gone in place of reasonable bug reporahhhhahaha, just kidding, I remember the launches of 3, NV, and 4, let's be honest, people'd be just as riled up. But if they called it Early Access, the media would not have latched on so hard, and we could have kept it "in house" as it were.
---
In EA mode, priorities are (Bugs &gt; Gameplay Issues &gt; Content Additions), and that's exactly what we're getting. Patches are mostly adding either QoL, Balance, or Bug fixes, with very little new content. Certain builds are more favored than others, and original intentions (such as the weird mix of pvp and anti-pvp designs) are tested and altered or discarded as the game is played by early adopters.
---
But because Bethesda, among its other fuckups like Canvasgate, decided to "Release" it, people also want the game to be in Expansion mode. More content, more to do, keep the gamer treadmill running. And it's just not ready for that mode.
---
(Never mind that by "releasing" the game, they prevent themselves from justifying a character reset to clear out the problems caused by duping.)
---
They've shown that they are willing to stick to a game despite it being only a modest success and make it much better (ESO). I'm willing to remain calm and simply wait for the first major content addition (and I am not counting PvP mode, personally, because it should be a relatively simple fix and does not really add new activities to the game). Once the content updates, if they still don't have a meaningful end-game, I'll probably stop playing beyond the occasional "Wonder what's new/I want to shoot things" visit.
---
Oh... and before people comment on "but they're making Atom Shop content," please note that we know they already have content prepared and planned (presidential bunker and vault interiors). At the very least, the Art assets are probably more than done. As such, art teams probably have nothing better to do, because *they're not useful for the purposes of bugfixing and system design.* So, it's either have them twiddle their thumbs, or design stuff to toss on the Atom Shop and maybe justify their pay. And that assumes they didn't have the art team make a shit ton of AS items ahead of time and are just dropping them in bits and pieces to encourage reflex purchases during one day sales (like they did during the entire holiday season with stuff datamined back at launch).
---
It's probably further north than you want, but behind the Red Rocket Megastop is a nice semi-flat open plot of land. It has a slight slope but there's no grass or anything to clip through foundations and there's a path directly to it from the road below.
---
Worst part is when the Scorch Queen doesn't drop a legendary. Just some useless Ultracite plans I already have.
---
Im with you on the explosive missiles and such they really shouldnt of nerfed them along with tse‚Äôs
---
Lead== never pass up pencils, tin cans , wrenches, paint cans, rat poison, children's toys.
---
Springs== typ writer's, kitchen scale, clip boards.
---
Screws== lots of children's toys cars and trucks have screws typ writer's and other things.
---
I have found no resource to actually be scarce I do a daily walk and explore for things and find them. It takes time but is still fun.
---
SBs are BS anything that can thro that much energy could power the whole country.
---
The sonic attacks are too bright and no creature could sustain that level of activity and survive.
---
Even if you do have a video of what you receive, it doesn't prove that they *didn't* break TOS before recording.
---
I'm curious to see the footage. Post the video
---
Disagree almost entirely.   
---
Long term adding the plans to the vendors is going to hurt the longevity of the game, to say nothing of the impact it's already having on player interaction.   
---
Why bother looking for a "PowerSmith" Specalists who sunk a few hundred hours into getting plans when you can drop 5.5k in caps and do it yourself.  
---
That change alone kneecaps the community building.  
---
To do the same with loot would be worse, by a huge factor.   
---
Not only would it be nearly impossible to balance, it would completely gut the market(s) people have made, and destroy the possibility of player vending working in any remote way.
---
I don‚Äôt have access to it but fear (one of the suspended) does
---
On trading: 
---
\-Only being able to get back a quarter of the caps we sell items for is completely ridiculous and a total rip-off.  
---
\-The Stimpacs are ridiculously over-priced. 
---
\-Every time I go to a trader I leave a few hundred caps poorer, no matter how much stuff I sell them.  This is ridiculous. 
---
\-The ammo and med machines at the Railway Stations are useless.  I never use them and I can guarantee no one else does either, so why have them there?  They carry 200 caps but you can't sell them anything at all.  This is obviously another design flaw which makes the machines pointless.  If they are not providing any service, they are a design failure.  The price of ammo in these and from the traders is completely farcically ridiculous so no one buys ammo, full stop and we can't break it down or trade it. Fix this mess. Any beginner developer could fix this.  I could do it myself. What's stopping you?  
---
Last week it was concern trolling, now servers are empty. 
---
PikachuMeme.jpg
---
I have that inventory sorted by spoiling. That way I can use the ones lower. Which are always food and drink.
---
And rest of inventory that doesn't spoil, is listed in alphabetical.
---
It's not perfect though. I could use mod but Im not super fond of always learning to use new stuff.
---
I do, see above answer I‚Äôm not versed in order or lore But Elder Scrolls 6 has to be big and clear of the stink from FO76 because if it‚Äôs a Bomb Zenimax will be replacing people 
---
Why would they make the SB one shot turrets?
---
It's stupid you can't use build mode to design serviceable defenses.  The game even walks you through a timer to build defenses that barely get one shot off before they are disabled. 
---
You can't even funnel the ground enemies like in fo4 because they will just stop at the perimeter and shoot your walls. 
---
Build mode is a cosmetic add on to this game with nerfed turrets, nerfed artillery, nerfed build limit, and nerfed storage limits. They also broke immersion by making a system that favors illogical structures with only 1x1 bases touching the ground.
---
Argh..
---
But repairing your weapon does make it better. Use the weapon artisan perk and your weapon does more dmg when fully repaired
---
my gunsmith 5/5 does absolutely nothing for durability on my 2se lever
---
No, I meant it lacks story. A few notes scattered about does not a story make. The stories that have some depth lack player choice, so we are left with stories that are poorly suited to an interactive medium.
---
I'm on level 50 and my favorite thing to do is to help people with lower levels around. This is the second online game I play, maybe I'll start playing other stuff just to be a healer or something. 
---
Yeah extremely, which is why they impulse picked up the bag (800+ pounds of weight.)
---
Hahaha! The RNG gods hate us ALL!
---
It's a general bug. Any time you "spam" click items in a menu, there is a chance an unintended item appears and gets clicked as well.  It can happen if you're using a container like FTP, a regular container like a suitcase, or even just dropping things on the ground.
---
Never spam-click. It's not worth it.
---
Your add-ons need to be updated
---
I plan on running a shop once player vending is implemented. I only have 2 pies, but they are totally being sold for extravagant prices due to rarity. I just wish Bethesda would remove the guaranteed spawn for it. 
---
Sadly I'm on Xbox
---
I believe the answer is yes, White Knight slows armor degradation. Similar to gunsmith, licensed plumber, and makeshift warrior.
---
For me, I like the change because my Instigating rifle also has +50% limb damage, so it's convenient for me to have it always start with a leg.
---
That is what I don't get, why people act like they had every reason to expect a finely tuned and polished game when in reality any "hardcore" fallout fans (like people who spend time on fallout subs) would have- A) seen that letter to the fans explaining that even the devs don't expect that to be the case, and B) most of those people already did pretty much nothing but shit on BGS and Fallout 4 since that came out. Hell, since 76 was announced the main fallout subs content was like 20% excitement and optimistic posts roleplaying as NPCs and 80% complaining and conjuring up issues based on what little was known... nuking camps, stealing loot, various griefing, no npcs, and a whole slew of other complaints. Then the "beta" which people clearly understood to actually be early access, thus a glaringly obvious glimpse at what they were buying and there was nothing but complaints. 
---
Yet people sit here saying they expected a refined, polished high quality AAA game? And they had to have the game sooooo bad that they chose to pre order or buy it day 1 instead of waiting for reviews? Even the people who were looking forward to the game knew to keep expectations in check, the signs were literally everywhere. 
---
Never spam-click anything in your inventory. Ever. Lost my Insigating AP Fire Axe (or as I thought of it, "My .308 Farming Axe") by spam clicking to drop something or other while overloaded.
---
Really not, but doesn't matter. The guns gone, so I've no proof otherwise.
---
This is not an update. Thanks for the clickbait.
---
Better yet, have the flatwoods monster actually appear 
---
Beautiful
---
The handmade has a huge variety of ammo capacities based on the magazine. I think the first one I picked up had a 10 round; I think my current one has a 20, modded with the perforating magazine. 
---
i like this idea
---
Second suitcases at vendors. If it's something really common I just drop it wherever, but if I have duplicates of desired plans, I make sure to leave it in the brightest colored suitcase at the closest vendor. I've also found helpful care packages of scrap and ammo in them left by others. It feels great knowing someone was probably as happy to find the modern couches I left as I was to find those 200 rounds of .45.
---
Gritty and interesting.
---
Only random encounters can be taken. and only specific solo ones. 
---
This is hilarious. 
---
Hmm. One of them was still there last time I looked. Forest Operative Underarmor or something. May have been at the armory vendor.
---
I don't keep up with the aesthetic stuff so it's quite possible that something is missing. Would be surprised if they'd bothered changing anything except plans though.
---
This is what they need to do. First, they need to stop releasing content and stop working on the game, focus on not fucking up ES 6. Second, they need to allow private servers and full mod support. Let the mod community fix it like EVERY OTHER Bethesda game. Skyrim wasnt great without mods, Fallout 3, NV, 4 were not great without mods. The community steps in every time and creates far superior content making the games great. Go play any vanilla moddable Bethesda game. They suck without mods.
---
It‚Äôs a bug, it takes things out of your inventory through no fault of your own when you deposit items into the container. The items you lose aren‚Äôt even on the list of available items to deposit as only those brown containers are. I lost 3,000 rounds of 5.56 ammo like this through no fault of my own. It has nothing to do with pressing the wrong button.
---
That's much better visibility than I had haha
---
Actually I made it on time to finish her off. Went pretty smooth. 
---
My "friend" it's people like you who have made my life hell, and the witchhunts do no one any good.   
---
 I run three accounts, and since BETA I've built up a network of like minded folks who swing by dropping extra Legendaries and mats to stockpile..  
---
Why?   
---
Since early on, every time I run into legit new players or higher level "newbies" I stop and generally make their day.  
---
Last night I equipped 2 guys with upgraded weapons, the level 57 I replaced all his non-legendary weapons with anti-armor and other solid 1*'s...   
---
I also gave him Calibrated Shocks, Bracers, Perception upgrade for his helmet and his torso got a core assembly I think.  
---
It's how the game was sold to me, a change to make the wasteland a better place, and work together to tame it..  
---
Ridiculously Ill conceived and poorly thought out WitchHunt threads have resulting in people reporting me for duping ('cause who but a duper would give out non-TSE 1*&amp;2* Legendaries?), attacked, C.A.M.P. Assaulted and more than a couple  times verbally assaulted for offering to help people out.   
---
But I'm just another random guy on the Internet, and must be a duper for saying I'm not, so go ahead and keep being too close minded to consider that posts like this do more harm then good
---
Shoulder to shoulder? Damn you're generous haha. In terms of visuals and diversity of interesting locations this game blows the others out of the water imo, though I can't comment much on 3 as I didn't play it for long. NV in particular was a pretty bland landscape, only redeemed by the atmosphere and feel the game had.
---
It's probably the only thing I'd say is better... but still, it's an important one. xD
---
nope commando
---
Yeah, even with the perks so they don't hurt, I feel like I'm going to get a seizure just from the mass of spiraling blue sh_t on the screen.  When there's 2 or more, I just server hop.
---
 I found a near lifetime supply of .308 and .45 in suitcases at Watoga as well as many plans.
---
Open containers just by staring at them?
---
Gatling gun is good, as is 50. Cal
---
I feel like I everyone‚Äôs a little legendary crazy. You could play FO76 without a single legendary.  Sure you won‚Äôt be able to run up to a Mireluk queen and smash it in the face. But I am not going uninstall the game because it takes me 18 shots from my vanilla gauss to kill the Mireluk queen instead of two. 
---
It's intended. I've actually seen more than a few complaints from people that set their CAMP up at the junk pit nearby, because they found it to be an eyesore.
---
And as I said, it does not lack story, it just lacks the sort of story you (and many others) want. I actually found 76 to be much deeper than any other Fallout, simply because behind every cheerful note and hopeful tale and desperate last words is the absolute fact that the person who made it was wrong, and is very much dead.
---
It's a actual story, not a player run narrative. It's like saying that stories in books are somehow more valid than stories in movies, or that mystery novels are less meaningful than fantasy.
---
This does not negate your right to dislike or criticize the story, but to state it has no story is factually incorrect.
---
You can craft it
---
Oh I agree. I love the physical design of them. I loathe the mechanical design.
---
Thank u
---
It's technically against the ToS to even take it :/
---
Your two friends got banned for cheating and are telling people other stuff to shovel the blame elsewhere
---
Seconded. And think, if the ratio is like that on *here* of all places, I wonder what it's like outside of /r/fo76.
---
I like the idea. I think they shoot WAY to fast. Maybe one shot every 2.5 seconds or maybe even 3.5
---
I personally only use vats when i am getting attacked at ultra close range, the point where enemies are basically merged with your body they are so close, as it is incredibly irritating aiming at an enemy when an enemy attacks and goes through your body and is now behind you rather than in front.
---
If you're not wearing PA, put a Padded or Dense mod on the torso and you're fine. Add Fireproof if you really enjoy bathing in sonic screams.
---
Oh, I never said I was good at it ;) I got to level three. Once. But I have yet to do it again after I found the elevator guy, so I have no way to skip the same two dungeon levels I always see.
---
Seeing this very evident today on PC.  Best example for me is a Super Mutant taking no damage with scoped lever rifle , headshots, body shots just standing there but his 4 friends start charging at me, at the NAR yard Watoga.
---
Unfortunately no. Once it‚Äôs gone you‚Äôre screwed. To craft it I have to have one in inventory.
---
I like that you like this idea üòÅ
---
Flight Helmet + Surgical Mask 
---
there are two that spawn in that particular location, one that gets sucked up into the mound and one a little further away from it in a clearing of grass maybe 10-15 feet from the mound. there's a magazine spawn on the other side of the mound in the same position as the cap stash, just opposite side. 
---
It's unlikely that is all they did. This happens all the time man your friends just aren't telling the whole truth.
---
I think even having "all the plans" on vendors is going to hurt the game long term, there are other MMO examples.  
---
Honestly the thing they got right was keep the cost high, if anything things like the shocks should be twice as expensive, if not more 
---
If you look at the map at whitesprings below the snake to the right side of the map. Once on the ground outnifnthe map my camp is between the break in the wall and the guard shack. If you are facing the wall the guard shack is on your left and the hole in the wall is in your right. Pretty much in the middle there 
---
many thanks! Thats a lot of excess weight at .25 weight units per...
---
I probably have at least 50 of them!
---
I was in that fight! After a few seconds the loot window refreshed and there was two star legendary shotgun. At first I was like NOOOOOOOO! 
---
and then I was like YEAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
---
I was in their party on the same server.  I can surely say they‚Äôre not smart enough to cheat. 
---
Are you carrying a lot of holotapes? I think if you have too many, that one won't go.
---
I sold mine and redrafted it
---
My base is the opposite of that: I have a nice three story home with beautiful hardwood floors, sofas, patio seating and cooking area, a rumpus room with a pool table, instruments, unlocked water purifiers, a sweet little organic garden... and a mysterious door with a keypad. 
---
That's *my* workshop/safe room.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs an option too. I think 1* gets you 1 commendation and 2-3* gets you 2 commendations? I think. It‚Äôs been a while lol but lehendaries is how I got most of mine too. 
---
Let me check.
---
Press x to doubt
---
I thought duping was over?
---
Curious why you think it could turn into an exploit? Do you think people will game the server with lag or disconnects that make the server desync the status of in game items?
---
That will be nerfed now that you've said it. 
---
Thats where the mothman is?
---
Yea, but I don‚Äôt understand why picking up the holotapes, where all the story of Fallout76 is, should cause that. They should really fix that, I refuse to drop the holotapes
---
I was in party and server with them. They were off claiming workshops while we all lagged (controls disabled every other minute for at least 20-25 seconds) and know they were not doing anything wrong. They found two level 2 people at gorges junkyard with tons of cavaliers armor in a chest there. 
---
Fire up the vertibirds and cue Firefly music!
---
Yeah I one shot them with my instigating knuckles but it's their almost teleport-fast running and rad damage. Often 60+ rads in a single swipe.
---
Please tell me how to do that, because my Blade plan says I have to have one, is grayed out at 0/1 required. Others have had this same issue. If I can craft it that would be great but I don‚Äôt see how to do it.
---
I did too. 
---
Yup unlucky
---
Of course i do, mod and repair my legendaries, but with white knight perk card you have armor repairing nerly for free. Hunting rifle is too cheap to keep working. As rare material u dont have much from killing mobs are springs, that is only one (not counting lead and steel for crazy amound of ammo) thing i had deficit of.
---
I get it, just making sure that it was the same bug.
---
Maybe put the ones you aren't using in your stash?
---
You could gift or sell them to other players. I usually ditch em in popular locations for others to find. The freakin things weigh 0.25. I dropped like 30lbs of (Known) plans today that I got sick of hoarding, lol. 
---
Simulcrum. 
---
Come on /r/fo76 and vent.
---
Joking aside, right now, there is not \*meaningful\* end game content. I personally still get my daily caps and do daily/weekly challenges, but as far as gameplay, you've discovered the biggest design flaw in the game, more so than any mere bug or balance issue.
---
Welcome to the club :)
---
I'm just putting the game down for a bit and waiting for the first real PvE content patch before I decided if I want to really quit or not.
---
They nailed the roads perfectly.
---
I was sad I couldn‚Äôt build a base where my apartment is in motown :( 
---
Happens from time to time, usually going to the menu and back helps, worst case a close and re-open of the client.
---
Maybe, I‚Äôll try it out when I have time thanks for the tip 
---
No. I haven't gotten that far in the game, but saw it on a YouTube playthrough
---
Fallout 76 never had the magic. That‚Äôs why they limited pre-orderers to like 8 hours of beta. They knew they were selling a turd from e3 on. 
---
It‚Äôs also called a minimum viable product. They are still counting the money. 
---
We didn't realise that the survival aspect of the game was the survival of our gaming motivation and love for the franchise. Those things are under attack every day we play this game.
---
I have a broken blade.. I have enough to repair it though
---
yes its about 0.01%.
---
there was a reddit post a while back breaking down the odds.
---
He basically said that its a 1 in 3000 or 30000 tries.
---
So assuming you try 2999 times the 3000th time should result in a 99.99% chance at obtaining said item :).
---
Sooooooo....
---
It's on the list of things I've yet to report, but the vendors have a limited number of plans they can have it seems.  
---
The BOS plans show as available on nearly all the vendors tables, but aren't showing up likely due to that.
---
I find low levels on the map and fast travel to them, spam follow emotes, and drop the plans in a nearby container. Then shoot at the container for good measure until they loot it.... if they dont have a mic.
---
We're united in futility. 
---
I'm lovin' it! The servers are more stable and there are less greifers!
---
pls üòç
---
they don‚Äôt weigh anything put them in your stash you pack rat!
---
I felt that way for a while about this game and the whole lack of moddability... but I think maybe I like it this way, sort of. I don't like that I can't fix bugs via mods. I do like that I can't spend more time tweaking mods than playing, which is what I end up doing every time I pick up Fallout 4. I end up hopping on the nexus to check for mod updates and then downloading a pile of new mods that will almost certainly conflict with something I already have and then spend an hour in xedit sorting conflicts... so this lack of moddability is kind of like a vacation before I dive back into that with Fallout 5.
---
Insane sprint speed and instant hit of huge rads.
---
Yeah, I'm on pc.
---
I checked nexus, there's some mods but mostly texture related and far elevators. Lol
---
Are there other places?
---
Im gonna pick up the rest of the series when I finish one....
---
Reek had Stockholm Syndrome and PTSD. He wasn't a masochist. 
---
That's because you, like most everyone, expected the game to launch into Expansion mode, but in reality, it's still in Early Access mode.
---
In EA mode, priorities are (Bugs&gt;Balance&gt;QoL&gt;Content), and that's what we're getting. If Bethesda had called this Early Access, the game would be *celebrated*. But they didn't. They released it.
---
Once a short period passes after release, players expect Expansion mode in any game that comes with a promise of future content updates. More stuff to do, more things to see, more game to play. This is what they keep talking about, but have yet to deliver, which is (reasonably enough) frustrating most of the players.
---
All I can advise is to *put the game away for a bit*. Wait until the first real content update arrives, and then play and see if you end up enjoying the game again.
---
Sent you a friend request. Turns out I remembered the stats wrongly, it actually is just two stars, here it is: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YsuxHyx.jpg)
---
The big thing for one is ALOT. It's a MASSIVE texture overhaul that makes it look fairly modern, which is amazing given that it looked sort of dated in 2007 ;)
---
There are quite a few more for 2 and an absolute wealth for 3. Including some much needed story work. The main ALOT installer works for all 3 as an aside.
---
So are you willing to part with it? If so let me know. Thanks.
---
There's some flat spaces in the area around the Twin Lakes and Investigator's Cabin. Great lakeside, or riverside location too.
---
Not at all, just noticing the trend with devs with pisspoor game design to nerf things and call it balance.
---
just put a dense mod on your chest piece and you will take little to no damage from that attack anymore
---
Me too but I'm bored with killing the same things all the time. I have to leave the server if the SB approaches.  Hardly any point playing if all there is is scrounging and scrapping nerfed weapons and armour. 
---
I never get a damn good thing from that event. Just BS. 
---
I kept the one that makes me invisible.
---
Hello darkness my old friend...
---
How hard is it to get a mic? Why play online multiplayer without a headset?
---
I'm now terrified of an expansion that can be finished the first day. Just another event to grind. That would have been fine a month ago.
---
Pretty much. 
---
Strongly agree. I currently use a mod for this and feel fortunate to be on PC for that alone. It's a massive QoL improvement and helps one implement well-thought out strategy, avoid mistakes of forgetfulness, and mitigates some tedium. What's more, I do feel those of us using the mod for this have somewhat of an advantage over players without it. Nothing gamebreaking, but I'd rather everyone have access to the same functionality without looking to third-party modders.
---
So I stopped playing this game for pretty much that reason.
---
There is another game in playing that had a similar rocky start, is another "early Access" game like this one, but they are constantly updating and patching the game.
---
I'm still playing it because it's constantly evolving.
---
https://www.playatlas.com/index.php?/forums/topic/2628-pc-patch-notes-client-v1855-server-v1857/
---
Sometimes patched several times a day, and at least multiple times a week.
---
Game has flaws, but they are working hard on it.
---
Minus continuously shrieking at you for five mins straight. Dragons actually use logic. 
---
Huh. I did this at lvl 26. Basically get to the part with the mirelurk king by sneak shooting everything. Then once there I threw down some mines, switched to my excavator power armor and went to town with a shotgun then melee after he and a few mirelurks come at me through the mines. Then the final bbbj oss, the wendingo, I just sneak shot's whole still in the PA. They were around lvl 40 at the time. 
---
does say in the files too the words - The Children Of .... 
---
maybe its children of atom?
---
What's your gamertag just crafted another
---
I don't doubt that is all they did that day. It is what they did before that day. It is just coincidence that is when they got the ban.
---
You are trying to argue that what scant story in the ENTIRE game is deep (it isn't), but I am specifically talking about the majority of landmark locations in the game that are mostly empty. The game lacks quest content, instead parading named locations as if that would suffice.
---
Bethesda really knocked this one well inside the diamond.
---
&gt;Award
---
They basically did this at level 50 anyway. We can only rearrange the nerfed deck chairs on the Titanic after level 50.
---
that dragon has a 38 bullet clip wtf. and shoots consecutively w/o reload. ummm /u/Ladydevann ?
---
I‚Äôm getting logged on now. JDBuckSavage.
---
Well, that doesn‚Äôt sound half bad. Streamlining NPC creation, so that casuals can make their very own NPC in a ‚Äúpersistent‚Äù world when you log off would be pretty damn cool. Too bad the world isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpersistent.‚Äù
---
~~They'd seriously need to fix server stability and redundancy.~~
---
Actually, more importantly, they'd need to implement GMs and live support so when you inevitability lose something you sent (due to lag or a sync issue) they can reimburse you. Because I don't see this working smoothly especially when newly implemented, IF implemented.
---
I like the idea though but I'm thinking a separate smaller shared account stash would work better. No easy in-game ~~gold~~ caps selling then.
---
A marketplace/auction house would be even better, maybe located at the Top of the World? But I'd see that quickly going out of hand and also exploited right away. But take the good with the bad I guess. QOL improvements are worth some of the bad imo.
---
Reported it, and included a fix, to Bethesda.

I'm level 122 and I just don't know what to do. I mean I guess I can farm... Materials? I mean I'm stacked on food, water and crafting material for armor and weapons. I guess I could... Farm for legendaries? But legendary enemies tend to drop garbage, and honestly it's just not that fun anymore. 
---
 Are you PS4?
---
Hey friend! This is great. I spent all day chasing this mystery for myself. Checked out the two shrines, they are indeed eminating "heat" waves. And they have fresh corpses in their piles. Checked out Lucky mine. I've been there before, but this time stumbled upon the Sleeper! Yeah that freaked me right out.
---
What's your theories on why they were drugging their own cult members?
---
In the back room, behind the spring, theres a big drug vat that dumps right into the water. Were they drugging their followers before revealing the Grand Truth, so they'd be docile before they Sleeper ate them? What's with all the jars around the corpses?
---
So many questions. Tons of fun tho.
---
It's sorta the same thing, but how about also not letting VATS target friendly robots (not to mention other players (assuming you have pacifist mode enabled))?
---
Yeah I am ps4
---
Same thing happened to me. Cant explain it, but I wont complain about the magical 4th level.
---
Neither of those mods can be learned from scrapping.
---
I was so excited when I got mine. My wife said I wasn't that excited when our children were born.
---
Can't agree more..
---
I thought of that,  but my character is disease free.
---
95% chance your friends were actually duping.
---
100% chance that they knew taking duped items was wrong.
---
They should get banned either way.
---
I am playing bug free much of the time after I got my ram oc stable
---
Didn't take any Rad-X.
---
 It's considered explosive damage,  so.... perk cards and dense mods
---
That's shitty game design - end of story. Are these people at Bethesda idiots? 
---
Yeah absolutely. 
---
The perk mod Im using on PC is must that should be in vanlla game. One set for hacking and locks, one set for crafting which I still need to adjust when Im crafting new parts. One set for normal fighting and one set for PA fighting. Then I have fith set just to heal radiation by radaway since I can't have streched genes all the time on.
---
Without the mod I could not be no where near as effective. 
---
I would mostly not open any hard locks, would not craft anywhere as often, and likely would not fight with and without PA either. 
---
Yes please to all. The hydro &amp; coal are perfect. Pretty sure I've heard of solar in other FO games as well. 
---
I have a theory...  
---
And reported it, I think it's related to how they structured the Excavator effect..   
---
[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - Power Armor - Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amsncf/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_power/)
---
I guarantee they‚Äôre not smart enough to dupe. And even if they did know about picking up they shouldn‚Äôt be after they dropped them in the river. 
---
Haha when I saw PA voice I immediately thought the Fallout 4 Sentinel AI Power Armor. And I was like oh, they even grabbed THAT asset did they?
---
Well there goes the idea of anyone being alive in those vaults huh?
---
You can always get rad worms again. For me it yoes back to super mutations.  So I just hit up whitesprings when rad worms wears off.
---
They had a full 24 hours total of beta time iirc. 
---
Go destroy some camps and be a raider
---
Right at the bottom of the map near the cabin there is a flat spot on the edge of a small lake.
---
Pretty sure it's a limitation based on the total number of plans the vendors can display...
---
I've noticed lately that sometimes a VATS lock will just not hit until I drop VATS and reacquire the target.
---
Tomorrow,  I'll be online all day pretty much (home sick) and I'm almost certain I've got them.  Message me or friend request me so I don't forget.  VillainesSarah
---
To be honest, while I doubt they're completely innocent, they're still stupid for picking the items up. It's not exactly secret that Bethesda is hefting the banhammer just now. If your friends left the supposed dupers be, the dupers would eventually be banned anyhow. There is no reason to touch their stuff that is not motivated by either greed or abject stupidity.
---
That said, I don't inherently doubt your honesty, either. After all, you were not banned, and so did not participate. I do, however, doubt the honesty of your friends. It would not be the first time some friend claimed innocence while being guilty as hell, and unless you literally live in the same room as them, you cannot possibly know that they are innocent outside of this occasion.
---
You don't have to be smart to cheat. Morons can follow instructions fairly well. But stupid people get *caught*, or even worse, cheat under circumstances where there is no way to get away with it. Why else can we see videos on the internet of would be bank robbers and thieves with completely unmasked faces in this age of digital observation?
---
My fav fallout game! (2, 3 and 4), but I am pretty excited to play 1 for the first time (maybe 2 again, it has been done time
---
While I respect your right to have an opinion I played all of those games on Xbox without any mods and had a blast.
---
Username checks out
---
The guy has been putting it to the gal, hard. 
---
If you can‚Äôt have a mole rat in a giant hamster wheel, then what is the point!?
---
Actually have a diploma in programming so a bit.
---
I know how you feel. Exploring with my friends was one of the absolute coolest things. My best friend and I bonded over Fallout so being able to play together was amazing, and for a time it was. It's just that we've done all there is to do and even just exploring has lost its touch due to bugs and bullet sponges enemies.
---
I got it, I got it all with serendipity too
---
Yeah it just made it stronger that's kinda dumb
---
Lets hear this wide variety of viable max builds then. 
---
Got a twoshot three star laser pistol. It sucked.
---
Not yet. Next BtV is tomorrow. They never offered an exact date, but implied it would be here soonish (as in some time in the next month). But no official timetable.
---
I dumped so much ammo into swarms at whitespring that I just fell back on melee to just swat them away. Play time probably gonna fall off this month waiting for content.
---
I've been playing 2 months, 8 hrs a day everyday. .  it isn't crashing every 10 mins. Played 8 hrs today. No crashes at all.
---
I've probably got another month left if I'm lucky. Thing is, if I put a game away, it's because I'm playing a newer one. Waiting for Far Cry. Had this game had more content released, I may well forget about Far Cry. But as it stands, I'll be giving up when it comes out, Once I put a game to rest I rarely go back to it..
---
I think so too. Beginners working on FO76 now. They don't want to give resources to a game that's not pulling in money. They probably want to fix the damage to the company by improving the new games coming out. If they bring out another failure, they're done.  
---
They also said all DLC would be free. Should be no need to buy.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why I need one, unless you have it already you‚Äôre out of luck, all you can do is upgrade it, not make a new one.
---
I do that too.  No one should have to leave the server to avoid fighting something that's been made unfightable. 
---
It's almost like there is a reason we're not getting content updates yet. Hmmmmmmm.
---
I've only ever got 1 but I gave it and 5 purified waters to a new dweller leaving vault 76.
---
Yep. Dude's a sadist. 
---
Same here. I really love Fallout but after the last 'update' needed a break. Playing RDR2. Really hoping things are better when I return to the wasteland.
---
I call it Cropdusting. I also call it bullshit.
---
Why is it ok for somebody to sink just as many hours into finding plans and receive a fraction of the amount of plans as another?
---
that's my point.  
---
some people sink 100's of hours looking and get what they need.
---
Some sink  few hours and get what they need.
---
Some sink alot of hours and get what they need.
---
Some sink alot of hours and never find what they need.
---
Its just statistics.  some people are just inevitably screwed by chance.  My point is to give an avenue to grind  towards specific goals while taking considerable effort.  
---
There isn't much of  market to begin with anyway.  
---
Nothing working for me tried everything multiple times I was right about to meet at the place to open the gate....
---
That is very kind of you, I'll send you a friend request now =)
---
Before the tse nerf and the whotespring xp and legendary nerf i played for a few hours a day now im playing about 2 hours a week
---
I guess you‚Äôre right. Well either way I know they dumped the bag because I saw the contents in the trade menu when fear showed me
---
heavily unlucky as they have like a 1/4th chance of having plans as they are counted as bosses.
---
Preach. They need to hire some of these modders to come in and show them how to get their fixes done right. It‚Äôs getting ridiculous how much better the people doing it for free are than the people getting paid to do it. Borders on embarrassing. 
---
 Nuka Girl loves helping folks out!  Added! 
---
This keeps happening to me. I log in, get in my power armor and I‚Äôm at 425 max. Get out, do some stuff, get back in and it‚Äôs like 320. No perks have changed, no buffs/diseases.

It‚Äôs super annoying and I can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs happening 
---
We are all Reek from Game of Thrones.  I hate collecting crap. Every time I run out of something I need, I groan because it means trudge, trudge, trudge looking for garbage like a hobo who can't afford a better game.

---
Thanks for reply.  
---
&gt;Either they have to competently intermingle 2 different systems or completely drop the current RNG system in favor of a system you prefer.
---
I stated that I prefer an intermingle system.  Leave the RNG as is.  But also allow an avenue to grind towards specific builds with enough effort. 
---
&gt;You may personally find it tedious, but you CAN grind until you eventually get the items you desire 
---
Honestly, you can not tell me you can grind until you get the items you desire.  Especially with how many combinations of effects on the number of different items there are.  I quickly counted 60 items and 23 different prefix legendary effects (I'm sure my count is slightly  off).  don't be silly that and say that you can grind for specific legendaries.
---
&gt;. Player trading isn't a ban-able offense. 
---
Honestly don't think you read the post and suspect you're a troll.  I said I have traded and don't mind it.  But its still another factor of RNG.  Finding the gear you're looking for is just as random as farming whitesprings.
---
What are your opinions on random events such as pet taming?
---
I have but I hope they fix it
---
It's a well known bug. Important lesson: Never spam click. If you click a little slower, you'll have time to see what you're clicking, because that stupid menu bug can happen damn near anywhere. I've dropped a legendary weapon that I was using by accident while disposing of .38 from my inventory menu, and almost sold my hard-won TS handmade.

They literally scammed us. Deplorable and unforgivable imo.

Does that mean if you buy all the cheap plans and make room the BOS will show?
---
Ive had same issue several times. I use excavator armor alot and it fluctuates often. Theres times it drops my carry weight 80lbs and i didnt fast travel or exit the suit. Ive also had my marsupial stop working and ive taken nothing to cause that. I can jump just fine than a few minutes later normal jump.
---
I think I quit toward the middle of November. Since then I have beaten RDR2, and I‚Äôm considering going back to Fallout 4.
---
I think the energy plants have some. 
---
Ok, I'm going to have to start locking my windows, too. 
---
I too debate on going back to FO4
---
If I log into game while wearing my excavator armor my carry capacity is 460. If I exit my armor and reenter my carry goes to 360. It's normally 260 without it.
---
They haven't lost their minds though. They behave exactly how regular miners behave when underpaid. :)
---
You can get in without a ladder. My camp is similar. You just run up the edges. Hard to explain easy to do. Found it out after I built my first. 
---
I disagree.
---
Killing a 3 Star and it dropping a crappy one star you think might be a good weapon is far worse cause the anticipation doesn't end right away.
---
You have to pick it up and inspect it. Then you find out it's garbage.
---
How so? That just fly around and strafe for a minute, land and breath fire a bit, and repeat until they crash land. It never struck me as ‚Äúformer rulers of world‚Äù level intelligence. 
---
I got mine literally first try 
---
Weapon artisan does stack with luck of the draw yes, luck of the draw is a luck perk though. Not sure about the fusion core thing I don't use those perks or energy weapons.
---
Again disagree, and I'm one of the people who's collected enough data to allege there is a seeded RNG and some are just luckier than others.   
---
  And I'm an unlucky *#*@&amp;$.   
---
But what I didn't need I traded, which resulted in allot of what I did need, and is a core mechanic of the game (even if it needs massive refinement)
---
**Regarding the "Market..**
---
Have to say this is unilaterally inaccurate, the various trading platforms "were" pretty active.   
---
Pre-"Black-Tuesday" I was beating people away with a stick for PA upgrades, Every single day....   
---
I advertised at best one a week on Reddit and got tons of word of mouth referrals.  
---
Charged "tips" only (what you felt was fair) if you had all the mats..   
---
Since "Black Tuesday".... 
---
One person.  
---
One.  
---
Even considering the lost player base due to last weeks rollouts... One person reaching out, vs. Dozens a week, reinforces a (in my opinion) both my points.
---
No, I get plenty from playing the game and 90% of the stuff doesn't appeal to me.
---
I had some amusing commentary, then realized it would be completely wasted here. Do yourself a favor, reader, just... don't bother.
---
Cool, thanks for the info.
---
It basically this.

You are probably talking about the power plant next to the lake. Those 3 scorchbeasts actually spawn their I have fought off them by myself.
---
Not from what I've seen from testing, it pulls the plans and that's what you have.   
---
So far I know of (1) person finding BOS plans on the vendors of all those I know looking, of any armor type 
---
Just died. 
---
Ahh, then this may not work out well for you, because I doubt it's going to get better within a month.

Missile turrets are the best

How were you able to kill him without him even initiating pvp?
---
To finish my trophy. Everyday I logged in there's an easy one at the front desk of the generals steakhouse.

i have weight and movement speed issues sometimes after i exit Ultracite PA. i unequip my armor before entering (does that even still matter??). it kicks in after i fast travel once or twice.
---
Red dress green nurses hat. Male, muscular.
---
To me seems about the same.
---
Bethesda specifically stated they watch for items received/picked up over a month, and it was quite a high number, so they either picked up a stupidly big amount, have been crusading (unwisely) against dupers, or (more likely) have duped in the past and you just happened to be on when Bethesda finally got around to them.
---
Potentially banana cream pies
---
I cleared it at 25. I was getting hammered at first, dying like 10 times in a row. My mistake was trying to use my bolt hunting rifle, since im vats rifle build. When i tried my hand made i just crafted, i killed the king on the first try easy. snipe the first one from a distance, and before he reacts to it, turns around and charges you, he already should have like 6 headshots, and should go down before he even reaches you. The trick was just speed on a higher rate of fire rifle. I think a combat rifle could work like that also.
---
Nevermind lucky there's new games all the time. Although I've played Fallout since the first. I'll play it again if there's another one..
---
Just tried this! Thanks! It worked like charm 
---
My camp is half that and i ran out of budget
---
I am arguing that quest content is not the same as story. The game DOES lack quest content and player driven narrative and choice, absolutely, and most folks are unhappy with that, reasonably so. But the broad statement of "no story" is inaccurate.
---
Big companies rarely throw good money after bad. Just how it works.
---
I also got a 4 but it was a glitch not from the magazines.
---
Mods. ^_^ 
---
Can we stop acting like people playing the game in a way it was meant to be played makes them a bad person?
---
A mic doesn't help much if you're deaf.
---
You get it from forbidden knowledge, but it comes with a BOS jumpsuit underneath.
---
That's my concern, not because of the actual content, but how the player base would react. If they toss out a quick "Here's another thing to do, now shut up" content update, folks will start to assume that will be all they do, and then things will go to shit.
---
Problem is, gamers being gamers, how many will blow through almost any new content in a day?
---
I don't understand the point in even making a new toon. I can change my appearance when I want, and leveling up I can change my perks over. There isn't an alternate ending to any quest line so why redo them? 
---
If people's complaints about other people complaining is bothering you...  ;-)

Change my mind 
---
Totally agree with you. The first time I fought one in this game was horrifying. It jumped about 30-40 yards and then chased me from Grafton Steel back to Morgantown
---
Sorry if you took that seriously, I meant it as a joke...
---
The amount of players with the achievement for killing at least 20 players is about 5% of the player base across all platforms. 
---
For them to add a hardcore PVP mode (Survival) means they're catering to 5% of their players. They're going to lose a lot of people unless they change directions. 
---
 Explosions were nerfed. That has nothing to with the large armor piercing mag.
---
End boosts hp by 5 per point, and decreases ap loss from sprinting.
---
That's not what I got from reading this exchange...
---
The friendliness and supportiveness i‚Äôve found in other players has been a real nice point of this game so far. i just started playing recently and am low level. I feel like this would work because people are helpful and seem to actively want to lend to the atmosphere of the game 
---
Game is just broken. And they don't even care. Greed blinds.
---
Well no global chat ensures the game will be desolated.  Probably the single worst design decision.
---
Doors automatically open when you go near them. Your shear skill rips the locking mechanisms from the door. 
---
LOL wow that dragon is nice.

&gt;I'm one of the people who's collected enough data to allege there is a seeded RNG and some are just luckier than others.
---
Enough data? it doesn't take but leveling a few characters past level 10 to notice seeded RNG.  go claim a workshop on 3 different characters and note the plans each gets.  repeated known plans for each.  Seeded RNG was apparent first week.
---
&gt; there is a seeded RNG and some are just luckier than others.
---
Literally proven my point.  Thanks.
---
&gt;Pre-"Black-Tuesday" I was beating people away with a stick for PA upgrades, Every single day....
---
I'm very happy for you. I'm glad you were trading in the prime time of FO76.  Let's focus on making it an enjoyable multiplayer RPG for all.  I want this game to succeed.
---
Yeah that's not gonna happen, just enjoy the game until they need it in the name of balance or some crap 
---
Good post, you make some good points.
---
I feel like the strength of fallout is that you can play almost any way that you like, be it power armor, or vast critical (my fav way to play fo4), melee... Etc.
---
When I an looking for something new I pick up a 'new' weapon and learn how to use it.
---
Shotgun with enforcer perk fun (esp in a nuke zone)
---
Bloodied pipe auto pistol: fun (and good for farming legendaries)
---
Swing speed boxing glove, fun!
---
Gatling plasma: fun (not that I will use it every day)
---
Bloodied Gauss rifle (OMG awesome, the first time i have gotten the hang of it)
---
Now I am lvl 160 with a bloodied melee build (my first in a fo game) and I am really enjoying sneaking past ghouls at Whitesprings and hunting  lvl 91 deathclaws, ect... And searching for screws so that I can mod my guass or whatever to my tastes.
---
So, maybe put the pistol down and pick up a pitchfork or something and the game will be fun again.
---
Road head?
---
Everyday just go places and hack
---
dEpLoRaBlE
---
Honestly, they just need to land faster, or even if provoked it should be their first action.
---
We need more border lands style rewards were it gets more insane the more you level up, but PvP fucks up any hope of that because of "balance"
---
I like when their attack makes an immediate hard right turn from their mouth practically passing thru their cheek to hit you.
---
I was just lamenting this very morning that I didn't buy the fruit hat when it was available.
---
Eh. I love the windmills. I always have 3 or 4 just for ascetics
---
I found it. Because I was looking mentally at the map in my head that the Interstate ran North-South in a valley, east of the tower, I went and got lost. It was south and that threw me. Thank you my fellow rebuilders.
---
Poseidon Energy has 2 on the front and a third on the top. 
---
This is great except the pacify effect doesn't stay in effect once you enter workshop build mode.
---
I have seen that happen on the odd run, maybe three times over the many many times I've run Whitesprings. It is definitely an oddity but I haven't actually seen it since the last patch. We're talking about it happening on one percent of my runs or less and I don't scrap/sell/drop until the end of each run so I would definitely notice.
---
I had previously noticed the times it did happen I was on laggy servers. I work with patterns and data analysis daily so I naturally pick up on things while playing but as far as the drops I can't say I see a specific pattern to it or a significant occurence. 
---
Hahaha, Playing Rust while reading your comment. You're so right.
---
I've been having a similar issue and can't seem to find them anywhere anymore. 
---
Shallow and pedantic. 
---
Make friends
---
Help lower level players level up
---
Hunt for rare items or easter eggs 
---
Wander through the different areas and try to tame some animals
---
Make a cooler base camp
---
Capture workshops 
---
Events
---
Make a name for yourself among the regular players
---
Collect the trophies (or whatever achievements go along with your game system) 
---
Hunt for Grahm 
---
Kill a wendigo in a clown costume
---
Find the many many many flaws in bathesda's code and report them
---
Farm legendaries and trade (if you're into that) 
---
Grind(if you're into that) 
---
Perfect your characters build
---
Make alternative builds for your character
---
Find clues to the unmarked quests (nuka paint for the t-51 is one, the may be others)
---
Pvp (if you're into that) (more fun with friends, workshops, pvp events) 
---
Find other ways to enjoy the game and let me know
---
No mouth harp, no accordion üò≠
---
It's too bad you didn't fight her before they nerfed the game into oblivion. Ranged weapons used to be useful.
---
THERE'S AN ACCORDION TOO??
---
Yeah, I hate PvP so much. So many good games ruin their PvE balance just to accommodate the PvP. It makes finding builds so unsatisfying because you never know when the build is going to be ruined by a patch.
---
Know how I know this game is dead?
---
No one has given OP gold üò≠ 
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea of my vaults being raided. This saddens me.
---
I remember playing the B.E.T.A And was like "This is amazing" Sure there were bugs but I thought Bethesda were purposely trying to break the game searching for bugs.
---
Then the game came out and it was basically the same. It hurts deep inside to think that I actually fell for it and paid full price for something that went 50%+ down in price only a couple weeks later. I just have hope that sometime in the future this will actually be playable on Xbox
---
So cool üòé 
---
I don‚Äôt remember what kind of wrench it was, but 1 star bloodied.
---
The plan pool is a little different then the legendary table, but I understand the point.  
---
No, your saying it's unfair and everything should be downgraded and made easy to get, thus making the whole challenge of getting the plans, and the specialization required (previously) worthless.  
---
I disagree, just like I think most posts complaining about the unfairness of not getting a TSE...   
---
Not to diminish you / your point, but it sounds like a "have not" complaining that someone else has a cooler toy, thinking 10 hours invested should count the same as the 300 hours the other guy has invested.  
---
Yes yes, your saying it shouldn't take 300 hours, and I agree many things were "too grindy" but they went way, way way too far the opposite direction and have made them worth less now.(two words, not one).  
---
What your proposing would in no way help '76, it would do the exact opposite.   
---
How do I know?   
---
Every person I knew who had one of the "golden RNG's" has quit the game, not due to bugs, or the patches, but because they got everything they wanted too quickly.   
---
The same mistake has been done in other games, and when you make things too easy to get,'they become meaningless, hell its a core part of human psychology.  Tell someone a bottle of wine cost $100 dollars and when they taste test 2 identical wines they say the $100 one tasted better because the perceived it as such due to the "rarity"
---
I am pretty sure that is exactly what they are is some kind of Raid system in which you earn rewards either daily or weekly or both for doing it with a group.
---
I'm rocking the spacesuit and the skeleton mask. 
---
Forgot the ability to break down ammo and craft different types
---
Like it‚Äôs underneath it or it comes separately with it?
---
"I NEED marsupial! Shit, Bethesda, fix your god damn game" says the guy shooting a glitched Dragon with 40+ magazine. Unbelievable.
---
I watched the same video. He started by saying it wasn't going to be a typical angry review everyone made for this game but proceeds to rant for the first 5 minutes about how awful the game is and called it a literal crime. In all fairness though the video is an hour long and he really dug deep into it and didn't gloss over all the positives just to double down on the negatives. I don't know why literally every YouTuber that makes a positive video about the game has to preface it with an angry rant that we've all heard a hundred times. Guess they just don't want to loose their street cred, but of you intend on making a positive video you can just say "hey since it's been three months of an onslaught of criticisms I'm going to respect your intelligence and not regurgitate everything you've heard many times before" and I'll understand. I won't forget everyone wants me to hate this game, I promise.
---
they are hiring in Austin apply fix the game for us. 
---
Naturally all anyone who wanders the wasteland wants is a screw.
---
Cant get bloodied and 2 shot
---
I have only seen him in watoga once me and my friend were around level 25 and we were having a hard time with the high level robots we were trying to find Phoenix because he wasnt at his usual spot
---
 Then we found him next to Grahm beating up a group of robots then a random player runs by trailing two assultrons we watched for about ten minutes as they killed what seemed like a never ending swarm of robots eventually Phoenix ran back to his spot and Grahms brahmin showed up and grahm sprinted at an insane speed out of the city like he left the oven on at home we attempted to catch up with him but his super human stamina and speed could not be matched. He ran towards big bend tunnel so we followed everything in the tunnel was dead. emerging from the tunnel and follwoing the train tracks we heard gunfire we found him in lewisburg comitting genocide on the local super mutant population we timidly walked up to him a giant green diety coverd in the blood of his enemies. He looked down at us and said you want trade? 
---
I just had rad worms, and i cleansed myself at the whitesprings fountain.   mutations seemed fine to me.  still hopped around like a kangaroo.  
---
Not exactly, I've found texture issues that have been UV mapping issues, Blue and white, and Purple and Neon blue.
---
I was highly skeptical at first as well. Nonetheless, I played it like I‚Äôve played any other Bethesda Fallout game‚Äîsolo and digging through every piece of lore I could find.
---
At first it seems a bit heavy handed with the simple tasks and long holotapes. That seems like it was mostly to introduce the mechanics of everything. 
---
All in all, I found that I really enjoyed the game. There is a story, and in my opinion it‚Äôs pretty good. It‚Äôs just delivered differently. It relies on the player actively searching for it and using their own imagination to get a vision for everything. That‚Äôs not for everyone, but I liked it quite a bit. 
---
Ultimately, if you accept the game for what it is and don‚Äôt hold a grudge against what it isn‚Äôt, you should find plenty to like about it. A good dose of patience when it comes to bugs helps too. 
---
Too bad no one's still going to be playing to try these out.
---
I bought Atoms to feed my camp obsession, but now I'm bored and am hardly playing now. We need new content.
---
I had always happened to follow some high level person, so while I'm sitting there at 26 just trying to get through the quests I'm having to dodge rockets.
---
The second example of plasma was supposed to be the radiation rifle. I know there are mods that add burn but make these inherent in the gun type and then make the mods do more damage or augment otherwise 
---
&gt; The BOS plans show as available on nearly all the vendors tables
---
Really? I've looked at the esm file in xEdit and the only vendors it shows up in are the Grafton Vendors (technically it's all Toxic Valley vendors, but those are the only two).
---
His tears are music to my ears.
---
Everyone is going to down vote you but most of us that can be impartial without needing to troll or cheat with a game to do well will agree with you. 
---
First I'm not suggestion in the least there is anything shady.   
---
The Seeded RNG is, as I understand it from the ModAuthors I converse with, generally easier to code in, but as a result has flaws to exploit.    
---
Those patterns are what I'm talking about, and I think with the theoretical seed some people fall on each end, but many fall right in the center, so have a more even spread.   
---
All I can suggest is track 3 to 6 WhiteSprings, every drop, tracking the weapon type, for armor also the Limb (R/L, arm vs leg) and the legendary Prefixes, and see if you see any clustering or drops in common.   
---
If you don't, it could be you fall right in the center sweet spot, or that I'm off base.  
---
Even with the amount of data I had collected I do admit it's a theory, hard to prove until the engine is fully decoded, but the 9 weightless armor pieces I got in 90 minutes the Monday before "Black Tuesday" reinforces my observational Bias 
---
I bought atoms, too, for the Christmas lights. :)
---
Do not regret.
---
I‚Äôm aware of that. Op was asking if the gun itself got nerfed. Not explosive legendary effect. My original comment was indicating that basic gun function was working as usual
---
Holy crap, I just spam these things because I love claw machines. Looks like I have a goal now!
---
I'm a bit divided myself. While low level, I thought they sucked due to the stated reasons. When high level, they are so easy. I'm not sure if it's just experience fighting the things or what, but I no longer find them difficult. I think there's a timing element involved. I'll just share what I know:
---
1. I carry a silenced gauss rifle just for scorchbeasts. I like it the most. Hunting rifles are just terrible ime. 
---
2. I hit and hide. I'm fully spec'd into stealth, so I can usually shoot them with my gauss rifle and hide. Shooting them will get their attention, and I simply wait for them to land. They will as long as you remain a decent distance away from them. 
---
3. Once they see you \[DANGER\], just dodge their sonic attack. Try to maintain s good distance. The spamming happens sometimes, but a lot of times it doesn't. I think stealth helps a lot because if they can't see you they can't judge your distance, and as a result, less spam attacks.
---
4. I hate that crop dusting crap.
---
5. Once they land, beat the hell out of them with a melee weapon.
---
6. Rinse, repeat if necessary.
---
They do have a bit of a pattern. The most important thing is getting them to land, and the best way I've found is to try your best to hold your ground and DO NOT FOLLOW THEM AROUND. I've noticed if you do, they will attempt to go into the landing animation then abort it. It's fine to square up on them to get some attacks in, but keep a solid distance and use ranged weaponry. It seems that when you are too close to them, they will spam the hell out of you with their sonic attack. By keeping a distance, they seem to get locked into a 'how do I attack this enemy mode' and back off, hence their chances of landing increasing. And this is why I carry a gauss rifle--it has a wider projectile that makes it easier to hit them when flying, as well as being a high damage rifle.
---
I hope this helps somebody. I know they can be frustrating when they start spamming.
---
Yes, much like life. A proper screw goes a long way indeed.
---
They‚Äôre scary.  Even if you make it on a roof they‚Äôll hide under ground until you come down.  And they hit hard.
---
My camp too! Howdy neighbor.
---
I did a few months ago. It's great!
---
I never came back. Maybe if they someday release an offline single player version? Who knows, I'm done playing the empty carcass of what could have been a good game.
---
Yeah I won't deny that everyone repeats the same arguments against the game. I guess I just like how he delivered those arguments more as context on what the game could've been, compared to what it is now. 
---
What really drew me to give this game a chance is that "what if" factor. I fully know that the game is now what it could've been and I don't expect that, but I still want to see what's there, and experience what so far I believe to be a great world that was created for the game.
---
Due north of Hemlock Holes there‚Äôs a plateau that gives an overlook spanning across almost the whole region. It‚Äôs where my camp was. There‚Äôs also multiple similar areas above the Garrahan HQ which have great views.
---
I love the idea &amp; consept of the game or how you say and probably gotten my money worth. BUT i have been playing video games since the late 80's and never have i played a game that gets my blood pressure up like this games bugs &amp;glitches. Still wish they would have taken more time with this game to make it even better
---
After the nerfs:  whats the point in farming legendaries anymore?   I would spend hours running around and doing that.  Started to get my double shots and explosive guns which made me happy, and then they nerfed the shit out of them and I could have just used any old rifle i found and done the same damage
---
Yeah, after the first "cluster" I have been on the lookout for more but admittedly I haven't really bothered recording the loot from runs in any detail. I'll do that for a few runs next time I'm in Whitesprings, currently having fun in the ashpit but due for a visit soon enough.
---
After following people‚Äôs advice on getting Fireproof, SBs have been much more tolerable.
---
I pretty much expect to have to being doing that with this story. From what I know of the basic outline of this games story it definitely does seem pretty cool. I just personally wish it was easier to pick up a holotapes and listen to it to completion without being paranoid that whatever I do stops it and I have to start it over again. 
---
Or mute. 
---
Or, you know, a human being. Because fuck voice chat. 
---
I'll look again the next time I'm at my desk, but the other day when I peaked it showed up on nearly all of them, specifically the Watago(friend was asking), but I often have a couple versions of the ESM open to compare changes when I'm curious, so could have looked at the wrong version and be mistaken.
---
I had good luck just south of Harper‚Äôs Ferry, on the other side of the river.

My friend went to DC after playing FO3 and was able to navigate the Mall on memory of the games map alone.   He said it was much more relaxing without the Super Mutants.

when a legendary spawns they glow green
---
Good read , thanks for posting it .
---
Ok, so I was gonna to post about it, but I'll do it here instead (at least for now).
---
So I heard you can get the BoS combat mod from scrapping combat armor. So I make a batch of combat armor left arms (light and lowest level). And to my surprise, "Recipe unlocked: Brotherhood of Steel" Only one problem...
---
It's not showing up as an option for anything I didn't already have it unlocked for. I had somehow managed to get the plans for the legs, so I'm wondering if there's a bug where it doesn't recognize it being unlocked through the plan, and I just happened to be unlucky enough (figures) that I unlocked the one I already had.
---
Other than that, Idt the type of armor I scrapped had any effect (but just in case I said exactly what I made). As I understand it, the recipes you can learn from scrapping are not part specific, which I verified.
---
So between what OP is saying, plus [what Aten_Ra has found out about], plus what happened to me, these are some important things Bethesda might wanna take a look at (/u/ladydevann?)
---
Upvote cuz Firefly...I should rewatch that
---
Also missing another drum. There‚Äôs one located outside Welch station but it‚Äôs not buildable in camps.
---
Btw here is a link to some photos I took to send to another author I was chatting with on Discord, before I did the end of December post arguing there was a seeded RNG.   
---
Until then I had kept every single legendary drop, and you can clearly see the clustering of limbs types, dominance of Left vs right etc.   
---

---
&gt; I often have a couple versions of the ESM open
---
Ahh, that's smart. I only have the current, and I didn't start poking around there until the last patch. I'm curious to see what you find out!
---
Words do not describe how much I hate these oversized rats with wings. They are the most annoying thing I've ever encountered in a game. I am not exaggerating.
---
If you want an actual survival/exploration/resource management/base building game, check out Don't Starve. It's base building aspects are quite fun, the enemies are varied and not buggy, each boss is very unique in it's mechanics. The lore is mostly confusing and convoluted, but it's the type of game that lends itself to lots of fun theory crafting (kinda like Isaac).
---
A dark alternative to that is This War of Mine. Can get quite depressing, especially if you end up in a scenario where you have multiple injured people and you only have 1 roll of bandages, or little food and someone needs to starve. Game has day/night cycle: during the day your characters rest and build their base, they eat, they can give each other courage if any of them are depressed. During the night you have stealth based exploration, where your goal is to collect as many resources as possible. Some locations have traders, others have soldiers/bandits that wanna kill you, and in others it's just you, prowling among the ruins of someone's life.
---
Yes,  the very way this game is designed makes it the total opposite of an RPG. Who would ever try to complete it multiple times? 
---
I'm not playing one character as the lone ranger, wandering the wastes, then the next as Butcher Pete. There is no point to incarnating different characters, engaging in different playstyles and behaviours, it's all just one garbled mess.
---
Every year of so I feel the need to play a new character in New Vegas, to start from scratch and engage with its world and progression. Meanwhile, in 76, starting from scratch just means you are level gated from everything.
---
Same issue. Log in while wearing 575lbs. Get out get in 475lbs. 100lbs different.  Something is off... Md it is not my weight...lol
---
Only the muzzle break, which is useless, because it comes pre-installed on all LMG
---
Duper.
---
Commonly reported with last weeks patches :(
---
 Many people are.  Most of them are melee from what I've heard
---
I actually have some kinda nice sets. I love swapping to hunters gear or to a troubleshooters. I like those mechanics, and made for a fun second playthrough, after my melee just smash everything in pa bata build. 
---
I wish I had more use for those mechanics. Mobile camps are great, but so is having a house. 
---
I had to artificially limit myself just to use the correct gear, instead of pa everything. There is plenty for a massive world here, but it got stuck.
---
The prison in the toxic valley has three terminals close to one another: one that opens a safe, one that opens the security storage room next to it, and then go through that room, open the exit on the other side (just a button iirc), go through, door will auto-close behind you and has another level 1 terminal next to it to open it again.
---
Then re-log, and do it all over again.
---
Wish I could rely on containers staying filled with my loot. Then I could have it be the end reward for a mini quest like one of the ‚Äòopen miners locker‚Äô side missions. Would be more fun than selling a one star legendary for a handful of caps
---
I remember when they had that water drinking competition on the radio and one woman died. There was some prize, and whoever held their pee the longest and kept drinking won. Hopefully they gave her next of kin the prize. 
---
lol we have to protect the crappy game! dude your literally doing what bethesda wants. they dont want the constant outrage cause if we have no where to vent then they wont listen anymore. if this keeps bringing thier public relations down itll make them fix the game cause if this causes more and more people to quit they will have to listen or just close the game down. they need to see that people are pissed and telling us to not be pissed when we literally have no other outlet is just censoring us. its like when people tell others to stop bad mouthing the president no we wont shut up.
---
Above red rocket mega stop is a flat spot.
---
In FO3 you could attempt to pick any lock and your skill level increased the "sweet spot". Also you had the chance to force a lock open, if you failed it remained permanently locked. I would love to be able to try and force a lock with more lockpicking perks and be locked out for 24h or so. 
---
Bethesda devs make me feel really good about my amateur "dev" work. 
---
Keep it up Beth.
---
Oh my word we need all the instruments
---
I agree on that, but how much of that play time was actually gratifying? How much of it was bullshit inventory management, chores and fetching stupid useless junk in the vain hope that, at some point, something actually cool was going to happen? That's certainly what got to me (I stopped at around 40 hours, 30 of which were spent overencumbered slowly walking to camp and navigating lagging menus)
---
Lazy devs do. You just have to have two definitions of something, one for PvP one for PvE. 
---
EQ2, as garbage game as it is, has had this for eons. 
---
Who knows. The teased it week 1 after launch. Then 2 months later they teased the pvp mode.
---
Alot of talk but no substance.
---
Doesn't help there is a fissure site relatively near that section of the map :/
---
Yes, I just tested it again for this week's challenge.  I had it correct originally, reverted it back.  Thank you very much!
---
The northern stretch across the toxic valley has lovely spots.  Many of the highways are good for camping.  Also,  just near Seneca rocks there's some cool places to watch the sunset. 
---
I missed a critical shot with my anti armor Gauss rifle that would have killed a scorch beast at 93% really annoying 
---
Wait, what are you looking for to see if you can learn it through scrapping? (assuming you're using xEdit)
---
Because I had a weird thing happen today. I had heard you could get it through scrapping, and (supposedly) managed to get it. Thing is, I couldn't actually craft it, at least on anything I didn't already have the plans for (I learned legs from a plan awhile back). I thought maybe it was a bug where it didn't recognize the that the leg mod had been unlocked and just happen to "unlock" it again, but now I'm just confused.
---
I understand and I think you may be right. 
---
As for the pet and other portions, I don't disagree with a more controlled way to tame low to medium levels, but deathclaws should be rare and hard as heck.  
---
I just responded to the plan / legendary portion because I specifically disagreed there.
---
Running around various places tonight with the Fortune Finder perk card active I found:  
---
stash under the right hand church pews in Kanawah County Cemetery
---
Inside the building directly East of the Charelston Herald
---
Inside the Eastern end of Overlook Cabin, inside a room with most of the floor collapsed, on a wooden shelf.
---
Tygart Water Treatment, atop the structure with the wooden defenses, North West side, on a walkway in a blue plastic crate.
---
Inside the red train car with open sides right near Grafton Station (towards town). Do the Grafton Day event real quick and kill/loot the 
---
Grafton Monster for another \~40 caps. This is a great spot.
---
And finally: Poseidon Energy. 1 in the little protest camp by the dry riverbed, and an average of \~5 more scattered various places on the roof. 
---
2 can also spawn in the cooling towers at the top of the scaffolding, but the steam will kill you quick if the plant is active.  
---
\^This netted me about 1k caps, but took me a few hours wandering around finding them, with the exception of Poseidon. Should be a lot 
---
quicker if I used this info and made a farming rout. Have fun!
---
It's probably not a guaranteed drop (it probably uses the leveled list for the toxic valley, which BoS plans happen to be in) but this is still very good to hear.
---
So the statues are named ‚Äúmetro man‚Äù in the game files which makes me think they are inspired by the robot in the 1927 film Metropolis. This doesn‚Äôt really add anything to the lore already mentioned although there are tons of relevant themes in the movie...
---
Why would be be in workshop mode near a hostile. pacify only lasts about 2 minutes.   
---
Tame lasts forever but you can only tame one animal and I don't think scorchbeasts are on the list.
---
I concur. 
---
I really hope they don't try to do traditional "raids" i.e. activities that take multiple hours to complete. This game isn't stable enough for that. People get DC'ed left and right when they're doing Nuke Silos and lose all their progress, imagine that but an hour into a raid. Plus I don't think Bethesda could pull off any sort of complex mechanic without it getting bugged to hell. Every raid would be plagued with instances where something you have to interact with glitching and your team can't progress further.
---
&gt;No, your saying it's unfair and everything should be downgraded and made easy to get, thus making the whole challenge of getting the plans, and the specialization required (previously) worthless.
---
Pretty I've stated many times it should not be easier, just obtainable. 
---
&gt;just like I think most posts complaining about the unfairness of not getting a TSE...
---
assumptions like this keeps concreting my opinion.  TSE was easy to get. 2.5K caps off Reddit. Easy. I saw how much they cost, saw how shit my luck is, traded the caps for it as I knew I could reasonably work towards that goal.  Easy.  
---
&gt;but it sounds like a "have not" complaining that someone else has a cooler toy, thinking 10 hours invested should count the same as the 300 hours the other guy has invested.
---
You still seem to have some pre-proposed notion of my opinion after skimming and filled in some backstory.  Its weird.
---
Never said I want somebody to play 10 hours and achieve the same as somebody who has played a few hundred.  If I have to repeat this again I'm just gonna stop replying.  Stop filling in backstories. 
---
 But I enjoy communication in order to keep this game alive, so I'll continue. 
---
&gt;How do I know?
---
Every person I knew who had one of the "golden RNG's" has quit the game, not due to bugs, or the patches, but because they got everything they wanted too quickly.
---
Maybe the people you know would be happier at a Casino instead of playing a game.  
---
What? 
---
Same. Played a decent amount at release. Slow and steady. Hit level 35. 
---
Then it hit me. The game really does suck. I was playing w my friend and it just hit us. We both haven‚Äôt played since. This was a month ago. 
---
And honestly, aside from all of the issues there are...the one thing that Just did me in was the engine. I can‚Äôt defend their engine. It‚Äôs decades behind and it‚Äôs not fun to find a weird angle so that the higher level enemy can‚Äôt kill me before I kill it. 
---
I feel like you should be getting better performance than that, are you playing in full screen?
---
A lot of those got removed. Most of the ones in the southern gatehouses still spawn. None of the northern ones, I think.
---
Oh...the chalk!  Victory!!
---
It fluctuates for me as well. 540-ish when I log in wearing the excav PA, 440-ish if I have to exit the PA and re-enter it.
---
&gt;and it was 655
---
That's me whenever I 'suffer' from Rad Worms at the moment, enjoy that bug while it lasts. Or stop using it, because it is an exploit, albeit it's one I basically cannot avoid as every mole rat and diseased ghoul in the game is hell-bent on inflicting it upon me...
---
I had to deal with that. I even left the server and came back to find that it was still there and getting in the way of my quests, so I said fuck it and wasted a bunch of ammo to take it down. Didn't get any good loot from it. Can you guess who was waiting on me the next time I had to go to that same area a couple minutes later?
---
Bruh same exact story, my best friend and I literally keep up through our nerd interests like superheroes, and everything video games. Getting to finally play our favorite series together has been a blast, and we still thankfully have a lot to do thanks to our lives being super busy.
---
Play a different game. Not being sarcastic, but sincere. 
---
But can you not see where that‚Äôs actually a solution? Isn‚Äôt it easier to nerf one or two characters instead of buffing five or six of them? I understand your point in the sense that they are making everything equally as weak instead of equally as strong, but come on dude. It still takes a team of people to complete and there are deadlines.
---
I give away crummy ones but keep good ones. Then when I meet up with similar level players, I see if they want to trade any. I‚Äôve gotten a handful of cool (and otherwise moderately expensive) plans that way. I like knowing that someone actually picked them up instead of just putting them in a suitcase and hoping they went to good use
---
It has something to do with the way it tracks holotapes in your inventory when you have a lot. You are picking the right one but it is triggering another. I dropped all non-quest holotapes into a nearby container and it worked. Stash is safer even
---
Really quite annoying and I guess they will get a fix in eventually but the workaround seems to do the trick.
---
Extremely rare 
---
16 times the retail
---
Awe shit i paid 1k off a pal on the market place 
---
&gt;I don't disagree with a more controlled way to tame low to medium levels
---
atleast we can can agree on something
---
&gt;should be rare and hard as heck.
---
this is my concern.  What is Rare?  Left up to RNG?  or my ability to play, or grind, or perform in the game?
---
Extremely often infact, its like they poach there dead buddies and use it to fight you before being blown to bits themselves.
---
Land mines are your friend. 
---
And Ive also never once topped it up with ammo
---
a group of 10 of us did one, got 5 plans and some legendaries. loot lag wasn't obnoxious like a few weeks ago when 20 people would show up.
---
did a second with only 1 other person, finished with 8 minutes to spare, 5 more plans, some legendaries. almost zero loot lag.
---
still haven't gotten an ultracite left arm, or ultracite calibrated shocks. I think i have every prime plan now, finally got the gauss prime plan.
---
I‚Äôve heard Watoga mirrors this, but I know Harper‚Äôs Ferry will have *1* sturdy/heavy combat armor plan when you visit. It‚Äôs randomized.
---
Not sure about BoS mods post-patch.
---
Thanks!! üòé
---
&gt;get quests from other players
---
now that is a good idea
---
player 1 can give hunting quests and player 2 can give scavenging item quests and a player can only have one or the other and can switch them out just like perks
---
The trick is to not be an obsessive clearer, if you do everything there is and explore every nook and cranny thats kind of it. When I did that for Fallout 4 thats what made me put it down forever. (from like a year a go until now lol). So for me the trick is to kind of just go with the flow for each character, fully choosing to leave stuff left for me to find a new each time. New Vegas was my first game and I was able to do tons of characters because each time I would find something new along my path to find benny and then choose a new faction to go with, giving tons of character replayability. Here when theres litterally no story branching it all comes down to how much you've seen. 
---
I think you might have to unlock "lighter build" first. I know that this is the case with the under armors -- you have to purchase "treated" and then "reinforced" will be available.

Melee weapons only, and automatic melee weapons (chain saw, ripper, buzzsaw, drill) get MASSIVE boosts when overrepaired. They‚Äôre actually semi-viable weapons until they get back down to ~130% (bonus damage degrades relative to overrepair)
---
Also armor/PA get bonus DR only(no ER)in a similar fashion.
---
This moment is all there is.
---
It is represented by a sliver on the clock dial, but it lingers like the sound of a gong.
---
There is no past. There is no future. Only this moment.
---
All my melee damage flew out the window randomly. Not sure what happened or when exactly it happened, but it sucks pretty hard to lose 120 damage off my go to melee weapon.
---
What platform are you on?  
---
The servers I played on on PC have been more full than Ive seen them for a little while
---
Have this issue with the atomic shop version but only that one can't seem to fix it
---
In my old Camp back in the days i removed the foundation on the first floor of my house to have Betsy live there safely within the walls of my house. In the end i replaced Betsy with two missile-launchers hidden behind the stairs leading up to a dead end.
---
Right on the highest step i left a candle and something that was going to tempt the intruder into the line of sight of Avenger#1 and Avenger#2. 
---
Even left the door with a level 0 lock
---
but nobody ever came.
---
I can speak for my 100+ hours and say most of it was exploring and discovering great stories. YMMV.
---
Im pretty sure there was a few people who launched a nuke during the Beta
---
looks very nice
---
Fuck, I didn't even realize they had their own battle music.
---
They were obtainable, even with crappy RNG's, they needed to work on the drop rate, I've argued that, but it was more than possible, without exploiting, before we go down that rabbit hole.  
---
The TSE portion is a flawed example, the only time (and I rarely saw them that cheap on the PC side of the market) was due to duping, their rarity artificially turned into a common item. Using a dupped item as an example to reinforce the opinion I don't think helps.  
---
I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, or make assumptions, I'm referring to the numerous posts the sub's seen where people are upset they've not (and there are example of this if you look hard enough) looted an explosive weapons after 15 hours played, etc.  Hell people have complained about not finding enough bobble heads and magazines.  
---
As for the people who quit, it's not about that, it's the who point I was trying to make about the psychology around "rarity"..   
---
People are stoked to find in '76 what was a common garbage outfit in FO4, because it's rare, and hard to get, people are excited about it, and it makes it "of value".   
---
When you remove that, artificial or not, "value" by making an item easy to obtain through caps (or coins in other games) alone, it's no longer going to give the same endorphin rush, resulting in less overall satisfaction.    
---
Other games have done it, and the result is never positive, because it results in a "What next" problem.  
---
New content is the knee jerk response, but new content is harder to add than people generally understand. Hell I honestly think half of '76's problem is they didn't do a closed beta with any hard core gamers, and as a result they were completely taken by surprise by the number of people who hit 100, let alone 200 in the first month or two.  
---
By making plans and legendary a common, even if a little grindy, you remove all of the larger positive emotions and "treasured" feelings people get through the natural discovery and challenge to obtain. 
---
Hope you appreciate this https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/68788423
---
I really like it. I'm sorry you don't, though. 
---
I have a similar concentrated/gun fu VATS build, but it's a sniper build based on stealth. I generally do chain headshots, because I can one shot most things that way. But when I'm fighting a lot of high level ghouls and want to cripple their legs (because a head shot isn't quite enough) I can see how it's difficult to switch between left and right legs to get the better percentages (if they're not facing me or are partly behind cover). 
---
I think it might be a thing you just have to get used to. It threw me at first too but I adjusted pretty quick. 
---
Odd, since I've heard of people saying it works, plus my experience (imo) indicates that it should at least be *possible* to learn through scrapping.
---
Make friends with a deathclaw! Seriously though, most people in this game are awesome. Great community.
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/68788423
---
Yes I thought so. Thankfully I just got the multi-shot canister from Phoenix tonight which makes the Broadsider pretty awesome.
---
 He was shooting me in the back while I was selling doing slap damage. That's how the whole thing started 
---
That's the problem. I've been on a break since a couple weeks before the TSE Nerf patch.
---
I was wanting to now play with a melee build. I've never played with a melee build. Where is that meme of the guy saying "right this time I'm a 2 handed tank" next picture stealth sniper. "Damn". That's me. Always want to do tank, always SS. TES, Fallout....
---
But after being in FO76 again and killing a couple of ticks and a stack of scorched in melee I couldn't bother to do more. I went back to BF5 to Bren Sniper Breakthrough. Something I've done hundreds of times before but still find enjoyment in mowing down a failed flanking attack or blowing up a cheeky AFV. I've got only a few hours less in BFV than FO76. I'm still enjoying BFV. FO76 is a chore. Nothing new for a 2nd character, not able to XP farm Whiteland to skip the grind. 
---
Anything that gives an above average bonus, unusual mark of status, or of above average value.   
---
Mega sloths aren't awesome in combat, compared to Yau Gai(spelling?) or Deathclaws, but people want them for the look and difficulty to obtain.   
---
Having a Deathclaw, one of the combat beasts not only gives you "status" among your peers (until you make them commonplace) but also nets a fantastic defense bonus to your camp. 
---
Xbox the last few days has felt very empty. I frequently browse the map looking for something to do and see very few dots. 
---
I don't know? None of the community patch notes indicated a change to those fields. I'm not a modder, just a guy who saves posts.
---
the market is saturated with games there is no reason to make compromises. No bugs, not mtx, on "online only" or no sale
---
1/500
---
so .02 if my math serves me right.
---
it selects 2 numbers between 1/1000 and then it rolls, if it's one of those 2 numbers, you win the pie. I got  my pie not too long ago as well, maybe 3 total in fo4, and 1 in fo76 now. every time I see one, I try of course.
---
I'm not that smart I'd be the dummy stuck in a trap camp lol!! Sounds like fun either way tho!!!
---
They aren‚Äôt going to sell any more copies. Fo76 should already be on maintenance mode. The only reason it‚Äôs not is because it is a complete piece of garbage, hardly worth salvaging. 
---
The crybaby loot cave farmers will get upset that some jerk killed a legendary ghoul before they got a chance to tag it.
---
Thanks for the write up! Great job!
---
I had a level 40 come and use my workbenches and noticed he started getting a bounty.  Didn't see him destroying anything so I thought it was an accident.
---
  Then I hear an explosion because the fucker took out my fusion generator and ran for it.
---
  Ended up fast travelling ahead of him and catching him with a dozen scorched on his tail. Hit him with All Rise and took his bag.
---
  Turns out he had a lot of weird shit on him, like he gathered his stash at my stash box before he ran.  My assumption is that he thought he was stealing my stash but instead took his own stuff, which I then collected off his corpse.
---
  Then I switched servers and made about 600 caps bulking and selling his crap.  Thanks dude!
---
Yep. I left my game running while I ran to the store once. While I was gone, a friends 3 year old played with my controller.
---
Bye-bye "All Rise"
---
Lesson learned.
---
I have this issue too
---
He's Danny Phantom!
---
You have melee dmg mutations and radworms by any chance?
---
I second the "phone a friend" option. I probably died about 20 times on this quest too, I finally got my spouse to go with me even though he'd already done it and having an extra person helped a lot. I still died a few times but he was able to sort of hold the line, he revived me a few times but once or twice I had to re-enter the cave but nothing respawned because he was still inside. 
---
Mods are one time use modifications.  If you get the plan you don't need to get another mod.  Im not sure how many you can learn for the meat hook but try crafting a few and recycling them.  You may learn what you are looking for. 
---
Same here.
---
The armor mods learned from scrapping seem to be broken since last patch. I've "learned" a bunch but NONE of them show up as craftable. I've been very confused about it.
---
Maybe you should make a post about it since I've not seen anyone else mention it and it is definitely happening to me as well.
---
Where is that?
---
The mods are a one time item. If you remove the mod it cannot be used again. The only way to get that mod is to buy it again.
---
Yeah but when he was at his base when the whole thing starts. I don‚Äôt assume you had that pvp initiated all the way back to his base 
---
You start off with one in each special right from the start.  That is 7.  You also start from level one and only get a point up to 50. That is an additional 49 points. 7 + 49 = 56.  Not 50.
---
oh man i do this shit all the time. its so fun. i ask for food and if they dont comply i beat the life out of them for caps
---
I still disagree with you and have come to the conclusion that you might just fall into the luckier side of the curve based on your arguments.  You talk about how TSEs were obtainable as if they were common loot.  As if you wanted to try a TSE build , then did anything different from farming other legendaries.
---
&gt;you remove all of the larger positive emotions and "treasured" feelings people get through the natural discovery and challenge to obtain.
---
Again shows we are on the other side of the fence.  I treasured the first time I went underneath the mothman museum.  I treasured the firebreather's questline and received a scorch-killer's pistol.  Damn, where did I get my Furious 50 Cal?  Can't remember.  Oh well, back to farming whitesprings i suppose.
---
did Not
---
huh?
---
Thanks.  Checking now to see if I can craft meat hooks, should be no problem then.
---
japes
---
&gt;Mega sloths aren't awesome in combat
---
Disrespect George again....
---
i play an unarmed npc named hector where i ask people for food as a quest and then beat them up regardless of if they give some or not
---
its all in good fun

I found the arm plans I think the watoga train vendor

what was the change..? i dont play riflemen, so i dont know this stuff.

what a brilliant and innovative idea! Executing it on the other hand could be very hit and miss
---
Ok, ok...  
---
No disrespect so George, but I've seen them felled by Feral dogs and Molerats, I can't say the same for the Deathclaw.
---
LOL, massive TD1 fan myself. I divide my play time during the week between FO76 &amp; TD1. I know your post is suppose to controversial but to me those 2 games consume all my available game time :).
---
I am late to TD1 so will delay my TD2 purchase until a little later.
---
I was wanting to do the story deeper. One of my friends was all about rushing through so I missed a bunch of lore and my 2nd was meant to be pretty much solo so I could enjoy the story more but meh. 
---
Grab  marsupial, bloody mess and a big fucking hammer, try to run jump and hit on landing, if you get the timing right they explode when you land, never gets old
---
Are you able to kill them while you're being tickled though? If so, which weapon are you currently using. Please be specific. I need a reason to continue playing this game. ;-}
---
Bulk items at the tinkerer table with molded plastic. I find it good practice to keep 5-10 Bulk of every material 
---
Sometimes melee chars can hit my turrets some time, before they start reacting. I've tried to build spotlights but it's just not working.
---
Weird, because in my case it was only the BoS plans that didn't show up (though I didn't keep track of everything I unlocked, but it looked like it most or all was accounted for).
---
RNCrom
---
No thanks. If they didn't change the ttk on the game, it is moving from one bullet spongy game to another worse bullet spongy game. And Ubisoft is still Ubisoft btw, there is likely a lot of bugs and glitches in the beta.
---
Congrats
---
Downvote for human npcs... Humans are players - Bethesda made it clear many times. Want them to atleast keep some promises true. Environmental story telling is top notch in fo76. Npcs can be robots, ghouls and supermutants, forget humans.

Lvl 41 here. Haven‚Äôt started the BOS questline.

Every time I try to take down a SB I barely do any damage. With a hardened lever action, from hidden, with 2.5x damage bonus. 
---
I‚Äôve taken down lvl 80+ glowing deathclaws and muties... what gives?
---
I‚Äôm thinking at this point there is something I‚Äôll get during the main storyline that will give me a buff against them. If so no need to spoil it for me...
---
Oh, that's not the worst, believe me, killed one of these bats yesterday and the corpse disappeared without touching the ground. 
---
Take stuff out 
---
The problem is I have. I've been off since pre TSE Nerf. Playing Escape from Tarkov and BFV. Came back to FO76 killed a couple scorched and was like meh. Probably didn't help that a lot of loot was recently cleared out so I wasn't finding anything but also wasn't really looking for anything besides food and water which I could find. 
---
A separate community stash (with weight limit) is an amazing idea. I love it. It would definitely alleviate some that early game grind for resources. I think it should be global, like a regular stash.
---
I had one for a entry into my camp, you jump on the edge of it as it's turning and it lifts you up

I think they are levelled. Normal turrets aren't so bad but if some high level player/s got made them spawn they can have explosive rounds. Nasty. 
---
And Harpers ferry is pretty popular place to make quick visits. Sometimes when I got the time, if I see few good legendaries there, I will kill them, then go wait on top of buildings for next player to come and reset them. Shame most players just visit the vendor area, it won't reset the church enemies.
---
Still no bethesda reply....
---
Thanks.  Any idea where to find the meat hook plan?
---
Ohhh... Thank you!
---
Nice, gotta go check that out. Worth traveling to from Vault 76, since you will potentially get much more out of it than the travel cost.
---
Exactly. Annoying to fight, you're wasting a shitload of bullets, half of your weapon inventory is broken, you use a gazillion stimpaks, and you get nothing in return.
---
I did that in my main. I've explored a super large percentage of the place. I did rush a couple of story quests that I was intending to replay and enjoy the story mode more but found getting to them was more drag than reward. 
---
Whatever makes you happy. I'm just giving you the why
---
Any rooms with nukes there. I said drop GT so I can join in looking to smash some skullz 
---
super mutant neighbors at the next house seems friendly atm

No worries. You're easily amused I get it.

You're using way too much logic for these clueless game designers.
---
ROLLING PIN MASTER RACE
---
So much interesting in one comment.. 
---
First, they did address the bullet sponge issues.
---
Second, I find both of your comments extremely ironic. You are opposed to D2 because of TTK and glitches in a beta, yet you're willing to pay FO that has horrible TTK on SBs, and is still riddled with glitches 3 months after release. 
---
To each their own, I suppose...
---
\-Crickets- from Bethesda, no doubt, on this subject. 
---
&gt;I've been playing 2 months, 8 hrs a day everyday.
---
Out of sheer curiosity, how do you have the time to do this?
---
No, I've yet to loot a TSE, and I've only got (3) explosive weapons (all garbage) in 320 levels on my main, sometimes running (3) accounts at the same time in WhiteSprings.  
---
I spent an entire 8 hour day tracking Watago vender interactions, 200 counting both accounts I used, and got (1) non-tier 2 or lower power armor plan (T-51b 'shocks).  
---
TSE's?   
---
They were obtainable because I watched those around me get them, sometimes more then 3 in a single multi-hour WhiteSprings run, was I envious?   
---
Sure, but since I'd never use a TSE in the first place because they suck the life and challenge out of the game, I wasn't too worried. I did perfectly fine farming WhiteSprings with a dagger.  
---
 The people relying on TSE's did themselves no favors IMHO, again an argument about how removing the challenge and difficulty, and "trying a TSE build"... With full ranks there is no "try", it's a deliberate choice to street sweep,'I get the desire to try it at least once, but for all intents and purposes there is no need to actually "test a build" because previously "It Just works" was very true of that combo.   
---
We aren't on the other side of the fence  at all, your comments about those items you treasure prove my point, because once they are "a sure thing" they no longer are treasured, he'll people value the quest rewards less (generally) because of exactly that.  
---
I carried my 2 shot black powder rifle (level 15) I got around 25 until it was eaten by a glitch around 250... I stayed a melee build, never took rifleman perks, because it was fun to use when closing and that was good enough, I loved that freaking thing, not just because it was one of my first Legendaries, but also because it was AWESOME at the time.
---
First thought
---
Haha
---
At least they don't spam radiation on you. I like them much better than bloated ghouls.
---
After spending way too much time in FO (I had some friends that joined late, so I hung around), I'm welcoming the change. Currently playing KH3, but looking forward to getting back to a multiplayer game that (hopefully) works!
---
You don‚Äôt need the Meat Hook Plan (that let‚Äôs you craft a new meat hook from scratch), you need the Extra Hook Plan, that lets you craft the modification you want.
---
One option is to scrap a bunch of Meat Hooks, each time scrap a weapon, you have a chance to learn a mod for that weapon.
---
Otherwise keep checking vendors, I don‚Äôt know if a specific vendor that carries that plan.
---
Level 40 Megasloth loses to nothing.
---
We are literally playing a different game.  My bad, I'll try to find the FO76 forum.
---
Had the same thing happen to me as well, I killed the queen and it gave me 2 stims, an Assault Rifle (non legendary) and what do you
---
5 HARPOONS!
---
Maybe it is a glitch that's going on, the traits you are talking about were present in the SBQ I fought as well, animation and glitching to different parts quickly. 
---
Good to hear. I built there once and the neighbors would always invite themselves to my parties.
---
Use fist weapons (one 3* damage card only - no fists in PA though) and take reduce chem weight and junk weight
---
Carry stuff with you (beware of junk, obviously)
---
Yes, could be... But it's most likely the rad worms disease bug ;)

Haven‚Äôt watched the video yet, already amused though. ü§ó

---
Im not whiteknighting here, but balancing a loot table out can be very tedious. Yes it should absolutely have been done by now. Reading through the comments reminds me of modding 7 Days To Die. It was a HUGE mod. I had to rework and write new loot tables. Believe me when I say that it was nothing less than a nightmare to properly balance drops - especially rare items. It was a long back and forth seesaw that either dropped far too few or far too many until it was eventually juuust right. 
---
I have no idea if this engine works anything like Unity, so I cant say that is the issue a lot of players talk about. Its likely to be bugs or hasty slap together bits of code with F76. Just sharing my own experience trying to balance massive loot tables based on enemy types and rarity of loot. 
---
Well, we were doing seek revenge before he fast travelled. Not sure where exactly in the incident he started the film. 
---
I see red name,  I kill (or at least attempt to lol).
---
Yep, have that all the time :(
---
Technically speaking, true. As long as I don't drop every 15 minutes, I'll consider it a major upgrade. Even if I do, at least it's a glitchy beta, not a glitchy fully released product...
---
Lol maybe George was the exception. ;).   
---
Or the sloths I encountered were the "runts"
---
Store/sell all junk
---
Spend all caps on plans/mods
---
Go wreck the big, fancy camps and kill people - all for free
---
Right, but if I could craft them I'd likely get the mod when scrapping them, not a super common weapon.  Thanks.
---
Yes, perk loadouts are already a mod.  They should be part of the game already :)
---
Also have the saved loadout name come up on your main HUD just like in the mod please :)
---
Oh yea because moving from one heavy glitchy game to another potential glitchy game is " the biggest QOL update that any FO76 player can ask for".

Wow thanks Granny! You‚Äôre swell! 
---
Sorry I killed your cat in that one place that one time. 
---
Generally it's an error that will go away in time.   
---
If your on PC kill the game and the BethNet launcher, make sure it's not in task manager, and then restart the launcher, log into the hame and see if it syncs.
---
If you are on ps4 we have like a thousand amazing games to choose from. I have such a huge backlog of dope titles.

Stacking power cores... It's a good thing.

You're assuming one is glitchy in a beta vs knowing the other is glitchy in full release. Aside from that though - there's a storyline, a loot system that actually works (based on TD1 experience), and more to do than login - sell junk for caps - hunt down legendaries that don't drop anything worthwhile - scrap items - rinse - repeat. 
---
Had this the whole week and already did what you said, not just to fix the bug, but also to play the game since it crashes and I have to manually close the game and the .net launcher to launch the game

The future starts when Bethesda abandons this dumpsterfire and the modding community makes a game out of it as usual.
---
While I'm sorry he's dead he wasn't mine, he was Steve's... and he drove my Bostie Bonkers!
---
2/10 not going to go crazy with the review but I personally didn't like it, constant bugs and that power armour bug that still haven't been fix from fallout 4 and the no damage bug, I played it for about 50hours total (nothing major) and honestly by that point I felt like I'd done everything the game had to offer and I've moved off it now, maybe if they knuckle down some serious good content (highly doubt it) I may come back.
---
I just want a singleplayer Fallout tbh :(
---
Yeah i think so, bc i can do all that stuff in my pace, build beautiful workshops in every location, build a nice camp, launch Nukes and have fun.
---
Idk about the queen tho. 
---

---
And Grahm is Cookie Monster, after being heavily irradiated.
---
Personally, I feel this has been a cop out from the beginning. Not sure if they wanted to save money on voice overs or animations or writing for the npcs.
---
The game feels empty. Period. 
---
It's just stretching our suspension of disbelief to the breaking point to expect us to assume literally no human survived for miles around. Or that no human traveled through West Virginia at this time. The lack of non-vault dwellers is just not plausible. There would be other people in the world, plain and simple. And asking us to believe that literally *every human* was turned into a Scorched is silly. If we are to believe this, then how come us the players haven't been turned into a Scorched yet? Makes no sense. 
---
They wanted us to fill in for npcs and that plan backfired. 
---
Or perhaps they're insulting our intelligence by believing that we wouldn't be able to tell the different between a human npc and another player.
---
Does it roll every time? Or every spawn in it preloads 
---
*FOS-ROH*....
---
If you're already in your PA when the game loads it gives an additional 100 carry weight. It's a glitch. If you hop out and hop back in it goes back to what it should be. Found out the hard way getting stuck and unable to fast travel after having to exit my PA to complete a quest. 
---
Go cry about it some more. The only reason you‚Äôre here bitching about it is because you can‚Äôt one shot literally everything. 
---
No they banned the smart people that figured it out so they cant figure it out again. But yes it still exists
---
That's just a waste of plastic.
---
Claiming workshop cost over 30caps, fast travel is 5-60caps, Not much profit in this. (If you are not brave enough to kill level 150+)
---
Nuke mines
---
Still gotta lotta gunpowder if you want some, idk why I get so much. 
---
What does it matter? I get all my plastic from others. Lol
---
Fair point. 
---
Sold, now Vibroboy can stalk the wasteland
---
Sort by spoil, at least it puts any food/drink with a CND meter to the bottom.
---
1.1k for longshoreman
---
Drop ammo you'll never use at train stations.  Mini Nukes, missles, etc. weigh a lot, can't be sold and are pretty useless.  Same with chems, no reason to have 25 Psychotats or whatever if you don't use them; sell them to vendors.  Fusion cores are pointless if you aren't using PA.  Even if you are only keep a few around.  Not sure where you are in the game but I'm about to dump all my ultracite.  It's heavy as hell and of no use to me, I can always get more.
---
They did NERF the screaming, the last patch brought it back. I can up against one the other day that screamed continuously till it died, as a melee player with a gun that does SFA damage it took a while.
---
Open your Pip-Boy, go to Data.  Now uncheck a few of those objectives.  Thank me later.
---
mole rats are subterranean cliff racers
---
how could I know if he was the exception?  Game has locked me from finding another pet. :)
---
Because it's a waste of time bulking anything other than Lead or Aluminum for weight reduction. Zero point, unless you're going to sell it.
---
1400 free caps a day doing rounds selling to vendors
---
Wait what is frame my man's?
---
If grape are the ones that give better prices then yeah I mean those
---
This is Shrek's car
---
Hey man, if you're still looking for that blade then let me know. I can craft you a new one, same with the handgun and device.
---
I just mean that as a mostly solo player, it's a pain in the butt to swap multiple cards to craft armor, or ammo, or just to cook.  
---
So Fallout76 doesn't have a storyline? And don't tell me you assume the Division 2's storyline will be way better without even touching the game once. And there are issues with the loot systems in Division 1 too.
---
Keep weapons and armor to a minimum. Bulk and sell excess junk, a general rule of thumb is to keep stacks of around 200. Look through and sell excess junk that you *can't* bulk. No ammo, either carry that on you or drop it.
---
Oh boy another week of entitled know it all‚Äôs that whine all day on Reddit!
---
power armor frames, aka chassis
---
&gt; I find it good practice to keep 5-10 Bulk of every material
---
Yeah, well the OP is asking about stash size not maaking caaps. You KEEP 5-10 bulk of every material. For what? Because you like many think it reduces weight when it doesn't. When you are informed you downvote and talk about getting plastic from others and selling 1400 caps a day. Yeah well that is a lot of gathering for 1400 caps a day. Seems like you're a slave to the vendor bots. But you do you.
---
FO76 had one of the worst story lines in any game I've played. Yes, I assume TD2 will be much better, because it can't be much worse.
---
So, I dont get it... I must unknowingly have the perfect perk setup. I took out 2 level 80 SBs today solo. They did spam me but I just kept blasting them with my instigating .50 cal until they landed, dump a bunch of AA shotgun blasts into them to stagger them then finished them off with AA Grog axe. My PA rarely takes much damage from them. My perks are mostly around the SG, my primary weapon. I use max Demo and White Knight, Incisor but nothing too exotic. Level 112, but I've been actively hunting SBs since about level 70. Oh, PA is X01 with targeting HUD and reactive plates. All my PA and weapons are at 200% repair for the most part. As soon as they drop below 100, I repair back to max... so again, I'm not sure why this build, fairly haphazard,  does so well against them? 
---
That's not the fault of Bethesda, it's Sony. To play online it's mandatory to have PS plus. 
---
This is stupid lol. Bye
---
Whats worse is they just spam it.
---
Bloodied sneak vats crit snipet would be the most efficient imo. My 1* bloodied combat rifle one shots everything that's not a legendary or bigger guy. All super mutants lvl 68 take 1. Scorchbeasts lvl 50-80 take about 4-6. Mirelurk queen takes 5. So this build does insane damage, but you get destroyed in one hit, especially during SBQ as you're sub 20% HP. Flagged non-PA players take 1. Flagged-PA takes 1-3. To maximize this build, you need unyielding.
---
Example: 300 (wep base) * 3.5 sneak * 1.4 better crits = 1470.
---
Adrenaline would increase the damage as well. 
---
Man they just need to add new end game enemys  add Cazadores or up the spwan rate on behemoths.
---
I dont waste a single percentage of budget on turrets. I was so excited to get home defense 3 to get rocket turets then pure disappointment for about a month just hoping they would be worth their 12% budget, but no... I'd rather have a nicely decorated camp.
---
Omg can I just kill myself now. 
---
Yeah.
---
Well... At least you're smiling? 
---
Through the door. Punch through the door. Lockpicking now requires strength above 8
---
Ahhh snappp
---
I‚Äôm on now if you have time. Still need it...
---
You need to level up some, or bring a friend or two. 
---
It all went back after some time passed. At this point I'm assuming it is a glitch. 
---
Entertaining. It makes me want to do more PVP. I did grab someones ammo factory today with my chameleon character. The owner showed up in full excavators power armor. He had about 200 pounds of scrap on him. It was pretty comical when he died. He kinda just slowly toppled backwards onto his back.
---
And the fuck do you do in game after all that time?
---
I dont really mind
---
If you really can't part with anything in your stash, then you have to mod all the equipment with lightweight or ultra lightweight (armor only) and remove all the upgrades/attachments (reduce everything back to a standard upgrade/attachments). 
---
Might take you a while to find these mod crafting plans with the new update. I haven't seen an ultra lightweight mod at a vendor since Patch 5.
---
After that, you want to set a limit on junk you keep. 100 of each material is basically my personal limit just for basic repairs. Refresh what you're low on, either bulk the rest to sell or craft+scrap until you get rid of enough materials. It's better to use junk or you may lose it (dying then a server crash or player steals it). When you get your favorite
---
Basically only keep stuff in the Weapons, Apparel, Holo (nothing in there should weigh anything), Notes (both weightless + recipes you want to sell), and Junk tabs. Every other tab, I try to keep as empty as possible.
---
If you can part with stuff, then pick a build and get rid of all the other legendary items that don't fall in with your build.
---
Agree 100%
---
Yea that won‚Äôt facilitate the selling of caps on ebay, like at all.
---
Yeah, because the games dead. It's a running joke.
---
Classic...Division fanboy vs Fallout fanboy
---
The gaming industry is pure lakewater and Bethesda polutes it? LOL. They are all doing the same thing, making entertainment for the masses to earn money. You are just desperately crapping on this game because you either:
---
1. Couldn't afford it
---
2. Work for the competition
---
3. Or just plain stupid and annoying
---
I think its all 3 üòé
---
I've seen it once at about 120 hours of playing ... I appreciated the battle and am glad it was very random.
---
Im sure that letting people who build giant swastikas in front of Vault 76 to have their own dialogue options is a great idea.
---
hmm, sentinel armor. Didn't think about that. I'll look into it!
---
The faces are a common thing throughout the fallout games. Although I think it's just a case of reused assets. It would be neat if there were some kind of deeper meaning behind them.
---
Actually a huge FO4 fan.. put a couple hundred hours in 76 as well, but smart enough to see it for what it is - a bad game that was rushed to release. 
---
If it's an ingredient in a chem you cant plant it at your CAMP or in a FO4 settlement.  The disease cure/healing salve farm would quickly replace the vegetable starch farm if you could plant anything.
---
Yeah, as soon as there are not people with full assasins/sentinel armor pvp is fun. But don't take their junk, if they didn't do something bad. It is frustrating to lose shit you were collecting and you will throw it away cause your stash will be full soon.
---
Why? What you need to expand about my comment, can you elaborate what exactly you don't understand about that this game just isn't as terrible as people say it is? Also, the other response to your comment summs it perfectly.
---
There's a F04 mod for that, which turns out to be essential once installed. 
---
*(In childish scribble)*
---
Necromongers was here
---
You figure you could loot vertibirds and put up a mini gun or something.
---
Was it gone?
---
The small buildings around whitespring are unmarked.
---
‚Ä¶...remind me to up my security.
---
They aren't selling DLC. They claim all DLC will be free. But yea, premade content timeboxed for release no doubt.
---
Honestly its laughable if thats the case, if they had released some already it might have sated some people.
---
By the time they start releasing content the game will be mostly dead.
---
Am hopeful as I thought this would carry me at least 12 months. My character was past the grind with everything I wanted with weapons, armour and mods, so was quite happy to amuse myself in the sandbox Like stalking other players, and creeping into camps to take a look. It's the player base I found fastinating after years of boring AI in TES and Fallout games. With little incentive to interact through the barrel of a gun, I liked how every encounter did not start with a hail of lead. But through some poor choices Beth has made, I have packed up my camp and moved to clearing some of my massive back catalogue of games spread over PC, XBox and PS4. That's the main issue with Fallout 76. It's an Beta game that got marketed as a full title. With no major road plan for the fans we are kinda under the impression they are not sure where they want to take it. Yeah games make comebacks. But look at no man's sky. It's 2 years on and is 10x better than when it got launched. But 2 years on, it's still pretty boring to play. 
---
Yes we are seeing new players all the time leaving Vault 76, but how many will still be interested in 2 weeks, 6 months, or a year from now. We live in a great time to be gamers with decent sales of past games and a good future of incoming titles. Beth is not doing much reassuring for many to keep this gaming installed on or PC or consoles.
---
I‚Äôve kind of been struggling with my feelings towards 76, but I think you managed to sum up how I feel pretty well. I love experiencing the world with other people, I love the setting, I love the story, and I can even work past all the bugs. There just isn‚Äôt enough. I‚Äôve worked from rifle, to shotgun, to heavy weapons, to melee to pistol builds, done every quest (at least every one listed in the official guide book), and done most events/dailies. I have tons of legendary weapons I found, some neat rare clothing and a fully modded set of X-01. 
---
There‚Äôs just not much left for me at this point, I just find myself constantly grinding for materials for ammo and repairing my gear. While I‚Äôm not uninstalling or hating on the game in any way, I just eagerly await the day they add more story. I‚Äôve always played fallout for the lore, and I just crave more than we currently have. 
---
Back in the early days people would break in and kill me 2 out of 5 times I won. Now my camps are welcome to anyone. But I still get spooked
---
Just don't put anything that you can "Use" near a window.
---
Beds, workbenches, instruments, will all pull people inside.
---
There is also clipping on ground flooring, meaning you can walk along the outer rim of a house, clinging to the walls to get in anywhere.
---
Awesome.  Saving this to watch tomorrow.
---
It's all bulked and ready to sell.
---
And he had so much scrap. I don't know why he didn't stash it himself. Usually I just take the acid and steel and leave, but there was so much to look through I just grabbed it and ran.
---
But *why* though? This is quality of life we're talking here. There's no logical legitimate reason why any plant can't grow at our camps. 
---
If you want to plant Snaptails, Firecaps, and Bloodleaves at your camp, you should be able to. It's just tedious to the point of frustration, not to mention immersion breaking. 
---
That one gives 30% armour penetration.
---
The one that *just* gives armour penetration gives 40%, and still has 20 rounds.
---
[It is about comunity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=1s) not game. People here are still suggesting new things. Why don't you try to play, as if this game was finished? Why are you trying to find problem everywhere? You don't like this game? ok go play anything else, why would we care? After 400hours i still have loads of thinks to do. Getting fat at this game, becouse i can't even get myself to do some exercises between gaming, but i am reading everywhere how is this game shit from some casual noobs. Haha.
---
Around lv 35 i fast traveled to lewisburg station and the sb spotted me as soon as i arrived. I lured it into the city and let the super mutants do most of the work, while I tried to hide and pop off shots where I could. Went through most of my ammo and aid, and broke a lot of guns. Almost died 3-4 times, and totally forgot about my PA. Perfect 6/10

Thanks for the help

i thought about this the other day when i found the crashed vertibird "random" encounter and it would let you loot it like a body and wondered why the regular ones wouldnt let you
---
Oh fu\*\*, he was carring all his junk, because he had junk weight reduction perks and don't waste stash space probably, poor guy.
---
Nice jackpot for you tho.
---
Thanks for all information about storing items this will surely help me out 
---
Events.
---
which ones?
---
Came to this post due a friends meme conversation. Myself unsubscribed this subreddit some weeks ago. 
---
It was me who bought this game to my coop friends in November 2018. We knew it was no RDR 2 from graphic and polishing point. It was okay that it was downgraded in comparison to Fallout 4. We all knew the bug-history of oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout new Vegas etc. and we saw the good things in the game. Yes we hoped, that they would fix the major issues in the first weeks since the first weeks are so important for sales. It was frustrating to see the tiny development in fixing issues and to see the prices fall with other great games at the door step. But we stocked to the game meeting for our weekly coop nights after work week by week. But after 2 months we gave up on the game. And that is very frustrating. 
---
Will this game be at a releaseable point in one year? MAYBE (not so sure anymore).
---
Till then we will have played Generation Zero (the Beta was a blast and much more stable than this), we will return to Division 1 and Ghost Recon Wildlands. We will have played division 2 together and I will take a look into Metro Exodus and some other games. At this point, I‚Äôm participating the Skyrim Together Beta and to be fair, it‚Äôs at a similar buggy point as Fallout 76. But it‚Äôs a indie mod!
---
To be a little bit more constructive. I don‚Äôt understand why it was that important to release Fallout 76 in that early stage. I know the development history and all the stuff. It explains a lot. I know we were warned before release that it would be very buggy. So they knew it.... and sold it never the less. 
---
Bethesda Austin needs to hire more people and rise two major branches. One to fix this game very soon and one to enlarge the content very soon. This game is burned right now. It has some solid sales but in general it‚Äôs a big flop. First thing is, they should say SORRY and explain in public why this game is in this state. After the buggy Anthem Demo, BioWare / EA gifted some feee items to say ‚Äúit was our fault - sorry‚Äú. After the first difficult months in Rainbow Six Siehe they made a season-stop and started ‚ÄûOperation Health‚Äú to overhaul the whole game. And they succeeded well. 
---
After all the issues with Diablo 3, they canceled the most critizied parts (auction house, loot system) and re-invented loot 2.0
---
They all did two major thing Bethesda MUST do right now:
---
- they said sorry to the Community, that they aware it‚Äôs in bad shape and that they made mistakes
---
- they overhauled the whole game in some short months (wich is expensive)
---
Bethesda has to do a lot more. Not Justs one forum posts, inside vault casts saying ‚Äûmore features coming soon‚Äú and fixing stuff just to not really fix em. I quit with this game and this weired community - came here by accident, but I still wish this game will become better so it will get a 2nd chance at the market. 
---
While I personally did not buy the game, it's important to keep the situation on reddit alive for entertainment purposes. So it would be better if some of you keep logging in. Just look at what type of threads Bethesda responds to inbetween all the bug reports and so on lul 
---
Thanks just got rid of 38 weight from my stash

You play Destiny your post is invaild. ‚ù§

Not an American.

Wait, you think the subreddit is only for people who have nice things to say about fo76? 
---
next time just post [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/017/314/stop_liking_file.jpg) it would be quicker.
---
Lucky you. 
---
I use a BP lvl 50, with double damage at full HP. With all the gunner Perks I have 276 damage per shot.

Now think of a TS Dragon max lvl. with the double Damage Perk.

Holy shit, I need some

---
You see, he's better than everyone else because he's bitching about the bitching other people are doing. 
---
Bethesda's like "Nope. Those cards are useless but if you try to hack a computer without them....ha, ha, haaaa!"
---
dang I dont do enough events to know which one that is
---
Hmm my lights were turned off yesterday. But my door isn't locked. Still I moved switch away from window :) hope you liked my house
---
Yeah but to have a game with no offline option and reqiure PS Plus is just bad marketing, people who bought the game have no other option. ESO doesnt have offline but doesnt reqiure PS Plus, the game Friday the 13th has an online mode but also an offline one, Sorry for not giving enogh detail in the Original Post.
---
I've seen this wall. 
---
I stopped playing a few weeks after launch. I had hit level 100+. Had fun with builds. Launched a nuke. Hunted scorchbeasts and other large beasts. Got a little geared. I had 100+ hours easy. Maybe more.
---
I hadn't played much since then. I'd hop on and poke around. Check some things out. But never more than twenty minutes or so. Until two days ago. I reinstalled and hopped back in. I've been having a great time. Ill be playing at least another week or so until Anthem drops.
---
All that said: you've already gotten several hundred hours out of it, of your own admission. That's a hell of a lot of gametime for a game that some people are getting even as cheap as 20 bucks. What more could you want at this point? Take a break. Come back when there's new content. For a game you either want to fail, or think is terrible and want to coerce the devs into "fixing" due to attrition, it sounds to me like you got quite a bit of enjoyment out of it.
---
Bethesda has "been looking into it" since launch.  Modders fixed shitty stuff within days after launch.  I would have backed your point a month ago, now it's not such a strong one. 
---
I've crafted and scrapped a ton of heavy combat armor. Unlocked multiple mods.
---
The only mods I can craft are reinforced and strengthened, both of which I had before the last patch.
---
I don't even bother with doors unless I'm locking them. Just a waste of time.
---
Although I'm also partial to instead of a locked door, just have a solid wall and when you want to get into that room go into build mode and change it to a doorway.
---
Thankyou!
---
My friend's that I met on there hardly get on anymore. And the server looked pretty desolate today. I mainly build camps now. And I became good friends with these people so it sucks not seeing them get on as much as they used to. Our group is basically down to just two but even then I play alone most of the time. To the point I hardly feel like getting on myself.

I PVP for the profit, not for the troll. I always go for higher level people. Last week I found a level 250 dude at the munitions factory. I snuck in there and managed to get two kills on him before he got me. I probably netted 400 caps for my troubles. The guy had a bloodied build. Crazy seeing a dude with 20% HP avoid a full clips worth of damage, but also satisfying when that one bullet finally connects awarding you with hundreds of caps.
---
There are a ton of people who troll lower levels. I've been leveling two new characters simultaneously. The moment I take a workshop, someone with an explosive shotgun shows up to ruin my day. I even get people trying to kill me when I low level farm whitesprings ghouls. They even destroyed someones base thinking it was mine.
---
I am pretty sure that ESO requires PS plus. I've just bought it for my wife and for her to play I had to 'buy' PS plus (and ESO plus but that's another story).
---
Just to be clear, PS plus is from Sony, Bethesda has nothing to do with that. 
---
inb4 Nocturnal brings misfortune and ruin upon you and yours. 
---
Probably not, lots of assets reused from F4. Dont know how much they spent marketing it though
---
Costs have been more reasonable in the shop and I‚Äôd definitely be willing to purchase some of the new cool unstoppable outfits. but it just feels with a waste because I‚Äôve done everything the game has to offer. I was really sad about 76 150 hours in and I‚Äôve already run out of content. Plus such a beautiful world that just feels so hollow. 
---
I use a perked shotgun build to cripple e every limb i can so they land... still annoying and terrible enemy. Not worth the hassle
---
Hey did you ever find a fix for this? Have had the same issue since beta 
---
Love it so much you are telling people to stop playing because you got bored. Right. I'm the bitch.
---
LOL I wore that exact same outfit combo for quite a while. I just wanted a scythe.

[I am raider, who you are?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=26s)

Clearly didnt read the post, assuming I want people to stop enjoying the game. I love this game, and I want nothing more to see it succeed.  But that's not where it's headed right now, and obviously Beth doesnt give a fuck about what the players want. 
---
Oh and youre a bitch. 
---
I've seen loading screen tips that say something like, "legendary enemies have a chance to drop legendary items". So they are telling us that you need to run into a legendary enemy by chance, then have to roll another chance to even get an item? And then you calculate in the chances of getting a 1\*, 2\*, or a 3\*? And then you have to individually roll all three effects! holy crap, the chances of finding an item you want is so small. I've probably seem less than twenty 3\* enemies in my 130 hours(never farmed legendaries or anything, so normal gameplay), and half of them didnt even drop a legendary, let alone a 3\*. That just seems super lame to me. 
---
I think it makes more sense that if you happen to find a 3\* enemy, it should always drop a 3\* item. Same idea with 1\* and 2\*. . It just makes sense to me.
---
thank you fellow raider!

How about when you kill a three star protectron in watoga only for the body to explode and in the blinding flash you can't find where it landed...

Or when you literally can't find any enemy you killed because their bodies blend into the environment "and if they became a meat pile good luck, especially in the red grasses of The Mire.
---
In GTA V there is microtransaction to get game currenci you need to farm othervise to get anything. lol they made milions of $ on that. 
---
Say you love the game
---
Also want people to quit the game that you love
---
Calling people who disagree a bitch because reasons?
---
No, and I encourage people not to. We need to send a message to Bethesda that we are not satisfied with how they are handling this game. We send this message by not paying twenty dollars for virtual paint sets.  
---
**4. It's actually pretty god damn bad.**
---
Sorry man 1.5k firm
---
What you're looking for is text chat.  
---
I am still playing the game.  There are still alot of bugs and glitches but i can deal with it. 
---
Could I throw some serums in to lower the price
---
wait a month or 2 in all honesty like its good but once you reach endgane theres nothing to do besides grind for caps or plans or weapons
---
On other hand in 400hours i made over 8k atoms by playing. So you can support developers with 5$ or play game and eventualy buy some cosmetic thats is useless anyway.
---
Awesome shot :D
---
If you have friends to play with or have enjoyed the pure exploration aspects of earlier Fallout games, then sure, pick it up. But not at full price.
---
If you really like the exploration aspect of fallout games, then there is a good chance you will enjoy fallout 76.
---
[Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN0hbQALkag)
---
You just described Conan exiles. Check it out 
---
Im alright on serums, i have the mutations i need sorry man
---
I've taken out 3 without a TSE at level 38. Their screeches didn't even hurt me. I thought that was kinda weird.
---
And i'm not on either of those. 
---
For me also 76 never had the "magic", I've possibly played 20 hrs to date. I have 2 chars currently lvls 12 and 3.
---
I'm patently waiting for the major bugs to be fixed, then I'll donate some time to it, I find myself hoping it survives long enough to get the server stability, stash and other things fixed so I can properly experance the new and possibly best fallout experance yet.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/33MVpBh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/33MVpBh.jpg)
---
Not so. In FO76, the wendingo is Morris.
---
Oh I read it alright. Also I think you forgot you wrote this: "**And if you disagree, that's fine, opinions and all that**". 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $30 for it. It can be a fun game. But it‚Äôs so broken. Never have I played a game this cluttered with issues. Like it‚Äôs ridiculous we are experiencing these kinda issues still. 
---
Honestly once they finally fix energy weapons that thing will be dope. I bet it has double the freeze rate of a normal cryolator. 
---
Except then you don't.
---
Boooring.
---
This is the thing I am waiting for to even consider buying the game lul. 
---
The sense of entitlement is strong with this one.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
It takes you more than 1 bullet to kill?
---
45 lever action non legendary and 1 shot it.
---
30 and below.
---
Higher yeah it takes more.
---
I did enjoy it and I still want to, which is why i want more. Which is why i want the game to improve and succeed. There wont be any new content to come back to lol. Those vaults, are going to be a huge disappointment. Beth has only announced more pvp based content. I played the game and didnt even unlock everything. Dont have all the plans or recipes,  I still have plenty to do. I still want to play. But I dont want to support a game whose dev team is very obviously not even trying to hide that they dont give a shit, and will just push their own agenda. Its not like I'm emailing Beth demanding my personal changes be addressed. 
---
I'm just ahead of the curve, you'll all see it from my view eventually. 
---
They actually got a bit easier for me to kill, so I am happy with the changes.   I never found any TSE and was not about to buy a dupe from another player.   Now I got dense and can equip fireproof and they barely hurt me.  I can get them to land with only 1 shot, then just use handmade to the face.  All done.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not suprised about the melee one, and hell you must have one build to stand it out from 5 people. And heh secret sauce, just a lot of AP regen items and dmg resist items?
---
As long as you think of it as an Early Access game, sure. It's definitely got it's high points.
---
Ah yes, our daily required "I don't like this, so you're all evil and/or stupid if you don't do what I say" post. Lovely. 
---
Last i saw it was being "finalized" about a week ago...
---
Wouldn't ignore hide your location on the map from them?
---
[Not exploit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=26s) It is game mechanics. **When you are claiming workshop, game tells you, it is pvp zone.**
---
What problems are you referring to that I listed? I have defended this game against friends and family. You didnt even read the post you fucking shit bag. I played this game day and night from launch until about 2 weeks ago. 400 hours ain't shit little girl, I've got more hours than that and still have shit to do to. I'd say get off of your high horse, but the crusty ass gaming chair doesnt really count. 
---
My CAMP or workshop turrets seem to be more and more blind every day. Tried with spotlights to make them detect quicker, no dice.
---
A bitch is a bitch. Easy to spot, if your curious what they look like just check the closest mirror.
---
Well, yeah. Cannibals turn into Wendigos. So the Wendigos we fight in-game are probably the "survivors" of the Gourmands. 
---
They don't need fusion cores, they're powered by *your fear*
---
I have Dense on my Heavy Combat Armor and 1 sonic blast did like 40% dmg.   Not sure what the deal is.  But after I put Dense on, it seemed to do  more damage.  
---
Never stated I got bored, anywhere. Again, didnt read the post. So yes, you are the bitch. 
---
It's honestly alot of fun if you play games casually and don't dump more than 200+ hours into it. Even then I could see it still holding up. Watch some positive and negative Recent reviews of the game and decide for yourself honestly. 
---
&gt;  however their team doesn't show as hostile to the Workshop Owner.
---
THAT is the exploit.
---
&gt;and I finally quit about 2 weeks ago now. 4 characters,  hundreds of hours, and I cant find a reason to play any longer.
---
Yes, It would seem the Fireproof is a bit too strong.   I have Dense mod on BOS Combat Armor Chest and seems I take 40% dmg on 1 sonic blast.  Not sure if its a bug with the BOS and Dense or not.
---
Didnt read the post, just like everyone who has left a comment. Never said I dont like the game. Lol, just another bitch. Why even comment?
---
Yeah I did that after a while. My objects start to look more like a novel later in the game.
---
What do you mean? Because if you‚Äôre saying I could make better skyrim dragons with mods, that‚Äôs neat but my point about Bethesda reskinning a lame enemy combat system stands. 
---
With the dragons it wasn‚Äôt a big issue because the game was already really great in other areas. In 76 there‚Äôs less to distract you and its a pain to deal with. 
---
I'd rather have legendary drop rate lowered to like 1% and have them drop actual good items than this.
---
I have played for ~100 hours, never seen anything resembling the ts or e, let go tse.
---
Fucking remove wood, leather etc from the pool after a certain level
---
Mary me you old hag because gosh darndit I luv you.
---
Yea, the loot-table for it is quite disappointing, for how rare it is, flux would make sense.
---
It's like 10 bucks now, so I don't see why not. It's still Fallout-y, just minus the juicy RPG bits. (Which, some would argue make a Fallout game more than the gameplay.)
---
That‚Äôs actually interesting, I never knew that the bobblehead exploit would just destroy PA parts, since I never was too bothered about the exploit since I could one shot people without bobbleheads needed. 
---
In what I wrote I didn‚Äôt take in the bobblehead eploit as a factor since, well you can‚Äôt do it anymore, and a lot of armour health is RNG so some pieces will have less than others, ontop of mods that also decrease its health. And from what I‚Äôve tested of getting people to use armour puercing and then not armour piercing, I‚Äôd see in my case that the armour would drop down a lot more. Sorta like the armour piercing .45 bullets from a Mr Gutsy, they do a whole lot of damage on my armours durability(They‚Äôre bleeding annoying aswell)(I know the assissins effect won‚Äôt take place since theyre robots but I see my armours durability drop quite significantly). I hope that explains, if it didn‚Äôt could you re-itirate what you meant to ask?
---
Ahaha that's perfect. Gotta do that sometime. Managed to do similar to a friend who doesn't play often. Had red dress and beautiful hair, crouched and changed my outfit to faschnacht mask and clown outfit and stood up next to them when they didn't know where I was.
---
I'm level 122 and have seen it twice. Both time were within about 20 minutes of each other in the savage divide. I've even seen the mothman more now and I didn't see it until I did the lighthouse event at around lvl 80.
---
Started to happen to me lately. I don't have mutations and the most likely cause is some combination of *adrenaline* perk, *radworms*, *weapon with +10% damage* while aiming and *curing* the wrong time. All my weapons (ranged, melee) lose 10-30% damage until I relog.
---
I don't know why someone is downvoting everyone who mentions dense or fireproof. Even with the scream spam bug they become a complete non-issue. You can just walk away from them until they deaggro you.
---
Logged on to my other account on reddit and saw i was subbed here. Use to play i think back in october? lol why u guys still playing this hot garbage. I know know, its fun, or dont tell others to do this. But in the long run, id invest in almost any other game atm. Just my 2 cents. Theyll never make it right...just an fyi...
---
Two people side by side could essential eat/pick up at the same time 
---
Hunters are the worst. Although Radscrops arent as common as they were in Fo4 as 76 in my experience
---
Anyone ever do the quest in NV "We will all go together?" and the one helping the raiders collect NCR gear?
---
giant Queen Radscorpion and fighting three of them as soon as you leave the Privates house with the last dog tags?
---
Hate them so much. More than any other creature across all fallouts
---
I haven't purchased Atoms yet, but I've talked to some of my friend and basically said, if they keep providing fresh and interesting content, I'll be more than willing to buy into Atoms regularly (maybe monthly?) to support Bethesda's efforts and this game.  I just need to see everything pick up a little more steam and fix some bugs before I'll actually commit to that.
---
That's the long standing login glitch where the Excavator starts at +200 carryweight until you re-enter it when it correctly buffs you by +100 only. I have 2 calibrated shocks and a base carryweight of 205: I start with 505 carryweight, which is nice for doing some hoarding before crafting/repairing forces me out of the PA.
---
They do a good job but i was disappointed to learn Grafton is not, in reality where it should be.
---
Its actually south of morgantown and the mire and bog are technically Virginia
---
You are correct, cannot break apart the cards.   It has been suggested many times, that they should allow you to temporary downgrade a higher level perk card so you can better customize your builds.   If Bethesda are reading the forums at all, they should have noticed at least one of these.
---
Take a look at the wiki for the mods on the weapons.   They will show you some of the effects that really are not listed including the AP costs.  It will change how you mod your weapons.   Plus remember each mod affects durability, so you will need to watch that as well.  
---
Well if you have drugs going the numbers of the weapons change.  Like the 213 on my handmade.  If I took off all drugs and removed bloodied mess (in exchange for Tormentor) then the damage would drop a lot.   I just dont have Tormentor yet.  Its one of the ones I need to get.  I was just adjusting my agility perk first.   Plus I have to get a whole new set of perception perks.  I need to get the auto perks for rilfes, commando I think.  I want to try out the auto on the handmade with the critical build.
---
It actually amazes me that y'all still hang around in this cesspool, glad to see y'all still care enough about this game to check the sub even if the most y'all do is lurk
---
Should be an option to exclude items in trade for a lower spawn rate.
---
Say for instance 1 in 10 legendaries is an actual good item, the rest is all lead pipes, wood armor, etc. 
---
That you say you dont goddamn want wood armor, lead pipes, wrenches, pipe pistols, lower leveled items etc.
---
And that in return you only find 1/10 as much legendaries, but it saves you the disappointment every single fucking time.
---
major profit, i went from about two hundred caps to over five hundred just in a few minutes from killing a dude and his posses after they saught revenge
---
Did you contract radworms during this encounter or eaten Radstag/molerat/etc that can also up your carryweight by 30-40? Did it disappear if you re-entered the PA?
---
Saw this the other day near Whitesprings.  It's a bug.  There's also a small piece of rock, I think, up near the mountains nearby.  It's purple and has text roughly like, "To change or set texture press Ctrl+A".  Or at least something vaguely like that. My dumbass tried it and of course threw a grenade at my own feet.
---
If youre even lazier the diner in Nuka world has 3 just sitting on the counter.
---
You dont even have to use the machine
---
Yet another copy pasted post. 
---
It does, you have to Ignore/Block them and then fast travel away, I said that in the post.
---
I never came across one of those good and wanted legendary items.
---
Won't it be nice if a 3 star legendary creature would drop a 3 star or higher legandary weapon? I don't know much about making and balancing games, but this sounds logical to me :P
---
I think the creature should drop +200 caps when it does not drop legendary.
---
What's your ign
---
Great post, thnx!
---
Then how the heck did you lose 1500 caps?
---
Put a crystallizing barrel on it and go to SBQ events and freeze her when she‚Äôs on the ground and everyone will love you. 
---
I only have two heavy turrets at my camp in the mire but they easily take down Enraged Fog Crawlers while i put a potshot or two on them
---
I wonder if everyone complaining about weak ass turrets only ever put basic ones and put them on the ground.
---
I see this all the time at workshops i take over.
---
Low level turrets already destroyed because theyre easy prey on the ground.
---
ELEVATE YOUR SHIT PEOPLE
---
All wooden pieces have mod that increases stealth.
---
Pushing PvP shit isn't killing the intended playerbase. It's just killing the unnintended audience the game was never built for. Just because the vast majority (80% of you) want a singleplayer co-op storyline experience doesn't mean the game was built for that. Bethesda just took the Fallout 4 engine and wanted to give multipplayer fans something to enjoy too until they release Fallout 5 for you guys. The fact that you impaciently bought this game in such large numbers appealed to their greed and nutered PvP thinking the game can make more money by appealing to a larger audience then just PvP fans which they did and sacrificed the enjoyment of both audiences in the process. You people dragged the company in the mud because of it and still demand from Bethesda to transform this game into Fallout 5 for you instead of fucking off and letting them cater to the PvP audience like they first intended. This was never suppose to be a big game, that takes years of development. But tks to your impacience of fucking off and waiting for Fallout 5 you destroyed a small game us PvP players could have enjoyed from the very start. But you had to hijack it with your greater number of wallets.
---
You clearly can't read, **the workshop owner isn't at the workshop**, you can be anywhere on the map and they can kill you because someone on their team is claiming the workshop.
---
I'm level 315, they just kept killing me because I had no idea what was going on at first, the team did it anytime I claimed a workshop (not from them, just unowned workshops). You will just be walking along, get the notification that your workshop is under attack and then you get one-shot by someone with an assassins build.
---
They should let us build the SAM turrets
---
Yet another reason the workshops are not being utilized. The PvP in this game is such garbage and people keep finding ways to abuse it. I was playing on an alt and lost a workshop no big deal lost caps and junk that's the danger. But the level 200 wasn't interested in the workshop. They challenged for the PvP flag to kill 2 characters one level 10 the other 17. We had no chance to fight back, not even like we would've fought them. I don't think contesting the workshop should flag anyone unless they try to stop it. Honestly I think the whole workshop mode is trash and needs to be looked over again so people will use it more. They're not at all worth the effort.
---
Well I've been tooling around on PS4 so have avoided a lot of the bad players, but ran in to 4 late tonight.  High levels who just want to beat up mid level players and steal their shit, couldn't care less about actual game play.  Seems like PS4 may be going the way of the rest of the platforms.  Sucks, I hope they rot.
---
I don‚Äôt know. Robot armor is pretty deflating
---
&gt;you can just walk away until they deaggro you
---
Then you can walk for all of eternity, tjose tjings follow you until one of you dies
---
if only there were some modders on nexus who developed a [text chat mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151) for fo76? :D
---
Didn't know what was going on at first, I just kept respawning in the area I was in (watoga). Just kept getting killed by people who looked like normal players (not flagged as hostile).
---
Lol they doing that shit anyway. If it's that much of an issue just disallow caps.
---
Grace me with a comment on this theory? https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acgcly/ingame_evidence_points_toward_a_simulation/?st=JRUB2V78&amp;sh=70aaf4c0
---
That guy making inflammatory remarks? Jeff Kaplan ... einstein
---
Scorch do this a lot.  So do SM.  They loot their buddies.
---
I have actually read a post by someone looking groups of SM.  They look for the one with the minigun and kill him.  Then wait for his buddies to pick up the minigun and kill him and so on.   Each SM that picked up the minigun will also drop 5MM ammo.  So they farm the 5MM ammo that way instead of making it.
---
Yes, with the exception of Rad resist, of which it's got the highest. 
---
Same scenario, the team I was dealing with would never even actually take the workshop, they would just start the Claim to kill me, and then stop it, and keep doing that over and over.
---
Having been in each of the vaults, there is thing kind of lame elemental themed vault setup.  Each one appears to represent a different element.  Didn‚Äôt see anything related to geck within any vaults, but they are still mostly unfinished 
---
So its a pain because there's less distractions? Seems like that would be a good thing to have. As for reskinning. Dragons don't act anything like sb or sbq. Im not sure how the two ever look or act the same, except maybe when they fly. 
---
Sounds like the connection between you and the server was taking some serious lag.  It could have been  the server itself was lagging.   
---
Text chat solves that issue.
---
You're right about what you're saying, I can not deny that. On the one hand, we have a very significant work in English literature, on the other hand, we have a very significant work in computer games history.
---
It can now be argued endlessly about which of the two in the context is now "more important". Purely from the location the cave is "bigger".
---
[My english is not great, so read this.](https://i.imgur.com/zBMN5gD.png) It is mechanics, you seek revenge, becouse from my experience, after they kill you, pvp is over otherwise. **Stop blaming game for you being noob.** 
---
I'm level 57. My PA is level 50 and level 45 T-51 and T-60. The 200% repair could be assisting. Thanks for the info.
---
Then enter a dungeon. He cannot follow you there. Or grow a pair and fight back. Tell him his mother wears army boots and you‚Äôre going to drop a nuke on her!
---
Once the player that fought took all the claimed workshops on the server they either dc'd or server hopped. I'd bet money they server hopped. Really fun way to play the game. Make sure nobody is using any resource extractors at workshops. 
---
Thanks for the original and insightful statement    /s
---
Explosive shot weapons. Missile launchers do jack.
---
What are you calling 'cavalier armor'?
---
I'm glad you liked it!
---
They can spawn as a torso mod, limb mod, or sometimes just a mod that you can‚Äôt use.
---
Moist meter increases oWo
---
Seeking revenge probably, like all those who was blaming they were oneshoted thru slap damage.
---
Your reading comprehension is not great either. 
---
Interesting.  It didn't work on any piece but I will look again for one that will work.
---
Incisor works with every melee weapon, but depending on your damage output you might not see any benefit from rank 3 with, say, a Bloodied Super Sledge.
---
Yes your english is not good. When someone claims a workshop, their entire team is flagged for open PVP against the owner. The attacker is sending their friends to hunt down the owner somewhere on the map.
---
*meat monster
---
It‚Äôs upsetting, I‚Äôve experienced it firsthand, but good luck to you.
---
But I have vats crits too, and it‚Äôs kinda hard to vats crit while my rifle shotgun or powerfist are staggering you.
---
inb4 "Why is this game dead"  
---
Putas like you
---
They're not seeking revenge noob. They're respawning and being hunted down by a team that leaves one person at the workshop to refresh the flag with no intentions of ever actually taking the workshop. They're abusing the PvP flag applying to the team. He's not trying to defend his garbage workshop, just getting killed repeatedly nowhere near his workshop.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 add me, username same as GT
---
Oh I am getting close to the 300 hour mark and never seen TSE drop.   I have a Two-Shot The Dragon and have found about 4 Explosive weapons including a 3-star cryolator with explosive (which actually is pretty darn good because explosive + slow effect + crystalized bullets save ammo).    But out of 600+ legendaries, not a single TSE dropped for me.   I have 15 luck on my character.    
---
Luck seems to play a roll in the chances of legendary effects though.    I never got any Medic legendaries until my luck went from 6 to 8.  Once I crossed the 8 luck threshold I got like 5 medic to drop.   When i was around 6 luck, I got a single Explosive to drop, which was a level 15 and something I did not use like a pipe rifle.  Garbage.   When I got my luck up to 11 or 12, I got 3 explosive legendaries to drop.    All of those were 1 star except the cryolator above.   I ended up giving the cryo to a friend that uses heavy weapons.   I don't have any of the heavy weapon perks.  I also got my first Two Shot when I had 15 luck.
---
I could be the luck stat played no role in it but seemed like it actually did.
---
Except it's not. Show me where it's copy pasted from, go on.
---
i had it yesterday evening again with a handmade rifle.
---
No perks for rifles and needed an entire clip to kill a supermutant with headshot.
---
think im gonna play other game till they fixed this game breaking issue for me. wasting tons of ammo like this
---
Incoming Atomic Store DLC.  Mark my words!
---
I would LOVE to find a 3 star wood armor.  With the stealth mod on those, it would make my build insane!
---
I once clicked on an atom pack for information and it make a ‚Äòkerching‚Äô noise so I hoped out of there. I was never asked for payment details, the person who bought me the game wasn‚Äôt charged, and I didn‚Äôt get any atoms.
---
 At which point do you actually put your details in? 
---
The more I sit and think about it, you're probably right. I'd imagine you should just uninstall and stop delaying the inevitable.
---
But before you do, can I have your springs and screws? I could also use some 2mm ammo. And any 3 star legendaries you've got. I'll really stick it to Bethesda with all this stuff. 
---
So you are telling me, one guy go in workshop, claim it, leave circle and let that workshop to be still owned by guy who had it before. After he respawn, he again clam it and leave?   Thats crazy, you get 1/4 of caps and pay 30+ for each claiming. This would be worth only for really high level players.
---
Hmm seems like these downvotes are right for first time, sorry guys. I am just tired of all those hoax on this site.
---
Wait it will be like 5 dollars in a month or less lol
---
Only keep the resources you Really need, and if you want to keep others, keep all stacks to a 100 maximum, unless it‚Äôs something that a lot of things need.
---
Bulking is pointless because there aren‚Äôt a lot of resources that are reduced in weight when bulking, and the reason why it *looks* like weights going down is because you‚Äôre wasting plastic.
---
Hold onto a select few of weapons you think you want to hold onto. I would personally say *about* 5.
---
Leave space for power armors you want to keep, and remind yourself that each chassis is 10lbs each.
---
There is a possible bug that would be great if could be verified: a possible bad interaction between the Adrenaline perk and Radworms disease which reduces damage on all weapons when both wear off/the latter gets cured sometimes. Relog fixes it. I get this glitch typically at Whitesprings where I melee through and have a high chance of contracting radworms while buffed on adrenaline. As if the adrenaline buff gets debuffed twice, hence the 10-60% damage reduction across the board.
---
There's a mod for that.
---
And you‚Äôre full of crap also I‚Äôm on Xbox one I have friends on PlayStation this game is still experiencing many many freezes it happened to me several times a day!!! Bethesda went after the DUPERS  and cheaters and did little to repair this game other than to put Band-Aids on it!  I‚Äôm threw myself I killed the scorch beast queen tonight I‚Äôm level 122 and got a lousy level 45 piece of leg armor!!
---
Yes that's exactly what's going on. 
---
I actually like the look of the Marine armor.  But its crap stats like you said.   When all other armors have the Heavy Teir, they all out perform the Marine Armor.    Studded Heavy Leather is actually best armor in the game.
---
Wood is hard to find actually... I have been looking for some pieces.   I use stealth build and need to find a good collection of these.
---
"hey everybody! I look for women that I suspect of being hoe's and destroy them .. and also wants to be a little Devil 666 .. and also .. gimmi money!"
---
Yea, right.
---
Remove all of your weight saving perk cards temporarily before looking inside your stash.  This way you see the actual weights that apply to the stash and can make better decisions as to what is taking up so much space.
---
Agreed!   I have Studded Heavy Leather and no other armor in game can match the Physical/Energy resists on it except the BOS Heavy Combat Chest Piece.   If I remember correctly, just the 200% durability Leather arms are 45 physical and 77 energy.   
---
And remove the legendary spawns from the Whitesprings golf course.
---
This concept of PvP mode was broken before release.   
---
I don't understand why devs will not add a list of servers with PvP and PvE.   
---
In addition, the server list is already exists on the client side.
---
Same here. After hundreds of playhours, server hoppings etc. still no luck with those.
---
But it still is flooded with legendary gear... Hence the TSE dupes.
---
I mean, it's clearly possible. It SHOULDN'T be possible, though, and I hope it gets fixed fast.
---
3 months to manufacture canvas bags... this is a meme in itself.
---
Dude, all you had to go was go to Nuka World and find the place where all the broken machines get dumped.  The one there, being broken, naturally, works all the time.
---
Lol nice one. 
---
Sometimes the mobs loot the weapons from their downed buddies.  So look for the legendary items on those guys.
---
I tend to leave the legendary mob for last because it signficantly reduces damage to kill everyone else first (much easier kills) plus keeps the other guys from looting the legendary guy.
---
I've always had it drop legendary except once.   It dropped a handmade instead.    But I always get the Ultracite Vents plans!
---
level 89 paulofg1980
---
Im just grinding till level 100.
---
Ill side kick if you want lol
---
Not really, while production itself is fast, setting up the machines and getting ready to crank them out may take a while.
---
Thats the absolute best thing about this game. I think it even caught BGS by surprise.
---
My question I'd add is; will those receive a canvas bag too?
---
Hey! Leave the wood armor alone.  I need that stuff!
---
i've heard it helps a lot. haven't tested myself though. i know breaking limbs can cause staggers
---
You don't, actually. Bloodied/unyielding builds do a LOT of damage.  
---
But, again, it's not about one-shotting. These are called "glass cannon" builds for a reason. The reason melee can do so much damage and they're not nerfing melee is because it has an inherent disadvantage. I have to literally run right up to you and stab your face. That entire time, you can be shooting at me while I do it. I do a full unyielding/cavalier set and this still puts me at a disadvantage.  
---
People forget that this is based on a sandbox RPG engine. You need to fight smart. Use the terrain. Go in/outside structures. Hide. Shoot. Run somewhere else and do the same. The idea is to simulate a real fight. Not just have two people decide who'll do slap damage so the other can one-shot them.
---
Id be up to something like people entering suggestions for quests. And having a poll here on reddit. The most voted one would implemented by bethesda in a month time.
---
189% weapon damage from TSE is not crap.  No other weapon in game can match that power with just the weapon itself.
---
No i expect people to have lives and not spend their time maoning about a game they dont play/like/own but i this sub shows that people are sad enough to make a hobby out of being salty
---
Same here, instigating gauss with +40% limb damage.  Chaining headshots, or more frequently just blasting knees, is so much better now.  I could see the argument for a selectable option though.  Just don't switch it back without giving us the choice please.
---
If you want to buy this game I suggest buying it for the cheapest possible price. 
---
Use the bullet option or hard line breaks to make it work.
---
Regarding social, me and a friend are not able to team up, because every time the 'Invite to Team' says that each one of us is already a member of another team although we are not. And when the invitation get sent it doesn't show up for the outher person to 'Accept the invitation'.
---
In addition  to this I‚Äôd like a chat system like ESO where WTB and FS is communicated. 
---
Right?  
---
People don't understand the point. Bragging about how much dmg your melee build can do is silly. That wasn't the point of the post at all. My melee build does a LOT of damage. And I can come very close to stagger locking folks. The POINT was that --despite that-- melee still has a built-in disadvantage to ranged weapons. Period. End of story. Having to run up to someone's face who can be shooting you the entire time puts you at a disadvantage.   
---
It's not just about creating the perfect build but in genuinely using strategy to fight. Either way, I don't get how that isn't more fun for people anyway. I have a TON of fun, especially in PVP, trying to find the right routes to sprint, hide, recharge AP, sprint, hide, recharge AP, possibly find a blind spot in my opponent's view, use that route, and charge up to stabby stab.
---
&gt;and the person at the site can keep triggering that condition over as over again.
---
This is main issue, that he can trigger it again and again.
---
I don't get the big deal, given the state of the game overall. If I got another decent legendary drop at this point, I'd be thinking 'so what?' What am I gonna do with it? They scrap into mats I don't need, I can't sell it because my caps are maxed... Farm the SBQ yet again wasting a load of ammo, health and damaging that legendary for the small chance of... another legendary? The game is so unbalanced that I can find basic level 50 weapons off kills that, with the right perks, function better than most legendaries for general gameplay. The point is, there's no endgame and nothing left to do so when you reach the point that you want a decent legendary (and get one) there's nothing to do with it. The only potential motivation is to use legendries purely to mitigate the bullet sponges and save ammo/damage to the weapon - but to what end? Also, fuck getting only a Bobby Pin off a 3\* Legendary Glowing Bloated One.
---
My understanding: they changed the meaning of NoAutoScrapJunk to also mean don't consider such items for crafting/repairing at all, then slapped it onto mods. Once the mistake was recognized, they removed the NoAutoScrapJunk from bulk so they are now considered for crafting/repairing but also for auto-scrapping. It should have been a separate flag/filter for mods to begin with; I'd think this issue is more of a logical error on the dev part than the lack of engine knowledge.
---
Oh cool, I have 600 hours playtime, how much bitching am I allowed to do? 
---
&gt; Also, if i pick up extra plans/recipes I like to leave them in the desk at the church for other players.
---
Well, shit. Your way is better than mine. For the longest time, I would scan for low levels on the board and basically stalk them just to drop plans in front of them.  
---
There have been times where I think I've scared lower levels, trying to chase them down. Like, I just want to give you stuff, *please* stop.
---
Nowadays I don't entirely trust approaching randoms at all. Not many people on my level of kindness anymore. :(
---
Im sorry, but thats not true. Especially for a company as big as bethesda. You can check that by yourself by calling any company who produces this stuff and ask for a budget.
---
And dont forget they already produced canvas bags, but they were delivered only to specific people. Its not like they're starting from scratch.
---
Putting in motion the production if these types of things doesnt take 3 months.
---
I would understand distribution issues, but even then, im sure if the items were already manufactured and waiting transport, they would make everyone know.
---
Skyrim with multiplayer mod (is in beta).
---
Maybe this community solution is the better multiplayer compared to fallout 76. Mods are also supported to some extend (your friend have to install them to see your outfit). There are still some synch-bugs (quest related), but you don't have a loading screen when changing servers.
---
Few weeks ago someone put up a post about how all scorch beasts do it spam Thier sonic screech and nothing else. I see the same thing in your post.
---
Praise Atom for Rad Worms.
---
Welcome to MMO!   Most MMO do the same thing, very small chance at getting what you want.  Or they lock it behind a raid wall that most family oriented people have zero chances to get.   So at least this MMO, the casual family people have chances.
---
Rad worms is the common cold of this game.
---
Um yes
---
Same thing to me, very wierd
---
yup happened to me tonight was oon the roof of the shed at the acid workshop, friend had claimed it went to defend it with em had 3 rounds of rad scorpions, i was on the roof of the shed and three of em popped outta the roof and attacked me, friend comments "how the hell did they burrow out of the roof?"
---
But how do you get out again, fast travel or server hop?
---
While ‚Ç¨60++ was far too much for the game in IRS current state, it's well worth buying at $30 and under.
---
Should you get it? How could we know?
---
Show me what I copy pasted, please, I am curious to see.
---
Another reason why they need to separate PvP and PvE.
---
Um, Australia or Austria? 
---
Problems with the client-based in-clip ammo, I'd wager.
---
This bug has literally been in the game since launch. Log in wearing excavator and the bonus is doubled but it reverts back to the intended 100lb bonus after you exit it
---
45 is max level for the dragon
---
I have many complaints about this game but losing quest progression fortunately never happened.
---
Sometimes the quest will pop up in the main screen but its a bug. If you check the mission progression in your pip boy its in the same state as you left it.
---
My camp is near camp mcclintock and I get recruitment blues all the time even though ive finished all game quests.
---
As you are arguing orthogonally to what I intended I will say that there is no story and you can twist in the wind.
---
You do realize they don't actually make the bags themselves right? They usually find another company to do the production work for them regarding these promotional products. They just have certain specifications that must be met for capable and established companies already in the industry.
---
How about the t60 vats matrix overlay? never seen it at watoga vendor since the patch. It's the only one missing constantly. 
---
Really? Nice, thank you.
---
I think power wise it‚Äôs actually ok with the fireproof perk but good God is it annoying. It‚Äôs just non stop. sometimes for a good 5 mins I‚Äôll just hear ‚ÄúWAHHHYYYYYYEEEEEEEAHHHHHH‚Äù over and over and over again. If anything needs a nerf it‚Äôs the annoying ass visuals of the dam thing because I just can‚Äôt see anything when it‚Äôs shooting those things at me. And it definitely needs to land more often.
---
I think player vending machines was already mentioned by the devs.  If people would stop exploiting the game and selling items on ebay and ruining the game.. perhaps the devs would have more time to work on new features.
---
Are you using targeting hut in your pa? Or orange mentats?
---
I had many CTD while using targeting hud, switched to another mod and now I barely crash to desktop. 
---
If you are that curious you can go looking through this sub for the post. I'm not gonna waste my time doing that however.
---
I like to claim workshops, gather resources, fast travel around, so when I crash it's game over. I'm so done. I hate the game. Can't be bothered playing it. Between mobs still being underground and not able to claim the workshop to start with. Fine, server hop. Then when the defend event starts some mob is hiding away somewhere in some corner. Then the game crashes. I love the game really, I love having workshops gathering resources and defending them etc. but I can't play it like this.
---
You want a safe-space .. for your hate .. but people with different oppinions than you are "crappy ad-hominem attacks"
---
Well aren't you a special little snowflake...
---
We play it .. we like it (most of it) .. why are you here?? It's a Fallout forum, dude...
---
What?
---
Yesterday went to whitesprings golf club for some ghoul farming and im pretty sure ghouls got buffed ahah
---
Im level 89, and a bunch of level 68 and 30 ghouls attacked. I felt they were faster and would strike me even when im sprinting. 
---
It took like 4 to 5 hits and im dead.
---
Getting killed by enemies who are 30 levels below me in 4 hits is pretty shitty.
---
Photomode skulling a brewski
---
No I insist, you made the claim 'copy pasted post' and I know it isn't, don't be so sheepish, stand by what you say.
---
Please, provide proof of your claim.
---
Here's what had me puzzled: while the 5k trade limit was removed for others in a patch, for me this only changed with the last one.
---
Oooo, I'll have to look at that. Cheers for the heads up. 
---
And yeah just to note I took mentats just before crashing to find the mob that I couldn't find.
---
At least I‚Äôll already know where everything is if I ever find myself in Morgantown. 
---
Ah that's an antithis for me. I'm here to explore with my main. I don't often replay. With FO4 my 2nd play through included the DLCs which helped but I was concentrating on building the Wasteland up. I had (unimaginative) huge settlements which were interconnected and self sufficient.
---
Maybe I should wait for DLCs but they are why I have my main heavy. 
---
She won‚Äôt freeze solid but she‚Äôll slow way down, but it does seem to help a lot, I‚Äôve built myself around a furious cryolator. 
---
There are few items in game drop tables that are missing. There are only 1star wood armor (which is shame because it would be meta for sneak builds). Some weapons like pipe revolver also don't drop legendary.
---
If you want scout armor pieces or enclave plasma guns, do enclave events. Or buy them from modus.
---
I stopped trying to take over workshops caz this always seemed to happen to me as well. Right after i finished building if it wasent a server disconnect it was a straight to desktop crash. If i managed to avoid those two it was always the mod gliched out ether under the map or somewhere you couldn't get to to kill it and finish the even. 
---
I almost started sniping at a Mirelurk King that was tromping around in someone's camp.  While I was debating "do I want this trouble" vs "he's gonna wreck that C.A.M.P" I noticed he was "owned".  Oh.  How...weird.
---
Yeah agree I avoid going near low levels at savage divide bc of that. But depends on the area. If you go to whitesprings at low levels to try to farm ghoul xp and a high level player shows up, dont blame the player. You shouldn't be there to begin with.
---
Ill have to test this out. I do run around with targeting hut in both my excavator and x01 armors. Really do hope thats the case. Those crashes are annoying af
---
Beerhat, bottlecap sunglasses, red bandanna, Bottle and Cappy jacket and jeans... I'm a post war Blood (gangsigns)

I saw a post of a guy who explained the problem really good. I'll post the link here, when I've found it
---
Im grinding till level 100. Then im done. But im logging less than 10 hours per week.
---
Building on mountain tops .. but .. there be dragons!
---
Theres a great spot near Lake Solomon SE of Whitespring, but I had to move after a tripple SB attack - 1 lvl 65 and 2 lvl 80. üòé
---
Great view .. repair cost, not so great ..
---
If you want to play the 'Give me proof' game how about you provide proof backing up your post first? I see nothing their supporting your claim.
---
"Sheepish" haha 
---
Mt game deleted itself from the launcher 3 times. I can play from the exe but can't get updates. I really don't have the urge to fix the issue. 
---
It's sad. I was such a champion of the game. Talking people in work into getting it. I feel sorry for them a little. 
---
The game is just sell things. Grind white springs and other spawn places. And log off. 
---
Can't wait for the outer world's now. 
---
With the proper mods at least. It has *nearly* the DR of heavy combat, with leagues more energy resist.
---
Those generator exhaust fumes will kill ya!
---
Provide proof of what? You are being rather obtuse.
---
No need to worry about that, the bugs will keep you from doing it anyway : \^ )
---
There's a trailer in the Savage Divide. Directly east of Harpers Ferry and northwest of where the the bee is on the map.
---
dude no offense but you literally play this game as a full time job and as a result your discussion about content is in my humble opinion void because thats an absurd amount of playtime
---
Paid full price for this back in November and don‚Äôt regret a thing. Sure it has bugs but I can‚Äôt complain as Ive sunk 350hrs into this game. Still having fun.
---
I love trying to chow down on my Salisbury Steak only for the hover function on the Pipboy get stuck on my Stimpacks and I take a big ole bite out of medicine tube.
---
I've had one for a month or so now, never going to eat it. 
---
I would love to see something like this implemented. I am currently level 84 and I find that the biggest issue is I have a ton of somewhat decent weapons and armor, but nothing to aim for. I also think that implementing an increase in the amount of quests for each faction (maybe something in the form of raids) so we could have some mmo interaction, instead of just constantly having to fight each other for legendary kills. I want to be able to band up with me and say 10 players for a lobby to kill some gigantic mutated monstrosity that will take actual effort and have some cool unique drops.
---
You made a claim that a scorch beasts used it's sonic ability for 5 minutes. Provide proof of that claim. I am not being obtuse at all, I am just doing what you are doing.
---
Yes.
---
Bulk junk/sell junk. Get rid of unused ammo and heavy ammo like missiles and mini nukes. Don‚Äôt horde loads of weapons that you probably won‚Äôt use.
---
The thing is. I was the only person in the area and there was only one mob that I could see glowing purple, so I'm not sure if that is the exact issue, but I'm sure it does have something to do with the berry mentats, because since scrapping my targeting HUD Excavator helmet my crashes have reduced significantly. And that crash was like as soon as I seen the purple glow of that mob that was hiding. Still then there are disconnects which can't be attributed to that. The best all round solution, including fixing that particular bug, is the ability to rejoin the last server and still have ownership of your workshops for like 5 minutes after crashing/disconnecting. Because that is one of the most frustrating things, other than crashing at the end of a silo, or Whitespring nuke or Fissure Prime, etc.
---
What I'm talking about is in even somewhat implemented in the game, just not far enough, with the Camden park dailies and monster mash event. 
---
I'm creating a character named Kevin Kostner now, just in case.
---
That's a FEATURE.
---
'The non-player characters are all there, ready to share their stories with you, but it‚Äôs you who makes those stories live, because your character has agency and meaningful choices where the NPCs do not. ... Tamriel is a world that continues in constant development, and where that world goes next depends upon what you did and how you reacted to it! ... What you do in Tamriel, and how you feel about what you did, steers the direction of future development.'
---
This is the mindset behind 76, and why I continue to defend it to those who think it should be left to die. 76 is the community's game and the love on this subreddit is what gives me hope. 
---
Shame Lawrence is leaving. He's always been interesting to watch on streams. Hope things go well for him
---
That's flawed. If anything, PvP should be on only inside the buildable area of the workshop.
---
Explains why the station crashed I guess
---
Have you got any marine combat armor plans or handmade mods? Could I please do something in exchange for them?
---
PSN dtb7591
---
I hope it does fix it for you!
---
‚ÄúHurr durr, similar content to another post, muh copy paste‚Äù
---
Or at LEAST some scrap metal
---
No, don't buy the game yet. It's in a horrible state right now. Wait a few more months and check to see if they fixed the game breaking bugs
---
Mmh. Maybe it's a different issue. I had my crashes most of the time at Whitespring or Fissure Prime and barely when I was the only player in a region. But I have never used mentats so maybe thats the problem. 
---
And no good loot from those fuckers
---
What. Or drop the nuke on the edge of prime fissur site so you can pull her out of the nuke zone. Which most people don‚Äôt do
---
Exactly! You know what I mean. I'm glad we are on the same page.
---
Human-ghoul-suit hybrids. They‚Äôre humans who got trapped in their suits once the bombs fell, presumably they became some form of mutant or ghoul because of the radiation
---
Upvote. Thank you .
---
That happens with two shot weapons more often than not, anything else not so much.
---
Literally play the game at all and live long enough to fight a scorch beast and you can easily see that they do it non stop. What you‚Äôre saying by him copy and pasting is like people saying that duped guns are a problem, if its a problem people will complain about it. This is one of those said problems where something needs to be done about them 
---
I saw this over a month ago and was hoping something similar would be patched in already.. I would use it but it requires others to have the mod installed, so I'm not sure how practical it is..
---
Same. Last patch drove friends away
---
Frezz the foid! Frezz the foid!
---
&gt;fight SBQ in normal armor outside of nuke zone
---
Yep, but if you die there there is chance you will be instantly respaned in nuke zone and radiation will kill you if you dont put on hazmat in few seconds. If you die event will again spawn u there and will, until queen dies.
---
Some scorchbeast queens have radiation aura around them (like glowing bloated ones) which is doing 20rad per sec damage if you don't have any protection.
---
Those two are real threat if you are wearing only combat armor pieces.
---
about 30sec and 10-15 2mm amo.. and the food what u can make from them pretty good.
---
Consoles dont get mods
---
Omg I want to be King Mole.
---
Those dupers/mulers will be very happy!
---
I would say you are insane to play the game for 7 hours every day since release if you didnt like the game.  
---
Now im not saying people shouldn't complain about things they dont like but the way people do it bugs me with the lack of patience people have, people are comlaining about the lack of new content even though no other fallout would have had new content by this point, they complain about things that have been asked from bethesda "fix PvP, seperate the servers" so they announce a PvP mode and people lose their minds saying they never asked for it
---
One of the reasons I made a [webpage](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/index.html) is to see how an "unseeded" RNG would drop items. There are several factors that affect how likely your desired item drops:
---
* ***Loot pool size of the lengedary enemies***. If all of them draw from the entire pool of possible legendary items, that's \~1:200 for a particular type of weapon/armor right there. It would be more favorable if enemies and/or locations would work from a much smaller pool, so one can farm them in a more targeted fahion.
---
* ***Multistar enemy can drop less starred item***. This was one of the nerfs, introducing another dilution of multistar loot. I don't know the exact chances ingame for a 2\* to drop a 1\* and so on, but the webpage is parameterized so that there is effectively only \~1:100 chance for you to find a 3\* enemy which also drops a 3\* item. If they dropped as many stars as their level like in the early versions, you could have had a 1:10 chance for a 3\* enemy to spawn for example.
---
* ***Too many prefixes***. There are like 20-23 prefixes for the first star, which makes getting a desired effect \~1:20 chance. For example, the nocturnal + 30% damage against X make up 7 prefixes that compete for that single two-shot effect. 1:3 chance to land on those 7 prefixes.
---
* ***Explosive is a main effect requiring at least a 2\* drop***. As a main effect, it has 1:7 chance to be picked for a 2-3\* ranged drop, given that you get a ranged drop (1:4 chance on its own) and an overall \~1:300 chance to find one.
---
Given the all above, a specific TSE weapon type could be as rare as \~1:2,000,000 while any TSE could be as rare as \~1:5000. Thats 2 million legendaries of any star killed.
---
How is that so many youtubers and streamers found so many TSEs? I can think of two reasons other than pure luck. Either selection bias (they wouldn't post a video about finding 1\* useless items, only the "good" 3\* ones), or they get an artificially reduced (less items to chose from)/adaptive (looks at the inventory and drops similar items) loot tables on the server for their character/account for some reason.
---
I know many measured repeated effect/type drops but in properly implemented RNGs, so-called streaks are possible (like throwing 3-4 6s in a row with a dice). It is possible though that for performance reasons, they implemented a custom/poor RNG that when used for picking items/effects/levels, they can get stuck around a value resulting in the picking of the same or neighboring items/effects/levels over and over.
---
I've said it before, but I'll say it again in the hope repetition manifests it into the world through sheer force of will:
---
FALLOUT 76: Capital Wastes
---
We know Appalachian ghouls went East and there are Whitespring messages from Raven Rock. If BGS releases updates the Washington D.C. from Fallout 3 into a new 76 area, similar to ESO with Morrowind, after fixing gameplay &amp; stability bugs, people will come back, discover, or stay in Appalachia for years
---
Yes and this company needs to setup its machines to produce and embroider the bags to Bethesdas specs.
---
Cool, now I just need to drop a weigh reduced one.
---
No what‚Äôs worse is they spam it and your visibility drops to zero and everything starts running at like 4-5 FPS.
---
yeah, because its still a problem.
---
Lol take my upvote 
---
The exakt same thing happened to me. I scrapped a couple of legs and the game told i unlocked bos, but i cannot find it. Neither legs, nor arms or torso. Its kinda frustrating! :(
---
Go back to fort defiance for the arm plan. It‚Äôs in the terminal. 
---
While I'd like scout armor, it needs to be legendary - but thanks for the headsup.
---
It's to ensure players to tune in. I always tune in but never get to 4 players. Since the update though, I got to 3 at one point which is better than nothing
---
And my camp!
---
wow this comment and the original sounds like poetry. I use the fireproof Perk and refractor. I also use the Perk in charisma that allows you to pacify them for a brief period of time.
---
Maybe I played a little over the first week(and I played every hour of BETA) but around maybe 140-150 hours. Kinda got bored at the 100 mark but kept going to see if there was more to it.
---
Love the concepts. Hate the execution.
---
I always try to have social interactions and always ask people how they feel about how the game has been handled. I've never met a person who was satisfied with fallout 76 outside of the delusional white knights that used to rule this sub reddit back in the day. Thankfully 90% of them left as they honestly were more interested in whiteknighting than actually playing. 
---
i would be happy with a wall mounted platform where you can place a normal turret
---
Now use it to break into a vault 
---
Wow that was one hell of a read but dam does that explain a lot. Guess for the time being ill have to remove that mod and use another or just ne without one. Thanks for the link!
---
I agree that drastic measures are necessary. I would respond to your whole post but it was a really long and I'm in the vicious jaws of insomnia at the moment. And honestly the Diablo example was a bit of an oversimplification. If you recall during it Diablo's process of fixing itself they lost a game director and most of their other staff. And that game direct turned out to be a majority of the entire problem.
---
Ok thats why a factory of scorched is no problem but i cant get past 3 cave crickets on the way out..... 
---
Good luck! For me it helped
---
Take a look at my post history and the things I complain about. I can't share anything beyond a lv1 perk since the hotfix, and people constantly can't loot the queen or even find her meat pile. The game has ongoing major issues and I have every right to complain because I still play every day. I'm the exact opposite of the type of person you think is "not even playing the game" while complaining about it.
---
All monsters - VAT crit melee anywhere
---
You're delusional 
---
I can tell from my own experience it works great! There already is a big community using it.
---
And it's very easy to give a shoutout if there's gonna be a sbq or ws nuke. 
---
It also has a trade, clan and party chat ;)
---
I'm not disputing that it's a problem. I am talking about the constant copy paste of 60% of the posts in this sub. People have a proper discussion on a topic, then someone goes and makes the same post a week later and people have the exact same discussion. So people who have valid posts never get theirs seen as people circle jerk over the same issues over and over.
---
Yeah, his name is posted several times by me and others elsewhere in the thread. Learn to click the button to read comments and go to hell asshole.
---
Nah, it'll be the clickbait cunt juicehead.
---
I believe you have a better chance the higher your luck is
---
Platform? 
---
Clearly you were supposed to be using a legendary two shot nocturnal homing missile launcher.

I made a post about this before and it didnt get any traction, recorded the exploit and posted it..

Sweet, maybe I will try it. Does it work cross server?
---
Yes, it has a global chat across al servers + a local channel for the +/- 100m area arround you
---
Still no replay? And how about the T60 Vats Matrix overlay? I never saw it since the patch. And it's the only one, which is conatantly missing at watoga trader, I think.
---
First day with 3 other friends, super excited to play...
---
Now none of us play, I only check this sub to see what Bethesda's last fuck up was, and nobody I know will buy a Bethesda game at launch ever again.
---
You can add me if you like. Friendly with a rather strange sense of humor. You have been warned. Same name on Xbox as on here.  
---
I Hate to say it, but im burnt out already from the game. 
---
Until there is some actual content im done :(
---
I really wanted this game to be amazing, fleshed out world that changes with new events, etc. but its not. 
---
Don't even return tbh.
---
If it takes a AAA gaming company months to make their half-assed game enjoyable, they're not worth your time.
---
Happy cake day homie
---
This is the issue with pve players they don't think. If you're put in a no win situation you have ways out, easiest way is to swap servers to let go of the workshop. Pvp is not an exploit and is a fully intended function of the game, It gives you a warning when you claim it, you can be anywhere on the map and be toggled pvp by anyone on the opposing team.
---
He lost 1500 caps, so he must have kept respawning thinking he's safe, how many times does it take to figure out your not going to win.  You can play the victim all you want but you chose to keep spawning into danger. [Different game](https://youtu.be/7NvnelJLQI4?t=90) but similar "your not going to win here, you should spawn somewhere else scenario" but instead keeps doing the same thing over and over.
---
Op is level 315, and you thinks this is an exploit? You agreed to pvp the moment you took the the workshop, regardless of where you are on the map, that is the drama not knowing who is going to kill you.  They just found an efficient way to work the game mechanics. 
---
Enter the pvp downvote fairies.
---
I'm pretty sure that's what this guy was saying. Your can't sell the non-existent item you didn't even get
---
Man, most people learned "I do not define the world" in kindergarten. If somebody says that something affects them then it affects them and you, a perfect stranger with a massive ego issue, don't know them better than they know themselves. 
---
Also, mature people don't go around trumpeting how mature they are, insulting other people and insisting that others are still children simply because Mr. "Mature" disagrees with them. 
---
You're the one who needs to grow up. 
---
There's literally laws pertaining to false advertising that they breached when they launched the game in such a bad state. They're fighting legal battles atm because they mislead people so badly. Stop brown-nosing a company that doesn't care about you, stop defending a crappy industy, and demand better.
---
My guess is they don't want to screw up again so soon. (At all would be preferable but that's wishful thinking.) They're evaluating the situation before they put anything else out.
---
How is that better than it just knowing which part you want to target? Before I'd constantly go too far, not far enough etc 
---
Holy shit there‚Äôs still EB games around?
---
I genuinely stopped playing this game for the last 2 months because of scorchbeasts. They're cunts. 
---
*People are complaining about scorchbeasts and i am here running under cargobot for 30minutes.*
---
Dirt or a camp fire :D
---
While I'm not sure about going f2p I definitely think this could be one of those titles that would thrive if it became a permanent $15 or $20 title. There's many games priced around this price point that succeed such as Stardew Valley, CS:GO, Black Desert Online, and more. It's better to have 100 people buy it for $20 than have 5 people buy it for $60. 
---
When you are hopping you can‚Äôt pick up any plans unless it is one you want. Hopping should change the plans. If you pick one up a new plan won‚Äôt respawn until after 20 hours I think? 
---
I paid $80 for a product that has yet to be delivered. This sort of crap from game devs is completely unacceptable. No one should have to go play another game (for, at this point, several weeks/months) while all the wrinkles are ironed out. The more pressure people put on Bethesda, the better. 
---
Australia, Tasmania to be specific!
---
MrSnek123, I think. Should work but i'm not certain. 
---
I'm playing, actualy played 400hours, whats breaking game? O.o
---
Rocket and spotlight is the only combo that works well, but i ain't spending the budget for that.
---
A separate defense budget would work for me. 
---
MrSnek123. Not 100% sure, but I think that's it.
---
It's not like you're even asking for new assets, as there are plenty of turret models in the game that are wall/ceiling mounted 
---
For the Flatwoods monster, if you see from afar the same vfx as the Mysticism magic in Oblivion, that's him. 
---
Never thought anything would be alive there to be honest. One is on fire, one has red vine infestation and the other one i have no idea, but probably some other horrible shit. 
---
If you want max dmg with melee, take the 3 perks max lv for you weapon type ( 1h/ 2h), twisted muscles mutation , martial artist and incisor . Go with 20% hp, pick the nerd rage perk , bloody mess and farm for unyielding pieces , to get a complete set . With a blooded melee , you‚Äôre going to do massive amounts of dmg . If you‚Äôre not a fan of high risk right reward builds , swap out for a instigating melee , and go with full health and a vanguard set to increase your defenses . You‚Äôll lose a quite bit of dmg , but you won‚Äôt die as often . Has a backup weapon, take the 3 lv one comando or rifleman perks from perception and use a rifle to deal with some enemies or to avoid getting surrounded by groups ( like ghouls for example ) 
---
It would just need to be a static page that says ‚Äúlol still broken‚Äù
---
There's usually one near Charleston in thr dried up canal/dam area.
---
Did you ever find out where you get plans for a sledgehammer?
---
I had a wonderfully refreshing time playing the beta. No server issues, very little bugs, a great time overall.
---
I stopped playing a few weeks ago because I am am constantly running into enemies that are 30 levels higher than me and I an stuck with pretty bad weapons. I changed to melee and did better but I don't like melee in fallout games, I like small guns.
---
Eventually it wasn't fun at all despite being some of the best fun gaming for a long time in the beta.
---
I have played solo the entire time though. I do feel like playing again so I might tonight.
---
There is a lot of false information and exaggeration on this reddit by mainly pve players, but The mechanics involves a team. #1 will find workshop owner on map and stalk him, #2 will start claiming the workshop, this will flag the owner into pvp with team, since the stalker already has them in his sights it should be an easy kill. When owner re-spawns #2 bumps the workshop, and flags everyone into pvp again.  You are still accurate that the moment owner takes the workshop he forfeits his immortal card and is liable to be conscripted into pvp at any time, anywhere, by anyone.
---
I had 2 scorch beast just appear as I left my base and do this to me. Same as OP, I just left the server. My broken leg armours awaits my return.
---
Lmao I remember getting my first cargobot I had to place my camp and make a stairway to heaven to damage it 
---
It's funny because, yeah they managed to do it in a short time, but they also kind of ruined their own magic moments. Those moments you can only have at the start of a game, where you have no clue how things work and you just walk around. They are short. 
---
Does that give an achievement, if they eat you? /s
---
I like to play in pacifist mode AND farm robots for their fusion core. 
---
It is a rare bug, I've had 5 bullet black powder rifle magazine too sometimes. It has something to do with switching weapons and getting wrong guns magazine bullet count to another weapon. Had over 40 bullet pump action shotguns happened as well
---
Those ‚Äúshrines on top of the watoga buildings are scorchbeast nests. Not made by cults. Just FYI.
---
Bethesda: good that you enjoy them that much, here's a buff to them for you!
---
Single player vs multiplayer online makes a large difference to load on your system. You're dealing with a lot more processing. 
---
I have about 9k atoms I‚Äôve acquired from doing challenges only. Literally can‚Äôt find anything to spend them on 
---
[https://youtu.be/MvjbOZOuTCg?t=244](https://youtu.be/MvjbOZOuTCg?t=244) If this guy did not seek revenge, i could wait for him to come back and claim that workshop again and kill him again, this is griefing. Killing someone until he leaves server.
---
I disagree. Also there‚Äôs a difference between being wrong and having a different opinion btw
---
That‚Äôd be great. I have a barebones house with a few turrets and those take up most of the budget, as well as being mostly useless
---
Make sure there is some open ground near you when you fight them.
---
They always land for me.
---
Only after ten minutes of shit!
---
Who puts a silencer on a shotgun?  Half the fun is the noise.
---
Yeah,that's bullshit, as it is when mole rats do it. Surfacing thru concrete, come on. I don't know if radscorpions do it too, but mole rats also spawn a dig hole *after the die* really?
---
That would be the original programmers of Skyrim dragons 
---
I agree it may seem like ten minutes, but if you time it I bet it isn't.
---
Anyway, you know what's great about repeatedly banging your head into a wall?  The feeling when you stop.
---
I *did* time it.
---
Where did you find the marine?
---
I don't really like how pvp works in this game, but hammering down someone trying to claim my nuclear plant is fun though.
---
I didn't realize these were worth anything?
---
I still prefer radscorpions (the FO3/NV type were not that bad) to Cazadors... 
---
It's definitly not only marine. Just found bos soldier uniform and sturdy robot legs.
---
He took the workshop, he agreed to pvp...
---
Players are randomly inviting me to teams since im a high level to kill me. They try to invite you to a team that already owns a workshop, crash their game so you get ownership and kill you with the method OP has described. Before people know it, they loose all their caps if they keep spawning. 
---
Shady game mechanics 100%. 
---
Yeah, I tried to fight a level 2, (on my second account, at level 33), and we had a fistfight, then I shot him in the face. Neither of us took any damage. I gave him some loot and stuff first - I‚Äôm not a dick. But I really want that ‚ÄúGood Grief‚Äù trophy - it‚Äôs the one thing keeping me from getting 100% completion :( 
---
TBH, this game does world design and audio design fantastically
---
The Turrets I do have only work 2% at the best of time 
---
Have you tried modding a combat armour helmet? Because there‚Äôs a chance what you‚Äôve unlocked is the paint scheme for the helmet. 
---
I did this too and you who I got mad at?
---
Me
---
Because it was my own damn fault.
---
Went thru this with molerat's teeth as well.
---
Just don‚Äôt go to west tec roof, I fear you might have a heart attack or something bad. 
---
I never said he has to seek revenge, as long as he holds a workshop, anyone on the opposing team can toggle them pvp (read previous post), and kill them anywhere that the owner is on the map.
---
Logged in earlier to play my favourite resource manager game... Scorchbeast that somehow has x-ray vision and can see me IN-FUCKING-SIDE my camp. Proceeds to start ripping it to shreds. I just went 'fuck this shit' and left the server as well.
---
Why, Didn't they have solar in New Vegas?
---
If you are really into hoarding lots of weapons and making PA etc there is pretty much 2 options. Either make a mule and have a buddy help you move stuff. The other option is keeping all armor, weapons and ammo on your character. Get a chem/food armor piece and use bandolier. 
---
With a decent STR level and the weight reduction armor piece you will still have enough space but you normal junk weight will be partially replaced by armor and weapons. Get atleast 1 unyielding piece. Pairing unyielding with radicool with give you more weight playing space. No need to fully proc unyielding at all times, radicool is at max effect for me at 50 is % hp Might want to ditch most explosives as well if you aren't using the weight card for it. Frags suck anyways compared to some energy nades.
---
This will end up in you losing less junk since you have less on you. But also making more stash/station runs. One of my characters has a ton of weapons and armor on him.
---
Yeah it's absurd, we can build decon showers there is no logical reason we shouldn't be able to build that
---
Not sure on numbers however I try to go Perforating
---
Gold fork and .38 ammo FTW
---
2 months waiting for promised atoms when the first reply said it would take couple days, and their newest reply saying they gave the 500 atoms but not really is a bigger meme.
---
PvP is trash in this game, like the rest of bethesda.
---
You can kill players if they don't fight back. You just need a battling laser or similar gun that inflicts non stop damage. They loose 0.5% each hit taken. Or something along those lines of damage. Takes about a minute but is possible. 
---
 But if they attack back it's game on and you inflict normal damage.
---
 I did it for a couple of games but gets boring Fast. As a much higher level sees your bounty and uses that sparkle crackle, one shot kill gun thing. 
---
 Never did it again ..
---
Seriously!!! I'd like to think there is a reason, because unless the developers don't play (or only use a Dev server) I don't think they can see what the average player has to go through
---
He was close. He was more of a cracker monster. A grahm cracker monster if you will 
---
i have never had a problem with ghouls on my main unless heavily out numbered. which wasn't a problem in fallout 4 because 2 handed melee had cleave damage. yet another nerf going from one game to another.
---
On my rifleman alt has immense trouble with those bullet spongy ghouls. but he is only level 44.
---
Missile Turrets only seem to work well if there is a regular one next to it, or else they get destroyed when reloading try placing a missile turret next to each regular (or heavy one) the combo works better
---
True, but keep in mind, you'll need the perk card for crafting melee weapons up to level 3 (Makeshift Warrior), and meat hooks take 2 screws each to craft, so start saving up! :)
---
Don't appologize to players who joined pvp event, [eat them.](https://youtu.be/eN0hbQALkag?t=97)
---
Plenty of location Mountain videos on YouTube. There's even a lead delosit at the top of the cliff and an acid deposit at the bottom in one location should you wish to mine whilst playing. 
---
Yep i got the crafting recipe for this somewhere along the line and it's my go-to ghoul-slaying weapon. I just love how you can fire it at the ground and the shot arcs up and hits them. Decent damage for an energy weapon too.
---
It's absurd.......... They need to make it more engaging or more of an event instead of: fast travel and shoot this, them fast travel ahead of it path and repeat
---
He wasn‚Äôt part of it. Innocent bystander. Hence the apology. 
---
Ah crap sorry man.  Sometimes I forget that no official support means no support at all on console.
---
[Check my setup haha.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw58NzHaI0g) have same gun as you  (have also quad limb damage one, but that sux)
---
Had my camp at Seneca rocks for a while... It seems they register vertical distance as horizontal which means they can consistently remain in unaccessible areas
---
A work around
---
bury the workshop bench in stash boxes and or foundations rendering it un-reachable, unless they start destroying the boxes which gives every one on the server a "blank has become wanted" message so all you have to do is check to see if they've become wanted at the workshop, then block them and any one moving in your direction so they can not see you.
---
I had this yesterday. Thought it was a harmless bug. 
---
With one lockpick card (any), I had level 1 lockpick. With any two, I had level 3 lockpick and with all three, I had level 4 lockpick.
---
I did not have any magazine effect. I may have had diseases I wasn't curing as I am a Plague Walker.
---
Then how you was able to kill him? Did he shot you or what? You are not even able to kill your target second time. 
---
The plans drop from robobrains. ;)
---
cause the PvP servers would have noone on them.
---
i shot a load all over my open sign and now i need someone that‚Äôs tall enough to wipe it off 
---
They need to be equally balanced of ground and air time.
---
The only way to get things to change is to keep complaining.
---
Laser Weapons have it worse. Tesla has it good compared with them.
---
Didn‚Äôt shoot me and no I didn‚Äôt kill them.
---
They ran for it as soon as I mistakenly shot them and died as they fell from the 2nd story of a building in Charleston. 
---
Because he's horribled by fallout 76.
---
As far as I know it‚Äôs pure RNG, no difference made from luck stats.
---
should do rad damage, depending on water loaded
---
Purified water - 0 rads (maybe heals target, for team healing)
---
boiled - 2 rads
---
dirty water - 5 rads
---
toxic water - 10 rads
---
Toxic goo - 35 rads
---
:D :D :D no way, this must be so funny :D :D :D  please have video, please have video
---
The problem is I was wanted and they couldn't do any DMG to me, ghouls running for the rescue and healing me up that's not very normal to me either and yes I was able to kill people without any issue.
---
I've equiped 3 of the perks and I had level 2 picklock skill...
---
Ooh 100% this.
---
The first time I came across a Scorchbeast that was literally spamming the sonic attack non stop, I assumed it must simply be broken.
---
Only to hear plenty of other people since having the same issue.
---
I also remember the very first time I took a public workshop and the defend event popped, and it was a friggin scorchbeast. At that point I hadn‚Äôt even **attempted** to solo a scorchbeast.
---
I went through every single round of ammo in my inventory AND my stash, used the tinker bench to create a pitiful amount of extra ammo which I also went through, searched every dead body in the area and used the weapons/ ammo off them...
---
Eventually got the scorchbeast down to the merest smidgen of health... Only to get disconnected. 
---
I didn‚Äôt go back on for nearly 2 weeks in disgust üòÇ
---
I've got Two Shot Tesla Rifle and I'm not even using it.
---
I did think of that but forgot to add üòÇ

Today I wanted to try some PvP, put together some perk cards for heavy guns and low hp build jumped in to my 51b power armour tuned in to hunted radio, no one there then I start attacking players and camps to get bounty on me to encourage others to fight. After first fights I was impressed how good my build is.... And then it happened ghouls start healing my rads and health up to 100% then I realised it's not my build but something is wrong. I stop fighting and was observing what's going on, 3 players wanted to kill me but none of them could do any dmg to me and all mobs start ignoring me entirely I could shoot them and they will not fight back. I have no idea what exactly caused this, something is definitely wrong I'm not touching PvP until next update. üòû
---
Ikr, it seems perfectly fine for me, and just hit the 260 hour mark earlier, its mainly people just complaining that their 2 shots aren't op anymore
---
I came across a set of cabins northeast of Bolton Greens (and west of Monogha Power Plant). One of them is unoccupied, quite large and basically undamaged. Don't mind the pile of decaying animal carcasses in the upstairs bedroom though... XD
---
Steve Rogers voice: call me old fashioned, but targeting level 2 players is real cheap, even for a trophy.
---
Tony Stark voice: even at our richest, we are still garbage.
---
I don't have that trophy either :(
---
Two pussies shot me in the back earlier even though I was busy leaving after they told me I have to leave or die. If you just tell me to leave then I'll leave because I have pacifist on and can't be bothered. But there fucks shot me in the back with their TSE guns as I was walking out. Too bad they didn't know what build I was running. I pistol VATS crit these kids like 6 times. I'd just go to a nearby place, get my crit bar, sneak in and oneshot them then run away.
---
I went from like 1300 caps to nearly 3000 in half an hour.
---
Then after that two other guys came along and just killed me without a word. So I just went back to the munitions factory and stood on the terminal switching it to .38 the whole time as the idiots wasted hundreds of shots trying to kill me while I refused to hit them back.
---
Thankfully it either glitched out or just didn‚Äôt work. I immediately regretted it lol
---
I would let you farm me for the trophy! Are you on ps4?
---
Wow I tell you. This game just all around poorly designed. I been defending this game but so much has been hit or miss and just outright pissed me off. 
---
It's well worth it 
---
I just in the 200 hour mark and I haven't even beaten the storyline yet, given I'm pretty sure I'm at the end now 
---
It's got bugs and glitches but nothing new since it's a Bethesda game 
---
If you liked fo4 you will like this game too 
---
The truest statement EVER.
---
&gt; The Workshop Owner will then be killable by the team, but not vice versa.
---
Just want to be sure of the mechanic here, I find the PvP in this game confusing. Are they NOT killable because you are in pacifist mode? 
---
The slow loading of the Rifle meant I went with quicker reload and armor penetration. 
---
Having an extra bullet in the mag. Which is all you get from the other for me wasn‚Äôt worth it. 
---
This is not a true scale of how many people play the game. By it's nature, Reddit is a community of dedicated hardcore types. 
---
Your sample size of less than 200 shouldn't really give you an idea of how the game is doing. 
---
However, a good way to make it more accurate is too look at how many people login to this sub throughout the day and compare that to your findings. Your internal data should in some form count the people who don't participate on your study. 
---
ok, but how you measured that all you get from other? :) I know it's difficult to measure differences, that's why I'm asking if anybody knows the numbers behind it.
---
It was starting to feel like having storylines and characters in a video game were almost mandatory, so those were removed.
---
Don‚Äôt know the numbers just talking from actual experience.
---
I used to have a rifle as my range weapon and found that quicker fire rate was more important than more shots before reloading.
---
Especially when you had multiple enemies. 
---
I was running from some level 50 something scorched that someone spawned in (level 20 something here)  and I guess we were still within radius of him as we ran up on a fissure site unknowingly. Scorchbeast and several 50 something scorched kept killing us. Over encumbered. Couldn‚Äôt drop anything as I kept dying. Couldn‚Äôt get my stuff back because I kept dying.  
---
Left server. New server we just ran. Had to scorchbeasts On is for a good 5 minute. I hate them. 
---
Scorchedbeasts are neither fun nor rewarding to battle. They take a huge amount of ammo and health for very little reward.
---
I went to hunt one recently and gave up after 10 missiles from the Bunker Buster hardly scratched it. 
---
I don‚Äôt think they should be easy by any means but certainly fun and rewarding which they aren‚Äôt. 
---
Also why can they still kill me when I‚Äôm inside? That is SHIT! 
---
Clearly you should've gone VATS and melee. 
---
If I'm reading your post correctly the method you showed is even griefy! It's doing what OP is describing but without the need for a team. By cancelling out of the claim you can do this solo! Is that correct?
---
I usually snipe from distance, when close-combat my explosive shotgun do the job ;) So I'll stay with perforating one, which seems to have the higher armor penetration.
---
Well people have been complaining about scorch beasts for months and it hasn't changed. So that statement is extremely far from the truth. 
---
Good call. 5 rounds for more damage. Don‚Äôt have to worry too much about reload speed as you have distance on your side. 
---
Add it to the list of shit they didn't include in there alpha version( full release if you were wondering) 
---
Perhaps he is.  But my character is still leveling up, hasn't got a TSE or grognak axe yet, just some relatively mediocre weapons.  If I actually try to do the questline instead of grind, I face enemies that can take my full clip of ammo from the unique shotgun directly to the face without dying.
---
Tedious is definitely the word.
---
You don't need to explain anything. No one is acting like they are forced to play. The game is just a bit terrible at the moment and people are complaining about it.
---
If you're hoping to stop that, you cant.
---
Absolutely right that cycle is normal, but unless it's something really special, the bump / shot in the arm to the player base new content brings, it won't be enough to resuscitate the game with so much else vying for attention of those same fairweather players. I think this game is on its last legs.
---
They didn't think to include a lot in this game.
---
You should not say the word caz....
---
No.
---
Radscorpions are evil! Overpowered, they aggro you and don't let go. In addition, they're resistant af!   
---
Most einous mobs  
---
Same here! 3 SBs show up and just suck the life out of me. I went through at least 40 stim Packs trying to fight them. And stuck it out till they were dead.... all for 2 stim packs and a purified water..... and three show up at Lewisburg station as well. But at least there I had some cover and they landed quite often. 
---
if you are on a team with a higher level player, you will have to actually hit anything that gets killed. if you fail to do so you get no XP
---
I was just playing and slaying with the Tesla rifle I'm Lvl 68 and it's such a good mob killer especially when there's others who want to shoot things too 
---
What about charred ghouls? 
---
Unfortunately I think I was right 
---
They haven't even made it so the .50 Calibur mod for snipers does more damage than .308 it's safe to say of there's a problem it'll be ignored 
---
Can't pvp before level 5.
---
It is the journey, not the goal. Xp nerf, for me, is the best reason to start another character. Pick up optimal perks faster and try to explore more thoroughly
---
Ye
---
That is how ya know I am about that friendly life :(
---
The money came from the %60 sale fee - you think they deserve more money for the ass backwards product they delivered?
---
No, why would I want to do that?
---
I'd be happy if they just made it more transparent.
---
Yeah they go for loads for some reason 
---
a software (game) has to be stable. so nobody is making funktionality for the case of a crash. this would be like
---
installing life jacket under the seat in the car because it can fell of a bridge in a river. the developers are going to 
---
spend the time in fixing the crashes. if the crashes and disconnects are gone you shouldn't need such a functionality.
---
&gt; Edit: In the title it suppose to be unkillable 
---
Nah, I think you got it right the first time :)
---
With a poisonous sting 
---
 *Whoever the fuck programmed scorchbeasts needs to be fucking fired. Absolutely ridiculous -gameplay-*  
---
Whoever let the game out in the state it was also deserves to be fired.
---
Yes, we're looking at you Todd.
---
I found a suppressor's explosive handmade in a paper bag at the whitespring station. I assumed it was because the previous owner found a three star handmade and left it there at the time. If I had known this was an issue people were having, I would have set up camp next to the station and put up like a lost and found. The only problem would be how would I know you're telling the truth? I'm going to screen cap my arsenal from time to time in case this happens to me.
---
P.S. My friend accidentally dropped his TS flamer he was using with his Medic Friendly Fire build last night. RNG Karma showed my healer friend some mercy and SBQ dropped a Medic's Flamer 3* with 25% faster fire rate and I think +50 damage resist while firing. Now if only Beth would fix the ridiculous crafting cost for flamer fuel...
---
Does that mean if you are all equal levels you share the xp for kills even if you don't personally tag them?
---
&gt; its like they poach there dead buddies and use it to fight you 
---
Thats exactly what they do.  I've watched super mutants walk over to a dead buddy and pick up their gun because it's better than the one they had.  Scorched do it too.  Ghouls don't because they don't use guns.
---
hes not selling you ranger outfits. hes telling you you can collect ranger outfits and sell them to vendors
---
From what I can tell each arch can proc effects. My vampire tesla has replaced stim packs for me.
---
That quenches other people's thirst at the cost of a few rads?
---
Only play mmos 
---
One thing I do, which hasn‚Äôt been mentioned. 
---
If you ALWAYS have weight reduction perk cards on for a certain weapon type. Such as heavy guns, keep those in you inventory vs in your stash. I have a bunker buster that I am waiting to be good again, and I keep it in my inventory vs my stash. Saves me 40lbs. 
---
Same goes for ammo, I made a TON of 2mm when I got my first explosive gauss, and I keep all the ammo on me with ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù on. Without it said ammo would be most of my stash.
---
No whoever hit it gets the xp
---
Yeah... Fuck cave crickets.
---
I think it rolls on the first time you activate it (think like chest loot), and then that result it in effect until the next reset. If you do win, it probably re-rolls or forces a failure after (I don't know if the pie machine stays empty of the preserved pie or not).
---
Isn't it amazing that in the year 2019, we have a games company entirely clueless about PVP game design? It boggles the mind that nobody at Bethesda plays video games...
---
Maybe they should have reduced the chances of legendary enemies spawning instead of the chances of them dropping something remotely interesting.
---
The Flatwoods monster kidnapped Todd
---
Umm... that's like 90% of what we have. I run into so few griefers, it's almost never a problem for me. Ever since the TSE and explosive stacking nerfs came into play, the few I run into are almost adorable. Poor widdle gweifers :)
---
In Australia yes, they are one of the main game shop sellers. 
---
i found one at silo bravo like two months ago, havent seen another one since then
---
I too wish to visit your camp :)
---
Are there musical instruments?
---
It can appear anywhere at random. Ive came across it a few times, including just south of Watoga train station and last encounter just north of camp venture. That time it chased me all the way to Harper's Ferry. So I killed it.
---
Those guys probably didn't want to pvp so of course they didn't like you
---
Hit level 60-something, started ghoul farming at white springs on occasion. Just got done standing in one place in the golf club and letting every ghoul in there mob me at once while I one or two shot them with my super sledge. Went through two stim packs.
---
Stroll towards hotel and get ambushed by 3 star legendary rad scorpion and end up going through TWENTY stimpacks and a deth+respawn killing the damn thing. And it was lower level than all those ghouls
---
True.   It‚Äôs nowhere near as bad for my now as it was prior to the last patch but it‚Äôs still a concern.   
---
Is 10K enough for an outfit? I can offer 2 more legendary weapons+another sentinel set if you want
---
Better yet look for an online retailer in Germany, buy a controller lol.
---
Oh thanks!  Wallace is the vendor in Harpers Ferry right?
---
Level 127, never seen one. 
---
The constant spamming of the bitch scream needs a nerf
---
Spawn at Charleston Station and run down the road over the red bride and in front of you there another red bridge ahead. Underneath that bride can spawn a flatwoods monster. There is also a spawn place North of V76 it can spawn sever in the wasteland
---
No, stop giving buggedthesda more money. They don't deserve it at this point.But if you still buy it anyway then please tell me where your camp is so i can send a few orbital strikes ( it contains food,chems, weapons,armor)
---
An.  It‚Äôs just the magazine.  Go to a bench and look what magazine is on it.  
---
Excavator with calibrated shocks will give you 200 additional carry weight. 
---
Get a power armor with motion assist Torso and 2x calibrated shock legs.  
---
So how is this any different from any other level combination?  I don't  understand the previous statement, and this is the problem, I've not been able to find a clear answer anywhere.
---
The normal way to get xp per kill, even in a group, is to at least tag the mob with your character to get xp and loot.  What is the penalty or restriction (if any) if you are playing with someone that is many levels above or below you.  Many online MMO's have power-leveling penalties or special mechanics.  I just want to know how it works in FO76.
---
Ok, let me re-phrase that. Its crap in the current world setting. 
---
Unless you have a super specialised Sneak/VATS build which is not everybodys thing no ranged weapon including the TSEs now are really viable against high level enemies like scorched beasts, glowing ones or the SBQ.
---
Hasnt been any different whenever I‚Äôve joined, granted I only tag along after the nukes been dropped, but if anything I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre killing her more efficiently than before. 
---
Of course you need to announce it.  If you don't announce it nobody will know how *outraged* you are and people won't think you're part of the cool in-crowd.
---
Definitely
---
153, never seen.
---
But this game has NEVER been stable...
---
Done her 3 times after patch - one time I was late because I went to camp for repairs and a small crew killed her in 2 minutes. Last time took 20 min, but zero drama. Always nuke South of drop v9 for less adds. It's quite doable - but the loot sux üòé
---
Thanks for giving us that vital piece of information.
---
While I'd be all for legendary pipe revolvers I also would think they would be too OP and that may be the reason there ain't any.
---
The perk licenced plumber maxed would make a tse/AAE variant hardly need fixing , this with the ability to fire 6 shots before reloading unlike the pipe gun that has a slow load with each bullet (which balances it's damage).
---
It also benifits from both Maxing out all gunslinger and rifleman perks coupled with bloody mess/tank killer and if explosive (lvl3) would quickly make a legendary tse/AAE pipe revolver one of the most deadly weapons in the meta.
---
Not saying I wouldn't want one tho but was just saying why they ain't a thing lol
---
You'll get lot if one party member hits it
---
No penalty so far
---
I've been running with radworms for extra carry weight, higher jumps (marsupial), even got my lock picking to 4.
---
Cool thing is some of the bonuses remain after you recover (carry weight, lock pick), but my marsupial gets nerfed.  I keep going back to WS to get re-infected :)
---
if you are running around with somebody who is a much higher level than you are you will have a harder time actually defending yourself. At least until you hit level 50 then it basically doesn't really matter.mostly because enemies scale to the level of the highest player when you're in a group outside of the "new person areas"
---
Also if you have a plan to make it why would you charge me? It's not costing you a lot besides like what a minute to craft it? 
---
Same.
---
And fun lol. 
---
I like tail too lol
---
Oh ok
---
I'm just telling you why only certain crops can be planted.  I've never seen Bethesda say officially so I can't definitively say why.
---
I can definitively say allowing players to plant crops that are comparatively rare and previously must have been scavenged for is a pretty major balance change towards making the game easier.  Adding little icons at the bottom right of the screen to show when you're talking is a quality of life improvement.
---
My char is about lvl 80, finished all the major quests, and I feel like there is no content for me in the game anymore, I really wanted to love the game but seems like Bethesda has some other plans.  
---
I did go out to farm caps,legendary weapons and stuff. But if that¬¥s all to the endgame then I have to ask "Why bother?", there is abundance of games that the endgame is usually just a grindfest, but sometimes when you are on the top something unlocks and makes the game interesting again, there is nothing like that here.  
---
I keep the game updated but now I only log in once every two weeks and get disappointed...
---
Well yep Ive seen it once with glass, probably when I was running low. Just some sync problem probably.
---
Update - I‚Äôve had a few lockups since I made the initial post but it‚Äôs rare.  I may have had 5 lockups in the last week.   That‚Äôs down from 3-5 an hour before.   It‚Äôs not perfect but I‚Äôll take it.   It‚Äôs a step in the right direction anyway.  
---
Or rather 120 .308 rounds from my shitty pipe pistol 
---
I killed it outside silo Charlie. 
---

Edit: accidentally replied to the wrong person
---
Thanks. 
---
I just want to use the skulls of the things I kill to be a decoration in my camp
---
Skyxlimit13, lvl 140, 31 years old, warning you of my age cuz if your 15 and act like it I'm immediately muting and blocking ya. If ya are mature I'll stick around
---
Digital assets literally are nothing.
---
..... I'm male.
---
indeed
---
I was wondering if the Fallout 4 version gave you rads, I can't remember, does it? Feels me that a **perfectly** **preserved** pie would give out rads...
---
What about arms and helmet?   Is there anything I can do to them to improve carry weight?  
---
What would you say a full set of excavator armor and plans for the mods would cost? 
---
I get random invites all the time. Nope. If you don' t have a mic and talk to me first I have no desire to team with you.
---
Doesn't count.
---
Agreed.  The worst part is you can‚Äôt even see them to hit them a lot of the time.  You have waste hundreds of rounds on them because half the time there‚Äôs no way hit them effectively due to their spam attack.    When they fail to land you end up wasting a lot of ammo for very little reward.   Unless you‚Äôre trying to farm ultracite there‚Äôs very little reason to engage with them.   It‚Äôs as if they were put in the game simply to be an annoyance.  
---
well.. in the vault no one should have any sort of guns.. unless you both just wanna punch each other and take the other's starting supplies
---
I've noticed this whenever I go to Whitespring hoping to find the golfer ghouls. Often I find legendaries, but they are coming from non-legendary enemies half the time. I'm wondering if the enemy is somehow mislabeled or some the loot switched between enemies. Its a weird bug whatever the case.
---
[Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw58NzHaI0g) also our group record post-nerf is 2mins.
---
The 10 round mag is the Piercing Magazine modification. Been like that since forever.
---
The answer to life, the universe and everything is in fact 42.
---
Riiiight. 
---
I raise my Nuka-bombdrop in toast to your glorious achievement.
---
Bottoms up! 
---
They are so shockingly poorly implemented its unreal. They don't have a single redeeming quality.
---
So many times I've almost posted a rant to reddit but stopped myself... 
---
Yes,  I‚Äôve joined that event 5-6 times since the last patch and haven‚Äôt had any problems.  You just have to make sure there aren‚Äôt a bunch of low level players making it more difficult.   Also, when she does land you have to open up on her.  It‚Äôs helpful if you have folks strong in melee when she lands.  
---
I usually see only the Grafton monster there
---
This made me laugh then cry because I've rarely seen such sincere truth before. It's like you're writing my exact thoughts. I'm lvl 50 and also say fuck scorchbeasts!  
---
I‚Äôve been playing since release and have yet to encounter it or the Mothman.  I‚Äôve encountered the wise mothman as part of an event but no skirmishes with the mothman or FWM at all.  
---
Pistol VATS sounds fun. Do you have a falloutbuilds link for it? 
---
Albino Radscorpions from FO3 laugh at FO76.
---
Yeah EA is a trash company with a horrible P2W history. I am gonna sit right here.
---
I have my camp over in those that you hear a woman screaming, it was creepy at first, now it's my lullaby.
---
That's cool, I'd like to try another MMO in the future because FO76 has let me see how fun it is to get engaged with one. Are there any similar games out there? I'd like to eventually try another one. I'm on ps4 I currently don't have a gaming PC
---
Found one deep south of the map (almost at the point where you can't go further), heard one while setting up camp in the middle of the map, and one during a daily quest to hunt cryptids. No fun loot.
---
Spawned at my camp once. Didn't drop anything remotely useful.
---
I watched it happen to my friend!  Weirdest thing ever. 
---
Me too, on PS4
---
PVE would be cool. I know we were told from the start that PVP is a thing in the game, but who knows things my change. 
---
PVE only might help along with the 'you must rebuild' 
---
I met one the second I existed Abbie's Bunker and once controlling some supermutants on my way down the train tracks  from Seneca Rocks to South Cutthroat camp! 
---
Definitely get a set of decent power armor.  Either escavator with shocks or X01 with shocks.   Escavavtor gives you more carry weight but X01 gives better protection.  
---
When a team take over a Workshop, everyone on the team will start PvP with the owner and both of them can kill each other.  
---
Anyway, you get a free kill only one time, if the owner respawn you can't kill him again (if you don't take the workshop another time), but whoever on your team didn't killed him already, still can.  
---
Maybe you have seen some of these guys as non hostile because they already killed you one time, and then someone who didn't, killed you from behind.  
---
That's where my camp is. He will spawn in there often whenever I fast travel sometimes. It has happened several times now 
---
Yeah I explored in my main. This is a fallout game after all.
---
I will reread books and re-watch movies and even replay games but games on rails have almost zero attraction to replay. Sure you can mix things up a bit especially as there isn't any need to follow the Overseer this time round but I've gone that way and done that mission anyway. I didn't power level in my main but it would have been handy to have a way of making a whole new end game  character without the slog. 
---
Super realism servers would be nice. 
---
Everyone outputs the same damage so it will force people to work closely together because no one will have a massive advantage over another. 
---
Random, and can happen ANYWHERE. Saw them in Glassed Caverns instead of Scorched before. Also one time I went to a Morgantown nuke and it was all eyebots
---
Good point.  The cargobot is nearly as annoying as the SB.  Even worse, you can take out the escort helis quite easily but not the friggen cargobot itself.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  
---
Even better i never thought about damage output 
---
literally have no interest in protection. Purely carry weight. Thanks for the help 
---
Pipe wrench here :)
---
I find it annoying that I get totally blinded by sonic attacks.
---
[Thirst Zapper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Thirst_Zapper); though it's in FO4 only and has no extra mechanism (except *that one* quest).
---
&gt;What about arms and helmet? Is there anything I can do to them to improve carry weight?
---
Legs and torso only can increase carry weight/strenght.
---
&gt;What would you say a full set of excavator armor and plans for the mods would cost?
---
You want to buy it all ready from a crafter. Plans are much more difficult to hunt and more expensive. Excavator itself is quest reward, but you only get plans, you'd still need to craft it. And players who craft for others, can benefit from super duper perk.
---
The excavator PA is glitched, if you login with that on, while you keep it on, it will give like 100 more carry weight than it's supposed to. Not sure if it applies to other PA as well. But only if you start it in, and only while you are inside it.
---
This is very sad.
---
Definitely go with Escavtor with shocks.  You‚Äôll have tremendous carry weight with it.  It‚Äôs +100 for the set and +100 for the shocks on the legs.  
---
People have to actually have builds instead of just TSEs
---
Yep. Only had the 2 SBs flatten my base a couple of days ago. I was lvl 40 and couldn't see the fuckers to shoot them. Plus I'm melee build and only had a 10mm gun on me. Fun times and now I see the flying, screechy wankers in my nightmares.
---
Not going to lie, I was torn between meh and slight disappointed when I heard that Fallout's answer to the dragon was a giant mutated bat. Having actually fought them. Fuck that noise. That isn't fun. 
---
Same here
---
Eso is awesome. Anthem is coming out soon
---
THOT: that hoe over there or thirsty hoe over there. Doesn't specify gender. And you clearly fit the description.
---
of course! you are absolutely right. I am totally with you.  I am not defending the quality of the game. I just tell you what I think from the perspective of a software developer. 
---
when they initially started the developement they did not question themselves which functionality they need because the game will crash all the time. this is why such a feature you are requesting was not thought of.
---
I can also tell you that i would have been fired a long time ago if I would work with the same results as fo76
---
I had this happen to me shortly after they announced a patch to cut down on the traffic at Whitesprings. I thought it was intentional lol. Luckily it was just a random glitch.
---
Buy a cheap cheap pre owned version. 
---
The canvas bags still haven't been received as advertised and a lot of people are waiting for replacement Helmets as they turned up broken etc. Of course if you can see the helmet before you purchase then that's down to you to decide if the helmet is worth 50 bucks to you. If its just the game you're really interested in, you can get it for ¬£10 pre owned in most UK game stores.
---
You can buy most of the fluff (skins etc) in game free with Atom's (MT currency) that you earn free as you progress.

---
This is what I run. I don't have a really good 3 star revolver yet but I can 1v1 a level 60 Scorchbeast without too much trouble using a black powder and a normal ts western revolver. You can switch some points out from Endurance and Strength but no perks in PER actually benefit a VATS Crit pistol build other than Concentrated Fire so I leave it low.
---
The most important thing is your crits. People will say all those crit perks are overkill but nah, you want to crit and stay in VATS as much as possible. I've one had every single shot in my 6 shot revolver fill my crit bar to max. The normal damage is mediocre but the crit spam is pretty ridiculous. 
---
Imo the best weapon for this build is a anti armour western revolver with crit damage and crit charge rate effects. And the two mutations that give you increased crit damage. Think it's hawk something and food something, not sure.
---
It's trash early and only comes online when you got all thevperks maxxed in AGI and LCK though.
---
That mission was a right pain in the ass
---
About 20 yards away from the overseer's camp in the Forest near Flatwoods (it was looking up the hill at my camp). Same session, about an hour and a half later, a couple of hundred yards south of the crashed space station, just staring at it.
---
I was thinking about getting ESO. Thanks.
---
Yeah I understand that, I just have no idea how they wouldn't implement it after seeing how unstable the game was (ever since BETA). It just boggles my mind tbh.
---
Cheers! 
---
This is most likely an overflow bug. Using 32-bit unsigned number, the maximum number you can represent is 2^32 - 1 = 4294967295. Add one and it wraps around to zero.
---
I love scout armor but how i can get the mods for them? Seems that even modus doesn't sell the plans for them
---
Basically same thing happened to me yesterday. I think in one of the recent patches they changed the AI on it because it used to be very easy to take down. Now it seems to have more health and has buggy AI that puts it out of range a lot
---
So you were in team and did not hear area voice chat, maybe he just wanted [something.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=244s)
---
Yep. I don‚Äôt really like it that much
---
My buddy and I were playing fresh chars yesterday, with full melee build, we were around level 30ish, just exploring through the mire, 2 level 80 scorchbeasts, an alpha death claw and 2 wendingos were literally dropped on our heads, so we dispatched of the ground mobs, and began taking popshots with a rifle avoiding the screeches the best we could, we actually managed to get the 1st level 80 down, between us, I guess there was enough damage output at level 30? :s
---
Then we sat there waiting for around 15 minutes for the other to land, we managed to take about a quarter from its health bar.... And it just took off? Disengaged from Combat and flew over the mountain.
---
Easily the dumbest mob in the game by a large margin.
---
Bethesda are lucky to have such a die hard fan base that will still play this game in the face of consistent problems on a daily basis.
---
Careful though, there may never be a fallout 5 going about it this way.
---
Sometimes I face this issue as well
---
I imagine if we get private servers modders will probably get something like this going.
---
Thank you very much. Think I have the info I need. Time to take my 25k caps to the market!  :) 
---
Little do you know that the future is a stony path littered with bear traps and punji boards. 
---
Nope I actually stood still at one point and he kept attacking me. 
---
I'd like more co-op in the game. Currently SBQ is the only boss you absolutely need a team to defeat. (Unless you were a duper with stacked explosive bobble heads which I think is patched now)
---
i think because this will be a sign of resignation. like "hey we accept that the game crash all the time and we spend time in developing workarounds instead of fixing the crashes" they just dont want to send this signals
---
Do they have a best place to farm them like golf outfits and straight jackets?
---
Really figured thatd be included with "wind instruments " plan. 
---
I remember when Everquest 2 had that technology and that was like 15 years ago.  FO76 is really behind the times.  Also with share banking between alts.
---
They shouldn't, but do. I remember encountering three outside the Rusty pick. This was back when I was like level 15. They of course were level 50.
---
Yeah, but how things are looking now, they will never fox these issues and it's not necessarily their fault. I think most of the problems stem from the single player engine being raped to fit an always online multiplayer game. 
---
thru scrapping ?
---
Exactly.....
---
The % is low, scrapped some pieces but got nothing
---
Yeah, it's not hard as long as you don't have a dozen lowbies hiding in the shed and 2 people doing all the work. If there's at least one proper melee there - it's trivial once she lands.
---
The fact that they are more of a nightmare to fight than the Grafton Monster is sad
---
Ye is doable.however the expenditure of ammunition and stimpaks make it absolutely unfeasable for the poop loot
---
Ew Juicehead
---
It‚Äôs not an exploit, although it can be exploited. When you take a workshop you invite pvp, You are warned. With that being said, partially claiming it to kill the owner and then repeating the process over and over again is pretty scummy.
---
Both workshop fair game , bounties fair game , destroying someones camp thats a cunty thing to do regardless of levels. I spend my time alot doing camps up for people and i depise anyone thinking its funny to ruin it for others.
---
But you have pvp servers comming so when it happens go nuts destroy everyone in your path. :)
---
Lvl 120 came across one while walking the road by Dolly Sods in the Mire I thought it was an easy fight and there was no notable loot. At least I got a cool screen shot of its corpse
---
Raider: roleplays a raider, takes over workshops to steal stuff(only way really), aggressive, drugs
---
Griefer: destroys bases with assassins sentinel gear and just wants to mess with other players.
---
encounters with raiders are tense and exciting, while encounters with griefers are filled with anger.
---
Also ass sent gear is just dishonorable, no chance of loses for one side, its just not fair
---
Disgusting click bait
---
Wait...thats a thing?
---
Servers? There are no servers. Todd wouldn't lie to us. 
---
Won't all of this with fallout 76 seriously harm the week out sales of games like TES6 etc though? This has been so widely publicised every gaming outlet has covered it. I'd actually rather have had a decent fallout 76, im a little bored of the elder scrolls rhetoric, I've been playing TES games since I was 13, a good 15 years. Fallout I joined at the fourth installment, and went back through the series, I feel there is more substance in the fallout games and far more relatable content.
---
Fallout 76 is about as relatable as a ready salted crisp.
---
Would say both :D
---
If you destroy bases without any reasons I would say griefer.
---
Steal vegetables and water from bases and workshops I would say raider.
---
But if the +100lvl guy is not friendly in his own base to you. Ok there I would say destroy it and be a raider! :D
---
... this was kind of a one time thing, as this schematic would actually be very beneficial.
---
100%
---
I am not sure how many hours I've played, I'm at about level 135, but while I have found an explosive pump shotgun I have yet to find a two-shot, much less a gun with both. 
---
His videos lately are just reading threads on here and talking about them for ten minutes, he‚Äôs even had to backtrack on some of those because more information came out a *day* later.
---
How would two shots work? What happens to their arc? 
---
If we had pve servers with absolutely no PvP, normal servers and PvP servers the normal and PvP servers would be dead lol
---
Me. 0 interest in pvp. If I wanted to play fortnite, I wouldn't have bought fallout.
---
Same xp for all players I as long as they all hit the enemy. I use this to help quickly level up low lvl players it's nice to be able to help out.
---
Tesla rifle is cool, I use it too and it works fine for all situations except when facing big enemies with high resistances.
---
100% agreed.
---
Scorchbeasts are zero fun.
---
I've started to just leave the server. There is no point in killing them.
---
To see if it‚Äôs a until now an unknown bug. The whole point of scrapper it to get rare components and the game is buggy to hell so it could be that your mutations are interfering, or it could just be the servers. I just know me and I get 1-3 screws per combat rifle, combat shotgun, assault rifle and anything fusion/gamma/plasma. I don‚Äôt run any mutations for very long. 
---
Yes but the direction they are headed has potential. 
---
I find new things to do all the time :) because I‚Äôm not boring 
---
You're right, we need more team-required content. Everything is too easy for us melee guys, and too spongy for the gun nuts
---
Exactly what a hoe would say.
---
The weightless legendary mod plus shrouded makes those pretty much zero weight in your inventory.
---
I haven't played the beta, but anthem reminded me more of monster hunter than an mmorpg. Fair statement?
---
The one thing worse than Bethesda / FO76....so called youtubers like this fool leeching off it's dying back :/
---
&gt;Also why can they still kill me when I‚Äôm inside? That is SHIT!
---
Exactly this. I guess them being annoying and hard to kill would be fine if i'd at least could hide and lose agro.
---
Yes.  They aren't the specific player taking the workshop, so the game doesn't count them as hostile.  So pacifists, who can attack that specific player, can't attack them.
---
Pacifist should straight up be 100% unkillable by other players.  Not that bullshit system it is now.
---
[I give people chance to buy their lives with food.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=244s) Otherwise i kill everybody i can. Not touching camps tho, or bully someone for long time, if i get every player i meet frustrated i would have less victims.
---
The game literally warns you that you are open to pvp for having the workshop, what did you expect
---
Yeah I think it depends on the victim really.. how they take it. Unfortunately. 
---
It might be easier if were all wearing faction outfits, and "griefers" were wearing obvious raider threads. As it stands, every mf‚Äôer who does either is charging about in full power armor or lol outfits. 
---
Except that this is my first post on here, making it impossible for me to be a horrible, as hoes/thots go to several people exclusively for benefits, while this might be the only time I do this.
---
I guess because they don't like the truth?  Here's the deal,  you couldn't really ignore dragons in Skyrim,  so it's okay to not be able to ignore these.  I dunno.  Maybe they are just grumpy.  Lol
---
[Fallout 76 raiding workshops for food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=244s)
---
Im sorry the better question is who wants pvp servers its a mission to trt and get pvp going in fallout now a days
---
My thoughts?  Well, they are mostly intangible, invasive, &amp; quite messy when used in a broken blender.
---
Don't say that, Bethesda is maybe looking for new stupid things to add to their game 
---
I see makes sense. Yeah all will change with pvp servers. 
---
Anyone quitting give me your weapons and armor first!!! 
---
The game needs the challenge.  I hope they dont nerf it.
---
I don‚Äôt think 1 is annoying at all.. they are big baddies, they should be hard to kill! 
---
from what i've seen the Tesla rifle is only "okay" on normal enemies and virtually useless for bigger, more heavily armored enemies like mirelurk queens, scorchbeasts, deathclaws, etc., and for some people like my friend who found a decent Tesla rifle, there's something wrong with the Tesla rifles' graphics or animations; whenever he tries to use it, it crashes his game. It works fine for me and many others i assume but this could be another reason why you don't see people using it very often
---
Excavator mod plans can be found at Camden Park.   Or you can server hop for loose mods (much harder to find but quicker and easier to use).
---
Mark V + fire explosive rounds. Beware the op infinite stagger!
---
For something really slow like that, which is hardly useable when enemies swarm at you, I would take highest penetration.
---
Penetration and crits seem to be a lot better than in F4 where raw damage was king.
---
For semi-auto I might take the mid way improved penentration and with reload or magazine boost. Or highest penetration. Also related for receives, I typically take the receiver that improves damage and crits. Only for fairly weak or pure long range sniping guns I would take hardened. 
---
in my opinion raiders take over already owned workshops, hunt bounties, do pvp with workshop owners and other stealing and pvp that doesnt abuse game mechanics or glitches. griefers are those who get TSEs and assassin‚Äôs sentinel‚Äôs armor just for one shotting any player they come across whether or not they want pvp, destroying bases for no actual reason and just doing that kinda stuff to frustrate other players
---
By unique loot and shoot structure, you mean like borderlands but far more tedious and boring right?
---
Well i agree partly. If my workshop that I build (fusiongenerator turrets etc.) and farmed for 2 or 3 hours gets taken away I think I would be angry... Well yeah gear is a big point right now. Well I am playing unarmed nonpa against PA users 150lvls below me and still loose. Shit like that makes me rethink every interaction in pvp... 
---
It connects you to a server and then starts loading in the assets associated with your character (you can watch your own base spawn if you hadn't noticed), if they had to jump server a few times for you, then the load times would be much worse than they already are...
---
I dont mind the screams but the lack of vision and camera shaking make me dizzy sometimes
---
It seems the scout armor and enclave plasma are intended to be used like the X-01 PA : no plan, buy your mods.
---
You literally have to program weapons to have a different effect on players than on monsters to have pve and pvp work right. 
---
Taking somebody like juicedick seriously, lmao
---
Rather it take a minute to load then spawn in getting attacked by invisible enemies. 
---
They are hard to kill only insofar as they are difficult to hit because of the spam attack.   They don‚Äôt really pose much of a threat at all to a high level player in terms of their damage.  They are essentially a flying tank that spam low end attacks that are more defensive than anything.   The level of annoyance just isn‚Äôt worth the time and ammo it takes to kill them IMO.   If they dropped something decent it would be worth it, but generally they don;t.  Just my option of course.  
---
That's my Point some eyes you would be a griever (with extra steps) I'm trying to figure out where people think: OK I got killed by a raider or OK I got killed by a griefer.... 
---
There‚Äôs one down the road from vault 76 in a small structure, handmade sniper tower of sorts. Thought you might want a free fast travel point.
---
raider engages pvp for potential loot and caps. Most raiders avoid getting wanted, so the map doesn't deactivate. Mostly targeting factories and wanted players. Raiders have no limitation to who is wanted and who has the factory. 
---
Griefer engages pvp to piss off players and break their houses. They usually move in full teams, to make sure they don't get out numbered, and so they could remove bounties from bulldozing bases. Their main focus are high levels that are in an unknown locations of the map, most likely their own base, or in heavy loaded places.
---
A raider can become a griefer, but it costs caps to blow bases up, which goes against the purpose of raiding. 
---
Cazadors were the worst. Would burn through you very quickly and were impossible to hit. Probably the worst enemy designed in the game series. Scorchbeast is probably a close second.
---
Yeah it makes more sense.  Just like how Anthem is doing it.
---
Then, after a year or so, come out with some PVP mode on the side like Destiny. Or handle it like The Division, make a certain area of the map open PVP at all times with high level enemies and high level rewards.
---
Trying to cram PVP into the open world is an unbalanced disaster.
---
Because no one wants it. Most players would rather co-op play
---
Do Queen of the Hunt, high chance of appearing
---
Well modded leather can actually be pretty good, particularly with its high energy resistance, it just needs some investment in upgrades. At one point I had a bunch of legendary upgraded leather armor with effects like vanguard and unyielding and energy damage barely registered. It was nice in some situations that had lots of robots.
---
I think wood makes decent backup armor to carry around since it is so lightweight, and the shrouded mod makes it much lighter and improves stealth. Legendary wood with weightless and shrouded practically weighs nothing (registers with a weight of "0.00") for me. I do have the armor weight reduction perk also though. 
---
I found it odd they decided to add another mode which is the same almost as the old mode.  Then claimed it was ‚Äú what people wanted ‚Äú. I‚Äôve never seen anyone ask for that. 
---
Cuz we already had that. I have seen tons of people ask for PvE. 
---
Found it in every region so far, there is no fixed spawn location, same goes for the Mothman.
---
Killed probably about 20+ of them, the loot is always disappointing.
---
Honestly, I feel it would be better if it was open pvp, 24/7.
---
I‚Äôd love that. Especially private servers with mod ability. I‚Äôd love to have a stable, private server where captured workshops stay captured, camps stay put and I could turn off defend the workshop / daily missions. 
---
Basically, I‚Äôd love to have this game as a single player experience, but with select friends, which means co-op. 
---
I‚Äôd pay serious money for that. Co-op in the fallout universe is the best. This implementation is just underwhelming atm. 
---
It does, but your base loads after that, I always watch my base spawn in and can get stuck in the structure if I move into that area before it has...
---
I‚Äôm back on RDR2 as well. Playing that game reminds you of how embarrassingly bad Fallout 76 is. It‚Äôs amazing how large the gap is between those two developers. 
---
you are right. i think it will never be a 100% stable game and it will never be a balanced game. but they are not at this point. maybe some of the developers know but they usually dont make the decisions. 
---
Then we already have that no? What it seems to me you want is a group finder system 
---
Yeah, it really does suck. 
---
You monster lmao
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry
---
Sounds like you should move your camp, or decide to put up with it.
---
It seems like they mostly follow the same path in my experience. I usually only bring it out in nuke zones, and generally the server goes to crap and it‚Äôs hard to see. 
---
He probably wanted to give you loot.
---
Absolutely 
---
Just imagine all the throwing knives you could make though...
---
I'm not very good at playing video games, so I buy them for my family to play and for me to watch. I bought 76 out of a passion for Fallout. Unfortunately, the first time my husband played, shotgun shots followed us for hours. My son tried and he had this issue where his power armor made a ghost replica, leaving dozens of suspended armors everywhere and suspended radroaches. I was going to end up having to try for myself and found out about the game breaking inventory bug. I was waiting until the bugs were worked out, because I have anxiety about people trolling me online. Unfortunately, I'd planned to revisit the game even though I'd be a terrible player, and we were burglarized by drug addicts last week on Tuesday. I still have my games, but having that happen kind of zaps your willingness to do stuff for a while. 
---
There are albino radscorpions in 76
---
Once you learn the shrouded wood armor mod wood is an easy way to get armor that improves your stealth ability. Shrouded also greatly reduces the wood armor's carry weight, which is already low.
---
Wood isn't the best all-round armor, but modded legendary wood can be good for stealth-focus builds and those who want minimal weight. 
---
I am never gonna spend money on such casual game with such meaningless content. Especially when premium currency is easily obtainable. 
---
[Check this bethesda forum post.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/320739/abusive-players?language%5B%5D=en) I didn't have power to read it :D
---
Awesome! Just added you, IGN IronHandsX
---
Discord IronHandsX #0795
---
What would you like as payment?
---
I chased one across from wes tek to Watoga for it to do this 
---
What did he do for content before this game came out?
---
It sounds fun silenced and it‚Äôs ridiculously long. 
---
Then the player number dropped to 30 
---
That's a good excuse for stop support for this game
---
I liked MMO's back in the days when they were good and not cash shop oriented. Ultima and D2 LoD, the good old days.
---
But yes, I play fallout for a solo pve experience. To immerse myself into the world and lore. Not to play with a ton of restless dickbags that want to ruin my fun and enjoyment for their own.
---
You guys need to go farm weapons in Borderlands 2 and then come back and complain about drop rates. 
---
My understanding is the server you were in might not exist if it crashed. 
---
Low level, so can't move far from the vault 
---
Nice, anal probes all round?
---
Can confirm.
---
This along makes me think  that current programmers are college students
---
&gt; entitlement
---
Asking for a game mechanic to work is entitlement?
---
I tried to get it to rhyme but it‚Äôs an uneven cadence and even the very word Scorchbeast sucks balls.
---
S is for bullet sponge, HP that never ends 
---
C is for cry, mourning the ammo that he rends. 
---
O is for omg, the last thing you‚Äôll surely scream
---
R is for running, the only action that you‚Äôll see.
---
C is for CAMP, your home they always seem to find
---
H is for hate, your rage will turn you blind (oh wait no that‚Äôs a sonic doughnut)
---
B is for bombardment and all the echoes that you‚Äôll see
---
E is for Easy, the one thing this fight will never be 
---
A is for the apathy...
---
you‚Äôve died once more, you‚Äôll never win.. 
---
S is for sever hop, your salvation and your sin 
---
Because, in the end... 
---
T is for the tyranny that you always know... they will spawn again 
---
How Do you switch lights off in your camp?
---
I leave everything unlocked, in my bunker yet I haven‚Äôt receive a single visitor to date. ‚òπÔ∏è I think they get scared away by the very moody Scorchbeast that circle the property to the point it almost glitches into the walls. For whatever reason it won‚Äôt give up trying to destroy my furniture despite having no way to get to it. 
---
As annoying as it is, it does a brilliant job of getting rid of pests that could figure out how to use a door and get inside, ü§î So there‚Äôs silver lining to every cloud. 
---
Yeah I haven't played in about a week or so and dont plan on going back. Smash Bros, Apex Legends, and Anthem coming soon? Fallout76 is dead for me 
---
Me too. It's changed a lot since I was in school. Going back in a month for the NCAA Rifle National Championship! Can't wait!
---
Happened to me and some other dude at Berkeley workshop. I can deal with Scorched and molerats, but two fucking scorchbeasts?! Does the the think one for each of us? Suffice to say, even without a mix to properly communicate, we both knew the bail.
---
They do not have a roadmap and anyone that calls it that is the perfect client to market microtransactions to.
---
Hemlock workshop always has one in my experience
---
Cranberry bog, by Sugar Grove, next to Watoga train station, on Whitesprings golf course (past the entrance to the buker at the first gate tou come to) https://youtu.be/yJpXGnJbSD0
---
That's a pretty huge indication that we need pure PVE servers.
---
&lt;muffled groaning&gt;
---
Also rad rats and giant ants are also entirely too tanky wtf. 
---
I read somewhere that this is exactly what happened. Given that my lore is right and the gourmands were the cannibal raider group.

the vendor behind the bus in downtown Grafton sells all the mods for Excavator 
---
I know right? 
---
If you wreck a CAMP with unlocked resources I'd say that's griefing. If you have ever tried to follow quarry to another server, that's griefing for sure (and please, seek professional help). 
---
Taking workshops is just part of the game. Says so right in the menu system.
---
well.    
---
Roadmap of what will come ... it's not that I'm a fan of apex, but it makes me angry that a game that just comes out and for free, has no problems, bugs, nothing weird 
---
I think you forgot ‚Äúwon‚Äôt run for more than X amount of time without a disconnect.‚Äù 
---
Every kill ive had took less than 3m post nerf. Killed her 4 times and not once did she land. Just floated in air taunting the melee clucks while the ‚ÄúYOU CANT EVEN USE GUNS ANYMORE‚Äù team shreded her.
---
Alot of people post stuff like this and then if you defend the game you are the one at fault which doesn't make sense because if they weren't here bashing it nobody would have to defend it. But if you enjoy the game you are the problem apparently. 
---
Should of specified, I don't want to change my build or perks just for nuke zones, got it set up so that im an efficient killer who doesnt have to worry about qol stuff. Thanks anyway though mate
---
I rather have PvP servers and PvE servers
---
 There's a Junk Pile under the monorail west of the Elevator (up the cliff). I've found if you build your base there with a few turrets the 'bots will fly over on their route and they're fairly easy pickings. 
---
Reported. 
---
Oh boy Juicehead, He pumps out videos as fast as he can with inaccurate infomation then retracts his statements in another video the next day. 
---
Morals are hard to come buy these days.
---
Devs will be looking into that
---
I got some shit for ya if I can ever get my game to log on successfully again. I haven‚Äôt played in a month and you were always good to me on the trade pages. 
---
More like destiny 
---
If you're wrecking camps unarmed, let me express the strangest kind of admiration for you, wanderer.  Future tales will be told of Bruised Knuckles, that legendary puncher of crafting tables...
---
Lol it took you 1500 caps to realize you couldn't win,but could simply change server.
---
Much appreciated my fine friend let me know if ya can log on successfully lol im in rush....shame to see ya leave pizzaball 
---
Lol I once fast traveled to the whitesprings bunker- hill side entrance (no nuke zones on server) and was greeted by a ton or ghouls... that was fine... til out of nowhere not one, not two, but THREE fuckin scorchbeasts went after me.. needless to say I fucking died 10+ times since I decided not to give up. There was not a single fucking player in white springs for like five plus mins.. then I spotted one poor guy who fast traveled to the area and I lured the scorchbeasts towards him and we beat them and like 30 ghouls and three damn radscorpions that burrowed out of the golf course.. BEST FIGHT EVER.. also I never sweat so much in my life
---
I also use friends and it was a good question, upvoted. 
---
Honestly if they just made Pacifist mode (with a cool down on toggle to prevent abuse) make you truely opt-out of PVP, including capturing workshops, damaging/looting owned objects, etc. Then we would have exactly what the CO-OP only PVE wanting crowd wants.
---
This whole "You can never *truly* opt out of PVP" model they went with is baffling. 
---
[](/starlightisee)
---
I can't be bothered with them, I just run away screaming like a little girl lol üòÇ 
---
1. No rejoin last server with all workshops still under control.
---
2. No rejoin last server with all workshops still under control.

7. No rejoin last server with all workshops still under control.

I agree
---
Exactly. I never get harassed,ever. Nobody grief my base,nobody exploit workshops on me.nothing.
---
People are just scared,or morons that place their camp at whitespring club house.
---
Hmm that has potential to be good. 
---
It rolls every time you activate it. You can see it in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/anuaas/preserved_pie_when_you_lease_expect_it/). You can tell when it will fail the moment one of the claw fingers fails to go beneath the plate. 
---
I just go around and when I spot one I activate it and move one the second I see the 'tell' it's not gonna work. No use standing there waiting for the whole animation.
---
Who wants a good game? Xd xd lololol
---
Every box is just a copy paste saying every X months they will have a season and it will include things. Not really a roadmap, or a highly superficial one at best.
---
Amazing for tagging enemies. Great at killing ghouls, scorched, and mole miners. Not so great vs. Gutsys or Super Mutants. Don't even bother shooting a scorchbeast with it. 
---
Haven't actually shot a mirelurk with it. 
---
I thought about this a lot after I built a vendor camp by Whitespring station. On the second floor, there is a deck with fire pit, and couches to watch the nukes drop from a safe distance (hopefully). I wouldn't even mind being able to sit across a table from another player, and initiate a trade
---
Zero intrest in any form of Fallout 76 PVP. I know some like it but i truly dislike it. Got games i will play for my pvp. I would love co-op vault dweller servers.
---
I highly doubt it
---
At least it is something 
---
Bravo Sir! The legend of the Scorchbeast shall surely be passed on in song.
---
Lvl 9000 here he comes!!!
---
Sadly, yes.
---
it was never an issue to kill her. 
---
Just not kill her in under 5min like you used too :)
---
Ok so once me and my friend were pulling an all nighter playing fo76 and we were at Pricketts Fort and all of a sudden like 20 radscorps popped up and started attacking. We managed to get up top on the fort lookout towers and after a few minutes we realized how funny this glitch was, but getting down wasn't so funny (I died twice).
---
lol Beth....
---
Then level up a bit or pick a less popular location. 
---
I'd honestly prefer a server without hunger, thirst, and ammo/misc weight. Pretty much a server that gives me Fallout 4 non survival mode rules. 
---
I just want to play fallout with my friends. The tedium that comes along with it for a "survival" game is not what I'm looking for. I'd either want it gone **or** them to really embrace it and make this a true survival game. Thirst, hunger, carry weight they're all just annoyances currently if you want to do survival, fine **do it** but do it 100%. Right now I just find myself logging on and then logging off not too long after because I'm just bored with the annoyances "survival" that constantly pop up. 
---
It's a clean version. Just like the clean generators and purifiers.
---
:(
---
Jepp u do :D but its not your fault, the game didnt tell it us!
---
If u have a level up, choose the stat u want and if u have to select a perk: read the men√º bar down below ;) u can switch them between the stats/1-5 Stars/new one and so on.
---
Hope i could help u :)
---
Imma have to get me some of those perks. Still won't make them any easier to see through the constant, camera-shaking wall of green shrieks, or less bullet-spongey, but at least I won't /also/ have to waste piles of healing stuff on them as well.
---
Loose mods, or mod plans?  Cause Camden Park sells every mod plan for the excavator too.  But Mods themselves are cheaper and don't cost materials to craft.  And for most users they only need to mod their own power armor, and it's nice to not need rare materials like Flux to do the mods.
---
But loose mods are still random, not like the plans which are always there.
---
&gt;  **for $6!?** 
---
Well then give me 80$ for those atoms i got free by playing.
---
This clown outfit is clean, one in game is dirty. Need more explaining?
---
i must admit that i have bought a few items that you more or less have in the game, but i have done that to  stop myself from mass selling it by accident to vendors, lol
---
It should have been like far cry 5, you can play singleplayer and/or with a friend
---
I never hack.
---
But if you want to, just swap them in as needed, then out again.
---
Agree it is a failed design.
---
Don‚Äôt expect any changes soon.  It is working as designed, which we cannot say about so many other probs....
---
I have a ghoul killer one and tried it at whitespring. Let's just say it would have been better if i just threw it at them.
---
Everyone I have met whilst playing this game, I hate the pvp element, just not having to worry about shooting other people. 
---
I'm in pacifist mode but I still shoot people without realising they are players whilst in the heat of battle. It happened to me the other day someone came to help me defend my workshop I shoot them a couple of times before I realised they weren't scorched. I'm lucky they didn't retaliate.    
---
Given you can already rejoin a server if you happened to friend someone on it, this isn't a good reason to remove the option altogether.
---
Or just don't claim a workshop which even the game advertises as a PvP hotspot.
---
Would this be a Radshower Thoughts?
---
And even better with AI you can interact with, a decent story and offline single player. 
---
It's the same reason that energy weapons don't work: No QA
---
QA Nobody ever tried to play through this game without dev tools before release. "but it needs to be stable
---
If it's from the atom shop you won't be able to trade the VTU jacket
---
True, and sadly, swapping never occurred to me.
---
I hate them I‚Äôm a level 77 and run with my gauss doing 300 damage or lever action doing 155 damage and they still make this 21 year old male squeal like a 4 year old girl when I see them. And it‚Äôs never a normal RS it‚Äôs a really high level one that can kill me even in power armor very easy 
---
Great weapon for crowd control.
---
I experienced this also with 2 level 100+ guys, following me from event to event and just pounding on me constantly wanting a fight.  I had to be really careful with VATS because I didn't want to engage them.  I kept emoting the thumbs down, but they were relentless.  I found it funny though, and ultimately I won because they logged off (or maybe got disconnected) first :D
---
Best mod for Alien Blaster is to sell it and not having it take up weight in your inventory.
---
This isn't a good excuse. I straight up ran out of the vault straight for the westtek building (decently high level) and put my base there at lvl 6. 
---
Try sneaking around, it shouldn't be this hard. 
---
Loot bags disappearing or falling into bushes. Don't come between me and my plastic...
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
The same Atoms I got for free just through playing too? Be more condescending?
---
I tried getting back into ESO and was meh. I've been shuffling back and forth between Neverwinter and Battlefield 5 with a short break to lose a weekend in the Anthem demo.
---
One of the first things that crossed my mind playing the Anthem demo was how it was a demo and it had random world events while Fallout didn't :/
---
I put Fo76 away for a while. I'll pull it out this summer and see what changed.
---
Its not the atom item lol in game item..
---
Been thinking... why would a raider hunt a bounty? Isn't a bounty hunter kind of a lawful role? A raider would encourage bounties, and assist the person with a bounty escaping justice.
---
I found it south of the Mothman Museum, up in the woods as I was running along the road.  I just happening to target it whilst randomly pressing VATs.  I shot it once from afar and it disappeared in a blur of purple mystery.
---
Forest is a huge place.  Plenty of spots people rarely use.
---
Where are you, the junk pile on the river west of the Meadows workshop?  By the river at the overseer's first camp?
---
I don't go near the damn munitions factory anymore because it ALWAYS throws me 3 SBs to defend against. I actually come out of it with a net ammo loss in the end. Completely pointless.
---
Meanwhile some of us can‚Äôt get the game to run for more than 3 mins without a blue screen so we‚Äôre legitimately upset. Have fun with your working copy, but many, many, many of us are not that lucky. 
---
Maybe it depends on the build you've made, but with my character, which is essentially a sniper build, i'm basically the nuclear keycard gatherer for my teammates
---
There was already an official answer that "private servers" will be servers hosted on Bethesda cloud with mods from Creation Club. This means that their stability will also depend on Bethesda, and there will only be approved mods.
---

---
I guess they never miss huh
---
Fallout 76 wasnt even the worst release from last year, people just needed something to hate on.
---
They probably don't know how.  
---
If they knew how, then we would also be able to load directly into a world that has our CAMP spot free, rather than relying on RNG.
---
Ooh, tropical suits... 
---
Please fix the scorch beasts derpthesda you are your only hope
---
Enforcer perk, shotgun and VATS.

Job done.

never punched anyone, even if I wanted something, or wanted to give something and them watching it. :x
---
FFXIV has a free trial you can test out up to level 35, and lets you play as (almost) any class. If you've got Twitch Prime, the base game is free and has 30 days of game time included.
---
just lol :D
---
Or when your own turrets go rogue and attack you in the middle of a fight while you're trying to defend yourself. That's super fun and has happened more than once.
---
They are broken. When I'm stealthed they still know exactly where I am even if I'm 100 feet away. 
---
Yeah i know, i only have it to collect it, i never used it haha
---
Hell no. Dungeon Finder murdered the friends list and general civility of WoW. 
---
It was singlehandedly the most awful addition to WoW, and the beginning of the end. 
---
What we need if we want to go the MMO route is servers with thousands of players, not 24, AND a damn reason to group up. 
---
The answer to what the worst book ever written is is in fact Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
---
It's still pretty much doable. the real issue is the bunch of lvl 10s joining an event they can't do shit about, while it buffs the SBQ.
---
Of course I do. That makes it even more odd. Make a request to any manufacturer to produce 1000 canvas bags. It does not take 3 months. I would hire another company I they asked for 3 months to deliver such request. 
---
Unless they're manufacturing them at Taiwan, which would make it even more hilarious.
---
Yeah, fullscreen 1080p
---
Free bullets :D
---
I'd like more stuff for co-op play. 
---
Well blame bethesda for not having dedicated pvp servers when they clearly advertised the game as pvp friendly, but instead had all these baby gates up to bar us from pvping. Its their fault not pvpers
---
So I am working through the enclave quest now and just got to the part at Whitesprings where I need to do tasks to be promoted and ofcourse part of that is taking out scorchbeasts, which I am all to happy to do now! As soon as I leave the bay door there are 3 waiting for me!  A lvl 80, a 65 and a 50 for little ole Lvl 52 me, how nice Bethesda....
---
Indeed, our crew still kills her regularly. We killed her 4 times on Tues night, fastest was within 15 seconds of her landing, slowest was a 7 minute fight. Melee builds for DPS on the Queen, supported by a Cryolator to freeze her making her stay on the ground longer to finish her off. With high STR and a good bloodied weapon, with mutations (twisted muscles and adrenal reaction) you can also stack nuka dark with cola nut and party boy, then pop psychobuff  to get to around 2-3k damage. Then you go ham on her and she's toast. We've killer her with 3 players in 2 minutes this way. The more players who show up, the slower it goes with her DR scaling to the number of players at the event.
---
I put 3-4 layers of concrete blocks around the workshop so that I‚Äôll notice that someone is trying to claim it and ward them off before they‚Äôve gotten halfway theough. 
---
This, combined by heavy missile turret support is golden.
---
What‚Äôs the point of PVP if the player with the biggest dupped Stick will always win. 
---
Same happened to me :(
---
The Mr hasn't gotten his either, we were just talking about this yesterday. 
---
I bought this outfit, and I have the regular one in my inventory. If you're on PS4 you can add me to check it out. 
---
It's so much better, it's worth it just for the shiny shoes. The shoes on the regular one are just brown with blood, dirt and mud.
---
But also almost all outfits are in the game, these are just clean versions. I dunno why there's so many posts about the clown outfit lol
---
Yep you can strip PVP from the game, Im cool with that, most of it is from asshats anyway who have nothing better to do than just mess with others game because they are bored. Seen it, been there and hated it in so many other games already....
---
It's been like this since Day 1. You can even do this to people under level 5
---
That's a shame. It's such a cool gun. 
---
You need the shotgun charging barrel mod if you really want it to deal damage, and it's affected by rifle perk cards. I find it's usually best to round everyone up and then blast the whole horde at once so I don't waste arcs. Jumping on the roof, the bus, or over the fence lets you attack from safety (so you can get the bonus damage proc from Adrenal Reaction if you're usually running a Bloodied build).
---
Damage on a single ghoul isn't all that impressive, but damage on 10+ ghouls is incredibly efficient. 
---
I agree with number one whole heatedly. I avoid certain areas of the game because the "lag beast" will be there. I am a high lvl player and have the capability of taking one out, but like was said, it's not worth the time.
---
1: it lags your game in areas like cranberry bog where you have many enemies in the area and a scorch beast or 3 may be attacking you or another faction. 
---
2: you may get booted/glitch out while being attacked or attacking which is another downside of engaging in the first place.
---
3: nothing notable on corpses, and the best thing you can get would be the ability to make scorch beast stew, but that would mean killing at least two, unless you roll nice on butchers bounty from one.
---
4: it's landing is another problem it has. You must be in an area that it is almost programmed to be able to land. On hills, densely populated Sprite areas, and workshops, just be ready to see a landing for about 12 -22 seconds every 2-3 minutes if your lucky. In some cases I've had the lag beast not land for well over 5 min. Them landing on the ground is as difficulty as placing a camp object that has an odd shape. Maybe this is why they don't land as often.
---
5: takes away too much for too little, you will break armor unless in power armor, which if hit long enough, will break power armor too. Ammo, rad aways, stimpaks, and lots of  junk through repairing. 
---
May be somewhat repetitive of what ya said, but I'm trying to bolster my faith back in fo76, but alas, I haven't played it in a couple of weeks or longer and since the patch nerfed heavy weapons, and that heavy auto grenade launcher weight cannot be reduced, I've felt that it's DEFINITELY not worth time fighting a scorch beast or even playing, there is basically nothing to do with doing. It was grindy, but now it's beyond that.
---
I have actually been playing a mobile game in lieu of fo76 and it is better... Never thought I'd say a mobile game would be more fun than one on console.
---
I think after testing Survival Bethesda should pull out the current PvP model entirely and make Adventure mode entirely carebear.
---
Are you on XBox?  I have Heavy Combat Arms plan if you need it.
---
Known issue, it is how the mods are labeled.
---
Read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad7fxu/enclavescout_armor_all_you_need_to_know_about_it/
---
Carry weight fluctuates due to radworms bug. Do you have radworms disease when it's happening? I get that too. 
---
1) It's a clean version
---
2) This has been there since BETA and you are just now deciding to bitch about it 3 months later? must be a slow day for karma whoring...
---
Factory new!
---
Yes. I think after testing Survival mode Bethesda should pull out the current PvP model entirely and make Adventure mode entirely carebear.
---
the problem with fallout 76 is that they only focused on releasing patches and fixes and nerfs etc they didnt add any thing new thats why i quit playing at around rank 155-159
---
No kidding.  The ants are horrible. 
---
Yea it was really annoying at first then it turned into a Benny hill (awesome British comedy) funny skit. 
---
PvP in this game is a disaster. Why did they have to ruin the game with this.
---
Dont forget sulphur water from whitesprings... -disease
---
I can't take this subreddit serious anymore lol
---
Dev teams a joke.  Marketing is a joke.  Finally, customer service is a joke.  
---
This game is a Trainwreck from start to finish.
---
Damn people are so spoiled, go play any other online multiplayer game which functions similarly and you'll see that this is normal xD 
---
You have a chance to get something, you're not guaranteed loot, pretty simple concept xD
---
GAme would have been better with 1 more year development.  Game would have been better with a focus pve or PvP not this were kind of doing it all poorly.
---
I can't tell you how many times I've been taking damage or had no AP because I was thirsty or hungry. I do miss not having to worry about survival. And ammo weights suck I drop every ammo type I do not use which sucks because I just got a kickass 3* AA gauss rifle from a drop now I have to find and craft ammo.
---
Yes, 100%. PvP ruined the game. Nerfs and buffs because of a stupid feature thats like 3% of players use. It was obvious since the beggining, fallout players are NOT typical first person shooter players.
---
Rebuff our guns and put a separated server for wanna be pvpers without legendary affixes. Otherwise we will keep this trend of buffing/nerfing every single patch.
---
I'm level 70 and took her down with a crew of randoms yesterday. In the past, I had read that it helps if you cripple her wings, because it forces her to land more - I have tormentor with a lever action rifle, so I mostly did that, switching to All Rise melee when she landed. I think there were 5 or 6 of us at appropriate levels, with another 5 or 6 that were probably too low level to help, so it took around 15 minutes. 
---
Game would have been better with 1 more year development.  Game would have been better with a focus.  PvE or PvP not this we're kind of doing it all poorly.
---
What. I cleared it yesterday at level 28. Didn't die once, the mirelurk King took a few bullets but nothing crazy...
---
The Tesla is AMAZING I love the shotgun tesla for close quarters.
---
There's only one mod for each slot on the Alien Blaster, so it's pretty easy to get them all just by picking up 10 or so and scrapping them (plus getting the fusion cell mod plans from the Black Mountain dome). But if you're on PS4 I can mod it, I have them all.
---
But they got killed once so obviously PvP is ruining this game.
---
ESO is an amazing game and on sale on steam right now. It is by far my favorite MMO and I have been played in EQ1 and AC1.
---
My favorite part is that I can group up with people of any level or just play any of the questlines solo.
---
$6? Huh? Atom is free 
---
Pretty sure I didn't pay any money for the 2000 atom I currently have 
---
Lol people thinking this stuff cost money when you can unlock everything for free 
---
Yup I sure do his name is The Music Man. üé∂ ..most prolific serial killer in the Wasteland..with 64 confirmed kills..stalk and use a trap base..if your doing a strangers kinda char use the sack hood with the vestments would look awesome
---
What system you on?
---
OP what's all y'alls builds?
---
I would like PvE only servers. Coop is the reason I play this game.
---
Apex is such a polished game.  So refreshing to see.  It has definitely taken my interest over 76, which has left me feeling scammed.
---
The loot drops all have the percentages labelled, so you know chances.  They have a road map, proper dev communication.  I have bought the starter pack to show support.  It's really good to see a dev release something that's solid from day 1 and not rely on promises.
---
Are these the guiding stones? There's a investigators terminal in a cabin who's trying the solve the mysteries of Appalachia and the guiding stones were one of them and I was unsure what it was referring to. one image shows the face had some sort of speaker and possible hidden long range radio attenea built into the face. Maybe they are surveillance devices and some able to communicate led people to believe it's some kind of omnipotent being?
---
Argh VATS is a blessing and a curse. For some reason I keep targeting the targets legs and wasting ammo. 
---
tesla rifles are already highliy lethal in fact they crash my game if i use one to much it mostliy happens at white springs its also op with the adrenal perk which increases damage with more kills you get but only last for 30 seconds but gets refreshed every time you get a kill
---
ugh,  I might have watched if you hadn't said juice head,  ughhhh 
---
1. This is the first time I've seen the suit on the store, hence the reaction. 
---
2. I don't care about karma (look how my valid comments are being downvoted, I'd remove them if that was the case)
---
3. This is without a doubt the most toxic sub related to the franchise, hands down
---
I went to a pretty heavily fortified camp by Whitespring station and most of the turrets were busted up so I repaired them just in time for some lvl 68 super mutants to show up and it was a turkey shoot.  Then repaired some more what had been damaged and bailed.  The owner was nowhere to be found.  
---
Alright sure, pacifists are now completely disconnected from pvp, they don‚Äôt deal/receive damage to/from players. However they now cannot defend workshops in any capacity as their right to defend has been forfeit in an effort to be pacifist.
---
That's because they released the game in a polished state and don't need to do a 76 and backtrack with patches just to get the game to work.
---
Yup. Just like you can sorry by weight? You can sort by spoil. It puts anything that can spoil at the bottom. Doesn‚Äôt help for purified water, but you can just hotkey that. It also helps to know which food you should eat first to avoid having stuff spoil.
---
The heavy handed TSE nerf that drove away many regular players. 
---
Approved mods. Aka Family Friendly mods that we dont have paid content plans for. Gross. Pass.
---
Apex is a battle royale game.  Fallout 76 is a survival game. 
---
Thing is - both Anthem and Destiny are built on FPS foundations.  Fallout 76 is built on a single player RPG engine...  it will never be balanced for PvP.  RPGs are focused on builds and gear, FPS adds variety by abilities and guns (and FPS guns are balanced based on more damage, slower firing, less ammo, more recoil, etc).
---
FO76 should have always been coop PvE only, given its RPG roots.
---
There is an inside the vault coming today.  But expect it to be lackluster or contain lots of filler.
---
Lol carebear I like it I'll upvote you just for that. But that's not really what I was trying to get at. I'm more interested in PVE because you'd have way more co-op play. We currently just have the SBQ which requires co-op and while I haven't had many problems with griefers I've seen some people who have. 
---
&gt; This is without a doubt the most toxic sub related to the franchise, hands down
---
Not gonna argue there, look at all the constant pissing and moaning.
---
All I‚Äôve ever wanted since like Skyrim and Fallout 4 was a 4 man coop version of them. Instead we got an MMO and whatever this game is
---
SSShhhh...  , keep quiet, or else Illuminati will fix it :D
---
Why pistols as opposed to rifles? Just personal preference?
---
It seems like a lot of effort to steal my junk.  I assume the risk when i take a workshop though and try to make frequent stash trips.
---
I had one guy start turning off all the lights in my CAMP once and I asked him to stop, but he kept running around turning them off. I was like, ‚Äúshit I don‚Äôt want to have to turn all these back on.‚Äù So I disconnected and found another world. 
---
That‚Äôs my griefer experience. 
---
I have burnt through 30 cores since the last couple of patches.. at least I have weight savings! I don't I know if it's a bug, or if it's intended after the auto refilling cores were patched.
---
Maybe they can scale events somehow so that they are more challenging to a group? I only enjoy doing Events if there are other people around helping.
---
Everyone everywhere thinks it would have been a better game if it was an offline single player game with a story and characters, like the fallout games people actually like. 
---
Clearly that‚Äôs too difficult.
---
Hmm... we should have a Serum for RadWorms, lol
---
It's the equivalent value, Atoms (optionally) cost real money. Yeah we can unlock them through challenges, I just think it's crazy how they're offering an outfit already in game for 'currency.' Although I didn't realise it was a clean version when I made the post, admittedly. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be as upset by it,if every single fusion generator I‚Äôve came across since the update wasn‚Äôt empty.i haven‚Äôt actually FOUND a fusion core in the world in a month only off enemies 
---
It‚Äôs like that movie, cloud atlas.. they‚Äôre all connected.
---
I wish blocking them made it impossible for them to see you. I died to someone swinging All Rise at the speed you'd normally see a dagger swung (Fast) because of the WONDERFUL radworms bug. I died a few times before I realised it was pointless and instead of picking revenge I chose ignore. Imagine my surprise when they followed me around for easily 5 - 10 minutes swinging at me, hitting me with slap damage and using a tesla rifle to reduce my damage. I didn't swing at them but I don't understand how they were following me around after I blocked and also blocked for session.
---
Got it.   Thanks.  
---
I would like showers that boost charisma and floor gas traps.
---
I‚Äôd much rather co-play then pvp. I‚Äôve found (personally anyhow) that since people have started getting tiered or bored with the game play, I‚Äôve been getting just randomly attacked or my camp gets ransacked by other players.... possibly just looking for something to do? 
---
I've never known the love of a fine woman. Also, I've never eaten a corpse (the two are not connected btw)
---
This happened to me the other day. They would also move away at the same pace as me and would stop if I stopped. Just couldn't shoot at them to make them agro.
---
That's kind of what I'd be looking for in my next mmo purchase. Can be easily played solo or on a team. I do like playing solo and who wants to fast travel around a map while someones doing thier cap run. I miss out on a lot of team play in FO76 because most nights I only have time to run around selling stuff.
---
I didn't realise this was the case, looked the same to me! Appreciate you not being up your ass about it, haha
---
I found mine in savage divide..
---
I think if you find flatwoods lore, the tales of wv it will prompt him
---
I've played less than 30 hours, level 42, earned around 3.5k atoms. 
---
It's not a bad system at all. 
---
It‚Äôs because the anthem demo was such trash that EA had to pull out the big guns so people forget about that mess.
---
Doesnt work for me. Have 4 spotlights with my turrets and didnt change a thing. They still sit looking at enemies.
---
I know that you ask about PVE servers, but if I want to be honest. I personally would like to see always-on PVP for minority of people, who actually want to play PVP. So I can play solo PVE.
---
But what we really need, is more story missions and missions, that have little more purpose than go waypoint A and kill everything and quest solved. 
---
They're squishy little babies compared to the ones in FO3.
---
Whitesprings fountain cures mutations?
---
Right!? Who wants to get 1 shotted just to lose caps and aid.
---
‚ÄúWe hear you and we‚Äôre gonna make changes to the game, we here you we promise but none of these changes were anything anyone wanted but we have been reporting things to the devs and we hear you!‚Äù
---
I've never had an experience where the game hasn't crashed.
---
Oh yesh, totally. I‚Äôm in the mid-40s so being around Top of the World feels about right, especially since that‚Äôs where my quest are sending me. 
---
So you are say you want it and have no problem with it.
---
I definitely agree with the combinations of legendary effects that fallout offers they work better against AI enemies and not players. Them nerfing the legendary effects just ruins said effects. 
---
Why not?
---
If you‚Äôre online in the game. I think you set yourself up for pvp by agreeing to the TOS and griefing is a made up scenario by people who feel cheated by the terms of service they agreed to.
---
What platform?
---
Alright I‚Äôll pay full price but I‚Äôm not going to be online for long right now
---
By buying skins from the previous Fallout in the atomic shop?  No thanks.  
---
great
---
This post is funny. Apex is such a minimum effort game that requires you to have a pulse and luck just like every other battle royal game hid Ina corner for 20 minutes and won the game yesterday. I love this kind of shit post because your trying to compare a game no one had any expectations about to a game that been highly anticipated. Free to play battle royal games are just another grab for your wallet.
---
That is why the pvp supporters are.so vocal.  They know.  They are not dumb.
---
Wow lol. Just go to those towers that give you locations.  Ranger clothes everywhere. 
---
Cant count the amount of ranger outfits I have pawned to the robots.
---
nobody compares the game 
---
I mean how a game should be launched 
---
Stealth build lets you have every shot be, what? 3.5x increased damage? 
---
I've never logged in and my camp spot been taken :)
---
My heavy laser turret and my rocket turret just sit looking at me dying to a mole rat in front of my base. I was literally a couple metters from them. Mole rat managed to kill me and they still didnt shoot. Was testing out how long they would take to shoot the thing
---
No PVP, The engine is not built for it, I feel it's built for exploration and PVE better. Please add more content along those lines.
---
Not necessary dont want to split the player base even more after pvp servers come.
---
\#PostOfTheDay
---
Do they even exist?  Things I've never seen:
---
Sturdy Metal Plans
---
Heavy Metal Plans
---
Also, do Heavy versions exist of the Marine Armor plans?  I found the Marine Armor plans, but they are just Sturdy in the crafting menus, and they are outperformed by Heavy Combat armor it seems.  Also sad that Heavy Leather limbs outclass Heavy Combat limbs overall.
---
That doesn‚Äôt explain at all why they don‚Äôt add a reconnect feature. Not every disconnect is a crash. 
---
Talked about that just the other day with my friends
---
All I wanted was a fallout 4 reskin to play with my friends. WITH, not AGAINST.
---
I've never looked up nuke launch codes online: I have only launched 1 and decoded it myself (with help from my gf) .
---
I get this a lot with hunting rifles.
---
The stagger effect needs a rework full stop.
---
A level 10 Yao Guai should not be able to stagger a level 52 player in full Excavator armour while also doing zero damage.
---
Yes. Absolutely.  PvP is only for assholes.
---
I do enjoy it as well but there‚Äôs been many frustrating moments with bugs that just makes me want to stop playing.   
---
Xbox AND PC.  I bought copies for both, but the PC version is just as bad if not worse.  The only upside to PC is mods, 60fps + and ability to remove the vaseline smear effect.
---
That would be awesome!
---
That doesn't mean shit. If you knew what you were talking about, you'd understand that bugs don't affect everyone. You could play every single piece of the game 100 times and maybe still not have the issues that crop up for other people. Like I said, ignorance.
---
Just dinged lvl 200 last night. My first TSE dropped a few nights ago. Pretty lucky roll, it's a bolt action pipe rifle. 
---
I got really lucky early on and got a 3* lvl 5 explosive pump action shotgun (vampiric and fast reloads) from the forest wolf event. Used that thing forever...
---
Lately I've been running an unyielding melee build and have been getting all kinds of good drops. Luck is around 25 most of the time. I've vendored tons of two shot guns and insigating/bloodied melee weapons I would've changed my build around for earlier. Luck helps for sure.
---
I want dailies to respawn daily. Or missions that rarely do pop up to actually be completed instead of bugging out or never working since launch.
---
Yup, happens in first or third person, and to pretty much any gun. 
---
Awesome haven't played around with that yet thanks!!!
---
At least you can earn them thru playing the game.  "Play, earn points, get unlocks" rather than just straight up "give us monies".
---
It seems that this game is geared towards consoles i guess? Idk, most people i know that don't like it bought it for pc, but on console it runs smoothly depending on how bad my internet wants to be
---
Sneak crits don't work if something is already in combat because of a bug I thought
---
Agreed, although I do like the kill everything quest/events except they need tougher enemies. How about a gulper or deathclaw hoard
---
I think PvP is better in the long-term. Bethesda AI has always been top tier autistic, only way to have a challenging and not tedious fight is by attacking another player.
---
I find myself spending 30 minutes scrounging pa and generator locations collecting until I hit 10-12 and burn at least half of those looking for plastic and lead. After that I might have some time to actually play the game.
---
Amen 
---
I think it should have been an open world builder, no camps, just build anywhere and let people and creep spawns do whatever to it.  It also needs actual rule playing tools so people can take on roles like traveling caravans, shop owners, mercs, etc.  It needs a monetary interface and barter system.  It needs an event builder so people can make quests and jobs (would consume resources to develop structures, place creeps/npcs, and tailor loot drops).  Basically Bethesda really needed to push the open world concept and the social concept.  It needs to be a world where people can actually do things 
---
Launched? how ones free and has no story no enemies that aren't player controlled and EXTREMELY REPETITIVE, as well as we just picked up the same gun but mines purple so I win...
---
Or fallout a game where the average player has quit only because they ran out of content 3 months after the game came out? 
---
Your comparing apples to oranges here.
---
Yeah the respawn times seem way too long in the generators
---
Go raid the Super Mutants at Grafton Steel!
---
Just NO PvP...  you can do PvE raids like how raiding works in some games.  Basically get a team and go raid/clear out a place.  West Tek has high level Super Mutants for a good fight.
---
I've never had a hissy fit over a glitch or bug in the game. 
---
With this one simple trick your mole rat will become a radscorpion! Vault dwellers hate it!
---
I never could find a lot of gauss ammo 
---
Fallout fans: "We want multiplayer co-op."
---
Bethesda: "PVP?"
---
Fallout fans: "No. Co-op PVE."
---
Bethesda: "Ok, ok. How about a PVE world but with a dash of PVP?"
---
Fallout fans: ..........blank...stare.............
---
Heavy leather I can max out at 32/77 heavy combat BoS is 35/45 so that 3 less DR is well worth the extra 30 ER.     But yea I don‚Äôt know if they even exist but idk how to get the polished/ mod for heavy metal.   Heavy metal does exists just never have seen the plans 
---
\*fatman
---
That's awesome. What a great vanilla way to play. Hope you two have fun.
---
Riiight.
---
Amen, and it‚Äôs ironic you say that considering you‚Äôre part of the raiders X3 
---
In my experience it bugs out while on a team. 
---
I am not defending the game, but Juicehead is a moron.  A day before patch 5 he heralded it as the best one yet and so amazing.  Of course in the subsequent hotfix video he backtracked with "It had the potential to be the best patch".  Dude, every patch ever has the potential to be the best, you were just fishing for views.
---
Of course a game that could be played either single player or a coop campaign mode would be much better suited towards Fallout.  I think this has been said many times since FO76 was introduced to the public.
---
Pc runs perfect for me with an 8th gen i5, 1080ti, and 144 hz 1440p monitor. It's such an old engine that it runs like buttee. 
---
How is the PC version worse?
---
Same error code as well? Damn
---
I *think* you can still stack melee bobbleheads. I think they only nerfed the explosive bobblehead.
---
Happens to me with every gun in 3rd person
---
I too noticed this after 300 hrs of entertainment. Worst purchase in the history of purchases ever.
---
 Yeh axe is a big help early on. Still, you can saw cleaver him, just means you gotta learn to slug it out faster. If you do, don‚Äôt use the trick mode, cause the normal mode is serrated and deals bonus damage to beasts like his second form. One thing for sure is don‚Äôt run out your stamina bar against tough foes or bosses. 1-2 hits then get ready to dodge is a good rule.
---
Blood vials drop at a high rate from almost all Yarnham enemies, those big werewolf dudes can drop multiples of them but at your level it may not be worth it. In fact I frequently would come back to Yarnham just to farm blood vials if I got low.
---
This game can support pvp and pve balance at the same time, but it has neither because the devs have no clue how to balance pve, let alone try to create interesting pvp.
---
Game was very clearly rushed out tbf. There are many very basic QOL features that really should have been included on launch that still aren‚Äôt in the game. Kinda feels like someone behind the scenes kept saying ‚Äúno it‚Äôll take more time‚Äù 
---
He is just milking 76 for ad money.  He doesn't care about the game either way.  
---
Or 3 freinds would be better
---
I mean fo4 had the ability to be coop because they could‚Äôve pulled a halo due to the cryopods 
---
I like this card. I only had room for level 2 and even that makes a noticeable difference.
---
XB1
---
The sack hood and Silver Shroud trench coat works well - check out the [photos](https://discord.gg/8MmTbmm) in the encounters channel
---
Well if you‚Äôve got pacifist mode they won‚Äôt take damage, or even realize they‚Äôre being shot at
---
It's early, so i am just going to say I could see both sides of the argument. I am NOT into PVP but I could see how the community over the years would be screaming for the same game, but with PVP and the same with co-op. I just think they didn't know the skew on the amount of people that wanted each. 
---
Same dude. Gj!
---
I thought they realised they were being shot at, that's good to know I won't feel guilty now  
---
There was exactly one enemy in fallout 4 that made you consider using a specific type of weapon, and that was solely because of a misplaced decimal point.
---
I don't think you can stack any. But also bloody legendary builds, if they push it, can do 2k per swing
---
I don‚Äôt hate the PVP from a Wasteland perspective, but it doesn‚Äôt mesh with the story that they are trying to get us to tell for them.
---
‚ÄúThe vault doors open. It‚Äôs Reclamation day! You look around and see the people you‚Äôve spent the last 25 years forming a community with. Every single one of them looks you dead in the eyes and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a 30 minute head start and if I ever see you again I will absolutely murder you.‚Äù‚Äù
---
Every person in the map has been a part of your daily life for 25 years. It‚Äôs not Fallout 3, where you leave to find something. It‚Äôs not Fallout 4, where you have to leave to survive.  It‚Äôs Fallout 76, where everyone leaves together to rebuild.
---
Sure not everyone will be best buddies, but ‚Äúall I needed was to find a gun on a corpse and now my dreams of murdering you all can come true!‚Äù Seems like a stretch.
---
I run a min max build with nerd rage and all sorts of low health perks and percents and mutations, with all that being said i can pull 500 damage off of a base weapon damage of like 75
---
well, 90% of all fallout 76 is fallout 4, have had enough time to leave it stable, but we are still in an early access 
---
In addition, the current content of the fallout is totally null 
---
Not even deathclaws have an easy time with ants. There is a deathclaw that spawns with 3 ants in a power station near watoga, he taks a while to kill them.
---
With the way this game handles frame rate and other stuff chances are they won‚Äôt even see the light trail left by your shot.  Just double check where you‚Äôre shooting next time though  ^ ^
---
could also be system my friend plays on ps4 and he talks like griefers are half the population my xbox friend talks like they are 60% I'm pc and I saw 4 guys try to kill me once in the beta.....
---
You could definitely be right, I had just seen people here and elsewhere saying they still stacked.
---
My TSE combat shotgun still functions well after the nerf, itll 2 shot a lv91 death deathclaw and 1 shot everything else besides maybe supermutants 
---
If anything i feel like the nerfs homogenized all the TSE builds to be shotgun based, I was using a TSE leaver action before and now its basically like any other gun.
---
Apart from TSE, bloodied melee is the only insane damage build as far as I'm aware 
---
Basically, of it wasn't going to give us more that FO4, it needed to be vastly different than FO4.  The main problem with FO76 is it didn't take any advantage of being an online, multiplayer environment.  It also didn't go beyond FO4.  It actually feels like less of a game than FO4 because all the NPCs are gone and replaced by holotapes and notes everywhere.  The world feels empty.  Ideally the players should be able to fill in that world, but they can't.  They have no tools to do so because the build system, the lack of object permanence, and the lack of any social tools and systems prevents is from filling in the void.  We end up with a text/voiceover driven story, cheesy mini games, and zero personal influence or mark on the world.  It feels like you are meaningless in this world and the world itself doesn't matter...and that's kind of super bad.

Bethesda should have released FO76 as an arena style shooter spinoff... like Quake 3 was for the Quake series and UT was for the Unreal series! Complete with a ladder and ranked tournament system. E-sports are going to explode in the coming years, investors and stocks are about to go crazy. This is a gigantic new market.
---
The fallout franchise already has tons of weapons, characters/factions, locations and customization. Everything is already there and well established. Even most of the assets!
---
Unlock outfits, complete challenges, found our own raider gang or BoS chapter with your friends, BUY cosmetic items and skins in the shop to complete your look... and: build your own arenas (like in Doom 2016)!
---
People would've loved it. 
---
Finally something new and different, yet familiar.
---
Truly a potential cash cow... uhm, cash brahmin.
---
And nobody would've confused 76 for "THE new" fallout game and roasted it for not meeting expectations. In the meantime, Bethesda could've worked on the real new singleplayer sequel.
---
Aw man, I'd play the shit out of  "Fallout Arena". Please make it happen...
---
The Helmets out of this addition still sell for $80-125, so it is worth it
---
Co-op is what most people wanted from a Fallout experience.  
---
Just imagine Fallout 4 but instead of Piper, Cait or Nick Valentine you have your girlfriend or a friend of yours playing through the story together.
---
interpret all our requests as pvp modes 
---
You have to make friends if you want that privilege. Make friends!
---
Did you do friends yet!?!?!
---
marsupial helps I see them I jump 20 feet backwards land on a car and open fire (also my gf has the same powers in real life around spiders)
---
&gt; I've been blowing the heads of Super Mutants all day. 
---
Where's the NSFW tag on this post? Geez..
---
Rifles put out higher numbers but pistols make full use of the full 15 AGI points. I had a rifle build with 15 PER and 15 LCK but you're so stretched thin on the AGI front that you have to sacrifice some good perks. I used a lever action amd I dropped out of VATS way too often for my liking. With a revolver and 15 AGI with Grim Reapers Sprint you can basically just sit in VATS for ever some times and put out much more crits in the same period of time as opposed to rifles. There is much more VATS down time in a rifle build unless you go 15 in PER, AGI and LCK which uses all your points.
---
I love this reply due to the fact I relate with your gf with certain spiders
---
I get why you're asking for this, and it's to use as a second hand storage, and my counterpoint to that would be : big fat no. There's trading for a reason.
---
Yep and how much of titan fall was used to make apex?
---
I have to say after the TSE guns nerf I slowly started logging less and less. I despise PvP and the only guns that actually killed things like a gun should were the TSE guns. Almost cried when I saw how crappy my TSE 50 cal become after the patch. Meanwhile melee can still one hit enemies but its pure nonsense to play a FPS as melee. Nothing is more clunky in fps games than melee attacks. Only game that kinda managed to pull it off was Kingdom Come and even them its not perfect.
---
Haven't logged in for 5 days now. 
---
Nah I'm gonna be loading that up as soon as the download hits, I'm sure more than plenty of people are looking forward to it. There's a reason they showed a player raider charging at the player character in the E3 video before getting his head blown off... It's what people wanna see
---
I usually drop known plans or magazines I‚Äôll never use in a bag outside the door to my CAMP whenever I‚Äôm leaving and need weight space and it‚Äôs usually despawned by the time I come back but I‚Äôll spend days away from my CAMP with multiple logs in and out so I don‚Äôt suppose I really have a clue. Lol
---
These people who trigger the workshop to come fight you elsewhere on the map usually work in teams. So unless you know who their friends are and block them as well they will still know your location. 
---
I even had a squad attack my workshop, my person and my house (3 different locations all over the map) with explosive weapons all within a span of about 3 seconds. None of them got wanted for it ofc and they all blocked me before even engaging. Such interesting PVP.
---
you should put adrenal perk on to i can could upwards of 1k damage before the nerf and i probalely still could sence might be lvl 3 or 4 not sure but these buffs are massive with the more kills you stack up
---
Mine shows the same for plastic, but only in component view 
---
Someone makes a simple comment and expression and all the key board warriors wake up, its cute really.
---
The launcher is awful.  The game doesn't quit properly half the time and locks up.  On pressing launch the mouse cursor is bound within the launcher box. 
---
 Frames drop hard in heavy areas as the servers cannot relay data fast enough.  The UI is awful and is just ported from console.  Try sliding down music and see it never goes to the beginning, so clunky.
---
Going back on a lot of actions require the tab key, when almost every other game does ESC.  It's pretty much a standard in most games.
---
The ultra wide is broken, again.  The in-game mouse cursor doesn't have a high refresh rate and feels like manovering through treacle.  The game uses too much RAM and often gets memory leaks.  Even when in flat woods using a terminal.
---
These are my experiences so ymmv.
---
I've never launched a nuke
---
The quests takes so long and is so tedious I either have to stop playing to do life stuff or get tired of it and stop playing 
---
If i could i wouldnt have them lol
---
Vtu jacket and jeans not tracksuit 
---
Hmm interesting thanks. 
---
They actually have a system in effect if your in a team and get disconnected you can rejoin by "play with team" instead of play it auto rejoins the world you were just on
---
the major problem is however most of the time I see a disconnect its cause the entire server shard died as my team mates also get booted from the server the exact same time - we use discord for team chat and in game were set to area (so we can talk to people in game as we walk past or see if they need help) so when someone disconnects they go - hey did you guys disconnect - 95% of the time its all of us getting booted 
---
really it seems still we need stability upgrades but if I had to guess we probably are crashing cause someones trying to cheat every time I see the waiting for server message there is always a cluster of 2-3 people not moving I fast travel there and ones logging in and out I toss a few grenades they log out and suddenly server goes to normal.....
---
I think the game would have been better if if catered to either pvp or pve crowd rather than try to do both. 
---
That said, I would have preferred 100% mandatory, always on pvp. 
---
And how much of titanfall was used to write this game?
---
I run the adrenal mutation and the adreniline perk at max, im an absolute beast but can be killed by a ball peen hammer lol i got perks for damege resistance and all that tho, i maybe die twice a day lol
---
I'm PC and I've noticed a sharp decline in active players.
---
I've been joining servers with a friend on - have some people from trading and some others I met along the way.  Don't really need the team for the silo - everyone will come to the queen battle after that though.
---
To be honest, I can‚Äôt remember. When I first started using a marine torso, I got dropped as my chest piece, I already had the ability to make it Dense. (Over 1 month ago). I just happened to notice I could apply Dense to it once I found the ultra light and was going to apply that to get my sneak up. I haven‚Äôt seen the marine dense plan (only mod at Watoga) since I was aware it existed.
---
I want PVP, carebear just gets too boring with the current building limitations.
---
there aren't actually servers its 1 big server with thousands of shards which are pieces of servers but its easier to say server as people stare blankly at you.....
---
&gt; Heavy leather I can max out at 32/77 heavy combat BoS is 35/45 so that 3 less DR is well worth the extra 30 ER.
---
Ya, that's what I mean.  It's kind of sad that heavy leather is in general better than heavy combat.  I have BOS heavy combat torso and then Studded Heavy leather limbs.  I'd love to see my limbs as heavy combat as well.
---
I haven't picked up any Heavy metal pieces yet.  But do they not share mods with Light Metal like the Light/Sturdy/Heavy leather does?  For leather you only have to get mods for the Light versions, and they can apply equally to all your Sturdy and Heavy pieces.
---
big if true
---
I'm not too sure. I watched a video a week ago of a dude using said sneak build to take out the Queen in half a minute. Just tore through her. 
---
There were various solar panels in New Vegas
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
Yeah same dude. It's pretty hard as a solo player 90% of the time. It's not so bad though when you can just go kill the queen with others who launch.
---
The ones in your stash won't show the quest marker next to them, and yes, they will remain separated.
---
Last night, I had already dropped 2, and then went to the bunker, I retrieved 5 from the bunker that remained separated, since the quest wasn't triggered, but then got a message from someone and server hopped to join their server, forgetting about the TDs, the quest then triggered and combined them. oops, got to gather more again.
---
im jealous
---
I convinced two friends to preorder the game with me. One managed to get a refund, the other is still pissed at me (he couldnt get a refund).
---
enough to not have problems at every step 
---
This game wont last 6 more months.
---
Note that this is an accounting bug, probably due to those Mainframe cores messing up the tracking of the component. I don't physically have that many steel. Even if I create knives 1/second, it would take 20 years to consume that many steel.
---
They should open one of the other vaults and make a  raid-type level with new enemies that would be cool 
---
I've clocked in over 400 hours of play and in that time I've only killed  nine players, all of them "wanted." The trophy for killing 20 players is one of only two that I need for the platinum (that and the one for standing at ground zero when the bomb falls). The last three times I've wound up being "wanted" it was because I came to defend someone else's workshop and accidentally shot one of their structures, and in each case I found the nearest player, got on my microphone, hopped out of my power armour and asked them if they'd kill me just so I didn't have to deal with being wanted anymore myself. 
---
There's very little *point* to PvP for me. It's not terribly fun or interesting or rewarding. I mostly just regard it as a chore in a game that I'm otherwise enjoying. I'd be happy with dedicated PvE servers, for sure. 
---
I think the pvp element gives it a more realistic touch, as well as the communication limitations to a certain area. When I started the game, it really had that post-apocalyptic survival feel, where you are all alone, under-equipped and have to find your way around. Its not used for sure and even if someone engages you in pvp you have to fire back. So I think its a nice idea that gives the game atmosphere, but its no relly working as intended. 
---
I'ld like to see some central places where player can go to, to find team mates. Like a meetup place and then upon teaming up an option to have a text chat, cause I cant talk to the mic while playing, which is mostly at night with the family sleeping. 
---
i have 8 mutations on my charector i have max strength and 13 intelligence on my charector i have rifleman 3 and another rifleman 3 i think plus bloody mess 2 and that exsplosive perk in intelligence my 3 favorite weapons are my 3 star super sledge 3 star guass rifle with explosive anti armour and some thing else and my 2 shot tesla rifle which is preety leathal i might have some thingelse but im not sure i also only use power armour i have like over 60 or 70 fusion cores
---
Good inputs. Yeah I don't have enough any of those problems or notice them. I use a PS4 controller to play. This launcher is pretty slow at best, even on m SSD. 
---
Did u like the Xbox or PC version more?
---
Creation engine is based on gamebryo though, which was made for multiplayer.
---
yea, you might as well just play Fortnut if you dont want to do some research ...
---
its actually pretty impressive to watch as she is a computer geek like me but moment she see's a spider she is like a ninja using double jump to evade it with 15 agility and 15 luck
---
I wonder what OS the server runs on? Most likely a form of Linux I would think, but who knows, it could be one of Todd's old Win 3.1 Laptops from College, still has the beer and nacho cheese stains on it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just annoying. I would enjoy hardcore survival over this. So many of my friends have just quit because they hate having to stop every 20 minutes to find water or cook food. 
---
If there was no PVP I'd have nothing to do. Other players are the only challenge left at this point.
---
It is not PvE enough for you?
---
Ap is literally extra damage in this game, mostly because Bethesda doesn't understand their armor system and just gives everything over the top amounts of armor
---
Yea leather I scrapped light and received the mods for heavy.   I scrapped light metal chest last night, received mods but couldn‚Äôt apply it to my chest prices.
---
Yea combat armor is the best average dr/er but honestly I‚Äôm trying to run metal chest, metal limb, and 3 leather limbs.  Before perks or anything else that alone puts me near 293/267 which I think is the best combo to max out. Could be wrong but certain this combo gets the most of both resistance near even amount 
---
And that's awesome that is your experience with the game. Other's (myself included) like to mind their own business and not be some bored 10 year olds entertainment. I get messed with several times per session. It gets old. It really sucks to have to server hop because some kid is bored with the lack of content. 
---
&gt; When a team take over a Workshop, everyone on the team will start PvP with the owner and both of them can kill each other.  
---
Unfortunately that's incorrect.  
---
If we have the owner of the Workshop, player A, the player trying to capture it B, and his team C. You end up with:  
---
B begins the capture, this sets PvP status: A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A.  
---
Since B is in a team this also sets the PvP flag: C-&gt;A  
---
(Sidenote: My guess to the cause of this bug is that the server treats the automatic PvP flagging of A-&gt;B the same as if A had attacked B, thus flagging A as a valid target for B's teammates.. Despite B being the aggressor in this case)  
---
Note that at this point, player A does NOT have PvP flag against C, ie: The workshop owner will only deal slap-damage against B's teammates until they strike him first.  
---
It's been like this since day 1 of the beta.  
---
It could be with the right perks, but I still miss the fallout 3/nv dialog choices.
---
If you cut out pvp all together you will still have a small groups that complain. I think people should just stick to the hunter/hunted station for pvp. Somebody said like destiny, haven't played it. I say PVP like Diablo II or III.
---
Xbox hands down.  It is nice to use with a controller and the social aspect was heavier as they have groups, making it easier to trade or team up against the SBQ.
---
It's crazy to say that as usually i'm a FPS snob, and refuse to play anything less than 144fps.  But I got used to 30 frames after a while.  How do you find PVP with a controller?
---
bethesda does not care, because we already paid the game 
---
They sell for a lot. But people that have them usually want to trade.
---
Well not the plans because they can‚Äôt be sold to vendors but a lot of people selling good stuff everywhere lately 
---
Minus the few that actually do get griefed. I was literally minding my own business when out of nowhere two people came up to me and shot me with their explosive weapons. Mind you this was after the Nerf patch with the two shot and explosive legendaries. I also had pacifist mode turned on so I don't accidentally shoot somebody's friend while fighting.
---
I am in the process of consolidating all of them on one character (have 5) so I will get some screen shots tonight.
---
I'm not sure ATM if I have any more Underarmor plans, I have learned quite a few, and still looking for BOS Shielded.
---
GT= Medieval Paul
---
Hit me up in game this evening, or send me an XBL message, and I can let you know.
---
&gt;  I scrapped light metal chest last night, received mods but couldn‚Äôt apply it to my chest prices.
---
Maybe the mods you got were for the limbs?  Back when I was doing my leather scrapping to get the mods, it would just say "Studded" but not tell me which it was for (Legs, Arms, Torso) so I had to keep doing it until I got Studded Three times.
---
I haven't focused on getting mods for metal yet, as require screws and that's too much to mass craft/mod unlike level 1 leather pieces that are basically free crafts.
---
Maybe it was just that area's day to get fucked?
---
Is it in alpha already? Heh
---
It wasn't made for multiplayer - it was adapted for multiplayer.  Gamebryo is ancient and has been around forever...  before multiplayer.  And its only good for MMORPGs, but with FO76 trying to emulate Fortnite, it simply doesn't work.  RPGs just don't make for balanced, meaningful PvP interactions.
---
Ya, CAMP plans are available pretty much all the time.  A few are still RNG but not many.
---
NEET most likely.
---
There is so much that could be better in this game, sadly Bethesda doesn¬¥t really care.
---
If you go into the map, click the button for the social menu, you can see all people in your map, plus everyone from your previous instance. He may have joined your game from there. You can block them to prevent it. 
---
I went ahead and spent some of my hard-farmed atoms (not really that hard) on the clown outfit, smiley mask, and croquette mallet, some caps on a bloody sledgehammer and Unyielding armor, and some perk points to switch to a irradiated melee cannibal in preparation for the new raider mode. Looking forward to playing my cannibal clown. Gonna tell people that I'm going to eat them
---
No I wanted it to be more like what this new survival mode is going to be. If the game is built upon the only human characters being human players then there should be better incentive to attack other players or defend yourself from other players. There shouldn't have ever been any form of "safe mode" unless it was in a separate playlist 
---
&gt;Picked up one with Anti-Armour a couple weeks ago, massive difference
---
I've been wanted twice both defending someone else's workshop
---
I did post thete to cause i have one and wanna know like an exact value or rarity 
---
what system are you on? i think these things dont work on xbox
---
Absolutely. There aren't nearly enough online co-op campaign games made, imo. 
---
until each challenge gives you 10 atoms 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call this game an MMO, I think its far from it the only thing that draws it to that is that it‚Äôs online servers are more than 4 or so people
---
You mean the plan that could for now just be labeled, "Tuba"?
---
Hmm, I did not consider that. I guess I need to get my hands on a combat helmet.
---
Perforating is what I choose. It‚Äôs about equivalent to max rank Tank Killer and it does stack with that perk. I think the both of them reduce armor to around 40% of normal. Combined with instigating I think it‚Äôll punch a lot of damage through. 
---
Exact numbers are hard to get because there is a display bug that prevents Awareness from reporting the new DR after things like perforating mags take effect. It is less effective than Anti-Armor legendary effect which is 50%.
---
So I choose perforating on everything except maybe high ammo capacity rifles like combat, handmade, assault etc cause with those you have so many shots with Stinging mags.
---
Xbox One X
---
Droonkle
---
I accepted an invite to another server and the disease countdown reset itself to the full time limit. When fast traveling, the disease countdown also increased by 15~ minutes. The homebody perk was not working either.
---
I would argue that 30 more ER is not really worth anything after you already have about 200, there are no enemies in the game with high per hit energy damage, while energy damage in general is super rare. On the other hand physical attacks can reach monstrous levels, requiring a lot more armor to negate, and 95% of all attacks in this game are physical, meaning I would rather have that extra physical defense over energy.
---
Can u confirm if making a new character gives them access to all the challenges again?
---
If only they would do it like ARK and release the server so I can spin up my own or join with friends.
---
I have 3 and never had one in FO4 despite trying 1000s of times and buffing Luck to 30. The drop rate has to be nerfed in FO76.
---
It‚Äôs how I achieved 1.5k+ per shot with my bloodied gatling, love melting the queen even with a crowd around.
---
The point is that they were all much better with mods. 76 needs mod support even more than the other games did.
---
You watch that shit?
---
I can not confirm, I'm not having secondary characters  but it must be quite tedious 
---
Someone in another thread told me I might have unlocked the paintjob for the combat helmet, but I have yet to test it. Perhaps that's what happened to both of us.
---
It‚Äôs the god damn apocalypse. Open world PvP doesn‚Äôt not make sense. ü§î
---
Everything I know is a lie.
---
No comments as of yet.
---
This is the issue I think they'll have with survival mode. Griefers will soon realise theh can be killed at will and will jump back to adventure mode and nobody else really wants pvp
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 and you‚Äôve the time to hop on I can craft you one. 
---
pippysmudges is the user Id
---
If not they spawn in the dmv, sometimes at Harper‚Äôs on a green chair in a destroyed building by the robot, and in the cheese hut in Helvetia 
---
You done scared it to death.  
---
Fuck yeah it would have been. That's what we asked for lol. But you know pvp  no story fallout battle royal is okay. üôÉüôÉ
---
I agree with this so much. Can‚Äôt explain to you how many times I‚Äôve had trolls destroying my house even though I had my steel deposit and water purifiers free for public use. Not even to mention the times I‚Äôm targeted out of everyone on the map when I claim a workshop. Love fighting a level 79 when I‚Äôm a level 21 just starting out. I‚Äôm all about helping and working together. I get some people like pvp and that‚Äôs fine. Just not for me. I should be able to enjoy fallout and play with my boyfriend and help other people. Feels good to know there are other people that feel the same way about wanting to help others out 
---
Same here with the picklock tried to google it no answers 
---
I never could one shot anything. Best weapon I had was a junkies lever action that had explosive bullets. I played the shit out of this game since it came out and have done all the things! I'm done being easy on Bethesda. They have fucked up over and over. The game is not getting better. So quit judging me, just wait they will do something stupid again, cause that's what Bethesda does.
---
Literally everyone on this sub since release, yes. 
---
Im not sure this would be a solution, because there is clearly a technical limitation, that must be addressed by the stash weight limit (back when they've raised the limit, they said its in place due to technical reasons).
---
Now, IMO the issue is not the WEIGHT limit itself, but rather the amount different entities in the game world; which is kept in line with the weight limit. Thus 'cheating' with the stash limit itself in ways like this would inhibit their (hopefully) temporary solution.
---
He‚Äôs a good friend of mine.
---
Repair all...
---
I've never launched a Nuke 
---
I've never played in a team
---
I've never attacked a player
---
I think it's because consoles are more accessible to little kids and people who act like little kids. Griefing is much more prevalent there.
---
ah ok, I haven't found a combat helmet yet, so I can't verify that
---
I actually had a level 26 guy come up to me (level 119 in power armor) and keep hitting me with a melee weapon as I was spawning into the world. I was still in that frozen state of not being able to move, but was taking a bunch of hits. I finally finished loading, and started to walk away, but he wouldn't stop... so, I pulled out my Grog axe, power swung into his face, and that was the end of that. Then he "revenged", and I sniped him before he could move out of his spot. I said screw it, and logged into another server.. I had better shit to do than deal with that chump 
---
Yep
---
I had a few varients of the weapon, I didn't understand any of them as they all shot off a very limp projectile.... It traveled (arc'd?) like 5 feet then went blaaahhhhh and fizzled into nothing.
---
I was like... yeah.... not using that again. That weapon needs a little blue pill to help its performance. 
---
I think it would have been considerably better as a proper fallout title with 4 player optional co op. That would have been sweet. 
---
The people that want to force other people into PvP are louder than those that want to do PvP. Having 3 server options, PvE normal and PvP most likely normal will be completely dead. PvP will be populated about as much as the hunter hunted radio station. 
---
I'm pretty hard into melee and just use vats in pvp.
---
Honestly if feels busted, but overall I've only had like 3 real PVP fights and won them all.
---
Earlier into my character I was a rifleman build and did pretty well with a mouse and keyboard, only had one pvp fight around that time, but with a sniper scope the game feels better than pubg.
---
I'm a pretty competitive fps gamer though on keyboard and mouse, high diamond ow every season. Honestly this game is 100 times better with a controller, played leaning back in a chair or couch and is my only controller experience like that these days. 
---
Can‚Äôt one shot a person who is not engaged in pvp.  That‚Äôs a debunked rumor.
---
if you have radworms it buffs a lot of your stats, lockpick included 
---
Is it a PVP though?  I could completely avoid other people if I wanted to in this game.  
---
Regardless of whether you question yourself l, when you make an online game it's common sense that people will have disconnects on their end from time to time. If you don't think of basic things like that you probably shouldn't be making games
---
Because a bug that was introduced in the hot fix last week after another bug was introduced after a mod scrapping fix a few days before.
---
Before Patch:  Mods would auto scrap with crafting / repairing.
---
After Patch:  Mods would no longer auto scrap, but neither would Bulk junk
---
After Patch Hotfix:  Bulk junk would auto scrap when crafting / repairing again.  But would also auto scrap with Scrap All Junk.
---
Now we get to wait for the next patch to attempt to fix it again.  Cause they aren't likely to do another Hotfix before then.
---
Have you enjoyed your experience so far?
---
You just need weapons that can beat about 200 armor is all, meaning a weapon that deals in excess of 600 damage per hit, or 150 with 75%armor piercing. Any weapon below that threshold is basically unusable, oh and don't forget energy weapons don't get piercing effects, so 600 or nothing.
---
Speculation, but I think it might be related to rad worms. It's adding 50% to all kinds of random effects.
---
Server lag had your damage ignored thus you weren't registered as a loot receiver.
---
Thank you so much. I blocked him on ps4 so I wouldn‚Äôt get any messages from him and when you do that it just says (blocked) by his name and you can‚Äôt click on it to do anything when you block them from your console (or at least that‚Äôs what I saw) but this will help me out a lot because I‚Äôve seen his name in my server before but this time he actually was coming after me for no good reason. But thank you so so much 
---
Yeah the whole reason I was so salty was because the advertising made it look like a 4 player co-op game.
---
If you take a workshop you‚Äôre agreeing that you‚Äôre willing to pvp. If someone comes and finds me on the map when I‚Äôve got a workshop and tries this then great, more caps for me.
---
&gt; while I haven't had many problems with griefers
---
lol
---
Honestly would not be playing without this mod. Increases QoL by a LOT. 
---
Cheers for the update I‚Äôve waited 1000s of plastic as I forget what I‚Äôm doing and still scrap all then relies I‚Äôve done it again lol   
---
Fallout should have a pure coop story mode, a pvp fps mode where you can choose from different charaters from the game, each having different skills (like team fortress/overwatch), and then a Battle royale mode! reeeeeeeeeee
---
So you‚Äôre telling me the balanced, meaningful, PvP encounters I‚Äôve had have all been a lie?
---
No. Not without significant game changes.
---
i completely agree.  with a single server-base like we have now, the hybrid system makes sense.  but once they stand up a whole new set to accommodate full PVP they should drop the current servers down to PVE only.  Along with that they need to disable VATS targeting of other players.  
---
How about division style game?
---
Yep using a multiplayer framework to build a multiplayer game must have been so hard. And building a multiplayer world off a single player framework was so easy.
---
I'm all about helpin people out! My first camp was a roadside stop near the tea kettle with a free farm and workbenches set up.
---
Stuff for anyone to take. I had more plants than I'd need.
---
The... Four(?) times i engaged in pvp, out of my ***100+ hours***, was retaliation for someone willfully destroying my camp, or someone attacking me or my friends.
---
I play fallout to explore the wastes, enjoy the story. Play how I want. Not deal with some asshat who has nothing better to do than to follow me and try to ruin my day.
---
No, fuck off
---
Except "rebuild" isn't actually an option because the servers have no persistence beyond your being logged into it - and you can't log back into the same one deliberately so if you're booted you're fucked even if there *was* persistence -  so... you're pretty much screwed on the point of actually doing what they claimed you were being sent out to do.
---
the "sulfur water" when collected as an inventory item just becomes dirty water
---
If the gameworld is empty, the whales who buy all the atomic shop shit won't have anyone to play with. The atom shop works in FO76 because its a shared environment, when they tried the bgs store for FO4 it didnt work because you could just download mods to add in cool items and weapons.
---
If players leave FO76 the game basically dies without new influx of cash or players and it looks bad on BGS and they lose face for share holders. Zenimax stock traded under ttwo symbol.
---
What legal battles are they fighting? Lol. Any sources to this claim?
---
ditto.  so many 100's of plastic......GONE!!!!
---
I can't tell if this is sarcastic. Good job. Playing both sides in an argument, smart
---
I don't. The pvp feels tacked on and barely present as it is. If they removed it I probably wouldn't even notice.
---
This subreddit already isn't representative of the total playerbase, much less full of people who are not going to play just to send a message in regards to content that comes out in a month, supposedly with some PvE content as well according to Community Managers.

---
To be fair if your camp is at the White springs clubhouse firing rockets and turrets at ghouls it deserves to be destroyed. If you peacefully living on the golf course you're in the clear. 
---
in conclusion . Bethesda screwed us both, because we bought the game let's hope they can take it on the right path at some point before it's too late 
---
Gee. So Fallout 5 would be better than this. How original of you.
---
Thing with the gauss rifle is, that even if you just START to charge the shot before going into VATS (or start charging shortly after going into it, like 1/4th of a second), your shot wont be treated as a VATS shot, just simple hipfire.
---
You can test this out pretty easily. You can consistently miss any number of 95% shots with a gauss by starting to charge the gun, go into VATS, start stepping sideways, and releasing the trigger when the enemy is NOT right in the middle of the screen. The shot will always simply go to the middle.
---
The other reason why this issue is the most apparent with the gauss rifle, is because a missed shot with a gauss is a lot more penalizing than missing with a semi-auto.
---
Im fairly sure that this is the case with every weapon, but since you cant start the shot with others before going into VATS, its not the apparent. The normal guns only suffer from the 1/4th second of delay after going into VATS, and the first missed shot isnt as apparent with a semi-auto.
---
I agree with you, I THINK scorchbeast is energy and  explosive only reason why I‚Äôd have that higher energy but otherwise I agree DR Is more important and heavy polished metal does like 125 chest, 72 for limbs 
---
The real issue is can we get PVE only servers to stop the griefers who will watch people who are in random areas of the map, and then head over there after that person leaves to see if they can wreck a base, or people who still have the terribly OP duped weapons so they can go over and wreck people who are not geared as well (and typically lower level)
---
True PVPers might slap you, or try to participate in PVP events, but if you don't respond they just get frustrated because they want an actual PVP experience, not some carebear who just happened to cross their path (which is why we a getting that new game mode)
---
Honestly the PVE server would serve best to deal with griefers.  
---
‚ÄúLet go, be afraid. You all taste so much better when you're afraid.‚Äù
---
Agreed, I quit playing a week ago but I still have it installed. I hope they fix it
---
Bethesda clearly needed more time to develop Fo76. Some higher ups thought otherwise and now BGS destroys their own reputation. Its sad.
---
Still im hopeful for the future with Fo76 and a possible Fo5 singleplayer. 
---
Fo76 is unique (I think) actually on the videogame world : it's open world with (short) multiplayer aspect. It's not really a MMORPG but more than a FPS World based like Destiny/Anthem/warframe.
---
It's really a RPG, with quest, craft , skillz evolution  etc.
---
Everytime I play, nbody try to PVP cause Fo76 players are RPG and coop players. We play this for RPG, If I want to Pvp, I go to other stuff.
---
The onlytime I take PVP token is when I miss and take a item in a controled area... ;)
---
I think pvp will definitivly killing the game.
---
(sry for my poor english)
---
I still have not been able to see who owns a camp. Also I hate the fact that because you are in a team and someone else in the team decides to start pvping, that now I am now able to be killed because of a team mate. Also lately I have noticed with pacifist mode on pvp'ers can still kill me even if I am not on a team to begin with. I was at a queen event just now a wanted guy was there and started one hit melee killing people after the event ended and I got killed because a team mate tried to kill them for the 1100 0r so cap. Then after the wanted person killed every one they could and took everyones drop stuff they logged of the server. 
---
You mean increase the number of bagel bombs 
---
Yeah, the game is an MMO at it's core though. I myself would not invest the time into another character but in other MMO's some of my friends have had a couple ALTS, at the same time all doing their daily quests or challenge. 
---
As I've mentioned, the resetting of challenges is still speculation but might be the best way to farm caps if true and follows the MMO industry standard or requiring EXTREME dedication. 
---
Anyways thanks for heads up on the 10 atom per challenge thing, I haven't got there yet but  I don't want to. Luckily there's nothing I need to buy yet and I've had a while to save. 
---
Children of just relates to the programming of CK, and not much else. 
---
Happy to help 
---
They should at least limit the mod options. There‚Äôs no reason to have a laser pointer or a recon scope or poisoned bolts on a crossbow. That makes no sense
---
Whoah easy there pard, it's not the Fallout 76 devs fault that the scorchbeasts are a pain in the ass...
---
Blame the skyrim devs.
---
on several occasions, i would server hop, only to end up right back in the same server.
---
It should be empty, it is empty and it's great. Period.
---
There are other people, they are human players.
---
Your taking a game too serious, which is your problem. OK, same example: Under radiation everything grew huge. WTF, Bethesda? From where they did get that mass? Nuke blast = everything dies = no food = nothing should grow in size.
---
Overseer clearly made a point in holotapes and it's the same reason, why all humans die in games and movies - there is a fist full of humans that survived the blasts and still they split up instead of joining forces.
---
You are playing a hero, every hero in movies/games don't just die like everyone else.
---
You just want to turn game changes against Bethesda that is it, because they changed something... I played Fallout 3, NV, 4 hundred of hours and I don't miss human NPC's in FO76, I had enough of that already. It would be nice if we had more NPC's like Rose, Graham, etc, but why need specifically humans for that? Your most likely just missing the interaction, not human NPC's, that is different topic. Imagine Bethesda will replace all Vendorbots with human vendors - will that make you happy, most likely not, so first please try to understand what you want.
---
Bethesda clearly said "no human NPC's" long before the game launched, multiple times! They stick to their plan and keep their word regarding this atleast.
---
Players can't even tell difference between a tamed creature and a wild one, so they kill both. Same will be with human NPC and another player.
---
I assume this is a joke post ? 
---
Awesome. I appreciate it! I‚Äôll send you a PM to set up a time.
---
I haven't found any in fallout 76 yet but in fallout 4 I recall hiding on top of a building once when I was low level from 3 of then, and staying there for a good chunk of time until my danger bar have cycled through 4 caution to dangers changes and finally into hidden, but then finding the same pack of scorpions in hangman's alley (the closest settlement to where I was plus my home base at the time) and everyone was either dead, lying on the floor hurt or hiding on the upper floors. 
---
So if anything like what I described is similar to what they are in 76, then they're terrifying still. 
---
Ive had 6 show up. It was a defend your camp event plus several random ones were nearby and it was non stop bagels from the sky. 
---
&gt; get yourself some tea.
---
I could get a shower and walk the dog with how long it took to fly from Teledrassil to Tanaris. At least they have since streamlined it a bit. 
---
Anyone who disagrees, that thinks we should not have pve servers where PvP is completely disabled, are the kind of people that do everything they can to force people to PvP anyway. 
---
I honestly don't know why people do but in all honesty lets just treat them with what they are. Raiders. Also if your camped near an area everyone goes to your more likely to be raided just warning you.
---
Yeah screw those guys playing the game in a way that the developers allow and intended to be allowed. They need to be *punished* and taught how to *act right* as dictated by what you think the game should be.
---
The dragon analogy would work, but dragons actually gave something useful so it's usually worth it to fight them until you have 200 dragon bones sitting in your house. With Scorchbeasts you're essentially forced to waste a butt-load of ammo and a few stim-packs for a bit of exp and some food.
---
So... Overwatch? Fortnite? Quake Arena? Apex? The answer is let's add *another* crappy battle royale game to the mix?
---
the sad thing is when they throw interesting objects for a limited time like the black color of the x-01 
---
Yeah that would be all well and good but did ya miss the part of being up and out of range and having to use a long range rifle?
---
My shotgun doesnt/didnt have the range to hit it..
---
no.
---
Don't take workshops. Taking a workshop turns on pvp. If you dont want pvp, dont take workshops. 
---
I know but in a squirt gun would be cool. Run around curing people in squirt gun battles lol
---
Yes, I'm going to move :( I like where I'm at, but I can see it's just not working out. And what's there to raid tho? Not like they win loot or can steak things. 
---
As a mostly solo player, this is going to suck when I get to her. :p
---
I actually explored this place about 6 years ago. It's huge and there is so much to see in it for example old medicine bottles, hospital beds, weelshairs even old syringes (made completely out of glass). Really cool place sad that's it's mostly looted now. 
---
Feels like d√©j√† vu lol 
---
That about sums it up.
---
I hate legendary wood armor. That might be worse.
---
I wish that if you have pacifist mode enabled, your C.A.M.P. would be protected against PVP. I stay in pacifist and have people destroying my C.AM.P. all the time so I just server jump to avoid it. 
---
Yeah with the PvP servers coming I think they should seriously consider making the rest of the servers PvE only, for the team co-op players and lone wanderers. They could cater the events on those servers to co-op and single person play.
---
What I mean is... on the PvE servers when you start an event that runs in an indoor cell and can be instanced to you or your team it should allow you to lock it from others joining (if they come to the event they get their own separate instance of it rather than dropping into yours). Sometimes people have different play styles or they do events for different reasons (legendary farming, certain materials, kill XP) and it would be nice to be able to avoid those people for the sake of making it better for both parties. With outdoor events I get that this wouldn't be possible  because of shared cell space. Some events would be ideal for this though (looking at you Uranium Fever).
---
Can someone tell me wtf is the point in buying a PvP game when you never want to PvP or be PvP'd?
---
As much as I agree with the OP, that people really should move on to other games (you're simply missing out on something better anyway) I also think people should be complaining about shitty practices and poorly made games because each time somebody does it makes Todd Howard cry just like baby Jesus did when Todd decided to rip us all off over Christmas. 
---
It also lets everyone know what a poorly made game this is.
---
Most of them won‚Äôt pvp because then they would probably get slaughtered that kind just wants to be a dick sad but true
---
Hopefully we get them back one day
---
It doesn't if you're going from the premise of *everyone* is springing from the same source like FO76 does. There needs to be *other* vaults opening and factional competition for resources to make it make sense.
---
I have a camp right by watoga station. Looks like a big BoS camp. I've had my camp there for about a week. No one has ever tried to screw with my camp. ü§∑
---
Let‚Äôs be real here. Loot based games will never be balanced for PvP. It just doesn‚Äôt work. Because with every loot based game or FPS or RPG that doesn‚Äôt have separate PvE and PvP balancing (which seems to be all of them) majority of the nerfs are done to appease the PvP crowd. Which is why I‚Äôm glad games like Warframe and Anthem don‚Äôt care about PvP. 
---
Also Anthem is third person by the way. 
---
and for new Atom shop items.
---
I've never completed original Fallouts.
---
OMG! There ARE others like me! 
---
I see your point.  But is 12 DR really much?
---
For now though, I'm just trying to find the BOS Leg plan and then get Deep Pocketed for arms and legs before I even bother switching to Heavy Combat limbs.  Going to have to spend some time farming Mire and Bog armor mod plan spawn locations.  Doesn't look like BOS mod plans are available at any vendors anymore.  Deep pocketed either...  farming so much plastic to craft/scrap combat armor and try to get the Deep Pocketed mods.  I think I have received everything except Pocketed/Deep Pocketed so far on Combat Armor.
---
Theory: It's to encourage friending people on servers, and joining servers with your friends, so you can re-join them afterward.
---
So whats happens in the game right now if two people try to pick up the same item at the same time?
---
Except fix the dumb story thing far cry 5 did. You can‚Äôt progress in your story while playing with a friend in farvry 5. You have to do it all over again. 
---
I've never said hi to you
---
I've got well over 200 hours. 100 hours of that is load screens though. 
---
Radscorpions are so rare in this game.  In the original they popped up most of the time you fast travelled anywhere, and were second only to Deathclaws in danger.  
---
I miss'em.
---
This seems like such a contradictory post.
---
&gt;It's a lot of fun to take your time and explore at a good pace, it just makes you want to play more.
---
But don't play so much guys! Even if playing the game makes you want to play it more.
---
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even sell nothing‚Äù
---
Was just the most yokel yee haw way to put it. 
---
The mission description states you should take 8+ players. 
---
Oh god, I didn't know that
---
There was probably a sale that you missed
---
i wish i had thought the queen with the weapons i have currently because there are really effective right now expecaliy sence my guass rifle has 50% anti Armour explosive legendary effect and 250% damage resistance when reloading plus a non legendary perforating capacitor that increases Armour piercing to 40%  
---
How about you go play the game instead of whining about it on here. ? 28 day old account with over 2500 karma ? 
---
I believe the term is "shitpost"
---
Yes it does because I just found another and my ammo weights are 0 for most, though wearing armor changes it but can be taken count for if you get calibrated shocks for your armor build. If you can't buy the random mods appearance for 853 caps you can go to watoga super duper vendor and get them for 6500 caps each but they are guaranteed to have them since the update. That vendor has all power armor mod plans
---
Considerably better is a stretch 
---
Is it a specific PvP game? Or an online FO game you can play with friends. 
---
If you are getting memory leaks and lots of glitches it could be because you have an unstable mem oc (I did)
---
I know some people do the power plant and get fusion cores that way but just walking around exploring no generator ever had one anymore 
---
Truth be told I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing so if they put out more items I actually wanted/gave my Atoms more value. 18 dollars for an ugly power armor skin is not something I want to drop money on. So for the time being I just grind dailies and weeklies to save up for stuff I want.
---
You can finally unlock a woman's heart.
---
I want a guard doggo
---
I actually had very high hopes that this game would be a significant step forward for sandbox games, because PvP is always an issue with them. You don't want to completely forbid PvP because if there is no possibility of a fight at all it takes away a lot of the depth of possible interactions between players, but you also don't want people to play the game purely to attack other players because that winds up driving a huge number of people away. They had some good ideas with this game. The slap damage, the fact that bounties are paid out of the wanted person's account, all of those are significant advancements over other open world games.
---
I'm level 260ish, and i don't complain about being bored. I get on after work when i can, and just kill shit. 
---
Another 50 in the PipBoy and managing inventory.
---
What we need is more pve content, like some kind of dungeon or raid that requires a team. Right now there is little incentive to form teams!
---
I'm waiting for an enterprising modder to roll the multiplayer changes of 76 into  Fallout 4 and make Fallout 4 co-op playable on a private server. They already modded 50% of the other features into 4. It's only a matter of time I think.
---
Played since beta and I have been attacked 4 times now, each fight lasted no more than a couple seconds.  Base is at one of the most common spots in the game and has never been attacked.  We already have 99.9% PvE servers.  They won't do it, the Pvp has been an embarrassment for the dev, they keep trying to push that aspect of it.
---
That's all I've ever wanted from a fallout game! Just to be able to play the normal game but with my friends! I hope the next fallout will have this feature! 
---
They're stealing your caps too.  But the real motive is just the joy found in that false sense of superiority.  Of course some will justify it as forcing devs to fix the game but that BS is completely transparent.
---
Low damage high attack rate weapons suck.
---
The armor system in this game dramatically favors burst damage to an almost comical degree.
---
The ratio of damage to armor determines final damage, and as all enemies have a ton of armor any weapon dealing less than 200 damage per shot is going to be heavily gimped in terms of damage, not 20, TWO HUNDRED is the critical mass where a weapon's damage starts taking a heavy drop against enemy armor, weapons like the minigun are straight terrible, having their damage reduced by a factor of around 7, while a super sledge in it's base form is dealing around a third of it's damage, but with perks can easily reach the point where it does the majority of the actual damage listed while the minigun almost crawls to 1/4.
---
I did the math, against 100 armor a gatling gun needs only 47 bullets to out-damage a minigun's full 500, that is how big a difference 79 damage makes against 14, a factor of 10.6 rounds to one for a damage difference of 7.5.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
There is a handy chart at the side that shows how shafted a low damage weapon gets, with a 25 damage weapon suffering a 70% loss of damage against a target where a 250 damage weapon only loses 30%, meaning the 25 damage weapon has to hit &gt;23 times to do the same damage, and a 10 damage weapon has to hit 80 times, dealing a theoretical 800 damage to match 250.
---
ALPHA is king
---
food for though, a high level super mutant has 178 armor, so when I say 100 armor, I'm talking mid game trash here or assuming you have decent armor piercing.
---
Armor needs a rework in this game, badly, or at the very least the devs need to understand what armor means for weapon balance. They give higher level enemies more and more armor like a second health bar, making them exponentially stronger and demanding higher and higher alpha strike damage to overcome these higher and higher resistances, if all guns did the same damage per shot this wouldn't matter, but there are weapons like the minigun that struggle against the armor of level 10 enemies but can't be acquired before level 35, as if it is supposed to scratch even lightly armored end game threats, lightly armored in this context being 100 or so armor on the shirtless scorched who are the lowest armor enemies at any particular level, super mutants approach 200 armor, and some of the top end enemies can close in on 300 armor at the top end. Remember, 14 armor is all that is needed to cut a minigun's damage in half, so even giving it 95% armor penetration wouldn't matter.
---
Then there are energy weapons, that don't get armor piercing, have lower alpha damage to compensate the fact that "most enemies are vulnerable to energy damage" as the devs seam to operate, in spite of the fact energy resistance across the board is HIGHER than physical, a honeybeast, which is "vulnerable" to fire and cryo (energy damage) has 132 armor, and 150 energy resistance, those super mutants with 178 armor, they have 300 energy resist. If energy weapons had double the damage output of their normal counterpart they would only be about the same, and in many cases still far worse. Remember, there is nor armor piercing for energy weapons.
---
Yet, if you can put a weapon over the critical threshold of damage you can negate the armor system entirely. 
---
The problem is that it takes a lot to get over this threshold, and there is no reason for this threshold to even be a thing in the first place, it's just bad use of design.
---
Enemies can be challenging without any armor whatsoever, this type of enemy would require completely different tactics, mechanics, and weapons to deal with, but no such enemy exists because Bethesda decided to just give every enemy large amounts of armor without understanding the consequences of doing so. The minigun is a weapon that has a minimum level of 35, but is only good for killing level 10 and below enemies, yet Bethesda seams to think it would be useful and have so many in game references to it as something praise worthy when it is completely worthless.
---
If there was one enemy in the game who had no armor and a ton of health then the minigun would have a use, as it has the highest theoretical dps there is, it's just complete wank because the least armored enemy has 100 armor and it only takes 14 to cut it's damage in half.
---
If you took all the armor off a super mutant, and gave them 10x more hit points then a minigun would kill faster, while a super sledge would kill slower and both would end up about even.
---
The system also makes buffing weird, double a weapon's damage and you nearly quadruple it's effectiveness because you also end up halving armor, which is why explosives were so over the top powerful.
---
Honestly, all they need to do is make some enemies armored, and some not.
---
Give scorched 3 times more health and no armor, suddenly the minigun shreds through them, while big hitters take longer to kill.
---
There is no reason for every single enemy in the game to have heavy armor.
---
This system has many simillarities to New Vegas' armor system, low damage per shot struggles against anything with even a little bit of armor, but you had low health enemies with lots of armor, and high health enemies with no armor. Cazadors, the scourge of the desert had no armor, not even the legendary or the fearsom specimen 73, no armor whatsoever, 0, yet were still terrifying threats in the end game, and you really wanted a dps bullet hose firing hollow points to put them down fast. It's like if New Vagas put 15 extra armor on every enemy, suddenly most of the guns and ammo diversity of the game goes away, hollow points become worthless, every gun needs armor piercing ammo or bust, and the anti matteriel rifle becomes completely mandatory for dealing with most threats whose armor now crawls up into the 25-50 range requiring that full 110 base damage.
---
Enemies who are heavily armored should scale with level, if you make super mutants the "Heavy" humanoids, give the low level ones 80 armor, and scale that up over the levels to 160-180, adjusting health appropriately, enemies relying on armor should approximately double at high levels to match player weapon scaling. However enemies with little to no armor need the same scaling, if scorched have no armor at level 1 then they should still have little to no armor at level 68, I mean maybe 10 max, enemies should either have huge health low armor, high armor low health, or medium amounts of both.
---
Put an enemy in with 25 hitpoints and 10k armor, that's completely fine, put an enemy with 10k health and no armor, that's actually fine, don't make every enemy the exact same 175 +/-25 that completely wrecks specific weapons.
---
And make enemies with meaningful differences in resistances. 200 armor and 180 energy resist does not automagically make an enemy weak to energy weapons, especially considering energy weapons are on average worse than bullet guns by a larger margin than that minuscule armor difference. There was exactly one enemy in fallout 4 that was meaningfully weak to energy weapons, and only because of a misplaced decimal point. The enraged fog crawler, with 350 energy resist and an unrivalled 4000 armor, consider the morphs before had 250/300 and 300/350 and it's obvious it was meant to be exactly as boring as every other enemy in the game. This was the one interesting enemy, who's defenses made gameplay different,  that made energy weapons something you considered using for their effectiveness, and it was actually believe it or not slightly vulnerable to the minigun because it's armor was so over the top it came back around, because the game has a damage reduction cap, so when all weapons are doing 9% damage, the minigun having the highest base dps meant it actually started to be better than other guns when armor started climbing over 1400, meaning completely over the top armor can have interesting idiosyncrasies of it's own. But all enemies must far into a very narrow and mind numbingly boring range that ruins automatics and dramatically favors heavy hitters. 
---
I'm going to keep posting this where appropriate until the devs respond that they are aware the way they give out armor makes weapons completely imbalanced.
---
**Replyshare**
---
Same but my camp is in the hills and is surrounded by cliffs so no one can climb up the only way in is through a ravine. I got some open space so if anyone wants to build near my base just tell me
---
It is a game that was specifically advertised by Todd Howard as having an always-on PvP element where if someone wanted to slap you to death and level you shit they could.
---
IMO you can play both freaking ways. Why should I miss out on all the cool crap the FO world has to offer just cuz PvP is ONE option. They make a pacifist mode - correct? Why even bother if u cannot opt out of PvP. I understand when claiming a workshop, I get entering events. But to have random people just blow your crap up is annoying, tho must be satisfying to grievers. 
---
Ya just did bud
---
Yes it's $79.98 normally, includes a bunch of stuff you can't get at the vendors or atom shop. I wanted to get it as well but I bought the normal edition on Black Friday for $30.
---
I switch them.  If they're on, I off'em. And vice versa.

So far there are 3 of us

I found him while randomly exploring around in the Savage Divide.
---
For mine.. fast travel to watoga station. Look left. Huge base directly in front of you lol 
---
If you wanted opt-out PvP you should have voted with your wallet and not bought the game while the design direction was 'PvP On'.
---
Guess I missed that memo, stupid me thinking it was a fun way to FO with friends. 
---
Include username so people can add and find you. 
---
I just with they would put the damn lockpick skill under 1 card, sick of having to go through my cards to find each one, fair enough if they were next to each other but they aren't 
---
In fact they are rare, found a few my entire gameplay, I think one of the first times I went to The Top of The World I got a legendary one right at the entrance, in fact everytime I went there I used to get a legendary/crown spawn at the entrance, noticed that it wasn't the case last time I went there.
---
Of course, since most of my friends are playing on    console and I'm on PC.
---
With other good games coming out in 2019 the thought to revisit this game is a joke. This fan base will diminish with each new release in 2019. Its a lost cause, and a shame.
---
I'm pretty sure if there was a sale I would've known imma buy it off amazon right now as its 50 there with free shipping 
---
Great tip ty

And be sure to wear white on the days we spray them. üòé

Bloodied rifle build, or was able to get to the ground quick.
---
Only if they had more story to do. 
---
I also don't mind the lack of human NPCs. Perhaps the reason everyone loves Graham is that he is a rarity.  If the world was littered with NPCs, Graham would no longer be special.  He'd be just another Vendor,  As far as the lack of survivors, you also have to take account that the handful of people who would have survived suddenly found themselves in a world where EVERYTHING wants to kill them.  I mean, let's face it... if the BoS were wiped out in the onslaught, how could ordinary, every day people expect to survive?

Accepting random invites to a team? whats the worst that could happen?

lucky i not stupid and just server hoped and moved my camp to fix it with caps. 
---
Good point, I'll add it to my post!
---
Wouldn't surprise me. The game was developed by a new bethesda branch, they probably hired the cheapest people they could find and made Fallout 76 on a shoestring budget.
---
Despite the poor reviews, this mess has probably been absurdly lucrative.
---
"makes no sense" let's go ahead and look up crossbow attachments IRL shall we? 
---
Thanks for your input Ruggle. I can see your point. I don't attack back, I just leave the game and repair my camp. 
---
Why aren't they connected?  Give it time
---
Then name your post "how much is my coat worth?" 
---
I agree with you about the AI, but putting PvP in Fall Out out is like putting NASCAR racing in Skyrim, or going to McDonalds looking for a steak.
---
Fall Out is known for the post nuclear wasteland adventure, not quakeworld PvP. If I want to PvP, I'll buy a game designed around PvP. 
---
So ignoring them or blocking them literally does nothing, it's a slap in your face not theirs, had a guy with a power fist probably with armor penetration mods and perk cards, running what I'm expecting also bloodied or unyilding because this fucker almost killed me twice with his fast attack speed and "slap damage" blocked him and nothing happens it just made it so if could no longer see him on the map. I assume he couldn't see me either but he kept attacking me and I could not fast travel away. It's a poor system, if you block someone they should not be able to effect you and you should be able to see them on the map to avoid their assholery.
---
I think they didn't care about the skew and saw the cash cow that the battle royale games are and wanted in on that. They have to have known that co-op fallout was what was desperately wanted after all the cries about Fallout 4 not including it.
---
The problem with that is you have zero risk of workshops being taken over at that, so they would have to nerf the resource gains from them, AND you would end up with servers were some one owns ALL the workshops. 
---
Funny thing i did it got taken down twice for incorrect formatting and one for using vague words
---
I'm sure there are more of us. Sadly they are too busy enjoying the game to post on Reddit though. 
---
I also think that taking refuge inside a building should completely shield you from sonic attacks since the high frequencies should bounce off of a solid object such as a roof or wall. That also goes for that fly-over pissing thing they do. Their attacks seem to penetrate everything.
---
I‚Äôll tell you - a pvp mode, that‚Äôs it. They talked about opening other vaults, no news on that, or anything else. If you don‚Äôt find the game fun in its current state, I‚Äôd suggest you stay away
---
Well, what on earth is their to stick around for after going through one of the blandest RPG story's I've ever played? What kind of idiot is going to stick around for all the server disconnects, the bugs, the crap loot drops, the over done survival mechanic where you have to eat and drink at ridiculous rates to the moronic weight system where guns weigh 3 times their RL counter parts to absolute shit storage capacity and crap base building?
---
It's only the nutters that can't stop playing it that are left - everyone else, i.e., normal people, are moving on - what the hell is there to keep anyone playing? The SBQ battle 1000 times? It was crap the first time round and it doesn't get any better.
---
I don't understand how people are mystified this game *wouldn't* be dead in 6 months? There's some great parts to it but nothing to keep anyone there for long. I wonder what everyone does as it goes, run to the same locations and repeat the same things over and over and over and over....
---
And here I thought the robot factory one was unique.. 
---
Also since I don't know the game well, would a auto pistols build work with most into stealth and just have mostly intel and luck extra so crafting is easy. 
---
I'm not 100% sure on this but they may be achievements in game that destroying a certain number of camps earn you some atoms.
---
I know for certain tho there are achievements on ps4 to earn trophies tied to destroying camps and killing people so they may be doing it for that reason.
---
Otherwise they could be doing it because they are bored with a lack of new content, having grown tired of doing the same events again and again
---
Freezing seems to be an amd related issue.  Ever had similar issues around charleston station? 
---
Everyone has to start somewhere, if a player wants to imagine their character emerged from a group of Raiders skinned alive from a Super Mutant convoy then who are we to tell them they can't instigate PvP?
---
Because this is just good game design, working as intended and fun for everyone. /sarcasm
---
How long have you been playing? I've realized after the patches it's super hard to lvl at an accelerated rate, plus now I'm running from super mutants when there's 6 or more. 
---
One hundred percent km board with over servers.
---
I had a guy 100 lvls over me take.over my workshop. He one shotted me. Obviously.  I hit revenge by accident and didn't want to fight and lose again as I was lvl 11 at the time.  So just warped back home. And started scrapping and tinkering away and I checked my map and saw the guy between the workshop and my CAMP.  Didn't think much of it. 
---
Checked again about 30 seconds later and he was considerably closer. Close enough he could probably see my camp. 
---
I server hopped immediately. I'm not sure of his intentions but I really doubt he was coming over to apologize and give me.some screws. More likely coming to kill me again and fuck up my CAMP.
---
Nice try asshole. I hope he was disappointed when my camp flashed out of existence.  
---
The irony is not lost on me, lol.
---
Now, if they only gave me towns of NPC's to raid, pillage and otherwise do raider stuff too!
---
It‚Äôs like games randomly decide to screw stuff up for no reason. 
---
That actually makes a lot of sense, about the achievement. Oddly it makes me feel better. üòä
---
No.  This just started happening since the last patch.  Level 179 and never had this happen.  I even lowered resolution to medium and it still happened last night.
---
No problem.  Glad I could assist. 
---
there are even dev comments in some files somebody posted a while back where a dev added a comment about a cut quest because of rushed release
---
# 30 - I think having a minimum level to join the event would be the best thing.  Let's say a team launches a nuke, gets to the fissure and then starts "voting out" everyone who shows up, regardless of how high their level is.  SBQ is meant to bring players together, but I can see a voting system really being abused.
---
The answer is in the title... Game Stop.  Never buy games there 
---
I made my camp there yesterday as well! Sucks you can't replace the furniture and decor, but at least you don't need to worry about repairing every little thing. I made a small plot for my crops in the front. Just need to get Home Defender perk rank 2 so I can build better turrets.
---
Heck, that was me, too.  I wasn't very high level and I thought the Rose quest was meant for much higher.  But that was the only one I saw there.
---
I have seen some in Toxic Valley, and saw some during an event.  I've seen more Honey Beasts, though.
---
You can imagine whatever you want, but the game that Bethesda set up isn't that and the backstory they set up *doesn't* support PVP.
---
All of the griefers I've run into seem to prefer messing with low level folks. I almost never get engaged in PVP on my main, but my alts get fucked with a lot. 
---
Pacifist mode is flawed. The fact that you can still be killed with it on makes it meaningless. 
---
And don't get me started on the groups of jerks who like nothing more than to run around destroying people's camps. 
---
I was below the level cap for over 2 months just playing normally until I started farming whitesprings.   Before they patched the experience being wrong, I‚Äôd gain 4-5 levels each time I‚Äôd farm.  It can level you up quick like that.   
---
Xbox or a different console?
---
Maybe you should slow down and only play ten minutes a week. Then you'll have even more to look forward to! Maybe just sit by vault 76 a stare at the damn door so you don't consume too much content too quickly.
---
Ps4
---
Personally Raider or Griefer its all the same to me. It's not a negative, but a strength of the game making it interesting than if it was boring old AI.
---
I think people get too worked up about the PVP, expecting the apocalypse to be a more candy coated experience . Life is not fair, and the guy with the bigger gun usually is the winner. The main problem is not the raiders or griefers, but how dupping and the glitches ruined the economy and balance of the game. 
---
The white knights get a lot of praise with their gifting, and drops in trader posts. We also have to give as much thanks to the arsehats and the raiders, as otherwise what a boring apocalypse it would be! 
---
I salute you Raiders and Griefers, and long may you challenge us for the the wilds lands of Appalachia!

I ran into a lvl 245 last night. Nice bloke, he sold me my Prime Gatling Gun Receiver! That being said, I've played since Beta (October) and am only lvl 105. That's taken over 350 hours (between my character and my son's). But I enjoy playing it slowly and savoring my journey. No fun to rush through everything imo. Hell there were quite a few lvl 100+'s just from the time in the beta. Don't see how that could've been fun. But different strokes for different folks I guess.
---
Actually I was planning on price matching with best buy so I get some off.
---
I've gotten two pies already. Must be lucky. 
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IDLGUO7zXk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2854) is the 'memo' or insight into what the developers were thinking for FO76. The video game market is very 'next big thing' right now. Fortnite selling well? What bits of that can we add to our game? DayZ doing good? Ok what pieces of that fit in our game? The taglines from years ago don't really give any idea of what a game will be like anymore. 'Fallout with friends', 'Skyrim in space', these sound cool but don't give any idea what the developers and designers are thinking about for a game's *content*. Unless you are buying a game explicitly for the franchise branding then E3, Quakecon, etc are where you need to look for how a game will play.
---
Indeed.  I have to wonder just how much this happens to people, or how much they're really, really exaggerating it.  
---
I've been griefed once.  A guy trashed my base who was 100 level higher than me.  Otherwise my experience with others is usually during events we show up at, Nukes and me popping in to defend their workshops.
---
Actually I was planning on price matching with best buy so I get some off with membership etc and I got a 10$ certificate
---
I like the PvP aspects of the game but they should be more fleshed out and the should have separate servers for PvP and PvE.
---
IMO,   
---
Chems/drugs/bobbleheads/magazine should not stack.  
---
It's darkvampireking. Ammo is what's needed now
---
Wow didn't realize that about Anthem.  And yes totally agree with you there - anything loot based won't work.  I thought Anthem was closer to Battlefield but haven't kept up...  ie. weapon unlocks over time, but not loot based.
---
There's other games like Mass Effect that did coop PvE because it was a better model for those games.  Wish Bethesda wouldn't have tried to copy Fortnite so badly.
---
I'm that dude down on the greens.  Got 12 water purifiers, a workshop and all the food you can eat.
---
Stop by.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and I think I‚Äôve only met one player who even wanted to fight so far. And really he just kept following me doing an emote to get me to fight and occasionally shooting a TSE shotgun at objects in front of me to get my attention. He gave up pretty fast tho. Base is in the sticks far away from all the player hotspots and that‚Äôs been left alone too.
---
Ahaha preying on poor settlements?! I the Mechanist and my army of robots shall stop you!
---
I mean they could introduce NPC and have a lvl 200 raider mini nuke your camp? Most my team is gone now and the remainder talk about donning raider power armor to attack groups we find but I always keep a ton of caps and high-level scrap so if you beat me you get set for a while. I mainly use weapons that do 50-120 damage to give you a chance and if they pull out a ton of turrets or hide but shoot back from in their camp I use my two shot fat man. 
---
After this many bug fixes, they reintroduced bugs that they had apparently fixed...
---
Look at that post.

When i was working on a mod for arma, i had a buddy that would only test with admin tools. literally did not understand why the players were complaining that loot was broken in it. 
---
he also didnt use docker, wouldnt update install notes and could push his changes to git so that might have played into it.

Roleplay: excessive fossil fuel consumption in the fo universe created global climate change much worse than our own, causing global average temperatures to rise and snow becoming a rare occurance.
---
No, it cures diseases. 
---
Definitely agree.  I own FNV and FO4 on PC and Xbox.  But nothing beats playing fallout on a couch with a controller. I also play competitive PC FPS games.  I am a high gold on R6 and have played CSGO.
---
Nice PC specs btw.  Is your monitor 1440p/144hz?  I'm needing to upgrade mine which is 144hz/1080p/21.5inch.  Heard from many people 28inch/1440p/144hz is the sweetspot.  I would like proper color grading for my work but can't have everything!
---
Of you run out of the zone till it says "You are leaving the battle" or w/e the fuck it says they despawn.
---
Yeah don't worry, I am a solo player myself and when I launched a nuke most of the server jumped in to help with sbq
---
I'm more wondering how you got that far without having 3-4 scorchbeasts screaming at you.
---
I haven't seen this post, but this makes sense. Zenimax rather screw over the Fallout IP to make a quick buck and release  this buggy mess without any QA. 
---
Traveling leather coat? Is that the in game name? 
---
I'm on PC, but thanks for the offer and advice!
---
Yeah
---
I PvP‚Äôd some lower level players for the achievements then never bothered again. I even sent each of them an apology afterwards 
---
With the ammo smith perk it isn't *too* expensive to make. 
---
Yes!  There's NO meaningful PvP in this game...  its not a skills based PvP system, any half balanced encounters are just by chance that neither side has optimized their build/gear.
---
Yes you just wait for the bar to go back up, intentionally lose the workshop to them and they are stuck in PvP with you and your team until you kill each other.
---
Whoever clicks it first gets it but if there are multiple options that changes the dynamic 
---
One of'em downvoted you.  I fight back.  Because you're absolutely spot on with this comment.
---
Since it came out. I grinded whitesprings quite a bit when the xp was good. I still lvl at an alright rate. I don't have any issues with groups of enemies, i welcome it for the xp. I mostly just grind certain areas now.
---
its so low it must be 0%
---
Scrapped hundreds of them, nothing so far, ended up server hopping to buy the scour armor mods from modus, have full Polymer Ultra-light now.
---
Open, lawless, nuclear waste landscape, littered with horrors, drugs, and mutated food and cereal made from twinkies. Where mankind crawls from a hole in a rock and mutates from Ghoulish wounds and irradiated exposure.
---
If a stranger armed with a pipe or an assualt rifle approaches me, with weapon drawn... bang bang.
---
honestly 90% of real griefing I've seen comes from angry adults who take their rage out on others most of the kids I've seen in those consoles are more haha I shoot you and run off not really what I'd call griefing more mild annoyance at best 
---
&gt;most of it is from asshats anyway who have nothing better to do than just mess with others game because they are bored.
---
Or need validation in their life
---
Yep, stash un-used ones.. it works!
---
Yeah it's not like there are anti grief measures built into the game that people do everything they can to bypass 
---
Sorry your wrong please get your facts straight this isnt a PVP focused game LOL Before you start putting peoples concerns down and talking bs learn about the game you so egotistically comment on. What PVP centered game has a slap mechanic in it lol. Yea lets see rust implement a slap mechanic. I hate people that swear they know everything and criticize people when they are only putting forward their interpretation of what facts are. FO76 is a online version of Fallout with pvp elements its not a full out PVP game.
---
Isn't fallout predicated on fossil fuels not being a primary source of energy, hence all the nuclear stuff?
---
Not had this issue on other games but thanks for the advice as it may be a possibility.  I would be lying if I said I haven't OC'd my memory and not encountered general boot issues in the past.  Took me a while to tweak but now 6 months ok (touch wood).
---
Just make a game of it. Try and find such an out of the way place that they cant find you. 
---
How is this even possible!
---
Because when you develop software you pull from the list of stuff "todo" and if no one adds "add rejoin last server button to gui" then none of the developers will do it, even if they want to... thats stuff in software development with project managers 
---
What if, instead of the current plan of buying a game and then demanding a change to the design philosophy afterwards...people don't buy games that aren't what they want?
---
&gt;It would do a lot to alleviate griefing, since by going into the PVP server, you know what you're signing up for.
---
You should know that anyway based on how the game was explained pre-launch. Anyone playing Fallout 76 and complaining about PvP are exactly the same as people playing Fallout 76 and complaining about no human NPCs. The developers **said** that would be the case, and now people are surprised that is the case, or hate that it is the case despite buying the game knowing that is the case.
---
Likely even if there were more content the kids would still be griefing. Once the newness wears away the kids will leave and it will be better.
---
And while we are at it the LMG is way to OP too. Nerf it by like 90% to balance it
---
I would not buy it at this point.
---
I love fallout and played the hell out of this game when it dropped but there just isn‚Äôt anything redeeming enough to keep me coming back.
---
Rent it first if possible.
---
I preferred the bug where bulk junk doesn't scrap when crafting over the bulk junk scrapping to scrap all
---
If you bought 76 and played before xmas, you can get them for free.   Requirements are a PC and to install the Beth launcher.
---
It was also probably to help discourage farming servers for things that spawn on connection. 
---
There's one near V76. You can't pick it up but maybe you can camp next to it?
---
Everyones loves Graham, because he is something different - he speaks, he sells (rare stuff btw), he roams, he's a mutant with a cow, hard to find.

True, almost got my ass whooped, but I managed to keep jumping from one side of these sandbags to another and killed him after a lot of shots while he was confused LOL.
---
only the us moved on to advanced nuclear tech after fossil fuels started to run out, so rest assured plenty of fossils are burned
---
No offense taken. I run 2 small companies. Actually they run themselves. I play a lot as I've earned it. I've been playing games since Pong and Space invaders. Lots of people play for long amounts of time daily. I think your in the minority. It's Winter here now. Come Summer I'm always out enjoying life. I Love gaming in Winter.

Might as well be single player I can never get people to accept team invites
---
There are a number of reasons why people want private servers:
---
Some people want to play with people who they know are not cheating for example, or have a community standard. 
---
Others want to only play with their friends (or solo play). 
---
Online survival games like this generally leave mods to private servers, public servers are unmodded. 
---
Private servers can be set to persistent worlds, where my base doesn't despawn when I log out, crash, or lose connection. This can solve some issues with bases glitching out.
---
Some people just have heard private servers are better, and so are advocating for them without knowing what they are talking about.
---
There are Pros and Cons for private servers, but as a former ARK player, a Minecraft server owner, a DayZ mod server owner, and online gamer I will say that the decision not to include private servers is a reason I did not and will not purchase this game. (Found this post while googling a FO4 glitch for the record.)
---
Post Patch 5 I was re-taking a workshop for something to do and was one-shotted by some guy who fast traveled there in PA. 
---
I don't actually care because I don't care about running and keeping workshops and I only lost two cloths as junk, but as a level 81 with the best armor I've been able to get in the game, I'd say getting killed in one shot by a level 150-something isn't balanced PVP.
---
In your server??
---
where the fuck is this? ive been to the gazebo by the tennis courts and i cant find it
---
yeah the only time I've pvped really is with my friends as we try tactics and idea 
---
like I was talking to my friend and he can basically 1 hit me in his power armor melee build (instigator super sledge) so I dropped a pulse mine as he charged he triggered it and boom no more power armor guy (no perks 90% dmg to power armor - I have perks) 
---
that said scorch beasts are more annoying to me then players I just leave pacifist on so I don't accidentally blow someone up since I use grenades heavily since the missile launcher is useless as even a two shot guided missile version basically does minimal damage to a scorch beast 
---
Seriously, since we're gonna soon have a new PvP survival mode, why not making the normal mode totally disable PvP? Those who want to play serious PvP would play the new survival mode and the griefers would stay in the normal mode to spoil PvEers' fun as always.
---
So basically, re-engineer almost the entire game and double the amount of servers having to run PVP only instances in a game that's barely 3 months old and is already on sale with a dropping player base from a multi-national corporation who's main concern is making money for their shareholders.
---
Who's going to pay for the development time for all of this? It's been 3 months and they can't even double the paltry loot box size.
---
I saw a couple accordions, they weren't playable.
---
Souls games are straight RPGs with badass PvP. 
---
"We didn't license that wouldn't it be nice to stay together song just for you to play solo!"
---
Tricentennial isnt that worth it (I got it), especially now that the "B.E.T.A." is over... but as many would say that was the alpha.
---
You get a PA paint, paint for a laser pistol and a hatchet(?), and an uncle sam vaultboy outfit. 
---
Id just get the standard version for whatever they are selling it for these days
---
Or, you know, you could go to another server. Contrary to what you may think, you are not the center of the universe.
---
Fallout 76 has 'always-on PvP'. Fallout 76 was always supposed to have 'always-on PvP'.
---
Just because the PvP is shit does not mean it isn't a PvP game. There is no dedicated PvE platform and there was never supposed to be. If you don't want PvP there is no accommodation for you in Fallout 76, and there was never supposed to be.
---
It has to be.
---
Derp.  I forgot that you can't sell plans.  I really shouldn't have, considering I used to curse having so many and felt like they went to waste when I would leave them in areas for people to find.  Guess I got too excited.  Been wanting to build my little house in the sky out of brick, and now I can finally do so.
---
Just wait.    
---
I'm on the last quest for the main questline and have been barely two months after it come out. My local Best Buy has 16 XBox 1 PA Editions that have been sitting on the higher up shelves since release. Every time I've been inside I check out that area to see if anything has changed. They've just accumulated more dust.    
---
BGS made a lot of mistakes with this. Outside of that, dupers and hackers are consistently ruining the game.
---
Yup. I'm here because I like to laugh at all you crybabies. Scorchbeasts die in 4-5 seconds to me. I take around 1/3 hp off SBQ in 4-5 seconds even with 10 other players there boosting SBQ resistances. Learn how to build your character properly, that is all. 
---
I may be a minority here but I think there is a difference between someone who is actually a griefer and people just attacking bases. If someone just hits your base and moves on that's a raider. If the person is making a point to single one person out and destroy there stuff multiple times then that a griefer. That's how I feel anyways. The game allows people to attacks bases and there is even a perk for it. There shouldn't be a punishment for them playing the game.
---
Pump the brakes a little before you judge. I'm honestly new to reddit and only joined because I kept reading good stuff and info on here about FO76. So I wanted to join the conversation big deal. I don't see what's wrong with that. BTW I love reddit the people here are amazing. Even the asshat who posted the above comment I have no hate towards you despite your trolling tendecies.
---
So is that karma low or high? Nvm IDK or care I just like FO76 (for the most part) and enjoy posting about it and commenting I couldn't care less about Karma.... Or what you think. Karma isn't going to buy my groceries.
---
I've also enjoyed reading and posting stuff about other games. Reddit is a fun place to read up on games and whatnot and I have no shame in liking it. 
---
/s man, /s.
---
Also, how cool would it be to play the guitar sword, death tambo (tambourine) and war drum?
---
Yep and at Whitesprings they sell all building plans so metal/barn too
---
yes. Because I am able to play the game as if it was a single player fallout, sneaking through the world for hours, exploring every bit of the map and ignoring objectives. 
---
but there was that one time where I was killed and tea bagged by another player that was infuriating. but that's a couple of months ago.
---
here's the line I meant "  Due to time constraints for this first pass, however, that'll be added later. "
---
from this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahyv35/datamined\_information\_regarding\_future\_cut\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahyv35/datamined_information_regarding_future_cut_and/) it contains all kind of stuff that could have been if they had a bit more time....also apparently there was an idea for the players to get something for Christmas...which was cut too obviously...
---
It's more how useful is the 120 ER anyways. 
---
What's the average damage of an energy attack anyways, I am gonna throw down 50, per hit
---
250 energy resist gives 72% reduction in damage, if you were to double your ER to 500 you would get up to 78%
---
so against a vast majority of attacks you only really stand to gain 3-4%, dropping damage per hit from 14 to 12, which is certainly good, but against an attack that is much stronger, you stand to gain a lot more damage reduction for a much lower gain in armor, and when there are enemies throwing out 200+ damage per hit physical attacks gaining an extra 12 armor can be if not more, then at least as impactful as a much larger energy resistance.
---
Now, all it takes to turn this line of thinking on it's head is one reasonably common enemy that throws out high impact energy attacks, scorchbeasts would fit that bill if it weren't for the fact their energy attack is explosive, and having explosive resistance &gt; energy resistance, because the explosive resistance effects are so much more powerful, and even still, the scream isn't that damaging per hit, it's more the spam factor
---
Players who PvP tend to be unlikable.
---
No problem! (I think I was really tired when I made that comment, and I don't work well when I'm tired.
---
It's not related to radworms. Happened to me right after log in, and later right after I fast traveled. Neither time with any diseases.
---
I'll bring you a bunch of .38 rounds.
---
Put it this way Ruggle has been on reddit for 7 years and has 12,500 karma. I have been on here for twice as long as you and I have around 400. 
---
You are weak, like a capitalist slave
---
probably to assert their dominance because they‚Äôre lacking in other aspects of their lives. then again, you‚Äôre probably generally lacking in your life if you‚Äôre still wasting your time on this shitty awful game. if nobody played it, bethesda would be forced to remake the whole game. but naw yall wanna keep spending $20 on a fucking power armor camo..
---
I have this feeling as well.  If they wanted us to PVP more then having us join warring factions would seem to be the most logical way to implement it.
---
Sure we all came from the same vault as neighbors and friends, but we all may have different philosophies on how we should rebuild.
---
Factions follow different ideal on how society should be after ‚ÄòThe Great War‚Äô.  Capturing and holding resource points (workshops) for your faction increases rewards globally for those faction members.
---
Now we would have a reason to fight over workshops other than for being either selfish or a prick.
---
The PVP element would still need to be balanced out.  This game has great potential if it had been given more thought and more time for development.
---
Players will wait for a game that is delayed especially if that delay means we get a better game.
---
Do you want them to fix the game? If so it needs support.  If not they may just scrap it and leave it as is. I would rather them fix it over time then not at all. 
---
I'm down with this
---
I played with 2 other friends and we put in over 200 hours and we got pretty much the same crap - low level armour not even worth picking up. Even if you get the legendaries though, what game play is there to continue with? 
---
I realize that. I'm not blaming the devs, rather the management at Bethesda. 
---
It took me a good while to get to 50 playing solo, taking my sweet ass time, but once I started teaming up, and doing events things moved much quicker at least up until the last major patch that slowed everything down.
---
I could easily go up 2-3 levels in 3-4 hours depending on the events done, blast zone activity etc. That is definitely not the case anymore.
---
Shit, just doing scortched earth that lasts more than 15-20 minutes requires 4 or so hours of scrounging material to make ammo and repair guns/armor. That stops progress in it's tracks.  
---
Raider players already think about killing mail bot and stealing your loot.
---
1,073,741,793ish
---
I don't feel like pvp works at all in fo76. As soon as you introduce two shot, exploding ammunition, 10% more damage, blah blah blah the pvp breaks down. This would of worked better as a Destiny style, fighting factions in specific areas with possible ownership rotation. 
---
Because all us vats players would go like this; bang into vats, hit analog once, aim head kill, gun fu swap, hit analog right once, kill headshot, rince repeat. Imagine now you're fighting a mirelurk, a robot and a scorched. Robots need to be hit torso/back, scorched head and mirelurks anyway front part of their body. Now imagine you bust aimed for the scorched and gun fu throws the robot at you, you have to look which fking part of the body the game decided itself to throw at you, tap as many times on the analog as necessary to hit a part thats not unreachable and then kill, switching back to the mirelurk which needs to be targeted in front, repeating the whole process. Its fucking horrendous. 
---
I think it would have been better to start as co-op and then add PvP enabled servers later when they were ready.
---
I think the nerf worked well. It made me feel like I actually needed to run perks for the weapon.  Befor I could one shot thinks with the tse pump with no perks now it feels really weak. I'm glad they nerfed them because now I feel like my perks matter.
---
Trust me, PvP is not the source of any angst.
---
The lack of effort (storyline sucks, quests suck, still left in explosive rounds issues like shotgun, re-used textures, re-used animations, re-used UI etc).
---
Lack of good public relations (lied about canvas bag, false advertisement on beta times, false advertisement on things you can do)
---
Base game issues out of the box (the only end game is queen and that event is horrible, barely works, and unrewarding.  People still zip around with high fps, textures are re-skinned and still show old models)
---
Then the fun factor.  End game does not exist.  Sit in a murky puddle for 5 minutes, get all mutations, call it a year.
---
Yeah dude exactly. A 28 inch, 1440p, 144hz. Sadly it is a TN panel so it doesn't have as good color accuracy as an oled, LED, or LCD. BUT, gaming Wise it's great and the colors are by no means bad. 
---
It really is the sweet spot and I got it cheap, imo, on Dell for $270. 
---
Not all games can handle it though so there's definitely room to upgrade my gpu in the future. Maybe around the 3rd rtx generation. But hopefully by then 4k 144 might be viable. 
---
I bet your monitor treats csgo perfect sounds nice. 
---
I can never go back to 60 lol, u too?
---
Like I said, you can imagine what you want. But in the game that Bethesda set up, *none* of the humans wandering around are strangers to you. In a very literal sense. Because you *all* just spent the last 25 years in the *same* "hole in a rock".
---
Hey, who said I had to leave to survive in Fallout 4???
---
Do you have access to the algorithm?
---
I genuinely don't think they care.  They should already have access to all the statistics and can tell how many players bother with PvP.  I suspect it's a very small minority of players, but BGS chose to prioritize appeasing them above all of us who enjoy PvE and would like more quests, events, and general endgame content.  It was a very deliberate choice, either an ill-fated attempt to capture the Fortnite crowd, or a cynical excuse to not create more PvE content in the long run (go shoot each other, you don't need us to make quests for you).
---
Absolutely. I imagined this game taking a more Borderlands approach/identity. Where one person hosts and controls the state of the world/story progress. 
---
Everyone look out, Grognak has been taken over by the Commie-Kaze!
---
Relatively only an extremely small amount of players come on the Fallout subreddit, so this won't accomplish much even if people did do it, but I agree with the sentiment.
---
This is the most frustrating aspect.  If you get disconnected or even log out gracefully, the server should hold your reservation for reconnection for another 30 minutes in case you log back in.  
---
I'd be ok with random server selection after that 30 minute period, but it would at least solve the most aggravating issue.  I can't wrap my head around why this seemingly-simple database operation isn't possible on their end.
---
whether a pvp element if on always or sometimes doesnt make a difference if there is a slap mechanic in place its not a PVP focused game period only games that have a slap mechanic are rpg's and MMO's
---
No. PvP servers don't, in any way, negatively affect the game. I don't PvP at all now, but I would be willing to try it on a server dedicated to it, where you know everyone is a willing participant.
---
Anyone who compares 76 to fortnite has either never played fortnite or never played 76, or both.
---
Thanks for posting here. Im glad you're having a good time and hope you continue to. 
---
I'm on ryzen and thought that I was stable by simply enabling the xmp profile, but it turns out that my Mobo was not reading the secondary timings and auto timings were buggy.
---
What worked for me was manually entering all of timings from the xmp profile (primary and secondary).
---
Devs who quite obviously have never played a PVP game in their life. Anyone who's played a serious amount of PVP knows Bethesda don't play PVP games making them out of touch and clueless about gaming. 
---
You'd think games company's would have learned this simple fact by now - get input from actual gamers, it might help your game.
---
Thanks guys standard 's like 40 online rn so I'll make sure to get it :D!
---
How dare you enjoy games differently than I do.
---
I think it's really just random.  I've only dealt with legit griefers twice including the beta and I'm on PS4.  Most of the time when I'm on I hardly ever see bounties above 10-15 caps.  In fact the only real frustration I've had with other players comes from people being dicks at Whitesprings during nuke zones.
---
CSGO is perfect on it indeed.  On PC going to 60 makes my head spin when turning lol.  Thanks for the advice!
---
I personally know a lot of people waiting for pvp to come back because right now you can't pvp
---
PVP would work but only if people joined factions such as raiders and they showed on the map as such. As it stands there isn‚Äôt the infrastructure or even the basic laws for pvp to work
---
Happy pie day.
---
Not true for PA and normal armor i'm afraid. You can get ultra light or deep pocketed without purchasing the previous ones
---
Solo here too - you‚Äôll be fine. Once someone drops a nuke at fissure prime there will be at least 8 players there all fighting the SBQ
---
Once I finish hacking terminals for the last trophy I‚Äôm out. I had fun for a while, but it‚Äôs worn off and I have no plans to come back no matter what happens. I was fortunate enough to play without a lot of the bugs I read about here and had fun, but Bethesda has made a bad situation worse with these patches that nerf good things and create more bugs than they fix, I don‚Äôt know how a company that‚Äôs been doing this so long can suck so bad, what a shame to see this go down the crapper. üòî
---
Understood. And well, I certainly I hope I am in the minority of people who play games as if they were jobs.  Congratulations on your business success.
---
Just walk up to it and you'll get an on-screen prompt to "activate." I think it's the A button on XB to turn on or off.
---
bout tree fiddy
---
2 of the same should not stack, 2 different drugs, should absolutely stack.
---
Outer Worlds seems a little far away. Anthem and Division 2, though I will mention them in that light, I really don't see myself getting them unless there is something exceptional about them from some early gameplay or beta videos/streams. I have Resident Evil 2 which I am playing on and off right now and enjoying a lot. But it is very limited in the amount of time you can really play it for on each character, and then maybe another playthrough with some new outfits. I would actually like some new game to come out but I'm not aware of any that really interest me right now. I saw Anthem beta and it looks pretty boring honestly. I still like FO76 if they can just fix it.
---
It‚Äôs too bad I can‚Äôt drop mines and wait. It‚Äôs still considered an attack. 
---
Oh ok, yeah I've been trying to make a lot of ammo then go farm there with my friend but lately I'm just exploring remote areas. It's gotten kinda boring solo because I burn through stims so fast now.
---
The Tesla Rifle has been my go-to for a while now. I just hit lvl 50 and crafted and auto Tesla rifle. It‚Äôs pretty awesome. 
---
You have to crouch to hide yourself on the map.
---
I love the idea, but using the Fallout lore I think it should be Couriers. Establish a few set Courier Offices around the map's major settlements where players can send and receive items, and the possibility of building a small Courier Station at your camp where Courier Drones can drop and pick up items for delivery directly.
---
Not that I disagree with the cuntyness of base destroying, but that 2nd rank wrecking ball perk was made exactly for efficient base destruction. 
---
So in pacifist mode, means you cannot capture workshops.  Okay I can get behind that.  
---
If you do, then pacifist mode is turned off for 10 hours of in game time, so you will have to deal with the fallout of your decision.
---
I do my thing still in game since xmas i have not had anything to really do. So i spend my time helping others until we get more content via the text chat mod.
---
Our clan is still active doing the same thing but we are all very tired and we do wish to see alot of new content in the next month or so.
---
I intend to play Anthem and Apex on the side. But i am sure they have more content in the works.
---
I agree I spend so much time trying to make as gather materials to keep ammo, weapon and armor conditions 200%
---
10-15k
---
You've been lucky basically. Or are you saying ALL the people reporting bugs are lying?
---
Did you play the anthem demo? I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to it in a couple weeks.
---
Only thing I can figure is we must all share some sort of random mutation that shields us from bug and glitches. I'm not sure but I think I've read that it's called the Objective Perception mutation, and it's very rare. It grants -100% Bug and glitch occurence, +40 Online Troll Perception, and -1 to all stats when having a bad time in game world. So glad I picked up this mutation. Couldn't imagine how horrendous my life would be without it. I mean it's not like I could just go and enjoy another game, right? 
---
I never said it was PvP-focused. I said it was a PvP game. It is, because it always has PvP.
---
I think Bethesda made a mistake at a very fundamental level; players will never be game pieces. 
---
They got stuck on this idea of: ‚ÄúWhat kind of in-game tension can we create when two players meet in the wasteland?‚Äù When in reality players are always separate from the game world; we move differently, we act differently, and we can always to tell each other apart from the game world. Players will simply never be NPCs. Pure PVP and Co-Op bypass this because they implicitly acknowledge players as something distinct from the game. But by mixing the two they muddied the mixture.
---
Well damn, I guess I need to travel more lately.  It used to be when I would hit vendors, the plans were usually shit.  This was the first time since I started playing in BETA that I've seen the barn plans, brick plans, metal plans, etc.  Basically everything but the basic wood.
---
Nice, I had build a friend their PC.  It was a Ryzen 5 1600.  Had to do the same for the timings.  It was a ASRock mobo.  Not too sure i'll use that brand again as it caused a lot of stress!
---
What if ‚Äúrare‚Äù plants took up a lot of budget like a turret? Would that balance it? 
---
You mean the thing with "eat-o-tronic" written on it in big letters?
---
Who would have guessed.
---
thank you , wish the same for you :)
---
Yea, we shouldn't play a game we payed for.
---
Except unlike in actual social games, whales aren't generally buying things to impress others in F076 - it's like whales that actually buy Creation Club mods, which do exist.
---
Of course, the grand piano and a tuba. On XB1?
---
Till you die. 
---
Welcome to FO76!  It's all down hill from here.  :)
---
Nice and interesting. But I would reserve 2 point for Satched Genes in Luck - to use mutations such as Eagle Eye.
---
FYI - You've been wasting your time sicne day one if you're bulking. The only things worth bulkling are either Lead or Steel iirc - there's basically 2 items that gain a benefit of bulking but the rest don't. If that's been addressed in a recent patch then about time.
---
The issue you then get with bulking is twofold.
---
1) You have an entry in ur stash for bulk items AND for scrap - the stuff left over from bulking.
---
2) By not bulking items you see the exact amount you have, some items bulk into packs of say 15 and you can have 13 of them - so go work out 13x15 or, leave it unbulked and see exactly what u have.
---
The miniscule weight reduction you see is because it uses plastic to bulk stuff and apparently, some of the material you're bulking.
---
Then why dont we put a /s in there, man
---
What it should have been is a singleplayer game with optional co-op like how Far Cry games do it.
---
I never thought my wife would play a FPS game.  She saw me and my kid playing and decided to give it a try.  Looking to buy a 3rd xbox so we can all play together now.
---
now your just sounding ignorant a pvp game is = to a pvp focused game, a game with pvp elements /= to a pvp game.
---
Lol you millennials man, can't be bothered with challenging gameplay. I can hear you fags at your first job already pissing and moaning.
---
Exactly! Someone who gets it!
---
I tested it out, melee bobbles do not stack 
---
Where in Whitesprings? Which vendor?
---
I use it for multiple unarmored enemies and it shines in that situation only
---
you didn't even have to do that, they turn back on when you fast travel back.
---
this is also 100% how i am going to fuck w/ people in the future. 
---
Probability -- it does not work like you think it does.
---
(I assume you know this, I'm just making a funny).
---
Its not that you are on pc or ps4 or xbox its that it's not consistent at all you can play one platform and get 12 different results its just buggy.
---
because it was pretty obvious?
---
No I just saw some basic combat gameplay in a stream. It didn't really look like much to me.
---
Its typical for the market. Everyone wants to be the invincible super human that always wins. As an older (mid 30s) I see it all the time. If people dont become the best first try they label it as garbage. Look at the tons of cheating/hacking across all consoles and games. I highly doubt that anyone will come back, its the game of the month club. As soon as something new comes along I found most people abandon what they have. Hyper consumerism seems rampant in video games. I enjoy 76 for what it is:a hobby not a life event. Id love to see more for the game but its been so negatively perceived I cant see it lasting long. Bethesda wont give people super powers and epic gear so they whine and call the game crap. 
---
Until another player kills you
---
Until you bite the dust
---
I just want the game to be better.
---
So a game with PVP that cannot be opted out of is not a PvP game? Ok, my bad. Sorry that I didn't adhere to your personal classifications while I was making a factually correct statement.
---
Gotcha I‚Äôm on pc. Wondered if that was possible 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs the one thing I don‚Äôt understand about the story or lore of 76. If you have been living together with the residents of Vault 76 for 25 years, it only takes a few seconds of the Vault door opening for that trust to be broken and it‚Äôs an ‚Äúeveryone for themselves‚Äù mentality? That shows there were problems with the Vault long before Reclamation Day.
---
Perhaps a better story for 76 would be that The Overseer goes out first and, upon seeing the damage and horrors of the Wasteland; goes crazy and sets up their own Army to try to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù and fix the Wasteland. Knowing this would disrupt the goal of Vault 76, you (and the other residents) go try to find The Overseer and stop them before any damage could occur and save the West Virginia Wasteland.
---
Now, I‚Äôve never played 76, but I keep hearing the story is poor. I think a story like this would make it a little interesting.
---
You can‚Äôt sell unbulked materials they have no value for most.
---
yup, yes.
---
thanks for that.
---
You know what nerf all heavy weapons  while we are at it lol
---
Yes, I think focusing on PvE would have benefited the game greatly. However it still would have been ill-received because of other game design choices like not having a more traditional story, not to mention bugs and performance issues.
---
Definitely not an MMO.
---
Okay.... So from what I just read about karma it basically means I'm making positive helpful post and comments which add value to the community. (More or less) I'm honestly dumbfounded that's a point of contention. I thought thumbs up were equivalent to liking a post on facebook I didn't realize they kept track of them.
---
They post first on their own website and Twitter. As far as the ‚Äútrue‚Äù fanbase, We are still here and playing, we will always go back and replay an older version or switch it up to an Elder Scrolls game.  I have over 200 hours in and still lots of content to go through. Those that used the obvious exploits only cheated themselves out of the experience. (Whitesprings and Dupers) now that white springs is back to where it should be it‚Äôs unfortunately being abused by low levels and are ruining their own game experiences. 
---
&gt; but putting PvP in Fall Out out is like putting NASCAR racing in Skyrim, or going to McDonalds looking for a steak.
---
So is putting multiplayer in Fallout, yet here we are.
---
I have encountered it numerous times in the woods directly north of the Monongah power plant. At least 3 times. Also, in the woods north of the disposal site (semi truck thing on map), east of the Whitespring, I have seen it at least twice. Heard him more though there but didn't see.
---
That's beautiful dude. I'm happy for you and your family. 
---
At level 40, how could he not already know how the stash worked?
---
They can't be a fun vacuum and remove the cool stuff. Annoying bugs that disconnect or ruin the experience.....Bethesda needs to get cracking!!! Honestly they need to scrap the wannabe Fortnite pvp mode and concentrate on content for the pve. People didn't buy this game for pvp....
---
I run a Discord server that has around 90 members. 
---
As recent as a month ago we would have 26+ people on weekdays and close to 40 on weekends all running together doing SBQ and having fun together. 
---
As of last night, our average player count on a given night is 5, weekends see around 10. I am a member of 7 other FO76 related Discords and have seen a similar number drop of active members. 
---
I had a sit down with my officers to talk about this and to a person, they said the reason was content. They loved the game, had fun playing with each other (many said they would have moved on sooner if not for us) but after 3-4 character builds, and several 100+ characters per account they lack things to do and see. 
---
Almost all of them would come back and many stated that if they made Vaults procedurally generated dungeons that would go a long way to keep them invested. 
---
Since this discussion, I have been opening my Discord to other games, as I really like the people I have started to play with I would hate to lose them over shear boredom and apathy. I can provide my metrics to you in a DM if you want me to show the rate at which members usage of the Discord has dropped rapidly.   
---
That being said I will still log on to work on some builds, craft stuff for people, and putz around. But for many of my active players (10+ hours a day), they are ready to move on and invest in something that keeps them interested.
---
You're telling me that in 25 years you haven't met anyone you would kill if there were effectively no consequences?
---
In what world does a for profit company do work for free?  The reality is of you want additional content or dlc's it's either going to be an additional item sold (traditional dlc) or game as a service ("microtrans").
---
"people who want to inconvenience other people with zero consequences are fine, the people who are being inconvenienced are actually the ones who are wrong."
---
If a weapon deals over 100 damage... nerf it
---
I'm gonna have to slap you with a /r/whoosh because you missed the point by a mile.
---
You have to buy the mods from enclave vendor and they are more often than not mis-labeled. A good 1/3 of them also don't function at all. Buy the mod; stick it on, no change.
---
You cannot scrap scout armor to learn mods.
---
There is a post somewhere on here where some poor guy spent 1,000s of caps and server hopping getting every mod for scout armor and compiled a list of the broken ones.
---
It was very depressing.
---
I never thought about selling them tbh - 200 cap limit a day was easily hit by all the meds I could find in an hour.
---
I had this visual bug happen to me as well but it was with ceramic. I had 4 ceramic scraps on me with other stuff, I go in component view to tag some scrap and then I notice the sudden 4 billion ceramic listed there, I switch out of component view and I do still have only those 4 scraps of ceramic. I found the whole thing to be interestingly odd, 4 ceramic scraps can make over 4 billion ceramic.
---
In my view they need to fix a wide number of major issues, not just end game content.  All my launch day buddies have stopped playing, and each one had a completely different reason for stopping based on different things they considered game breaking.  That's alarming because it means you'd have to fix all those issues to get the full group back and I don't see that happening at this rate.  Nobody moves back into a burning house, and half the time Bethesda seems to be pouring gasoline on it instead of water.  Like I can't even give any of them good news to even get them interested in trying again.
---
Only the clean ranger outfit Inc. hat are going for anything
---
1200'ish caps
---
These are the most idiotic threads ever. So, we should NOT PLAY a game that was designed (according to Bethesda) to be played for years just to preserve its longevity? WTF?
---
No it means you are playing to a crowd. 
---
And rifles dont weigh enough melee weapons need a buff and energy weapons have to much durability 
---
There's this really nice metal barn/garage with locked doors at a house full of taxidermy cats. I'm honestly surprised people don't build there, since it is literally indestructible, and very large.. you can create a pretty amazing house inside and out. 
---
Im all for this sadly this idea wont get much traction, simply for the fact that a lot of players wanting unrestricted pvp just want to grief and that's it. They don't want fair competition.
---
Put them in such server and they'll come back crying since they can't fullfill their power fantasies. It's the same with pretty much any open world game with PVP elements this one. 
---
There is no reason it would be any different here.
---
Nah. I said the word whoA and got literally almost all of the karma I have now. The internet is fickle and karma is fake and gay.
---
You clearly don‚Äôt know how weapons work. The only mod that  goes on a crossbow is a silencer, duh
---
I‚Äôve never launched a nuke.
---
Never trashed other people‚Äôs stuff workshops or camps 
---
Each arc also loses damage from what i can tell 
---
Connect a spotlight. Turrets work so much better with a spotlight.
---
Not quite sure what you‚Äôre saying, but isn‚Äôt there a hardcore pvp survival mode coming soon!?
---
Not everyone's given up on SBQ runs yet--whenever someone's nuked Prime I see the high level folks beeline there!  (Full Disclosure:  Often including myself, gatling plasma in tow...)
---
Just make sure enough high level folks are around when you do it...
---
Now I‚Äôm going to dump everything as far away from vendors as possible. 
---
Fallout was never meant to be more than a 1 play game. This entire installment was an epic fail.
---
It isn‚Äôt a pvp game. It‚Äôs a pve game that you can pvp if you choose to. The fact that your fellow vault dwellers can be jerks and destroy your camp and attack you makes sense. Not everyone from the vault is going to get along
---
It should have been locally hosted, moddable, and primarily co-op.  Bethesda has fucked up so hard in so many ways and somehow they still continue to fuck up in a new way every time they make a change.  I'm almost impressed.
---
YoUrE gOdAmN rIgHt, BiLlY Soooweeeeee go get me shotgun and we gon hunt yerselves some vermits
---
+1 INT
---
Saturday was the first time I‚Äôve gotten on in about two weeks. After dealing with some White springs assholes and 3 freezes i said fuck it and turned it off.  
---
After level 100 everything becomes redundant. Metro drops on the 15th and MK11 in April so i doubt ill be logging on again anytime soon. 
---
\*Paddle ball
---
This game would have been fantastic borderlands style with NPCs included.
---
With this site, on this subreddit, you can't assume everything is /s because it's the stupid things that tend not to be and this was pretty stupid.
---
What do you follow besides reddit for future updates?
---
I have tried to VATS Melee a drone and almost did one time when i say 95% flicker briefly, maybe with marsupial  
---
My names blake not billy dork üòÇ
---
0 1 2 3
---
Obviously someone that remembered that it had eat-o-tronic written on it.  ; )
---
Good to know! I never turn them off so it‚Äôs never come up. 
---
Inside the gazebo, walk along the whole interior.
---
There's a theory that 76 had an experiment, after all...to see what happened to an idealistic Overseer saddled with a bunch of hypercompetent, highly competetive Dwellers!
---
Another way to hard-reboot an Xbox One is to "press" the power button on the front of the machine for 8 seconds. Just like you would on a PC.
---
I say "press", of course, because you don't really have to apply any force to it.
---
Oxhorn , Reddit, 76 forum and our clan stuff.
---
Well said.
---
NONE of the chems stack. They just overwrite each other.
---
I would like to see a ‚Äúshare‚Äù box at vendor locations as well. And you‚Äôd have to be +- 4 levels to take something in there.
---
 For instance for some reason I‚Äôve been toting around a fully upgraded legendary shotty (lvl 5) even though I‚Äôm almost lvl 50. It would be nice to drop it in a box and know a sub lvl 10 player could grab that right out of the vault and put it to good use!
---
Honestly the problem is players that dont have any interest in PvP cant discern the difference between griefing and pvp, In a perfect system you would still die but it would be less surprised. (oh that area has raider players in it which are also pvp enabled...etc..etc....etc)
---
Inversely, I can send a message to people like you that are out of touch by taking a PTO from work and play the whole day without stopping.
---
Would that make you stop these kind of posts?
---
I was looking forward to the tse nerf myself. Like I said the game is easy enough with a crafted pipe pistol. I'm definitely not a "farmer" grinding out xp at white springs. That is a giant resource hog. 
---
I am much happier hitting up roboco in stealth mode and using 20 bullets to clear the whole thing. And just as likely to get decent legendaries.
---
Problem is, I've done it. I've done every event multiple times, hit up all the legendary spawns, all the behemoths, anything. Wondered the forests for hours. 
---
I see some of the games my kids play. Always something new. Where is our content?
---
Had this happen to me a few times in the last few days.   
---
Mostly all the robots in Watoga just dropping over dead the second they spawn or are in my vision. Had one occasion where I was ready to snipe a legendary ghoul, only for it to fall over dead right before my eyes. Never got any hits in. 
---
The game looks cool and plays well from what Ive seen, makes 76 graphics look outdated af. 
---
Im just not into battle royals.
---
Thanks for not being a raider
---
If you want proper PVP go play battlefield.
---
Do you think as new games come out that may ultimately change people‚Äôs perception on returning to this game?
---
Yea good idea! I like that a lot.
---
Yes but everyone is complain ING about it
---
ESO is a real MMO with many more players and very active development. I think it also has the highest focus on story of any MMO I have tried. The quests are fully voiced, there are very few fetch quests or go somewhere and kill x quest. 
---
I also like how gear is handled. You can craft good gear and gear sets and dropped sets drop in known locations. 
---
I am hopeful that they will keep working on FO76 and make it as good one day. When ESO launched it was pretty bad. Pretty much a purely generic mmo and no real elder scrolls feel. 
---
Really?
---
I've seen him about... 5-7 times in my time playing. Mostly in the Swamplands  and one time I was fixing my home and adding things outside he came by and started zapping me in the back...
---
All those times he was called "Mythical Flatwoods Monster" and rightfully so as he seems to be a legendary spawn for most people. 
---
tell me one pvp game that has a ask to pvp feature? i bet you its not a pvp focused game. pubg = no rust = no csgo= no hunt showdown = no these are PVP game they are centered around PVP the main point to the game is PVP. If you have the ability to choose wether to pvp or not that means its not an all out PVP game period its not my definition it is the meaning of PVP. Player vs Player random or not where you are forced to interact whether you want to or not last man standing.
---
I did it yesterday on Ps4. It's like a 40 plans. I distributed them on like 4 vendors.
---
I think that after some patches VATS now remembers body parts you've aimed at previously.  It's torso by default, but if you choose "'head", you can headshot athe next enemies. 
---
Honestly I would have liked both just so if I wanted to I could 1v1 my friend
---
In The Mire, south of the Big Maw.
---
Happened to me to, I was worried killing one would cause the other Whitespring bots to attack me.
---
So in other words he's a dick besides like I said I don't care about karma I just like being able to have a conversation about gaming with people who like it as much as I do. And yeah karma is pointless and I'm not going to stop posting because that guys a dick.
---
Well now your making me feel old. No worries in that department.
---
I am 100% certain that things missing from the legendary lists has absolutely nothing to do with intentional balancing and is purely due to incompetence. 
---
/r/titlegore

No you go play metro excodus
---
Look at your character your what like 20, or 24? Your all part of the first batch of kids born in that vault its all your character likely ever knew.
---
So day 1 on the outside you see the open sky for the first time ever and you don't have the comfort off all that stone to protect you. Something snaps inside you. So begins your murderous rampage just the sight of something some one has built for themselves sends you into a rage and you feel you must destroy it and any sign of them lucky for the owner he is out hunting a rad stag for food when you came a calling.
---
So, so tempted to downvote you for that one.
---
I also feel like I dont have to eat or drink enough maybe make hungry and thirst drop faster 
---
Exactly value I received in plastic  a few minutes ago.  Just a tooltip error.  No weight correlating to value. 
---
Flatwoods monster, random rare spawn like the mothman! 
---
I don't think that having PVP in general is a bad thing. It just has to be done right.
---
Having joinable Factions and PVP Events on the map to take or re-take certain locations would be outright awesome!
---
I do this all the time! First, I see if my bf needs it (but he doesn‚Äôt play much anyways) so I remember going to Sutton station and leaving sooooo many in the trashcan for someone to find! All about helping others ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I usually drop my 1\* low level legendaries at one vendor, recipes at another and plans at another while doing my cap runs. xbox here 
---
How‚Äôs the hunter/hunted thing going? Occasionally I see the message someone queuing up but I never see more than one person. That‚Äôs a dedicated PvP mechanic, correct?
---
I think you misread the comment you're replying to.
---
Fallout isn't exactly your best PvP platform. As OP mentions, the game was solo prior to Fo76 and I imagine a large portion of its player base didn't purchase Fo76 for PvP gameplay. Many others have mentioned they would prefer game stability over more PvP content. I include myself in this group. Why work on PvP when the majority of your franchise fans have no interest in it?
---
I would be curious to know what Bethesda's primary motivator is over trying to expand PvP. Are they trying to cash in on the Fort Night crowd? Do they see other successful PvP games and think they can take some of their market share? I know a lot of people wanted the multiplayer aspect added to Fallout simply for the ability to travel the wasteland with their friends or defeat larger enemies in groups.
---
I myself haven't really been griefed all that much so I can't really talk about my experiences with being griefed (PC). I would like to know which platform most individuals are playing on when they are being griefed. Is it mostly on console or is spread evenly over PC and console?
---
I would love to start a poll on Reddit to see what our community has to say regarding what they would like Bethesda to handle first:
---
1. Bugs/Stability
---
2. PvP
---
3. Additional Content
---
Is there an easy way to poll a sub on Reddit? I don't know of any off the top of my head.
---
They already know they are out of touch - just look at Hunter/Hunted - I've not seem a single pop up after the first 2 days of patch 5.  Still won't stop them, there must be some directive from up high or just the game lead being so out of touch.
---
I think because most people fast travel to a location to walk to another location. At least until all locations are discovered. But yeah I can see it‚Äôs a pain to join the server and then immediately got to the door of a large building and see the loading screen again. Maybe an option of ‚Äúyou want inside or outside location x‚Äù would be a good solution?
---
I just don't see where this mob of PvP-obsessed Fallout players is supposed to come from that requires them to spend all this time, money and focus on PvP rather than improving PvE.  To do PvP right, you have to build it that way from the ground up.  You can't expect to shoehorn a game that was built for PvE into that mold.
---
Hell yeah, can't wait to start as a trog!!!
---
Maybe they will allow balance overhauls...one can hope 
---
Mine is too far away to hurt anything, but yah those ones right out the doors of WS aggravate me too üòÇ 
---
Correct, except you for got one last line:
---
Fallout Fans: Bethesda, where is the story? And this game as buggy as fuck. Can you please for the love of god add more end-game content and fix the bugs. There's nothing to do except mindlessly grind to repair our cardboard weapons and armor.
---
Bethesda: We've heard what you said and passed it on to the team, and now we're working on a new PvP mode that will have it's own beta where we'll listen just as well to your feedback about that!
---
So true. PvPers just want fresh prey, it's all they ever want in open PvP games.
---
I've never killed one of those little electric frogs, even though their sound effect going off next to me makes me jump higher than marsupial. I want a pet one though.
---
Get healing factor mutation.
---
Probably just didn't occur to them. 
---
I cannot go anywhere near Charleston or the game will freeze for me. Every.single.time.
---
2 days of back-n-forth with T/S, diagnostic checks Direct X checks, driver checks, etc. The best they could come up with was to make a new character and see if it happens on that one.
---
The logic on that is flawed, because regardless of the outcome on a new character, it still doesn't fix my only character's ability to zone into Charleston.
---
I'm just looking for the combat armor DENSE plan.. I bought one from Watoga before the patch, but it turns out that it was the misnamed marine dense. XB1 if anyone can help!
---
Or if you do, find a trustworthy high-level to run overwatch...
---
nuked prime yesterday on a server with at least 8+ players over 50 and only 1 came
---
That would be nice if you could effectively communicate with other players other than tracking them down and praying they have mics lol
---
The Tesla rifle is fun at times, good for tagging, but ultimately not viable in the endgame.  Take your tesla rifle to West Tek if you want to know why.
---
Well I'm gonna be watching my back forever now.
---
The last update gave vendors static Plan inventories. Also all train station vendors sell Bulk junk.
---
Its pretty much impossible because you can't place your camps close to each other 
---
As someone getting seriously griefed across servers by the same gang, I agree with you 
---
For sure, Outer Worlds is a great example (though some have stated that it may be linear vs open-world) many members are excited to try and play that. A few members are looking forward to Anthem and already asked for a channel to be made for it (first non-fallout channel in the discord) I've even had some members return to Destiny 2 (another game I saw end game burn outs on, for very similar reasons) during the interim. 
---
If any of those other games stays on top of end-game activities it's hard to see the incentive to return to FO-76.
---
you killed it tho ;)
---
Same here. 
---
I like it now how it is. It's already the best of both worlds, you can kill each other or co-op, so changing it would feel like a demotion. Just don't shoot people and you're all good.
---
why the fk do you get upvotes when I posted this same thing twice.  fk you reddit.
---
Just customizable servers. A server with 2x the camp budget and 2x the area you can build in. Maybe a Clan system where you and your clan mates could build camps right next to each other and build your own town. There is so much potential in this game. Then have your pvp servers where the server owner can set the pvp stats to their likings as well. It blows my mind that a game like this doesn't have a server browser and servers you can rent/host on your own.
---
You're generalizing.
---
I don't care about no human NPCs. The game is built to change based on player feedback, to go against the original design philosophy. We're already getting that special PVP mode because of exactly that.
---
I will invite you to my discord if you are interested. We help people launch nukes anytime. You're totally welcome to come and visit 
---
I think you're significantly off base with those figures, but I understand your frustrations. There's room for both. However, the split is probably 80/20 in favor of PvE in this game. 
---
I don't enjoy PvP, and I believe they should focus *more* on PvE, but I don't mind a little nibble for the other players and to keep it exciting for when we do venture into murder mode.
---
Web I play MMO games, I really enjoy PvP that is fully independent of the main game mode - more of an afterthought. You know, queue up, slaughter, get your PvP currency, go on about your normal experience afterwords. However, that's more for traditional MMORPG games and wouldn't really have a place here, I don't think. Although Destiny 2 does a pretty good job of separating certain game modes so players can prioritize what they want, sort of.
---
I kinda started rambling. Anyway, the point is that you might be frustrated because *you* are in the PvP camp and would *hope* that there are more of you so your voice doesn't get drowned out, but that's simply not the case in this game. Hardcore PvPers have either moved on or never owned it to begin with. The rest of the players are Bethesda or Fallout fans.
---
[Ps4] Everytime someone tried to grief me I just server hopped. I play with pacifist on and have no interest in pvp on the current servers. I will try the pvp servers but I highly doubt I'll like them it seems too easy to spawn camp.
---
As for your poll
---
Aditional content for the love of god give me sometging new to do
---
Bugs/stability
---
Do not care about pvp
---
Got a pic of your setup? Thia sounds like an awesome idea.
---
Tell me one PvE game that has a 'You can never turn off PvP' feature.
---
&gt;If you have the ability to choose wether to pvp or not that means its not an all out PVP game period
---
Ok, glad we're in agreement. You cannot choose not to PvP in Fallout 76 so it is a PvP game.
---
XBox!
---
can i have like a couple million
---
I imagine the expectation this would be an extremely busy and popular game and didn't want to leave empty spots just sitting waiting for people to come back.   
---
I'm pretty sure in real life if they left your spot open for an hour no one would notice or care, but I am sure in some design doc they have a goal that the second you leave it gives then next login to your server with as little downtime as possible. To support a bunch of multiplayer use cases no one really does. 
---
When I get bored I dabble in a bit of griefing, especially at whitesprings and Charleston station.
---
I like to watch players on the overworld map, if there dot isn't moving after a while I can usually find their base. If it's really nice or they look like theyre struggling in the wasteland I'll leave them some stimpacks and move onto the next one, maybe even take some photos for ideas for my own.
---
However, if they have a decontamination shower out in the open I'll destroy it and hope they post on reddit until bethesda pays attention and fixes their repair cost. (Before you downvote think of the greater good)
---
for only 60% of camp budget
---
They wouldn't bother me half as much if they dropped loot worth a damn. For all the ammo we dump into them, there should be a decent reward. 
---
And for the fukking love of Crashna, change that FUKKING screech animation. üò°üò†ü§¨üòÜ 
---
THANK YOU.
---
It's like nobody read the part about how I didn't change anything and my magazine had 24 rounds in it when I started the game.
---
Thanks for letting me know. Let's hope it's swift one. 
---
That would also be cool from a PvP perspective 
---
Thanks
---
Naw you'll be fine, it send an alert to the whole server, so everyone shows up for the party
---
They are here so sturdy the anuses of earths species 
---
Yes but what if you did?
---
Make it so pacifists take/deal zero damage unless taking an already claimed workshop/defending a workshop, and then the game will only turn pacifist off within the confines of the workshop area and it remains off until combat is over. 
---
Ideally. But as I was typing that I was thinking about the various bugs that could be introduced. 
---
I get one shotted about once every couple of days. From out of nowhere, with pacifist on. I'm high level, and wear T60 so I am a target I guess. 
---
Yeah I have to say I‚Äôm 3 or 4 trophies away from my platinum and then I think I won‚Äôt be coming back as often and I do now.. sucks but idk
---
You mean 1200 between all vendors.
---
If you want proper PvE go play Minecraft.
---
Not really, I've never hated anyone enough to actually want to kill them. You might want to consider therapy, man. That's not really normal, unless someone *really* did something to hurt you. In which case you probably still need therapy.
---
Great Ideas, but....
---
There are a few other changes needed as well;
---
1. If someone is attacking my CAMP, or Public Workshop, I should not need to turn off Pacifist mode to kill them, this opens me up to attack by others, and is a common method used by griefers.
---
2. Killing someone who is Wanted for attacking "Your" CAMP or Owned workshop, should not allow them the Revenge option, or allow them to re-spawn nearby.
---
3. Initiating PVP should lock you into the current server for 2 hours and disable your ability to block the player you attacked, this would prevent the Hit &amp; Jump tactics being employed by some.
---
Most of the tactics being used by griefers involve 2 or more working together to take advantage of Lone Wanderers, and due to Bethesda's Indiscriminate Banning, Weapons Nerfing, &amp; Weight limits, most of the friends I have been teaming up with over the past couple of months are no longer playing, which has made me a target lately.
---
I might have gotten it if it was PvE only, so I'm one vote for yes. 
---
Part of the problem that occurs when you have a PvE and PvP blended game is that people will cry for balancing (usually for PvP), the developer will nerf the offending weapons, and then people will cry more about other weapons, and so on, and so on.
---
Then PvE winds up sucking because none of the weapons are special in any way, and there's no new content (partially because the developer spends so much time on PvP balancing). PvE players complain, but the developer doesn't listen to them because it's easier and cheaper to just focus on PvP. So the PvE aspect of the game withers and dies. As a bonus, you're left with PvP gameplay that is basically CoD, but maybe with a couple cool abilities thrown in.
---
 It's exactly what happened in Destiny, and from the posts I've read on here so far, that seems to be the path this game is headed down.
---
If you had that much plastic you would be the Rockefeller family of F076.
---
Each card is one point. You can equip Expert Hacking (comes first since list is alphabetical) without equipping the normal hacking. 
---
If it was a single 3 point card, then each level would get "better".
---
Got mine for 3k.  Same price I paid for my Tattered Field Jacket.
---
Nope, because I care about PVP.
---
Absolutely.  The game certainly seems designed for PvE co-op.  
---
The conspiracy theorist in me thinks there was some corporate meddling to add PvP given the 'battle royale' game craze.
---
We tried my man but the radius between two camps is large. We did try a few in the same area but it caused a few issues of some not placing upon login everytime.
---
We are waiting for private servers and modding support so we can create out own content and rules to allow it.
---
I quit taking workshops , they are for pvp, they have never produced junk at an adequate rate. I can farm 4x the mats in twice the speed, resource extraction is useless . Not complaining at all , just saying . If you don't want pvp , don't take workshops at all. Useless they are , unless used for pvp matchmaker 
---
I'd suggest depositing your junk and simply finding someone to kill you. Go to places with many players (Whitesprings, certain events, etc.)
---
Yeah that's exactly right 
---
No, I don‚Äôt usually screenshot. I‚Äôll keep it in mind next time I‚Äôm on, though!
---
If you mean PVE, when you say Coop, then this game would need actual group content and an endgame. So if you are proposing, that one would have been a more suitable concept for the game over the other (PVP vs PVE), than that is really hard to tell, cause neither PVP nor PVE is implemented in any acceptable and enjoyable manner in FO76. Basically you are asking for a mind game with your question, cause none of it is reality within the game.
---
Solely for practical development reasons and the previous fanbase, I would have focused on PVE. Cause Bethesda obviously is a complete newb in terms of multiplayer and PVP and did not bother to get external help for those foreign gaming concepts. So comparing the concepts of PVE and PVP is kind of nonsensical, cause their implementation matters. That Bethesda got none of it right, does not imply by any means that one concept over the other one is faulty.
---
Its my secondary weapon, paired with my rapid instigating gausse rifle. I use the rifle on big things and for sniping, or to take the legs out of things that just have a bunch of health but not much armor, then switch to the tesla for groups or close quarters. It also helps that half the time you barely have to aim.
---
Actually I'm kind of excited for pvp mode. Will actually give me a reason to join with people and log in again. I played the whole game solo and never said any reason for grouping so I think finding a group of people for pvp mode will be fun.
---
I have logged in, and had 2 neighbors in about as close proximity tomy camp as you can get. Thought it was cool that we all had bases in the same area, with enough room for the bases to coexist. Closest thing I've seen to a town so far.
---
We really need a high five emote.
---
That was very open &amp; honest, thank you. And my shower is out in the open - the hope was that any &amp; all could use it. I'm near WS but not close enough to ever get into the BZ. I wanted an open place anyone could use after a nuke. I'll move my shower inside, maybe it'll help. Again, I appreciate your honesty. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It's sad that random invites are turning into a bad thing. I have several friends on my list who started out as a random invite to the prime nuke site to get a free hop for SBQ fight. :(
---
I'll take you up on that invite as well if you don't mind?
---
You are the 4th or 5th person to suggest that.  All of you obviously failed to read my whole initial comment.  
---
I want this..   
---
I would like the terminal in the camp to be able to communicate with other terminals on the server. say you want to share a game with someone or send them a recorded message or something on those lines.  
---
as well as creating log entries.. say someone gets in your house they can read your log entries. Would also need the option to lock the terminal.
---
I plan on making a post just about the Terminal giving all the details of what I would like it to do. Also it would be cool if placing a metal door with a wall terminal next to it makes  the door only operable via terminal.  
---
This! I swear, playing Fallout 4 now is so lonely. I want my modded Fallout 4 in 76 and I want my 76 teammates in Fo4 
---
It‚Äôs already mostly pve already. Stop trying to make this game fallout 5. This game was never supposed to be fallout 5.
---
Yeah, they'd touted the whole "you'll never see a server list!" like it was a feature when it's really just a massive PITA and DNW.
---
I *really* want persistence though. I want us to be able to work together to clear out a town of enemies and then take over buildings, build fortifications, open shops... *rebuild* like we were promised. You can get around the lack of NPCs if they just would allow us to create real change in the world. You can have events like a Deathclaw pack attacking the town or an infestation of radroaches or mole rats breaking out in someone's basement. Maybe the Enclave starts getting nervous and sends in sentry bots to try and wipe us out. Or a mutation hits the town crops and now we've got to scramble to come up with food for everyone before winter or an army of ghouls coming to lay siege hits. People running for elections for mayor or town council or whatever. So many possibilities.
---
Instead we get magic camps that go *POOF!* when their owner logs out or disconnects - even if the owner's teammates are actively using the camp. We get towns that never get cleared. We get no self-made story. We just get the short end of the stick everywhere.
---
Oh man, while you probably have the "healthier" mindset, I might have to break it to you that even now, with full consequences, people kill each other all the time for all sorts of reasons. Societal collapse would just make it more common.
---
Thanks for the advice. I'll try that now! 
---
Always a good deal 
---
It would be cool for sure
---
so far the closest I have seen was about 
---
25 spaces apart
---
I don't know what it is, but I've been swimming in Tesla Rifles lately.  Over the course of a few days, I found *another* Furious Tesla Rifle, an Anti-Armor Tesla Rifle, a Two-Shot Tesla Rifle, and a 3\* Berserker's Tesla Rifle.
---
For me, jury is still out on whether I think the Anti-Armor or the 3\* one is better.  I don't roll Berserker (I'm the complete opposite - Vanguard build), but the 3\* one carries a +50% limb damage bonus and against enemies with obvious limb damage, like robots, they literally fall to pieces and eventually catch fire.  But, it takes more shots to kill them than the Anti-Armor rifle, and I feel like the chief appeal of the Tesla Rifle is a point-click-dead mob, not making them stumble around.
---
I think the real problem is that there isn't a balance between the two. 90% of the armor and weapons in the game is geared towards pve so when put in a pvp situation they either dont work or work two well. The large enemies in the game have huge health pools and DR but other players dont so my anti armor explosive lever action is a man killer in pvp but in pve it isn't too over powered. 
---
Who hurt you in this way? 
---
I'm keeping my eyes on these reddits to know when they start actually adding stuff in rather than just making it more tedious every update. 
---
where did i say turn off? your putting word in my mouth now quit while your ahead
---
Fallout was never meant to be first person. Any Fallout that is not top down is an epic fail.
---
Am I doing the Fallout hipster thing right?
---
Less people there are at the queen, the easier it is. Prime tse 50cal  till it lands then melee build and its done and over.
---
The pacifist thing has screwed me before I tried taking out a wanted player and did no damage and couldn't figure out why. Pacifist shouldn't work on wanted players or when defending workshops.
---
No idea then, haven't used them for a while now so dunno if something broke with them. 
---
Even though the PvP'ers are pretty loud around here, I feel the 'silent majority' of players are PvE players...many of them solo.  
---
I would certainly welcome PvE-only servers.  
---
&gt;your putting word in my mouth now quit while your ahead
---
Rich coming from Mr. PvP-focused.
---
Wow you got so triggered you made an edit? What a sweet snowflake. 
---
I'll be taking a break for couple weeks when new Civ 6 expansion is out next week. Will do some trading still, but not much other than that.
---
Yes. This is all people ever wanted when they said they wanted mp fallout. We want to play with friends, not a-holes. 
---
No sir, this does not work. I have these perks and it still took 200 shotgun shells and half the protectrons of Watoga to kill it. Crippling the rotors does nothing but show them on fire. 
---
Sure thing. The only requirement is that you are or eventually become an Enclave general, this is necessary in order to be able to launch nukes. If you are not a general yet we can get you there. I will shoot you an invite shortly 
---
You can do it!
---
Please explain how you determined that half of the players PvP.  
---
Try farming whitesprings where you can kill 6 3* legendarys in a row and they take 3 min to load there loot and then either have nothing a crappy one star or a drill.
---
I'm also worried for the future of the game because it won't be profitable for Bethesda to keep it alive. For those of us who do enjoy it and won't be playing those other games, all of this is damning.
---
Without paid DLC, they'd have to rely on cosmetic micro purchases to justify major updates and investments. However, I think they'll take their highly profitable first run sales and pack up shop. There are like 4 developers, 3 community managers, and almost zero new assets. I feel at this point like I got punked. Lesson learned.
---
With mutations you can jump over it, i did it once.
---
What do you do after you drop a clip on her and your gun breaks?
---
We all have the bankrupt debuff, pvp is a 1 sided fight 
---
For real - I've given up on the X-01, found a pair of T-51b legs, so will just do the overpriced BOS vendor shocks plan for those and run through the nuked bog a few times until I can find enough violet flus to make them. Will probably still be less time-consuming and annoying than server hopping that enclave bunker!
---
They have already said pvp and pve content will come be patience
---
I am a general, so no worries there. Thank ya!
---
Oh I was thinking it would only be for when you exited the server in that room. Fast travling or exiting the server outside that room would result in the current system.
---
U on rn?
---
The constant complaints about it. 
---
The fact that it exists 
---
That my character doesn't say crazy shit this time when i pump my veins full of psycho.
---
I've been playing FO since 1998 (Own every version, except FO Tactics), and all I have ever seen other FO players asking for in forums is a multi-player co-op version, so I can't for the life of me figure out who at Bethesda thought this PVP crap was a good idea for this game.
---
If you cripple enough of it, it will just sit there, allowing you to use whatever weapon you want and take your time.
---
I've done it many times.
---
No I‚Äôll be online later on the afternoon like 4pm EST so if you could hold it that would be great
---
Most people kill other people for a reason, though. Either they're mentally ill, on drugs, desperate, or otherwise outside of a normal state of mind (anger, for example). They don't just randomly decide to kill someone one day in the right state of mind. 
---
No normal person think "I just really don't like this person so I'm going to kill them for no good reason". 
---
Societal collapse would be the desperation bit I mentioned above. People would be trying to obtain or protect resources necessary for survival. 
---
It's totally plausible that could even happen between people who were raised in the vault together but you wouldn't come right out of the vault killing people who had nothing to take when you also have nothing to be taken.

Issue: Server disconnects players every time Atom shop pushes out an update. I have pretty stable server performance. I can play 6-8 hours uninterrupted. I check the Atom shop regularly for new skins that I may want to spend my atoms on. 
---
I have noticed over the game's lifetime that EVERY time an update to the Atom shop happens, a disconnect happens. I was just checking the store 15minutes ago and there were no changes to the store. I just got disconnected and checked the Atom shop and a new item was listed (VTU pipboy limited sale).
---
Please and thank you. My only PvP experiences so far have been at workshops, and I actually found them quite fun, since it was somewhat random and it a coordinated griefing or anything.
---
The most fun was when I was level 17, the attacker was 30something. We traded kills and caps a few times but he ultimately got the best of me. He took the camp, I saluted him and chose not to continue the fight and went my merry way.
---
The least fun was when I was around the same level 17 or so and a level 80something in X-01 showed up and one shotted me. I just let him have it after that. He left me alone. We went our separate ways.
---
But having a solid way to defend the bench sounds like a great way to get back into some workshop PvP I have otherwise been avoiding lately.
---
Whiny little bitches on Reddit and YouTube 
---
I added a link to my other comment.  It no longer does this. 
---
Honestly, the destruction of excitement over fallout in general. I stopped playing the game a while ago and don't see myself buying the next in the series, if there even is one. 
---
Alright forsure
---
You can absolutely solo the fight with the right gear, but if you need some backup shoot me a msg. I have some friends and we jump on a few times a week to help/fight the good fight. It's worth it to see the story.
---
It's the swift magazine that came on it, which up until yesterday took 25 rounds.  Now it takes 10.  
---
I've restarted, dropped and picked up, faved and unfaved. Still just 10 rounds.
---
Same dude. Ive made a couple different posts here with different attitudes toward the game and people just seem to love the negativity. Pretty sad imo. 
---
For example, this post has way higher engagement : likes dislikes comments, than my other posts which frame the game in a positive way. 
---
It's a good game though and I hope more people see the light. 
---
The whole reason China invaded Alaska was bc of the oil. There's no evidence (that I know off) that proves other countries also switched to primarily nuclear power.

I appreciate this comment  u/Bignholy I did not know that about WoW. All I have to go by is the US/EU release of Black Desert.

It‚Äôs nothing like a battle royal

Lmao I remember you. You've told me this before.... and yes I guess I really do want FO5. Anyways how are you doing? I hope your well.

Well, that kind of stuff is normal for any game. There's always time pressure for content, or else things would go on forever. 
---
In the case of Fallout 76, the things that aren't finished weren't quests - it's basic systems in the game that are broken, buggy and/or unbalanced. 
---
Awesome idea
---
I've only seen one handmade in the game - this one. Which I haven't changed, because I have no mods for it.
---
Guess I missed the part about the spotlights. I've had some luck with scrapping the damn things and rebuilding once they go dormant.
---
Switch to my Gauss.  It's...not ideal, granted.  (So much reworking needed...this game needed another six months to a year to cook...)
---
DOH!!
---
They'll fix the game regardless. You should leave if that's the only reason you're playing. I stopped grinding at like 400 hours, it's okay. They see the time invested and know we'll come back when there's more content
---
I got my tricentennial for 6 bucks on ebay, theres plenty of people who hate the game due to an absurd amount of glitches so if you check other online vendors you can find it super cheap.

I bulk items to sell for caps too.  Any bulk that sells for 80+ caps each is what I end up bulking.  Gears mostly, cause they are so abundant and I don't use much.
---
LOL now just nonsense is spewing from your mouth what does this drivel even mean or what context does this have to the conversation what we have resorted to name calling ok ill equally insult you rich coming from a neckbeard living in moms basement thats throwing a tantrum. 
---
I would say playing a broken game with readily available fixes is better. These are not cheats that I use. Just improvements. Many of those are requested changes by the community. I no Fallout player who has played every Fallout made that never uses mods. That's QoL
---
That right behind you baby was only in the trailer and not the final game :(
---
The only achievement on ps4 is kill 20 players, kill a wanted player, and kill a player. Nothing about destroying someone‚Äôs camp. I‚Äôm 4 trophies away from completing the game and I‚Äôve never destroyed someone‚Äôs camp. 
---
I have not bought Atoms yet. The conversion rate of 500 Atoms for 5‚Ç¨ is just too expensive for me.
---
Well, you probably should because Bethesda already stated FO5 will be single player.
---
I miss that RAARGH! so much. And that dopey face that the vault boy would make.

I definitely would play it significantly less if I couldn‚Äôt PvP

Not a vendor; there is a dome area over the sidewalk near the tennis courts that has a sulfur fountain that will cure disease. For free.

You can only build a level 4 machine gun turret which is only a danger to molerats or level 1 scorched I believe.  Anything more than that does require a much higher level and you to have Home Contractor Perks too.

Todd Howard: 'We want PvP to always be present in Fallout 76'
---
A 'literal who' on Reddit: 'lol u dumb this not a PvP game'
---
I've said it before. Bethesda. 
---
We just want, 1-4 multiplayer co-op, borderlands style with your games. 
---
I 100% agree with OP, when you make a game PVP then you have to deal with *The Balance process*; which means now you have to tweak every gun to make sure it's not OP against other players. Now you have to make sure that people cant just craft the best shit, and make sure people stay on the same level of grind, which totally ruins the feel. 
---
Give me a fucking Elder scrolls, or fallout game. With that 1-4 player style co-op. Share quests, hop in and out of games with friends etc. 
---
Or hell, do it like you did with ESO, 1-4 player co-op for the side shit, and then have the main storyline solo. 
---
It's not a good game. We need to just accept this as a species and move on with our lives at this point. This is not an opinion.
---
There really is no good reason to ask why, we all know the answer. FO76 is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) pushed out the door when it needed another 6 months of development time, minimum.

I just wish once we got all three we could combine them into Prime Hacker and Prime Lockpick or something, just to make perk swapping less of a chore.

Bethesda and the lack of support or fixes
---
I run into them fairly frequently at the middle mountain cabins. its typically either 3 radscorpions (most common for me), 3 yao guai, or 3 honeybeasts. not bad for farming some scrap. and theres a cap stash there. Well, most of the time.

playing on PC, general's quarter modus vendor usually sells  scout armor mods, gl telling the difference between the mods, as they might be for limbs or chest but doesnt specify.
---
Dropped, accidentally sold, been there, done that!  This game needs a way to allow us to lock stuff so they can't be dropped/traded away/etc before unlocking first.
---
That's an opinion bud
---
Can I get a Hallelujah!
---
I still enjoy.  I'm not going to stop playing to teach Bethesda a lesson.  When I get tired of the game I'll put it away lol
---
If you want 'real content' at the top all you have to do is click that little Vault Boy head. Isn't democracy wonderful.
---
my 2 caps worth on the idea, not only make it a quest, but a server wide quest that needs X people to have done steps for it to make it happen (Step 1. clear out debris on the track, step 2 fix the train, etc)
---
If you've played Warframe, you've played Anthem.
---
the idea has been bounced around here a few times, i think they were calling it T.O.W.N.
---
Well I believe they‚Äôre making it similarly to World of Warcraft. The nerfs seem to only make the game harder, if you guys ever played wow, you‚Äôll know that mod grinding is a easy. Then they announced VAULT RAIDS. sound very much like a WOW instance, you and your group/team all go into a vault and try to get to the end of it where the boss is and there is decent loot. The SBQ is only one boss. I think what they wanted was for us to be preoccupied with the SBQ until they opened vault raids and the new bosses show up. Hence why the game is being nerfed, they don‚Äôt want the raids to get exploited.
---
Sorry I didn't see this when you posted or I'd have come to the rescue. If you're still there, lmk and I'll come bring you some things.
---
Life ain't easy in the wasteland kid. I'm the same way, but sometimes you just wanna go crazy. At least that's how I see it happening.
---
I was laughing about it lol not sure how that‚Äôs being triggered. Keep those downvotes coming ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù. 
---
I am good man. But really, I can‚Äôt remember the
---
last time I had a bad interaction with a player. The kind of pvp that greifers like is already heavily discouraged. I don‚Äôt see what it would achieve other than take time away from the real changes that need to be made to the game. 
---
The only way the new mode is "what people wanted" is if, after they test it out, they remove PvP from adventure mode and make it solely a part of Sirvival.
---
I can defeat the queen without any duped bobble head or any bobble heads at all for that matter. 
---
Because a video game is rarely fun indefinitely and it's normal for people to move on to other games.
---
Could a name tho
---
Well I no longer feel like I hit the jackpot, and that I just blew my whole wad of caps.  Oh well.
---
Yeah, you can get your brats a second hand xbone for the same as a second hand rx480 8gb.
---
No. Its an observation. The poor stability and state of the game is a very real and concrete thing, very far outside the realm of opinions. Severe lack of quality is a quantitative observation and absolutely not an opinion.
---
Not all mods are cheats. Many are fixes or improvements in the game. Some are added by Bethesda. Known plans was a mod, now it's part of the game. I do not use cheats. That will get you banned, and it should.
---
Haven't played Warframe either, so Anthem is just a copy of another game?  The whole gaming industry is busy copying each other.
---
There's a Jaw Harp on the stage at the Watoga High School too.
---
I appreciate the civil discourse. It's nice to have a good conversation on this reddit. Often I go to the filthy casual because I don't like the hate-train, the automated downvote bots, and the general negativity. You give me some hope about coming on this one.
---
I don't get why people are on the subreddit who don't even play the game.  Why take the time just to say negative shit. I'm sure everyone knows the game has problems.  We dont need a million post about the same stuff
---
I think adventure mode should become PvE only when survival mode comes out.
---
Welcome to the Internet.
---
Pacifist doesn't make you immune to damage...
---
If you are flagged you still take full PVP damage.
---
If you aren't flagged you're just lying, because slap damage one shots have been debunked a thousand times.
---
I have thought this every day since launch.
---
I'm on the bored side. I have finished all the quests, have some nice guns, built a camp in a great location until player vendoring comes in and now just want to farm up caps for some plans from the vendors. After a vendor run I scout the workshops for players higher level than me, 162, to try to get a bit of back and forth going. If it's anyone lower I'll typically just do the defend event if it pops and leave. 
---
Had a glorious time farming a level 300+ guy a couple nights ago. Up about 1500 caps. 
---
I would love these changes I bought the terminal plan thinking I could at least lock/open doors and was extremely disappointed 
---
Yeah bloodied sneak vats rifle build will do more dmg than melee, and you don't have to wait for sbq to land.
---
same, month and a half till survival mode beta!
---
Damage is so messed up that Melee builds can just charge you and 1-2 shot you even in Power Armor. I personally won't be using them for a while. 
---
Come again?
---
I dont like Mario games to me they arent good but there are millions of people who like them. I like fallout 76 even with its problems.  It may be a bad game for you but not for me. Its an opinion not fact.
---
Optional team based pvp events would have been great. Make the map pve, but it would need some "raider" abilities like being able to steal.
---
Yeah. This is what we need. Not actual content that fits the tone and theme of the Fallout franchise, just more Fortnite bullshit. 
---
The horrible bugs, glitches, server disconnects, lack of content, and lack of updates
---
Heck, I'd even be happy to have local co-op in FO4 with a second person playing the companion. 
---
So your opinion is that it's not a good game, gotcha. 
---
Zenimax is not Take Two Interactive. BGS does not have share holders.
---
I want adventure mode to become PvE only when survival mode comes out.
---
Well I'm jelly 
---
Also you can get the normal version, see if you like it enough, and THEN upgrade to the tricentennial if you just really want the extra stuff.
---
This is a pvp game.  Accept it and you will feel better.
---
If we‚Äôre throwing out anecdotes: griefer attacks down since last patch. 
---
These people suck, I agree, but this is just a shitty thing that happened to you. It‚Äôs not happening to everyone. I‚Äôve been griefed less for what it‚Äôs worth. 
---
How about you stop telling people what to do?
---
Not lying, asshole. I always have pacifist on. Went to a sbq nuke zone and got one shotted. Respawned and got one shotted again, rinse repeat x4. 
---
Theough could be a twist on the name theo, I was going for funny but autocorrect ruined it
---
lmao
---
I've used it against Mirelurks in Heart of the Swamp and it works well. Although people here are saying it loses damage with each arc, another tip I saw elsewhere which works well for me is to shoot the ground next to your target. The first arc tends to do more damage than shooting something directly.
---
I've had decent results against Gutsys in AWOL Armaments doing the same thing.
---
lvl 4 lockpicking is that super sledge you have in your hand
---
Double check your mods.  Seems like you have a different magazine than you think.  Swift gives +25% on the base 20, but piercing drops it to 10.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Handmade_rifle_(Fallout_76)#Magazine
---
I don't pvp but I know many do and hate the current pvp system, and I hope this new pvp server will be more to their liking. Heck I may just start a new character for the new pvp server just for shits and giggles.
---
I think ManyATrueNerd's playthrough of 76 was the most enlightening.  He really tried to get into the story, connect the dots, explore everywhere.  He had issues with is, as everyone does, but was the most honest representation I've found.
---
PvP in this game might be fun but at this time it cant really be because people abuse the mechanics to grief on purpose. 
---
Also real PvP players dont hunt PvE players(you dont shoot fish in a barrel) but that still doesnt push aside the fact that what is balanced in pve become imbalanced in pvp and therefore breaks pve when it gets balanced(in every game).
---
People don‚Äôt spend $20.  They spend the atoms they earn in game.
---
The measure of a game is:   Is it fun?   And F76 is fun.    It is a *good* game.  Just not a perfect one 
---
LOL
---
Trying to keep it civil and just truly discuss how people feel. Todd states this game was meant to run for years, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything through various social platforms about upcoming content 
---
Had this happening in WS yesterday, many of the ghouls were just dropping dead as I would approach them, and one legendary ghoul that I sniped from a good distance, suddenly came back to life, then dropped dead as I approached to loot it, and it had no loot, so I server hopped.
---
Server hopping is the answer to most of these issues, but when playing with a team, who has finally found a server where everyone's CAMP will place, last thing you want to do is start over.
---
I think the game would have been better if they favored a specific genre. It would have been better as an instance based RPG-looter with the *ability* to invite up to 4-7 friends for co-op and just leave the SPECIAL system basicly how it was. Or make it so that SPECIAL customization is fully realized at the beginning, perks and all, and ditch the leveling.That way you could actually flesh out a *character* as in, from beginning to end, you *are* a scientist or you *are* a PA heavy weapons specialist, etc. Mix that with the fact that it could have been better as a true Survival game (like RUST in a fallout universe) with perminent persistance building/crafting and the ability to *choose servers* (especially if they split them between pve/pvp servers) at least then you could *truly* roleplay as something that feels meaningful. Instead we have a small crappy dose of everything on top of a broken engine. 
---
I could go on...
---
That point is, they should have put all their efforts into ONE avenue instead of trying to make one game fit every genre.
---
i think thats cause the npc is still alive on the server when the animation plays and is trying to escape
---
https://discord.gg/pnsCdP  I'm wheeldog in there too. Welcome.

I've never:
---
* had a play session that didn't include at least 1 crash to desktop
---
* had a play session that didn't include at least 1 disconnect from server that sent me back to the main menu
---
* been able to find the last/next overseer's log(s?) Seriously where are they? I have no quest marker for them and I've gotten the ones from the silos.
---
* had a surplus of ballistic fiber
---
* had my camp leveled or otherwise griefed(except by mole rats)
---
* regretted destroying turret camps behind the white springs gold course
---
* run out of rad-x, or radaway
---
* been more disappointed with a game from a known talented publisher
---
Post it on discord 5mins before and you'll have plenty of high level players ready to help.
---
What console are you picking it up for? If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can help you find your way in the wasteland. 
---
in open world survival games, other players are the endgame.  thats how i expected 76 to be, but we wont get that until survival mode is balanced.  feels like we are a long way out from that but theres great potential there.
---
wtf really? 
---
Need help with this week's silo Charlie code. 
---
If you count the people who hate and complain about the people who hate and complain, you can bring that statistic to 100%!!
---
So wait can you run back and forth between 2 stashes about 50m away from eachother and get the search caps from them every time?
---
What‚Äôs the platform the discord is based off, if it Xbox can I get an inv?
---
Four times in one week seems high. Is your camp set up with turrets behind the golf club? Blocking a rare spawn? Has too many swastikas? Too few swastikas?
---
Two shot explosive is the word you‚Äôre looking for. 
---
I'm lazy, I just dump them at the overseer's camp.
---
I remember one time I was at my camp working on my power armor and all of a sudden I hear foot steps (earlier that day a guy came up to my camp and repaired his power armor, offered to pay, I told him ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fine. No need to pay‚Äù and he said thanks and left.) and it was there two guys wearing masks and just jumping around on my roof and going into my house. Like I‚Äôm fine if you want to check my stuff out, that‚Äôs cool. The thing that got me was, I left to go do a scorched earth event and while I was preparing, I get a message saying my camp is under attack. Guess it‚Äôs my fault for leaving them at my camp? Also there‚Äôs a perk card for destroying workshops. Don‚Äôt know if you can use that on people‚Äôs houses. Kinda sucks players are even allowed to do this tbh 
---
I mean, Fallout 76 has basically been a "co-op" experience for me. It's so rare that we encounter other players, let alone need to, that the game is more or less just me and my buddy shooting and looting our way through Appalachia.
---
and those of us just here to shitpost 
---
Hmm I‚Äôve seen a drastic increase in hunter activity, but I‚Äôm on pc.
---
I was at the giant tea pot on the southern end of the map. I was just walking around looking for all the scrap and ammo I could pick up when I heard someone call out to me. I figured I was probably about to get killed so I crouched down and put my gun away. He walked up to me and dropped some loot for me. I carefully took the loot and then he told me what the emote key was and how to use the push to talk. We ended up traveling for a bit together and I ended up adding him on Discord and adding him to my server! So that's a cool experience. 
---
Dude, were you born in a vault?  You're letting all the rad contaminated air in without a door!
---
It is just so independent of likes and dislikes and that's really what people on this sub dont understand. You can like the game, but you absolutely cannot claim that 
---
1. Assets werent reused 
---
2. A rushed priduct wasnt delivered 
---
3. Optimization took a backseatike
---
These are all FACTS SEPARATE OF OPINION. 
---
Mario was executed extremely well and is a very charming and wonderful series, and early games were simple and 8 bit but beloved by all. But now, mario games are polished, finished, and the industry standard tbh. Mario has earned his praise, and even still, not liking him is definitely fine and an opinion: but separate from that is his greatness. 
---
You're never going to get that on any public server, especially not without paying a large subscription. You get that in Minecraft because you run your own server and pay for it. 
---
All this talk of griefers yet I've been playing since Christmas roughly 15-20 hrs a week. Having a blast, meeting tons of friendly people, even started trading on the Fallout Marketplace. No issue with griefers. Sorry for your experience, hope it gets better.
---
Take off your gear, only vault suit left equipped.
---
Then go to vault 76 and wait. Vault 76 is free fast travel. 
---
If fast traveling to the bounty is more expensive than the bounty no one will come.
---
Alot of ppl stopped playing and they come here to get info if the game has improved.
---
They then see the same thing they saw months ago and deposit some salt then go back to waiting then eventually forgetting this title entirely.
---
Thanks for the confirmation on that üëç
---
Wish they had copied ME3's PvE model. Soo much better. Different server space and inventory. 
---
Please don‚Äôt think as a Canadian.  
---
Absolutely not the measure. Come on man, that just means ITS FUN. fun is not the only measure of a game in 2018 hell it wasnt the measure in 1999
---
The guyi was replying to was not running a bloodied build.
---
If I remember correctly, ESO wasn't very popular in the beginning, but grew to be as time went on. I already think this game is better than ESO. It just needs its rough spots cleaned up. Inexcusable. But it could get better. 
---
Attn: u/ladydevann
---
I had the same thing happen once, lost one of the legs to my Excavator armor. Not as bad as a legendary, though.
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying and it makes perfect sense. If I‚Äôm in watoga hs and left the server, when I rejoin the server I should be inside of watoga hs, not outside of it. 
---
Yes, intangible nonphysical data literally are nothing.     
---
They're not "things", they are purely conceptual. 
---
It could work using robots since most of Appalachia is automated in comparison to the west. 
---
You could also just RP as a courier lol.
---
What is bos vendor location Harper‚Äôs very ? 
---
I wish there was more ammo available or that the charisma perks worked better so buying ammo was more economical. 
---
Me too.  I figure a new player can put them to good use.

[Similar complaint. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am52b6/cargobots_are_dumbenforcer_doesnt_work/?st=JRURYK18&amp;sh=4cc871b3) 
---
If we do not complain, Bethesda does not do anything 
---
 Many of us spend $ 60 on this early access. it was not cheap 
---
The exploit is that the people in the group attacking him don't count as hostile in the same way that the person taking the workshop does, so if you have pacifist on then they are doing full damage to you and you're doing nothing to them. 
---
again being pvp focused and having pvp elements dont mean the same thing. Get it through your thick head i said FO76 has PVP elements i did not say FO76 has zero PVP it is not the same thing learn to read you are proving my point every time you type you're just being ignorant you probably even think me calling you ignorant is an insult. Let me say it once more FO76 Has PVP elements which means i can choose to enter into pvp or avoid it by not continuing the fight and go somewhere else i can also block players if i want. Learn about the game you keep quoting things about the game to make yourself sound correct which are never full statements.
---
i can quote stuff too
---
"Hines also wanted to make it clear that while players can attack players, it won‚Äôt be a completely lawless free-for-all.

Stagnation.

Updates go at a snail pace and no clue about the future.
---
I know more about anthem through March than i do this game and anthem hasn't even launched
---
Glad to hear you are well 
---
So part of it is I think it'd be funny to see the outrage from everyone who "wrongly" got sent to pvp servers. And I believe the current anti griefing system is flawed and should have harsher penalties. 
---
Yes, I know I won't even fight it anymore I want FO5 but I'm impatient so I'll do my best to make this game work.
---
DId you armor disappear from inventory, or just become unequipped? I've had unequipping happen often, especially after a respawn.
---
I always forget to sort my lists, disconnection between brain and fingers :)
---
Came across the munitions workshop the other day.
---
Some jackass blocked EVERY entry with concrete barriers stacked on top of each other.
---
He was no longer on the server and the workshop was unowned, but his barriers remaind and were apparently immune to damage. I attacked them for a good long time, no damage bars, nothing.
---
I have never teamed up with anyone except to do a trade. I have killed the sbq bitch like half a dozen times now. The biggest thing you need is radx, rad away, stimpacks, and go in with no junk as you will lose it. The fight itself is fun, I prefer whitesprings over the one in the cranberry bog for a footing aspect. 
---
it was the measure in 1999 and it is now.
---
When i logged out yesterday i checked the map and realized i'm the only dot showing on the whole map, so i kinda agree it seems empty.
---
Maybe it's just a bug.
---
Im fairly new to the game, and didnt see cap stashes before. Now when i pick them up (only ever found 2) i get nothing? How do these things work lol
---
whaaaaa? guess i need to check again

Not only would we not murder each other, survival would have the greatest opportunity if we simply set up a settlement right outside of the vault.  Together.

this is the 3rd post like this on the front page of this sub, yall are certainly not the 'silent majority'.  the anti pvp faction of this sub is significantly louder than the pvp players.   i rarely check this sub now cuz its an echo chamber of anti pvp players making wild assumptions about us.

What you believe to be quality is your opinion.
---
Me too! That‚Äôs why I made a post like 45 minutes ago about exactly that.
---
The thing is, Fallout 76 isn't a thrill-a-minute kind of game.  While there is an overabundance of holotapes at the beginning, the overall pace of the game *is* relatively slow.  It's built more around "living" in the game's world and exploring and questing at your leisure.
---
Some players, reviewers especially, just want to rush through it and let the impressive things come to them.  That's how they've been trained by years of modern triple-A games.  But that's not what happens in 76.  You are expected to take an active role in planning your adventure and what you do from day to day, and the game is more of a canvas with little prompts to inspire you.
---
I just feel like there‚Äôs a time window that‚Äôs getting smaller each day for them to add new content and make fixes. It absolutely can get better
---
Had my first CAMP attack last night myself. 
---
One dude (lvl 28, I am just 25) comes wandering into my camp and looks around. I emote a wave and try the mic but no response. Odd but ok. Then he is running all around my camp and upstairs so I follow him, then he starts with the slap damage. I decide to ignore it since I was almost done scrapping/crafting for the night and about to log out so I start walking back downstairs. Then I see two more! One in power armor and at first I am thinking that they are attacking the first guy for his wanted status. NOOOPPEEE. They are blowing up my CAMP! 
---
So I just log out. Hope I don't have too much to fix tonight after work. :-(
---
Find where I said the game was PvP focused. And no, you going 'Well PvPv and PvP-focused are the same thing' doesn't count.
---
Try this one on for size' PvP elements that can't be turned off = PvP game'.
---
&gt;Let me say it once more FO76 Has PVP elements which means i can choose to enter into pvp or avoid it by not continuing the fight and go somewhere else i can also block players if i want. 
---
Ok, Counterstrike isn't PvP because if I don't want to shoot people I can just sit in a corner and log off. It's not a PvP game because I can choose not to enter into PvP if I don't want to.
---
Swiper no swiping! Hiyah!
---
I dont understand how people can be level 200 or have 4 characters level 100 and bored.  Do people not work? No family? I get up at 5 am every morning to get ready for work out the door at 6 work from 7-3 or 7-5 every day.  Get hone play with my kid eat supper put him to bed at 7 hang out with my wife for an hour ans that leaves 2 hours of gaming if I'm lucky.  Spread that across 2 or 3 games I choose to play.  On weekends I wake up at 5 am ans game till my family wakes up.  There is no way I could ever get 4 level 100s in a few months.  
---
I'm not being a dick I'm genuinely curious do people have no work? No family? How in the hell do people throw in that many hours? Is this regular? Is majority of player base this way? Is it even reasonable for any developer to have so much content for people who can log in 10+ hours per day?  I genuinely dont understand and if people have that kind of time daily I would maybe suggest going on a date? Spending time with family? Not hate here just genuinely perplexed.  Doing anything for that kind of hours per day has to be an addiction and cant be wholly healthy.  Which then would lead to the question should developers be catering to those addicted? Building the absurd amount of content needed to feed people who dont do anything else? I can see that level or content being added in years but day 1? And maybe I'm out to lunch and majority of players are that way, in which case wow no words.  
---
Mechanically you don‚Äôt, but there‚Äôs no food in the vault and I don‚Äôt care about Shaun.
---
you know that pvp players dont exclusively pvp right? someone who engages in pvp mayalso help other players
---
I spent $30 and started playing around the 1/11 patch. Seems great to me on PC. 
---
I use the flatwoods cache, I figure it gets more traffic from newer players. 
---
Honestly, you never know with the people that plays this game. I think what you did was smart. Because if you show you‚Äôre cool with it, he could bring a group of buddies back or anything. I always try to be nice first in this game but I always get blown over by the people who are doing the wrong. So I think you did the right thing. Your stuff is locked for a reason right? 
---
Yes. Should've been no PVP, or dedicated PVP servers. As it is I do feel it's broken enough that both sides don't care for it. 
---
Pretty sure my attackers were hunting for people to Grief because I am nowhere NEAR anything....on purpose.
---
I am just curious. Would you be happy if you have a reconnect button which does not work all the time?
---
Whoosh yourself

Is that why my carry weight goes from 210 to 610 randomly

Someone of us have been here since mid-november for $60.
---
I have a 2 star automatic testa rifle with (+10% dmg if mutated, +10% while aiming) I use the the lv 1 of each commando perk and it does decent damage, it's great for lower level crowd clearing.
---
No lol The top down games and previous installments all had something in common that made those games great. Something that this game had completely abandoned.
---
Yeah same, back in November they gave us a good roadmap and pledged to be transparent but now it's kinda meh
---
I understood the point. As did others here, he did not. Hence the whoosh
---
Your right but if people can play it and enjoy it can still be a good game depending on who you ask. It's all a matter of opinion on what people are willing to put up with. I got my money's worth from the game so I'm happy.
---
No, its relative to the subject. In gaming, "quality" refers to things such as good graphics, replay value, smooth mechanics, immersability etc
---
A game that fails most of these is not a good game! You can like it, however charming it is, but that does NOT CHANGE THE REAL OBSERVABLE FACTS lmao like idc about downvotes its just hilarious that people cannot take justified criticism against something they personally like lol like yall are soooo salty because other people dont like this game!!!! 
---
The people who dont like this game are salty because the people like yall, who are willing to forego every other aspect of quality in favor of personal enjoyment, are whats causing game developers to think this shit is okay. My advice? Be more frugal!!!
---
Complaining on this sub about the issues plaguing the game is more fun than actually playing the game.
---

I ran out of bullets completely so I picked up a super sledge from a Super Mutant which is great for dispatching one or two enemies ,but when they gang up on you I just want my shot gun.

Nah thats too easy

I'm 38 years old with a wife and 2 kids. I don't have a lot of time to play video games. I just got back into gaming with Fallout 3 about 7 years ago and got Fallout 4 with an Xbox One for Christmas a year ago. I have NEVER been into online gaming at all and have never seen the benefit (for me) of having a live account. Then FO76 comes by. Being a WV native, it immediately grabbed my attention so I ended up getting a live account. I am terrible at shooters so the idea of PvP doesn't interest me at all. But, finding other players to team up with, get help from (and help out) has been an absolute JOY! I have had so much fun teaming up to take down enemies, leaving behind goodies for newer players and just meeting/chatting with people who enjoy the experience as much as I do!  I am now a fan of online co-op play.
---
Its totally cool that you enjoy the game BUT im sorry friend, your one single anecdotal experience does not excuse everything Bethesda got wrong here, and you shouldnt expect everyone to be like "oh well at least SOME ppl like it!"
---
You live with these people and only these people. After 25 years, you‚Äôve either buried the hatchet or figured out how to generally avoid each other as much as possible. Or you already tried to kill them and went through whatever vault justice system is in place.
---
Remember, these aren‚Äôt huge cities. The vault has like 200-300 people. It is a small closed system.
---

My wife and I were at the Pleasant Valley train station. We're both level 30ish. This interestingly dressed level 150 woman Congress over and starts emoting for us to follow her. My wife mutes herself and days to me, "this is probably a trap but I'm intrigued". We follow this woman on a reasonable hour into the Backcountry. Eventually, she leads us to the pond where her awesome camp is set up. Three stories, metal building, fancy decorations, the works. We both marvel at the place and thank her for showing us. She beckons my wife over, hands her an awesome, level-approriate legendary gatling and 1000 rounds of ammo, and bids us good day. It is now my wife's favorite weapon. We friended get and still run into her from time to time.

---
Where is my tse t45 left leg
---
I'd love to play a Fallout game like that. It should have factions too.
---
read your own first comment and then ask yourself the same question
---
5 points luck attached and class freak a must to negate the downside of the mutations
---
They followed by having a friend who wasn‚Äôt involved spot for you. If you get persistent assholes like this just server hop or block for session everybody on the server.
---
I am aware of that but still does not help in that situation.
---
I know it's been tough for your group but the truth is that this game will die and your money will be lost if we continue bashing this game. 
---
We have created an industry where YouTubers and games journalists profit from writing about controversy. Most people write about stuff that happened back last year and that's means people won't buy a game that's vastly better than it was at launch. 
---
Sure we should still complain but at this rate Bethesda is just going to abandon 76 all together because it doesn't sell and no wants it to succeed. 
---
I sort of have this laissez-faire attitude about it.  I don't lock anything.  If you want to come and take my water, whatever.  It's not like I'm going to see you again tomorrow.  You are just the X factor of this particular session.
---
Some people, when faced with turrets, locks and other security, see it as a "challenge" to overcome.  By not having them (well, except a missile turret for the Ghoul problem), I'm basically signaling that I'm not interested in playing that game, and deny them their fun.
---
LOL and way to sound even more ignorant
---
Chiming in to say it's third person mode, but most comments already say that. ;)
---
Not needed, PA is basically the strongest defense in the game, unless you have some really good legendary armor pieces but even then PA is the only way to do nuke zones.
---
Reminds me of Destiny 1 where you'd turn in Legendary engrams and get nothing but rares. Those were dark days.
---
LMAO. I'm on the cliffs outside of WS boundaries. No reason to attack except high level dots not moving in one location &amp; they are close. Dunno. 
---
I dont expect that at all just like you shouldn't expect everyone to confirm with your views on it. I know alot of people who enjoy it and a lot that don't.  We are free to make our own opinions. 
---
I mean most peoeple just show up to the SBQ, just make sure your server as a moderate population of high level players, maybe hang out at the silo for a couple of minutes before you actually go down, ive gotten random team invites asking if i was going to launch a nuke. 
---
Personally I stopped playing on PC cause i got tired of reinvesting in upgrades only to have to keep reinvesting in upgrades....I like getting consistent game play for minimum investment, plus i find PC ends up being the Beta platform for most games these days. 
---
My character is in her 50s. But I like the idea.
---
You can also have a *lot* more than 24 people on a server in Minecraft. Persistence is possible. Modding is possible. And, quite frankly, I have no issue with privately hosted servers. *Bethesda* is the one with issues with that.
---
Honestly melee is the only viable option imo, I wish I could spec into guns but it'll have to wait
---
During my first few days playing, i noticed someone in my base. I wasn't aware of things at the time, so i assumed he was up to no good(Turrets were destroyed, but can't remember if he had a bounty). I was around level 12 at the time, and he was roughly 25. As i was approaching my base, i saw him start running. I said fuck that, and started firing at him. After roughly two minutes of us both failing to kill eachother, i ran out of ammo. I decided this had to end, and made my way to him while taking shotgun fire. I got close enough and broke LoS. I pulled out a pitchfork, and stabbed him in his stupid gut. I politely proceeded to teabag him while saying over mic, "This is what happens when you touch my shit."
---
to the dude getting the down votes who deleted his comment as i went to reply to it:  
---
millennials? i wish.. 47, been gaming since atari came out. played diablo 2 for 8 years, played final fantasy 11 for 12 years, got 3 years or so into fallout 4 with 6 lvl 100+ characters down each story line. more time in cod and halo than i care to remember. invited beta tester to final fantasy 14 and diablo 3.  am definately not new to gaming or game mechanics.
---
im sorry to have tweaked your nerve for whatever reason, but after this ignorant comment, i do hope you run into the same issue of chasing something for close to an hour before it finally flies up and hovers out of hit range and regenerates and just sits there..
---
Was running around with a new player, he was only about 11.  I was helping him get all the good points on the map.  We hit whitesprings and a level \~60 deaths head radscorpion jumps us.  He screamed like a girl and I could tell he dropped the controller.  I laughed soo hard that died to the scorp and did not care.

Appalachian **Courier** Service
---
I have a Quad Shotgun Tesla Rifle, but I never seem to get around to using it, my TSE gatling gun and Furious Explosive .50cal are just much more fun to use
---
Sorry. Pc. But doesn't this sub have a discord?
---
I know, I'm pointing that out to you.  You "claim" you like the PvP challenge, I'm now wondering if you just can't hack real PvP so you are here in FO 76 griefing and "calling" it PvP.
---
Yup. it's the game everyone, even people who haven't played it, love to hate. 
---
I think you summarized in a single word what would take me a paragraph to explain.
---
They need to just link PvP status with the area around the workshop. This is such a sloppy design I‚Äôm shocked it hasn‚Äôt been abused more heavily. Then again I haven‚Äôt bothered with workshops since the second week so maybe it is?
---
I just can't believe they talked about the pvp mode before xmas then just reiterated the same thing in late jan.
---
We're being strung along with bread crumbs.
---
I will say come feb 22 I'll be onto anthem so i couldn't care less now
---
same here, ive had tons of randoms that were both great friends and really big pains in the ass that didnt understand what "turn on pacifist mode" means
---
They need to at least take the drill from the legendary drop list.
---
I don't think anyone is interested in it, anyway.
---
It's going to be like, a half dozen edgy teenagers role playing raiders with each other.
---
Is that why the mole rats always get me on the rood of the Riverside Manor?
---
I hate that. 
---
I just ran away to the resort. :D
---
Good for you dude. Anthem isn't my cup of tea and EA can suck it, but that new Apex game is really good. 
---
I hope all games do better this year so all consumers can have a good time.
---
has to be the magazine then if not then its a bug maybe. Ive also had armor some times stay equipped when going into powerarmor. 
---
None of this is the fault of journalists or YouTubers who talk about the game. Those things have very little effect, and people only complain about them when the response is poor. Bethesda released a broken game, and people are responding accordingly. If they stop trying to fix their own game, how is that anyone's fault but their own? How can any of the responsibility be on anyone except Bethesda Game Studios? 
---
lol my luck with fatmans in this game is: aim, lean back a lil for more arch, pull trigger, nuke falls to my feet, i die..
---
You literally made a post asking people "whats the worst thing about this game?" 
---
And now youre complaining that people were complaining? Stop trying so hard to get gold and silver.
---
I'd think about it for sure if I weren't already Married to the most Amazing Man in the World who doesn't give a lick if his wifey is making spreadsheets on Cap Stashes!
---
Bethesda isn't going to nerf it for months 
---
Yeah I was just mad I couldn‚Äôt had a jet pack and a stealth boy on my X-01 so I thought Chameleonize it! 
---
Almost as ignorant as the person who supposes to thrust their personal definitions onto people as objective fact and then throw a hissy fit when called out on it.
---
I ran across a similar set-up at Billings Homestead last night. It's near my CAMP and I got the prompt to claim workshop. So I wander over and it's unclaimed but has been previously built. All 4 resource extractors set and powered via windmill with missile turrets on top. And the previous owner had built walls enclosing the workshop bench, with no door. They'd also locked everything at Level 0, almost like they were asking for someone to initiate PVP. 
---
It's like that's the example they used when coming up with their legendary loot spawn tables. We tried to burn rahool at the stake for it, who do we burn now?
---
explosive as in grenade launchers and fatman or you mean legendary effects. Either way yes to either.
---
There are some bottle cap mines in the wild, I can't remember where I just remembered running from the sound of tripping a mine then the familiar sound of the caps going every where, could even go back and loot them off the ground.
---
At least it's realistic.
---
really glad i am not the only one experiencing this, sorry for your luck on it as well.
---
&gt; **Half the people in this sub are only here to hate and complain.** 
---
I really wonder how that happened? OP is as smart as a door knob.
---
If I see a lock I will pick that lock, period.  If I end up wanted I‚Äôm destroying your camp/workshop.
---
Btw- You should never lock a purifier.  If you aren‚Äôt overloaded with purified water you are playing the game wrong.
---
Player followed me and a teammate because my teammate was a girl. She fast traveled away and then he found me. Started meleeing me and Screamed ‚ÄúGimme your helmet and I‚Äôll stop‚Äù. Fast traveled away and never saw him again. Avoiding pvp isn‚Äôt too hard
---
Dirt doesn't even matter with some roofs. I like to sit on the roof at Hemlock Holes Workshop while defending it and damn molerats will still burrow on the roof. 
---
sounds about perfect!
---
then people who actually WANT to PvP/grief can, and those who want to work together to achieve goals can do so in peace.
---
and if BethSoft refuses to do this, if pacifist mode simply made it so your base couldnt be destroyed and you couldnt take/do pvp damage it would solve alot of problems
---
I just started playing 7 days ago and as a low level player its like im a magnet for griefers.
---
I opened my base up to the public near flatwoods with tons of crops and crafting stations open to help new players, but my base has been destroyed 4 times in the 7 days ive been playing.  im about ready to give up even playing, making my base was a huge part of my enjoyment. 
---
That ain't vanilla. He used outside help! Cheater, I say...CHEATER!
---
Society didn't just happen accidentally; The majority of people don't like killing each other. We've actually evolved to avoid it. 
---
I am Level 104 and have received one explosive drop on my own.   I have found quite a few at vendors where people apparently didn‚Äôt check out all the stars before they sold, including explosive shotguns, Dragons, etc.  On the other hand, I have had literally hundreds of two-shot drops  
---
It‚Äôs the only one in the game it‚Äôs so rare I‚Äôll sell it to you for 25k caps.  I swear I‚Äôm not a duper!
---
I‚Äôm just waiting for the next regular fallout game. I‚Äôve enjoyed 76, but I much prefer being the lone wanderer with a grand story that you feel you are a part of.  This is fun to explore, but I don‚Äôt ever really feel like I‚Äôm actually contributing to reclaiming Appalachia. If they wanted to get to that feeling, persistent servers where you can build your base and make it grand and useful would go a long way. 
---
I got my money‚Äôs worth, I just don‚Äôt think this will be a long term play for me. 
---
The game is already dead dude. You dont need to read a newspaper or watch a video to see how shitty the game quality is or how lecherous the developers were with this release.
---
Bethesda needs to absolutely abandon 76 (te failed money printing project) and return to making quality and inspired content. 
---
Go to one tomorrow that you are 100% sure spawns there - and make sure you haven't touched it in 24 hours :)
---
Ohhhhh
---
the story we have isn't bad, a plague essentially has killed everyone after the bombs dropped. You have to stop it from spreading the rest of the wasteland. A lot of the smaller stories and quests are actually quite good too. And I think its better than fallout 4 quests and stories.
---
People I think complain mostly that the story lacks interactivity since everyone is dead, which makes it hard for the story to feel like your doing much. 
---
They already did ‚Äúnerf‚Äù those perks‚Äîneedlessly.  
---
Cool me too. January 29  patch notes say say they can no longer spawn. I guess spawn and drop are two different things.
---
Read up above and it's all spelled out :)
---
'He doesn't play to the crowd'. Aka: He doesn't throw out upvote-bait like 'DAE Fallout 76 is the best thing *evar*'

---
For just water, yea, I would have just let them. I only lock actual resource extractors. Don't mess with my acid! I really need that good stuff :D
---
the pathing for them seems to just look for dirt nearst to the player to make it pop up so it doesnt care if it couldnt get to you. 
---
Yes, that too!  Free caps.  But can a player actually find and use them in FO76?  I‚Äôm level 96 and never found any. 
---
People have been asking for Coop in Bethesda games for damn near a decade.
---
They do not understand what that means and respond as if we are asking for multiplayer (like fo76).
---
General question here: 
---
Does anybody actually believe that Bethesda thought through ANYTHING with this game?
---
I mean, when you start to actually dig into almost any part of this game it just falls apart within 15 minutes. 
---
I bet If this sub just picked on subject from the game each day we could pick apart how it doesn‚Äôt make sense in less than an hour. 
---
The development team have said in the past that they wanted to give a sense of danger and anticipation by having PvP in there, like you and your camp could be attacked at any moment.
---
Honestly I agree with you and think it would have worked better for the very vocal majority if it was strictly Co-Op and instead increased the number of wandering mobs to give the same effect.
---
well i got my camp on the other side of the map in the river, run 10 water purifiers, and also have a secondary mule accounts camp parked next to my mains camp since its a low lvl mob area for safety with its house built with another 10 purifiers.   
---
yes i have issues.. i dont like running out of water..
---
It all goes back to releasing an unfinished game. If they would have spent more time ironing out the game and making things work, then they would have been able to spend more time on new content and less time fixing shit that should never have been broken.
---
Only the latest mistake, they didn't learn from the previous ones.
---
&gt;Whoever the fuck programmed scorchbeasts needs to be fucking fired. 
---
People need to learn from their mistakes...with that said, I propose we shoot them out of a cannon after being tarred and feathered. Then blast them with airhorns while shining a very bright light in their eyes. 
---
Talk about civil. 
---
probably the guy that programmed skyrim dragons
---
&gt;Most of the tactics being used by griefers involve 2 or more working together to take advantage of Lone Wanderers
---
'Most of the tactics being used by PvPers involve teamwork'.
---
Watch out, people will claim that these are opinions! 
---
Was up by Grafton and got jumped by 3 of them and I‚Äôm level 93 with some decent weapons.  I took care of them but it was no joke.  They are tough SOBs for sure. 
---
Wow lucky you. This is my 2nd. Got a two star explosive black powder pistol.
---
They took their sweet time. They said I would get them in a few days in the middle of december, it took them over a month to actually add them to my account.
---
I am sure you'll get your atoms as well, but how soon you'll get them I don't know.
---
all i saw leading up to the release was a video talking about how you can bring your friends into the wasteland with you! team up and take back the wasteland!
---
and of course, EVERY fallout game before this was single player.  And they were immensely popular.  So all us single player fans of fallout who wanted co-op got excited for FO76.
---
they marketed the game towards single players who wanted co-op.  
---
This game is already Co-op with one of the worse pvp systems i have ever seen. Some of us are actually excited for the pvp mode and will be returning when it opens in beta.
---
That's how it is currently SUPPOSED to work but with bethesdas little twist of slap damage. They just suck at making things work properly so there are a million different ways to exploit it
---
You're right. It is Bethesda's fault. 
---
But that's just how capitalism works and the reality is that 76 hit piece videos do really well even when there isn't anything to report on. 
---
I'm also going to blame people that intentionally create an environment where the game will fail because they're driven by profit. 
---
I wouldn't be mad if they actually reported on new problems or contributed to the awareness campaigns of bugs, but they don't do that anymore. 
---
The last couple Kotaku, rock paper shotgun, and and juicehead content report on bugs that existed at launch and have already been fixed. That's just straight up misleading potential buyers into thinking it's still just as bad when it's definitely not. 
---
you can just go to the cog wheel on the blade menu and select "restart console" which does the same thing.  
---
you can also disable fastboot which will make your xbox really shutdown when you turn it off. 
---
Stash increased to 600.  Some bugs fixed but some also back.  PvP servers in March.  No word on new content.  Some changes to gameplay like all plans in shops and explosive perk nerfs.
---
That's the nutshell.  But it's better to read the patch notes of previous patches to see what has been changed
---
u/ladydevann
---
Also, they generally come out around 2pm EST
---
Is s concept not a thing? 
---
Is a dragon a thing?
---
Is a billion dollars on a credit card a thing?
---
yeah ive had only the option to respawn when i dided during pvp while being encumbered. with just Vault 76 as the only place i could go
---
Because there is no incentive to do it, there isn't even leaderboard. World of Warcraft removed PVP gear vendors at one point, now community is crying them to put them back. If H/H had PVP orientated gear rewards or some other unique reward, that can be only obtained via playing it, then I am sure people would play it.
---
Yeah play it more for the next time you can when you can, I should edit that a bit better. But it wasn't meant to be contradictory.
---
Agreed. If we are all survivors from the same vault why would we want to murder each other? 
---
Thanks. I also don‚Äôt grief.
---
Kinda vanilla preferred play style.
---
IDK dude, every server I go on has plenty of people. 
---
Why would someone even want to become wanted for stealing purified water. Anyone higher than level 5 should be able to make their own. Seems kinda stupid to steal purified water knowing you'll become wanted. I don't know! I leave my purifier open also. Take some water from me, who cares, it'll get replenished in 2 minutes. Uts not that big of a deal to me I guess.
---
Idc

Which perk increases damage of tesla rifle? Is it rifleman?
---
I can only imagine a full set of Unyielding power armor now...
---
Lol ok
---
Bloodbugs in FO4 give Cazadors a run for their money as they also have the crazy poison damage.
---
apparently radroaches spawn inside whitesprings now, i killed on near the north entrance on the 3rd floor.

This happened to me yesterday. Just trying to get a daily challenge done turned into 3 players constantly attacking me at a workshop that had no deposits set up by me or anything. To make it all worse, I leave and go to a different server just to get followed by the same guy and his friends. Really done doing workshops for now :/ 
---
I feel you mate... but at some point i get obsessed and after wasting so much time on it i feel i can‚Äôt give up and have to get it before Bethesda fix this and i have to pay an insane price for it
---
Cool thanks.
---
Is that typically impacted when Whitesprings is nuked?
---
Nuke zone?
---
I'm, level 170+ and I still haven't encountered the flat woods monster.
---
What is that ‚Äúsomething‚Äù?
---
It‚Äôs directly east of Watoga.  High level Deathclaw and the ants hang out there. Better come prepared with stims and decent weapons or you are screwed.  
---
Whom did I tell to do what exactly? Your statement itself is telling me to do something, So in effect you are becoming that which you accuse me of. How about you just go somewhere else.
---
Yes! The entire PVP possibility is unwanted from my POW. 
---
Fallout is awesome
---
Coop is awesome
---
Fallout 76 is a thing, in my book, because of coop, and IN SPITE of PVP/MMO. 
---
Oof ok that sucks. Maybe that is too extreme.
---
This was something I hoped would be a core component. Early on my wife and I were building camps in Toxic Valley and a random player started building near us and I was pretty excited about creating a little settlement against the wasteland but alas it twas not to be.
---
Fallout was never meant to be fully CG. Any fallout that is not claymation sprites is an epic fail.
---
I don't want to play Fallout 1/2 again.
---
Bottlecap mines and nuka quantum grenades were my favorite weapons in earlier games.  :(
---
let's hope they give us full information

---
Smart enough to realize the game today isn't as dumpster fire as at launch. Smart enough to realize that most of the people who hate on the game, within the sub, do this play or hardcore to the point where they don't represent the average consumer. 
---
Yes. Frankly bugs aside, I feel like them implementing PVP is there source of most of the problems of this game. Fallout wasn't meant to be PVP games. All that happens when you implement PVP is that you have to balance around it and balancing around PvP with fallout weapons just makes every enemy a bullet sponge, and makes the most powerful weapons feel like pea shooters.
---
I always wanted a multiplayer fallout game but what this should have been was co-op versus environment. Small groups of people versus all the classic enemies - feral ghouls, super mutants, raiders, robots, creatures, etc.
---
and as others have mentioned it would match much better with the story that they're trying to tell. The idea of coming out of the vault on reclamation day to try and repopulate and restore the wasteland should be a cooperative experience. It makes no sense that we're all fighting each other.
---
Once, way up in the north of the map past that family cabin, level 40 (I think that's fabled prefix?). There's also an unmarked world wonder replica but I won't spoil it.
---
FWIW I have seen Mothman more than the Flatwoods monster.
---
Some Fallout fans paid attention to more content than an E3 clip.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IDLGUO7zXk Talk about PvP around 45 mins or so.
---
With 20% weapon weight reduction and +1 strength lol 
---
With regards to the mainframe cores, I keep the damaged ones if my team or myself manages to find new ones. After a nuke event, I can craft new mainframe cores at my camp and carry them with me to another silo. Saves a bit of time.
---
r/decontaminationshowerthoughts
---
fix your build
---
YES üíñüíñ
---
Realistically, Pittsburgh is not to far from WV, specifically the area we're playing in. This would be interesting.
---
I wish my friends and I could combine our camps. Something like a 25% increase to budget and size of camp per player on your team. If you do that then if you log in solo your camp won't be placed but if you log in with your group it does. 
---
I'm struggling to log in these days... if it weren't for the friends I've made playing I'd be long gone.  I adapted to the rifle nerfs, I adapted to the workshop nerfs... hell I've adapted to all of it.  I just kept rolling with the punches, and honestly I could keep rolling with the punches that continue to come.  But, the loot issue... If I do an event with 3 friends, it takes on average about 7 mins to complete the event... usually because thats the event timer.  But Then I have to spend 20mins waiting for loot to load and the event completion notification to come in... this is absolutely horrid.  The last thing I had to do in the game was hunt for things... and it's not been nerfed, it's just been broken.
---
The most fun I've had since patch 5 hit was last night when I smashed some guys whitesprings golfclub camp with a chainsaw.  I was just gonna crash the turrets, but he started acting a fool, so I smashed the whole camp and chainsawed him till he logged out.
---
I don't feel good about it, but I don't feel bad about it either.  Smashing camps isn't something I'd call fun... but building a golfclub camp to steal kills and mess up spawns is infuriating.  But, it had me thinking... thats the last thing that still "just works" in the game.
---
I've never initiated pvp with another player
---
I've never duped or used exploits
---
I've never stolen anyones loot from their death bag
---
I've never contemplated quitting the game despite the bugs because I'm hoping all our feedback and complaints helps bsg get things fixed. 
---
I've never locked my camp, and purposely built it for others to use.
---
I've never figured out the armor in this game. I dont know what's "best" or how to get mods for armor. I've played 3 and 4 multiple times but I cant wrap my head around the armor in 76. 
---

There was one other with him who I also blocked. I saw both, both saw me, only one followed me around. I didn't change server because I said, "I guarantee you'll get bored of this before I do." I was partly right - the server disconnected me.
---
** SIDE NOTE ** 
---
If you do the powering up quest at the plant it gives you power to use at that workstation and automatically powers up the cores machine 
---
On PS4, but I‚Äôve found plans and weapons in that suitcase before. 
---
Would imagine the same for Xbox. 
---
The brick building with all the street lamps on the second story exterior? If that‚Äôs your place it looks really cool. 
---
So much better.
---
This went from 0 to "cut your penis off" in like 3 seconds...jesus christ...
---
Ants are bad, the crickets are even worse. They just eat vats crits for breakfast it just fuels their fury.
---
Because they're bored, that's it. Once you reach the endgame, oh wait there isnt one, then you having nothing to do or work towards. Grinding legendaries in this game is more painful than grinding them in any other game I've ever played, so most people get burned out on it or just dont bother. Or once you have all the gear you want then there really is nothing to do other than harass other players. This games content system is absolute shit
---
I've gotten the warning 4 times total and every time no one was at my spot. 
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right. It would. And you could set up yours for PVP FFA / Teams, while I‚Äôd set up mine for Carebear PVE Coop only and PW it, so only my personal best friends could join it. 
---
Perfect. 
---
Exactly, there are at least 5 high profile AAA games releasing in the next 3 weeks, two of which are post apocalyptic themed (Far Cry and Metro) as well as an online multiplayer loot shooter (Anthem). 
---
76 is going to be pretty much abandoned inside 3 months, aside from the most hardcore of the hardcore. 
---
I've used them, they can hold a limited amount of stuff. 
---
Yes! It will be out shortly.
---
I'm indifferent I guess. I've actually had some positive experiences with strangers building me things or giving me items but also negative ones with assholes 50 levels higher than me taking my work bench or supply drops. 
---
Online play can bring out the worst in people when there aren't enough consequences for being a dick. At least in Fallout they're mostly just annoying and don't do much damage, in Red Dead Online any idiot with nothing to do can just one shot you for the lulz.
---
Yes the salt in here is nice. Thanks for pointing out exactly what I was saying. A load of spoiled people with too much time on their hands bitching about not having enough content. Someone says hey slow down a bit and play the game at a slower pace and I get ridiculed. Thanks for pointing out EXACTLY what I was saying. You all performed wonderfully.
---
And what if the next time I can is 'right now'. Should I stop anyway so that I can enjoy it some time in the future instead?
---
i always leave stuff i dont want in the cash register at the vendors.  i never know if people take it or it disappears after awhile but i hope someone notices extra ammo, plans  and junk sits there.
---
Hopfully 
---
I'm a huge fan of this game. But it's like a toddler. I love it, but damn it requires incredible patience. You'll not often (if ever) see me get so frustrated as to get on this subreddit and make a public complaint, though there are times where i've had to force myself not to.
---
I understand server disconnects, they're part of an online game. But in a game where disconnects can reset quest progress, and we can establish CAMPs and Workshops but they leave after we disconnect (or get disconnected), making sure disconnects happen as little as possible seems it should be an upmost priority. Bethesda has also been remarkably stupid in their PR lately, shitting the bed at every possible turn. I don't even need to elaborate on this one. It would be one things if they kept a direct line of contact, and kept weekly fixes rolling out. But they don't.
---
I love this game. I'm a level 70 on my main and i'm taking my time. Like 2 levels ago I joined the BoS. I'm kept busy for plenty long exploring. But we need to hammer out the issues with this game as soon as they can fix them, because we need to keep moving forward. An incredible amount of higher-level people have absolutely nothing to do.
---
I immediately thought of r/showerthoughts when I read the title, we're clearly on the same wavelength
---
Block then server hop..
---
It happens. Weapons, Aid, and Ammo (?) are still randomized. I got an Instigating Lever Action for ~200 caps from Watoga. Those are still fun to hunt for. 
---
most people i know of leave them at the oversears camp, or in the cash registers of the robot vendors.
---
I have come here to chew bubble gum and read patch notes, and I'm all out of patch notes.
---
&gt;One major thing I liked about 76 was that it wasn't as persistent as an Ark server, my base would be constantly destroyed while I'm offline by other factions. That's even further away from a bethesda/fallout game imo, I don't think many people want that. Events, content, and everything will get better with time. 
---
yeah. and just an expansion to FO4, and not the mess we got. 
---
1. Your first response makes no sense. Safe spaces are special subgroups made to hide from harsh public opinion and harsh realities. This is the FO76 channel, a rare specimen, and even that turned against the game last patch.
---
2. You randomly insulted the TC with off-topic attacks that not only make no sense, but no way you could prove. That is an ad-hominem.
---
3. It's the Fallout 76 section, not Fallout section. They wrote this flop off months ago. As did most gaming communities. Lol 50%.
---
I wouldn't mind having a look and I have a 3‚òÖ instigating sledge can't remember the other effects right now but my GT mcphail818 I'll be online in about 5 hours.
---
The only part that bothers me about them is the sound and vibration. So I go to settings , turned off vibrate, turned down effects . Anti armor 50. Cal them flying rats.
---
NO U!
---
Worked like a charm. Thank you so much üòä
---
i turn them all on!
---
oh thank you!
---
Awesome! 
---
;3 Only one of has the truly witty response. I guess it is true, the best lines are always in the comments.
---
I'm not saying Anthem will be better than FO76 or passing any early judgements but...
---
[https://i.redd.it/s9skbmwpvze21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/s9skbmwpvze21.jpg)
---
...publishing a roadmap before the game is released at least tells me they have a plan for their live service game and are ahead of Bethesda.
---
 Three months deep and hundreds of requests later we still have no roadmap for FO76.
---
You missing two big reasons:
---
1) getting wanted statues is the only way to actually enter PvP mode in this game (destroying camps is the only way to get high bounty)
---
2) earning caps - you get high bounty people will attempt to one shot you for reward (if you have PvP gear they will do no DMG to you) then it will flag this person for PvP you kill it for caps. 5-10k caps a day makes any raider happy üòÖ.
---
Can you post the worst AAA release?  I didn't see any other game score 50% average.
---
&gt;I'm also going to blame people that intentionally create an environment where the game will fail because they're driven by profit.
---
I already addressed this, but again: you're massively overstating the impact of YouTubers and journalists. Most people don't care about that stuff. The game will not fail (or succeed) based on a handful of articles and videos, they are basically irrelevant - especially for a giant franchise like Fallout. The failure of the game provides no material benefit to anyone you mentioned - in fact, Bethesda YouTubers like JuiceHead need the game to succeed in order to continue getting hits. Their interest is literally the opposite of what you suggest it is. 
---
Bethesda are the ones who control the game and its content, if people react poorly to the numerous bugs, that's Bethesda's fault. If you're mad at the messengers for spreading the word about the bugs in Fallout 76, well, that's your issue. 
---
Hahahahaha
---
just figured if they were borked (since ive never seen anything in them, despite everyone saying they drop stuff all the time) id have to arrange meeting up with someone that might want the stuff. 
---
Gone for months... Did you quit during the beta?
---
Pc I'm afraid
---
Nailed it.
---
Literally what I'm doing right now. I quit playing after the first patche or 2 indicated they were going to be focused on nerfing everything rather than fixing this broken ass game.
---
3 months later it's nice to know I walked away at the beginning of the nerfs.
---
I don't know about you, but if you prioritize hitting two out of the four propellers it stays stationary there, regardless of the location of the vertibots. You can hammer the vertibots down and it may as well just to fucky and fly away to another region like it usually does. So that's my tip for your next try
---
Stability depends on Bethesda... o.O
---
Only approved mods... boring.
---
But still better than nothing. Question is if it will actually arrive or if the game gets sidelined long before any such thing is ready?
---
I‚Äôd love to sneak a peek at some stats of how many people are active in/on fo76. 
---
I have a feeling it‚Äôs dropping fast. 
---
But I don‚Äôt know. 
---
I agree, I like taking my time too, it just seems like a lot of people blast through it and then want more
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 93 and earlier had my camp attacked and destroyed 3-4 times earlier in game before I could mod up and gear up to better defend it or myself.  People usually don‚Äôt fuck with me anymore but I don‚Äôt go looking for it and got a lot more strategic and secluded where I set up my camp locations. I also don‚Äôt spend a lot of time there as you have players that are only out there to mess with or grief others.  It does feel good though to destroy the cocky or arrogant player that is totally overmatched.  
---
Actually YOU shouldn't, You don't seem very nice.
---
So people should be punished for playing how bethesdas says they can play? Your solution isnt going to teach people a lesson. Its overkill and will make people just quit playing the game. If you dont like it then block everyone on the server and put your base where nobody will find it. Make your own little safe space cupcake
---
You don't drop your explosive vents in there after every single queen run? On PC I see spare plans in there nearly every single time. Almost always leave something in there. Didn't realize the register was a container for some reason until recently. 
---
It's a travesty that your initial comment isn't higher up
---
Cool, you saw the "heat waves"! I was beginning to think I was crazy! Good to know that others also noticed!
---
Ah, the drug den. I have absolutely no idea! It resembles those crazy real-life cults with their mass suicide. Maybe they needed to die so they could join the "thing"? Someone said that the "thing" fed on blood... I don't know, but I really hope it gets expanded with the DLC!
---
We can't all live in fantasy land forever lol.
---
im surprised more players dont use defensive strategy when placing their camps.  currently i placed my camp appliance thing in a tree so its hidden from other players and i built around an existing trailer with a workbench, cooking station and radio already inside that cant be destroyed.  add ur own armor bench bed and banjo inside the trailer and uve got a nice camp, no one could tell was a players camp.  also sneak so u arent on the map
---
Game released on Nov 14th, quit around beginning of December. Gone for all of December and January, months.
---
Always do.
---
Right? Always late to the party. :P
---
Welcome to fallout 76
---
I would rather 76 not be like rust, conan, or ark.
---
yeah...um, not everyone spends hours pouring over interviews, most just watch a quick promo, not something we have to wait 45 minutes to hear about lol
---
most people have lives, families, without time to sink hours into researching every aspect of a video game before it comes out.
---
And like i said, millions of people only knew FO for the single player experience 
---
Darn, well I can upload a video!
---
Yes - but they won't be playing it for PvP itself, they'd be playing it simply for the loot.  There's no point to having PvP in this game, just that its forced on us by their misguided ideas to try to jump on the Fortnite bandwagon.
---
That, and probably a new bug with blood worms, boosting stat boosts.
---
That's great info, thanks!
---
One reason cap stashes might not be where you expect is that even though they're containers now, the physics engine treats them as junk/other world objects. So explosions or even just walking into them can knock them out of place and send the flying.
---
Bethesda: ‚ÄúWe hear you, and we will be disabling all co-op in the future. Thank you for your feedback.‚Äù 
---
No, but that does sound cool.  
---
I have a standard wood, two-storey, one of each workbench downstairs, with a PA setup, a pump for dirty water, and 12 small purifiers.  Half these are locked, the rest open to all comers. 
---
Working on getting a decon station so people can stop by during Whitespring nukes if they don't have Enclave access.
---
There are 8-12 of each type of cultivable plant there for food.
---
Are you still playing and enjoying yourself? Have you always had some stuff to do?
---
I'd like to get back into it at some point, I just don't want my Settlement randomly getting deleted, or having horrible lag due to ppl exploiting inventory caps, stuff like that...
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I think the general story of FO76 is crap, but plausible. Look at shows like Walking Dead or the movie The Road. Another good example is The Last of Us. 
---
How long is it before humanity becomes it's own worst enemy again in the lawless wilds. What's stopping John from killing Jim for taking Jane. Even though John never made a move.
---
For the concept of a video game, it just needs more work.
---
I will look for lower level player(1-4) and just gift them stuff I dont need especially shit I can't sell. I give purified waters, duplicate recipes, ammo, even low level weapons I don't use. I remember being that level 2 player that was freaking out because I only had dirty water to drink (not even boiled). Lol
---
You're right it's worse than launch because they nerfed everything that was fun to do originally lol.
---
You seem to shit talk people for talking about stuff they dont know then you start talking about comparing your experiences to how the game started, despite not having played when it released.
---
You're a hypocrite and not a very bright one as others have mentioned.
---
I hate to restate things but her resistances scale with the amount of players there. I don't know what the range is on that but it seems quite large. With the lack of people playing lately I saw one person nuke fissure prime and on their own. I went along and we took her down just the two of us. They seemed to be burst damage so either sniper or VATS crit but I was relying on my full heavy build with armour piercing .50 cal that also has 25% faster firing. Throw in a few damage buffs and we tore through her in a few minutes.
---
Sorry, this turned into a somewhat humble brag. If you have the people doing damage consistently you will take her down. If you have people doing nothing standing around or more of them than those able to do damage you will have a very hard time. Anything to reduce her armour and keep her grounded (disable wings in VATS if you can) will help a lot.
---
True, I'm CONSTANTLY seeing posts about pve players crying for the pvp players get put somewhere else. I hardly ever see anything from actual pvp players
---
&gt;Problem is, gamers being gamers, how many will blow through almost any new content in a day?
---
This is a challenge that any development studio that is in the 'live service game' business should be equipped to handle. A challenge that is addressed by having repeatable content with a satisfying gameplay/feedback loop in it. You can never put out enough 'new' content to keep people busy so you need to produce repeatable content that players can latch onto. Good examples of this are old school (~WotLK-era) World of Warcraft, Path of Exile, Counterstrike. They all have something about them that allows players to do the same thing over and over again without coming back to the devs demanding new stuff.
---
Raiders gonna raid. Best advice is to be prepared.
---
Pea shooter is op af, especially Electro Pea... Just get gud :/
---
Good to know, thanks for the reply. :)
---
A concept is not a thing, as it is not physical.  A dragon is not a thing, because it does not physically exist. A billion dollars on a credit card is not a thing, it is an agreement to create value from nothing.
---
When you ‚Äúsell‚Äù a virtual item, you are selling nothing real. Nothing tangible. Nothing that exists. Nothing real.
---
Virtual items are nothing more than a mutual agreement to assign value to access to data.
---
I had a random show up at my camp (very obscure location), wander around for 10 minutes making heart gestures at all my cat paintings, and then ask me to help come make them a bunch of their own at their camp.  The legend of Mr. Pebbles will never die.
---
Same reason. If it wasn‚Äôt for the friends I have made in the game I would not still be here.
---
At 104 I have had 3 encounters with 2 kills mostly in the far south of the divide area
---
I found (and by found i mean tripped them) some in one of the power plants during one of the power up events. Don't know of they are always there, as i usually don't go in there outside of an event.
---
The launcher forgot where the game was installed. I reinstalled twice, and it done it a 3rd time. 
---
Thats it for me for a long time.. the games a hot mess. 
---
I wanted this to be good, i tried to keep faith, but... 
---
Terminals can already be locked!
---
I use my locked terminal to open/close my garage door. Strangers would need hacking lvl 3 to get inside. But it only works with ugly wiring. I need a simple double sided conduit that can be placed freely on a wall letting the current flow!
---
And the terminals that are alread in the game should be available!
---
I use them all the time on Xbox. The overseers camp and containers near vault 76 get my ammo and plans, the level 30 and up stuff goes in a suitcase at Watoga station and I use the cigarette machine at Sutton station for random stuff as well.
---
For me, in a nutshell the thing that made me quit was all of the DC's when I was trying to re-build my camp a few weeks ago. I just got frustrated after trying several times in a row for several weeks, and kept getting DCed.
---
Thank you for your feedback. I agree Bethesda PR has been a dumpster fire and should be improved. There is work to be done for sure. I hope you can enjoy the game and look forward to what is hopefully a better future. 
---
I'm only level 42 rn, a little more than a casual player imo, so I have yet to feel that late game boredom. I want to point out that this sub has a disproportionate amount of super hardcore players compared to other communities which is why we see so many people complaining. 
---
I hope they get some more stuff to do soon. 
---
'I don't want to do research on a product before buying it but I expect the product to be what I want it to be'
---
Yeah...um.
---
I suspect the mode is more so the backend workings for private server settings. A "might as well make an official server, we're making the tools for others to do it anyways" PvP mode.
---
I try to wring the 200 caps out of every vendor and end up in Watoga as the last one.  I dump any plans, extra scrapped junk, and ammo I have in the cash register... sometimes I've got an extra nuclear key card to throw in there too.  I like to think someone is getting some use out of the stuff I literally can't do anything else with.  By putting it in that cash register, anyone going to the vendor might reasonably pan past the register and see the stuff as they're about to initiate trade.    
---
Or, if I find someone else's CAMP and they're home, I'll just drop it in front of it as a door prize and inform them they've won the Great Appalachian Sweepstakes.
---
Teams and PvP have a bunch of stupid little exploits 
---
Excavator with calibrated shocks as has been mentioned. Get a full set of it and keep it on you at all times. It only weighs 10 in your inventory and will mean you don't need to switch your armour to farm nuke zones. It isn't too good in terms of ballistic and energy damage so if you want that and decent radiation protection go for T-60 with calibrated shocks.
---
How would one go about getting fireproof on their PA?
---
I feel this pain as I predominately play alone.
---
I‚Äôm always watching the map and if someone is close I‚Äôm wary.
---
I don‚Äôt often get attacked and I‚Äôve put my CAMP in a pretty remote location to prevent attacks.
---
Do you have yours located in a generally prime spot? Like somewhere with lots of flat ground and a river? Most times I‚Äôve seen people go after people‚Äôs CAMPs because of the particular general location is popular for them. 
---
Maybe rather then nerfing guns altogether, they could nerf the damage they do vs players.
---
Example: TSE.
---
When attacking creatures/enemies, does the full damage like it used to.
---
When attacking a player, it does the nerf damage it does now. 
---
They could have the damage values fade in and out like they did with base damage and damage per second in FO:NV in your Pip-Boy.
---
Far Cry: New Dawn and Metro: Exodus both come out next weekend. Both are post apocalyptic themed. The Metro games in particular have a lot in common with Fallout aesthetically and inventory/resource management wise as far as managing ammo/cash/gas mask filters etc. 
---
Both will be replacing 76 for me for at least a couple months. 
---
Lmao yup that's exactly what I do. Which is why I rightly called you an asshat. Play your Frozen soundtrack and let it go
---
It has gone toxic in the wake of the last screwed up update.  It has brought out the worst in many people.  People didn't like that their super weapon wasn't so super any more, and that anger spilled into issues like the idiotic bobby pin relapse and other issues.  
---
The mob is a fickle beast, bread and circuses are what they want, and right now Bethesda is serving them crusty pita and a kids roundabout.  
---
If you're in Shady Sands, come see me.
---
Seriously they need to just admit their silly ‚ÄúPvP‚Äù system is a waste, hurry up and make their PvP mode and then turn off all PvP for ‚ÄúAdventure‚Äù mode. It‚Äôs pretty obvious they were woefully unprepared for this and their ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt grief in FO76!‚Äù was pathetic empty bravado. They failed to a comedic level on the PvP mechanics side.
---
Which VATS abilities in Luck/Agility are best? Sounds like Gung Fu and at least 1 point in Adrenaline are critical. When trying to add all the Luck/Agility VATS abilities, I still run out of points:

this.  ive been waiting for survival mode since beta.  maybe we should stop playing until its released /s
---
NPC says what?
---
I think what Granny is sayin', and correct me if I'm wrong, is that sometimes you'll walk up to a caps stash and there won't be a search option listed.  So if you walk away and then come back, the search option will appear.
---
Rather an asshat than a sheep.
---
Saw it once by the prison and the second time was when we were fighting the SBQ.
---
But 76 has npc‚Äôs...and I am sure more will be added with the updates.
---
Unless by npc, you really mean one that follows you around so you can pretend it is your girlfriend...:)
---
Dank
---
Fireproof is a perk, under Endurance.  My bad, should have been clearer.
---
Not to be snide but who is still expecting big things from fallout 76? 
---
so you expect every normal person to wait 45 minutes to hear that bit of info?
---
that is normal to you?
---
i think you have waaaay too much time on your hands

Will my safe space have crayons and puppies?

She should have never dated the raider.  But she mistook his witless confidence for competence.   And she thought she could change him.    But then she caught him griefing.    And then when he stopped answering his pipboy during lunch on Valentines Day she suspected cheating.  But she never imagined it would be Grahm!   No moo moo should ever have had to see that‚Äînor should she.   But a Bloodied the Bobbit Machete skin would slake her thirst for justice.  As would a bunch of awesome hot pink stuff at the Atom Store.  Bethesda, hot pink = a wave of twenty dollar bills normally only observed at the Spearmint Rhino when hosting all errant Saudi princes and every up-and-coming rap star all in one evening.   Hot pink means F76 metrics and KPIs for this quarter are satisfied.    MOAR HOT PINK!!!!
---
Where is this?
---
I'm not sure exactly how PA works.  I have hundreds of points of armour on mine, and a f\*ck\*ng mole rat will eat away at my health.  
---
Really?  Solid steel can't stop mole rat teeth?    
---
Still, I have never had to repair any of my armour...
---
Did they say it wasn't coming out, or has it just not come out yet?  Thought it was usually later in the day?
---
I tried to create and play a second character but it's such a chore. Instead of using fast travel I have to crawl to places and despite being about level 15 I have not gotten a single charisma perk card and only a few that I'd want to use in general. Throw in the thought of some of those awful, awful quests and I haven't touched him (not that way!) for over a week.
---
&gt;But still better than nothing.
---
This means at least two important things. Private servers will cost money. And the mods will not be able to change anything significant ‚Äî it will be impossible to modify the server code. So it will be textures, models, etc.
---
Hell if I know. I'm pretty sure they just tried to make FO4 multiplayer and the NPCs were bugging out with having more than one protagonist character to deal with so they scrapped them all and decided it'd be a feature to have no NPCs. There's a lot of not right going on here.
---
I actually had a level 40 guy attack my camp when I was there and it was like ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù  I‚Äôm cool with people using my benches and cooking stations or just hanging out.  I‚Äôm not cool with you just stirring the pot and if you make a move it‚Äôs on.  That can be fun as well especially if others join in the fray.  I had one wanted dude that we teamed up on and worked over for like 30 minutes all over the board because he walked into the golf club and started acting like an idiot shooting at everyone- enemies or not.  Too funny 
---
Since you are playing with friend, maybe if one person logs in, it brings up the whole shared camp?  I just think the sim wasteland aspect would be so fun. 
---
sorry
---
It‚Äôs a 3 rank endurance perk that you can pick when you level up.
---
I've played ~150 hours (PC) and I've only run into people that wanted to PVP a handful of times and a few of those times was for a bounty on someone in my group.
---
I'm fine with the game having PVP for the people that want it but the game has so many other problems that it's just *another* thing they need to balance/fix. I thought PVP would be a major part of the game, which generally I would like, but it's just so poorly done and basically in the game as a 2nd thought.
---
It‚Äôs not a massive world and there‚Äôs not thousands of people on a server. 
---
For those who are like OP and haven‚Äôt played an MMO before. 
---
Massive means you could spend a real world day trying to go across it on foot. WoW and DAoC are my experience and I poured soooooo much time into them and scratched the surface of those worlds and the gameplay within them. 
---
This is an online adventure game. 
---
Yeah, I feel you on the "obsess" part. I'd been chasing them for weeks. Oh, check the Watoga train station vendor too - I have occasionally seen X-01 mods pop up there also. Good luck!
---
Some "holders" will accept only one item, or a certain weight.  
---
Varies wildly.
---
Unequipped is what I meant yea, after just about every fast travel.. gotta go into pip boy and re equipt them.
---
NV had great writing and characters, but you could tell a mile away that Obsidian just didn‚Äôt have the same experience making this kind of open word: there are definite issues of content density, distribution and navigation. 
---
I would be more pist if they abandoned it. It would be an even bigger waste of money. At least if they continue to try and fix the problems it will get better.  
---
Yeah Bethesda‚Äôs silly PvP system is rudimentary and flawed. They jumped into it thinking they could do it and it‚Äôs predictably amateurish and unplaytested. Well, was unplaytested before release ;)
---
And what I meant was they had a friend teamed up but hanging out halfway across the map, constantly checking the map to see where you were and telling them where to go. You‚Äôd have no idea this dude was their friend cause to you he‚Äôd be just another dot at Whitesprings or Flatwoods.
---
i was aiming for the propellers/engines. granted im not a pro at this game but i have 30+ nuke key cards on me, not my first rodeo with em by a long shot.  
---
what irritated me was it never stopped to hover, it kept circling and moving until the end and then it was out of gun range to a 204 range weapon from the cliff and from the ground. even when it was circling the tower and i was on the roof it only circled in long enough for one, maybe two vats hits or a shot at a chance to hit a propeller.   
---
i hit this thing about once every 3 minutes for about 45-50 minutes trying to get it to either stop/hover or get closer to it i could use other weapons.   
---
a lil background on me. i am lvl 199.. 570 some hours into the game, anytime i see a cargobot i go for it because i will either launch nukes or my friends will from time to time hit me up for one because they know i carry a ton of em. i also always carry about 5 on me when i run into a lower level asking for help to run a silo and more often than not put in the wrong code and lose a card i have one on me to give them to try again.  
---
i know the strats for killing these things, i know how they usually react.. what to look for what to hit..   
---
this one did everything its for lack of a better statement "not supposed to" 
---
because it costs more in caps to travel than u get as a reward for winning. if i kill 6 other players and just lose 60 caps and ammo, it doesnt incentivize doing it more.  however it was more fun than any other end game content that there is to offer.  just wish it was incentivized 
---
They said it is coming out later today.
---
A few weeks ago at the One Violent Night event.  Eight people showed up.  Every instrument on stage was being played and the remaining players danced and had a moshpit going in between ghoul waves.  It was pretty fun.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ao518g/no_inside_the_vault_today/efy7do4
---
It‚Äôs just later in the day. The last one wasn‚Äôt until 1:30 EST.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get it.  Setting up camp outside of fhe golf club takes the fun out of it farming ghouls and such.  
---
If you got a fancy base...imma pop in and turn lights on, open doors, and hop in your bed. It‚Äôs my twisted little way of showing you I checked out your work!
---
But apparently you likely don‚Äôt see it :(
---
There is a bug with adrenaline card if you take it off for 30s when your adrenaline is active and then put back on you have permanent 60% dmg and you can repeat it as many times as you like for crazy dmg.
---
There is as well another bug involving rad worms that makes you unkillable (but I don't know details).
---
Just little bugs to make players happy after tse nerf üòÖ
---
I expect every *reasonable* person to not be surprised or indignant when a product is exactly as advertised just because they didn't take the time to check the advertising before buying.
---
Fireproof 3 makes scorchbeasts so much more tolerable.  
---
And yet we have been at war for almost the entire recorded history of our species.
---
Was just a thought from an old gamer 20 years of rifts and AD&amp;D
---
It can have whatever you want. I'll go find some paper for you to color on, please dont use the puppies as a canvas
---
&gt;	Felt like this wasn't a real Fallout game.
---
Fuck the gatekeepers of what ‚Äúreal Fallout‚Äù should be. 
---
Thanks but i mean the only times ive picked one up i got nothing, not even a cap. 
---
His a tip for you, to deal with them. 
---
1. Place concrete foundation as high out of the ground as possible. 
---
1. Ring the top of the foundation with punji boards on all sides. This requires 10 punji boards, 2 long ones and 8 short ones. 
---
1. Place two turrets of your choice on opposite corners from each other. 
---
1. Finally fill the other two corner with punji boards leaving just a small space in the middle for you to stand. 
---
You now have a Rad Scorpion defensive position because the punji boards will screw use there AI and make it considerable easier to kill em. Remember to blueprint the entire the foundation so you can create them when your in a rush. 
---
&gt;Not to be snide
---
It is deliberate
---
&gt;who is still expecting big things from fallout 76
---
People to a subreddit devoted to the game. I bet you are hoping as well; otherwise you'd have used your precious time elsewhere.
---
Yes. Even when it's modded to be a "Tesla Shotgun".
---
Put in some cool cosmetic paints/plans is one way, adds "bragging" rights!
---
I don't think gaming outlets need the article dollars to succeed, but if you don't think they'll rewrite an article they released two months ago just to make $100 then you don't know how desperate these affiliate writers are. 
---
Juicehead on the other hand is one of many YouTubers who needs fallout to exist yes, but chooses to profit in the short term through controversy. All I'm asking it to look at these YouTubers views and see that they are definitely doing better in times of controversy. I'm not arguing whether they need this to be successful. 
---
I think we have disagreements about how big a role influencers play into sales. I believe the consumers have changed and rely much more than they did in the past, on information than band strength. 
---
Clearly we disagree but I do appreciate your discussion. 
---
Ohhh so edgy. Great comment üëå your such a cool brooding loner when I grow up I wanna be just like you. Go ahead and tell me everything that's wrong with society and how no one gets you.
---
I probably won‚Äôt be then. I usually on early morn. I will hold onto it. I‚Äôm in now tho. 
---
No radworms or consumables.  Noticed it was 585, then continued on to kill a few super-mutants, opened my inventory to drop some missiles I had inadvertently picked up and noticed it was now 655!
---
Took nothing, didn't exit my PA - just moved around Harper's Ferry
---
Comes out on Wednesdays, so...
---
I think half of the problems with 76 could be solved if there were different servers to choose from. Make it like Ark, where you could choose from public PvP or PvE servers, as well as the option to make private servers. NOT just random servers that Bethesda slaps you in.
---
You just have to get lucky with the legendary drops, there is no real place where you could go to get a definitive spawn location for a legendary hunting rifle.
---
The solution is to bash with the weapon. 
---
This will pull you out of it.
---
And then we got half baked BS plot that tries to sell us on everyone being dead and yet fresh bodies are scattered everywhere. 
---
This game just annoys me with how obvious of a cash grab it is. Those dead bandit bodies are almost certainly F4assets they didn‚Äôt want to remake. 
---
This game is just frustrating to me because I know how good a FO76 style game COULD be. 
---
It‚Äôs not like people don‚Äôt want this game concept in the Fallout universe. We just don‚Äôt want a shitty asset grab with zero effort out into it. 
---
I mean Rust, DayZmod, 7dtd, Connan, Ark, Mortal, DAoC, Xsyon.... there are WAAAAAAAAAY harder survival games out there.
---
Shit that even new world game from Amazon is gonna be a almost full loot game with nakeds running around. 
---
I have the perk and I have a TSE 50cal and I tryed about every gun I have but still no chance 
---
Sweet I love crayons and puppies. Finally something awesome to do in this game
---
Same... it soooothhhes my inner hoarder to think someone will use the stuff. I just don't think about what happens if the server crashes before someone walks by it...
---
someone can be playing pvp cuz they enjoy it, and also get something from it.  instead of it just being fun at the cost of caps/ammo.  i just want my travel cost back as a reward for killing all the other players, or something so i want to keep doing it without losing all my caps over the course of a day.
---
Then everybody would moan about how you can't play all the content alone, without a group.
---
I disagree. Its like a sale on murder. Sometimes you really want something, say a new flat screen tv. But you can't justify paying 2000 dollars for it. Then one day it goes on sale for 200 dollars, and you leap to buy it.
---
Same thing with murder. Life sentences/death penalty is like that really high cost, and an unpoliced wasteland is like the sale.
---
Do you by chance have the BoS mods for combat armour? Looking for the whole set.
---
I do not like the idea of fragmenting an already dwindling player population because it limits the design space the game team has to work with. There have been a number of suggestions on how to make the PvP system better; [here is one of them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djsNSmuRLbpNgyZauhhRQPl3lTSKv6NpKvjPbUPSETM/edit) that's really comprehensive and well thought through.
---
Whenever i find low level but quite good gear (esp. weapons) i'm searching the map for players in that level range and drop it in front of them. Always get a very positive response.
---
People get me. And the best part about it is that people get *me*, not some pandering facade that I put on to make people get me. Much easier on the brain than trying to pretend to please other people.
---
this!
---
Yeah, sure, give us less ways to play the game. Great idea.
---
It's 8AM here but I bet there's plenty of full servers rn. My gameplay experience would probably be chill. 
---
Overseas is probably the best place for the noobs. I should start doing that. 
---
I wish it was just the last update. But they sold us beta bugs, that's lame as shit. Then they took weeks to deal with obnoxious Bobby pins weight, fixed it, and rolled it back undoing God knows what else. That's sloppy work, I don't care how good PR is anymore. And I never used an OP weapon because I didn't cheat or find one in 90 levels of playing and grinding. The super weapon players who one shot destroy my power armor despite PvP safeguards, the countless leveled bases I wasn't even alerted to being attacked, the endless grind to fight a single boss that sucks so I can get RNG loot... Yuuuup, I'm outtie 5000
---
To be fair the objects in stores are a fine compromise.  You either grind rng or you spend caps.  Frankly, caps are easy to come by.
---
People complain about the short duration of the game.  Do they really want rngs to have given them everything attainable already?  
---
I wonder why people are willing to play all day in games like Destiny or the Division for incremental steps up in gear quality, but not here?  Different gamers?  Those guys don't Fallout?
---
Ultimate fallout 76 boss battle: servers
---
Damn, that's a lot of caps! I had no idea raiding was so lucrative. I'll leave that to the pros tho &amp; just log out. 
---
wow man, it's not even noon yet. calm down a lil bit theres a whole lot of day left....
---
If your referencing players killing eachother. I wasn't really taking that into account in the story, since the game kind of ignores it for the most part. Though, it wouldn't take long for people to kill eachother is food was rare.
---
If your referencing the story of west Virginia descending into chaos, I never had a complaint with it beyond being a bit sparce at times... not enough audio logs as it turns out, lol. Its entertaining pulpy writing. But I think your right, and the actual video game aspect needs work in terms of how the story is told. Since I think the writing works, but its kind of detached from the game itself since the story you uncover is all over. 
---
Theres a big difference from picking up an audio log off a dead body vs talking to a person who depends on you to complete the task. And I think that is the games biggest failing. They handicapped themselves. Like trying to do a play, except the actors lay on the floor while pre-recorded tapes of them doing the play go on in the background. 
---
You can follow the story, but it kind of goes against what humans find interesting. They maybe tried to take a queue from bioshock, and have the overseerer be this atlas person talking to you from an unknown place. But really, it just doesn't work since the overserer isn't talking to you in real time. Its all audio logs, so she might as well be dead. So I agree, they seem to have forgotten that the story has to actually be a part of the game. Instead of the story just being sat on top of the game.
---
I leave my camp open, it only has 3 walls so anyone could break in easily. 
---
By unique I mean that everything in a building could be useful loot. Searching an office could give you a wealth of supplies just as an enemy could, whereas most games that office is just for decoration and the only loot is from the boss you kill. 76 gives a lot more options and detail to what you can loot and utilize. No other game makes typewriters and desk fans a valuable resource
---
some thing is probably broken on you because i played for a hour last night and i went though 2 fusion cores with multiple fast travels. 
---
Well that's some solid info, thanks! 
---
Roasted 
---
Watoga and Whitspring Stations are my regular drop points. And occasionally the freezer next to the golf club entrance.
---
Yeah, I use a lot of AP regen stuff and if you do it right you rarely die with Dodgey and Fireproof/Dense. 1v1 is optimal but more than that you won't be able to attack and regen yourself since you can't eat food and attack at the same time. 
---
I've tried various methods with ranged and unless it's 5+guys all with fully perked automatic weapons I can survive until I run out of AP regen items. I plan on using it 1v1 mostly since it's pointless to waste items that regen AP.
---
They nerfed the overworld spawns in patch 4 I believe. It is in the patch notes.
---
You sure it was a different server?  Relogging has been dumping me back on the same server sometimes since last patch.
---
I got *super* bored the other day and read the entire timeline on the fallout wiki - apparently most of the small-scale nuclear stuff (cars, buses, trucks, etc.) didn't come about until maybe 25 years before the war, when the world was already running out of oil; and what did exist was insanely expensive (thousands of dollars for a gallon of coolant; likely at least a million for a nuclear car). Additionally, the US controlled the last remaining oil field (in Alaska, hence the Alaskan Front Line and Operation Anchorage), and refused to export any to other countries, essentially cutting them off from petroleum products overnight as the other fields ran dry.
---
As a side note, knowing that makes the Liberator drones make a lot more sense. A lot of the in-game propaganda from 3 &amp; 4 (especially the propaganda-film-turned-training-exercise that is the Operation Anchorage DLC) make it seem like the Great War's causes were mainly ideological, like an overblown Cold War where the capitalists and commies finally came to blows, but it wasn't: China was planning to invade the US to gain control of strategic resources, not simply to stamp out an ideology that they found antithetical to their own, and the drones would have served to support their actual troops in taking and holding areas during a ground war.
---
Wow they're really on top of things here!!! Congrats!
---
Maybe because they have raids, pvp battles well implemented.  dungeons etc   \* destiny  \* division i have no idea 
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with the story, but it doesn‚Äôt convince me that within a 2 mile walk of leaving the vault(and reaching level 5) we, the community of best and brightest, decide it is impossible to work together and start murdering each other.
---
And when they do drop something the body disappears and never comes back. 
---
It doesn't happen all the time, maybe every 4-5 logins. There has to be something that triggers it, because there have been a few threads since the last patch about the drain issue. I thought rad worms was screwing it up but that doesn't seem to be the case.
---
Going from the tennis courts to whitesprings i crash on my xbox one s but not my xbox one X.  no clue what it is but i can fast travel between the locations to get around it or just play on my one x and not the s
---
Right. Seems the news wire came in the early afternoon. 
---
This sort of thing happens a lot to me on PS4, routinely server dumping me out of nuke zones and interesting random encounters I will never see again.  It's like there's a hidden fun meter in the game and if yours gets too high it kicks you out.
---
I've uninstalled it now and waiting for improved performance and bug fixes.  I had a lot to do and made my own end game.  Mainly in the form of collecting plans and recipies, base building.  Setting up a shop to trade with other players.  Also did things like event grind with a team and also grind the scorchbeast queen.
---
In the end the bugs got to me and also Bethesda increased the grind to a point where it wasn't fun or rewarding to play.  I got a lot of time and enjoyed myself at times.  It has so much potential but I don't have any faith in Bethesda to turn this around.  But I must have some as I lurk this sub in hopes of better communication and new updates.  
---
The CMs are nice here but they don't have any authority and the devs do not seem to listen or know how the game works.  For example patch 5 pushed the wrong branch and gave us old bugs back into the game.  In the patch they also nerfed weapons too hard and nerfed something that didn't need nerfing.  I would honestly wait a few months or wait until they release a decent patch.  Which might be months away at this point.
---
3 melee, 2.5 ballistic
---
Yes you‚Äôre right. But that ain‚Äôt happening 
---
Of course I know about it, it's all that was on games media for like two months. 
---
Nerfing perks is a subjective thing as to how it impacts  your fun. The reality is that many of the disconnects and stability issues I saw from launch are things I haven't experienced because they have worked hard to patch the game. 
---
Calling me out for my intelligence just shows how weak you are. Do you know what a fallacy is?
---
I, and my entire friend group want PVP servers.
---
 I don't see what you're aiming to accomplish since this quaint little sub is not a majority opinion base on this game. 
---
Just let the pvp lovers have theirs, you'll get yours.
---
I think Vendors only sell legendaries that someone else has sold to them?
---
Would like confirmation on the above please?
---
If that works it‚Äôs brilliant idea. 
---
They‚Äôre clearly taking a low effort approach but boycotting generally doesn‚Äôt work with games and their developers, because it tends to make them think they failed and they quit developing their game and put resources on different projects. If they have a strong relationship with the gaming community maybe *maybe* they‚Äôll realize how they screwed up, but Bethesda is very tone deaf and I get the impression they don‚Äôt really listen to their community managers.
---
So, no don‚Äôt. That‚Äôll just make Bethesda give up faster. 
---
At a reasonable level (above 50) soloing a nuke launch isn‚Äôt terribly hard, even without OP weapons. I recommend nuking Whitespring, because at least you get something out of it. It‚Äôs disheartening to fire your first nuke and then find yourself trying to solo the SBQ. :)
---
Fallout 4 would have been perfect for that, as you could start as couple and find your son. If you start solo, one gets shot. If you start co-op one, who carries the baby gets knocked out and re-frozen.
---
This would have been great and really fit the story. 
---
&gt;I saw from launch
---
Ah so now you're lying. According to you you didn't play at launch and only payed 30 bucks for the game.
---
It's actually harder than that...  getting a player to return is a net neutral or even a slight negative for a live service game as that player is using resources but not contributing to future development. 
---
What Bethesda will need are players to return and then spend money in the store or on expansions to fund future development.  This is much harder than getting someone to pop back and see the new state of the game. They'll need to do something exceptional to convert a large enough number of players to this camp.
---
broken record much?  
---
and splitting servers into PvP and Pve would eliminate the need for stupid conversations like this one
---
then you can pVp all you want! problem solved!
---
I crashed in the last nuke zone I entered too! At least I got a sweet piece of two-star armor before it happened, but you're right: it kills the fun
---
Luckily that's only happened to me like once
---
Possibly, I feel like having the whole camp or none of the camp is probably more realistic to achieve. However, to make any of this possible you would have to find a way to make "guilds" or dedicated teams that way people aren't just adding random people for a budget increase. Maybe make a majority rules on camp placement so most everyone has to agree on placement. Though asking for this right now seems kind of fruitless as I'm sure it's slated for a future release *wink-wink nudge-nudge* Bethesda 
---
So get a middle man. A buddy that will transfer for you
---
Wha?
---
I'm level 64, and still only have crafted weapons. I don't farm legendaries, and have only found leg pipe guns and pole hooks. I soloed 3 scorchbeasts (2 lvl 50, 1 lvl 40, and adds) last night with a crafted stinging handmade, and a crafted precise .50 hunting rifle. Hated wasting the time and ammo, but they followed me across the entire cranberry bog, and started pissing me off with the infinite sonic attacks and fart bombs.
---
I'll use legendary weapons when I finally find one, but I think crafted are fine.
---
/yeah, yeah, CSB...
---
You appear to be the last person to know about this
---
They should save any workshops you own just like your Camp. If you log into a server and the workshop is vacant, place it back. If there‚Äôs someone there, give you temp blueprints and make the first workshop takeover attempt free.
---
Boom, they become fun and you can actually rebuild without persistent servers
---
No, it's a randomized assortment. My teammate and I see totally different inventories at the same vendors at the same time.
---
Thanks for confirming 
---
76 is my favorite Fallout despite the bugs because I enjoy making lots of different builds.
---
In every other Bethesda game, starting over with a different build locks you in to the same dialogue/cutscenes/locations/NPCs for hours.
---
This isn't an issue in 76, so I  can play the way I want without getting "burnt out" on the first 10 hours of the game.
---
Still waiting on character slots... about to buy another copy of the game.
---
I tried. I think I noped out after an hour of FO1. Turn-based just isn‚Äôt for me. 
---
Thinking about another Bethesda property, anyone know how PVP is in ESO? From what I was reading that is restricted to certain areas of the map. Folks seem reasonably happy with the game overall. could they loan out some folks from those teams to FO76? I know, different studios, etc.. but maybe get some staff with decent experience to consult at least...
---
I‚Äôm behind the pro shop right beside the two skeletons in the overturned canoe. I‚Äôve reached my capacity with 2 story workshop with 2 beds. No food but as of last night it‚Äôs all brick and wood flooring. 
---
But individuals don‚Äôt wage war. Societies do. This plays perfectly into the notion of the Vault Dwellers vs. Scorched Plague. That‚Äôs a war. 
---
Jimmy deciding he didn‚Äôt like that he didn‚Äôt like me and nursing that grudge for 20 years only to break into a murderous rage after leaving the vault. That‚Äôs no war. That‚Äôs Jimmy having an anger problem.
---
what I think would be cool for that fight specifically is, if the game was co-op, when you launch a nuke on that site you would get loaded into a queue of people waiting to join and fight the queen
---
Yeah everyone knows about this.  Also you can jump through some windows.
---
thats what I mean by I dont consider that to be a part of the actual story. The game for the most part ignore it. That part is not good design, i'll agree and probably fits more into, the story of the game feels like its seperate entity from the gameplay itself. But that again goes back to, the story and the mechanics needed to line up better. 
---
Thanks for the detailed reply, I appreciate your time there.
---
I'll probably hold off for a bit like you suggest then. Such a shame. I've got over 800hrs in FO4 and close to that in FO3. I know those are completely different games and I should bare that in mind, and I do, but man it's really hard to like this game in it's current state.
---
Thanks again, I'll hold off for a bit more.
---
So the 2 builds I'm considering are basically sneak attack manual sniping great for outside from a distance, which if you are far enough away from mobs, all your shots end up being sneak attacks so 2.5x crit with the perk on every shot, or a closer range vats sniper. The problem I find with VATS is that it seems to be very inaccurate when at max distance with the sniper(50%-), so you have to be much closer so you lose sneak after the first few shots. I'm also only level 30, so maybe sneak is significantly better in later levels with a few more perks and points in SPECIAL.  
---
For mid range, I would probably roll a normal rifle with gung fu/adrenaline, and melee for short.
---
Why should the game fragment its playerbase (and therefore cripple the Atom Shop whale market) in response to uninformed consumers complaining?
---
honestly, i see no reason why I would want to launch a nuke.
---
That's not my way of playing fallout.
---
That garbage of a terminal is junk. I hate the screen on it and the typewriter keys sticking out.  
---
We need the normal table/desk terminal and wall terminal  
---
I still rock a lvl 35 explosive lever gun. I've definitely seen worse
---
I do the same, they all get dropped there normally once every few days :)
---
well i only started playing about 6 days ago
---
Speaking from experience, not everyone has that buddy. 
---
I want to say I have got one from doing the treasure maps.  A silenced lever action 45. 
---
Yah I have said that since the beginning. It should have been a dropin dropout co-op game, max 2-4 players only sandbox, with some sort of public social hub instance we can head into to socialize and sell and share items. It'd make more sense from the pov of the game's intro and set up too. We're all from the same vault and should be working together to reclaim and rebuild Appalachia. Not shoot each other in the face and suddenly become raiders for shits and giggles and imaginary resource scarcity. 
---
Ya, as an explosive build with Fireprood and a Dense mod, I just stand there as he screams like, "k."
---
After he lands I bust out the Fatman.
---
Still trying to find a targeting computer for my legendary missile launcher so I can actually hit them while they are flying.
---
Forums are down that's probably why :)
---
Many of the creatures in fallout had cancer that the rads did not cure some of them are now passing away from this unfortunate circumstance its just bad timing that you have to witness this phenomenon over and over..........the cycle of life?
---
OMG you just made my day by defending yourself ROLMFAO holy shit I pegged you for exactly who you are "people get me" lol you even used the word facade it's like you took your entire personality from "the breakfast club"
---
Oh my god seriously I can't breathe I'm laughing too hard
---
You know what "you do you" your great seriously don't ever change thank you sir I needed a laugh 
---
At no point did I ever say I started at launch. In fact I've openly stated I started in January. That said, I knew about all the bugs at launch which is why I didn't play until then? Are you saying that my opinion isn't valid because I didn't play even though I could just watch a stream, video, or read an article? 
---
Even so it's annoying to pass items one by one.  Plus multiple  loading screens.  Also the fact your buddy may already have lots of items and it gets confusing remembering quantities and what was given.
---
Abeline Kid BB Gun Sneak Crit build.
---
If your items are destroyed dont you get a notification as well specifically saying "camp/workshop under attack"
---
Yes it was a different server. The first server I was on I did the event ‚ÄúPowering Up Poseidon‚Äù to get that free 500 energy for my workshop (and I restored it to full power because I used the box to start up the food packager) So this new server I get into, I checked the energy box and it said ‚Äúrestore Poseidon to full power‚Äù. So that‚Äôs how I definitely knew 
---
  When things are universally hated (FO76, Batman v Superman, Ted Bundy, ) the most obvious reason is usually the correct reason. There isn't a conspiracy going on.
---
Are people running into PVP griefers *that* often? I'm actually curious.
---
I'm on PC and have only run into people who wanted to PVP a handful of times and a few of those were for a bounty.
---
99% of the time I run into another player we just give a friendly wave (or sometimes even use voice) and go about our business. Sometimes there's even a drop of items for the other person to use.
---
At this point, I'm not sure they *have* time to improve things to the point where they get better. Right now they've failed to deliver the basic premise of the game - that we'd be rebuild the wasteland. That's not even remotely possible without persistence. I agree having your base destroyed by other factions sucks, but so does having your base pop out of existence for your teammates because you got randomly disconnected. 
---
Welcome to the game! There are a little of little 'glitches' like this I am sure you will soon discover. 
---
the community
---
Or not. 
---
I also "fixed" the game by not grabbing everything that is the nailed down lol w no PA I have almost 80lbs free and almost 60 in my stash, the game isn't broken you just got too much stuff
---
Same thing happened to me last night. Dropped a lot of junk and somehow my equipped outfit was in the bag. Didn't even touch the Apparel tab. Same outfit vanished once before (logged in and it was gone). Replacing it took several days due to RNG.
---
Thought my strategy of not dropping junk, vendoring when its laggy, going slow when scrapping and keeping several outfits sandwiched between what I'm wearing (to intercept miskeys or lag) was the solution. Nope, none of that prevented the issue yesterday.
---
I hope BGS lets us toggle items with do not Scrap, Trade, Drop or Sell some day. Suspect nothing will be done til a dev experiences it, and then the light bulb will go off.
---
It would be good if pacifist mode would also prevent you from doing damage to someone else's camp/workshop. 
---
The fish eye view is so stupid.  I feel for those with poor eyesight or have disabilities.  It's hard enough to read with 20/20 vision.
---
Yao Guai attack speed is insane as well.
---
I like to farm the two static spawn by Mountainside for springs and acid, but two of them at once stagger locks the fuck out of me. Lucky to get in one swing every 10 seconds.
---
That's usually annoying and considering the state of the game finding a trusted buddy to be online is kinda rough.
---
Agree. I was wondering about this Thank you.
---
Thing is, someone helped me today with this same crap because I didn‚Äôt understand how this guy and his friends got back into my server or maybe I was in the same server (which I wasn‚Äôt) and the person that helped me today said if I didn‚Äôt block them from my session before going into a new world, they could join my game by the recent players list. So it‚Äôs very unfair if you don‚Äôt know about that kind of stuff 
---
I thought about having city spaces. Maybe a grid of 6 camps that the squares were all exactly the same size. Then when someone logs in, they take an open square. Not as fun as owning real estate but might make it easier for the server hopping design to deal with. 
---
I'm looking into this further and gathering information to send to the Dev's on this. Thank you both for sharing information on this for us! 
---
I agree BTW.  Level 110ish and early (before 20) spec'd into Pack Rat and Thru Hiker.  I recently moved some attributes around and picked up Strong back and traveling pharmacy.  Combining this with the mod that allows quick changes between perk cards has completely changed my gameplay.  So much better and easier.
---
The game should join 2019 (or well 2001) and add a shared stash.
---
thank you for the welcome! we are both really enjoying the game so far :)

It's 8 player servers, they just started the closed Beta (you can get in on that now, but the servers are only located in EU at the moment, and if you're looking for a bugless experience, I'd wait and just keep an eye on the project)
---
I don't actually. I've been checking my ailments every time I see my carry weight glitch.
---
No, he‚Äôs right.  The last major update completely changed the emotional tone and activity level kn this subreddit, and is likely a proxy for what is happening across the game overall.    They made a mistake ‚Äúnerfing‚Äù fun things which distracted from an error-prone platform.   They need new content to bring folks back before the momentum dies. 
---
You can dtill drop PA through windows as well.
---
Yes, it should be more like Borderlands and Diablo. I don't care for PVP or playing with random people online
---
I personally never put them in cash registers. I stopped checking registers early in the game because all they ever gave was useless old world money. If I stopped checking early on, I figure other players might also so I drop stuff off in blue suitcases instead.
---
Honestly, I couldn't care less about the asset recycling if the game worked as promised. Asset recycling makes complete sense from a business perspective. If you can reuse it, why waste money and resources making the same thing over from scratch?
---
But the game *doesn't* work as promised. We were promised that we'd rebuild. That we'd work together. And that's not possible with the tools we've been provided.
---
When the final bastion of FO76, the only place on the net that didn't bash it, turns on it - you know something is wrong.
---
The AoE damage is still decent. You don‚Äôt have to be very accurate. 
---
Like others have said, would be good for an alt character as they level. 
---
Exactly, on every other mmo I‚Äôve played that‚Äôs exactly the case.
---
Then u have one character who is the mad crafter who makes gear for all ur other characters.
---
Yep seems they are redirecting forum stuff to the homepage.
---
Not working for me either 
---
I'm sure they just haven't been added to the atom store yet :P
---
You mean the "face"? https://i.imgur.com/F57uyXb.png The model is called "metro man" in the game files? That's very interesting! The art style does resemble the Metropolis... which in itself had a lot of occult symbolism. Good catch!
---
:) poor Bethesda, I do feel sorry for all the people who work for BGS and have to deal with all the hate, they love the game but the business side is not in their hands though.
---
yes :)

1 vote here. With Co-Op
---
Kinda like how they did in FO4. that perk system was rad.
---
There's plenty of people in game that still like it.
---
Yeah, because every single player has every single problem, instead of accepting that this huge variety of problems is widespread. 
---
Downvoting the hyperbole.
---
You could have fast traveled  out of their camp. If there was no way out.
---
You are entitled to think F76 is good but in no way are you entitled to tell other people what they should think about this steaming pile of crap Bethesda produced.
---
I work in software for the past 15 years and I can promise you nothing good will come out of the team that is in charge of F76. They crapped all other their customers and deserve a proper serving of salt and hate.
---
There's a video on youtube of someone killing her solo with a non-legendary combat rifle.
---
I used to think that the bounty number was their level
---
I got a good chuckle from you unironically applying stereotypes and then talking about The Breakfast Club.
---
It‚Äôs almost like people have some of these problems and not others. 
---
Ghost Recon Wildlands did a good job with co-op, finished that game and aside from a few gameplay/QOL nitpicks and a couple unreasonable missions it was a blast.
---
Yeah that whole interaction has a ‚Äúdid it to yourself‚Äù feel to it but maybe that‚Äôs just me
---
I mean half the weapons are still unusuable but they've been saying they "hear me".
---
A short range explosive shotgun seems like it would be dangerous to use. 
---
It's super easy honestly. Anytime you see the quest start just look at your map. If there's a few a group down there at the beginning chances are more will show up. As long as you show up and tack on some damage you'll get the rewards, you dont gave to be grouped or anything.
---
That sounds fire bro I definitely gotta try that, nice set up! 
---
Np.
---
I really don't like pvp at all. I don't have the urge to compare my digital d*** with other people. I like to collect, improve and beat content instead of doing the same thing over and over again.
---
Uh huh.
---
Sounds like something I‚Äôd do, along with open/close all the shutters when I see them
---
Ya need one? I don't mind helping out some. I've done it for others. They help me out from time to time, I help them out. I don't mind trading things I don't use, like certain types of ammo, or maybe I have a plan you dont. Goes both ways.
---
100% fair game.
---
It's like, some people have ALL these problems. 
---
But when anyone says they experience bugs and glitches, but never to the level others claim, clearly they are the ones lying. 
---
To clarify, the player had already unlocked my two resource extractors and my cabin door and was hitting the purifier last. Maybe the player didn't realize they would be a sitting duck once tagged as Wanted.
---
A lot of us have already started our builds and new characters in anticipation for March. Spoiler: Melee is currently OP. 
---
Exactly

It would be more fun if I could fill it with all the waste acid I've got sitting around

Sure, I'll host a server. Trust me, all these items are legitimate.
---
Hi, I'm glad to see this is your first day playing Fallout 76! I hope you enjoy your time in game, and that you feel you've gotten your money's worth! 
---
Ya, it has been exceptionally quiet from them this week. Dying to know when the next patch will drop because since the hotfix, this has been the roughest play period since launch (having to try 3+ times to log in without crashing, randomly disappearing corpses, randomly regenerating/taking no damage enemies, the list goes on).
---
Though with how toxic this subreddit has become (probably justified at this point) I can't really blame them for relegating their comments to fluff/community posts.
---
Minor inconvenience vs other issues in game. 
---
I‚Äôm from the era where the game you open is the game you bought.  You make do with what you got.  It seems everyone wants everything fixed, everything changed, and wants and expects  additional contact to make the game into their ideal game.  Boy I‚Äôd hate to be a game developer nowadays.  
---
That is very ‚Äúblack and white of you‚Äù.  I can be subscribed to a subreddit for the game and still not expect big game changing patches.     
---
‚ÄúExpect‚Äù being the key word here..   My expectations died several patches back but I remain curious.
---
Fair enough, if you just don‚Äôt *want* to launch a nuke, rather than feel it would be hard or tedious. I was just clarifying the latter. 
---
No, no one has ALL these problems lol. You know there‚Äôs more than one person on this subreddit. It‚Äôs totally normal to have some of these problems but of course if you make it out to seem like we have ALL of these problems at once it seems ridiculous. No wonder
---
Start your PVP characters now. A lot of you are already behind the power curve. Leader-boards will hopefully give us something new to go for.
---
ah! good call! thanks for the tip! 
---

I would like a mail box out side v76 for donations for new toons and a plus minus 5 cap on equipment is a good idea.
---
Just leave it all unlocked. It's not like you are going to be missing out on a whole lot. 
---
Well, I guess my question should be "where do you get more chances at Hunting rifle drops in general?"  I can't remember the last hunting rifle I've even seen as a drop - legendary or otherwise...
---
The lore behind it should be a railroad trolley, not an actual train.
---
Lore for clearing the tracks would be a bunch of people in power armor pushed stuff to the side.
---
ItIsKnown.jpg
---
wait, i got downvoted for starting to play this game? people would rather the game have no new players ?
---
wtf?
---
Eh. Workshops aren't fun for me for any reason because I really dislike PVP and don't want to be forced into an auto-PVP situation. So I don't touch the damn things. The aggravation is not worth it for me.
---
Least they could do is redirect us to here, haha.
---
How is that possible? I've avoided every trade request for reasons like this. There's no in-game tutorial on interactions like this, so how are we supposed to know how the mechanics work, or can be exploited?
---
This is exactly what PvP should be. 
---
Side note, can you get the explosive affix on explosive weapons like AGL and broadsider?
---
I'll enjoy 76 in 7.6 years when the servers are empty and the DLC is all out.
---
"Because screw Tesla and his AC, Elephant murdering, wireless free power loving self"  - Thomas Edison probably
---
I‚Äôd just wanna use these to watch players pick up the individual caps like candy out of a pi√±ata!
---
No problem. 
---
Question: What would it take to convince you that there are prominent, widespread issues with Fallout 76? 
---
Yes, the style was everywhere in the classic games and F3. But I find interesting that the face buried in Dunwich Borers (where an 'entity" was supposed to be) also appears in the Lucky Mine cave (where there's actually an "entity"). And the same face appears as an ornament inside the RobCo building in F76 and facing the Mass Fusion building on F4. Could it be only asset recycling? I guess it could, but I'm doubt it... 
---
I think pve servers and pvp would be fine, but increase the amount of people per server. Appalachia feels so dead with 24 people...
---
YES
---
Of course they have time to make the game better. Random disconnects don't warrant an entire change in game design, those issues need to be fixed. They can use there current systems to do more in the future with rebuilding the wasteland. You have no idea what they have planned and you also act like you know the only solution, you don't. They haven't failed in my opinion. 
---
I think anything Bethesda could have done to have a more focused game would have been better. Anything better that the unfocused, hodgepodge of half cooked ideas would be better.
---
Haha yeah. I kept playing for quite awhile.
---
Even made an alt to play through the game again but once i got to sqb farming land i shelved the game.
---
Now I'm eyeballing anthem and sekiro, will intermittently check on the status of this game
---
It feels like a 25% chance with me personally. 
---
Yes... They started sharing credit card data accidentally and had to bring down the forum while they fixed it
---
The worst thing is the community bitching and moaning, causing my game to change every time I log in.  I didn‚Äôt buy a house from Bethesda.  I paid $60 for a game that I‚Äôll play for a week, a month, or maybe a little longer.  I‚Äôll get out of it what I can and then move on.  See, now you got me bitching too.
---
It does resemble! =]]
---
If you lock things on your camp then fair game I say. Locking them means you don't want anyone to take them. 
---
However I leave mine unlocked. Passing players are welcome to help themselves should they require food/water/resources if I'm at a node. 
---
That's my take on it. 
---
I'm telling people that Bethesda messed up but the game is objectively in a better state as far as stability goes. Yea, People need to knocked down a couple pegs career wise. But other have been working hard to clean up someone's else's mess and it's showing. 
---
I didn't play at launch, but today I don't DC and I don't see the poses. A lot of the highly publicised complaints don't exist today. 
---
on the opposite side of things, i just started playing, and was downvoted for saying so in another post i made.
---
what a great way to welcome a new player into the community!
---
too bad, most other game reddit subs encourage new players... maybe this sub isnt the best place to visit...
---
This
---
Not new. You can glitch the map using same technique.
---
I do have a fancy base and I love seeing that it‚Äôs been appreciated, but every light?
---
I'm still early game so it's all valuable to me right now. I can already see that fairly soon low level junk and water won't matter much.
---
Also related. If you are on a forced pvp team due to the notes steps in this post. If you do not respawn right away, your fighting &amp; respawning teammates deaths remove your own caps for each of their deaths, until you respawn.
---
This game is almost unplayable. Having said that, even if it was a good game the community whines sooo much.
---
For me its usually just 5 min of spinning arrows 
---
I generally keep useful items I don't use for my build to give. I have a friend I give all my plasma ammo to because I don't use plasma. Why fuck over someone your helping when they help you often. Or just pay them for their time. Everyone needs caps. I don't want your stuff, I got my own good stuff. Shit, an IOU in the wasteland can be very valuable. 
---
A lot of game companies were on the downward slide last quarter and a lot of them mention FortNite as a contributing factor.  This explains Bethesda's bone-headed attempt at crow-bar'ing PvP in an otherwise solo-coop fallout title.
---
sorry, so this is a bad thing? im new to the game so not sure why people are implying it was a bad drop?  it sounds pretty cool to me
---
This is why they should have done private servers with options to rebuild. Rebuild houses, stores, the railroad. Would have been awesome.
---
Yes, because we wouldn't have had all the restrictions from online mode (CAMP, building, items, stash, gun balance, etc.) and mods.
---
Yes. I recently got my third one. Have also brought one from vendor, lol a shotgun even.
---
First one was instigating western revolver quite some time ago, still my best, second weighless&amp;something ultracite laser pistol just before latest patch, third one was two or three star 10mm sub. Only the laser pistol wasnt max level.
---
Funny, prior I've received a nice amount of TS, not none not more for a while.
---
In loading screens a question is asked "Do you like *some feature*" one press confirm for yes cancel for no. Get the opinion of the entire community on these questions ü§∑
---
Dude I know there are. All I'm saying is that it's not as bad at launch and I have a problem with people saying it's still in an unplayable state. The reality is that it doesn't crash as much as before and feral ghouls aren't rushing me in The pose. 
---
Yea there's a lot of problems that I see, but that doesn't mean I'm blind to what's improved. Tell me some of your big issues and we can talk about them. Open my eyes. 
---
Upvote for sharing your story, although you got burned it was an entertaining read. Sorry about your missing rifle.
---
You could make a dartboard filled with mediocre ideas, throw a dart and implement said idea to make FO76 halfway decent. I‚Äôd still not buy it though, sad world.
---
I‚Äôm on console. Everything was fine at first and got subsequently worse every patch until my game stopped worked altogether. Haven‚Äôt tried logging in for a few weeks at this point. 
---
Don't worry your never going to face her alone. I've been trying to kill her off hours but still somehow 10 level 150+ players show up and ruin my fun.
---
But but reddit knows everything and how to fix every issue with no logistical problems at all??
---
Did you get your caps?
---
I completely stopped using the pack rat perk and it hasn‚Äôt affected me at all. First you need to have a goal when you loot junk, not just pick up everything in sight. For example you might have everything to repair your power armor except springs and screws so you mark springs and screws in your search list and only pick up items that contain them. If you combine that with constantly scrapping junk at the workshops located in the area that you‚Äôre scrounging at, you should have no problems. Just make sure you scrap junk every time you pass a workshop and there‚Äôs tons of them everywhere. With no focus I agree that it‚Äôs unmanageable but then so is everything in this game
---
Look there's clearly people who are exaggerating or flat out lying about things.
---
One guy claimed he had 43 disconnects in one gaming session. But refused to say how long that session was. How long would you spend trying to play a game that kept disconnecting you? Would you literally spend 3 hours trying to log into a game that would disconnect you every 4 minutes? That's what it would average out to. 
---
I doubt it. Even if you upped it to 8 hour session, that's still a disconnect every 11 minutes. I can't take that kind of claim seriously. No one really would.
---
Another person claimed they went on and tested getting disconnected after taking a workshop. He couldn't provide any numbers about how many workshops. Other than his claim he always gets disconnected right after, or 5-10 minutes.
---
And he specifically did this to test it, so as to make  point. But he never showed any proof. No videos or anything. Which he could have easily done. Nope, he just got rude and insulting if anyone dare to question him.
---
Honest people act differently when their facts are questioned. 
---
The tone of your story matches your raider flair. There are some nice stories here.
---
I don't think so. But you will get logged if you idle or go afk too long.
---
Yesterday I was playing (I‚Äôm level 21) with a level 154 guy. We were shooting a bunch of ghouls and he walked in my line of fire so I shot him which triggered the option for PVP... he immediate shot and killed me and took my loot... not cool man. 
---
Based on my experience... After the TSE nerf, most of the non-peaceful types simply stopped.
---
In fact, on the PS4 it seems there are less wanted players roaming around too.
---
When the PVP servers actually arrive, won't we by default have PVE servers? 
---
maybe they're prepping for a spicey "inside the vault" and don't want to hear all the whining that always follows.
---
That's fucking brilliant
---
I walked away for a few months until Bethesda fixes more bugs and adds more content but still read here for updates.
---
I love the atmosphere, and I've ran across some great people, but doing the same relatively narrow choices of things over and over isn't enough keep me playing.
---
Sorry, I assumed you were higher level. I would lock my stuff too.
---
Think of that nice ban you'd get for crafting so much o quickly though...
---
No they don't say that. Only non-bullet weapons can't drop as explosive.
---
You can melee VATS through windows too. Also some windows will let you just walk right through.
---
The problem is, only 15 people play the game right now...
---
The connection issues have been pretty much fixed as far as i know, the only problem I'm having is the game will occasionally freeze when i enter/exit power armor
---
Yep. Borderland 2 was the most enjoyable co-op campaign I've ever done. 
---
I figured that much and thats definitely fair, 
---
I've never played a Fallout game for less than 50 hours.   .... .... .... Until now. 
---
ah, this is good to know as well, thank you
---
Yes this is it
---
They need to redirect more than just the forum.  They need to do a wholesale redirection as to what direction the game needs to go and the company needs to go.
---
You mean these? https://i.imgur.com/htNHvXR.png They're nests? Is there a terminal saying that?
---
I was wondering what those "metal scrapings" were. They seem pretty big and hard to move. It reminds me of the Akira manga aesthetics after Neo Tokyo was destroyed. https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e5/74/0f/e5740f19348985ecd72690ae102b29d2.gif

&gt; solo
---
How? Every time I've ever fought the SBQ, every level 20 player in the lobby comes swarming like flies only to hide in the shack and screw over everyone else.
---
thanks, i'll have to try that tonight
---
Hope you get the attention you are craving from this post! 
---
I noticed this last night. I had several beer bottles and a couple of other random pieces of junk that wouldn't scrap. Component view would show the 4B number (which I think is 2x the max integer value). Haven't logged on since, so I don't know if it will persist upon logging in again.
---
How many PVP games you actually play for PVP itself? Maybe Rust, DayZ and whole survival genre, but mostly you play PVP for somekind of rewards or progression- either to climb ladder or get gear. When Overwatch came out, it had no ranked games. I played it for day or two and that was it, because there was no meaning to play it and it became boring. When they introduced ranked games, I played almost a year, because there was point to play. Take a ESO, I do PVP there, because: First, I need the gear that battlegrounds drops, second I want those 3 PVP gear motifs, third I need to get better at it. Same is with WoW, I liked PVP until they decided to remove PVP gear, because after that I felt there was no progression in PVP. Take a Fortnite, its a f#cking garbage and meaningless to win there, because even if you come 1st there is no rewards. Once you get the pass, it becomes more meaningful to play it. If you look top games on Twitch that is purely focused on PVP, each of them has somekind of rewarding system or ladder to climb. Yea, in 90s it was OK to have PVP game without somekind of reward system, because DSL connection just became available and multiplayer  was rather new. Now, having a deathmatch game, just so that you could shoot each other is destined to die out.

Those are fictional shows and movies. Studies about what happens when disasters and strife are at their worst show that shit like that does not happen. Ppl will help one another and band together for community and protection and socializing.

I think this is sadly the damaging beliefs and mindsets this wave of grimdark nihilistic nonsense in our media is sensationalizing as what is human nature.

If they can get to it landfill has land stable enough to built foundation blocks around it making it impossible to claim. If u want extra build missile turrets all around it so if they happen to hit something not indestructible turrets relentlessly fire and they can't stop it unless they destroy everything. Watched it happen pretty neat...
---
as it stands we ALL have no option of PvP
---
I scrap them when I see they‚Äôve stopped rotating but more than half of the time they do nothing at all.  I have noticed that when even just one of them starts to fire the others chip in to assist.  It‚Äôs almost like they feel embarrassed at being lazy.  
---
Yeah but take into consideration that the thousands of people playing, it‚Äôs just a game to them. They don‚Äôt know you in real life so they‚Äôre just gonna want to fight, because what else is there to do?
---
All we need to do is get about 400 people to upvote it and then maybe it'll get sent to the team. Then 3 updates later they'll start to implement it. Then they'll undo half the work from the 3 updates. :)
---
You can't pvp until level 5. If you have an alt at 33 you should know this.
---
Thank you, and Thank you again for allowing me to get in a good laugh OMG seriously I was crying you rock!!!
---
I'll be checking out you other post later today I'm hoping for some more great brooding and social anarchism keep up the good work and please don't leave me disappointed. I'll be sure to upvote everything that makes me laugh!!!

I carry a gatling plasma, 50 cal, gatling laser, and gatling gun.
---
The gatling plasma is the most ammo efficient big gun by far, and melts SBs, but can't even make it through two cores before breaking with level 5 gunsmith and level 3 weapon artisan.
---
Thankfully the .50 cal is much better when it comes to durability,  so it's my second tier.
---
Typically I use the old school gatling for weak enemies, and the gatling laser is my emergency backup weapon.
---
But why are there 16 people on my server?
---
&gt; Or, if I find someone else's CAMP and they're home, I'll just drop it in front of it as a door prize
---
See, in real life, paper bags on doorsteps are things you *don't* want to see, but in the game...
---
Proof?
---
If I want a PvP heavy game, I‚Äôll go play a PvP heavy game. If I want a post apocalyptic wasteland that has both PvP and pve with base building virtually anywhere, I‚Äôll play 76.
---
No ones forcing anything on anybody here
---
I think that you're right and I think joining CAMPS should've been a feature.
---
I disagree. I think the other way around. 
---
Unrestricted PvP lobby‚Äôs where you play on a hardcore wasteland. If you die you lose your weapon or a piece of armor. Would be much more fun. There‚Äôs no risk or reward currently, and imagine actually fearing the wasteland 
---
Someone mentioned that in the comments! So far, I think no one knows what the "guiding stones" are.
---
What image are you referring to, with the speaker?? That's an interesting theory!
---
1. FT to the Watoga Train Station
---
1. Run out the front door diagonally with Watoga High on your RIGHT
---
1. Run between the buildings there after you've dropped off of the WTS parking lot.
---
1. Look for the Super Duper Mart (listen for the annoying PA voice over lady)
---
1. Find Brotherhood Vendor Bot Phoenix
---
Sometimes he's not inside as the Municipal bots like to pick on him, poor boy. Sometimes he also spawns in the wall, but mostly he'll be there behind the counter, subjecting you to the awful PA system.

I'm on Xbox. I would be happy to make you one tonight, when I get home. k9mpsgt

Lol , Burn!!!! I‚Äôm 49 and can‚Äôt agree with you more !!! So many asshats on here with all the armchair bravado they can muster -it‚Äôs like they just want to be snarky and a-holes to anyone with valid opinions . I just experienced the same thing you did just worse after fighting thru a horde  of mutants and ghouls expending all my ultracite ammo I finally downed it just for it to say it was owned and opening it will be considered stealing !!!!!would that of meant I became wanted for stealing it??? I was like WTF!!! But I i figured what the hell ive gone this far , so I open it just to find nothing.... N O T H I N G!!!!!! Not one goddam thing !!! No nuclear key card , nothing not even ammo!!!! And of course I became wanted !!!!!
---
Lately its been my torso &amp; left leg, they both have mods.. maybe that has something to do with it
---
I don‚Äôt disagree, but that is a complaint with a lack of game content. Doesn‚Äôt mean PVP fits with the story of the game.
---
Tesla rifles are indeed fun, though my experience with them has been a little different. The first one I ever found was a L40 legendary Furious Explosive Tesla Rifle. I've always run rifles, so I was excited by this find. The explosive mod basically turns it into a projectile weapon, though. It doesn't shoot arcs at all, so it doesn't jump between enemies which is unfortunate. It still did decent damage compared to the Handmade I'd been using for awhile, though the fire rate was lower so I didn't pull it out as often. Then I found the charging shotgun mod, which changed everything. Now I've got an explosive shotgun that benefits from rifle perks, and this was a huge upgrade in damage, even just firing without charging shots up. I've now upgraded to a L50 Quad Explosive Tesla Shotgun (53 ammo per reload!) and most enemies die in one shot, some two, and bigger enemies like deathclaws and mirelurk queens take 4-6. It's only effective against scorchbeasts on the ground though, so I have to rely on my handmade/cripple perk to get them to land first.
---
I have to admit part of my attachment to it is also just for aesthetic reasons. I like the look of it a lot more than most other weapons and it goes well with power armor. I also like the subtle blue glow it casts .
---
I'm disappointed that this particular variant can't drop any more now that explosive was removed from energy weapons loot tables, but it seems reasonable since explosive energy weapons don't make any sense.
---
Maybe he got up very early in the morning?

This situation is why I see a use for PvP in fallout, two players fighting over something valuable, but that something is also attainable through many other methods also.
---
When there‚Äôs something to be had or won besides bragging rights, it gets interesting :).
---
MMO's have way more then 10 people playing on a map at once.  This is not an MMO. 
---
I have experienced two instances where building a camp in a spot with a cap stash will make the stash disappear and never return. I've tried server hops, and check on every login to no luck.
---
The **idea** of separate servers like that sound appealing. But in practice what happens? You have large groups take over any and all PvP servers and the community gets split and shattered. Look at Ark. Look at Conan Exiles.

Essentially it is on console for me. Me and my friend never find other players and if they do they don‚Äôt talk nor trade. So Fo76 is basically fallout 4.5 co op imo.
---
Well, yes and no. You don't have to deal with a lot of these issues that endgame people face, so at that, you're enjoying it fresh and new. Which we can't get back. The game starts to break after level 50. Savor it.
---
I‚Äôm here for ya, if you‚Äôre on PS4 feel free to message me or ask any questions. If you need help in game let me know as well.
---
Fortnite and PUBG battle royale are tops on the chart though.  PvP rewards that involve grinding should be side-grades/other abilities and not outright better.  That's the problem with FO76 PvP and gear rewards.  I don't know much about WoW.  I have a lot of time in Planetside 2 and SWBF2 and both lead to unlocks that are far closer to sidegrades.
---
Subreddits by design cater to the most hardcore players or fandoms, casuals don't usually join. 
---
This subreddit has many more people actively commenting on how they're bored after over 100 hours of play vs noobs asking for help. 
---
Call it a hunch because I don't think I have the proof that you need. 
---
However, I think my is sound and if it isn't please let me know why. 
---
But I want pvp servers, is not like adding them affect you in any way if you don't plan to play on them in the first place...
---
Lol I‚Äôm on ps4 and I‚Äôve gotten threatened to let someone in my house or they would ‚Äúdestroy everything I own‚Äù 
---
They have this fantasy in their head where they go around stomping the noobs. But the reality is they will log in, and get stomped by a huge "clan" that basically owns the server. Then they'll cry about "how imbalanced PvP is" and next thing we know, PvP servers are dead.
---
I have to say, as someone who doesn‚Äôt have a two-shot or explosive anything, I was actually pretty happy to see the nerf.
---
Now, I do think they could have gone about it in a better way‚Äîor done it in conjunction with other changes (like making other builds viable), But fundamentally I was pretty okay with it. Of course, if they had nerfed one of the dozen perks or the ‚Äúinstigating‚Äù effect I need to have a semi-auto rifle build that isn‚Äôt complete wank, THAT would have been another story...
---
\&gt; I think we have disagreements about how big a role influencers play into sales. I believe the consumers have changed and rely much more than they did in the past, on information than band strength.
---
Yup, EA has been watching the success of Warframe for years.
---
Warframe is a hardcore game with numerous complex systems for crafting and modding weapons and frames (javelins in anthem)
---
EA decided if they could copy the gameplay exactly, and dumb down the complex systems to nothing so that your grandma could understand them, they could make bank.
---
EA loves to dumb down systems for the lowest common denominator. Look at Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2. Dragon Age and Dragon Age 2. They run on completely different systems because the originals were developed by an EA free Bioware.
---
You have a writing utensil, some paper? You have a phone or computer? Just make a list of everything you give your buddy and they can give it back. I usually let them keep 1/4 of all ammo, aid, and junk. It's like a commission for helping me out.
---
That‚Äôs puberty, we may have to get you new shoes as well. 
---
A very Fallout looking camp, I like your item placement, it's very natural and fitting. Good job fitting in the resource extractor and windmills so neatly as well.
---
Locking anything in your camp sends out a challenge to other players to unlock it and maybe just trash the rest of your camp while they're at it.
---
Rules of 'camping': Don't place your camp near populated areas and don't lock anything and no one will bother you or steal your stuff.
---
It‚Äôs honestly a poor design from the start. You make a game where the story is your players were together for 25 years. All the players who buy the game will only play by those rules if they‚Äôre hardcore fans of the game. But most people buying the game off the shelf hop into the game clueless and just think to shoot everything that moves.
---
I really believe Bethesda thought of this game in a matter of days to close the gap to their new titles 
---
You can buy the plan at Watoga BoS Phoenix vendor bot and probably Harpers Ferry.
---
90% of everyone feels this way, yes.
---
I lost my only three star drop because of a disconnect, I didn't even see what it was so oh well. But your idea is good because i couldv'e gotten my loot.
---
Sorry, this suggestion doesn't represent the community, just a small hardcore subset. There is no point in putting it into the game just for those people.
---
Don't @ me, I'm right.
---
If that‚Äôs true, nobody will buy any private servers. I‚Äôve never experienced unwanted PVP in game, Bethesda servers are still gonna be Bethesda servers and if I can‚Äôt mod the content either, there will be no point in it. 
---
Which is strange to think, because I‚Äôd be happy to plow dollars into a different coop fallout experience. 
---
Which sounds harder:  
---
1) Create a new worldspace that is occupied by various object and entities in a way that dosn't make them scatter thanks to an admittedly funky engine, complete with quests, mobs, some voice acting, new equipment, ect, ect...  
---
2) Create a few lines of code that say "If choose PVP, goto server type 1, PvPpokedamage=0, DropOnDeathChems=1"
---
It's a small quality of life effort that is relatively easy to implement so they can have SOME content, no matter how small, to go along with yet more bug fixes, and to give SOMETHING to one of the louder subsections of the audiance (or were you not here for the excessivly common "we want PvP" threads less than a month ago?) I personally have zero interest in PvP in this (or most) games, but Jesus, mate, it's not much of a resource drag away from pve content.
---
Now, if they suddenly announced a new PvP arena worldspace and PvP , it would be a lot more reasonable to be angry. But until they do, let's go ahead and set down the pitchfork, yeah?  
---
&gt; quaint little sub
---
Can't believe you're not being downvoted into oblivion for that ;)  Entirely accurate comment though.
---
There‚Äôs that new foundation stacking trick that has people building pyramids or Aztec style temples..
---
Why not toy around with that?
---
Me personally I make (made since it‚Äôs been patched) megabases. Bases grossly over budget but in a tasteful way (untasteful being stacking turrets on whitespring) I‚Äôve made 3 in total.
---
First ones a 9 storied Brahmin Slaughterhouse with an opera house on the 9th floor. the second one is a very large trading depot with a disco hall, six apartments, and a rooftop park. Lastly, I‚Äôve made a fighting pit with gambling, established rules, low level weapons for the duelists, etc.
---
Gotta make your own content sometimes bro.
---
Can you learn deep pocketed from scrapping?
---
The two times I've had a cargo bot "heal up" on me was because it turned out to be a different cargo bot.  It's pretty easy to lose your target when fast traveling, and it's not unusual to find them without their escort (because someone else also shot the vertibots and failed to shoot the cargobot)
---
If you need the keycard and can't down a cargobot in a few shots, go to the Enclave bunker and get the quest. Then you have a quest marker and won't lose it.
---
Post a video. Most of us are tired of hearing this "1 shot through slap damage" bullshit.
---
Mostly because it's bullshit.
---
Pretty accurate, actually.
---
Haven't seen it, but now I'm interested! =]
---
Here's a question for you. How long would you spend trying to log into a game that kept crashing about every 4-8 minutes?
---
DA2 is the biggest sin ever.  Didn't get that, and I totally passed on DAI when it came out too, I'll never forgive them for what they did to the DA franchise.
---
I meant the larger ones but that one is spot on, more so than the others upon a second look. I saw somewhere that FO3 had statues that were a direct copy of something from Metropolis although I'm not sure about exactly which statue that was referring to. Either way, art deco had a big influence on Metropolis which, in turn, had a big influnece on modern sci fi. No doubt it's an influence although a direct one may be a stretch. 
---
I'm glad to see these being discussed because the lore around the weird unexplained shit in these games intrigues me way more than actual BOS/Enclave/etc. storylines.
---
Official forum PVP has always been more entertaining than the actual game..
---
Just watch out though, I have a suspicion that some of the mods there are bias towards pro-fallout posters.
---
its not working it seems. judging by how ugly the dashboard is now its probably being updated
---
I like to think the munitions factory on that server remains abandoned to this day lol.
---
What's wrong with calling it quaint? 
---
Not just pve, I want to play solo with no other players in the world at all. The last time I played (before Christmas) I was about level 22 and had just spent an hour or so clearing out all the enemies in an area so I could loot and explore at my leisure. My armor was broken and I had almost no ammo left on me. I had worked my way to the lowest level of the building I was in and was about to leave when literally every enemy respawned at 60+ because another player entered. That is utter bullshit, unfun and unfair.
---
Is this discord for PC? 
---
I've only had the game a week or two but I'm level 26 already and I'm a fast learner. Plus I love playing in a team rather than alone :) 
---
Well fuck.
---
That is a lot to burn through, what PA are you using? I live exclusively in Excavator armor for the carry bonus and even with doing a bunch of stuff, I don't got through that many at all. Are you using the perk card for it? Mine is only at 2*, seems though that people that burn through them quickly have had 3* cards. I wonder if it is bugged like the *Luck of the Draw* one. 
---
Let's try this !?

 Anyone else on PC build around there? I'd like to see how close we are allowed to be. Would love to help new neighbors build shops and stores in that area. Have all the plans but metal picnic table. Have TONS of free time and materials. 
---
It could also be the server crashed out on him or something. 
---
Wow. You must be really lucky then. I‚Äôve been griefed a good handful of times. Maybe they can kinda tell I‚Äôm a girl and that‚Äôs it. Who knows. But one thing is sure I‚Äôm not exaggerating my stories. I have videos to prove it. 
---
The dumbing down of Mass Effect in the sequel was the exact moment Bioware became a trash studio.
---
Nah the servers are just unstable sometimes.
---
The other half are here to buy duped gear and share exploits that allow them to become good at PvP.
---
I would have been happy with a coop Fallout 4. I'd love to build a base with other players, and make the damn thing BIG.
---
 Because it would make sense, and we can‚Äôt have that. 
---
I'm hoping they have some way to measure many of these things without surveys and whatnot. For example, if 1% of players use laser rifles, for example, I'd hope they could measure that and determine why. Only 2% of *The Messenger* quests get completed before despawning? Figure it out!
---
Unfortunately no. I have 198 kg on me and 900 in the stash (the perk that lowers the weight of stims allowed me to put a lot in there. My stash is all aid junk and ammo but mostly stimpacks. i tried taking a few stims out (had 198 kg on me) nothing, tried taking junk out, nothing, tried ammo and i got ammo out of it.
---
No I mean like the kind that added supreme depth and story to the previous installments 
---
Indeed. problem is, it needs to have a good reward to effort ratio. Modern WoW is currently having that problem, just like 76, where most of the content has no purpose or reason to push onward. Unlike 76, however, WoW at least has a coherent growth system. I got the feeling they expected folks to do events, but didn't realize that rewarding stimpacks at level 50+ is pointless, and it's more effective to just run through whitesprings again.
---
Just rename the thread title to...
---
**Just curious Bethesda, why didnt you think?**
---
question answered, Fatality! ;)
---
They 100% have that data. Just wish they had the drive to do something with it. 
---
&gt; I don't think gaming outlets need the article dollars to succeed, but if you don't think they'll rewrite an article they released two months ago just to make $100 then you don't know how desperate these affiliate writers are.
---
That is not a description of any of the outlets you mentioned. Editors exist. Paid professional staffers do not get paid by the click. Garbage content mills exist and will always exist. They have even less impact on the success or failure of a game than professional outlets that, again, have very little impact on blockbuster sales. 
---
&gt; I think we have disagreements about how big a role influencers play into sales. I believe the consumers have changed and rely much more than they did in the past, on information than band strength.
---
With apologies to Jerry Maguire, show me the data. Is Madden, a lousy game, selling poorly these days? Are video game consumers somehow different than consumers of movies, where it's obvious and evident that professional critics have no real impact? 
---
The only group responsible for the success or failure of Fallout 76 is the developers. Bethesda can't control public opinion, they can't control online discussions. What they can control is the game, and they're doing a lousy job of it. I'm not sure why you want to blame the success or failure of a game on anyone other than the people who control every aspect of it.

The only legendaries the vendors sell are one that players sold to them.

Brace yourself!.. the disappointment comes in waves..

Right. No one would call CoD or Battlefield a MMO. Although, in Battlefield are often more people at a single Map than on a whole Fallout 76 server.

I have the T60 with normal mods attached (no jet pack).. I can't even sprint due to weight, so that can't be it. I'm literally walking everywhere lol . but maybe I'll try the 2\* perk card instead. 
---
You know what, I'm down with the lunchbox. That's where my stuff is going from here on out. 
---
That too - but DA hurt me more, was always a big fan of them prior...  loved Baldur's Gate and DA was meant to be the successor.  DA2 was so utterly dumbed down it was like a joke version of Diablo or something, they literally ripped the RPG elements out.
---
Vendors only sell legendaries that players have sold to them. It has been confirned many times.
---
Yes far cry style drop in/out co op would have been so much better 
---
Not necessarily. There are games out there i come back to every so often despite any new releases. The big ones being Warframe, GW2 and PoE. BUT for fo76 to become one of those there needs to be some effort on bethesdas side. And a substantial one at that. They could either focus on the strong side of the game (exploration imo) or overhaul the really weak points (in particular the combat system and UI) on top of the expansion content and  obviously fixing of server stability and general buggyness.  
---
So it really comes down what they bring to the table. I had much fun in the game, but now that all the novelties are explored there is just nothing right now. So many design decisions just don't match anything ive seen in live-service games. It is like they were thinking only half way, couldn't dedicate to one direction or decided very late in development that this will become more than coop. Just as one example as i don't want to build a wall of text: PvP.
---
Leaving aside the obvious balance problems that should never have passed any playtesting what-so-ever and the general animation locking, low ttk, low maneuverability, reload-to-shoot-ratio, etc that doesnt exactly qualify this as a good pvp environment. That still leaves us with little to no incentives to PvP (with workshops being the biggest ones, but then the respawning and server hop mechanics make little sense), a weired defender bonus that comes from the fact that many people of the target audience dont want to PvP, a massive map with not enough players to ever run into one, but you can see everyone on the map and fast travel to them. 
---
Preach brother!
---
Would love PVP servers. Actually, I wouldn't mind RP servers, but the lack of chat kinda kills that.

I get it, especially if you're high level, but like others have said if you're high level then junk and water is meaningless to you anyway so why bother somebody's camp?
---
Yes, my main camp and 3 of my Vendor Character Camps are all in the same area, mainly to have a good central location and be easily accessible for lower level players that I like to help out when I can.
---
My Vendor Shops all have Rad Showers that are free for people to use, and Fusion Generators to power them, so repairs are very expensive when people decide to be total dickheads.
---
What are the rest of your specs? Like ram amount and speed and hard drive 
---
I like how there are people here who say this game isn't buggy anymore 
---
PvE with some sort of opt-in PvP mode like maybe some form of holodisk or maybe a- ok hear me out- maybe a radio station. And it could be called something like "hunt the hunter" or along those lines 
---
Read what he said though.  He gave up the Piercing Mag.  Because the piercing mag is 10 rounds.  It has been 10 rounds.
---
My friend hated it cause he got that new magazine for his handmade with armor penetration and it reduced it to 10 rounds, then he didn't have enough materials to change back to his old magazine.

If the event isn't spawning it's because someone else triggered it, not an RNG failure.

---
Don't the donated items disappear when the container respawns its contents? Don't the "doggie bags" disappear when you log out?  
---
Don't get me wrong, I do this too and think it's admirable.   But I'm pretty sure we are fooling ourselves if we think other players regularly receive our donations.
---
I never have used this perk before , I‚Äôm constantly breaking down and selling before I‚Äôm able to even hit a weight problem ( I have 40% weapon weight reduction and keep it minimal )
---
They would not be able to Monetize the game. 
---
This entirely explains the one on top of the service entrance not having it when I warp in there to sell to the vendors. I just come in too close
---
Yeah, people don't hear about it much, because of how successful it became (and how the fanbase kept at it to make it successful), but it was not a very good game early on. But then, back then we had less expectations for the genre. 76 came out in a world filled with survival games, and simply does not measure up yet. If it was any other company, I'd assume it was already gonna die, but after how ESO was handled, I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt for now.
---
Giant Gnome + The recent pyramid build. 
---
Dude. I've talked to people in game on pc lots and lots. Most are on this sub.
---
This doesn't have a large casual player base anymore. It's more of a cult following. 
---
Yup, the systems in the original DA, the moment to moment pause/command combat, was straight up Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale, and they turned the sequel into a shitty action game with 2 tile sets copy pasted a thousand times.
---
Serious on the bunny hopping?
---
I would love for the PvP servers to come because as much as I love the PvE co op thing I really want to do PvP but in the games current state it's just so pointless
---
While we're at it, why don't we introduce peer to peer servers too. Make this game like GTA Online, surely nothing will go wrong.
---
Inventory management

Exactly what this guy said.

I actually believed the game would be mostly bug free by now because of the reddit.

The reddit also says most players in game are positive about the game, but that's not even almost true.

I usually use the cash register for the larger (unlimited?) storage space.  Seems to be fairly common on PC.
---
Is that still true after the last patch? That's when we noticed the change.
---
Is this game free-to-play yet?
---
(Vault-Boy gets a wart)
---
You may notice some... changes
---
(Vault-Boy looks inside his pants)
---
No, it's not puberty

Sorry pc D: Thank you for the offer though

Like if you move your camp, it never comes back? For you or everyone?
---
If the BOS had used pipe rifles instead of energy weapons they'd still be alive today...

I read one comment a while ago about how they should introduce factions. Like when you play you can decide to choose to be a raider, member of the Brotherhood of Steel, or any other faction that is out there. This would be fun because you would only be PVPing against people from another faction (According to the canon). So if you want a lot of PVP, you would choose to be a raider. Because they are basically enemies of everybody. Brotherhood of Steel would be friendly to some factions but in war with some others.
---
They could add an icon to the player name to tell you what faction they belong to.
---
Ok... here is the breakdown

LLV\_Vendor\_Recipes\_Mods\_Faction\_FreeStates \[LVLI:003D7F93\]  
---
From those LLV\_\* they feed to the respective Vendor leveled lists, then the Vendor Chests.  
---
So they should show up on all the vendors, but they are not.
---
Makes no difference.   I mostly play with others now. Last night my entire team was kicked off the server.  There's no going back.
---
Does this also allow you to shred the workshop owners CAMP without going wanted too?! I know you can shred wanted players camps to get to them, just wondering if this applies here as well. 
---
No more workshops for me for a while!
---
It makes Server Hopping less tedious if I name it something sweeter :)
---
I would say wait for private servers
---
But you have to understand. Since the beginning it's been players with low hours that have been whiteknighting the game. Ever since the first fuckin week. It's been so frustrating to explain things to them that they didn't understand. They'd just downvote and jack themselves off repeating that the game is fine.

Vangeox here, Thanks for the update!
---
There is a semi -organized effort among seemingly hardcore players on grieving in-game player with the intent on destroying F76. While I'm sure the % of players doing so is less than 5%. Five percent of a million players is a lot of players.
---
Or those who don't have the disposable income to jump ship when the next shiny new game comes out. Not everyone is so lucky ("Don't you guys have cellphones?")  
---
But not everyone sets a game aside and never plays it again, all the more so for Fallout and Bethesda fans. The real test will be what happens when they put out their first real content update. If it dosn't include some meaningful and rewarding activities, it probably will become abandoned in the manner you mentioned.
---
THATS WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS
---
You would probably have better luck at r/fo76bazaar
---
games, even ones you enjoy, do run their course. If you have done all you want and still want to keep playing there is always the option of just signing in to do "chores" like caps runs, junk gathering, ect the things you can drop in and out to do as you like until new content that captures your interest comes up, or just drop out and play something else until new content comes out. Its how most mmos work. people play, drop out, something new is released, and people jump back in on top of new players joining and doing the same.
---
It just doesn't make any sense. This is a small closed group of ppl that have known each other for 25 years or even longer if they knew each other before the bombs too.  The number of ppl is less than half the charter on a commercial airplane. Everyone has CAMPs, there is no shortage of technology or resources to even entertain the idea that ppl have to fight over to survive. We can produce everything ourselves with our camps and manufacturing capabilities easily, and appalachia is not Boston or California or DC. It's barely touched by ruin from the war. 
---
Vault door opens and you just randomly start wanting to kill Joe from Finance b/c he chews his food loudly or Jill from Hydroponics because she stole the affections of the boy you liked sixteen years ago instead of working together to rebuild, reclaim, and establish a permanent settlement together, pooling everyone's technical know how and extra labor distribution? Even if someone is purely looking at their own selfish survival needs and desires.... working with others to secure your own self preservation would bring about better results.  
---
I really can't even say much about 76 right now because I stopped playing 2 weeks after Beta. I assume I'll come back once they figure some things out, it just seemed so empty. That and it became clear pretty quickly the bulk of the game is grinding...and that's what got me to quit Rust.
---
the thing thats confusing me most is the absence of the search option often. i also have lvl 3 cap collector

We have overcome many hardships before.

It's less effort than taking a workshop, building up the workshop a little, holding the workshop, you don't have to lose a ton of time when crashing or disconnecting, and in my experience with the dozen or so locations that you can find them in the Ash Heap, you have an 80% chance of getting 3-5 in 10 minutes when you already know where the generators and stray fusion cores are. Seriously, try it. You're hardly getting fusion cores passively with the effort required with workshops. You're already spending a bit less than 10 minutes clearing the workshop, capturing it, building up (even if it's just a little), and then waiting another 30 minutes to get paid for your effort.
---
Abandoned Mine Shaft 1 might have a stray core at the silo thing that's glowing orange, think it's a sort of ventilation thing, as that thing is a typical spawn for cores.
---
AMS Testing Site has a generator and power armor spawn
---
Hornwrite Testing Site #03 has a power armor spawn 
---
Abandoned Mine Shaft 2 has a stray fusion core on the ventilation silo thing.
---
Red Rocket Filling Station has a power armor spawn
---
Mount Blair Trainyard has a generator and power armor spawn in the main building, a generator immediately outside of that building on the north side, and another generator and power armor spawn slightly further north of the building (like 30 meters). There very well could be a stray core or 2 somewhere here. I recommend going here first as you're most likely to get at least 2 cores immediately.
---
Abandoned Mine Shaft Elaine shares a power armor spawn location with the Mount Blair Trainyard.
---
Abandoned Mine Shaft 6 has a generator and a silo vent thing that could spawn a stray fusion core.
---
Directly south of the Mount Blair Workshop icon is a small building with a generator.
---
Abandoned Mine Shaft 3 has a silo ventilation thing that MIGHT spawn a fusion core (not sure on this one).
---
The Burning Mine has a power armor spawn that's slightly north east of the icon in a small building.
---
Belching Betty has a power armor spawn in the small building immediately outside the entrance (do not go inside the mine). This spawn doesn't have a power armor station. You'll find Bernie in that same building.
---
Camden Park has a generator and power armor spawn.
---
Abandoned Mine Shaft 5 has generator and silo vent thing that MIGHT spawn a core.
---
Hornwright Air Purifier Site #01 has a generator.
---
Brim Quarry has a generator next to a small building slightly north of the icon.
---
Abandoned Mine Shaft 4 has a power amor spawn and a silo vent thing that MIGHT spawn a core.
---
All of these, except for the Trainyard, are very small locations where you can just run in, grab, and run away from enemies, and quickly fast travel somewhere else before they catch up to you, all in 30-45 seconds. Best to do the Trainyard first as you're pretty damn likely to get 1-2 out of 5 spawns.
---
As someone who stepped away at level 2, I plan to return when there are less bugs, less eat/drink/craft/repair tedium, and pure PvE. All the original content is still there waiting for me.
---
100rounds? Ouch. 
---
The community has changed its attitude. What I don't agree with, is over simplifying the situation. While I don't mind the explosive nerf one bit, there are other aspects that made me and possibly others sour. From all things they push a dedicated PVP mode. Really, wtf? Communication is still suboptimal, lag / desyncs worse than ever before and the Atom shop still sports insane pricing.
---
IMO people are getting tired of waiting and hoping. Why does Todd not hold a press conference and give us the truth straightforward?
---
Your post makes you no different from the mob you described.
---
You have just contributed.
---
Looks like I won't be claiming any workshops for now, not that I ever even use them. I only claimed 1 workshop since the beta and didn't find a need for them probably because I'm a hoarder.
---
that does make sense, i will take your advice and try to enjoy my early game grind as much as possible :)
---
&gt;i hit this thing about once every 3 minutes for about 45-50 minutes
---
In any mature MMO, that would trigger an enemy's anti-cheese protection.  I would expect it to heal up or flee or become immune if you were just plinking it from max range for that long.  
---
Honestly though...if you are already lugging around 30+ lbs of keycards, why are you going on tilt for one more?
---
thanks man!!! my psn id is FritoZ if you ever see me on :)
---
i dump all my explosive vents , knuckles, ultra light marine , mr buzzy blade plans into that sucker.
---
Why? It's not like it's subscription based. They already have their money, and have said outright this is an experiment for them. Worst case, the crew gains exp, and they write off the effort on next years taxes.
---
I know! Gigabyte here (b350)... so many headaches. I guess that AMD does not officially support XMP, but how hard can it be for bios to read in ~12 numbers...
---
ryzen 2600 here. The game is totally playable with default settings, but feels so much better with tweaked timings.
---
Probably a mule account.
---
I agree. I was so hurt when I realized I couldn‚Äôt put gnomes in my camp.
---
Op is talking about scorch beasts, not the queen
---
Its really not the same.... ppl just love overexaggerating.
---
It has been thought of and it has been done.  Its just not a common thing.
---
yeah... 1 pie every 5 years!!! lol
---
&gt; We've actually evolved to avoid it.
---
Yeah... I [don't think so](https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-chimpanzee-violence-20140916-story.html). 
---
Nah what they needed was baseball bats.
---
If only they had used Melee or held out till the energy weapon buffs...
---
Or even just axes...
---
Hahahaha yeah.
---
Well, it's been a couple days.  I guess I didn't get a peek from the devs :(
---
Because they couldn't make as much money with the Atom Store then, as the game could be fully modded - not just client side.
---
I'm not saying that this would be a bad thing at all. Just that it's very likely the reason.
---
How the heck do you make such large structures? I have a large 4 story with a small outbuilding, and it takes 90% of my budget with no turrets or lighting.
---
Welp, division 2 is doing beta testing this weekend... there is that
---
Wanna come hang out in my distillery at Harper's Ferry and complain with me? 
---
Wait...you're carrying 30+ lbs of keycards on you?  And going on tilt for an hour trying to get one more?
---
Its not really an exploit. I was just a sucker. I had a bad feeling about it almost the whole time. But the game should do a better job of explaining the finer points of the game.
---
That‚Äôs totally griefing.  If you are on console they can follow you by your gamer tag too.
---
I'm laughing over here thinking about what sort of criteria could be used for this feature.
---
Killed in a 1-on-1 fight with something 50 levels lower or a pack of things 100 levels lower? It's the player's kid; boot him for server space.
---
Agreed: Only those that endure are still here

All others have left 
---
This^
---
I think that's what is going to happen with The Whitesprings and Top of The World in the future (hopefully) The Whitesprings can be bot economy/ player residence and Top of The World could be player vending but also be home to a lot of NPC'S or something

&gt;orthogonally

Nice usage.
---
And seeing as you don't know the definition of story, I'm not shocked you used it that way. Cheers, buddy.

I've gotten stuck aiming in 1st person multiple times. occasionally, it'll go out of the scope for a second then snap right back in and I have to bash or go to map to get out of it. Also gotten stuck trying to go into my pipboy twice. screen never loaded but I couldn't get the pipboy to lower. THe last time was in the midst of being attacked by molerats. 
---
World of Warcraft does, though obviously there are limits on the mods in a multiplayer environment.
---
\- Metal Gear Survive was a thing.
---
\- Ark Park but this might be a stretch its more Indi then AAA.
---
\-  The Quiet Man its published by Square Enix
---
And my favorit:
---
Battlefield 5 which, as a whole, is a good game but the community hates it, this goes hand in hand with Fallout 76.
---
Thats what I wanted also. A coop version of FO4, with a lotta quests and dialogue choices and factions to work for and an evolving living metastory they'd add content to with monthly patches or whatever.
---
thats not lazy, that takes more effort than dumping it into the nearest container in fact.
---
I agree hahah and its my kid XD
---
It is basically the same thing... except the grind has gotten slightly worse!
---
Connectivity I think is slightly better for some.
---
We won't stand for this!

__Gnomore!__

I'd like that too!

I remember that era. The era where games were tested for quality and if a game breaking bug made it through, they recalled them. Ahh, I miss complete games lol.
---
Just gonna point out it's a game... and is also giving West Virginia a spot light that normally would never happen. So as much as it isn't accurate you can't fault Bethesda for using it and making it a main part of the lore... VTU being there and all... They could have easily done Virgina or Ohio instead.
---
Always assume that  Legendary Robot will explode after killing it.  Loot an scoot as fast as possible or it will one shot you.
---
Most interactions have been great. Most people either want to be left alone or are happy to help out. The baddies do add flavor to the game. I had never been so pumped since FO:NV raider ambushes.
---
The budget in 76 is depressing. There ‚Äúwas‚Äù a workaround but it‚Äôs been fixed. Upside, I think I get to keep them. Downside, I can‚Äôt add anything to them like the player owned vending machines. Anything new won‚Äôt be applicable unless it‚Äôs put into an existing category (E.G. fish lamps from atom shop, or different floor types like AstroTurf)
---
Farming enough screws to craft rifles for the RNG mods is *tedious*, though.
---
Wouldn't TankKiller help with its basic lack of endgame usability? 
---
I read that!!!! I thought it was amazing! The best theory so far, it seems very plausible to me! The "nothing is real" graffiti and the messages to the secretary... it does resemble the "tranquility lane" in F3. The date never changing is also a good tell, maybe the best. And in the glitched department... there's a glitched wall texture in Huntersville that it's been there since the Beta. [https://i.imgur.com/9LQZeVh.png](https://i.imgur.com/9LQZeVh.png) I think it would be super funny and cool if it was revealed to be intentional. But, yeah, the "simulation theory" is THE best theory so far!
---
I just hope i can find the plans one day or pick up another. Now i have a 1000+ 5.56 rounds and nothing to run them through lol
---
I bought the game specifically for the PvP. I wish it was better...but I still bought it for the PvP. I hope they fix and improve it. 
---
I remember doing Swarm of Suitors a couple mos ago (back when it actually worker properly) was me and 1 other guy, the spawns took a while and we were just chatting, I could hear his kid on his end telling him knock-knock jokes and him playing along with them. It was a nice, genuine experience. 
---
More than likely, people claiming to have constant disconnects are exaggerating about how many. People love to inflate things. They feel it will get them more attention.
---
No one is going to care if you say, I was walking from Flatwoods to Sutton train station, and I got disconnected. 
---
Certainly people do experience different amounts of disconnects. I play with three friends regularly. Three of us tend to only disconnect when the servers crashes. The fourth, tends to just get dumped because of his internet connection. We all live in the same city, we all have the same internet provider. But different areas in the city have different quality. 
---
Sometimes one of us will have issues getting into the game. Things just go weird. But we never have the level of problems some people claim to have. 
---
Good to hear that some connection issues are at least being resolved.
---
I'll probably hold out a bit more, but idk if I'm being to hopeful that it will change too much. Maybe it's just not the game for me...
---
Not entirely sure ‚Äî needs more testing. From my experience, once I take the caps from the stash, the next time I log in the stash is no longer there. This only happens when the stash falls within the boundaries of my CAMP. 
---
An example is my current CAMP is built in the irradiated tunnel, east of Harper's Ferry. From Harper's, follow the bridge and train tracks east until you hit the tunnel. Inside there is a sidecar with a cap stash. I'm going on 4 days with the cap stash not appearing at all. This same thing happened at my last CAMP location, but doesn't occur in the wild. 
---
While I personally subscribe to that view, I also point out that not everyone wants slowly acquired "magic moments." To be honest, I suspect they're also the sort to say "there's no story" because it's not pounded into them at the tip of a big cutscene or yammering questgiver. Think of them as Hedonist Gamers, always striving to finish THIS game because there's ANOTHER game on the horizon, and experience is joy.
---
Nothing wrong with that, of course, it's just a different kind of person.
---
Yeah I know now :/ 
---
Uh? I run around in a hazmat suit just fine...
---
yea this game would have been better without any pvp.
---
I uesd my Quad explosive shotgun tesla for about 150 levels. Its a fun gun to use.
---
heheheh pun-tastic!
---
Me and a buddy with one random killed her in with less then three minutes into the event though she did just land and never took back off.
---
Yup. Its a magnet. A few lowbies will show up but the lvl100+ guys always show up and throw her a beat down. 
---
I like to show up and just grab as many plants as i can while vats poppin sbq. Works good
---
we need a leave a penny take a penny style container at vendor locations for just this reason.
---
To be clear, till another player kills you. at least, I think it has to be another player. 
---
I'm talking about non-legendary ones specifically because I've been one shot by them as well. They don't always play the self-destruction sound even if the timer is ticking (possible bug?). It's surprised me more than once so I just wanted to let new players know so they take proper precautions.
---
Yeah, not SBQ, far as I know she's not been changed yet.
---
Pvp kills pve games.  Period.  It is known.  Not sure why people keep discusing it like it's something new.
---
Your inner dad is coming out 
---
Glad someone asked, I've been eagerly awaiting some feedback from Bethesda.
---
I would really appreciate that but im on PS4. Thanks for the offer though.
---
the gnome god demands sacrifices! let the blood of a thousand vault dwellers soak the scorched earth
---
Any chance you can spoil it for me? Can‚Äôt find it and hate walking around trying to
---
Dude, I'm not talking about whether or not they have literal time to fix things, I'm talking about whether or not enough people will stay with the game long enough for them to fix it. People are dropping the game *now*. 
---
The *basic* promise of the game was that we would rebuild the wasteland. That is the *first* thing that was promised about the game. Which means it absolutely should be available *at launch*. And it is not. That is a failure.
---
Well they did Cali already and have focused mainly on coastal or wasteland like locations so it's nice to have a fresh look at a location that wasn't bombed and is full of greenery.... That being said I couldn't argue with having it set around the Puget Sound (Perfect setting to add mutuated fish, orcas, and octopus!).
---
I use the cash register by them that way if people accidentally pan over they see a some *'s and plans I can come back in 10 or 20 min and it will be filled with completely different stuff
---
Can't do that anymore they nerfed crit chaining last patch.
---
... I forgot about that. Yeesh. Point taken :)
---
Aliens!!!!
---
I am on PS4, I can make you a sweet ass handmade if you like.
---
Same - I drop ammo , other weapons etc at white springs - in the large crafting hub or outside any train station vendors - someone once did that for me when I was low level and it helped tremendously -  so do the same .  
---
Ome of the aspects of ark that i miss. 
---
Shit happens. Get a hazmat suit.
---
Right?  Need a fast travel point.  Thanks for free travel 
---
Might just be a safe guard left over from infinite cap stash days to make sure it can't be fenced in or whatever.
---
::singing:: Country roads...take me gnome
---
I agree! I'm also much more intrigued by things that are just hinted at! =\]
---
There we go. I was wondering how jumping in one place for a while would help out. Thanks! The revelation about the 50 ft is life changing. 
---
I have several 3 * legendary spinning arrow wheels for sale. HMU
---
Ya they do that sometimes I got downvoted for telling a guy how to get handmade plans lol
---
Aren't they randomly generated in the vendor menus? 
---
And sorry i won't trust advise from raider scum like yourself haha jk but for real...
---
This comment was made by 1k plus Melee gang.
---
Jokes aside, they really need to balance all weapons because as of right now enemies just eat your bullets.
---
Looking forward to read it!
---
Ah. Hopefully they increase the budget at some point for those of us who want to use it. I see very few large stuctures, I think most people just make some utilitarian structure they can drag around. 
---
Be glad they say anything here. They sure as hell can't be bothered on their own fucking forums.
---
Definitely flawed. They might need to make the circle bigger than the buildable area, though, to avoid some exploit where someone sits just on one side of the safe line and takes potshots at someone else inside the circle.
---
I had that happen to me I spawned in, in the middle of a nuclear zone and I would die before my game loaded of radiation happened 4 or 5 times before I had enough time to fast travel away. 
---
PVP isn't what was preventing this from being better
---
Does it only spawn during the night or something?
---
I wouldn't care if I could keep workshops without disconnect or crashing. My favorites are Charleston Landfill as it has 3 junk extractors. Then I have a few other favs, usually munitions factory, and whatever other materials I feel like stocking up on. Then a bunch of workshops with 1 junk extractor. Set them all up for practically nothing and free fast travel around them all. Workshops are the opposite of tedious farming for me. I love it, and if someone wants to challenge me I like to pvp too. This game could be great if there wasn't the looming crash or disconnect waiting to wipe out everything you spend your time on.
---
Never let my PA stand around on the floor, i always collect it at once, and i never "drop" it, lv 75 on PC and lv 130 on xbox, not lost 1 PA...
---
Only place i leave it while working on it is in the PA station.
---
lol wut.
---
If you haven't solo'd at least a Scorchbeast with a commie whacker, then you have *not* done everything there is to do in the game.
---
The irony of this post haha. 
---
All of my enjoyment from this game has been while playing alone.  So no.
---
cool! I like carry sets of bolstering (up to ~600 damage resist with perks, nice an tanky) and unyielding (running around with 25-30 strength and agility is fun!) 
---
Also with lvl 3 sneak I can creep up on just about anything and this:

---
Edit: also accusing others of lying or questioning their honesty can be perceived as insulting and will unsurprisingly be met with insults as well 
---
that happens like every 20 hours or so... Has a much higher lifespan then paper bags, that is for sure.  less likely for them to fall through the ground as well.
---
I have picked up a few plans from other players from cash registers and the oversears caches, and have left hundreds around.
---
Idk. But it have the feeling i have seen those before. Was it in fallout 4?
---
Anti-armour reduces energy resistance? 
---
Are you placing it by using confirm or dropping it like stuff that goes in a paper bag?
---
yep even a bloodied gatling gun can chunk down the queen solo pretty fast.
---
The recent patch made all plans available. You should be able to find the Handmade plan on a few different vendors now.
---
Could just make them a separate hive. And you know.. Then add mod support... So people could make a Co op story mod 
---
I don't know, but the game considers camp fires as dirt for a variety of things. You can plant crops on it, water purifiers, and now apparently foundations. So radscorpions why not :) 
---
Can‚Äôt wait for dedicated pvp servers. 
---
Why is Bethesda?
---
Is this a quest that triggers somewhere ? :) if so, i haven seen it...
---
 ROTFLMFAO. You are a silly person. If a bug only happens to you its not a bug, its your machine. 
---
100% with you.
---
I make sure my workshop is open. My Water Purifier is available. And I recently moved my camp to a very easy location for beginner players to find. Too easy, probably. 
---
But PVP? Nope. Lot of games offer it. All of them do it better. 
---
My level 45 vicious aligned lever action with full bloody mess and full rifleman can barely touch a level 58 bloated glowing one. It sucks.
---
I always have pacifist mode on, just in case.
---
And a couple of days ago some little nit who was WANTED came around and started slapping me.  I ignored it for a while then just lost it and unloaded about 20 shotgun rounds into his face.
---
No effect?  WTF!  Damn, I forgot I had pacifist mode on.
---
Meh, I stopped logging in once I realized they were not going to fix some of the quest issues anytime soon (I'm still stuck on some of my main quests).
---
This is just another nail in the coffin for me. Doubt I will ever play Fallout 76 again if this goes in.
---
Auto crits assultrons and other robots.
---
Give it a use
---
ive been scouting the map for good camp locations for a sniper tower.  all the popular camp locations (2 resources) and all of the vendors could be traps at any time.  im trying to get in the right mindset.  probably going to start a new character on release
---
Pretty much. Got to level 60, did two blast zones and realized there's nothing left for me to do but grind for TSE's and side quests. 
---
I wanted to play a grindy game, I'd go play runescape. I'll play again when there's more things to do as a group.
---
Also, events blow. I've played 20 events and about 30% of the time there will be another player there, but its just so repetitive. Kill the mole miners that spawn in the exact same location, go kill these robots again. Kill these ghouls again you just did exactly yesterday, noty
---
The type-o's here are awesome!! At least I hope they are type-o's.
---
I always try to sell those, but no vendors have caps lmao
---
Here's a question for you.
---
If a game kept disconnecting every 3-11 minutes once you got into the actual game. How long would you keep trying before you gave up?
---
Please Define Drop...You should never "Drop" Power Armor  (ie the drop button, R on PC, not sure on consoles).  You should use it and place it like it was an item in your camp.  It shows up as a green (when place-able) outline, and you press E (again on PC) to confirm.  Then you enter it.
---
No, obviously
---
That's true. 
---
But you can help people without PVP. We cant avoid base destroying trolls with PVP.
---
I have played hundreds of hours and pvp is pretty rare.  Only time you can count on it is if you have a bounty on yourself or you go looking for it.  
---
I would guess boredom is a primary motivator. Can't wait for PvP mode so they can scarper off.
---
funny, few inside the vaults they posted this 
---
"We want to have conversations with you ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs about patches, new content or things you want to know about."
---
Only conversations here are /u/ladydevann saying "Ill send this to the devs" ... and as far as we've seen, everything you send the dev team just gets tossed in the trash can.  Must be a frustrating job you have there.   
---
If you still have it (on pc) I'll take it for an alt. 
---
Tell that to the legendary deathshead I just ran into with 2 friends.  2 dead.  
---
12gb ram
---
Win 10
---
Temps are normal for gpu
---
Cpu is above average
---
Maybe Toddy and Petey will finally come out of hiding? Doubt it though. Must be hard for Motormouth Hines to keep his mouth shut for this long.
---
100% yes.... simply not enough skill required to pvp
---
really should be a timer or invulenrability on login where you can take or deal damage. but yeah this is probably low on the list of things to do, most likely on the never fix list.
---
Time to find a new weapon. 
---
Or don‚Äôt log out in one of the two hotspots for nuking?
---
Even worse if your camps near these deathrings 
---
Because my Instigating Explosive Gauss rifle is instaGIB
---
Good to know. I skipped that generation. Don‚Äôt know how many times my kid turned my OG Xbox off. 
---
It makes me think of this haha https://youtu.be/-ijyVl1RSkk?t=33
---
Somebody will always find a loophole. 
---
Yes they do. One of my teammates purchase the XMAS emotes and such with cash.
---
Upvoting for views. Good luck comrade!
---
PONY PONY PONY!!!! 
---
I always fast travel to my base before i log off
---
Ive found a few legendaries and ammo in them. The key is to wait until right before and right after the nuke is dropped in that area and then check all the containers.
---
Some people use the trash cans, others news paper dispensers, register, suitcase and sometimes i even find stuff on the corpses.
---
Lmao love the diablo reference
---
For someone who is interested in joining a discord, would you provide instructions on how they could :D?
---
Oh lord. AP is certainly extra damage against armored targets.  Lots of enemies have no armor at all. Ghouls for instance. Its why they are farmed so enthusiastically.
---
As many enemies in the game do sport serious armor is why I want that mag.
---
WTF, I've played almost every day since mid December, have around 130 hours in it, and I'm only level 58.  What is it that you're doing to gain so many levels so quickly?  Or are you playing 6 hours a day?  Did you just fly through everything?  I'm still not even done with the main quest line and still having a blast.
---
"Battlefield 5 which, as a whole, is a good game but the community hates it, this goes hand in hand with Fallout 76."
---
BFV has a ~80% FO76 has a 50%. It's a much larger disaster. 
---
These suggestions make me laugh. They need 3 months to flip a pvp switch and make a new game mode ( that will be buggy on release guarantee) and people still come up with the most random ideas. Don't get me wrong, they are good ideas. Sadly there are so many things more important on their plate right now that will take months if not years to accomplish before they can start adding actually creative and interesting features.
---
Please delete that last line. So cringey.
---
It also happens that griefers are an easily addicted subset of gamers. They often get hooked on the rushes they get from making others miserable.
---
 It's why so many of these newer games have the PVPVE modes: they know there will be lots of pve focused players who dont care about pvp and thus make easy targets for their griefer addicts.
---
I already have a kingdom in game with a castle, inn, haunted house, and about 8 member so far. 
---
We roleplay, give quests, pvp, and just play the game sometimes. 
---
We are on PC if you are interested. Some of our members are.... Special.. Thats a warning. 
---
It takes a special kind of player to want to run up to random players and roleplay over the mic to invite them to seek an audience with our king. 
---
Looking to expand. We have no rules. But we do have a lawyer who ensures the kingdom upholds the constitution of the terms and conditions. 
---
I can see a need for this in the future.  Depending how you want to play the game.  I just want a working game right now though. 
---
Please let us remake the quest items for the mistress if mystery (voice of set and blade of bastet). I got rid if mine to save space thinking I could re craft it later.
---
 Yes he is. Wallace with the smooth voice. ;)
---
That‚Äôs actually the same problem I have run into 
---
If I can play and enjoy those few minutes, i‚Äòd do it for the entire day and make a check list how often it happens 
---
In the same boat as you, but don‚Äôt have kids. It‚Äôs not hard for me to understand that some people have more free time than me. 
---
Players who spend hundreds of hours in game are the biggest spenders in game as well. So it would make sense for BGS to give those players something to do. 
---
I think they should remove the stars from spawns.  Legendary mobs should always drop a legendary that can randomly be between 1-5 stars (or whatever if you want to control balance).  Then, dramatically increase legendary   
---
 creature spawn rates.  Also you should be able to tell how many stars it has in inventory without inspecting it.
---
It seems like double jeopardy that you have chance to find a 3 star legendary then another chance at getting a decent 3 star legendary in the loot (if anything at all thanks to return of that bug).
---
It will be interesting to see how people build camps in PVP. I bet most will be bare necessities. I like the idea of using a sniper tower but I hope they buff ranged before the PVP release. 
---
I think the meta is going to be groups with small squads and scouts.  4-8 man teams with different roles will be fun. I've learned through testing that scouts are so important if you want to keep your wanted level. Alternatively, you can use your squad to clear bounties and pick up your stuff. 
---
I'm also curious what are the best Mutations to try to lock in with Starched Genes for a sniper build, or if this isn't really necessary?
---
I'll often drop stimpacks since I always seem to have 200+ of them. Basic known plans, even ammo, radaway and low level legendary armor and weapons if I somehow get it at my high level
---
I‚Äôm level 50, what should I use? The lever action with all those perks does 145 or so and tears through deathclaws and scorchbeasts like butter, yet it has an insanely hard time with glowing ones.
---
There are definitely sustainability questions about it...but on the plus side, they won't have to TELL the grandchildren about it, they can SHOW them the videos (assuming the grandkid's 3d holographic noserings can play the things of course) :)
---
Didn't play FO4? A water gun was literally part of the main Nuka quest line
---
It just works
---
Cyberpunk 277 - Oh yea for sure I will leave Fo76 behind it. Witcher 3 was one of the greatest RPG's ever made. Such a density in Story... the direct opposite of what Fallout became...  
---
Outer Worlds - Isn't that from the Studio which made the best Fallout since Fallout 1+2. Not a second I need to think about this decision.
---
How Fo76 could get me back afterwards? Real Stories with real npcs. 1200 Stash limit. No caps limit. 4x Higher Camp Budget. And ongoing new dlcs where I can explore vaults with others together, need to team up and get really great loot.
---
Will it come in that way. I doubt it.
---
I cant speak for others but personally I really enjoyed the game and would come back in a heart beat if there was more to do or if the difficulty was organically ramped up a significant amount.   Currently the only thing that doesnt die quickly to my sniper build is the queen and she is a fuck fest of who cares.  The fights in this game are too easy and there is 0 intelligence from my enemies.  So barring some massive overhaul in the AI it is going to take some real pve story driven content to bring me back.  And I would come back gladly if that happens.
---
Exactly. Why can‚Äôt we do things like have a giant hermit crab where one player has to man a sonic generator or other rebuff while the others wail away? Anything like that would be great. Or a mega death claw bursting out of the power plant stacks when you turn on the power? Etx
---
I'm out of stuff to do as well. Started with a new playthrough of Fo4 and Farcry 5.
---
What about all the plush animals? no love for them? only for cold, unfeeling gnomes? Mr. Fuzzys need good homes too. 
---
Seriously though, if you want to put something people would actuall;y want in the atom store - display shelves for collectables where you can place the robot models, gnomes, stuffed animals, etc... would be nice. 
---
Bethesda doesn't know how to make multiplayer online games and they seemingly refused to learn from other games that have been around for 15 years. I really do think it was a cash grab where they invested very little into the creation of the game. They have already cashed their ticket, they don't care about the longevity of the game or even selling stuff at the atom store. It was over before it started. 
---
This is fucking ridiculous. Why destroy your base? What does it achieve? Are people so pathetic that they need this sadistic little false power trip?
---
Game is already in trouble. Now we are losing players because of pvp griefing. Why is it even allowed?
---
If Bethesda wanted to get rid of trolls and griefers they would either give us pve servers, or have pacifist mode extend damage immunity to camps. Doing neither screams "we need the easily addicted little sadists because we are desperate for players."
---
It should have been a guild or a covenant thing like in Dark Souls. You could help, you could defend others, or you could attack and become raiders. 
---
Don't go to the Middle Mountain Cabins then, there is always 3 radscorpions or those big azz bees...they tend to rotate between the two. if you can get into a cabin and shut the door you can shoot them from the windows and they can't touch you. Its a good way to farm some legendary stuff
---
Seems like a stretch just to keep players from having access to a free 20-30 caps every few days. 
---
I've also noticed the junk placed around CAMP locations takes a lot longer to respawn or was removed from the game as of the last patch. Again with my last CAMP location, there was a desk that had a few junk items on it that always respawned once a day. After the patch, the typewriter never appeared again. 
---
Remember kids, when you try to attack someone and they say no, if you keep attacking them, that's raid. 
---
No one likes a raid~~ist~~er
---
&gt;More wall/floor/roof options, nothing zany just good reusable essential assets
---
So very much this. They can even do what they did on the floors. Why do we have something like ten variations on the floors but only *one* set of walls with shutters, and only four wall types total? Just do the same thing they did with the floors for walls. Take the base hardwood walls and make a "Light" and "Dark" version, as a start. Then start adding additional things like stucco walls, stone facade, Vinyl siding, cladding, two-sided brick (brick on both sides instead of brick on one side and dirty drywall on the other), cement walls (so we can make something that looks like a bunker without using the foundation stacking exploit), and so on. There are so many options that are all just reskins of the existing objects and they're leaving atoms on the table by not making them.
---
Oh, and for the love of all that is holy, ***please*** add in more kinds of roof. There are more kinds of roof than metal sheeting. How about thatched? Asphalt? Shingles? Clay tiles? Slate? And if you want to get *really* creative (and win about a billion points with the community as a whole) add in a "*Green*" roof option that is just a flat roof tile with grass on it that we can plant crops in. 
---
Oh, and can we *please* have more kinds of railings, as well as "support beams" so I can make a proper balcony without it looking like the balcony roof is just hanging freely?
---
I kind of agree with you... and I'm one of those people that play video games about 4-5 hours a day. After work. I don't have any family, I live alone. Gaming is my "television" addiction.  But, I see the point that the others here are making and I do agree with that too, I love FO76, but I am getting bored. We do need some substantial content. Preferably the substantial part being Quality over Qunatity.   :)
---
I dump mine at the popular SBQ fighting place along with ammo and other things I don't need. Seems to have a higher chance of someone using them. I only do this when there is a nuke going on tho.
---
It really reminds me of my time as a waiter for a shitty cafe.
---
Handing people plates of hot garbage and having them respond as if I cooked the food is very demoralizing.
---
The solution was to quit. Pretty shitty what they are heaping on to the CMs here. 
---
You can see who the real trashcan human beings are in this sub though. The ones directly attacking and mocking the CMs who are just doing their jobs, within the guidelines of their employment, like all the rest of us. Those people can go ahead and get fucked.
---
Good to know thanks a lot.
---
Dont care. Not even a little bit. That's a pvp balance issue. Once they have their own servers, Bethesda can work it out. Because right now, organized groups can still take over servers. Moving pvp to separate servers just ensures pve players dont suffer thereby.
---
Yeah I can not type well with gloves on. 
---
Yes, I agree, it is cooler with a team 
---
In one Call of Duty years ago they tried that. It works fine, until the host left the game. Then you had to wait for 20-30 seconds for host migration. But then often I was assigned as new host. Yes, the one with potentially the slowest connection ever. Had just mobile WiFi, no cable. So seconds after the host migration was finished, everyone else got disconnected, because my WiFi couldn't handle that traffic.
---
TL;DR: Sounds good, does not work. Only works if the host does not leave (no host migration) and has a good connection.
---
If we had this, it would make a huge difference to me.  
---
yup, you are right, i just chose garden gnomes as they are wonderfully goofy and sometimes creepy, but all the teddy bears and kids toys and teapots shaped like houses and giddyup buttercups all need a place in our homes!
---
Yeah it gets kinda boring after you find all the locations and kill the SBQ about 100 times. Meanwhile you have games like Fortnite sponsoring and paying community creators and releasing new content almost every day it seems. It‚Äôs obvious they pulled an EA or Activision on us. Releasing a broken game and not showing any care or updates because they‚Äôre busy working on there latest piece of shit game or jerking off in a bathtub full of our money
---
How and what do you stack to achieve those numbers!?!?
---
Spec up your glow sight perk card. You‚Äôll cut through them like butter. 
---
YES!! i giggled, my co-workers gave me a strange look
---
If i get a chance to play tonight ill add you. Im always looking for someone to team up with. And the rifle would be awsome.
---
But you haven't answered the question. If the game kept disconnecting every 3-11 minutes, how long would you keep trying before you gave up and played another game?
---
That will be easy. I don't play at all anymore.
---
[PC] I never got an animation (even on FO4). Checked his AM with GRS level 3, after 10 or more kills got no AP refill, but it seemed to be working yesterday. I am encumbered, maybe that is an issue. 
---
Supposedly ‚Äúbest‚Äù legendary I ever got was a 3* ghoul slayer‚Äôs nocturnal explosive radium rifle.
---
Sold it. Ghoul slayer‚Äôs on a radium rifle? Wtf?
---
Yes, but really... you can play mad-libs with this and it is hard to go wrong...
---
"Anyone feel like FO/76 would have been considerably better if _________ and not ________?"
---
TBH not a terrible suggestion.    
---
I mean FIXING the issue(s) would be better, but yes, can't argue 
---
I don't disagree about the SBQ. With one violent night, you can't tell how far in progress the event is unless you've been monitoring your map fairly regularly, and even then, its unclear when someone's has actually started it rather than when it become available. At least with Scorched Earth there's a server-wide notice that goes out for the event. 
---
Can you give me actual numbers for CPU? FX cpu temps are different than Intel or ryzen you might be throttling if it's running too high.
---
What does that one do?
---
That, is a great suggestion. I've been lucky enough to have very few connection issues. Thanks!
---
 I quit fast traveling, that helped a lot as I get in random trouble just by traveling from place to place. I find that amusing, and I get to look at more people's CAMPs. 
---
‚ÄúGeneral. Another settlement needs your help. I‚Äôll mark it on your map.‚Äù
---
you couldnt avoid it in fallout 4 either, which is enitrely single player
---
Sorry, on XBOX
---
So drop is the X button, and yes drop to the PA station.
---
i wonder whats the difference between x and s? walmart near my house has both. i look at the siding panel but both says the exact same thing. there was nothing written different between the 2.
---
Glow sight does plus damage to glowing ones. Perception special is memory serves. 
---
I miss filling a bathtub with beers, or a quantum nuka cola... That lights up the room! 
---
Those are MMO-like numbers for play hours. It becomes almost a second life. Among my friends who have played MMOs, their current game is pretty much all they do between getting home from work and going to bed. It can be a family activity if their partner is playing the game, too. From the outside, I always feel angry because I basically lose my friend for a month or several months until they come back and start hanging out doing real things again. Also, some people do not need nearly as much sleep each day as others. If you only need 6 hours of sleep to feel refreshed, that's 2 more hours every day that you can do whatever you want with.
---
I tried building over the Tesla, but it's not that reliable and it causes the game to crash constantly (especially the charge mod at a big crowd). It does need a good number of fixes/buffs. The automatic mod for example, does crap damage and burns through the 15 shots within a second.
---
It also sucks that they removed the lobbing mod, so it cant be used as an electric mine setter.
---
But I just did...?
---
&gt; for the entire day 
---
... have we arrived at the point where you accuse me of lying and I have to insult you and you get to proof your point?
---
I have too much perception(14), yet I barely use vats. I think i‚Äôll just save my shotgun that does 198 for the glowing ones.
---
The latter as in a paper bag.
---
survey in game? most people dont even talk in game.
---
Exactly!!!!!!!!
---
My opinion on that is people will return, but only for a week or so. Most people who quit the game have done everything there is to do. Once content is released and there are no other "hot/fresh" survival games out there, people will come back to this to try it out. I doubt they will play for more than a week as bethesda truly can't pull off adding long meaningful content and almost any other game you play will feel better than Fallout 76. As you said, there's Cyberpunk. There's also metro, subnautica expansion, new dying light and so many others that will come out. I've stopped playing f76 a month ago and played the anthem demo recently. The demo with it's average story felt like a more complete experience. Seeing human npcs talk honestly made me smile.
---
Rahool was a bastard then for sure
---
Kinda reminds me of how fallout 4 was when you could sell pre-war money for caps! My bf taught me that. Wonder why they didn‚Äôt add it in this game.. 
---
That's why you're losing it. Stop dropping it. 
---
Agreed, I've had disconnects during OVN, usually close to the end of the event which is way more frustrating than maybe not getting some loot from the night stalker. 
---
So, you are willing to sit there, log into a game, get disconnected every 3-11 minutes, and keep doing this for say 8 straight hours?
---
As others have said, do not ever, ever "drop" power armor.   
---
You deploy it.  
---
You can tell the difference by the "place" icon you get, which indicates **red** where it cannot be placed and **green** where it can be.   
---
I have a shameful amount of time in '76 and a mule with 32,000 pounds of collect power armor pieces and frames and I've had hundreds of CTD's, freezes, etc and have yet to loose a single frame.  
---
Single pieces yes, but never a frame
---
I never accept trade requests from anyone no matter the level. Even more suspicious from lower levels. If you need a handmade and on PS4 I can make them all day. Since they changed the vendor's plans are always there,
---
ONLY trade with your friends, if you haven't got any playing with people you meet. Get to know them enough to trust them.
---
Good Luck
---
RC
---
I get non stop spinning windows, not even sure if a legendary was in there
---
OK awesome, thanks so much.
---
hahahah yes, those are good memories
---
i also was a sweet roll collector, for no particular reason
---
Yeah. We never even got the promised known issues list.
---
UwU what's this?
---
"Didn't play arguably the worst game in the franchise pre-76? There was a (insert dumb novelty weapon here) in the themepark DLC!" 
---
I admit 
---
I have no life 
---
I prefer more [scholarly articles](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/94f0/dda4e037460ba60830adbc0d348d6e77021e.pdf) than the Los Angeles Times, personally\~
---
PVP is only one of many things wrong with this game. There are far worse matters at hand.
---
Well. I guess this is one of the reason why there is currently not such a function.
---
See I am playing together with my wife. We are both on different xbox and different provider and there are situations we get both kicked from the server. Even friends get kicked of the same time. So the server or lets say the instance got recycled or crashed or something else. In this particular situation its not possible to reconnect. The button would not work. This would make people unhappy again.
---
This is why they need to improve the stability of the servers and the client over the reconnect button. 
---
It is just a quick example. 
---
Don't get me wrong. I understand the request. I would like to have such a button too. But it's technically not possible to reconnect to a server/instance which does not exist anymore.
---
There was another thread about them yesterday. The short answe is, those bronze faces resemble the art deco faces in fallout 1, 2 and 3. Buuuuuuuut started showing up in weird, weird locations (like at the bottom of dunwich borers mine in 4), in the bottom of lucky hole, two creepy shrines built post-war in watoga, discretely placed as decorations in Whitsprings, Garrahan mansion and the Robco facility. Thw Garrahan mansion also has a moth cultist outfit, and there are moth shrines in Lucky Hole.
---
The prevailing theory now is that they are connected to the Interloper and Mothman cults somehow. I further speculate that they may be related to the anient alienn civilization Lorenzo Cabot explored, and hinted at also existing beneath the Mojave. I say this because his crown looks to be the exact same style as the giant faces.
---
Have to disagree, we do represent the community.   
---
My gutted in game friends list, less than 1/6th of what it was before "Black Tuesday"(trademark pending) which scales very well to this Sub's lost user base.   
---
We also have a nice sprinkling of griefers, RP'ers, helpful and hurtful people.  
---
This. Another thing I don‚Äôt get is the fact that a level 18 1* liberator will load instantly, but a 3* mutant overlord will be spinning until it despawns.
---
[https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xbox-one-s-vs-xbox-one-x/](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xbox-one-s-vs-xbox-one-x/)
---
Totally agree.  I have no desire for it to be PvP... and I do like PvP, but I don't want it when playing FO.
---
Can we just get Scorch beasts removed from the game or at least some mechanic that forces them to land? They are literally one of the wost-designed encounters I have ever seen in a game.
---
I recently gave my  Somerset Special  and 400 rnds of ammo to a noob (I'm lvl 53, the gun was a lvl 5). I wasn't about to drop it in a box and let a server crash delete it forever, had to make sure it went to a good home.
---
Didnt know ultracite was something people needed to farm. What are you using it for besides pa?
---
I was surprised that I continue to find more of those funny staged gnome/stuffed animal scenes. just noticed the one by by Autumn acre cabin the other day. I'm guessing there has to have been a photo thread with shots of some of these, and if not, time to start one...
---
I know there's nothing else you can do, and I don't blame you in the slightest - you're one of the best CM's I've ever seen. But this response is tired :(
---
In order to create it, you need it. That's a little zen-like.
---
It makes the weapon ignore 50% of all DR on your target. 
---
One counter point.   
---
For things like the queen..   
---
There should be a "you've done damage" check, otherwise everyone will show up and cause the queen to scale to nearly impossible levels 
---
I get all my Ultracite from Nuke Zones. Kill enemies, loot bodies, scrap hardened masses. Hell I sell most of my Ultracite because that way gets me so much. 
---
Also the only way a mirelurk king is giving you a star towards becoming a general is if it is legendary.
---
Great write-up but honestly that is a lot of effort for something that is far easier to come by in a Nuke Zone. 
---
They went PvP because I‚Äôm sure they were planning on implementing a battle royale mode. Probably thought it would be super popular and rival Fortnite and PUBG.
---
We can all see how that worked out.
---
Controlled economy I'd suspect. I kind of like the idea of a daily limit, I just wish there was a tit-for-tat trading system like in the other fallout games. 
---
&gt; until survival mode is balanced
---
ETA: never
---
OK, that makes a lot of sense. At least I can rebuild again. Thank you. 
---
Bethesda doesn't want to support the game. They are actively trying to sink it.
---
Ahhh okay I see, yeah I figured about the AP regen too, I use it aswell, but I've macro'd my mouse so that I can click a button and I'll take a nuka cola or any other Ap regen item I have while fighting in one place, but interesting to know that you can't take multiple people at once, I've never been in that situation before, max was two people who were trying to get me back cause I took one of their mates bounty XD
---
Oh wait we skipped the part where you openly accuse me of lying and I get to insult your mental faculty to only make selective statements count to any of your arguments 
---
The forums are down, game shouldn't be.
---
They probably had too much flame one night.
---
Lol.
---
Better idea, we should be allowed to send items through the PRIZE BOT, and record voice messages for him to deliver when he does.
---
Lol, guy white knights for a corporation that would piss on his face if they could.
---
I usually have the hotspots marked on an offline map where people set up bases I also built a mobile camp with nothing but artillery and missile launchers. Find base, drop artillery, destroy shit, run back to base and let ppl get dumped on.  Then repeat.  
---
Its this week's Into the Vault, its sooo big and ram packed full of goodness and fixes and content its crashed Bethesda!
---
I mean - not everyone is a working father/mother. The obvious answer is people aged 14-25 that are in education. Most of those dont meet with their SO every day, but also play on voice chat with their friends every other evening for 3-5 hours. You can easily hit 200 in 3 months with that amount of time - especially when the group spirit is more on the efficient side of things and not so much on taking 10 hours to build a camp. You also have to keep in mind that it was way easier to level up earlier in the games life cycle, even without exploiting. (lv30-50 in like 3-4 hours grinding solo in watoga highschool for example, whitespring nukes would net a level up every few minutes, etc)  
---
There are other demographics too that have lots of spare time. People that don't have jobs, older people, even fulltime working singles have 6 hours or so almost every day. And yes - there are also people that play "too much" and could have a much "better life" if they wouldn't. Oh wait, that is not my call to make and maybe they chose to do so and are happy that way. Other people pour hours into making miniature railways or drive rc cars or read a 1000 page fantasy novel each week.   
---
On the "should devs care": Probably not, but you can design some systems in a way to give meaningful stuff to do without taking away from the more casual playing audience. Often that is some sort of PvP or "optimal loot" carrot. Both of those are kinda terribly designed in fo76. There are also games that have more advanced unlock systems for crafting plans or timegate stuff to keep players coming back. There are options out there, but fo has none of them. It is just not realistic to keep players enganged with farming legendaries or scorch queens when there is no incremental upgrade in sight and most stuff you get (if they drop any) is the same useless crap.
---
I just need magazines I think but I don't have the energy or motivation to even attempt getting it. There's just nothing to do anymore and probably won't be for a long time to come
---
The only vendor in the bunker that works any more is the center one in the armory off the command center.
---
I leave goodies in blue suitcases at train stations every time I play
---
I use power armor 100% of the time, but power armor doesn't need more benefits than regular armor (until you can wear the Radiation suit under your regular armor at least).
---
I think PVE is fine but that's not really the issue. Griefing is always going to happen no matter the level. I was level 110 when some person( level 19 with an explosive weapon) was being a dick. 
---
You have three choices. 
---
\- Leave the Server
---
\- Block him so you don't see him and visa versa
---
\- fight back
---
He had a base at the back side of Whitespring golf course and it would shoot at me for just being inside. 
---
Well, I pulled out my Explosive Gatling and leveled his house.
---
The Choice is yours. After I did that he was cool and wanted to be friendly. I didn't and left the server.
---
I said something very similar back in October, asking where they got the idea that Fallout players were PvP players. I also pointed out the dichotomy of releasing a game about rebuilding civilization and being trained in a vault to work together in doing it then include blowing each other up. I put it down to bandwagon jumping, PvP was hot, but those are games that are PvP specific and not based on co-op survival, arguably Fallout has been a game that pushes the player to find NPC's and help them, protect them and in FO4 rebuild and protect their homes. I didn't get into FO1 or 2 as that isometric view gives me headaches and may be wrong here but don't think they were about going and killing anything that moved either. Just my 1.5 cents CAD.
---
&gt;They will most likely, alter this so solo trips in aren't allowed
---
Why would you think that?  just silly to think they'll lock an existing area with the requirement that you be in a team.
---
Me and my buddies have started role playing. I know that sounds kinky, but it's not what you think. Last week we were the unstoppable. Collecting bounties from evil doers and even staging an attack on a workshop so the unstoppable can come in and save the day. This week we are farmers. Trying to fill the entire field with crops at billings homestead.
---
yeah I've found a few of the teddy bear staged instances, always make me smile :)
---
I agree a thread of pics of them would be a fun idea, i'll have to remember to take pics when i find them from now on
---
Woah woah woah don't diss the drill man, one day there gunna make a new way to open locks, and it will be with that drill which you threw away, multiple times
---
I understand more free time for sure but those kind of levels I think are unsustainable.  I mean there is how many games coming out? Eaxh of them have enough content for 10 hour bouts per day? I mean that can't be sustained these games are gonna get less and less players cuz each game takes your life to complete.  It's not healthy it's not sustainable
---
Todd Howard is laughing somewhere 
---
Yes! And drop ceilings so you can have a gabled roof and flat ceiling as well as being able to hide conduit between the ceiling and the roof.
---
I saw that happen before, tried to pick it up, couldn't, then looted a nearby dead legendary and found the gun I saw. 
---
I've encountered that.  It was probably looted from a body but the gun itself didn't disappear from the ground.  Kinda like when you can't pick a soot flower because while you can see it,  the game hasn't reset it yet 
---
Had a fun duel last night. Guy was 60 levels below me. I trolled him and he killed me.  Then it turned fun and we just met on the bridge by Harper s ferry.  He def owned me.  He was 1/4 health most of the time so I assume it was bloodied or instigating.   Was a lot of fun
---
Why even have them in the game then? They're no better at killing "minor foes" than are rifles. Also, there are movies, games, and books where people have used pistols in all kinds of settings as primary weapons. It's a flavor thing. If they're there, you should be able to main them. Hence the "gunslinger" trope, which is an impossible character to play in this game. 
---
They basically did the same mistake that Bethesda did with 76, changing the formula without previous warning. Players got all excited because they wanted a new game, and instead they got a "sort of the same, right guys?" Got the same degree of angry fanboi for the efforts, as well :)
---
I'd be willing to engage in PVP and get wanted status for attacking someone's C.A.M.P. for the first time if i saw one covered in gnomes. ;P 
---
Yep sometimes item that are supposed to inside a corpse fall to the ground. but usually its lootable. Possibly it wasnt because it was someone elses corpse loot.
---
The tombing the workshop in stash boxes is a complete buzz kill, and I've managed to get workshops from people who have done this without getting a bounty (I play solo so I'm not part of pvp caps exploit gang, just hate people if I see them tomb the workshop, complete game kill, so i contest for it just to get back at them and scrap all the stash boxes :) )
---
Just a random menu glitch. A lot of people have it happen.
---
Hopefully there is room for town building in those areas too.
---
There is a pretty rare legendary effect called quad that quadruples the magazine capacity. So you could shoot 4 times without reloading.
---
Specifically, Pittsburgh to Morgantown is about an hour and a half drive.
---
Hell, we're in Appalachia, we should be able to build a cement resources node just about anywhere.
---
I think it's not just one CoD, they had been doing that from CoD 4 until Black Ops 2. And yeah dedicated servers are better ( good ones that is ) so you don't have to be at the mercy of other people's terrible internet.
---
Y'all are in the wrong universe. This is post apocalyptic nightmare world. Trust no one.  Survival at all costs. What about Fallout makes you think anyone could ever be your friend? Friendly fire should be 100% damage all the time. We should be stealing gear from each other, not just junk. This game is already tame enough. Fallout is strictly for adults. It should be gross, scary, and difficult. There should be consequences. 
---
Ok, for a minute I thought there was a patch that I had missed.
---
&gt;The game already knows...
---
Kill it before it lays eggs!
---
See, you really aren't answering the question. Saying, the entire day is a vague answer. An entire day is 24 hours. Should I take you literally?
---
Also, you never said this had happened to you. Where you kept getting disconnected every 3-11 minutes. 
---
But you seem to want to have people believe that you would be willing to sit there for many hours, just trying to play the game. Hours and hours of logging in, getting a few minutes of play, being disconnected and trying all over again.
---
You also seem to want us to believe that if you enjoyed those 3-8 minutes worth of playing, it's worth it to have to keep logging in over and over because you keep getting disconnected.
---
So kind of making my point for me. 
---
I found garbage plans, and a legendary addicts shish kebab and a legendary nocturnal pipe. I left fusion cores, recipes and doubles of recipes I found. I always leave something at the railroad stations..level 44
---
Read this, checked, same issue.
---
No forum in sight, bookmarks take me to the dashboard, the community tab takes me to the dashboard, google searches that link directly to posts, take me to the dashboard.
---
Seems at the moment the Bethesda forums don't exist.
---
Maybe they released a new Inside the Vault and it was so horrendous that the internet itself rebelled, to save all the anger that will stem from this weeks nerf announcements or complete lack of acknowledgement of the laundry list of bugs that were introduced with the last patch.
---
Thank you for that, I wish I could give an immediate answer to this but the first steps is talking to the Dev's about it and raising that awareness, then they gather together and discuss what they want/can do about it. Which then takes time to implement. I wish I could make something happen immediately but unfortunately game development is a process.
---
People are trying, but I will be the first one to resurect it.
---
I may be in the minority, but I don't want separate servers. I enjoy the options the way they are now without being pigeonholed into a separate server situation. I like the fact that I never know what to expect when I see another human. Will they be friendly? Will they attack or trick me somehow? Will they be jerks repeatedly? Can I safely take over a workshop? Can I help defend the munitions factory someone else is using? Or will that end badly? Can I trust someone to use my radshower or jukebox and then turn them off? The fact that I don't know appeals to me. There really is nothing on the map that is necessarily a co-op situation so the whole "everyone-working-together" sort of idea doesn't really fit. Working together for what?  Even with a griefer (in this case someone who repeatedly repeatedly does whatever annoys you), you signed on to a game with other humans, some of which are jerks or have different ideas of what constitutes fun, so maybe you can switch servers to get better humans or find a way to get out of their sights.
---
I feel for you, but... why did you chase it? I mean, could you not just drop a requisition tape and smack around the bot that tries to deliver? I know that dosn't take 40+ minutes...
---
So what? People will come back when things improve, you're being overly dramatic. 
---
The basic promise of the game was Fallout multiplayer and that's what we got. Things don't need to be persistent to have an effect on the world, it can be done through story elements and content updates, similar to the way Azeroth changes in WoW. That's just an idea.
---
BINGO!!!
---
But that's not the only answer. What if we had something like in RuneScape? A wilderness zone where anyone can go to PvP and get PvP-based rewards?
---
They may as well let me open a door with a shotgun then lol that's the real master key 
---
Sure, I can DM you the server link when I get off work!
---
ya thats my real fear, that i will move on long before the combat is balanced.
---
Jokes on you! I only have 4 camp fires inside my house (that's made of wood- safe, yeah?)
---
It's really hard to fire your weapon and get your health back in a 1v2+ battle if they are dealing significant damage to you. You have to have a team with you if you PVP it seems. 
---
I guess you could do a melee build to fight more than 1 person, but if they also have a melee build you are screwed. I really hope they provide buffs to ranged weapons soon because melee is particularly hard to defeat.
---
Co-op is the only reason I bought the game. My friend and I used to party chat playing solo on FO4 and it was great. So when 76 was announced we were excited. Then with all the bugs, nerfs, endless needs for crafting and the pure tediousness of it burned me out. I finished fo4 twice. With 76 I only got to level 30. 
---
There is weaker, and then there is useless. There is no niche. There is no place. Rifles are superior at everything, in every way, in every situation. And that's ridiculous. It's clear that some in this thread have never actually shot a handgun of the calibers in-game. A .44 magnum can penetrate an engine block and hit someone in the car. I encourage all of you to look up ballistics figures and see actual video of actual weapons being fired before you assume that they should all be useless and ultra-low damage.
---
Also, you're seriously discussing magic on top of fantasy in a game in which rifle bullets magically gain the ability to penetrate armor, completely altering the laws of physics, because the player character shot at stuff until he "leveled up" and took a "perk card" to gain armor penetration? Or gained the ability to increase the chance of removing functionality of a given limb because he took another "perk card"? Or gained the ability to sometimes just make two of things when he makes one, in violation of virtually every law of physics and matter, because he took a "perk card"? We crossed the boundary into "magic" territory a long time ago.
---
Yeah, it's almost funny how they didn't grasp the fact that they have some dangerous as hell mobs that can give a "sense of danger and anticipation" from them jumping on your camp or ambushing you.
---
God damn it. I forgot to ask for your platform. Nevermind, we can't trade.
---
I have a two shot missile launcher you can lend?
---
I really do enjoy being the tin can soldier protected my lower level buddies from assholes.
---
Oh you thought this sweet little level 6 was alone? Hahahahaha too bad dude.
---
There‚Äôs a caps limit?
---
Na, I'm just joshin'
---
I play this game daily unless i have hockey tickets or some other pressing matters.
---
That's how I've been playing it so far. Had 2-3 people shoot at me since launch, but nothing more than slap damage. I don't even use the team features, just join up with people doing events and make sure I'm on pacifist mode.
---
So you're sayings I should get blood worms
---
u can provide us some helpful tips lol..im level 55 my alt is 13..still learning things everyday..ive been farming whitesprings/harpers/watoga..having a lot of fun..i like playing grindy games..i dont see myself getting bored for a while
---
Agreed - I'm not looking for any power armor changes - just want others to know that they'll benefit greatly by pairing the Fireproof perk with their power armor usage.
---
I believe you need level 3 armourer to add deep pocketed mods to higher level armour. Adding this mod to my legendary chest needed the perk. Depends how important carry weight is to you because let's face it, there's nowhere to stash all this extra crap anyway
---
Myself, if I come across a camp, I like to look and see if there is anything that can be repaired, maybe try and leave some stimpaks in a nice obvious place.
---
Unless it is a turret camp outside the back of the Whitespring Golf Club, in that case hell hath no fury like a handful of orbital strike beacons and a willingness to incur a massive bounty. I'll destroy every single part of one of those camps, expect workbenches and stashboxes, they can keep those so others can use them.
---
I actually need to argue that this isn't true. The dev's are listening to the feedback and taking it all in, unfortunately the way game development works, we can't just immediately implement new features the second someone suggests it. They have added players requests to their development schedule, however. You can check the status on some of these things on our [Known Issues and Feedback list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) here. As we get answers on what is coming and what is changing from the Dev's based on the feedback we send them, we will continue to update this list.
---
stash is always right around 400 of 600lbs.. weight reduction armor pieces and like traveling pharmacy perks my carry weight is 125 of 290.. so yeah 100 cards wouldnt affect me any.. food alone i carry about 50 ribeye steaks and 60ish purified waters, along with roughly 30 each of radx/radaway stimpaks and their diluted versions and tons of other food..   
---
of my friends group i run with i am known for basically being the pack mule.. run outta ammo in middle of a nuke zone hit up silune, headin to a nuke zone and want cranberry relish hit up silune, run out of food, run out of water.. hit up silune.   
---
my camp budget is spent on the farm and 10 industrial water purifiers.. i dont like running out of stuff..
---
My point is 94% of people get married and hve kids so I mean the numbers of singles no kids cant be the main demographic.  Also average gamer age is 35 so that's kid and family range.  So average gamer has to be the guy who has a job and a family.  Arent companies supposed to cater to the average and not the minority that have insane unsustainable time to game?
---
It's not our place to say what people do or dont do but it's my place to voice my opinion about unhealthy life choices and if dev's should cater to those people.  Same with loot boxes much of the controversy is preying on peoples addiction.  Isnt this similar? 
---
Fallout 76 has major issues I agree but content is not one of them.  Unless you are able to put in a stupid amount of hours.  Also if you put in 200 hours and paid 60 dollars you got your money's worth.  I can't think of any other material hobby you can do for 200 hours for 60 dollars.  Hell seeing avengers with my wife for 2 hours is 60 dollars.  
---
They're adding this mode as content because it's one of the things we the gamers have been asking for (not me personally). Bethesda made a right step not a wrong one.
---
Lmfao the last sentence got me good
---
Missile launchers don't damage enough. In terms of gameplay. rifles should do nowhere near as much damage per shot as a missile launcher, counterbalanced significantly by the reload time and single shot nature as well as ammo usage of a missile launcher. This figure is expressed in DPS. Revolvers shoot slower and reload slower and damage considerably less than a rifle, making them disadvantageous in all situations.
---
Oh I forgot about the deathshead radscorpions. Those are some bad ass bitches.
---
Co-Op PVE could also be teamwork, assuming Bethesda had more content that made it interesting. Simply because someone's bored doesn't mean they need to target other players, or keep harassing them when they indicate they aren't interested in PvP. Again, something Bethesda should fix with more diverse server offerings. 
---
Actually I think I could be wrong about Phoenix. I thought I saw the plan on him but maybe I was mistaken.
---
I don't think that's it. It's because PVP is broken. Why bother when an overpowered Melee build can just one-hit you to death, even with PA on? Perk cards are way overpowered. They should just give slight bonuses. 
---
\+60% damage to glowing enemies at rank 3 
---
i compare this game to WoW in a sense, you will play it every second you can, grinding everything to get the BiS gear and weapons but after 2 - 3 weeks of having the best gear you get bored of doing the same daily quests, events and farming runs so you quit, put it on the back burner until the next expansion comes out and you play it for 3 - 4 weeks until you do everything in this expansion and the game once again becomes stale and boring and lets be honest here the amount of bugs and problems with this game is insanely high which is another turn off for some players myself included
---
for most players this game will last as long as they are putting out fun, good and quality content, but there are a small percent of players who are die hards and will play this game regardless if they put out content because they love the grind 
---
You seem like a REALLY fun person to know. I don't care what you think of the game, I was simply stating it's been done already and the mechanics are there. 
---
But sure, be a toxic and negative contributor. That must be much easier than just scrolling past üòê
---
I like to call it ‚Äúnacho loot‚Äù (not your loot)
---
Yeah, it's tasty with full auto, bloody mess and rifle armour pen perks. Once my 5* adrenaline kicks up to max I fly through zones 
---
I've come across him twice now, first time was just outside Abbey's bunker in the mire and the second was a random pop up in the cranberry bog just outside one of the areas with the bright red trees close to the big bend tunnel entrance.  Both encounters he dropped useless junk, chalk both times if I remember correct.
---
I have the TCL 55P605 and the X, and I've adjusted my settings to make 4k and HDR look great! The issue I'm having in Battlefield 5 is texture pop-in. I was playing that HUGE map with the stone bridge, and the texture pop-in of the ground clutter was very noticeable. So I've turned off HDR10 in the system settings, but left on 4k. I have yet to play a match with those settings, but the game itself did load somewhat quicker . . . Would turning off HDR make the game perform better? I will see if that is the case with BF5.
---
Its the waste land man....if you dont like your stuff getting trashed by raiders then protect it or run away. Everyone is so soft nowadays to the point they want someone to save them. Put your big boy panties and grab your gun
---
I like the hotspot idea. Currently I always scout Whitesprings because that's where Vault Dwellers love to put their camp. 
---
I try to stay away from lower levels(&lt;50) because it does suck to rebuild your camp if you are so new to the game. I normally hunt the higher level characters on a new server first because they are most likely to fight back with better builds.
---
I quite literally created an account to respond to this.  I read often but obviously have never posted.  This happens to me quite regularly.  I feel like the current model of PVP is ruining this game.  Fallout was never a PVP game and for anyone who has played Fallout for a long time; their style of play might not be conducive to a PVP environment.  Now they are adding an exclusive PVP mode while leaving current broken PVP mechanics in place.  I feel like if youre going to make an exclusive PVP mode then make the other mode PVE only.  Give us a passive flag like GTA online has where you cant damage me or my stuff and I cant damage you or your stuff with the caveat that if you capture a workstation the passive flag is dropped.  I also feel like the nerf on TSE weapons has increased grieving as well.  I agree they were OP. While you had many complaining about being one shot by a TSE weapon, the sheer fact of their power was also a deterrent (bobblehead stacking aside).  I think some may think twice if youre holding a TSE lever action etc...  Thanks for this post I hope Bethesda actually pays attention albeit doubtful they do anything.
---
This is the thing that drives me nuts about the fallout fanbase.
---
New Vegas was almost all reused assets from 3, that never seems to be an issue. 76 reuses assets and it's a big issue.
---
I agree with you on the second half too. I've put a lot of time into this game, and I throughly enjoy it...but I wanna build towards something. A huge community event, where we pool resources to build a persistent town. How awesome would it be to rebuild Flatwoods, Watoga, or Harpers ferry. Having player use their resources and weapons to build an defend a new town that WE built.
---
Maybe there something like that down the road, we can only wait to see.
---
I have one of those somewhere 
---
If you're getting screws from scrapping, you're probably the one with a bug.
---
There's a reason everyone is complaining about this.
---
I think thematically, PvP makes sense in the wasteland.  However more structured modes (remember factions?) and incentives would have helped.  And then, having any semblance of itemization balance.  PVP highlights horribly deficient areas of the game design, I don‚Äôt think pure PvE would have been much better.  All the problems killing the game would still exist.
---
If you tead the article you'd see the chimps were pro-socially ganging up on other chimps on their murder-sprees so they don't even contradict each other üôà
---
Just slap a fallout paint on the borderlands style drop in party system and you've got a winner
---
How many artillery pieces do you deploy?
---
Add co-op only mode if they are going to add a more hardcore pvp mode. I personally would enjoy a just co-op only version honestly. 
---
This I can't understand, if Bethesda really wanted to finance the future of this game paid servers are the answer, not the Atom store. I could easily see players willing to pay 5 bucks a piece per month to have the same server with the same group of players whenever they wanted to log in and still have the free to join random servers running. The issue, to play devils advocate on myself, is they want Full servers, not a server that may only be populated by a few or none most of the time.
---
Someone crafted 300 other Bethesda forums and it crashed the main forum server.
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
Awe man. Explains this hair I found too...
---
So I'm level 48 and I JUST saw my first Radscorpion, are they common in game or have I just been somehow avoiding them? I didn't even think they were in game until one came out of nowhere.
---
Tbf, I think there's a good chance that many of us would murder each other if we were forced to spend 25 years together.
---
Most vaults start with 1,000 people. Why did ours only have 32?
---
Or at least the *option* of elimination of PvP.
---
I play in Pacifist mode, but one day I chose to pick a lock, not realizing it was part of a workshop area.  When I realized I had a bounty on my head, I gave up actual playing, fast traveled to CAMP and went to bed.  When I came back from getting coffee in the real world, somebody had murdered me in my sleep, collected their 10 caps and removed my bounty.   Blood and gore everywhere.  A totally unnecessary experience. 
---
Watoga train station always has plans and ammo. It's like a trading place. Take a plan you need. Leave one you you don't.  Take a few bullets leave a missile or two. 
---
 LOL. I have had my fairly low level crafter in there many times. She needs Ultracite and that's where it is.
---
I had a Quad Tesla I used for weak mobs and for tagging mobs before they get murdered at Whitespring. Then I found a Furious Explosive Tesla and sold the quad not considering that the Explosive was going to replace the arc.  
---
But since explosive can no longer drop on Tesla, Fusion Cells just litter the landscape as ammo, and it is actually surprisingly effective, it has basically become my 'normal' weapon running around.
---
That is some next level delusion, bravo!
---
I apologize for not wanting my favorite intellectual property of all time to be further destroyed by people that are going to play Fallout 76 for a month. 
---
I have yet to use them. Do you?
---
Yeah i‚Äòd invest that time because I think bug hunting is part of the fun of fallout 76
---
Of course you can say I am lying on your hypothetical question on how much time i‚Äòd invest - but remember, I am lazy and I can do things for a long time if i enjoy it :)
---
Happens all the time at Whitesprings (Wendigo House) üòî
---
No, of course I know. I'm just so very sad with the current state of this game in my favorite franchise since I was 16 years old. 37 now, and each Fallout game that comes out is a precious commodity. To see its current state, as well as the roadmap for PVP being the next big thing added breaks my heart. What a letdown. There's so much possibility. So many stories you could tell. So many interesting and fun paths you could take with this game. To have it miss the mark, and continue to miss the mark for months on end is heart-breaking. 
---
I'm counting on the vaults opening as being the savior of the latest entry in my favorite game-world. Open them up and let out armies of raiders, start a war that invades all of West Virginia. Mutated flora/fauna change and warp the map around them to reflect these new introductions to the world. New spots to nuke, with new bosses to fight there. Other new groups attacking from the East, making the Eastern border a constant warzone. ANYTHING. 
---
But I'm losing faith that anything drastic is ever going to be done, and that this new PVP mode is the new focus the game is taking. All we ever hear is "I've gathered this info and sent to the team." Granted, that's your exact position, and you do a wonderful job at it. I just wish there was more news coming down the pipe that the game is headed in the direction we actually want it to.
---
wow
---
PVE servers? absolutely. Just get rid of PVP entirely.   
---
PVP is a joke on FO76 and very little about it was done right. 
---
The Bad
---
VATS Autoaim takes no skill to use.
---
Exploits everywhere! nearly all PVP happy people partake in it. 
---
A level 200 can battle a level 10. Because that's fair.
---
The Good
---
Wanted Bounty system (the concept! not the implementation. Full of holes and exploits)
---
I feel you on this! I still play POE (every other season it seems), D3 (every other season as well), and MWO. If FO-76 got a large content update like these did it would be a great late game QoL improvement.
---
Or, maybe a collective of individuals motivated by profit doesn't give a fuck about you, whatsoever, or even consider the fact that you exist? 
---
Not going to take a stand on this because I can honestly see why some would say it‚Äôs worse than launch or better than launch. But I‚Äôm definitely still getting T-pose ghouls. 
---
If you enjoy it, then you aren't the kind of person I'm talking about, are you? 
---
u/ladydevann can you comment on this? Is the team aware?
---
 This is a real problem. My Jenny Jones was happy with the potted plants but my present drinks beer and I need sets of a Glass and a Bottle to put on my tables instead of the fucking plants.
---
 I completely support your call for Gnomes as well. ;)
---
That's not how it works.
---
That would be super cool.
---
I've never had a TSE (some TS's and some E's, but not together).
---
u/furysevensix can you comment on this?
---
I hope the next fallout is singleplayer with optional co op cause I love playing with friends 
---
Hell no, to say the least..  I've never seen so many ppl against PVP what I so bad about it?? 
---
The video is no longer available

I would just assume he was the prize bot and shoot him on sight.

i have 1 str and wear no pocketed or deep pocketed mods. im a rifle build, i carry at least 2 at all time and fully modded rifles are pretty heavy as far as weapons go.  encumberance and stash weight is not an issue for me cuz im not a hoarder.  that being said. i use my 1 str perk for reduced ballistic ammo weight, and some of my legendary items reduce the weight of junk/aid/ammo stuff like that.  i believe the game intended for u to use all the mechanics available to u.  many players have an extra 100 carry weight or more than me without excavator armor on.  personally i want this game to be More survivalist, not less.

Okay. I stopped playing CoD years ago, because I got frustrated by paying 60 bucks for game and another 60 for a season pass or bunch of DLCs to actually get a full game. Either they should charge 100 bucks for a good game with a lot of maps, but not devide the community. So I would rely on others to also pay for the DLCs to play them.

It is so rare, it needs to drop the alien blaster and some rounds to go with it!
---
Ah shit hold on, I left my tin foil hat in the garage. Brb
---
You need to go exploring and replenish your stock of Aluminium to create a better hat.
---
Yah there is. I think it is 25,000 that ppl can hold onto max. 
---
I've deliberately hunted Wanted players, forgetting I had this on.
---
Plus side, watching them freak was hilarious.

25K caps

They‚Äôre slow to reload.  It‚Äôs more about creating organized chaos as everyone freaks out as soon as they hear that whistle

&gt;I bought the game specifically for the PvP

So, *you're* the one!

I've learned to only scout with 1-2 players so no one gets suspicious that their base is about to be attacked. I recommend keeping the pvp team that actually attacks clear of your next potential victim until the last minute. Many times players will see your team conforming near their base and they will freak out and leave. 
---
It's wise to have a meeting area farther away and then all fast travel together for the surprise attack. I've learned when you breach the house to always get their stash box first so they can't put away their loot. Some have more than one stash box so you may want to get the extras as well but it might be moot at that point. Next we get their generators and anything else of value. Normally by this time they have either quit or attacked back.
---
Most people I know who do this do it because they're bored, so they go around destroying camps in order to get wanted so they can do PVP, considering NO ONE uses the hunter channel for PVP, the next best thing is to just become wanted and let people come to you.
---
Yeah, but you shouldnt have to fast travel away....I would sprout some stuff about people needing to be more mature and conscious of others.  But yeah, good luck with that.  Should just blast em in the face and move on.  Had a issue a week back where someone was getting slaughtered trying to defend their workbench area.  Watched em get smoked by some super mutants then go right back into the fray.  I jumped in and took them out, making sure not to kill anything he didnt get a hit on, so he could loot.  Then he turned and started attacking me.  Stood there for a minute, taking damage.  Then gifted them a Nuka Cola quantum grenade and called it a day.  Added them to my blocked list shortly after that.
---
Placing a team of gnomes should autorepair and defend the camp with weapons from your stash when you‚Äôre not around. Being left to wonder who fixed broken items / left all the gore piles when you return.
---
Shit, coulda used this about 2 months ago :-D  Fantastic job!
---
Nuka quantum grenades are a thing in fo76 my bro
---
Aha!  I swore I had learned the plan for the witch hat AND the witch dress, but only the witch dress is craftable.  I can make witch dresses all day long, but there's no option to craft a witch hat.
---
I thought I must've been remembering incorrectly, but if what you're saying is true then maybe I did learn the plan after all and the game is just screwing up.

meeting a merchant camp in the mire near my friends camp.  setup vendor stall and everything.  that or fighting over poseidon plant with another player back and forth with strike beacons and lots of big explosions.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty good way to balance it out, actually that might be smarter than getting pack rat to be honest. Good tip! 
---
I like that. Sad thing is most people leave the server once they see either your group or the damage to their camp. Maybe groups should be smaller in general. 
---
Why would you play FO76 then? I've been playing since BOS and my dislike of any one game wouldn't cause me to go out and try and ruin others experience by trashing it.
---
Bashing a game and then hanging around in a forum for another game with the exact same resources is just plain stupid
---
Man. You're really 37? 
---
I cant believe that, during the week there are days that seem a little light but I have had times, especially during the weekend where people I play with can't get into the world because it is full, and we have to jump around to get in one. Most was 3 times.
---
I don't know about the scaling, but there is a check for loot/exp.  Problem is that low levels show up, take a few shits, then wait for everyone else to kill her.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Here's another tip if you don't mind spending a little of your own resources, I use Contractor perk to reduce material cost, and I set up aluminum extractors also for this reason. I like to use windmills instead of a fusion generator as it gives 12 power,10 for the extractor and 2 for the missile turret I sit on the extractor. Just a little something I do. I don't care about spending a little of my own resources on setting it all up. That's what they are for. Also 2 Windmills will power 3 small water purifiers. Sometimes I'll use a fusion generator and set up all the wiring and spend a lot of time doing that, get lots of water purifiers on the go, but it really sucks to lose it all so I go for minimum effort minimum resources. You can also just put one extractor and one large generator and not bother with much defenses or just use turrets. Whatever works for you.

That says the forums are down, not re directing to an advertisement
---
PVE in most games is trash.. I dont understand everyones problem with it, I dont play ANY PVE only  games other than goin outside IRL. This game would lose 90% of the small fun there is without PVP  
---
&gt; 32,000 pounds of collect power armor pieces 
---
Why? Honest question and not being trolly.
---
Also all under armor disappears from your stash while you're gone as payment.
---
this was not the case.
---
I was in watoga train station, i heard the vertibot propellers, i stepped outside and looked up, i saw three vertibots and a cargo bot headin east, i took off running to catch up.. i caught up to them at firebase major.. immediatly shot down the three vertibots (killed third before the first even hit the ground). this took me under roughly 5 minutes from seeing them initially to downing the vertibots.. 
---
then i tagged the cargo bot.. it turned red and immediately took off from firebase major west to the tower, i immediately fast traveled to tower (because cliffs) and when i landed at tower my bot was still red showing the 2 shots of damage i did to it.. it went higher in the air causing me to climb tower to get in range to hit it (couldnt hit it from ground too high in air). climbed tower got on roof spent 30ish min pot shotting it as story/description above went then it took back off to major where story ended roughly hour elapsed since first seeing it to when i gave up and came to reddit for this rant/chance to blow off steam.
---
like i mentioned in a couple other replies i have made to suggestions or comments on this, im level 199, 570 ish hours into the game, and currently holding around 25 or 30 nuke cards on me, its not my first run in with nuke card cargo bots and their escorts. i go after them every single time i see one.. middle of a quest or not.
---
MAKE LEGENDARY GEAR GREAT AGAIN
---
If my past history is any guide, I'll disappear into Civ 6 for 3 mos when the expansion launches next week, then play the new Far Cry and never come back to FO76.  Which is sad, because I had such high hopes for it....
---
Doesn't MMO stand for "MASSIVE multiplayer online", this is far from massive.
---
Don't feel too bad, I bought the 40mm auto grenade launcher plans for 1500 caps, went to build one, found out I don't have the explosives perk card and intelligence slot is maxed out so no boom gun for me :( FML

If a forum crashing is justification of angst towards anyone it is a sad world we live in

Imagine having your holotape game collection setting on the desk and walking in to find a random playing on your terminal.  Or creating 4 desks and terminals and having an old school LAN party with your team.  Leave some blank holotapes out to record messages for the CAMP owner.  "Hey bro.  Thanks for letting me use your stuff.  Left your door open. RAIDER LIFE FOREVER!". Stupid people leaving my door open... Ok the whole recording thing might go terribly wrong, but one can dream.
---
Hell, make a PipBoy programming language and let us make our own holotapes and games.  I'm half kidding but that would be awesome.  It might just keep those that are thinking of leaving more interested in staying.  Just hope no Super Mutant or SB comes to visit your CAMP in the middle of making your holotape/game.  That would suck. 
---
At least the dialog would be better then.
---
Im on Xbox, and whenever I leave the game I make sure I quit it at the Xbox launch screen. only had a handful of disconnects with no big problems
---
Have you been eating more mutt chops lately?
---
Can confirm running away from stash that doesn't have the search option will make it searchable(if the timer has reset)
---
 Yes that is how it works.
---
Leave the server next time. You may make the wrong group mad and they destroy everything.
---
I suppose I was lucky that it was unable to fly for some reason, that specific scorchbeast was grounded during the entire fight when I did the quest.
---
A subsequent patch must have broken it so it flies.
---
I recently punched a ghoul do hard a missle launcher flew out of his body. 
---
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic, or if you are unaware.
---
There are no enemies that have "no armor" after level 15
---
The least armored enemy in the game after level 50 are scorched, which have 100 armor, ghouls 115, super mutants 178, and a few other creatures over 200
---
Basically, if you assume the enemy has three times their level in armor, you are under estimating it 90% of the time.
---
This is what breaks weapon balance across the board, there is no need for every enemy to have this much armor, weapons with a damage per shot of less than 200 suffer insane damage penalties of over 50%, and the poor old minigun and it's almost 90% reduction in damage has it worst. If there was even one enemy in the game with no armor and a ungodly amount of health then a minigun would get it's time to shine, but no.
---
Oh the humanity!
---
I wrote the exact same thing weeks ago, and it got more down votes than up votes. I guess you guys finally came around.
---
ugh...that's disappointing.
---
That‚Äôs the point of this thread. If there was no PVP, this story issue wouldn‚Äôt exist. And then they could roll out their ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù mode and anyone who wants to do PvP can go do it there.
---
I‚Äôm not anti PvP, but I have trouble making sense of people who walked out of the vault with me on reclamation day being ready to murder me before we hit Flatwoods.
---
I'll build my new brick place, and you can come on over and have a quantum with me to ease our pains (and make our pee glow in a pleasing radioactive effect).
---
I know this. Please read what I wrote. Everyone spews worthless knowledge nobody reads the shit people write. I stated that since they were NERFED I haven‚Äôt found a single one in the world. And I wouldn‚Äôt be so upset with how quickly they drain if I could find one in the WORLD which I haven‚Äôt since they have been nerfed. Good day.
---
If you had the same 5+ people logging in every time with camps made at specific locations it works. We already do it.
---
If your on Pc i run with a group that does this kind of thing. 
---
Gotta have a mic tho. 
---
We give fairly complex quest lines that exploit the pvp system to create drama and hostile player enemies (depending on the player choices)
---
All voiced. We dial down our damage for low levels. 
---
A journal we could write in amd leave at camp would help us out alot if we are talking about what we want from bethesda. Or a piece of paper we can take to a terminal to type on so we have a custom letter to give to a player for one of our quests. 
---
So if a seemingly crazy person approaches you looking for a hero to save their kingdom... Go with them. You will have a blast. 
---
Exactly true. I thought the game was awesome for the first couple weeks but the more I played the more I encountered issues and realized how boring it really is.
---
They busy sulking
---
u/lonevaultwanderer can you comment on this, does the team know?
---
u/kindofsquishy does the team know about this?
---
This game is modeled very similar to 2 other open world PVP lol. Care to gues what they are? and not its nothin to do with battle royal why do ppl keep saying that?? This game is def designed for co-op but c'mon, this was said to be a rust clone before it came out...
---
We don't need wiki's, FO76 "just works".
---
This. People talk about registers and lunch pails but the meta is suitcases. I consistently find stuff there and have never seen it in any other container.
---
Yeah, cause turning it into WoW is a great idea. 
---
Look, you clearly don't grasp the concept of how persistence makes a difference in things since you seem to think it's *possible* for your character to have an effect on the world of FO76. Go ahead. Repair Poseidon. Two hours later, it'll be just as busted after it resets. Wipe out a den of super mutants. They'll be back in an hour so you can do it again. Clean a house out of junk. It'll respawn in a bit. Because *nothing* you do makes a difference in the world. Nothing. You're not rebuilding. You're not repopulating. You're not doing jack shit but existing. And that is it.
---
Want to just exist and not change anything? There's thousands of other games out there that do that. Hell, you could just turn off the game and just sit in your chair and do it in real life.
---
Legendary LAR &gt; Legendary HR
---
The kind of people that usually do this have all moved on to other games it would seem
---
This game is a hog wash off ideas
---
Hell yeah
---
if youre talking supply requisition holo tapes.. its not the same kind of cargobot.. if you see a cargobot escorted by three vertibots, that cargo bot is carrying a nuclear keycard (what you have to have to launch a nuke.  
---
supply req cargo bots are just random loot things.. totally different.
---
Its not uncommon to redirect pages while they work on the problem. Better than seeing a 404 error. 
---
And if you find all 100 ingots in the steel yard again, it unlocks a CAMP statue of Werhner flipping you the bird
---
Maybe they should put something that actually SAYS that the forums are down, instead of redirecting to a advertisement for ESO.  \*sigh\*  
---
No company with shareholders would intentionally release a product with the intent to fail just stop already.
---
Sorry man I thought you were saying it was an undocumented change in the last hotfix, as opposed to the documented change in patch 4.
---
Thank you
---
Theyll end up in the atom shop probably
---
Barely
---
Many, many times. would take a month to compile all the comments to this effect in this subreddit alone.
---
Skyrim i think possibly ESO as well.
---
Oh, I see. When I looked at it I was confused by all the "feeding into" that is going on. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
I love seeing people use my camp. I'm set up just off the road leading to Morgantown. Big red building with an unlocked water purifier, a small bunch of crops, every workbench possible, a bed, and a full compliment of instruments. The only thing missing is the neon sign. 
---
I‚Äôm having fun with[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/comments/ao34kh/fallout_strangers/?st=JRUXUAKR&amp;sh=319ccd3f) 
---
Yea those things. I believe I read it on a terminal in the building in watoga with the mayor quest.
---
nah just recycled assets I'd guess. No quests on the gamepedia site that mentions them
---
Yea thats what im getting at they spam that screem and it just wrecks you. 
---
Can confirm I‚Äôve seen a double black powder pistol
---
Bandwagon jumping
---
Harper's Ferry carries it.
---
Sorry I want full on pvp in fallout, why do ppl want such a padded wasteland is beyond me
---
I had similar happen to me as well. I'm level 50-something and a level 212 (hadn't know it went so high) just followed me around wailing on me constantly with melee, trying to goad me into hitting back. It went on for maybe ten solid minutes, eventually I hopped servers, but people shouldn't have to do that.
---
 No I did not know about the post 50 Armor Levels. Where did you get this information? I'm not min maxing so I have not been digging very much. ESO burned me out for that kind of play. ;)
---
On PS4, since the last patch(not the "hotfix") the following has eithers started happening again, or far more often: T posing enemies, dead enemies standing back up and showing annimations as if the are alive, heads of dead enemies stretching, flora not respawning after 24 hours, containers not respawning after 24 hours, projectiles sometimes clip through enemes dealing no damage, removal of 5k trade cap and enemies are spawning inside walls more often than they were.
---
Also, some living enemies are now appearing as stretched, usually along their center.
---
Buy them on the bazaar sub and finish it off, lol.  
---
So its just me... May I know what level are you?
---
&gt;This game would lose 90% of the small fun there is without PVP
---
It would also gain 90% more players.
---
Probably \^\^this\^\^ I just hope they release paint jobs that aren't too plastic looking and new, this is a post apocalypse wasteland after all. I want my armor to look beat up and used.
---
Yea but we are not all on pc. 
---
harpers ferry, watoga &amp; R&amp;G have it. I've been scoping it and saving myself, level 77
---
This game was dumped pretty much immediately after release. Nobody wants to touch it. It's being worked by what I can only assume is part of Bethesda Austin, which was already a small team to begin with.   
---
This game will not be receiving any additional content or significant updates 6 months from now. I am willing to be an entire paycheck on that. 
---
Waste of caps and effort. I'm quite happy leaving it till there's something to come back to
---
You are absolutely right.
---
Pretty sure once you are 50+ nothing is level locked anymore.
---
But, contrary to patch notes, not all plans are available all the time.  Server hopping is still required.
---
Its not really a home without a creepy little gnome.
---
It's actually not. Code that complex means some people will experience bugs that others don't. This isn't an opinion, it's an incredibly well documented thing. Even a cursory internet search will provide plenty of information on it. You need to learn to accept new information. 
---
Because then modders could do their magic and Bethesda would see 0 revenue from the atom shop.
---
120.  I'm pretty sure it was Harper's ferry.  It's either there or in Watoga, but only one vendor carries it.
---
They said they took out the level restrictions unless you were *under* the required level right? It could be bugging out or they missed that plan or something, but I think they said that at least. 
---
Nope. Just more CS:GO skins for the foreseeable future. 
---
Games need kind of a cult following for people to want to invest the considerable time and effort required to write and maintain wikis. Fallout 76 is a long way away from that level of commitment.
---
You keep saying ' cavalier' armor. There's no armor by that name anywhere in the game. I'm a level 177 with almost 800 hours played. I'd have found it by now or at least heard of it.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought it was gonna be when it came out it was gonna be multiplayer
---
The people I know who wanted a multiplayer Fallout wanted it for co-op, not pvp. I think that is how the majority of the fanbase wished for. If they had kept the main game as co-op then when they had released PvP servers more people would have been excited rather than pissed.
---
I‚Äôm just trying to make you feel wanted. 
---
I used to shoot everyone I could to initiate PVP but I dont any more as most ppl fast travel away. It's really shitty how ppl act towards it n kinda makes me wonder what they expected from this game, I jus dont get the anti PVP movement we have here lol
---
Griefers are such cowards. Just like their bully counter-parts in real life, they pick on the weak because they themselves are weak people.
---
Yes. 100%. Drop the always connected aspect that's causing so many issues and ping servers only when you're playing with people. 
---
How will that work with future content that is pvp? Like it looks like the majority of what one of the vaults is going to be is a king of the hill mode where you run around collecting votes. Will the PvE server just get zero new completable content for 6 months?  
---
(I mean, this is a bad game and no one plays battle that never was or hunter vs hunter or anything so it won't work on the pvp server either, but it just wouldn't even be playable on the PVE server) 
---
I would like a rusted paint job
---
Unfortunately, there has to be at least a moderately dedicated fanbase with genuine interest in the game to flesh out a wiki. 
---
That is how I have been feeling recently too. The best legendary drops I have been finding are the horde events. Even those are bugged now too, check all 4 spots and the horde boss is not at any of them lol. Still though, those 3 stars always drop 3 star legendaries for me. 
---
It's kinda funny to me, because they *could* probably make a spin-off Fallout BR game that would be relatively well-received as long as it was clear from the beginning of development that it was going to be battle royale (both for the players and the developers). Post-apocalyptic settings lend themselves to the weapon scavenging type of playstyle, and it would be easy enough to either write it off as non-canon or set it up as a faction-based story where players are raiders fighting over control over an area. It's not like the Fallout series is a stranger to releasing games outside of the RPG genre.
---
I started waving that flag in the BETA, and have seen this echoed more then I can count. The core of the Fallout community are not playing it to hunt others. The only PvP this should have had is the hunter/hunted aspect, something I rarely see used and when I do it is 1 player only waiting forever with no response to the station. I didn't get into 1 and 2 but have over 4000 hrs in 3,NV and 4 combined across Xbox and PC, am looking at 5 physical copies of the games for consoles I don't even have anymore on my shelf.
---
God damn I need that Confederate Kepi. 
---
There's no guarantee's they wont nerf everything in 2 weeks etc so it's probably just best to pick which you have more fun with in till we know were getting proper respec mechanic's
---
Wow.
---
That would make for a great addition!
---
Too bad mine get deleted after every update.
---
Just takes me to page trying to sell me ESO.   No Fallout content whatsoever.  I guess it fell through the ground
---
I get where you're coming from and empathise but you have pacificst mode that precisely prevents this scenario.
---
I mean it‚Äôs possible that people can one hit you even if you don‚Äôt have a bounty and are on pacifist, but I‚Äôm like 99% sure it‚Äôs an exploit or bug, only happened to me once. I‚Äôm lv 64 and have had like 8 really fun, unique pvp experiences. 
---
Yeah events havent given me any issues. Not great rolls but its usually always a 2 or 3 star. 
---
I'm guessing they started out as simple decor, but Bethesda picking it up and keeping using it in these strange places probably means at least they thought something about it.
---
Who knows, if anyone manages to get a hold of Chris Avellone or any of the other original people involved and ask about it maybe we could find something out :) Maybe something planned that never happened because Black Isle Studios was disbanded
---
Had that happen with a gatling plasma.  Killed a ghoul and it fell out its corpse but then vanished and was in the ghouls invantory 
---
In Bethesda's defense (And right now my angst level with them is at 9 out of a max of 10) no new online MMO type game gets released with that much content, it comes at a later date.  Do I agree with the practice....No.  But it is the SOP now a days.
---
I used to see it on the watoga and the BOS vendor, before the update...
---
I usually just grab workshops for easy fast travel, and set up extractors for cap run materials. 
---
Hemlock, beckley and the bog for gold/silver and acid, gives a decent passive return while I'm on. I am def checking out farming the junk nodes.
---
No, I saw it yesterday
---
^^^now this guy roleplays!
---
I really dislike this kind of post. xD You've come with conjectures, provide no proof, and then claim that you don't need to provide proof because it's just that obvious. Facepalm.
---
How could I take anything you write seriously after that kind of introduction? Yes, you do need to provide proof that 'large' numbers of people are quitting and that this will be a big detriment to the game that requires 'drastic changes'. A handful of "I quit" posts is what I've seen, largely in response to the patch whining last week, means little in context of this game's total population. 
---
Players will leave for various reasons over time, this happens regularly in gaming. It's not a catastrophe. And this game really doesn't need a big playerbase to succeed anyway because it's not an MMO and it doesn't need population to fill servers, nor does it need a ton of money to improve (as I will explain below).
---
Further, the question of how long the game will last is among the most useless topics I can think of. I don't mean that in a jerkish way, do it if you enjoy doing it, just don't believe these discussions are in any way going to increase your understanding of the future. Nor are they likely to get you the 'logical' discussion you want. Not a single person who plays this game would be able to speculate the answer to that with any reasonable degree of accuracy-- I doubt even Bethesda could speculate on that in a way that would be informative.
---
One thing you might want to think about though if you're concerned about the future of this game, is the success of FO4. Even as a single player game that hasn't received updates from Bethesda for a few years, and which was widely derided by the masses when it released, FO4 has more than enough community interest to still be enjoyable years after launch. So while FO76 would benefit from more content, I don't think it needs 'drastic changes' at all, or that there's some serious threat to its longevity. Before too long private servers will come out, which will bring mods, and the modding community will keep the game afloat. The only way Bethesda could truly squander this game and ruin it would be if they-- for some inexplicable reason-- decided not to go through with these mod-friendly servers (as they have already committed to releasing them).
---
And yes, that will bring back many players, as it always does when modding begins. In the short term (let's say the next 6-12 months), what Bethesda does will be important to shape the base game. But in the long term, the years ahead that you're talking about in the OP, it will mean very little as it usually does, and modders will be our pathfinders.  
---
I don‚Äôt think you replied to the right comment 
---
I have wondered the same thing since the B.E.T.A. It‚Äôs odd as the Military paintjob, Flames paintjob, and Hotrod Shark paint are all shown in the Advertisement photographs and the Trailer for the game. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time looking for them in game wondering to myself why they would show them off in the games marketing and then make them completely unavaible in the base game. 
---
If you look at Fallout 76 on the Xbox/PSN Store one of the included screenshots shows the Flame and Miltary paintjob. If that‚Äôs isnt false advertising I dont know what is. 
---
Even more odd is the Official Fallout 76 Strategy Guide shows the Winterized Plating (paintjob) for the T51b and mentions how it increased Power Armor energy resistance just like it did in Fallout 4. 
---
For those that played Fallout 4 you‚Äôll remember you could change the ‚ÄúPlating‚Äù on Power Armor from Titanium, Lead, Winterized, EMP Shielding, and Exsplosive resistant etc. in Fallout 4. Low and behold in the base Fallout 76 there are no options to change Power Armor playing even though they are in the game and even MENTIONED IN THE STRATEGY GUIDE. 
---
U dont find the monster it finds u.
---
Nobody blames you for concluding your FO76 experience. I've almost done the same a few times just because of the GD server instability, not to mention the griefers before the nerfs. 
---
I remain patient though, with my hope slowly dying every time TH comments on the game's state
---
This I don't get. I mean I get people can get griefed from time to time but how is it so prevalent that it happens multiple times for you?
---
Do you have a turret base setup in Whitesprings? A camp in the broken down shed next to Charleston station? If you do, you're attracting the attention. Doesn't justify it. Just saying that there is a reason for it other than bored kids.
---
The people boohooing about the reused assets are kind of funny, imo. I mean, do they *really* think that companies shell out hundreds and thousands of dollars *every* game just to remake a pistol graphic or a corpse? Maybe they think that Bethesda remade the iron sword asset for every single ES game too. 
---
Of *course* assets are reused. It's stupid *not* to reuse them. Of all the possible complaints about FO76, whining about assets being reused is literally the most idiotic.
---
I agree, but what I'm saying is they could have had a large headstart on new stuff if they would have actually completed the game before releasing it. Plus I dont think they realized how fast the players would devour the content in the base game before needing additional content.
---
I think in general the 10mm build is going to be more playable and a stronger build overall. While the idea of a Tesla rifle is awesome, and much more intimidating visually, my reasoning is the following...
---
\-- Tesla Ammo is less common than 10mm (and heavier I think) Yes you go through the 10mm faster per kill, I think it will be easier to stockpile and have on hand.
---
\-- The third star on the Tesla (250 dr reload) is extremely situational, and while it's cool, i typically count those types of stars as a non-star
---
\-- Vats builds are cool but still very subject to glitching and random misses. In pvp one missed 95% shot can be the difference between life and death. Also, once you run out of AP you're fucked. If you're jumping or sprinting to cover, this can be even more of an issue.
---
\-- The main thing FOR the Tesla is that if you can hit for 500 damage, you'll be one hit killing. But, if you need to be bloodied for either gun to be strong, and the SMG is hitting for 300 per shot, I don't think that outweighs the rest of the negative points.
---
There's obviously a lot more subtle points, and some ones I might not be considering, but that's my first reaction without looking anything up.
---
Update us on your decision after you're full build (if you change)!
---
I've had this happen pretty regularly, usually at least once a session. All the enemies in a the nearby area will just suddenly keel over with accompanying death noises. I'll check the map, no one else showing in the area. Not sure if it matters, but this happens more with scorched and ghouls than other enemy types. Been happening for, i dunno, like 2 mos? no mutations, on PC, level 116. Most recently happened in big bend tunnel, most enemies in the first 1/3 were just dead. no loot. 
---
Nice, wish there was a way to farm specific legendary weapons so I could try to get one üò¢
---
PROFIT!
---
i envision a gnome with sunglasses and a huge gatling gun taking out scorch beasts
---
Nothing is more annoying than trying to do a quest while having a group of level 200+ players follow you around hitting you with powerfists. Idk why company‚Äôs keep trying to blend pve and pvp in games, it‚Äôs pretty annoying when you want to just wander the open world and explore. They shoulda implemented pvp the same way it‚Äôs done in eso, a separate game mode and an invite to dual that can only be sent once. 
---
Well everybody seems dedicated enough to comment on ever post on this sub about how shitty Bethesda is and how this game sucks. Man, I'm so done with this sub. There are only a handful of users here that actually like this game. I assume the rest are just in it to hop on the hate bandwagon this game has been getting since launch. It's ridiculous. There is nothing constructive or helpful on more than half of the comments I see here. It's all just shitpost commenting stuff like this guy below me. That will be what half the comments here are. This sub is just filled with trolls and more toxic waste than I see in the Toxic Valley. 
---
I lost all of my photos from lvl 1 to 50 in the last update. 
---
I'll never get that fresh faced vault newbie back..
---
Because that would suck. Why dont the other ones require gas or oil?
---
This is a great question
---
Your playing the pronoun game isn't helping. By "it" are you referring to PvE? The current situation with PvP as it stands today?
---
If Fallout 5 would been set in this map, yes, but i'm one of those singel player only gamers :)
---
I ran across a few in Knife's Edge last night.
---
Several 100+ characters per account? What? 
---
I'm sorry but that kind of gamer can never be satisfied haha. Any person who has clocked that many hours on this in the few months since launch is a locust that will probably not be happy for long in any given place, unless it's filled with endless grind (like an ARPG).
---
I heard they've chosen to spend millions of dollars lobbying to change the definition of the word TRANSPARENCY to mean something else.
---
How do fusion generators in the "wild" still have their lights on and operating noises even though now only about 10% of them still have cores?  (I hate that update...)
---
I‚Äôve always screenshoted mine off Xbox as well to share and as a backup.
---
Eh. I mean you could be right but I'd take them at face value. Just because we don't experience it AS much, doesn't mean that it can't happen.
---
Ur right üëç
---
Vote his comment up, so community managers might see this 
---
What is worrying me to a small degree is after I picked up the Confederate Hat plan it wouldn't let me learn it, now it shows up as "known" in my stash. I'm afraid if this does get fixed I'll have to move this plan to a different character to use instead of my main which is balls deep in all sorts of crafting.
---
Can we still play as we are now or is it removing pacifist altogether? 
---
I have fun with the Tesla rifle but my build isn't build around it. I use it in silos and nuke zones tho.
---
Perfectly preserved pie. Next day Spoiled pie.
---
Only so all the crying would stop.
---
I got the atoms already. Just waiting on the bag replacement now, but no real rush tbh. 
---
so that is where all my tidy-whities went...
---
State Of Decay 2 had this same issue. For weeks after release, I couldn't find much on the wiki.
---
I think they should
---
[Clean your room](https://tenor.com/view/jbp-jordan-peterson-clean-your-room-gif-9239876)
---
Bethesda is shitty, and this game does suck.   
---
That being said, Bethesda is capable of more, and this game can be improved. It's not something that can happen in a couple months, but I (for absolutely NO fucking reason) still have faith that it will become a more enjoyable experience.   
---
Just out of curiosity, how much time have you put into this game? 
---
Yeah, I started doing that too. I miss them being in loaded screens though.
---
Don‚Äôt give Bethesda any more shit ideas!
---
If the next update includes this I‚Äôll hunt you down üòÇ
---
Wow, I expected more than that...
---
NP, understanding leveled list interaction is an art &amp; skill...   
---
Not kidding, FO4 mods alone often struggle with leveled lists.
---
Yes. Also, sometimes the leader is glitched into the landscape/walls or otherwise inaccessible (had that happen at Arcos pharma and the isolated observatory. 
---
Also, have had it happen where only 1 area is highlighted on the map, I explore it and it isn't the source. no other areas highlighted. Even traveling to those areas I know to be common sources (VTU for ghouls, for example) doesn't trigger anything if not highlighted. 
---
Lol, ok
---
thats what my parents told me after I moved away for college...
---
üòÇ
---
Spruce Nob has 3 gold and one acid btw. I just started adding that one.
---
Go read up on how taming creatures works.  Tameable creatures literally only appear at random event locations. There is nothing the player can do except keep cranking on that slot machine lever.  I shouldn't have to explain why that is bad.
---
Cool! I'll head back there to read the stuff! Thanks a lot!!!! =]]]]
---
Very underwhelming 
---
This ain't an MMO.
---
Couldn't care less about pve servers, myself.  But I'm all for you having them if you want them.
---
Probably not. The cutoff date for submitting a ticket was January 31st. 
---
I was born and raised in Pittsburgh! Would be nice to visit 
---
HAH.   
---
Oh GOD. 
---
There is already a lot we have to micromanage.  We would need to be able to stock pile the fuel and fusion cores. Those weigh a good bit. Most people would probably end up just not using them if that where the case. Maybe if we didn't have to worry about how much we could store but otherwise I dont think it would work well in the current game.
---
Create more bugs than they fix... yea... that's a straight-up lie lol. 
---
Come on man, at least do basic math. xD
---
LOL!
---
I believe that's likely due to the confederate hat plan missing its entire file.. I don't know if it'll remain broken once patched for people who have the plan in their inventory... I'm in the same boat. D:
---
Tbh my weapons all do well at killing the bs NPCs in 76, PVP didnt ruin anything really and is prob the only gameplay loop that may hold anything together in the future 
---
I know a lot of people that come the weekend play one game 18 hrs Saturday 18+ Sunday. Players i have met in online games such as Ghost Recon, GTA, Fortnite, RDR2. I'm Amazed you think games are jobs when I see them as Fun.
---
Last year the game industry made more money than all time releases for the 1st year. It's monumental the time people spend gaming. 
---
To put t another way. How many apps on your phone do you use regularly. How often do you look at and post on Reddit ? I would guess a lot more than myself.
---
;)
---
What is a level 50 player going to do against a level 212? Retaliate and die for sure and give the griefer what they want? I am not interested in encouraging these players.  I will just ignore them and leave the server if it comes down to that, and block them if required.  If they were not certain they had the upper hand then they wouldn't be doing this so why would a person want to engage them in what is almost guaranteed to be a losing proposition?
---
thanks, I hate it
---
Meh. There goes the remaining player base.
---
I find this post to be in violation of the Geneva convention....I approve.
---
What a joke. Wasn't the SQB already supposed to have fixed loot months ago? 
---
Glad to know this is not just me. Each time it seems like I am rolling the dice if it is going to work or not. 
---
Well there's what you said but also I wonder if they build their base somewhere with a high threat and spent nothing on defences and have their place demonished by a SB or high level super mutants or mirelurks and then blame griefers because that's what they read on Reddit.
---
Much like how not so bright and low information people blame immigrants for taking their jobs when really it's either their own fault or the system is rigged against them and the "others", perhaps like the griefers, are a convenient scape goat.
---
Not saying that they're lying but people that I know just haven't experienced it. Could just be our respective bubbles.
---
Nice, I don't think I've used that one before. 
---
How is MWO now? It's been a couple years since I've been on and FO76 is getting stale.
---
Hehe.  WE KILLED THEM ALL
---
Except Frank.  Frank actually knows how to grow food, so he lives.
---
FOR NOW!  
---
Want to hear about laser guns getting a buff.  
---
I just leave it in paper bags.  Is there a reason that isn't just as good, does it dissappear sooner?
---
The Tesla Rifle is one of the few weapons I have found no variation of it.
---
What a joke. Wasn't the SQB already supposed to have proper loot 4 patches ago?
---
Yes, I agree! I think it's now a Bethesda thing, like, they took the concept of the art-deco stuff and maybe are giving meaning to some of it. We'll see!
---
&gt;And don't get me started on the groups of jerks who like nothing more than to run around destroying people's camps
---
this is one of the reason i have the most minimalist camps ever..just the stash box/cooking station/armor weapon workbench and a bed..it is also in a secluded area in the mountains..repairing my camp would be so annoying
---
Sigh.. It was just an idea. Changing the state of the world with content updates is not a bad idea imo. There's thousand of persistent survival games out there you could play too, go play Atlas or something. I don't agree whatsoever with making 76 more like ark, ark is a great game, but it's a grief fest with constant chinese and US wars. Even then the things that are persistent in that game are mainly bases and dinos. How many world altering multiplayer games are out there, where everything is a significant event like you suggest? I don't think you are being realistic. I like that 76 was designed differently than all the persistent survival games out there. If you don't like the game design this much, maybe it's you who should turn it off?
---
I think they already made more than enough money from pre-purchase and first two days of sellings, given how fast they cut the prices. Trying to make this skeleton of a game into something playable would be economically ineffecient. They will keep a small team to slowly patch old bugs and add new ones, and another team to repaint power armor textures and recycle FO4 meshes for atom store, but that's it. 
---
I'm not complaining though. I spent 80-something hours here, it's acceptable amount of playtime for 60 bucks. 
---
You're a monster! 
---
:D
---
Very underwhelming list....
---
"We want your feedback on events!"..."Ok we added a timer to the map".  That's it?
---
Anyone else think the Scorchbeast screach attack changes are going to cause them to land less now?
---
And the SBQ NEEDS to be dropping 3 star loot... it's the end boss!
---
Forums are down as others stated previous to your comment
---
Three stars see meant to be rare. I'm not sure of the math but it is a much much lower spawn rate.  
---
Great, scorchbeast changes sure, that‚Äôs nice. 
---
What about the major bug fixes on the table for patch 6? That was kinda all I wanted to read about. That and maybe some increased gun damage/balancing
---
Long of short 
---
-I wanted to be a "Power Smith"...   
---
-At First we though scrapping for Mods was possible with PA, it was a few weeks in before a stable and functional XEdit was available. Was saving for scrapping once I maxed Int and Perks for PA.     
---
-The entire time I've been playing '76 it was with a Goal of being able to play the way that was Advertised, both as "Merchant" and as someone who made an impact on the players.   
---
To that effect I ran around collecting everything, literally everything, and when I could and found worthy low levels and Newbs of higher level I would do a full "upgrade" for them.   
---
Often that meant a full matching PA set, with as many upgrades as I could craft (and afford to for free) etc.   
---
Until "Black Tuesday" I had built up a network of like minded folks who daily dropped off equipment, scrap, Legendaries to be handed out... On a good day a couple thousand pounds came in and a couple thousand pounds went out... (and if you troll through my comment history You'll see I mentioned this allot)  
---
I agree thank you to those that are kind enough to leave the scraps for us noobs :)
---
Sorry to hear it.
---
Bethesda.  The community has already given feedback.  Reduce the Sonic blast and fix the loot!
---
As with enemies.  Fix the loot on legendary drops.  How tone deaf can one company be?
---
Off being nerfed.
---
Yup, not played since the end of Jan patch. I‚Äôd be interested to know how much has the weapon and armor degradation has really been affected, as if it‚Äôs too much I‚Äôd probably not come back. I‚Äôm not playing it as I only have few hours to play and don‚Äôt want them wasted finding out the game has become worse. I‚Äôm relying on the sub for info 
---
We need someone to start a vote thread to come to a consensus on where the best place to donate items is. We have suitcases, trash cans, cash registers, lunch pails, coolers, overseer caches. I mean it's probably ok to dump them wherever you want but if we can come together and choose a universally accepted stash spot, we can start doing a lot better at paying it forward.
---
Not big changes, but still very good ones. 
---
Nice, one less weeb. 
---
Certain items will not respawn for you if you already picked them up that day (a 24 hour cooldown, or so).  Things like Plans.  But there is always the chance that they spawned in the area on that server for another player who did not pick them up.  So server hopping can allow you to find more than one plan a day at some locations.
---
You can also choose not to pick up the plan, and get a chance for a different plan in it's place.
---
Then things like the Flatwood's Gym with its 50+ lead.  Once you pick it up, it won't spawn again for you til the next day.  But there are so many new players who might not get into that gym that you can sometimes find them unlooted.  (Note:  Very popular place, so it is emptied very often).
---
Doesn't really matter how long you wait when server hopping.
---
I still havent seen the metal kne at whiste sprint only workshop
---
Is Bethesda even trying anymore?
---
You do you man. If you dont enjoy the game don't play it. I can tell you tho I do hope heavy guns get some kind of change. They are next to useless right now. I can kill enemies much faster and with less bullets with my rifle sneak build then with a heavy gun build 
---
Just from personal experience, I'd say that keeping your camp as hidden as possible, &amp; crouching when there (to avoid griefers map-tracking you) is probably the best bet for low-level camps. They can't destroy what they can't find. (Turrets are more trouble than they're worth, imo)
---
They don't work, don't bother. 
---
Lol bye. 
---
Most games do not have to go back and fix basic mistakes that never should make it past the dev team. At this point the majority of any updates are going to be dedicated to simply trying to bring the game back to a stable state.
---
Personally I believe that Bethesda wants the least amount of info as possible floating around. With so much at stake with there next game, I doubt they want any documentation floating around about the unfinished state 76 was released in. 
---
This should be a thing across platforms.
---
I 100% would want that!
---
They already have soooo much feedback that they can't keep up with let along bug fixes that are not even mentioned. What are they doing.
---
I know it's specific random effects, but honestly don't mind that personally.  
---
More than a couple people I know did the grind, popped from location to location and eventually got the creature they wanted, and were ecstatic over it when it did happen.  
---
Removing the difficulty and randomness would reduce or remove the positive feelings linked to it. 
---
Did you even read it? 
---
I should have, but I completely forgot about that until now lol. I‚Äôm glad. In hindsight killing a level 2 would be a dick move. 
---
Presumably in addition to updating the SBQ loot table and reducing the frequency of the sonic screech they're preventing the SBQ from fucking off beyond the map halfway through the fights. If that's the case I'd start nuking prime again. 
---
Ehhhhh..... Yeah? 
---
What have they said? the page does not work for me 
---
That is important... Thanks :)
---
it happened to me as well, wouldn't recognize the game on a different drive and when I reinstalled I got 2 copies on that drive, at least with steam you can tell it where the game is, but I've never had to reinstall steam, just let it know when I had to upgrade a drive and move the games.
---
How do you deal with the user that connected to your server (taking your spot) in the seconds you were gone?
---
How long do you reserve the slot?
---
It's probably not as trivial as it might at first appear.
---
What happened
---
Childish
---
That would work but be boring as hell as it already is. Fallout and farcry have terrible AI as many other games do too which is my biggest draw to mmo open would stuff with full open pvp, and the story and quest of fo76 dont do well as solo as I did all of em solo. Other ppl in 76 is what makes the game but for some reason ppl wanna play alone with 0 PVP which is beyond boring
---
Don't know if you've seen these before but here are a few good resources.

---
I got the same version and I think the only PA paints are worth it, but not the $80 price tag. I feel like there should have been a little more with Tricentennial edition, but it's what ev now. I was able to play the BETA and that wasn't worth paying the extra money for the game as well, it should've had the price tag of 65 or 70 IMO
---
Perception perk, it's only useful for number crunching
---
Because most enemies have 175 armor you need weapons that deal preferably 350 damage per shot or more, armor piercing can bring this number down, but if you are running a build that can put your damage over 1000 you don't even need armor piercing. 
---
If you can't bring your weapon damage above your enemies' armor then the gun really suffers massive damage reduction, simply having damage equal to armor means you lose half of your damage, and it only gets worse. 
---
The minigun has the highest dps in the game, it isn't bad, just terrible against any enemy with more than 30 armor, which is everything. There is a point where it starts coming back around, if there was an enemy with significantly more than 30,000 armor then after that point the minigun would stop losing damage, and start gaining on other weapons, as 9% of the highest dps is higher than 9% of other weapons' dps.
---
But no, all enemies have about the same very bad for gameplay armor levels
---
Can someone cut and paste? Page isn't loading for me. 
---
Fuck. That was the most underwhelming update yet. 
---
This game is going to hemorrhage players if Bethesda doesn't do something to capture rhe player base's interest. 
---
The scorchbeast Queen change is worrying. Yet ANOTHER "we will be dealing with your conplaints about XX in a future update". 
---
What future? 
---
The very bleak one? 
---
OP expected some sort of massive post kissing his and others asses and didn't get it.
---
what a disappointment 
---
If ‚Äûgamers rise up‚Äú will ever become a legitimate non sarcastic thing I will kill myself
---
&gt;Reduce the Sonic blast and fix the loot!
---
That's literally the only thing that they mentioned they are doing in the next patch.
---
This is a smack in the face.
---
But also hilarious in a frustrating type of way.
---
Yeah I get you. Maybe if we could store them in the generator itself, like how water purifiers have there own storage for water
---
Feels bad man...
---
Eh, I don't know about this.
---
If everything was exactly the same but no PvP and things in place to encourage co-op, it wouldn't be THAT much better. PvP players would complain that it's an online game so it should have PvP. They want to roleplay as ~~arseholes~~ raiders would probably be the common narrative.
---
The game wouldn't have faired THAT much better. There wouldn't be the complaints about the poor implementation of PvP (from either pro or against camps) but there were plenty of other problems complained about more.
---
There's a change being made to the frequency of scorchbeast sonic attacks, and some changes to the loot table will be made to increases the variety of plans the queen drops, "some time later this month". 
---
They also asked what stuff we do and do not like fighting. 
---
Finally, they told us to go check out the atomic shop. 
---
That's literally it. 
---
 Leave it open with access to benches and all your stuff. I will put beds in my crafting shop for passers by to use and have hosted griefers while they fixed their crap and we shot the shit.
---
 We all know each other. We were in the Vault for years together and although you might not like everyone,we are that's left.
---
All I read is more stalling.  It's not hard to change a loot table.  In doesn't require months of "investigation."
---
bye, we dont care if you leave champ.
---
Trust me your better off not knowing. You‚Äôll just be terribly disappointed. 
---
I've got a few friends I met that way.
---
I randomly send people team invites so I can fast travel without the cap cost, and try to strike up conversation. If they seem cool, I'll kick around and help them.
---
How so? 
---
LMAO... I think you're the first person to say they should require cores and not recharge the cores for you.  The generator doesn't make power!  It uses a core to GENERATE Power.  That's why things go dark when you remove one out in the wild.
---
For realism, yeah that would be more accurate.  For gameplay though, it'd be kind of annoying.  We'd also have to start finding fuel for other generators as well.  And no one really wants to rely on a bunch of the massive windmill types to power their house.

# FALLOUT 76: INSIDE THE VAULT ‚Äì FEBRUARY 7, 2019
---
Forget staying inside the vault! This week we‚Äôre delving into the fissures of Appalachia to preview a pair of changes targeting Scorchbeasts. We are also requesting your feedback about enemies in Fallout 76 and giving you a little bonus whenever you earn the Well Rested buff.
---
### UPCOMING SCORCHBEAST CHANGES
---
üì∑
---
We‚Äôve been reading your feedback about Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen and there are a couple of changes coming in Patch 6 later this month that we‚Äôd like to preview for you this week:
---
* **Sonic Scream Attack Frequency:** One of the most common points of feedback we receive about Scorchbeasts is how they feel like they‚Äôre using their Sonic Scream attack too frequently. In Patch 6, we‚Äôre increasing the timer between successive Sonic Scream volleys to a minimum of 10 seconds for Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen. Scorchbeasts and their Sonic Scream attacks will still be challenging, but this change should allow players more time to react in between volleys. Let us know how this feels once you‚Äôve had a chance to play with this change following Patch 6 release. We‚Äôll continue to monitor Sonic Scream and can make further adjustments as needed.
---
* **Scorchbeast Queen Loot:** In Patch 6, we‚Äôre also planning to fix a bug affecting the Scorchbeast Queen‚Äôs loot list, which often results in receiving the same plan as loot even after multiple Queen kills. Once this fix is live, the Scorchbeast Queen will be able to drop a wider variety of plans from her loot list, which should also limit cases where players receive a duplicate plan. Additionally, we are also looking into ways we can make her loot list more ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù in the future. While we're still working on implementing that system, we will let you know as soon as we have more details to share.
---
We know that some of you have shared lots of thoughts with us on Scorchbeast fights in general, and we‚Äôre discussing your feedback internally to see where we can make potential balance adjustments in the future, while maintaining the challenge inherent in taking on Appalachia‚Äôs deadliest denizens. We‚Äôre also working to make additional performance improvements during encounters with the Scorchbeast Queen, and we should have more to share on that in a future update.
---
Thank you for continuing to share your thoughts with us‚Äîplease keep it coming!
---
### WE WANT YOUR CREATURE FEEDBACK!
---
Aside from Scorchbeasts, we‚Äôre also looking to gather any feedback you may have for the wide variety of enemies you can encounter while wandering the Wasteland in Fallout 76. Your feedback is important to us in making changes that can improve the overall player experience, and we‚Äôd love to know what you‚Äôd like to see us do more of in the future, as well as areas where we can improve when it comes to shaping the creatures, cryptids, and other enemies who inhabit Appalachia.
---
Head to the official Fallout 76 forums to share answers to the following questions **(NOTE: The forums are currently offline for maintenance, but we will let you know as soon as they're back in action and ready for your answers!)**:
---
* Which enemies are currently your favorites to fight? Why?
---
* Which enemies do you currently dislike encountering? Why?
---
* What makes an encounter with an enemy or creature fun or intriguing to you?
---
* What types of enemies would you like to see added to Fallout 76 in the future? Why?
---
* Other than legendary items, what types of loot help a fight feel rewarding to you?
---
* Would you like to see more challenging enemies added in the future, that may require multiple players or a team to defeat? Why?
---
Providing feedback here is huge for us. We are grateful for all the amazing feedback you shared with us about in-game events. In case you haven‚Äôt checked out our recently-released [**Known Issues post**](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language%5B%5D=en) yet, we‚Äôve already begun addressing some of your event-related feedback about placing event timers on the map. We‚Äôre planning to share more of our thoughts on your event feedback in a future post, as well as any event changes we‚Äôre looking to make as a result of your feedback. Finally, we‚Äôll be making regular updates to the Known Issues post, so be sure to revisit it often.
---
### ENJOY A LITTLE R&amp;R THIS WEEK
---
As a quick reminder, the latest in-game spotlight is all about rest and relaxation. Through Monday, February 11, any time you sleep long enough to earn the Well Rested buff, it will last 50% longer. So be sure to take a little break this week to kick up your heels and catch your breath before you jump back into tackling the challenges of the Wasteland.
---
While you‚Äôre at it, take a moment to head to the Atomic Shop, because we‚Äôve added a variety of new items you can pick up using the Atoms you‚Äôve earned by completing challenges, like Black Sunglasses, the VTU Track Suit, the Red Rocket Bed, and more.
---
Until next time, we‚Äôll see you in Appalachia!
---
Hmmm.. yeah, that is a bit underwhelming, not much details. :/
---
Is that what I expected? Are you sure it wasn't literally anything besides "We're changing some things about one enemy"? 
---
Just as with TES Legends, Zenimax wants to make online games, cash in and kill them off. The bnb onl reason that game is still around is that just enough vocal Hearthstone refugees fled Blizzards like of RNG rubbish to demand Legends survive...but its barely clinging, with minimal support.
---
Another week...Another pointless Inside the Vault. I appreciate the fact that they are trying to get info out every week, but the info we are getting is vague and pretty useless for the most part.
---
There was nothing to indicate you should have expected anything more.
---
Yes I did read it.  The Queen's loot table should have been fixed a few patches ago.
---
The core reason why players are frustrated with enemies are legendaries dropping nothing or 3 star dropping 1 star loot.  They said in the article that they were looking at making the queen loot more like legendary drops.  What does that mean?  That the queen might drop a drill in the future.
---
Anyways fuck this game I'm out completely now.  Was hoping they would address the damage bug, the nerf to whiteknight, buffing energy and gun durability.  You know, the things that the community has been shouting about for ages now.
---
Bethesda are a joke.  The game is dead, done. 
---
What did you expect? 
---
I was think it would be cool if we could build storage containers to put in our camp the that are made of wood and like 200 of a material that when scraped give you back the 200 material as an alternative way of sticking up on mats.  We could build like small wearhouses with crates of different mats and open up some stash space for weapons and armor
---
Pointless BS
---
I was just thinking about how the game is very self-referential. What I mean by that is: you play the game in order to be able to play the game. You spend all your time repairing armor/weapons and crafting ammo and managing your inventory, not having fun gameplay experiences. Bullet-sponge enemies compound the issue of weak durability of guns (even with Gunsmith 5 equipped). It's simply too tedious. They nerfed the only viable guns because someone cried about pvp. They should have made Two Shot Explosive guns do less damage versus players instead of ruining the guns for everyone. They nerfed White Knight because it was 'too good'... well no shit. Personally, I think they're making the game tedious to get more hours out of people. Hoarding junk just to be able to fight enemies is not a fun gameplay loop.Ôªø
---
Yeah Id have played it more than 5 times
---
Well Anthem absolutely sucked. Boring, generic and balanced exclusively for multiplayer only.
---
And brahmin are radstags that let themselves go and still live with their parents.
---
Basically, they are tweaking SBQ loot, and lowering death donut spams from scotchbeasts.  You know, quick fix stuff, but the only things mentioned for an ENTIRE patch.  Just disappointing, is all.  I don't expect nor care for platitudes from a game company. I'd rather see them actually do something with their game.  But maybe this will be their first patch without introducing/re-introducing bugs.  
---
&gt;Have to disagree, we do represent the community.
---
You represent a segment of the game players.
---
You just appear to be more because you whine the most over every little thing, true or not. 
---
You're fuckin kidding, right? That's it? 
---
I'm sure the devs are desperate to do more, but Bethesda won't let them save this game.
---
Watch them balls that up as well :/
---
Don't speak for me dipshit. 
---
extremelylost lvl 136, me and a group are usually on every night. It's been a couple weeks since I've launched a nuke, don't know why, but anyway we grind for mats, legendaries, and what ever else. There are a few lower lvl guys that we help out in the group as well. Hit me up if it's something you wanna do with us
---
I saw it in Sutton today.  It was around 10500 caps so I gave it a pass.
---
Makes me want to buy a copy for pc.
---
It baffles me that these whiteknights still exist. It's clear you people care more about worshipping corporate than having a good game. 
---
I only ever saw one radscorpion in 110 levels. :(
---
Powered doors work fine. You have to use another switch or keypad before you put the power to it. So take it from your power source to a switch, keypad, or terminal switch, and then to the powered door. The keypad included with the powered door is so the user can get out. Also another tip, if you use a keypad as the switch use the keypad to open it. This makes the door shut automatically after a few seconds instead of just staying open. I've got mine set up so when I hit the keypad the door opens, turns on a rad remover shower which is placed right behind the door, and then it shuts off after 3 seconds. Walk in and lose the rads all in 1 shot. 
---
awww, sorry little feller
---
U noob
---
Meh.
---
I have benefited from this and I do it as well!
---
OP expected development. From a development diary. Whoa so crazy!
---
Okay, that makes sense.  Thanks!
---
Absolutely pathetic Bethesda c'mon..
---
Indeed.   The community has already given feedback on these issues.  No need to go into discussion over it.  It's been discussed.  They are just buying time and extending issues that already have been talked about.
---
How many times do they need to 'fix' the Queen's loot table?  It's been trash since day 1.  As for the screams, people want a rework to the beasts landing more often and not flying so high.  By the way where is the mention of fixing the bug where the queen flys off the map? 
---
It's an mmo lite.
---
The wiki seems to be at the same stage as their game.
---
 Thank you. I don't use VATs so I have not sen those numbers. I guess I should at least gain info from it. ;)
---
 This does explain well why my Sword of Bastet is so fucking good. It ignores Armor by its self and 3 levels of Incisor make it very strong. 
---
 I do beasts in BOS heavy Combat with it all the time. Rads are a problem but I do have an X0-1 in my pocket.
---
Hi there! Checked in on this and yes they are aware. Hopefully, it will be addressed next patch- pending QA tests on it.
---
What a bunch of assholes, might as well have not even put this out
---
The nerf was necessary, but it wasn‚Äôt necessary to do it *right now*, while community sentiment was still in a delicate state. 
---
Thanks mate.
---
No idea why you got downvoted. That's literally the genre this is.
---
If you truly, genuinely believe that Fallout 76 currently exists in an acceptable state for a AAA title in 2019, then there's no point in debating anything, concerning any topic, at all, ever. 
---
MMO lite.
---
They're like, they are a bunch of whiny crybabies that we can never please so whatever. Those who continue to play will get what they are given. Still waiting for that PipBoy skin with the stickers in the Atom shop. They have a nice fancy Vault Tec one though, for the preppies with their preppy suits and nice clothes.
---
To these nuts on your face
---
I beg to differ. I have nearly 600 hours in 76 and just started a second character to try and address certain failings in the challenges. Please do not generalize a community by the few.    
---
I would wonder what exploits and cheats got so many toons over 100 so fast, I am only 132 on my main after so many hours, and the fact that those exploits/glitches are systematically being shut down is the more likely cause of those players leaving.
---
No, I just don't have time for fucksticks expecting to be catered to hand and foot every single week. You don't like the game, go play another one. It is not a difficult concept. Instead, everyone just seems to want to whore for karma in a massive circlejerk by posting variations of the same 5 threads every single day.
---
Be prepared for the raids. The old ones may be gone but the raiders will live on.
---
I really hope there is more coming on next patch that just those 2 tiny changes on SBs.
---
Because otherwise is just more of the same, 2 tiny tweaks and:
---
" While you‚Äôre at it, take a moment to head to the Atomic Shop, because we‚Äôve added a variety of new items you can pick up using the Atoms you‚Äôve earned by completing challenges, like Black Sunglasses, the VTU Track Suit, the Red Rocket Bed, and more "
---
Atomic Fever.
---
Usually I keep calm about the slow updates but this time I'm feeling like the game is truly stalling :(
---
I quit because of the bugs, lol. I'll come back when I don't think I'll get super frustrated at stupid bullshit. I play games to relax not increase my blood pressure
---
I think there's plenty of content, personally, but because of the bugs I haven't gotten to it all yet. 
---
Am I the only one who has noticed that Bethesda is doing a tick-tock method to their patches?  The odd numbered ones seem to be the really large patches with significant changes while the even numbered ones are more focused on bugs and some qol stuff.  I for one am glad that they are taking extra time between large patches but still releasing fixes between them.
---
Dec 4th patch: 
---
Bosses:¬†Fixed an issue affecting instanced Boss loot. Players should now correctly receive 2-4 items per boss, depending on the creature‚Äôs difficulty and level.
---
The game was released with a "can be done entirely solo" pitch. How would you extend team based content without cutting that line?
---
What's hilarious is all of these people will run to the next game, tear through it in two weeks like a no lifer...and complain that it lacks content.
---
News flash: when you live, eat and breath a game for a month, of course you will run out of stuff to do. No game will ever keep pace with that demand. None. Ever.
---
I had two encounters with these little shits last night. Came away with ‚ÄúWeeping Sores‚Äù both times. 
---
Don't anyone dare link to the new 'Vault.
---
With the right perks, it can go down to \~9k fyi :)
---
Yeah, they're pretty wonky. You can wire in a pressure plate to make the keypad door two way, but I don't use them too often
---
We are just tired of tantrums from adults every week.
---
 Scorchbeasts at Brotherhood events don't drop anything then disappear... done it 3 times now over the last month and also at Watoga and nothing... takes a lot of stuff from you though...
---
It's adding a new mode with no pvp restrictions.  Regular game will stay as is.  They said you will be able to choose which mode to play in the main menu.
---
We're working on addressing this in an update. I hear your frustrations on the loot tables loud and clear. We'll post an update to our [Known issues and Feedback list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) when we get an update on this from Devs.
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ao6ruq/fallout_76_inside_the_vault_february_7_2019/
---
of around 50 players I added to my friends list in November I see 2 that still play occasionally and only for a couple hours a day if that. I really hope Bethesda is tracking the metrics on this and seeing how bad it's getting. At least their server costs will diminish as fewer are going to be needed for the couple thousand who just play to play.
---
One of my absolute favourite mods for Fallout 4 was the OCDecorator mod. I loved building a toolbox and then actually putting tools next to it to make it look like it was in use, or filling the shelves with stuffed animals or memorabilia from past adventures. In 3 and NV I'd collect rare or unique junk like all the eggs or helmets and drop them on shelves at my player home, and in Skyrim I loved having the mannequins and display cases in Hearthfire. The building system is leagues better than 4's, but most people's CAMPs are still more or less similar, even with all the Atom Shop items and different builds there are, and I feel like letting us use our junk as decorations like that would be an awesome addition, especially since there really aren't any items to put on shelves aside from lamps and the succulents now that they've removed the radios from the build menu for some reason. I've wanted to put a Wakemaster next to my bed since the BETA! Or some of those Mr. Fuzzys!
---
Ehhh, I'm not sure I agree with that. Or rather, my counter-point would be "and when wouldn't community sentiment be in a delicate state?" :)
---
I remember seeing somewhere that fallout76 was made by a new studio. Anyone have that link, I can't find it.
---
I'm fine with them being released as atomic shop items. One problem tho they gotta RELEASE them so I can buy it 3 months down in still lookinging at princess beds and Sims 4 crap
---
I agree to some extent but this game is different. Anthem will fill a hole for some so you'll likely lose some there IF the game holds up. However, for the other two, there is a clear end to the game's life. Who knows how the modding scene (if it can exist) would give those games longer life.
---
Whereas for Fallout 76, for people who love the universe, there's always the promise of more content. It's a little concerning that there isn't a clear roadmap other than vaults (which was datamined; I don't recall an official response regarding vault raids), PvP mode and some vague mention of faction stuff that hasn't been brought up since. That's it. That might only get us to mid-to-end of year. After that, we have no idea what is going on. Could be a ton more content. Could be the game retires.
---
A little over 100 hours. 
---
Also, Bethesda isn't shitty and the game doesn't suck. That's just your opinion. And if that's the case, why are you involved with the game and it's community at all? That's what I don't understand. You have that opinion, yet you feel the need to gather here with other people and just continually shit on the game and the devs. Why? Clearly you don't give a shit about the game being better. If you hate Bethesda so much, then why support their game? Why not just leave it alone? You don't like it. That's fine, but wouldn't your time be better spent doing something you enjoy?
---
That's it?
---
Or you could get it as a random drop, like I did...
---
We're looking at changes to the scorch beasts. The first of which is [slowing the timer on their Sonic screams](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4p6SjK3uyZAtWwJRI7BLeT/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-7-2019). After this fix goes live, please keep letting us know how you feel about it so we can continue to address and change them for the better.
---
Like I said you're right, Bethesda had done a lot wrong. However, Bethesda and I try to get my friends to buy the game and there's plenty of entities out there providing misleading information about the state of the game which influences their purchases. Sure, I can try harder and I am which is why I'm on this sub, but it looks like most sub members don't want others playing this game.
---
To say that Bethesda is the sole person responsible for the failure is true, but saying they're the sole influencer of sales is false. 
---
When you go to claim the reward, press the space bar several times, this is a known bug and how I got past it.  Then you can go to the Production Room and pick it up from the terminal.
---
If you let them regenerate once they are more likely to drop legendary items... just something I‚Äôve noticed. Maybe the amount of regenerations equals the drop level?
---
 Frank?
---
I think some game designer thought it would be a workable solution to the following problem:
---
We have spent too much resources on developing multiplayer for the fo4 engine and we have realized very few fo players really want or need multiplayer - so we what kind of hurdles can we put in the game design to that we force players to cooperate like in wow?
---
Dude, did you fucking read anything after the sentence that sent you into a fit of sobbing and furious typing? 
---
That what the nerfs and buffs were for tho, but I'd rather have open pvp on the new servers k in NDA like ark
---
They haven't even commented on the Event feedback except in the broadest sense.  I suspect they are simply exploiting the community's desire to improve the game and make us feel empowered, because it's none of this feedback is finding it's way into the game at all.  Where our feedback coincides with things they already planned, they make a big deal of it, but I don't think they are truly listening.
---
This is to stop you from getting the same plan from here
---
Good points- the mention of no clear roadmap hits the nail on the head. Kind of looking for that
---
Please define tantrum. 
---
You clearly do have time for the fucksticks. Not only wasting your time reading their posts but also posting comments to engage. 
---
Thank you o/
---
Probably not. HDR is kind of a color spectrum thing and a little bit of setting the contrast. 
---
yup, had this happen to me repeatedly and tried reporting the two people who did this. Griefed me by following me around the map and killing me multiple times since I had multiple workshops at the time for fast travel purposes to save some caps. 
---
"Later this month". Really? After all the stuff messed up in last patch? https://imgur.com/a/Dl3ixos
---
Just 3 star ain't enough. Add craftable legendary mods to her droptable, one time use, and whitesprings will be long forgotten. 
---
oh my god thank you really appreciate it the spamming space bar did it 
---
Jeez. Did you have a sense of humour bypass? - as it happens I read plenty of Bethesda posts, because I play plenty of Bethesda games and have for years. 
---
People aren't exactly flooding the '76 servers. There are fewer players. Pretty soon it will feel like a 1v1 game because all the servers are empty.
---
There's no place like gnome.
---
&gt;People expected more,
---
That's part of the issue. Stop making promises to yourselves and then getting angry when they get broken.
---
I'm giving Beth one more damn chance and if the next patch isn't more comprehensive I'm out permanently üëã
---
If these posts make you this irrationally angry, why don't you just not read them? It is not a difficult concept. 
---
Will they land more? Will they just do their poison attack more often? Will they stop being absolute bloodhounds?
---
Scorchbeasts suck to fight for a multitude of reasons, not just because the screaming is annoying
---
Would have thought PR would have coordinated with their community managers...
---
I never thought I would hear that people preferred server hopping and thought it was difficult.  Wierd.  The removing the randomness would only reduce the negative feelings about it and make it a positive experience. Allowing people to actually work towards goals actually makes it more difficult.
---
How many hours did they do that?  Why are you so opposed to one person spending X amount of hours earning a reward through randomness, while another spends the same or more hours actually completing quests and putting in the work to earn the same reward?
---
Absolute joke.
---
There should be a 10 minute delay before you can actually leave a server if you've initiated PvP.
---
Note I said initiated.
---
Ah yes! The entitled consumer who paid 60$ for a product that ended up being falsely advertised.
---
How dare they BULLY the poor old megacorporation. 
---
Lmao... a random drop from doing what? Workshop events? Ive been trying my luck with those for hours now :(
---
thanks for the attention!
---
Came looking for this comment, was not disappointed.
---
Honestly its good to see them finally acknowledge and work towards making scorch-beasts better. 
---
**HOW ABOUT A ROADMAP?**
---
Oh wait, you guys don't have any idea where you're taking this game. 
---
That made me so sad when I found out that I almost spent atoms on [the closest thing available](https://youtu.be/FQfCQMWT3AY). Not at all worth it. 
---
 I dunno, I get pretty good results shooting into its scream animation. ;)
---
One of the reasons this game has failed in sales is that it foolishly fucked both the fallout fans and the PVPers, and only gave griefers what they want. If there was a PVP / PVE only option nobody would have griefers complaints because PVP players just see them as a righteous target for justice filled murder rather then a nuisance. 
---
But no, let's stick everyone together, except PVPers all went "ew that sounds like shit" and never bought the game to begin with (myself included, I've got a copy I got for cheap sitting on my desk waiting for a reason want to play) 
---
I had a fun one where I reported this same behavior officially with Bethesda and am not sure if action was taking. The folks who did this, when I used my microphone to ask them to leave me alone, told me that this is part of the game and called me a snowflake. There are definitely griefers out there who are taking advantage of this mechanic for ill and looking to make other players suffer by fast traveling to them and killing them. 
---
Ok, this week then changed the SB sonic scream to once every 10 seconds.  Whew, that's a relief.  Now the game's perfect!
---
My only griefing experience was one day before new year, on my first day of playing. I was lvl 5 and these two guys, lvl 5 and 9 iirc, killed my while trying to build my first 2x2 camp. I managed to kill them both in retaliation with my superior shooting skills, for r/iamverybadass
---
Could that be because there are so few PvP players in this game that you don't hear from them that much?  Anyone who really enjoys PvP games is probably playing actual PvP games, there are many great ones out there, some are even free.  Why would you buy your PvP experience with this game.  Pvpers do yourself a favour and play some of the other great PvP games on the market.
---
I've been having an issue with the LITerally trophy not unlocking on PS4, I've read at least 45 magazines and it still hasn't unlocked. What could be causing this?
---
Um, yes... Im not sobbing or furiously typing. I addressed your first and last sentence. Clearly I read the middle. I'm genuinely curious as to what would make you want to spend time interacting with people on the internet to bandwagon hate for a piece of media you don't like. It's a game dude. It's not the fucking cure for cancer. It has issues. That doesn't make it a shitty game. Although that's just my opinion.
---
Oh.  Nothing about perks, weapon balancing or player HUB.
---
But thanks for the Atomic shop advertisement.   
---
Livin' ain't easy in the wasteland kids.
---
im on ps4, lvl 199, 570ish hours into it, and i think i have run into 3 pvp incidents (not counting myself chasin wanted players for achievement).  
---
first one was a pvp emote, i returned emote no, he left.  
---
2nd one accidental maybe? someone in a nuke zone not on pacifist.. 
---
3rd was a couple nights ago, a party of lvl 100's evidently thought they could kill us all and keep the zone for themselves stole loot bags and what not.. they got the first kill since our group was caught unsuspecting.. and i was in the resort dropping loot in my stash dealing with a disconnect, but made it to the club in the middle of the shenanigans and we regrouped and killed them all repeatedly and recovered our lost members loot plus the griefers loot, and ran them off completely.. not saying we were better or more powerful players but 100+ levels of us running together our team movements and battle strats are well synced. i landed in middle of the fight got their attention as my friends blindsided each one of em repeatedly while they were worried about me.. kinda same way we farmed ghouls, and westek mutants.
---
ha! thanks for posting this, maybe if they gave the little vault boy an actual pointy gnome hat it would be better
---
If you don't like this post, go read another one! It's not that difficult of a concept. Instead, everyone just seems to want to whore for megacorps in a massive cult-like circlejerk by posting the same fanboy bullshit everyday.
---
Did that once and ended up on a floor full of traps :) Ouch!!
---
I wish they would have taken a Borderlands 2-esque approach to it. So it's single-player, but you can invite 4 or 5 buds into your world and play an in-depth story line along with them, and then enjoy some endgame contents such as raids, etc.
---
And for everyone arguing that there are no toxic players on FO76. Well here is one.
---
Inside the vault is Today?
---
This is even more dissapointing the the last patch it self.
---
I must be stuped waiting for this Inside the Vault...
---
I support this idea. Should catch on
---
Dev*. 
---
It's hard to believe more than a single Dev is working on this at any given time. At least that's the end quality they're releasing 
---
The current state of "PvE/PvP" mix doesn't really work, we need separate PvE only and PvP only servers.
---
Here's pretty much all of it:
---
Not all us were upset about TSE. Hell, I font even know what TSE means.
---
I'm upset about poor stewardship of a service I purchased a license to use continuously over time. As a customer I deserve better than the half ass lack of effort output that has apparently replaced work ethic at Bethesda.
---
I believe it was a workshop, yes - but perhaps one of the harder ones... I‚Äôm thinking grafton steel. What‚Äôs cool about that one is that you get a vertigo that and signal grenades... haven‚Äôt tried out the max distance but it‚Äôs probably close enough to several events in the area.
---
I wonder if I could kill the grafton monster with a vertibot on grafton day?
---
The fire station is a good place to grab lead too. They have the weight room with a good amount of lead there
---
What makes you so sure?
---
"If you share the same opinion as other people, you're just riding the hate bandwagon uwu :'(" 
---
I'm genuinely curious as to what would make you want to spend time interacting with people on the internet to create ridiculous strawmen and bandwagon for a piece of media you (think) you like (for now).
---
I guess I was trying to make it easy on them... they can't seem to get what they have working without breaking a ton of other things... so adding a new concept in might blow the whole game up for them.
---
Absolute fucking joke.  
---
sweet, I'm not alone :)
---
Can the last person to leave Vault 76 please remember to turn off the lights! 
---
Used to be Mondays, but they kept falling behind and now its Thursdays 
---
 Wait a while. If you just quit to menu and hit play it will put you back if it can. Look at Crown, lol Atom Store, for a minute or two.
---
Now we know why they took the forums down.
---
Yup and it's a real doozy! So many announcements.
---
Like Scorchbeast spam will be limited.
---
Bulking is for selling, weight management is just a side effect.
---
A lot of us dont care about the nerf. We care about the terrible stewardship of the game.
---
Is Bethesda sulking cos they getting a flamed? 
---
I like how they troll the Atom store at the end of the post. 
---
Have fun on Twitter / facebook Bethesda :D
---
As they asked about other creatures. 
---
I find radscorpions to be very unrewarding to fight. They can teleport behind players with almost no time to account for the tunnelling. They also normally drop nothing other than meat. Mabey give them a junk item they drop like screws/balistic fibre/springs.
---
Mole rats should only be able to tunnel through dirt. Hsving one pop up through solid rock or on a rooftop hapens way to often and can be imersion breaking.
---
As forgeneral loot drops I like the very random drops that ferals can give its nice to not know exactly what your gonna get. Mabey add in a small chance for rare weapons from various creatures like a bone club from scorched, or a claw melee weapon from scorpions. You could also do rare armor drops like that propane helmet mutants wear or a carapace armor from mirelurks.  
---
YOu doN't kNow tHE definITiOn of StORy.
---
 You don't know how to address the subject at hand (and probably think a story is best told instead of experienced).
---
You know what's more unbearable than someone going into a community to shit on them? 
---
People who complain about why people dislike it when people do that.
---
Why does pvp servers = hardcore?
---
Why cant pvp just levels of preparedness. How well prepared are you?
---
As in, DONT bring a knife to a gunfight
---
Don‚Äôt wear Cloth and leather armor, if folks bring ballistic or PA.
---
Didn‚Äôt bring enough ammo? Whose fault is that?
---
More importantly, How will you know your limitations, if you don‚Äôt test them?
---
Sorry hombre, that's just the way it is. You're one of the four classes of people in this world that I truly and genuinely despise. 
---
I have a TSE Tesla Rifle, I use it all the time. Very fun to use.
---
Thanks. Do you know if it takes very long? I don‚Äôt need to do it now as relogging 5-6 times deleted most of the vertibot wreck and I could get into my base properly but it‚Äôd be nice to know for the future.
---
I will even provide a graphic definition.
---
This post.
---
Glad to see we agree.
---
Whats wrong with them changing something small. They just rolled out a huge update less than a month ago. Do you expect every update to be massive? 
---
I hope the world design in their new sci fi game is good
---
I actually didn't clarify it but in context I was talking about the players who are leaving. If you've played a lot and are still here playing and having fun then you're not a locust. :P  I've played about 210+ hours myself, which is still quite a few, and I have no plans to leave in the immediate future because I can still squeeze another month or two of fun out of the game I think.
---
I would agree though that some of the players leaving are doing so because they can't exploit/dupe/etc. Won't be sad to see them gone. xD
---
Bye!
---
You missed:
---
* **SPEND MONEY IN THE ATOMIC SHOP**
---
* **WE NERFED YOUR XP SO WE COULD GIVE YOU 50% XP BOOST, YOURE WELCOME**
---
* **ALSO, NO PROMISES WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE AN OLDER BUILD EVER AGAIN**
---
The problem is some people are douchebags and will ake them all and probably try to sell them. Randomly dropping them at the vendors, suitcases, overseers camp, and cash registers makes it not worth someone's time to go to all those places and try to collect it.
---
Personally I would love to start a plans swap meet and I would even be up to host it but I'm simply not on enough.   Like everyone just keeps dropping all their plans in a suitcase and then other people pick them all up, learn what they can, and drop all those they couldn't back in.  
---
You can try building in existing locations that way they may miss that it's even a base if they are passing by.
---
Pathetic
---
Everything is bullet sponges. I love two shot explosive and then they nerfed it to nothing that was the last straw. played with my friends for a while they're amazing that's the only reason I stayed on.  I like the game the scenery everything else. I think players would return if they buffed the two shot explosive back to what it was and did some server maintenance.
---
I whole heartedly agree with everything you said, i also enjoyed showing off armor sets and hanging weapons on the wall/rack for display in FO4
---
Being able to display some of the stuff we collected helps remind us of our past adventures, well put!
---
No, I actually feel the opposite. I'm really excited to see what they're doing with the new PVP mode, and had hoped or something like that since the beginning. 
---
Yeah I kinda omitted that on purpose.
---
I made a conscious effort to make this post fairly lighthearted and enjoyable, even for individuals such as yourself, who suffer from a cognitive and/or developmental disability that prevents them from being able to rationally process opinions and ideas other than their own. 
---
Go back to your filthy casual safe space. 
---
You must be new
---
It honestly couldn't have been worse.  There's nothing anyone can say or show me that would convince me &gt;5% of this game's population has EVER PVP'd, consensual or otherwise.  There is nothing to do but grief for the sake of griefing.
---
Workshops have always been buggy, boring, and only rewarding to people who didn't figure out where to farm whatever it is they think they need but were really just hoarding for no actual reason.
---
Honestly, this game's one enjoyed by a majority of players that don't want a challenge and that don't want any constrictions on carry weight.  They don't want realism, and they don't want anything to do with other players except role play (and less than 1% of 1% of players role play, ever).
---
There was really no reason to make this game, and its failures are just an illustration of the magnitude of failure and misunderstanding that the vanguards of this series possess regarding their customers.  Nobody wanted this game.  Few have asked for it.  Fewer played it for more than a week.
---
oh man ill have to be careful of that!
---
I really hope they're breaking up the Inside the Vault info into multiple articles to make it seem like it's more frequent. Guess we'll get the rest of the patch changes next Thursday, or at least another quarter of it
---
As a The Division player frequenting the Dark Zone I want PvP but the current PvP in FO76 is broken and as I am not a griefer I don't do PvP in FO76 at the moment.
---
Hopefully in March they make a full 180 and give us PvE only servers and PvP servers. I can then PvP on the days I feel like it and PvE in peace on the other days. That is how I play TD and it works great.
---
This is the kind of thread people have been asking for since release. Thanks for at least letting us know what you are aware of and what your looking into. 
---
I believe you also have a vertibot in the Converted Ammunitions Plant and Poseidon Plant Yard.
---
As for the Grafton Monster, I dont think so. Vertibots dont really do much damage, except for when they explode near you... Might depend on the level of the GM too.
---
He did 1 week ago...
---
These are all things that are being brought up to Dev on their fights, and future changes to them. Keep letting us know what you want changed and what you like, the more information I have the more I can show them.
---
...This is a joke right?  All these issues with the game, all the promised future content updates and all we get is "we're tweaking Scorchbeasts and we want to know your feedback on every other enemy."  
---
How about addressing the plethora of issues players keep experiencing?  How about giving us information on what we can expect for the future since many of us have already stopped playing the game and are just following along waiting for news of something major to get us back into the game?  
---
This is really, really pathetic bethesda.  Guess I'll just keep playing Apex Legends
---
Maybe these are the highlight points on the patch but they are going to add more. Do you expect a full patch note before the patch is live?
---
I like what you said. I feel that players like myself who can say they have put hundreds of hours into the other Fallout games will be the ones left. I don't mind this, we aren't the PvP type and don't see a point to it. I play other games but really enjoyed the multitude of ways you could develop a character if the other FO games, in 76 it's the camp and hope to find like minded players that keeps me in game. For me the game is engaging and my personal quest is to buy all the atom shop items without spending more then the 10 bucks I stupidly spent an a "limited time offer" that ended up in the store anyway. If your on PC dm me, I play most of the day until I find work and would love to team up with someone for a change. I have a discord channel(who doesn't right) and would love to create a neighbourhood around the twin lakes of like minded players.
---
Same here. Got almost as much today. Multiple crafting benches (in the tunnel and outside the exit on the east side, which also has lots of steel stuff to scrap) make it easy to scrap all the guns from the scorched. 
---
I just read the known issues and feedback thread and it has more information about what will be in  the next patch (patch 6).  I counted 7 more issues that they have said will be addressed in patch 6.  Nothing huge but a fair number of things that we have made them aware of.
---
This. 
---
I must have missed it which update was the "massive" one? 
---
I've had more positive interactions than negative ones. But the negative tend to stand out more. I've had lots of visitors to my camp. Even a handful of impromptu jam sessions on the instruments I have set up. 
---
But there are some real rat bastards in this game. They are outnumbered in my experience. They do exist nonetheless. 
---
You know, reading the new 'vault and the questions they're asking our opinion on, really makes it seem like fallout 76 is in some kind of.... BETA.
---
anyone know how long stuff we drop in containers lasts?
---
Honestly I think they should've messed around with adding Co-op to something like Fallout 4 or Skyrim before attempting a Multiplayer game on this scale, also I feel the only Multiplayer people ever wanted in bethesda games was Co op, nobody really wanted ESO or Fallout 76.
---
Btw I do like Fallout 76, I just feel this is what they should've done before trying to make a large scale Multiplayer game like ESO or F76
---
It won't be. It will be a bigger patch than the last hotfix, but no new content, and a lot of bugs and QOL improvements will not be featured. 
---
I have over 400 hours and I still play. I only have about 3 games on rotation (MWO, FO76, and POE). I have 500-600 hrs+ on each Bethesda title since Morrowind. It's not about burn-out from overplaying, again they all love the base-game. It's more of finding things to do they haven't already done (map completion, base designing, unlocking mods and plans, etc) it would be nice to have a dungeon that is new every-time you enter it (like D3/POE maps). 
---
What you've described is just a different sort of play style. That's more a find what I need and then craft sort of thing. 
---
Whereas for people like myself (and OP I'm guessing), I'd like to know that I have the reserve resources to craft what I want at a moment's notice and then do the junk runs to replenish stocks.
---
Not saying one is better than the other. Just that different people have different preferences. Playing the way you described would feel like a chore for me.
---
Now that you know, leave the server next time and stop being spam killed by a team abusing this mechanic.  If you're not seeing players correctly flagged for PVP, why stick around at all just to die?  You're not going to win against three players unless you're a god, they're stupid, and you have an insane vats crit build.
---
I don't think there's any issue whatsoever with small fixes and/or additions being made. However, given that a lot of us still eagerly await our weekly alms of communication from our corporate overlords at Bethesda, it's pretty lame and telling for it to be an update on a change being made to essentially ONE enemy. 
---
The real kicker is the "Don't forget to check out the fortnite shit we added to the atomic shop!" at the end, but that's been beaten to death a trillion times. 
---
yeah me too!!! good on your for helping out make the wasteland a better place
---
lol, k
---
I could care less who‚Äôs carrying what. What is the single most important item is the fact you have broken the game. TSE weapons are shit. Every weapon is shit now and enemies are nothing but sponges. I am level 140 I have spend endless hours acquiring the best of the best items the game has to offer and THEY DONT KILL fast enough like they used to. Why should I keep playing bethesda?? You just flushed my character down the toilet after all that hard work back to a level 30. FIX TSE AND PUT IT BACK !!!!!!!
---
I'd be willing to bet all my caps and my pretty princess bed that there'll be far more than just these two changes; these are just the two they decided to 'preview' for us, probably since everyone's been complaining about how shitty SBs are.
---
I want the base servers, what we‚Äôre on now, to be PVP free except during events (in case they plan something in the future like the faction stuff). Let the pvp‚Äôers and griefers have their hardcore servers to do their thing. 
---
I‚Äôd like to point out that this weeks itv is a preview of the scorchbeast changes we‚Äôll see next patch, not the entirety of the patch‚Äôs changes.
---
*only ones that are lit on fire hehehe
---
No I don‚Äôt. But I expect them to address more than two issues. Actually no. I don‚Äôt expect anything more than this at this point. Not from these guys. 
---
It's because there is no need for them except a hassle and less overall resources than if you just went and farmed what you needed directly.
---
It's mainly Wednesday and Thursdays for awhile now.
---
So no it hasn't been falling behind. 
---
what? thats it?
---
I just don't get how that doesn't trigger 'wanted' for the player being an ass and attacking someone who's ignoring them. That's happened to me a load, they're not doing any real damage but it's curiously dickish behaviour the game doesn't do anything with.
---
A lot of good changes (plenty of new mechs, weapon systems, new engines, revamped skill points). Kinetic has RAC, Heavy/Light Gauss. Energy Has Regular and Heavy versions, PPC has Heavy and Light. Missiles have SRM,MRM,LRM,ATM, and Rockets. Engines have Standard, Light, and Extra Light. I still find it fun.
---
if these are the highlights then I fear for the actual patch
---
That would be great, really, but I feel in my guts it won't happen that way.
---
Hopefully my guts are wrong :P
---
I want a yee sang emote, complete with animations.
---
He's right, though. Besides I'm fairly sure with the infrequency of the initial Inside the Vault posts they're breaking them up over the weeks to pad it out and seem like there's more information than there is. Which is disingenuous, but people want weekly article updates but there's just not that much concrete information. They probably do know Inside the Vault content weeks in advance but want to break it up so it looks like there's frequent information
---
As you probably know, there' a new survival mode coming out that has unrestricted PVP.  The normal mode will be called "adventure mode." With the new survival mode coming out that has unrestricted PVP, it's actually pretty ridiculous that adventure mode would not be reserved exclusively for PVE. 
---
 Don't talk to me unless you agree with me. OK. ;)
---
I would have been happy with coop fallout 4. Just like 4 people playing survival mode fallout. My God fallout 76 has broken my heart.
---
And rip off the solo players?
---
The problem there is that your girlfriend or a friend don't drive the plot. Their comments might be fun, but they don't provide insight to the story (which in certain situations companions do, especially Nick and Piper.) In short, companions are vehicles for the storytelling. Your friends can't be that because they are not part of the script.
---
I think that's what Bethesda was going for though, wanting only humans being the player base, to make it the "real" experience of settling the post war world, ie if someone attacks you in RL then you don't have much of a choice either? 
---
Me too. I always get excited for them and expect them to drop great news, but that still hasn‚Äôt happened yet...
---
That was one aspect of the next patch they previewed, not the entire thing, there‚Äôll be more than that in the patch notes.
---
You should check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals. For people that enjoy the game despite the issues.
---
A lot of online games seem to do it that way. Content then fixes rinse and repeat
---
I can't even begin to comprehend what it's like to be this much of a boot-licking shill for a VIDEO GAME company, of all things. 
---
Way to not anser any of my questions. They weren't rhetorical. If you share that opinion with people that's okay. Go hang out with those people. Why are you hanging out on a sub for a videogame you hate. Those aren't strawman arguments. I'm not sure you know exactly what that means. People don't call it a bandwagon for no reason. There's usually some substance to that. This game scored the same in reviews as some of the worst games ever. You think this game is really a 5/10? You gotta be kidding me. It's at least a 7. It would be a 9 without the bugs and just a little more content.
---
Yep. PvP part got me to not buy it.
---
F76 would be considerably better if the devs actually put some work and love into the game
---
I agree. Tbh i'm kind of blown away they appear to be focusing on PVP content first, I don't really care about it. I will play on PVP i'm sure but wtf. 6 months for another beta?
---
That is a great and adorable idea. 
---
 Well not long, you need for the server you were on to get enough new players to force a new one for you. I'd guess a minute or two should do normally.
---
These should be footnotes in a patch.
---
Molemen are molerats in power armor
---
Yes it is a play style, one you should adopt.You can‚Äôt pick up everything you see on the ground and expect to never be overencumbered. That‚Äôs not the way this game was designed. That‚Äôs why they designed the option to specifically target certain mats. Your play style isn‚Äôt feasible or realistic. It‚Äôs the equivalent of wanting to be able to always carry one weapon for each kind of ammo type in the game. Sure it would be nice but it‚Äôs not realistic.
---
WHAT 
---
A 
---
SHOCKING
---
SURPRISE
---
?
---
I don't think it's dumb. Cooperative, persistent settlement building could make this game pretty awesome. I don't see it being possible outside of a private server, though, where a limited, known number of players could modify their privately shared world. It could be a lot like hosted Terraria or a Minecraft realm.
---
I actually came to FO76 from Destiny 2, as i was burnt out on that grind after playing months nonstop after work every day
---
??
---
Hey, would you be perhaps willing to sell/trade that AA or TS exemplar..?
---
?!
---
you on ps4? if so can come hang out with our group/server, incase it happens youd have help a fast travel away.. i have several female players i run with, and we very seldom every run into or encounter any griefing. 570 ish hours playtime here and only run into 3 incidents myself, 1 was asking, 2nd was accidental, 3rd went very wrong for the instigating griefers.   
---
now one of the women i run with likes to pick on low levels, she dresses up in the clown suit/mask and goes stares in the windows of low levels not saying anything to them.. so i guess she griefs them?
---
anyways psn: Silune
---
Is it a block for life or a just while you are logged on in that session / server? 
---
That sucks. Lol
---
The post was a highlight of the upcoming patch, it‚Äôs a newsletter, not patch notes.
---
If THESE sre the highlights, then the next patch is going to be shit. 
---
Have you thought the fact that she might be stalking ya? Lolol
---
Good lord dont give them that idea.
---
Follow your own advice...
---
I 100% agree they should have fixed the queens loot problem a while back.. To be honest I might give up too I really like the game but it‚Äôs pretty damn buggy. 
---
Scaled difficulty for x number of players participating, which is exactly what monster hunter world did. I found a lot of times it was easier to solo monsters than be with a random team. But if you were looking to help out other people or play with friends teaming was a lot of fun and rewarding 
---
I've noticed that also.  I personally think it's the right way to do it.  I would like to see 2 bug fixes and 1 content patch per month but that might be asking too much right now.  I would hope they can get there in the future.
---
Yes it's a discord for PC, we play most nights, some of us play during the day too. Only requirement is that you eventually have to be a general in the Enclave as it's a requirement to be able to launch nukes
---
The combat and physics are too shonky for it. They would need to redesign from the ground up for a full blooded combat survival game to be workably attractive. 
---
Thank you for the effort that it took to write your post. 
---
I usually don't crash that often. I usually log out at the plant so I just walk over shoot the four scorched, claim it, switch on constructor perk, build my fusion generator, and then add a bunch of turrets while I wait for the defend quest. I put on a hat, bandana, grab a bottle of booze or whatever the requirement is for the complete a quest/event for the day's atom rewards. I FT away if it's 3 or more waves and just do the reclaim quest. I then do my vendor runs, or the rest of the days challenges and come back to 3 fc.  
---
I hit level 50 and am pretty much done with the game.  I haven't finished the game, I'm just ‚Ä¶ done.  No friends want to play it, and I guess the only reason I haven't uninstalled is I still remember how much fun the other Fallout games were. 
---
lol no ones gonna suck a lil thing like that!
---
Bring back two shot explosive to what it was. Start buffing other things and then after you get other wepons buffed start rebalancing. Everything is just bullet sponge unless your melee class. Have free special Respec and put in learned cards like lockpick and hacking. I have to change my cards out every freaking time I want to lock pick or hack it's ridiculous. You want to work on PVP make cards just for PVP players. Don't punish PvE for having a good time.  The Nerf killed the game for me. I don't know if it's just me or not but it might be a lot of other to. I love fallout but you Nerfed this one to death. Please upvote if you agree. Thank you
---
Lolol then break up with her??
---
Yeah, don‚Äôt be a whiny bitch like this post ... irony 
---
Jesus christ man if ONLY I knew it was going to happen beforehand. I don't care what you believe, and I Have no reason to lie, so go be a twat to someone else
---
Oooh, i'm really into this idea. 
---
Rather than just dropping my excess weapons and junk in my camp I should just do this
---
Maybe, if the game had cost me 20 dollars and not 60, I would be calm. 
---
The pvp on souls games is interesting. It's not really balanced though. The way it is implemented is amazing though. I can't believe more games haven't done something similar. The part I don't like is the amount of animations that render the attacker invincible. Back stabs and parries. It's just lame being unable to interrupt them. But otherwise it is well done and just rare enough to not be overwhelming. 
---
I have literally never, not once, said, inferred, or implied that I hate Fallout 76. 
---
You made that up. In your head. That is a complete fabrication based on YOUR reaction to somebody criticizing a video game, RIGHT before you said you weren't creating straw men. That is not normal. 
---
but wheres the content, its all been fixes since the start
---
*While you‚Äôre at it, take a moment to head to the Atomic Shop, because we‚Äôve added a variety of new items you can pick up using the Atoms you‚Äôve earned by completing challenges, like Black Sunglasses, the VTU Track Suit, the Red Rocket Bed, and more.*
---
ugh
---
This might be one of the least productive posts I‚Äôve seen yet
---
Just another member of the white-knight sub. Move along guys.
---
&gt;Head to the official Fallout 76 forums to share answers to the following questions **(NOTE: The forums are currently offline for maintenance, but we will let you know as soon as they're back in action and ready for your answers!)**: 
---
Bethesda... it never changes. 
---
Yeah. The term MMO gets thrown around pretty loosely now, basically any game with a worldspace inhabited by 30 or so players at a time is considered an MMO in their eyes.
---
People are basically just forgetting what an actual MMO is, I think.
---
Being Bloodied isn‚Äôt so much a problem for me. I run a single Chameleon piece and I‚Äôm constantly crouched, so I don‚Äôt get hit very much at all at distance. I play it like a Sneaky Sniper. 
---
I definitely agree with you on the points you‚Äôve raised though. The more I look into it, the more I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI just kinda don‚Äôt want a Vats build yet‚Äù, plus, with all the energy resist out there, that paper 500 might not be as much as I‚Äôm expecting. The 10mm shreds things, I know that for a fact, even without the Explosive Damage.
---
I‚Äôll probably just make a new toon for the Tesla Rifle at some point, it looks like fun, but ionno if I can trust energy weapons. 
---
Toolbox at the Overseer's camp for me for most of my plans. I dump unwanted legendaries at the Wagota blue suitcase after SBQs or whatever. My favorite time is post SBQ when it is like Christmas checking the Watoga and BOS vendor. I have scored some real nice hand-me-downs. 
---
If TSE wasn't nerfed so much and all bugs where fixed thousands and thousands would still be playing and end game content would be way less important.
---
I am at the point where I'm afraid to log in due to people missing armor and weapons.
---
Yes!!!
---
Believe it or not when you take someone's money and run, they will probably want to have a word about it. See, that's just bad business. Doesn't matter when you were born, being promised things that aren't delivered on really sucks.
---
Todd Howard himself said that he thinks this game would be great for the traditional Bethesda Fallout fanbase. The way I see it, that was a complete lie and I feel as though the marketing was very misleading.
---
OP was born in 1995. 
---
Lol well I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve already gotten some response. I love this game so much. I just hate seeing negative posts from this channel 
---
To be fair, they are probably referring to the bosses of individual locations (the "crowned" enemies), which are reasonably consistent about producing bonus loot.  Yes, they should have addressed the SBQ as part of that, but their work has never been thorough.
---
84 
---
Seriously? 1 week to say that? Joke.
---
I would rather PvP but we are already getting that. But it would be nice to have PvE only as well. I have no idea why Bethesda decided to make the combat the way they did. It angered both the PvP and the PvE people.
---
I solo'd her pre explosive nerf. Took 16 minutes. Had a server to myself so I gave it a go. Was mostly due to adds that made it take so long. Yet to try it since nerfs, probably possible but would use way more grenades for add control. 
---
My big issue with your post is that Winamp is free, if it has issues then it has issues. The game was not free, so people can have some reasonable expectation when it comes to things working and being fixed properly from patch to patch. 
---
I'd love to agree with you but if icomplaining I have to "Suck your duck!" What do I have to do if I agree with you?? 
---
I hope they fix the sonic farts as well, no way should they be able to blast backwards like they do during strafing runs. Or just give us 360 degree vats shots without turning.
---
I will be playing the new Far Cry - because like Fallout I play them all. But I will still be playing F76 after I have completed FC5.5!
---
And you don‚Äôt have to look far on this subreddit to see how much the Atom Store is mocked. It‚Äôs probably making some money, but I doubt it‚Äôs near as much as they were hoping for.
---
Hey I respect your opinion- I‚Äôm not sure what proof you‚Äôre looking for but if you follow any social media platforms you‚Äôll see quite a large amount of people posting how they‚Äôre quitting the game, it‚Äôs unavoidable and in high volume.  I‚Äôm sure if someone wanted to invest the time in to collecting that data it‚Äôs possible but you won‚Äôt get it from me XD. However I believe this game does need a big player base since the entire point of the game is creating your own unique experiences with other players online. I believe they won‚Äôt let modders have their way in private servers because then that eliminates the atomic shop- which is their main stream of revenue. If they‚Äôre not making money they won‚Äôt be paying for servers to stay up, or paying for their team to update. They need money.  You don‚Äôt think with big game releases coming up soon that this will inevitably take away from the player base for good unless FO76 does something soon?
---
Okay that was not the proper approach I apologize for that. 
---
This games shooting mechanics just aren't good enough for pvp. Go grab a minimum or gatling laser and fire it while spinning fast. Watch how the bullets lag behind your gun. It's excusable in fallout 4 because it's single player and rpgish. But In a pvp environment it's laughably bad. 
---
Me as well. I don't care at all about PvP for this game. It's not what I bought it for at all.
---
Im sorry, but this community is starved for information about how this game will improve in the future.  There is a huge lack of transparency as to what is really happening behind the curtains here.  
---
I was excited to see there was a new "inside the vault" today, but after reading it i was extremely underwhelmed.  So many topics that need to be covered with fo76, and you give us scorchbeasts.... 
---
Again, we need transparency or what little glimmer of hope that remains for FO76 rebounding will fizzle out. 
---
 Its 46 for me. What game are we playing here? ;)
---
Path of Enlightment at the Lighthouse spawns a Mothman you can take a picture with if you complete the event.
---
I really hope this isn't a "bait and switch" like with the TSE nerf where it was all "Look over here at what we are nerfing at your request!" and then "We also nerfed all this you didn't ask us too since we didn't want to buff other stuff!"
---
They don‚Äôt play the game, so it isn‚Äôt an inconvenience to them
---
I have a tesla rifle with no stars or perks and it never needs repairing . Has anyone else experienced this ?
---
Formerly BattleCry Studios, renamed to Bethesda Studios Austin. They "replaced Certain Affinity on assisting id Software with development of post-release multiplayer content" on DOOM before co-developing FO76. Their first endeavor, BattleCry, was cancelled by Bethesda before release.
---
So yeah, this studio has no successful track record with *anything.*
---
[*Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin)
---
Why are people so focused on a separate PvP server when we could just implement a "wilderness" pvp zone in the map like in RuneScape? You all realize that these dedicated PvP servers will be completely dead in the span of a few months once a big group takes over the server right?
---
Since forum is down:
---
Which enemies are currently your favorites to fight? Why?
---
Everyday basis - super mutants because it can feel like a fire fight.  Nades and missiles and cover feels more dynamic than standing in one place waiting for a molerat to pop up.
---
But what I really like fighting is Deathclaws, Behemoths, Sloths, anything epic that could fuck me up.  I'd add scorchbeasts, and they are dun in their own right (minus the non-stop screech), but they aren't nearly as threatening as they should be on the ground (damage dealing wise).  If a scorchbeast is in my face it just tickles.
---
Which enemies do you currently dislike encountering? Why?
---
Stingwing mosquitos, they're frustrating to kill and creepy and do the poison damage on top of messing with my screen.
---
What makes an encounter with an enemy or creature fun or intriguing to you?
---
At first, being a little freaked out by them and their very presence.  Mothman did this well.  What keeps them interesting is a challenge in fighting.  While he has neat mechanics, he doesn't scale up enough to be a threat sadly.
---
What types of enemies would you like to see added to Fallout 76 in the future? Why?
---
More horrible mothmen, big badasses, and fluidy flesh/tentacled lovecraftian/eldritch abominations.
---
Other than legendary items, what types of loot help a fight feel rewarding to you?
---
It honestly feels good getting raw caps, and that only comes in tiny amounts from super mutties.  But also rare junk (currently nice to get acid/titanium/springs), maybe flux.
---
Would you like to see more challenging enemies added in the future, that may require multiple players or a team to defeat? Why?
---
Definitely.  Or at least more difficulty to current encounters (A deathclaw island should be terrifying).  It's running into such enemies then deciding 'alright gear up time to beat this thing' and popping some chems to charge in or other times noping the fuck out that make it interesting.  
---
Just them existing occasionally alternates you between spacing out on clearing trash out of the way and butt pickering go-time. 
---
Dayum.  Lol
---
Lmao
---
Yep, I finished full Prestige Raid Gear and Trial of 9's. Still loved it but all the players I started with left, then the next 3 guilds I joined fell apart as well. Still thinking of jumping back in once I see this current expansion go on sale.
---
That‚Äôs a fair point. No real reason to go ham. 
---
Holding out for outerworlds
---
You‚Äôre playing the endgame apparently 
---
sure, call this EA mode but they have burned through a large percentage of their player-base with poorly executed patches, senseless nerfs, and an abject lack of any form of tangible roadmap for the future of the game.  
---
Oh, you're one of those people. The know-it-alls who think they know best.
---
Ok buddy. You do you.
---
Neither fit the tone, theme, or aesthetic of pre-fallout 76 Fallout. But, I could probably argue that Metro is currently more Fallout than Fallout, especially given the fortnite-esque fucking garbage we're being force fed. 
---
Bethesda try hard i waaaaaah
---
Shut it Todd
---
I‚Äôve felt that way about radscorpions since fallout 3. I‚Äôd rather fight just about anything else. 
---
As your elder, you sound just as bad as every other whiney post
---
Yeah, melee is just broken, but I'm not that low just to jump on being the OP trend, so I stick with my rifles, and heh spamming Super-Stimpaks and Nuka-Cola quantam has gotten me out of some real sticky situations. Not efficient,, but it does save my ass by keeping health up and the AP regen up, hate when I run out of them hehe. And yeah I agree with PvP it seems that it's best to have friends while doing it or in a group, cause it means you'll have more firepower overall, and for me who's a lone wanderer, that ain't something I can really achieve since most of my friends bailed on me getting the game, so the pickles I've been in are hell of a story.
---
Also a melee build with assassins sentinel wouldn't work as much, mostly since you'll have to be moving, maybe a assassins cavaliers set for just running up and smiting people would do better.
---
Don't you just love these "experienced" gamers who just blame the new generations as being entitled for wanting a working product?
---
Gatekeeping
---
I'm on xbox but trying to get the legs and all BOS plans
---
The majority of Fallout fans don't care about PvP. We have been happy playing the games by ourselves for years. It amazes me how the game studio is listening so much to the minority of players who scream at the top of their lungs.
---
 Good lord Far Cry 1 and 2 were good, the rest crap. Metro games are just COD warmed over and go play Staker if you want this world.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to the comments on this one. 
---
This game is on maintenance mode. They cashed out. 
---
Useless into the vault... Ok scorthbeast... Meh.... And the reference of the atomic store sounds like a provocation. How dare they push us to buy more when there is nothing concrete to ease our frustration... 
---
Damn, Rose is a stone cold fox! 
---
Actually worse. Most of those posts at least make some kinda of point. Does attacking others make you feel big? 
---
This is a newsletter, not the full patch notes, the bugs and feedback thread mentions some of the fixes we‚Äôll see in patch 6.
---
can‚Äôt believe i thought she looked like a fucking computer screen until now  
---
*finally
---
I like what they said. Can't wait to see the scorchbeast changes!
---
yup, WoW and Minecraft are MMO's, only ones I'm familiar with but sure their must be a couple more. I have played on MC servers that had caps of 200 players and not sure what WoW is but pretty sure it's close per realm.
---
You can have glitch filled single player games because the duping and overpowered builds don't really matter. You cannot do this on multiplayer games. I remember having this argument with a friend of mine a bunch of years ago about Skyrim, that game had tons of glitches and problems that only got fixed because of the modding community (which has been true for Bethesda games forever). He would always go on rants about "It's not the job of the fan base to fix broken games", I would just shrug him off and defend Bethesda but honestly? Years of enabling has led us to this point.
---
Will we ever see a text chat on PC, Bethesda? Communication with other players is a real challenge if you don't have a microphone... 
---
Any ideas of when the new expansions will come out?
---
Wtf, they need to be doing more than this...
---
You make an excellent point, here, thanks!
---
same usually wanted for defending someones house from something. only time i have been wanted before that was when i first started playing the game i was at the airport above charleston someone had claimed the workshop (i didnt know). went up to the tower and picked the lock and caught wanted status, checked map and was like aww hell this is a workshop area, wonderful.. think i was like lvl 18 or 20.
---
Whoa that‚Äôs an interesting idea. Sacrifice a little camp budget to open up your stash. 
---
It's all good I'm just joking with you. People are always going to hate something. Remember the hate for no mans sky or EA (ok that one is justified) I truly love and hate the game in equal measure. It was never going to be Fallout 4 online and I accepted that from day one. Sure I'd love to to be closer to fallout 4 (that was my first fallout game) but it's not. 
---
Scorch beasts on farm mode since lvl 50.  Give me literally any new content.
---
Check out Oxhorn on YouTube.  He has a vid on the lore around that location.  
---
What a fucking joke. Theres literally a list of shit they can fix and they choose like 2 things. Still no word on player vending or vault openings. Since the last patch this game has been so tedious and boring. Im just getting so tired of this minimum amount of shit patched every other week
---
To be fair it just works... can‚Äôt argue that
---
&gt; Would you like to see more challenging enemies added in the future, that may require multiple players or a team to defeat? Why?
---
Yes.  Every zone should have a boss that shows up when you nuke that area.  Not all of them should be at the SBQ lvl, but at least it gives us variety in our endgame fights.
---
That's straight bullshit. A majority of this games content is merely the environment. Quests are bare bones. No endgame at all. No dungeons or raids. The environment is nice I'll give it that. 
---
I don't think anybody cared about the lack of content as much as the fact that the game was incredibly broken in numerous ways. T-posing enemies, invisible enemies, loot not loading, plants not disappearing, PvP being broken and abused, 2SE weapons being broken, and more.
---
Lackluster. Kinda like the game itself.
---
Servers have improved but companies don't care about optimization as much anymore. Also, the two games used incredibly different game engines. So comparing them like apples and apples is very shortsighted.
---
I actually really appreciate reading this. This is the kind of perspective on the game that I had at the tip of my brain but couldn't form the proper thought. I can really appreciate that style of game, and now that you've described it to me better I think I can get a bit more out of the game. 
---
Damn, that sucks.  I'm sorry you're getting this treatment.
---
They're way more complicated than they should be. It's *possible* to get them to work, but a serious pain in the ass. Agree completely that the terminal needs more functionality. I have no advice on how to get it to do more. It's just not built in yet.
---
If you want the door with the keypad to open from the other side you have to add an *additional* switch, and then connect that to the door*frame*. Not to the prong. There's a hidden additional connector *inside* the door that can be triggered by a switch. That built-in switch only seems to be present to allow the keypad to work. 
---
I have one of these set up so that the outside (the white side, which is annoying, the keypad should be on the brick side but anyway...) is only accessible via keypad but the inside has a pressure plate hooked up to the hidden connector inside the door. So keypad to get in, pressure plate to get out. 
---
That janky workaround aside, they need to add a *lot* more functionality to the powered systems in general. The terminal should be able to selectively open/close *one* door or flip *one* switch rather than an all or nothing. It should also be possible to hook it, as you said, directly to a door and control it. I have a ton of suggestions if /u/bethesdagamestudios_ is interested.
---
Would do 
---
Yeah and it may help with server stability if they just have to track a box in the camp instead of 200 of an item.
---
I think we will see the added areas type content after they, hopefully soon, release the roadmap and show us where they are going to take the game.
---
Welcome to the rest of us. You took your time but better late than never.
---
 Yes I'm very old. ;) Level 72 now.
---
Lmao exactly
---
I think there's a lot of misinformation out there on the interwebs. I'm definitely glad I asked üòä
---
I seriously which I had another similar game to play atm.  Already finished RDR-2 before I started fallout 76.
---
It really is at the stage where you'd do yourself a favor and park it for 6 months and come back when/if there's some real changes/fixes.
---
Please include a hidden variable that will give us a good legendary after 100 3 star kills and not a useless rng generated legendary.
---
I am lvl 214 and have not dropped anything I could use...
---
I am playing less because of no progress in loots.
---
Kind of a shame, it'd be really cool if we could merge camps or something
---
You will be disappointed. Black Desert isn't that good and the western implementation was been extemely P2W
---
They're boring to fight because their movement is so janky and awful. You basically sit and say to yourself; "Should i fight this SB for 30 minutes to get nothing and then have to spend the following 2 hours scrounging for scrap to fix my shit? or should i just avoid this fight entirely?", Maybe that was intended? I guess you could make the argument that part of a "survival" game is making a cost/benefit analysis before every engagement but I personally do not find that gameplay fun.
---
Unless you launch a nuke, then it totally puts you in a different server. 
---
But how can it be, that matter while my limit was 5k, it was 25k for my friends? All on PC and same client version. File integrity verified by launcher.
---
whats myspace? j/k 
---
Yeah, I've noticed that no one uses any mics on this game... I don't always want to party up with people if I don't know them yknow?
---
B-but the devs have families and are working real haaardd ;(  .We should all stop whining because it hurts Bethesda's feelings.
---
They are working on a visual roadmap I think it's coming out later this month but I'm not sure about that 
---
The next patch will be addressing more than what was in this weeks ITV post, some fixes are mentioned in the bugs and feedback thread.
---
10/10 would do 
---
I haven't had very many duplicate plans/recipes since they added the (known) label. I usually just leave known things where they are in the hopes that someone else will come along.
---
I dump ammo and some useless (to me) legendaries in the blue suitcases at railroads though
---
&gt;Bethesda is shitty, and this game does suck.
---
Okay so you don't hate something you think is shitty and sucks? In your words. Right there. Is that not implying hate of this game? (I infer, you imply in this case. You can't infer something about yourself) We can talk semantics all day but the average person would probably say someone that thinks the game is shitty and sucks generally don't like (or hate) the game. I'm really not sure what you're getting at with the whole straw man thing. I'm not sure we're actually arguing anything. I'm more so inquiring than arguing. You're the one trying to argue that this game sucks and it's shitty but somehow you like it, but at the same time you don't like it....
---
Wise decision üòâ
---
You on ps4? 
---
I second this
---
Haha.  Thanks. :)
---
They limited the bunker to one terminal, the centre one or first from the left in the production area, This was done to stop a duplication exploit that allowed players to purchase the same item at the same time and then sell it back once to rinse and repeat.
---
My camp has been in the middle of the mire (Near a mirelurk queen spawn) 
---
Only recently have people attacked it.
---
I fast travel, throw on the suppressed sniper and few potshots later im giving the disappointed emote grabbing their stuff so i can repair mine
---
They should thank me for only taking a wanted bounty off them and not 100-150 caps because of their levels
---
I'm on PC shoot me a message when you get playing I'll give yah some help to get started in game.
---
Thank you for backing me, we both are hated online now üò≥
---
&gt;Push free DLC all you want, 70% of core mechanics are boring and the story is hidden in 50+ book reports from dead people.
---
The most accurate description of this game to date.
---
I saw him at level 16 and believe me I pissed myself 
---
2 changes, and a Atom Shop plug. Wow, thanks BGS
---
i totally get that!
---
maybe at the start of the game, we could choose a faction and that would predicate the pvp experience i,e. which faction you chose like vault dweller/raider/BoS, enclave/Ceasers Army (oops wrong game)
---
Exactly. What's the game play pay off? We need game play to change and evolve as we gain and level up. Games this do this well are extremely excellent. God of War is now my favorite game of all time and it was phenomenal how kratos would get cooler stronger moves as the game went on. Best loot was the infinity gauntlet homage, where once you got 3 of the knock off infinity stones you could shoot a cool missile from your arm. Cool loot+cool reference+cool gameplay unlocked= fun
---
There is no defense for them. We saw how broken shit was during the beta. It should have been called at that point and delayed. I have no doubt that the developers asked the higher ups to delay and got a flat out no.
---
"It just works."  ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇ
---
Haven't seen em yet but the one at the light house i have.
---
...Well atleast there is leaderboard and climbing to top of it and defending your positions gives something to do, rather than not playing at all.
---
Oh look, another boot licker.
---
It hasn‚Äôt been lately, no, but ‚Äúit kept falling behind‚Äù was describing the first few that did in fact keep falling behind. 
---
ah, nice! thanks, i didnt know it was a thing!
---
Well, better than nothing 
---
I would so like to see that .-.
---
should add that maybe it applies to any MODUS use in the bunker, IE someone in the medical area stops use in production/military area. might be worth checking if you have friends on.
---
Thank you for the feedback, I will be passing it along to the team
---
I see that side. But it's too easy even solo, I have a net gain of stims / junk after fighting through the silo solo. The nuke zones, even in a rad suit aren't challenging
---
So... basically what you what is a game that isn't this game?
---
A lack of world permanence and softcore survival are core to the game.
---
It's like people who dislike this game because it's multiplayer and online.
---
I dont understand why people say its a grind, i literaly did the missions and it took me to level 70, the only time i had to grind is when i was trying to just do my own thing and not take workshops or do missions. 
---
Should the game suck your dick and wipe your ass too?
---
"Give us some more feedback so we can do nothing with it."
---
Funny. Most of us saw a live service cash grab and knew to avoid it.
---
A scorchbeast shooting the sonic attacks on the ground will look kinda weird
---
Why start pvp character? Why not just use the one you already have?
---
This is so sad but honestly probably true. It costs so much more money to fix a game than it would be to just scrap it and hype up some other release...
---
&gt; I genuinely don't think they care. They should already have access to all the statistics and can tell how many players bother with PvP. I suspect it's a very small minority of players, but BGS chose to prioritize appeasing them above all of us who enjoy PvE and would like more quests, events, and general endgame content. 
---
OR... they have access to all the statistics and it shows those that bother with PvP aren't as small of a minority as you think?
---
Worth considering. The ongoing bias of this sub is the belief they represent the entire player base, so when this sub is ignored, it means the entire player base is being ignored. 
---
I second your second thank you
---
Treasure maps don't drop legendaries unfortunately. They can drop see nicely modded level appropriate gear though.
---
This game was literally advertised as a game to grieve players. One of the main things on the preview was being able to nuke players and their bases. And you bought that game. Now everyone wants to whine and complain about pvp and grieving. Wrong game if you just want pve
---
Don't forget to drop by the Atom store on your way out :)
---
Well yeah basically I walk up to a base/hideout m/etc. Start punching the door or a wall till it gives in and go straight for turrets, after that generators, showers, crafting tables etc. I just like to punch stuff :) 
---
I paid the same amount as you did, I‚Äôm enjoying the game for what it is and what it will be. Fallout 4 still has bugs but no one is complaining about that still. Bethesda is moving into the mmorpg field and it‚Äôs expected to have faults.. no need for all the hate after they have been trying to make things right. I get it everyone is upset but constant complaining is just overkill in my opinion. This is my only post here because it‚Äôs all been said already, the game will get better it just takes time 
---
System Xbox: Feed back on enemies:
---
I feel like I should encounter deathclaws more frequently. I always enjoy fighting them as they are challenge. With that said... I wish nukes zones will spawn enemies regardless of what was already present. That would make the nuke zone more rewarding plus any part of the map could be nuked without it feeling like a waste. 
---
No word on broken stealth.
---
No word on mutations/radworms interaction
---
No word on increase in server instability
---
No word on increased weapon and armour degradation
---
No word on increased hunger and thirst levels
---
No word on the fact that their last patch rolled back a bunch of issues
---
No word on the damage bug/extreme lag being back for a lot of players
---
No word on Bulked items now scrapping when you "scrap all junk"
---
No reason to play this week.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ people, when have these posts ever listed everything that's coming on a patch?
---
It's always a "hey, here's something we're working on" update not the fucking patch notes. 
---
Def would inject Chems with.
---
landing would be enough
---
Probably 
---
I'd join you if I were on PC! It'd be nice if this was cross platform ;_;
---
Yeah obviously your way is better since it requires rank 3 of a perk card and mine doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs ok, waste the points if you want and continue the sloppy play style 
---
Not really vats Crits are a 100% hit chance I have used them to kill players with sentinel armour loads of times 
---
proof?
---
Latest ITV says 2 things, bugs and feed back doesn't mean anything. The first bug and feedback thread still has tons of stuff that was in it that never got fixed
---
Then read the fucking patch notes when they release those. 
---
Is the FO76 subreddit usually just a circle jerk amongst the fan boys that have refused to acknowledge its shittiness? My husband and I started playing this game shortly after this last patch that apparently re-broke the game...months after its release.
---
And its *still* hardly playable. My husband and I had to fight this game to play it. Swallow all of the disconnects, going invisible, invisible corpses, bugged out quest progression, audio cutting out, fucky weight and over encumbered bullshit...the list goes fucking on and on. And quite a few "vets" will just tell people they should "know a way around the bugs by now." Exsqueeze me? No. No, no, and no. The game should be fucking STABLE and it isn't. Don't go after someone complaining about losing all of their progress because they didn't buddy up with someone to rejoin the world. That isn't how it's supposed to work.
---
But people are calling other people entitled for wanting a game's basic functions to run reliably and smoothly for the most part. What. The. Fuck.
---
And no they are asking about creature diversity and bullshit like this game is still a newborn. Nahnhanhanahnah.
---
What guts me is the fact that this might be such a fucking bomb that we will never see a proper FO multi-player from them and it'll be years before we see a regular FO title. They'll take this shit as a wasted loss and they'll never bother again. I'm all for keeping the dream alive in hopes of them pulling their heads out of their asses, but I feel this already small subreddit and overall sour opinion toward 76 just indicates that the game will never be prioritized and it'll never become what people(all of us) hoped it would with some TLC. I just imagine a handful of guys stuck in a cramped room off to the side just limping this game along, and the lack of money and popularity won't make it any better.
---
But that isn't the people's doing. They shouldn't have released this game in the abysmal state its still in. The peeps still hard defending them must be gluttons for punishment. 
---
Yeah, when I checked youtube for videos of other people doing it (to see if my experience was normal or not) it usually WAS grounded. I think it was supposed to be the way you experienced it. 
---
Do you think it would take away from the player to player interaction? 
---
And ps. Im lvl 61 and i have no problem holding my own against anyone in pvp. Just because you cant make a build don‚Äôt blame the game
---
What did it cost?
---
Umm... wow. Don't even know where to begin.
---
GAMERS RISE UP is at all times and forever, a sarcastic and mocking statement. 
---
[Anthem](https://old.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/anu24f/postlaunch_roadmap/) and [Apex Legends](https://old.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/an7cm8/amazing_to_see_they_already_have_a_year_1_roadmap/) both have visual roadmaps. And Anthem hasn't even released yet.
---
That is how you do it. Let people know you're actually planning on releasing content so people have something to look forward to.
---
yo, Patch 6 is not here. 
---
This is what people have been asking for from the beginning.  A drop-in/drop-out co-op system for 2-4 players in a world just like Skyrim or Fo4.  
---
Heck, they probably wouldn‚Äôt even need to do anything special like co-op events or increasing the amount of enemies; players would have made their own fun with mods.
---
 The message we get with Fo76 is that if Bethesda does multiplayer it has to be only other players.  NPCs, worldbuilding, or a good storyline can‚Äôt exist within the same game.
---
Need more behemoths. Only ever seen one that wasn't a guaranteed spawn in over 140 levels, I've seen more flatwood monsters and moth men and they are supposed to be the legends.

You know the Chinese are the "bad" guys in this universe, right? Like I get what you're ask8ng, but considering how everything in the Fallout universe despises or shows a little bit of resentment towards China and Communism (count the number of times you've seen a asian person in any of the games), outfits celebrating Lunar New Year wouldn't make sense at all
---
Just saying that you don't require an instigating melee weapon. In fact, I'd say those are pretty useless in PVP, as 90% of the usual PVPers roll around with a tiny bit of rads to prevent instigating doing anything.
---
I disagree. I don't doubt that they've pissed off a fair few of us, but I actually suspect it's not that large a percentage, not from the causes you mentioned. If anything, i suspect the lack of end-game is what'll hurt the player base the most. 
---
The last 5 have been on Wednesday, but mainly Thursday. they have said that they shoot for these two days,
---
Some of them have fallen on other days before that because of Holidays.
---
You can go look it up yourself. But you wont. 
---
We have freedom of speech in this world for a reason. I have no room for hate in my life. Yes I said love and hate in my previous post but we're all know it's just a game. There has been countless games that have changed / been made worse because of updates or false promises. If all you can do is type hate or disrespectful comments you should take a good look at yourself and realise that even professionals make mistakes. 
---
seeing this on PC as well, loot one stash and all the rest in the world seem to be empty after that, they instanced the stashes to player and really messed that up. Just put it back to the way it was, farming cap stashes is not an exploit, it's part of the FO universe.
---
Utterly lacklustre and fails to address a single complaint 
---
Sounds like you don't really know what an MMO is either lol. Minecraft is not an MMO at all. There may be servers that, with mods, can make the game play somewhat similarly to an MMO, but that does not make MINECRAFT an MMO. The term MMO is not solely defined by the terms that each letter stands for. There are certain features MMOs have that define it. Even then, 200 players is not even CLOSE to "massive" in terms of an MMO. 
---
Nobody knows the exact numbers on how many players a WoW realm caps out at, but it's estimated between five and ten thousand players at a time. And that is per realm. 
---
Other MMOs off the top of my head are Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy XIV Online, Elder Scrolls Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, Star Trek Online, Champions Online, Neverwinter.
---
No, it's different. Not better. Much like your preferred playstyle. It's all about trade-off.
---
Wow, there's no helping some people.
---
"Nice photo!"
---
If you're expecting a complete and detailed overview of everything coming in the next patch from an "inside the vault" post all that means is you've apparantly never read Inside the Vault before. Wait for the fucking patch notes. 
---
Hah! They CAN'T argue with you, you're a woman! 
---
Check mate, shills. 
---
No they can't actually. They've proven that much.
---
Some sort of salty CM or GM or even Todd not liking the fact that people don't want to give them money and wait months and months and months for fixes.
---
This ITV is blatant troll bait, which is pathetic and i hope people remember this when they try to release more games.
---
Roll it back.
---
&gt; Wow, there‚Äôs no helping some people.

My sentiments exactly!

Keep at it bro!

move your base down by the bottom left corner of the map (between nuka cola plant and camden park) quite place, very lil traffic, access to alot of water and plenty of flat spots for a good farm been there roughly 150 of my 200 lvls and never had anyone bother my home.  always see people around it hitting the nuka plant or camden park farming.
---
vendors are part of factions, if you sell your items and exhaust a caps pool at one faction, the rest in that faction will not have any caps for you. [here is the faction list](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/)
---
Well in previous games they did, I feel they are becoming careless 
---
LMFAO! That would be the day. I'm basically stating that I'm excited for the patch
---
yeah.. I've thought about posting about this myself, but I've not made enough edits myself to really be able to complain. 
---
That being said, if everyone just picked something they wanna work on, the wikis could get fleshed out fairly quick.
---
True to your name, I see.
---
I, for one, think you should call the Dragonborn. It‚Äôs nothing a little shouting can‚Äôt fix lol
---
They have said since BETA that they had all this great new content coming. Then they start asking us what kinds of events and creatures we want in the game. Starting to think there isn't much new content that could be released anytime soon if they wanted to. With all the bad press and angry players, if they had more content it would have been a good idea to release it already.
---
That's not the update. Think of it as the teaser before the patch just highlighting a few things. 
---
A bleak future?  At least it's lore friendly
---
I'd be down to join the discord! Could you hit me up with a link?
---
Also sometimes they'll say they have zero until you try to sell something. But yeah, vendor factions.
---
When will they fix the fusion core nerf man that‚Äôs annoying as fuck
---
ahh i see, thanks very much :)
---
lol this guy
---
Yea, there is so many problems and all they do is fix two...
---
This reminds me of Star Wars battlefront 2 ‚Äúlive service‚Äù I appreciate the work they are trying but what if most of everyone that worked on the game left and we only have a handful of people left 
---
I would let her mug me anyday
---
You write a post like that and we're the entitled, whiny bitches? 
---
A tracksuit so I can channel my inner slav!
---
That's what I was hoping.  Thanks for the comment.
---
I believe this is tied to the problem with certain mods being stackable when quickly equipping/un-equipping them that they addressed, just a guess but I think the game removes the item to avoid it doubling the effect and then bugs while trying to reattach it
---
Not really a favourite to note. But just saying I absolutely despise molerats, radrats and generally anything that clings to your feet, low to the ground while moving around spasticly and makes my feel like my character is about to experience a hernia in combinations with a an attack of some sort. I hate that I have to resort to vats too much to get them without wasting a ton of ammo. Somehow makes a challenging thing feel less challenging. 
---
Disappointing yes but were people expecting a novel? Shit if Bethesda gave us an actual roadmap people would bitch about the release times for updates.
---
I'm not sure what "lore" you claim they break, but they are supposed to be big, scary, flying Nopes.
---
It really speaks to modern gamer mentality how some players would rather server hop or demand changes that would trivialize the enemy rather than admit defeat and either run or give the Fission Sites the wide berth they deserve.
---
Sad times 
---
I'd suggest you look at the poll I recently posted.
---
While the ratio of people not spending to money to people that are is pretty skewed, there are still far more people buying atoms than I expected.
---
Some vendors are a part of the same cap pool. In all there are 7 diffferent factions of vendors, some with their own cap pool. Most belong to the 2 main factions, responders and raiders. This may help: http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
Well you can't determine a large number of players are doing anything by looking at 'I quit' posts, on social media or anywhere else. That was part of my point. :P  Those posts are not useful as data. For one, you don't know if the person will actually quit in the first place, or if they will quickly return. Two, you don't know how many new players are joining to offset any losses. And three, you have no idea how many people actually play the game, which would be necessary to determine the significance of the numbers leaving. 'Large' might make sense if thousands leave a game with like 50k players. Thousands of people quitting a game with a million or millions of players is not a significant number of people and not contextually 'large' or 'high volume'. 
---
As far as the game needing a big playerbase, you didn't really address what I wrote. Our servers cap at 24 players, so you need to explain how you expect to see any difference between having 1000 players playing and having 1000000 players playing (you won't see any difference). 
---
Bethesda has already stated that mods are going to be available with private servers. So on one hand I get why you're skeptical, but on the other hand, you're not really interfacing with reality on that one. They've made the promise, and every single Fallout game has mods (including FO4 which had Creation Club, the equivalent of Atom Shop, which already undermines your argument because Bethesda didn't let CC stop mods).
---
To answer your question, big new game releases ARE going to take people away. That's how gaming works. What they're not going to do is take away all of Bethesda's earnings. There will still be players here and, as I've already explained, mods and private servers will bring players back and keep the game lucrative. Then there's the likely reality that nothing Bethesda could do would stop the leavers from leaving. This studio isn't going to just pump out a bunch of content in the next month or two. That's not how games development works. So no matter how much you want them do make big changes and create fun new things, it's just not going to happen. :P
---
The game is going to be fine if you're playing it just to have fun, and you like what it offers, because as I've explained high concurrent population in this game's design means almost nothing. But if you're playing it to be the cool kid who plays the cool popular game that millions of people love talking about, then yea, this isn't for you. xD
---
One of the tactics being used extensively by these "raiders" is block and server hop after they've killed you or destroyed your base for lolz.
---
The game isn't designed to support PvP, and using a power like server hopping is essentially god-mode. Its manipulating a broken gaming system not designed to support the way they want to play.
---
That doesnt make you a raider, that makes you an \*sshole.
---
Aren't boss enemies different than legendaries? Bosses are the ones with the crowns, legenaries are the ones with stars. Often times legendaries are also bosses but not always, plus bosses don't drop legendary items.
---
You can toggle between different sorting options.  Default is alphabetical.  Then you have by Weight (Individual item weight, not full stack though).  By Value.  By Spoil.
---
By weight would be more useful it it factored in stack weight, not just item weight.  So you could better identify sources of large amounts of weight.
---
I mean kudos for the devs for addressing this but they're throwing us such a tiny bone. Like are all they doing on the back end is changing the interval number for how often they attack and adjusting the loot tables a little. Doesn't sound like a lot of work, even with the balance/play testing.
---
I also enjoy the game a great deal, I think it‚Äôs better in groups and even not bad solo. Heck I even got it on sale, I think the biggest issue is that it‚Äôs a multiplayer so instead of comparing stories, people are instead going ‚ÄúI want what I don‚Äôt have.‚Äù Also the game feels more constricted in terms of builds, feels like all you hear/see are Melee builds or explosives etc. 
---
They are being careless. There are bugs from Fallout 4 that existed on the release of Fallout 76. Bugs that were fixed by modders for free.
---
&gt; Forget staying inside the vault!
---
Or entering future ones!
---
It's the chems, man. 
---
Are there mods for that?
---
Offline ftw
---
Bethesda employee:  "Its time to write up an ITV."  
---
Bethesda management:  "just address the top post on the 76 reddit, and throw in a plug for the atom shop."
---
Actually.. I kinda agree. Buff their health and damage significantly, though. Maybe have them fly in quick bursts, but don't let them just autisitcally screech half the battle. 
---
No, FO76 would have been much better as PvP only.
---
&gt;Presumably
---
That's the spirit!
---
Just exploits
---
2-5 sound like no big deal. 6 is false.
---
Problem 1 might only be you
---
And 7... nothing a little cussing and swearing won‚Äôt fix.
---
 Oh lord, I can't work a controller. ;) My PC is a games machine, and its served me very well.
---
They are fun and pretty effective, but my petty complaint is that they are so damn big and take up too much of my view!
---
I meant for the dev team....
---
i'll pass it to the team :)
---
The Bobbit üòÇüíï
---
They always mention the larger big fixes in the upcoming patch. This one didn‚Äôt address any.
---
We will have the choice between the two soon.
---
I‚Äôd think something like borderlands
---
"While you‚Äôre at it, take a moment to head to the Atomic Shop, because we‚Äôve added a variety of new items you can pick up using the Atoms you‚Äôve earned by completing challenges, like Black Sunglasses, the VTU Track Suit, the Red Rocket Bed, and more."  
---
pfffffftttttt
---
Agreed 100%
---
Boss loot is referring to crowned enemies, not the SBQ. You get way more than four items from the queen.
---
Imagine Sentinel T-51 Power Armor
---
There's a reason there isn't Legendary Power Armor. It would make alot of things a joke and possibly mandate using Power Armor in the end game even further
---
This dude is bout to get his dick sucked by a video game
---
I‚Äôm not arguing with any of that. The last 5 are when they settled in. It was the first few that started on Tuesday and gradually slid to Thursday. This isn‚Äôt a big deal at all, I was just trying to explain what the dude you were replying to meant and (probably) why you were being downvoted. 
---
True! Another poster mentioned every other patch tends to be smaller, so hopefully our next one will be bigger.
---
No word on items disappearing from inventory.
---
Because you don't want the game to be what it is, even though it's fundamentally has those two things at the game's core.
---
As I was alluding to, it's like saying you'd like the game to be more single-player focused and playable offline. For a game that's designed to be multiplayer and online.
---
The game is designed at its core to having a lack of world permanence and be really light on survival.
---
So gyms are usually farmed out since everyone knows about them and workshops now only produce ore which must be manufactured. 
---
True, its sad to see was Bethesda has become
---
You think?   These idiots are too locked into fallout/fort nite mode to get this shit right though.
---
Need a new dev team at this point tbh.
---
I've killed 2 so far. Both of the spawned next to my camp at the white Springs golf course near one of the entrances. Just keep your distance and you don't have to worry about him damaging you. His ranged attacks are really weak but his melee attack can be damaging depending on your armor
---
I also looked at your post history and saw you aren‚Äôt just railing against the people who complain all the time. It does suck to see people complaining all the time but keep enjoying the game as you have and leave them be, their gripe doesn‚Äôt need to effect the people who like it ;)
---
I think throwing the community a bone along the lines of "and hey we still realize a lot of things are still broken after the last couple patches, we're preparing a comprehensive update promptly to address".
---
Instead they wrapped up with an atomic shop plug.  
---
The problem wasn't the TSE nerf itself.  It was the nerf to TS and E independently.    it was an unforgivable mistake/oversight on Beth's part to ever allow those two mods to appear on the same weapon.  In their botched attempt to fix the mistake they broke any weapon that carried EITHER of those mods when it should have only affected weapons that carried BOTH of those two mods.  
---
bethesda, if you are reading, it is not too late to rectify that mistake.  you can put those weapon effect back where they were prior to the change and just address the TSE issue itself.  You have clearly shown that you can reintroduce old bug so why not reintroduce old capabilities?  
---
I can actually start on a third with Luck of the Draw and short bursts on the plasma.  It's still far from where it needs to be, though.
---
If I have an explosive one will each arc explode?
---
Oh boy if you think fallout 76 is bad or lacking content you are about to be really disappointed with bdo. It lures you in with awesome combat and then stomps and rapes your booty hole with predatory cash shop p2w elements and "convenience" items, the not so optional value pack, terrible rng enhancement system and if you actually stick through it all you are awarded with zero content outside of one shotting groups of enemies for hours on end or maybe you really dump your life into it and 6 months to a year later you can maybe get lucky and upgrade your gear enough to stand a chance in pvp, that is if you picked the right class and it wasn't nerfed into the ground by then.
---
Hateful and disrespect is not the message I was trying to promote and i apologize if that‚Äôs what was received. I‚Äôm a good person and just want everyone to give this game a fair chance. Yes it was released early and yes there‚Äôs been a fuck ton of errors. When I join my character spawns in the dirt and I have to fast travel and walk to my camp. It‚Äôs a hassle I get it. But 76 is what the fans wanted. I mean am I the only one who got eso? To me that game solidified Skyrim as my favorite. They gave the online community a chance and I feel they didn‚Äôt do well. But they learned. If we could all just take a few weeks to see what they (technology) can do I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a mutually beneficial approach we can all take to the game   
---
They're not for anything...
---
&gt;!WestTek disposed of dead super mutant experiments in barrels at Emmett Mountain to maintain secrecy.!&lt;
---
But yeah, check out Oxhorn on YouTube for a full story.
---
Make Phoenix (BoS vendor bot) non-hostile to Watoga Protectrons. It was funny the first 10 times but now it's just silly watching it.
---
Make Molded Plastic just... Plastic.
---
Reduce the armor on everything that's not Scorched or Ghouls, especially Robots. They're just bullet sponges.
---
just anywhere other then a nuke zone would be nice, have had it happen too many times. Whitespring is my first stop if not nuked when I log in to get my 1400 caps a day and if I get DC'd while in there it almost always reloads to a nuked version and I lose all the junk I had on me thanks to a second crash/freeze while trying to respawn elsewhere.
---
Someone did this on the PS4 the other day at the flat woods train station and I thought it was great. Helped me out a lot as I am only a level 23. I did the same with plans I had that did not need. It would be great if there was a central hub for this to happening as well as trading. 
---
I upvoted cause you're cool for doing this, but I very much wanted to downvote that empty inside the vault for being so barren 
---
a scam required malicious intent and foresight.  did they screw up, sure.  but they did not set out to deceive customers.  save the deplorables label for various political opponents.  
---
Pretty sure a bug. I hade level 3 yesterday but it said i had level 4 lock picking skill.
---
They wouldn't be nerfing everything to slow down the game if they had any upcoming content.
---
 I have no idea why people shoot at trash. Do your skills need work? 
---
 Just bash the fucker with something.
---
In my experience with the game most people don't try to pvp, mainly because it's not rewarding, which lines up with the idea that you've connected with these people. However I don't think some vault residents going off the rails and becoming raiders is too crazy. For the last 25 years you didn't have to worry about food, water, or shelter, then you're thrust out into the wasteland which is full of dangerous wildlife. The story has you stumble on failed attempt after failed attempt to carve out a life in the wastes. It's not too much of a stretch for some people to be broken by this experience, plus sure the promos say America's best and brightest, but this is vault tech, I wouldn't put it past them to select some less than completely stable residents to begin with. 
---
i guess if anything it would increase it, since we would have alot more dynamic means to interact with other players, and we could benefit from faction rallies and reap rewards when our faction achieves goals
---
you could still opt to go it alone and be a lone wanderer of course
---
Someone in pacifist mode doesn't mean they won't or can't protect themselves.  Watch out all you PVP bullies some of us walk softly but carry big sticks.
---
And if that's how they ended a fucking patch notes, then bitch away.  but it's not.  It's the fucking community reps tossing out a "here's something the dev team is working on" post.  Just like every single fucking inside the Vault.
---
Companies don't throw good money after bad as a general rule of thumb. The idea that they might invest significantly in fixing a game for a mid to low sized player base is, unfortunately, not realistic.
---
I thought the same thing :)
---
"we‚Äôre discussing your feedback internally"
---
Am I the only one picturing a lone crazy dude sitting in the corner of a room talking to himself? 
---
Will continue to say, vault 76 needs to be sealed we all need to go back insides and wait for them to fix whatever this mess is. Get a new engine. Make a new game. Idk. Idk how games like fallout 4 and Skyrim exist and this isn‚Äôt even a fraction of the quality. HIRE COMMUNITY MODDERS YOU CHEAP PIECES OF SHIT
---
great advice, i will have to make a point to travel down there tonight to check it out!
---
This up comming patch has stuff i expected fixed on week 1, and is still missing the main fixes. Yikes.
---
And lastly, can you make legendaries as spawn as often as Whitespring? What's the point of killing stuff anywhere else?
---
I didn't suggest anything was about burn-out. The idea of a gamer 'locust' is that they play a game, typically multiplayer open world, and then rapidly complete all the content that interests them and move on. 
---
My point is that if someone has played the game as much as these other players have-- which frankly is a shitload of time, they must be playing daily for many hours-- and now they want to leave because they have 'no content', well that's kind of tough shit. No developer I'm aware of could satisfy someone who plays that much. Even WoW, which has a huge and incredibly wealthy development studio behind it, only produces significant new content a few times a year. They've tried to speed it up several times and it just doesn't work.
---
I'm not saying I wouldn't like a fun new dynamic dungeon-- and I hope that's what the locked vaults are. I just don't think it's reasonable to base any kind of criticism or development request on the leavings of players who put in that very high, very unusual amount of time into the game.
---
I won't be touching TES6 or Starfield until after several months of reviews.
---
72 and pc master race? Sometimes life gives me a reason to smile üòÉ
---
Good Stuff and Happy Gaming
---
I created my reddit account to be in favor of this game. I was a big Diablo 2 supporter, I‚Äôm a  if half-life supporter I‚Äôm. A big Bethesda supporter. Don‚Äôt fucking tell me I‚Äôm complaining about the game I adore 
---
Yes, and if you shoot one down *before* it delivers its cargo, the box follows the nuke keycard loot system, unless I am massively misremebering. Will test it next time I hop on to be sure, lord knows I have a pile of tapes going.
---
I'm ok with challenge even a little b.s. I just with the loot was up to par with the challenge for the challenge was reduced to the loot.
---
That's It. I've stuck with the issues and had faith since beta. I'm done. Call me when the game is finished Bethesda. Lesson learned, never buy Bethesda games until Reddit says they are finished and good. 
---
yeah with ya here.. maybe not about the whole gnome thing, but last night i got the single shelf display plan and kinda laughed it like wth even make this plan for? not like i can actually put something up there to display it.
---
Orrrrrrr, maybe, just maybe some of us do not experience ALL of the problems that you do. Are you on PC, or console? Played this game waaay too many hours at this point, and "still hardly playable" is not a term that I could use. There have been a few times I've had an issue, but on the whole it's been pretty solid performance wise. Otherwise I would not have played it for as long as I have to this point.
---
Strongest defense in the game is a stretch, it works on the ai because the ai isn't actually balanced against any amount of armor. The ranged enemies do low damage, high fire rate, and that is the worst type of damage against armor. 
---
Against players that aren't having a laugh it's not worth much.
---
You need extreme amounts of armor to negate the type of armor piercing damage output of players, I'm taking 10k+ and that isn't feasible.
---
Power armor basically turns you into the average bad guy, bunch of armor with no real trick, and you lose to the same weapons and strategy. 
---
level 15 sentinel assassin \[-20weight\] light leather is debatably the best armor in the game, negligible repair cost, all the benefits of having a lot of armor with minimal weight, the value of having a higher defense stat is relatively minor really.
---
That means February 28th. Kind of how the B.E.T.A was "October 2018" and it was the last four days of October.
---
no it doesn't say anywhere whats included in patch 6.
---
So you're the one...
---
Keep doing You, Sir or Madam. 
---
Or tweak the vats aiming % to make it more friendly to targeting while airborne.
---
Watch me ; ) .
---
I‚Äôve been doing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/comments/ao34kh/fallout_strangers/?st=JRV0VYH7&amp;sh=9bcd5d15) 
---
Agreed. Every. Last. Word.
---
/u/riot2156 was talking about ESO being the MMO, not this game
---
I'm calling it at some point this year they'll release mod tool, the ability to have custom servers, and wipe their hands clean of the mess.
---
I don't know why but I thought we would get a little more than we did today. I'm not pissed at them though, because I should have known better.
---
I do regularly protect my stuff, and I'm perfectly fine with normal 1vs1, or Team vs Team, but groups going around Exploiting the screwed up game mechanics to grief lone players, destroying their Camp, Stealing Junk, and collecting their caps when they retaliate, is simply un-defensible.
---
I have the weapons, armor, perks &amp; skills to hold my own against anyone in this game, but it's easy for a group 1/2 my level to grief a lone player at any level when using the game mechanics against them.
---
It is an 'update' on the direction they are taking the game in the next patch. 
---
A melee build with assassins sentinel is pretty bad I agree. I just found a build today that gives you 20+ minutes of stealth boy that I will have to test. Maybe stealth is a good build.
---
I do
---
I‚Äôm not. Read again. 
---
Card ‚Äî I read your last post out of context and I apologize for what I just said I hope you see this 
---
They already got the money that's why :)
---
Indeed.  My post wasn't intended as a catch-all for all complaints.  
---
But when the TSE nerf was announced, the thread was FULL of topics on only nerfing the E or only the S.  The sentiment was quite clear.  
---
And yet they did both, anyway.  Of course they were going to get pissed clients.  
---
As /u/irwinjfinster said above, it was a focus for everyone's anger.  When even the things going right went wrong, the torrent was unleashed.  As someone mostly content with the game I fear the issues caused among the unhappy will affect the game's future development, so I'm interested in seeing even things I don't care about addressed when they're global concerns.
---
Oh god. The pair of albino radscorpians up ahead.  Fighting two of them always was harder than a behemoth 
---
Luck of the draw and the armor version seem like such a waste of points to me. The repair proc seems to be so small I can't even tell how much is actually repaired.
---
SBQ now deals 150% more damage
---
I have three toons. One of which (the healer) is pretty weak by herself. However, it's just a lot of fun to use different play styles and weapons. Go for it!
---
I never said anything about playing offline or single-player; I said people should still be able to play solo, as in, there are other people playing, but you don't team up with them.
---
The game suffers greatly because there is no permanence; this should be remedied by introducing permanence. Lack of permanence is not core to the game; and if I'm wrong and it is core, then the core should be changed in this regard. 
---
Further, I have no problem with my suggestion being a different mode, but making the survival more challenging does not change the core; and again, if I'm wrong about that, I don't care. I firmly believe that these changes are necessary to improve what I consider to be one of the main points of the game: multiplayer.
---
I had this thought as well then remembered that there would proximity issues with putting down your camp. It would be nice for crafters to get together and build a merchant sector.
---
I feel like there has been plenty of times I've played a game for 10 hours in a day but seriously, people bragging about being 700 hours into a game that came out like 87 days ago is insane. Are people playing this game as a full time job? 
---
I also have a feeling that the 10 second timer on scorchbeast spam will get implemented as 0.01 seconds.
---
Ask not for whom the bone bones, it bones for thee, 76.
---
Well, they're not gonna announce everything in the next patch at once. Otherwise what would they put for next week's ITV? The next patch is "later this month" so obviously they would be sprinkling the info along the next few weeks
---
Metro and Far Cry don‚Äôt really have the feel of Fallout, they could fill the post apocalypse itch for a while, but to me at least, they don‚Äôt have the feel that brought me into the Fallout franchise.
---
Okay well I still apologize for my words 
---
I had something weird happen to me last night. First things first, I keep pacifist on all the time and no I don‚Äôt have a workshop claimed at all and neither did my team mates. 
---
I have no clue what happened but my friend, who was in another team was red towards me, we then got swarmed by some glowing ones and during the fight with them I had accidentally killed him. My other friend who was in a team with him came to us and he wasn‚Äôt red at all? He said on his end it said I had attacked the guy I accidentally killed but yet I had pacifist on? 
---
How was I able to kill him if I had pacifist on, why was he red to begin with and why wasn‚Äôt my other friend red towards me since he was in a team with him? 
---
I‚Äôm so glad I quit this game. Bethesda literally isn‚Äôt even trying lol. It‚Äôs been 3 months and no new content or anything even interesting in the patches besides bugs that should‚Äôve been fixed at release 
---
Is it just me or does some food spoil way too fast?
---
I had a bunch of glowing mushroom and brain fungus with over half condition left, maybe 5 or some minutes later they're all gone from my stash.
---
When will all Gun durability be addressed?
---
When will the guns be buffed so they aren't so useless?
---
When will we get more content in the game?
---
When are we going to see changes the community wants not what you Think it wants?
---
With the way the game is balanced to Power Armor and the lack of any meaningful non-combat social interactions, why would someone pay for an overpriced outfit that no one is going to see? Skins in Fortnite, etc work because you want to look cool killing someone or look like your favorite streamer. In FO76, you can color the giant trash can you wear but it's still a giant trash can.
---
[Interesting stealth build] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26jynttkdqI)
---
well it takes time to patch stuff it's not like the devs only need to snap their fingers and the problem is solved  
---
It‚Äôs all good!
---
Ahh cool thanks wish it was atom kids hehe üòã
---
Sad attempt at stalling for time?
---
Filling my hardrive 5 useless Gb at a time 
---
Well they people making Outer Worlds also made Fallout New Vegas which is arguably the last good fallout game. I have a feeling Outer Worlds will be the fallout 4 people actually wanted.
---
Read.
---
Everyone wanted a co-op. I didn't know anyone who wanted pvp prior to this game.
---
Her hair is exactly how hair in the post-apocalypse should look like
---
Oh ya I lost a week straight if my time with skyrim.  Given then I didnt have a family.  Even now if I can get away with it I try to game on a Sunday for 5 hours or so.  But ya in talking regular basis 
---
They will scream less often but I'd expect they will buff each scream by 25% to account for the "downtime".
---
They have posted several lists about issues they are looking into. Which included a lot of these and more that you haven't listed. 
---
And not a single mention about how the amount of time and resources required to take one down are not worth the reward also! But you are correct Bethesda has not once changed something with out secretly changing something else. So I agree if they say they are doing something to help us, then I bet there was something done behind the scenes to make up for it.
---
no more sonic booms?
---
also if ya want resources, if ya follow the river north from the nuka plant theres a good half dozen junk piles you could camp on and set up a junk extractor.. i have three friends camped at three different spots along the river for junk piles, and to my knowledge they have never been messed with as well..
---
although loggin in to those sometimes means youll have to jump servers till you can place your camp.. 
---
i am at the little point with water on 2 sides directly across from the nuke plant and there are i think 3 others i have noticed so far that are close enough to me to cause me to have to jump servers to get my camp placed, but usually not that big a deal.
---
Was that on Xbox?
---
Absolutely true. I'm not much of a melee fighter, I have the skills and the weapons.. but hardly think about grabbing them. Still doesn't make them enjoyable though. 
---
That's exactly what was happening. Surely they were hoping they could annoy me enough that I would hit them back so they could kill me. What kind of loser plays a game just to see how much they can annoy everyone?
---
I don't think this is going to happen, because this game is too casual to anyone care about forming groups to PVP. In survival game, normally yes, you wan't to group up to make looting safer, but in here if you need to loot, you just gonna jump to safe server.
---
And camp, well yeah, most wouldn't even want to deploy it, because unlike from Rust, camp has no real defense purpose. Even with strongest walls and turrets, it doesn't really provide any meaningful defense.
---
They are continuing to vlow off their fan base with empty "we want to hear from you" ams such statements with no type of content to back it
---
Thank you for the correction, I'm guessing then that the other factor to an MMO is questing and grinding for gear. Minecraft does have that, just not in a way that is traditional, but I can see why would not qualify.    
---
*Surprise, A reasonable response to a correction on this thread*
---
If they did decide to add in the functionality, I honestly think the best way to go about it is OCDecorators method, as well, where you would require the junk item as a material instead of certain scrap, but maybe to cut down on menu clutter they could have a "Floor Decoration" object just called "Decoration" where it'd cycle through all your junk instead of separating it into stuff like "Vases", "Stuffed Animals", "Toys", etc. Of course even if they don't want to add in that functionality, I really hope we get mannequins to put outfits on, especially if we get a bunch of different poses so we can "populate" our CAMPs!
---
I like the idea but should be involuntary, maybe a guest book for voluntary). I would like to see who has been at my camp and/or who has destroyed it, it's only fair ..
---
You can find her corpse in one of the cells inside the Capitol building too.  The same room where her interrogation holotape is found.  It doesnt look like the pic above though.  I think it's just a random corpse as it looked different the two times i went through there.  The corpse is named Rosalynn too.
---
They wouldn't need to nerf scortch beasts or the queen if they didnt make the guns so useless in the game
---
Sometimes the enemy scaling is really bizarre. I was looking around Appalachia with my level 14 alt, nobody else was around, and the game threw a level 62 feral ghoul at me. I'm not very good at math but last time I checked 14 is a lot less than 62.
---
Day one or two I made the trek to the black powder museum. Nearly there, I started getting chased down and wrecked by a mothman. 
---
Usually they just fly away though. An interesting but usually useless random event to say the least.
---
That's not the way this works.
---
Its part of the job to deal with trashcans like me LOL. I am a customer, could even go as far as calling myself an investor who is expected to invest my money into the company through ATOM purchases.  I am 100% in my right to be frustrated at the product that I have been given from my purchase.  My request is simply for transparency and better communication(done so in a very frustrated manner none the less). 
---
I honestly think that this Inside the Vault was decent considering it promised that they would try and fix scorchbeasts before adding new stuff since scorchbeasts are one of the most criticized elements of Fallout 76 that said I do agree they could maybe at least tease some PvE content. Like they wouldn't have to set a release date or anything just release a tiny teaser.
---
A placating gesture, nothing more.
---
Is he ghosting you? Poor baby
---
Yeah you aren‚Äôt kidding. Those albinos took quite a few gauss rounds without falling. 
---
No more sonic booms only hadoukens 
---
&gt;IMO people are getting tired of waiting and hoping. Why does Todd not hold a press conference and give us the truth straightforward?
---
That's just not something companies do.  And client impatience is a major issue.  They're not going to come out, after all this trouble, and give a timeline they may not be able to adhere to.  
---
As noted above, the TSE nerf and the Bobbypin weight reversal were just the focus for a product's ongoing failures.  We all expect progress, not regression, in patches.
---
Assuming they even have any estimated release times. I assume their road map is way more vague than that. 
---
"The map isn't half an interesting as fallout 4"
---
Aaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahaaa.... later, gator.
---
Generally a company doesn't make a joke out of one of their flagship brands. And if they do, then they try to fix it. Or sell it off.
---
You didn't have to get it, it was known from day one it would be multiplayer with pvp. PvP is easily avoided also
---
Ive actually been working on thr armor wiki page, but took a break to get more armor plans so that I could give exact stats, not just estimates. I will work on it more later today!
---
Poor show indeed
---
Nice idea but you are not considering the trolls and griefers. Imagine you come back and find your base completely wiped out and they leave you a mean message lol 
---
Should be pretty close to a snap of the fingers with the army of slaves they have working for them. This isn't a one man band or a small indie studio. It's one of the largest organizations in the business, no excuse.
---
correct.  even if every single person in this, or any other FO76 sub, were to boycott the PVP server launch day it would hardly be a blip on the server metrics.  the world is much larger than what reddit represents
---
It's already started. PVP servers are going to be the real deal. I already have discord servers and groups of people who are ready for this.
---
You do realize that PvP servers are coming next month and that everything you said is irrelevant?
---
I leave stuff at Flatwoods 
---
Not mad just as disappointed as a kid learning their favorite tv show was taken off the air. It‚Äôs just sad man
---
How many people did it take?
---
Underrated comment
---
How did she end up as a robot. I always asked this myself. 
---
Plus they say they will continue to monitor and adjust it.  Like I can envision hours long meetings of dozens of Bethesda employees debating whether to make it 9 seconds or 11 seconds, while one guy in the basement stares blankly at a list of 100,000 unresolved bugs.
---
the lack of a detailed plan/roadmap will be the death of this game.
---
without a vision for what they want this game to be, it can't go anywhere. without transparency, the fans wont stick around to find out. i'm still having fun, still racking up hours. as time goes on, though, I feel the creeping anxiety of the finite content available trickling to it's end. I still have brand new, fresh things to do and explore at 300 hours in, but once i go through that, it will be a matter of "how many times can i run a nuke zone, and still want to after?"
---
The prospect of vault raids is enticing, but from a realistic standpoint there is only a small margin of playability that could be added through the 3 vaults alone. my dream for this game is that the map and story continue to change and move forward over time, but with such casual blog updates during such a crucial and conflicted time, I'm concerned if that is even a possibility. I appreciate that Bethesda is trying to listen, but not much is being done with it. Things that have been an issue from BETA are addressed weekly, and one at a time. a blog post identifying a single longstanding issue that fans have been screaming about.
---
so what's the plan? where are we going? is the idea that we are still going to be nuking the queen until the servers are shut down? what is this game going to look like in a year? from everything this game was marketed as, and everything they described they want from it, I understood that the product we are playing now is a foundation. That from this base, vanilla product, they would make a continually changing and living game. with each update and communication, i grow further and further concerned that it is not the case.
---
I have been very supportive of 76, and like i said, I still very much enjoy it. but as optimistic as I've been, I have been increasingly finding myself questioning the intentions for this game. this doubt is undoubtedly spreading throughout the community. it's obvious for some; writing dramatic, winded posts about how everyone needs to know that they are leaving. And there are definitely those that are not as vocal about their concerns. Its a question that *we all* have thought of at some time, guaranteed. *what* will this game be?
---
we *need* to see something, and soon. I appreciate the reassurance from the community managers, saying that a roadmap is coming. But that roadmap is probably the most crucial factor in deciding this game's fate, imo. that timeline, the amount of content, the vision for the future, the timeframe to execute, and Bethesda's overall intentions for this game are going to have to be fucking *on point* or this game is going to start hemorrhaging. the community is still not settled after the disaster that was the last patch. the continued surprise reveals to disappointment with the gaps in between being filled with empty promises and assurances are just not cutting it.
---
here's to hoping for some big news next week. i love this game and would hate to see it fail. we need to see the big picture. what is Fallout 76?
---
I don't bother with PVP, but totally recognize that it is an aspect of the game(zero appeal for me personally with how it has been integrated in to this game, but to each their own).  I haven't gone out and made my build around PVP because that is not what I'm interested in playing, not saying I could not have done so.
---
That said, I'm not going to engage in PVP if someone is actively trying to goad me, clearly they believe they have the advantage so it likely means I lose either way.  I can retaliate and lose caps or scrap or whatever you gain/lose in PVP(I have no idea because I give not a single fuck about playing the game that way), or I can server jump and block them if needed which is inconvenient but not the end of the world.  Engaging them and losing is only going to encourage them though, so what is my incentive to do so? There is no win for myself or anyone else that is not interested in the PVP aspect of the game given that we are not interested in the rewards (caps?) which I understand most players that regularly play this way ensure they don't have on them which is just another disincentive to retaliate.
---
Are you implying that at level 61 you are able to regularly defeat 2 or more people in a team that are leveled up in to the 100's because it seems like most people complaining are being attacked by groups of people.  If so, please share some more on your build, I'm sure many people would be interested.
---
Forget staying inside the vault? Can I go back in the vault till this is all over please?
---
Under rated comment right here!
---
Naw I‚Äôm just saying since it has happened I haven‚Äôt found a single one in over a month. And if that wasn‚Äôt the case I wouldn‚Äôt be upset I‚Äôve quit using my PA entirely for the time being.
---
Bullet 1 is accurate. Bullet 2 isn't. There is a temporary 50% duration increase to the 5% XP boost from Well Rested. Bullet 3 is trolling.
---
The Fallout fanbase in general isn't very welcoming. It's kinda the reason we don't get alot of respect from other communities (not helped by the fact that if you're new and you DARE not play New Vegas as your first game, expect to get mass-reported and downvoted to hell since no other Fallout is good at all period)
---
It's why there should really be a Fallout sub that's more like r/fo76filthycasuals (which IMO is the true 76 sub) and less angsty complaining about how Bethesda 'ruined' the franchise or how NV is the best and why all other games will forever suck
---
I think if u/rapidwiz's suggestion to make the guestlist involuntary was implemented, that would address trolls and griefers to a degree, in that trolls and griefers can be addressed at all, the rascals.
---
You're gonna get a lot of people like LacidOnex, who believe the way they play the game constitutes how the game should be played. 
---
The game doesn't break after level 50. It simply has a limited endgame, and endgame was never what this game (or any other Fallout) was about in the first place. If you're the type of person who wants to pound levels to get the best weapons, then yea, 76 isn't for you. 
---
That aside, there's another sub called Filthy Casuals that is far less cancerous than this sub can be. It's not a bad sub overall, it's just increasingly being polluted by BSers and whiners (as opposed to people with detailed critical points).
---
hey! found this sub!  [It's bear-y nice!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bearhunt/)
---
Read r/fo76[filthycasuals and talk shit. One of our own is not doing well. Continue with the blind hate. Do it. DO IT 
---
I love how some people glance at the ITV and presume the patch is already released...
---
The queen just shouldn't scale to the number of people that show up. It should just always be "scaled" to 8 players, the recommended amount.
---
No mechanic that makes players resent others for joining in on the fun is a good mechanic. People should be happy when other players show up to help out, even if their contribution is minor. 
---
Good point!
---
Addressing one issue out of a hundred. Thanks Bethesda!!!!
---
Yeah true, it could definitely improve the pvp with specific events etc, it would reduce griefing etc I think it would take away from the player creation though, as it goes now, it's literally just setup and settle the wasteland, which Is just an open ended go for it, now we have people setting up the brotherhood, enclave etc
---
I understand griefing sucks, getting your camp destoyed, people bullying players out of a server etc and there are definatly some bugs/exploits to do with teams and pvp. But as a whole I think it does what was intended with how the players saw coming out of the vault, fighting each other for control etc 
---
Eso is actually the best mmo on the market tbh but otherwise ya
---
We feel after all the feedback that super mutants were outperforming other enemy types due to their balanced loot of caps and ammo and gunpowder.  We don't want players to feel compelled to hunt only supermutants.  So we made it so they only give .38 ammo and disinfectant. 
---
Fuck that I'm not giving you guys feedback on what I like to hunt.  
---
Yeah, and other groups will come and do the same. There are leader boards for a reason.
---
It's insulting at this point.
---
My Ghoul Slayer's Tesla Rifle + Pacifist mode is great for tagging enemies at Whitespring/Uranium Fever/Monster Mash/One Violent Night when running with a team or in a large group of other players nearby. The relative lack of insta-kill power is an advantage of sorts when helping lower level folks level up, or being polite around 3 star legendaries so your neighbors get a shot in. Solo? Good for non-glowing ghoul packs while backpedaling, but will switch to better weapons if they start getting in distance too fast. 
---
Choices beyond what you want to scrap and what you want to carry.
---
I can't stand it mate. Looks good, but I just can't get on with it. Too much press X to melee for me. Takes the skill away. Perfect the first person skill based attack systems like Skyrim and fallout 4
---
They typically include sample patch notes and a roughly date of when a patch is going to be released, as in ALL of them have, until today.
---
People have been complaining about Scorch Beast Sonic Attacks for awhile now and Scorch Beasts Queen loot being sucky. 
---
Only explanation i have is that he was wanted, pacifist does worry about wanted players I believe (correct me if I'm wrong). I'd say he was wanted 
---
Well yeah. That‚Äôs what everyone wanted to begin with. Basically like fallout 4 co op. All the had to do was market fallout 76 as a beta trial test to see if what they did worked. Instead they marketed it as the next in the franchise and it turned people the wrong way.
---
Thats preference but i hear ya
---
At this point i will take any motivation to kill the queen again. 
---
Oops, my mistake, confused it with something else, still says what will be included in future patches though (presumably the next few) so that‚Äôs something to consider.
---
PVP isn't for casuals. Prepare yourself.
---
Agreed. I had 1 disconnect last month.
---
1 one. In about 60 hours of play.
---
Please don't put super mutants on there I don't want them to feel compelled to fight them and have them give 42 per war bills as loot...please?
---
Obnoxious bobby pin weight... good god what a whiner.
---
Even at 0.1 they count for next to nothing. You can easily run a 6 hour session with only 10 bobby pins, weighing a whopping 1 pound.
---
People like you just love to complain without paying any attention to how important the actual complaint is.
---
Holy hell, the whinging in that thread. I couldn't even...
---
Vita ex Machina
---
nice, will check it out! thanks for the suggestion!
---
"spinning far kick!!!"
---
I think it would be stupid to have that be the default criteria for what server you join.. perhaps there could be an option for that specifically, but joining a "random server" makes the most sense.
---
What you might benefit from was if we had a "server home", which would have made far more sense.. it just goes against their "how to get away from griefers" logic.
---
It really is that transparent, sad
---
Yep, I also use the overseer's camp along with flatwoods morgantown airport,  and other overseer's caches.
---
The Fallout 76 credits list something like 100 people that worked on QA for this game (https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fallout-76/credits).
---
Don't blame QA for (insert multitude of expletives here) in management not giving devs time to actually fix all the issues they found.
---
Same. Was annoying having to go back through and fight everything again. 
---
&gt;The fact I can't cover my C.A.M.P base with tons of Garden Gnomes
---
&gt;**Garden Gnomes**
---
&gt;#Gnome
---
^(holla ^me ^old ^chum ^echoes ^in ^the ^distance)
---
You need to read that again my dude.
---
If so then the game bugged out on me. It didn‚Äôt show he was wanted. Even when I checked the map. When I hit him it was saying I attacked him and had a wanted bounty but my game never showed I was wanted or anything. Well it‚Äôs what my friend in his team said and he proceeded to kill me
---
lol this isn't an exploit. This is the way of the raider. I don't even need a team. Plus, factory owners are notified. 
---
people are thirsty for content, maybe say something more of the new content that comes? Maybe something more besides the vaults? but no again about something that should have been adjusted from the beginning 
---
If they want people to stop shitting on them maybe they should do something about it.
---
Fix the game, get some actual decent sized fixes out for the issues that have been reported since launch ya know.
---
Or they could cry and moan about people not liking them and there doing there best.
---
Its not good enough, but you guys go ahead keep blowing smoke up there arse's, see what it does to FO5 and ES6, the more you accept crappy products the less effort they will put in as they know they get paid either way.
---
I've come along with a bunch of level 100+ randoms and barely put in any rounds before she dies... It's pretty quick tbh
---
I bought the new far cry. Fo76 is a mess. Hopefully they get their act together 
---
That‚Äôs not the issue at hand. The issue is that in all previous inside the vaults, they specifically mention that numerous bugs were being addressed. I specifically remember them saying ‚Äú150+ bug fixes‚Äù and they didn‚Äôt list them all and that was the most positive feedback this sub has given them. I‚Äôm not saying there won‚Äôt be numerous bug fixes, but if you remember they were the ones that touted transparency and such. Their PR person could of done a much better job to quench the pitchforks and torches. Instead we got a plug for the Atomic Store. 
---
With that aside it sounds like they have categorized the bugs and issues and are addressing them individually because last week was suggestions on events and they addressed the SBQ and will probably fix other events in the patch. Next patch I‚Äôm guessing will be fixing the creatures and such since that‚Äôs the questions they are asking. 
---
This is all a guess, it would be nice to know if this is the workflow they are taking though. 
---
And does that mean that the SBQ changes are the ENTIRETY of the changes coming in patch 6?  No... because this is an Inside the Vault post... and not the fucking patch notes.  If people want to grab the pitchforks and torches and scream for Todd Howard's head on a pike then wait for the ACTUAL patch notes to drop instead of trying to tear a poor community rep a new asshole.
---
I'm applying that to all future games. And any game that includes beta access as a selling point is off the list until I can buy a used copy at game stop
---
Only play in 1st person, but aiming does sometimes stick, in both modes, &amp; seems to happen more when swapping weapons frequently.
---
And that's what I said "unless you have some really good legendary armor pieces". So you think non-legendary armor is better than Power Armor?
---
I am autism. Sorry. Lol
---
 Much easier to just bash em'. I shoot at em' with my Western Revolver rarely but just 'cause I don't use VATS and boom, you are gone, is satisfying.
---
 Anything works on em,' and they will spawn right behind you. Saves ammo and frustration. ;)
---
I think it would be better if a game development company that has created successful single player games for years didn't suddenly decide their games needs to be online ONLY because of piracy. I would have really enjoyed the option to host and play on my own system rather than relying on their servers.
---
There is definitely something going on with the development team - this was very underwhelming and only mentions a tweak to SB's. What about all of the other bugs and exploits? What about new content - that is not pvp?
---
Played FC5 for 500 hrs last year before going back for new runs of FNV, Skyrim, and F4.  Enjoyed it, great shooting, but not as much replay enjoyment for me as Fallout.  Just pre-ordered FCND and will play on release, but will probably be back to F76 at times for the social aspect.  Will be trying to get F76 players to co-op on FCND. (PC)
---
The queen is rather easy to solo as long as she lands.
---
I'd love for harder enemies to have a chance to drop like, 1000 caps now that all plans are available at vendors but some are really expensive. That would actually feel rewarding since caps are more useful than they were before. 
---
Yea, i went into a nuke the other day... came out with about 6 different legendary lead pipes and pipe wrenches...
---
I do this every night after I do character maintenance.
---
Anyone feel this game should have never been made?
---
This was our first console title for FO. And some people not have *as many* issues does not make up for the whole, especially when so many are just casually eating disconnects and constant steps backward. Both of our computers are more than capable and built to handle a game like Fallout and we have played online games in the past.
---
Are you on console? You don't get dc'd, quest bugs, or slow ass loot? How long can you go in the game between bugs? 
---
Because for us and our computer friends, the disconnecting and bugginess meant we ended up losing progression and wasting ammo, weapon condition, aid, and armor condition while trying to level, making the survival mechanics all the more tedious. "Hooray we all disconnected in the middle of shit. Now we have to head back and regroup before we start this shit over again because we were almost done before and we aren't rolling around in enough resources and ammo yet to just keep going. And why the fuck is your carry weight changing with each log in?"
---
I'd be down for PvP servers to just be the Thunderdome for a map. 
---
I noticed that as well he‚Äôs gone quiet since the release of f76
---
Right. The patch isn't for another 3 weeks
---
Hmmm, they do do that. I haven't done any testing but I use Blocker level 3 and I wonder if that mitigates the rads at all. Also, if you can take them on 1v1 and learn their attack patterns it is pretty easy to hit them in-between melee attacks.
---
I‚Äôll be there if your on
---
At this point, I don't know what it will take to get me to play 76 again.
---
Nope, PS4
---
Cool story.
---
Im on now 
---
Well, the old way caps worked, you could server hop to get them to respawn
---
Sexploits?
---
I had my house parked somewhat near a scorchbeast spawn. I wouldn‚Äôt see them regularly but occasionally. I noticed that when I removed my turrets they stopped attacking. They‚Äôd sometimes fly on by. And if they didn‚Äôt fly by, at least you could get away and save your camp. Having turrets seems to make them specifically attack your camp and wreck it. 
---
Add that to the fact that many enemies can spawn inside and the turrets are no use, it starts to make less sense to even have turrets. 
---
What level are you? If below 40/50 I suggest avoid trying to fight him. Ungodly fast, impossible to hit and will wreck you. 
---
Gotta be honest, I said I was going to come back for survival server in March...
---
...that's probably not going to happen.
---
Yep. I can make you a modded one, too, as long as you're on xbox.
---
While the bugs are a pain, its hard to keep on playing the game without additional content. I have leveled up two characters, but I'm playing a lot less because I don't think I can stomach doing Uranium Fever one more time, and the Whitesprings grind has just become boring.
---
There is truth to this. If anything there has only been indications that they will do as little as possible. This is part for course.
---
I have full unyielding with a bloody powerfist. There is no arbor penetration mods for that. Unless you're completely naked, and even then, I doubt you'd even notice any damage. Either your story is bollocks, or there's much more factoring in than you're aware of.
---
These questions about what creatures do you like? Which are to hard to kill or to easy? Which events are fun or not? These are all questions that should have been asked during or right after a TRUE BETA not 2-3 months after the fact. Bethesda is clearly behind the ball with this and is trying so hard to catch up, but with all the bugs and problems I doubt they ever will. Again maybe if people could have played the BETA for more than a few hours it could have also helped some.
---
Did you say hi?
---
 I have been playing FPS games since Doom and she is just cake for me. My present char hunts em' for sport and a new Fissure is always playtime, till its mine.
---
 Did 3 level 80s at The Whitespring a few days ago, that was amazing and I get to eat Scorchbeast for a while. ;)
---
Happened to me too. Just stay there and keep talking to her, eventually she shuts up and takes the fragments.
---
Kind of feels like a band aid on a bullet wound. I mean, not going blind while fighting them will be nice, but going through a billion (yes it‚Äôs exaggerated) rounds of ammo to take down the Queen is still going to be super infuriating. 
---
If you farm white springs for legendary gear or do SBQ very often you will level up much faster. 
---
Just hope no one decides to start kicking walls in lol
---
I've got a BoS base for a camp, and I'd love to have crates, especially functional ones
---
You learn not to care if you have a blind neighbor.
---
Best comment. How about an Uber strong bear or mirluk queen etc?
---
They are listed in the challenge. Just select the challenge and the menu of locations will appear to the right.
---
Mothman Museum
---
Harpers Ferry 
---
Pricketts Fort
---
Not sure about the rest but there is a list if you look at the challenge
---
Did you honestly expect the devs to do some real work?
---
All you have to do is wait until someone nukes the fisure sight make sure there are other people headed there and kill her you don't have to be on a team with people. I have been in 2 groups that killed her and i was playing solo all you have to do is make sure you damage her and you will get the loot and exp as well as complete the quest when she dies. Fyi though if you see someone calling for help stimpack them so they don't have to walk all the way back upon death. If you are close to the nuke zone some players that want to kill her but are really far away might send you a team invite as well my advice is to accept it so they can fast travel to you. The more the merrier right lol.
---
Im looking forward to the 9 minute JuiceHead video about this.
---
"This week's inside the Vault article was kinda short - Fallout 76 news" 
---
i don't think anyone is unappreciative of fixes (even though they've been asked for since day zero).
---
i just think there is a growing concern over what the plan for this game is. it's been almost a whole quarter since launch and Bethesda has been extremely quiet about the future.
---
Tearing into your waiter because your steak was overdone is not behavior I could ever respect.
---
Treating CMs like shit because the devs fuck up is exactly the same thing.
---
They aren't even project managers, aka professional naggers, they are simply a liaison between end users and the development team. I would be surprised if they ever actually even talk to a developer, they likely just report to a team lead or director who passes the gathered information to the development team lead.
---
I‚Äôm level 68, which might seem high for the quest I was doing.  (I stopped doing quests a while back but for CAMP needs i really could use the power armor workbench plan) 
---
Mothman rocketed out of there once I got close enough. He seemed... embarrassed? Lol
---
My idea would be to have them as just decorative camp items until you scrape them so the server doesnt have to keep up with anything stored in them.
---
Why couldn't that have modelled pvp and coop like they did in Destiny?  Or utilized some sort of duel system?
---
You found rare ingredients for the ever elusive mutiviagra chem.
---
Ladies beware!
---
When its me verse a group I usually make caps. I personally engage groups of high levels for pvp
---
New Engine would have been sick.
---
I approached slowly but he got spooked and bolted. Shame.  He was a cute one. 
---
Wow what a low bar set by Bethesda for you. 
---
I was praying it would be a Co-Op version of FO4. Online but not at the same time. Side note had my CAMP destroyed by two guys for the first time yesterday while in pacifist mode. If that‚Äôs enabled they should only allow creatures to destroy the camp along with turrets only attacking creatures.  
---
While you're waiting, why not browse the Atomic store?
---
While I‚Äôve been defending the game for the most part, even I would think defending it further after this underwhelming ITV is crazy.
---
This is so far beyond insane I can't even believe it. 
---
The only two "MAJOR" changes they are talking about are a cooldown on an ability and a loot table change. 
---
These could be fixed in minutes and deployed immediately. What is the hold up? How is this all they have to share? 
---
I‚Äôll never forget how much fun I had playing campaign co-op Halo 3 with three other friends. Great experience.
---
I've noticed that they aren't regenerating like they used to. I usually try to see if they'll heal as many times as they have stars (I feel like they did that in fo4). I wonder if it's someone else that broke
---
Hey Bethesda can we please get a hot fix for RADWORMS, i did like how it buffed you at the start but now its just annoying.
---
Whenever it ends all my stats go haywire, Mutations just dont work anymore, weapons deal less damage, take on rads Waaayyy to fast.
---
please fix this asap :) thankyou.
---
Bethesda already is doing that for solo and coop.
---
Sure, i'll provide the materials, any fluxs required? 
---
When agro‚Äôd they ‚Äòrocket‚Äô straight up and directly back down on your head- even with a maxed out vats build its nearly impossible to hit. 
---
T.H. in a vault suit, with an iron helmet from Skyrim.
---
So now we only get blinded every 10 seconds and still get auto-targeted in stealth? Increasing frequency between attacks doesn't really solve any issue with fighting scorchbeasts, it just makes it suck less. They still aren't fun or worthwhile to fight.
---
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes please.
---
I can't tell if this is serious or a troll post...
---
Ya I don't really farm nuke zones anymore, but I did find that Whitesprings still had its glowing ones without the rads. I picked up 13 1\* legendaries, and none better.
---
This is my method as well, usually at Watoga since its my last stop on the nightly cap run
---
hahaha niceeeee i started a new alt character not too long ago and there were these goofballs outside of the vault bullying a bunch of level 1s...so lame
---
Cash register is a great idea!  I'll start doing the same.  I was using lunch pales and suitcases.

Even if this is the case, and I were to remove all of my turrets, the rest of my situation would have played out the same since the Scorchbeasts were sent to my workshop as the game-given defense wave enemies. The choice I'm given is to let them sack the workshop, or get stunlocked to death and all my shit broken by a bugged series of attacks.
---
The core issue at the heart of this is that it is not fun to fight these damn bats in their current state.
---
I think they did. They knew the game was turds and they acted like it wasnt.
---
How is 6 false? Happens to me a lot. It even tells you, something along the lines of 6 ammo (if currently equipped gun) removed. My only workaround for now is to have melee equipped when picking stuff. 
---
Man, You're really that oblivious? 
---
Be cool if they added some kind of serum that resets all special points. Make it cost a bunch of flux and rare mats to craft but have that option.  
---
/u/Ladydevann \- This can very easily be fixed.  Just have the game check if the current workshop owner is flagged as pacifist.  If so, simply give the workshop to the one who claims it, and don't flag any PVP settings at all.  If they aren't flagged as a pacifist, proceed as normal.
---
And the one's on here saying 'it warns you, suck it up' and such, claiming workshops is also one of the few ways to get plans as rewards easily.  So you are saying, "if you want the same opportunities, open yourself up to being griefed repeatedly."
---
Cool changes but I'm going with the community here and say "That's it?".  I'm not a genious at programming but I know that it doesn't take 2 weeks to add a timer and change loot drops.  I'm sure bug fixes are coming but no listed big bugs?  No other gameplay changes?  No stash upgrade status?  Nothing about bullet spongy enemies?  No mention of Energy Weapon fixes?
---
Like what did they do after last week and then what are they planning on doing this week?  Lots of thumbs up butts by the look of it...
---
I definitely want to be able to play without getting griefed. I'm trying to get Bethesda on the phone right now to change my IGN-- gettin griefed across servers and across characters is getting really really old and annoying and it's making people somewhat afraid to play with me
---
Yes, I picked one up in Watoga I think, or one of the sites near there, at some point in the recent past. sold it off since I'm not using heavy/energy weapons. On PC btw. 
---
Life from the Machine. I was just trying to do a play on words. I don't have an answer on how Rose came to be a personality in that robot.
---
Thanks I'll probably be on  tomorrow as I'm gonna price match at best buy for a 5$ off :D and thanks personally imma go auto pistols build with stealth and crackshot to take down scorch beasts :D
---
I just want planters 
---
He vanished after the rocket. I figured he might be stalking again, but I couldn‚Äôt find him using VATS. I moved on but kept a watchful eye 
---
Wow you sure think highly of yourself and your opinion dontcha chum.
---
Scorch beast queen health scales with the amount of players nearby so it is very possible to fight her alone
---
I get what you're saying completely. I'd love that. I've got tons of wooden boxes stacked around to look like I'm storing junk. Only thing is, I don't believe storing more junk is what concerns Bethesda about server stability. Still love your idea 
---
It's as if they don't care and they like seeing their truest fan base suffer and eventually leave because they're tired of this shit
---
I see stuff like that from time to time and when i do I send a team invite to the low level player. As soon as they accept those asshole dudes turn red and die. 
---
You can already craft brown paper bags to store stuff in to clear stash.
---
Yeah I definitely agree with all of that 100%
---
Just sharing some coping tips I‚Äôd picked up. And hopes that it patch 6 makes them less of a chore. 
---
At vendorbot phoenix or the watoga train station. 
---
Ummmm concur concur concur
---
Lol you're funny. I would like to keep my stuff tho not loss it to the void if I DC or someone decides to pick it up 
---
No. I say this not because I‚Äôm into pvp but rather how buggy and poorly balanced this game is. 
---
They have been pushing decently sized fixes and addressed launch issues and patch related setbacks, they‚Äôve been doing something about it pretty consistently despite some ineptitude along the way.
---
Besides, shitting on them and claiming they don‚Äôt give a damn isn‚Äôt exactly going to motivate a developer when simply pointing out issues that need to be fixed works well enough.
---
just because you give an opinion doesn't make it valuable
---
Well, everyone's experience is subjective.
---
If I want to go on a core run, i try to make sure I'm on a "fresh" server.
---
I decided to try PA on one of my non PA characters the other day, and decided to start looting cores. I found 12 in an hour.
---
I would recommend looking for a "fresh" server by logging into the Enclave bunker, Sugar Grove or Charleston Fire department. If the weights at the fire department are there, or the fans at the bunker or sugar grove are there, you are likely on a pretty "fresh" server.
---
Take your PA off so you don't burn cores on your run, go hit up the bunkers in the mire, Dyer chemical, national radio array, waste disposal workshop, etc.
---
Hit up the static PA spawns like Blackwater mine, Fort defiance, the cranberry bog brotherhood camps etc.
---
Personally it's always been my opinion that when people said they wanted Fallout4 online, that what was meant was co-op play. I'd love to play fallout with my wife and Red Dead 2 too but to do so means you have to deal with pvp etc.
---
Just make it coop! 
---
And Reddit is not your typical player. I know dozens of people who have spent real money, a few over a hundred dollars. Give them a reason to come back and I'm sure they'll spend more.
---
Also, the OP doesn't realize how many die hard fans this game has. They aren't going to just buy whatever new have comes out.. anthem is meh, something I'll probably do while I'm bored waiting for new content.. but the beta was pretty boring honestly. If they put actually good content in fallout I'll definitely be back.
---
Why the OP thinks that players are only capable of playing one game at a time, like they have blinders on.. it makes little sense.
---
This isn't no man's sky, which took a year or two to get that game ever they said it would be.. if fallout delivers something high quality and with a better time table, plenty of people will want to play again.
---
Best example ever- Warframe. Wow has that game changed and polished the last two years I haven't played. Like seriously.. on PS4 at least that game is smooth and beautiful, and too much to do. Too bad it isn't my kind of game, but I'll still give it a go.
---
lol. That is great. Thanks for the find!
---
Highly recommend using both, but keep the commando build and mod the Tesla to an automatic.  I did that by building Tesla's and scrapping them.  Both guns are then covered.  The 10mm sounds great for general utility, but an auto Tesla is great for group gropes like Whitesprings and Uranium Fever; can't beat it for tagging and building gradual damage so that kills are shared.  Having the Tesla on standby with 1000 or so ammo is a good backup if you run out of 10mm ammo, and you are then ready to jump into a group event at short notice. 
---
You don't need any energy perks except what is needed to craft for mod scrapping.
---
I only keep one at my camp but I mostly use it for novelty fun. I keep a static camp and the range is very limited so the artillery is rarely in range for me to use as strategic firepower. 
---
yeah it was pretty funny..when ppl start hitting me..i just get annoyed to the point where i will just run or server hop..your story was good tho..my TSE would really efff ishh up..but i dont really care about PVP at all
---
God damn that's a great idea!
---
The only thing I don't like about that idea, is if for some reason you don't like the new build you've chosen for yourself, you have to buy the serum again to try something else. I think if you could just make a second character while leaving your first alone, you could try something for like an hour, and if you don't like it, you can easily switch back to your main, or delete the new character, and try again with something else.
---
well, it should be, anyway.
---
These tweaks and fixes mentioned today should be able to be done in minutes and deployed immediately. 
---
If they really are worthy of spotlighting and can't be done quickly, the game is doomed. How can we expect them to add real content if adding a cooldown to an already existing monsters ability and adjusting their loot table takes weeks to implement and deploy? 
---
I'm pretty shocked that this is the best they have to communicate with us about, but at this point I shouldn't be. 
---
or claims 
---
Don‚Äôt see why wouldn‚Äôt it be serious. The game doesn‚Äôt encourage you to level past 60ish, where you would theoretically have a full build, assuming no mistakes.
---
Might aswell put that effort on a different character.
---
All the advantages of a second character with none of the work! Lol... Atom shop feature, purchase level boost for a new character only 5000 atoms.
---
There wage is motivation enough no?, there not 7 year old's needing approval are they?
---
I just know that one of the excuses for stash limits is the servers stability which I understand.  I just hate not being able to keep as many weapons as I would like.
---
I stopped playing 2 weeks ago does that count?
---
I always give it to the lowest level on my server 
---
&gt;While you‚Äôre at it, take a moment to head to the Atomic Shop, because we‚Äôve added a variety of new items you can pick up using the Atoms you‚Äôve earned by completing challenges, like Black Sunglasses, the VTU Track Suit, the Red Rocket Bed, and more. 
---
‡≤†_‡≤†
---
Thank you for doing this poll. I participated. I was intrigued in the results as well. 
---
I usually just drop a paper bag of stuff near the vendor bot so people can see it in plain sight.
---
im sure they'll fix it in a few months, and dedicate that week's inside the vault to just that one fix.
---
Nope. You on now?
---
Gt?
---
Stop it or i'll tell mr todd howard and he wont be happy
---
:) 
---
Just trying to be helpful.
---
That‚Äôs.... it?
---
TL;DR for this week:  
---
*Everything burning down around them* 
---
Bethesda:  This is fine. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png
---
scratch that and let's keep trying for a player hub. best practical option.
---
&gt;These could be fixed in minutes and deployed immediately. What is the hold up? How is this all they have to share?
---
How long does it take to decide on the new loot table? Minutes?  Go ahead and spend a few minutes on your loot table and bring it back for us to look at.  
---
What variables regarding SB behaviour are there that are linked to the screech timer?  How many minutes does that take to rewrite or simulate to detect raised issues that we're going to see immediately?  
---
What else are the team working on on an ongoing basis?  Are these the two that were completed first, or the two they prioritised?  
---
One wonders if the sub can ever recover unless Fairy Todd snaps a magic finger and makes all hearts content
---
I see what your saying. I got a character to level 70 something befor I realized I didn't like my build so I started over. Was dealing way more damage on my new one by level 30 and now I'm almost 150.
---
Do they need more crayons?
---
How it should've been put
---
"While you're at it, take a moment to head to the atomic shop, because we've added a variety of pointless and forgettable  new items you can pick up using the free atoms you've earned by completing challenges, [insert pointless item after item] we can't be bothered putting anything useful or nice on because your getting these for free and no one is buying atoms so why should we put time and effort into them"
---
That's the Motherlode side-quest, where the reference is to a more tedious collection process of beacon parts for repair. So the quest already exists, but it's shorter and less tedious to complete.
---
How dare Bethesda have their own R&amp;R week.  
---
I‚Äôd like to check it out. You should charge caps to let people try it 
---
No, limited.
---
crazy that they needed a whole blog post just to tell us that, and that the scorchbeasts will scream less.
---
I don't mind the PvP as a concept, but it should be 100% opt in only. 
---
The hunter/hunted channel seems like a great idea that could have been the method. Another option would be in workshops, let people PvP for ownership. 
---
But outside of a few isolated spots, yeah, the game should be entirely PvE. 
---
Care to elaborate.  That's not how what works?  And then please explain how it does work.  Let's have a conversation here, not just closed statements that don't convey a meaning.
---
Maybe their mish-mash of code is too volatile to really do anything with.
---
If we could still store stuff properly on mules it wouldn't be as big a problem but dupers had to ruin that for us lol
---
I'm fine with Scorchbeasts except when they get stuck in permanent sonic attack mode, but then I'd rather have more Dark Souls enemies. Deathclaws are nowhere near tanky enough, for example, and their rock-throwing attack should be more dangerous. Max level Assaultrons are a fun design and are much more dangerous for a ranged build, although that's partly because you meet them in confined spaces.
---
You can flee a Scorchbeast anyway. At least my recollection of the first 60 levels is that they're a lot easier to run away from than ghouls. Mole Rats and scorpions are impossible to flee, which is weird and annoying.
---
I liked Mole Miners a lot initially but they die too easily at higher levels.
---
I wouldn't blame it on lack of QA, I would blame it on the ones who didn't listened to the QA
---
Every time I hear her voice, it makes me think of Sarah Silverman. 
---
Well, at any rate, it's good to hear that the spam is being addressed. I just hope that I still have people to play with when that update gets pushed.
---
like omg I totally didn't know that
---
Thanks, I'll be sure to pass it along to the dev team.
---
This.  Is a great piece of feedback.
---
Me too! I find interesting weapons that don't fit my main play styles but they're fun. Weapons tab of my stash contains... Perfect storm. :( It's only 6 pounds, it's not as bad as my 6 power armor frames. Definitely can't keep any big guns I like though. 50 pounds off my space for junk is way too much
---
That reminds me.  Super Mutants always used to drop caps, but now some do not.  Intended?
---
Legendary weapons only exist in game as drops or quest rewards. If a vendor is selling them it is because a player sold it to the vendor.
---
I don‚Äôt either and don‚Äôt look for it. In this case though I started the quest a month or so ago I got disconnected in the middle and had traveled there just to do it. I was like I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm gonna start this quest again. Plus with the nerf to the TSE in general I hit harder than I peeps running non heavy TSEs. I run stabilized for the armor pen, plus 40% damage from strength, and the luck heavy guns perk along with it . . . So it worked out well. 
---
&gt;It's at least a 7
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAA
---
*wheeze*
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Extremely underwhelming, looks like the whiners are getting their way and getting a scorchbeast nerf. Lame. Patch not even dropping till later this month? What hell you people doing down there in Austin? Watching too much live music rather than working and fixing this broke game is what it seems like to me. No talk about new content? Brilliant!! Way to keep the players who have been here since beta active and engaged. Tsk tsk 
---
MMMORPG - Micro Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game

Coined by joseph anderson ofc on youtube
---
How nobody thought of this idea during the development of 76 is beyond me. 
---
Wow, this is a great idea.
---
‚ÄúWhatchu doin?‚Äù
---
report him to xbox if he's sending racist shit they will ban him, rule 9 says you should probably delete this post tho
---
I am a sneaky sniper but I always find good melee weapons. Supersledges weight alot tho and I can never keep them
---
Fr
---
Loads fine for me now.
---
So long as dupers stay away from the serums lol
---
yeah i can mod those to bos
---
I defeated a 3 star legendary ghoul the other day and the reward was a bobby pin and some chems. I was truly impressed with the current loot table algorithms of course. :P
---
I just occasionally glance here when I think one might be up, it isn't worth actually waiting for anymore since it seems they are even incapable of analyzing the very data they have and heavily rely on us telling them what we need to make the game great. While I absolutely dig a studio who cares about feedback, questions like "what events are worth a shit?" and "what kinds of enemies should you be fighting" display a total lack of competency to design their own game. I mean shit, we should have new content by now. Quite a few previous editions of inside the vault heavily eluded that we'd have more by now. At this point I have zero faith that even when they do add something, it won't contain enough substance to be worth logging back in. It's massively disappointing, and drives even more disappointment with every inside the vault they produce. 
---
You do know that there's a quest at the lighthouse near vault 76, we're you get to meet the Mothman?
---
Exactly.  I kill a Boss Mole Rat I'm getting 2-4 pieces of shit.  I kill a boss level 80 Supermutant Overlord I'm getting 4 nice rewards.  I kill a regenerating legendary Supermutant I'm getting a starred item plus caps, plus a strong weapon plus aid and ammo.  
---
No issues for me there.  \[PS4\]
---
Maybe they can sell the Fallout brand to Microsoft so Obsidian can make a good Fallout game.

I used to use Ironclad, but switched it to Ghoulish. It's kind of a mystery to me as to how it works, but I die a whole fuck of a lot less with rank 3 Ghoulish than rank 5 Ironclad.
---
Both Watoga vendors have it and the enclave vendor in whitesprings bunker
---
Yeah I have no clue then üòÇ 
---
Maybe they have several items ready to go, but don't want to release them all, but are looking to placate us with our "preference" or close to, for their machinations.
---
u can't craft these
---
They are, check the bethesda blog. Reddit is not their main home, doesn't matter how big of a community it might have
---
damn bro that‚Äôs some good loot i‚Äôve killed a 3* level 68 super mutant and gotten a pipe rifle and some .308
---
Every time I post about the TSE nerf everyone responds, "I don't care about that!"  
---
It's like all the guys getting banned for duping who were only making soup...
---
I hear thaty friend.
---
Depending on what you‚Äôre fighting, the resistance from ironclad might work better, I have a build with all the perks that give resistance outside power Armor and the difference is quite noticeable. Life giver is a flat bonus so if you use power Armor that could be the better option.
---
So uhh just throwing it out there, anyone else think they've just left a skeleton crew behind to pick up the pieces of the game while the rest of them work on newer titles ala Battlefront 2?
---
Well the burden of proof is on the person making the accusation. Opinion isn‚Äôt sufficient grounds for the claim.  Have fun proving your case and report back with your results. 
---
And thanks for the downvote!  
---
Actually you are not correct.  The first M in MMO is an adjective to describe the second M.          
---
        
---
First M is MassiveLY.          
---
second M is Multiplayer.  
---
As a long time Bethesda and Fallout fan, this breaks my heart. I wanted you to succeed, I wanted you to be fun, I wanted you to make money by providing us with a fun game. Instead we get something that makes Blizzard's Diablo Immortal look like a better investment. *sigh*
---
On pure comparison I find live giver being better than ironclad, cause it works in PA too.
---
But totally I think both are not worth the points.
---
I actually run 4 points in endurance 1 for Radicool and 3 for fireproof what's actually giving explo resistance too, due to more and more PvP griefers 
---
I'd like to see someone craft 1200 knuckles and put them in their stash just for laughs
---
Bethesda: "we're adding human/ghoul NPC's and living factions with quests and new plotlines"
---
that's literally all they have to say. 
---
They are making it really really hard to love the game. Had it not been for the Fallout name i would wonder where this game be right now. They keep asking for feedback. But i have seen mountains of it here every day in long details. Some of them gave unreal ideas regarding improvements and feedback to both enemies and possible ways of handling their rewards.
---
If they cannot deliver content then they need to give us private servers and modding support so we can just do it ourselves.
---
I was expecting this one to reveal some of the pve content they were working on. Since the last one was focused on the pvp content they have in the pipeline. 
---
Here‚Äôs a problem. I read a plan and lost the entire stack of that plan. be mindful of that and don‚Äôt let it happen to you.
---
i think you're missing the point.
---
you're right, these blogs don't feature the full patch notes (even though they specifically said weeks ago that they will be doing exactly that).
---
the point though, is that this blog doesn't list much of anything. it lists a couple updates to two enemies and tries to pass it off as the weekly update (of information). this is on the heels of a controversial and overall poor patch that shook the player base, which was met by mostly silence from Bethesda.
---
Sure, its hyperbole for people to say "there was literally nothing in this post," but for the one real piece of communication we get weekly, there was definitely not enough. especially with the state of the game 1/4th of a year in.
---
Well not right now im busy at the moment. Gamertag is: DefiantBranch86. I have 500 or so caps ( i dont remember the exact amount) I can give you for the guns plus the materials.
---
Yes!    
---
Perhaps enhance this by dropping common, low level stuff in the Overseer cache or the med box nearby in Flatwoods.  I know it's out of the way, but most of us at Watoga don't need the simple, easy things, any more.
---
You know what they say...opinions are like assholes.  Everyone has one and most of them stink. 
---
Definitely report him to Bethesda immediately
---
Is there a significant difference in the amount of rounds that land on a target when you use that many? I‚Äôve considered breaking down my settlement for a mobile camp built purely for firepower and I am curious how effective it is. Are you able to quickly set and deploy the weapons? I assume it can all be placed in two platforms. 
---
Acknowledgement does not imply personal investment.
---
I'm sorry that you cannot grasp basic human interaction concepts. 
---
This!!
---
I think that was a major flaw in this game. I know they were in a spot, that is a lot of their player base is focused on a single player experience.
---
It would have been nice to see them not try to play to both sides. Either make a single player game or a multiplayer one.
---
That's fine. I can come to you if you're busy busy in a server
---
Gt repsycholer 
---
100% they should have embraced coop completely and simply NOT done Pvp at all.
---
Have a grp finder function with some instanced content and made a few vaults that act like a traditional dungeon you see in most MMOs. 
---
Working with others not against was what most of the community wanted.
---
Beth where either completely out of touch with thier fan base or said FU to them we know better.
---
Griefers will deliver the negative feedback in the wrong way.
---
They should have went all in one way or the other.   They tried to mix the too and it just doesn't work.  I think the game would work great coop only or great as a pvp focused open world but either would be better than what the game is. IMHO.
---
I welcome this so I can transfer stuff to my PVP character without having to worry about being attacked. Good idea OP. I grief all day in PVP servers then hop over to the PVE servers to refill ammo and AP regen items.
---
Well that makes it easier.
---
This community is never happy we want more communication oh we will release a weekly blog post no we damnd a detailed resume for each person working on this game and we will decide who works on it this week 
---
Nah, that's the plain Gatling Laser. The Ultracite Gatling Laser is a different weapon, and much rarer. Had one drop from the queen once or twice but I'm not sure if the plans ever drop. 
---
If like my carry weight to not freak the fuck out anytime I fast travel. I seem to have 450 pounds of carry weight when I first log in, then if I fast travel it drops to 325. Really fucks me some times. Also, fix the damn "stuck in combat" shit after the latest patch. I can fast travel to a new place and be stuck in caution for HOURS, with nothing around me. Only fix I've found is server hopping.
---
Piling junk around Danse's feet so he has to wade through it...
---
They would probably get banned for crafting that many lol I do know of someone that held onto like 300 pounds of inert flux thinking it had a use.
---
No word on the botched carry weight system. 
---
I do not get disconnected usually. Other than  an odd stretch in early January or late December I was getting a good amount of disconnects for about a weeks time. Nothing more than the occasional one before and since that patch that fixed it. On PS4 btw. I did install a sshd, but doubt that it would make that night/day of a difference. Quest bugs? Occasionally. Can't finish Coming to Fruition at the moment, other than that? No, not really. Slow ass loot? Only ever really experienced this at all during sbq event, which could definitely use some tuning. Event seems to push the game to it's limits and beyond resource wise. Generally though I can go MOST (not all) nights bug/glitch free.  
---
TBH, I have only been attacked once, when I was around level 6 or something, 2 guys in power armor attacking me, not sure what they thought they'd be able to get from a player that low level?  All the scrap wood I had gathered? Lol
---
Since then(Level 48 now), I have not had any issues with other players(had my base shot up once, because I left it locked I think, have left it open ever since with no issues). I don't go out looking for them but when I do run in to them(inevitable at Whitesprings) they have all been neutral or helpful, and I don't go out of my way to avoid them unless they are wanted.
---
they could bind it to the character and limit it to 1 allowed per character inventory at a time
---
I also saw myself learn BOS Combat Armor Legs while scrapping lots of combat armor that I farmed hours for, but the mod does not appear in my list.
---
I can also add my experience of zero sightings of BOS Combat armor plans or Dense Combat Chest Plan since update.
---
Finishing my BOS set was big on my list - anyone on PC have BOS legs they‚Äôd apply for me? Have mats and caps!
---
Report his GT to XBox. Especially if he's dumb enough to send racist/hateful messages.
---
You need to remove his gamertag from your post
---
Possibly but I think I‚Äôd be ok with that. It would be more challenge and less tedium. 
---
This message was for the roughly 2 dozen people still playing fo76 
---
Only saw one at a vendor someone clearly sold it as it was a 3 star. Only problem is i cant make ammo for it as ive never got the plan.
---
Teddy bears!
---
To make people like you mad mostly. I know my username checks out.
---
The game can still be played solo and be fun, getting companions isnt required for you to finish the game. 
---
They already do. At least a guestbook would provide a positive counter to griefer actions.
---
I have a new goal. I'm going to create a character whose only purpose is to craft and stash knuckles.
---
He literally said in his second post he still hopes against hope this game is good, which to me implies pretty clearly that he doesn't hate it.
---
You're just taking criticism about this game *way* too personally dude.
---
I mean if we want to really unpack my joke shit post we can.
---
For starters why are they asking for more feedback on creatures when that is literally the least of their current worries?
---
Second, there are countless other things people have left feedback for that haven't been changed/fixed.  It seems pretty dubious to ask for more on non-critical topics.
---
That's a good idea.

It's fun to make you mad. I'm that pathetic. My username checks out.
---
It's a shame it's not cross platform really, at least for pve type stuff. 
---
Do left leather legs. A stash of only left shose 
---
The last patch was met by mostly silence?  The ENTIRE Inside the Vault for last week was a breakdown explaining what had caused many of the unintended bugs and the reasoning behind their other balance changes.
---
That‚Äôs because most people who are interested in PVP stopped playing this game when they realized how shit the system is.

The queen? The only things ive gotten from her are ultracite power armor explosive vents.
---
One of many maybe. Everyone I play/played with was hyped for a PvP Fallout and we all hope they get it right when they implement it into Survival Mode.
---
The three times I've seen him in the wild like that, he was always on a rocky ledge like that (once in the Forest, once in the Toxic Valley, and once in the Savage Divide). Every time I climb a hill like that I expect to see him, . . . have been disappointed for weeks now.
---
I love to search for camps like this. Good to know where people are hiding their beloved camps.
---
Ok thanks
---
That somehow "PvP games" are what "PvP people" should go play instead. First, there's no such thing as a PvP game. There's battle Royal kind of games, but that's not really just PvP. Or I should say, there's no specific kind of game or genre that "PvP players" should be playing *instead* of fallout.
---
Secondly, your point is already moot, PvP servers are coming next month- anyone actually interested in PvP will likely go play there.
---
Third, you can't just tell people what to do. Like the OP you can suggest pve servers, but it's their game, not yours. Plus, seeing as they are adding full on PvP servers.. like I said. It's a moot point.
---
It's sad to see so many posts about "pve servers" make it to the front page when adding actual PvP servers is going to address the issue 98% of the time. It's like the people in this sub have a vacuum for a brain, they just upvote stupid shit when clearly they have no idea what's going on.
---
Or more likely, people are just looking for shit to whine and complain about knowing damn well that PvP servers are coming.. what are they going to do for three weeks? Bitch and complain and treat Bethesda like they're your personal bitch who needs to just do whatever the hive mind says.
---
And idea for how to make some of the perks into passive abilities that are active all the time and don't have to be slotted.   Why should lockpicking and hacker take up slots when it is so situational.  It's stupid to have to be swapping it back and forth.  I have the ability, just let me use it.    
---
Is that simple enough for you?
---
That will be more difficult, I'll need to have a better range of materials. Challenge accepted! I'm naming the character knuckles though. Lol
---
Good thing I bought that 1tb SSD for all these patches...
---
Im not attacking the CM here.  LadyDevann is the only employee even reaching out to us and im sympathizing cuz they have a shitty job... They cant talk us about a majority of the stuff we ask.... They probably dont even know the answers... and from what is given to us on patch day, it seems like what the CM's give the devs in terms of community feedback, is tossed aside.  
---
I killed one next to the red rocket in flatwoods around level 20something. 200 hours later i've yet to encounter him again.
---
Yeah scouts are a thing.
---
No "maybe." Its got to be a tangled mess.
---
Lol keep us updated on your progress 
---
plenty of games have sustained communities longer than this game.  
---
So, I'm fairly new and screwed up my build pretty bad. Does anyone know if there are plans to revamp the respec system? It looks pretty tedious in its current state, but at the same time I'd rather not level up a new character to 30 and lose all my plans and caps...it's kind of killed my drive to keep playing.
---
I enjoy the pvp honestly.
---
I think it‚Äôs more that they didn‚Äôt do either one well. I don‚Äôt really want to team up to do story missions because I want to be able to take my time and read/listen to every holotape. I don‚Äôt want to fight anyone because it‚Äôs unbalanced and unfun.
---
Borderlands style fallout 4 is what I wanted. 
---
Instead we got... what they gave us.  
---
I've leveled seven characters into the 70s. (Yes, I had to delete a couple to play the content again; you can only have five characters at once.)
---
The game is fun (other than the bugs and connectivity nightmares), but the story missions are finally getting old, unpalatable even. If they add more content, how can they possibly add enough to get me "back" into the game? What does "back" even look like? After I complete the new content on all characters, what's to stick around for?
---
Do they imagine that any new segment of content will keep me around long enough to tempt me to buy atoms with cash? That is the only new stuff they're coming out with right now, the microtransactions. Boo!
---
It's just an ORPG. Online Role Playing Game.
---
Very borderlands-ish.
---
I'm solidly PVE. I play this game with my daughter. We don't want to deal with PVP. 
---
I just wish they'd have released the servers so I could set up a private server for my friends and family and not deal with any of the dupers, connection issues, etc.
---
 I run 5 levels of Ironclad and 3 of Fireproof. In BOS Heavy Combat with Dense on the chest explosions do nothing to me. I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet with several in Explosive and suffer no damage at all.
---
 Scorchbeasts screeching does nothing and I am enjoying it a lot.
---
I will post pictures later tonight
---
It's actually Massively Multiplayer, Online, not "Massive, Multiplayer, Online."
---
The massively refers to the fact that it is massively multiplayer, aka not just a 64 person server.  I don't think there is a hard limit where it becomes "massively" but I've never seen it applied to a game whose servers couldn't handle at least 1000 concurrent players.
---
The size of the game/map is irrelevant.
---
You have triggered me. Still, this is stupid. We get it. You love this game or hate it. Just play it. I guess I'm waiting for a decent conversation not just thoughts on how someone feels. 
---
AA is useless on energy weapons right now. The effect only reduces DR and not ER
---
JFC, no doubt. In any FO game I always look for other vaults. I've never been so disappointed in that quest until now..
---
My favorite so far would have to be when I, dressed up as Manta Man, came upon a fellow player dressed as The Silver Shroud and we joked with one another in character and seeing me and him beside each other in costume really looks awesome.
---
They did nerf resource sustain a lot in the Morrowind update so you can't just spam abilities forever, and buffed non-ability weapon attacks so people would use them more.
---
The group content, pvp, and world bosses all take skill. The single-player story quests that make up 80-90% of the game do not. First-person mode is still pretty difficult compared to third.
---
Those "questions" are space-filler. Feedback get tossed in a bin.
---
I always thought it would be cool if each fissure site triggered a different boss fight. Then they could just keep adding fissures sites, or ‚Äúoh look a weird fissure thing‚Äù events. And change frequency of certain ones popping up with those having better/rarer loot. 
---
Yeah, I had a bunch of that today. To add a kick in the balls, there were two 3* Legendaries that I killed, and their bodies went "poof". Grinding legendaries is all I have left to do, and now even that's fucked up.
---
Is there a map of the cap stashes anywhere? 
---
No to all of that. My camp is far out in the woods to the north. I don't even hold workshops anymore. I'm on xbox, don't know if you are as well. I would say it's because im female but it happens just as much to my so. I'm glad it's not your experience but, unfortunately it is mine. 
---
You have to find bags of chlorine and droo them into the hot tubs for them to work. 
---
Otherwise its just gross.
---
Nothing on energy weapons, nothing on normal explosives being nerfed to uselessness, nothing on any bug fixes. Underwhelming is a understatement...  
---
Yeah I'm totally okay with that. SBs might as well be giant flying mosquitos right now. 
---
So, their update is "we're going to change a few values in the CK?" I mean, it may be more involved than that, but mentioning two things that don't take a lot of effort to adjust seems pretty pointless. On top of that, asking for feedback when there are threads full of feedback on *serious* issues in the game already, as well as plugging the Atom Shop instead of providing any more info is just ridiculous, IMO.
---
I'm really torn between "they really need to post updates more often" and "if they're updates like this, why bother?"
---
Its a generator that powers things at camp and produces 100 power, its useable
---
yikes need to find a dude player!
---
Agreed. I wish the adventure mode was. Hardly any PvP stuff takes place in adventure... And its not like its a fast twitch shooter where a mouse makes a huge difference.
---
Who got banned?
---
Thanks! I just checked as well. Looks like it's back up.
---
If you press tab (assuming PC) while in build mode that'll put you in modify mode. They you can attach wires by pressing spacebar.
---
All the things they didn't discuss were deafening here. I'm going to try to be optimistic and believe it is because they haven't yet figured out how to respond or what they want to do. Fixing the loot table would be amazing if they actually made more viable weapons for anyone not wanting to go melee. 
---
Her face annoys me because I hear the voice behind it. 
---
DAMN IT ROSE I'VE DONE ENOUGH FOR YOU, GIMME REWARDS
---
Seriously, playing games a lot makes sense to me, but playing 7 hours a day literally every single day for months seems absolutely crazy. This isn't even a game like dota or hearthstone or something where you are playing other people, are people like waking up at 6am to put a day in the office just fighting scorchbeasts in a loop? 
---
I don't care about detailed patch notes in ITV, but I am alarmed at how they are fixated on keeping scorchbeasts as the "deadliest" denizens in Appalachia.  Have they even fought one?  Scorchbeasts stop being scary or interesting after you've killed maybe 2 of them, and instead just become annoying flying seizures that cost more in ammo/repairs to kill than they are ever worth in loot.  They're basically flying server hops.  Bethesda should stop cramming reskinned dragons down our faces storyline be damned, and give us fun interesting enemies like real, terrifying deathclaws.  I'd tell them directly but of course their forums are down
---
The generator that adds 100 energy? 
---
The basic way is to attach a wire from whatever you want it to send power to.
---
Yes they were.
---
Go to ‚Äòmodify‚Äô mode under camp crafting, look at top left of generator and press ‚Äòattach wire‚Äô then look at equipment you want to power and click ‚Äòattach cable‚Äô. (Y on Xbox) üëçüèª
---
I really tried playing this game as a stealthy gun nut.
---
 I have now quit and returned to F04 and Skyrim. At least the crahses will be due to my inability to mod properly lol.
---
Click report from his message is a guaranteed com ban
---
There has been hundreds of nerfs no one ever asked for, so while player requests might have been added to the development schedule, it sure as hell isn‚Äôt anywhere even remotely close to being a priority. I have to agree with others stating that very few requests actually seem to come through. I also understand things take time, but it‚Äôs been months and several updates has been released, all of which seem to be in favor of the extreme minority of players, such as PVP or nerfing everything to the point where the game is becomming all about never-ending grinding.
---
I can personally say I loved this game like crazy at release, but every update that has dropped has been working against what made it fun.
---
She can. I‚Äôve got both of mine from the queen.
---
The dailies for Camden park only trigger when you are in the ash heap area. So if you are by Watoga for example it won‚Äôt show up when you log in, but if you walk or fast travel to the ash heap region one of the dailies will trigger. However as others have pointed out if you disconnect once it triggers, but before you complete it you can‚Äôt get it to trigger again until the next day. 
---
Well, I was never referring to you in my comments anyway. I didn't find your original comment meeting the behavior I'm referencing here. I'm just referring to behavior I've seen in this entire sub recently.
---
Oh please, oh please, oh please...

Yeah, even around level 20 I just find those fights more tedious than anything.

Man, the people on this sub act like programming is as easy as typing "fix all bugs" into the code
---
I'm hoping they kept the other vaults in their pockets incase people weren't a fan of the no npc thing
---
if that were to happen the consoles will explode in the face to their owners xd 
---
And adding that will bring back six seemingly unrelated bugs.
---
How you just read devs' minds to know what they did and didn't think about is beyond me.
---
I could have sworn that suitcases were listed as 0/0 weight. What is the weight limit?

Outerworlds, if this game is even still going, will be the death nail to this mess.

Head south from Pickett's Fort, you can bag three locations in 5 minutrs from there, the fort, cemetery and monument
---
Ummmm okay, not sure why this announcement is needed, bounce out. I've left so many reedits before without making a post about it.
---
that's fair, though arguably they should have been transparent without the forced push of backlash.
---
nonetheless, that doesn't change the fact that these blog updates continue to decline in quality. the fact that last week's blog was dedicated to explaining issues with the last patch means that there should have been more to update us with this week. im not berating Bethesda, but more and more of us are growing concerned about the direction this game is going in. at a time of such uncertainty, I don't think that stretching two fixes into an entire blog is the route they should be taking.
---
I have been a lot happier with my camps since I stopped using turrets. Enemies ignore me *and* I have more build space.
---
This should not be the case.
---
I'm in, I'll bring the appetizers...possum jerky with some  glowing crab legs work?
---
It's an interesting idea and not beyond belief. My main counter argument would be lore. Historically Vault-Tec has only had a few control vaults,  and generally pretty spread out.  It would be pretty extreme for them to have numerous control vaults in one state like that. 
---
Not a bad idea, and plausible by Bethesda standards, for sure.
---
I personally hope that they introduce NPC'S and more narrative with each vault opening. 
---
Checking back next year. Got it. 
---
I'm alarmed that people still bother killing them when they don't need to.  If you don't want to kill a Scorchbeast then don't.  You can hide from them, you can lure them into another enemy so they change targets, you can even just flat out run away from them.  Outside of defending your base or situations where you can't run like the SBQ there's no reason you should even fight them.
---
&gt;Think of it as the teaser before the patch just highlighting a few things.
---
Just like last time. Inside the Vault: "We're re-balancing TSEs" Actual Patch: "We're nerfing everything we can think of and resurrecting a ton of old bugs."
---
Wish pvp only worked like the hunter/hunted option. Or if you find someone in the wild, they both agree to a duel (like a trade request) and both players get a timed countdown to get prepped. 
---
I usually fast travel to Camden. The daily sometimes pops up, but recently I haven't had any luck. Whereabouts do you fast travel to in the ash heap that triggers it?
---
Really? We find peoples camps every night to check out builds. Must not be very good at finding stuff if ya have a hard time finding camps..
---
Easy access to resources/resource nodes = houses.. pretty popular maps already pin pointing all resource nodes in the game = road maps to houses of all kinds..
---
Mines not hidden, plain sight and well lit it cant be missed from someone fast traveling to nuka cola plant. If you playin a raider to grief via destroying and causing resource loss ya realize all it takes is 2 or 3 server jumps and base is repaired no cost right? 
---
Got a friend i run with finds 4 or more houses a night to go stare in their window to make them feel uncomfortable in the 2 or 3 hours she plays a night. Actively looking ive seen her find 15 houses in one evening.. 
---
Evidently ya need to step up your stalkin game lol
---
I find that online pve games that also have pvp are always balanced around pvp, and thus pve balance suffers. I think this game should have been co-op only in open world. If they want to add a separate pvp mode or arena, it should have its own separate stats and be balanced separately from pve. 
---
I‚Äôd even dare suggest that a pvp arena have default weapons and armor to choose from so your success is based purely on skill and build choice rather than level and luck of the drop. 
---
But that‚Äôs not going to happen and probably can‚Äôt happen even if everyone liked the idea. 
---
Just shoot me a message 
---
Wow what a meatless bunch of crap.

Translation:

"We are minimally changing an annoying feature 3 months after people started complaining about it....and again looking at the SBQ loot for a future patch.  No promises.

But we need you to repeat all the feedback you have been giving us for the past 3 months cause we just were not listening and truthfully still are not but we want the community to feel engaged!"

i guess that implies that the scream never had a set limit to prevent the constant spamming.

I don‚Äôt think I would see him as often I do if I weren‚Äôt such a VATS whore 
---
Christ this sub is so reactionary. Get a grip people.
---
The developers made a co op game with some PVP elements.
---
The suits wanted Fortnite.  They wanted the sweet teen atom store bucks, but had to reevaluate.
---
I'm 100% convinced the suits at Zenimax tried to kill this game.  All the meatspace problems have been business unit problems, and the schizophrenic game design smells of game-of-the-week meddling.
---
Ahh, well it sure felt that way HAHAH no worries. 
---
Ideally I run 12 points with Critical Savvy, Better Criticals, Four Leaf Clover and Bloody Mess though the last one isn't necessary. However,my luck perks are typically screwed up because of 5 perk points allocated to mutations. I avoided Grim Reaper and Psychopath because after testing they were the least useful of the VATS perks. I don't use pharma pharma because I'm always swimming in stims and radaway without it. Also, tormentor is pretty useless because you kill things in just a couple hits with all the crits you can spam.
---
Boo 
---
I made the [same suggestion](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/an6ibx/suggestion_bulk_item_pallets/) a few days ago but will gladly upvote your version. Here's what I was suggesting:
---
&gt;Just a quick idea for a way to free up some stash space without having to tweak databases, modify the inventory code, or do any kind of deep modifications. Add a "Pallet" item for each kind of scrapped junk that is a placeable item for your C.A.M.P. that costs 27 (3x3x3) of the bulk version of its material and, when scrapped, gives the same 27 bulk items back. Make it the size and shape of a pallet, stackable on itself, and (to deter griefers) make it able to be repaired for 1 of its material or some wood rather than a percent of the construction cost.
---
&gt;Then we can store as much scrap as we can fit in our bases, it would add a level of verisimilitude in that we can physically see the tons of material we have laying around, and it would free up stash space and server load at the same time.
---
Random invites in a zone I‚Äôll accept all the time. But otherwise I usually only accept an invite if I actually see the player
---
The description is wrong. It is a free energy generator.
---
There are people working on it?
---
 What is this stun lock you speak of? I hunt em' for sport and don't encounter this. Now I'm well equipped, but they don't stun me at all.
---
 Hiding in a place is kinda suicide if you don't have a ass load of stim packs. The poison gas you run from, can't do that inside, and the rest don't do shit. Hell a level 80 does not even hit very hard physically.
---
I go to the Lewisburg Station or the bot stop next to it if there is an enclave event going on. I have yet to travel there for the first time in a day and not have the daily pop up. Generally I am traveling there from either white springs or the R&amp;D raider station. 
---
I like this. I proved it by upvoting. 
---
I think the term you meant was sharts. 
---
I haven't looked into the factions yet, but I do like the sound of launching nukes. 
---
Co-op ala Borderlands. No 20 people per server. Still have npc‚Äôs with stories  I don‚Äôt see how they looked this far more viable, less complicated option over. 
---
I doesn't bother me, get gud
---
It's just something tangible to illustrate how they seem to have gone backwards with the game. There are probably a lot of other things that got rolled back/broke as well but the booby pins is an easy example to point to. 
---
Yeah we have the same idea basically.  Maybe if enough people post stuff like this bugthezda might hear us..  lol
---
Additional boss fights + loot with new(useful) legendary effects that can only be attained on the loot from those bosses. Which will have the ability to roll 1-3 additional perks like normal legendaries. 
---
Happened to me, too. When it was not bugged, the 3\* legendary monsters didn't have any legendary loot.
---
Evidently I do need to step my stalking game up. Also not many people know about the camp server switch trick. I've used that one for a while now. The fun isn't realizing they are going to re-build their camp for free, it's destroying it in general. 
---
The game makes you become a general in the Enclave in order to launch nukes. And we love to launch nukes so... yeah.

"Later this month."

That's....that's it?...;_;

For my VATS crit build, action boy and concentrated fire are a must. I switch out to commando for scorch beasts and a level 50 is dead in half a mag with stealth.

Bookmark this link, might save you looking like the fool, or search the forum next time, both would have solved your question.

Yeah I'm not sure why the perk card system seems unpopular because to me it's the easiest I've seen in any modern RPG. I thought switching Starched Genes on and off every time I used Radaway would be a huge headache but it couldn't be easier.

It‚Äôs just a pain in the ass to not be able to melee in the air. I should be able to rocket into the air and VATS melee the scortchbeasts. They rarely land and i like melee. If we got a flying+shooting power armor, a solution would present itself
---
I stopped playing last patch. I left it installed on the advice of my wife. I have no intention of starting it again until it becomes obvious that fixing the game is even half as important as updating the atom shop. I believe I had 495 hours played across five characters when I stopped. 
---
My least favorite enemies are the bug and glitch hordes that plague Appalachia
---
The SBQ should be the source for 4 star or even 5 star gear....given how hard she is now to kill and the overwhelming amount of resources it take now.
---
Ammo, stim,  water and food...takes a lot to fight a long battle like that.
---
All for an 8th copy of Plan: Explosive vents, and enough Flux to make 50 prime ammo!
---
I am all for people playing PVP but I think you should be able to switch that off and not be able to hurt any other players or be hurt by any other players.  Pacifist mode doesn‚Äôt work as well as I think it should. I would like a complete shutdown to be hurt by or hurt other people.
---
I've heard people mention Fallout multiplayer in the past and I always envisioned 2-3 player co-op. I never envisioned pvp survival.
---
I just hate having to micromanage stash and throw so many nice legendaries away because storing gear takes up way to much space.
---
Very articulate response sir. You put my thoughts into words. I love the fallout world.  I love lots of things about this game. But it seems Bethesda is being obtuse.
---
 Thanks again for the great write up!
---
Damn, I'm feeling vindicated as fuck.
---
I've been saying all they need to do is add a 10 second cooldown to sonic scream across multiple threads.
---
I've also complained about Gulpers and the fact that they can't be crippled, regenerate health, have no armor making armor pen useless and seemingly have as much health as SBs. 
---
The creature survey and the exact change to SBs I've been calling for is making me think Bethesda is following me on here (I know this can't be true).
---
It absolutely doesn't fare well. The Anthem demo was way better than I expected and I am stoked for that game now. If all we get is some half-baked idea like this president thing I keep reading about, there's no way I'm coming back for that. 
---
Blueprint your base. If it gets wrecked move your camp. When you move it everything will be repaired. Much cheaper to pay the cap cost of moving the camp than the cost of repairing the generator and/or decon shower. Quick word of advise on the blueprinting though. Just blueprint the main camp. If you are by water and have foundations/purifiers in the water it will never let you place that blueprint if you move. Never. 
---
Are you on PC? 
---
I have a group. We defend the kings lands from those who try to claim it. We claim new lands for the king as well. 
---
Heavy mic users, roleplay, pvp and quest design/ quest givers. 
---
We have a castle too... And a lawyer.... For roleplay. Alot more stuff you can do in numbers. 
---
Try this bit: xyz owns a workshop. I travel to his workshop. You travel to xyz. You confront xyz on mic chat. You have taken the kings (lakeside cabin)! Are you aware of your crimes???? At some point in your conversation i tag the bench. Now you are hostile to xyz. Drama. 
---
Now you must accompany me to the castle to stand trial for taking the kings property. 
---
They can fight you or come along for a zany roleplay trial experience with rewards
---
ok, thanks. I'll try that tonight!
---
It just works!
---
"Okay, we changes that number from 5 to 10. Took us two weeks. It will be coming out in like a week ... ish?"
---
&gt;Lackluster. Kinda like the game itself.
---
That's not fair. If it was like the game, it would crash to desktop halfway through.
---
we don't need a detailed resume. just something more than a couple of the upcoming tweaks.
---
you know, like what the *plan* is? what will this game be in six months? a year? we're a quarter of a year in and nobody has any idea what Bethesda's intentions for this game are. as someone who loves this game, it's understandably concerning. some people are dicks about how it's brought up, but we deserve more than a filler blog post at this point.

This is some good stuff!
---
I‚Äôd like to add to the ‚Äòwhat makes an encounter intriguing‚Äô is the rarity/surprise aspect. 
---
Exploring gets really tedious when I know there will be 5-10enemies in every building or area I come across. I‚Äôve been trying to discover every location and I‚Äôve been getting more and more disheartened when I show up to a place and I have 10 enemies to kill. 
---
It makes the enemies feel less unique and the lack of NPCs kind of hollow. 
---
Also, the footsteps of ghouls. I shouldn‚Äôt be hearing their footsteps when they‚Äôre two floors above me and three rooms down. And no it‚Äôs not my volume level. 
---
Still looking for a dense combat chest mod myself. I have one for the marine armor but no good legendary piece to put it on. Fireproof is a good idea too, might consider that.
---
I have no interest in PVP servers and after that last nerf patch, I've put the game down and won't be back for at least a few months. What made me upset was they were trying to hype it as some new game mode in vault articles for weeks when it's the exact same without pacifist mode and some settings changed. 
---
I found the plans for the outfit in the Halloween decorated lookout tower. Didn‚Äôt realize it was super rare for a couple weeks until I saw stuff about it on here. It is a mad money maker when doing daily selling runs. 
---
I took this pic so I would have it as a loading screen.
---
My current explosive character is modeled after pre-robot Rose (the hair isn't in the game, I use the shaved sides hairstyle which looks like an ungelled mohawk).
---
Rose is my favorite NPC among all the Fallouts.

The only pvp I‚Äôve fought was 1 against a leveled opponent which I beat because I outsmarted him every time and sneaked into a vantage point to snipe him or ran up and blasted when he got distracted. And 2 against a lower level guy with a full PA and seemingly infinite supply of mirvs and I could barely even scratch him before he did 9/10 of my health in. So yeah I guess people drag pvp nerfs into pve when they should be separate systems
---
I dont get why there are so many post with people wanting to punish people for doing things that we are allowed to do in the game. There is literally a perk that adds damage bonus to camp and workshop structures.  They intended for people to attack peoples bases. I get it sucks when someone does it to you but that's part of the game. I would rather they find away to turn all the items people dupe into undropable coal.

Triangle on PS4
---
I have yet to risk switching out Starched Genes haha. Forgetting to repair my armor past 100% is one thing, but if I lost Marsupial?! I‚Äôd be very upset. 
---
Seriously! At this point, the only "armor" I keep is one of every "outfit" or "headgear" that I find, because they only weigh 0.1 pounds and the only weapons I keep are the unique ones you can't get again (like the Blade of Bastet). Everything else is constantly taken up by junk.
---
People still play this? üòÇ
---
That was the real kick to the nads!!!!
---
Google fo76 resource map.. shows everywhere an extractor can be placed. Prioritize acces to jump points/farming/and other plusses and you can get a pretty good circuit netting you 5 or 10 houses a night for under 200 caps in fast travelling.
---
If ya on ps4 go look for mine there.. online bout 8 hours a night and camps been in same place for months and get ya rocks off destroyin it, wont bother me in the slightest.
---
I think I‚Äôd like to join your group lol. Way more strategic than us.   My friend makes karate noises while i sit back and watch and spot.  
---
But we‚Äôre not raiders, we‚Äôre vault dwellers, the raiders didnt get into the vaults, if you were saved just to become a raider, you‚Äôre kind of a dick...
---
I always find nice melee and heavy weapons but they weigh to dam much to keep
---
I noticed this also. Definitely need more raider outfits. Also different armor or skins that change the visual. There are a couple outfits that unequipped armor as well that I wish they would fix. (Yellow hooded rags) As well as ease the restrictions on various mask/helmet combos. (Enclave mask) 
---
One of the most popular mods for fo4 is UCO letting you use and combo of clothing and armor. It‚Äôs 50/50 with clipping issues on this but shoot sometimes it looks good. I just wish they learned from that.
---
So ghoulish only requires that you have some radiation, not that you're currently taking rad damage, correct?
---
Hey, they just needed 3 months to make work traveling pharmacy as intended^^
---
Probably in about 3 years today's issues will be solved. 
---
I'll give you a basic scenario that has happened twice to me so far, levels are general for descriptive purposes;
---
1. Player "A" (level 50) starts attacking my CAMP, no one else in area, I travel back to CAMP to defend, where player "A" then attacks me (I'm in pacifist mode), so he returns to attacking CAMP, I switch pacifist off and kill player "A" who now has a 300 cap bounty, but only collect the 6 caps he has.
---
2. Player "B" (who was hiding the entire time) now kills me with a TSE Dragon to the back (OHK), steals my considerable amount of junk, and collects 50 of my caps for some reason (I was not wanted)  I re-spawn and promptly return the favor, but only collect 10 caps, and retrieve my junk.
---
3. Player "C" (also hiding), OHKs me, steals my junk, and I again lose 50 caps (still don't understand why I'm losing caps), this time upon re-spawning, player "B" is waiting to kill me before I can even move, (and again I lose 50 caps).
---
4. All three attackers now bug out &amp; server hop, I've lost over 100 caps, a lot of junk, and have damage to my CAMP that requires a lot of materials (including Flux to repair), and revenge is pointless, unless I knew where their camps are.
---
That is pretty much the story of Fo76s fall from up high!!!
---
Guild Wars (a 15+ years old game btw) has a function which lets you reconnect to the same online instance you got disconnected from, an instance you could share with other players or just your own instance, doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
While these are obvious different games, at least it enables fixes to client-side disconnects, and it works 99% of the time, a thing Bethesda might take some notes from.
---
The point you make just shows that it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs side of the problem. Of course Bethesda needs to fix the stability, that was never a point of discussion, the point was that people rather reconnect to the same world than a new one, not that we should be glad we have the lesser of two evils.
---
Absolutely laughable. I'm sure it will take them a really long time to adjust the time of the sonic attack. At least a month :/
---
94? (Ne corner of the map)  Opened a year after the bombs fell.... now it's closed again.  Hmmmm
---
My motivation was doing it with 2 accounts for 2x loot. If you don't learn the prime plans on your new account you will get them forever so you can sell. Needless to say, I have gotten my fair share of 2x 1 star wood armor from her crap loot pool.
---
They have many raider groups in fallout Lore that were vault dwellers. 
---
Maybe a galaxy marsh mallow skin with a cape and stuffed toy in back pack...
---
Guess the game!
---
I think something needs done about the bad cause for pvp, I don't know what but maybe they could disable the pvp all together until they actually figure out how to make it work right. I am more for the co-op play than pvp anyways. But that is my thought on it. I get tired of losing my stuff that I grinded aall day to collect because of something stupid.
---
From what I've read on this subeddit, that's all.
---
I‚Äôm always amazed by how much product there will be available, post apocalypse.
---
Oh, absolutely.
---
A lot of people around here say that no one wanted multiplayer Fallout. That isn't true. I've seen TONS of people over the years wishing that Fallout and TES had multiplayer. 
---
However, I can't remember a single time I saw someone wishing for Pvp in these games, everyone I saw talking about wanting multiplayer was talking about co-op. People want to play WITH their friends in the Fallout and TES universe, not AGAINST them. 
---
Brotherhood scribe outfit un equips all under armors but the vault suit for some reson.
---
 I have only ever found one dense mod. I saved it for my level 50 armor. I don't actually do Legendaries and sell them to bots mostly. I do have an Instigating Lever Action I bought off a bot but that's about it.
---
I was shocked to find out Silverman didn't voice Rose, someone named Alex Cazares did.
---
Gad is by the dry lake bed yes? 
---
I'm still hoping one day they'll release a patch that'll make me come back to the game, but it seems I'm gonna be waiting a while... 
---
Energy weapons have been useless since the BETA and I can't wrap my head around how that's been flat out ignored for 3 months now.
---
Try this mod: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
It changed the entire way I play the game. I use 5 loadouts depending on what I am doing:
---
1. Solo play, daytime (rifle build)
---
2. Solo play, nighttime  (rifle build)
---
3. Team play, daytime (rifle build)
---
4. Team play, nighttime (rifle build)
---
5. Solo play (melee build)
---
6. Team play (melee build)
---
7. Crafting
---
8. Barter/Travel &amp; Hauling 
---
I saw plans for it at watoga shopping vendor
---
They keep saying "Roadmap will come out soon".....
---
Well its been 2-3 weeks now. Slap a few pretty pictures on a piece of paper with dates on there and a description of what to expect. Bam! Done!
---
Shit. Anthem isn't even out yet and they released a Roadmap for whats coming out in the next couple months. 
---
Come on FO76! I want to keep playing!
---
I mean wait on 76 it‚Äôll eventually get better. No man‚Äôs sky was ass at launch but is good now. And they won‚Äôt be fallout games so I can‚Äôt compare them to fallout 
---
I'm on PC sadly or I would love to stop by. To be honest that's the best way to go about griefers, just let them destroy it and a good chance they won't due to you not caring. I'll look up that resource map, thanks for the info.
---
People complain about this but it shows that Beth is listening to us and that they aren't just going to give up. 
---
The post is responsible for us missing out on a whole months worth of dev work on this game. If they didn't have to change the time frequency we would have a solid months work of updates. So well done !!!! 
---
Honestly, when it came out that it was going to be multiplayer, I was holding on to the hope that it would be like the Far Cry 5 co-op where you could drop in and out. The PVP doesn't really add anything to the game personally. Makes it more of a pain to avoid damaging other players accidentally and becoming wanted.
---
I'd love to see this flickering background bug fixed. Someday.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqlsVSrxfoU
---
I've been considering Fireproof strictly for the protection against SB scream attacks so that's a good call. Also thought about Radicool but I'm not a melee primary.
---
We're on PC currently and would love to have you in our discord for some fun. I can pm the link if you want.
---
We don't deserve anything just because we bought a game doesn't mean we deserve a detailed road map for every month just because pther games do it doesn't mean they have to "shits coming in the future it's free" theres your road map 
---
The images never load for me anyway in the AS so I'm saved from all this, never go to the store except for the music if I'm AFT, reading Reddit.
---
Still no word on when we'll be getting a road map for future content?
---
I've really started limiting my playtime because I don't want to dedicate a large amount of time on a game that's not adding content I want to play or will degrade the game further from what I want it to be.
---
I've been really patient. I literally had no ability to trade or group up for the first month of this game. To this day, I still have issues forming a group and usually only find success when everyone exits the game, restarts the client, and we form a group in the main menu. It's an on going issue and it's gotten to the point that just stopped reporting this bug.
---
I've stuck around through all that. I've stuck around through dupers, server instability, patches that at least partially rolled back to a previous version of the game, and so many other things.
---
I just want to know what you plan on adding and how it will be implemented. Even a general "by spring we want to add this sort of content. It will focus on this sort of expanding of the game. We'll be rolling it out by opening vaults and other locked structure, and by adding fast travel to completely new zones."
---
The longer we have to wait, the harder it is going to be to please people and avoid yet another public backlash. Because as it stands, I'm honestly beginning to doubt even the developers know where this game is heading and that's not okay.
---
If we don't have a road map within the next couple weeks, I think I'll uninstalling. Time I can set aside for gaming is fleeting and it's getting harder to justify spending it on a game that has yet to even indicate adding significant content, let alone actually implementing said content.
---
Today's lack of a road map and even addressing the issues with the last patch is incredibly frustrating.
---
Seems great! I‚Äôm on Xbox, however :/
---
Ewwww.... okay I retract my previous statement. Good point kind sir.
---
False. First you get a revenge bonus. Second i have no problems with the cap values. I pvp a considerable amount too. And I dont know why you would run up in passive move and then take it off and then engage. My guess is your probably in power arm standing tall next to your base that whole time too
---
That.... seems kind of not fitting. Considering the US bombed the shit out of China, and China bombed the crap out of the US and everyone pre-war was absolutely batshit terrified of communism (remember, this isnt like present day, so far there seems to have been a unanimous dislike of communism in the fallout universe) I cant see that realistically happening. I mean hell, there are horrible little cheap chinese laser robots spouting Mandarin everywhere!
---
Think it‚Äôs a go for late 2019
---
I rarely use power armor which is why I went with Ironclad initially. But since you get diminishing returns the higher your DR I'm thinking Life Giver might be better.
---
Dropping the frame essentially drops the claimed tag on the item, meaning anyone can walk up and take that suit, just like the suits you find at spawn points. The suit is no longer tied to you and will stay on the server until claimed.
---
Always use the place option unless you are giving the suit away or just discarding it.
---
Fyi there are 4 PA spawns in watoga, look for the vertibirds, 2 are on the roof, one is on the ground and the last is behind a lvl 3 locked door, there are 3 more SE of watoga towards fissure prime, one at the ASAM turret camp, one at the bunker and one at the junkyard.
---
Yep. Same dude, same. I found a pretty cool Tesla Rifle the other day. Two stars; looked fun. Weighed something like 15 pounds. Fuuuuck that.
---
I hope this is satire.
---
People are going to complain, but I don't want any patches, ANY MORE PATCHING done until they can figure out why they can't merge data sets without so many things getting broken!  This is priority #1 people, like it or not.
---
That's what we all wanted for the last decade. But Bethesda chose the Fortnite crowd over their own fanbase.
---
We got this bad boy connected with cables but not showing any power output. Do you need a fusion core. Sorry might be a dumb question. 
---
I want guys HALF my level not to take half a dozen shots to bring down.
---
 Terminal programing should be a thing. Give it a Menu when you use the terminal like:  
---
View Log Entries  -- Check your log entries  
---
Add Log Entry      -- Add new entries into your log  
---
Load Game           -- Shows a list of games imported or subscribed to  
---
Create Holotape (if you have a blank holotape) -- For text or voice using mic  
---
Load Holotape   -- Load any of your holotapes
---
Then have perhaps an outside source to create new games to import into the game.  
---
Long term sales marketing strategy, dictated by the marketing department, not laying everything on the table at once, keeping things rare and sought after, to sell at a premium later??
---
Major issues that have been around since November are still in the game and are being flat out ignored by Bethesda or they're too incompetent to fix it, I don't know which is worse.
---
The thing that kills me the most is that instead of large, and I mean large patches for the game (which are sorely needed) what do we get? Pink queen beds and stupid outfits. Cute Bethesda... real cute.
---
Check my profile and other posts. 
---
Bethesda sucks and messed up, but you can't deny people are profiting from the controversy. Even if it means Fabricating controversy or blowing small things out of proportion. The game is a lot better than at launch but the Reddit community is cynical and entitled. People here 300 hours in or level 100+ bored because they did everything. Game journalists citing this small population of total game community in their articles doesn't help either because they use the sub pool of super hardcore late game players as the general playerbase. 
---
It happens in any pvp game.. im 47.. so years of pvp experience.. part of the game if i let it bothered me that much (even though i am mainly a pve player) id just play fo4.
---
Anyways ya welcome.. ill help anyone with suggestions/advice whether they bos, enclave, or even raiders.
---
Were all here to have fun in our own ways.
---
No you don‚Äôt need a fusion core
---
I don't think reactionary is the word you want to use here. 
---
Reactionary means conservative/right wing in their social and political ideologies.
---
Maybe you want to use knee jerk?
---
We still don't even have a general idea of how and when they plan on adding new content. It just seems like even the developers don't know where this is all heading.
---
Exactly what I thought the very first time I played the game.
---
&gt; This game is going to hemorrhage players if Bethesda doesn't do something to capture rhe player base's interest.
---
I fear that has already happened and so they can't justify pouring more resources into the game any more.
---
Well except institute.. screw them bastards.
---
I‚Äôve had 2 drop so far, both level 40 - one executioner and one assassin. Sold the second one. First one is in my stash box. Find my handmade much better and just as effective. 
---
It's my opinion that a lot of people don't quite understand game mechanics and their effects on a person playtime. 
---
If you take a workshop you should be ready to have a party not only come after you for the workshop, but your person for your caps, and your camp for shetz an giggles.
---
In my opinion if you take a workshop you can't call anyone doing want I mentioned above as griefing.  No one forced you to take a workshop, you flagged yourself willingly for pvp and there are consequences.  Some go the the extreme, and some don't.
---
**Which enemies are currently your favorites to fight? Why?**
---
* large groups of scorched or supermutants. Gun vs gun fights are more fun for me, especially in environments with buildings and verticality. The ‚Äúbig bad‚Äù enemies are also enjoyable: behemoths, mirelurk queens, wendigos for the challenge (though they are real bastards). 
---
**Which enemies do you currently dislike encountering? Why?**
---
* mole rats, rad rats, most enemies that attack your shins non stop. I dislike the  constant rad worms and diseases from ghouls but as a whole I enjoy fighting them. Also the big frogs really freak me out but that‚Äôs a good thing. Robobrains are a nuisance and I try to ignore them. Assaultrons are tough enemies so I try to avoid them but I like the challenge when I engage them. 
---
**What makes an encounter with an enemy or creature fun or intriguing to you?**
---
* if it behaves in a way that keeps me on my toes instead of just rushing at me and slapping my legs. I like the humanoid enemies or the larger monsters that make you feel like you have to take a careful approach to them. Paranormal/cryptid enemies are fun too because they‚Äôre unique.
---
**What types of enemies would you like to see added to Fallout 76 in the future? Why?**
---
* aliens, I want to see more related to them and the alien blaster. It‚Äôs supposed to be a legendary-esque weapon and it‚Äôs not right now. Content with aliens that drop upgrades or ways to improve the pistol and get more ammo would be great. More big bosses in general would be nice to see  too.
---
**Other than legendary items, what types of loot help a fight feel rewarding to you?**
---
* unique or rare weapon mods that only drop from enemies would be cool. I also like when enemies drop plans for items. Caps, large amounts of rare ammo, and rare chems are a good haul too. I‚Äôd like to see the scorched at Camden park drop fuzzy tokens too. 
---
**Would you like to see more challenging enemies added in the future, that may require multiple players or a team to defeat? Why?**
---
* YES!!! A zetan invasion at the crashed space station, a huge mole miner boss, a giant FEV/centaur abomination thing (a la One Reborn from Bloodborne anyone?).  A giant assaultron or robot boss. More Lovecraftian monsters would be a welcomed addition.  
---
Kk :D I'll be ready
---
I see it as them taking months to fix basic and obvious things that should have been hotfixed within a few weeks, but that's just me. 
---
He was talking about ESO "and whatevet this game is"
---
Only people who are new even care.  All of us here since beta want new content - could care less about scorch beats or queen.  They are all farm mode.  For gods sake, make some new content!
---
With all the issues, this is it? Seriously? I came looking for some good news to log back in and leaving just shaking my head.
---
This is my major gripe. Theyre NOT WORTH FIGHTING. They drop nothing and consume a huge amount of ammo and a couple stims. Even after the yell nerf, I'm still gonna disconnect on sight
---
That is the location of the kingdom of gadlantis. Yes. 
---
Exactly! Steam has no issues, even after a reinstall, you just point it back at the right drive. 
---
Until a few patches are out, and if its still around,  I think ill get back into divinity original sin 2
---
&gt;please don't think I typed this
---
A lot of comments here seem to miss this... stop giving OP shit, lol.
---
that's great and all and I love that they are actually listening but that's all the content? Nothing else they are looking at/working on... No time table for this fix? This is not good communication by even the worst of standards... The servers have gotten worse, so many things are still beyond bugged and wonky and they nerfed like 60% or more of the perks I've been using that made me feel like I had a fighting chance against the trash mobs... my rifle damage was literally nerfed by 70% Not it's only doing 70%... no it's only doing 30% of what it used to do... 
---
They literally break way more than they fix and all they can tell us is hey we are looking at the SBQ and tell us what you like about monsters...
---
I 100% get what you are saying but the SB screams and SBQ loot table has literally been an issue since the B.E.T.A. I just don't get why there is so little news or info... 
---
I honestly don't think ive ever found a radscorpion in 76, but also i havent played in weeks.
---
Would like to see more ‚Äúraider‚Äù like enemies along with new raider armor and outfits. The ones we have are great but it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs all old assets. 
---
This is just lazy.
---
A three star ultracite one? Never seen a legendary one.
---
Starched is always on for me. More abour avoiding the mutations I don't want.
---
It's honesyly much nicer than here.
---
In that order?
---
That would almost tempt me, to be truthful. But again, only after some more PvE stuff hits, because the game sorely needs it.
---
I learn something new everyday - didn't know crouching/stealth hides you from other players!
---
OK yeah, not sure why you're surprised with the reaction to your low effort shit post, they are a dime a dozen these days.
---
But this one... totally agree with.  First and foremost, they need to figure out how patch/update/fix etc... this game without breaking things they had no idea were going to break in the process.
---
"Fix all bugs" is very different than adjusting an already existing behavior. Loot tables already exist as that (tables of item references that a monster can drop), and cooldowns for behavior for monsters already exist (super mutants don't spam throw grenades for example). 
---
There will be a section of code (or even better, a table of behaviors for monsters) that can be easily found and manipulated. If there isn't, that is a big worry. 
---
Source:  I have been a software developer for 20 years and manage a team of software developers for over 5 years. 
---
yeah i check in every now and then, in the hopes that bethesda will finally get their acts together and starts fixing it.
---
not sure what your point is ?
---
To be fair, ESO was only -published- by Bethesda, not developed. Zenimax was the one responsible for actually making it, and would be the people to yell out about the quality of the game.
---
But yes, 76 was hot garbage upon release, and Bethesda's damage control was beyond inexcusable. And, as a side note, while I can't say for sure why the message boards are down, Bethesda, if you're at the point where you're shutting down message boards to avoid negative comments, it's time to pull the plug and apologize for the whole sorry mess. It'll only do more damage to try to keep going.
---
Fair enough, they mustn‚Äôt have screened participants well enough lol
---
Naw your choice 
---
As do I. 
---
Split pve/pvp and maybe do a hard reboot? I dunno man. 
---
FYI: since the latest vendor patch I've actually discovered you can reliably buy a Marsupial Serum from the Enclave medical vendor. It's a pretty penny (I think I paid 3800 caps), but it seemed worth it to have as a backup in case I lost marsupial or decided to wipe my mutations and start fresh.
---
Because they implemented the mechanics terribly, just like tons of other things in the game. The PvP mechanics are all in favor of the people who want to make other players miserable. It takes zero skill to grief someone, especially when it's groups of assholes terrorizing low level solo players until they log out. 
---
Question for you. Just one of many examples. Do you think it's ok for someone with zero caps on them to be able to destroy your camp and then bait you into attacking him so his friends can kill you? Do you think that's a healthy PvP mechanic?
---
Todd said no servers
---
I am a big PvP fan in The Division and it doesn't always mean players fighting me. Just the other day I was in the Dark Zone fighting NPCs at an extraction point and in the heat of the battle another player showed up and I started freaking out because the NPCs were already a hand full and another player attacking me at the same time will shift the balance and I will die.
---
Lucky for me this guy was only there to extract his own loot so he dropped a healing station and we quick killed off the NPCs, attached our loot to the chopper and went our separate ways. Great gaming memory. Right up there with the other time I ran into a group of 5 or 6 man-hunters by accident. They shredded through me and a lost my loot but the experience is burned into my brain especially the freak-out moment.
---
Anyhow for FO76 I want separate servers. PvE for the players that have no interest and PvP for me and others like me that find an extra kick out of the big unknown when meeting other players. Also some days I just want to PvE and not PvP so then I log into the PvE server.
---
Sexplotations 
---
That falls under "Boosting". Two or more players agreeing to exploit a game feature to gain an outcome in their interest is boosting. Lots of games including CoD will ban for boosting. In my opinion, doing what you suggest is no different than Boosting in CoD infected to get XP or Camos. The challenges are not that hard, and easy to achieve. What is the point of being an achievement hunter if you cheat to get achievements? 
---
It's great you can manage most nights without large enough bugs to stop ya, even with having a current quest bug. But that's the kind of stuff I am still just scratching my head over. I don't think a game like this from a company this large should still be having this many basic functionality problems for people. And I don't think players should be faulted for pointing out how some of the most reliable things in this game are the bugs themselves. We seemed to do better playing on our own or with one other person, but the more players around, the fuckier loot and everything seemed to get. Not from our graphics or computers not being able to keep up, but with quest items, looting, and events. That defeated the purpose of the game for us, since we enjoyed roaming the wasteland together and running across challenges. It was fucking hilarious sometimes, which made the crap bugs all the more frustrating. We were digging the hell out of the stories and running into stuff we had never experienced before together. 
---
I saw a post earlier asking if people would rather have all of the bugs fixed or content added, and a lot of people pushing for content were saying so because they were more afraid of bugfixes breaking the game. We shouldn't have to settle with the bugs we have simply because they don't know how to fix one without adding a handful of others. I am not against the weird random bug on the rare occasion. We play enough games to know sometimes things just go wonky, but FO76 seemed to have a lot of problems on top of not exactly delivering on content or balanced mechanics. Even if people aren't on about the bugs, it's the weapons balance and survival mechanics/perks criticisms. Like...hearing people talk about how there isn't much to do after some point isn't a great incentive to continue pushing through the bugs to get join them at the dead end. 
---
I agree that endgame content needs to be added if they intend to keep the people that made it that far. For such a "lushly diverse" world, people are saying there's diddly squat to do at the end. But I would love to see added stability first so they can keep a larger player base long enough to get there. They need to strengthen the foundation.
---
The skeptic in me wants to say, "Well, shit in one hand...."
---
The fact that we had the issues we did even after waiting really soured us, and it soured us further knowing how long it takes for other games to be developed and released. They seem to have so much to do and a long way to go. Not sure if the money they plunked down and the current player base is enough motivation to actually keep working at a pace that will maintain it. 
---
Lots of good points here and I agree with all of them. Interesting idea on the sniper type enemies, I too have realized that most enemies are the bum-rushing types. Can‚Äôt stand fighting mole rats either since they give you like 3 seconds to fight them before they burrow underground. 
---
On another note, I love the somewhat hidden weaknesses of robot enemies. The sentry bots for example when their fusion cores are destroyed and they make a huge explosion. Also if you blow off both arms of a protectron they will blow up after a few seconds. Using these explosions is helpful to clear out groups of enemies in a unique way. Wish we had something like this for more enemies. One idea would be to have rad toads spray a toxic liquid when killed with a headshot or something like that. Or make honey beasts spill honey slowing down anything that runs through the honey. 
---
Are we only getting three stars because theyre waiting to release newer weapons attributes?
---
Doees anyone in this game have a 4 or 5* weapon/armor?
---
They well seeing as everyone died from the scorched that‚Äôs why there aren‚Äôt any. But eventually it would be nice to at least see some raiders 
---
Was gonna say this. 
---
I also think most of the people that usually do this are people on the main fallout sub who never even wanted to give the game a chance. 
---
Not defending the tons of issues this game has, but it‚Äôs like a lot of people want to pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist since it goes against their view of fallout lore.  
---
But that would eliminate duping and cheating. That's stupid. You're a genius. 
---
My man
---
Like I said, just thinking out loud to get some opinions, for those of us who don‚Äôt want to to PvP. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Haha. I did this once and I have 2 chars, one at lvl57 and one at lvl27. The dude messed me up because he had a file cabinet as his stash box, so when I ran over to it and saw all this stuff I just assumed it was his. I felt pretty stupid 5 minutes later when I realized I had just emptied my own stash to my inventory lol
---
Livin' ain't easy in the wasteland people.
---
Games only been out for 3 months lol
---
i find odd is the claim is server stability is why we have stash limits. i've played other games that fair better with no limits. i'm not quite believing the excuse is entirely truthful. maybe a half-truth.
---
That would solve too many issues. So no.
---
I just uninstalled.  Maybe I'll try again with A Realm Reborn.
---
I they can't be bothered to be motivated by the fucking money I spent on this game, they give me the money back and I can play this as a free-to-play game.  wtf, motivated.  When I buy a product on Amazon, do I need to make sure Amazon is fucking motivated or they might just take the money and not ship anything?  What the hell kind of idiotic thinking is this, dude just stop, stop giving them ideas....
---
I get what you're saying I'm just being hopeful that they're feeling stuff out and taking there time so they don't create more bugs
---
The vipers were vault dwellers 
---
I always dump my extra gear in Fredrich's cash register in White Springs 
---
Enemy loot and containers sometimes gets stuck in an infinite loading animation too, especially if there's several bodies around. The whole battlefield becomes unlootable. Then if you look away for a second, the animation goes away and the containers/bodies appear empty when actually they're not.
---
I've also seen a delay in legendary loot spawns. Sometimes I'll fully loot an enemy, then come back to its body a minute later and find a legendary item by itself.
---
Both those bugs could give the impression that a legendary hasn't been dropped when it actually has.
---
Despawn's a bit random too. Some bodies despawn seconds after they die, or sometimes instantly, while others seem to stick around as meat piles for an hour or more.
---
%13 of active redditors who post in /r/fo76. Considering the sheer *love* this sub has for atom shop, I highly suspect the percentage is higher in the general populace.
---
Being able to place pool balls, rack and cues on my pool table would be nice. Maybe a power armor stand of sorts to display my unused armors like iron man. There is an awfully large selection of shelves and tables to put in your CAMP but can‚Äôt really put anything on them. 
---
More like B. Calling this anywhere close to A pits it next to RDR2. Fortnite was b
---
Nope couldn't type the rest out.
---
Yes, that is months, just like I said. If you play this game for an hour you can see obvious problems that need fixing, but for some reason the devs need to have this information "passed along" to them 3 months later.
---
I would even love the ability to play solo offline or hosting my own server (essentially making it co-op)
---
Yes i do think 76 would have been better.... because had 76 been co op we would have gotten a Fallout game that had all the elements a single player Fallout game has. The fact that 76 is online is the issue.  I think Bethesda should have tried co op first, see how that went and then made a decision on going full multiplayer online from there.
---
I am hoping they do make the Adventure mode PvE only. Shouldn't be hard I think, just mark everyone as pacifist when they log into Adventure mode.
---
It will be best of both if they do it like that.
---
The lack of content is by far the biggest issue that I encounter. I play casual, have one character and I'm at 105 and outside of farming (which is mind numbing) and SBQ (hard to get motivated to) there isn't a lot of options. The Fallout series is a favorite of mostly everyone here but the way Bethesda has taken care of this project is just not good. The game has all the potential in the world but every patch we are left shaking our heads.
---
Depending on how the code is structured, it could be really that easy and done in minutes (or even if it is hours, that is okay too). 
---
They have monster behavior data structures with cooldowns already in place. You can see it at work in all the different monsters in the game. They just need to modify that data for SB. They will have unit tests and simulations in place for monster behavior already. Worst case, they make the change in their development environment and test it manually.
---
They have loot tables already in place. They just need to populate the IDs of the items they want to drop. 
---
My point is that they choose to highlight that in their one primary weekly communication to players. They may have other priorities and things they are doing (a massive backlog I'm sure), but they choose to highlight this in the midst of a sea of things they could be talking about. 
---
Source: I have been a software developer for 20 years and manage a team of software developers for over 5 years. I don't claim to know their exact development environment, but I do know the engine from previous titles and working on mods. 
---
If the Pacifist toggle did more than keep you from damaging other players, we probably wouldn't need separate servers. If toggling Pacifist on meant you did no damage to others and they did none to you or your CAMP, those of us playing solo could just go about our business.
---
Unless that happens I'm all for separate PvE servers. 
---
as dumb as this sounds, I like it. have an updoot
---
Yeah...that was super tone deaf considering the current mood of the player base. They tried to spin it by saying "spend your atoms" but we know what they are doing with that line.
---
This has been floated by this community for a while
---
It desperately needs implementaltion.
---
Toxic zone can have a Giant Radscorpion King/Queen or just a massive hoard of them. Or a Suoer buffed Grafton Monster/Supermutant Behemoth
---
There was a post was back in BETA that someone came across multiple Behemoths in one spot. I havent seen many since but id like to believe multiple super buffed behemoths would do some amazing damage.
---
Mire should have the super sized/buffed Mirelurk Queen.
---
Bog can stay as is, just allow a Queen to appear from all Fissures.
---
Ash Heap is tricky. Mole Miners really arent a major threat so maybe thats where we could have it be randomized. DeathClaw, Scorchbeast, Massively buffed Sentry Bots/ General Gutsies.
---
Savage Divide could also be a Behemoth/glowing ones spawn.
---
Just give us something.
---
couldn't agree more with the other guys who responded faster than me.
---
yeah i visit this board in the hopes to see the tide has turned and the game could be actually worth playing it at some point in the future,..
---
i had genuine hopes that they would have learned their lesson now with the shitstorm that has been cast a week ago..
---
in that context; i think the most emotional reactions here are not so much people who just want to rant or flame, i think they are like myself, just so dissapointed bethesda is going psycho on the fallout franchise..
---
i fear this will become like so many before,... god i loved command and conquer.. untill EA bought it.. went downhill fast imho.
---
im affraid and sad cuz at this point it looks like fallout is going to be so destroyed people will be done with it..
---
and bethesda will never ever sell the IP, so that willl probably be the end of a game series i played thousands of hours since its original..
---
It's just how most games classify exploits of that type. I would see no problem if there was a challenge feature, however. Like challenging a Team mate to a Duel, like Defiance does.
---
It's not healthy but I also dont think they should be punished for the bad pvp balance in the game. I role play as a raider on action but I never go after anyone who is way under my level and 90% I'll repair there base. I dont attack bases often mind you but the ability is within the game. They already have a pvp damage debuff for those who have high bounties and no caps and since the tse nerf it actually makes a difference now.
---
 A good example of the entitlement culture that has developed over the last few decades. 
---
 Its a game. Not something to reward you for your time. Its a game I play every day for an hour or two, sometimes a lot more. 
---
 As I discover more about how the world operates, and make my char what he is, I am able to, at this point just live in the game. That's what I love. 
---
 I have not grouped at all so far. Solo is my way anyway. 
---
After maybe Christmas, I don‚Äôt often see many low levels emerging from the vault, so those plans may disappear into the ether before a player finds them. 
---
Players around levels 10-30 are the ones who seem to benefit the most (under level 5 prob has a bunch of unlearned plans anyway or not enough mats to build jack). I periodically drop plans for players who wave back. Along with low level legendaries only worth a handful of caps. Many players under level 10ish just run from me, even when I tell them on-mic that I‚Äôm just trying to help them with a gift. 
---
Lol, what previously established lore states that giant mutated bats do not exist anywhere in this universe? Please respond.
---
We're very impressed. You are very smart, I'm sure your mother is proud.
---
Sorta, you can farm lvl 5-10s for caps and .38, .308 pretty regularly
---
But even level 68s are dropping me 5-7 caps every so often. Enough to cover costs of simple fast travels is good enough for me
---
Facts.
---
no, that is punishing pvp not griefing. now if you say use coal to weigh down a person that murders someone in passive mode..then yes.
---
I like how I was chastised and insulted for pointing this shit out during the first month. And now it's finally common opinion. 
---
Unfortunately Bethesda quit listening to our feedback long ago. At this pint they are simply doing the least amount possible in game and focusing on the Atom Shop. 
---
When I read today‚Äôs ITV I was truly hoping fir a good reason to come back to the game. Instead what I see are a bunch of pathetic attempts to look like they are actively still working on this dumpster fire. 
---
Timers for events, and reducing the amount of SQ/SB sonic attacks. These  have got to be the two easiest problems to address in actual terms of man hours, time/money, and effort. Both of these changes require minimal blocks of code to be altered. 
---
Never mind any of the issues that have literally driven the majority of the player base away. Who cares that weapons are all unbalanced and broken for all builds other than melee, or that people are still trolling other players by destroying there bases with minimal cost to themselves, trade menus, emote wheels, bugged Plans, bullet sponges, loot tables, etc..
---
This is going to continue to be the path Bethesda travels as long as idiots keep defending the state of the game.  At some point we as a community of gamers, have to decide that we are no longer going to accept shit shoveled into our faces simply because we loved a prior title. 
---
...wouldn't that make you want to chase me down and kill me then? Could be interesting, no?
---
haha, but anyway, we could argue stuff like culture isn't politics, and maybe something like America was trying to free the good Chinese from the Communism etc. The robots are hilarious. Maybe it would make sense to have more remnants of the Chinese around.
---
then they should not have launched the game yet.
---
simple as that..
---
the price drop in just 2 weeks said more than enough.
---
Game no work good.
---
That's about it.
---
I believe it. The game engine they're using (Creation Engine) was **not** designed with online play in mind, and for 76 they basically just grabbed the FO4 code, put together a new game map, and jury-rigged multiplayer into it. It was bound to have weird bugs like that. If they actually gave a fuck about the Fallout Franchise and wanted to make an always online multiplayer game like this, they should have used a different engine. That would have required recreating all the game assets (guns, armor, NPCs, etc) from scratch but would have resulted in a more stable and enjoyable game. It just would've taken a lot longer, which apparently they were unwilling to do.
---
How many hours of play to get to level 214?? You can't deny you've gotten value for money spent already (even at launch price)! I'm level 25 and already my wife think I'm cheating on her...
---
Man I would to be able to put garden gnomes all over. I always pick them up when I see them. It would be cool to be able to either scrap them for their material or save them to use in your camp. I think the build system needs more integration to be able to place item that can be picked up in the world rather than crafting. I still think we need some new roof options and some half concrete floors.  Some much potential but still lacking way more than it should be. I would also like to see player accessible (unlootable) displays like in the other fallouts. Like power armor displays, regular armor displays, something for the little robco models (also make them unscrappable in the auto scrap junk), even make the magazine racks functional to store the magazines we pick up and bring the bobblehead stand. Or even some displays like they have in Whitesprings.
---
Since I spend a lot of time in Blast zones &amp; events, and have no interest in PVP, I always have Passive mode on, and even when returning to my camp, and immediately exiting my PA, I give the wanted player the benefit of forgiveness if they accidentally damaged something. I haven't done a lot of PVP, (only 500 hours in &amp; level 120), so I don't understand why, but I was absolutely losing 50 caps each time I was killed. I'm not sure if them being teamed plays any part in it, but there was never any "slap damage" I was OHK'd twice by players that I had not engaged. who collected caps from me for doing so.
---
A guestbook would be awesome.
---
Last night I saw a team event pop up waiting for more players...I was 1 of 4. Then the server crashed.
---
I'm on XB1 and that's how I set mine up.  Easy for me to get in out, not so much for others
---
They just need to figure out how to better track all the items maybe. It is the first time a game like fallout is put into a multiplayer game format so they may have to hammer some stuff out. I remember playing FO4 and having my game get really shitty on PC when I had a bunch of workshop clutter I imagine it may be similar.  That stash box is basically a shit ton of items that has to be stored somewhere and recalled each time we access it. I'm no game developer tho so I'm not sure how it all works
---
This makes me think the queen was glitched the first time I soloed her. I spent 300 308 rounds from an instigating critical hunting rifle and her health didnt move. 
---
I have a back story as to why my character became a raider lol 
---
 You don't know how the mobs spawn I take it. The low levels at Fort Defiance will be in their mid 20s. There are always some high levels in the 40+ range. In the Forest its not like that. ;)
---
i have bought atoms once. i was up to about 3400 or so atoms through game play bought the snipers outfit. and was sitting on around 1600 atoms i think and i seen the blackbird paint job hit the market.. so bought enough atoms to get that before it went off the store.. 
---
back up to around 4000 atoms again through just random game play (not even actively looking to complete challenges). unless they were to offer me the splatter cannon out of fallout 4 i doubt there would be much else id be interested in.. 
---
the costumes and stuff seem overly cheesy to me, and the only thing i have seen i remotely liked was the 4 post bed but in game its so freaking tiny it turned me off from buying it. now if they added in a thank you emote or something similarly useful emote then yeah.  
---
also as others have stated i might be more inclined to buy paint jobs if they covered all the armors not just specific ones.. and werent the equivalent of 20$.  
---
Just some of the highlights:
---
" We‚Äôve been reading your feedback about Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen and there are a couple of changes coming in Patch 6 later this month that we‚Äôd like to preview for you this week"
---
Not surprised at all, just another Tweet turned into article. 
---
They put way more work in the Atom shop than they do in keeping us informed about other aspects of the game.
---
I've just accepted I will forever have Rad worms. It's just another mutation at this point üòÖ
---
maybe the catlady's cat meat stew factory was feeding the cats of West Virginia 
---
"I don't want my visitors to inmediately realize I'm a fucking retard"
---
I died.
---
Very true, I can't say how they possibly got to this point. Never the less, here we are.
---
i guess honor, dignity and pride would be the key ingredients there.
---
...huh? "Entitlement culture"? That doesn't appear to have any relevance to the article OP linked to.
---
Nothing about all the bugs.. I have to start my game 4-5 times before I can successfully load in most of the time. I also keep having my power armor torsos unequip themselves when I enter the suit. Encountering invisible, silent enemies again too. I hate to be negative, but this is really disappointing.
---
They should make specific servers for specific things like a role playing server, normal server, pvp server,hardcore server like there‚Äôs so much potential in what they can do but I guess they rushed to release the game if they waited a few months and tried a few more things it would have been such a hit 
---
I'm simply providing context for my comment, that is all. 
---
I recently discovered the amazingness of tesla rifles. I have 2 now a ghoul slaying one and a troubleshooter one. Ones for whitesprings the other for silos.  Col gutsies can screw off now I kill them from around a corner lol
---
forget pepperoni rolls, all these pork &amp; beans and no cornbread?!
---
Nah, Pepperidge Farm remembers.

---
If you have any rad resist at all, the rad damage is a joke. Also, with ghoulish, the rads heal you for the damage dealt, so you only take rad damage. Additionally, rad worms boosts the magnitude of all effects by 50%, so it has more benefit than downside.
---
I loved the PVP in the event areas of the old fort. It would have been more fun if we'd been given uniforms and only muskets and swords. There could have been specific PVP events for each sector. Only energy weapons at Posidon. Only farm implements in the farm. Toot tootin gun shooting and heavy weapons at the military base and on and on. Opt in and remove higher tier weapons and all PERKS. A Level 15 doesn't have the same advantage as a fully kitted Assasin gear stacked Perk deck. 
---
The shit sandwich we were given with "griefing is raiding" when you can literally only steal what I'm currently carrying and not raid my base and bases which (thank God) despawn when you D/C. 
---
I think if Bethesda made it not so weighted in favor of people looking to ruin other people's time, it would stop a lot of this without having to directly punish these "raiders" with an idea like OPs. 
---
Something like, you cannot deal damage to other players or their camps if your bounty exceeds the amount of caps you have on you. Or, if someone has a bounty and you  attack them, it does not flag you for PvP for their whole team. 
---
"Entitlement culture"
---
"Paying $60 for a door stop"
---
Pick one. People have the right to complain about this mess.
---
i want private servers, local hosts.. at least then we can start fixing this shit and enjoying whats left of it.
---
Well, if all you do is press mouse 1 and H to heal, then it doesn't really matter if I shoot square shaped enemy or sphere shaped enemy. Painting sh#t to yellow, is still sh#t, just now it is yellow colored sh#t.
---
I feel like I'm listening to myself! This happend to me around 530 this morning. I'm done as well, at least until expansion drops and some serious bug fixes come along. I'll just mo e back to Fo4, New Vegas  (New California) and Fo2. It's a shame to, because I too love the series and still love major parts of this iteration, but the small things have just piled up and made the game a bore and a little to frustrating.  Good luck to you and see you in the wastes...
---
Whichever Wasteland that may be.
---
all the freaking time, the payout don't match the enemy lvl or legendary title.
---
With all of the corn in this game, that needs to be a recipe.
---
Ap refresh 
---
I'd just like to know in advance what problems they're planning on introducing and what will be nerfed with this patch so I can decide whether to bother playing the game again or not.
---
_Ahem_
---
RECIPES go in the Lunch Box. PLANS go in the suitcase. AMMO goes in the tool box. This concludes your Watoga freebies guidelines.
---
On our next edition: Should your Whitesprings freebies be left in the Sack or the Cigarette Machine? The answer may surprise you.
---
 Really. All this talk of inadequate rewards does not mean anything to you? Not working hard enough to keep your interest is one my favorites in general and certainly here.
---
 I'm very old and although I love the young and generally distrust the old, I am somewhat disturbed by some general trends, and this is one.
---
All off.
---
I just think they need a way of keeping people from signaling out one person. Once you kill someone you shouldn't be able to hurt them for like an hour unless they seek revenge.  That would keep people from harassing people they could also add it to were there is a level restriction pre level 50 to keep people with full special points from targeting low level people outside of workshops at least 
---
somebody mentioned private, ya i can see this on a private servers. would  be very cool.
---

---
I always dump my duplicate plans/recipes or unwanted legendary gear in the blue suitcase at watoga station. always. take a penny leave a penny motto.
---
Oooh I like the idea of honeybeasts leaving a trail of irradiated honey that slows and damages. It would add a lot of strategy to your physical placement when engaging them. 
---
I didn‚Äôt see anything else mentioned being fixed. 
---
Yes but what about areas where the scorched were not from? Like the capital wasteland and other parts of the us
---
True!  I often do a circuit through there when I need more ammo, but since it's a popular farming spot it's often been raided when I get there.
---
The [Port-A-Diners](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Perfectly_preserved_pie_\(Fallout_4\)) do this, in FO4 at least. Your chance of getting a pie is initially very small (2% with 8 luck), but it's increased by 0.05% with each attempt.
---
They should be doing literally nothing but bug fixes right now. The scorchbeasts suck hard and are really annoying, but not as annoying as the multitude of game breaking bugs.
---
they need dedicated PVP arenas in the world map, where the winner can get the loser's caps. plus a reward of some kind. 
---
&gt;!though i know not many people will even bother with them normally. !&lt;
---
This. Literally states there's an upcoming patch. This is literally just some excerpts from what's coming.
---
OP needs to learn to read.
---
Just delete/disable PvP and a lot of the problems will go away.
---
It‚Äôs been 25 years since the bombs dropped 
---
When teasers first started coming out, friends and I desperately hoped for co-op or more of a PvE MMO sort of game. Literally none of us bought it when we found out it was open world PvP. That's isn't a fun play style to everyone.
---
They need to drop the disease chance from enemies by alot anyways. The amount of cures I have to use one after another is mind boggling 
---
I would *love* to find a troubleshooter tesla. I bet that's a blast.
---
thanks to inquiries like this, fallout now puts you back in the same server you left and server hopping is basically broken.
---
See I like that for like excess chems and ammo. I mean the new guys need that more than a recipe for Deathclaw Wellington or plans for Flamingo themed decor or like a lvl 45 plasma rifle.
---
For real, I've finally just gotten used to the idea that I just have to deal with it unless it's a really bad one 
---
While I've enjoyed my time with the game, I agree with a lot of this.
---
Separate PvP/PvE servers would be a good thing.
---
On PvE servers let camps and workshops be community places where people can work together to build. Instead of having some jerk come around to steal the workshop you spent time on building or powering up after fixing a power plant, have them be able to join in and make use of it without having to kill the player who put in the effort
---
Once that's done, focus on adding new content to the game while fixing bugs- and not just Atom shop content. More stuff we can actually earn and buy in game. More activities to do and reasons to drop nukes elsewhere instead of just The Whitespring or Fissure Prime.
---
I put in a lot of hours, so I got my money's worth, but my time playing has slowed to a crawl because my routine literally involves logging in and just trying to get enough fusion cores without the game crashing or someone stealing my workshop, selling some excess stuff to vendors for caps and that's about it, because there really isn't a reason to keep playing.
---
It's two mths old why are people acting like like its so old and has a lack of progression bc everyone wants instant gratification... I agree with you  fs. 
---
 It was $80 for me and with mu 400+ hours in it its paid for. I'm just beginning my serious game after getting 2 chars where I want them. A seriously good door stop in my case.
---
 And so do I.
---
Co-op Fallout is the farthest I ever wanted them to take it, I think 76 could be a good proving ground for them on getting networking sorted and learn what worked best for having more than one player so they can use it in Fallout 5 and have a co-op mode. 
---
Yes because (looking at my post history). All I do is whine, nothing constructive..  
---
Laughingly pathetic and predictable response.   
---
Because bug round ups, including the fixes in many cases, does **Absolutely Nothing** for the community at large..
---
I would gladly take on 3 scorchbeast at one if they would lower the amount of other things that attack you at the same time. Nothing more annoying when fighting a scorchbeast then what the super mutants stopping their attack on the scorchbeast and making you their priority. Or the stupid amount of scorched that you have to fight in the process also.
---
if they add legendary power armor there is no way normal armor will be viable anymore.
---
You-Tube can help you get started :)
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs a filthy lie. I‚Äôve had a terrible time trying to play as a mostly solo player. I feel without teaming up anything beyond your average leveled hoard is extremely difficult to kill by yourself. 
---
I thought SB screams are energy attacks?
---
Therefore refractor would be needed 
---
That company has no idea how to make co-op.  They've never done it before.   
---
And if they did.  modders were around to fix it.   now they're not.
---
&gt; Is the FO76 subreddit usually just a circle jerk amongst the fan boys that have refused to acknowledge its shittiness? 
---
Pretty much. So many people who didn't give a shit about any Fallout started hating 76 for uuuh fun? that many of the fans did the same the other way around: they started pretending nothing was wrong and downvoting everything that wasn't praising the game. 
---
It's so sad to see. I like Fallout 76 a lot, but it's future looks bad: unasked for nerfs since day one, no new content, and still a lot of problems that we had since beta. At this point it's almost funny to see pretending everything is all right.
---
I mean I admired the idea, but the fact that workshop structures persist until the entire server resets means you are fucking over everyone else for the rest of the day after you log out. Maybe you are into that though lol.
---
Where I drop stuff tends to be based on where I'm at but typically I stick to the following.
---
If I port to the vault, I'll loot the first body to the right, go down the stairs to the body on the left, loot it. Then drop the low level weapons I picked up along with .38 and .45 ammo.
---
Ammo/plan/low level legendaries from leader of the pack event flatwood vendor cash register.
---
Ammo/grenades/missiles/nukes/legendaries/excess radaway over 50 that I'm carrying - lunchpail at Whitespring Golf Course
---
Ammo/plan/legendaries - whitesprings vendor cash register in the hotel production area
---
Ammo/plan/leftover bulk resources - blue suitcase watoga train station vendor
---
I need a better fixed route. Maybe I should start it at the enclave bunker to check for X01 mods first, then grab the technical data, go turn that in, grab the missiles/nukes in the side room, port to harpers ferry, grab the missiles on the upper floor and then port back to whitesprings golf course to dump those into the lunch pail. 
---
Missiles and nukes are fun to use but just weigh too much.
---
she didnt become a robot they used a holotape of rosalynn talking to get the voice and they programmed a miss nanny to act and sound like her.

Its not like Curie from fo4 being a miss nanny being transferred to a synth body

Calling ESO the best mmo on the market is also preference, not fact though lol

And **everything** is diseased. Why can't antibiotics or disease cures work like a temporary vaccine after you use one?
---
Wow, the forums are literally unusable on mobile.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I only sure the ones that drop my damage now 
---
I want servers with other players in them instead of 7 dots on a map that are forever away and that I'll never actually encounter.
---
Because as I've said, and it's been proven before in other online games, when someone that was difficult and random becomes "as sure thing" the value, in all ways, is reduced, in many cases to nothing significant.  
---
The sense of accomplishment is cut by a huge percent.  
---
Again this is basic human psychology, make something difficult to get, it will suddenly have "value", make it easy to get, or worse yet, easy and guaranteed, it becomes worthless (one word)
---
oh man i forgot about the robco models, those would be great in display cases!

Diseased eyebrows still baffle me lol

Haven't played 76 on any other system so not sure how one accesses main menu on those, but it should be similarish
---
I mostly farm xp, it is my way of enjoying fallout.
---
Good thing your wife is possessive !
---
Fallout's problem is the loot system, complete randomness is chaotic, and provides no certainty of progress.
---
The loot system is making me quit the game, because I have no chance to progress; legendaries should drop some money with which you can buy legendary mods to create your perfect weapon.
---
The article doesn't talk about inadequate rewards, though. Like... it literally doesn't. That's not in there. It talks about the problems duping causes for the economy, and the various bugs and issues and designs choices that are making it difficult for the game to move forward, but, uh... there's nothing about inadequate rewards.  
---
Did you actually read the article? Or are you just assuming you already know what it's going to be about? If the latter, actually read the article, because you're mistaken.
---
i never knew how much i could hate something i love. i love fallout, i hate fallout 76.
---
Stealth dont help the assaltrons when I use it that's for sure lol
---
Until they have a system to facilitate this content, I say no.
---
Spawning an SBQ and crossing your fingers that the rest of the server will show up is a horrible system.
---
Thanks for info !
---
Let‚Äôs see. OP makes a post about how Bethesda shouldn‚Äôt listen to the people on this reddit because they are out of touch hardcore gamers and or complainers.
---
You self identify with that.
---
Not that much of a stretch.
---
Predictable self delusional reply. 
---
*shrug*.   
---
I actually think the scaling is clever, and makes it, in theory, impossible to turn into a "easy" encounter.
---
Why do they even bother with these things.
---
i just want a bumper sticker on the back of mine that reads: Caution: stops suddenly for plastic
---
Yeah I luckily dont get that one very often.  I have started crafting a butt ton of cures tho. I keep like 40 on me af all times or more lol I give them to my friends if they lack them
---
Just shut up. We heard you in the other thread.
---
Yeah, I was having that happen a lot yesterday on PS4. Really freakin' frustrating.
---
How's your gear? I play almost exclusively solo without any problems. 
---
I can not understand why so little is happening for a game that incentivises to play it each day(Atomic shop 24hr specials, daily events).
---
Everyone who has experience from modding knows how easy it can be to change things with the engine. Even a single person can create game changing mods.
---
A small team of coders, 3d artist, animators, level designers should archive far more than what we see. I do not believe that the individual developers are the issue but the work practices they need to apply to. 
---
I really don't see any reason not to. Secondly, all standing structures are immune to gunfire from players. So the same should apply to player  camps.  Make it so only scorched, mutants, etc. can damage your camp. That's for adventure mode. 
---
Yeah but they wouldn‚Äôt mean no one else is there 
---
top comment
---
 Turn your mic on. Talk to them. I cursed one for scaring a player away and he come down to my CAMP nearby and fixed his crap and we shot the shit. They almost always have their ears on and it takes some of their motivation away if you just are cool.
---
 I build my craft area separate from my house and put beds there in case anyone needs them. All my facilities are open to everyone and I have never been griefed.
---
i roleplay as a raider too and I hardly go down. I have been griefed twice in wmmy whole fo76 experience in 400 hours of gameplay, and in both they were groups of 4. Which I was able to kill, retrieve the bounty and stack up more kills while they did seek revenge. A profitable experience honestly. Screw the wood and steel, i gained over 1k caps in both experience. As I mentioned in the post. It's more about the negative impact it creates on the playerbase in general 
---
I‚Äôm online now
---
No bootlicking here, and I agree with the many fixes and updates that clearly need done, but there‚Äôs no efficient way Bethesda can actually sort through the good ideas, QoL needs, and a bunch of unrealistic garbage posts that have been knocking genuinely smart, implementable features further down the sub into obscurity during these quiet news weeks.
---
i had a bit of fun one day. not a griefer but decided to go into my base behind me. so i closed the door. he broke the door after i wouldn't open it. he went back inside and my repair box was outside with me. i repaired the door with him inside. 
---
he stood making emotes at me while i laughed. you snuck in behind me, what did you think was going to happen? after a few mins and calmed my laughter i let him out so he didn't have to break the door again. we waved goodbye and went about our business. 
---
I totally agree.
---
Random drops can be super fun and exciting, but without any other form of progression farming ghouls and the terrible loot table of the SBQ it becomes tiring and repetitive.
---
When I first saw the Enclave commendations I thought it was the beginning of an end game system that would encourage me to do events and kill certain enemies, and that players would earn influence or currency with factions to get end game gear. Seemed pretty damn cool to me, but I was very wrong. Enclave events have some of the worst loot tables in the game. I avoid events in general now unless I‚Äôm looking to kill the legendary mobs some spawn.
---
In other MMOs there are often multiple currencies that allow you to access high level gear by *playing the game a number of different ways*. 
---
Fallout 76 has one game called server hoping, another game called Whitesprings massacre, and another that allows you to exchange ammo and stimpacks for Ultracite Explosive vents.
---
This is what players mean by a lack of content.
---
How many times have y‚Äôall done Guided Meditation? If there was an actual reason to, you‚Äôd probs to do it more. Or if events could scale in difficulty with number or players, or be specifically done on a heroic mode for geared mofos, or rewarded anything that helped us take even a baby step towards a more powerful piece of gear or cosmetic item.
---
I‚Äôll have you know I can read at a third grade level thank you very much. 
---
Hehehe, awesome. I remember my *first* encounter with one of those sneaky fuckers. It was in Sugar Grove and that thing *ended* me. 
---
Loot tables are edited like fucking text files. There's no programming involved at all. Even you can do it, apologist.
---
If using a handgun that improves running speed, while having gun runner equipped, and the pistol breaks your running/walking speed is brought to a crawl.  Your animations still show you running full speed but you're not really going anywhere. Removing gun runner or repairing pistol doesn't seem to help. Have to relog to reset run speed.
---
When was the last time that there was something meaningful in Inside the Vault? 2 months ago?
---
WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY 
---
**BOTTOM TEXT**
---
Totally agree. Very often lately. 
---
No, I had so many mods in fallout 4, and with the limited inventory and more importantly stash space that would just be another resource to manage here. Unless they‚Äôre weightless, but current mods aren‚Äôt. 
---
Of course, im speaking broadly.
---
I like the idea of enemies having a chance of dropping rare materials plans, or modded out weapons, special armor. Having 
---
 variety and a chance for something valuable makes look rewarding. 
---
I can think of a few people I would say that to if I were locked in a vault with them for a week... let alone 25 years....
---
That's been a great tactic for a long time now though, so it should be expected. Diablo 2 and 3 have done that and it works really well.
---
What hurts me the most is that we still have 9 years until the next fallout
---
Thanks for letting us know, Josh. I was really wondering what you'd be doing next month.
---
3 months and still pre-alpha state. How and why.
---
I always end up dumping a bunch of plans in containers either in watoga, whitesprings or the overseers camp after carrying them around for awhile. Or dropping in front of lower level players. I wish they would lower the weight on the plans they start to add up after awhile.
---
We‚Äôre having internal discussions amongst the dev team about how we fix the bugs that we‚Äôve already fixed and then unfixed. Don‚Äôt forget to go to the Atom shop!
---
Pvp seem rare already. Game needs better pve
---
Another suggestion: make mods sellable, not for anything crazy, maybe like 1-5 caps, always something right?
---
I don't know what that is, but it sounds like something a communist would request.
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED ON AMERICAN SOIL. LETHAL FORCE ENGAGED!!
---
 Melee has always been bad in Fallout games. Fallout 4 was not good and neither is this game.
---
 Its real strong though, so flailing away works pretty good. ;)
---
Even their forums are bugged
---
I thought he was joking at first, had to go back and check... they actually put that in there. Almost feels like satire at this point. 
---
Sorry bro i just got off ill be on around 7pm central time
---
I'll add my agreement that they failed to create a PVP mechanics system that works to player behavior and overall playerbase engagement. To do that they would've needed to have a working karma system essentially having inherent qualities to progress along to do with all 3, good, bad, and neutral. All out ganking griefers, those who oppose them and don't believe in it, the vigilantes to their outlaw, and the neutral who do some of either and value not declaring a side for the inherent flexibility and mysteriousness. 
---
I think that given that failure, the best way pvp can move forward is via custom event type gameplay, and that can best be done by handing it over to the community of creators with a sky is the limit creation club sort of system. Then the game can be played like the original great online games (quake team fortress / cs, unreal tournament classic which was launched with the design ideal of open source and community driven player experiences) and some of the current gen greatest of all time, roblox, Minecraft, games with steam workshoppable sky is the limit player creation systems.
---
For sure. Haven't seen Queen of the Hunt, Heart of the Swamp or Powering up Thunder in a month. 
---
Alright
---
I recently set up camp inside the satellite dish next to West-Tec. About 15 minutes after I finished my base in the sky a cargo bot and some vertibirds flew up. The super mutants at West-Tec quickly took them down to low health and I just took a couple chunks off their health and let them do the rest. Then I killed the super mutants and took the card. Easiest keycard ever.
---
The effect no go zone around  a Camp is 3 to 4 times its build radius. So you cannot place another Camp in that area.
---
Think about 4 times the space from the device to the edge to the green zone. That is bloody huge.
---
Nope there is no way to have camps close together. 
---
Ill be there! GT-LTTNDansLegs414 
---
Stay gone, or join the raider party. Or better yet raid the joiner party. Idk man I keep crashing out on PS4 every time I try to play.
---
If they are in a team, they would be in team chat and would most likely ignore. But it definetly doesn't hurt to try and I believe it could work at times.
---
Being a hard core / avid fan should not be a mark of shame.   
---
There are more than a few of us contributing in a positive way, and it's not delusional to think it's helpful to do the legwork for someone, giving them the answer to the "problem" as being helpful.
---
Iirc, aren't there going to be raids in this game? I haven't played in a bit but I had heard it was related to the closed off vaults. If Bethesda capitalizes on that, it could prove to be a very, very good thing for this game. Have the raids scale per player, as mentioned by Minormisgnomer, and drop new loot/higher level loot. Currently the cap is 50 for it, so say drop up to level 55-60 just for the idea right now? Maybe even new gear altogether if they really wanted to make it stand out. 
---
Forsure ill add u rn too
---
So after you got the email, the atoms was instantly added?
---
Haven‚Äôt played for over a month, won‚Äôt be back either, but I have to say it is fun checking in here now and again and realising just how fucked it all is
---
I‚Äôve said it from the start... Bethesda just can‚Äôt be bothered 
---
"The feeling that your time is wasted due to the developer adjusting the rules or bugs destroying your progress is death for living games. If nothing I do matters, if I don‚Äôt believe my hard work will actually be counted for anything and could disappear at any moment, what am I doing here?"
---
 Playing a game? 
---
I dunno if this method is forsure or not, I havent tested it much. But I have forsure found and left items in the blue suitcase for others, and seen them remove items from the case.
---
First make sure to remove ALL items in said container, once all items have been removed it becomes an OPEN container, where as if you dont remove the items it may stay instanced to the player and others will only find generic instanced loot, instead of the loot your putting into it.
---
we are talking about an MMO here. For ppl to leave after just a couple of months the devs really fucked it up tremendously.
---
I am assume stay off the radar by crouching only works with chameleon armour and not by default ?
---
Nice write up.
---
I have no idea why you would think this change would make it land less.
---
It only uses sonic blast and the gas cloud in the air, and it appears to only use the gas cloud if you are hidden or unreachable. Everything points to this change causing them to land more so they can melee attack between blast cooldowns.
---
there is making prime ammo and making mutations.
---
Livin' ain't easy in the wasteland my dude.
---
lol i make caps by raiding. I can 1 shot any player with my bloodied explosive lever action. Which I bought from the caps of dead players. Nope. No one hurted me. But thx for your concern.
---
Because it would go along with how all of their other changes have backfired?
---
Well if you think about it it takes place in an apocalypse. Not everyone wants to team up and some people rp as raiders. For example there is a player faction war on ps4 between the brotherhood outcasts (a rp group that has dress codes) and my group the mothlitia (a non rp group.)
---
Lmao it's not tone deaf, it's just armchair devs on reddit not understanding the teams that work on games like this.
---
What do you want them to do? **Not** try to make money?
---
Great and informative response, man, thanks!
---
okay. If I look at my friends list I don‚Äôt see anyone playing Fallout 76 anymore. Before it was like 20 ppl regularly. Your friends didn‚Äôt quit playing after the patches?
---
i never even realize it until it‚Äôs gone when broken marsupial is making it impossible to explore buildings properly when i can only jump half as high as normally. probably wouldnt notice at all if it wasnt bugged
---
It gets you off the map, not the radar. Which prevents players from seeing your icon on the map. Chameleon gets you off the radar as well as the map 
---
There are many things I want in relation to CAMPS, but these two are things I want the most.
---
I still like the game 
---
Well this is obvious. Since the pvp is broken to no end and most people wanted to have a good pve experience.
---
This never happened. 
---
This is bullshit made up shit posting.
---
Dupers trying to rile up the community to save their banned accounts.
---
You‚Äôre fine. We‚Äôve heard your feedback of wanting to address the bullet wound and are discussing it internally. Stay tuned for updates and don‚Äôt forget to stop by the hospital gift shop while you wait
---
-Dr. Bethesda
---
oh interesting, ok thanks
---
I think they're like energy explosions or something. I've seen enough posts confirming that dense mods and the Fireproof perk reduce damage from them to believe they work.
---
she's an exo from destiny 2...?
---
Super mutants are the best, most challenging, dynamic enemies in the game. It is the truth, even if you don't like them.
---
I did exactly the same thing with Jurassic World Evolution. That game is missing so many features and I doubt they will ever add them, at least not for free, that game has been dead for me since release. Looks like Fo76 will meet the same fate. Since I only play rocket league I won't move on to another game though
---
So far 74 pounds of leather left legs
---
good choice! Only way to tell the managers they seriously fucked up
---
It really must be situationally dependent.  Somewhere between weeks and minutes must be the actuality.  They complain here all the time that things were rushed, then expect a rush fix.
---
They just need to have a more balanced pvp. Right now it's a shitshow. I got gifted some sent/ass armor and it helps out alot with my sniper build. I try and find people my level to fight against went I do pvp but mostly I just pve and play with a couple friends and when someone decides to start stuff against us they get a nice surprise when I murder them lol
---
If you think they're offering more than that then.... no comment
---
In case you wanted to double check, here is a picture of the creepy machine himself

---
chamelon also removes recon tracking if anyone aimed the tracker on you as well.
---
What if when you kill someone with a bounty the only respawn they can use is vault 76?
---
Worse part in in a silo when I'm hacking a terminal and then one pops up behind me and it takes forever to exit the computer lol
---
Really don't see a problem with this Inside the Vault.  
---
It's weekly, so they can't be tons of shit every time.  This addresses a couple big issues and talks about some other things.  What's the issue?
---
Pretty sure it is server lag, changes servers probably improves it a little and probably based on server to server experience.
---
Yes, once I got the confirmation email for the atoms.
---
The first email I got was to confirm that I was eligible to receive a replacement bag, and also that I would be granted the atoms. Seven days later, I received another email stating that the atoms had been applied to my account.
---
Upon logging in, I verified that they had been.
---
Relax, we get these almost every week. One week is bound to be bare-bones, especially when we've had recent major updates. Bigger problems need greater time to fix. So just... relax.
---
Those are rookie number you need to pump those up more lol
---
Always ALWAYS have like 3 top condition guns ready lol
---
If you get in that situation just run off and fix it and come back. There is a weapons workbench in that area in a barn. 
---
I always pick them up then get pissed at myself because I end up scrapping them in a hurry. It would be cool to have other models in the world too, maybe area specific and some for the different amusement parks,
---
welcome to the real world. You finally start seeing the truth
---
We got a badass over here
---
Most people who don't want something don't sit in a subreddit dedicated to that thing.
---
If I don't pick up the pace I'll spend more than one evening on this
---
We are a gulf. PM to get details.  We just joined up look he out ones guild held server. 
---
I usually do the giant teapot for challenges, it's quick and easy and always starts for me. 
---
Just embrace the disease, get Plague Walker.
---
These posts are getting tiresome nobody wants to read these posts where you whine about a game
---
Do you use mines as well? Ive been thinking about this build since the fireproof update
---
The 2 spots i've seen used regularly and use regularly are the icebox at the club near the parkinglot where you spawn.
---
And the garbage can across from Studio 57 or whatever that place is in the whitespring shopping mall.
---
Can't, use an Instigating Super Sledge üòÅ
---
If I buy a product, I expect it to fucking work.
---
Feel better?
---
Crap i didn't even think of that.
---
Yeah I have to come clean, it is me, the one man coding team intern. I code it all in PHP and then run it through a converter to convert my PHP code into C code. I only know PHP unfortunately so it is hard to make the changes.
---
Not to worry, my PHP to C converter is getting an update at the end of May 2019 and that should make the conversion from PHP code to C much quicker. 
---
Ugh, yeah, hate that. I don't need to calmly step back from the computer when I'm being stabbed in the back!
---
 Rage is why I quit buying id games. A fucking travesty. 
---
 Only Bethesda's amazing save of Doom got me to buy it at $10. They performed a miracle after Carmack left them shit.
---
Just bought Elder Scrolls Online... Going to give that a try for a bit I think...
---
Yeah! Tell me what I can and can‚Äôt buy! /s
---
Wish I could supply you with leather lol
---
i have assasin Sentinel, but I continue to use my utility armor set. I run around with a quarter of my health, as I use a bloody explosive  lever action and handmade. Also a sniper, but I highly depend on chameleon. I never need to worry about taking hits as I never take hits. All my engagements are completely stealth. 
---
I'm having more trouble with the steel oddly enough 
---
That‚Äòs a great idea but please don‚Äôt let these guys drop the same shit every time again (like behemoth does) 
---
Great idea! I'll start doing that from now on, also other stuff like ammo and junk :)
---
Hahaha, I didn't even *think* about how those two would interact. 
---
if you play past boredom it'll make you hate the game, take a break
---
Excellent opinion piece.
---
I disagree. I think it's something petty that illustrates how people will grasp anything they can to try to bolster a complaint and get attention.
---
There isn't a single issue in the 'rollback' fiasco that was worth complaining about. It was reversion of minor issues and a handful of people claiming all the dupes were back, which was never proven. 
---
If you're comfortable resting your arguments on 'probably' then you do you. That kind of BS isn't something I participate in. I understand frustration with the game but responding to minor problems with big outcries isn't balanced or helpful, it's just more tilting that does nothing to improve the game. xD
---
Yeah this tactic saved a guy's camp a couple days ago.
---
Or the whole room turns red as they start meeting you with there face lol
---
Livin' ain't easy in the wasteland bruh.
---
I shot my "Son" directly in the face for working for those bastards.
---
I agree.
---
Yeah good point. Maybe a thread about loot tables isn't the best example for my comment, I guess I was more referring to how everyone says the same things over and over about needing the bugs fixed AND new features added. And like instantly too.
---
Yes, have gotten the issue in the same way you did. I usually run around in "combat mode" with no lockpick perks but switch them in when I get to a lock. Did so and it showed as level 4. No clue if it actually made it easier to pick because it's not exactly hard to begin with.
---
It could be better. But frankly I‚Äôve given up on the game in this state until Beth gets their act together. 
---
I drop a ton of ammo there too. And extra aid if I have it. Even excess bulk stuff I get. 
---
 I only use mines when I have a Jet Pack, which takes me to fucking The Whitespring every day to try to score one for my present char.
---
 Its great fun to leap up on the roof and drop mines through the holes. Otherwise I never use them. My combat is too fluid for setting traps.
---
Honestly, it's a matter of the simple marketing concept of positioning. they had no idea where they were trying to position themselves, so they simply positioned themselves everywhere. They wanted it to be a Fallout game. They wanted it to have open world PVP because they thought that would position them to have something unique no one else had. I guarantee you that they new going into it that it would be a huge loss. It explains their reaction after the disastrous release of the game. Complete apathy and no surprise
---
&gt;Go ahead and spend a few minutes on your loot table and bring it back for us to look at.
---
Do you want it as a CSV or what?
---
I have a lather chameleon arm with junk weight reduction I keep hot keyed . If they find me I put on the sent arm 
---
lol, put a lvl 0 lock and allow him to break the lock. sit on other side with powerful weapon. profit.
---
As suggested by many people even before the game launched. Bethesda doesn't know how to make a multiplayer game; they have messed up FO76(IMHO) and (IMHO) the only possible good thing that can come out of FO76 is that Bethesda learns from their mistakes.
---
Ah same. I'm level 140 something and always am low on steel
---
Do you guys have enclave vendor fix coming out in a future patch? 
---
Right now you can only use the middle modus terminal in the,ex military wing, and the right and left one says "vendor in use"
---
Not sure if this has been made aware 
---
Hmmm.... is everything ok, 76 Dev team? 
---
Not only was this post constructive and insightful, I also found it well reasoned. A real twist
---
Absolutely, and that is there unit tests come in (which I assume they have). Set the criteria for the test, run a thousand iterations on it, and see if any fail the criteria. 
---
I get your point, but if a change of this size takes days and they don't have the development infrastructure to do it "easily" that is very troublesome for any future content or monsters added. If this is considered a large change worthy of ~33% of the weekly communication to the players, I'm very concerned about their capacity to deal with the much larger (in my eyes) issues that exist in the core game. 
---
I appreciate your perspective on it!
---
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8495446/
---
On that note I had no idea **Adrienne Barbeau** voiced the Overseer either...she was quite the hottie back in the day!
---
lol, ouch. They need to add an option to allow a "quick exit" that just ends terminal interactions without animation by holding the "interact" button, in the same way you exit power armor, or something similar. 
---
Just log out and back in.
---
Wait... so after dealing with the patch 5 bullshit for two weeks now we get an update where they are fixing only two things that are both Scorchbeast related? No mention of the colossal mess of previously fixed bugs coming back!? No reference to the oodles of feedback on having to repair things every hour of play?
---
Seriously Bethesda? Seriously?
---
They're doing this with the SBQ but there are countless posts about complaints with weak level randoms increasing her health and not contributing to the damage output.
---
As long as your in that server.
---
hehe like my group
---
I will add it
---
I absolutely love reading these posts where someone who had previously blindly defended the game finally experiences what the rest of us have been complaining about for months and then promptly quits, makes a post about it and gets treated exactly how the rest of us were treated by the blind defenders.
---
Welcome to club irony my friend...
---
In a very short blog post about one specific update to the game, they promo their microtransaction shop when the majority of the player base is upset at the current state of affairs. Seems pretty cut and dry to me. People are asking for updates and new content, and they say, check out our shop.
---
I really hoped it would be Fallout 4 but with community base building. I wanted to see a player-built city. But the way the servers and persistence works, it sounds like this will never be a reality, which is pretty disappointing for me. So yeah... unless they keep introducing new zones I'm not sure how much longevity it has. The base gameplay is just as fun as previous Fallout titles, imo, but MMOs of this scale need fresh content if it's going to stay interesting, and it doesn't sound like anyone really knows what that content would look like.
---
Especially seeing as how game dont pause when you're hacking 
---
in the 80s, punkers used jello. 
---
Yup.
---
Finally got an instigating Lever Rifle to drop and of course it was a level 35......I was level 125.
---
It's still better than a non legendary level 45.....but WTF?.....as if the RNG alone isn't bad enough.
---
Well, I try not to be aggressively cynical, but I hear you.
---
Indeed, one most probably agree with.
---
Yes, you keep mixing up difficult and random.  Still confused why you think server hopping is difficult.  I believe the word you are looking for is tedious.  I've also stated many times it should be difficult to do.  Again, confused how to you gloss over that each time.
---
We obviously have a different sense of accomplishment.  My sense of accomplishment is setting a goal, working towards that goal then reaching that goal.  Your sense of accomplishment is rolling a die and thinking you actually did something when it lands on your number.  
---
I'm done replying to your comments.  They aren't constructive and I'm just repeating myself at this point. 
---
Lol read their release regarding criteria for duper bans. Chances are if you got banned you're one of the dicks completely ruining what's left of the game for others
---
I've been playing for hours this morning with no issues lol
---
Literally unplayable!
---
&gt; For starters why are they asking for more feedback on creatures when that is literally the least of their current worries? 
---
because there were many posts about bullet sponge creatures lately 
---
It‚Äôs almost like they think they‚Äôre done fixing it. 
---
Just get a PlayStation lol easier to transfer data
---

 **Bethesda Please! Allow me to seek proper JUSTICE! I won't be MAD, if you will let me get EVEN.**

i thought this post was about bethesda buying stuff from us for a too high price, and then we are allowed to "patch" it...
---
Ash heap should be a monstrously sized moleman glowing with internal coalfires. I'd also hope for deliciosuly bassy moleman wheezing and grunting.
---
I'm sure there's some of both actually seeing as how there is more than one person pointing at it. Some people may be using it as an example, others using it just to complain. 
---
Despite that, it shouldn't happen in the first place and it is still a fiasco and a bad look. 
---
Bohemeths in more locations, and super aggro especially when nuked.  Loot should equal difficulty.  Same with Hermit crabs, MRL queens, and all unique Lore Creatures.

Let us nuke Mothmen super aggro.  But retweak the weapons as the explosives were failed down too much - maybe + 45% to stop the stinginess if the game now.  Increase legendary drops, create a PVE based arena/server, and tweak the building with bulked junk issue. My last 2 cents would be to allow fluids up to 10 - 20 play ers max for co-op based play.  Let them build settlements together and share plans/materials within that group only.  Would help to unite as intended.
---
You might as well kill the sentry bots for the fusion cores since they are aggro before you log off.
---
When I was level 17~ a couple days ago for the first time i had a level 130 harass me for around 20 minutes in full power armor with an exploding rifle and a combat knife. I tried hopping off and back on twice and on the third try it worked. I don‚Äôt even understand why, I was just trying to kill super mutants. 
---
First we know Bethesda will defend this pile of garbage but it is still fun to play, we can all hope we will see a decent game if they decide to fix it.
---
Second you know people cheat and will continue cheat so why engage, yeah I get you don't want to lose your workshop but who cares, but spend as little time setting it up, blueprint things so it is easier to deploy, if some ass wipe cheater like this guy shows up, who cares, move to a different server, block him so he doesn't follow you, start another workshop. I find it rare now days people take workshops from others but it still happens.
---
Why lose hundreds of caps when you can just start another workshop for 25 caps, who cares, move on. Workshops can be setup in minutes. I also have blueprints of my house empty, so the more you put at a workshop the more it costs to take over. So I throw down a few houses and bunch of things, if they want it they going to have to pay. If they cheaters cost probably won't matter.
---
Don't give up on the game because of some little dick bag or a chronically broken system, there is still lots of fun to be had if you smart, I rarely let dick bags bother me, I just move on, don't engage, find another server. Also maybe find a workout out of the way, that Red Rocket stop is too close to the ammo factory, so he probably was going for both .. choose one that gives you what you need that isn't necessary in a highly trafficked area. There are 22 workshops up for grabs, literally one for every player if they wanted.
---
Here is a list of all workshops and resources .. also the one that says it only has water and food, also has gold and lead but is unlisted.

[Imma just leave this here...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRq8bqF8cFc)
---
Did that and it happened again. Maybe if I let some time go by and/or come in someplace else. I used to save the game now and then and undo something like this... the more i think about this the more i suspect if i log in someplace else after some time passes it will go back to normal.
---
I like it though. I mean you cant win all the time. Sometimes you lose. Sometimes you win. Its anout how you build your character and utilize it on the field. Cant just go up to someone and boom boom and win. Get an idea of what youre up against and find a way around it or make use of their weakness. Gear doesnt always matter in pvp either. 
---
Luck of the draw hits commonly for me(8 luck) do you have it maxed because it‚Äôs supposed to give quite a bit back to its condition. I‚Äôve repaired a plasma rifle from nearly broken to about 1/3 damage to condition. I can‚Äôt make it though a second core on the gatling plasma though. 
---
THIS!!!! YES!!!!
---
I don't think I have ever been successful with that, doesn't it have 3 areas you have to constantly defend ? Can you do it more than once a day ?
---
Balances, tweaks, loot tables, and pvp servers come really far behind wanting some more cohesive plot lines.   
---
The overseer plot kind of petered out. The survivor tapes disappear pretty quickly. The enclave was fun, but it's got less meat than I'd like. The most comprehensive story was basically the BOS plot line, which actually felt like it had a real arc that tracked with quests.  
---
I super dug that line! I super dig the other plots which have starts (but need arc and finish)! How about some more focus on writing and storytelling and not just widgets and fixes?
---
Wow, really. That's pretty cool.
---
There are a number of hold-overs from FO4 that don't work in 76 specifically because there is no pausing.
---
Eh I just put on my postal outfit and run up to ransoms and dump them on the ground 
---
Ah, got it. Thanks guys, or girls, or unknown other sis something or other. Makes sense.
---
What do you mean?  Scrap was remove from workshops?
---
I agree with your sentiment for sure. New content and deep, complicated, and core fixes take time. 
---
I think a lot of the unreasonable expectation of speed for these comes from just how much there is (or appears to be) wrong with the game from many different perspectives. Bethesda really started deep in the "technical debt" hole when the game launched, so folks see any progress from their -50 starting position as no progress at all, which is a bummer. 
---
Going from -50 to -25 or even 0 will have people saying "we're still not in the positive!". It is a tough situation. 
---
honestly this thread shows the hugbox they are determined to turn the game into, pretty lame.
---
How about you start the discussion by giving your input, chief?
---
We need a 4th hack perk to let us auto hack or something 
---
now there's a loyal dog ,good doggy

Problem is you‚Äôre likely very squishy without any sentinel or cav gear yourself, and no dodgy. You‚Äôre just as likely to die from a body shot from my handmade than I am to your crit shot to my head. I like my chances better
---
&gt;Not only was this post constructive and insightful, I also found it well reasoned. A real twist
---
My apologies, I really did try to stick to my goal.
---
Those YouTubers are pretty big losers, they should have lifetime Bethesda bans. Quit completely screwing the game up for everybody else
---
As playerbase goes down I hope CAMP budget goes up. It's the one good thing about the game.
---
You can keep on polishing a turd but that don't make it a diamond
---
Same for lockpicking.
---
 I don't do these things, but I had to to be a General. The Enclave Robot Protect ones are pretty easy. ;)
---
Yeah it has the 3 pipes but I've never had more than one getting attacked at a time. As far as I know it's only once a day but I usually only do it for the daily challenges so it always seems to work out. 
---
Maybe they'll tell this one to the team. Oh, wait, they don't tell anything to their team. They don't even tell them what version of this piece of shit to update when they create patches.

You may very well be right. No good throwing good money at a lost cause. If that is the case it was a fun ride I still enjoy and will most likely enjoy until they shutdown  the servers. It happens.
---
Total War : Arena is shutting down in Feb 2019 and I enjoyed that game but it couldn't stay profitable. I still have good memories of it.
---
I enjoyed FO76 and I am glad I could experience it. Hopefully I can level my main to lvl100 before they shut it all down and switch off the lights.

The title should've been: A law firm sees an opportunity to get even richer by going after Fallout 76 Developer over state of game.
---
&gt; The base gameplay is just as fun as previous Fallout titles, imo, but MMOs of this scale need fresh content if it's going to stay interesting, and it doesn't sound like anyone really knows what that content would look like 
---
And that's what worries me, no one seems to know what would be fun. And when a paid game dev is asking you what you find fun, one does worry.
---
Just because its a bad MMO doesn't mean it's not an MMO. 
---
"Bethesda mismanagement "
---
FTFY
---
I mean, maybe you don't care about your progression meaning anything (though progression is kind of a core part of most games - that's what makes them games), but it's hardly unreasonable to expect progression to actually matter in a game. Especially an always-online "live service" game like Fallout 76 wants to be.
---
Also, glad to see that you actually read the article. Still nothing to do with inadequate rewards, but hey.
---
Sounds like lawyers fishing for money based on what I read in this article.
---
That‚Äôs from November 2018. Got any actual news?
---
A Wanted player gave me a brown bag full of recipes and plans he can't use and neither could i but took them.
---
I don't kill players.
---
Anyway, how about leaving unwanted stuff at the Overseers Camp?  
---
EVERYBODY has to go there to progress the story, so why not have a mall there and everybody can look at things they want or need
---
I‚Äôm doing this in the mean time and ooh man. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. I didn‚Äôt even know it had an automatic mod until I saw your post. Kinda solves all my problems.

Eh, I kinda like the Wendigo too. Generally fast and aggressive and freaky as hell. I think they like to juke you a lot too?
---
Takes so much time to swap the perks in and out so often 
---
I'm holding out hope that the next patch is going to be a hundred bug fixes at least.
---
&gt; Being a hard core / avid fan should not be a mark of shame.
---
It's not. It's how you act. And there is way to much entitlement that goes hand in glove with the hardcore gamers. It's a part of that whole subculture.  Case in point, you do think you are the more important community and as such, Bethesda needs to listen to you.
---
And that' the problem with hardcore/avid fan. They think because they invest so much into something, they should be the ones listened to, and games should be shapped around them.
---
Reading your past posts, it's clear you are of that nature. It doesn't matter if you aren't tossing out insult at Bethesda left and right. it's pretty clear, you think you're right and others are wrong. 
---
Because you are a hardcore gamer. 
---
And anyone that isn't on your side. you look down on. 
---
Yes, because as we already know, they tell us everything they're working on ahead of time /s
---
I only mentioned it because he isnt exactly unknown on this subforum
---
I've found that I consistently get more 3 and 2 star legendaries when the enemy isn't a ghoul. Due to that, I don't bother with Whitesprings anymore.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve see where selling something triggers that. Or, I have to quit the trade and try again. The second try usually works for me. 
---
Your point? You took a chance on something you thought might work. Despite the fact that Bethesda said it was new to this. It failed. Have they even committed to a concrete date for any pve dlc yet? Other than the storefront I mean. 
---

There are a ton of reasons I don‚Äôt want to, but the biggest one is that the PS4 is a lot more expensive then the Xbox, even the used versions. And I don‚Äôt think that the PS4 is more then $75 better then the Xbox
---
I'd want them to make money if they'd just stop making all this goofy shit and make something remotely cool for once.
---
Okay, veteran dweller. Just... okay.
---
Yeah we have been trying to figure out some better places to nuke that have decent leg spawn
---
That‚Äôs kinda the opposite of a PSA. ;)
---
Oh the scorch. I see this farming. It's when they are in that state of hibernation before they die. All have to do is kill something around them to snap them out of it. It's not every time, just sometimes.
---
Yep. Even using the Perk Loadout addon, which is faster than by hand, it still takes longer than it should.
---
They need to make high level enemies spawn in nuke zones. New baddies, buffed mutants, deathclaws, huge robots, etc. 
---
Yeah, me again, the intern doing the coding. My PHP to C converter had a little bug that the vendor had to sort out before I could continue with the bug fixes.
---
The vendor fix took a little longer than expected but all good now, my PHP to C converter is up and running and converting all my PHP code into C as I type this. Should be converted and ready to compile in the next day or two. Unfortunately converting PHP code to C is not a quick thing.
---
And there is genertic response number 45 
---
In on ps4 so I dont even have that option lol
---
Would have loved to do this. 2 of my irl friends played on  launch with me and we were so upset to see we couldn't do this 
---
I dump spare stuff and a couple full fusion cores in the overseers cache near vault 76 for new players. 20 lb limit so you can easily fit ammo, meds, plan, fusion cores, a decent low level pistol etc.
---
Ok but maybe focus the point here my dude? :/
---
It would have been better single player 
---
I know there will be more stuff than just that which they will be fixing in the next patch... but it just seems like their patches never have too many fixes in them. Huge file download for most of them with not a lot of fixes/content. I remember playing EverQuest (that's right!), EQ 2, and WOW and the patch list being quite extensive and actually fixing a lot of the problems. I would always enjoy reading through the whole dang thang. Of course there are people that will always complain about balance issues whether it is a class or a weapon but I'm referring to bugs/glitches mostly here. Just seems for other online games I have played that they fix more things per patch and do it faster.
---
/rant over
---
WHAT!?
---
It's silly to think that this game can be saved. No man's sky was completely different. It was the first of its kind. No other game like it before. this game is completely unoriginal, just a cash cow pulled out of the code of Fallout 4 with all of its same bugs. Destiny was brand new. first of its kind. Unlike anything we've ever seen before. Are you starting to understand now? There's nothing at all new or original about this game conceptually. How can this game possibly recover if it was doomed to fail from the beginning? 
---
Well they like the term ‚Äúdweller‚Äù instead of player or fan so yeah...
---
crashed 30 min after launching the game. welp guess ill check on this game in another couple months
---
I‚Äôve been trying to sell some and just dumped it last night. Damn. 
---
I honestly don't know at this point, despite all the resources they should have access too, they're releasing stuff slower than a 5 man indie dev team.
---
Less responsive to player feedback? Sure, but not this slow.
---
I call BS, I've crafted a dozen or so lever rifles in a sitting for mods more than once and have had absolutely ZERO problems with Beth. Unless you have evidence to prove otherwise you're just another duper that FO76 is better without

There's a big difference between one item at a time being added and items being exponentially (literally) created. Use your brains.

Half sarcasm
---
I know it procs a lot, just doesn't seem to be a significant repair amount, I always check after combat, not during though.
---
The character I've tried it on only has 6 luck, and yes I have level 3 luck of the draw. I was hoping it would "fix" the gatling plasma for me, but I couldn't tell a difference like you can eith gunsmith and weapon artisan, which are night and day. Luck of the draw seems like more of a placebo effect. You see it proccing all the time, which makes you think it is actually worth the three points. I wouldn't think the actual luck stat would affect the proc chance and repair amount, that would honestly kind of piss me off if that's the case.
---
There are no cons, only features.
---
Wow what a great audience 
---
I don‚Äôt see it anywhere... I scanned the entire area and there‚Äôs not ONE harvestable item around there!
---
I've been saying for a while now; there's no saving this game. It has a terminal case of bad press and bad developers.

and you were in such a hurry to bash fo76 you forgot to let people know what this game is called.
---
Well said.  People try to mix it up with me and I‚Äôll blast their ass.  I tend to leave people alone and mind my own bidness 
---
Thank you so much and I agree.
---
I don't even mind random drops.  I think they are beneficial because they can sometimes steer you into a different build or give you a much needed boost.  The problem is that this is really the only way of completing some tasks or obtain gear.  If we were able to break down legendaries, and it took 50 scrapped legendaries to make a one time use mod which I could apply to another weapon, then those Furious Rippers will have some value.
---
My main point and issue I had when making this thread was with pet taming.  I server hopped almost 150 times looking for a tameable pet.  Yes I kept a loose count because it was getting frustrating.  Finally found one today and was very underwhelmed when I tamed it.  I didn't feel I accomplished anything. Then, an hour later some level 50 came by and killed it.  
---
What is more reasonable now?  Go server hopping another 150 times hoping to get a lucky dice roll?  Or complete a series of difficult tasks, that may take a hours/ days/ a week and EARN it.  
---
&gt;rewarded anything that helped us take even a baby step towards a more powerful piece of gear or cosmetic item
---
This.  I want to play the game naturally with baby steps towards a goal, not cranking on a slot machine lever.
---
Yes, I agree, the Wendigo is also a great enemy. Deathclaws as well. Anything that has both ranged and melee attacks, some kind of unique AI, and a clearly defined weak spot (Deathclaw belly) are what make a good enemy in my mind.
---
If you still looking for one, I found one, what a pain to get it. If I don't hear back from you, I assume you found it and I will sell it. I did countless server hops, but you can have it for 200 caps.
---
not a massive horde please, it will give too much xp and they will nerf xp on all creature families that are in hordes
---
It certainly didn‚Äôt interest me upon release, and I do love Doom, and it certainly is a rip-off of borderlands, however like I said; the game is aging well, has plenty to do, and runs smoothly, none of which any of us can say about 76.
---
If it stops bored players from trashing my camp in adventure mode, then I'm all for PVP servers.  Let them grief each other in their own little world of self-loathing.
---
It's the new titanfall BR that doesn't have the movement or the titans. Apex Legends.
---
What you don't actually know 
---
Good. Bye.
---
The crashing is the number one indicator that the game is fundamentally screwed  IMHO. If they can‚Äôt make the game stable then I have a hard time believing that they have the skill or experience to truly improve the game at its core. If the game is crashing how can players expect enjoy any new content they add? 
---
Plenty of cat food dishes, though. The only rational explanation is that cats evolved quickly to eating only human flesh.
---
How is it possible that they‚Äôre still looking for basic feedback on enemy types and combat this long after release? Like, isn‚Äôt that the kind of thing you figure out beforehand? Or in the two months after release? 
---
Right now I would be happy just trying to either hide/fight just 1. I always seem to have at least 2 or 3 on me. 
---
i am pretty confident it was suggested by multiple people during development and design, but it would take more than 1 fte so its too expensive. they needed that fte slot for the atom store content creators
---
Don't know exactly how much they hold,  it's not a lot. Certainly not limitless. I think it would cause server problems if it was. 
---
My forum post
---
Super Mutants ‚Äì They have a variety of attacks that feel / look like they are different.  You might be facing a mini-gunner, a rocket launcher, an assault rifle, melee.  Each one makes you approach them differently.  I feel like their ‚Äúsponginess‚Äù is also appropriate.  Not too tough, not to paper bag.
---
Mothman ‚Äì Just unique.  Love his looks and the way he always melts away to nothing.
---
Flatwoods Monster ‚Äì Love the mind control.  It‚Äôs a unique mechanic and most of the FO76 mobs are missing that ‚Äúunique‚Äù feel.
---
Gulpers / Fog Crawlers / Grafton Monster / Snallygaster ‚Äì Their only purpose / mechanic is to be a bullet sponge and provide rare crafting drops.
---
Ghouls ‚Äì The hordes of them that come at you make me feel like you expected people to play in groups a lot more than they do.  So sometimes this can be over whelming.  Folks don‚Äôt do these in groups often because the group mechanic is so broken.  If you want to take on hordes of monsters, you literally have to cripple your build so you don‚Äôt kill something before someone tags it.  Otherwise they will lose out on legendary loot and xp.
---
Mole Rats / Radscorpions ‚Äì Because their ‚Äúteleporting‚Äù attack is just terrible.  Nothing you can do except jump around like a fool even when you know right where they are (recon scope).
---
Mega Sloths ‚Äì These guys do nothing.  There is no challenge.  Maybe that was what you were going for, you know being a sloth and all.
---
Scorch Beasts ‚Äì REALLY? Do we really have to tell you why they are bad?  Most folks just log out of a server rather than fight them.  They are bullet sponges in the air.  Their attacks are terrible (who wants to see what they are fighting anyway).  I feel like whoever designed these flying turds never played the game.  Even the queen is a terrible fight.  There are no mechanics other than wait for her to land and then go to town.
---
When enemies use multiple tactics on you.  Often at the same time.  Makes you have to think about ‚ÄúOh, do I take care of the melee guy in my face, or do I take out the rocket launcher first, maybe I can just dodge rockets until I can get to him, holy crap that mini gun is ripping up my armor!!!‚Äù
---
There is a good variety of mobs right now, but they need to feel more different.
---
Drops that are appropriate to what you just fought.  Baddies should drop the weapons they are using and ammo for the same.  Sometimes it just feels random.  Also, a super mutant that just shot 50 bullets at you, shouldn‚Äôt just drop 4 bullets of that ammo type.  Advanced leveled mobs should drop rare crafting materials.  For example scorched mob variants should have a chance to drop flux.  I feel like maybe there could be other rewards that could be incorporated as well.  For example quests that provide quest only perks, maybe drops from bosses that could be exchanged for atoms.
---
I know you said ‚Äúother than legendary‚Äù.  But your legendries need a major overhaul.  Right now they just aren‚Äôt unique enough.  Legendary items should change how you play the game.  Right now folks are just saying ‚ÄúDo I want the 25% dmg bonus from two shot, or 33% dmg bonus from anti-armor‚Äù.  When it becomes a numbers game that‚Äôs just silly and only a few affixes become desirable.  You should have affixes that will encourage you to change play style.
---
50% longer range
---
Chance to stun enemies on hit (electric)
---
Damage over time (flaming)
---
Do more damage the further / closer you are to enemies (ranged weapon only)
---
On a similarly related note, guns should have a lot more viability.  You should be able to use almost every gun in endgame in one manner or another.  Just one example is hunting rifle.  It‚Äôs out classed in almost every way by the lever action rifle, but shouldn‚Äôt be.  Lever action should be faster, but hunting rifle should have more damage (offset because of its slow speed).  Also when was the last time you had anyone use anything other than a hardened receiver.  Make other mods viable.
---
Uh, yes.  I thought that was what we were getting at release.  Otherwise what was the point of ‚ÄúFallout with Friends‚Äù.  Grouping and fights that spawn rare group bosses should be the staple of what you are producing, not an afterthought.  Seriously, shame on you.  Grouping is seriously terrible right now.  I have lots of friends I‚Äôve met in game that I want to play with, but how can two snipers play together?  Answer ‚Äì we can‚Äôt.  Most of the time we are just online together, maybe just chatting and doing our own thing because we can‚Äôt group together effectively.
---
SBQ now only drops 3 star legendaries. Total time 20 seconds
---
The big question is what killed those that did not become the scorched?
---
As a raider, I would like to state that in now way do we endorse that loser's behavior. 
---
I get the issue but spending upwards of 100 rounds to kill one super mutant / glowing one? Something's wrong with your build.

Ouch. I couldn't play on PS4 because my brain would not let me live without a reshade mod to eliminate the irritating washout overlay the default game puts on everything.

If would have been nice to have an offline version sort of like ark how you can have an offline version of the game that doesn‚Äôt eat all affect your online gameplay. No porting things over at all just you make two different characters. But offline with co-op would have been cool. The idea of no NPC‚Äôs was interesting but I feel the community of people playing never talked to one another so it didn‚Äôt make it as fun as could be. I will admit I did a small bit of dumb roleplay like dressing as a cowboy or whatever and talked accordingly but nothing crazy. Would have been nice for a super long and intense main storyline rather than looking for a dead overseer to which you have no affiliation too.

---
Yep. The heavy filesize of "updates" are just them adding Atom store items for the drip-feed over the next 2 weeks, and also having to replace up to a 4GB .ba2 file if they change 4Kb of anything in it.
---
The other day i pvp'ed a guy playing what i considered to be a psychopath. He had a 185 cap bounty which i what caught my attention. Dressed in one of the asylum workers outfits, mask and some crazy hair to boot. The guy chased me around for ages after i took him down for the bounty. Was a great laugh!
---
The worst part is Austin is obviously terrible at making PvP. They can't even realize that in a game plagued with duping and exploits, letting characters transfer over to the new survival mode is the worst idea ever. Well I had some fun with the game before they nerfed the hell out of it. Time to move on from this sad chapter and never trust Bethesda again.
---
No I mean built into the perk. Ignores fireproof etc due to shrapnel. 
---
Like I said just a dream
---
Not just FO76 experience but this community as well. I always hoped the circle jerks from r/Fallout wouldn't carry over, but they did. It just feels toxic at this point.
---
Another shitpost to add to the pile.
---
so it apparently a fortnight clone? sounds boring.
---
They should release the dlc/extra content as in unopened vaults (3) asap if they dont intend on loosing the majority of the players before the game dies off due to bad critics and shallow game content once you reach end game.
---
True :D
---
Only way to save the game
---
Let modder do it just like Fallout Vegas / 4 and Skyrim
---
The game was made better, less buggy, playable, and fun.
---
That also means shut off the dumb useless *Potato server* and let private servers a go
---
Bethesda tried hard yet can't understand how the game works
---
Let it go?
---
It‚Äôs frogging ridiculous,  the game is in such a mess, way worse since the last patch, new bugs everyday. Wtf Bethesda ! 
---
nope. if the other guy was right, its not my type of game.
---
...prime receivers?
---
...ultracite ammo? like, every kind?
---
It's already there?
---
You got me.
---
I wish it were bollocks, I would not have been mad about it. It was still reduced damage but his attack rate was pretty fast and not being able to fast travel he just kept hitting me and nearly killed me twice.
---
It may be a fine line to walk between adding new content to the map and server lag.  Adding more players onto one server may make that problem worse
---
I would love to play on PC but I dont have the money to get one that would run fo76 sadly 
---
No, no, no -- not the blue lunch pail.
---
The cash register.
---
No one goes there to use the blue lunch pail. Duh.
---
Well the enclave is not finished. Data miners have found that the bunker is going to get bigger and the president suite is going to open as well. Finally explains all those voting booths.
---
I totally dig what you‚Äôre saying my dude, I desperately want more narrative. We just gotta sit tight and let them sort the mechanics out before they start bolting more assets on. I swear we were due a vault in January, or at least player vendors, but I think they really want to tighten things up before they start adventuring.
---
Getting downvoted for not joining the circle jerk ok ffs.
---
i dont want pve server, i want offline. how many time you go to a location and have an empty truffle bag, an empty end of dungeon steamer trunk? how many time did that happen in fo4?
---
Ahh. I built mine for about ~$1000 a few years ago, but don't have a console.
---
Cash registers. NOT a close call, except in the Enclave Bunker, where there are none, and where newbies can't benefit anyway (so pick another place to leave your plans/recipes).
---
YES, all I wanted was to play Beth games co op with friends. I don't care about other folk...
---
FF14 is amazing, and it's a fine time to get in before the new expansion drops in July.

May as well take down this old news.

I spent like 700 upgrading my tower only think I need is more ram but my motherboard is outdated and I cant find ram for it so I would need a new one and I live paycheck to paycheck so no real chance to get one
---
Don't worry. It is one of those flavor of the month game that'll die out in weeks.
---
It's tough, right? I mean, thank god the SB are getting adjusted before someone legit had a seizure. That is a great change!
---
At the same time it is just a drop in the bucket of what needs to be done and it was disappointing to see only that drop addressed. Idk, there are in a near no win situation right now where they can't say anything that will please everyone.
---
Its happened again?
---
This makes sense in a horrible way because it means that if something doesn't change internally then we really don't have much to look forward to.
---
 I raise you BOS Heavy Combat, Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs. Five levels of Ironclad and 3 levels of Fireproof.
---
I've lost likely 30% of legendary drops to the no-drop bug. its probably a large part of why this games a dumpster and stayed a dumpster for almost 3 months now
---
This is fixed by re-log, or if it demands it, quit and re-log. Since you said in a comment before that it stayed, I would assume, by some miracle, you logged into the same server.
---
I always respect polygons journalism, and they have a point in this article without being overly bashy 
---
Buy the serum from a player... 100-300caps is the standard range
---
Damn, sucks. What kind of motherboard do you have?
---
Nah, I think the PVP part adds to the realism a lot more. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows, bud. ( That is, unless if you are on jet... )
---
Yeah, an inferior mod damage wise isn't going to magically kill the dude with slap damage because it has a tiny bit of armor penetration. It isn't plausible. I think he's full of shit.
---
You can find them relatively easily outside nukes. In the Cranberry Bog you can kind of do a circle of the different locations. Watoga, NAR repair whatever, the antique store, West Tech, and several other locations have decent chances of finding 3* star enemies, and I've had 85% of them give me a 3* so far. You still have the chance of getting nothing or 2 or 1* though. but much less likely with everything but ghouls.
---
I do not know. I'm not very computer savvy when it comes to that stuff.

[*waves from a safe and considerable distance, not making eye contact*]
---
ok so im hearing alot of complaining about 76 pvp being broken, the servers bouncing us,  and how the storylines dont match the game... and from what i see you are so far all;  right...
---
im not one to bash on the game makers. especially the programmers BUUUTT.. 
---
seriously as a true OLD SCHOOL gamer .. your game sucks.. it lacks imagination and fineness.. you need to bring 76 into the millennium with the grace of beautiful landscapes, complexity of trials/tribs and mazes(seriously, the mines are the best you got?) ;and a real storyline that actually makes sence.. 
---
SOMEBODY GET AHOLD OF THE OLDER PROGRAMMERS AND GAME DREAMERS
---
and show these kids what a game should look like.. mystery.. suspense... and (OMG, what the hell was that?) suspence... i want unpredictably in the game..  
---
then add  beautiful homes built by us that can actually 1 be built close together to create a community..  2 built nice and 3 can be defended properly... i want us to work together as seperate entities. i want the pvp set up in the game BUT in its own area .. build arenas with rules and/or wasteland disputed areas that are pvp anything goes.. and keep most of all fallout.. FALLOUT.  fallout is a rebuilding and survival game NOT a survival only..
---
Find a way to stabilize the servers.. keep us in them longer and fro god sake keep us with our friends 
---
[ couple of hot tips ]
---
 i get very irritable, when having to jump six servers so that my whole team can put up their house. or having to wait 10 min to get into a server with my friends...
---
ok gotta go for now..
---
 feel free to ad to this comment lets help bethesda fix the game instead of bashing it. 
---
If you crouch in a bush with chameleon armor, you cannot be seen. Bushwhacker  üòä
---
I'll have to try that out. Thanks
---
Seems more sensible than leaving lower level stuff in Watoga, where the main storyline doesn't take you for quite a while.
---
Change name to Fuckthesda. It's more accurate
---
Ah, k. Was gonna see if I could find some for you cheap. I like building computers so I trawl through those sites from time to time. Either way, glad you can play on console :D
---
I've had 3,000+ Atoms for months now, waiting for something I actually want. Hasn't happened yet... 
---
Was wondering if public traded or Privately actually, never found out. I think the NASDAC is TTWO but Seeing as I can't find the PPS, I believe they are privately owned. 
---
I don‚Äôt play it anymore, because that game is pure and utter shit! Let alone them fucking last gen graphics and the fucking bad performance..BUT! The most ridiculous thing is, that your friends disappear when you are loading an area. I mean, not always, but it‚Äôs absolut not acceptable for 2019. An Engine which the developers should know better than ANYTHING else, should not be in that state! 
---
It‚Äôs often used ironically, but at least for now, the game is, in groups, literally unplayable. 
---
I don‚Äôt see myself wasting my precious time, the little rest I have left after work and studying, for some fucked up shit like that. 
---
No thank you. 
---
Woah that's way lower than I would've thought! Haven't ran into any serum selling players yet.
---
So you're saying that since I didn't have a companion in FO4 that the plot didn't drive forward? That's a very stupid comment.
---
Could not of said it better myself +1
---
My aunt amis good with them. Shes the one who helped me with the other stuff but we forgot about the ram and we couldn't find it anywhere online cheap because they dont make it any more
---
Adhesive is everywhere.

Dude the feedback on issues that shouldn't be a priority is the devs stalling.  
---
Thoughts on it back in November when it was all over the sub: it's a moneygrab by a lawfirm and won't get anywhere.
---
Thoughts now: it was a moneygrab by a lawfirm that didn't get anywhere
---
Whats this have to do with me? or you?

(Have no experience) probably foundation, ramped foundation facing the foundation, then 3rd foundation connected to the ramp on top of the first foundation.

Broken pick up flowers challenge that at times should be an extra 400 atoms un granted to everyone that has played this game

Yeah, I figured as much. I know they want to get the kinks worked out.  
---
Man I just want that sweet story fix.
---
Where do you find this info?
---
As a big Rose fan, I've been trying to find the details on how she became a robot with no luck.
---
It's only possible to get a 4 star, by taking an existing 3 star, and adding a mod that adds legendary effect, like the machete sacrificial blade mod.
---
Damn. That sucks. 
---
You should always keep tinfoil on hand, not only does it have practical uses, it's also good for creating many unorthodox solutions.
---
Yeah but there are none for players to use it seems. 
---
When one opens a trade window with a vendor and clicks the "NOTES" tab, then on the right of one's screen one sees all the plans, known or not, which that vendor is presently selling. Prices are also listed.
---
On the left is all of the plans which that vendor is presently buying. It is always a null set, because **VENDORS WON'T BUY PLANS/RECIPES, PERIOD**.
---
In addition to plans and recipes, I also leave large amounts of ammo (for every kind of ranged weapon except the two I regularly use, .556 and .45 ammo). I leave armor. I leave weapons. Yesterday I left a 2-star (exploding &amp; +10 when mutated) .44 revolver which anyone with a pistols build might have been delighted to acquire, because I will never use it and don't want to bother with trying to sell it. The alternative is leaving all this stuff to rot in the middle of nowhere; I leave it at the vendors specifically so that someone CAN sell it. I don't second-guess their decisions, once I've decided that it's an item I'm going to discard.
---
Probably not, I've gotten high level loot at low level areas before.
---
Please not Harper's Ferry...I hate Harper's Ferry.

Yeah I'll get it fixed one day tho lol

I'm good, got a whole roll of alcan. also have enough Flex tape so I'm good For Adhesive too.

Yeah. gimme the Drone Cannon from Zeta.

---
I always debate if I should upvote things like this because it needs attention or to downvote like was done to me when I said this a month or so ago when everone was blaming dupers for poor game performance. 
---
But unlike these posts that fall on deaf ears I suggest uninstalling and placing a personal blacklist on Bethesda. Its like the people that keep blaming EA but continue to purchase their games. 
---
Voting with your wallet is the only way to get these companies attention. I really like how their space game looks BUT... Bethesda fucked me and for that I will never purchase another one of their games no matter how good it is.
---
&gt; Yes. Every zone should have a boss that shows up when you nuke that area. 
---
Also some that don't require nukes but are scaled to 2-4 players, these can popup as events or take a card from MMORPGs of the past and just make them random spawns (preferably some of both).
---
Have you done cold case? That really scratched an itch for me.
---
People: Want co-op skyrim. Gets ESO.

People: Want co-op fallout and hopeful. Gets 76

i am 47, work a full time job 10 to 6 everyday. kids are grown and on their own. live 10 miles from work, get home bout 615 catch up with the wifes day, eat dinner.. sometime between 7pm and 8pm est i get on 76.. play until 2 or 3 am then go to bed.. im one of those who can lay down and pass out immediately dead to the world.. wake up sometime between 8am and 9am s/s/s and off to work.. rinse repeat.
---
my days off are monday and tuesday. if the wife doesnt have plans to go somewhere (that she wants me to go as well) or something like car repairs, or a nice sunny day to get on the motorcycle, my days pretty much sit at my desk and play games all day. toss in go out pokemon hunting (lvl 38 valor) from time to time bout it..
---
i lead a dull boring life for the most part. but it is quiet and relatively stress free.
---
have they even commited to this game, thats the question. (or will it blend.... acceptable too).
---
everyone knew this was new for them, thats why the first 3 months were masses of tips, hints and help from a lot of people,. even people that made wonderfull stuff on fallout 4 have offered them bugfixes on a silver plate, but bethesda never... anything..
---
THAT is the problem, it feels like theres like one intern is trying out some stuff and fixed a bug by accident and plugs it into a patch so they can at least milk a week more.
---
(the intern spends half his time on running for coffee for the atom content creator teamleaders....)
---
they had massive credit with the community and the modders when this adventure started.
---
we all know bugthesda games, and we love em.. right :)
---
then they made fuckup on fuckup, both with promises on sales and dropping the price so hard, so fast.
---
its not the biggest disaster, but a sting nonetheless.
---
the worse part is that there just seem to be no understanding anymore, internet is shouting in consensus about going specific directions and adress specific issues..
---
the response u get a week or some later is ususally that they will do the exact thing everyone advised not to, and even presented a dozen of better alternatives, its all being ignored.
---
and sure, i understand the atom store is not part of the core game play, and are not even the same people.
---
it doesnt change that its just becoming an pain in the eye, to see them sell pink princess beds for 15 euros, while they just took 60 and havent delivered anything near expectations... even with all that good standing credit..
---
There's only one game it had to charge in IIRC
---
I second your second their second. 
---
People saw this coming months ago, Bethesda never even tried.
---
Cash grab pure and simple :(
---
It only had to charge in one game IIRC
---
I'm sure there'll be some more foreign keyboard layouts. Can't wait. üòï
---
This is my main fcking gripe about the game.  You can be at arm's length from a ghoul with your crosshairs dead center and last away with only half of your hits registering.
---
I chalk it up to the shitty servers and net code not being fast enough to resister your hits.  Same goes for melee weapons.
---
One tip I figured out:  You can not play third person and expect to hit anything with a bullet.  The crosshairs are not accurate in 3rd person.
---
PC? If so, IGN?
---
True, if logging back in on a new server fixes anyway. 
---
I fucking love the " Oh no. My karma.", as if shitting on this game still isn't the best means of farming karma with all of the people who totally quit and uninstalled weeks ago yet still religiously lurk through every thread so they can down vote anyone that's still enjoying themselves.

i would in fact reinstall to see that, but the server would probably crash anyway.. nvm
---
Agree...so hence my comment about corporate meddling.  PvP in general just doesn't fit for this type of game.
---
Has anyone been to the golf course pro shop and found the ghouls lifeless standing and sometimes floating?  I beat on them and the only thing that happens is I can see an empty inventory screen for them.   I still like this game

MMM FN Fal. Don't forget M1 Garand 
---
Buying the plans for the lower tiers unlocks the plans for the next tier up (all Underarmor).

Sweet!

I like the game too, but it's become incredibly tedious and boring to me. Nothing left to do except the same events and sbq mixed in with occasional scavenging

Thank you for the reminder to hit that story up.

You gotta get into the market aspect of the game, man. Imo one of the only reasons to keep playing. Chase that trade high
---
Garand cannot be added the company will not let it anymore
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure she tells you lol
---
This game was dead at release, not counting on Bethesda doing a No Man's Sky. I don't see the player base ever recovering. 
---
and dont forget.. RELAXX!!!!XXXX!!!!
---
I know a lot of people are ‚Äúsick of the bad reviews and rants‚Äù but this game is trash and is in need of fixing. Once they do that the rants will stop. This games like a grind fest with barely any content to grind, and worse barely anything worth while to grind for. Just playing to simply keep my character alive isn‚Äôt fun, playing and following objectives to unlock cool unique items is fun. What this game lacks more then anything is the only thing fallout had going for it besides the atmosphere and rpg elements. It‚Äôs missing worthwhile quests, it‚Äôs missing unique items that are best in slot, it‚Äôs missing those old weapons we would see every game that people came to love. The reason this games failing is because of the loot system and the general lack of fallout in this game. They shouldn‚Äôt just simply be taking the fallout universe, copy and pasting the old game to just look different, then remove all of the questing in favor of random generated loot. Random generated loot works great in large games, and often those games still have rewarding quests. This game doesn‚Äôt have anything rewarding unless your lucky and find it. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs major flaw along with the overall lack of content which go hand in hand. 
---
shhh this is my special request ... i silently hope that only this one will be added :P
---
What platform are you on? I can craft you one on XB1. Let me know, I'll be on in a couple hours. 
---
Reading that list brought back a lot of memories. 
---
I haven‚Äôt tried unarmed in 76, but I‚Äôm assuming this isn‚Äôt in there. It would be nice to have different punches (and kicks?). Throwing jabs and haymakers with different speeds and AP cost would be interesting. 
---
They might not be publicly traded but they have a board of directors and investors. The point is people gave their money to them and to tank their products and screw with those peoples investments can get them into legal trouble. 
---
That's why I stay away from workstations.
---
Hopefully they are learning how their version control system works.
---
Aye, this is the only area I've noticed enemies zone to hunt ya down.  Drug a half dozen scorched to the mine and the buggers came in after me.

I'm talking about the 'silent majority' of people actually playing the game...which in no way crosses over to this sub.

I think you sir are the rare exception to this rule Haha.  Taking care of responsibilities having a life making sure it's all taking care of and then enjoying your hobby.  Thank you for the response I wish I has your kind of time to game.  I'm now needing to choose franchises that in gonna stick to because I can no longer keep up with game releases and the sheer amount of content and hours needed.  I'm a die hard assassins creed fan..it saddens me odyssey is not on my list as when I heard how large and giant the time sink is it was the first ever ac I skipped.  And I know there will be plenty more casualties as more game companies need to deliver 200+ hour content
---
Absolutely hear you... destroying a camp isn't helpful - it achieves nothing other than to upset and annoy the victim for "fun". Set yourself to pacifist to avoid pvp and you just get griefed with no real way to retaliate. I had my first camp griefing last night - I've made it to level 68 playing since beta without having that happen, so I've been fairly lucky, but I think that may be the tipping point for me. I love the building, exploring, etc. and combat PvE is adequate. I enjoy giving away free plans, bags of food, but someone thinks it's fun to destroy my hard work. The material cost of rebuilding is negligible, it just felt like a violation of my space, my time and effort. I had expected this at launch, but I grew complacent over time. Now, reading these threads, I can see it's time to move on.
---
I wish you could pick it up by its tail and chuck it if you are in power armor

She infers quite a lot, and the robot version definitely believes the human version is someone else, but I specifically want to know the details regarding how she went from being tortured/interrogated by the responders to being uploaded into a Mrs. Nanny but.

With random servers, how you even going to find the same server?

I try to stay positive but fuck... it's not even a person working full time.

A whole week and someone managed to change the cooldown value on an attack... like I barely know what I'm doing and I could do this in 15 minutes, 14¬Ω minutes of which would be me searching for shit on Google.
---
The things I enjoyed most in FO76 (before I stopped playing) was ganking noobs. The entire time I RP'd as a raider and it was so much fun. GG while it lasted.
---
Someone made the point that PvP is NOT the same as griefing...which is true.  That distinction needs to be made.  
---
I think many are upset with the griefers...not necessarily PvP in general.
---
Just yes
---
Try playing the game then read inside the vault
---
True

It does. The higher leveled the area is the higher level the loot will be

After selling a broken buggy product Bethesda have taken to trolling whats left of there 76 fans / customers.
---
I messaged you through xbox so we can easily meet up when I get on. 
---
I said it when they announced it and i will always say it:
---
Fallout 4 with coop would have been enough, and improvement on Fallout 4 with coop would have been great. A fully fledged fallout 4 successor with coop would have been the most perfect thing many people wished for.
---
76 is shit.
---
Its buggy, unoptimized, empty and it detracted so many good things from fallout 4, which already detracted so many good things from 3 and nv...
---
I really tried to like 76, but i cant get over my disappointment. As a long standing Bethesda and Fallout fan, im out.
---
Fond memories of the movie Swamp Thing...
---
Link?
---
Hopefully they are learning how to compile their code when patching without breaking so many unforeseen things.  If that's why this ITV is so thin... in the long run this would be the most beneficial thing we could ask for right now.
---
Sucks that this is where we are, but please no more shit show patches.
---
For you maybe for me they are everywhere
---
This was actually my most favorite game in the world. I defended it against my friends and absolutely loved it. Every update just put in more nerfs left and right and only one of the main things we‚Äôve asked for over and over. The last update pretty much ruined being a merchant for most and fucked my mule since I store literally every legendary I find. Most are completely worthless but oh well.
---
Now this game went from being the best game I‚Äôve ever played to just good memories. Usually takes years for games to do that for me, this one only took a few months.
---
Yea, right now you came at a bad time to this sub. It was quite pleasant a month ago but many are upset. As far as the downvoting, many posts were getting downvoted as soon as they were posted by bots probably...it's been going on for a while.

In the mean time, head over to /r/fo76FilthyCasuals . That sub will be a much better experience until Bethesda has hammered more things out and content starts dropping. Since the game is in a stagnant progression state (from players who have done all the quests and are just waiting for new things), you are going to find it a bit more dismal here. 
---
Enjoy the game, it is great for an opening salvo, just take it slow and have fun. We all did (excluding bugs/crashes) but it was great to experience a new world and new lore. Also, try not to finish main quests till lvl 50 if you want leveled rewards from them. (especially quests like *Mayor for a Day*, where you can get a really nice melee.) Otherwise there is no way to upgrade them.
---
Great! Thank you 
---
It's in the Fallout wikia. You can't escape the internet
---
To each their own. if they like it good for them. just isnt my type of game. the way he hyped the game i thought it might have been something i might have wanted to check out.
---
Yes. Tested this and confirmed. 
---
I still like the game
---
"Do something great. Make yourself proud""Make the player proud they played it. Make them proud they bought it."
---
&gt; \-Server stability and frame rate have been better 
---
No it's not.
---
It would be nice addition bridging the gap between hunting rifle and lever.  
---
Sorry to be such a skeptic, but I gotta see a screenshot of one in fallout 76 lol.  
---
Tbh I haven't had too much of a problem with PvP hit reg but it's constantly happening to me with scorched and super mutants, especially mutants cause how much health they have. 
---
Besides my hits being a fifty/ fifty chance of going through I don't have a problem with the game.
---
In third person with melee your body doesn't even have to be facing who it what your hitting either, just your cross hair, kinda broken but probably most of the reason I win alot of PvP fights
---
Ohh I remember hearing about that, isn't there a bug on the card that you have to swap it out and put it back in for the full affect? I'd use a similar build, except aiming with a The Dragon is a huge pain while invisible XD Can barely distinguish the guns little iron sight, but yeah steal is a great build, with covert OPs 2.15X extra damage along with a critical hit and maxed rifle cards and tank killer, and gun legendary modifiers such as +10% damage while aiming or the explosion affect, with bloody or instigating as primary effect, they can wallop huge amounts of damage. I've been in a grind for a Bloody or Assassins 10% while aiming gun. It's a real good build if you won't mind sneaking half the game, but sneaking in it's latest version of the game seems a bit jarred with being stuck in cautious all the time. I'm a full rifle build that swaps strength cards out for either heavy weapons or shotgun, and I say that a normal hunting (lvl50) rifle damage can pretty one shot with a headshot along with Nerd rage and Adrenal reaction (and other cards mentioned above) a high level scorched or super mutant, have yet to start testing them on players, but that's when I get a sweet legendary roll on a hunting/sniper rifle :D
---
That was literally all I wanted. I'd have been perfectly happy if they'd just re-released F4 with co-op. Ecstatic, even. But no. This crap...
---
I would love to find a lever action rifle - but as I said, I've only seen like two or three of them since I started playing.  I carry one with me (non-legendary).  My non-legendary hunting rifle does 4 more damage per shot than my LAR does right now.  I have a TON of .308 ammo, so I like to use my hunting rifle.
---
Fuck yeah bro forgot about those assholes 
---
I have gone lone wonderer for most of the game, I‚Äôm going to try starting again as a low level and do the quests at least with one other person.
---
Same...the last patch introduced so many bugs...I find new ones everyday......it‚Äôs terminal...so sad
---
well you have to keep in mind not everyone jumps game to game to game.. as stated above im 47.. my dad got the first atari and had me on the floor playing with him as soon as we opened the box, i was raised with a controller or a mouse and keyboard in my hand, personal computers hit the marketmy mom managed a radio shack and i got my own tandy to keep me off the family comp, turned into a pc gamer at the age of 12/13 30 some years ago.  
---
my main games over last few years has been diablo 2 for 8 years, then final fantasy 11 for 12 years, beta tested final fantasy 14, then diablo 3, which turned into me playing diablo 3 for a few years (which is the game that caused me to buy a ps4), then on to fallout 4 (which i still play from time to time). and now i play this. also recently picked up a nintendo switch to play diablo 3 and pokemon lets go while at work and to have a system to easily travel with.
---
not everyone has massive libraries of games dividing all of our attention there are some of us that just pick a game or two, and run it into the ground. lol  
---
fallout 4 was the only real fps game i liked and whole time i played 4 only thing i disliked was lack of multiplayer. yeah im at the end of content but i could still spend hours in here just helping random people out and endlessly farming plastic. but i usually lean towards sword and sorcery type games, most others people mention, never touched em.
---
true but most of real life weapons cannot be added if im wrong then please put source and i will fix the list ( 40% of fallout tactics weapons where real life types not anymore )
---
What's kept me going is the knowledge that it's just the Austin branch that is stuck with all this. They are a relatively small piece of bethesda game studios, and they will grow and develop with this game. When I get discouraged, I just stop playing for a bit. I cant expect this to be the only game I play, and I've had a blast everytime I actually play the game. Sooner or later Bethesda will either shift some people around to aid Austin, or Austin will get some new hires. Either way, there are plenty of other games to keep me occupied until it happens. Either that or the game will just die a slow death and I'll remember the fun I had anyway. 
---
I don't think there should be any segmentation of the player base. I would rather see an explicit opt-in for PvP that is handled in a very transparent way like Star Wars: Galaxies did.
---
If at that point the game's automatic match-making preferred to group players with others who have the same PvP preference, as long as anyone can still join anyone else, that would be perfect.
---
Fair, accurate, and not just reddit copy/paste.
---
Gotcha!
---
My simple dream is indestructible (by players) camps.  Let the little shits go over to the new PvP mode servers where the grownups hang out and get their asses handed to them.
---
Fair point with the first part. 
---
The second part.. well, yea, mistakes shouldn't happen. Yet we're a race of mistake-makers and how we respond to them says more about us than anything else. ;)
---
The comments about this not being a camp building game just seem kinda silly to me. We really need SOMETHING TO DO until they fix the game. How painful could it possibly be to give us free stuff to play with to keep us interested in the game long enough that we don't go do something else? Let's see... I have already lost at a minimum -12 fusion cores, 1 full set of power armor, completed Roses Raider mission at least 5 times before it registered, I had to start the Recruitment Blues over and over for a week on different servers until it decided I was worthy. I have lost legendary weapons just running along the country side, while fighting, &amp; when I blue screened ( which is nonstop) . I  have emailed Bethesda over and over. I finally had enough and I said "I followed your uninstall reinstall instructions for PS4, It did not work. This is obviously not an issue with my console". "I do not appreciate your RUDENESS in your not answering any of my EMAILS and your lack of concern my in losing all the items I worked for in the game you sold me really sucks." They answered back with "we do not have the capability to offer any of our players any free or replacement on game items.  Basically piss off.  If it was me and the whole universe of players who once loved my game was now mad at me I would be given them all kinds of free stuff until I got the game fixed to make them happy. They could say. "here decorate your camp and have some cool clothes." being as they made them back when fallout 4 came out.

That‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôve seen ‚ÄòPowering Up‚Äô almost daily. I don‚Äôt know how these mission triggers work. I wish we had better knowledge on these missions. Is it because it was recently cleared? Bugged characters? I hope they are at the very least aware and share some information. 
---
Just like... War. War never changes.
---
Or have PvP flags have nothing to do with the team. It's pretty stupid when 3 people track down a workshop owner and the 4th tags their workshop repeatedly to flag their team and kill someone repeatedly 
---
They get stuck in their Screech attack, and just shoot triplet after triplet of the blasts. Usually, when you take a heavy attack, your character stops moving and doubles over, staggered for a moment. When they get stuck in their projectile attack, you can be stunned by a second sonic blast IMMEDIATELY after recovering from the first, keeping you locked in place. Repeat ad infinitum.
---
It's not that they are doing immense damage, it's that there is no opportunity to retaliate when they start doing this nonsense. Take the L or stand there mashing stims.
---
They haven't give up ! They are adding a new mode in March AKA the game as we know minus the slap damage. PLUS a vault will open with 40 minutes quest line and a couple of dead bodies. There's still hope
---
60+ too?
---
I like how he mentioned that it really seems bethesda keeps taking steps back. I was excited for this game solely because I thought the changes made would be heavily player influenced, but instead they do things like nerf workshops, perks, and xp. Which no one in their right mind asked for and their explanations for those nerfs is just horrible.
---
This will get nerfed by Bethesda as it allows you to have an indestructible CAMP. Just an FYI.
---
Yeah can see your issue but lil further down i explain lil more about what interests me.. my game library is extremely small.. i get something i like and play it till the servers shut down basically lol

PvP currently is trash and you can't even call half of what goes on PvP because when you accidently hit someone's stuff at a camp you end up being chased like a fucking rabbit, how is that PvP when you didn't want it in the first place.
---
The other half is enjoyed by fucking assholes who trash the whole time so, fuck PvP and yeah give me PvE only.
---
Todd can enjoy being a fucking raider and the tension but the way the game is now the tension in the game is probably looking like a candy floss cooking class compared to him being roasted somewhere in a boardroom...looks good on him with this stupid fucking decision.
---
I failed a fight because I forgot to equip the gloves and went bare knuckle. 
---
They're all virtual servers anyway, started up when they're needed. The real expense is game state storage. There's a ton of stuff to track, even more if you only build and never destroy. Definitely more if you want permanent changes to the world. The game ends up requiring more CPU power on their side the more you build. Kinda like how Skyrim's perf would decrease the more items you store in containers. Same deal. Not a cheap proposition.
---
Not exactly sure what fallout tactics is. M1 was in previous games though, Fallout 3 if I remember correctly.
---
I sold mine since I don't use mines. If I ever start playing fo76 again I'll find one and show you. They do more damage than normal mines but idk if they give you caps
---
All I hear is whining
---
Personally, I think there is an intersection of traditional Fallout 3/4 'lone wanderer' types that want a PvE only experience, the rest that want either want co-op or PvP battles, and of course the 'griefer' types that piss everyone off.  
---
It is the intersection of these groups that is causing the 'discussions' here.  And the 'discussions' won't stop until everyone is happy...which most likely will be never.  
---
In general though I think when most folks complain about 'PvP' they are talking the 'griefing' that can take place.  And without any fixes from Bethesda for the 'normal' servers...it WILL continue to be a problem.  Sorry...but that's a fact.    
---
I find it ridiculous that they're asking us questions about what we want or like or dislike when it comes to enemies and when they asked about events previously. Shouldn't they have done that a year ago? You know, when they were making the fucking game?
---
I think the big issue here is they need to add the update where the basic guts of the game function properly. This is not the first online game ever 
---
They have plenty of source and reference material.
---
In terms of weight to caps, crap legendaries aren't even vendor fodder. they're ground trash.
---
They're adjusting the frequency of the scorchbeast's sonic blast, which was definitely one of the most annoying aspect of the game and I'm glad Bethesda's doing it. 
---
VATS and unlimited healing can‚Äôt exist in a PvP environment. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs idea was it but man he/she should find another profession...
---
To debate your points:
---
* Power armor already has innate rad resistance that can't be matched by conventional armor.  It, along with the hazmat suit, has a "hidden" multiplier that dramatically reduces your rad intake.  Try to walk into a blast zone even with a full set of legendary rad-resistant, leaded conventional armor.  Stealth builds and others that make a build choice to not use power armor are forced into hazmat suits, which offer 0 defense other than super strong rad resist.  With the legendary effects, conventional armor becomes pretty good for the tertiary effects, such as higher stats at low health, improved stealth ability and weight reduction.  Power armor offers a free str boost, massively increased carrying capacity with calibrated shocks, your choice of a jetpack to literally blast out of being surrounded, reflected melee damage or an electricity field, and your choice of head mods including highlighted enemies, a recon scope target or increased perception for better vats targeting.
---
* All that being said, I think it would be ok if power armor pieces could get a limited distribution of legendary effects limited at one star.  Extra rad resist, weight reduction, extra durability and poison resist would all be nice, but not overpower the armor.
---
* Two shot even in original form wasn't actually 2x damage.  The weapon with a stock receiver is 2x, but doesn't add the extra damage from a hardened/powerful receiver mod to the second shot.  If you can add a hardened receiver, or the powerful automatic equivalent, you'd be foolish not to.  I agree that 2 shot should have never been nerfed.  At best, it should have been trimmed down to 50% instead of 20%, or left alone and shotgun should have been unable to get the legendary effect, unable to get both 2-shot and explosive together, or fire a single slug with an explosive mod instead of having the two mods apply to all pellets.  Even with a single slug, a TSE shotgun would be formidable for PvE because of the very high base shotgun damage.
---
* I completely agree that stealth builds took the brunt of the KO with the TSE nerf.  A TSE bolt action rifle was actually fantastic, albeit slow.  Now it's better than a standard version, but nothing to write home about, and the perk investment for a stealth sniper is considerable compared to a power armor melee.  My PA/Melee hit lvl 50 today and I have enough extra points to minor in either a pistol or rifle for the odd time I need a ranged attack.  I can stand in the middle of the Whitespring Golf Club and barely take any damage from a dozen ghouls mobbed around me while steadily one shotting them with a non-legendary heated super sledge, or just walk right up to a lvl 91 Deathclaw and go toe-to-toe without fear of being seriously injured.
---
* The TSE issue as a griefer/PvP thing was never solved.  I had my base destroyed by a pair of griefers (didn't even get to putting in lights yet) doing the oh-so-tricky one melee guy does all the destruction with another guy waiting for the owner to appear and try to defend, then get one shotted by a TSE dragon when he loses his slap damage.  The one guy destroyed my entire base no problem with some kind of power fist and Wrecking Ball 2 perk swapped in.  I just stood there and commented on how strong and manly they were in area chat while taking screen shots of player x wrecking my camp and player y crouching in a bush unaware that he was heavy breathing into his mic without push to talk activated.
---
Depends on if your melee or ranged. Melee then unyielding for the bonus str, if ranged power armor for emergency protocols
---
a new fallout just with extra coop thats all they should have done.
---
I think they put a lot of work and love into the game, the details show it. It's the lack of direction from the higher ups that is causing all the issues. They have an amazingly talented team and a beautiful open world to work with. They simply don't know what to do with either.
---
I know the basic idea behind the game is that 'players will build the world they want.' which is fantastic in theory, but the game is so overly restrictive that it makes it impossible.
---
If we had the freedom to build and work like real survivors, then as others pointed out, we would have the ability to build permanent settlements. Or be able to show up to a fledgling NPC settlement and join it, with players becoming part of the new government and building their own new storylines.
---
With the current system, it's not possible to feel like we're putting down roots and thrive as a community.
---
Now THIS is PvE spirit with coop play!

Might reinstall just to try the pvp server out. We‚Äôll see.
---
But Todd wanted drama
---
&gt;Deathclaw Island: Come on guys we all know what needs to happen here.
---
It should spawn a death-claw wearing power armor that runs down the road to Point Pleasant, kills all the ghouls, and then camps in the buildings around the Mothman Statue waiting for people to come farm them before jumping out, ganking them and running off laughing in a deep but computer-generated voice. You can't kill it directly because it just jumps out, kills one person and then burrows into the ground to show up in another part of Point Pleasant. Only way to kill it is to complete the Wise Mothman quest "The Path to Enlightenment", at which point you can then convince the Wise Mothman to fly to Point Pleasant and draw the power armor death claw alpha out in a massive, multi-stage fight that includes knocking down buildings, the Mothman dragging the Deathclaw out of the ground when it tries to burrow, and finally ripping the armor off the Deathclaw. At that point we are finally able to beat it down and complete the quest to kill it, rewarding a 4 star legendary plus the normal loot.
---
Indeed! Even as a lvl 20 player at the start I was able to outrun one with stimpaks. It did scream at me but it was not lethal.
---
The other week I got a notification someone was attack hemlock holes. I was level 30 or 40 at the time, so I was willing to give it up. I was curious, however, who it was so I fast traveled to location just west of the workshop to check it out. What I found was two people. One was invisible on the roof of the work station, the other was in power armor staring at my fast travel map. I slowly snuck up to max range VATS and dumped 12 critical headshots in Mr. Power Armor netting me about 140 much needed caps. He quickly sought revenge and I returned to base. 
---
Forced open team PVP and wanted status is an opportunity for some quick caps. Especially wanted status as it allows you to get the first shot in.

Have you people never played an online game before or something?
---
Even the most successful MMOs I've ever played, years into their services with huge teams, don't release comprehensive patch notes, even for MASSIVE patches months in the making, ahead of a patch.  Hell the few that even released partial preliminary patch notes would only release them at most a day beforehand.
---
Why?  Because plans change and as is obvious here players are fucking ruthless.  A planned feature doesn't make it in time and has to get cut, or a feature that did make it in time ends up changing form and people go for the fucking jugular over all the LIES in the patch notes.
---
I still have not gotten a TSE yet.  I have one but it was from a friend.  Still yet to find one myself. :(
---
Make sure you‚Äôre not dying when gaining mutations. Sometimes, particularly with marsupial, you‚Äôll be granted the mutation as you die so you don‚Äôt actually get it and the server won‚Äôt give it to you since it thinks you technically have it.
---
This happened to me and I had to clear all mutations to get marsupial.
---
Seen a lot more instances of this, especially at watoga. 
---
How long does look put in containers stay there? Does the loot disappear when the person who put it there logs out? Does it stay in there till the area 'resets'? 
---
Got it.  Thanks.  
---
No offense, but what has all this got to do with the shitty shape the game is in.  I'm talking server issues, terrible combat and hit detection and net-code that appears to not communicate in real-time so that half your actions and half the mobs don't work properly.
---
Try stating your platform and what level you are, you may have better luck. I'm probably too high of a level and overpowered for you to have fun playing with. 
---
It's a great game, I hope you really enjoy it?
---
That's what me and many others were trying to tell you guys at launch and everyone labeled us YouTuber bandwagon haters.
---
Nope. Hate co-op games. I would prefer the option to switch between PvE and PvP
---
Lmao you are quite the edgelord kid.
---
Not by scraping, no.  But by scrapping, yes.
---
You can scrap any weapon to learn mods, it doesn‚Äôt have to have the mod on it
---
However, a team-based Deathmatch, like Counterstrike with factions(Enclave vs. BoS, vaulters vs. Raiders) would be fun. That was done to an extent in Fallout:Tactics. 
---
But Fallout as a whole is better co-op. We're all in this together to "reclaim the wasteland"
---
This sounds like a nightmare, luckily I haven‚Äôt died getting a mutation. I got marsupial early in my character and accidentally lost it pre-starched genes. Since then I‚Äôve been hunting for it.
---
Precisely 
---
Any MMO I‚Äôve ever played fixed 3-4 times what these guys do per patch. Sorry. 
---
And yet the teams max out at 4. Good luck corraling 8 players. One's gonna join in &amp; PVP the other 7 for the lulz
---
We need better loot drops for the avg player. Yea some people have two shot explosions weapons but when you did the nerf with patch 5 my 146 damage radium Rifle went to like 43.  It went to like three shots to kill to six shots I refuse to get from duper‚Äôs but the drops have really sucked and I stop playing. I don‚Äôt mind spending hours to get a great weapon but you you made that impossible for us to do . The last patch lowered all my other weapons as well. What‚Äôs the point! I would like you to make the non legendary weapons more powerful for us over level 50 and please put some NPC‚Äôs in the game. I don‚Äôt  are about PVP but if you  make some better changes , life long fans like me will come back.
---
That‚Äôs good, would hate to see you buy a serum only to find it doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
Ad Victoriam 
---
Why doesn't someone ask them? Lol
---
Alright?
---
This has happened to me today and sadly it‚Äôs not going away with restarting the game it still getting worse üòø my combat shotgun went from 136 to 116
---
Thanks for the info, which I just independently confirmed.
---
"Kind of cool" is a value judgment I won't dispute; de gustibus non est disputandum! But for myself, that which a combat armor torso covers was exactly that which I spent the atoms on the Nuka-Girl outfit to reveal. ;-)
---
This is how i feel and i even feel bad for defending it so much. This last inside the vault stung so bloody much.
---
The atom store remark really bugged me.
---
....and do not let the 2 worlds cross over i.e. if you want PvPLand then that's where that character lives, forever.  Don't let that guy cross over into PvELand whatsoever.
---
THANKS for listening.

You can do something like this for GTA:V by blocking the port in your firewall, maybe the same can be done for 76?

Used to be VATS always targeted torso first, and you had to manually flick through the head and limbs. Now, as far as I can tell, if you have Concentrated Fire perk equipped, VATS starts with the last target you chose. For me, that means with my rifle that has limb damage, it always targets an arm or a leg first, whichever one I last selected.
---
It's a bit late to try for customer feedback about they want in your game....after you've made the game. This is what actual real betas are for. Feedback. 
---
Totally agree with the OP.  We ran into a group of hostile griefers last night.  Not only did they not leave us alone, but they were stalking at least one player from server to server.  I kept thinking to myself, if there were no PVP, they would just get bored and move on to something else.  Maybe even another game.  This is what happens when a company tries to please everyone.  Besides PVP is so broken in this game that it's not even close to a level playing field.  They just need to disable it and move on.
---
Totally agree. Didnt understand the beta was certain days and times, so I only played it once for 4hours.
---
You know what really annoyed me the most? Is that you have to use in game materials to apply the tricent Paint.
---
And any MMO you'd have played would be patching things on a schedule of once every 2-3 months, not every other week.
---
I appreciate they acknowledged that but it's also an issue they created in the first place because they never used to do that.
---
Fargo is on twitter..
---
You can learn any mods from scrapping weapons, not just ones the weapon already has. It also works if you craft a basic low-level version of the weapon (armor, too) and scrap it.
---
The Jan 10 update was 4GB. That is pretty sizable for an update, in my opinion. And that was less than a month ago.
---
And was 300% more fleshed out when released.

GTA V uses peer to peer to connect you with others, but I think Fallout 76 has proper servers. In GTA if I ever wanted to play alone and still do CEO stuff I‚Äôd just suspend the process with task mana gear for 10 seconds. I tried with 76 but it didn‚Äôt work.
---
They‚Äôre changing so much stuff and so much is glitched it is kind of difficult to flesh out
---
I bought mine off Grahm.
---
I agree on the core idea, but I just don't want to lose the idea that this is the wasteland man. 
---
point 4 and 5 is easily avoided by not having a CAMP... or having a small wooden shack. I have run across more than one "camp" that was only the CAMP unit and a stash box. 
---
3 can also backfire in the current mode because you can be trying to be in a "gentleman's dual" and start the fight, then the other person gangs up on you and starts the cycle of endlessly killing you. 
---
I do agree with is the instigator of a fight shouldn't get a "Get Revenge" option if they are killed while trying to play raider. And "loot and log" players are just shit whistles. 
---
There needs to be more risk in being a raider. As it stands right now, it is too much "no harm, no foul" and the pain is always entirely on the CAMP you just wrecked. Even if I kill the griefer, I am out more than they are out. 
---
The simple fix is if somebody picks a fight, or goes wanted from stealing or damaging a CAMP and you kill their bitch ass, they dead and they can only respawn at vault 76 or their CAMP. Additionally, there should be a death penalty, such as a 5 minute cool down timer before you can resume play. 
---
The low stakes of PvP has unintended consequences. 
---
I uninstalled when I realized that this game aggravates me more than it gives me joy. I had a lvl 150 stealth sniper that got nerfed to the ground so I decided to try and level up a meta OP melee. After 20 levels and being spawned camped by a Scorchbeast for 3 separate loading screens, I tilted and decided enough is enough. Why would I level an alt to see the exact same story with the exact same decisions just so I can go back to 1 shotting things pre-nerf? And this is only to worry about getting nerfed again so that my build doesn't work because I can't respec my special/perks without another 30 levels.
---
I had learned the skeleton mask plans and I can't make them anymore either.
---
I'd like to encounter these fellow pvp'ers . Not a lot have been accepting my envites except Magazine dupers :/
---
You have never been able to craft any of those hats. They've always been missing a keyword on the COBJ so they don't appear at the armor crafting bench.
---
I literally bought the game in hopes of doing a bunch of coop.
---
Instead, they released... Well the turd that is 76.
---
Could I get a link to the bit? I‚Äôve never really looked at them, and if it‚Äôs as bad as you say it is I want to know everything.
---
You could still give it a try I suppose, the ports are UDP: 3000-3010

I don't think PVP is one of the problems with the game.

Like, don't get me wrong, I like the game as a shooter, and I like finding loot. Except I don't find loot so I make the loot but I need screws so I'm looking for desk fans, and then I'm overburdened so I have to leave some loot behind then I go back to my stash space and spend 15 minutes debating about throwing something away I'm sure I'll never use because THIS IS AN RPG AND I TOTALLY NEED TO SAVE MY ELIXERS.
---
Basically, the game punishes you for playing. So then people exploit it, and instead of nerfing just that exploit, they nerf everything meaning that if you aren't exploiting you're going to have a bad time.
---
Basically, the game isn't very fun, and if you play it like you play regular ESFO games you're not going to have fun. Everything else is secondary to that.
---
I want to build an OP character and one shot headshot things from across the map, and Bethesda is totally cool with letting me do that, except they make it so I get a damage limiter and it makes it pointless to do that, but I'm a casual so it's like, that build is all I have.
---
As long as you're willing to make a character and exploit your way to everything you can play the game at a reasonable rate and play how you want. Otherwise all of the anti exploiter stuff is going to severely punish you.
---
Everything they do to hurt the problem makes it worse for everyone else, and the core gameplay loop, that while enjoyable in FO4, makes you feel bad for engaging in it.
---
Totally valid theory. A good way to fill space in a no news week in PR is to go and ask the public a question, get them engaged and hence cover the fact you have nothing really new to share.
---
However, this is a pretty risky way to fill space, because now you've created a commitment to act on the feedback you get. If I wanted to fill out a relatively boring post, I'd probably take a page out of Paradox Interactive's playbook and go find one of the audio devs or the artists and get them to talk about what their job is like and perhaps tease a few details from say the audio mixing perspective of the upcoming changes to scorch beasts, or equally harmless trivia.  
---
Now perhaps they want to show that they're engaging with the community on the feedback front. Our voices matter and they want us to know it. Okay, that's a reasonable idea, I'd welcome it. But then why ask about balance issues? And why ask such specific yet vague questions?  
---
If I wanted to stall for time, but engage the community for feedback, I'd probably ask something along the lines of 'What weapons do you use the most?" Its a much more harmless question, for one because I already know the answer thanks to the ingame data metrics. Now that question I just posed isn't the perfect one by far, but I could pick something harmless and unoffensive that I already had the answer to. That way everyone answers, and hey, guess what? I can deliver on those answers, because I already started on that a month ago.  
---
So why ask about creature balance if I'm just trying to stall? It seems a lot more like they have fundamental questions about what makes Fallout 76 fun for us, questions that data mining can't answer. Note how nearly every question was followed up by "Why?"  
---
I mean, I understand that you can be disappointed, and I by no means want people to think that I am a Bethesda fan boy, because I am not. But, when people post stuff like this its like they are just trying to claw at something to be on the "upvote/hate train" that is Fallout 76. Yeah it has bugs. Yeah 76 was a PR nightmare. But little shit like this? Come on man.
---
There are probably a lot of devs who feel just as awful about this game as all of us do.  Imagine what it's like to work super hard for years on, say, the engine or the artwork or the animations, and then have execs and middle managers and other teams turn out shit that makes your hard work look like shit in return.  And they were probably sitting there for years thinking, "this thing is going to suck in the end, but what can I do, I'm just a dev on one little team, so I'm going to make the best thing I can in spite of everything else".
---
Every company is a nightmare of mismanagement, and technology companies are the worst because the managers explicitly do not understand one iota of what their direct reports do each day. :(
---
Love the idea.  I fear they can barely keep this house of cards propped up as it is though...
---
Wouldn't make a difference since no really does pvp that much in 76.
---
Their entries are typically maintained by their agents.
---
&gt;and they leave you a mean message lol
---
Yeah, but if you knew ***who*** left the message....
---
Battlecry Studios the creators of the game Battlecry, an Overwatch clone that was ultimately cancelled. Their president left the studio a month before 76 was released.
---
Protective Casual is bugged and does not drop. It is supposed to drop from Quest: Early Warnings, but that quest's levelled list is bugged. So, this lining is not obtainable in the game. For more details: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/
---
It has nothing to do with those issues. My post is addressing why we are getting PVP content instead of story content. 
---
Good one. Glad we had this conversation. Now please sit back and let people have a real discussion about in game issues instead of insulting someone.
---
Waaahhhhh! I‚Äôm gonna complain ALL DAY and then expect me to cater to me! WAAAHHH! FOH!
---
You wanted a scorchbeast fix you got it! You wanted to input your entitled opinion on different mobs you got it! You wanted what they‚Äôre giving you and you‚Äôre so entitled that you gotta sit on here in your moms basement and bitch about a multi billion dollar company isn‚Äôt bending over backwards to release updates (that you‚Äôll inevitably bitch about anyway) every damn day. You hate what they‚Äôre doing get a job there and become the CEO. Oh that‚Äôs right you have zero damn clue as to how to make a game and you couldn‚Äôt even make a mobile game if your life depended on it. So sit down, eat your McNuggets and be quiet like a good little brat you are üôÑ
---
If you didn‚Äôt play Far Harbor, you missed a treat. 
---
i use PA and emergency protocols, normal armor is too painful with how much rad dmg ghouls do at 20% hp. And nuke zones are a thing.
---
Exactly.
---
Xbox here, lvl 22. I'm always dropping lvl 5 - lvl 10 weapons, nonperishable food, purified water, and chems at the Overseer's C.A.M.P or in containers at train stations. 
---
I actually got to build a .308 for a lvl 10 today and include 300 rounds of ammo. We teamed up and I helped him on the Fire Eaters quest going into raider radio with Rose. 
---
On the way up the mountain by the crashed airliner we got the nuke warning. It was VTU. So I told him how to take photos and where to stand. We got some nice pics. Then he told me it was his first nuke. I was truly honored!  
---
&gt;Lmao
---
&gt;kid 
---
&gt;calling someone else an edgelord
---
Given how many of the Atom's stores items seem to be asset flips from FO4, or reskins of existing assets, yeah, I'd say that's spot on.  I also don't doubt for a minute they're making decent money, thanks to the whales.  All you need is a handful to make any cash shop profitable.  Because that's what this is.  A cash shop.  The game is just the lure.  
---
This game is a medical waste dumpster full of mung and corpses on fire tumbling down a mountain the size of the moon
---
I like how they're asking us questions that they could answer themselves by browsing this sub for all of 10 minutes.
---
Just goes to show that they haven't been paying attention this far. 
---
Yeah well I don't mean singleplayer optional co-op how it is now, I mean the game should have been made that way.
---
It‚Äôs been like that as long as I have been playing.
---
Only extractors that give actual scrap are junk and lead.
---
Thank you heaps.
---
This game stinks of poor time management from higher up than developers. I find it hard to believe a game could be this poorly made from a AAA developer. This was rushed out to fit a release shedual about a year too early to bring in some money. The bad press is a symptom not the cause. The game deserves everything it got.
---
If FO76 was FO4 except without SHAUN! and CO-OP but I could have a private server I'd have paid $110 for it or whatever FO4 plus DLC cost.
---
Thank you heaps. I am PSN dtb7591
---
In Diablo 1 and 2 you'd make a server, then when people joined the enemies would get harder. You could make a private server.
---
I don‚Äôt feel any sense of urgency from BSG to make things right.  But I hope you are right.  
---
Agreed. Bethesda admitted they had no experience with this. They also admitted to moving on to develop the next elder scrolls and starfeild. Knowing all of that people rolled the dice and now claim to be shocked that this is a cash grab. SMH.
---
I don‚Äôt see the...oh my god. ..that‚Äôs so creepy!!!
---
I've written short stories, made stories in MUDs back in the day, and run tabletop games for 20 years. I also love everything Fallout. Bethesda, reach out and I will make you stories.
---
I've said from the beginning that they either need full pvp or no pvp with both being offered on different server hives.
---
I get that.  But if we tell them they are the best let's be honest here.  It will be like white knight all over again. They will make them more spongy and the loot shittier.  It happens with all the others.  
---
Yes, and his name is GAAAAAARY.
---
It should have been a normal Fallout title with a co-op story. 
---
Seconded!
---
Would you like some cheese and crackers with that whine? 
---
It's a fucking game get over it
---
Wheres the best place to request them cause I have 13 requisitions and dont want to waste them on ok loot 
---
i've been going inside whitesprings resort to artisan corner and drop bag in the middle of hall as best as i can so it doesnt look like its to the side.
---
but started to notice it doesn't get a lot of traffic. maybe there's so many that don't go inside, EVER! like my brother.  
---
From what I have seen Bethesda Austin studios is the studio currently doing this. There least experienced studio as well. They were battlecry studio before hand. 
---
Great, glad to hear it. Nice base with the two of them to add more autos, also, such as the handmade.
---
Same here, some of my friends say the same thing.  
---
I've never Slept with a Feral Ghoul Wink Wink hahaha ;)
---
When I started reading this post I immediately thought of the environmental armor from tactics. It's basically a heavily armored hazmat suit. I'd love to see it implemented. I'd definitely rock that on a non pa character!
---
Happy cake day!
---
Thanks.  I appreciate the spelling correction too.  :)
---
It did fully charge in VATS in FO4. Gotta hold down the trigger on all charging weapons here.
---
Hah, apparently this engine (which is really old) can run it all. Did anyone ever watch those YouTube videos where they went inside Bethesda? One of the guys was like, So ya we have this game that is based all around the player, but, multiplayer is like, based around everyone but the player.
---
Now, I‚Äôm no programmer, but wish I was...and from what I know about game engines and such is when you have old tech based on old school ideas, it‚Äôs not gunna work if u take a engine built for one player, and let‚Äôs just throw some extra code in and break everything to recognize 50 players in a massive world....
---
Cuz you know, Bethesda has a high level in multiplayer games. Think they wondered off in an area that is over their level cap and their carry limit
---
Yea i always run pa in nuke zones and white springs
---
Cool. Thank you.  
---
How about making repairs on weapons and armor not cost an entire day of farming to get the supplies? Why not make the repairs last longer? Why not make scapper give more junk than just extra worthless steel?
---
I take them all the time, but won't bother defending them from another player. If they want it they can have it. If they are just looking for pvp, well they can look elsewhere cause I'm into that. 
---
Thanks for the explanation.  
---
Isnt buying accounts against terms of service?
---
It definitely doesn‚Äôt pack the same punch as the SMG, but it‚Äôs close and is pretty neat. 
---
I‚Äôll keep on praying to find a Bloodied Handmade! Thanks for the advice man. 
---
HappyCamper781 on PC. Hit me up if you want some backup to clear this Quest chain. I need to dump some crafting materials but I'm usually based out of Cranberry Bog anyway. On most weeknights and weekends Pacific time.
---
a paid private server? Would this just be pay-to-win? Because with that, you can farm White Springs without any other intrusions. If the hero costume for 15 health was pay to win, is farming without others on a paid server pay-to-win?
---
‚ÄúIs not‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúI feel.‚Äù
---
Are you stating opinions, or facts?  If it‚Äôs opinion, phrase it as such. If it‚Äôs a fact, cite your sources.
---
Until then shut up.
---
Happy to help.
---
I don't think I've ever heard a buzzing noise before. What system do you play on?
---
Basically light armor if you wanna max damage as melee, power armor is you wanna max damage as ranged. Pretty much how it goes. 
---
U/[Todd\_thelord\_Howard](https://www.reddit.com/user/Todd_thelord_Howard)  can you please tell us how long the doggie bags last til they disappear??

If you're looking for somethin a bit more chill and relaxing, Astroneer just dropped their official 1.0 release on steam.  It's been in early access for a while, but is now officially complete.  
---
[Check out the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KXQZG7riEs).
---
It's single or multiplayer, roam around, digging up dirt, putting it in other places, digging up materials, building space ships, etc.  Slow paced, fun little thing.
---
One less person clogging the servers :)
---
This sub really will complain about everything
---
So a sum up would be...
---
Bethesda: "Lol, we noticed you guys dont like PVP and keep puting pacifist-mode on so you can play this like a fallout game. We'll have none of that. Time to turn this cesspool into an even more toxic place with mandatory PVP so the last people who stuck around defending this game will instantly get shot, killed and quit for good. Also lolz, buy some more Atoms before you quit" 
---
I think they should have asked these questions before launch tbh, don't charge 60 bucks and then ask people to beta test it for you :/
---
It‚Äôs definitely not Massive, so maybe more like Small.  A SMOG if you will.
---
The SB's when attracted to Whitespring will span aggro all the local bots. Until they are put down. Which isn't too hard if there's someone around with a decent gun/melee combo
---
Haha that would be epic :D Does anyone know, if you lay out mines in your camp, do they trigger for friendly players or just when they become hostile? 
---
How is helping others when they post questions "looking down on them?"   
---
How is posting suggestions, bug fixes and trying to make the game better by making it more stabile "looking down" on anyone.   
---
I won't argue that I sometimes think I'm "better" but that's part of human nature, and deny that your doing exactly that in these responses..... Well would be a bit of denial. 
---
As for Bethesda listening..   
---
Often the hard core fan understands not only the game play mechanics better then the casual, they often will find the errors, exploits, loopholes and flaws.   
---
And reporting those things should warrant a little more attention than others..  Hell many many many MMO's in the past reached out to OP/PowerGamers to help with balance, end game sustainability etc, for the betterment of all.  
---
How are any of those things bad, reinforcing and needing a negative response and a feeling of "shame" for being a "hard core" fan
---
They haven't given up....they are catching up.
---
This game should be an examplw of whats to come from this studio.
---
Between 3 disconnects today alone, stealth bugs, and the Inside The Vault notice from today, I decided to uninstall the game. No use playing if it‚Äôs just going to frustrate me. Hopefully it gets better in another 6 months or so.
---
Couldnt u just change servers to fix the rad worms bug
---
Yeah in this case. They are just doing the patches to save face and keep something coming. MMOs come out with multiple small, medium and large group content. They have multiple things worth farming besides bosses and endgame usually. They have a PvP and PvE option usually separate cause some play for only PvP. They certainty dont release a game that you can be up and done with in about a day, their endgame here was SBQ and that was it, they expected us to take months to get to that point. Wtf. I had the whole map explored in my first night and all quests done that second one..
---
Good news. The "Inside the Vault" for today says they're considering making it so they can only scream once per 10 seconds instead of continuously. 
---
That‚Äôd be nice. I always enjoyed the power armored enemies in 4. It just adds a little bit of diversity to the same old enemies
---
*shrug*   
---
Overall feel the same, ironically, sorry we didn't see eye to eye.
---
Totally agree with the OP. The reason why me and my friends bought this game is so we can play fallout like the other previous fallout games but instead of companions we have our friends. In which is what we expect from a game that is advertised as such. 
---
Here's a copy and paste of that statement from Bethesda's fallout76  Amazon game description. 
---
" Reclamation Day, 2102. Twenty-five years after the bombs fall, you and your fellow Vault Dwellers‚Äîchosen from the nation‚Äôs best and brightest ‚Äì emerge into post-nuclear America. Play solo or join together as you explore, quest, build, and triumph against the wasteland‚Äôs greatest threats. " 
---
Maybe this will chill out the scorched üòéüòéüòé
---
Or... and bear with me on this.... they could have continued improving the franchise without changing the entire fallout experience
---
Like they keep saying in their "Inside the Vault", it will come out very soon.....
---
I think in March we might get something from what I read on here from a bethesda employee. 
---
Griefing has been getting worse and worse as players get bored and frustrated at nerfs.  I ended up quitting the game over this
---
I'm sorry if I triggered you. My condolences. 
---
Indeed it did my dude
---
my phone swaps cat and car  and people ask why i have a pet car. i meant cat. 
---
Or they could even make it so you can play single player without having random people ruin the game whenever you try to hop on 
---
No, like, you connect online and the server only existed for you, like you just added a password, anyone you told the password to could come.
---
That being said, D1 and D2 were isometric RPGs, their servers weren't as costly to run as FO76's.
---
Thats pretty much everything on my wish list :) Oh and add human npcs and factions so we can have turf wars. Then the game should be ready for full release
---
Again you are entitled to have low standards. Just don't expect people to put with this crap.
---
Should have done it like far cry with a main story with optional co-op and just Add a few public lobbies that arent limited to only 24 players 
---
Still are.  Broken clock is right twice a day.
---
The ruler of reddit has spoken!
---
I think she's a tool, personally. I've read another article or two from her in the past and they came off as little more than whining, but whatever, different views. I decided to read this new one and stopped dead partway through when I saw her make a claim about things just disappearing in the game like equipment, then link to another one of her whining posts to back it up, and then within \~that\~ post there was no actual evidence, just another link... to a reddit post. A fucking reddit post. By a dude who provided no evidence. That had about 400ish thumbs up. And which the author edited after making it to say that \~the issue was fixed\~. And, surprise, she did not include that information in her new article (probably because she didn't bother to go back and update herself).
---
So yea, Cass, if you're reading this: You are a terrible journalist and probably a terrible gamer, which is why you write terrible articles about gaming. Please get the slightest bit of journalistic integrity and learn how to research and properly cite reasonable sources. 
---
I'm thinking like Battlefield 3/4
---
They‚Äôve outsourced their player testing team to their paying customers, apparently. We shouldn‚Äôt have to tell them that an end boss that requires a lot of resources to kill and drops no or shit loot isn‚Äôt going to be popularity with the player base... 
---
I just want a working game
---
I don't get it. What do you mean they're throwing in the towel? The "inside the vault" stated making positive changes to scorchbeasts. Plus, asking the community for ideas for things is what they should be doing. It would be better if they add things that we actually want, not stuff we didn't ask for because they have no idea what we want.

i drop a brown bag in the middle of floor just outside Artisan Corner

but recently haven't seen many players go inside there so i was thinking of overseers camp since EVERYBODY has to go there
---
When you speculate that something 'can't be saved', you are in the realm of prediction, and it has been shown that prediction (even among experts) is wholly unreliable.
---
I'm also not sure how you can respect most games journalists these days, they're just as bad as youtubers in terms of lack of research and stirring the pot. Plus all that native advertisement creeping into most of the sites is hilariously bad.
---
Fertile soil takes about 3 minutes from start to finish
---
I will try my best to explain some of the problems here. 
---
At the beginning a little bit of context. I really want metal armour plans. So I found out that you get them as quest rewards in TV, AH and SD, but nothing more concrete (This would be perfect for a wiki). I tried for days (only a few hours a day though) to find them.
---
First, you have to find a fitting event. Usually, they only start when a player is near. So I travel around to start some. **Grafton Day** is a given, but no plans so far. The asylum rarely spawns events. Workshops tend to only give workshop items so I avoid them. So finding an event is really hard sometimes.
---
Next, the events themself are huge time sinks. E.g. **Patrol Duty** takes ages. The protectron moves really slowly (and only while you are next to it) and if there any super mutants  left alive, well you have to find and kill them. This takes so long and might not give you what you want.  Other quests like **Feed the People** are on a time and you cannot finish them faster. All events are designed to be time sinks (nothing really surprising for a game with MTX), which makes information gathering really hard. Especially,  for casual players. The cherry on top here is, that most of us follow a routine (get caps from vendors, explore, make additions to C.A.M.P.), which leaves little room for information gathering. 
---
Then there is the problem with changes through patches. Some information just becomes useless over time. Plans are more accessible, perks change, cap stashes change and much, much more. Everything is in flux. A wiki would need constant updates to stay relevant.
---
There are also some minor points, like damage reduction (DR) is very likely identical to fo4 (that's why high damage attacks out perform high dps), but there is no complete confirmation. Or that streamers and YouTube's and their communities, who are good contributors to wikis, are kinda MIA. 
---
And last, many of the data gathering type people are held up by compiling data for *bugs*. This might sound strange, but there are players that try their hardest to find the source of certain bugs and glitches.
---
It just seams like, that right now is not a good time for this games wiki pages. And the question is if there ever will be time.
---
... I wish, I made a tldr
---
"I really like to hunt other players.  Please nerf them."
---
:-)
---
I would probably be more interested in PvP if I wasn't holding onto 1400+ caps worth of junk that I'll have to sell the next day. It only takes a couple of hours to amass that as well. So I play another character while I feel like I can't afford to play on my main (I don't have a mule) but it ends up with the same problem faster because I know what I'm doing now. So now I have 3 characters, and i don't even really want to be playing the 3rd, I want to play my main. But not enough to risk losing all my sales for the next vendor. 
---
Try to use a dragon on it. I use my TSE dragon. First get close to them without shooting. Vats, shoot. Then the bot will start circling and you are reloading at the same time. The next round that the cargo boy came close, vats and shoot. Cargo bot down. 
---
ok cool
---
It's a random event, a reference to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin)
---
The article reflects how I feel as well. 
---
Watoga HS is good yeah. On avg I come out with about 130 plastic 
---
Easter egg,  it is the pied piper.  Kill the bot and the rats become enemies 
---
Ya dude it‚Äôs just lacking, with so many ‚Äúwhy‚Äù decisions. After a certain point you step back and look at it scratching your head. 
---
This kinda started with fallout 4 and it just being too easy. Giving up the power Armor so early in the game was waaaay to silly. Not having decisions alter really anything kinda took the fun right out of it.
---
Power Armor was just op and was impervious to laser and plasma like the prior games. Ammo types served a purpose in older fallouts.
---
The map ‚ÄúBoston‚Äù was really boring. The whole commonwealth thing just didn‚Äôt do it for me...why not focus on the enclave and the military more? 
---
They need to reboot fallout 1 and 2‚Äôs story. Add characters like Sulik, add places like New Reno where it‚Äôs a lawless city where the criminals survive with poor starving junkies,thieves and fights on the street. Add real threats like the Master, experiments on deathclaws,add enemies of the brotherhood like the Enclave. Bring the highwayman back. 
---
All the funny random encounters are gone, there‚Äôs no hype for luck trait like older games.
---
Even fallout 1 and 2 has better gore and finishers, the weapons were way cooler like the pancor jackhammer, the .223 pistol, and melee strikes knocking npc‚Äôs right the fuck out (get‚Äôem Sulik). Enemies use to run away when they were outnumbered.
---
If you dislike this game you're *still* a bandwagon hater? Really?
---
Guess I'd rather be that than a blind fanboy. 
---
The PVP is litterally what made me uninstall
---
That is the most half-A one of those posts yet by them, good grief... they are barely asking questions about which monsters we find interesting or what kind of loot makes things worthwhile? 
---
That last question about would we 'like' more challenging creatures in the future that require team play and 'WHY'?  Seriously B, I'm not going to write you an essay that your designers should have a pulse on with this community on a question that is basically a rhetorical question at best.  
---
This inside the vault article makes me feel like they have zero understanding of their player base at all and really makes it extremely hard for me not to feel alienated.  
---
W-o-w.......... is all I can say. 
---
&gt;Wonder whats on TV.....
---
I should replay fallout 4 and make a ninja character/survival playthrough.
---
Hell I'd replay fallout 3, I never finished it anyway :(
---
You mean like the vaults which should've opened by now? Those are probably gonna take another year at this rate of updates.
---
it was also a good in game jump in armor class i remember just right before proper power armor :D
---
I saw it like two days ago and just thought about, couldn‚Äôt really think of the tune. I wanted to kill em all...
---
I don't have any issue with the way PVP is in the game right now, but it definitely seems like a waste of effort to continue developing that. They should be focusing on improving co-op and social aspects of the game, especially when it's been billed and presented that way since the announcement. Rebuild Appalachia *together*. PVP has a part in that, but only a minor one. Without some serious love, the will never be an in-game community like what would be required to make it really feel like what they promised.
---
I've seen a lot of great ideas on how to improve that feeling, suck as the ham radio idea posted a few days back, and the idea of combining camps into a community mega camp, etc. Fantastic ideas from people who are all looking to find community in this game, but unable to because it hasn't been developed. There's so much potential for this game to be truly unique and awesome. I just hope the developers catch on to that, instead of focusing on PVP and other things that nobody actually wants.
---
Then what‚Äôs the point of having those plans drop I‚Äôve had both
---
Not sure if we read each other's posts correctly.....
---
Rad worms, rad worms for days, I really hope they patch this bug next patch.
---
Rad worms currently buffs/nerfs stats, mutations, perks(even ones not equipped) and mods on armor/weapons by 50%.
---
And than when you heal it, everything changes til the next time a ghoul gets within 20 ft of you and gives it to you again.
---
And getting power armor was wonderful especially gaining back that perception
---
Tad bit unconventional but I sometimes go to supermutant locations and clear them, at higher levels a good amount of them carry charging laser sniper rifles (especially at the prison yard) that produce plastic (I think it 4-6 plastic?) alongside other resources with scrapper, I get caps, grenades and xp in the process so it‚Äôs a good multi-purpose farm.
---
Otherwise the prison and school cafeterias are typically my go to with all the trays and utensils.
---
I read yours as "you still are a bandwagon hater." 
---
I agree with the SBQ being locked so some level as I've seen plenty of level 20s and lower. I did One Violent Night on my level 14 account and was more useful that the level 40 guy that started it. I killed everything but the Wendigo. The level 42 guy just ran away before it even showed up.
---
Behind the clubhouse at whitespring there‚Äôs a trash can full of plastic utensils next to a golf cart and a whole bunch of golf balls laying around
---
Would have loved to have had mine on me last night but was in stash.

I mean are we talking about size or actual fixes lol?
---
Stolen power armor remember ? the first was in Cold Water i think mission
---
Calling them chimps is racist 
---
Oh okay you were just quoting.
---
Like the way you put up with these nuts in your face

Protip: dont go inside the hotel like that. There are hidden turrets. 
---
Why not
---
Learn to read. CHUMP. 
---
I always bring one on me for the cargo bot and SB. Very effective to kill them. If you have two you can shoot one and change to another and shoot again. 
---
I don't know. If you look at Fallout 4 problems it had a lot to do with lead developers, namely Emil Pagliarulo. He pushed the idea of a 4-way hardcoded dialogue, which gave huge problems to budget, time and writing. Probably that's why there is almost no impactful dialogue choices in FO4.
---
well then i am proud of killing him in honour fight... well with tons of perks from new reno boxing XD
---
I don't follow. 
---
What I initally tried to say was I was one of the people who gave up on this game at launch and saw it for how terrible and awful it truly was from the start, and when I tried to warn others, people dismissed my opinion and called me just another bandwagon hater.
---
Only if it included some sort of Friendly Fire. I hate games without it. I know it's easy to grief with FF but it adds a layer of difficulty and stress to help make the game more enjoyable.
---
My brother and I have had a year long running joke about the one guy working on battlefront 2 post launch content after that game was torpedoed (but is actually really enjoyable).
---
Fallout 76 gas felt very similar.
---
Three things that need a desperate fix: 
---
-Sneaking: This one seems bugged since last patch. I made a post about this already. 
---
-3* Legendary enemies should only drop 3* items
---
They are pretty rare and absolutly not rewarding if they mostly drop 1* 
---
Increase spawn rate of 3* enemies or make them drop 3* more often. 
---
-Enemy health bug: This bug makes any fast firing gun useless and a waste of ammo. I have the issue on my TSE hardened Handmade rifle. 
---
ESO is awesome if you like that style of game. I didnt like that style and I still loved it so...i dont have a point.
---
Your camp comes in at different servers too, same place, When available. Same thing. 
---
I was just using MMOs as an example of an online service that provides semi regular updates, you SERIOUSLY should not be using any modern MMO as a positive example of sustainable content.  Most MMOs these days simply provide the illusion of content by forcing players through daily treadmills for gear that ends up as junk within a few patches anyway.
---
MMOs are designed to be the kind of games that you log into every single day and spend hours grinding away on.  As hard as it is for some people to understand 76 is not and never will be an MMO.
---
Anthem and Division 2 is around the corner.
---
ESO Morrowind event happening now.
---
Then I have Battlefield 5 to play with clan mates.
---
This game is already in my "parked" list... may or may not return to it depending if there's new content and/or dramatic changes for the better.
---
Cold water and the stolen armor. Wasn't that set broken though? You just gained the rank to buy it?
---
Excuse me they added a dart board. And a buncha stupid clothes no one wants.
---
It was one of the ones posted above, but if you have seen old antique radios the circle parts on the bottom of the statue face look like speakers. 
---
I WISH!!!!!!
---
I wont be home for a few hours but if you want to add me my in game name is the same as reddit name.
---
Lvl 104. I've never had one drop. EVER. Meh.
---
yeah but it unlocked ( for me ) just right after cold water so i though you have to bring back those PA's to get access to quartermasters PA's so many years wrong....
---
It would have been a better game as a solo game.  Great areas to explore, decent story.  Basic story line could have stayed the same; you are the new overseer as the people are pushed from the vault because of lack of food.  You have to get towns going, provide protection, then as you progress in the story have to get enough supplies so everyone can get back into the vault for hundreds of years. 
---
Plenty of areas for quests.  Expanded on the building and cities from FO4.  Expanded on the trading and automation since you would need to direct people to act as defense.
---
I have 70+, and even calling them in from the transmission tower near the cranberry bog gives me junk.
---
wow, thats a great idea!!! i would start up new characters so quick if i knew i had a cool spot waiting when i get out of the vault.  
---
Listen here, you ape
---
Exctamundo!!
---
Well I stated from before launch I was worried about what Bethesda Austin can really bring to the table and now it seems those worries are justified. 
---
Did you have the same thought?
---
Yeah fucking over mules was the final straw for me. Haven't logged in since I read those patch notes. I keep subscribed to the sub in hopes that a patch will come out to magically fix  everything but I don't have much hope to hold on to. 
---
Then you just factor in the levels of participating players. The math would be like base hp + sum(level of players) x hp multiplier but cap the modifier otherwise you wind up with a few level 300s summoning death upon Appalachia
---
Woah woah woah‚Ä¶
---
There‚Äôs a Miss Nanny transferred to a Synth body in FO4???
---
You'll be back.
---
Best high level weapons in game are made from ultracite.

Un excuse me I'll have you know that the Pink Castle bed is one of my favorite things from the Atom Shop. You're just jelly because you don't have a Pink Castle bed and can therefore never be able to live out your dream of being a pretty pretty princess
---
This is it right here. Gatling guns with prime receivers destroy SBs.
---
None of this is helpful, downvote.
---
Honestly, I thought fallout 4 had its own brilliant aspects, and got my usual 1k+ hours out of it as I did every other fallout. The thing that bothers me is this game is basically what fallout 4 would be with just the new map and multiplayer added. It was a cool concept but if they wanted to use fallout they should have made it a coop game, with the falllout world fans expected rather then this barebones mmo/arpg hybrid abomination that takes some of the elements from each game while discarding the most important elements from both lmao. 
---
At this point they should just hire Chris Roberts to write up better bullshit in these Inside the Vault segments, at least he'll acknowledge everything we complain about, and then sell us JPG's for weapons and armor coming 'soon' for legit large amounts of money to sustain infinite development for Beth to someday finish this game.  
---
every time i have run it - i get the recorded voice saying - kill noted battlefield award - not just for legendary - and you also always get it for  the scorch beasts and ANY scorched animal.
---
You never did the curie questline? I guess they didnt really lead you to her
---
I think I‚Äôd settle for disease immunity. I‚Äôm in a reinforced man portable tank that in lore could take on Chinese divisions of conventional infantry, and can keep a soldier alive in an nbc environment. But the second a large cockroach hisses at my boot I‚Äôve got blood worms. 
---
Hell just setting off nukes should open new fissures or caves releasing hordes of enemies. Not to mention boosting existing creatures (similar to glowing ones) health, defense, attack, etc.
---
Just run to the first barrier, change instance repeat - 4 trips is quite a lot. 
---
Fix the Railway rifles please 
---
Sure thing ! :)
---
Why am I confused on this post? Have you made it to end game? Again why am I so confused?
---
Sorry. You cant count the hot fixes since they were fixing what the new patch broke that the previous patch fixed what was originally released in the game.
---
So 3 weeks at best for one patch the rest have been a month apart and they add/change 3-6 things at a time, lolwut?
---
The first 2 patches were pretty good, added and changed stuff. I dont believe the game is a priority to them now but hey, I'd like to be wrong and see a patch note length worth of changes like the patch that changed the stash limit the first time.
---
40 minute quest like, bruh that's a fecking embarrassment, they need to fix the game before they add stuff, I stopped playing fallout 76 2 week after release because I had done everything that the game had to offer :/ shame it had a lot of potential and Bethesda ruined it
---
Actually, MMO patches have a lot more details than this, like ESO.
---
its almost always open - fusion core spawn site.
---
What about the mk 2 power armor in the fridge?
---
And how often do those patches come out?  I'm doubting every other week.
---
what fridge...
---
I was level 7 and say a scorched conquerer and thought. Oh no I‚Äôm so dead. But a couple clips of a pipe rifle and some Molotov‚Äôs it was dead...
---
true, actually
---
Curie, the miss nanny companion from vault 81  if you complete her questline you go to the memory den and put her conciousness in a synth.
---
Romancing her opens up even more questions...
---
If you like it, buy it. Who gives a shit what others think or say...
---
This seems like a trap.  Last time people complained about TSE's the screwed that nerf up making most ranged and ALL explosives useless AND took away White Knight too.... 
---
Be sure to drink your Ovaltine.
---
I could play other games. I don‚Äôt think porting is an issue 
---
Same I was level 4 all night last night.
---
I'm sure there are aspects of game architecture that are significantly different from traditional web servers, but I've architected enterprise apps for years, and can't wrap my head around how this could be such a problem. Don't loot drop rolls happen on the server?  We have to avoid duplicates with any distributed system. It's what keeps network hiccups from accidentally doubling orders, payments, etc on pretty much every cloud app. Why wouldn't every player/item combination have a UUID and be done with it? Transfer of an item would invalidate the old one and create a new ID in the new player's inventory.
---
If you dig into anything you can break it in 15 minutes. 
---
There‚Äôs tons of new assets in the game. There‚Äôs Appalachia specific critters, playable musical instruments that can jam together, giant megastructures that dig minerals. 
---
Oh yea, she dead. Any hope I once had for the game is now gone. I‚Äôd like them to prove me wrong tho. 
---
All my friends moved on with no intent to even come back, the only one that plays still is one that wants 100% trophies, but he is bugged and logs to see if its fixed once in awhile. I left and bought God of War till Kingdom Hearts 3 came out. Now i have new dragonquest after that.. At first i said when they do content.. but all patches are is fixing the broken shit so its shelved, 1 friend quit after about a week or two and they wouldnt even take the game.
---
Oh I'm gonna!
---
Ive gotten rare weapons like tesla rifles and handmades from them b4 but usually low level 
---
Heh. Ok. Thx.
---
how so? What would you suggest?
---
The sheer lack of number of fixes to me seems like either 1 person or a very small number of people are left to work on the game based on what we can infer from that very minimal ITV.  
---
I'm betting the scorch beasts will start dropping mats as better 'loot' whether by intent or by the ingenuity of the coders over there when they should be dropping bonafied legendary weapons &amp; armor to be worth the heavy resource expenditures. 
---
Problem is, now they are just going to make all the bosses harder to require you to co-op instead of add new content. 
---
Hahaha :)
---
mmorpg is "Many Men Online Role playing Girls"
---
I think most people are waiting for their canvas bag.
---
Can I get a Thirst Zapper so my friends can stay hydrated?
---
glad there are still people from my times it is so nice to talk about childhood game even if its not anymore in its shape anymore
---
Thanks great work!
---
No, boss characters (one's with crowns in their name) were dropping 10+ items.  In on glowing one that was a boss I had 42 items drop.  That's what they fixed, getting 'too much' loot. 
---
TSE is also OP in fallout 4, an laser an explosiv is really not the bedst ither..
---
Heh. When does my license expire?
---
you know.... this is actually great idea XD i dont care i like it adding to the list
---
See this post for more details on what's broken about the costume hats. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anaav4/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_armor/
---
you're using literally every term edgelords use whilst calling me an edgelord
---
I like this a lot! They could bolt it on to the existing game with an orbital platform or asteroids accessed by a space-based elevator, similar to the Alaska DLC.
---
Low polygon count in space would give us all the budget we need for badass large-scale space constructs. And obviously you can‚Äôt bring all your earth-based plans up there, so they could even tailor the structures and accessories to scale appropriately.
---
Do you use the same tower, or another?
---
And that doesn't stink of pressure from management to push out the game asap to you? He was probably just trying to piggy back off a semi working system to save time since he didn't have much.
---
[Everything](https://tenor.com/0peX.gif) 
---
Had a random problem similar to this the other day on my Xbox. I ended up having to shut down and unplug Xbox for a few minutes. Let it reset. Random question..... Did you get an offer from Xbox live for an avatar item for playing a different game? I did before this happened. Once I tried to redeem all went to shit.n after I reset Xbox offer was gone. 
---
As opposed to all those other games made by billion dollar companies out of nothing but their love for gamers that they give away for free with no MTX? 
---
I laughed a little to hard at this.
---
Yep. I have friends who would have bought the game and be playing with me now if that was the case. I would have brought in at least 4 new folks into the Fallout fold.
---
Two- shot and explosive were never on the same weapon in Fallout 4 though.  Yeah, each was OP in Fallout 4, so they took two OP effects and combined them... for a multiplayer game? What sense does that make?
---
There is at least two events related to pvp, first if monster mash and second is hunter/hunted. I don't think you lose/gain caps until the event is finished, but it's somewhat of an arena. I've only done monster mash though
---
Yet another person crying about PVP... You should just feel lucky that it isn't always on by default like in other open world survival games (like Ark, Rust, Conan). Also base building takes like no resources apart from flux for a rad shower, someone could come destroy my base 100 times and I could repair it by clicking a button (if i didn't just pay some caps to move it slightly and fix everything for free). 
---
I play solo and have zero problems crushing anything with either melee or a gun that steps in my way, and the only build strategy I followed was "do damage and have defense." There should be more PVE activities and better ones, but some of the best in-game experiences I've had were team v. team PVP fights. The "reward" for fighting other players is the fight itself, the junk and caps are just extra
---
I tried unplugging already and same result. And no I didn‚Äôt get no msgs :(
---
I can craft shielded casual on pc. 
---
re logging takes you back to EXACTLY the same instance as long as you log back in immediately. 
---
The mobs are scaled - go in alone with decent sneak and melee killing ability and its very manageable.
---
Wait, is this really the only way? "have they fixed this bug yet?"
---
Diverse server offering fragments the already dwindling player base and lowers the revenue from atom shop whales. So why should they fix it?
---
I think they should have had a co-op only server and then a pvp only server, with level based servers so you dont have a level 300 shitting on level 1s fresh out of the vault. I also think they should have more people on a server and a party finder option
---
You can glitch into people's locked camps using a workbench by a window
---
Quest added  
---
#AIN'T THAT A KICK IN THE DICK
---
Also have 70+ dont get time for them, i also what to know what the best tower is
---
At this point I would not be surprised if there was a larger team devoted to the atom shop than to the main game maintenance 
---
If you block someone they can still track you and join your game and have a friend locate you relentlessly
---
It would be easier to fix it by knocking FO5 out of the park than by salvaging FO76.
---
Yes according to the game files, this is the only way. And no, it is not fixed yet.
---
I avoid griefers by not playing the game
---
Sometimes i leave dumb grafitti with the small letters set half hidden on camps of random players i've been on the same team with.. 
---
So if you find "Kilroy was here" or some other dumb stuff on your wall behind some bushes, it probably is my fault.
---
It also pisses me off how stepping in power armor actually lowers my strength too. The only way for me to simply gain carry weight is with Excavator armor (havent gotten X-01 shocks yet)
---
Not sure what the point of this post is. Nothing about this situation would change if they did what OP is asking. 
---
What cheating have you done to think you have been banned
---
That's what I expected when I saw the reaction to the beta. Why would they make all that cool planned content if everyone seems to hate this game? Even then, what I didn't expect was the patches for basic gamebreaking glitches to be rolling in this slowly.
---
Ur right, an it make no sense..  I should have formulated that phrase somewhat better ..
---
Watoga HS, Morgantown HS, and WhiteSprings are my go-to spots.
---
My character absolutely, positively wants hot pink power armor and matching pipgirl.  
---
I‚Äôm down for this
---
I've played tactics more recently than I've played NV lol. I loved that it came with the toolkit. I played the hell out of it and did some minor modding later to make it more fun on further playthroughs. Tbh Beth kinda fucked up only giving us human as playable characters. I'm willing to bet a lot of people would enjoy playing a super mutant, a ghoul, a deathclaw or maybe one of those weird humanoid death machine robots from tactics. 
---
"the nerf" does include all the aspects there, the perks, the armor, all the nerfs.. dont blind focus on TSE alone..
---
and yeah i can get into why people are pissed, i am too..
---
it was the one thing in this game that was at least something..
---
the endgame content in this game =  legendary farming.. it was all the endgame except the SBQ.. which was bugged as well on several sides..
---
first the xp buff (didnt matter for me very much i didnt do whitesprings, it was allways emptied anyway, also i am lvl 130), but now i try to level up a new guy.. a melee..
---
even then its just not fun anymore.. i spend most of my time finding myself walking in nothing and just dieng instead of healing cuz its way cheaper.
---
they ruined the one fun part, that worked for the most part.. that is why people are pissed..
---
and yeah, it did spill into smaller things, but at this point its what they deserve imho.
---
i had high hopes, ok.. todd tells us its new, give us credit.. we did.. massively.. and also paid 60 euro..
---
this was a joke at launch, but okay.. credit + todd = yeeee fallout !!!
---
right now the credit is draining really fast with a lot of people... and taking the last fun part out.. yeah that was the one that did it.
---
TL;DR
---
I am confident everyone wanted this to succeed, but it's turning into an insult now that the goodwill seems to be drying up.
---
I have a mass inventory but haven‚Äôt been duping or letting people see it for months  
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I don‚Äôt PVP and I never will. I don‚Äôt play any Fallout game with the thought or hope of PvP in mind. Feels like they‚Äôre wasting A LOT of time, energy and resources pursuing things that don‚Äôt matter while losing players and goodwill all along the way. I‚Äôm sure there are a million better things they could be fixing and adding... like some FALLOUT content and not colorful/flashy Fortnite bs. 
---
The live game *is* the Public Beta Environment.
---
you are absolutely right my post died downvoted and the topic was to start as a mutant in wes tek after being captured by mutants and you can be ditched to vats of goo 
---
lol that works
---
My issue is that FO76 cant make up it's mind of what it wants to be. Either be a fairy la-la PvE game or be a hardcore survival game. None of this half-assed approach to both.
---
I'm sorry for your loss
---
I was hoping for Fallout but centered around Borderland's style of gameplay. What I wanted was to kill Deathclaws with my 3 friends. Not deal with insane bullet sponges and constant server crashes. 
---
Have you just recently started playing? People have been farming that place for plastic for a while now.
---
We need them to address the VATS issues crit meter not filling on every shot and people at 33 luck used to be able to chain critical shots can‚Äôt do that anymore
---
Well, the upgrades that allow you to turn it into an actual weapon.
---
I give it till the end of summer. Maybe by then Bethesda woke up and really fixed the issues or it will have gotten worse to a point the company successfully destroyed their own game. My bet is on the latter...
---
ESO is in a pretty awesome state right now after that horrible launch. 
---
Eh. I don't care about downvotes. TSE was OP for both PvP and PvE.
---
Different ones usually
---
Playing about a month now, I've been sticking to the left side of the map, discovering all the locations there. I only came across this place the other night. 
---
Honestly what did you expect from Bethesda? 
---
Lone Wanderer and Fireproof. You don't need Rad Resistance perk.
---
Harvest plant weekly and daily challenges DON'T WORK
---
Think 76 as co-op would be considerably more like stardew valley which sounds interesting. Building settlement, crops, ect
---
Guy in my last playthrough was going on some kind of sick rampage throughout Appalachia. He launched a nuke into the left most corner of the map (inaccessible part), accrued a bounty of at least 850 by the time I left the server, and didn't seem to care who was after him and who wasn't. I was at a workshop when I heard the commotion. I normally don't go after bounties because I don't care enough to chase someone for a few measly caps. I see that he has a high bounty and I think "That's a lot of caps. I should at least go check it out". So, I run to see what all the hubbub is about. I guess he and his little sidekick thought I was after him because when I get close enough, they immediately attack me. My shot gun didn't even put a dint in this guy. He then one-hits me with a mole-miner gauntlet. I respawn at my workshop and decide to just leave it be. They find me less than a minute later and his sidekick super jumps to my position and one-hits me again. They then precede to follow me back to my camp after I respawn just to get away. They kill me again and destroy my camp. Just going to town on it. I respawn outside my camp and just watch the carnage. I leave the server before they can spot me again. 
---
And so, that's why I don't go after bounties. Especially ridiculously high bounties.
---
SBQ is killable.... I have many times.
---
That would be really cool. It's not like every game has to have a character from a vault. Bethesda has done 3x the vault dwellers as anyone else
---
You people are really unreasonable and immature. You also lack any ability to think. 
---
No inside the vault has ever talked about everything they are planning or working on in the next patch. Whatever they tell us, there's always way more they don't mention when a patch comes. 
---
The inside the vaults are just a glimpse into ***some of the things they are looking at and working on***. 
---
But you all take it as it's the only thing that will be addressed. 
---
And most of the time, the stuff they do talk about, are always in response to some of the most talked about subjects in this reddit. In this case, they told us about plans to change the sonic attack, fix the scorched beast queens loot tables. Stuff some of you have been bitching and bitching about to no end. 
---
Some of you don't even read all the Inside the Vaults, and think it's been weeks and weeks since the last one. 
---
How many of you saw this [link in the January 31st post](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language=en&amp;_ga=2.173491427.1580236479.1549582391-2063107590.1542636802)?
---
A list of things of bugs and things they are working on that are some of their top focus. Take this one line from there.
---
 **Power Armor and/or Weapons Renaming**
---
* **STATUS:** We are looking into this as an option for an update later in the year.
---
And yet, if you go and do a search, you'll find numerous posts since the 31st asking for this. Post where' it's clear they didn't have any idea that it was already addressed.   
---
There's bugs listed in that which they hope to address in patch 6. Like Bear Arms. 
---
Sorry, but you guys are all angry about the game, the issues, and how Bethesda communicates. But you really don't seem to do anything to keep informed. And they aren't hiding it. They post links here, on twitter. You freak out if the forums at Bethesda are down, like it's some conspiracy, but never stop to think if it's just for maintenance. 
---
You people make this reddit terrible. 
---
Now please, dump all over me and call me names for pointing out your behavior.
---
Because there are a LOT of things that have been requested, reported, etc., including a bunch of problems introduced from their last 2 patches, and the only thing they're fixing next is scorchbeasts. Along with the fact that they've already received tons of feedback that they need to be looking at. 
---
Thank you, I feel much better now. :)
---
I know, I played the beta, during that time I was having fun, yeah there were lots of problems but it was a beta so I cut them some slack. 
---
Then the game came out and it was an absolute shit show, for the first week there was a bug that meant that a lot of players on a one x couldn‚Äôt fast travel or open perk packs because it was literally crashing the game I posted about that and I got told ‚Äúno it‚Äôs not Bethesda it‚Äôs the consoles fault stop whining‚Äù then that issue got fixed after absolutely no acknowledgement. I got downvoted and told to stop hating on the game when I was only criticising it because I love Fallout. 
---
Now this sub is essentially a pit of negativity.
---
It feels like they are doing nothing by not addressing some of the biggest problems impacting the game...problems that their fixes made worse. And then they want to advertise their shop items at the end of it. It just doesn't look good.
---
Salt here is nice, you say?
---
Pot. Kettle.
---
Giving up? Shit they never even made a serious attempt.
---
Sadly, it currently is. 
---
Chances are, however, that adding a public test server will make things infinitely better. Not only will it reduce the magnitude of bugs on release of these updates, but most players probably won't even know about the test servers, they'll just be excited about the quality of the updates going out.
---
It's a tie between server stability and lack of endgame content. 
---
Honestly that's all after another week. If anyone would spend time on this forums or in-game one could have answerd all that questions they ask... For me it looks like a time-play.
---
We act like we ask something for the future. Bet this team of developers isnt bigger than 4-6 ppl anymore..  
---
They basically gave up on this title... To rip it around they should habe been much further so far. Not even the stash limit is increased after 2 month or so... And the lack of content drives many players away already.
---
Would like to see the stats compared to Fallout shelter... Was the better success by far I guess
---
It‚Äôs a shit game. Why is there a sub for it ?
---
Tesla is actually ballistic, which I admit is weird.
---
Honestly, I'd prefer small scale multiplayer with friends, like the way Divintiy Or9ginal Sin 2 does it.
---
1-4 players, I know them all, we can play together and affect the world. There can be human NPCs, we can play how we want, we can be raiders, we can be BoS Paladino, etc
---
Not every game needs to be an MMO
---
bethesda can see ur inventory 
---
You sure it wasn't the RadBedbugs?
---
Careful a large amount of them are probably broken. Just like the ones people already got. Diffrence being they probably wont fix a marked down product.
---
TBH the cashgrabby nature of the game was obvious from the beginning, but i played on because hey, i had my fun. But with my sole playthrough done i have had all the fun the game will ever offer me, i sadly think.
---
I am with you brother! Dyslexic, if the game doesn't read it I dont either.
---
I found I rather enjoy YouTube channels that play the game because many of them will read aloud the notes.
---
More like give us shouts let us fus-roh-dah those bitches back to oblivion

Did you get a different legendary?  
---
Or none?
---
I can recommend it. Got my copy for $4 second hand. Best $4 spent in a long while.

This right here sums up the totality of 76‚Äôs non-bug issues.  They set out to make a MP game that also needed the ability to be soloed for that crowd yet allowed PvP to take place at virtually any time.  I applaud the audacity but in the end it might have been a fools errand.
---
lol you're big mad
---
Wow that's so low Bethesda. 
---
You couldn't implement 1 new feature so far. The alarm clocks where there and you had the chance to rip it around. The players where there. But not a single new quest. Not a single new event. Not even the player shops were implemented announced so far.
---
No stash, caps, or camp budget increase. Only nerfs and half baked patches. I mean, thanks for the fixes. But no.. just no.. You didn't even try to make this a better game so far...
---
Step 1: Throw the weapons you mentioned into the deepest lake.
---
Step 2: Get some unyielding armor.
---
Step 3: Get a bloodied+fast swing weapon. 
---
Step 4: Get Radicool perk.
---
Step 5: Get about 50% of your health bar filled with rads.
---
Step 6: Kill 98.7% of mobs in this game in one hit.
---
That had over 150 bug fixes and changes.
---
I can understand and respect this viewpoint.
---
loot container search isn't really producing any special items, so i don't see why it would be a problem
---
Well, that still doesn‚Äôt get to my question. Not using VATS perks doesn‚Äôt give you more damage; the only perks that will give a rifle more damage are in Perception; VATS is all Luck. 
---
Having VATS perks doesn‚Äôt mean you have to use them 24/7. They are just always available when it makes sense to use them. I manually snipe fairly often on my Sniper, although usually that‚Äôs due to weird VATS detection issues like where it won‚Äôt detect through a fence (but you can shoot through it). At high levels, especially running an Unyielding build with ~30 perception, I have 95%hit almost to the limit that VATS will target. The other problem is that rifle(gun in general...) ranges really aren‚Äôt that far before you start getting damage drop off. I‚Äôd almost wager it‚Äôs about the same distance as VATS stops detecting. Beyond that you‚Äôre doing less damage just due to range. 
---
That being said it‚Äôs all about utility vs damage when it comes to SPECIAL/perks. My sniper is all-in on damage. 1/15/1/4/5/15 build, running around at 20% health with Adrenaline, Nerd Rage, and Unyielding. It‚Äôs a lot of damage; I just need to replace my AA Lever Action with a bloodied version :)

Thank you for making my internal reading voice switch over to Sean Connery for a single word.
---
If you're on PS4, I'd be happy to hang out and see if we can't make it more fun in a team. 
---
I suppose the point is the scorched are supposed to be whoever they were before the disease/infection took them. 
---
Which is not at all reflected in the scorched at all. Weirdly it is in the ghouls. A *lot* of firemen and soldier ghouls. But the scorched are just ‚Äúdefault enemy number 3‚Äù
---
Like I‚Äôd expect in and around cranberry bog to find a lot of bos scorched, complete with high end energy weapons. 
---
In and around whitesprings a lot of military personnel themed scorched. 
---
Around all the other vaults, vault suit wearing scorched. 
---
But nope. Everyone‚Äôs just wearing the same shredded black onesie. And they can attack you with a machete but drop a switchblade. 
---
For being part of the big bad of 76 they do seem to have less variety than mole rats.
---
There's an app for that. I mean a perk card.
---
Wow this post sounds like something I could have posted word for word.  You know a game is terrible when you feel embarrassed letting other people know you ordered the Power Armor Edition (I did) Instead of people thinking hmmm that‚Äôs a really cool helmet , most are thinking hmmm damn that guy got ripped off even worse than I did, at least I only lost out on $60 and not $200
---
Warframe, then.
---
Huh, I don‚Äôt know then. I haven‚Äôt used a handmade all that much, my sniper has had better LA rifles and I haven‚Äôt felt like playing around with a handmade much.
---
I‚Äôm aware.  There‚Äôs also vegetable medley soup and antibiotics. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm lacking knowledge of how to gain disease resistance. 
---
It‚Äôs precisely as the post implies. 
---
When I was a lvl 10 I ran across this lvl 76 guy at his camp. He called for me and emojied. I was like yeah...no junk to loose why not? He says on the mic "help yourself but if you shoot me I'll kill you". He went through his stash but said the lowest level shit he has was 30. I told him thanks but no worries.  He then dropped a bag. 30 purified waters, 30 stim packs and 10 dog food. I didn't know what to say so I dumped the only thing of value I had...3 fusion cores. We thanked each other and I walked off. After about 10 meters I turned around only to find he and the entire camp were gone. He bounced out the server.
---
This blog post is disturbing for so many reasons.
---
Good news is, you still arent playing an MMO.  This is not an mmo unless someone can make a pitch that 25 people is somehow massive.
---
Yeah, I want some good PA paint. I don't play in PA but I like looking at it. Did the Nuka Cola paint quest just for that.
---
I'll spent real money on PA paint BUUUT the paint should only cost me $5. They can make it 1800atoms but then they need to sell me 2000atoms at $5 on special. Warframe frequently sells platinum at discounts so you can always stock up on platinum when they have specials running and spent the platinum through the year.
---
Also some good weapons paint. My The Division gear looks really good with its custom paints.
---
Anyhow as you can tell I am not against buying cosmetics, my kids desensitized me with all their Roblox purchases a long time ago.
---
It seems like a single player game with parts carved out to make room for multiplayer. There is not enough of a story adventure experience for the more single player types. There isn‚Äôt enough high speed action for a decent PvP experience. It‚Äôs kinda a real Frankenstein‚Äôs monster of single player game and multiplayer. None of the parts are exactly matching and it‚Äôs cumbersome and breaks stuff. 
---
No, the problem was that ***he*** designed the dialogue to be always in four choices, which he still think it was a 'game changing idea' (according to his presentation in Danemark).
---
In reality, forcing the game to have ***always*** four dialogue options, even when binary or singular replies were required made choices impossible, as every time you branch you have more 4 lines to write (and potentially to voice act). Just a waste of time and resources.
---
That's why people complain about the 4 'options': yes, no (yes), sacarstically yes, tell more.
---
...and the fucked up part is that people were fine with the silent protagonist. Skyrim and previous Fallout were massive commercial successes.
---
This guy wastelands.  
---
I tend to stay away from the overseer's chests.  I started up a melee alt last week and a friend left me some stuff, but the loot that was supposed to be there for me, including the holotape, overrode what she left inside.  I think it's ok if the person already looted the stash for quest items first and just checked it again the next day for some water and dog food, but I think the mandatory goodies in the container override whatever else someone placed in there.  She said that she made me a heated lvl 5 pitchfork and left 10 stims/water/rad-x/radaway but none were present.
---
I use the blue suitcases at vendors (Watoga and Pleasant Valley stations being most obvious) to leave stuff I don't want.  At Whitesprings Station, I use the sack next to the tinker's bench.  At Harper's Ferry, I use the cash register.  Phoenix is literally a stone's throw away from Watoga Station, so I don't drop anything at his spot.  If come across a lvl 5-20 legendary item of any quality, I'll mod it out for a few xp and try to find someone low level to give it to them for free, or leave it in the cash register at Flatwoods right in front of Bob.
---
My alt is now lvl 50 and I got a really epic plan haul in the sack at Whitesprings Station today.  About a dozen camp plans I didn't have, a marine wetsuit plan, plans for .44, tommy gun, super-sledge and lever gun plus a handful of fairly common mod plans for the T-51 power suit.  I left the tommy gun and lever plans for someone who actually uses those weapons, but I was really happy to get the .44, sledge and T-51 plans.  Not as great, but I left a few dozen excess plastic, gunpowder, steel, springs, stimpaks and assorted legendaries (including a lot of junk, but a pretty decent 3 star combat chest piece with bolstering/poison resist/less weapon weight and an instigating/faster fire rate harpoon gun of top level) that were too heavy to hang on to.  I would have hung on to the chest piece for my main sniper until my trusted buddies were online to do a swap, but the combat chest piece he has is just slightly better with extra sneak capability.

Just curious but are you clicking strength then picking an agility card?
