Show us on the doll where Bethesda hurt you...

I like that idea. We need a bigger CAMP budget for all these great ideas.  
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Why can't we store our CAMP budget in our memory so that it can be bigger (within a specified limit), then have it upload to the server when we log in?  Is there a reason why this isn't practical? 
---
Ah yes, I was in Whitespings last night, and managed hit a single robot due to gun-fu.  
---
Dang. Might as well not bother shooting the flying ones either.
---
Small one for me:  resource collector stack increase.  Having something that is a per hour but seems to cap after 20 minutes is absurd.
---
Screw those people as well 
---
I have something like 150 karma on the market but likely more than 200 downvoted from here. I don‚Äôt think the two say anything about the other
---
imo the only way to fix this game is to change it as a whole
---
I think Wendigos are what happens when cannibals become ghouls. Something about eating human flesh prior to turning ghoul makes them turn out like that. The last living member of the Gourmands was turned into a Wendigo.
---
You can add legendary mods to 3* making them 4*. I was asking if i was missing a way to make them 5's. Seems i can't.
---
I would also like to see this. Could be a "legendary player" kind of ability. 
---
Oh yeah, I do that too, screw defending 4 waves of ghouls, they can have it!
---
I also have had almost no issues. In fact I seem to have the opposite experience. Since the latest patch things seem to be much more stable / responsive. 
---
I am in North America as well, central time zone.
---
By chance are you doing a lot of SBQ fights?  I have suspected for a while when a server gets a bunch of folks together from different geographies that contributes a lot to stability.
---
*Wooo* It's your **5th Cakeday** Zjar! ^(hug)
---
I have a camp on Hole 6 east of the golf club. I wanted a beautiful camp so I decorated thoroughly and have no budget for turrets. As a result packs of ghouls (courtesy of randoms running over when aggroed) and assorted creatures and enemies slaughter my brahmin and wreck my shit on a regular basis. That said, it's been my favorite camp yet and I'll likely never move. Gorgeous location, near a river, and free snaptail whenever I need it.
---
I see people who build directly south of the club and it doesn't really bother me because it's one less annoyance to deal with. I get *why* people would be annoyed by that but the enemies there respawn every time someone new enters the area.
---
If they make my camp invalid or something I will never come back.
---
In whitsprings check the icebox by the clubhouse I put all my unused ammo there. 
---
I don‚Äôt know about that destiny for example had some terrible systems but over time they were able to correct them 
---
Oh, then I can give a sh*t too, I guess. Thought that the direct karma from Marketplace gets affected at some point. Good to know! 
---
Lol I‚Äôm 250, and regular bos combat armor lol is that it?? No top end legendary gear? Yeah like I said no chance.
---
Deeply concerning that it's not on the roadmap they released for 2019, though.
---
I get suicider molerats in the ash heap all the time.
---
Thought they were annoyance before? Nope, let's have them swallow a mini nuke That'll be a blast!
---
If I'm understanding you correctly, you are asking if you can Max out makeshift warrior to rank 5 for crafting, but also then having another set for on the go?
---
Cause that's how I do it as well, rank 5 makeshift warrior for when I'm crafting melee weapons/adding mods but I have a rank 2 set when I'm out traveling since I focus more on ranged weapons, so yes it's possible.
---
Well, if you‚Äôre going for a low health VATS build, stacking Unyielding primaries is the way to go, with maybe 1 Chameleon piece depending on how stealthy you already feel (my sniper runs 5x unyielding with Ultralight mods; I have a Chameleon chest I can swap in for PVP but it‚Äôs not necessary for me in PVE, my stealth is high enough without it.)
---
 Otherwise mix and match to cover the areas you want a boost in. 
---
Sentinels (if fully stacked) is -75% damage taken if not moving. If you sit still and fire a rifle but aren‚Äôt worried about stealth, you‚Äôre super tanky. Not ideal for a shotgun build but works just fine for any rifle setup, auto or not. Assassins is the PVP only one, so if you aren‚Äôt doing PvP you can ignore it. 
---
She's always lvl95. The only thing that changes is the amount of add's that spawn and her total hp pool. 
---
My apologies for asking on a subreddit of the game for a link to something accurate about said game. 
---
I know how to search, but like most things subreddits I follow, people are more knowledgeable about great resources or have created their own that are way better than most websites out there. For example, there are way more helpful maps and info here than most of the other Fallout sites I have come across. A lot of the FO76 sites have info that hasn't been updated since early November.
---
I know, I get it, these posts are annoying to some, but when you look at numerous sites that don't seem to have updated info, where else would you ask?
---
Nope, I don‚Äôt have it. Also don‚Äôt have 1, 7, 8 or 12. But I have 4 #11‚Äôs...
---
It's almost like they want you to buy atoms instead of getting them for free 
---
Here‚Äôs my upvote 
---
TL DR.
---
But I understand the message and agree 
---
It isn't exclusive to 76. All of the comments are about other games.
---
ur mom
---
Fair enough, whatever works üëç
---
[removed]
---
So is there such a thing as a fully sentinel set with chameleon 2*s and unyielding vanguard and weightless ? 
---
You can get them from NukaCrypt üëç
---
Just bought the game, getting here Tuesday. Can you set up camp in like a destroyed building and like refortify it?
---
*Game too easy
---
*Game tries to hard to cater to too many different things 
---
*It was a solo game dragged screaming into multiplayer
---
*He also has a ton of interesting suggestions well worth a watch even if you have to consume it a little at a time 
---
Sorry, I missed it completely. Need to add an /s tag at the end lol
---
I've been watching Jon for about a year now. His Fallout 3 video got me back into Fallout. I've been consuming as much fallout as I could since. I've watched all his series multiple times. Fallout 4 Frost 3 separate times. I love Jon's Fallout content. Love love love his content. Go watch him.
---
Saints Row style.
---
Just go see Wallace at Harper‚Äôs Fairy and he should have it. All vendors have all the plans they can sell now.
---
I got video 
---
Happend to me twice over the weekend.  I've only been able to down 1 SBQ since launch.  She either freezes/glitches OR the server crashes.  It's extremely frustrating considering this is the only end-game content.
---
My fear is that the devs are so entrenched in their bad decisions that something like changing weight to unique item ids for stash limits isn't even on the table. This stubbornness probably affects all the other suggestions too.
---
Tonight, I spent 20+ minutes, 4+ fusion cores, and 2,000+ rounds of 5.56 (furious, +10% aiming handmade), alongside ten+ other players to **fail** to take down the queen. I only saw one &lt;100 level player lurking around the right, so most of us were an appropriate level. Then I spent the next hour replenishing lost resources. Feels bad man. 
---
I'd prefer a much shorter, more intense, and riskier endeavor. I wish I could see if I was contributing damage. Twenty minutes of shoot-shoot-shoot with occasional stimpacks just isn't fun. Even standing right next to the queen, I was never at substantial risk. I only saw one person "downed" the whole time (and at least 3 people rushed over to revive).   
---
Sad to say, the queen was boring. 
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt have any friends that play either. It‚Äôs pretty good. The game has definitely improved since launch
---
Oh no shit? I had no clue 
---
Well that's what I said to begin with...
---
&gt; just feels like they break 3x as fast cause you have to fire it 3x as much to get the same results.
---
The way you phrased it in the context it was being said, it sounded like you were saying they're directly related. So ultimately why make your first comment unless you're moving goalposts here.
---
Where did you get that from? Jon‚Äôs whole video was made out of a love for bethesda and fallout 
---
As slight summary, here's what Jon says:
---
"These are the crucial areas: the game needs to be harder, the map needs to be more interesting, individual locations need to be worth exploring, and in general exploration needs to be rewarded. "
---
"This is perhaps the biggest single thing \[Bethesda\] could do: I think Fallout 76 would've benefited from being released like a Rock Star game; single-player campaign up front and then less-structured multiplayer a few weeks later. I think that would've been much more warmly accepted." (single-player campaign set before Scorched epidemic, playing within the factions, then multi-player set after all factions dead)
---
(re: set-up premise for Fallout 76) "So you're all ready to rebuild, and then you just don't. The main plot totally ignores rebuilding; you spend your time traveling from one faction's ruined base to the next but you never rebuild them."
---
"Fallout 76 is strangely lacking in consequence"
---
If you only have about 15 minutes, start at the last timestamp at 2:16:35 ("How To Rebuild America"). Essentially summarizes all his ideas.
---
The kid isn‚Äôt wrong, she is pretty ugly!
---
I hate the video about fallout 3 because nobody hates fallout 3, they just like NV more in some aspects. 
---
Like its just such a silly thing to say. It is factual the game was good. Mass opinion, as well as it getting game of the frickin year, obviously its a good game. All in all the video was just pointless. 
---
Another video that recently triggered me was an assassins creed video "Assassins creed finger sacrifice explained". Pointless as hell. Who is that video for, anyway? People who have never played assassins creed?  
---
Been having the vengeful one stalking me and my shrine. Killed him 4 times yesterday once today so far lol 
---
Never. If a night battle gets to hot. I‚Äôll just wear PA  use drugs, run away, or use AA/TSE gun! I do sometimes have to wait till day to fast travel back to base, because I don‚Äôt want to drop anything.
---
Really it should just be no-build by the homes and buildings, would solve 3/4ths the problem IMHO  
---
People say you can‚Äôt buy it when your level 20 or 20+ is this still true??
---
No, i have not in any way shape or form tried to say to any individual how to play a game. I do not wish to force anyone to do anything they do not wish and you trying to rationalise what you are saying about my supposed entitled behaviour is vague and rambling. 
---
\*drools in hardened mass and irradiated fluids\*
---
No, I can see it right now and I‚Äôm level 230.
---
The kill huge enemies challenge is bugged cause I have seen numerous posts on this matter and me as well have not been able to complete this challenge, I‚Äôve killed scorchbeasts, mirelurk Queen and deathclaw. 
---
On the other hand the kill mole miners with mining helmet is not bugged as I have completed this challenge myself. I think you‚Äôve got mining helmet and mining hat confused. You‚Äôre supposed to wear the mining helmet which is the one you can customise the headlight. 
---
On the matter of Grahm. There isn‚Äôt much I can tell you as to his location. There has been posts of people mapping out his route but it seems like it‚Äôs not very accurate. From my encounters with him (I‚Äôve had 2 encounters with Grahm since the weekly challenge came out) it seems like he can spawn at any location. I‚Äôve encountered him at Harpers ferry and just beside Charleston station. Just keep playing and you‚Äôll encounter him sooner or later.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Also happy Mothman week
---
Considering less than 10% of people that like something will write something good about it ‚Äúonline‚Äù for people, ‚Äú a lot of people‚Äù not liking it don‚Äôt bother me. I also don‚Äôt own a pitch fork. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh damn
---
That‚Äôs a good point 
---
I never even set foot in WS or Watoga areas until I was at least lvl 50 because I had the perks and the weapons to at least compete with enemies I was facing.  Still got killed plenty of times. 
---
In my current 120ish mode I can pretty much wreak havoc on anything, but it‚Äôs a challenge to go to cranberry bog and WS.  
---
Setting up shop behind the golf club just seems lame.  It‚Äôs like you know you can‚Äôt compete so let‚Äôs make a workaround that fucks with players trying to do legitimate dirty work.  
---
I have zero problem if you want to slug it out like normal players or even set up your camps in WS.   But to build a turret platform behind the golf club to effectively interfere with others is weak.  That‚Äôs why you see some of the reactions you do in this thread. 
---
Ha no!
---
Oh really, thanks a lot 
---
Great build!  
---
Pardon my ignorance, floating roof glitch?
---
And down this post goes with all the other sensible posts to be drowned in a Sea of the same old posts we see everyday. Oh well.
---
I‚Äôm gonna buy it tomorrow, my friend is gonna give me the caps so I can buy it
---
I was aying and as a lvl 15. Every single server the enemies are 48-62 in level. So I'm in the woods, enemies are near my lvl, maybe a few higher then the golf course and high lvl enemies. I hate Whitesprings 
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
TBH I'd also like Burst fire mode for VATS on automatic weapons. It seems that when they converted it over they forgot that in other Fallout games, the per shot for automatics is lower, but the burst is higher, with reduced accuracy, than it is on a single shot.
---
Would make the Guerilla cards worth while, since there are only 2 ballistic and 2 energy weapons that can make use of the card. Also would make sense for Commando with Rifles.
---
I think my favorite thing that was occurred with this thread is the sheer number of different experiences people have shared. It's crazy all this is from same encounter. Fascinating. Sorry about your run tho. Hope your next one is more productive. üòÄüëç
---
Confirmed, ran into an immortal one once this week.
---
Are you ps4?
---
Giving it a watch so far. Writing as I'm watching along so far.
---
Yea, VATs on Liberators is super wonky in regards to their head hit %, you actually get higher hit percentages on their spindly little legs than their heads. 
---
Don't like junk not taking up space in the stash box. It would give people no incentive to hold junk on their person and create a risk/reward factor for PVP, which, besides cap bounty -- which MATN pointed out is inconsequential currently because caps are meaningless (they need better cap sinks, to be honest) -- means that there **no junk reward**. That guy holding thousands of junk on him at his claimed workshop? Now he won't need to be mindful of people lurking around his shop because they can't steal his valuables off his corpse bag when they kill him. Similarly, having a full stash box creates scenarios where you try to create hidden caches of lockers/suitcases full of junk that you would return to later on in the server when you have more stash space. Which, granted is based on server stability, once again creates a risk scenario where you WANT to capitalize on the junk you have, but also opens up an opportunity for someone else to come along and find your cache. I've had cap bounties where I had to haul 200+ pounds of junk to a vendor to make my pillage and loot profit, and that ever present thought that some bounty hunter could show up, kill you, and make off with your loot makes that sort of haul exhilarating. If stash just has infinite space, then where's that risk go? I guess if we go with the idea that the stash box DOES have infinite space for junk, though, then cap bounty rewards need to be increased a lot. Because if you're not getting junk off killing people that you'll then vendor off for caps, then they need to cut the middle man out and make it so killing people gives more of their caps. (Also need higher bankruptcy damage nerfs while they're at all. A guy who gives 0 caps off their warm corpse shouldn't be a threat to other people. Ever.)
---
I‚Äôll buy one for 1500 as well Xbox too 
---
And spend caps to fast travel to Whitesprings because of that damn radroach? No thanks.
---
It's definitely improved since it has come out that's for sure. Could it still be better? Of course! I say take time to explore the environment and don't try to rush the main quest cause the lore in some areas is pretty cool.
---
None of my friends play the game either, so I played solo quiet a bit but it is fun to play with friends or random people on there. I made a lot of new friends in that game whether it was a helping out low level players or teaming up with someone who was around the same level as me to complete a quest.
---
Yeah bud.
---
I quite agree that it's most likely a combination of things. It's rare that a war starts with only one catalyst.
---
Yup
---
I have you tagged as getting banned. Are you still banned or has that changed?
---
You can make around 800 per week just off the weekly/daily stuff, theyve recently started lowering prices, so considering the game will rely on atom shop sales to stay alive, I dont think the current rate is too bad
---
Just happened to me and my pals on **PC**. We had more than 10 players, all but one over level 100. The queen took damage and then healed. At 3/4 of the second health bar, she stopped taking damage for a long while. The bar seemed to move again in the last three minutes, but it's hard to tell if people were doing anything different (I wasn't). The group failed when the timer ran out. 
---
It depends on the location but there are a few wreaked houses, train-carts, and boats you can build into.
---
Definitely Towns, or atleast have a closer proximity between camps untill they can implement a proper Town scheme, i think that would work better if they had more players on a server aswell, say 40/50 players.
---
If you give me the caps I can buy it and then I can pay you back tomorrow 
---
I‚Äôve got plenty of caps to spare and wanted status means nothing to me so if I have to level your turret platform each time I visit the golf club so be it.  I‚Äôve got several other farming options as well where people don‚Äôt pull that crap so whatever.  But I guess you own me lol.  
---
Nice write up!  
---
She has gotten harder, but doable with a balanced approach, glad to see someone explain!
---
Only if you have enough 
---
I have you tagged as being banned. Did Bethesda start unbanning players?
---
You would get clapped we all have explosive aa weapons and sentinal bos armor so sorry level 250 will get shreeded
---
The scientific reason why someone would do this is because they are an absolute dickhead. 
---
In real life they would have no friends. 
---
Not on xbox, but I just realized how easy it is to loot fissure sites with wasteland whisperer or animal friend perk. Wipe out the critters and pacify the sb. 
---
You probably can get it much cheaper than me aswell 
---
The point i liked the most is the specialization of characters, and it also encourages communication because you will lack in somethings (repairing, medicine, bettee food)
---
Looking back, I think I've only ever found 1 Legendary Shotgun myself.   The one I mainly use I simply bought from the Watoga vendor and is a 1\* Quad.
---
It was a 3\* Combat Shotgun, but an odd one: Exterminator, Explosive, -90% weight.  I'm sure it would have been quite spectacular before the nerf.  Now, it's kind of middling and it breaks a lot, which defeats the reason why I have a Shotgun in the first place (to trigger Enforcer).
---
I hate Whitesprings. I thought it would be pretty neat area to explore and rest for a lvl 15 player. Nope, literally every single server is a swarm of lvl 48-62 enemies. A level 202 guy saw me at the Whitesprings train station, I was looking at the plans the robot had, and he started attacking me, and killed me through passive mode. What a fun experience this.
---
What? Go play the game kid. Lol
---
Yup, Vendor Wallace in Harper's Ferry should have the plans for the handmade. Though it should be noted because of the patch, most of the plans have increased in price. If you're on ps4, I can ask my friend to see if he still has some for sale (He made an alt character to get the plans before the patch, sells them for about 800 caps)
---
I really love the card system and i thought id hate it. But swapping out cards every time i do something becomes too much even if its just one card over and over. It doesn't help that they ruined locks in 76. It feels like there are 3-4x the amount of locked doors/boxes per a building. To make it worse the contents are random generated junk.  When i started with my group i rushed to get that and computer hacking as i would in any fallout. Towards the end i tried to avoid them at all costs as it was one more senseless system chipping away at my ability to tolerate the game.
---
I got a Plan: Deathclaw Gauntlet drop yesterday (after 500+ hours) from a random drop from a world container.
---
I can pay you back tomorrow it‚Äôs just you can get it for much much cheaper but if I buy it it‚Äôs like 1000 more
---
People aren't trying to convince people to hate the game, they are stating why they hate the game because that is most likely the reason other people hate the game. 
---
And yes, on the fo76 sub, infamous for defending this game no matter how bad it may be, will downvote every comment that doesn't talk about 76 with at least a semi positive light. Have you seen what the normal fallout subreddit thinks of this game? Oh sorry, I forgot they were all brainwashed sheep who only hate the game because the evil youtubers used their mind control ray on them, silly me!
---
You mean wield 3 pistols and a sword all at the same time? I like how you think. Extra arm mutations should be a thing! Live and drink, my friend!
---
Please stop with this fabricated bullshit outrage over the Atomic Shop.
---
We‚Äôve had enough fake out rage.
---
I don't think there is one.  You can just buy it whenever now.
---
If you had a two shot lever action and there was cross play I‚Äôd take it lol
---
Maybe just build outside of the fence. This may have been suggested I just finally skipped down to the bottom I can't take the drama. Lol
---
Can't we all just get along....  ;)  
---
It‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm gonna get my friend to give me caps tomorrow to buy it unless I can give you all mine and give rest tomorrow or whoever is selling it if that‚Äôs okay
---
For Graham, I heard you can force him to spawn if you capture Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm and when you defend it either for the 3rd or 5th time, he should be strolling by, or so I have been told, but I've never actually tested it.
---
Are you still selling PA if so I would like a set of t-60 
---
Cute!
---
Oh okay, thanks üëçüèª
---
It‚Äôs really unfortunate that some of the best building locations are also random encounter spawns. For those who didn‚Äôt know, this is in my opinion the best spot to farm for the Halloween costumes and treasure maps. The same situation arises with the Charleston vendor bot and the civil war re enactor at the overseers camp. Regardless, I have seen dozens of bases built under this bridge, and yours is one of the best.
---
They are directly tied to each other. The vein of thought is pretty easy to follow here. You've just trying to find nuance when it's pretty damn direct
---
I am your vendor, if you are on PC. IGN: jchamlin I can do the mods but don't have any spare plans.
---
Doing a lot of whitesprings events. The servers can't handle it at all. 
---
Get Marsupial, jump up and interact with something.  You'll be insta-ported in.  I only keep a portion locked but its not too hard for someone to just do that if they're really curious.  Most the place is unlocked, just a portion I keep locked up lol.
---
Jesus I‚Äôm just trying to discuss cosmetic item prices with you all. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù. It‚Äôs just a game I like playing and thought I‚Äôd discuss a concern of mine. 
---
Maybe you should chill
---
This has happened to me...I left
---
A lot of people left for the same reason, first impressions are everything and if first impressions are overall bad people aren't going to stick with a "bad" product just because it might theoretically become decent or good at some unknown future time. It's not as if there's a lack of new games to play in gaming these days, and if you can't hook people at the start they aren't going to come back.
---
Blight soup is about 20% critical damage for 30 minutes. You could potentially run no pistol damage perks and use a tuned reciever instead. That increases critical damage further at the expense of not being effected by weapon damage perks.
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda. Nobody can explain the bugs
---
A level 93 player asked if i wanted bounty gone. Said yes. Said to exit power armor so it doesn't get damaged. Killed me then told me to come get my stuff. 
---
Told him thanks. 
---
I sent him a msg detailing how i got  wanted
---
No bro. When we traded i was already looking for it and i've yet to find it.
---
I now have or read 2 or three of each magazine ,so i could say it is statistically impossible that it didn't show up yet.
---
Are you sure? Cause even with Hard Bargain rank 3 on, it's still over 1500 caps on sale from Wallace which is why I mentioned it lol. I can buy it for you'd like too, getting caps isn't a huge issue for me. Let me ask me friend though really quick.
---
Way to bring a man down.
---
Head dive lol
---
Ok thanks btw
---
That‚Äôs a fair weekly rate I guess though that would require you logging on every day and there are other games and stuff out there. 
---
But I see your point for sure. 
---
I won't even walk into someone's house to look around, even if the door is open. That said my place has been griefed a lot less since I put all my benches and box on the first floor, and leave the door open. My 2nd floor is my power room and bedroom, and it's locked. I come back and find players using my benches all the time, but a lot less destruction.
---
Make it a freezer to prevent spoiling entirely. Limit it to 50-75 pieces of meat.
---
Maybe you should admit this post is bullshit. 
---
Your concern is fake. You get plenty of free Atoms in game.
---
I mean, what are we talking about here?  There are individual props like the beds and signs that cost a fair bit, but things like the different floor textures, succulents, and the blinking lights go a pretty long way.  Just avoid the things where it's one object.
---
As someone said, you can make about 800 Atoms a week.  That's been my experience too.  At the rate they deliver interesting stuff (which, I've got to be honest, is pretty damn slow), I always have more than I need.
---
Ok I‚Äôve only got about 500 caps atm but I can pay you back tomorrow I really want this plan so bad lol
---
Plant veggies under the highway in the big! They're safe from enemies in most places. 
---
Number figures? Over 100 per item?
---

I'm a melee build and in shrouded weightless wood head to toe. Total armor weight: zero. I am the tree.
---
I've experienced the stealth bug a few times.  Being put in instant full danger while hiding a block away, alerted to every enemy at once and never being able to shake them. 
---
Logging in/out, unequiping cards and armors didn't fix it. What did seem to fix it was running indoors.  Getting out of the sun's rays seems to fix it, for me at least. No loading screen required, just get out of the god rays for a second and that seemed to reset me for the next few hours. 
---
Hope this works for those desparate enough to have read this far into the post 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna argue with you on this I‚Äôm allowed to discuss my concerns on the games reddit 
---
You already did. You‚Äôre concerns are bullshit as was this post. 
---
I have encountered the problem of the game saying I don‚Äôt have enough caps even if I do. It seems to be a problem when I try to move my C.A.M.P multiple times on the same server. Try quitting the server and rejoining a different one and try again. 
---
As for the items not appearing in the stored section it might be lag. When I move C.A.M.P and enter workshop mode for the first few minutes the stores items section is empty I have to wait a bit for them to appear. Try waiting and entering workshop mode to see if that helps.
---
Would like these to be fixed but I guess they‚Äôre not on their priority list atm.
---
Damn, I didn't know that. I haven't ran into a server that had anyone in that location yet.
---
My username is pokeher1234
---
More than likely. A person's behavior online wouldn't be that much different than how they behave in real life. Only difference in real life is that they are too much of a sissy to act out the way they really want to behave and know that there will be repercussions to their actions. Unlike in a virtual world they get to be that bully they always aspired to be without having to worry about any real retaliations. This is how they get their self empowering and ego boost. Pathetic really if you think about it. 
---
It is best if you are there to browse..move so other people can get in and out and do what they need to do and leave. You can go back to browsing after they leave. No I have never attacked anyone but some will. I have had some jump around behind me like they need to pee cause I did not know they were there so I move they jump in/out then I finish what I was doing.
---
Should all still be there. Try relogging or stocking up on caps. Had the same issue, it resolved itself as mysterious as it appeared.
---
That's about what I get most times.   Not worth the ammo imo.
---
Here‚Äôs a simple fact. Prices have actually done down. 
---
So again. Bullshit fake post. 
---
I just want to add that I'm not trying to demonise people who use mules for storage, or that I think you shouldn't play that way. You can play the game what ever way you want, as long as you don't hurt others. I did however want to open a discussion on wether it was an intended way to play the game.
---
Been a while since you were on the HAM podcast with him eh?
---
Man I have 2k of Atoms and there is nothing a single fuckin thing in there worth purchasing. 
---
Me? No. I was worried that there might've been some duped stock in a vendor that I'd purchased from, but not even looked at by Bethseda over it.
---
Dude why are you so angry 
---
Everything alright at home?
---
You can PM me, I‚Äôm here if you need someone to talk to 
---
does tank killer effect shotguns? Im assuming no
---
Honestly melee doesn't need a Nerf, hear me out.  
---
-Ranged needs to be buffed significantly.  
---
With some better balance on weight to damage ratios and durability.    
---
  
---
-Specific"Builds" need to be rebalanced and tweaked.    
---
Bethesda didn't understand power gamers and their desire to stack effects to oblivious, Bloodied builds using Unyielding, Blooded weapons, Nerd Rage, etc etc. is something that should have been seen as a OP combo.  Tweaking the interactions, and balancing the Bloodied Legendary would go a long way.
---
   
---
&gt;two hours thirty-two minutes and twenty-one seconds
---
Yeah, too long, didn't watch.
---
This is very inaccurate.  I do WAY more damage with unspecced melee than i do with specced rifles and shotguns.  Melee just outstrips ranged no matter what melee build you make
---
They should make new perks where you can akimbo pistols if you have two( maybe same type guns or different) or melee and pistol(Like switchblade or other one handed light melees with a pistol.
---
That's the kind of response from someone who did allocate proper points into Intelligence would make.  
---
Drinking buddy and fisto make for the ultimate party

A lot of stuff is outlandish but some stuff is cool and I‚Äôd love more variety in camp decorations and right now that‚Äôs only in the atom store.

I have seen a mothman randomly spawn 1 time while roaming around. And as I almost had him dead super mutants came along and started attacking me and mothman vanished üòë i was so mad
---
I recommend planting corn, tato, and mutfruit at your camp and build a water purifier as soon as possible. This will allow you to cook vegetable starch which you can scrap for adhesive. Green thumb, chemist, and super duper perks will help you max this process‚Äôs benefits.
---
Definitely repeat the powering up Poseidon event and claim the workshop there while you‚Äôre in the early game. You‚Äôll get generator and water purifier plans as well as fusion cores for power armor.
---
At 25, go for Miner Miracles in the ash heap to get your first useful set of power armor

The only thing I was looking into purchasing was the CAMO cosmetic for the Power Armor.

It would be cool if they had a lot more camo/pre-war military stuff IMO.

Just because I dont play it doesnt mean I dont monitor news in the hopes of it improving to the point its worth playing.

Thank you very much! Yea sometimes I think the early release ease of everything has ruined peeps to this. It was so easy. Now it's prob where it was intended. And we are all spoiled lol
---
I have encountered the Flatwoods monster twice; Once best the Redrocket Mega Station in the NE, and once in the southern section of the Whitespring Golf Course, behind the bathrooms.
---
Months ago had a liberator do the same. They've got no "downed" animation like humans and bots so they just regen.
---
Totally agree
---
I had that problem as well early on and mine never me back, but it only happened a couple of times to me. I haven't experienced that in a while though, just the occasional lag like mentioned before, give it a few minutes or hop on another server. 
---
Thanks, I'll try it
---
How about making good with salt add additional durability on crafted food such as the perks for weapons?
---
That‚Äôs one THICC wendigo 
---
I haven't had a bug like yours but hey, in fallout 76, anything can happen.
---
I'll give you an add in a few mins, turns out my friend sold out his plans a while back lol. Uhh, if you wanna give  me the 500 caps along with any Acid and Gunpowder you have, that could work for me as well.

I'll be downvoted to oblivion, but have you tried it?  I'm not saying you should find a level 10, break his lamp, and call his mother fat.  Showing up at a higher level player's base just to mess with them can be entertaining for both of you, just have a plan and go for it.
---
I think you are right(spoiled).  
---
It is almost like Bethesda actually is forcing "rolls" which IMHO is a good thing, you should have a balance between all melee or all ranged.
---
AHA that means you're a scorched!! Fell into my Clever Trappe.
---
Sorry to rush lol but I‚Äôve got school in the morn and it‚Äôs 12:46 am lol 
---
Let me get this straight. This guy comes in, truly great guy. Have nothing against him. But he comes in, says the most obvious stuff everyone has already heard repeatedly since launch. he talks about a bunch of things the players have said again and again, and other streamers such as angry Joe have said. What exactly is new or noteworthy about any of this? Is it the fact that he is a well-known streamer? does his opinion alone speak louder than those who have been constantly saying what he is now saying?
---
Management. The devs or CM's really aren't the people to blame. It's the people they have to report to who assigns priorities to stuff.
---
‚ÄúVault 76, where you can be anything (except functional)!‚Äù

I'll have a bounty for taking turrets out. It's unsportsmanlike. KILL YOUR GHOULS ON YOUR OWN CHUMPS.
---
Sounds like you had an exhilarating time. Good work.
---
I know the spot you're talking about (thanks to the glitched Liberators landmark), and every time I'm there I get a Grafton Monster. I'll have to hit it up more often and see if it'll give me a Flatwoods one instead. 
---
I like that idea too, utilize something in game already
---
Jesus I carry like 5 guns and a melee . When I know I'm going to the queen quick repair and go
---
I‚Äôd like something that highlights dead bodies.. can‚Äôt tell you how many bodies I‚Äôve lost track of in the bog.  I feel like this was a skill in one of the Skyrim games.  Nothing more frustrating than losing a legendary creature in the weeds and not getting my third magical lead pipe of the day
---
Oh wow, so there is in-game lore about them that I obviously missed?  And the joke line that one vendor bot has about ‚ÄúNote to gourmands‚Äù is more than just a throwaway line??  Nice
---
Great job on these. A lot of them are beautiful, especially the subdued atmospheric ones.

You can play the long game and set up shop outside of Vault 94 and Vault 96.

Welcome to Watoga Rad Rats: Rad Rats of the future!

Please stop using tired could come backs as if your being smart and original.
---
You earn plenty of Atoms in game even after you do all the one time challenges. 
---
The prices have gone down, not up.
---
Many of us are tired of these made up fake game issues. Many of us are tired of people like you filling the reddit with this kind of shit.
---
If you don‚Äôt like my view, block me like an adult would rather than to continue arguing with me like you says you weren‚Äôt.
---
Which is just more proof this is all bullshit.
---
Bethesda here. Sure thing.
---
People like him/her should get the Dweller of the Year award
---
Probably the same type of player that goes around contesting workshops just to initiate PvP on some low level player; bored people who've played too much Rust.  As somebody below said, PvP mode will probably help out quite a bit and give them an outlet.
---
When I saw this I thought at first glance it was a possible excuse. However, if it was from trading back and forth you do realize that the numbers between the accounts would have been closer with the main account having a higher number. Why? Because that account would have been able to craft the ultra cite ammo earlier and thus would by that very fact have had more in this version of how Bethesda might determine ‚Äúacquired‚Äù.  Instead the mike account had the extremely much higher number.  So, in my opinion the 900 hour guy used an exploit and he used it with his secondary account to avoid his primary being banned if found out. 
---
He then transfers what he needs to his primary when he needs it.  And, he was caught by Bethesda.  Simple. Note they listed 45 ammo and 5mm ammo as being extra ordinary to have acquired in that time frame ON THE MULE ACCOUNT.  If his story were true that he was throwing ammo back and forth as he tried our all kinds of weapons and builds....AND his story of ‚Äúacquire‚Äù counting by Bethesda....then the main account would also have listed on the ban large amounts of those or other ammo types. 
---
Quite simply you clearly transfer as much ammo as you can.  So, while a novel approach to get back on the game you are wrong by the very method you cite.   You used the mule to do the duping and transferred the ultracite ammo ignoring the other ammo once you got the ultra dupe to work.  My guess is you never picked up or crafted another type of ammo again the minute the ultra dupe worked. 
---
And please do not keep this up. Logic dictates I am correct. Math dictates I am correct IF YOUR THEORY IN BETHESDA ACQUIRE count held.  Your mule and main numbers would have been extremely close.    Of course unless your ‚Äúfat fingers‚Äù idea was that you were on your mule account and kept dropping and picking back up with the mule only 500k pieces of ultracite ammo.  Very unlikely for someone so skilled at play as to achieve level whatever. 
---
Besides.  You do realize that if they did ban on such an acquire method just about everyone would be banned.  I know I‚Äôve picked up over 100k 308 rounds since they are so prevalent on scorched.  I prefer 45 so I dump the 308 missles 40mm grenade flares mini nukes etc.  raiding holding and waiting at Poseidon for hours sometimes I have 109 fusion cores and I craft 45 ammo constantly when I hold that workshop.  A rough calculation I‚Äôm sure I make about 2000 rounds of 45 every time I sit there for hours. Then I travel. Use it up. Rinse and repeat. Usually I‚Äôll take a long circular walk around West Virginia ending back at Poseidon. Taking it back or saving it from the always successful level one scorched over turrets.   As to cores since they still haven‚Äôt figured out how to have the lowest one used first I‚Äôll dump a few below 100% and pick up new ones from the generator. Every time you get in and out of power armor the game uses different cores. 
---
While there are still those who think just because you have a lot of something you duped...one person when I said I had over 100 cores and asked if he wanted a couple yelled and cursed and kept peppering me ...I ignored him and he missed out in some friendly gifts of a couple cores...your excuse adds a new level of confusion not needed.  
---
When they nerfed core production my power armor was useless. I wasn‚Äôt going to sit for an hour for one core. When they returned it dang right I was going to sit and gather as many as possible. I didn‚Äôt have to cheat.  And I do NOT use mules.  That‚Äôs just too much work.  I cannot fast travel EVER. Which is exactly how f4 was until they fixed weight issues in ammo etc.  
---
yes. I walk everywhere.  It‚Äôs time consuming. It‚Äôs annoying.  But I also have seen and encountered some weird and wild stuff.  From the alien to mothmen.  Even a glowing moth man in the supposed safe forest right near the radio tower.   
---
So, logic defies your acquire theory. You do realize that that type of counting on a game that they want people to play in perpetuity would have no players left....as people played and got more efficient at legitimate ways of acquiring items they‚Äôd go over any limit.
---
Duper‚Äôs don‚Äôt bother me. I couldn‚Äôt care less. But if they are affecting the ever performance then they should be banned. You‚Äôre destroying or impairing the very game you say you like and want to play and are mad you are banned from.  How about duper‚Äôs just come on here and say yes. I did it. I‚Äôm sorry. I promise I won‚Äôt do it again.  Please reset my account and let me play. 
---
I bet that‚Äôll have more success than making excuses that when truly analyzed don‚Äôt hold up. 
---
The can build a community centre outside vault 76 
---
Good. More of that sweet Technical Data for me. Honestly I found lockpicking very underwhelming. Until I realized not a lot of people picked locks and started finding decent plans/recipes in containers.
---
There is nothing wrong with F76‚Äôs content design.   F76‚Äôs issues are all caused by retrofitting CreationEngine to be multiplayer online.  
---
Sorry Quick please my guy
---
I think you‚Äôre just the cutest 
---
I‚Äôm an hour in and it‚Äôs good. Like you I enjoyed his fo3 analysis, and from the looks of it this one is gonna cover/explain some good points.
---
Really?  How????
---
Ahh sorry for the late reply, my  psn username is the same as on here: Xavier5249 . Just join a server and I'll join you quickly.
---
Beautiful
---
Ok thanks
---
We are one!
---
Hey sorry to reply to you here, I can't seem to able to send messages on Joey. I understand that your job as community manager is to keep a communication line between the players and the team, but maybe there's something that needs to be considered:
---
The reason people complain about this on a weekly basis is not because the players are doing something wrong, it's because the golf club is messed up. There's nowhere on the map that has the density or legendary spawn rate as the club.
---
I grew tired of the game and took a break because the only two rewarding activities are either jump servers on the golf club or nuke fissure prime. Ill return when the game has new content, but please understand that this game had the largest map on all Fallout games and most people concentrate on this single, particular spot.
---
Just remove the turrets and let the next monster horde take it 
---
Tested on bloodied weapons or non-bloodied, too?
---
I tested only on non-bloodied weapons and when I got hungry, displayed damage didn't change.
---
I'm going to tag the creator of the video - /u/ManyATrueNerd 
---
I personally disagree on some points with you, but the fact you're putting in this much constructive criticism is well worth his time to read.
---
[Disclaimer: I am a MATN fanboy, who has not really enjoyed my time with Fo76.] 
---
I've posted on this before and (while I agree) there are some considerations that must be taken into account first before this change can be implemented. Presently, there are PvP-centric events (namely, Monster Mash and maybe others) that turn the area into a free-fire zone for all players, regardless of Pacifist setting. I've confirmed this twice, by killing opponents while as a Pacifist player.
---
I'm sure you can imagine your frustration at not being able to target enemies in that scenario which requires you to switch off Pacifist before jumping in--and I don't know how often I've forgotten to turn off Pacifist before shooting at a Wanted player (yes, I'm an idiot.)
---
In any case, I think we should just try to ensure Bethesda has these little potential goof-ups taken into account when coding a solution to the problem. Like a pop-up upon entering an Event via the map that allows players to temporarily disable Pacifist until the Event's conclusion by agreeing to take part in the event. 
---
actually if you want to let someone have it you team up with them then leave it will transfer ownership to them
---
See how you can‚Äôt reply to facts. Like how many Atoms you earn. Or the fact that prices have gone down.
---
When given facts, your kind always switched to this tactics.
---
It‚Äôs cute you think you‚Äôre fooling people 
---
CAMP should be in blueprints section.
---
Well, that‚Äôs escalated quickly...
---
&gt; They are directly tied to each other.
---
You're misunderstanding what I'm saying and trying to make something out of something else. Being related and being directly tied together on a software level are two entirely different things. As I said before, at the coding level, the damage you deal is not tied to the durability loss per shot. That is what we're discussing here, stop trying to talk about something else then tell me I'm wrong. It's fucking stupid of you.
---
No. Armor has primary, secondary, and tertiary mod slots. And all of the ones you just listed except Sentinals are primary. 
---
There‚Äôs a list somewhere that shows you what effects can be found in what slots, probably on FO4 wiki, it‚Äôs mostly the same list. 
---
Why do you think I can get it for cheaper? Lol. I have 1 point of charisma. You can get Hard Bargain level 1 just like me.
---
Often times, ‚Äúturrets for xp‚Äù mean ‚Äúno xp for anyone‚Äù.  Camp owner doesn‚Äôt misses a chance to hit a mob?  No xp.  Runs away/back into their base because it‚Äôs getting too hairy?  No xp from any adds after that point.  Runs to whitespring to sell stuff?  No xp from any mob that the base pulls away from most players‚Äô starting point.
---
All the yes‚Äôs. I‚Äôve started destroying camps back there, I don‚Äôt care about the bounty if some asshat is going to troll back there. 
---
I'd be down. I'll send you a friend request. 
---
I'm not against this idea, but I promise you, this will bug out at some point and will be abused if implemented. Imagine being able to farm without being attacked at all.
---
I am, and I have T60
---
Gamer tag is TheBigNasty6575
---
Or they‚Äôre simply too low a level for the stuff they‚Äôre trying to fight.  Not everything is mad skillz/get gud broseph :p
---
Thank you! That was super good for 1-4!
---
How many caps is it for that set
---
So.....front 9 or back?
---
In theory, someone might be able to use the Nord VPN 7 day free trial.  Theoretically, anyone attempting this should remember to cancel their account before the free trial ends or be billed $107.55 for the three year subscription.
---
 May the infinite cosmic wisdom of the Mothman be bestowed upon you all. 
---
That's an awesome spot. I would love to run into that. It doesn't even look like a player camp.
---
Ok lets be real. The reason most people dislike it is because of the issues resulting from it being rushed out on a deadline, as other projects like Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 were given priority over it.
---
That‚Äôs cute, I‚Äôve got full sentinel assassin bos gear, and like 10 bloodied weapons that will one shot all of you :).
---
Ah, that's likely the same thing I was describing.  Nuke events in general seem to bring folks from different GEOs onto a single server, SBQ are usually the more frequent culprits.  Lots of folks advertise nukes in the various Discords, so you often get lots of folks joining in on a server that are necessarily auto matched to them on logon.
---
Just wait till you can get home defense 3 and place middle turrets.  Those bad boys can put the hurt on scorchbeasts even!
---
But IF you‚Äôre using them as a crutch to fight in areas populated by lots of mobs and players alike - not just trying to survive, but actively fight in - then maybe another area is better suited to that character for the time being...
---
I don't like this game because bethseda lost my account and replaced it with someone else's and didn't bother to respond to the support tickets I sent in
---
Thanks, I always try to make my camps look like they are actually from the game itself.
---
DAMN! Well done, that's a big deal the first time done with confidence!
---
I wonder if a security group would come together.  
---
Then why are you here on this subreddit? Lol. 
---
Warframe too, and ffxiv
---
I only have a stash,  cooking fire, off the ground basic bed, an armor table, and a roof of about 8 turrets to deal with the ghouls that spawn around there.
---
Its a pretty basic garage on the side of the road with no doors, and spikes on the ground to handle the random little attack bots that come around. 
---
Im level 12, been playing 20 hours so far. If someone gets that bored, more power to them.
---
So Fallout 4 had no issues, am I right?
---
You just sound like an overly sensitive little bitch, good luck in the world, you‚Äôll need it.
---
I bought it full price and I‚Äôm still overall happy. The road map sealed the deal for me I know content will be coming and when-ish and bugs are getting fixed. One you tuber made a video about Bethesda hierarchy and how it fucked this game. Bought some forgiveness from me but for $20 it‚Äôs üëçüèº
---
Do you still need help?
---
It is a single player game, and it had a very bad reception. So bad in fact I never bought it at release, or until very recently at a highly discounted price in a bundle, with all DLC included.
---
30% avoidance **is not** 30DR. 
---
Incoming damage goes through 4 reduction phases: 
---
1. A chance to avoid it all. From serendipity/emergency-Protocols, sentinel and cavalier. 
---
2. Then a % just gets reduced. Blocker, dodgy, assassin. Suppressor is also kind of in this category: 
---
3. Then DR kicks in, where, coarsely explained, 100 damage to a 100 DR enemy will do 50 damage. 100 damage to a 200 DR enemy will do 25 and so on, with an exponential curve and ever diminishing returns as you approach 9%.
---
4. Similar mechanism, when doing 100 damage from a distance of 100 Bethesda distance units applies 50 damage.
---
Now, the point is #3 can‚Äôt be hermetic, and what‚Äôs more, other players can reduce your DR using things like perforating mags and the concentrated fire or incisor perk. 
---
# 1 and 2 can, but the things they grant them are situational. 
---
Afaik on PC you have to have friended another person to join them/fast travel to them.
---
HOWEVER there is a "recent" players list. I've never used it to try and travel to someone who left, but I suppose it's possible. Chalk another one up to how do we make it easy to grief players?
---
Yes once I had the fast travel marker for the glass cavern I bypassed them all and went to the one in there
---
You can‚Äôt scrap them.  Just don‚Äôt drop them, it‚Äôs not tough.
---
This idea is the bees knees.
---
It doesn't. Lol
---
Imagine being this brainwashed. Anthem is 100x the game this is. 
---
Wait a year. It'll be pennies and hopefully in a decent shape. Still isn't good. 
---
Thank you for the summary and the timestamp. There's no way I can devote that amount of time to a video, but I'm interested in his take on 76.
---
I really enjoyed watching Jon play 76, I had no view on the game because I'll never own a system powerful enough to run it. I had a good time watching him sequence break the crap out of it though ;-)
---
I had the same thing happen. lvl 104 icovers &amp; his little lvl 20 buddy detroyed my camp and taunted me via message. Bunch of pricks! 
---
Without barbarian, evasive, iron clad and fireproof youre going to die a lot.
---
... man idk, i have no access to my account since 2 week, but i remember that i have like... a huge huge... hugeeeeeeee number of materials
---
Just realized my reply never went through but no I never did any glitches or duped once again in a time where people are duping and glitching in a video game where sharing is a thing and people can just leave bags with whatever they want in it I dont think it's that crazy to comprehend someone acquiring something like that 
---
So just for the record once again I never duped never glitched just sold alot of shit 
---
Maybe if my Facebook posts were able to be viewed as well it wouldn't be so hard to understand I was a vendor but I sold shit on here and only used reddit once and got shit for it so I never used it again
---
From when I did play. 
---
Stuck around as in not attempt to play the game until it's functional? Sure. 
---
My bitch ass his and won‚Äôt download it üòë super salty. Also super cute you guys play together. 
---
I dont know if this post is real or not, but he is not the only one.  I made the mistake of picking up a bag with tons of loot.  I too am banned even though no longer have it in my posession.   In addition, I was not given the opportunity to appeal.
---
It‚Äôs a business.   It‚Äôs okay for them to make money, feed their families and return capital to the owners.  
---
Not anywhere near as exciting as it was once was. The guns are only like 20% more powerful 
---
They are solid. A little less accuracy but 25pct damage bonus. Whats the second star?
---
I think I was there today! The glowing hordes were everywhere
---
I assume it's a max lvl.  1000 caps?
---
I think they may be implementing that in the next DLC, hopefully NOT if they do not allow item locking... The horror when people notice their 5 star legendary gone when spamming the scrap button. 
---
I have my camp at the same exact location 
---
Did he reboot and change servers and it still followed him?
---
Yeh is a thing they are at westek alot of the time
---
Yes
---
In 400+ hours this is my first encounter with one
---
We need to support such posts so it gives a voice to this much needed feature.
---
Just go for pure damage perks on the shotgun. You have points everywhere.  You can completely buff out strength and use shotgun and axe. 
---
Some guy and his friends were randomly attacking us while we were fighting the sbq. I later found one of their camps. They dropped another nuke so I knew he'd be preoccupied. Took a before pic of his camp and sent it to him for the memories. Proceeded to destroy his camp then sent him an after pic then hopped offline for the night. 
---
Are you on now?
---
Yes, that was mentioned in the post 
---
They probably spoiled. :(
---
Your workbenches are saved in the build if you placed the benches in the structure. If you long press square (Ps4)  in the stored blueprint it will dismantle and you can rebuild.
---
Can confirm - the exclusive Bethesda women have all left :(
---
I know I‚Äôm really late to this thread but I CANNOT FUND THE VENDING MACHINE
---
It's a known bug
---
Yea from what I hear it's a popular location. So I might have to dig up stakes again.
---
What do you mean? I have all the damage perks on the shotgun.
---
Ok then!
---
I have three perk cards for lockpick, but if it's not a level zero lock I don't bother. There is never anything good enough in any locked container that makes it worth switching cards out.
---
What would you switch them out for? I'm really not dying that much as is. Assaultrons are the only thing they ever kill me.
---
They ‚Äúfixed‚Äù the SBQ. I haven‚Äôt done the Queen since the day after the patch. She glitched after about 20% health dropped. A guy I played with said the time before on the same server she flew off to the northeast. It‚Äôs broken and was one of the few endgame things left to do. Let‚Äôs see what she is like after the next patch(nerf). 
---
My psn is oneshoethelegend if you want it add me
---
Yeah travel costs are the worst, but I love my lake house. Come on by if u have Xbox 
---
Maybe the original programmer never got back and it is too messed up to be worked on. XD
---
While they're at it, maybe come up with some way to keep me (me specifically, I don't care about the rest of you) from shooting innocent players who surprise me during a firefight. I usually can't hit a damn thing without VATS, but of course when I see something move out of the corner of my eye and blast blindly I'm guaranteed to hit if it's another player.
---
xxxkatatoniaxxx, if by some chance you're seeing this, I do apologize. 
---
Since Bethesda is listening to this thread....

Exploits of this type are usually fine by me. EXCEPT when it's being done at the expense of everyone else but YOU.  Whitesprings is a great place for everyone to farm for basic meds/junk and lame, but not  horrifically bad, armor (legendary weapons are so bad it's almost entertaining to see how lame that loot is).  The drops are great for meds, and other maintenance supplies.  So I'm all for eliminating the XP farm camps and all for the no-turret community minded friendly camps which benefit EVERYONE to be allowed.  Unfortunately, there is no way to  allow one and not the other unless you super gimp or disallow turrets in Whitesprings. So getting rid of all camping in Whitesprings is the only practical solution.
---
The argument that "Bethesda allows camps to be built there so it's fine!!" can go both ways.  Bethesda also allows players to utterly destroy and atomize player camps so that is also fine under this argument. I would never think to camp anywhere near popular spawn locations because I would expect to get destroyed and ridiculed by other players for being a jerk.
---
So go ahead and build turret/rocket camps just don't be surprised when a smoldering pile of camp scrap is all you get for your actions. Risk/reward. Build an ass-hat camp outside clubhouse = chance you and your camp being destroyed  by vigilantes on a regular basis.
---
Bethesda needs to create at least 3 more Whitesprings type loot areas. Make one of them with low level enemies and low level legendary loot (nothing higher than level 30 enemies with legendary drops of level 30 or below) so low-level guys can elvel up and farm without being harassed or resorting to jerky XP camps. The bonus is, you get legendary weapons you can instantly use on a regular basis, instead of getting something you need to grind up 20 levels to use.  Put higher level stuff (varying degrees) in the other 3 and that will keep the higher level players there instead of competing with low-level players.  Once you level up you can go to the big-boy loot spot.
---
At least I‚Äôm not just crazy. Although now I bet the savage spot has the plans I‚Äôm looking for just sitting there below the surface. 
---
Demo xpt doesn't do much anymore.  I would rank out the crippling card and try ranking out your slugger cards. I think the rifle is spreading you too thin
---
Sounds like he knew what was coming and was happy for you to take the hit. But he didn't envisage the total over 30 days so did he get banned too?  
---
If you liked his Fallout 3 video, you'll like this one.
---
So what is your main focus rifles? 
---
They‚Äôre workin on it 
---
Also, what build bloodied ect
---
THANK YOU
---
Damn thats pretty dope
---
It seems to make a pretty big difference on my shotgun. I'm killing 91 deathclaws in a couple shots with that perk on. I cant even 1 hit a level 40 mole miner without it.
---
I also have all of the two hamded melee and non automatic rifle perk cards max level, but ive been running this shotgun and handmade build. 
---
ü§î
---
Also, don‚Äôt for a moment think that the PvP world won‚Äôt have mirelurk kings, ScorchBeasts, L52 Mr Gutsys and hoards of L62 scorched. 
---
Assassin does nothing to protect from them. 
---
If it‚Äôs either-or with dodgy; dodgy does. 
---
If it‚Äôs both, then the conversation isn‚Äôt ‚Äúassassin or dodgy‚Äù, as people here are pointing out, but ‚Äúis 32% of assassin worth being invisible as soon as you stop running/sprinting rather than only when  you crouch‚Äù. This is where there seem to be different opinions. 
---
Unofficially, what are your initial thoughts on his takes?
---
Love the Itty Bitty Kitty Cafe! 
---
closest would be [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asnxed/west_virginia_tourism_board_has_a_nifty/) since the game map has been squished and shrunk.
---
What level is the ts handmade and how much for it? 
---
This is a great place to go! Thanks for the info
---
üôÑ
---
# You won the game!
---
This aggression...like...will not stand, man.
---
For real though this is a cool thing. I'm only level 6 and having a few bodyguards to get me through the early grind would be sweet. The only problem is I cant afford 250 every 15 minutes.
---
So for someone like you u/arcanian88 this service wouldn't be necessary. For someone like me it would be a miracle I just cant afford it. This is for thos e folks in the middle that can afford it and can still use it.
---
Dont piss on the rug man.
---
I appreciate you u/djd237. RP on.
---
Once you get high enough you can pretty much pick your build by picking every card. Honestly it looks pretty good. 
---
I like glowsight for nuke zones. I have tenderizer for a bit more damage too
---
I used to leave my doors open till I saw my CAMP was under attack and the guy was waiting for me (in the clown suit) to kill me.
---
He took about 5 SG shells. 
---
My aae shotgun kills pretty much everything in one hit. Big legendaries take less than 5. The tse handmade is my second option when I need a little range or more bullets (has a drum mag)
---
The grognak axe is my backup,usually for when I get swarmed by ghouls. 
---
Great! 
---
That's going to be about tree fiddy
---
Which ones in particular? I know PVP rubs people the wrong way, but I pretty much only specifically target workshops under the pretense of attacking other players. So it's pretty much exactly what the devs intended, and warn, of players who choose to utilize them. I think the problem, however, is that these players that would risk getting attacked by other players aren't being rewarded by workshops enough. 
---
It stays owned by you though, doesn't it?
---
He seems trustful, I believe him 
---
nah thats dumb yr dumb
---
But doesn't that require you leaving the server? Or just the team?
---
I built my camp on an acid deposit
---
There's also quite a few ideas sprinkled throughout beyond that which aren't mentioned, such as an in-depth take on the problems with carry-weight, the different components of how the crafting system work, and how all of it (doesn't) fit together, along with simple solutions to all of those.
---
    
---
It's also worth noting that his video generally gets larger in scale in terms of problems and suggestions as it goes on, starting out with quick rebalance things that one developer could fix in a few hours and hugely improve the game, to suggesting how a single player campaign prequel would improve it, to a concept idea of how to completely restructure the entire game in a way that's both very ambitious but also very loyal to the core ideas of what Fallout 76 was trying to be (and staying true to the Fallout series overall).
---
Fair. 
---
stand in the far NE corner of the map for 10-15 mins to trigger the quest One is the Loneliest Number
---
Thanks man appreciate that! :) also Reported you ;) 
---
It's very clear that he has thought about this a LOT, and he is a very fast speaker, so you'd need about 15 bullet points for every 30 seconds of the video. Someone might do it, but it would take a lot of effort.
---
Indeed. And camps are cheap to repair. If there's a game mechanic, then it was intended to be utilized. Beat each other up for a minute flash a heart emoji drop a beer or a cola and go your seperate ways. Its called a game, i wish people would just play it.
---
https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-76-story-explained/
---
First one, then tha other. 
---
Ehh, I don't find it that interesting. If I want to go PVP, I'll just play some battle royale game or something like call of duty because PVP in Fallout just doesn't make sense to me.
---
And besides, this person's behavior was just annoying. He kept coming back to destroy my camp, and I'm over here just trying to defend my home. It wasn't really all that fun to me. 
---
Nice! That sounds exhilarating. Now if only there was a workshop that dispensed stimpacks after a battle like that...
---
It‚Äôs probably less about weapons and more about them having better armor. 
---
Cranberry bog events. 
---
As a heavy weapons player; I have to agree.
---
I invested mostly in building around heavy weapons and power armor, so barely any agility and trying to use vats with a heavy weapon is impossible due to it not being burst fire. It's even worse on wind up weapons like the gatling laser; where you shoot one shot and then the gun immediately unwinds because you ran out of AP for vats.
---
Add me Mammouthu - I'm new and would like to get leveled up for the prestige coming up. What are you play times?
---
I'm so pumped for survival mode. Do we have more details on what exactly it's going to change?
---
I turn it off when bored *spelling* and play RDR2.
---
Terrible idea. Period. 
---
past on the fallout 76 market or bazaar that you are looking for them and someone will sell them to you in a jiffy. What platform, by the way? I havent been on in a bit, but I might have an extra set on xbox. I wont have a chance to look until Monday, though.
---
Some buildings, it just depends 
---
I think you are overthinking this.  They couldn‚Äôt get everything into the initial release and will be adding more later.  This feature should be a lower priority since it doesn‚Äôt really add much, since as you mentioned it‚Äôs not hard to transfer items without it.
---
Player versus AI, it nakes perfevt sense.
---
Buy player versus player, it seems melle now has the unfair advantage. 
---
Range weapons ((regardless of type)  dont have the amage output melee does. Which defies logic, but oh well.  
---
I know the uniform plans can be obtained from a random event on the corpse of a civil war reenactor. Hats should be available as a plan too the same way 
---
Then you likely wont understand any of this thread
---
I picked it up on amazon for 28 dollars brand new after calling around slc and discovering that even used, its going for 40ish.
---
Havent regretted it yet, games a blast. Already over 20 hours in, and at a dollar per hour played, ill easily get my moneys worth.
---
Unfortunately for those of us that would like specialization, I think it was a deliberate design decision to make Fallout 76 a game where you can do everything as one character rather than focus on replayability for multiple characters, with the ultimate goal to be good at everything, get every perk, join every faction, do every quest, and so on, and so forth. There's many hints that this is the case, from being able to change your name and appearance at any point, to swapping out which perks you have, to MATN's testimony that they told him they expected players to be generalists instead of making multiple characters when he went to a private journalist beta test for them and was able to ask questions before release. 
---
Although it's entirely possible that they could change their mind on that, if they are convinced of the advantages of specialization. There might be a lot of work to be done to readjust the quests and factions to no longer be designed to do and join all of them, however.
---
Keep in mind that this is just my interpretation and I don't know if Bethesda or /u/ManyATrueNerd would agree with this assessment or not.
---
Civil war top hat, suit, dress, union suit, confederate suit can usually be found in the civil war museum at the cemetery south of the civil war fort.
---
you can find plans for some of it (like the hats I think) but I dont know where.
---
Good idea, thanks. I‚Äôm on XB1 as well. If you do find you have a spare set or come across one, I‚Äôm definitely in the market. Thanks again!
---
It almost looks like it‚Äôs breakdancing and everyone is standing around watching 
---
Not if the horde wins. You can also just hop to another server 
---
If Bethesda take anything away from Jon‚Äôs suggestions I really hope it‚Äôs the stuff on towns and their associated end game world map content. 
---
CAMPs are situationally good when out in the field but the idea of having a constantly developing town/hub to return to is badly needed. 
---
As a mostly solo player I‚Äôve got no real reason to team up with others beyond doing hard quests. As it was pointed out, my CAMP gives me access to every workshop, food and water. There has to be some incentives to grouping up, like Jon‚Äôs ideas on train lines and rebuilding existing structures for benefits which would help everyone. 
---
Also think of the RP possibilities if multiple towns and player raider gangs emerged on a server. That‚Äôs player driven immersion tight there that just doesn‚Äôt exist at the minute. 
---
I had a guy call an air strike on my first base when I was like lvl 25. Last week some dude came in my base while I was helping a low level and started destroying everything with his bare hands. I'm hesitant to even put the decontamination shower I recently got because of the absurd repair cost, it will be target no. 1....
---
Fuck that, wait your turn. 
---
I'd love to see a hot fix put it back to not auto scrapping at all so we have to unbulk it for crafting and wait awhile longer to have it work completely properly XD
---
This.
---
By Atoms Will,,, please everyone upvote this. 
---
Good source of non-violent xp
---
Watching this made me kind of sad. I can't help but feel this could have been such an amazing game (don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying it right now) if even a fraction of what Jon is talking about was added in some way to the game. It also kind of overwhelmed me with a feeling that probably all these great suggestions probably would not or cannot be implemented..
---
I'm not trying to come off as negative, just trying to understand/share the feelings I'm feeling.
---
Don't tell me they even took back all the leeks. How then will you be able to run for an indefinite amount of time?!
---
I think we figured it out.  He had mutations so his modified luck was 0.  He took a point in class freak at 46, raised his luck to 3 and looks like the items are not completely broken.  ....so far
---
+karma
---
Thats the problem... Theres nothing to do at that point. My character sits in limbo at lol 85 cause i have nothing to do. And my inv. And stash is full. 
---
While I feel you; I feel like we don't really have that much of crop variety in what we can plant though.
---
If I could grow more things even if they required resources from quests/events. IE: Pumpkins from the Pumpkin House daily. It'd go a long way towards making farming more viable and useful beyond making vegetable starch. 
---
Not bad.
---
My hat says pink but it‚Äôs clearly white
---
just makes me wish we had interior walls for camps. 
---
I lucked into another team shooting one down and got a keycard. Pretty nifty.
---
Happened as it should then
---
Yep, for the past 3-4 days. Also getting between indoors and outdoors takes a long time and baddies can/will attack as you are in transition. Since last big patch when they upped weight game has been really bad. 
---
you can get the plans for both of them from random encounters in the toxic valy and forest so pretty common if you know what you are doing. 
---
plans for all civil war items can be found on a random encounter which is a dead civil war reinactor it only happens in the valley and forest. 
---
Well at least they're not 60 dollars :p
---
all civil war plans can be found on that random encounter. Got my black powder rifle plan from one. 
---
I appreciate it man if you want to work something out add me djd532 I can talk to my boss and see if he will judge on price I know if your a loyal customer you get discounts
---
Yea, but still fun to build.  Mine is built like a cajon  swamp shak. 
---
I think he just missing the point of the post.  Doesn't really matter since feelings and enjoyment of games is subjective.  Sales figures and player engagement numbers are objective but I don't think those have been released.   Anywho, personally I am disappointed with the game and I know many other actual fans are as well. Not just people riding the hate train are displeased and disappointed with this title.
---
If he wants people to hear his points perhaps he should spend some additional time organizing his thoughts and editing so that it doesnt take 2 hours to present them.
---
atleast it is fun when you don't have to glitch the builder to make a support beam. 
---
Ok, but did it?  Like how sometimes the message log says it took some bullets from you but it was actually just a queued message about what you had fired recently.
---
Kill people.
---
Just jump on the planter to the left and take out your shotgun.
---
yeah seems legit
---
It gave you armor.  Then it separately gives you an item reward. 
---
Frankly the main issue that he goes over is that the game can't decide what it wants to be (bugs aside). The best solution that Bethesda won't do (and most devs/pubs wont do nowadays) is real permanent servers and communities.
---
So I‚Äôve been killing off the robots attacking Phoenix and the last three times there‚Äôs been a 3 star and a 2 star legendary protectron in the mix, anyone having that happen? 
---
They have so far just been dropping armor which I didn‚Äôt need so sold right away. It would been 4 times but last time a car blew up killing me and the 2 star. But when I respawned the protectron is gone and a dead Mr Handy was laying they. 
---
What weapons are you using?
---
What is your build?
---
Tell us your build and we may be able to fix it for you.
---
Meh, if that‚Äôs all you play for you should probably take a break for a couple months anyway.
---
I've had SBQ lag out back before U5 and it looked similar to your video. Sucks when that happens. My comment is more in relation to someone using a gronak axe and power attacking. That says a lot to me unless this guy has a 3* AA/AS gronaks. Having dozens of such guys isn't going to make the fight easier.
---
Just saying with an optimized melee build I can get the damage of a mole miner gauntlet up past 2800. If there are a bunch of non-optimized guys, it can still be a struggle. They did make SBQ a bit harder to make up for the loss of Sonic spam. That and adrenal being a suicide wish with millions of adds lowered all the optimized builds dps by 40%.
---
I am in more or less the same situation as you are in. A solo player that has about 200 hours in, and is getting pretty bored. I am thinking the two options to refresh the game are try new builds (either on your character, or create a new one) or try multiplayer. For me, I am more or less not playing anymore. I picked up Far Cry 5 on sale, and I am playing that. I am very happy with the 200 hours of fun play that I got in 76. If you are a solo player, I personally don't see much over 200 hours of gameplay before things get stale. We have new content coming that looks promising.
---
So, my suggestion would be to try new builds, try multiplayer, or just move on to something else until some of the new content hits. I am picking the last option for myself.
---
I've turned farming West Tek into an art. Personally I just enjoy tweaking my build and hunting for better and better gear.
---
I dont know why but I think it needs to be stopped. It's extremely dangerous and there has to be a fix to it
---
also should keep the steel from ammo then and just lose the gunpowder and plastic and lead. 
---
Delete this! It's a bug and let's keep it that wayüòÇ
---
I fired it once and it fired...exceptbit wasnt 6 nukes. It was 6 billion. Fix this thing now.
---
Your a masochist. I've only done epic 1 for shaman, ranger and druid. 
---
Anyone who watches the video will know that he doesn't at all want it to be at all like Rust. 
---
He doesn't want people to kill each other, he wants them to work with each other. 
---
He describes something more similar to something like Minecraft servers where people build persistent "towns" together (essentially a group of player camps built close together that get benefits similar to perk card sharing due to being built close to other players, then after enough camps are close together it would be considered a town and be placed on everyone's map), and then mix that with survival mechanics like Fallout 4's survival mode had so that players have a reason to work together with the other players on the server and helping each other survive. 
---
The result would be allowing people to open up a shop in the town of player bases, or for a group of players to go together to a dangerous area where everyone would serve a function because of more specialization and everyone having low carry weight so it would be difficult to loot an area by yourself, and it would cause players to go around in groups like you see in single player Fallouts. 
---
Instead of the current way Fallout 76 tends to go where everyone just ignores each other, with these changes there might be a group of mercenaries players protecting someone as they try to get somewhere, or a group of people coming back from looting an area along with pack brahmin that are holding all their loot that they're bringing back to the town. 
---
He also would keep PVP mostly the same as it is now, but add the option to become a Raider, which would work like the "wanted" system does currently and you could try to raid the player towns, but everyone else on the server, unless they're also raiders, would be fighting back against you (in the same sense that they do if you have a bounty currently).
---
They‚Äôre fixing it now and addressed that I didn‚Äôt have 100k of items or other duped stuff. 
---
As I figured it was from stuff I picked up at WS and the WS train station. Nothing major but a lot of 1 Star items like bat, switchblade boxing glove, wood armor... and all that. I also picked up a bag that had about 60+ orbital strike grenades inside WS by the work bench like other people have dropped there. 
---
I also told them that I was farming through the windows at WS by the tennis courts daily. So hopefully I should be back on with my account tomorrow. 
---
My son plays as well and experienced the same issue I mentioned above. 
---
I think if we had vendor bots at our CAMP and we could select things up for sale that would be cool.
---
Inside train due W of Watoga Station in a train car on a couple of wooden boxes. 
---
You can reject the quests. It will try to give you a defend or retake quest two or three times, but it gives up if you keep rejecting it.
---
He's been working on organizing and editing this for months, the only "problem" is that he has 2 hours worth of ideas to present.
---
Can we get
---
You lick your lips with that mouth?
---
Your friends should give it a chance. If they'd never played it they don't have a valid opinion. Your friends probably love Nickelback.
---
Yea, it was one of those things where I said "fuck it, I'm going to do this." and it quickly turned into "I have to be fucking insane for doing this"
---
I won‚Äôt publicly endorse a youtube account unless I watch it exclusively and I really believe in it.
---
My only official recommendations are Many a True Nerd, Oxhorn, and MarvelHQ.
---
It's not a bug. Non-canned food will turn into spoiled meat, vegetables, or fruit if you leave it in your inventory too long.
---
If the item has a condition, it will eventually spoil (like how your weapon will break after too much use). Things like Sugar Bombs and Canned Dog Food don't spoil.
---
This is just MY opinion in how i would set up my build you can do with it how you like. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=a88469b&amp;d=sd0sf2su2so0sp0pd0pc0pk0pp2pl0p00eh2ej4c72ir2a42am2as2l71lu2la2lt2s01ic2&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Not gonna watch, but why would the biomes be a problem? they are one of the few things BGS did adequately.
---
I'm curious what plans he was browsing. That dude stocks like 2 plans. Lol
---
Wow yeh took me about 80hrs to see one.
---
Also a thing I didn't think existed is bottle Cap mines 
---
Was roaming around and bars onto a radtoad so I swiped left or right to see if there were any more and it vats Onto a bottle Cap mmine which I shot.
---
It exploded with the caps sounds and killed the radtoad but when I looked I couldn't see any bottlecaps.
---
Quality content and not just bullshit bashing the game! Kudos for you
---
I guess I dont understand that build. Is that for bloodied weapons? 
---
Like golf outfits they are good to sell to vendors because they‚Äôre very common and worth a bit to vendors.
---
If you can sucker someone into buying it do it. But don‚Äôt buy them
---
lol... yeah, ok chief.
---
You can use rugs as well now, and they don't take up as much budget as a Camp Fire.
---
Well you did a great job with it. 
---
Thanks!
---
No, its for what you said. Maxing out the 10% damage cards isnt efficient in my opinion you can get more cards, for example: all riflemen perks are 20% maxed out, but at lvl 1 they are 10%, so you get 30% damage instead of the 60% but you have room for more stats
---
Well I shouldn't have made assumptions, not normally what I do.  2.5 hours? Who has time for that?
---
Normal attention span is like 45 minutes, which is why most lectures are limited to that time or have a break at that point.  
---
 Without having seen this, he either should have worked on his material more to make it more concise or else found a way to break it up into more manageable pieces.  As it is, he has dramatically limited the reach of his ideas.
---
10% plus damage while aiming 
---
+1 Agility 
---
So 3 stars my bad. 
---
Lol
---
Happened to me this afternoon. She froze at the same health level you show. We were throwing everything at her, including multiple orbital strikes, and it wouldn't decrease.
---
So is it not considered stealing to grab food and water anymore?
---
It is more an extension on his point to make biomes more distinct and the overall difficulty. One example he gives for example is how ash heaps should have a dense fog of ash. This is actually how it should be according to fo76s lore. To add something distinct he suggests fog crawler like creatures that stalk you in there and wait until you are in a weak to attack. The longer you stay in the area the more crawlers follow you, creating a paranoid atmosphere and "naturally occuring" deathtimer or at least provoking a big fight.   
---
This all ties into his vision of "a better fallout 76" which is more difficult and wants to promote more concious decisions to make "expeditions" into the more dangerous areas, also promoting more teamplay.
---
He thought the same as well. Though, he thought it wonderfully done aesthetically, but not functionally. Take his example for the Ash Heap. Put on a bandana or gas mask, and gameplay wise, it's the exact same as the forest. His proposal were ash clouds that reduced visibility with monsters hiding in the ash stalking you until you leave or they are ready to attack.
---
Something to make the other biomes not feel like just a change of scenery.
---
Typically you can't build near any place that has a location icon on the map (discoverable places).
---
Aside from that, you can find small-medium places that don't show up on the map and let you throw your camp down. Stuff like a small cabin, an abandoned trailer with patio out front, campground with tents, etc. etc.
---
Thats a nice above average gun!
---
The miners hat and miners helmet are different items. Kill big monsters just updated for for the first time for me today, only one to go!
---
Very Asinine Targeting System
---
that was a bug and they fixed that in the latest patch
---
And upcoming content?! :D
---
[Fallout 3 is absolute garbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLJ1gyIzg78) compared to Fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas. 
---
It took the beloved RPG series of Fallout 1 and 2, and instead of making a game deserving of the name Fallout 3, turned it into a watered down cash grab, then continued to ruin its legacy more with Fallout 4, and even more with Fallout 76. 
---
What happened to the Bethesda that made Daggerfall and Morrowind, two of the all-time greatest RPGs? If only we could be in the alternate timeline when they were the version of Bethesda that ended up making Fallout 3 and 4.
---
I have really enjoyed the game.  I feel it is a great mix of a good single player game but with a good co-op. Meet mostly really cool people that wanna help each other.  (Sure there are a few jerks but not many). 
---
Just the team. It transfers. 
---
ok, that makes sense. i too wish rad storms were more common especially when there is an active nuke zone on the map and the rad storms would roll off of the nuke zones.
---
I don‚Äôt get the issue aside from it being annoying and tacky.
---
Just shoot the ghouls too. You get the same loot and free exp.
---
Then murder the motherfuckers when you gotta go.
---
Are you a wendigo?

I really think this is a cool idea. Players making some end game content for themselves.
---
Cargobot was a pain in the ass for me and a mate.
---
We chased it the length of the map until it went over the mountains in the SE region of the map. Once we shot it a few times it stayed in the area making it easy to pick off. But halfway through the mission I was ready to quit and say bugger it.
---
I guess I hadnt thought of it like that. I could maybe drop a couple of those perk cards. Starched genes with mutations would be a good add.
---
Still, those damage perks really stack up, combined with bloody mess, adrenaline, and gun fu, I can tank through mobs pretty easily.
---
I want to improve my defense somehow. I could give up my commando perks, but rolling with the shotgun and handmade gives me so much offensive versatility.

I played a similar german mmofps from years ago where nerd raging gums would interfere and stop me for being to good at the PvP elements of the game.  It was pretty hilarious... they would call it exploiting even though I was just following the programmed rules.

All I was trying to point out is the post is acting like they are the biggest baddest dudes out there, they aren‚Äôt, that‚Äôs probably why they need a giant crew to watch their own backs

And for anyone to pay this amount of caps they are wanting is crazy and completely unneeded, a complete waste of your caps. All of the situations they propose to solve for you, you can easily solve yourself.

Mole miner breathers have 1-2 rubber a piece. I think hitting any of the mines might work, blackwater etc.

I don't see the PvP being a necessary factor in the junk economy, IMO. I never stayed with the game long enough to get to the proper late game, but in my experience, there was no benefit to having junk be sold off - at early and mid game levels, anyone with any familiarity with Fo4 will know to not sell their unused junk, and having the (even at 800) cap on stash size incentivized tossing out rare or legendary objects that happened to have limited utility at the time, simply to have more room for more junk to be saved up for later. I don't like that, and I don't feel that having those restrictions in place makes the game better.
---
I never sold junk, though. I get that your experience with the game is different than mine, but I don't see how having a stash that can hold infinite junk ruins anything worthwhile: I like saving up my junk so I can use it when I need or want it. There will still be an incentive to pick off workshops - the other guy has set up the workshop for you, they're going to be carrying some on them so you can pick them off, and there's going to be junk in their resource extractors. Hell, why allow workshops to have stash boxes? Make the person have to leave the workshop to store junk in their CAMP - make it a real decision to stay or go, and give that stay or go decision meaning: going provides guaranteed safety in your stash for your junk but tosses any future rewards from the workshop out the window, while staying gets you more junk and rewards but keeps getting riskier as time goes on. That enhances your desired risk/reward balance, keeping players even richer (as all the junk on them would be fair game, and they couldn't just fill their stash then leave), while allowing me to store my insane amounts of wood and concrete _and_ a few weapons/armor/unique items that I like to keep around for nostalgia's sake. It also makes stashes more valuable, while allowing for even bigger risky loot hauls to the store to sell (assuming you don't have a stash in a store).
---
I am someone who built multiple multi-story castles in survival mode Fo4, a mode which caps workshop capacity, so believe me when I say that I get that there is a place for limited resources, but I don't feel that storage should be capped with no counterplay. I want to build castles when I get bored between quests, and I don't want to feel like my building stuff is a chore to keep my stash from getting too full. Let me build something to expand that inventory, let me upgrade by adding more containers in my CAMP, let me store stuff in my CAMP outside of my stash, let perks affect weight of items in the stash, or let me make supply lines between my and my friends' CAMPs and share expanded inventory (a boy can dream). Because there's nothing to allow me to work around the limits of the game mechanics, I'm very inclined to say "fuck those limits, seriously, or at least fuck them within every possible technological restriction".

you have a complete set of what?
---
I see this a lot with scorched. Less often with mutants but I would assume its the same bug.
---
I almost have a complete set of metal armor
---
Vendor selection is no longer randomized it is fixed so the plans that would should show up at lets say Watoga (shotgun plans) no longer randomly do I have checked the selection is preset now so no more shotgun plans I guess

That‚Äôs really interesting. Thanks for sharing!

You‚Äôre welcome!

Thanks for the idea. I might drop 5% from shotguns and 5% from commando and add starched genes.
---
I dont like the armor perks much, because my armor as is is good enough against most enemies. I can just use power armor if I'm fighting a boss and keep all my damage.
---
You have to look closely for the caps, I found two mines in the upper right of the toxic valley close to the downed space station 
---
Was then and still am now. Send me a friend request

Would that be feasible for 90 rubber a day with low chance of dying for a lv 31?

I guess that would be an issue. On a console, you just use the native messaging system such as the one on the Xbox

Hadn't noticed it with scorched, but I stick mainly to mutants for farming.  I know it's a trivial thing compared to some of the other bugs, but it wears thin when farming.

Ah well, I was considering this idea of exiting the armour in freefall, then doing the dash with speed demon, with the PA snapping back into the inventory after a min. Thanks anyway.

Server hopping for mods doesn't work anymore. Vendors have all their stuff listed at all times. You're at the wrong vendor

Go to sneak mode asap after loading or before travelling.
---
Then why go to this post you literally just commented so you could flex that I'm A LeVeL 250 and I HaVe ThE best WeApOnS in the game people actually buy this stuff because people like you pick on low levels so when they can't do anything about it they hire us to kick your ass
---
Well some people can't. We have gotten many contracts already. If you think it's stupid, that's fine, but don't be a dick and try to sabatoge a group of people trying to have fun with a game that has everything going against it. Jesus, please stop with this tough guy shit, it's annoying and rude...
---
I like talking back to them in my super mutant voice. My daughter suggested I do that on mic. Since I have cannibal perk, I like to respond to their threats of eating me in kind 
---
This guy has a lot of points here. 
---
It's 2.5 hours long, but nearly every sentence is a separate idea of something that should be fixed alternating with how it could be fixed.
---
The only time that he takes longer than a sentence to point out a flaw or a fix is when he's giving a critical detail to help explain his previous point.

Unless you removed something important, you literally could not cut down this video any shorter if you tried.

The BOS jumpsuit is a rare reward for completing quest in the Savage divide so says the wiki?? Whether events count or workshop captures I'm not sure...  I hope it wasn't bound to the what 3 or 4 quest in the quest line in SD. I want it lol

There is. Unfortunately, it's just half way across the map by the hospital

I came to call you a dingus for causing me to take the time to re-read the title of this post. That is all. Enjoy the rest of your day.

Will you be willing to relay back any reactions from yourself or the team to either us or Jon directly? Not hoping for anything top secret, of course, just general opinions and feelings.

Selling *our*

What platform are you on? I'd like to stop in for a drink

All that XP and so little time!

Hmm. I have yet to find this.

Update: I bought the jackpot and it was what /u/XxultrapataponxX basically to the T. (Top comment in the thread) not too bad at all.

PC
---
So you can't sit through a documentary or movie?
---
Sounds like a you problem. Work on your attention span.
---
Aw I'm on xbox well cool build none the less 
---
If you like getting extremely rare outfits then you could do that. I love getting rare gear so I‚Äôm a level 110 just doing events and daily quests and selling things to get more caps to buy plans I don‚Äôt have. Also looking for more legendary weapons is fun too but kinda sad when there‚Äôs no legendary in sight 
---
It's the hospital connected to the main quest. Don't know the name off the top of my head, but it's outside there. I found it in the beta.
---
"Today was a good day" playing in my head as I started swinging.
---
Yeah, there are a couple examples of this north of Pleasant Valley Station where Raider camps are booby trapped with Bottlecap Mines.
---
Maybe hire a PR guy.  Who can spell/format check your social media posts.
---
This would be great, giving these things a chance for legendary loot would make it a lot more worthwhile.
---
Going straight there next time I get on! Thanks
---
There's a token machine right outside the entrance to the mine. Jackpot reward is decent. Haven't bought any of the others
---
This should never happen.  Between being incredibly difficult and resource intensive on the client for a proper fix and a shortcut that could be abused or cause user frustration, I don't think Beth would do it.
---
Their schisty, not suicidal and they now have a target from consumer angst on their chest.  I'd expect they are weighing their fixes fairly heavily.  That doesn't mean they will do a good job or not, mind you.  Just that they at least contemplate the possible blowback beforehand.
---
Theres a visual bug with it too. When reloading, the cylinder is still in the center, while another comes out. So theres 2 cylinders 
---
I really like the look of this! 
---
I have agreed with this opinion from the beginning of the game.
---
The issue is people also get mad at the stuff that it has incommon with F4 so they want the same game as low as it doesn't have the same things.
---
People are just stupid.
---
Yes, this ^^^^^^.
---
I had been hanging on to the Daisycutter for some time but hadn't used it because my build is not reliant on heavy weapons or explosives, but just a couple days ago I decided to try it out for fun.......instant death ensues.   So I figured I must have hit something overhead right in front of me so I try it a second time and die instantaneously again, but the 3rd time, the 3rd time was my lucky day.  I fired it almost as far away as I could(approx. 45-60 degree angle) from the 2nd story balcony of my camp and most of the explosions were way off in the distance as you'd expect, except for one that landed about 20' in front of my camp.  Overall, pretty disappointing but I may keep it around to lend to my low level buddy just so I can watch him nuke himself : )
---
Mosh Pit!!!!!
---
Adhesive, aluminum, and flux. I have the flux and can make the jetpack, and I have some legs with shocks attached already. We can talk price in game. I'm about to join a Scorchbeast queen fight though. 
---
Can you elaborate? What types of things are in the team's base development philosophy?
---
And /u/LoneVaultWanderer are you able to say how compatible MATN's ideas are?
---
I don't know... I've become pretty selective about what I loot in 76.
---
But yes, one of the best things Fallout 4 did was allow you to turn that junk into something useful.  It's a deviously clever system.
---
camden park has a couple basketballs near the dross toss, i always snag them
---
Yes! That yard is a beast to defend! Amazing that you did it solo. Kudos!
---
K I was meaning what flux because I have some but not all and the rest I have Absolute mass amounts over
---
"Fallout 3 is better than you think" is one of the best/review/ memorable youtube videos I've seen so far, like top 10.  Good quality, valid points, and nice segways.  Thanks for the link.
---
That's the problem, you can't do that until after the monsters have been attacking you for a while.
---
Happy to help
---
I've heard camden is a good spot too, but how much rubber do you actually net? I remember a fair amount of scorched being there
---
I‚Äôm in..... give it to me. GIVE. IT. TO. ME.
---
I just tried mine for the first time to test this. One shell did indeed return and hit me every time, but no damage or rads was done to me at all. 
---
Is it Arktos Pharma? Or is it near the Mining Area? (Cant remember that off the top of my head lol)
---
At level 15 he was browsing all of them, we're just used to ignoring the dozens of plans plans for a water pump.  
---
you on now ? 
---
I'm kind of surprised you're only Lv. 70 at that many hours.  Outside of finding quests, what have you been doing?
---
Finding all the locations can be fun.  Doing the Daily/Weekly Challenge is kind of like having a prompt for an adventure.
---
what are you using for the bar counters?
---
If youre worried about scorched, spawn in, head along the outskirts of the parking lot and enter via the bumper cars. only 3 scorched to kill. then maybe 5-6 balls can be scavenged without agro-ing anything else. Its the 2nd best place i can think of for rubber. 
---
I steal water from C.A.M.P.S. as long as someone is home. I, for some reason, think it is funny to sneak up to someone's water purifier and take their water and slink off. Even better if they catch you and you just stare them in the eye before you take it. 
---
Try aiming super high up in the air I noticed I kept dying unless I looked basically straight up
---
Will this include keeping the work station(s) the player controlled prior to getting bumped off?
---
Near the mining area. Its also near the firefighters building.
---
Over 200 hours played and knew nothing of this
---
I thought only raw stuff spoiled... i crafted tarberry juice using the firepit
---
Bookshelves, they are pretty useful. You can stack them as well.
---
if you have slugger, expert slugger and master slugger maxed out, that will do +60 percent dmg with two handed weapons
---
As long as there's some seriously good anti-spam, I can't tell you how many douchebags I've seen shamelessly plugging their Fallout 76 Discord servers that nobody cares about
---
no that‚Äôs for plans, not mods. the mods aren‚Äôt static 
---
These are the only camps I destroy on site. Damn the bounty. 
---
Wasn't   there something  like this one the trailer the girl in the civil war era dress looking thing with 2 10mm subs
---
No
---
If you log in and someone else's camp is there, it will ask if you want to hop servers.  I thought that was a nice patch.
---
Damn, that's upsetting haha. I was really hoping there was somewhere I could at least grab like 20 ish rubber per spawn. 
---
I actually don't mind if people loot my water purifiers.  I have more than enough to go around.
---
I figure it really does no good to go around booby trapping things because it's kind of like throwing down a challenge for griefers who can't resist breaking-and-entering.  It's no skin off my back if you use the stuff in my CAMP.
---
Oh. Oh no. Now I feel terrible. I had heard stories of the Mothman, and all seemed to point towards him being a monster. So, when I came across him just staring at me, I attacked without hesitation and killed him. Now I know why he didn‚Äôt attack first. Feels bad, man. 
---
I looked it up and its the AVR Medical Center
---
Face down, ass up. That's how the Wendigo likes it.
---
Why did this get so many awards? OP is literally just reposting a video from someone else.
---
If you go to sneak mode before travelling you'll arrive with sneak mode too = no mobs will attack you. But if you were talking about logging off in a dangerous area, now that's different. Where in the world you were being attacked again? I don't think I've found a place where I fast travelled and being greeted by a pack of mobs, except for the Nuke site prime zones.
---
Like the real world ; there's dozens of forces behind any major event. Even Sept 11 2001 has a causal chain going back to at least the Crusades.
---
I was playing with a kid in Destiny once and his friend joins the party and starts swearing. He whispers "no swearing. There's adults in here" right up against the microphone and I'm just sitting there, like, "you do realize I just heard you say that, right?" I think this was also the same kid that decide he was the world's greatest beat boxer. Right up against the microphone. Didn't take me long to nope out of that party. 
---
You can't log in with sneak mode.  Quit in sneak, relaunch the game, and you will load standing there paralyzed for a minute.
---
I never gave up. I wasn't willing to give up. I'm very glad I stuck around.
---
Ok, yes this is a problem, but man does that paint a funny picture in my head. You have to admit that's a little funny.
---
Whats new is that HE hasn't done it. Thats it. Thats all. I'm subbed to Nerd and I love his shit but this is just another regurgitated F76 video that I've seen 20 times before.
---
I seem to say this a lot, but.... bladed melee.
---
Dropping now 
---
With that being said I guess one could block everyone that plays the game. Then you would have a server all to yourself lol.
---
This is on par with previous Fallout games:  Lockpick / hack are never worth it.  They give nothing useful and if they actually do, the game has a better path that doesn't waste perks.
---
I really want standalone fingerless gloves. It would give more badass points to your character.
---
oh cool thanks.
---
thanks man i will check it out next time im on :).
---
What do you mean?
---

check out the 4th bullet point.
---
You must of had a nice lamp upstairs.
---
There is a management theory word that I can‚Äôt think of right now... maybe someone can post one of those most loved ‚Äúlet me google that for you‚Äù gifs. 
---
But it‚Äôs basically what you are describing. Once management is so far in the bad decisions they just continue down the same path because fixing it would be too costly. It‚Äôs a huge fallacy in the long run. 
---
Crafted food can still spoil. Any food with a condition will spoil.
---
Once you go prime you can not switch it back, just FYI. 50 cal only has a standard receiver besides the prime, so once you commit you‚Äôll have to scrounge ultracite ammo exclusively for that particular weapon.
---
I would advise you not to do it as the increase to damage isn‚Äôt worth the increased cost of ammo crafting in my opinion.
---
Good luck on whatever you decide!
---
Imagine the EXP
---
Cool. Now hands up, give me all your caps, and the raiders might let you live.
---
That first part regarding lower level players doing less because they are low level isn't true, per say.
---
The armor system punishes you for having a lower per shot damage, and lower levels tend to have a lower per shot damage, and less access to certain anti armor effects, but if you have the same gun and perks you deal the same damage regardless of player level.
---
Letting me live implies I have a life to begin with.
---
To me, these are the moments of the early game in 76 that really shine.  When you're learning how to improvise and make the best out of a bad situation.  A lot of players, unfortunately, would rather server hop than run.  But becoming the hunted is what's so thrilling about the Scorchbeasts, and that ability to improvise becomes an important skill as the game progresses.
---
Now, the game throws three Scorchbeasts and a Mothman at me, and I say "Bring it."
---
Saw 2 different red lights and got one calibrated shock server hoping MODUS today
---
Ah, right you are. I thought using the cooking station removed the condition bar, but I was wrong.
---
Dude that's awesome! Their way ahead of me. I guess we're done here then.
---
So instead of shared worlds, instead opting in for the ability to have community servers? I think having that be an option should definitely be a play style, but I still think they should offer easy "click play and play" as well.
---
I think the new adventure vs PvP game modes should help with the whole softcore survival issue hopefully. They can potentially make the survival element more hardcore for PvP servers and remove the bad softcore elements for PvE.
---
Dang. 
---
&gt; Pick up ALL loot ALWAYS when possible. This ensures the server doesn't get bogged down. 
---
Whenever I tried to loot dead bodies in Nuke Prime site it's always the circling arrow. The loot always showed up after the fight ended; (or 2-3 mins after) I can't even loot my own brown bag after dying in the nuke zone, it's always that circling arrow.
---
Every time I tried to make that happen it just stayed owned by me forever. And then I felt like an ass for hogging a workshop I wasn't actually using. I wouldn't have minded someone taking it from me, but at over lvl 120 most people see my level and are too scared to try it, haha.
---
If he disappeared in one shot, you didn't kill him. Mothman has an ability where he vanishes in a puff of dust. The neutral version does that trick if you attack. The hostile version does that and then *reappears next to you*, where he keeps attacking.
---
Ita okay. They were damn dirty synths anyway.
---
Anyone know when or if this will come back?
---
They can‚Äôt even get the ‚Äúfind a new sever‚Äù thing when your camp can‚Äôt be loaded right.
---
Three times I‚Äôve loaded in and accepted the ‚Äúfind another server‚Äù option.
---
All 3 times I‚Äôve been sent to an endless load screen and had to dump the game and relog.
---
Fallout has always needed this sine the time when they gave you a house instead of dropping, picking up and trying to put down an item like you have a broken wrist 
---
I was thinking the exact same thing. 
---
I did that, but in Skyrim once. Three dragons and then some high level draugr. They just kept coming.
---
I'm constantly swapping out my perk cars, but I'll tell you what I run. I'm melee &amp; auto rifle (need a good gun for SBQ while she's in the air - I use a TSE Handmade). I have some of the same perk cards ranked to 2 and then 3 so I can mix and match. 
---
This is what I'd take to a SBQ fight: 
---
S - lvl 2 Incisor, lvl 3 martial artist, lvl 2 chem redux, lvl 3 2 hand melee, lvl 3 two hand melee, lvl 2 two hand melee 
---
P - 3 lvl 3 auto rifleman perk cards (total of 9 here) 
---
E - lvl 2 Ghoulish, lvl 3 Life Giver
---
C - lvl 3 Tendorizer (must have), lvl 1 rad sponge (to share)
---
I - lvl 5 Demolition (only good if u have an explosive weapon), lvl 1 power user
---
A - lvl 5 Adrenaline (must have), lvl 3 Thru Hiker
---
L - lvl 3 Class Freak, Lvl 2 Starched Genes, Lvl 3 Bloody Mess (must have)
---
Mutations: (I run almost all) but twisted muscles is great for melee
---
After the fight is over, I'll take off melee boosts and use strong back or pack rat to help with weight. 
---
Hopefully this helps üòä
---
im so happy i stayed and kept ploughing along on my merry way.
---
Ignoring dupers and exploiters, meeting new people, farming cool shit.
---
See you out there :)
---
Thanks, I have only seen a couple of them before tonight
---
The bar is done with shelves? Very creative! Could I add you and check it out in game? I'm on PC, IGN Avasarala, but I have no clue if I can add you as a friend while either you or me is offline.
---
That's some stranger things shit right there.
---
I have either encountered this bug this week or my weapons are trash
---
Will have to do that event more, thanks
---
For me that would be a big accomplishment! I‚Äôm level 50 and I still find a scorch heats a challenge let alone 3? I think it‚Äôs a big deal
---
Yea, every time I go there it has been wiped clean
---
Thanks
---
Dunno why everyone is excited for a FO3 release, it was almost as linear of a story as 76. Not even any factions to join. I'll accept the downvotes for saying the truth
---
Shouldn‚Äôt you be on the bazaar sub instead of cluttering the main sub because you think you‚Äôre more special than everyone else who uses the right sub?
---
I‚Äôm not sure if this was related but I remember loading into a fairly populated area after quitting suddenly the session before. Everything was empty so I assume maybe a guy just came through and killed the enemies. But then my health starts going down and I hear the sound of hitting. My weapons hadn‚Äôt even loaded yet so I sprinted away and it stopped then came back and some ghouls were there. Was I being attacked before enemies even loaded? Did it glitch and I just lost health for no reason? Idk. Ultimately it didn‚Äôt matter but was a bit annoying
---
It‚Äôs like the Black Cowboy hat in whitespring. Easily found but easily overlooked.
---
Some unknowing player may pay extra
---
Lets give bethesda a break 
---
Theres a couple things you can do:
---
1. Ensure before the fight everyone picks up the loot from each enemy killed from the very start. So the loot cap never is exceeded. 
---
2. After the event is over, fast travel to Watoga and back to where all the loot is. Usually this fixes the perma-loading you may be experiencing (you still need to find what was dropped first though). 
---
3. Never leave anything behind. This makes it worse. Just loot everything and drop what you dont want after. 
---
What generally happens is very quickly the server limit of loot-able items gets capped and the rest of the loot does the "loading circle". You need everyone to be pro-active and loot anything that dies the second it dies. 
---
There is also an order in which you can loot items from the first thing that died to the last. So what i usually end up doing is looking for the first enemies that died during the event. Then once you start collecting items, a sort of cascading effect happens and then more and more items begin to load in. 
---
If you do this during Whitespring Nukes after Ghouls spawns in the tennis court, sometimes the next wave of Ghouls will spawn quickly. There has been times where my team of 4 were looting so much and so quickly that Ghouls spawned over and over. It was crazy. 
---
Fallout 76 has broken that habit for me. Starting out with such a small stash has made me prioritize. Now when I play my lvl 100+ I rarely pick anything up.
---
Now I have to find that.. thanks
---
Not true at all.
---
Interesting! One of these says CHEAT the other says "something" KNOB. 
---
Downstairs hanging on a wheelchair handle. A skeleton sits in the wheelchair.

AVR medical center?
---
Sure ill add you, it's just Carrek for me.
---
POTENTIAL CONTENT! You guys a deranged.
---
Better odds if you don‚Äôt fast travel.
---
you need to trigger random events by going to certain spots. The more spots you walk past the better the chance
---
That worked. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôve had the ‚Äústalking mothman‚Äù attack me on three different occasions.   I pop into my PA, he eventually gives up after a few attacks and vanishes.  Scared the hell out of me the first time.   I‚Äôve never seen the wise type (passive one)
---
Sometimes he can be sitting there and you‚Äôd really have to look. I almost ran into one today not paying attention. But I‚Äôve been seeing him plenty of times even before the event. Mostly by whitesprings area for me 
---
I compared Google maps to the in game map, found that Morgantown and Grafton are basically switched places, best I could tell.
---
This is totally doable solo. It took me about an hour at lvl 45 using a lever action and combat shotgun in some heavy leather armor, ideal for energy weapons. It used up a lot of ammo and a decent amount of chems, but was doable, just a bit tedious. I'm sure you have a lot of chems, use them. 
---
lvl 50 and how many caps r u willing, my sir.
---
It sucks cause I've already done most things in the game while in it's mostly buggy state, and while i don't regret my time spent, i wish i could see everything with fresh eyes again (an alt doesn't help that experience)
---
If you have all of them, you only need starched genes when you take a rad away... and honestly, not even always then, since if you lose one, it's pretty easy to get that one back when you don't have to worry about getting the *wrong* one back.
---
He‚Äôs showed up at my CAMP by Site Alpha 4 times in the last few days.  I built a bunch of Mothman stuff from the Atomic shop but I don‚Äôt know if it has anything to do with it.  Scared me every time though haha!  
---
Yes!! Stay Filthy!!
---
Ah I'm new to the game so I'm still picking up everything I can.  Mostly desk fans, adhesive items, oil and ceramic.  Will probably have to break my habit sooner or later lol
---
I watched this earlier and he made some very good points. 
---
At least we‚Äôre literate.
---
Nice!
---
I know he passes by Pleasant Valley Station heading north along the road.  The station near the top of the world.  That entire road I speculate he travels along 
---
I love this story.  üòÅüëç
---
He spawns at my CAMP, 9/10 times he's there when I log in. Thank you FO for the free ballistic fiber! 
---
Screws and springs. You'll thank me later when you build your Excavator Power Armor.

Get some more levels under your belt, hit it after a nuke, and you'll love it. Hang out inside the mall for a chance to grab discarded legendaries on the ground that people lay lying around while they grind. Most player interactions I've had have thankfully been great. The few sour ones have been terrible. 
---
That somebitch won't leave me alone! Every time I port back to my base I have to be ready. Walking down the road, coming out of the train station,  doesn't matter.  I kill it and there's another set of red eyes around the corner. Driving me nuts.
---
Yes great idea! It is such a pain to have to switch cards for every work bench.. kudos to you!
---
True but i have a bad habit of not checking.  xD
---
Yep, doing a Gone With the Wind twirl.
---
*The hills are aliiiive....*   (GUNFIRE)

That's understandable, so not directly nerfing melee legendary effects, but rather reorganize the way certain perks and legendary effects stack/interact with eachother makes sense. Regarding ranged attacks, I'm not sure on the "significantly part" I still 2-3 shot "difficult enemies" my level I'm just more annoyed on how this 2-3 shotting trend continues down to lower level enemies, which I should be one shotting. I know this goes against perception and how it works, but maybe they can add weapon accuracy (perhaps even dmg) to ranged weapons as your perception increases. Correct me if I'm wrong, but currently the way I see it, Perception only affects the accuracy of your vats (which is still useful, but vats doesn't work in long range sneak attacks 50-100m, so it's useless in that regard).

It seems the day of a Stash increase, I almost max it out in 2 minutes

Fuck factions.

Lone wanderer style
---
It's pretty organized, edited and well presented. 
---
Perhaps you ought to spend more than a second organizing the tripe you call thoughts, at least before you post them up with the obvious intent to be snide. See I can seethe with snide commentary too, it doesn't actually make me look smart. 
---
I was,clearly, in rage mode when making this thread post and lacked central common sense to see the other perspective at the time. Sorry about this whole argument here, and I respect your point of perspective regarding this whole topic. Once again, very immature of me to argue in such a manner.
---
I was in rage mode when posting this thread so I lacked the ability to see the other perspective, sorry about the immature way I handled this thread.
---
Dont ever compare this disaster of a launch to Ethier of those lmao this was by far the absolute worst 
---
You can buy them from the enclave vendor
---
This is great! What platform are you on? Would love to stop by and take a look! Well done
---
You must have forgotten those other two launches completely then.
---
Where did you find the info about eckharts father? ive looked in all the enclave terminals and cant find it.
---
My run is Morgantown High School gym to crazy cat lady house, rinse and repeat.

I love all the thumbs down on a simple sentence lol
---
I'd like to see a new Vegas sequel, or reboot or hell, even a prequel.. Like before you got shot in the face..

‚ÄúUS!‚Äù
---
A need? No. Optional feature disabled by default, perhaps. Silent lone wanderer type.
---
I'm on PC, you can add me if you want. It's going to be just under Carrek.
---
Doesn't look like a bad build to me. Not sure what else you can do to get more of a damage output then your already are but there are a couple of things to be aware with that build though.
---
- You have Starch Genes (for mutations) but no Class Freak perk so you will get some downsides to the mutations.
---
- You will need to watch your weight in order to use Pain Train. You can't run if you are over weight and Pain Train needs you to be running to work. Martial Artist helps for weapon weight but Batteries Included per may help your Fusion Core weight as they can get really heavy. Alternatively if you get some Calibrated Shock on your armor you may get away with not using any weight perk cards.
---
You probably listen to coldplay
---
I got mine from Harpers Ferry vendor. One would show up each day, i didnt try server hopping.
---
I beta‚Äôd WoW. WoW actually had a real beta. It released in a better state than this by a mile. The biggest problem was it was so much more popular than anyone predicted and servers got blown out. 
---
Oh I would love too..but I'm xbox. :( Well your place looks cool. Like it belong there.
---
&gt; It wouldn't surprise me if brats ignore the PvP server
---
I'm pretty sure Griefer Island is going to remain deserted. 
---
We'll have to agree to disagree, or just disagree.
---
Bladed baseball bat or fire ax with puncturing blades in it are best melees. These worked on level 60+ when o was in low 30‚Äôs.
---
Sure.  Or don't get gud.  If you paid for the game you can play how you goddamn want.  No matter if fatboyonsofa thinks you are gud or not gud.  Not everybody cares man.
---
I think maybe you're thinking of [sunk cost fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/173/Sunk-Cost-Fallacy).

Helvetia has a massive pile of wood piles, if you hit that once a day you'll be swimming in it. Be careful for splinters.

You've misunderstood.  I was responding to the guy arguing against you.

Why are they so rare right now?

Walked from top of the world to cranberry bog. Saw him 5 times. 
---
I had a moth man shrine in my old base and he never blessed me with his presence, what is this blasphemy?!
---
* Must keep the grind, can't make content fast enough so any way of speeding up progress is nerfed. This ties into a few of the next points.
---
* Durability - scrap loop is rough. Never adjusted though (look how long energy weapon fixes have taken), as it's got to stay a grind even if people want longer lasting weapons or cheaper repairs.
---
* Switching to max number item ids rather than weight for the stash? No, we need to limit the stash to make sure players can't hoard too much junk and escape the grind loop. We'll just add a few pounds to placate the playerbase rather than allow unlimited junk storage.
---
* Is the playerbase using a perk too much, so much that it's seen as "required"? Nerf the perk, rather than do some introspection on why that perk was "required" in the first place. It's always the players breaking our systems, rather than our systems being broken.
---
It's things like this, especially the last one, that make me think the devs aren't willing to change their mindsets when they view feedback. It's going to make taking anything this video has to say in a way that affects positive change really difficult.
---
White Springs / West Tek Research Center  are good places as well.
---
Naw, he tried to take a stage dive off the roof, but then the player showed up and distracted everyone
---
yea u have to leave the server
---
Them they are being inconsiderate dicks.  My issue is not with camps with turrets but with people not thinking about working with others to make it work.  Regardless how.
---
If you‚Äôve got a targeting HUD try removing that effect. I‚Äôve had many less crashes without it. 
---
Just walk. Walk everywhere. If you where random event spawn locations are, hit those up. Some people have reported seeing him at Whitesprings (I personally did not, but saw Grafton and Flatwoods Monsters instead.)
---
I saw Mothman in the woods outside the Munitions Factory. I saw him in the woods behind Vault 76. I saw him in the woods behind the Ingram Mansion. All of these, I was walking around looking for him, just exploring and enjoying scenery. :)
---
You're comparing somebody's YouTube commentary about a video game to watch a movie...
---
It's all about what you have time for in your life.
---
Two and a half hour videos just are not accessible. As such he's limiting the number of people who will see it and that's hear his message that is my only point.
---
1500?
---
I have a Zealot's Grognak's Axe that's been serving me well against the queen. 
---
Never encountered one in the wild save for the daily that spawns it. Just today within a span of 2 hrs 2 vengeful mothmen spawned. 1 at monogah overlook and 1 at the red rocket after a enclave event. Both in the upper right of the map. They‚Äôre an ass to kill too lol 
---
That‚Äôs why I love Jon. His videos can be long, but he never wastes words - he always fills his videos with worthwhile, intelligent commentary / analysis and he doesn‚Äôt compromise his arguments for the sake of people like you. He would rather produce something ridiculously long, and in the process make something he feels good about, than create ‚Äúdigestible‚Äù content whose quality he‚Äôd have to sacrifice for the sake of brevity. It‚Äôs hugely respectable, and the fact that he can also make such long videos *entertaining* too - he‚Äôs just a brilliant dude. I hope he never changes.
---
IGN lazarus801 if you wanna join and chat about it 
---
Was knee jerk reaction, so I can't deny you might be right and it's all good.
---
I tried a rug a long time ago, it wouldnt work for me. That would be awesome if they work now, ill have to give it a try
---
he's the only thing that keeps me coming back to youtube the past few years. incredible and engaging content. 
---
Nuked White Springs, West Tek, and Harper's Ferry are the best. What are you looking for?
---
Two shots, Explosive, etc.
---
Because it‚Äôs the best FO of the 1st person ones. 
---
Then farm the xp near the back door?  Farm it by the turret base?

&gt; I pretty sure it said somewhere that me multiboxed which does require a third party program in order to control two characters at once. 
---
No it isn't. You can set both games to run windowed borderless and set them to always be ontop. Then all you have to do is set the resolutions for both of them to use half, or a quarter of the screen. No need for any third party program at all.
---
Ah. Right sorry. It takes Cobalt and Violet
---
I have a pump action, and assault rifle I can sell if youve got the caps.
---
You got what was coming to you.
---
Yeah I have had the issue as well

Thats plasma gatling, if I remember right

I mostly meant that there wasn't any variation to different playthroughs

A lvl 1 Perception Perk Card - Locked n' Loaded 50% weight reduction for rifles

Fire extinguishers give some rubber also.

Alternatively, they can just make more sounds like white springs; we are fighting over an artificially created shortage in demand that is outweighed by supply.

Honestly xenu, we need you back.

2060 is like 300 the 1660ti is about the same 
---
I tend to sprint around a lot because I hate paying caps for fast-traveling. Any time I'm in the middle of actually doing something (going to meet a friend, running to a blast zone, trying to dodge a scorch beast), the damn Mothman shows up.
---
So my advice, if you want to find him: be on your way to something important.
---
I am unfortunately overencumbered so ur gonna have to FT to me if that's fine
---
I didn't know that fast travelling to Watoga and back to where the SBQ body will fix the loading circle. Will try it the next time I kill SBQ. Thanks for the info! I just hope that the SBQ's body wont turn into a meat pile lol it's gonna be hard to find her "meat pile" among the other meat piles.
---
Cool no prob 
---
Interesting... my thought has always been that keeping people within a fixed server would lead to more interesting exploration, but I suppose it does lead to the very real problem of locking players out of game content because of the actions of others - ie if we fully accepted Jon's suggestions in terms of allowing players to leave a permanent mark wherever they please (which I would personally love), then you could end up in a situation where player built structures clash with the tone and feel of the area - like if someone were to build a town within a previously hostile area, new players would no longer have access to the loot farming possibilities that place housed.
---
So yeah, I suppose if they were to offer community servers along with what they already do, we could have both options. People who are just looking to explore the world and play it as a post-apocalyptic detective game could enjoy the game as is, while people on community servers could have the roleplaying experiences they want.
---
So it is my understanding that video games now have to abide by an accessibility law with in game chats now.  It is an odd law, some of which makes sense and some of which doesnt.  The basics are that there needs to be a text to voice chat system for there to be text chat, which is great for blind gamers (don't know stats on how many there are).  Also in my readings there isn't much about voice to text, for deaf gamers, which I would imagine are less rare than blind.  Anyways here are a few articles on the subject.

---
Haha, I only have 201 caps rn, thanks for the offer though
---
Jon's Fo3 video was a direct response to another YouTuber's video about how terrible it was. So yes, people DO hate Fallout 3.
---
Yes.
---
So what exactly is the difference? The subject matter? That's what I thought. Have a nice night.
---
I just started playing today and I had this happen.  I had built a small tower and had another player show up.  I had a door, with a level 3 lock on it- but he just smashed it with a sledgehammer and then set to work on my turrets.   I was level 4 at the time, couldn't fight back.   I don't mind PvP, what I don't understand why my turrets wouldn't fire on someone who was wanted, and damaging them.  
---
My only option was to log out and rejoin.   He just kept on playing, I get punished with loading screens.
---
Now I'm wondering if it isn't better to just put the crafting stuff right on the ground.
---
Game crashed re joining 
---
Thank you for looking into this.
---
Friends

I'm over in the southern right hand corner at watoga

I usually just use grenades for them

Damn it honey hold the door open a Moth got inside the house
---
Glorious XP!

I play almost every evening after work, approximately 1800-2200 of and on. I had my first disconnect this week on Saturday then another on Sunday, Saturday was during a Whitesprings nuke then the Sunday one was server hopping to place my camp. Playing on PC also. 
---
If you're sneaking along and get a caution/danger, but theres no enemies nearby, then he see's you.
---
Happened just south of Summerville, I ran into the nursery story Miss Nanny, went into sneak so I could listen to the whole story and get the rewards worry free. Suddenly got DANGER but none of the super mutants in town were coming for me. Looked up the grassy slope to the right just as the Miss Nanny was finishing Hansel and Gretel and there he was
---
TIL How to decrypt the nuke codes haha. Excellent video btw, specially liked the explanation about the challenge/grind ratio and the misinformated lottery that exists in the game. Sorry for the tag u/LoneVaultWanderer but would really love to hear the dev team's opinion on this topic and they sharing their thoughts to the community, I think I'd be an amazing addition to a future livestream. Also very nice to see you back on YouTube :)
---
I wish I could like this 50 times. SOOOO ANNOYING, especially around turrets in workshop PVP.
---
The killed all four of us... it was great...
---
Phoenix has them sometimes
---
k. thnx.
---
just got one from event
---
Unfortunately,  I feel your pain,  there really no point to do a tank build here in 76...  While I have 400 hp, the trade off for overall damage make my time on target high.  I really hope the add a legendary weapon effect or something that let's you tank proper. 
---
I have never watched all of a 2 and a half hour YouTube video before, even in multiple sittings... until now (riveted to my chair from start to finish). I so want to play in his Fallout76 world.
---
What's your build/weapons?
---
Only times you'll ever catch me wrecking another player's camp is if it is placed directly behind the golf club at Whitesprings, or if they attacked any of my teammates/teammates camp(s). Personally don't care if it's mine they wreck, I'll just move it or leave the server. People who run around wrecking and leveling camps for no reason are just assholes
---
Weapon Artisan so you can repair weapons past 100%. Over repaired weapons do more damage
---
Again. Nobody MADE you buy it, it‚Äôs one thing for a company to lie about a game to make it sound appealing but they can‚Äôt force you to put a game in your cart and purchase it. 
---
3 peices of unyielding and a bloody fist weapon will 1 shot 90 % of players
---
I have a 1 hour refund policy, if u dont like anything about the weapon/it doesnt suit ur needs, u have 1 hour to initiate a refund starting from this notice. Thanks so much for ur business
---
Thank you. Much appreciated. 
---
I would recommend the 1660ti. About same performance as a 2060, but cheaper and without *ray tracing* ~which is a very useful feature that every game has^and you'll definitely be disappointed tomiss out on~
---
Well that's good then if he has an audience and he's producing a product that they appreciate.
---
However I was merely pointing out that he's limiting the reach of his message, because a lot of people with real lives don't have time to watch a 2-hour video. No matter how entertaining it might be. I certainly wouldn't want him to dumb down his videos, that's not at all what I was suggesting. I was suggesting however that there might be a better way to organize them or split them up in order to make them more accessible.
---
The first thing I noticed were several comments from people who didn't have time to watch the video. I'm getting hated on, not by you but by others, for pointing that out.
---
It's a shame I would have liked to watch this, but I'd rather spend time with my girlfriend and actually play the game itself.
---
I also can say that if his ideas are as good as you're saying then it's a shame because someone like Todd Howard it's not going to watch a two and a half hour video either. We can only hope that he has someone watch it and give him a summary.
---
In development... rifle/melee. Made a lot of mistakes early on with perk cards...playing catch up 
---
Oh I don't know... maybe its an uncool thing to do now but I have used other people's turret batteries to my advantage before.   I tag the ghouls then kite them to the battery and let the battery do most the work while I grab the loot.    It has been a while since I have done that, mostly because I can kill those things now, easily enough on my own.
---
Everytime I make a group post on xbox I either get depressed adults or super hyper 9 year olds. I‚Äôve just learned to accept both sides of the spectrum really
---
Invest in stealthboys, hallucigen gas grenades, and something that does over 200 damage.  The fireproof perk reduces explosive damage, as well as padded and dense mods for armor.  Use vats if you have to, and use berry mentats if they're stealthed.  Blocker reduces melee damage as well.  Happy hunting.
---
The Grafton monster has me puzzled, what kind of creature is that?
---
   (I know it's not a Horta)
---
The difference is I can watch a movie with my girlfriend.  If I have two and a half hours to sit down and watch TV, do I watch this guy's video what do I spend time with my significant other watching something that we can both enjoy?
---
Yes that's my personal situation, but a lot of other people have a similar situation. That was my only point. That by being 2 hours long, unfortunately a lot of people won't be able to invest the time to see it and hear his ideas. The first thing I saw when I came to this thread was the number of comments from people who didn't have the time to watch the video.
---
This is a great point mate. Letting the team know now. Thank you for this
---
He always tries to look for reasons to like a game, and almost never just jumps on a hate bandwagon for a quick jump to his view count.

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

Never said people DON'T hate it. However, the whole point is stupid. Tell those fo3+ haters to whine some more. Nobody cares. Just know they are the minority, says the GOTY title fo3 recieved, plus the mass following and fo4 goty nomination. Oh no an rpg arcade game was turned into a fps rpg. Big whoop. You cant change the opinions of casul morons.
---
Should add... using someone's gun battery helped me get the freakin sword when I was a lowbie.
---
I. HATE.PLAYER.INSTANCES.

Huh, I just got mine and haven't fired off a payload yet. I guess it's gonna sit in the stash box for now. Thanks for the heads up.

So tempted on mods but scared of a ban

I said they're correlated you moron. Nobody said they coded to each other.

and joining a server in a nuke zone. now that nukes are everywhere but whitesprings these days.

Does he just stalk you or does he run right at you to attack? I‚Äôve gotten a [CAUTION] a few times but didn‚Äôt see any enemies.
---
You can sneak past SB, the crickets, not so much.

It‚Äôs a glitch. You usually fix it by storing it then putting it back 
---
Im going to need a jetpack for my X01!! Do i just add you on live?
---
I‚Äôll be good, replacing one I lost by accidentally selling it like a dummy.  Thanks again. 
---
I hope they update it and improve it. I love fallout so it would be really nice. 
---
He stalks but if you get close enough you will know he is coming. He has unique fighting sounds. Really cool actually 
---
Yeah, that's what I started this whole conversation with you moron, why the fuck would you just repeat me like you're bringing up some crazy new idea. Take your autism somewhere else.
---
What I'm saying is pretty simple. You're choosing to misunderstand it. 
---
Decon all the combat armor you can,  lots of events reward it. Tho it's a hell of a grind to unlock all the mods,  as far as I understand,  each time you decon something it's RNG asigned a value of 0-4. 4 being a rare/good mod and 0 being nothing unlocked. 
---
The loops
---
I have the asus astrix, works great.
---
The Youtuber Oxhorn has nice lore videos of pretty much everything in the game. Just find the videos he made on any area, person, or quest you are curious about and chances are he has a video on it that goes really deep into the lore.
---
oh boi i did that one too many times. The other day (by other day I mean 2 months ago) I went ahead and accidentally sold a 2* vanguard piece with a really good 2nd perk, and i only realized it like 10 mins after, when i went back to the same vendor, it was being occupied by another person, who I assume bought it since I didn't see the piece ever again. :(
---
I showed up to some kids camp and the first thing he says over the mic is.

"Mom some guy is in my base"

So nice!

---
If you're willing to part with Atom points, the Mothman PA skin comes with red lights for all power armors (except excavator and ultracite, if I remember correctly)
---
Two shot is still great when stacked with the right perks. In the past, I think people could one shot kill everything with maybe one point in each level of rifleman, but now you have  to actually put in some real investment.  I have a two shot combat shotgun with nine points in shot gunner, stacked with 5 adrenaline and bloody mess  maxed out and it does fine. 
---
Exactly.  This post should damn near be stickied in hopes that the dev team takes a lot of these ideas to the drawing board.  Hell, Bethesda should hire the damn guy.  His video put into words so many issues I've had with the game but had difficulty quantifying.
---
Yeah, even though you bring up a good point of the situation/tone of the player created buildings I was also thinking of the point community servers aren't always the best place to play if you're just planning on co-op/solo. Not only for the points you bring up, but also I've found in other survival games if you only have the options to play on a community server, if you don't "join" the community they can end up pretty toxic towards you, and admins or something might have bias. 
---
For someone who just wants to drop in and out and experience what the game itself has to offer in terms of story/quests a community server would be a way worse option than the drop in/out of what we have now.
---
ones in generator house of thunder mt

Yeah I agree, New Vegas kinda starts on that path of making some of that relevant but 4 really makes you want to pick up a lot of junk.

I never thought to use gas grenades for pvp.  How is your opponent affected?

That would be where ‚Äúmute for session‚Äù comes in handy

I played it from Black Friday to mid-February.  I put at least 100 hours in.  I‚Äôm not parroting anything anyone else is saying.  This is purely my opinion:  Fallout 76 is a bad game.  Not terrible, but definitely bad. 
---
I enjoyed most of the time I spent playing, but eventually the combination of game breaking bugs, terrible patch QA and the age-old ‚Äúthere‚Äôs really not much to do in the game‚Äù was too much.  I‚Äôve uninstalled the game, and won‚Äôt be coming back. 
---
Ever since I asked this sub if anyone‚Äôs seen him during the buff, he‚Äôs shown up repeatedly near me.  He‚Äôs like an annoying barfly, asking me to spot a few bucks for his drink.
---
I wanna yell, go home you‚Äôre drunk.
---
Ok awesome, I‚Äôll grab bloody mess perks next. As I do have almost all of the rifleman perks maxed beside Master. 2 more. 
---
I have also noticed a huge increase in dmg, just slicing through those ghouls at white springs now. 
---
I got mine from breaking down. I'm not sure if the BOS ones you loot off Taggerdy have a better chance on breakdown.
---
But we are goddamn special!
---
Lol 3 patches the first few weeks of release from player feedback, CMs posting all over their reddit on the first few days of release, better priced cosmetics than 76, about 5% of the bugs 76 had.
---
MFW I touch soggy food when I wash the dishes
---
That's on design.  They took away the randomness of it,  but raised the prices.  You don't have to wait and get lucky anymore... but you do need to farm up some caps.
---
Ok that may have been mean my bad. But seriously Ghouls are the easiest most pure fun way to level up get Legendaries and get xp. For the life of me I can't see why anyone would need turrets for them. That's my biggest peeve with the turrets well that and fucking rockets but we all hate rockets
---
In fact the only challanging enemy in the game are the Yao Gaui (I love springs) Rad Scorpions, and SB and honestly the SB are just annoying and a waste of resources.
---
I know right? I picked up an explosive Handmade today but wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with it. Before rifle perks it only does around 80 damage. Is it still a favorite among rifle players? 
---
and you people act like false bans never happen and you wonder why your game is dying its cause toxic people like you are helping drive the stake further in. enjoy being the cause of the game you fight so hard to keep alive dying cause you didnt band together to get bethesda to double check their systems. 
---
It makes the screen all blurry like a head cripple.
---
The meat piles tend to drop where the SBQ lands (if she‚Äôs killed in mid air) and not where it tumbles.  Often people are expecting it to spawn where the body ends up being, which is where the issue is.
---
If you have headphones on listen to the flies and look at the various meat piles.  If they‚Äôre spinning, come back to it later.
---
**Just wait until Player Vending at your camp is a thing.....lol**
---
This will happen MUCH more often :)
---
They should've made the player vending machines indestructible and in some central hub that's a no-build location.
---
its a law. its a asshole thing to do to just ignore it cause it doesnt affect older games.
---
Yea but make you squishy enough a rad chicken could kill you. Need unyielding cavalier if melee or unyielding sentinal if bloodied range

Any vids online, or other proof of the quality of your service?

I have a picture of half of us and I have people who can vouch for us

lol that slayed me. I laughed for several minutes. nice.
---
this.
---
Same here. Even if many use it with no issue, this is clearly a third-party addon to automate inputs, and that kind of thing is usually a red flag for online games. Depending on the game, a keyboard macro to do two actions can get you banned.
---
As much as I want to use this, I‚Äôm wary.

Another key for "Target anything"

will this help much? been lagging after the patch especially with the queen. :(
---
Both types. I was playing all day today and couldn't get it to work until just now. I think there might be some interaction with some other perk, disease, or high rads.

I don't min push to talk but I play on PC with my XBox Controller which means the push to talk button doesn't work for me.
---
Anyhow text is better, I prefer typing even in games like Apex L and Division 1
---
I'd estimate 20-30% depending on how much you reduce things.
---
Thank you so much for the tips at the end! I‚Äôll be sure to use them next time I go up against a sbq

Speaking of stupid comments? You asking me if I'm his mom. I'm not allowed an opinion?
---
This Thread is literally full of people mentioning that they can't devote 2 and 1/2 hours to watch a video, asking for summaries and whatnot.
---
I just noticed this, thought it's a shame it's so many people want to but are not able to watch the video. I point this out and people like you are hating on me for it.
---
For the record I think it's great that he put the amount of time he put into it, and it sounds like a lot of people really like his ideas and that's great. It's a shame however that a lot of people will simply see a 2 and 1/2 hour video and move along
---
Same happened to me today.  Stopped once I repaired it.   
---
&gt; just to mess with them can be entertaining for both of you
---
99/100 the other player does not find wasting their mats on repairs to be enjoyable. I‚Äôm around lvl 250, and I also don‚Äôt enjoy losing three times as many caps when I die as the lvl 80 something with the exact same weapons and armor they bought from some duper. Pvp on the game is fucked up, just like the players who spend their time messing with people who just want to build, relax, and pve. 
---
Of the half dozen or so assholes who‚Äôve attacked my base, the only mildly enjoyable experience was where I didn‚Äôt have any workshops when I saw their 4-5 orbital strikes incoming before I left the server. Glad that cunt wasted the mats to make them and was robbed of any enjoyment. 
---
Recent events actually made me more glad that I left. I plan on jumping back in fresh when survival comes out. I imagine it will feel much better having been removed from the game, then coming back with the new content/fixes. 
---
And yes I read Shogun.
---
Did u figure anything out with this? I normally run melee/Unyielding and my melee boosts over 1500 but the dmg on the handmade isn't moving
---
How can you farm during the 30 seonds that you're loading and can't move?
---
It's not really dlc because some content possibly most of it was already planned for release but wasn't finished in time, like the Frontier scouts
---
Thanks! Will try after work.
---
bethesda is gonna consider it guess you trolls loose hah justice
---
Yes please! My little brother is deaf and a huge fallout fan.. Even though he loved the world he hasn't played since like a week after beta because he said without any text he felt really lonely and unable to make friends. It would be really nice to be able to play the game with people like my brother without needing an outside program to communicate. 
---
Yep. Figured that out some time back. 
---
Idk lol maybe you can play skeeball at the fairgrounds
---
reviews say otherwise... 
---
Haha that's great! SPACE MAN APPROVES OF THIS NUKE!
---
You're glad he wasted mats, but not glad when they waste yours.  Now you see why we do it.
---
one of the best issues is when it targets a grenade i just threw that is on its way to the targets
---
You people: **(brag about literal griefing)**
---
Also you people: lmao guess you trolls lose, haha
---
Implication is that players will find how to mess with the invisibility trigger so the game will keep thinking they're not fully loaded even if everything else works as normal.
---
Everyone leaves the vault with 1 in each special, unlike every other game.  Vault 76 was a control vault of idiots, weaklings and all around stooges. 
---
Same thing happened to my gamma gun today. I guess the vengeful mothman  I used it on robbed me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Occasionally, not all the armor or power armor will load as equipped. Giving an extra second or two to enable them would be much appreciated as well. 
---
Yes. Oxhorn makes great, easy to digest lore videos, with every juicy detail packed into a 20 minute video (most of the time)
---
I just did an SBQ even an hour ago. Yes she‚Äôs way harder to kill now. I‚Äôve used about 1000 rounds of Gatling (bloodied explosive) and 1000 rounds of 50 cal (bloodied non explosive). This is non stop shooting during her flight and landed. I also took psychotat which increased 25% damage I believe. She died when there was only 12 sec left. In the past it took me only about 500 rounds of explosive Gatling no chems. She would also stand still for longer duration so melee guys could contribute. Now most of the time she‚Äôs just a flying bullet sponge and sometimes she flied way far away I thought she would‚Äôve just disappeared. They‚Äôve definitely changed the algo and made it a lot harder. 
---
No text chat makes it pretty much impossible to communicate with one of my friends who doesn't feel comfortable using a mic.   Like even Sea of Thieves rather quickly threw it in before launch.  Not sure why Fallout 76 hasn't done it yet.  
---
Yes, this was a stupid change they made a couple of patches ago.
---
I mean I'm glad that the game I paid money for is getting better, but this still doesn't excuse the amount of time it's taken to get this game into a semi-playable state.
---
Hell the heavy and laser weapons balance is the even in yet, so uh, still not at a point I'd call it workable.
---
Glad they're at least fixing their game though.
---
OMG a duplication glitch?!?! Better tack on a few more months to keep the suspended accounts BANNED ;)
---
&gt; So, they left under pressure from the hate machine, and left at peak dysfunction.
---
I know I didn't stop playing because of "pressure from the hate machine". I defended the game right up until the moment I realised I wasn't enjoying playing it. I stopped trying to pretend the games fundamental issues weren't such a big deal.
---
For me at least, the "peak dysfunction" is still very much there. Most of the reasons I stopped playing are still there. I come back to this sub regularly to see how the game is going and the progress it's making, but so far nothing has made me want to come back to the game.
---
uhhhhhhhhhhh lol
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and today has been a bad one
---
Couldn‚Äôt you tell from every other Fallout game that EVERYONE should be using power armor at all times no matter what?
---
What I said akin to saying I‚Äôm glad an arsonist is in prison, but I‚Äôm not glad an innocent person isn‚Äôt in prison. It isn‚Äôt hypocritical, it‚Äôs justice. 
---
Y‚Äôall assholes are messed up in the head and can only get your lols by fucking with other people. Go back to fortnite. 
---
Try to find the Overseer, I tried to find a trace of her and came to three areas she could have been taken. If you get bored with that you can check out places like lucky hole mine or tanagra town. One of my favorite things to do was offer people caps or ammo to be sacrificed to the monster in luckyhole.

---
I'm not misunderstanding anything. You literally just repeated my earlier point to me after I made a different point. They're two different situations and contexts. I don't know how you can keep insisting you think you're telling me something new. Stop talking to me until you're smart enough to have a conversation.
---
If any one wants anymore I also have around 200 that you can have. 
---
I'm in it mostly for the nostalgia factor. It was my first Fallout game, and one of the first "modern" games I had played from the 360/PS3 generation. Had a Wii before that, and stuff like Fallout 3 made my brain explode with the knowledge that games could look like that.
---
New Vegas is by and far my favorite, but I'll take whichever remake they're willing to put out.
---
Dude this is so awesome. Great job!
---
I‚Äôve had the issue but eventually they will sometimes generate. Now and then they don‚Äôt at all.
---
Getting into power armour can help. 
---
22-24 hours
---
was no where near power armor 
---
Just wait for the pvp servers. I will get a high wanted fast travel to the most isolated spawns points and wait at the spawn point, one shot. Rinse, repeat.  It will be fun;) 
---
lol the suicide prevention bot messaged me because of this
---
Those Survival achievements are awful.
---
Multiplayer achievements in general are terrible.
---
Sure, the ones that are as simple as "kill players" or "reach a specific level" are OKAY, but the bulk of others are terrible and most players that get them will just boost for them.
---
And a major problem with Multiplayer achievements, is what happens when no one else is playing the game? Or the servers have shut down? At least Fallout 76 has the capability to be run locally, if they choose to allow it, but people would be locked out of those achievements.
---
While I was clearing my inventory I sold one of my explosive Gatlings to a bot vendor today by accident. Luckily I realized it and bought it back before I logged off, the price was like 10x the caps I sold it for lol. A good price to pay to learn a lesson. 
---
Thanks. Hypothetically 
---
Im not sure. Some of mine are sharung how many caps they have.  I sell to one go to another and they have the same amount i left the last one with.
---
Great! Then I would imagine you didn't read it all in one sitting. 
---
Video games aren't real life.  Someone shooting your wall in a game isn't the same as an arsonist in real life.  Learn how to have fun.
---
I don't know but I have a similar question:
---
War. What is it good for? 
---
Former high levels were banned. ;)
---
&gt; does his opinion alone speak louder than those who have been constantly saying what he is now saying?
---
His reputation is for quality without hate. He has never once jumped on the FO76 hate bandwagon. His video is a comprehensive coverage of the problems with FO76, without resorting to hate and just trashing the game. Sure he's not stating much new for the people who regularly browse the sub, but his video will have broader appeal than that.
---
was it a good tone or a scared tone ? happy to have friends or wanting Mum to slap you outta there ?
---
The bot knows the answer...
---
That's right. But reading Shogun is more comparable to playing the game. 
---
Watching this video about the game and this person's feelings about the game is more like reading reviews and critique of Shogun. 
---
While I spent quite some time reading Shogun, I can guarantee you I spent very little time reading critique of Shogun.  While I was curious what other people thought of it, I was more interested in Reading another book then in spending all of my time reading about how it could have been better or not.

Stash your junk and die a couple times. It brings down your dads a bit each time

You have been blessed. Praise be to M√∂thman, br√∏ther

What your talking about is exactly why even nonPVPers loved the TSE weapons before the nerf.  Even if you sucked at PVP you had a chance at revenge. Now, not so much.
---
Your only option is to die, or quit and join another session.  
---
No console, so tcl is out of the question.
---
Do... do you understand analogies? Or is messing with people trying to have fun the only thing you can comprehend? Losing a few dozen mats in a game isn‚Äôt the same as prison in real life life either, yet they‚Äôre both justice. 
---
Go back to fortnite so you can be with your fellow pre-teens. 
---
TurdFergusonn
---
20 hours after you first sell them something when they‚Äôre at 200 caps
---
Invite someone to your team and ask them to kill said NPC's
---
yeah but i have to hope they want to join team, fast travel, and know to kill the npcs
---
damn
---
Been there. Done that. It sucks. Sorry for your luck 
---
No I am not english first.  Just fight them back to make it fun, I don't know why you dont know have fun?
---
That sucks, 12 hours would seem like a better option IMO.  
---
20 hours is a bit of time that‚Äôs for sure especially when you can clock 6-8 hours in a day. 
---
I know melee does significantly more damage, but range still has range - and there are ways to slow/cripple/hinder other players.  Doesn‚Äôt make it completely even out, but there‚Äôs more being considered for balance than just pvp
---
It says your offline My GT Is DevilPcats if you need to invite me
---
2 hours long video, time to start developing another game.
---
Absolutely nothin!
---
But I believe that once the new content drops you'll be able to place them in your C.A.M.P.
---
Stay out of water if you can help it.
---
Dilute what Radaway you DO have at a chemistry station. Unless you're constantly almost at full RADs you shouldn't need full strength ones anyway.
---
Do the responder questline, then firebreathers, somewhere along you should get recipe to dilute radaways, recipe for healing salves etc.
---
similar thing happened to me. make sure that right after you launch a nuke or something else like that to go to recent players and add a bunch of people in the server, so you can join off them if your game does crash
---
It‚Äôs in those shopping cart turrets outside Westek and also outside the church in Harpers Ferry. At first I too thought it was some players. They are pretty powerful but relatively easy to take out too. 
---
Rivet City here I come!
---
So... you enter a conversation about a video that's a critique when you're not interested in critiques and make snarky remarks critiquing  the content that you won't view because you haven't decided it's important enough to watch but then spend a half-hour bleating about it instead of playing Fortnite. Got it!
---
just destroy the base, ez 
---
This whole sub thread is about the reason to not have a camp like that there.  If a camp pulls and kills a mob, no one gets xp or loot from it, owner included.
---
You should definitely add FEV if you know The Fallout lore. Just saying.
---
There are 7 different types of vendors 
---
1.responders
---
2raiders.
---
3. Whitespring
---
4.enclave
---
5.watoga
---
6.vender Bott Phoenix 
---
7.harpers ferry
---
So if you sell at each you can get 1400 caps per day
---
You may consider getting the Lead Belly perk in Endurance to tide you over until you don‚Äôt need it. 
---
Do they not have analogies in whatever your first language is? 
---
It isn‚Äôt fun losing many more caps than the other person, nor is it fun to have to spend mats on mindless trolls‚Äô destruction, nor is it fun to have to hop servers to get away from them. Pvp just generally isn‚Äôt fun in this game, and it‚Äôs not why I play it. 
---
Besides, your post was basically ‚Äúhey fucking with people is fun! Since I‚Äôm having fun I‚Äôm sure they have fun being fucked with too!‚Äù Yeah - no. 
---
If you add me, I can get you
---
Talking for all items not just legends üòé
---
Then don't play? It's part of the game friend.
---
I got mine from WS, SBQ event and AWOL. It appears they nerfed AWOL after the latest patch. Did a bunch lately, after defeating waves and waves of gutsy‚Äôs I always got a wood leg, valued at below 30 caps. So no more awol for me any more. 
---
Your perception of their design philosophy is clearly biased. It's entirely based on how you feel the game should play, on your design philosophy. You may have points this sub largely agrees with, but this sub is a small sliver of the player base.
---
For instance, I can paint an entirely different perception of that design philosophy based on my player behavior. 
---
* Must keep the grind. I've got multiple characters, with multiple play styles, with a decent chunk of hours invested. I have yet to explore every where, get burned out on my RP backgrounds, finished improving and fine tuning my various camp builds etc. I read things, I listen to things, I take in the passive story telling of locations. I spend a decent chunk of time just taking it in. All while other players are burning in and out of quest locations as fast as they can. I valued the experience over the quest to just get the best shit. This may not apply if you've logged hundreds of hours, but even then, that's not really BGS' fault. Enough time spent playing/doing anything will eventually see you hit a content wall. As far as can't put out content fast enough? The fact that they had to do some major work on this game and are still going to release additional content, for free, in pretty much the same time frame post launch as paid DLC for other titles? That's not too shabby. 
---
* Durability or for me "What players WANT isn't always what's best" You want more durability? You want cheaper repairs? Some things have had their repair costs reduced post patches, some haven't. Not to mention, with my meandering play style and camp building I don't have this issue of having to grind for repair mats. I just find them as I explore and immerse myself. With the exception of Ballistic Fibre, I rarely have less than triple digits of the most common repair mats.
---
* Stash Limit. See above. This isn't a design philosophy issue, it's a you just want your way issue. Many people have zero issues with stash management, myself included. It's kind of part of most games that have a survival element. 
---
* Nerfs and their reasoning. Or "You're just wrong on this one". Nerfs are not because people "use a perk too much". If a perk undermines other systems within the game, or create a only optimal build choice it may require a nerf. If something is so good, that it's a bad choice NOT to use it, it likely needs a nerf. If a perk makes an entire system like weapon/armour repair a non issue for you, it likely needs a nerf. That nerf wasn't about a system being broken, it was about a perk basically removing that system entirely. 
---
Your perception of their design philosophy is nothing more than game systems you don't like, and have absolutely fuck all to do with design philosophy. 
---
The snallygaster was a prewar design. 
---
Cuz this sub is pretty much dead
---
What went wrong? They let a game studio who never fully made a game develope it.
---
I found him while I was minding my business ages from flatwoods in the hills lol that was unexpected, I do have a screenshot but my pc is out of commission 
---
As much as I don't like Bethesda marketing, I'm hoping the game will improve for you guys. Hope the Devs take note from this video 
---
&gt;I believe this is the case because pre-patch i was chuncking her with my melee for about 5-10% damage per swing and killing her in under 5 minutes.
---
You do remember pre-patch 6 we had radworm bug boosting pretty much anything.
---
Is Bethesda even still supporting the game anymore? I thought everybody stopped playing this game and moved on lol
---
As long as it's optional I wouldn't care if games has a text chat given that it doesnt effect the game at all on any way shape or form. If it would mean lesser performance or leaving something out just so you can have those features then no they should not be put in. 
---
To actually having this as a law is pretty fucked up honestly, it's like having a law that all stairs no matter where or how long needs to be compatible with wheelchairs only less important. 
---
And I'm not sure how this effects other countries where this isn't a law and I'm sure there are very easy ways of getting around it if they really want.
---
What are you PC specs and have you run any tests to see if your ram is throwing out errors?
---
I've been thinking about his video, having watched most of it, and the only change I would make is to have hard core and soft core servers. I only have 5-10 hours per week to game, and I game to relax. Hard core survival isn't appealing to me. 
---
Having the soft core league, maybe similar to POE, with 95% of the hard core league mechanics - no thirst or hunger or major death penalties (for the first 40ish levels) makes sense. Hard core would be that if you die, your character is moved to soft core league; but hard core provides additional XP, legendaries, loot, and quarterly challenges, etc. 
---
FO76 with MATN's changes and two leagues sounds interesting to me, and I would probably play it. A weird lukewarm version of the game just isn't appealing at all.
---
I've invested over 500 hours in New Vegas, FO3, and FO4 combined. I like the fallout world and lore. Unfortunately, FO76 just falls too short to be worthwhile picking up. 
---
Yes. Just yes üòÅüëå
---
I tell you, those vendors are sharks with their resale prices.
---
*shakes fist*
---
I found him while I was minding my business ages from flatwoods in the hills but near a cliff in the woods so it could be a consistent location? was unexpected, I do have a screenshot but my pc is out of commission
---
Just did it earlier, yeah a stick was faulty and now with it removed seems to be running fine. 
---
You can get the plans from Phoenix, in watoga.
---
Lol!
---
I had a turret target my campfire today. Had to store and put back out. Fixed it. 
---
Fast travel to camp if not near enemies
---
Yay! I love your positivity! That DLC does sound Wicked! I hope we get new weapon and armor mods or paints churr! 
---
That or BGS makes some kind of perk fusion system to get crazy perk cards.
---
I got attacked by mothman twice when I was a really early level and I haven't seen him since
---
Yeah I mean have you run any actual tests like memtest86. Try changing the slots the ram is in as well might have just been a bad connection.
---
Haha I shot mine, then repaired it. I‚Äôll try this next time
---
They literally just released a patch and a roadmap
---
Yep I sometimes take a grape mentat which improves the rate a little bit, but still it feels like being robbed every time lol. 
---
Didn't reas the whole post before commenting. *Facepalm*
---
Dont worry about casually using radaway or chems. Grind hard to make it to lvl 50 while **wisely choosing which perk cards for a build.**
---
Try to join events and discover map waypoints.
---
Hazmat suits are easier to come by these days. Maybe ask a higher lvl for one while youre playing.
---
Yikes lol
---
Totally, it‚Äôs basically a bug that you can get attacked while loading into the game.
---
Nah im pretty sure the stick is messed up. I did just the windows memory test, and before i removed the stick there was an issue with the ram, after there wasnt
---
You are the guys who brought up level. Level might equate to experience but it doesn‚Äôt reflect skill ;).
---
That‚Äôs the thing dude, I do everything you offer in this fucking post for free for people everyday, by my god damn self, for zero caps. 
---
Who‚Äôs fuckin flexing now chief?
---
Really? Didn't realize it reduced rads! Thanks
---
Thanks. White Springs area.
---
That's nice, simple and yet fancy, I could see myself building similiar.
---
Sounds good thanks
---
I hope your right, that would be cool. 
---
Watched the whole thing and at 2:29:00 and on he makes a really quick summary of his top tips to improve the game. Essentially to change(eliminate) the misinformed rng from the game, reward exploration, promote character specialization to incentivize player interaction, make the game more challenging and to make the game have more permanence and to have a feel of real consequence for your actions. Oh and also to make the cooking system good lol.
---
Assholes... assholes never change.   Yeah I‚Äôve been a victim of there sick next level griefing a few times ... typically I log out bc I don‚Äôt have time to shuffle deck and get ready for pvp when I‚Äôm crafting stuff in my base.... it‚Äôs just easier that way. Fix my base and go about my business lol 
---
Blind gamers?
---
A neutral tone, he didn't know what to make of it. But after i gave him a lv 5 legendary i found he was ecstatic over the mic.
---
No, terrible idea. 
---
White Springs is just an area like any other. It's just the community that has decided it's the best place to nuke and farm mobs of enemies.
---
I think it's a terrible idea to propose limiting everyone purely on the basis of satisfying a player made meta.
---
Yep I'm using that one. It's the stupid charred ghouls 
---
Oof like I don‚Äôt have the 2 steal to fix it. 
---
You fast travelled to and/or died during Scorched Earth. This can also happen when fast traveling to a friend in a nuke zone anywhere.
---
So, pretty much what ManyaTrueNerd laid out?
---
For real. I was so disappointed when Todd said they weren‚Äôt doing anything like that though last year... can‚Äôt tell y‚Äôall how many times I‚Äôve dusted off the PS3 just to replay Fallout 3 again and again. Would love a remake. Have there been any new rumors about it lately?
---
Ikr its true for me with the new friends i got when starting to play fo76
---
I never found the plans, it was always quicker for me to scrap the armor. Eventually I learned how to add the mod to my existing armor.
---
If I remember true they want to make game special about meeting someone and playing game like singleplayer It will be better If it is optional and It wont be problem 
---
You'll notice that few gaming publications have picked up on this. That's because the law only applies to "service providers" using a definition that would be a stretch to apply to Bethesda in this case. Even if it did, the law applies to all disabilities, not just deaf vs. blindness. **In other words, if the law applied to Bethesda/Fallout 76 then they've already failed it by only having Voice Chat without Text Chat.**
---
Hard out !! Thanksüòâ‚ò¢Ô∏ènew armor would be cool az
---
True, other option is leave world and relog, but toy loser any workshops
---
Strange, last time I tested it, it seemed just 2-3 mininukes and they fired about as how I expect. Seemed to do less damage than without so I removed the MIRV, plus it's a lot easier to aim as normal fatman.
---
Just claiming is a good way to get plans. Just drop junk before you do. 
---
You have 9 charisma or 9 points in the charisma special?  Gear and buffs ect dont count you have to have that many points in the category not that value as your result after modifiers. If you have 9 points in charisma then it's some kind of glitch but my guess is you have 8 and something that adds 1 to your cha
---
Unfortunately, neither of those happened. I had arrived just outside the blast zone before the nuke landed, and never went down
---
Ok thank you anyway 
---
You use the word bias, but it's just my opinion friend. I'm not influenced by anything other than my views, so I'm not sure where bias comes into this.
---
On the last bullet, this is a quote from the Devs when they nerfed pipe weapon Perks. Brought up in the video this thread is about. 
---
Otherwise, many of your points fall into the "helicopter developer" design philosophy I'm criticizing. So... we agree with the devs' mindset? No need to get so defensive with the last bit there.
---
Thing is I understand where you are coming from.  But there is a large population in this game this is more casual and less skilled/devoted to the meta of the game.  Sub-optimal builds, etc.  These people want xp too.  And while I would never advocate that anyone has to help them, I'm not against them cheesing things a bit if that is their strategy to get some xp that otherwise they would not be able to get (i.e. trying to farm inside the clubhouse and getting clobbered and dying over and over).  Yes the argument could be made "so let them farm elsewhere" but then I could say for the people wanting more exclusive access to the clubhouse "well, just server hop or go farm elsewhere".  
---
The camps are not innately a problem.  Working with others is.  I have no problem when I'm in there whacking away at ghouls and a lvl 20 player has a camp with 2 mg's picking at the ghouls to aggro stuff.  He/she is running in getting tags and running out to the safety of their base to finish them off.  I am still killing the ghouls with mostly 1 hit and just follow them out if need be.
---
Yeah someone could have a platform with missile turrets or 1000 mg's, and you know what?  if that annoys you (or me), we go out there and smash the crap out of the turrets if we want to.  There is nothing wrong with this.  But it's not being to because "I HATE ALL TURRET BASES", it's done to fix the annoyance at the moment.
---
In the end the game boils down to competition over resources.  We either get along or we compete.  Both are fine.  I just don't get the inherent hate for a type or style of play, just because.
---
Yeah I think that maybe can't be founded due to a bug
---
Well, there you go. Go try it again to see if you can recreate it if you want.
---
Otherwise, the three methods I posted can result in this.
---
Each generation kids swear even younger than before, i remember no one swearing when i was in middle school, now when i set foot in a middle school cafeteria i can't hear one sentence not involving a swear word. 
---
Yeah why not add a night vision option too, like a scope
---
I‚Äôve been carrying some on me the entire game because they‚Äôre weightless (just in case) lol
---
Touche
---
Still hearing stuff that's a you problem. Do you not watch a documentary just because someone else isn't into it? You're both not going to enjoy all the same things. Doesn't mean you avoid them.
---
Here's my point... Alot of work went into this. There's plenty of things you could legitimately criticize but "Oh, the subject matter doesn't justify the length" is not one of them. It makes you sound like one of those people who thinks video games are one the "lesser" forms of media. And that's annoying.
---
I scrapped no less than 100 legs tonight and didn‚Äôt get a single mod.  Seems kind Deep Pocket is the only one I don‚Äôt have and it won‚Äôt hit.  
---
Probably won't happen considering obsidian is making other games now
---
Don't be unprofessional, keep out of the attacks, and you might make an impact with your voice.
---
Oh stop it with that "filthy casual" shit. You sound just as dumb as the people who accuse anyone who likes the later Fallout's of being "casuals."
---
Again, Jon's video was a direct response to another (highly viewed) video. You don't share the opinion of that person? Well great. Neither does Jon. So shut up.
---
Thanks.  I saw it this morning, downloaded it, but ran out of time to set up the perk load outs.    I've got v1.9 installed until I get a chance to copy my loadouts over to nukesdragons site.  Then I have the new one ready to overwrite it once I have the ini file setup properly.
---
Well good stuff I guess, problem solved. Make sure you check the warranty on it most ram has lifetime warranty.
---
Dunno why you're being downvoted.  What you said is true, and we could all use more variety.
---
And Bethesda, we don't want oh so badly for you to nerf the crap out of WS because it is overperforming.  We want other places to be brought in-line with higher xp / spawn density.  Maybe at least 1 such xp farming hub in each zone (it would be a great boon for new players to have something like this in the forest region).

You can google the list of all tapes I think there are 19 holotapes for her mission
---
You can place war into your camp? Sounds destructive! 
---
I would if it wasnt fairly old ddr3 stuff ive been meaning to replace anyway, and i knew where i put the box. Thanks anyway though.
---
And nary a golfer amoung 'em.  
---
\*sighs at 4 of 10 quest still unfufilled\*
---
Think it's 17 tapes and there's a list in Challenges.

I‚Äôve been camping on the fairway behind pro shop for a month straight and the only time I‚Äôve seen him was very early in game doing Ella Ames quests. 
---
We had a stalking mothman attack us last night. He stayed for the fight though. It's weird that he just sits there and lets you shoot him. When he died he did so in a poof of ashes and just left a pool of glowing red. Maybe it was his eyes. üòï Anyway, he did give us a bunch of loot. 
---
Some business with an Amazon listing by Bethesda that came and went and featured the "Please stand by" countdown thing.
---
Should be able to find a bunch of articles on Google.
---
I've been using this mod for over a month now without any issues whatsoever.
---
What you on ?
---
I had my TSE break during the SBQ fight  and it still let me fire it. I was wondering what was causing that. 
---
Hey buddy. I get your mad, but, console updating is far, far different than PC updating. With the console, they have to replace entire chunks of big files to update. 
---
Xbox
---
Weird, it could be a bug. Have you scrapped other pieces? Like arms, and chest/torso? 
---
Actually, correction or just clarification of something I didn't describe as well as I should have:   The signature itself would be invalidated / broken if the mod was tampered with.  So the MD5 might not even be necessary at all, though it wouldn't hurt to have a second verification of integrity in case someone figured out how to spoof Bethesda's signature.  They won't be able to spoof a signature AND match the same MD5 of the signed file.

Building on whitespring is a symptom. The disease is that whitespring is the only place to nuke.

This is something weird I've come across and it sounds counter intuitive. However those turrets can actually be very useful though. Those turrets can cause the ghouls to respond much faster than just trying to shoot them by manually. So if you go out there and get your one shot on as many as you can, they will pretty much non stop respawn. 
---
That's...actually pretty neat.
---
No wonder its a glitch!

You mean garbage with fancy names?
---
Holy schnikes... just googled it. Ohh, please let it be true. 
---
It's been requested numerous times.  I think I have a thread about it, if I recall correctly.   The basic point is that if the player is not able to move, then mobs shouldn't be able to damage the player.  Once the player can move, then the action can take place.   The idea of the mobs not being able to see the character loading in is a good one, but at the VERY least make it so that the player can't take any damage (from any source) until they are fully loaded.
---
This!! Soo much this!! I hate taking a workshop and then getting cut from the server when I fast travel to lose it. It would be great to be able to rejoin that server after investing in setting up the defenses.
---
I would just like more pistols tbh the 10mm sucks and I don't want to use pipe pistols at level 53, black powder and single actions reloads are ridiculous and I assume that Tommy whispers 9mm is in the game but I havent found it? That's only three semi auto pistols and I'd be happy nodding/using the 10mm if it wasn't so useless, it would be cool to see more useful pistols and sun machine guns to make the pistol and guerilla perks useful. 
---
I have not played 76 in about a month now. I was one of the people that pre ordered, paid full price without seeing the game. I keep wanting to get back into the game, been playing FO4 a lot. Just have not logged back in to the game yet. They still have some fixing to do on the game. The storage system sucks. You should be able to make some storage boxes in your camp That you can store stuff in that can only be gotten to while in camp, and then have the stash boxes that you can store weapons or ammo in that can be accessed when at other camps or rail stations.
---
Have a friend stand on it or in the area.
---
If you don't use power armor find a piece of armor that has rad resist or mod a piece or two to have rad resist. Even a tiny bit greatly reduces the amount of radiation you receive.
---
On my way!
---
I love doing that with me 2H thank. Now if only I could hit waves of feral ghouls in a swath with power attack instead of just one.
---
So I'm seeing both Xbox and PC but no PS4 comments yet. That's very useful to know. Thank you for the info everyone. Will report this to the team.
---
Where are you
---
You have take the good with the bad. Doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt recognize the bad for what it is. 
---
Huh so someone's already said it? I knew I was far from first but I searched and couldn't find it lmao
---
I think you should specify the Golf Club itself.   I have  camp that is built outside of the walls of Whitesprings.  I don't want Bethesda to go too far with this and somehow prevent me from building far out of the way from what you are talking about.  I agree with you:  No one should be able to build right next to the spawn point for all those ghouls at the Club...nor anything similar to that.    Or if they build there, you shouldn't become wanted for destroy their camp.  
---
You won't need the box, I mean I would rma it just to get some new free ram even I was going to buy some new stuff but that's just me I guess haha.

The exception expired December 31st, 2019.
---
&gt; The videogames industry has had various waivers for the law, but the last expired on Dec. 31, 2018. As a result, as of Jan. 1 of this year, any games that enter development must be fully compliant; games already in development before that date but released after it ‚Äúmust be as compliant as possible,‚Äù though how far into development the game was by Dec. 31, 2018, can be considered; and any games released before this date that receive ‚Äúsubstantial updates‚Äù after it have to abide by the CVAA.  
---
Its arguable that Fallout 76 is still in development, AND there is this little gem.
---
&gt; Meanwhile, games released before Dec. 31 that receive substantial updates after that date must also be compliant.
---
So here is hoping that we'll see it in the summer update.
---
Thanks.  So if I fins Fort Defiance, Free States, McClintock and Site Bravo... I‚Äôll have 18.  Aren‚Äôt there only 17 (per the related challenge)?
---
why no Adrenaline?
---
I actually edited this post earlier specifying that, it's up there! No worries
---
I imagine this being prevented by adding a check that if you've taken a step or clicked a button (menu etc) the buff is deactivated, even if within the 'loading' state. 
---
Oh yeah, I remember Lone getting a Bethesda job
---
Yes what?  I should have 17 or 18?
---
Same thing happened to me and a buddy. We were trying to farm hardened masses, very unhappy.
---
You would convince more people if you didn't go overboard with your language
---
Amen to this.
---
17 with the nuke launch holotape 16 without
---
So the problem is that your girlfriend will watch a movie but not a video essay on Fallout 76?
---
... Maybe you just need a better girlfriend.
---
Either no building on the spawn point of one of the most popular xp farming areas OR make a small "hazard zones" where building is discouraged, but if someone builds inside of a hazard zone, then destroying their base doesn't bring on Wanted status.   Maybe even make it so that you have to be more than 10% in the exclusion zone for the effect to count. Just touching the border of it shouldn't trigger the hazard zone effect.
---
But it definitely needs to be focuses to small exclusion areas like just outisde the back door of the golf club.   Building further away should not be limited.  
---
Ah yes and the laser one too. Try watoga, I have seen them at vendors
---
Try the Garrihan mining building enemy downstairs sometimes legendary 
---
I've been able to fix it by having the invisible player fast travel away, like to Vault 76; then I fast travel to my camp. Then we both simultaneously fast travel to their camp.
---
I haven‚Äôt.  I‚Äôll try that tomorrow.  Was looking to add deep pockets to a Right Leg so that‚Äôs what I was crafting/scrapping.  But I guess the mod doesn‚Äôt care what Limb it is.  
---
With the vast number of fridges in the wasteland, I think there would be some working ones... even if the ones we could have for our camps only held a limited amount...  100lbs for example.   
---
&gt; a lot of people with real lives don't have time to watch a 2-hour video
---
I'm glad I'm one of those people with fake lives, then!
---
Only time I destroyed someone camp is because he changed the doorway to a wall when I was inside, all I had to do was pull out a shotgun and destroy everything inside while he panicked lol 
---
I realized it too late.  I deleted my erroneous comment and added something a little more inline with the updated post.  I'm not sure why my brain just shutoff about half way through the post.  I should probably go to bed instead of surfing the web.   ;)
---
Hunt him down.  You'll feel better.  There's bounty hunter groups and people who trade security for caps.  Try them out too.
---
Destroying someone's base is more effort and more detrimental in the long run than just switching server lol 
---
Lol you're fine bud, get some rest!
---
It's probably a reference to Avatar the Last Airbender.
---
That was perfect! üò≤
---
Your comment was a bit too long, didn't read.
---
ugh it's not part of the main series. if youre going to hate on something hate on fo4 for its terrible writing and rng bs lol
---
From the maps I've seen online it seems that WS is located in the Forest zone.  And the spawns seem to change depending on if a lower level or higher level player walks through.
---
What good about maps? I have a ton but when I did a couple I just got some crap. 
---
I'm past 40 and i never swear. My dad was doing it all the time. Mom was not.
---
Makes sense to me.  You'd understand a weapon or a piece of armor better the more you repair it and how to improve it.   Armor's "learn rates" are soooo extremely low.  It takes a LONG time to learn mods for armor, Bethesda.  Could you PLEASE address this?   (Either make it so you can also learn mods from repairing or at a very minimum increase the learn rate of mods for armor and some weapons that seem to be incredibly hard to learn.)
---
I have the 14 listed above (including Nuke Launch).  If I add (4) more (Fort Defiance, Free States, McClintock and Site Bravo) that will be 18.  
---
It be nice if making it had chances to give plans like in the middle  of making a Gauss rifle your character  thinks hmm "I wonder if could put a silencer on this"
---
Lol what
---
Anyone with even a passing understanding of the state of 76 knows there‚Äôs *way* more than two hours‚Äô worth of critique you could throw at it.
---
Co-sign 100% of this video. I want to play Fallout, not a "Fallout Inventory Management Simulator." FO76 is poorly-designed from an incentive perspective and unplayable for me, no matter now many new features they threaten to add.
---
There are lots of people who are legally blind who play video games. 
---
This is usually because their impairment is limited but they still need accessibility features to do certain tasks. I have a family member who has a limited field of vision but still sees well enough to play some games. VATS helps with targeting and there are other games with other mods/features that let them use auto-aim or auto-target. 
---
I had a friend who used a screen magnifier to game and a big screen tv for his console. It was pretty fun playing at his house. 
---
Thanks friend
---
My personal favorites are his Kill Everything runs. Man, so funny. I also really enjoy his Don‚Äôt Kill Anything spin-off, good alternative when I was done with KE. He‚Äôs really fucking funny.
---
Had my entire base destroyed and the repair cost was ridiculous so I just made a bunker out of foundations and the only exposed part are the mothman statues on top
---

I agree they should hire him, but incompetent people tend not to want to hire competent people for fear of having their incompetence exposed.
---
I think multiplayer achievements are fine in multiplayer focused games or modes. Bethesda have been putting emphasis on pvp for this mode and it seems that this is really all this mode will offer (which is fine) other than enemies being harder and you needing more food, water, resources, etc.
---
In regards to 'acceptable' multiplayer achievements I personally think that they should be challenging not grindy.  I have done a lot of multiplayer grinds in my time  and to use your example when I unlocked the Seriously... achievement in gears of war 1 I didn't feel like I accomplished anything that great. I just felt glad that it was over and all it said to other people was that I had played the game a lot but when I think back to halo 3 free for all and   
---
halo reach I remember how awesome it felt to unlock some of those. 
---
Whether people boost or not is up to them but I don't think achievements should be made with boosters in mind. As for servers shutting down and achievements becoming discontinued, there are already thousands of achievements like that. This game already has achievements that would be impossible in the event of a shutdown... what would a few more matter. 
---
I think in a perfect world multiplayer achievements should have single player alternatives like the mass effect andromeda achievements for example or they could change achievements once the server go down but not change the description for people who originally unlocked them.
---
Aww here it goes!
---
I had this happen once.  I don't know what caused it.  I had to do the same thing to fix it.  Store and re-place.
---
I have a keyboard plugged into my Xbox. I also prefer text chat, but that's because it's damn near impossible to find in game voice chatters. It seems like in voice game chat is dead now. 
---
This is all great ideas.  I agree that people should build where the game lets them, and deal with the consequences that might possibly follow.  There is nothing good/bad about any of this, it's just the game.
---
Lowbie WS type area would be really great for the game.  It would be super duper pooper scooper if there was a place to consistently grind low level legendary gear.
---
to have pvp over resource gathering nodes.
---
something you seem to have found out the hard way.
---
Yeah they just released a massive video including that idea today.
---
Same here. I hadnt played in a long time and after loading the server I spawned in the middle of the golf club as a level 21 surrounded by those level 60 creatures, I tried to run but died
---
I think they know about the issue, but don't know how to fix it correctly. 
---
Welcome to r/fo76.
---
Holy horrendously formatted post, Batman!  Horizontal scrolling is the worst kind of trolling!
---
Now that you have the plans instead of the mod...you can charge people who want to have those shocks installed...lol
---
Ive never had to do this. (xb1)
---
There was enough content to keep folks coming back for over three months despite a flawed platform.    There‚Äôs not a content issue.  There‚Äôs an engine issue.  
---
I didn't say that everyone with real lives can't do this, but that a lot of people with real lives can't do this. There is a difference you understand yes?
---
Regardless, it is good for you that you have time for this and that you enjoy it. I'm not saying otherwise
---
cheif what do you expect when people pay for a lot of money for a broken unfinished piece of shit
---
God yeah I've noticed that even scrapping low tier armor like leather doesn't do much, it's not even worth creating more just to scrap. Maybe even crafting them could give a chance since you're literally crafting it from the ground up.
---
I just really don't like the idea of scrapping a ton of rare weapons to possibly not even get the mods. I just really wish there was more variety to it and it's not just monotonous.
---
You can farm fusion cores at power plant workshops.
---
Spend even more caps to hire people to do something I can prevent by switching servers and blocking? Nah. Mindlessly engage in pvp where I‚Äôm doomed by the rules of pvp to lose more caps? Nah. 
---
I‚Äôve done a good amount of pvp with these people, especially when I was with a group and one of our camps pretty much always got destroyed every time we played. They all stopped playing between this and the lack of anything to really accomplish end-game, so the bright side is I have to deal with all of you less often now. 
---
But yeah, I get my jollies by building bases and workshops, stocking up on ammo for when they finally release new content, and helping people in various ways. Really not into pvp in this game, though I am in some others. 
---
OP is tight with MATN 
---
Bethesda want to keep the PvPers interested by providing them with tasty snacks. That's it.

I played WoW from alpha until about 4 months ago. This launch was immeasurably worse.

Lol no and I shouldn't even gave to explain the 16 downvotes are enough 
---
I can confirm you only need the VPN for the activation. I just used a free VPN browser extension for Chrome, activated on Beth's website and uninstalled the extension immediately after. That was a few months ago now and I can still play the game without issue.
---
Improve stability? I dunno, maybe not release a game until it's actual finished and more polished. And not just release it because of the holiday season, releasing a pile of junk that only serves as a coaster
---
Right, you presented a problem, I'm offering a solution.  I'm not saying you have to take my advice.  Indeed, play how you want, but it doesn't make you a saint, getting rid of all the "baddies" if you wreck the camps.
---
Clearly my sixteen downvotes are not enough. Eagerly awaiting the next sixteen as /F76 endgame content.  
---
What do you mean horizontal scrolling?
---
Your defensiveness here is telling. I didn't say video games are lesser form of media. I spend a lot of time in video games. I spend significantly less time watching commentary on video games. Personally, and I realize this is a personal preference, I prefer the commentary be concise so that I can access it because I would rather be playing video games than listening to people talk about video games.
---
One of my primary points is the same that it has been all along, which people are choosing not to see. That is simply that it is a shame that  with the video being as long as it is, not nearly as many people will hear his ideas as if it was a more accessible length. That is not saying that I believe that he should dumb down his video or his content.
---
There are a lot of comments throughout this thread from people asking for a summary because they don't have time to watch it. Being in that category myself I noticed this, and commented on it. People are taking offense for no reason. I was not judging, I was merely making an observation.
---
I hope they‚Äôve built around punishing the most loyal player as you‚Äôve described above 
---
Well too late to do that so might as well just go with this
---
It's always funny to see/hear happen, when a group of enemies go in all bad ass, guns a blazin', and two shots from my exploding shotgun into the bunch and they're all limping and the legendary is like "well, it was fun, LATER" *runs off*
---
Literally just happened to me. Heard the ‚Äúrun away‚Äù part and was like ‚Äú!!!! A legendary!!!!‚Äù Lol
---
My best friend and I often team up as a duo and she disappears a lot. The first time it happened we had split up in VTU to ransack the place and when we decided to meet up we chased each other around for twenty minutes before we realised we were both invisible...we figured it out when she asked if I was in front of a particular door and if I could see her close it. I don't think it has happened to me since (that was a handful of patches ago) but she still goes invisible from time to time and has to load back in
---
He‚Äôs trynna sell you some milk of human kindness dude!
---
what platform are you on?
---
So many bugs are still out there.   Weapon issues, missing plans, fast travel issues etc.    Then also changing things with no mention.   I love the game but don‚Äôt understand how so many of these bugs are untouched through so many pushes/updates.  
---
I'm kind of, finally, a little, maybe, enjoying the game..  It's still ridiculous how much junk collects and then I don't have the heart to drop it, because I sure as hell know i need that f'ing spring and aluminum to repair my damn weapons/armor
---
Sorry, but you're making no sense. You said no one hates Fallout 3, then denied that you said no one hates Fallout 3, then you talked about "Fallout 3 haters". And you also seem to have arcade games and computer games confused. Hopefully when you grow up in a few years and become a teenager you'll learn how to articulate your thoughts properly and eventually be able to have actual conversations with people who have different opinions than you by the time you're an adult.
---
I'm literally going through that problem. Aluminum, steel, adhesive. I need it
---
Does anyone know where/how to get the paddle ball mods?
---
And the game will get better. And we have the free DLCs to look forward to also
---
It's just a video game, you dont get to go live there...  go start a new character and try to be a good boy going forward. 
---
All fights in fallout are "just shoot it until it's dead"

Honesty it‚Äôs not a location you want, it‚Äôs missions.  Horde missions and uranium fever.
---
This has nothing to do with FO76, and everything to do with how the PS4 handles updates.  
---
When you download an update file for a game, to install that update you need enough space to copy the entire game file + updates because the PS4 makes a backup copy while the update is being applied.  
---
Every single PS4 game works this way.  
---
Improve your posts man. Wtf is going on here?
---
Yes, fairly often. I had that happen with a legendary glowing deathclaw in whitespring. It ran around the entire resort and never attacked. It would sprint away and hide over and over. It's funny to watch a huge deathclaw hiding behind a little tree as if it's a good hiding place.
---
that's what I'm hoping for, they might as well give out free peanuts n drinks on the train(wreck)
---
I like this idea, one purified water to clean a handful of cans. That or a frugal recycler perk card that will let you receive junk from consumables.
---
Everything at this point is speculation, until they release details there's no point in assuming anything about the system. For all we know we might get more bonuses for being a higher level when we rebirth. 
---
I have 3500 steel and I can't even sell the damn stuff to vendors, but they sure as hell can sell it to me.. 
---
Jon's video says that rad storms should appear more commonly in the Toxic Valley with, once again, a surgical monster like a rad deathclaw and that you as the player have to watch the weather to see if you're going to get caught in a rad storm which means taking radiation damage and a potential encounter with a dangerous enemy.
---
Happened to me too.  Got killed by invisible super mutants during my load and again at respawn.  I rage quit 5 minutes into playing and decided it was a good night for a different game. 
---
You'd think they (bethesda) would just "up" the aggression and AI of an enemy instead of nerfing all of our hard earned guns (but nope, we get the cowardly deathclaw)
---
Wasn't  that the project Brazil mod?  Sides think I prefer  that to what Bethesda would make
---
Tbh, you get nothing for leveling up so high. you get some perk cards, that's it. You lose more caps if you lose in pvp if your level is too high. If you can level down your character, that in itself is a benefit before any rewards you might get for prestiging
---
I expect to have to help guide both the ears of developers and the mouths of consumers as best I can.
---
Agreed but with that my clout of being level 163 and the intimidation to the new players is gone :(
---
What new features does it have?
---
No you won‚Äôt stop lying to us you stole our money and ran just face it 
---
What's up with these horizontal scrolls with your post? I'm on pc. and I get this weird extra text box
---
This is the exact opposite of a problem this... this is amazing!
---
What are the attributes on that 3* rolling pin?
---
I don't know. I can't see it. That's so damn weird.
---
Griefers would think otherwise. Griefing a higher level characters guarantee more rewards
---
The mod bought at a vendor  will only cover one leg if you are lucky enough to find it.  And if you find one, you are likely to find it for the other- at least not for a very long time. IMO if you want them for both legs, then the plans are still the way to go.   I have only seen them once in many hours of playing with two different characters. 
---
Mine is all out in the open too. On the east side of the golf course on the rocky ledge. Out of the way so hardly any baddies ever find it and then it's usually radrats. Ghouls can't get me..neener neener neener...
---
I‚Äôm talking about level 1-15 characters their reactions to me with a monster mask and an axe is hilarious 
---
No! Give it away for free;)
---
It only happens with 0 star legendadies, their drops are never that good anyways. 
---
Maybe it's ok when viewed on mobile? Idk what I can tell is it's a pain in the arse to read your post on pc
---
That sucks, I don't know why I did that
---
Like saying coal mines are good for the economy because they give environmental reclamation specialists jobs. 
---
I mean, sure - but they really do fuck up the environment in the meantime and the reclamation specialists are rarely sufficiently effective. 
---
I‚Äôm just saying maybe we should bypass all that and go solar. 
---
That just happened to me today. Finally broke down and bought the BOS initiate paint for my T60, and the next tech data I turn in, bam, there it is. Lol
---
So YOU are the griefer! lol
---
this

üòÇ nah I usually just drop purified water

Hope we don't get hundreds of 'I scrapped my main weapon! funk you betheda fix this piece of shiet game!' posts
---
Yeah! We have a guy at the center who I work at who has a deteriorating disease that causes vision loss. Right now he can still play games as long as the screen is big and he stands close. He love super Mario bros. But yeah he‚Äôs legally blind. One day he‚Äôll be fully blind but for now he needs accessibility 
---
I saw a health bar of one but it Vanished before I could take a look at it.
---
No. 
---
Literally minutes ago I saw a lvl 176 or so in excavator armor with a machine gun base behind the gold course.  170+!!  Plinking away with a shotgun, not hitting more than half of the ghouls by the looks of it.
---
You can‚Äôt tell me he‚Äôs not being a selfish, shitty person by wasting perfectly good xp/loot that others can‚Äôt get because his camp is constantly pulling them away from their spawn points.
---
Indeed, and there's also a mod that pretty much adds this already, which means that they could pretty much just copy the code and perhaps modify the text appearance a bit and that would pretty much be it. Also something like a global text chat channel would be nice as well imho, could be really useful for trades. 
---
Of course, they could simply add an option to enable or disable it in case you want to go for that Singleplayer feel. 
---
Oh yep, thats it. Just accidently got that a week or so ago.
---
Definitely. Hope they delete it.  Not supply drops. The stupid rule or whatever the proper word is 
---
I like to be corrected so i can learn how to say things properly.
---
I‚Äôve been using this mod since *launch*, no issues. 
---
Well, I‚Äôve been using it since FO76 launch, so far no issues. 
---
Fuck-fuck-fuckit
---
I watched Jon's video and agreed with 95%+ of what he said. What he didn't go on to say and what does need addressing, if we are to go with his ideas, is "why do I need to go outside my town?".
---
I completely agree that the game needs permenance, that we need to rebuild and that the biome's need to be more radical, but in all that, there had to be a reason to make players have to go and explore.
---
If we take the biome's, make it so a raw material can only be found there, so if you need the material you have to venture deep into the biome, given how dangerous the area is this will require team planning, meaning that going there isn't an everyday thing and that the reward in how much material collected has to be substantial and rewarding.
---
So, say the rad storms in theToxic Valley becomes a source of flux and the game is offering new weapon or armour plans which require flux. Going into the storm to get the flux, battle the monsters in the storm to collect the flux to take back to town requires planning.
---
There's a reward in the challenge, the loot and the reward for the new weapon or armour.
---
I highly doubt that text chat would impact performance in any noticeable way (It's just a few bits, even if you keep spamming on it), it's more due to the fact that people generally want to communicate without mic most of the time, and there isn't an option to do that on PC yet (Except the actions I guess, but I don't think I need to explain how limited that system is). 
---
If you are on pc, I can put on dense for you both. 
---
What's even more :( ?

[How she died](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/24/archives/cass-daley-comedienne-dies-noted-for-raucous-sight-gags.html)
---
"Mute player" and a 5-10 second time between messages should more than likely be enough for most situations.
---
It's his privacy setting. He has it set so that only friends can send him messages.  
---
I'm not 100% sure this is true but I feel that the reason people have encountered him so often is by design. I think once you enter a location that triggers him to spawn as stalking mothman, he will generally disappear pretty quick so you can't really kill him unless you're OP or he glitches out. Once encountered that first time he is guaranteed to spawn a random number of times, say 1-4 before he appears as vengeful mothman and engages you long enough to make a kill. This is just a theory but it lines up with my and my friends experiences, he has always appeared as stalking 3-4 times teleporting away almost instantly then come back as vengeful who always sticks around til I kill it even when it takes a long time (first time he ambushed me when I had next to no ammo and was also being pursued by a bunch of mutants).
---
One place that I know he spawns is right near my CAMP. In Whitesprings, it is on the green across from the path that goes up between the golf club and the pool, it is the one that slopes downwards with a sand bunker¬†about halfway with a safe sticking out of it. At the bottom of this green there is another sand bunker and this is where he spawns.¬†Mothman has appeared there a handful of times for me,¬†I¬†have¬†also¬†seen the Flatwoods Monster there twice.
---
I imagine bugs getting abused regardless. See duping for further example. Checks can be worked around.
---
20?  I thought they were usually 40+
---
Running around I only carry Around 20 Diluted stimpacks 10 diluted rad x and 10 diluted radaway. If I‚Äôm going to do something where I need more then that then I‚Äôll go to my stash. Same with every other chems. I only keep about 5 each in my stash for emergencies.
---
I sell them all, except for a handful of Radaway and Stimpaks. To prevent radiation damage, I use a hazmat suit. 
---
Has anyone ever told you that you structure sentences exactly like Donald Trump? I don't mean that as an insult nor a compliment. It's just an observation. It's fascinating and uncanny.
---
¬´Path dependency¬ª?
---
I thought you could buy a paddle baller (plan) from the Camden park with tokens that uses them as ammo?
---
My GPU/monitor supports braille 
---
I came across a stalking one an hour or so ago. Once I noticed him, I hid behind a tree and snapped a picture. My dumb butt decided to get a bit closer and then he suddenly faces me and I go caution. Next thing I know he‚Äôs right freaking beside me. I will admit it scared the heckity outta me cause I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to appear beside me. My caution never went to danger lol
---
If you don't like the idea, by the time it actually rolls around, you could generate a level 50 to fuck with the new system. 
---
"its' not fair" fucking nonsense. It's a new feature, you can use it or not. 
---
0 stimpak 0 superstimpak 0 radaway 20 rad x  50 healing salve (forest) 190-200 chems.
---
and I am level 78 can someone tell me how the hell I am gonna find radaway
---
Good for you like I said you came to this post to flex and your trying to get people to not buy are services so just get out
---
Whats actually neat is other non-marked legendaries do this for me, it's just a normal, non-legendary mob, but that behavior always ties with a legendary item drop, even if it's not \*'ed. 
---
Shit man you better hope the whitesprings campers don‚Äôt show up and blow your shit up. A lot of them are in this sub and they‚Äôve personally destroyed my camp at whitesprings to the point I moved it elsewhere. 
---
I‚Äôm only saying this because you‚Äôre house is dope and it looks like it took a bit of time to finish.
---
haha cute
---
Found the plans in a Mire treasure map today.
---
Because Rad-X interferes with my mutations I no longer use that at all. But I do carry around 30 Radaway for nuked zones, this usually gets me through the zone and back to my Decon
---
Shower. I usually have around 40 Stimpaks to heal up between Healing Factor kicking in. And usually around 30 Purified Water, which gets me back to camp to restock from my purifiers. I sell all other chems. 
---
I‚Äôm not here bashing the system im just trying to get more info on this as the description in the road map can only be described as ‚Äúminimal‚Äù I‚Äôm just hoping they keep my plans learned and my items/camp intact when I prestige maybe different tier medals for profile or something? One for 50 then 100 the 150 then 200 etc... I really just don‚Äôt want to learn I wasted like 500 hours of my life to have it all gone and earn the same reward as someone who spend 100 
---
If you are playing on pc and want to give this sweat melee legendary to someone I am here 
---
Happened to me with a 3* fire axe. Just poof, gone.
---
Once again I do not understand.  The coal mines in fallout are no longer functional, so they do not add to the economy.  You can get a wind or fusion generator but no solar.  Hope this helps.
---
Really? Because I‚Äôm sure they had something like this since the beta
---
hah, when everyone started playing when it first came out, that was showing up every other level
---
Are you relying on Herd Mentality and/or Strange in Numbers to make it to 9?
---
It is a known issue that more often than not these will not allow you to share or will allow you to only to 'drop' the shared card a second later.
---
In my experience gear (armor/underarmor etc) that gives you +CHR is fine - using that right now, so is the Unyielding effect, the Magnetic Personality perk and chems that boost your CHR like day tripper work just fine.
---
I generally don't go beyond +6 CHR ever so a boost somewhere is necessary.
---
What radroach is y‚Äôall gonna fight for it to need 1200 stims üòÇ
---
You might want to go have a conversation with every vendor in the game...
---
So maybe clear it up for me.  Specifically what are you saying you are, or maybe what are you saying period?
---
I'm currently hunting this plan too. My friend has it but she doesn't even know how she got it (I'm pretty sure she picked it up when a friendly high level player came and dropped us a bunch of plans and she took them all before I got a look lol, bitch) I encountered Grahm twice and he didn't have it but unlike most vendors he doesn't seem to always have the same stuff (I'm also after a gun I'm told he sells but he didn't have it when I last saw him). I don't think any vendors have it or someone would have posted about it by now, the only vendors I havent checked are Camden park, Whitespring bunker, Morgantown airport and PV ski resort.
---
This is misinformation.
---
You most definitely *do not* have to allocate the points of CHR in SPECIAL, gear, perks and chems will take you where you need to be just fine.
---
Tbf I still think that the only modern (As in, from Fallout 3 onwards) Fallout game that has that is New Vegas, even Fallout 4 felt really linear in most situations (Really, the only way to have a bit of variation at the ending is joining the Institute, and even that isn't something that makes you feel "evil" like many options did in NV). 
---
&gt; What he didn't go on to say and what does need addressing, if we are to go with his ideas, is "why do I need to go outside my town?"
---
If a player just wants to stay in the town and act like an NPC shop keeper or something, I don't see any reason not to let them. Let people have fun their own way.
---
Usually I leave it alone. For a while. I'll wait and see if they come back, and if they don't, then they don't. I had one guy today who came to take back the workshop I had just claimed and I killed him 3 times in a row. I left his stuff and had no plans to take it until he decided to keep trying to kill me, so I took his stuff and left 2 each of rotten food. 
---
This exact same thing happened to me today. Wandering around with a 10 caps bounty, in constant fear to get killed, especially when Iam farming lead, plastic or steel. But I have to admit tho, it was kinda thrilling. Killed two attackers and still got the bounty. But you‚Äôre right, there should be no popup it this is a supply drop from another player! 
---
The ghouls or the loot?  Ghouls gave me a nice [harpoon gun](https://imgur.com/2pimKKL) and [50 cal](https://imgur.com/8HtK8lG).  I love seeing glowing ghouls.
---
It's so silly to have an online game without text chat.
---
Not to be mean or anything, but it honestly wouldn't change much even if he wasn't deaf just for the fact that people don't speak in voice chat 99% of times anyway, even if you attempt to start a conversation. 
---
&gt; TIL How to decrypt the nuke codes haha
---
It's funny to me how Bethesda went from the Railroad in Fallout 4 having the password R-A-I-L-R-O-A-D to this complex nerdy cypher puzzle that no one understands unless they've done them before outside of the game.
---
we can all use big boy words lol its the internet not congress
---
Definitely not suited for me yet! I was doing the Mistress of Mysteries quests and I needed a sword, and it‚Äôs in one of the outbuildings there. I‚Äôd been there about four times previously and died already
---
Maybe 1/100 drops are worth keeping. Typically they are useless garbage that you can't scrap.  It's funny to see paper bags littered all over the place with usually 2-3 "legendary" items. Don't get me  wrong, I got a nice 2 shot Tesla rifle and a quad combat shotgun, but it's frustrating getting maybe 1 good "prize" in 4-5 hours of gameplay. I spend at least half my time at Whitespring usually.
---
That 50 cal makes me moist...
---
I've never felt the urge to check out "Discord" servers.  What are they for?
---
Doesn't just happen when you fast travel, if your with a team member and you go in a building with a load screen sometimes you or your friend become invisible too
---
5 rad x, 5 rad away, epic assload of stimpacks because healing factors 300% health regen only works outside of combat and lowers the amount that stimpacks heal.
---
FYI...to avoid PvP, leave the drop alone if you see a ‚Äústeal‚Äù action instead of ‚Äútake‚Äù
---
tyvm kind sir :)
---
Plain old disagree
---
With Bethesda talking about separate servers for "Adventure" and PvP, it seems like an excellent opportunity to add a Survival server to the mix. 
---
It has always been like this.
---
The Scorched are their own faction and they are not 'allied' with any other faction therefore everything is hostile to them, including non-scorched members of the same species.
---
You can speak or trade with other people much more easily with Discord, that's why many use it for Fallout 76. 
---
Nope, it doesn‚Äôt help that you‚Äôre an asshole who‚Äôs making the game shittier for other people. Then having the gall to claim they enjoy your sadism. 
---
Go back to fortnite. 
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware, NOBODY has any info yet.
---
So the weekly challenge "Kill A Huge Creature" is bugged for me. I just killed two Grafton Monsters in a row and nothing. I'm on PC.
---
Wait you can get BoS plans by breaking down? Like Reinforced or Polymer? Damn. Does this work breaking down regular Combat Armor or does it have to be Heavy? Any level restrictions? (either the armor level or the character level?)
---
Yes that is true but i was killing the Queen easily before the rad worm bug. I also never took advantage of the rad worm bug during Queen fights since there is usually no Ghouls there to give you it. 
---
Honestly that's my feeling about all this as well. It's not like people are going to protest much about it, and even if they do they could just add an option to disable text chat. 
---
This is the in-game version of a Black Friday sale. Maybe you should join that class action lawsuit ü§£
---
Yeah, SolarDragon was there when Jon completed the game
---
Short version.  The game has too many conflicting ideas.  
---
It's trying to be multiplayer, but also single player friendly. It's trying to be a wasteland survival game, but they didn't want to make it too hard. They tell us to rebuild America, but don't let us build within 100 yards of each other or established structures. The Fallout series has forever told us that nukes are bad and very serious, but this game launches them gleefully with little to no consequence. 
---
Trying to blend all of these conflicting ideas has just produced a garbled mess, and every aspect is weaker for the compromise. 
---
Ah I see, player trades.  Thank you.
---
Some weird things were happening. When i repaired my weapons and armor with fix it good or weapon artisan, it never applied to the things i repaired then shortly after they spontaneously combusted. Was so weird. 
---
Today??? Guess we're a hivemind because I was starting to doubt my own idea and was wondering if I watched their video sometime in the past, guess that is not the case.
---
Yeah, we don't have that on PC since you can't contact people from the Bethesda Launcher at all (For whatever reason) and the game also doesn't have an internal message system, which pretty much means that you either have to use voice chat or use the Small Letters Set and take ages to write the simplest things. 
---
What do you need the rubber for? Just out of curiosity 
---
Just fast travel
---
Glad you liked them! 
---
If you play on the ps4 platform i'd gladly attempt a SBQueen run with you if you need the extra assistance. I know a thing or two about the event you could say :) 
---
Well, they don't do it. All they do is take the place and that's it.
---
Allegheny = Fort Defiance
---
Next patch, and no one knows when that will be exactly.
---
Whatever solves this, could likely solve my falling from the second story of my not yet loaded CAMP and breaking my leg every time I log on.
---
You probably sold it. Happens to me when selling multiple weapons and the server lags. The animation will show you clinking on ordinary weapon, but you are in fact clicking the next on the list due to the lag. Almost lost a **TS hunting rifle this way a few days ago. (Sorry if my English is not good enough to explain it better)
---
I did crits/cats/pistol for a while. It doesn't work in the late game.
---
Currently I do pistol+rifle build with pipe rifles (they get benefits from both) and can solo one-shot lots of things.
---
If they don't kill you outright and you're downed, send out the "haaaalp" emote.  I always drop what I'm doing and come running if I see it.  I may not make it in time, but I will stand over your loot bag so no one can steal from it and happily provide a bodyguard service if I see you're trying to get into a dangerous area to access a vendor or as part of a quest.  If I'm in Whitesprings, I'm usually just farming legendaries and xp, so it's no sweat to help someone else out with more important goals.  More ghouls will be there tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that.  Helping out a stranger and showing unsolicited kindness can only happen that one time.
---
I think most 76 players (at least on PC) are happy to help others.  Don't be afraid to ask a lvl 150 if they can clear enemies for you because you want to progress your order of mysteries questline.  They're still getting good xp and chances at interesting legendary gear, so you're not putting them out very much.  If anything, your new presence will respawn mobs with a chance at legendary loot for people like me that are hunting for specific pieces of gear.
---
I killed moth man yesterday and was really bummed by the absence of decent loot. 
---
That‚Äôll teach me.
---
Me too! They just gave us an extra 200 pounds of stash space, and I have no idea what to use it for!
---
The probleme is not that players are building turrets in white spring, it is 1 of the 2 or 3 rewarding spot in the game. If players could get rewards everywhere when a zone is nuked (example), this is a way to fix this. Preventing from building in whitespring just because it became a grinding and easy ground is not the way to go.
---
If the forest become the "new" grinding and easy ground (example), players will build their C.A.M.P. and leave whitespring, I am sure.
---
Think about what the problem is and what cause the problem. Don't fix the problem, fix what cause the problem and you will fix the problem in the way.
---
PS: English is not my first language and i hope i made myself understandable.
---
Come on man he clearly asked for a lmgtfy link
---
jk. Probably just a bug! But sometimes I see enemies (eg. scorchbeasts) that have white font instead of red and they don't actively attack me. I've never seen a scorched like that, but maybe that's possible?
---
Yes make sure someone is still hanging around. I have no idea if meat piles will disappear if nobody is around. 
---
I killed him yesterday. The juice wasn‚Äôt worth the squeeze. Don‚Äôt feel bad.
---
Yeah, that's clearly the case, but that's information the quest should _give you ahead of time_. 
---
well there is the "western revolver"
---
Genuinely no offense meant but this is not advice I‚Äôd give to a level 8. I don‚Äôt think they could get to Watoga alone, and the fast travel caps would be intense
---
Buncha soy boys
---
Or at the least properly frame it as a "you will enter PVP with this choice" like, raider lifestyle's a thing, griefers love it, I get it, but I don't roll that way. 
---
I'll steal from the robots, but I don't _want_ to steal some guys drop. 
---
You can find players selling mutations for about 250-500 camps each
---
I mentioned that one. I presume it's too late for civil war but perfect for cowboys.
---
I mean, if  you feel like your "wasting" your life, and if you think it's "Unfair" that other players with less time will suddenly have a even playing field, maybe...don't use the system, if that's how it works out. 
---
It should have been here from the start, so people at north of 50 levels won't be at a time sinc "disadvantage" if you discount the caps, legendaries, materials. 
---
I just have no sympathy for your "it's not faaair" argument. So much of this game is unbalanced. 
---
Oh shit, they do exist? For real?
---
Man, I hope they do add junk lunchboxes to the game world so we can craft them and all that lootbox-style lunchbox stuff was just something that was canned early on.
---
Eh.
---
I hopped on today for the first time since early January and really didn't feel like anything had changed, save for server stability. 
---
I'm still burning ammo while plinking away at bullet sponge enemies, my thirst meter is dropping like I'm in the Sahara, and enemies are just always spawning at levels way, way ahead of my own. Guns also just seem to be a hassle to use now; why waste forty bullets and burn my fusion core in VATS when I can just hit them twice with my super sledge? 
---
I think there are some core gameplay mechanics that need some real tweaking. 
---
&gt; In a perfect world she will quickly ignore you and find a new target and fly away to find something she can attack.
---
You mean in a well-designed game? :(
---
Get ownt 
---
Calling someone a fool is reasonable. Saying "you're completely full of shit...you're talking out your ass" is absurd. Grow up
---
Some of those ghouls deal tons of radiation damage
---
(The commenter works for Bethesda üëÄ)
---
Do you just take another serum to fix?
---
I've come across the targeting hud a few times and the red lamp, the shocks took me hours and hours of hopping to get but it's possible
---
Most of them are just to have someone to play with. Teaming up with randoms is difficult, due to the lack of communication. I wanted to play more with other people, so i posted on reddit, and  someone invited me to their discord server. They gave me tips, we quest together, organize queen battles, build and help each other out with materials / serums.
---
If you actually like the multiplayer aspect of the game, you should try out a few discord servers. It made the game so much more entertaining for me. 
---
I play on Xbox one and on friday the queen stopped taking damage shortly after she mutated about 15 minutes into the fight., Then she flew to the radio tower west of Watago when a player quit and traveled to his base near there. When she came back with 1 minute remaining she was full health and flew in slow motion. She stayed in the bog after the event and continued to fly around during the next scorched earth event.
---
Saturday, I decide to stop using my power armor/bloodied super sledge and go after a win using Unyeilding armor/bloodied deathclaw gauntlet.   Ive helped kill her every time since, which has been around 8 times, in 5 to 15 minutes in groups of 4 to 14 people.
---
Unfortunately no, it has to be removed first. I had to replace 6 total when rebuilding (note that I have heard reports of marsupial being bugged as well for this or a previous patch)
---
The nuclear keycard cargo boxes also say "steal" and don't flag you for PvP just as an FYI.
---
I don't get why people think melee is good. You can't run faster than a bullet. 
---
 
---
 Sure it's the easiest way to play in that you aren't required to aim, so it obviously takes the least amount of skill.  (Go ahead and try to come up with a build that takes less skill) 
---
How could you not be bored to tears playing it unless you just simply can't play anything else effectively?
---
I share your frustration, for sure.  It's like playing a slot machine, hoping for three cherries and it almost never happens.  However, when it does the elation is pretty intoxicating.  I do have to say that my point of view may be a bit skewed, because I used to play largely solo, then by chance happened to participate in a Uranium Fever event about a month ago with a really funny, sarcastic girl in the mix, asked her if I could add her to friends afterwards because she made me laugh, and we've been grouping up together almost daily ever since.  I brought in a couple of my casual acquaintances to the party, she introduced me to her small circle of friends, and I hardly ever play without a full 4 person party anymore.  (I'd honestly like them to expand party size to 6 or 8 because sometimes we have to chat through discord between two maxed out parties on the weekends)  It makes a MASSIVE difference when doing a whitesprings run and everyone is sharing hits and desirable loot.  We usually all dump our unwanted legendaries in the golf club icebox, take what looks interesting to us, and leave the rest for someone else to stumble upon.
---
If I'm by myself or running with only 1-2 other people and come across a weapon or armor piece that I know a friend is looking for, or might like I save it.  With friends in mind, the spectrum of what is "valuable" in my eyes expands exponentially, and not just for legendaries.  I'm always looking out for a dense combat torso mod for one friend, extra claw mods for a deathclaw gauntlet for another, harpoon gun flechettes for myself, rare X-01 mods at the bunker for another guy and an AA/explosive lever gun for someone else.  My "grail" list of weapons and armor is pretty broad between 7-9 people that I play with regularly, let alone myself.
---
Is there a place where you can get fire extinguishers en mass?
---
I watched half of it before I fell asleep yesterday and it was great, will be finishing tonight. 
---
p.s using things like grape mentats would of shaved of like 800 caps and hard bargin lvl 3. though 7500 is only achivable if u have 1 charisma.fully perked thoose plans goes for 5250 or 5350 in vendor
---
I stopped playing a while back too, might jump back in tonight! I got frustrated trying to launch the quest nuke solo. 
---
Good work!!  Another awsome tale for the campfire :-)
---
all deep pocket are from plans. used to be rather common of the vendors nowdays i think it may only be treasure maps.
---
I've actually heard of that one, and I tried it a few times. Worked pretty well, though I encountered light resistance. Any suggestions on which place to travel into so that I can go right to the house and circumvent any scorched/supers? Also, is server hopping viable for this one? I'm drawing nearer to the conclusion that the game has built in protocol to prevent server hopping for resources within a given time frame. Am I wrong on that?
---
&gt; Its called a game, i wish people would just play it.
---
Did you ever consider that people who don't want their stuff broken just because you're bored are "just playing the game"? The world doesn't revolve around you, dude. That's the wind blowing.
---
Plans based mods can never be learned by scraping
---
or wear a whole bunch of unyielding armor and have 20 charisma
---
Sure! but I don‚Äôt use my mic since I mostly play solo if that‚Äôs all good? 
---
The revolvers for the most part are okay. Their form and function are nearly identical to period pieces, with the exception of using brass, rather than paper cartridges. 
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure when the first pistol caliber brass cartridges were made, but I think it was definitely during the decade of the civil war. So I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it that much. It‚Äôs only a discrepancy of a few years anyway. 
---
However, brass cartridge rounds in rifle calibers did exist and were in use during the American Civil war. So for the most part, any lever-action or break-action rifle is fine unless you are an absolute stickler for exact accuracy.
---
No, you just need to learn to aim it right for the MIRV.  They are intended to split apart and fall down to ground.  Shoot the projectile up high above the target, it will explode in the air above and rain down.    if you shoot toward the target, it will explode much sooner and catch you in radius.
---
Found the kiwis! Hello there! *waves*
---
Fridges are a frequent request. I thunk itll be simpler and better to simply make advanced food recipes spoilage free. This will also create a food trading economy, simplify and create value in advamced food recipes without adding more buffs
---
Deaf players are screwed in that area.
---
I'm writing a series of ten articles on the economy of fallout 76. How it relates to different people gaming the same games differently, how to accumulate wealth in a simulated economy, the best source of income and wealth, how to make that wealth feasible, convenient, consistent, and safe (low danger encounters or no encounters). It goes into what wealth means for this kind of world now, and moving forward. Also, one of my favorite articles so far is the one I'm working on involving different methods of accumulating caps. Anyways, I need the rubber as part of my marine combat helmet series. I need 30 a day, supplemented with around 70 taters per day to get a mandatory minimum of 1000 caps a day purely by economic means. They use 3 rubber each; the other components are much easier to get, and I usually just buy them in bulk because profit margins are negligible. But buying 10 rubber for 75 when 9 rubber nets me 75 isn't worth it. So I need a quick and easy method to get 90 rubber a day so I can make my helmets, and get my caps! 
---
Please, move you camp away from Whitespring, friendly advice....
---
That's totally fair, unfortunately I'm mainly looking for quick encounters, ideally low risk, or no encounters to obtain my resources. 
---
Brilliant! Thank you so much.
---
Came here to say exactly this :) 
---
I don't even bother with a door on mine, just a staircase. I want my place to be useful to any random traveler who needs a workbench/stash/bed. So far, even though I camp directly across from the train station by top of the world no one griefs me (thus far) and I see people using the place quite a bit.

Note to self never trade in a PvP area. Seriously THANK YOU! I would have never thought of this
---
There are two at fort defiance one labeled defiance one labeled Allegheny. One before you join brother hood and one for after.
---
 Just doesn't feel worth it to fight her now.  No adrenal reaction and a good chance she becomes invincible.  Takes triple the amount of ultracite bullets now, which I have to gather flowers for.  
---
I've killed sbq well over fifty times by now and got one serum recipe and nothing else of note. 
---
&gt;Unless you removed something important, you literally could not cut down this video any shorter if you tried.
---
you could to make it quicker and still retain all the same messages, but you'd lose too much quality (talking about the small 0.5 sec 'cinematic' bits like the screenshot of fallout new vegas in the start).
---
still, a lot of the things he says are connected in clusters and blocks, so i think you could summarize it by making a bulletin post (perhaps with some under-categories), but yeah, it would only really be a summary (or reference, i guess).
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you had to go outside of your town, if your want to run a shop that's fine. However, the game can't be changed the suit those who want to stay in the town. There have to be something that gets players to want to go out of their towns and explore.
---
There had to be risk and reward for all players.
---
Lol remember when a mostly single player fan base specifically asked for PVP?   Oh. . . Wait.
---
&gt; a lot of the things he says are connected in clusters and blocks
---
Personally, I'd arrange them as cogs.
---
I get what you're trying to say lol. With voice chat you at least have that option of communicating if you want to though, right? Being deaf he doesn't really have that option beyond the poor emote system in the game. 
---
I think if people are worried about toxicity or spam in a global/public chat a nice middle ground might be just basic party chat or the ability to whisper your friends. Maybe it's not needed but I think it'd be nice lol!
---
I've noticed that a plasma pistol spawns near Rose sometimes. It could be just me.
---
Whatever happened to nuance?
---
I highly doubt that any devs in their right mind would have wanted to release the game when it was because it clearly wasn't ready; I blame the higher ups for that dumb decision, and the devs had to bear the brunt of the backlash.
---
Look at all the other shit that happened outside the game that reeked of higher up arrogance, then put 2 &amp; 2 together.
---
I witnessed a scorched mutant hound fighting super mutants.  One of the super mutant yelled run away.
---
This should be a feature.  
---
Kudos for Keretus, wouldn't play anymore if that mod wasn't around &lt;3  
---
I'm not quitting until after I kill that damn assaultron boss in sugar grove.
---
"she" keeps killing me then greeting my lifeless body.
---
Any hints guys. ?
---
I'd like a New Vegas remake.
---
Are you mad because someone uses grammar correctly? Man, you're a sad little person.
---
Totes.
---
This explains the weaponised autism exhibited by some of my fellow vault dwellers kind enough to follow me around trying to initiate PVP.
---
1 on 1 yes, 3 on 1 all over lvl 150 against lvl 56. That‚Äôs just wrong mate and u know it.
---
It *should* be totally viable. Haven't tested on f76 but I did a couple of characters that way in f4, pistols consumes way less action points in V.A.T.S than rifles, so you hit more often, having more chance to trigger (grim ripper &amp; four leaf clover are must have) and the damage output is decent.
---
Thank you for letting me know, but see my edit for what the real problem was. I do still plan to switch to NVIDEA when the time comes, though.
---
Charleston station because sellers can prevent the vendor bot spawning there, then charge outrageous prices for the hunters longcoat and clean spacesuit.
---
I had a critical computer failure, so I haven't had time to look; how much is it again?  I can't log in right now, after fixing that disaster I have to get some rest.
---
I really wish the Perfect Storm to be like the Maliwan Hellfire where the incendiary effects all stack instead of re-proccing.  It‚Äôd be incredibly viable even late game if that were the case.
---
Hey, anyone who needs help with assignments can reach out Asap. 
---
Suscribe to a Shadow PC, got mine sinc the release of the game because my laptop wasn't powerful enough. It never failed me and specs are always evolving and getting better.
---
Fallout 4 new vegas is a real thing.
---
I usually try to just stock up on  RadAway and Stimpaks. I sell the rest. I just tough it out through radiation and use radaway if needed. If you can stock up on Rad X and never use it, you can get some decent caps back from vendors.
---
SBQ, AWOL Armaments, West Tek, and Whitespring in that order imho for 2-3 star legendaries imo.
---
The other way around if you want multiple 1-2 star legendary gear.
---
i used the Daisycutter to fight people with TSE (before nerf) like a kamikaze. Let's see who will respawn more!
---
i know. but i dont want spend my caps becuase others fail. btw even with 500cp i have to replace 6mutations what is 3000caps, two days income.
---
I‚Äôve had dead feral ghouls moonwalk into the horizon after they‚Äôve been killed in the last week or so.
---
I think the semi-permanence of events like Powering Up are a good way to add in community benefits without the possibility of closed-off and hard to join communities. 
---
I‚Äôm a solo player, and occasionally play with my brother and a friend, none of us are fond of playing with people we don‚Äôt know and definitely don‚Äôt want to build a community or have to join a clan or something similar to enjoy the game. 
---
That‚Äôs why I think the events that have temporary region-based benefits are good. You can go power up the plant and help out workshops in the region (when it works properly).  I rarely come across a server where all the power plant events have been completed. 
---
Adding in a Back on Track mission that repairs a region‚Äôs railroads to lower travel costs or a Safe Haven mission that creates a safe house/safe zone/hub for a region to allow more trading or respite from the dangers of the world would be nice additions. 
---
I would love things like villages/towns/cities but like you said it‚Äôs a tough balance to add that type of community building to a survival game. 
---
I saw that once at whitesprings, except it was glitching into its twin walking towards the sky.
---
I love stuff like this. Helping other players really feels good. And when a player helps you, it makes the last 3 grievers seem like not that big a deal. Even if he did steal like 40 plastic.... xD 
---
For plastic, just farm solo. Go to schools, better than dealing with scums.
---
Game rules working as Bethesda intended.  Sorry, only yourself to blame if your not prepared for the wild wastelands.
---
You don't need VATS to initiate PvP. 
---
Why would you do PVE in survival server? Just hop to adventure server and do that in there And with assassin set, you are going to have dodgy too. So in PVE situation your Weightless set is provide same stats, same dodgy as it would in Assassin set.
---
If you have both Assassin and Dodgy, when your Avoidance fails, then the DR doesn't, but in Weightless if your Avoidance fails, you don't have DR.
---
&gt; is 32% of assassin worth being invisible as soon as you stop running/sprinting rather than only when you crouch 
---
Ofc it is. If you consider not taking 32% DR, because you don't remember to crouch, you are already in disadvantage that you can't make up. Fine, take the weightless, but remember when you do you are against people who do same as you weightless, but they also have 32% DR.
---
The funny thing is all these gaming sites that jumped on this story don't even mention that there is a slight possibility that this guy might be full of shit. This game has had a bad start I have to admit, but the witch hunt is real.
---
No text chat for PC, unless we can have one for Xbox. I have a useless keyboard for my wireless controller I bought just for FO76 thinking we would have a text chat system. 
---
So much this.  Maybe something where we don't take damage until we "activate" or something.  Sometimes when I'm at my base I load in in the middle of the air, and fall like 2309423 feet, too. I always quit in power armor, but sometimes that hasn't loaded in while I'm falling. And sometimes I'll fall, rubberband back up to the top, and fall again. Fortunately I've trained myself to deposit my junk before I leave the game lol. 
---
I didn't help myself to anything, even though I saw ballistic fibre in there! I was just grateful for the extra help and felt bad that I couldn't revive him when he was asking.
---
These moments are so small but to think I am sharing them with other people around the world is so cool. All the best bits of Fallout and we can now share the experience, it's brilliant.
---
UJse pharma farmer. It's a luck skill. Mid to endgame areas will have a lot more laying around loose aswell. Complete events or workshop defence for stims on a short notice. Try to dilute them with chemist and/or super duper equipped.
---
Ohio River adventures is stacked with life preservers. Good for 2 rubber a piece, and they also contain springs. I think there are 10 or so of them. Couple fishing rods there too and fiber optics bundle in the boat at the end of the dock. Tis a cool place.
---
Can you be more specific about this fragment: " So I advertised what I needed on the wall of a building at Poseidon energy plant.. " - I'm 169 lvl and never heard of it.
---
My ex brother in law was legally blind, but he could see just enough to play PC and console games. The glasses he has to use make nuka cola bottle glasses seem almost like contact lenses. 
---
It is 9 charisma special, I am not wearing anything that gives a gear boost
---
Nope it is straight 9 charisma in my special stat
---
Too much since the queen spams my inventory with supers and I try to keep normal packs for reviving. Quickheal button uses normal packs first and can't revive with super... Food/chem weight reduction armor luckily makes it so I am not forced to use too many weight cards
---
iirc the 3\* don't run
---
My VATS didn't target any of my team mates while I was doing the Mayor for a Day event last night but it still targeted other non team mates. This is a problem as I often play with more than 4 friends so there is always someone that's not part of our team. 
---
If F1 and F2 were so amazing, why did they bring the franchise nearly to death? A fate that Bethesda saved the franchise from. If F3 is so much worse, why did it save the franchise? Why does it have better sales, better scores, more GotYs than the "amazing" FNV? And don't me the "appeal to larger audience" crap. FNV is as much accessible as F3. And "appeal to larger audience" doesn't in any known universe equal to "garbage". 
---
This all just shows that F3 is much better than F1 and F2 and as good as FNV. It is actually the first game with PROPER Fallout atmosphere. A feat that the fabled FNV threw away and replaced it with cowboy adventure "atmosphere". Really, FNV downgraded as many aspects of F3 as it upgraded. That's the reason it cannot be inherently much better game. If you watched MATN's video about F3, you'd know that it is as good RPG as any other else. It just hides the systems and makes them flow naturally. Usually RPGs are "in your face" with this. It's the "You said/did this? Here's your consequence". While in Bethesda games it flows under your radar. It doesn't feel as if the game has direct consequence until you later discover the consequence and go "huh, that makes sense".

---
It should be done when they announced PvP servers - I've never pvped and not going to, so let anyone play their way.
---
If you are going with the rad res in armor idea keep in mind to check the item stats when it has rad res as legendary. Some rad res  legendary effects actually add nothing to the rad res stat....
---
The is western revolever and even single-action revolver for pistols, while Lever Action for rifles.
---
If you have turrets, I'd recommend scrapping them. Griefers will destroy your camp in a heartbeat and defend it as heroism.
---
I was holding the resource camp at Poseidon. I built a wall. Then used my signs and letters to advertise I was looking to buy plastic. 
---
If you are doing PVP and when you stop moving and stay up like telephone post, then you are already inferior PVPer. As I said earlier, one does not stop moving and stay up, you always go crouch even if you don't have chameleon.  So if you use Weightless to mitigate the thing that you forget to crouch, then to take your PVP onto next level is to use Assassin + Chameleon set.
---
That sounds like it may work! What kind of enemy resistance am I lookin' at with a fast travel into the zone?
---
Both these are under armour. However there is a bomber jacket that is over armour. They can be obtained s a reward for turning in technical data.
---
Yes, tried that yesterday with sneak \*\*\* perk and chameleon on gear - there was just one enemy, I hided behind the building, sneaked, but I was still in Danger, even though I wasn't moving and chameleon made me invisible.
---
Yet bro churr churr lol
---
Was super overencumbered and stumbled upon someones base, Thought oh neat ill store/break down stuff and continue adventuring, Except everything was behind locked doors. SO I said fuck it, blew a hole in the wall, stored my gear, and when leaving made a another new door for myself. Its one of the reasons why I always leave ONE work bench and a storage outside my house.
---
Buy the recipe from the Whitespring Bunker Medical Vendor &amp; collect all the glowing fungus you see &amp; acquire Chemist + Super Duper perks &amp; never worry about RadAway again. 
---
Apparently something affected player stealth visibility a patch or two ago, and now certain  enemies can detect t he player a little easier, and sneaking to escape detection even at a sufficient distance tends to fail.
---
It's still possible mind you, but it has become noticeable harder and more finicky sneaking and escaping since  whatever Bethesda did.
---
They looks the same, only BoS Officer is, in my opinion, nicer - black-silver look.
---
What system do you play on?  I play on PC (if that matters) and people may not have a mic on at the time, but if you say something friendly to them over area chat such as "hey I left a bunch of scrap, ammo and plans in that blue suitcase.  Grab anything you need" they'll get on their mic to say thanks like 50% of the time and almost always give you a thumbs up or heart emote.  Of course there's always some lvl 200+ rando that's in Flatwoods for no good reason and will take every stimpak, radaway, scrap junk and radroach meat I left in the cash register, not say a word and peace out with with his blackbird X-01 suit complete with jetpack and a heavy searing sharp rocket sledge.  I've heard that gamers as a whole aren't the most socially proficient people on the planet.
---
Based on what I've read and various comments, I think the PC community is a bit friendlier than consoles.
---
Almost hourly I hear someone heavy breathing, coughing into their mic, or a TV in the background when their mic isn't set to push to talk.  I have a beard that's somewhere between "wizard" and "biker gang" length, so I can't keep my mic open or everyone would just hear non-stop whiskers brushing against my headset.
---
Higher level players at higher level events, such as Scorched Earth or Line In The Sand tend to be miked up more often than not.  Generally speaking, I tend to just use hello/thumbs up/no emotes when encountering strangers and it usually suffices.  Because of the clunky system that Bethesda chose with their interactive player audio, half the time I'm trying to talk and only with the most recent addition of a more clear mic system do I notice that I'm still in team chat from the day before and switch over to area.  Auto chat is buggy, so I never use it.
---
Thanks! Do you know if any of the shotguns are ok?
---
Pvp = Person vs Person. Not team vs 1 person. That is bully tactics and the way they did it was outright cunning and devious. 1 on 1 yes, 3 on 1 NO!.... or were you a school boy bully as a kid and it now following you in game as well?
---
I'm looking forward to this. MATN is such a great guy. He seems to genuinly enjoy the games he plays. And don't think he could force himself to play a game he doesn't like. It would be apparent from the first sentence that he doesn't enjoy it.
---
Also the same as with his Fallout 3 video, I'm happy that I get a big video essay from MATN, but I'm saddened by the circumstances that led to us actually needing this video. In F3 case it were the droves of mindless FaNVboys that found out that hating on Bethesda online is part of FNV creed. So many lies and misconceptions were floating around that MATN had to set the record straight. But even then those idiots would rather close their eyes and go "nonono, I can complete the cannibal casino like in three different ways. So revolution! Much RPG!" while ignoring every single piece of information from the video.
---
For this video I'm sad that the state of the game is such that it needs this video. Granted, the game is in a good state, but it could be in a much better state still. Also, it's quite a niche game, which means that audience is limited. And in todays era of entitled gamers, it's sadly that for too many of them "game that is not for me == garbage game".
---
Love this! Cool to see this roof glitch, too. Thanks. :)
---
ohhh, that way... I thought it's some kind of mechanic that allow to make ads.
---
It could be that something has gone 'screwy'.
---
This is going to sound like mumbo-jumbo but please indulge me.
---
Take \*all\* your gear off - including exiting PA if you are a PA user, take all your perks off, take an addictol and if you can be arsed go to the fountain in Whitesprings that cures all diseases otherwise take Antibiotics. Yes, even if you cannot see any addictions or diseases in the status page.
---
If you can store all your junk and jump off a cliff or go cuddle a yao-guai - close to a marked location so respawning costs you nothing, I am tight fisted. 
---
If this is not an option FT to Whitesprings and enter the interior cell or to the Service Entrance and enter the Enclave.
---
Log out completely rather than server hop.
---
Once you log in again, without putting any gear on given that you already have 9 CHR allocated try to share the perk card.
---
It's very rare you'll find anything introduced in New Vegas by Obsidian. 
---
Felt weird when playing Fallout Shelter and seeing references to 3 and 4 but nothing from N.V. part of me finds that petty but I guess I don't know the full story.
---
simple workaround suggestion: make mutation serums both remove and reapply said mutation (note that this type of problem seems to happen any time a mutation is updated in a patch)
---
10 stimpacks
---
5 rad-x
---
10 rad away
---
I never really need anything more than that tbh
---
I don't know if Civil War soldiers used shotguns, it's American's history (I live in Poland) ;)
---
So is it conforimed that removing mutantions and reapplying will fix adrenaline reaction?
---
I guess my mission continues!
---
Oof...dark.
---
If they stored turrets when they're off somewhere else and not in WS people would have less of a problem with them. I for one also like to help people power level low level players and make sure everyone gets a hit on Legendary enemies before they get killed. It'd be nice if more people did the same. 
---
But try doing that when turrets a mowing down enemies before you can make sure the level 20 your helping gets a shot in.
---
Yeah I have the bomber jacket. I was just wondering because I saw a list of obtainable outfits and it was on there. But thank you for clearing it up! 
---
No, but if I‚Äôm expecting someone to hand shake someone else on my team, it‚Äôs nice to have a headshot lined up.
---
Vats crits will go through effects like sentinal, a stumble does the same. If the player is not familiar with how this worls he/she will most likely move/flinch making their dmg res effect useless. Stealthboys for vats users. Hold onto covert ops magazines. In power armor reactive plates will slap the hell out of melee low hp builds. Dense/padded mods and fire proof help against tse weapons. The shotguns remain strong but can be played around. No need to max out fireproof and padded in my opinion. Mentats or scan beacons for chameleon players.
---
Definitely! That‚Äôs what I have on now 
---
That is really not a viable option. Either you have to swap screens, or have the xbox app on your phone and put your controller down to respond on your phone. I use this method for trades now. I don't use a headset so I don't have a mic. 
---
the positive effect of adrenal reaction is no longer being display after the patch, only the negative, which is suppressed by applying the serum for 1hr, which is why it appears to disappear. 
---
If all you have is stupid comments, leave the sub and do something more productive with your life. 
---
Ae we sheep i capable of self thought that we have to rely on somebody else to form an opinion? Jesus. I get that he‚Äôs trying to help, and alot of people here like his points but.... really? It‚Äôs so solo-centric in a MULTIPLAYER based title.
---
Has he even thought how these changes would effect the game as opposed to changing HIS sole enjoyment? 
---
The grind, is necessary, the weight and stash limitations are necessary, not just for balancing reasons, but for server and network stability which i think is easily being overlooked ALL the time.
---
If everyone ran around with 300 stims nobody would ever die. If you had an unlimited stash, you could fill up after a day and not need to adventure stock up for weeks, which will crush the playtime said person puts forward to the game.
---
I think too easily people on the Fallout reddit get too wrapped up in what they feel they should have basically due to single player entitlement over the past few years.
---
"No, keep playing." -Bethesda
---
Wheres this on the map?
---
/cosigned  I would like this.
---
I tend to stay up later than my wife on most weeknights, and would prefer not to disturb her if she has to teach at 8 am the next morning (meaning she wakes up before 6 am) and a nuke just dropped on Fissure Prime at 11pm.
---
I would prefer to toggle text chat on and off with some kind of options for local/world/friends/trade chat.  You know that bots and traders would spam this endlessly if it was just one open server chat.
---
This ^.
---
I have been letting my nails go...
---
Me neither, I'm British. I used to live in Poland. Bloody lovely country. I lived in Gliwice for a while, but the job didn't work out so I had to move on.
---
Yeah, overall I love 76. I do wish for a few things, better connections server wise, bigger CAMP allotment. Little things like that. Mostly, though, I just enjoy it. 
---
I vote no. Get a microphone. Simple as that
---
I heard 50% but it's more like 30% in my observations.
---
No y‚Äôall would not love to have me 
---
An LT from Xbox maybe kicked me because he got butt hurt
---

---
*I'm not wrong, nor was I ever wrong. Your data is fake news.*
---
No matter how many times I see this suggested it'll never get old. We absolutely need perk card presets. The PC guys can run a mod but us console players have to keep swapping manually. It's one of the biggest PIAs in the game.
---
I also tend to forget cards when swapping them. So I'll be crafting and realize too late I forgot super duper or ammo smith
---
The people who aren‚Äôt playing it are playing because they don‚Äôt want too or they‚Äôve watched too many bad reviews. Whilst there is content it could use more, it depends on the person and if they‚Äôre completists or not, i am. But i‚Äôm not in the business of wasting my time so i‚Äôll only do quests and activities that are beneficial to me, that said there isn‚Äôt enough quests and activities to offer viable rewards, like if there was more quests to get more unique weapons hell yeah i‚Äôm all over that, but once you‚Äôve joined the factions all there is left to do is explore the same map markers you‚Äôve been too and farm nukes.
---
I enjoy the farm because i want better gear, but it gets repetitive very easily
---
I‚Äôve suffered this same issue on a team. Once inside the white springs hotel. Then once in Grafton in the street. I though it was a power armor issue. But you could be right about it happening after spawning in somewhere.
---
It's around the same price as the others 1600 or 1800 I think?
---
Same thing happened to me. Got teamed up on by 3 people and 1 was a 140. Difference is both of his friends were around my level so I killed them with no problem. But he would continue to stealth and one hit me with a war drum. Then followed me to a new server somehow and tried to kill me again before I just got off and played another game. (And yes it was new because of certain details - too much to type) 
---
One comforting thought is that modding can easily be monitored, controlled and instantly shutdown by Bethesda if they see something they don't like. It's literally their system, enabled by them (Bethesda). It's .ba2 files (bethesda archive v2 file format). 
---
So the fact we've gone 2 banwaves and several patches to fix exploits without Bethesda turning mod capability off is a good sign. 
---
But you will never have certainty unless it's from Bethesda's official creator's club, which isn't implemented.
---
The damage is already so severe that short of taking the game down and rereleasing it in a year completely reworked a la FFXIV it is hopeless.  
---
This describes the mythical radium rifle mods.
---
I never understood how people got that. I'm fully specced in rifleman and bloody mess yet my ts lever was only around 200dmg which is far from one shotting high level mobs. 
---
Wow. He probably won't be invited to future events by Bethesda. ;p
---
He's right though. The grindy time sink BS is why I barely play it. 
---
its a common glitch with radiation in general
---
Clicking on the link provided is hard?
---
Hmmm... is it worth the rarity of the ammo?
---
I'd play with y'all. 
---
I saw the Fallout or Bethesda Twitter account liking a Twitter post with a thumbnail of a player showing his Perks, you could clearly see he was using this mod. So I imagined "oh they support this". But I guess the Twitter administrator who liked the post didn't know this wasn't part of the game.
---
It indeed should be a feature so that the other platform can use this as well. You can make different builds (melee vs heavy guns for instance) which provides diversity imo.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work too well on mobile, no need to be snide.
---
Damn my luck
---
I can't play at the moment (for at least another couple of weeks), but I'd be willing to pay good caps for a crapload of black titanium.
---
Oh well, you snooze, you lose.
---
Hope you find somebody to take that off your hands.
---
Well, this night I was planning a trip to Thunder Mountain, now you're making me wonder if I want to.
---
3 scorchbeasts -- no problemo, but fucking cave crickets -- ugh.
---
Today. Just take it as great minds think alike
---
Builds aren‚Äôt really near completion until lvl 50, just pick whatever perks benefit you right now until end game. 
---
Cant imagine its worth it
---
I found out the hard way running out of a raider camp somewhere up north. After getting vaporized I definitely heard the signature sound of the caps I remember from previous games.
---
Yes it's okay.
---
Vsync is better off if you have a computer that can run more frames than your monitor can allow.
---
I have limited play time so 2 guns 2 melee is usually plenty 
---
For me the only real good aspect was the exploration part, but since i was kinda everywhere now, its just not satisfying to do anything. Shooting was okay (i have a stealthy shotgun/sniper build), but not enough for me to go on (especially since in previous fallout games i had a high charisma/stealthy build).
---
I dunno, i will check back eventually but right now there is nothing interesting for me in it.
---
Anybody know what's the use of  Corpse Flower Stamen? I sometimes randomly get 3-5 of these and never know why and is it of any use?
---
Play around with [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=) and make a build to aim for at lever 50. At the bottom of the page you get a roadmap you can follow. Pick your PA perks and add what you deem useful.  You can create several builds for roaming, crafting, lockpicking and switch perks accordingly.
---
It is viable, just don't expect to shot monster, you can't compare let's say pistols with melees, or pistols with fatmans, each type of weapon has its own design, pros and cons.  
---
I got a gunslinger char currently at level 68.
---
I have no porblem against any enemy, whether it be the mirelurk queen or a horde of supermutants, i just spam vats on their weakpoints and they all fall down before i do. Just use some common sense and dont charge full frontal, you are no tank. I use stealth actions too, way better at night, you also spam vats crits this way and it's no joke.

mutations: bird bones &amp; eagle eye (must have), electrically charged, unstable isotope, marsupial and grounded
---
you can use it as bloodied too, just use a bloodied pistol, possibly with vats sub effects, use adrenal reaction mutation, use nerd rage rank 3 + gunsmith rank 2 on int instead of gunsmith rank 5, if you want to "do mor damage", your choice
---
Well... The why is what I explained. It's an event reward, but it's bugged so everyone on the server gets it.
---
As to what it's used for, pretty much nothing spectacular. If it could somehow make a miniscule amount of flux (VERY unlikely, I know) it'd be worthwhile but there's a reason the event is rarely done.
---
Whitesprings is tough at level 13 for some players depending on build route. Try not to be in whitesprings all the time.
---
&gt; a set distance that enemy is *aloud* to move away from said location
---
Allowed
---
Why isn't it in game already?! So frustrating trying to communicate with someone, with the like 10 emotes. Either that or for there to be a "no mic/do you have mic" emote atleast.
---
I've done it few times, since every event in Forest can reward you with rare outfits (Responders Fireman outfit and helm etc.), but generally most events are worth the rewards...
---
I used to build there too, but it got really busy. 
---
I built a staircase from the bridge down to the opening. It was the only way in.
---
Loved that spot.
---
Your camp looks great.
---
They appear the same due to a bug that may be fixed in the game data files where the material swap for the Knight Suit has a bug.
---
Wiggle the thumb stick and jump repeatedly, as if youre squirming. You rarely get truly stuck. If you really do get stuck then well ya it happens. I can count on 1 hand how many times ive truly been stuck.
---
I've not actually seen too much retconned. There's nothing much that happens in 76 that effects the other games since nobody makes it out of Appalachia alive (Even us as players ultimately). The only thing that bothers me is finding t60 everywhere should be very rare or even non existent at this point?
---
i send a message to your pm, can you help me? 
---
You're gonna need a BIG newspaper...
---
Also I got it from Patrol Duty quest on my first try at level 44. Either drop rate adjusted or very lucky.
---
Grahm sometimes carries it, I found him when I was level 19ish and couldn't afford them, stressed me out no end from what people were saying about the level cap.
---
This likely has something to do with your end of the connection.  (I don't think you should be punished for not having a 100mbs connection, just saying that it's likely not their server but your connection to it)  I have a decent 50mbs connection, a pretty solid gaming PC with 16m of ram and a 4m graphics card and live literally a stone's throw away from my local internet provider's station and I have 2-3 seconds at best where I'm getting chewed on by the two ticks that are near my camp and immediately aggro on me at my usual fast travel spawn point.  It's not deadly, but I get parasites from them at least twice a day and take time walking up the river from Flatwoods to make and keep at least 10 disease cures on hand at all times.
---
I'm considering moving my Camp simply because of the constant parasites and inability to fight back for a couple seconds while loading into my home base, but I'd also lose the tick blood and antiseptic they always drop, not to mention the two free silt beans, three firecracker berries, 3-4 bloodleaf and unlimited dirty water around my house.
---
It's much worse when a mob of lvl 40-60 super mutants spawn with me when I fast travel to my Camp and I'm watching myself getting beat up while loading and realize I have my backup pistol equipped for the +20% Gun Runner movement speed.  I'm getting lit up by 3-4 high level super mutants, need to load in, then swap to my axe and then defend myself and my house from their missiles and grenades.  
---
I had a bunch of mutfruit and gourd plants outside until I realized that I had to fix them constantly, and my missile turrets would just sway casually without a care in the world until I manually re-placed them along with the spotlight that was supposed to give them longer target acquisition.  I wound up removing the turrets entirely because all they did was eat up my budget while providing middling defense when they weren't on breakfast/second breakfast/brunch/lunch/second lunch/supper/dinner and three mandatory tea-time breaks.  I didn't think it was that hard to be on dedicated, unreachable platforms with a fusion generator feeding them way more power than they could ever need, with the only job being to spend 10 seconds to smash a couple lvl 21 ticks and an odd wolf or ghoul pack once or twice a day when I wanted to craft, repair or sleep at home unmolested.
---
At the current game limits, you can really only have 1 build of your character and cannot store equipment for another build unless you sacrifice a tremendous amount of junk storage to do so.  
---
I feel like keeping 100 of each junk component seems doable for 600 weight limit.  Perhaps the new 800 limit with 200 lbs would let people keep those limits and thus allow for keeping a few pieces for a new build?
---
Not sure, the game right now does not really encourage swapping builds even though the perk system is made for that type of thing (with exception of no perk decks for swapping).
---
Where do I get that one?
---
The legendary assaultron down in the first row?  That one?   I can usually kill it/her with my stealth build pretty decently.  Occasionally she gets a few lucky hits to my head and I need to respawn and go back inside and finish her.  But usually can get her without incident.  Avoid that deathray and melee attack though.   run up the stairs when she comes at you.   drop some mines if needed as your backpeddling.  
---
That why I'm accumulating those things. Well now I know they can just be dropped then. Wish the canned stew "glich" would come back. 
---
Seems you have not focused much on damage output
---
That's how you get the crafting material for Super Stimpacks. Get someone else to do the event, don't join, and you get the Corpse Flower Stamen. Then all you need is Strangler Pods to make the Super Stimpacks.
---
It was a bugged drop table and it was fixed ages ago.
---
It was good meeting up with ya this weekend. Hope we did some good and hope your stream watchers were entertained :D
---
That was a bug, robobrains were not supposed to drop fusion cores. See [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1to3g/december\_4th\_patch\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1to3g/december_4th_patch_notes/)
---
&gt;**ENEMIES**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**(Added Dec 6)** Robobrains: Now use their own loot list instead of the Sentry Bot loot list, and have a chance after level 40 to drop the Tesla Gun plan.
---
Im no min maxer but its pretty easy to keep your dmg around 1000 / swing with a bloodied 2h while having 50% hp, im PA thats more then enough
---
What system are you on? 
---
Just set up some concrete barriers surrounded by turrets...wish I'd done it yesterday.
---
I got stuck like this near Morgantown airport. To get out, I placed my Power Armor and then tried to enter it and was free
---
Devon idk why you're saying uhhhhhhhhh, fallout 1, 2 and Tactics were not 1st person.
---
Either quit the game and just restart and it will change servers or just go to map, hit RB, go to your profile at the top, say leave world and hit play, it will change worlds
---
Poop happens 
---
3 ghouls. Maybe 4. Low level. Barely an inconvenience.
---
You're not that squishy. :D Hope you had some good times clearing quests and farming Whitespring Golf Club a bit.
---
Awesome! Thank you so much. And from researching further I'm getting conflicted answers on whether supermutants or scorched are better to farm for the hunting rifle. And if the scorched then where would be the best place?
---
My mic is merely a source of vitriol directed against the spawned mobs in game, or an endless stream of sarcastic commentary. 
---
All 3 BoS underarmors are rare plan drops in the trainyard near Watoga. If you're on PC I can sell you Knight for 700 caps.
---
At the moment there are no free skins for the XO1 power armor. The outfit you are talking about is a BOS officer suit. If you are on PS4 I think I have one. 
---
Scorched are everywhere, hunting rifles are everywhere, you will find a ton of them, so don't worry. Depends on your level, where do you hang out the most ?
---
Well shid. And a dude on pc said that he had one aswell. I‚Äôm on xbox. Smh
---
I hope you gave him all the bacon and eggs you had.  He's definitely a swanson.
---
If not, do so next time.  Please and thank you.
---
They for sale in the train station?
---
"It was like this when I got here...I swear"
---
I just downloaded the game yesterday and I've just been wandering around lol, not staying in any specific area
---
Thank you for sharing. I watched all of it, and really enjoyed it. I'm a long time fallout and Bethesda fan who didnt purchase 76 because I didnt like the direction they went. And I still enjoyed this extremely  long (for me) video
---
That doesn't sound bad at all. I'll check it out tomorrow night!
---
Yup, would be a simple fix to cater to both ends of the spectrum as far as player base is concerned.  But Bethesda's suits be like : fornite market! 
---
What those idiots don't get is why would someone pay for a game that wasn't built around PvP only to play PvP, when they could play fortnite for free. 
---
Prototype paint is free, no way to put it back on after removing it though 
---
Dang that‚Äôs sad. Months ago I had maybe 60 fusion cores from killing robobrains where you get excavator armor. It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve killed any til now and didn‚Äôt get one.  I have 28 left. 
---
Bring back robobrain‚Äôs fusion core. Been months since I‚Äôve killed one and they dropped cores. Killed today and none.  
---
An interesting spear, you say?
---
Is a TS-Fatman in any way a good thing? 520 dmg or so... found one yesterday.
---
Some guy sold me a jet pack without the paint. So now I got all proof but no chest piece.
---
Crafting Super Stimpaks.
---
I was in vault 76 making a new character when I heard a male kid talk swedish to his friends at his house while making his character. He for some reason says "Haha, I'm a little girl" to his friends and doesn't realize his microphone is on so I walk up to the room is in and say "Did you say you were a little girl? oh no how embarassing" 
---
I hear him gasp in the mic, he starts looking around frantically and goes "There's SOME GUY IN HERE! I HEARD SOME GUY" and I go "Be careful who you tell your secrets to" and he starts laughing
---
Read again my answer...
---
Thx, good to know it's not uselessüòâ
---
The only thing this video fails with is his ideas for the perfect game. He openly admits he has no idea about game development and that his ideas are too ambitious. Most of his huge ideas just aren't possible and now everyone and their mother are saying Bethesda needs to make the game like he said.
---
It's reel
---
ok airport and train yard near middle of map next to MorganTown is filled with scorched, like I said they all, you going to run into them. Scorched are generally easier to handle than Super Mutants.
---
Camden Park is a great place for levelling up, I am there often, decent levels from 6-32 scorched, also easy dailies for the challenges and scorched.
---
All around Charleston is scorched and other enemies including ghouls, super mutants etc.
---
I would stick to the middle and lower end of the map and west or left side of the map. The east or right, north or top and south or bottom levels get hairy quickly and are meant for higher levels.
---
Start at the airport, you will find plenty of scorched and the train yard near morgantown and near the airport.
---
Also make sure you do your daily and weekly challenges fo free Atoms, dailies need to be completed each day, weeklies each week. Just go to Map, hit LB and Challenges to see your challenges, they pretty fun, some are tedious, dailies are generally easy.
---
That torso can never get the prototype paint. Honestly though you could craft a 2nd set of x01 , 1 for jetpack 1 for more utility. Jetpack for x01 is super rare but it's not like it's useful unless you're trying to get somewhere strange. No point in just keeping one stray piece of x01 in your stash though, might as well have a whole chassis with a full set of gear on it
---
Vsync exists in that game as it does because movement speed was tied to the players frame rate, allowing people with better machines to literally move faster than those without. Or atleast that's what I had heard.
---
I know this is a very late reply and you probably already know this now, but for what it's worth, if you go to the Transfer menu for any lootable container (including bodies) you can select any junk items and it will tell you what they break down into. Very useful if you aren't sure if it's worth picking an item up.
---
I would actually recommend a new system, where non-combat relevant skills are permanently equipped.
---
So Hacker, Picklock, weaponsmith, travelagent for example - and then you only need to switch cards if you really want to change your build. For example going from shotgun to melee or to tank.
---
Not a good combo imo. Shotgun + melee better. Thats if u want high dmg
---
Don‚Äôt try sneaking away in cranberry bogs in power armour when three scorched beasts and multiple scorched start chasing you. Learned the hard way that these perks won‚Äôt work üò©
---
No need for power armor. I only use in nuke. I can stand in middle of all ghouls in golfclub without a problem of surviving
---
I had a group of what sounded like 12 year olds that I helped once.
---
They were perfectly gracious and thankful for my help, didn‚Äôt swear/ say anything remotely nasty even once, and I was shocked but also super happy about the entire interaction.
---
Only downside is that for about a week after they constantly spammed me with game and party invites, but it didn‚Äôt last long üòÇ
---
Snore snore snore. Thanks for the update on your life. üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥
---
Yes, had it yesterday when doing quests in charleston.
---
Not yet, except for the fact that there are no PvP restrictions and that you'll drop some aid items as well as your junk when you die.
---
As good as...
---
Given that they require:
---
1 x Ultracite
---
2 x Antiseptic
---
1 x Steel
---
1 x Strangler Pod
---
1 x Blood Pack
---
1 x Corpse Flower Stamen
---
I think I might have crafted them a couple of times then dumped them in a mule.
---
My Vote would be no, even though my Vote means nothing.
---
In general, it wouldn't really work.  Have you ever attempted to use Text Chat in an FPS?  Personally, if implemented, I would disable the Text Chat completely...  I don't want more junk cluttering my Screen.  I turn Text Chat off in MMOs because I don't like the Idea... So even if someone tried to chat with me, I wouldn't see it.
---
As for the Accessibility aspect...  Well, to be fully compliant, you would need to modify the Voice Chat to have Speech to Text Capabilities, IE Subtitles for Voice.  Anyone who has used such software knows what a crap-shoot they are...
---
Then, for pure text, you need both a Text to Speech and a Speech To Text engine.  The abuse people could do with those...  
---
Yeah, plus they broke the mod with their recent updates, so it doesn't work now. 
---
Yeah, I really didn‚Äôt want to kill him, cause ya know, bad luck and all ;)
---
So I heard, but I use the 'f' word a lot, as you also heard.  It is a mature game, though, so...
---
Yes, I was doing better, my stream watchers were having fun, but then my computer had a critical failure that I have since recovered from with some creativity and anxious hoping.
---
üòÇüëç
---
Grahm sells the Chinese officer sword plan, though he still needs to be server hopped.
---
I really liked this video, he definitely put a lot of thought behind it, and that goes to show that he actually cares about the game. I agree with a lot of the criticisms he brings up, and think some of his suggested fixes are good. But a lot of the suggestions he makes seem to be geared towards a fantasy version of this game that appeals to him and a very niche audience that like a more strict survival and community experience.
---
Onto my counter thoughts.
---
While yes it's tedious to grind for junk, it's part of the core gameplay, I spent I think 6 hours the other day grinding the resources for the excavator armor, and I loved it It felt so rewarding after putting all the work in. Granted I don't want to constantly have to do that just to maintain stuff, but I feel it roughly balances out although I think some resources need to be buffed (like screws). 
---
I understand why he wants character specialization, it does make sense for a multiplayer experience, but I like playing solo, I like having to maintain my own resources. But I also like bumping into other players have having a little bit of interaction with them. There does need to be more reason for players to interact yes, but I don't see why you can't have solo play and co-op play coexisting together. 
---
A lot of people on this sub just seem to bitch, just to bitch. I have myself expressed my feelings towards PvP. But at the same time, I'm still enjoying the game for what it is, and while new features and quality of life improvements and welcome I don't think that they should be a major priority at this time. But the subreddit thinks that they should be the main focus of the dev time. 
---
And in regards to controlled server play, and instanced play, I think it could work well with a mix. 
---
If you and a bunch of other people decide to make a town, such as is suggest in the video, then your character gets locked to that server, then you and your group can work towards smaller but lasting changes for the world on that server that make a difference on a micro level for you guys, but doesn't effect the macro level too much for those playing solo. 
---
Now if you're playing solo only relying on your CAMPsite then every time you log in it's a different server, you can see new people each time, you can check out different player towns and what those towns have done to change the world, but you can still get that solo experience. 
---
I also think that in this hypothetical game system, if you are a part of the town, but want to leave for whatever reason and go back to instanced play you can choose to leave the town. You could also possibly decide to leave your structures there now a part of the town, or have them go away too. 
---
So then in this scenario solo players can keep trucking along, and communities can form and stay static to a server.
---
I really don't like that in the video his whole vision of the game is to make it a survival game akin to fallout 4s survival mode, as someone in a comment above said, they play games to relax, and tend to not have much time during the week to sit down and play. Having more intense survival mechanics, and even biomes to the point where you need player caravans or a stealth build to survive just defeats the purpose of playing for someone like that. 
---
I think the survival mechanics do need a re work, thirst and hunger meters need a slower drain, food and it's components should not spoil nearly as fast, I currently keep most of the perishable food on my person because if I put it in my stashbox it'll just spoil and I wont even use them.
---
Difficulty needs a rebalance, and in a perfect world it would.be balanced for solo play, a group play separately even if you're on the same server. 
---
While solo you get smaller groups of tougher enemies, and in a grouole you get swarms of enemies that range from weak to strong, some being fodder some being actual threats. 
---
Now to keep things interesting, solo players could run into swarms of enemies in certain areas, requiring them to take a different approach or find other players to group up with to make it though. Maybe these could be specific quests that emphasize co-op or mini-dungeons/raids that give good loot.
---
I understand that this all would be difficult to program, but by the end of the video we were already talking about a hypothetical perfect game (to MaTN at least)
---
But sadly the major changes suggest would require Bethesda to tell the already decently sized player base that all new content would have to be paused as the whole game gets rebuilt from the ground up. While it would be cool to see major changes to the world like more radiation every where and dead plant life after nukes have been dropped, to cities and infrastructure being rebuilt in a pristine world with unlaunched nukes, I feel (and can't really back this up with a proper argument) that it'd just be wrong to have that kind of lasting permanence in the world.
---
I do agree though that the nuke zones should have more impact, while I have not reached that part myself in game, it is weird seeing everything in a nuke zone 
---
Still standing, and plant life still alive but there is just a filter over everything, it feels cheap. 
---
In the end I appreciate video it brings to light legit issues stated in a way that's constructive and not solely critical, while also not being entitled whining (looking at a lot of posts on this sub) props to you ManyATrueNerd.
---
Yes, now is the Fallout new California, it's already out
---
Like it! 
---
This isn't quite the same but I once got a 260 cap bounty on my head because I saw some ghouls in the distance and shot an Auto Grenade Launcher at them, completely levelling someone's camp which I, like an idiot, didn't realise they were stood on.
---
I only craft normal Stimpacks, since they require only bloodpack, antiseptic and steel, I don't even know if I have super-stimpack recipe learned...
---
Same as me really, stopped playing nearly 4 months ago and want to know it if it‚Äôs any better because o too have always loved the fallout series?
---
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
---
I've been debating going shotgun/melee as well, I just really like the black powder rifle.
---
If I spec for unarmed though it seemed at first glance that going shotgun, another close range damage weapon, would be somewhat redundant.
---
so repapply mutatiuon will not fix it.
---
No you  just play and have fun from the start. If you dont, uninstall and play another game.
---
You dont have to do shit to enjoy anything but try it.  You either enjoy it or you dont.  Random fuckwits on reddit cant help you decide if you are having fun or not.
---
Wow, thank you so much for the detailed response! Also I'm assuming I should get a few of the main story quests done as well? Just doing the first one where you meet this mayor, but the airport and such will probably keep me busy a while, thank you!
---
Sneak was always finicky however after the January 29 patch it became wildly unpredictable.
---
Whatever change they implemented to:
---
 **Stealth:** Addressed an issue  in which stealth damage bonuses could still be applied by a sneaking  player‚Äôs attacks during PVP even that player was within their target‚Äôs  direct line of sight. 
---
Also messed up sneak even further.

Lots of bug fixes and improved stability.

Yup I've West Tek is one of my farming sites too. I've rotated through 5 or 6 different ones at this point. Always trying to map out the most effective strategy.

And is the content the Same ? Or more ?

I made a couple of creepy [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCbWUGGTvBiwzWZEg06l0w) with him...
---
Are you willing to sell the skeleton mask plan? 
---
Yep! That‚Äôs it. 
---
Well done posting this here, SolarDragon! I was wondering when Jon's Mega Video would appear on Reddit - nice to see someone from the community spreading the word around!
---
You said trainyard. There is no train yard. 
---
Why just PC? Consoles could do with one for the exact same reason. The need for an in game text chat shouldn't be determined by what hardware you're using.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what i‚Äôve doing since the release of the roadmap: storing light-weight legendaries instead of selling to vendors.
---
Well seems the fusion core manufacturer at the powerplant is constructing quicker since the nerf, dunno if its back to pre-nerf values but it seems faster nonetheless.
---
Of course, I‚Äôll be on later this afternoon and this evening. We can meet up for the trade. üëç
---
I've not tried the outfits thingy. Lately I rarely get legendary drops too! Use to get them all the time. Thinking of taking on some of the events and dailys. I've done quite a few in the past but really only because of proximity. Guess I'll add those to the agenda.
---
Personally to me it feels somewhat better I have far fewer disconnects and crashes than I did 3-4 months ago but obviously there's no huge changes in say the way the game plays, it's still a major grind in the fact that certain enemies are still massive bullet sponges and it's still a race against other players to get certain materials but overall I still find it enjoyable. Still no major endgame content after sbq
---
I don‚Äôt think you can clean versions of the asylum uniforms, you can get different colors but they are still a bit dirty.
---
True. It mostly what u enjoy using imo. Im no min /maxer or pro but i always live by the motto in games - kill enemies fast enough so they cant kill you üòÅ i used a lever before tse nerf and it was fun . But after the nerf speccing into 1 is a must to deal even half decent dmg with rifles
---
Farm Whitespring, a lot of the ghouls drop radaway and Rad x.
---
I would ejoy sg/unarmed more if we had perk setups to just swap
---
Different colours would be fine too, where do they spawn?
---
The same, but check out the roadmap that they released last week.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
40% faster swing, damage increase 10% if mutated, +1 strength.
---
üòÇ
---
You can find a few of the colored uniforms at fort defiance but they are hard to find, the red uniform you get from an event.
---
I agree I can only usually get on for a few hours at a time on the weekends and I really enjoy the game most of the time, granted there are days where it's not as enjoyable due to some of the grind but I don't regret buying the game one bit
---
I'll give both a try and see what ends up sticking, shotguns are str as well so it might end up giving me some more room to get some different cards to make it more versatile. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Fair enough
---
Thanks for the info!
---
There are decontamination arches on power plants and blackwater mine.
---
Yes please, a re-work of the perk system would be nice
---
Fallout 3 is my favourite 
---
Guess I'm back to grinding Fort Defiance. I thought maybe they'd spawn there but they must be pretty low rng as I've cleared it out loads of times. At least straitjackets are good for vending.
---
Thanks:) 
---
Okay thanks :) 
---
I just want to know ***WHY*** they changed cargo drops from being a free-for-all to owned by a player.
---
When they did that, I dropped all of my supply requests and never bothered again.
---
The loot in those crates are complete shit once you are above level 5.  I only ever called them into Flatwoods to give a nice present to low level players.
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
 /u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
 /u/Valseek
---
Why was this changed?  Was it intentional?  Can you change it back?
---
Melee/tank build, invest in strength and endurance
---
Yes, it is a strange bug. Sometimes feral ghouls will explode too.
---
I have spent a lot of hours just wandering around the map "site seeing." I've enjoyed that exploration process. It's not very labor-intensive nor does it result in big exp gains but I've seen the sites.
---
In order of operations regarding other things I've done...
---
1) Following quest lines.
---
2) Treasure maps - I actually like these even though I know everybody else seems to dislike them. They are quick and easy to do in a 15 minute run which is about as long as I can give to the game at some points during the day.
---
3) Building a camp - I'm still working on collecting plans for a cool camp build. Mine is pretty basic still.
---
Not only do I agree but I can add that there's actual science behind it! It's part of the theory of Operant Conditioning, whereas people (usually children, which says a lot about griefers), show negative, unwanted behavior to get any reaction from their counterpart. They gladly accept this so-called "negative reinforcement" (people reacting negatively to their bad behavior) because they can't get any kind of positive reinforcement elsewhere. The best course of action is to reinforce good behavior, while leaving bad behavior unrewarded by simply ignoring it. Or as the ancient internet proverb puts it: Don't feed the troll. Eventually, misbehaving children (read: griefers) learn that their behavior doesn't merit anything worthwhile and (in the best case) stop.
---
Glad if it helped. 1 more tip- get ar mutation
---
I'd pay for that kind of luck - can't tell you how much time I've wasted chasing that damn thing!
---
I would prefer perk loadouts you can switch in and out as a hot key, but this is a good second option.

---
Hmmm.  Perhaps Scorchbeasty jealous of all the attention that Mothy getting, saw the sign and flew into a rage, lol. 
---
I'll check this out today and report back. Thanks for the idea!
---
I don't end my game session at Blackwater mine because of this. The mole miners will wreck you before you are loaded I learned this the hard way.
---
Yeah but the difference is you were actually seeking to join, its annoying when you already have people to play and they're already spamming. It's especially worse when they're trying to profit off you and have things like a patreon or a youtube channel they're spamming
---
I like your use of the poltergeist 2 sound clip.  Very creepy bad guy.   Little known fact,  actor who played the preacher was dying from pancreatic cancer during that film. 
---
That‚Äôs a place but not in eating a and doesn‚Äôt have a vendor
---
Nothing is safe from mole rats. Those bastards teleport and start eating the crops anyways.
---
Yeah I've got AR and all the melee mutations already, it's definitely been a game changer so far.
---
Go to the glass mine at the end ,each day you have a chance to get Bos heavy combat/Bos combat peice I've got a full set of Bos heavy combat after about 7 days and I scrapped the other parts to learn mods for it,be aware there is a scorch beast at the end of it Inc sometimes a other bugged one that fly into the walls.
---
The enforcer perk with any shotgun is great, enemies cannot hit you if they cannot walk
---
There is a more aesthetic and lower camp budget method for doing this I've utilized in my base but it takes an absolute fuck ton of time pixel perfectly placing things.
---
I like the idea! How about those perks unlocking variants of the crafting stations though? Like the perk "home defense" does? They could look a bit different, depending on which perk they benefit from. 
---
If you are able to go into the elevator in Fort Defiance, go to the third floor and look in either two rooms on the beds and then check in the bathroom on the bench in front of the showers. I‚Äôve been to this place multiple times and have found a white version (still a little dirty but better than the 2 other white versions) blue, green, brown, and now pink! Link below shows proof for the pink since I just found it yesterday. Also, you might only want to check once a day or wait a few hours to go back to the Asylum because I feel like it takes a little for them to spawn. I can server hop (which I have) multiple times and not find a single one but some hours go by and I‚Äôll find another brown or something

---
There's not many bugs or glitches as of now, the game is more stable than ever.  
---
There's new content start rolling next week.
---
Which platform? I got an clean white asylum uniform :) 
---
I found a white asylum uniform at fort defiance, which looks like a clean version. I maybe only came across 1 in my many server jumps 
---
But now who will carry your 1700 cheese wheels?
---
I have experienced this way too much in two days. 
---
Entering the building or fast travel is causing issue. My solution was whoever invisible quits from server and rejoin but loading screen in PS4 is pain in the ass.
---
Ok üëç
---
I triggered one last night and it dropped near Poseidon.  I usually just open them and leave them for others.  Someone got there right before me and picked the lock.   
---
Poor dude.  I let him know I would clear his bounty and also he may want to remove his armor.  
---
Shot him, threw a few stims and disease cures in his bag and guarded it for a few minutes.  
---
He didn‚Äôt come back, so I shrugged and moved on.  
---
Left the bag.  I hope he got it.
---
What you don't like RNG? I love it!!! /s
---
 (25.02.2019) ver 1.0.6.0 \[PC\] - still broken, also for me.
---
I mean, have you seen a Scorchbeast Queen? Not a lot going for her in the looks department.
---
I met someone really cool and started on some quests together, but got disconnected before we could even send friend invites to each other. RIP bro I will never know again :(
---
He has a lot of good points that i hope Bethesda do take note on.  
---
However.  
---
He basically just wants to turn it into a super hardcore elite gamer game that only appeals to the most hardcore survival fans.  I dont feel like casual players would like this much if at all.   
---
I would put myself as someone who plays more than casually but not too extreme, and i feel like the drastic changed he suggests go too far as to take out a lot of the fun.  
---
The game waas never advertised as hardcore survival in fact it was advertisd as softcore survival.  
---
Maybe add in a hardcore mode but from other hardcore games ive played (dayz/rust/ark) people do not work together, ever
---
Near Watoga, not in Watoga, trainyard not trainstation, and I haven't write a word 'vendor' anywhere?!?!
---
Definitely. I hate the PvP in this game. I actively avoid it. I've had some fun with PvP. When I first started a level 60, 30 and 20 character were all attacking me in flatwoods. I was 15 or so, had no junk on me and wasn't worth many caps. It was just annoying. The level 60 left and the other 2 kept annoying me. I fought back with grenades, frag mines and a machete and killed them both 4-5 times as they kept coming at me. It was kind of fun. I died a few times too. But then there's all the high level pvp... I was holding munitions factory, 2 players pop in. One waves at me, the other started assaulting the workshop. I then die in one hit to a TSE , and my power armor that was all at 200% durability is now red. I dropped some random junk nbd and lose some caps but... My power armor is nearly broken in one hit wtf. Fast forward to after the TSE Nerf... I started reading about people who have workshops getting attacked outside their workshop over and over. So I am now even less likely to use workshops. A few nights ago I completely ran out of acid. I decided to risk taking workshops. I take hemlock holes, throw down generators and what not. Start the first defense. Some random dude shows up on mic "you need help?? You need help??" ... Then starts attacking me. I forgot to turn off pacifist. I'm now dead and this dumbass is teabagging and saying something about taking my shit -_- lol hope the radscorpion stinger was good loot. Server hop so I don't have to be on the douchebags server. Take hemlock again, a little while later I'm notified someone is taking my workshop. I'm wearing a set of t51b 200% repair, 3 fireproof 4 lone wanderer. When I finally load in from fast travel, I'm already dead. One shot by a chameleon sniper.... Lovely. So this is what PvP looks like... Getting 1 shot, or having assassin's sentinel or cavalier to be unkillable until staggered. And power armor might as well be paper. Unless you're in a nukezone, you're pretty much required to wear it there. I played WoW for years. I always played on PvP servers, competed in arena and in battlegrounds. PvP is fun. This game PvP is totally garbage to me. A few hours ago I was in blackwater mine. A level 30 runs into me. I hear "oh shit he's got a gun". I'm level 150 or so. Why is it that the 30 completely expects me to murder him? I'm in power armor buddy, power armor is garbage for PvP you're safe lol. -_- 
---
All must sacrifice pants! Praise be!
---
I'm on PS4
---
So, tell me. Where do they drop.
---
Just add it to console since we've had them in MMOs like neverwinter before with huge success
---
I don't think you've watched the video... 
---
That's fantastic, I'll make sure to check there first. I have access to the whole of Fort Defiance. Completed all the quests, now just trying to complete my murder nurse aesthetic.
---
The pink looks great!
---
Good advice, will give that a try tonight.
---
Thanks for help I will try them
---
Where did you get the sack hood from? I know that you can get two variants from raider vendors, but I've never seen one without hoses
---
The red herring crap is just a marketing ploy to suck ppl in.  900 guy used it to bring ppl to his channel, same as everyone else.
---
I don‚Äôt blame anyone for trying to make a dime BUT I draw the line at hypocrisy. 
---
I love it when they hit me at a vendor. PVP them because they don't expect it Seriously half the time they go right for the vendor and you can take them out before they realize you engaged them.
---
I also only sell weapons because of this so I don't lose my precious junk lol.
---
One of the most iconic creepy movie moments. I‚Äôm working on some other clips - you can achieve some pretty decent cinematography in FO76!
---
I didn‚Äôt know that about Julian Beck - that‚Äôs awful.
---
told you already two posts above, NAR train repair yard (don't remember the exact name).
---
Thank you! And I hope you can get all the colors you want! For the longest I couldn‚Äôt find anyone really talking about the different colors until recently and it made me start searching again so I definitely had to come on here and help others who are wondering the same. 
---
After the roadmap announcement I am saving all my legendary gear. IDK how will system be but I am sure it will be better that selling them to 20 caps.
---
Agree with a ton of his points but his suggestions towards end game seem extremely exploitable with dummy accounts/large factions a la Ark/Rust. For example there would be nothing stopping the towns from making the game extremely noob harsh by agreeing to share and stockpile nuke survival tools and meds and constantly and consistently nuking the place to monopolize end game material and prevent raids. Also offline raiding/baiting town defenses doesn't sound too hard either.
---
Whaaaat a common sense solution that'll never work.
---
This is my core feeling as well. There are some very interesting ideas. Most of them aren't implementable in this game. The main problem being that his ideas would make it a game that, while interesting to some (myself included), it'd shut out a good portion of the casual crowd.
---
Perhaps as a separate game mode (Nuclear Winter perhaps...?) or it'd be fantastic as the basis for some hardcore survival mod on a private server, but not for the mainstream.
---
On the ground?
---
You can enjoy it with limited play. In fact you will probably enjoy it more. There are hundreds of places to explore. Exploring a couple per game play will eat up an hour without noticing.
---
I posted and traded specifically for it and with that character in mind. I‚Äôve never seen one anywhere else in game - at vendors or any other players - so assume it‚Äôs a rare raider list drop. I‚Äôm XB1 so also assume it‚Äôs a legit item.
---
inside the half-square shaped hangar, in various places.
---
It‚Äôs called just ‚ÄòSack hood‚Äô
---
Agree with this 100%. Try it, if you're enjoying yourself, keep playing.
---
No it doesn't require a huge time sink to enjoy, quite the opposite. Spend too much time on the game and you run out of fun stuff to do. Take your time. Be in the moment.
---
Wait... is that... a camp on a tree?! \*heavy breathing\*
---
How long is a piece of string?
---
If levelling up is what makes you enjoy it, then I'd say that an hour isn't enough time.
---
I play about 3hrs most nights, a nice round off to the day to help me unwind.
---
or do what I do and forget to swap back
---
Why?
---
Thanks 
---
Have it happen on almost every play through except last night.  Tried something different.  
---
Let the first person fully load in before following them.  Seemed to work.  
---
Your mileage may vary.
---
You and me both :)
---
I'm pretty sure when they released FO76 they clearly stated all future DLC will be funded by the atom shop transactions. Thoigh I can see how this could be overlooked.
---
Yeah, I know, but just because you aren't spending 100% of your time farming Whitespring does not mean you have to move your camp and enable others to farm themselves. At least not from POV of camp owner. He just does not care.
---
Yesterday I had to move my camp from - what I thought to be - remote location, because changing server 10 times didn't resolve "cant place your camp" issue. So I suspect this could be another reason to keep "your" spot at Whitespring, since it is much more contested.
---
Of course I think that the whole Whitespring issue is cheating and should have been dealt with long time ago, so it's not like I'm endorsing leaving camp there unattended.
---
Lol been there
---
It's 25%. 
---
honestly every time I always forget to swap back my stealth perks
---
I‚Äôve had stuff like this happen in the past. 
---
I was stuck w/miner miracles and couldnt take
---
Out the pit boss in the lab.
---
Took me 4 or 5 tries till I met some
---
Random lvl 190 guy farming for mats. He helped me through it easy peasy even dropped me mats to finish 
---
I think they‚Äôre already doing that. Events? Are coop. Whether you choose to team up or solo is on us.
---
Humans made him. Now we must pay caps for our arrogance!
---
Glassed Caverns? 
---
I play on PC with a controller too, it turns out the PTT does work but the keyboard button wasn't what I thought it was, it was "Backspace"
---
the easiest fix make f76 a traditional Beth game with optional coop, like f4 or NV which had really cool elements such as dialog choices, karma system weapon degradation and overall really good games !
---
When someone complain something is too expensive and still buying it, he's a moron... No one force anyone to buy anything and Rad shield is, as far as I know, the best item to raise radiation resistance, which also mean the most difficult to get (craft). If someone doesn't want to buy for you price (which I think is more than sensible for the time you spend to find that strangler pods), the why he bother you?
---
As for berry mentats, for me at least, they aren't more valuable than the price vendor give you (15-20 caps) - I have many of them in my stash found in the world.
---
Can confirm, me and Jon are besties.
---
Okay, maybe not, but I'm a mod on /r/manyatruenerd and a fairly well known community member.
---
I was being sarcastic because I think OP is being nit picky and we already get enough resources from what is already there, but the idea of a perk isn't terrible.
---
CAN ANYBODY ACTUALLY CONFIRM IF THEY HAVE GOT BOS PLANS FROM SCRAPPING?!? 
---
I have an SSD and it doesnt take 30 seconds to load in
---
When did you get them from breaking down? Was this after the latest patch?
---
At the moment I'm at work, but if you interested in that clean white suit just pm me what is it worth to you and what you want to pay for it and I'm sure we can make a little deal :) 
---
churr cuzzie
---
Not lamps...l√§mps
---
50 radshields,200 stimpacks,80 radaway,20berry mentats,20fury,20 psychotats.
---
I try to keep stimpacks and radaway low but i do many events and so i always have too many. I find myself dropping them to newbs or selling them.
---
*facepalm*
---
This isn't about /remembering/ to crouch and blaming whoever forgot.
---
It's about admitting we don't do it all the time. 
---
Now, if your ego can't take admitting it, or if you want to live in a fantasy that you crouch all the time, that's just you being dishonest with yourself. Sure, go ahead. But some people would rather be honest about it, and engineer around this imperfect reality.
---
You don't crouch all the time. Even if you're in the habit, you still only crouch most of the time. And sometimes you just don't bother. 
---
And it's about protecting you in those times that this conversation is about.
---
These type of stories are more rare now a days with the increase of Griefers.
---
Is it a platform-only camp behind the golf club with turrets deliberately aimed into the windows?  No.  It's an awesome camp, in a decisively awesome place.  They have nothing to worry about.
---
I'm sorry br√∂ther, please forgive me
---
If your turret kills something, you don't get the XP for it.  Nobody does.  Same goes for loot.
---
On consoles it can be done easily by pressing and holding one of the directional buttons. Then a round menu pops up with perk card presets.
---
Same idea for PC.
---
No need to prepare now. 1 or2 run of whitespring and you're submerged in 1 star trash.
---
The thing is, they aren't *stealing* XP.  They are voiding out the XP completely.  If one of their turrets makes a kill, nobody gets the XP, and nobody gets the loot.
---
It's a pointless, and misguided "strategy".
---
Where are they in the power plant?
---
Literally what their doing with the new survival mode. As I understand it, all the changes in that mode are directly catering to the PVP crowd.
---
Human flesh is NOT an acceptable tender.
---
... or maybe yes.
---
I‚Äôm not bothering with the event anymore. Havent beaten it since patch, went through 2k ammo and broke all my weapons only to fail (again) with a a group of about 10-12 ppl. The 2 flux aint worth it
---
I've been thinking of returning too, especially with the new roadmap announced. 
---
It fixed it for me, just doesnt show in the pip boy
---
See you in a year's time. Don't say us 'EA naysayers' didn't warn you. I lost faith in them after Generals II was cancelled close to completion.
---
Enjoy your constant loading screens mate.
---
Nah. 
---
Just use Discord.
---
If it makes you feel more secure, a newly lvl50 probably has a half assed build and crap gear.  We had mote time to refine everything.
---
Prestige won't be anything op or crazy,mark my words.
---
It will probably unlocks some cosmetics or flair for your name.
---
Don't expect akimbo guns and double jumps.
---
Thx, but i'm probably not going to be end-gaming a lot. I'm really just a casual looking for an "easy" build to mash though some scorched quickly without to much trouble.
---
What power plant?
---
im only keeping the three star trash
---
I've tried to farm it myself, but no luck so far - I bought brown for 5k, blue for 6k, green for 8k and pink for 12k. Still need Yellow, Red and Forest to finish my collection - if anyone on PC and want's to sell any of these for caps let me know.
---
Usually near the reactor, inside the main building.
---
Was excited, loaded it up again today for first time this month.
---
Crashed at login. loaded in and was by camp, loaded map and menu to check daily challenges. froze, crashed to desktop.
---
Logged back in, still by camp, froze for 10-20 secs at a time, crashed to desktop within 1.5 mins.
---
logged in, ran from camp, no problems, approached camp, froze, crashed to desktop.
---
rebooted. logged in, was able to play for a bit, got stuff from camp, and sold stuff at nearby vendor. traveled to the resort to sell stuff and harvest rhodendrons. crashed to desktop when loading stash inside the craft area.
---
gave up.
---
Yeah‚Ä¶ bethesda should fix this. Treasure hunting should be profitable, not a waste of time on junk and ammo.
---
I'm not following any build or anything but I have almost the exact same build ,except I'm only like lvl 40 bc of play time constraints. I like what you've done and I'm probably gonna keep this in mind going forward
---
Thanks. I started to go inside and when I saw Super mutants I ran back out l o l
---
My most fun experience so far was when I had a 1v3 in the order of mysteries secret base. They had chased my inside the building, but they didn't have access to the bunker. So I kept opening the door and taking pot shots at them. Grenades and bullets were flying back and forth down the hallway in a clear stalemate until one lucky grenade cut my life short. These moments are what stand out the most for me. That's why I'm eager for the new survival mode.
---
Locker room downstairs of golf club or top of world train station outside under skeleton on two suitcases. Kinda like bos hood spawn (chance for it not static)
---
Blackwater might be better then, just go from the sides and sneak past the mole miners
---
The point about the stash box is very, very good. Maybe someone with technical knowledge can say if it‚Äôs correct.
---
For those not watched it‚Äôs basically this: if the Stash limit is to limit pressure on servers then it should not be done be weight.
---
16,000 steel is 800lbs, but all the server needs to track is steel + the number, it doesn‚Äôt need to track each steel individually.
---
On the other side a weapon in you stash can have a number of mods, which the game has to track individually thus surely is more pressure on the server.
---
His solution, there are 40 crafting components, they should not count towards stash weight.
---
If you wanna hold a workshop, you best be willing to fight for that workshop
---
They're PvP based grounds for a reason, thou who controls the resources controls the trade
---
I remember the spot in the golf club! It once spawned a clean space helmet for me. I need to remember to check it once in a while. Thanks for the tip!
---
Cool thanks
---
?
---
 F3 has great world and best post-apo cliamte of ALL Falout games. Don't know what is funny about that, many Fallout fans consider F3 best of franchise.  It is definately more interesting than desert walking simulator with generic towns aka New Vegas.
---
I‚Äôve loading in and hear those ghouls and their attacking sounds. After a second watch my health lower and then there‚Äôs my hammer. I start swinging at the air and can hear the hits and when everything is loaded in half the mob is dead at my feet. 
---
I‚Äôve also loaded in and been attacked by cowardly players also, that pisses me off. I normally wait and then look at the moron, give the question emote before kindly ending them. Lol.
---
Nuke zones are the best though, nothing like hearing the rads clicking madly away, seeing your tads go up to load in finally and die. LOVE IT.
---
This is why I‚Äôve trained myself against this bug by dumping everything and getting into my power armor before leaving the game. Needs to be fixed though.
---
Mabye he just needed a place to rest while he was sick.
---
Poseidon the one near Charleston.
---
There's already a mod for this on the Nexus. So long as Bethesda doesn't find any bugs in it, which let's face it they've never found a bug the first time...ever, they will have a headstart on development. It's a great mod and should be part of the game.
---
People do not team up for events, because they are scared to get their base trashed. This results in competition for loot, which in return entices pvp.
---
&gt; Normal attention span is like 45 minutes, which is why most lectures are limited to that time or have a break at that point.
---
So he should have made:
---
* Fallout 76 - What Went Wrong &amp; How To Fix It: Part 1
---
* Fallout 76 - What Went Wrong &amp; How To Fix It: Part 2
---
* Fallout 76 - What Went Wrong &amp; How To Fix It: Part 3
---
because people are too stupid to use the Youtube pause feature?
---
It's *just* viable, but I got frustrated by it in the late game to the point where I switched to other weapons, because it's rather sub-optimal and with enemies as bullet-spongey as they are it cuts down on grind to *not* use a pistol build. 
---
I don't think you should be scrapping weapons to look for a specific mod in the first place. That's insane nonsense.
---
I sell everything as quickly as possible and go minamslist with maybe 30 diluted radx's, stimpacks, and rad aways.
---
Not enough to make it worth the extra nuke launches and hrs farming for flux and ingredients to make pure flux üëç
---
I was dropping the f bomb in like 2nd grade. 
---
Are Michigan Elementry schools just that advanced? I he was r we are fairly well known for being potty mouth champions, but no never really believed it 
---
Not explicitly, personally I just use it as a private comms channel between friends
---
Claire is sworn to carry my burdens.
---
Pretty much everyone gets caught once.  I did the same thing when I started with a workshop safe.  It warned me that I would be flagged AFTER I had picked the lock.  Tin foil hat theory is that Bethesda is really trying to push pvp on people who don't want it.
---
No problem. Thanks for the silver! 
---
Okay, well I can‚Äôt argue with that. Although if he was innocent surely we would have heard something about it by now right. But the guy and Bethesda have on strangely silent. 
---
Also thank you üôè for replying to me again I do love üíñ the attention. 
---
Neat camp!
---
I have seen many people say they learned it from scrapping, but it never shows up in the modding list. Instead, they actually learned the bos combat helmet paint.
---
I have only found one plan since the patch, it was on the amor work bench in the penitentiary. Apparently according to the game files, the plans are only available in the toxic valley up north.
---
How does using discord alleviate the lack of an in-game text chat, especially when trying to chat with the other 31~ players per server that typically don't know each other at all, let alone outside of the game.
---
I don't want other players in my game at all. Give me private servers, let anyone play their way.
---
Finally have a place for my Two Shot Laser Rifle
---
Gary?
---
The fact that a multiplayer game released in 2019 doesn't have something as simple as text chat is mind-boggling. I've barely played since beta and this is one of the reasons why. This isn't new technology, Bethesda.
---
Can‚Äôt you use the voice com that are part of the game?
---
Especially since you can typically use keyboards to chat in most games nowadays across both XB1 and PS4.
---
Or when you fast travel to the golf club and you walk inside and the ghouls start attacking you invisibly
---
removed.. oof
---
I'm afraid you require too much - highly doubt it. Although I don't conceal that I would like such a feature myself.
---
Same with my Gatling. It broke, repaired, and broke again when I fast traveled to Watoga. 
---
&gt;what do you get out of smashing another person's camp?
---
Fun.
---
In tandem with this could a fix/preventative measure be implemented for logging into nuke zones without hazmat/pa?
---
I know I know "nevar log out at Whitespring without your power armor!!1" but it can happen, especially if you crash.
---
Even if it just auto-moves you to Vault76 or something like that
---
TWENTY caps? More like two...
---
Super Mutant Suicider super saiyan form.
---
I wanted to exaggerate little bit.
---
We are gonna need a bigger door....
---
Are you being serious? I can't tell.
---
Executioner‚Äôs hunter‚Äôs nocturnal mutant‚Äôs zealot‚Äôs lead pipe
---
Probably not :/ I found a two shot grenade launcher yesterday and it killed me a lot... But could just be me and I suck. Who knows , try yours maybe you like it
---
Agreed.  Last night I had some dick who 40-50 levels above me, in PA, following me around, beating on me like a rented mule while I was going about my business of taking out groovy ghoulies at Whitespring.  I thought he would flag and become wanted, but it didn't happen.  He clearly was not accidentally doing this, he jumped up on top of a bus to whack on me with his hammer.
---
I have no interest in PVP; it's fine if you want to do it, but that doesn't mean I want to be part of it and I shouldn't have to put up with people being jerks.
---
It's more of a PackRat problem...side effect of server and event grinding...see a stim, grab a stim. I have Healing Factor so I don't even need but like 12 stims a day fighting the Queen...I have issues :(
---
This BGS. Occam's Razor points towards it being a bug. The other explainations are much more convoluted given the evidence and common experience; e.g., health bars and monsters do not completely freeze at 90% under sustained attack.
---
Best legendary I recently got was a powered assassin‚Äôs trapper chestpiece. Other than that the only legendary I‚Äôve ever got that was worth keeping was a TSE lever action, but I sold that shit after the nerf
---
Probably the biggest reasons I stopped playing is because I don't like the softcore survival and the game was feeling like junk hunting 24/7. I was more focused on what junk I needed than the quests and I hated it. Managing my delicate stash box (yes they've since upped the capacity) wasn't fun. I've never been able to just stop playing a Fallout game cold turkey until 76 came along.
---
Do you use travelling pharmacist? Yes I presume?
---
Forgot to thank you guys and Girls, yet another great SBQ fight, it always end well together with you guys, i really enjoy it.
---
They usually happen around 4-5 in the morning my time, so always have to hit the sack straight after, lol :D
---
Good thing i am retired and dont need to think about the clock to much, lol
---
Been experimenting with a Gatling plasma (Zalots, 1 shot explosive, 90% wight) the last two fight, holdes up pretty good, can do about 10 cores before it breaks ;)
---
I use PS4 and it some times takes longer than 30 seconds to load. I ran around for a good whole minute yesterday waiting for everything to load. 
---
If people wanted to fucking be your friend and watch you spam dumb bullshit in chat, they would have already joined your Discord.
---
Reminds me of the time I was watching a nuke drop and my place was just on the edge. And while I was watching a dead Scorch Beast fell on my roof. 
---
Seriousness. GT BLUNTERNOTE571. I'll be online in about an hour if anyone wants to see my sad life of picking up all the things I don't need.
---
As long as it's on Xbox and ps4 as well I'm down
---
Thx for the Feedback and updoots!
---
I really appreciate!!!
---
It'll be interesting to see how they'll implement this.
---
If it's just rerolling the legendary attributes, it'll be the weapon type that will be important.
---
If it's a "transmogrification" process, where you add 2-3 legendary 3* items (random or the same type) to get a 3* item (random or the same type), it'll be the quantity of legendaries that will be important.
---
I don't farm places like Whitesprings so I'm not getting an enormous amount of legendary drops. For now I'm saving the lvl 50 2-3* items I get.
---
How do you carry that much? And why? I'm interested.. 
---
So I've worked out how to avoid this but it's not ideal;
---
It depends on the vertical angle you shoot it at (how high up or down). If you imagine a line extending from your eyes parallel to the ground, shoot the fatman *above* this line.
---
If you shoot below it, for whatever reason the projectile after it splits up will position itself directly onto the origin of your character instead.
---
I believe the broadsider also has this issue.
---
Thanks for looking into it - I‚Äôve ended up 95% full of rads loading in to a server into a nuked zone and had to f4 the second I finally loaded and saw how bad it was - and my friend has ended up dead on load from the same. Just needs some sort of immunity until fully loaded if possible!

This is what I run with. I used to run melee perks I could swap out with the weight reduction and carry weight perks until I was able to craft ridiculous amounts of ammunition 
---
There aint no remake coming, there is a group of modders trying to redo fallout 3 on a fallout 4 mod but as bethesda isnt allowing them to use the original voice set they have to ask people to get new voices so its gonna take quite long till we see anything about this.
---
It‚Äôs a nice design, but I had a simpler solution. Add a balcony to the roof and use the mesh flooring for it. You can shoot through it and you can get directly over the mutts chewing on the walls and get a clear line of sight 360 degrees.
---
I like it simply for the repair cost.
---
He has so many good points, wonder if anything he said will happen
---
Half the guns in the game are bugged. It's a shit show.
---
I believe no. 2 - pretty much all smaller groups have failed to kill her this weekend when they could prior to the patch.  If she is scaling to 24 people, I'm not going to bother anymore, this is just a total waste of resources (unless you want to focus on the adds, which gives tons of XP).
---
Also saw a twice healing queen last night and she didn't fly off after the event was over either.  The whole Scorched Earth event seems mighty broken after the patch.  A big group of trained SBQ slayers assuming the server is working right is the only circumstance left that merits bothering with the fight.  I believe one of the servers I was on had the event broadcast via Discord and got enough firepower that the fight wasn't a total waste.
---
Even if you don't keep it actively equipped it reduces the cost to repair armor
---
This is certainly true, I definitely take your point. For me though, I'm a total sucker four walls I can peek over and hunker down behind. And, honestly, over-designed structures.
---
Not that simple though.  The obvious issue is for hearing impaired players to have a "voice".  In my case - when I'm on conference calls "working" - it's nice to have a way to say something.
---
Now - if they had some better emotes, that would go a long way to solving this issue.  Seems that would be quite the EASY option (can they hear me screaming this?)
---
One of the first things I said was "store your scrap."  Dying is completely inconsequential in this game.  If you start heading east and don't act like a weenie, you'll power level in no time.
---
Uhhhhhhhhhh yeah
---
Currently yes but i'm bringing it down to 1 star as soon as i find the 3rd  armor with food,chem reduction.
---
That depends how the game handles items. When do they get generated as actual ingame objects? It's quite possible that while in your stash they still exist as actual objects with individual positions, skins, rotations, etc to stop the server chugging when moving massive amounts of items from the inventory list to the game world. This would also explain loot delay issues like it taking 3-5 minutes for mob loot to appear in the list.
---
**If** this is the case then it is very unlikely that any loot exists in any database as just a single line with a 'quantity' value next to it. Now, the difference between mundane items being handled like this and weapons/armour being handled like this is still there, steel still doesn't have lots of the values a pipe pistol does. But it is nowhere near the same as a single line vs one line per item.
---
If the premise that components are stored as a single line is correct then the theory behind having a separate 'Component Tab' is technically sound.
---
That explains why I switch to fists when I'm expecting an easy swap to my vampire gun
---
OH I know where that is, now. Thank You
---
To farm plastic, visit Ohio River Adventures near the Nuka plant.
---
There are lots of lifesavers and golf balls there.  Tons of plastic and only three ghouls to contend with.
---
Like I said, all approx. I can give exact totals when I get online. I have packrat 3 (for collecting junk when I want to) traveling pharmacy 3 and tru hiker 3 equipped at all times. Plus FDC reducing armor (doesn't help much because there is a weight redux limit).
---
 Level 217? Unless I'm off by 1 or 2...I stopped tracking a while back. I server hop almost endlessly looking for events and there is always a voice that says... pick that up. 
---
So I'm guessing you're saying that if you dilute radaway then you can have more of them per radaway?
---
No u
---
Genius.
---
Yeah I know that I'm speaking more to it preserving your armor as a character getting hit a lot, I find early on my armor breaking quickly but could just be on low level and take more beating at the moment
---
Yeah I have issues with over designing too, or maybe it‚Äôs just overdoing it. This is my last camp.  I got tired of holes in the walls. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/gFyWBwI
---
Thanks.  Makes sense, I just hadn't seen it before.
---
Damn, puttin' in work. I dig it! I think this game gained so much in terms of longevity simply by including this Camp system.
---
Seriously there should always be a way to have text in game options even if just for 508 compliance. I know games don't need to meet these standards but the emotes don't really cut it for the hard of hearing crowd. 
---
This sounds awfully like something I've seen myself; so I need to ask do you have your pagefile disabled? I learned myself that '76 gets reaaaal unstable without a page file
---
That's what everybody keeps fucking telling me.
---
Quite rare - rarer than brown, blue and green, less rare than pink and red. BTW, if you're on PC I can buy it from you for 8k.
---
&gt;In my case - when I'm on conference calls "working" - it's nice to have a way to say something.
---
Discord... ? Reddit chat? Facebook Messenger? We're in a world where we have like 500000+ options for text chat. Discord is the most widely used, and even has an overlay. It's wasteful for them to implement a text chat and have yet ANOTHER chat. Discord works fine for me.... 
---
Thank you for the info. Sadly I‚Äôm on PS4. 
---
I prefer to use 'Lucky Break'.
---
I wonder why.
---
NV had pretty good fallouty writing, but you could tell a mile away Obsidian were just not very experienced with large open worlds. 
---
I was considering that too, so you've used both and found lucky break more helpful?
---
The T51b calibrated shocks mod has been rarer to me than the X01 calibrated shocks mod. To this date I haven't found a single one.
---
Not having found the plans for the T51b left and right leg doesn't help either. If I'm going to apply the rares damn mod on the planet I better damn well have it on crafted armor with the durability as high as humanly possible.
---
Yeap.  Its bothersome.
---
Ahh hopefully someone else will answer your question then. I live in my power armor so I have no idea how well white knight works lol
---
Where did you buy it from? A vendor? Like someone sold it to the vendor or something (I know they can be found at Fort Defiance)
---
Should've said you had to pay to get rid of them, then üòâ
---
Now we know why it's called EXPERIMENTAL MIRV, cus they're still experimenting with it lol and we are the test subjects.
---
I bought it from another player.
---
I died once because of this. Kind of annoying. 
---
Oh okay got ya. 
---
If you're loaded up on avoidance (Lone Wanderer, someone in your party is sharing Empath, Serendipity/Emergency-Protocols, Dodgy, etc)  - then no, it's totally unnecessary.  
---
If you intend to let your armor take the full punishment being delivered, then yes (but then you have a bigger problem of it also probably hurting not only your armor but you as well). 
---
That Nocturnal Walking Cane isn't going to loot itself...
---
I‚Äôve used both lucky break and white knight extensively. As a player who only wears power armor in nuke zones, white knight is invaluable. The issue with lucky break is it‚Äôs random and doesn‚Äôt proc often enough to keep your stuff from breaking. If you got the card in a perk pack, use it, but if you‚Äôre choosing, I‚Äôd pick white knight every time.
---
YES I HAVE DONE THIS MYSELF I SCRAPPED SOME RANDOM HEAVY COMBAT ARMOR AND IT POPPED UP SAYING CRAFTING ITEM UNLOCKED: BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL.
---
Ah thank you this is what I was looking for, someone with field experience üòÅüëç
---
Just making sure to reply to the only person I feel like needs to read my take on it : I don't want the game to be harder. I play to wind down after a long day. I have 3 kids. I just want to explore and relax in this world. Making it harder, more stressful and more specialized will hurt my experience. I don't want to PvP. I don't want to invest hours to min/max. I don't want to have to plan stuff weeks in advance. I just want to play, have fun, just like I do now. Thanks! üòç
---
I'm grateful for anyone that helps. I even help others. Stimpacks should help anyone group or not. I had someone help me out to get Grant Sabre for my quest. I thanked the lv 150 that group up with me and my friend so we can get to it. White springs sucks when it responds in a few minutes. It crazy ass stupid there. I haven't had any problems with griefers. When I take a work shop I leave everything open i don't lock any thing. 
---
300 Armor doesn't cut your damage to 0 if it's under 200, although it might feel like 0.  400 armor would reduce 200 damage to around 39% of it's displayed, which for melee builds would still be plenty depending on the build.  For you to be doing 0 damage, or what amounts to it, not only would Issue 2 have to be the case, but the scaling would have to either greatly buff her HP pool so that \~39% of 200 is practically 0 damage, or that she gains damage reduction that scales based on # of players, and applies after basic armor.
---
Oh and as far as melee having the highest armor piercing, before legendary effects, it does, but it depends on the weapon.  Rifle with a Perforating Magazine can get to 76% with tank killer(which seems like a way too ironic number IMO), which is higher(if only by 1%) than Incisor 3; however, since certain melee weapons have acess to Puncturing mods, they can go above 76% when used with said mods.
---
And since the increased DPH from an Anti Armor Baseball Bat, isn't that much higher than it is with Puncturing Baseball Bat, if using a melee weapon that has a Puncturing mod and you have Incisor 3, you'd be better off getting a Legendary effect that ups damage by a %(personally I prefer Furious for SBQ), instead of Anti Armor.  However, if using a weapon that doesn't have a Puncturing mod, then Anti Armor is still better.
---
needs more tuba
---
Hey looks good. Some quick thoughts. The lcokpocking and hacker perks are situational. Best thing to do is place them only when you need them. This will give you some extra slots for new cards. Also, most people consider one star in each damage perk (gladiator, rifleman etc) to be enough. The thinking is if you get one star in each rank (gladiator, master gladiator, expert gladiator) that will be 30% for three perk pints. With them fully ranked up it‚Äôs only 60% for nine points. 
---
Instead of say.. Steam?   I like steam because its easy and already installed on my machine without needing another server.
---
That's ridiculous, isn't the fact you can't carry any junk a massive burden?
---
I've seen a Flatwoods Monster in the beta in the Forest, on a mountain hill getting closer to the Toxic Valley. First time seeing it, we let the turrets of our camp do the work, but then we decided to get closer and he vanished, and thus we didn't kill him. Should've let the turrets do the work for us while he floated like a floating vegetable.
---
Don't you know?  Repec is not a utility in FO76, its End-Game!
---
That's why you get cards/point-moves after level 50.  It will just take you 20+ levels to finish is all.
---
I had same issue and now into my 15th level of respeccing.  (currently level 130)
---
Not at all, it takes easily 100/200 hrs before you might starting finding yourself grinding
---
Iv tried a bunch of times and only seen the dirty white version :(
---
I disabled page file. But it works fine before patch 6.
---
Yeap, I now double-check everything when I head out.  Set my preferred grenade, then double-check my weapons, then use the D-pad to switch back and forth just to be certain.
---
Swearing is part of it, too.
---
Last night I got one of the BOS combat armor mods from scrapping lvl 20 light combat armor arms.
---
Previously I've gotten combat armor chest and leg mods from scrapping arms, so the level and type of combat armor does not seem to affect the outcome.
---
i shot a level 1 radroach with a tse dragon sneak attack‚Ä¶
---
Oh yeah. I walked into one of those. Ouch, but also hey, free caps!
---
Man I was hoping this post would have some answers when I checked back. Guess I need to learn the static spawns locations for plans in toxic valley and start searching. üò¢ 
---
1.PC
---
2.Bathesda.net account - IHBM
---
3.Some screenshoots for proof - https://imgur.com/a/OeHW3pA
---
4.The problems are too many
---
 4.1.Weekly challenge is not working correctly. Look first screenshot. Already kill everything in the list but no give atoms.
---
 4.2.I can use painted power armor. Every time when I paint my PA ,show this message from second screenshot and I can drop and use my armor. Others players can do this but I cant. Why? is there any particular attitude or restriction imposed on my account specifically.
---
 4.3.Today for some reason my good 3*weapon is dropped on the ground from my inventory and I didn't drop anything on the ground. I've already lost three good weapons this way. it's super irritating to lose my good weapons in this way when the game gives you only  junk.
---
I spent 550 hours in the game and for that time I did not find any good weapons and armors( only 1,2 or 3* legendary junk). For that time in any other game  I can find and unlock everything. Only in Fallout76 this is clearly impossible. After patch 5 when I kill 3* legendary enemy I always get 1* legendary junk ( and I killed 100 or even more 3* enemy). Probably another restriction on my account.
---
Quit that, you cannot bring logic into this!
---
What do you need it for? It's always been something I have excess of and sell
---
I rarely ever use grenades. Just often enough to get me killed apparently üòÇ
---
This. I speak to people all the time on pc. Especially when I make friends
---
I rarely use PA. Only when fighting the SBQ. Orherwise regular armor with one point each into white knight and lucky break. Incredibly easy to maintain armor just like that. 
---
Damn. I hadn‚Äôt really considered that. I just saw damage and thought ‚Äúmust have.‚Äù  Thank you very much for your feedback. 
---
You cant hide/sneak/evade scorchbeasts. At least that is my experience. They also use sonar which kind of makes sense. Except they still attack me when I am inside a building or structure. Scorchbeasts are a total ammo sink for me because I depend on sneak modifiers. Otherwise I do shite damage.
---
You buy a ticket and a sentry bot "gently" places you in a small crate.
---
That first set of excavator armour. I think it requires black titanium, and I'm such a noob that I have none, and I have no clue where to look. I'd rather just buy it at this rate lmao
---
wait can i make a camp out of commie whackers?
---
I encountered a Vengeful Mothman at Whitespring golf course entrance after a scorchbeast died to the robots, I lured a second one from the nearby fissure site to this spot and helped the robots kill it. And then during that fight the Mothman showed up and he wasn't friendly either, killed me first with focusing on the scorchbeast and then I respawned and high tailed it to finish the scorchbeast and then focus on the Mothman to fight, and the robots didn't care. So it was a one-on-one fight. Me, a level 36 vs a level 46 Vengeful Mothman. After blackpowder rifle ammo use, LMG depleted, and daring up close strikes with the fire axe and in power armor, I took him down, only for him to disappear into ashes, and got a level 40 flamer from him, so that is nice with the increased stash size. I was quite content tonight, first time visit to the Whitespring.
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **1st Cakeday** AsianMoocowFromSpace! ^(hug)
---
I got an almost identical gun from a legendary in Watoga. I was initially going to sell it to the vendor for 30 caps, but because it said 2 shot hardened sniper combat rifle, I decided to give it a silencer and try it out. 
---
It‚Äôs a good little gun!  If I vats the targets in the face it does wonders because of the 33 fire rate. Super mutants below level 40 are one shot kills and below 68 are 2 shots. Level 68 takes 3 shots. 
---
Thank you for sharing this. I‚Äôm halfway through the video but I wanted to stop and say this is one of the most well thought out review videos I‚Äôve ever seen. As a huge Bethesda/Fallout fan, I really want them to get this right (I finally started playing 76 a couple weeks ago, after waiting for fixes and stalking this sub). I‚Äôm glad to see such pure effort and research along with a no-nonsense style that is also non-confrontational.
---
My group get this about every night. What we started doing is let the first one appear move away then the next one so on and so on. The one that is invisible goes back out and comes back in. You can actually see there avatar stuck in the other side sometimes. Try doing this when your group is under attack from 2 SB and you can't see team mates dying. Fix this problem ...... 
---
Every patch breaks more than it fixes.  I mean I've been running into an issue where locations that can have either ghouls or robots, have the ghouls spawn with the death and "when damaged" effects of the other.  So the ghouls are catching fire from taking to much damage and self destructing like legendary robots, even if they weren't legendary ghouls.
---
Well, to be fair, you are using psychic powers to make it float around. That cant be super accurate 
---
Remember armor piercing is not additive. 
---
Me also saying weapons under 200 damage do 0 damage was more so a figure out speech. Everyones rolling around with minimum damage because of no adrenaline reaction. Which means her armor is much more effective for players who have no idea armor piercing is relevant and are still using standard weapons at like lvl's 50-100. If shes scaling the way i believe, players wont have the damage to even finish the event. 
---
Do yourself a favour and just try it, I had exactly the issues you describe because I disabled the page file
---
I agree!!! Many of us dont even have headsets hooked up so when someone comes up and tries to talk with me I feel bad because I dont have a way handy right there to talk back. If we had chat I could do that quickly and not be a douche for not talking back to people....
---
I had one match right off the side of the big bridge, just kept on walking across open air. Kinda cool. 
---
ALL colored uniforms spawn on the third floor of fort defiance on the bunk beds and on the bench in the showers. I don't even look through the rest of the fort now that I have all the hats. Just go to third floor, check the two rooms and the shower and move on. Also, if you don't want to server hop for it, the spawn resets about once an hour while you're on a server so you can go back and check periodically. 
---
It also does that if you get in or out of power armor.. "oh, cool! my second weapon is now unequipped, and I am getting my ass beat while going in to re-equip it.. great!"
---
I'm not sure why you've put Discord is quotation marks. It's easily the best voice/chat service of all time. Put's skype, Aim, teamspeak, etc. all to shame. 
---
I guess to answer you, Discord is the name of the Program that offers a much better application than any of these other aformentioned services. They have a wonderful mobile app, and you should probably be using it for all of your games. It's much better than relying on any in game chat services. 
---
No, Steam has terrible support for multi-person voice chat. Discord is leagues ahead. I consider them completely different applications.
---
Steam is a library/store/platform for games.
---
Discord is an IM and group VOIP application designed for gamers.
---
that why we need adventure mode and survival mode to make everyone happy 
---
No. Voice com for most games is pretty terrible imo. Discord put's them all in one place with stability and a great mobile app.
---
How? Where? I need one serum but IDK where to ask or who to ask 
---
I've taken her down every time since patch but I play a heavy gunner build and turn up with 10-12 fully repaired heavy guns and thousands of rounds of ammo. I leave with no ammo and all my guns broken. One thing I have noticed is that Gatling plasma seems to do a noticeably larger amount of damage to her than most guns. 
---
Maybe it is because you can just keep it trained on her firing thousands of rounds that lets you see her health visibly drain. It really does seem to work better than any other gun though. I do agree that adrenaline doesn't seem to have much effect though.
---
I don't have anti armour plasma but it seems to work just fine. I have a vampires one with renders me invincible whilst I fire though :)
---
If it's 2 Shot, Instigating, or Furious, then yes, they are still sought after.
---
If it is, and you're on Xbox, hit me up, and I'll make you a good trade deal.
---
Also there are Mutant Suiciders, they are called something else though.   Not carrying a mini-nuke but a small bomb.
---
There are also molerats with bombs attached to them.
---
Love stories like this! There are a ton of great players in game, far out weigh the bad for sure. I died out of stupidity at Whitesprings a few days back with tons of crafting stuff on me because I was getting ready to craft ammo. Some azzhat came right over and took it all even though I came right back in and ran right back over to get it..
---
I see.  Never used Discord, so was not aware.
---
same here.I have a screenshot to prove
---
War, war never changes.
---
Don't quote me, but I think it's a guaranteed drop from deathclaws? About 4-8 each time.
---
Drifter + Pirate hat, fits my Raider Preston Garvey character. 
---
I agree put the hardcore PVP players on another server completely.... 
---
Why do you keep posting the same thing?
---
Didnt say it was comfortable.
---
Yes they do, thxs to the power of RUGS! Tho you have to close the door to use the weapons bench.
---
Please no, chat timers are aids 
---
thxs
---
yes. the old default door on your camp can be shot through, with limitations. (there is holes in the door's glass) i think you can shoot through the Iron Security door's top window.
---
There are other recipes that have a more efficient return.  
---
Yea... Use steam... the application that takes an entire minute to load. Hit's you with pop ups on "whats new!" in their store, overall extremely clunky design and difficult management tools for keeping up with who's who. 
---
Discord on the other hand takes all of 1mb of RAM usage, extremely lightweight, has a flawless mobile app and UI, exceptional tools for management of friends and your own servers.  
---
I wish i knew as well especially the posting nuke codes that aint an exploit you cant even launch one with out doing the enclave quest
---
Only when I want to pick up junk. Most days I am just farming events and only need a little junk to repair my armour and weapon. If I want to do a VENDOR run for caps I get super fat with the garbage, bulk it and sell as I slow walk killing everything that approaches me.
---
Sadly didn't have room, was trying to build the smallest bunkier that was also functional, so thxs to the work benches I was pushed up to a 2x2. You could replace the rec room {Throwing darts and a guitar} with shelfs I guess...
---
It actually is! Only thing it can not withstand is a direct Nuke hit.
---
If you need an un-nerfed TSE weapon to enjoy the game, then the game won't keep you entertained long even with it. Best cut your losses and move on. 
---
From a lore/realism sense, it's completely reasonable. As you are working on a piece of leather armor, you think "hm. I bet if I stiched this with a little extra leather this way, it will be even stronger"
---
Yes!
---
I think the T51b ones are sold by Greg in Grafton.   Many don't go up there and check him out all the often.
---
From raiding people workshops while they were doing the defend the workshop mission. Kill the player for caps, kill the mobs for plans......
---
You *walk* around to all the vendors?!
---
Can definitely recommend it!
---
this is a really good update, thanks for the hard work! of course with every update comes bugs, which cant be helped, please review player comments so you can make sure they get fixed asap
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 81 and west tek is a damn good place to get my fool head shot off. I usually have to move camp into the rocks above it. And run back and forth because clearing that lab with an All Rise is hard. 
---
Is a bot. Should Ban.
---
Yea, it's how I enter my bunker. Tho I think explaining it would get me banned from this reddit.....
---
thanks for tagging them. i hope they speed up the qol patching and implement npcs that show we are repopilating abit and carvans!! also increase cap limit on caravns to a random number above 400
---
Micro my friend is more marketable tho
---
I'm not sure why the positive effect of adrenaline reaction is not showing up after the patch, but it still works. It kicks in under %60 health now and is just about as strong as it used to be under %20.
---
Also the Quad Combat Shotgun has only 36 shells in Magazin instead of 48. With the big mag it has standard 12 shells. 12x4= 48 not 36 lol 
---
I do this run daily: Flatwoods (Responder), Sutton (Raider), The Whitespring, Enclave Bunker (Enclave) and also get Technical Data, Harper's Ferry (Free States), Camp Venture to drop off Technical Data, Watoga Super Duper Mart (BoS), Watoga Rail (unique).
---
I mix in a few stops to check for plans along the way too.
---
Monorail
---
TBH - I'm getting tired - the bug fixes are introducing new bugs - Scorched Earth/SBQ is a total mess now after the last patch, favorites for same weapons in inventory is still broken from patch 5 that broke it, bulk junk is still being scrapped by scrap all.  Before all that new content comes out, they really need to fix and address all the QOL issues and bugs.
---
Energy weapons break too quickly, balance changes have been 90% nerfs, etc.  No shared stash to transfer between characters.  Stash size is still too small without transfer ability.  Etc etc etc.  Workshop exploits to enable PvP elsewhere is still in game.  Some perks really need to be made passive.  Where's that loadout manager for perks?
---
I'm peacing out and taking it slow now - need a respite from Bugthesda!  Not giving up - but I'm just worn down by all the constant bugs and QOL issues.
---
Oh right yeh I do have that. How is it bugged? 
---
Where‚Äôs the tech data at the bunker?
---
Twice yesterday, I was disconnected immediately after killing the SBQ, 1st time I got the reward, but did not yet loot the Queen, 2nd time it crashed when she hit the ground.
---
It's very disheartening to waste so much ammo, and get absolutely nothing in return.
---
Actually, it's player vs player. It would be wrong to not allow the players the tools they usually have access too just because they've decided to engage in fighting amongst themselves. Teams should be allowed in PvP.
---
That being said, it's not very nice of them.
---
Military wing's desks
---
This was back in December.
---
Ah thanks!
---
Such as ? 
---
Are you melee or gun build? I never had any trouble maintaining armor using primarily rifles but new melee character has to tank a lot more
---
You're replying to a bot..  
---
Are you out of your mind? You should be banned for not using you brain correctly.
---
For the right ammo... I think it is. With power user you can get 1000 shots out of a fusion core. For the amount of flux you use to make the cores, gatling lasers are most efficient prime weapon. 
---
You can shoot through glass. This is from personal experience. Got raided by a couple guys and shot them through the glass.

On the road just north of Watoga is a horse trailer filled with three giddyup buttercups. Build a camp around there so you can get to the two Watoga vendors for free and some giddyup buttercups if you're so inclined. From there you can relatively cheaply get to one of the raider vendors at R&amp;G station, from there go north to the two vendors at the Whitespring, west of that is the Responder's vendor at Charleston Station, east from the Whitespring is Harper's Ferry.

Is it actually possible to ban this geezer off this sub? I‚Äôm sick of reading his absolutely ridiculous and pathetic rambling. Get a life!
---
There are such things as nuance and proportionate response.
---
The 'borg cubes' are getting a bit on the nose now so it is likely that at some point in the future it will be patched. People abusing the 'campfire trick' are extremely unlikely to get banned or even admonished however. It will a case that after a patch it will no longer be possible to do such thing and that will be that.
---
I personally don't see how sharing nuke codes is an exploit but I guess it boils down to personal opinion and threshold. I am sure there is at least one person that considers using one of the many assistive methods for the hacking 'mini-game' punishable by death by firing squad.
---
Regarding duplication glitches it should feel very clear by now that the devs are onto it. If the glitch exists it is very likely is already on their radar and although this is something that of course can be disputed it would seem to me that some consideration and thought has been given to how the matter is dealt with rather than going 'scorched earth' (pun intended).

Is he actually attracted to light ? I thought this was only a random encounter

Weapons bug Quad Combat Shotgun. Only have 36 shells instead of 48 with biggest mag. 
---
It's also very quiet, so I'm able to maintain stealth much easier than my other weapons.
---
I took it into Westek last night and was able to complete the entire place with just it EXCEPT where you first go through the big security door inside and get swarmed by like 10 supermutants at once.  I even handled a respawn when another player showed up.
---
Most days yes, my levels are not "farmed" from ghouls at the Golf Course. I have been playing since day 1 Beta and kill and encounter the world as intended. Some days, painfully slow, other day sprinting like a Fury Addict and jumping off cliffs without P.A. and laughing as a feral Ghoul follows me and dies on impact like a lemming.
---
There‚Äôs nothing that says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm entitled‚Äù more than some tool setting up s turret camp to block or take XPs from others in the area.   
---
If you can‚Äôt hang or fight with the enemies then don‚Äôt go there.   Level up in other areas that are a bit less challenging and go back once you have the weapons and armor to compete. 
---
Or simply team up or tag along with others that can help.  Most players won‚Äôt have an issue with that in fact most higher level players help out routinely. 
---
How hype am I supposed to be that 6 months into a game they are adding minor things like "backpacks"? Is that some big game changing thing? 
---
Thank you
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve had the same with Desk Fans and Garden Gnomes. Seriously, WTF?
---
The other things are not good but sharing codes is completely fine. Sharing codes has been a thing since the game came out. Please delete your post. It‚Äôs been a waste of everyone‚Äôs time to read and a waste of yours to write 
---
Lucky you. And here I am LVL 78 and im STILL looking for that damn moth.
---
I‚Äôd add console too since not everyone uses voice all the time
---
Must be one of those dirty salty exploiters we all hear about so often on this thread.
---
In my experience, the vendors in Ash heap seem to have the highest chance to have T51b mods, together with the free states vendor bot. But so far I haven't seen a single calibrated shocks mod.
---
This is all very much a 1st world problem since I have bought the plans, so with a little elbow grease I can craft the mods, but the T51b leg plans only drop from events and treasure maps and so far I haven't been lucky enough to get them.
---
This is for my second character and my first one has a X01 set fully upgraded. To not repeat myself I thought I'd get the second character to main a T51b set instead of the X01 set, but right now I think getting a second X01 set might be less frustrating than having a crafted T51b set.
---
Yeah, that update is still some months away, so I'll not waste too much valuable stash space for this, only 3-star and weightless items, plus maybe god-roll perks on a sub-par weapon type (in case the transmogrification is not random).
---
Really curious how the scrapping will be designed. Full control would be rad, but if that were the case they'd have called it  a 'legendary workbench'. My guess is it'll be a Borderlands 2 style lottery, but I hope they'll also at least let us control the resulting weapon type. I'm not scrapping three 2-star shotguns for a 3-star polehook...
---
Well I would highly recommend you get it. 
---
Im a heavy gunner aswell! 
---
Gatling Plasma's do more damage because of the higher base damage. With heavy guns you reduce her armor to 75 with Anti-Armor and Stabilized. So if you have a minigun doing 20 damage, it will be reduced by much more then something with a base damage of 50-70 with the way Armor piercing works. 
---
I whole heartedly agree, as a Stealth/Sniper build, I watch WS for opportunities when no one else is there, to quietly sneak through &amp; kill ghouls, but lately, about 5 out of 6 times when I arrive at the Golf Club, all the ghouls are killed by the missile Turrets hanging across the back of the building before I even get a hit on them.
---
I've decided, to do something about it myself;
---
1. Offload caps (don't want them collecting a bounty)
---
2. Deploy Orbital Strike Beacons.
---
3. Kill the inconsiderate A$$Hats when they return.
---
4. Server Hop, Rinse, &amp; Repeat
---
I will make it a new personal Quest; "Destroy 20 Player Bases at WhiteSprings"

Doesn‚Äôt mean bethesda didn‚Äôt want you to still try.

Again it‚Äôs arbitrary. They provided an opportunity to team up. If you‚Äôre too scared to do so then that‚Äôs on you. Get a mic and start talking to folks make some friends to take events

I'd really like to be the fly on the wall when you ask Claire to carry 1700 cheese wheels. Please make that a saturday live stream.

If so I can finally lose the legendary walker!

If they ban everyone who has shared nuke codes then there wouldn‚Äôt be a player left, get your head checked out pal

He is a very experienced gamer, passionate about them, and very experienced with every fallout from the start.  He will not carry a perspective that agrees with everyone, but his perspective is logical and with understanding of the entire series.  He also has a good sense of game mechanics, strong telling, and had a decent understanding of why people enjoy games.

The only clickable links I provided are for the Nukes &amp; Dragons Website and the Perk Loadout Manager mod page. The text is for people to copy-paste to make a sample PerkLoadoutManager.ini file with some interesting perk loadout samples. Once you've copy-pasted that content into a file, the editor (like Notepad++ that I use) should highlight the links and allow you to jump to the link if you are interested in examining the configuration.
---
Just because it is a highly beneficial and rampant exploit it is okay? Seems you just don‚Äôt want the loop closed on this highly game breaking and abusive exploit of the game.

previous iterations of FO had pips on the compass showing the reltive direction of nearby scavengable items.

I still miss that feature.

I‚Äôve seen scorched sloth? How the heck does that happen?

Get your charisma up and play in a group. That is the current theory. I brought mine up to 7 and had lots of 2 star drops. Took it back down to 4 and I am back to one star drops.

Been using about 20 mods from the Nexus (including this one) without issues since launch.

üòÇüòÇüòÇ highly game breaking exploit üòÇüòÇ you‚Äôre on a different planet pal. If they wanted everyone to crack the code on their own, they would of made it so every code was unique to a player. Use your brain

I had to spam grenades to get past that bit on my own lol.

Probably the easiest thing to tool around with is a VATS non-automatic rifle build. You'll want high agility for more AP and high perception for gun accuracy. High-damage slower rifles like the hunting rifle and lever action work well with it. 
---
it was rebalanced in the patch (kicks in under 60% health now and is still pretty strong under 20%), but the update broke it if you acquired it before the patch. The fix is simple: remove it and reacquire and it should work. 
---
 No it is a narrative that needs to be present as a reaction the same way people treated the concept of duping so heavy handedly. Just because everyone does an exploit doesn‚Äôt make it right. It‚Äôs is not even sharing codes. It is literally a website that people go to where the codes are post exactly at the reset. I am 100% positive that is not the way Bethesda intended that mechanic to work. If your out there collecting all the codes from the officers and you grind that out for each code that is fine. I highly doubt anyone single person who has commented on this thread has done that ever.
---
I concur, someone dropped a nuke last night and was attempting to do it solo so I went to help. I was met with a sea of scorched everything. I spent 60% of my time there fighting them instead of her. There was only two of us. 
---
It's not just legendary weapons.  Had my modified Power armour torso disappear from my inventory for a week (real time) and then miraculously reappear.  It's a mad, mad Fallout world . . .

So, your whole point comes to situations where It has nothing to do with combat situations but situations where you are opening your inventory standing up. Again that is your own amateurish and that is why you are already losing 32% DR and be in disadvantage. You see I am player who plays games like DayZ &amp; EFT, we don't open our inventories while standing up. In DayZ when ever you stop moving you take a knee, even if you think you are safe, you still take a knee. Only time you aren't taking a knee is when you want to get seen by enemy. Yes in current F76 server I stand up when waiting or checking inventory or what ever I am doing, because there is no danger. As soon as I start taking over workshops or defending it from players and I am in environment where I can get killed by players, there is no such thing as "Going to check my inventory/map while standing up", that is how things in survival games work if you want to survive.
---
...And in Survival mode we aren't doing things we are doing now. Forget the trading, forget the events, forget all public things, forget all the situations where we put ourselves in visible positions. What we do is search and attack- We run, run, run, crouch, check map....run, run, run, crouch, open inventory....run, run, run, crouch, approach, attack and be in combat. If we survive the combat, we go back into crouch and check surroundings. Once we are running low on ammo or resources, we hop to adventure mode and craft, trade or do events in there.
---
Sure, but it's certainly much more of a problem for PC than it is for consoles, since you can still use the PSN/Xbox Messenger there. 
---
&gt;If you had an unlimited stash, you could fill up after a day and not need to adventure stock up for weeks, which will crush the playtime said person puts forward to the game.
---
Is this not a big red flag for you? The developers didn't put enough engaging content in to keep people putting in playtime so they bogged the game down with excessive amounts of tedious and repetitive grind to mask the lack of content.
---
Nope, we're not out hunting for rare items and cool C.A.M.P cosmetics, we're picking up the N+1th desk fan so that our gun doesn't fall apart when we go out to shoot a supermutant.
---
Noticed the option to "join another server" immediately after the installation of the latest patch.  Unfortunately,  after attempting to join "another server" failed three times in a row, I found myself respawning . . . and surrounded by five Mirelurk Kings.  Guess that was the penalty for putting my camp in a popular spot, eh?

This. I've had a keyboard hooked up to my PS4 for years now. I have been pleading for a text chat since launch.
---
As it stands right now I completely ignore everybody I see because I have no way to communicate with them. They stop and wave and do whatever other silly emote, I just run right by.
---
I don't use mics so I don't fit into what developers had planned. 
---
I have given the codes I found out so people on here at one point. At least I believe I have and I‚Äôve seen people who give them out on this sub. But from what I‚Äôm also seeing is that people in this thread are sick of seeing the same thing over and over. It‚Äôs why I say your post was a waste of everyone‚Äôs time
---
People on this thread meaning the like 3 people who are now the majority for the 120k subs?
---
Post has been up for 45 minutes. Give it some time and come back to me later when I‚Äôm right
---
Take the legs out with a shotgun.

Perhaps it'sjust  me getting unlucky then. Still, as someone who generally only plays when it's late, text chat is still essential for me. 
---
What you're looking for exists, and it's called Fallout New California.
---
The early game is both the hardest and most rewarding - the thrill of discovery and listening to the holotapes and working out what has happened. It's not really a grind-y game at all until you're 100+ and just looking to optimise your weapons. Basically if you're worried that it's an MMO-style game that doesn't get good til the end, you've nothing to fear as that couldn't be further from the truth.
---
RNG world drops/spawns.  It happens.  Cannot say it would be there, or even a plan at all, with any regularity.
---
Oh yeah mind posting a link to that moment you spoke of where you gave codes out. Must be the very noobs days of tour existence before your realization that everyone just does the code exploit so why not you too.
---
Does the syringer work?  I read a while back (couple months) that it didn‚Äôt do anything to her so I stopped using it.  But if it does now or always has I‚Äôll absolutely start carrying that puppy around again.

I'd love to see bulked items removed from "junk" status.  After all, I thought the point of bulking was to reduce server stress from too many inventory items.  I'm really sick of losing a week's (real time) worth of bulk materials in a server hiccup or unreachable loot glitch.
---
Your user name is very fitting. I'm sorry you got caught for cheating in a buggy and easily exploitable game. Good luck in your next online adventure. Thank you for your participation, here's your trophy...
---
Ah how cute another salty exploiter assuming I am also a cheating scum like themselves. Cute kid.
---
Got it. 
---
Had the same thing happen friday night/Saturday morning. 2 of them spawned and neither would take damage.
---
The funny thing is, I wouldn't care if the game was taken down, reworked for a year, and reenabled. That'd be totally fine if the intent was to build a better game.  Players want something good, something that will last for years of play, and have good, solid value for those years.  A junk game lasts months, is forgotten, and leaves a bad perception of the company with their customers.  It is always, ALWAYS better to wait on release and create something better.  Developers and companies also need to totally be willing to scrap bad development paths and start fresh of the idea doesn't pan out.  Instead, most companies see the sunk cost and would rather push to release something half as good as it could be, if only to recoup some of the development cost.  Extra Credit had a good episode about this.

There's some business reason to what companies do, but in the end, it really harms is all, even though the company can generates positive revenue from the sale of a lesser game.  I do think the model with in game revenue generation does throw a wrench into the whole get it out before we need some money from this idea.   As other games have shown, in game revenue can be MASSIVE as long as the game is actually good and can actually pull in a very large user base.  It can far out weigh short term revenue models and the target to just break even.  The potential pretty much requires something brilliant or worked out so well it becomes a staple for the gaming community for years to come.

Seems like every time I load, it's a few yards away from my camp.

Spam is relatively easy to counter, you just add an option to block a certain usre in chat and (Optionally) add a wait time between each messages. 
---
Or better yet.. you wonder why your mutations aren't working.. or why your foods decaying at an alarming rate to discover... You've forgotten to switch certain cards back around. 
---
It may have grown to other instances, just logging into a new world to join buddies does the same... similarly, loading between doors entering or leaving also kills your light... 
---
Where the hell do you find a chainsaw? 85 levels in and haven‚Äôt found a single one

That would be nice! \*dreams\*

Good news, you can find him in several places. For me he spawns next to and sometimes inside my camp. Location is the middle of the savage divide. Gimme a few and I'll post a pic of the exact location.
---
On my neverending searchgrind for X-01 CS mods, I found a glut of crappy legendaries at the MODUS vendor that someone had dumped. Including a number of rolling pins and combat/bowie knives. So naturally, I bought them up and stashed them. They were only like 10-15 caps each anyway.
---
Gotta start saving! :D
---
I do one hand melee and heavy guns. 1H weapons are light and I got some weight reduced heavy weapons. Also without maxing the damage cards left room to focus on heavy guns since both they and melee work off of strength. The weight reduction guns allows me to not put as many points into weight reduction perks, more for melee and heavy guns or whatever. Really tho I feel like strong back might be a waste also. In my experience, no matter what you do, you‚Äôll be struggling with weight. 
---
So is this just a normal troll/shitpost?  Or is it a salty banned duper?
---
Because it‚Äôs a multiplayer game with balance intentions, it has nothing to do with keeping players engaged, it‚Äôs purely balance and stability reasons. You do understand that every single item you carry plus store has to be saved server side, and if every player could go on forever it would result on what we had during the duping phase? (The dc‚Äôing and crashing every 5 minutes) 
---
They don‚Äôt do this will the ill-intent of ‚Äúour game has no content so lets force people to play with storage limits‚Äù open world online games like this ALWAYS have item caps and storage. I could name HUNDREDS of games to back this up, literally.
---
Players running with 500 stims and every weapon with infinite ammo would be utter ridiculous and at that point it‚Äôs not a survival game, remember, this isn‚Äôt a single player environment where you can be a god, there HAS to be limitations.
---
&gt; The fix is simple: remove it and reacquire and it should work
---
That is not a simple fix if you are running 6+ mutations
---
The roadmap is about a backpack right?
---
I don't really use mods, as I play on Xbox One. I have dabbled in the mods available for Fallout 4. *Insert I'm not a smart man Forest Gump meme* They're fun, but don't really appeal all that much to me, but if stuff like that exists.. I'm all for it really.
---
expensive but not rare whatsoever. you must be confusing it with neon letters set
---
I use the steel doors with the small mesh windows for just this reason. 
---
If I want crouched headshots, I use the jail door, or the full panel mesh. They seem more durable than the wooden doors with broken windows you can shoot through.
---
just buy mutations from people. they usually for fairly cheap
---
I tend to agree with some of the writing of 3, and feel like people shouldn't be surprised with 4 as a result. 
---
But at least there's something, unlike 76.
---
I was running 9, had to replace 6. I found a guy selling them for 250 each so not so bad, but not fun for sure.
---
100% approval for us night time players with families üòÅ I also suggested a feature awhile ago that could do text to voice if they really wanted to keep everything audible.  There are many ways to keep immersion while still allowing text.
---
You just ignored the rest of the roadmap?
---
Not Bethesda's fault but I think most people will end up disappointed in however it rolls out.  They aren't (can't) make all these easy to obtain and worthless legendarily value-able without throwing off balance.  However it gets rolled out I expect you need to scrap at least hundreds to get something useful.  In any case it's 3 months out so not worth the stash space, maybe put 900 lbs of them on a spare mule character.
---
I'm on PS4 too. I generally can't move while I load. 
---
They're there, just not at the stations
---
Omg yes! that would be really cool.. *wishes for a concept like this*
---
Where did you even find the schematics for excavator mods? I server hopped for hours yesterday going from vendor to vendor and never found any (only a few mods but no plans). Some said it can be found in the mining company top floor near a car, tried that too, nada nothing üò≠
---
I only have one star of White Knight and equip it when repairing armor, but I rarely have to do that because of 3-star lucky break. Even if I had 3-star white knight I'd still prefer LB. I haven't fully ranked it up yet cos I have other cards that I want to get sooner.
---
I also use 'Luck Of The Draw' and have 12 luck, which certainly helps.

I encountered it today. Pissed me right off.

Oh my god... Yes!!! Why isn't this a thing already? I understand it does have to do with how many perk points are allocated.. But still, non combat based skills shouldn't really count towards your SPECIAL. But I guess we can only dream..
---
Damn, very cool. Does the jail door shield you in any way or just serve as a physical barrier against melee attackers?
---
Back when I started playing I had a base near Vault 76 in the small lookout to the left of it. I start hearing chattering in the distance before I hear an "excuse me is this your base?" I come down confused wondering who it is since the voice sounded young, turns out it was a little kid, he was quite polite asking if this was my base and how cool it looked, I had just picked up the astronaut suit and helmet so I dropped it for him and the kind went over the  moon. He was really happy and excited, I crafted him some level 5 heavy leather armor and a good pipe pistol, he then sent me a team invite and I helped him do the quests up to flatwoods where I needed to go do to other businesses, He added me in friends but the account was his dads and he ended up removing me because of it. Still was a great and fun experience and to this day I still hang around Vault 76 with level 5 care packages.
---
Some quad are bugged, they can only quadruple the standard mag. I had a quad handmade with drum mag it should have 300+ ammos but no it only have 140. Also Quad broadsider with the repeating canister can only have 6 cannons ball. 
---
It does partially frustrate me that modders can come up with solutions for the game and can implement them fairly quickly, but console players get the short end of the stick. 
---
Try taking your clothes off and putting them all back on again.  Works sometimes.
---
Good to know! I will olay around with the metal door and check it out!
---
It's good with the standard launcher once you learn how to arch the nukes properly. 
---
I love it when gameplay uncovers functionality like that!
---
I mean, it really would be nice to be able to "lock" weapons / armor to prevent them being scrapped or discarded.
---
It's located southeast of watoga. It's part of the brotherhood quest line
---
Hell, even the game is becoming free to play soon so...

They are giving away Fallout 76 copies for people buying used controllers, adding extra copies to the fallout 76 xbox one bundle and even giving a copy for people buying 5 DOLLARS in products in some stores.

Didn't that Fallout 3 project get dibanded? Atleast that's from what I've heard 
---
&gt;it has nothing to do with keeping players engaged, it‚Äôs purely balance and stability reasons.
---
Apart from when it has to do with keeping playtime up, as you said. Sounds like you should make your mind up about what point you are trying to make. Is stash limited to keep people coming back to the game to hunt loot. Or is it for server stability?
---
&gt;They don‚Äôt do this will the ill-intent of ‚Äúour game has no content so lets force people to play with storage limits‚Äù open world online games like this ALWAYS have item caps and storage. I could name HUNDREDS of games to back this up, literally.

Name one with such an oppressively low storage limit.

I‚Äôm running a 1060 on a laptop and I generally get between 50-60 FPS, however, there are areas (White Spring during a ghoul spawn comes to mind) when my frame rate drops to 10-11 so you aren‚Äôt crazy ... there are still some areas of the game that I suspect are not optimized just yet.
---
Btw ... what is you IGN?  I never got a friend request or maybe it expired before I could get on.
---
I might get down voted for this, but I am truly starting to think that the SBQ fight is another example of the game's shitty RNG. Meaning that RNG actually factors into the winning the fight.  I am starting to think  that there's times when she spawns an there is zero chance of winning  no matter what because it's per-destined by the  RNG. 
---
I don't really understand this argument. Fallout 3 has a great ruined look but New Vegas' world is far and away more interesting and memorable to me, because you knew for a fact that when you discovered a place you were going to get some interesting story or character out of it. 
---
Exploration for the sake of it is fun as well I guess, depends on your preferences. But New Vegas had distinct locations; the Capitol Wasteland could become very samey at times.

I keep reading this in a Kahjiit voice and i dont know why.

The jail door is just a physical barrier, it's open both ways to gunfire. Unfortuantely, any of the doors that let you fire out, also allow fire in. 
---
I usually park a tall trashcan or newspaper stashbox in front of the jail door to give me cover to snipe around the sides.
---
Gives me point of use cover that I can drop/stash as I need it.

Doesn't Phoenix in Watoga have those? I'm pretty sure he has all the mods for the T-series PA for armor, all the time.

Not too long ago I had a legendary drop an assassin's assault rifle and it disappeared before I could loot it. it was strange but it was a garbage drop anyway. A little bit later I saw an assault rifle on the ground so I think oh some steel , pick it up... Assassin's assault rifle. Pretty nice coinkydink huh?

So if my character theoretically wanted  wanted to run around the golf club smashing ghouls with a rolllng pin, what would your price be?    Note that I sm on PS4 and that I am traveling and unable to log on for a few days?

Your post scrolls off the screen left to right.  The problem is easily visible in Chrome on my phone and on a PC.   It looks like you're using the preformatted option which is usually used when someone pastes something that needs to have the formatting persevered.   In your case there is no line wrapping... The lines all go to the right very far.
---
Since we can‚Äôt sell freaking disease cures I‚Äôve got like 30. 
---
I once went to the Whitesprings Golf Course. Nothing was there. Then my mutations started activating. The sort of radioactive blast one. And I started taking damage. A few seconds later, a whole load of ghouls appeared around me. I couldn't even see and hear them and they could damage me!
---
sure buddy, it was only all over reddit yesterday...
---
so, what MATN laid out in yesterday's video? 
---
The hills are also a nice spot to set your camp, far from Whitespring nukes, close to vendors.
---
Oh I have a explosive The Dragon. It used to be explode things out of the planet before the nerf.
---
Tbh all sbs probably should've been legendary. 
---
Read this about preformatted text.  Then edit your post and remove the indents. Looks like maybe you copied and pasted your post and if it had indents in it, that jacks it up:

The math is this game was done by someone with an IQ level of 75. Many legendary items I have list ‚Äò90% weight reduction‚Äô still weigh 6-8 lbs. Are you telling us this rifle and this piece of armor should weigh 80 lbs without the legendary feature? Many ficking retards in the dev team. 
---
I had all of these issues happen to me last night.  There was a damn near immortal mole rat (of all things) that was trying to decimate my teammates.  
---
At least it's a known issue and not just me, I guess?
---
Argh.
---
I went up to Lewisburg for the first time as a lvl 20 and came across an entire army of super mutants, I didn't have any decent guns and my best hunting rifle was damaged.
---
I managed to kill pretty much all of them using grenades, my 10mm pistol and another .44 pistol I had with about 20 rounds in it.
---
I wentt through almost all of my stimpaks fighting them and as I was licking my wounds a wendigo decided to appear. I ran into the train station thinking how I'm going to get out of this one as a LVL134 player came out of nowhere like a knight in shining power armor. This guy lit that wendigo up with a laser gatlin as as I stood there in awe of this dude's greatness. he then gave me a thumbs up and teleported, what a guy!
---
I'd say because of post-bomb war and civil efforts to hold people together. Much higher need for cargo rather than passengers
---
Mind to link your build and weapon you use please?
---
I think most of the issue comes from that. 
---
After patch, SB looks tougher a little bit and SBQ is tougher with more adds. 
---
Thank you for the helpful list!
---
I also saw the health invincibility bug twice this past weekend. It's almost Monty Python-ish that she'll take damage initially, but then reject the reality of taking future damage. Haven't seen her head to Watoga though, at least not yet.
---
He means just turn your body back and forth while trying to jump, trying to crouch, etc.  -- It may take a minute, but you will likely get out eventually.  
---
If enemies get close enough to you, you can use a melee weapon and VATS out of your spot as well -- if you're lucky enough that they come close. 
---
Agree completely. In its current state, it's a total waste of time and effort
---
Nah even that doesn't really work... There is a bug in the trajectory of the MIRV.
---
Not seen the mole rat one, but the mutant suicider maybe only 3 I've ever seen. I feel in FO4 they were a lot more common. Shame really.
---
1. Don't die
---
2. Stalk and waste your target
---
Doesn't work with strange in Numbers. In fact SIN turns it off for some reason.
---
Aight
---
I have lost loot when the bodies change into piles. I will see the item, and after the change it's gone 
---
I have a _major_ bug with my CAMP:  None of the foundations, floors, or water purifiers load in. They're just ... gone.
---

Nothing in the "Stored" tab, and my CAMP budget is still at ~99% so the items are still "there" just inaccessible. 
---
#What do?
---
^(Bethesda username = Reddit username)
---
This happened to me Saturday.  
---
Pretty sure you are trolling but I'll bite. It's called overstock. Bethesda already confirmed that the game is not going free to play. 
---
Less likely stubbornness than weariness about the risk and cost of overhauling things.
---
Same.  Thought they said they fixed this in patch 6. :(
---
Yesterday I was on a team with my gf (sitting next to me on 2nd screen) -- I fast traveled to my camp, she fast-traveled to me while I was still in the loading screen (we do this commonly without problem), but she then wouldn't show on my screen for another 1-2 hours until the sever crashed.  I had several workshops claimed, I wasn't about to server hop :)
---
I didn‚Äôt go there for a long time.   A big reason is unless you have the perks and weapons and gear you will get worked over.   There are still some times as a lvl 120 it can get a bit challenging.  
---
It‚Äôs not a fun experience when you are surrounded and can‚Äôt really fight your way out of it.  
---
"You're doing that too much, please try again in 9 minutes."
---
Thanks bro I‚Äôm on PS4 though. I sold a furious Handmade just a few days ago to a vendor bot lol. With the upcoming legendary scrapping I should probably keep all the Legendaries from now on üëå
---
I really would rather not have chat. At least give a option to disable. I kind of like having to use the icon things. I adds a little the mystery thats is FO76.
---
They are not a challenge or anything. They are just so annoying. At least give us a better loot. I'm sick of their intestines
---
I really like his idea about making junk components 0 weight if they are stored in stash. 
---
Im at level 30 and my stash is full of valuable and rare components. I have a few weapons and armor parts in there but 80% of it is junk. I love exploring every single corner of all locations and collecting junk, but im about to reach the limit of 800. What am i supposed to do? Sell it? Theres a 200caps limit on every kind of vendor so that sucks and would make the process long. 
---
If all holotapes and notes weight nothing then why cant all components also weight nothing?
---
I am completely fine with the limit of armor/meds/food/weapons you can have. But you should be able to store infinite amounts of components. 
---
I think its only worth it to farm exp. Since its very possible the event will fail if there isn't at least 8 people using the correct gear/weapons to down her. 
---
That vendor has all the plans for the mods, but the mods themselves are rare. I have bought the plans, and if I put some work into it I could have the 10 violet flux needed... but comparing the availability of calibrated shocks mods for sale at vendors, the T45 and T60 are much more common than the T51 mod (which seem to be very rare indeed). 
---
Nothing he said has anything to do with weapon choice.   He said that they got the SBQ down to 20 percent and then she flew off the the edge of the map, where she couldn't be reached.    Weapon choice doesn't solve that. 
---
Haha you made me laugh
---
Why do people keep comparing this to fortnight? You are way off base. It's pretty obvious that it's not some 'suits' making design decisions over there. It's a very immature and childish mentality.
---
They are working on fixing these systems for us so that it's a better time playing all around. The new pvp servers may help end griefing on regular servers but it's also just part of the game. It's a wasteland. You're gonna have shit head Raiders out there. 
---
The pvp that does exost doesn't play anything like a battle Royale game so it's dumb to say they made those design decisions to tap into the kiddie fortnight market. 
---
Now if they launch survival mode and it's a competitive death match style free for all then yeah, let's chirp the designers  (again, not suits) for selling out and trying to make a battle Royale.  
---
Until then maybe think about what you say for like five seconds before posting.  
---
Referring to the 4 SB. I didn‚Äôt specify. Sorry about that. 
---
Its the new way to grind that's for sure. I've never seen so many enemies before this recent patch. 
---
No damage and sbq is frozen still on the ground. Waste of ammo. Happened to us recently. Also when the scorched earth event ends in failure players should still stay to kill sbq.
---
That is NOT sunk cost fallacy. They mentioned "fixing it would be too costly." The cost to fix is NOT a sunk cost. It is a new cost. There is no fallacy there.
---
Sunk cost fallacy would apply where new costs are NOT more to change paths, but they continue on the old, inferior path because they don't want to feel like they wasted the past cost to take that path.
---
That was an Easter Egg i promise. 
---
Still not worth it. Until they start dropping materials required in crafting legendary items I see no reason to fight them. Not that they are a tough fight for non-melees anyway.
---
Whitesprings after a nuke, the glowing ones seem to keep spawning after the cloud has lifted. In fact it seems the second the cloud lifts, every ghoul will spawn at once, you literally face a sea of glowing ones running in all directions lol.
---
I believe it still works. I can test soon. I usually use my gatling plasmas and cryolater. 
---
Radshield is scarce because of the issues you mention on your post: the bloom spawn - as far as I can tell, there might be an area deep in The Mire I haven't found yet that has hundreds of them always in bloom and I am being an idiot for thinking they are rare - is tied to Heart of the Swamp or the quest that gives you the recipe itself and the instancing of the blooms seems glitched.
---
Escarcity + desirability drives prices up.
---
Someone doesn't like the prices? The quest is open to everyone, so are the perks required to make the most of it. They can craft it themselves.
---
This is not like legendaries where you could kill thousands of enemies yet never get the one you are after. Radshield is obtained via a predictable and repeatable process. 
---
Is that the one with the reduced carry weight? If you remove the MIRV it becomes like a 2lbs Fatman. 
---
I don't have the issue, most other players do. I actively called to teamup in another thread, and the majority of responses was 'hell no'. Bethesda tried to please everyone and ended up pleasing no one.  Be snarky all you want, it's not going to help the discussion.
---
We get it. You were banned for duping. Go somewhere else and stop being so sour and grabbing at straws to bring everyone else down with you.
---
Fuck the trade, i build my camp next to the ressources i need. Let them have that crap. 
---
I have an AA The Dragon that is almost a guaranteed 1 shot kill.
---
Yea, that shit is really annoying...
---
Yes it worked!!! Thank you so much!! 
---
I spent $500 upgrading my computer for nothing... 
---
It's possible that things have changed significantly since I was at your level but, as I've said, I had quite the opposite experience and do my best to help the low levels. And I know that I'm not alone with that. 
---
Plus, don't forget that while the lvl 62 ghouls and the Wendigo that might spawn there seem like tough enemies, they really aren't. Depending on the build, anyone can one shot them and that doesn't even require a top of the line weapon. 
---
And to make things worse, if you are a bloodied build and aren't in power armor, you simply can't take the risk of letting those ghouls gang up on you and increase your rads even more because that means instant death for you. So yes, it might seem that some are assholes, and some probably are, but most players don't do this because they can, they do this because their build requires it. 
---
The only ones to blame here are Bethesda who can't balance server spawns properly. If they'd instance the popular farming places properly it would be a non issue.
---
Not the vendor, but one of the icon of the new feature clearly has 5 stars under it.
---
I agree, destroying something doesn‚Äôt really teach you how to make parts for that something. I‚Äôm really liking OP‚Äôs idea, it makes a lot of sense 
---
You'd think. Some people are just jerks, I guess. 
---
My routine is very similar, with my CAMP near Flatwoods (Moving soon), but I frequently skip Sutton for the more Lucrative Pleasant Valley.
---
I also have 4 other regular locations for gathering Technical Data, that are along my routes, and 2 are very near (enough said), camp Venture.
---
Remember those TSE dragons that did more than 10000 dmg good times...
---
Finally I found someone else that has this!!  
---
I found the same recipes in Arktos Pharma and have been trying to figure out what to do with them.  I couldn't figure out how to activate the machinery so maybe for a higher level quest?
---
Are there events that will not activate until you are a certain level?
---
Downstairs in the cellar of Mountainside B&amp;B or in a shed behind The Cranberry Bog Ranger Station 
---
I'm thinking more for the players that aren't in the end game grind for 3*s yet. The ones that just  beat their first scorchbeast. They're level 40 in a group blowing through ammo expecting something nice for this awful trudge and rewarded with some crappy food a little leather and some ultracite they can't use for anything. 
---
The 5 stars under the "new feature" is that legendary player thing they're adding
---
Most melee builds are very user friendly, just waltz up to your target and smack em'. Granted, you will want to hold onto at least one ranged weapon - a short hunting rifle is easy to mod and come-by (plus like every mob drops .308 ammo), a fully modded one can effectively take out targets via range that wouldn't be able to otherwise. 
---
Basically, figure out if you want to do One-handed or Two-handed. I started out as a 1-H build, then went to a 2-H build. I think 2-H's scale better, but I don't have physical evidence to support this theory. 
---
It seems like you're playing for fun and to enjoy the story so I wouldn't worry about like min/maxing. I would pick perks that make life easier, get travelling pharmacy, get power-patcher for your power armour. I run perks that reduce the weight of food (forget the name), I take no rads (Lead Belly). You will want to get makeshift-weapon x5 for melee. You can also pick a single rank (slugger) of each of the damage mods (3 points for 30%) which allows your build to have more passive perks to make your life easier. 
---
V.A.T.S. allows you to basically "charge" your target, I usually open with a single V.A.T.S. attack then just right-trigger. Or if anything, just use V.A.T.S. to dump a critical hit every once and awhile. 
---
Gotcha.  Thanks for the clarifications. 
---
Maybe weapons have something to do with it, but I personally have noticed a change in the behavior of both Scorchbeasts and the SBQ. Or maybe there is no change and my luck has just been bad. 
---
It seems to me that they are landing much less, and if the less they land, the harder they are to destroy. 
---
In the past, I remember killing regular scorch beasts  solo by knocking down their health a bit an then finishing them off fairly quickly when they landed. 
---
And I did it with a Gatling gun with pretty unremarkable   legendary effects. 
---
More recently, there have been times where I've had to expend a lot more ammo  and stimpaks because I had to destroy them in the air without them landing once. 
---
Nice, never seen one of those.
---
I've started finding plans on SBs. It's like 1 in 10, but I've been getting them. Also if SB's cause too much damage, invest a single perk point in Fire Proof. 
---
Go to the trading sub
---
Apparently, I don't really see them gaming but law is the law
---
Can you link it ? 
---
 So 2+ people have to use a separate app to chat in a game, vs just having in game accessible?  If you play as a team, sure...
---
Let's just go back to the dark days of the internet  /s  (but really?)
---
All my launches have been solo but my participation level is about 65% so far because of freezing up or outright server disconnects.  Much like  qquestd0, I have started taking a screen shot with my phone of the recent player list before I launch.  If I get disconnected, I look up one of the players and view their profile and rejoin their game from there.  Don't have to be friended to do it that way.
---
Good to know...thanks!
---
That's the problem with people who use area chat all the time.  If your chat is on auto, you can talk to your friend from across the map and ask him to fast travel to you and kill the npcs.
---
As a side note, if you have fireproof you could blow up the car.
---
I haven't seen anything official from Bethesda on Scrapping of Legendary items coming our way, but I would love it if we could remove &amp; reuse the legendary modifiers.
---
'Griefer Island'. Yeah, exactly. Bullies turn to jelly when they're faced with someone who can stand up to them - like other high levels.  Then they'll come running back to hassle us to rebuild their egos. 
---
En mass? Not really, but most buildings have extinguishers, you could probably grab them as you farm the balls and such. 
---
I think I have a spare set. I should be on tonight.  Purple0squirrel Xbox 
---
The salt is so delicious! üòã
---
What's the advantage of sticking around? I was low on ammo and healing, and a bit frustrated, so I bolted once she went airborne and headed off into the sunset. Honestly, I don't care about the completion, I'm at that annoying "find Taggerdy" quest that reboots every time, and I've started Enclave, but I'm only halfway thru my Commendations. Does it still drop legendary loot? 
---
If said player is like me, overencumbered, then as you are likely aware, you can't respawn anywhere other than (near) the place of last death.   I carry lots of junk; when I die, I want to recover same if possible.  
---
So the question then becomes, did the player attack you after respawning, or was the player just headed back to the junk bag?
---
If the player did not attack you and was returning lo locate the junk bag, and you repeatedly killed him, while questioning his intelligence, then yea, I can see where that would become really irritating, really fast.
---
Umm..... WAY TO MANY! lol
---
In seriousness, I try to keep about 20 rad-x diluted, 30 radaway, 20 stimpacks and a handful of psycho-type drugs.  Also keep a couple disease cures and at least one bufftats in case you get overloaded.
---
It already got nerfed and it breaks quicker even with gun smith perk card ar 5.
---
All the cars are exploded already, don't have a mic
---
I use a TSE Level Action Rifle from up on the rocks to pick off the SM on the ground then I throw on the PA and pop my All Rise and gut the inside. It's fun and in X-01 Pa with the Medic mod I'm pretty untouchable. 
---
I use a hybrid build for my character part riflemen part melee I like to toggle between situations.
---
You don‚Äôt need to lug many weapons around, just scrap them immediately at the nearest bench will save the weight and unlock mod capabilities. I think the scrapping-learning mechanism is working as-is right now. Yes some weapons are rarer than others, such as the gauss rifle, you just need to figure out where to find them or farm them. Actually I was rewarded several gauss by using the treasure maps (obtained by killing small bosses such as crowned windigo or glowing ones). And now I‚Äôve unlocked most of the mods for gauss. Using the weapon alone shouldn‚Äôt earn schematics for the user. That‚Äôs basically like if you stick to one weapon long enough you‚Äôll eventually get all the mods, which makes it way too easy and less interesting. 
---
Im not saying its not a thing, just sayibg how it could be abused to add a "dont attack me" timer, a lot of people will load in faster than i do and they could 1 shot murder everything around them well with a timer given
---
Do you have other mutations? If there were acquired before the patch then they could be bugged as well (I have heard of old marsupial causing ar to trigger off of hunger). Maybe a full mutation rebuild is in order, but I don't use strange in numbers so I don't know.
---

---
Were u alone in the fight or were there many welps?
---
You can save up your levels, just hit back when going into the Perk screen if you don't want to choose something right now.
---
I currently have 8 level ups available that I haven't used.
---
Dude... it's been like less than a week. chill. maybe start a new character in the meantime...
---
Personally, I like and hate the limitations, they are VERY limited compared to Fallout 4, but if you manage to build something nice you feel rewarded.
---
Please, let it really save weight
---
I'm playing on PC, I've been taking into account everything that's being said and trying to fit it all together. Its going to be another 20 levels to just swap around all the points and getting all the different cards sadly. [Here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f15888b&amp;d=s42ss2se2sm1sn0sg2er2cd1cm2id2i44a72la2lp0l71l21pa0a04lu2ep1cu2&amp;w=&amp;n=) is a bit of a v1.1 that I've been working on.
---
Yes Please.
---
I Play sporadically as I most of my time I am in an MMO, I usually play when My wife is  playing music and \*Singing\* along with it. This is problematic as she drowns my mic out. and  IMO hearing material girl at white springs during a nuke might mess with immersion. Although Devo Is fun when hunting mole Miners...   
---
I have been dropping plans and gear for people under 20 but have no way of saying Hay take a look and take only what you need. and share with the person behind you. Or hay I see you over there by my camp go in and rest and get tuned. etc. 
---
Why not use the original voices? They aren‚Äôt violating any laws as far as I know
---
I have all 17 and I still have the quest... I can't get these damn things out of my inventory or complete the quest...
---
Ah yes thanks
---
One of the best things they could do is turning off collision and let us place everything sunk into objects. Remove the necessity of the foundation. Get rid of the "this item needs support". We'd have a bunch of weird floaty half sunken buildings sure, but... 90% of the videos I watched on YT for fo4 were tutorials on how glitch walls in place so I can put a roof on buildings without having a giant floating platform as a roof hahaha
---
Lmao... Exactly.
---
Dude ...it's like ONE bug that doesn't take that much of fixing. Chill
---
It would definitely by awesome. If one could pick up a two-shot here, a quad there and an explosive somewhere else, he can go back and make a quad two shot explosive using the three. Wouldn‚Äôt that be something üôÄ
---
That could be a balance update, but I don't know.
---
My two cents on this issue. Make Whitesprings the OFFICAL player hub. Open those closed doors inside the resort and let us stay awhile. Charge us caps for a day like in Skyrim. Just think on that for a moment. For those that don‚Äôt build camps and such. Make it is a No build zone within the spawn areas and place the players market in that area somewhere, also not messing with the spawn area. Like Bartertown. On those levels or something this is just a thought though. 
---
How did you get to the top. Im only able to get to the smaller peak. Marsupial mutation?
---
Cool, I will look you up tonight!
---
It wasn't legendary was it? Apparently a lot of people aren't aware that legendary enemies will heal periodically if not downed fast enough (one heal per star I believe). 
---
Not sure, but one of the metal security doors is a jail-cell door.  I \*THINK\* you can shoot through it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs 30%, but it‚Äôs really not worth it. If it‚Äôs an already powerful weapon, you shouldn‚Äôt need the extra 30 to take down a scorchbeast.
---
I would not hold your breath. If you remove and reacquire it it should work fine. You but serum from other players for 250-500 each.
---
If you're this impatient why not remove the mutation then obtain it again? 
---
lol. I was almost the welp. I'm 65, my crew were 55 and 34 ( he was roof camped tagging and watching our backs/making calls/defending the door to the weapons bench). Most of the others were higher than me, and at least 5 were 90 plus.
---
four more patches and three hour fixes.  Then it will be back but nerfed 90% and only work half the time it's suppose to. 
---
So from my experience it's loading into an area either via fast travel or mission door before the other player finishes loading in. Take a number and have your friends call out when they are able to move on the other side of the load screen.
---
it's available in BoS vendor Phoenix inventory in Watoga Shopping Center.
---
Vendor Bot Greg in Grafton. He's in a building with 2 entrances. I think there's signs in front for medical supplies. 
---
I can't do that. I already paid for serums and have 8 mutations.Not gonna gamble with that just because they can't fix ONE bug that changes my entire character build
---
Yay! You're welcome friend. Well hopefully you can make use of your new upgrade still
---
That‚Äôs been my experience, all the fun in this game is the leveling up slowly and taking your time exploring all the interesting locations and figuring out their stories, being in danger and running away when you need to. If you try to power level to the end you‚Äôll get bored fast.
---
Yes. Please. 
---
Would gladly do it but i have 8 mutations that i already paid for .Not gonna gamble which goes first just to fix something they should have fixed. This particular bug affects my entire character build
---
This totally, I put this in as a suggestion ticket on Bethesda's site weeks ago.  
---
Since you are on Xbox, I can make the BOS Officer Suits, and Mod them to Shielded (Best protection)
---
Suit is 200 caps, Shielded add another 200 (requires Flux), 100 cap discount if you provide the Flux.
---
GT= Medieval Paul
---
No you are correct.  I believe its a 24 hour reset.  However, that is nullified if another player who hasn‚Äôt collected the items loads the cell first.  My route is usually one and done per day given traffic near the Morgantown HS and cat lady house is usually just done by people looking for plastic.  That said-and I‚Äôve never tested it, so I might be wrong-but there is a gym in the back of Grafton high school that is ‚Äúoutdoors‚Äù in that it doesn‚Äôt require you to load into a sub location.  There‚Äôs a utility room in the gym with a ton of kickballs.  I believe it‚Äôs close enough to the Grafton train station to load up whenever someone fast travels there.  You might have lucky server hopping there provided someone else is in Grafton in your server.  There are some super mutants outside, but they‚Äôre actually fat enough that I don‚Äôt believe they can chase you inside.  
---
Good luck!
---
Man I played ALL weekend and didn‚Äôt get a single loading bug or server DC. Feelsgood.
---
I agree I just log out or head inside if I can, they just are an annoyance now....
---
I wouldn't mind knowing as well. Not sure why this mutation should be nerfed being it's a strategic decision on how to play. 
---
I guess your entire character build isn't worth a maximum of 1600 caps. Thats kinda sad 
---

No, it was a standard glowing mole rat and then a few minutes later with a ghoul, both inside Fort Defiance.  I had seen it happen earlier with a standard wolf out in the wild but thought it a fluke.  
---
As much as I enjoy building up camps the system is fucking infuriating at times lol. However I am very spoilt by the place anywhere mod in 4.
---
I keep rads so my hp is about 40%. Thats why life giver 2. More health at 40%
---
I'd say it's practical to spend an hour a night on it.  The structure of 76 is very casual.  You aren't in the middle of an elaborate campaign and forced to make epic decisions.  Instead, you kind of putz around in the wasteland and do whatever you want to do.  So, for me, it has a lot of the same self-driven qualities as games like Cities: Skylines or The Sims, only in an shooter format.
---
Talons, twisted muscles, marsupial , adrenal, speed demon, healing factor amongst the most important mutations
---
Don't be trolled by some cheapskate because they want something good for next to nothing
---
Yes, but Quad &amp; 2 shot are both Prefix modifiers, so you can't have them together.
---
Each Modifier has a Slot, Prefix, Major, &amp; Minor, there can be multiple Minors, but only 1 Prefix, &amp; 1 Major.
---
Been playing 200+ hours and I haven't spotted him yet. Ditto for Flateoods alien. I'll be sure to check the spot you mentioned. Ty.
---
Ofc thats not optimal but its worked wonders for me 
---
Up to you. It was worth the 1500 caps to get my build working again for me.
---
I think it's a thing with that one raider faction. That location is (was) a purified water business run by that group IIRC.
---
I have little to no interest in Pvp but I would like to say keep the servers together as they are, and then a more cut throat pvp in the way of survival. I think I would lose interest in the game if the fear of someone helping or ganking me gets taken away. 
---
You're not fooling me ,Todd. Fix your game !
---
Xbox needs it too. Communication is so much easier in games like ESO. 
---
I know right? I can kill them relatively easily. But I don't, because it's easier and better to sprint away. Unless they're close to my camp. Can't afford those things hitting my decon shower.
---
I'd estimate half of PC players have been using this mod since it came out months ago.
---
Same here. Super stimpacks are not worth the effort at this point
---
Bug fix has already been implemented. Removal of bugged mutation and application of new mutation fixes the issue. You're welcome.
---
Gotta be real honest if that's what it is I'm gonna wait like a year to play it. Just in case it's not behaving 
---
I want a comic of this now. 
---
It seemed to be a solution whenever I've used it
---
Lol just come walk with me, 25 times now in the last week. Seems my PA is coated in honey or something.... :)
---
I like the idea (of creatively decluttering my inventory) but there are two flaws that jump out at me.
---
1. Sometimes you might want to re-read or re-listen to a record. I love the cryptid radio programs, and some of the BoS tapes are really really moving.
---
   -Solution: add an archive function, either to the PIP-Boy or buildable terminals that backs up all our collected notes and tapes, organizes them, and tucks them away out of our way. Similar to Eidetic Memory in Elder Scrolls Online.
---
2. Currently, there is no one on the other side of those supply drops. It is all automated, just drones grabbing crap from some Amazon warehouse and filling a crate with spam and random pieces of scrap.
---
   -Solution: introduce a new faction from outside Appalachia, call them the Archivists. They hacked a satellite and see Appalachia is empty(ish) but dont know why. They see 76 dwellers and reach out asking for any notes, records, stories whatever, so they can learn what happened and record the lives. They can't send the drones out, but they can hack them after they make their drop and have the drones return to them.
---
This is one of my prime gripes with the game. In Fallout 4, stealth worked almost perfectly. In FO76, it worked well to a degree and then they screwed that up too. There is no reason for the entire group of mobs to instantly know where you are and proceed to attack you after one sneak shot. What's the point of even having sneak if it no longer works properly.
---
Bethesda fixed the movement issue in a prior patch
---
Yeah if you see "Steal" there is your sign....
---
My main character is a Stealth/Sniper build, with Unarmed (Instigating DC Gauntlet) being my primary weapon (80% of kills).
---
My regular Armor is mostly High end, Weight reducing, so I only use PA when I'm in High Rad areas (Blast Zones), or Team Events (team play breaks stealth).
---
So to answer your question, Yes, it's very viable.
---
We need Text chat on console as well
---
endangerol doesn't work. Karma does, but only marginally
---
Lmao bullshit. I trolled through your comments...
---
And owning your cosplaying ass was easy and something I enjoy doing, so unfortunately the ‚Äúdefensiveness‚Äú you are detecting is once again your sad projection lmao
---
I did some testing the other day. These are my results. This is how many seconds it takes 250 AP to refill from 0. Each is an average result of 5 tests.

You should always be able to revive another player with a stimpack (if you have some) or with liquor (with the perk card equipped and booze in your inventory). It doesn't always work for some reason.
---
Thanks for posting this. It's easy for the rest of us to never even think of how things like this can be an issue. I just figured Bethesda neglected to include voice chat for purposes of immersion; but I don't think that's really having the intended effect anyway. Hope they implement text chat and your bro takes another crack at 76!
---
Was the stealth nerfing confirmed?   I never saw proof of nerfing, only proof that they messed with the code and broke it.  
---
Can concur we nuked whitesprings and corpses were lootable but would disappear after approx 10 sec so you had to be quick.  
---
So y‚Äôall are back to being giant assholes and talking shot about people on a personal level?  Guess the roadmap wasn‚Äôt what you actually wanted, you just wanted to be dicks.
---
They really should be, at a minimum, 1\*, and possibly always reward a semi-rare Plan on top of it.
---
Yeah I picked up a Gatling Gun as my ranged weapon (I'm a melee build but I also require a ranged weapon). 
---
If I want to mod it, I have to either craft Gatling Guns, or find them - they don't drop very commonly. Plus the plans cost like 6000 (I think) caps - then I'd have to farm the mats. 
---
I think this suggestion is a good one, for certain weapon types it will be incredibly cumbersome to attempt to farm/craft the guns in order to maybe get a mod. 
---
Perhaps make the chance low (1/30 chance, at 100% repair - tweak the value - so at 50% repair - 1/60 chance, this is just an example). 
---
probably there is limitation for change your unwanted legendaries. maybe caps or new tokens or whatever. 
---
Chance at BoS combat plans , plans for power armor pieces. I'd start killing them left and right. I can currently make t51b left arm lol
---
Unfortunately I am role-playing as a chef, so it is not for sale.
---
Bon appetit.
---
Will give it a try, thanks bro üëç
---
I didn't know that, yeah that's probably what it was. Fuck I feel bad now.
---
They can add riot gear but no ranger gear, since they don‚Äôt exist yet 
---
I fired mine off the side of a cliff. Nothing to hit but one still came back
---
bethseda
---
Thats how it works and is pretty dumb tbh. Each faction shares their own cap pool amongst themselves.  
---
Awesome
---
Yeah i run Rejuvinated and when solo Max Lone wanderer, well tuned as often as possible,  and just now dabling with armor ap refresh.  Before Grimm reaper sprint broke two patches ago all this was pretty much insignificant and i never ran out of ap.  
---
I've since adjusted according and dropped four leaf clover, psychopath,  and grimm since they all seem broke, replaced with class freak and bloody mess. 
---
Being a vats sniper one huge change for me just yesterday i remodded my aa handmade from severe piercing mag (which ate up ap WAY to fast) to hardened quick mags and a world of difference,  i think with armor piercing prefix,  plus piercing mags,  plus tank killer,  was too much armor piercing. 
---
I had been using the chat mod since it was created, and now the game feels that much more alone, and empty, again now that the mod is no longer functioning.  Being able to message players across all servers was giving the feeling of a community, it was great being able to respond to requests for help on other servers, or organize SBQ kills, setup trades, or even be alerted about griefing wanted players for me to hunt.  You can't do any of that with voice chat alone, PC users have no way of communicating cross-server or even out of the game like console users, without the use of third party software.
---
Please officially add text chat to the PC client Bethesda, or at least make a networking exception for the chat mod that you disabled until an official chat is coded.

I agree, it kills the fun when some jerk that is literally 100 levels higher than you comes into your house, kills everyone in your team and razes your base for no other reason than they can. 
---
First rule of legendary hoarding club, don't talk about legendary hoarding club, lol.
---
Yeah. The insta-healing enemies is the healing bug that they got rid of a few patches ago. They re-instated it with the patch that accidentally added back the bobby pin weight among other things. It just wasn't as noticeable right away and thus hasn't been re-fixed by either the hotifx or most recent patch. I don't understand coding or programming but it seems strange to me that with new patches you would roll back previous bugs. A quote from the devs - "This issue occurred when a merge of our development builds failed to execute properly prior to releasing patch 5" Why are they merging builds if that can cause bugs to be added back anyway? Why aren't they just creating new clean builds to lower/eliminate that risk? I probably sound like an a-hole making this observation since like I said, I DON'T understand coding or programming. But it just seems lazy to me. Just my two cents
---
They should drop things (not 100% of course) related to the BoS.  Maybe put those lost BOS mod plans on their loot list, since they have been removed from the Vendor lists for the last two months.  Combat/Marine armor mod plans and loose mods.  Everything related to what the Brotherhood would have been throwing at them in their final stand.  And maybe rarely 1 random stable flux from them.
---
Currently Deathclaws, Yao Gaui, Wendigo, etc, all have better loot tables and are so much easier to kill than Scorchbeasts.  Seems Scrochbeasts exist just to consume bullets at a net loss for the players.
---
That‚Äôs true, both quad and TS are tier one mods so they can‚Äôt overlap. I‚Äôd like a Bloodied Explosive with +100 strength (after scrapping a hundred +1 strength I hopeüòÇ)
---
No, what they're doing is trying to convince the PvP crowd it's better to play on the PvP server. Unless they just haven't mentioned it yet, griefing assholes can still go on the Adventure mode server and do the same stupid shit they do now.
---
&gt;  I have a few weapons and armor parts in there but 80% of it is junk 
---
This is why people have problem with stash size. I have exactly 5 bulks of each junks, what means I am always playing with 400 lb stash and I have never problem with it. I don't collect 90% PA worth of junk into my stash and let it take space until I actually have 100%. I take one piece of worth of junk, build piece and then collect another piece worth of junk and build asap. I am never out of junk when I need, because I always maintain 5 bulks of junk. When I have 5 bulks of junk, that means I don't pick it up that junk, because I don't need it. Once I use some from that bulk, means next time I going out I pick the junk up to make up what I used. This insure when next time I need something, I will have 5 bulks already waiting and this keeps my stash always empty and yet enough junk not needing to worry about it.  
---
Everyone should go melee! I don't know how the server operates, but I think melee needs far less data exchange than heavy weapons. 
---
Being on a Team seems to have a significant affect on Stealth since Patch 4, but there are other issues as well since that patch.
---
I have tried Unequipping and Reequipping the perks (sometimes seems to help), also logging off &amp; back on fixes it, sometimes.
---
When it's working correctly, even SBs can't find me, and I have a Video to prove it (Level 65 SB dies to DC Gauntlet) 1vs1.
---
"You sound like a big year old"
---
Honestly the only mod that matters on the Gatling Gun is probably speedy barrel. Everything else just adds weight and doesn't really impact the weapon in any other meaningful way (extended magazine adds bullets, but it has 250 by default, and it just slows your reload speed down. the sight attachment is heavily misaligned. bayonets are niche. the grip doesn't impact hipfire that much)
---
My experience: 48% of people helpful, 48% of people ignore you entirely, 2% of people out to get you.  
---
Way better odds than i would expect from a postapocalyptic wasteland.
---
I'd advocate for a twisted muscles and talons nerf. Just to nerf the top end of melee a bit. 
---
Rendering your rolling pin....priceless!
---
FYI If you remove and reapply it - Strange in numbers breaks. 
---
Smh
---
Ive yet to see insta-healing enemies others than legendaries.
---
I dont want even less people on the servers....dedicated pvp will seperate out quite a few...however, getting one shotted by a tse weapon when ur in full power armor with buffs, and just trying to farm something at a workshop is extreemly annoying. Typically the person has no interest in the actual workshop, they just wanna bother you, and then message u about it.   The character set up for pvp vs pve seems to have a pretty big gap.......and yes, you cant trust other players at all.    I have people message me after i ask them to join a team...and they wana know why? Lol.....cause i wana play as a team! Or even just get shared benifits.......it shouldnt be something you have to be suspicious about. Imo
---
I'd love to see that. I'd go scorchbeast hunting and it wouldn't be strictly for flavor. 
---
I have not played for a while but I'm looking forward to trying to jump back in.
---
You're welcome
---
I have seen this too. I tried to kill a snallygaster yesterday and it was taking very little damage. 
---
Got a 3* exterminator's bowie knife with 33% vats hit chance and +25% ap reduction vats with your name on it, 2k caps bro üòÜ
---
Something is Off IMHO... Or the weapon doesn't have enough range, or the way the bomb arcs when shot is bugged.
---
Also if you notice when you shoot the MIRV the warheads aim down when they separate instead of continuing the normal trajectory... Logic would be the MIRV warheads continue the trajectory of the mininuke  to make the weapon easier to aim.
---
I disagree you have an issue. If you didn‚Äôt, you wouldn‚Äôt have asked Bethesda.
---
Not being snarky just saying the pvp vs pve is being worked on, with survival mode, but that framing the discussions, logic is flawed.
---
That‚Äôs someone that if I saw you I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúAaahhhh! Run away! Run away!‚Äù Scary person. 
---
I ran into an unkillable rad rat (not legendary) at Blackwaters mine. Every time it took some damage it instantly recovered and keeps chasing me. Tried melee, tse and non-tse weapons, nothing mattered. It‚Äôs the creepiest thing I‚Äôve seen in the game. 
---
melee seems to do the trick. Last few times i did SBQ i ended up face tanking her for the majority of the fight that she was on the ground. It helped that was the only or one of the only melee guys. 
---
Throw a few power attacks and/or crits at her crotch and she spins around real quick, lol
---
Just found blue and pink! Thank you for posting info on getting them. I was wasting tons of time searching the whole place. 
---
We Allready can make 4\* Items: The 4th Star is if u add the Scorched Effect from the Firefighter Questline via Reciever of some wepons. If we can add with the new vendor a 5th (4th without the mod) it would be interessting what types are possible
---
Drinking beer on your porch will always attract barflys, ALWAYS.. lolz
---
I've always considered the nuke code sharing to be a feature that they anticipated - IIRC, one of the hype videos for the game noted that you should be teaming up with people and sharing codes. It would be somewhat insane if they didn't anticipate that people would use websites to share them, since GameFAQs has existed since 1995... If they didn't want codes to be shared, they would have randomized them or had them reset more quickly. 
---
except upcoming Survival mode is just a game mode where you jump in for easy PVP action and that is fine, because that is like Battlegrounds in WoW. But PVE Survival mode isn't just mode that you "Ohh, I feel like I wanna play today on harder difficulty" and then hop to that server and leave when ever you want or are about to die in thirst. That kills the idea of being PVE survival if you can leave and come when ever they want.    
---
Just finished that quest, mole miner suits give black titanium and are plentiful in Garrahan Mining Headquarters. 
---
I guess not.
---
Legendary wooden leg? What the F*** ü§¨ lolz 
---
I wouldn't fight them if they'd just leave me alone... I mean, I walk away, they should walk away... BUT NOOOOOO..
---
Make sure you mention your platform!
---
RNG screwed you but it could've been a bloodied grognak's axe :)
---
Copyright I think. Bethesda didn‚Äôt give them permission to use the original voice lines.
---
Nice ideas, I love how he emphasizes on specialization and teams, anything that fosters cooperation between players would be welcome. Also, as a low level player, I'd like they implement more questing (especially co-op quest chains) and exploration that discouraged tedious grinding. 
---
Players who focus on support / non-combat centric characters would need some love, make us feel a useful part of the adventuring group and for that we need more content that relies on teaming up to achieve a successful outcome and get the 'mission', 'quest', 'raid', whatever...accomplished.
---
No, it was only postponed because they didn‚Äôt know what to do now that they couldn‚Äôt use the voice lines. They eventually settled on revoicing them.
---
Naj by welps i mean the barn and gully dwellers who just hide and dont do anything. If youre participating in the fight then you are no welp regardless of the lvl
---
Even a chameleon wood leg is better than nothing, which is what we‚Äôre getting now. After patch 5 I got some pretty decent loot from level 80 SBs such as schematics for ultracite weapons, but now after latest patch it‚Äôs back to normal armor crap. It‚Äôs as if the better loots were an accident and now they fixed it. 
---
This happens to me aswell, and yes it is indeed aggravating. However, what I found worked for me was to change my gameplay mode from Fullscreen to Borderless Windowed mode. The game should be automatically set to BW mode for some unknown reason, and while it's true most games run better on Fullscreen mode, it's been a "common" thing for Bethesda games to run "better" on BW mode. 
---
For me, personally, it worked. Not only did I suffer from the problem you're explaining here, but I also encounter CTDs much less often (used to be everytime a server spawned an SBQ). Changing to BW mode doesn't directly affect enemies around you into not attacking you, it just makes it so that (in my experience) your character loads faster, I did tests and it was only a difference of 5 seconds, which could be due to error, but who knows, perhaps there's a correlation. 
---
If this didn't work for you, I'm sorry. I know this isn't a "fix", but more of a work around to this big issue. Hopefully Bethesda gets a fix for this as soon as possible because it is a VERY aggravating thing. Thanks for your time if you made it this far in this "Essay" per say.
---
It was balanced/nerfed. The new damage table had been posted in the community patch notes (sorry, I don't have the link), but it kicks in under 60% health now (instead of 90%), and is almost as strong under 20%.
---
Can't you breath underwater with the PA? 
---
Lol selling a Chemistry workbench and a Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip. I'm surprised you're not selling explosive vents.
---
And your first drop from legendary scorchbeast is an instigating super sledge
---
Done
---
Nah, not legendaries. Maybe rare crafting supplies. 
---
Anybody else have an issue with sneak criticals on A.I. while teamed with or in the presence of other players? 
---
I'll hit something, see the full damage applied to there health bar and then their health will jump back up reflecting the damage that would have been done before my bonuses to my sneak critical would have been accounted for. 
---
Why make t51b when you can find them in so many places. I have several t51b sets all pieced together by farming different areas. 
---
Even the Queen is not worth fighting. You have far better chance to get good drops from ghouls. 
---
Not disputing that random internet person, just voicing my disdain for shitty business practices and how they effect a paying customer.  I'm sorry you can't handle that for some reason.
---
yes but they released a jpg of a "roadmap" so all problems are fixed now. 
---
My first drop from the SB Queen was a one-star rolling pin. The second was a stalker‚Äôs tire iron üòÇ 
---
Thank you! -FreckledWoogie
---
Well... I'd much rather have the plan than the thing.
---
Everyone knows the joys of that Surface to Air quests giving you some stupid, over-encumbering loot just as it spawns another Scorchbeast.
---
I also find the challenge of crafting ultracite ammo very enjoyable and rewarding. Recommend using green thumb when harvesting fluxes and super duper when crafting.
---
I just think of it as a QoL improvement but I understand that my opinion is not universal.
---
Said that it bears to reason that if the devs would have wanted the nuke codes to be 'a thing' they would have made it more convoluted?
---
Is not like you have to go out of your way and do several 'fringe' things that are outside the scope of 'regular' gameplay in order to be able to share them.
---
How often do you find level 30 t51b? Level 15 raider? Level 25 t45? That's why. To craft full sets for lower level characters. I'd be giving away sets of t45
---
She does, this was one of the first songs to say fuck publicly. I think it's a metaphor, old man mose is the old testament. Just a wicked fun thought.
---
I've had a few Legendaries drop nothing but I noticed that with the last two who didn't have anything in their inventory they literally drop their loot on the ground. I have Bloody Mess equipped and both Legendaries exploded. My suggesting is to search the area for missing loot. 
---
I always go to the amusement park and pick up the nuka cola cups to stock up on plastic.
---
they have to add speech-to-text tech if they gonna add chat system, that's not a cheap shit
---
I want those ultracite shocks though 
---
Wow, spot on.
---
Easily the most mature and well thought out FO76 critique out there, fine job MaTN! 
---
It‚Äôs in our thoughts and prayers 
---
Giving you an upvote back because this is the way every boss thinks -- so Congratulations, you're ready for a role in management!
---
The hard work of programming is keeping the entire team's code "tidy" enough that a fix in one place doesn't unintentionally break someone else's fix in another place. But with schedule pressure (from managers like you!) everyone has to take shortcuts and it's easy for errors to creep in.
---
Other kinds of programming solve this problem with automated testing that checks for all the bugs for you, but sandbox games like this are so complicated there's no way a series of pre-scripted bots could test for all possible bugs.
---
Damn, good to know cause I have looking for a long time to get the Quad Explo combat Shotgun and it was really disappointing to see that the mag is bugged. My next dream is a Quad Explo Handmade with drum and you are right, it should have 340 rounds with the drum mag. But with 200 less rounds .  disappointing too lol
---
Are you on xbox? I feel like I have one 
---
My first SBQ drop was a 1* furious handmade. Gotta love the splattercanon. Or was it the problem solver? Can't quite remember...
---
We already have a 'Block for session' option so this could also entail text chat.  Easy way to handle spam.
---
Got my base leveled by a jerk, and I have all the workbenches and water and crops and a junk collector for all, HAD a rad chamber but now not enough flux to repair it so that‚Äôs history. It‚Äôs still open to the public minus the rad chamber cause I‚Äôm just NOT going to do the somewhat easy repairs (I hoard junk so it‚Äôs hardly an issue) except for flux which is too hard to come by in that amount.
---
Just pisses me off that I spend all that time making something for everyone‚Äôs use and someone screws with it, but that‚Äôs part of the game I have to accept and deal with.
---
Yea that site is tricky. There are some peaceful locations such as transit hub (need to pick lock) and the rooftop of Watoga HS (no enemies) üëå
---
No problem, in fact I will give u 10k coz it‚Äôs such a rare weapon.
---
Just had the same issue -- wendigo is mostly invisible except for a chameleon-like ripple that pops up every few seconds (after you're already taking epic damage from seemingly nowhere), and there's no way to do damage to it in return. Very strange. 
---

I'd say 25% good, usable ideas, 25% sketchy ideas, and 50% ideas that would have been good while they were building the game but probably can't be done without a MASSIVE amount of work and investment that we're probably not going to see.
---
Don't see why they couldn't remove the build restrictions for example other than maybe events/quests getting...mixed signals.  Being able to build in any non-event zone should be fine.
---
Thank you for your response.   All of the nerfing‚Äîespecially stealth nerfing‚Äîangers me.  
---
Agree with you. If they wanted to make it more of a 'thing' for gamers to decipher, they could require that players possess them in their inventory, or that team members have them in their inventory. But if that was the case, I think they'd have to reduce the number required from 8 to 4 or 5, just to limit the frustration factor. (And that being said - Even though the codes are on the internet, I think the cooldown timer for the individual silos helps to limit the number of nukes better than making the codes harder to decipher / use.) 
---
I usually do a fort defiance run for various junk and straight jackets, then go Watoga Station, Watoga Shopping Plaza, Harper's Ferry, Whitesprings, Pleasant Valley Station, Sutton or whichever forest station was closest.  I don't have enclave access but if I did I'd go to them right after Whitesprings.

Awful but makes for a convincing supernatural entity.

How many rare crafting supplies to make them worth it though? 10 screws?  20 springs? 
---
Something like that happen after killing the SBQ and a few other SBs, no one could loot the queen or the sb, everyone was so pissed, and I also have the issue that enemies heal after taking damage, although on my side they heal half other damage I originally made to them, so I need to spent twice as much bullets to kill an yet already spongy enemy

Yeah, get the sneak attack cards (forgot the name) and a few rifleman cards and you've got an assaultron destroyer.

The worst thing about mole rats is that they do so little damage that it may take them a really long time to kill you. An agony-filled, drawn out death, a few hit points at a time... truly, they are the most fearsome enemies of the Wasteland. 
---
That‚Äôs true, schematics allow you to mass produce at the levels of your choice. Level 15 I‚Äôm not sure, but I ran into level 30 t51b and raider many times. Sometimes I thought the system is bugged so it would throw lower level enemies and spawn lower level gears for me. I‚Äôve seen level 25-35 raider PA at black water mine and low level mole miners (pink suits) there very often, and I was the only player in the area.

I occasionally use my stealth build to shadow low lvl characters. I let them get a hit in then snipe the enemies. Goal is for them to never see me. Sort of a mysterious stranger RP.

They should add in the welcome mat spawn point from FO4. Would resolve spawning in the air or away from the base :)
---
r/thathappened
---
Yeah but if you stick with one weapon and just pick up versions of that weapon to scrap for the mods you're literally doing the same thing with a few extra button presses.
---
Seriously, picking up -let's use the Gauss rifle because you mentioned it and I use it a lot on  my toon - you use it a lot to snipe. Ok, cool, now every time you get your hands on another one you do one of two things, either keep it because it's better (higher level or better mod) or  you scrap it to unlock another mod. 
---
The whole thing takes all of a few seconds of comparing and then maybe a sum total of six button pushes to scrap it next.
---
That's it.
---
How EXACTLY is that any more interesting? That question is 30% sarcasm and 70% curiosity, I really want to know how that is more interesting than an natural "I've had this weapon for weeks and have figured out how to break it down, put it back together, fix it, and even add some of my own touches"
---
Now I haven't even touched on the weapon/item levels because I personally think that the item levels have no place in Fallout. Skill has always been the determining factor in Fallout games for how effective you are with any particular weapon and locking down versions of the weapons - especially when I have THE EXACT SAME WEAPON THAT I USE....well, I think it's a rather bad system in the game. Whoever thought that was a good idea should have been gently smacked with a rolled up newspaper \*bop\* Bad, that's a bad developer \*bop\*
---
You can‚Äôt scrap legendaries. It won‚Äôt let you.
---
That‚Äôs a decent drop üëç For a long while I thought SBQ only drops melee stuff bc it was all I was getting lol 
---
Absolutely make sure it's maxed
---
thanks for the test results i figured it stacked because i had 3 pieces on and i only counted 4-5 seconds to full refill
---
You bought the game for reason A, they aren't adding reason A any time soon.  Why stick around?
---
Quit yer bitchin.
---
The pvp server will satiate his need to be an ass for a little while until he starts getting his shit pushed in by others. He then will come back to the pve server and harass people cause he doesn't have to worry about instant retaliation. This is my biggest fear of what will happen since Betheada announced they would carry progress between servers 
---
I disagree. Keep adventure as is. Add pvp. 
---
Bethesda wants raiders in all the servers. For good reason.  This isnt some bullshit love filled hippy playground. Its the nuclear wasteland. Toughen up weenies.
---
People wont be carrying junk in pvp mode. I want to keep farming players for loot.  Adventure mode will ALWAYS be the place to raid dummys qith junk at workshops. 
---
Urgh... the drunken way gets darker... so I then sold it.... which is worse because than it's  out there in the world and most likely gonna get killed by it... nnooooo.... 
---
Because I enjoy other aspects of it?
---
Shove it up your ass, I can bitch if I want. Bitch.
---
I‚Äôll give you 8k for the yellow dress
---
I've got tinnitus, and voice chat can be difficult to make out sometimes. I prefer text chat most of the time. 
---
Someone else spawned the armor and didn't pick it up. If you visit first it'll be 45. Right now the plans are incredibly rare, and are not particularly sought after. They t45,51,60 drop from distant thunder very rarely and very very rarely from treasure maps. Don't know how to obtain raider. I want to craft sets for noobs üò¢
---
Uhhhh whatever you say pal. 
---
Which jacket is that 
---
Apparently yes but I never watched that video from what I explained in other comments. So I just so happened to think of it at the same time.
---
That‚Äôs your opinion. Which is not the same as most people being reasonable. You‚Äôre being absurd because you think it‚Äôs okay to talk to people like that who‚Äôre just talking about a video game, and already admitted they were wrong. 
---
Although I don't understand why people grief, I am in agreement with alot of post replies on this thread in that, my gaming experience has taught me that most people tend to act in games just as they do in life: however, having said that, some people understand what RPG actually means and act totally different in a game than they do in real life.  I won't let my angelic 10 yr. old granddaughter, ( who rescues spiders and flies around the house from my murderous intent ) play on my tag anymore because she loves to go around with my level 180 character and troll lower level players and especially their camps.  I asked her why she likes that and she said, " It's just a game pappaw and I can act like a bad guy if I want to."  So my beloved little angel is a black -hearted troll in the virtual world ?  No, she just understands that if this game allows for and lightly encourages bad behavior, then she is well within herself to role play as she pleases.  She gets it that there can be consequences to shooting people and smashing their camps.  She would just rather do it with a tank than with a rock.
---
I lost interest in PVP a long time ago, so I don't play games that require it or participate much in team PVP, because of the simple fact that so many players find a way to cheat ( besides the fact that I'm 59 and my eye/ hand coordination ain't what she used to be), so going around trolling other players and their camps just to get some 1v1 just doesn't do it for me either. There are lots of games just for that  There are also lots of games for the black hearted griefer out there too.  Ever try your luck with ARK?
---
I play the game everyday I can, I try to help lower levels out when and if I can, I don't go into other's camps unless invited.  Others act differently for alot of different reasons.  
---
So don't let it get you down there bobcat, just be you and you'll more than likely find there are alot more people like us than like my little grandchild playing this game.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs determined but I have luck moving it by grabbing the actual camp bench in build mode and moving it within your build area.
---
My tse dragon shoots about 16 times before it breaks.  And that is at 200% condition and i have gunsmith 5 on.
---
I have t60 with jetpack. I have every suit all with shocks except that stupid ultracite set. Only set I can't really use I hoard need my 100 pounds for junk :(
---
I have a feeling it won't be. We've been through this before and it turned out to be FO76. Call me pessimistic but I don't have faith
---
Unlike the majority of reddit, he did this thing called "constructive criticism". He didn't just point out problems, he offered solutions to those problems for the developers to build off of. I could totally see them involving Mr. Egg Carton in future events. He isn't a blind lover or blind hater of the game, it's his balanced opinion and he gave it respectfully. 
---
Ah okay, now that you've explained this, my Gatling Gun is as good as it's ever going to be. So I guess this doesn't apply in this specific case.
---
Appreciate the reply!. 
---
If you remove PvP from the PvE servers, what happens with the workshops? Just shut them down entirely? Because that would suck. 
---
We only see cargo cars, no passenger cars
---
I regret buying this game
---
I'd love for this to happen. 
---
I don't have this happen a lot, but it does happen more than i want it to.  (more than once is annoying as hell)
---
I typed out a name toward someone a month or so ago on Xbox Chat and he reported me and i got a ban for 24 hours.  SMH.  
---
Silver Shroud
---
Well sorry for asking for a little assistance....
---
I carry about 150 stims, 125 radaway, 100 Radx, 50 each of psychobuff and psychotats, misc Nukas and food, 175 purified water 50 boiled water and 25 xcells
---
I feel like this is way to much though judging from everyone on here 
---
Now all I ever get is armor. I'm swimming in random unyielding/bolstering/vanguard's 1-3* armor. But uh.. I live in my PA so it's just caps to me
---
none of fallout games have it (at least as far as i know), but I think it would be nice to make a character like that girl from live action trailer (two SMG and westworld style dress)
---
I really only see one bitch here, shitter. Looking at your post history, cot daymn the amount of crying.  And you vape on top of it all.  It all makes sense now.
---
Except I searched for it and couldn't find it. So aight.
---
+1 for depressed adults. 
---
It‚Äôs why I stopped looking for groups on Reddit. 
---
I can only handle one of me. 
---
I think you are overlooking one serious factor. What do you do about claimed workshops?
---
I really like the munitions factory and have to fight for it sometimes.
---
Yeah well don‚Äôt blatantly lie. Alcohol doesn‚Äôt remove memory. If you were blackout drunk, you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to play the game. Don‚Äôt mix finding a weapons workbench, selecting your exact weapon, and    Scrapping it. That‚Äôs 4 different button presses to scrap. My guess is that you want a new free weapon, so you made up this story, and at the same time wanted to sound cool about drinking alcohol and getting ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù. 
---
my ign on fallout? Chambee
---
and yeah, there are some areas, like in the forest areas, i never usually lag, but when I approach like a factory or a building, it just lags massively, and I'm sitting there trying to flail with my weapon to hit the enemy, its completely frustrating.
---
Literally picked one up yesterday, scrapped it and got nothing. Couldn't say I was surprised though.
---
This was on a new character btw, so that made the experience a lot more aggravating.
---
I kinda think they'd be more fun as coop things. Maybe scaling with more players and awarding better drops. 
---
Yeah I agree. Bethesda world creation is far better, even in F76 the world is amazing
---
I mean true I don't need to carry weapons everywhere but there are situations where I can t find a bench or something. And well I don't want to walk for extended periods of time not being able to Sprint around because I'm going through a scrapping run just to get a single mod.
---
There are definitely moments in this game that are something else.
---
Had one Surface to Air or whatever event it is where you have to keep the ASAM operational.  Had no less than 8 scorchbeasts spawn, along with the usual followers.  There were almost always two up at any given point, sometimes 3.  Was a hell of an interesting couple of minutes!
---
This is how I fixed mine:
---
Removed all Mutations ( sigh )
---
Reapplied all Mutations through Serums except for Adrenal
---
Lucked out by having a Bloodied Lever Action drop!!!
---
Reapplied Adrenal after waiting an hour for the other Serums to settle in and because I was scared!
---
Became Happy Again that my Mutations are back!
---
*** Of Note: After reapplication I was in West Tek Mutant clearing when another player respawned all the enemies on top of me and I perished. When I respawned my Damage output went from 300+ per shot to 88!!! EEEK!!!! Yup, I had to shut the game down and boot it back up and it was all fine again. It kinda reminds me of how the Eye of Ra doesn't like it when you die either and drops stats.
---
Hahaha well I kinda expected that comment. I am not looking for a free weapon just advice on where I can possible find that axe again. 
---
Pure curiosity - how do you know it's the aame server?
---
Almost... like it's intended?
---
I think people would work together if killing them can't be the easier/simpler answer. 
---
I'll use Rust as an example since I've played it and paid some attention to its development cycle. Rust's system works in more hardcore way than 76 in that all items are dropped on death and most of the value in such games is items (scrap; a commodity for researching, Items to research, resources/components, etc)
---
What MATN is suggesting is a skill based scarcity where killing means nothing or next to it anyway. For example, say there was a master cooking perk that required a lot of investment and gave you some powerful recipes (say, +5 STR and END and fills your entire hunger bar) you can't kill the guy for the food and the item is locked behind a skill or set of skills that you couldn't spec into (assuming we're running MATN's fantasy 76 where you specialise). What options do you have left? Really it's either communicate and try to organise a trade to get what you want or ignore him and you don't get this powerful food item.
---
In comparison, in Rust you'd just walk up to the guy and just kill him for his loot and take it for all his worth and it'd be over in about 30 seconds while this system could last from a few minutes trying to haggle and see if he has what you're looking for to a play session and beyond because you now have someone you can reliably get useful and powerful things from.
---
 and as if you prove my point, along comes another who likes to complain about how this isn't fallout 5....
---
I have a vendor Character that sells Drugs, Chems, &amp; Aid, so I transfer excess daily, but keep 3 each of most things with the following exceptions;
---
 10 ea. Antibiotics, Grape Mentats, Bufftats, PsychoBuff, 25 ea. Radshield, Radaway, Diluted Radaway, Stimpaks, Purified Water, Dog Food, 200-300 Diluted Stimpaks (I drop them everywhere for low level players).
---
I use Travelling Pharmacy 3, and 1 FDC reducing armor piece.
---
I also Use 1 Weapons WR armor, &amp; 2 Junk WR armor pieces, all Deep Pocketed, which gives me 345 capacity, and with excess off loaded, I start my run at around 175/345.
---
Yep.  Ran into the same glowing/diseased immortal mole rat on the barracks level.  You could damage it with automatic or rifles but not with melee or explosives.  It would nearly endlessly chase and even burrow to chase you to other floors.  Immediately heal after being damage over and over again.  
---
I ended up just popping stimpacks to get passed the questline and get out. 
---
Does anyone else hunt scorchbeasts for fun?  I've put my camp in the bog and do a regular loop around all the fissures and mirelurk queen spawns. Cookie cutter heavy guns build with a Furious .50 cal. It can kill 2 or 3 SBs between reloads.
---
I will have to talk to another person who is interested on it and ask if they want to give a counter offer.
---
SEE, even I'm getting it aswell, I'm getting like framerate issues like crazy!!
---
And everyone was telling me I was crazy? LOL.
---
You can‚Äôt find legendaries . Completely random. Like asking someone where you can find a COD supply drop. Don‚Äôt change you story.
---
My counter offer would be 10k
---
Ok I will check with him.
---
It's actually really easy to loose track of drinks when you are playing with friends and yeah sometimes it's too much. But hahaha too try too look cool to drink... I am kinda older than that....
---
Out of pure curiosity, how old are you?
---
Here‚Äôs what people want:
---
Grinding is fine. Just make it less tedious. Grinding for certain things shouldn‚Äôt take nearly as long as it does. The RNG is broken and the best example is the end game. You fight a SBQ and you lose weapons, maybe some armor, majority of your ammo and when it‚Äôs all said and done it drops a wooden plank. 
---
It‚Äôs like bethesda has never had to make an endgame for a huge online multiplayer game. And it shows. 
---
Up the stash limit to at least 4 figures
---
Larger camp budget
---
Do away altogether with eating and drinking completely lol. Honestly.
---
Non PVP servers
---
I don‚Äôt know why this is so hard.  
---
They need to make all SB drop legendaries by default ranging from 1 to 3 star. Make them worth engaging.
---
Whitesprings nuked run yesterday, had half the flora unchanged, legendary enemies unlootable for around 7-10 mins, instaheal enemies and finally... missing legendary items on legendary enemies when finally able to loot. Also... picking up the loot was rarely regestering. Glowing/hardened mass and high rad fluids was missing from inventory. Good job on the patches beth!

---
Oh lord.....
---
sure buddy
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure how the scrapping-learning process works. I scrapped many gauss to no effect, just the other day I found one from a mirelurk queen‚Äôs drop with shielded barrel and suppressor attachment, scrapping that unit unlocked the suppressor for me. So it‚Äôs like you have to find the right component to learn it? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the component or because that unit hit the number of total gauss required to unlock that feature. Scrapping component to learn about the component makes better sense, if that‚Äôs how it works. In a real world scenario if I just keep using a same barebone rifle for years, I still won‚Äôt know how to make a reflex sight for it. 
---
I‚Äôm completely with you on the weapon level system. It‚Äôs totally dumb. ‚ÄòAn AK in the hands of a 14 year old is just as effective as in the hands of a 40‚Äô. It‚Äôs the skill that counts. Why do they put this mandatory ‚Äòyou‚Äôre not at the proper level to use this‚Äô BS in the game. The environment is gorgeous but the level system especially multiplayer mode was designed by someone totally brain dead. 
---
Get the 200% repair one too. It increases resistance as well as condition.
---
What he said.  I was falling off my cliff base every time.  Move the CAMP to the exterior of the build zone away from the cliff and you should be fine.
---
dude, it was literally posted many times yesterday, it was all over this sub!
---
Do you take workshops? They could be in a team, teammate is contesting your workshop so they can deal full damage to you while you're out and about
---
Yeah why not. Legendary weapons on them will just undercut so many things in the game that I think it‚Äôs a bad idea though. 
---
I Highly recommend that you craft a Pipe Revolver Rifle with a Hardened Receiver and a Suppressor on it. This Weapon takes advantage of Both Rifleman and Gunslinger Perks and was my main weapon from level 35-110 (when I was able to get the Lever Action plans).
---
This Gun with Gun-fu and Adrenaline will change your life.
---
If you are on XBox I can make one for you - no problemo!
---
Maybe they used keywords that I wasn't searching because nothing showed for me?
---
Ah. No, actually. At least what I could see, everyone was engaged. Granted, I stayed pretty close to the SBQ and barn. But, then, if they are crouched, I guess I wouldn't have seen them. That might be a suggestion... in active nuke zones and/or event perimeters... crouching doesn't hide you from other players. 
---
So it doesn't have to be near the center after the boundaries are determined?
---
1* legendaries are vendor trash to most players. It undercuts everything just as much as visiting vendor bots after nuked whitespring lol
---
I'm about 30 minutes in, my problem with it so far, is it seems to be "Hey here are all the changes I would make to make Fo76 a better single player game." 
---
The weight system is restrictive to force players to not only make decisions on what to carry, but what to keep as well. If the stash size was unlimited, no one would sell any legendary weapons and would just keep a massive pile in their stash, eliminating the only other current way of getting legendary gear via the few vendors that the players have been selling the gear to. 
---
Further the weight reduction perks IMHO is fine. Do you want to carry 100 stimpaks? fine. You are going to need to hand over some of those valuable perk points for them. It also lets you specialize your character for a role, but gives you enough flexibility to where you can have a few configurations for different situations that you can move in and out of without having to move points around. 
---
This seems to be where a lot of folks complain about Fo76, focusing on it like it's just another Fallout single player game, rather than with the understanding that it, as an MMO now, is going to have at least some characteristics of an MMO. As an MMO It's pretty good. Usually in an MMO such as Star Trek online, or Destiny 2, or pretty much any of the others out there, you have some light fluff of a story, that's been sprinkled with a ton of grinding, because areas/next story mission are level locked. 
---
This get's repetitive pretty quickly, in my experience. I got so bored with Destiny 2, not just on the leveling process, but also at the level cap on the whole idea that "hey here are your 7 daily missions that you are going to have to run every day for 2 hours or so because outside of PVP we don't really have anything else for you." Where as with Fo76 on my first toon I never felt the need to have to go and grind through hoards of enemies just to progress. Typically there is enough actual story missions that progressed properly with your leveling that you never had to really grind to continue to move forward, provided you explored as you went along.
---
Only once you are at Level 50, does anything close to grinding take place, and even then, at least for me, it isn't nearly as boring/grinding as other MMOs... Unless you want it to be. Some folks, all they want to do is run white springs and Nuke zones all day for gear. That's fine. I enjoy them as well. But I probably spend 80% of my time hunting for areas of the map I haven't discovered yet, lore that I might have missed on my first time through an area, or searching for plans.  
---
He does have some good points, however he seems to shy away from them in a way to change the game to be "more like X game." Rather than focusing on the why the current mechanic sucks and how to fix it in away that can actually be done with the way the game is currently structured. Best example of that is his complaints on weapon scraping. Change it so it tells us either what mods are left to learn from scrapping, or even just give us a number. "7 mods left to learn from scraping. 2 only from plans." would improve the scrapping process immensely. Or even just list all the mods on the weapons and have (Plans only) out to the side of the unlearned plans that can't be learned from scrapping. Boom, scrapping dynamic fixed. 
---
He is spot on with the VATS complaint though. It wasn't until level 40 that I revisited it, because of how it was introduced. Even if they had a tutorial with a nerf gun or something in the vault before you exited would have greatly changed my perception of the function.   
---
Deathclaws shoot the belly 
---
Radscorpians shoot the stinger or the legs 
---
Gutseys shoot the arms 
---
Mirelurks try to get the face when they run at you 
---
That being said I do actually like the idea of repairs giving a mod learn chance, based on how much you repair.
---
Thing is, why would griefers go to a server where it's a level playing ground?  Surely there is every incentive for them to stay on the 'pve' server and keep doing what theyre doing.  After all, pvpers who aren't into griefing lower levels will move to the pvp servers, leaving the adventure 'pve' servers with only non-pvpers and the griefers who like to grief them.
---
I had one stuck over my head yesterday and ran out of bullets. Really hard to time grenade explosions when you're tossing them mid-air.
---
Will be around 5pm CST, gotta work, a couple more years still.
---
Send me a message on XBL, and I'll join your game when I get on.
---
I had this same experience yesterday as well on Xbox. We were able to kill her with no real problems in the morning. Launched another nuke in the evening for round 2, using (mostly) the same squad weapons and could barely put a dent in her.
---
Was anything actually retconned though?
---
Just let people have them, who cares? Same as having a good CAMP site.
---
Maybe limit to 1 per person if people monopolize them. Maybe there's an increasing cost for each you claim.
---
Pretty sure that the level of PA you find is based on the location. I've seen many level 15 and 25 PA pieces on frames I found not far from Vault 76. I was in my 100s at the time too.
---
Supermutants - aim for the head
---
I just tame the random ones and they let me walk away
---
You‚Äôre the man broüëçüèª I wish I ran into someone like you when I first picked up the game. For the longest time I was running around in only the frame with no armor pieces attached to it üòÇ
---
Not positive, but I believe it‚Äôs like any other camp object and can be placed anywhere within the building zone.
---
Wife and I have to do the same thing but it slows down the flow when we have to constantly double load.
---
I haven't had a chance to watch the video yet, but on the subject of "developing towns", that was what I *really* liked about the settlement system in Fallout 4. Not just that you can build a house, but that you can build villages or even small towns and fill them with inhabitants who all have a purpose. That is the one aspect of the game that has provided the most replay value for me. 
---
Yep same here, scraps or caps 
---
3 was enough. Can't imagine 8!
---
Pleased that you appreciate them! Did you know the Nightbreed clip?
---
Biggest and most ANNOYING bug of all time is having players/friends go completely invisible, had a friend recently buy and play it with me, but we kept turning invisible to each other, made a REALLY bad first impression on the game and I honestly felt really embarrassed because it took a lot of convincing to get him to buy the game after the awful reviews :\
---

---
Same. Hard life for us to find a good rolling pin.
---
I never lock the resources in capped workshops for the sole reason that it might deter someone from taking the workshop in order to get to the resources. I mainly use the workshops for free fast travel, I'm not terribly sad when I miss 10 lead if that means I potentially could fast travel for free.
---
Ah bro you‚Äôre beached as.
---
What about gulpers?  I hate those things. 
---
By lamp, praise the Mothman!
---
Hard Bargain 3, Grape Mentat, &amp; Sweet Roll = 4860 caps
---
I imagine the remake would feature a spring button.
---
A pun about method acting just doesn‚Äôt seem appropriate... fantastic performance, not sure I could imagine anyone else in the role 
---
It sure isn't. That's an area most likely to have spawns caused by low level characters. Someone getting relatively close an hour before you go there. Boom low level PA. Server is dead late at night no one's been there for 3 hours? Boom max level PA 
---
The scrapping-learning process does seem weirder and weirder the more you think about it. If they don't want to change it a lot, just letting us take the mods off the weapons before scrapping so if, like you did, you find a mod on a weapon you want, take it off, put it on yours.
---
I still don't know if having a mod on a weapon you scrap raises the chance of getting that mod *shrug*
---
Now, as far as learning things from using a weapon for a while, if you just have it and shoot it but never fix it, yeah you might not figure out how to make a reflex sight. But if you're fixing it all the time like how often you have to fix things in fo76, then you might be putting it back together and think, 
---
"Hey, that mirelurk I killed the other day would have died much quicker if I had a quick way to sight in on it's face instead of looking down the scope. I didn't like getting a face full of crab claw that I got yesterday because I had to look down the sight. Let me try this..."
---
That's how I think it should work but that's just me.
---
FWIW, I'd heard there was a law in the US recently that said any text input fields (in games?) needed to support text-to-speech and voice-to-text. It's likely why many newer games opted out of basic chat support.
---
What really needs to happen is a company needs to create a module like Havok, Bink, pys-x that can be nailed on to any game during development.
---
That being said, there's a mod for that on the Nexus.
---
Dude, I can't read that.  Would you consider editing with punctuation?
---
Shoot Gutsy's in the thruster. Far more effective.
---
That came to mind. Workshops could be instanced maybe. (Spelling?)
---
Scorchbeasts have a weak spot on their belly also
---
I'd craft you raider or t45 if I could :( instead I'd help you get to garrahan and help you get the mats for your first set of excavator 
---
Yes, i always have at least a couple of workshops claimed. If thats the case i guess im not claiming anymore workshops. Even tho thats a weird mechanic, im relieved the game is not infested with hackers. Thanks.
---
I want a slice option
---
I don‚Äôt think they have any. They‚Äôre op cause they can heal when they hit you
---
I accidentally found that place when I was level 20 or so....with a scorch beast on me....yeah that wasn't fun.
---
I found their weakness. *They*'*re powerless without their heads*!
---
Nope, after you initially place if you can move it. The initial build boundary remains the same though.
---
Agreed. I wouldn't mind if there was some way for players to adjust the level of chellenge they face, but I'm pretty much in your situation (minus the kids). I would like a more *consistent* difficulty, though. Walking through an area only to discover that a lot of the enemies have respawned at a much higher level because some high-level player is nearby is really just annoying. 
---
No no no, YouTube said it was bad and had bugs. Do not try to think for yourself that‚Äôs not what reddit is about 
---
Idk how to edit
---
I think you're in luck for when you continue watching it, because he does spend a good amount of time on both how to encourage interaction between players more (like selling weapons as you said), but also how multiple systems in the game could be changed so that players can specialize more. I think you'll enjoy it.
---
Works with anything projectile from what I found out. I used a shotgun, 10mm, and a .308 rifle. 
---
People have said, bookshelves back to back

Really? Ive not had this issue with literally any other game on Ps4, strange.

Mirelurk Queen - Shoot the Spouts on its head and it can't fling corrosive acid around anymore.  Then destroy its legs.

Assaultron - Shoot the head to stop it from using its laser, then destroy its legs.
---
Yeah, the workshop PvP isn't just limited to the boundaries of your workshop. Those things generally aren't worth it. Just a way to take advantage of noobs that don't know how it works. Can even abuse the system to farm caps from someone if they don't server hop
---
Pedants'–Ø'Us always on the job.
---
I agree with the thruster
---
Oh please, the game is shit, Its a rant, not a suggestion to the devs.
---
You can give me all this useful info and I thank you for it, but I‚Äôm still going straight for the crotch.
---
After watching a few different streams over the weekend I found one guy trying to specifically pin down the new damage bugs. He was experiencing the same thing you are describing - shoot an enemy, health bar goes down, then back up. He gave up, other streamers had problems dealing damage to the SBQ as others have posted on here. 
---
I think the problem is there are a few different bugs for damage dealt and damage taken at the moment and it is all very inconsistent. Adrenal reaction and the adrenaline perk are definitely involved somehow. I don't think it's the same damage bug we had last time, but something is not right. It's impossible to pin down because the damage readings on the pip boy are all wrong as well. It's a complete mess tbh.
---
It‚Äôs clearly for stability. ‚ÄúWe will continue to monitor server stability an continue to make stash limit adjustments in a way that doesn‚Äôt negatively impact server performance‚Äù
---
How can you ignore it, it‚Äôs written on literally every update that increases stash limit, and is quoted everytime they mention a new increase coming.
---
It‚Äôs not oppressively limiting at all i have my stash at a comfortable spot. 150 of each crafting resource (Junk) leaves me with space for Ore (which smelts into junk but weighs significantly less as Ore form) while still leaving space for weapons/armour. I‚Äôve also got 2 power armour chassis and gunpowder stored, i don‚Äôt have an issue at all, any excess junk gets bulked an sold, there is enough room to play, the fact you‚Äôre a hoarder and can‚Äôt refrain from pressing E/A/X depending on the system, is nobodies fault but your own, and the severity of the limitation isn‚Äôt even the argument here, you just changed it to fit your narrative,
---
Anyway, games with limits;
---
Destiny
---
Destiny 2
---
Division
---
Ark
---
WoW
---
ESO
---
F76
---
Neverwinter
---
There‚Äôs more too, they‚Äôre just the first that spring to mind.
---
Weird... indeed 
---
OK thanks. And with that my bar is complete 
---
I'm always sad when someone just ignores me. Killed a wanted dude in a spacesuit about two weeks ago after an intense marksman/sniper-esque battle. He was about 8 levels below me, and dropped some really nice junk (I'm talking 15-20 of of the sweet stuff: lead/gears/springs/plastic, u name it). I've been in that position where all of these resources we're 'impossible' to accrue due to constantly repairing/crafting weapons/ammo/armor, so I immediatly felt bad for the dude. At that point I didn't really need it, and felt like this dude could've had an accidental wanted on his face (before patch) and was about to lose a lot of his day's work. So I wait patiently on his corpse with holstered weapons, heart-emoting, beckoning him. He walks up to me, thumbs up and walks away. I shoot at his bag and he turns around only to look briefly and resume his way to god knows where. I followed him some 2 minutes trying to get him to his stash, using mic and various gestures, but it was like I wasn't even there.
---
OP needs to subscribe to youtube talking heads and comment "I hate 76" on every video.
---
 This is the only way to purify his soul.
---
Can't wait to playtest this! Seriously thank you all for the responses! I am working on a C.A.M.P. build that will greatly benefit from this!
---
No not at all, you can move it anywhere you want, as people have said, I generally move it farthest away from the cliff, or try different areas, until you stop spawning down, you can also move it a little past the green radius .. you can even put your camp in your house and hide it if you want.
---
Agreed
---
The legendary loot thing must be the most infuriating.  I am playing FO4 again while the fix is needed.  
---
Killed a mirelurk queen only to have it disappear when I went to loot the body, it had reset and was back where it spawned. Also had  3 star legendary ghoul disappear when i went to loot it. both happened on saturday about 30 mins apart, a little frustrating to say the least.
---
The vendor bot at Lewisburg station sells the fusion generator plans for 200 caps. 
---
This subreddit is so back and forth. I post these exact issues, get downvoted to hell. Everyone tells me I'm just whining or complaining. Then someone else does it, upvoted. Then another person will say the same thing, downvoted to Oblivion. Can we just make up our minds?
---
+1 for scrochbeast.
---
My house is just windows. So I can shoot out of it. And I have a garage door that runs on it‚Äôs own generator so I can store it if I get attacked and it will not open until I open it. But I leave my one of my two purifiers open so that people can just take some water
---
That's awesome, I like this game a lot. Welcome to the FO76 community.
---
That being said, prepare to be downvoted by hordes of You*gargle,gargle*tuber fanboi's who ride the Bethesda hate bandwagon.
---
Because they're in cahoots with one another he gets several rewards, and all he did was repost a video?
---
That happened to me with a robot by the Phenoix vendor in Watoga.  I killed the legendary, and for a brief moment the weapon was laying on the ground by the body.  But when I hovered over to look at it, it immediately disappeared and showed up on the body.  Was very confusing.  It was just 1* trash, but still.
---
Well I still need to reach your level so if you need company, lol. I mostly just farm whitesprings to grind that xp right now till I get my build halfway decent.
---
Beat me to it.
---
"Internet high five!"
---
Pocketed Yes, Deep Pocketed is only from plans.
---
I went into the Wendigo cave scared to death of the wendigo.  Only to  get my arse handed to me multiple times by the fucking mirelurk kings.
---
Hate those things.
---
(Yesterday I was trying to do Dogwood Die Off and found one of the aerosolizers guarded by *eight* glowing mirelurk kings.  Much dying was done).
---
I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook, and by gum, it put them on the map!
---
All I can say is that most ban handed by Bethesda were deserved. Most people crying here on reddit are just cheaters who don't want to admit they fucked up.
---
Yeah you get rewarded essential plans for doing the beginning quests, I suggest you follow the main quest line as far as you can bear it, don't get distracted by the side quests as much, you will get various plans for food, water pumps, purifiers, Radaway recipes etc.
---
There is no mod for any helmet. They have no stats. Do you mean you unlocked a mod for crafting a combat armor helmet? I‚Äôd have to see a screenshot of that. 
---
The problem with any non-bonus-damage weak spots (especially if you don‚Äôt have a bonus limb damage weapon) is usually they‚Äôre nearly dead by the time you‚Äôve crippled that spot (Assaultron head, mirelurk queen spots, etc), you might as well have focused on spot that would kill them quicker. Usually if I disarm a bot, it‚Äôs already at like 15% health, I might as well have aimed for bonus damage and just killed it. 
---
I, and others that fast travel/login at my CAMP, materialize inside of the foundation block. Since I can't fast travel, I have to log out/in, and move before my CAMP appears. Moving the actual camp box does seem to move the spawn point, but there doesn't seem to be any pattern to it. I have yet to find an area to set the camp box, that will seem to work for me. I've moved it 22 times, in various places, and yet, people still spawn in the foundation blocks, even though there is PLENTY of open build space in the area.
---
I actually just watched the first part of the video. Man, being a developer or management and having a YouTuber hand you your ass catergoraically must be extremely demoralizing and insulting (assuming they didn‚Äôt know about any of this stuff which is highly unlikely)
---
I have gotten most from Treasure Digs, and a few (Combat Armor ones) from BOS Forbidden Knowledge.
---
Thanks for being honest and stating you don't understand programming or code. Hopefully, the responses aren't too brutal. 
---
Sort of like being nibbled alive.
---
Life Preservers give Rubber :)
---
Store all your junk and try again, there is a bug if you have junk on you, it won't let you craft. Also if you over weight, you hit max weight, you can't craft, you would need to be carrying around 1820lbs to hit max weight.
---
Like ive said, this is a rant, not a suggestion. If they could even fix this bullshit or gave a fuck to, they already wouldve. 
---
&gt; Although if he was innocent surely we would have heard something about it by now right. But the guy and Bethesda have on strangely silent. 
---
Not really BGS has been having a terrible track record on saying anything. They didn't say anything about the whole bag issue until lawsuits started being thrown around and major media groups were starting to report on it. So the fact that they haven't said anything about it isn't really a surprise.
---
As for you the whole "third party programs", you do realize that bethesda's twitter has retweeted screenshots of people using third party mods, such as the "perk loadout manager" which does give players using it an advantage. So this whole idea that using third party software to change how the game functions is against their rules seems sketchy at best. Because if they truly were against third party programs being used, they sure as hell wouldn't be sharing screenshots and links to the third party software themselves on twitter.
---
Make up goals.  Do the challenges, stuff like that 
---
Did you get pink eye though?
---
Well how can they listen to you if your post was removed due to your language
---
It‚Äôs called the mule curse. 
---
Lovely bugs. I'm guessing it has something to do with the non instanced loot of fo4 where items could drop. Like how sometimes mole miners will drop their weapon when you shoot it. I really love it when a scorched picks up a minigun off of a super mutant, becomes deadly and it was a barefist scorched so you get nothing for killing it
---
Literally the only time I‚Äôve been flagged for PvP (other than dicking around during the beta) was when I picked a lock on a crate near someone‚Äôs workshop. The tooltip said ‚ÄúPick Lock‚Äù, not ‚ÄúSteal‚Äù, and the contents of it were not in red text, yet by simply picking the lock, I ended up flagged with a 10 cap bounty on my head. 
---
The owner showed up and tried to kill me, probably thinking I was trying to damage his workshop. I admit the merry chase I led him on through the Mire with all sorts of hostile creatures joining in along the way was exciting, but I soon learned that the bounty would not expire on its own and required someone kill me to restore my reputation. I eventually fast travelled to the Overseer‚Äôs Camp, took off all my armor, and waited for a newbie to come along and score some quick caps and atoms for their first PvP kill. 
---
It was an interesting diversion, but something that could have been avoided completely had the game been more clear about what flags you for PvP and not having any system in place for reducing your bounty other than having another player come along to claim it. I don‚Äôt mind the bounty system on PvE servers, but there should be some sort of PvE method of reducing your bounty, whether it decays over time or being able to pay off your bounty to compensate for damages. 
---
Mothman is a famous cryptid. 
---
The presence of Cryptids/West Virginia Monster Lore is one of my favorite parts of this game. 
---
It's actually a thing..?
---
My recent stories played out like this:
---
I was a lvl 6 standing on a car surrounded by a pack of level 10 rabid wolves (4-6 of them). Slowly clearing them out, but in danger nonetheless, I hear some gunshots and start seeing these dogs die. A level 33 had come to my rescue. I emoted thanks in his direction and he went on his merry way!
---
2nd story. I'm running around the Top of The World as a lvl 40 with no PA. I see a 3-Star Legendary super mutant (lvl 68). I fire at him - Never have fought a 3-star before. And a fairly hefty group of lvl 68 super mutants pop out and start chasing me. I'm running away and I see a level 49 with PA and a super sledge. This poor guy didn't see what was coming. I run right by him, screaming. This guy took on the power mutants like a champ, killing every single one of them. I once again emoted my thanks and never saw him again.
---
Fallout 76 is amazing.
---
I did get a plan for a prime crossbow receiver from a scorchbeast last week, but that's basically the only thing worth anything that I got.
---
Damage health bug got alot worse since the patch. Idk what it is but it seems like there are error registering the hits and therefor it bugs. I had to use twice the ammo yesterday night. Its soo bad..
---
I havent had issues with infinite loading and loot dissapearing, but i know what the "ninja looting" is.
---
Theres an inventory for enemies when they are alive and when they die. What you saw was the Alive loot and it switched to corpse loot.
---
Legendaries are totally bugged in general so this needs a big big fix anyways. 
---
As others have said you can experiment with moving your CAMP unit. A lot of headache could be solved if we could just get a simple CAMP fast travel mat like in the workshops.
---
Fought a hermit crab in the swamp....disappeared,  big shock, I know.
---
Is this a PC thing?  I'm on PS4. No idea  how to do this. 
---
Remove Adrenal, reapply it with a newly made serum. I just did last night (got lucky on removing mutations with rad-away, only lost 1 other mutation first on my main; lost 2 on my alt.)
---
The actual damage works; the tooltip might be bugged but honestly, it‚Äôs always been bugged, people just weren‚Äôt paying attention to it until the last patch. But I don‚Äôt care about the tooltip, I care about my weapon damage
---
But what if... I were to take skyrim's major boss enemy.. and disguise it as my own invention!
---
Oh ho ho ho! Delightfully devilish, bethesda.
---
I think all of us ran into the same mole rat. I was having this exact same issue as well.
---
So far so good with my fluke dupe so I would say you should be fine. Now if you had 10,000 Excavator sets... well, banned you go, haha!
---
Uhhhh.... your camp is a stash box?
---
These are the issues keeping me away from the game. 
---
Post a want ad on r/fo76bazaar or check this out 2 left https://www.fo76items.com/fallout-76-weapons?server=3249&amp;p_name=Instigating
---
Mirelurks, just avoid the shell and scorched beasts is also headshots
---
Grahm follows a semi-predictable route and he will attack any hostiles he comes across.  So no, this isn't a scripted event.  You got lucky to have Grahm there at the same time as you. üòâ
---
&gt; It‚Äôs clearly for stability.
---
Then how about you don't wheel out the bullshit like:
---
Clearly this has nothing to do with it.
---
&gt;How can you ignore it, it‚Äôs written on literally every update that increases stash limit, and is quoted everytime they mention a new increase coming.
---
And yet you felt free to ignore it and spin up the 'If you could stash everything you wouldn't grind' reasoning.
---
&gt;the severity of the limitation isn‚Äôt even the argument here, you just changed it to fit your narrative,
---
It was literally your argument, or have you forgotten what you put? Get a grip.
---
&gt;Anyway, games with limits;
---
&gt;Destiny Destiny 2 Division Ark WoW ESO F76 Neverwinter
---
One of these things is not like the others.
---
Rightfully suspended here...but can we get a "road map" on how long this suspension will last? üòÇüòÇ
---
I didn't do any of the removing/adding as others have posted and mine is fine. I Just waited and after a few sessions it seemed to sort itself out. It doesn't display correctly in the pip  boy but you can check it is still working by getting low health, check your damage output on any weapon, take a rad-x and you will see your damage output go down as the mutation effect is suppressed. It is worth noting that they have stealth nerfed it though. Also do not use strange in numbers, it is bugged.
---
Still waiting to find out, I have 7 of them.
---
Really depends on if it's a "polishing up" scenario like Skyrim got, or an essentially new game in s different engine.
---
&gt;You buy a ticket and a sentry bot "gently" suplexes you into a small crate.
---
FTFY
---
I would support this, but in most cases people should just be using a mic.
---
And.. not put in any mechanic to reliably replicate fus ro dah...
---
I'm not giving up my legendary 3 star rolling pin for anything. 
---
Had a similar issue last night on PS4.
---
Was sniping King Mirelurks and Supermutants over at Braxon's in the Mire.
---
Every time I would dial in a shot they'd either take no damage or chip damage (mind you I'm in full sneak and have the Mr Sandman perk).
---
Really pissed me off. 
---
1* bloodied are awesome, more powerful than explosive if you run low health, and they won‚Äôt kill myself in close range when explosive weapons killed me way more times than monsters did. 
---
I'm getting tired of this getting posted by the same group of people over and over... anyway we / you can make a sticky thread , so we don't get so much rehashed spam?! 
---
With that being said, they should go the Elite dangerous route and offer solo / private queue with the survival mode offering unique and or better rewards , such as workshops et cetera.  As workshops would need to be turned off in 'offline ' mode 
---
Zealots does work against SB, I just tested this a few days ago with a Zealots sniper vs a non-legendary sniper, same mods.
---
That's not this Subreddit's fault, that's just Reddit in a nutshell.
---
Agree on the lack of perk card to reduce rifle weight. This drives me nutty as they weight like 17 pds typically. 
---
Has anyone tried firing it off the monorail or off the top of a cliff hundreds of yards away and below them?
---
üëèüëèüëè
---
No rules against it. It's just very, very odd.
---
It's one of the areas that have good enemy spawn rates, xp and gear rewards and higher level players spawn higher level enemies.
---
I always look at the map before I zone in at the Clubhouse to make sure I'm not indirectly murdering a lower level because of my farming schedule
---
Would be easier to throw the game into a more current build than build a new engine for 3 to use.
---
Throw it into FO4's engine.  It should translate well enough.
---
Do events till you get that 0.02% chance outfit drop.
---
also Prime specifically states Scorched *and* scorchbeasts
---
Ah.  As others have said, place the armor and enter it should work.  It's similar to teleporting through a wall by activating a workbench on the other side of a window.
---
everytime i load in my camp im inside a mountain
---
Its a good game, glad your enjoying it.
---
Are you on Pc or console? 
---
Yeah. Just like I said. I didn't know. I'm sure re-writing code would be the cleaner and harder way to do it but schedule pressure keeps these shortcuts happening. It's the same where I work. Everyone always wants to take shortcuts rather than taking the extra time to do things right. I'm not implying that they're doing it wrong in this case. Just saying the people I work with are lazy and I see this as becoming the trend for the world in general today. I've been working since I was 14 (I'm 32 now) and I've always been a hard but smart worker. It just seems everywhere I look everyone just wants money handed to them and they don't want to earn it. I guess this is true even in the gaming industry as well (not referring to the devs here but more the publishers who impose the ridiculous pressure for output quickly). My point being quantity over quality
---
Yeah 1* can be useful. Having SB drop 1* items wouldn't be anything game breaking though. You'll still be better off with nukesprings 
---
No armor near me as I said
---
I don't see your point of view, but I respect it!
---
I'm tired of giving the deed to my CAMP to vendorbots to get rid of my 1* wood legs.
---
Also, join a team, leave world, "play with team" should fix it and bring you back to that world
---
You need 10 of the unstable violet flux
---
I use it on a zealot‚Äôs gun for queen and sometimes SB fights. So far I‚Äôve been able to keep it fed just fine. 
---
I don‚Äôt use it on anything weaker though (well, sometimes trash during the queen fight, since they‚Äôre all scorched and melt fast to Zealots Prime 50cal spray)
---
I second this...
---
But if the bot is in a group, their self destruct can help with splash damage
---
No.  Place your own armor out onto the car.  Then enter it.
---
Clearly this guy who has had the game for all of 2 days needs to be saved from the corruption and sedition of the online hate train. Stay blissfully ignorant and also don't you dare come back here in 3 weeks with a post like 'I have done/seen everything and now I am bored'.
---
Remember, if the consensus is that a triple-A live service game is bad the actual answer is that everyone else is just wrong.
---
Mutated Fern turns into Flash Fern when in a nuke zone.
---
Do you have Flash Fern? I see u said ‚ÄúMutated Fern‚Äù so I‚Äôm asking just in case that is what you‚Äôre trying to use.
---
Shotgun + enforcer = any animal, break it‚Äôs legs and then hit it with a hammer. 
---
Protectrons (as said in another post) break it‚Äôs arms. Also if you hit them right in the lower torso where the legs connect sometimes they just drop dead instantly. 
---
Assault trons, break its head, legs and arms.
---
Gutsy break the thruster, or all its arms.
---
(Doing the above will cause them to self destruct)
---
Sentrybots can over heat and expose their fusion cores but, if that‚Äôs not an option, take out their arms, one or two legs, and stay close (not two close) to avoid the Mordor they sometimes have.
---
Mierlurks - shoot the face
---
But, a crap shotgun and the enforcer perk will stop just about everything in its tracks. As good as the fallout 4 crippling 10m auto pistol.
---
Ok, thank you for the info. I will try this when I get back on.
---
Not reeeaaaallly? The some of the Brotherhood lore was, I guess?
---
Super mutants head shot - "owww my head hurts!" Splat! Lol
---
No they don't and even if they did most others games like this have text chat so get in line or stop making games. 
---
It's actually both, the Splattercannon was just easiest to get w/o high Charisma.
---
All power plants if you power up the fusion core processor. They all have one 
---
If you cripple both legs of a ghoul they instantly die. Doesnt matter what kind or what level. Tormentor and a couple stealth gausse shots blow off both their legs with ease.
---
Also if you cripple one leg on a deathclaw or wendigo, they cant do their charge/lunge attack.
---
Also also: crippling both legs of a super mutant is just funny, especially if they dont have a gun. Then they just give you a really dirty look while you walk up and crush their heads with a super sledge.
---
I NEEEEEEED IITTT!
---
Yeah I had that one a couple nights ago. A team dropped the bomb on Fissure Prime while I was in the neighborhood, so I dropped by and helped out. I killed tons out of the mob and layed into the SB Queen pretty good, but every other Scorched Snallygaster and Angler that appeared would take tons of hits from All Rise to kill.   
---
Another weird thing that happened was I was taking little to no damage, and my weapons would last forever, then break after the fight. The server was clearly lagged badly and trying to catch up, and I believe that was the source of the spongy enemies. It's like your local client registers the hit, then tries to reconcile with the server (that is clearly behind) and the server wins.   
---
"Nope, you may say you killed that monster but my records show he is at full health". 
---
What? Nooo no way. Bethesda would not have made 2 unique guns with the same legendary modifier that's just silly. :P
---
There is a way to make the Assaultron Head work properly.
---
After equipping the weapon, drop/store all of your Fusion Cells, then pick them up again.  It will work properly after that until you store/drop your Head again.
---
Properly working, you can reload up to 5 times and charge up the head, firing an unimpressive blast that irradiates you.  (+49 per charged blast).  I heard you don't get irradiated for Legendary versions.  But the damage is still unimpressive.
---
You're taking their work as actors, and the actor unions do not fuck around. 
---
As I just said I don't have any armor on me or near me
---
Roadmap looks pretty cool
---
Was in a queen fight and killed four 2-3 star legendary creatures and only 1 gave me an item and the rest were loading forever. And since I was looking for Bloodied weapons of course the one legendary I get the game gives me a Bloodied level 20 walking cane
---
Scrapped.
---
Legendary.
---
Okay buddy.
---
Let the guy poo in peace
---
Yeah, the stuff they talked about before release sounded cool too.
---
Ran into him twice yesterday. :)
---
It was/is Mutated Fern. I think that's the problem. I need to located Flash Fern in the zone. Is that what I'm reading? Flash Fern is the mutated version of Mutated Fern?
---
Yes, it seems prime receiver plans can drop from the lvl 80 versions(?) but I don't think they exist in the level 50 version loot tables.
---
I'm not impressed with the Prime Receiver plans though.
---
Console, playin on the One X. 
---
Yeah, when you loot a nuke mutated plant it has a different name and you get unstable flux of the specific color. Make sure you have the chemist perk on and super duper to maximize your production of the stable flux.
---
Also, don't forget to equip the Green Thumb perk when harvesting plants to get double the flux.
---
Same. I had a couple new friends help me nuke White Springs and sure enough, the very first to join the adhoc party was not visible. Kinda makes it hard to clear out the silo when you can't see your team mates. 
---
Or sold it... either way it's  gone... And I needs advice where I could possible have a way of getting it back. By playing btw no buying...
---
&gt; And sometimes I'll fall, rubberband back up to the top, and fall again
---
Need video of this, it sounds hilarious, like something out of Looney Toons.
---
I was suspisious as I surely would have noticed it, repairing weapons over and over. So I checked, and no, it doesn't apply to guns.
---
Nukesprings can be a hit or miss now. A few times there were zero ghouls spawned at the club house, just empty. A bunch of guys kept popping back to see if they could trigger a spawn. Nada nothing. I ran into several occasions like that after latest patch. Never seen it before. 
---
Positivity. I dig it. Glad to hear you are enjoying the game with many of us!
---
I like this, definitely would make me happier to declutter my inventory and find out what's really weighing so goddamn much.
---
That's ignoring the problem rather than actually fixing it.
---
Much like buying a concert or movie ticket online, you should have a placeholder time where every thirty seconds the game checks to see if you're still on the same server or if you're disconnected. If after thirty seconds the game is like "wtf where is this player?" because of an inevitable crash or DC, it holds your place on that server for five minutes. If after five minutes from the last time the game checked and saw you were no longer on that server, and you start playing again, it should then put you on a new server. But if you are able to re-connect within that five minute window (router resets, short power outages/surges, weird crashes where you have to restart your pc or console, etc.) the game will check to see what server placeholder you had, and boom, put you back where you were. It would also prevent people from just insta-logging because they're afraid of a fight. Sure, you can insta-log, but the real-time penalty of five minutes for running away from one of the mechanics of the game should prevent people from just dodging like that. I've seen several griefers realize they're outmatched after destroying a camp or three who just then instalog, never to be heard or seen from again, leaving people who were just playing to rebuild the pieces with no manner of recourse. At least knowing that a griefer has to sit and twiddle their thumbs for a while is some consolation. Hell, make it so if you log out of a server, it takes 10 minutes - it would also prevent people from server-hopping to find a nuke to just piggy-back off other peoples' hard work (guilty).
---
Please. 
---
Like I'm also wondering,  did yea all just buy game without reading up on it? It's not like pvp was a hidden feature they just sprang on everyone.. 
---
I have given up trying to loot anything other than the queen because they are all loading loops and I don't want to focus on waiting for loot when I should be shooting the queen.
---
THE GAME CANT BE BROKEN BECAUSE THEY MADE A ROADMAP! 
---
Check the Roadmap, Legendary Vault dwellers is gonna be something like you want.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/
---
One of the main reasons I'm not playing right now. :(
---
Build a joke base. Explore new locations. Hunt the flatwoods monster. Do events. Pick a new costume, roleplay that outfit.
---
If you are looking for legendary gear, people suggest whitesprings. I also like "horde" events. They usually have a legendary spawn.
---
After you launch the nuke, there are still things to do. They just aren't as well highlighted. Most locations have a quest to do. Daily and event quests pop up from time to time.  I started a new character to go shotgun/melee for a change from the sneaky sniper. 
---
Same but never got very long.  I would think if it was a problem with your rig that you‚Äôd get shitty frame rates everywhere.  You are getting 50 or 60 most places and then it drops around certain areas right?  
---
I did get your friend request ... just didn‚Äôt realize Chambee was you lol!
---
Try crippling their legs.
---
It didn‚Äôt occur to your blindly loyal self that it took 2 hours of concise explanation to explain everything wrong with the game?
---
As someone with 170 levels between to characters, I enjoy the game. Bugs become more obvious as you spend more time and get to higher levels. The nature of how obvious they become is multiplied when playing with other people.
---
I love the game, I wished more resources and man hours were put into fixing it.
---
Why would they add clans when we can organize and socialize on our own outside of the game? :P lol give us factions, faction tab that works like the friends tab. If we can't join the Brotherhood of steel we'll make our own! And it'll be bigger and better than that west coast nonsense and elder maxson isn't allowed!
---
Love the name, BioShock is the best.
---
most games will not have text chat after 2019, see also: anthem
---
Dude bioshock is so awsome 
---
Well I haven't moved my C.A.M.P. in over like 3 patches. I can confirm the spawn point remains the same - how it determines it I'm not sure, but it does stay in the same spot. 
---
I have my base near vault 76, across the river pass the Overseer's camp just south of the Abandoned Cabin, there's a small dock with a fishing rod - that's where I always spawn. It was convenient early game since the fishing rod yields decent crafting mats. 
---
Oh.  Well that's something you really need to change.  You ALWAYS want to have a suit of power armor on you.  It's only 10 lbs.
---
Welcome, and enjoy.
---
Just dont appear to like it too much.
---
;)
---
You got taste üòÇüëå
---
I bought them from the vendor in Camden Park but found the mod at the BOS vendor in Watoga. 
---
Fallout 76 is basically the game we all played as kids before we had video games: Walk around, build a gun out of rock and sticks, and pretend to shoot monsters. That's why the game strikes a chord with so many of us.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this will help people but, i just recently realized this and tested it multiple times. Maybe it will help you find your loot. 
---
So more often than not when the body suddenly vanishs, the game is doing something really strange and putting it back where it spawns are somewhere along the path it would have taken to get to you. 
---
I found that the queen will poof but her ‚Äúmeat pile‚Äù will randomly spawn around the rest of the piles and sometimes spawn way the fuck out in the nuke zone, along the path she was flying. This warping dead is easy to test and see in the BOS asylum base. You can kill some gouls, watch them vanish and find their bodies on the floor above or in their spawn location. Hope this helps
---
Watoga EMS, Harper‚Äôs Ferry, AWOL Armaments event, West Tek, Huntersville occasionally, Watoga Civic Center, Whitesprings maybe, SBQ. You could get the drop by farming those places in a circular motion or farming one spot in particular. Good luck. 
---
look I get the enthusiasm, but the past 100 days of having this game have sorta shown otherwise
---
I like the roadmap but I won't be excited about any of it until it's actually out. How many patch notes back have they said "Coming in a future update" and still haven't, like basic energy weapon rebalancing? 
---
It's fun for a while and I hope you enjoy but don't expect anything from them until it's literally released
---
Yeah it is objectively.  Subjectively though it's still a half assed coded game with a variety of quality errors (typos most noticeably) and many bugs are still present, the players still playing have just gotten used to them is all.
---
Yesterday I experienced phantom build budget...  Huh, actually yesterday was just that really.  Disconnects, they say servers are 300% more stable, feels more like 3000% since I didn't disconnect once the last few days.
---
But many things are still iffy, energy weapons, pvp is still broken badly.  Base building is still a hassle.
---
Objectively better, subjectively still a crap on the Fallout IP.
---
But dammit they are tasty
---
Flash Fern is the mutated/nuke version of Mutated Fern.
---
You require Flash Fern for your violet flux.
---
It‚Äôs bright purple and usually found growing in the shade under trees.
---
hope this was the answer you needed!
---
I don't even bother with her anymore. I've logged in four times with 30+ minutes and there are 6-15 people there fighting her and she will not go below 80% health. I just know that if she was downed and I crashed I'd probably stop playing the game again. I took a solid two weeks off an uninstalled  a while back. The clean re-install and the new patches actually helped the performance of the game regarding crashes by probably 95% but after over a hundred crashes since the beta ended and the game deleting my legitimately obtained TSE shotgun when I completed one of the Mistress of Mystery questlines, I'd probably stop playing again. SUPER frustrating. That sucks. 
---
Thank you kindly :)
---
Get real, it takes violet flux to install that. 500 caps would be a decent asking price. 
---
The question was the limitation on storage and why it‚Äôs present, since you want an unlimited stash but that‚Äôs so unfeasible, even with the reasoning explained you‚Äôre still ignorant to it.
---
I repeat it‚Äôs clearly for stability, stability ties into more than just server performance, you‚Äôre aware of that right?
---
Balance is relevant to the economy, see trading, caps, and valuation of items again if players had hundreds and thousands of rare items, economy gone.
---
Balance is also the line where there is a risk and reward, a chance to lose and win. Again, ties into stash weight and amount of items stored/carried by players. Do you play any PvP games at all? 
---
Balance - is stability, like i said.
---
Unlimited stash = clogged data.
---
Clogged data = slow servers.
---
Slow servers with more clutter = crashes.
---
Crashes = Disconnects.
---
Disconnects = Frustration/complaints.
---
It really, REALLY isn‚Äôt rocket science or a hard concept to grasp. Clearly it has everything to do with it.
---
My argument wasn‚Äôt the stash weight, it‚Äôs WHY it exists since people, want it removed when it can‚Äôt happen.
---
Ignored it? I‚Äôve acknowledged it during this ENTIRE discussion, again changing your narrative, it‚Äôs right. If you had no stash limit you could spend an hour or two getting so much of a specific item/resource you wouldn‚Äôt need to worry for a long time, that‚Äôs not being a survival game is it? (Which is what this is after all)
---
The game isn‚Äôt the argument again, it‚Äôs the case of WHY limitations exist, and what other games they exist on to further iterate the point.
---
You need an education, spinning narratives and being evasive just invalidates any point you‚Äôve attempted to originally make.
---
It really is, super addicting as well once you get to grinding for legendary stuff. 
---
I agree, or at the very least actually make pacifist mode actually that? I don't pvp, and got to my experience my first greifer the other day (mini nuke to the face while I was base building). Personally, I say what'd be the best way to combat greifers, than NOT giving them their just rewards? Congrats, you just wasted a mini nuke to do NOTHING! Well, I did help free up from weight from you there buddy, have a gwave and be on your way.
---
I personally don't pvp, but would actually enjoy it if bounties, and dying felt SUPER important. If the pvp servers resulted in a more realistic experience, say permadeath ("if he dies, he dies") type of game play, I feel this could make things VERY interesting. You want teaming up/grouping elements on a pvp server? There you go.
---
When every shot can kill someone, roaming bands of PC raiders/protection groups could be a thing. Greifers wouldn't be so common place, or rather it'd be a challenge for them. When you take the time to kill someone, intentionally for kicks, KNOWING there is a consequence for doing so (you've literally taken a virtual life, not just their junk), it'd put it a MASSIVE bounty on their heads. Survive the countdown timer of your bounty and you're free. Make it so that timer extends to other pvp servers, and ONLY ticks down while they're actively playing. Boom, bounty hunter players would come out of the wood works.
---
Basically, if we TRULY separate the two, and give not only the pve side it's new content in the form of monsters/dungeons and the like, but added a server for people who TRULY like the EXTREME survival mode, hell, I don't pvp, but I would play that in a heartbeat (until it's stopped by some bored griefer who just needed to make weight so he could fast travel to his own camp).
---
Build your base outta the concrete foundations. Theres a way to stack them, and they are indestructible.
---
Could not find any info anywhere so thanks again
---
I got the BOS Legs from a Treasure Dig &amp; Chest from Forbidden Knowledge, but have yet to find the Arms plan.
---
I never used power armor in the older ones and i still won't lol
---
Why can't vats target based on aim point ? Nothing more annoying than fighting scorch beasts but every time you want to aim at their body parts it targets the random player standing next to you.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about him. Everyone‚Äôs biased. It‚Äôs the nature of opinions. We may not realize it, but our preferences are affected by way too many things for anyone to develop an opinion that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbiased.‚Äù Anyone who throws bias into an argument is just trying to invalidate your opinion.
---
What if we could pay for a dedicated server? For like 12 or 24 hours. Maybe an option for the atom shop?
---
Yeah, fucking raiders!!
---
Well people need to pick up all their shit. The more unlooted meat piles the laggier it gets. Everytime my loot lags I run around and pick up shit and drop it in a container and then my loot loads.
---
Yeah.. I think nuke zones should have tuned up respawns and reset the timer on all events in it. You can force respawns by having a friend quit game and rejoin the server. I find it ridiculous that those sorts of things are necessary. If you clear out each area in any nuke zone then go back to the first it should respawn for you. Just wait though. They'll "fix" forcing respawns and make sure nuke zones that last one hour are worth one spawn of mobs.
---
The Powerhouse installs Calibrated Shocks on T51b for 400 caps per leg. 
---
Eh hard to say, most of us had to between inventory management and dealing with grinding, upgrading, building, exploring, and farming, but with 800 stash space and disconnects being gone, you might have a faster experience.
---
If you don‚Äôt try to farm for top tier weapons, the game is pretty fun. 
---
This also started happening to me during gameplay periodically no matter where I'm at. It seems like intense battles seem to trigger it and after it triggers I need to reboot the game. It has happened when entering the White resort from day one.
---
The only time I have had any odd issues kinda like mobs fast healing/not dying is if the area i loaded into is very unstable/slow. If the legendary drop is not present, its in another one loot pile in my experience, I SUSPECT that it might have to do with the AI trying to swap out for other weapons as the Super mutants do this, they do pick up weapons from other dead mutants, but in this case its a bug.
---
The game is fun, but beware of raiders. They will hurt you and your base if found. 
---
good catch; perhaps the NPC's took it, explains all
---
Yeah, we failed the event at 70% of her life but we kept fighting and finally got the loots.
---
Yep, instant suicide for me 
---
Goddamnit Beth, get your shit together. üòãü§£
---
Thank you bro I‚Äôll check it out. Yes Watoga and Harpers Ferry sometimes have the mods but I didn‚Äôt know the mods‚Äô schematics even exist üëç 
---
Happened last night everytime
---
Mickeyphree if u ever want to team up
---
Can confirm, randomly had Corpse Flower Stamen in my inventory at one point.
---
I wish they'd revert feed the people...
---
I can understand your reasoning, but build a set of excavator armor for use when you are:
---
a. over encumbered and want to fast travel
---
b. mining minerals (excavator gives more yield)
---
c. want to jump off a building / cliff / monorail elevator
---
d. stuck next to a car
---
Wow. Yep, broken. That's stupid. 
---
I am wondering if this is only an issue with the dasy cutter because I have a two shot fatman with a mirv and it hasn‚Äôt killed me in this way yet. Good to know though. I‚Äôm going to start paying attention. 
---
Hello, 
---
I know exactly what you are looking for: [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6144698&amp;d=sb2sg2e60c72i12s12a72a82s72l92l22l71p10eh2&amp;w=&amp;n=EZ%20Game) 
---
\#Explanation
---
If you play casual the best thing you can do for damage is to have power-armor and any two-hander (the more damage per hit the better, speed doesn't matter as much). Also make throwing knives, steel is the most common resource available you can and should literally throw it away, might as well kill enemies while you throw it. Throwing knives own enemies from level 1 to about lvl 40. 
---
Ergo you don't even need damage orientated perks, instead I recommend utility.
---
\#Explanation per attribute
---
* Strength - as a side note, power armor ups your strength to 11 if you have less, that's why pa + melee is so good with minimal investment.
---
   * Traveling Pharmacy is amazing, you can carry around hundreds of stimpacks, plus you will see the amazing synergy with other perks down the list.
---
   * Blocker is amazing, this plus power armor you can ignore deathclaws, yaoi guai, landed scorched beasts etc.
---
* Perception - I don't like perception, if you get green thumb from a card pack it's quite good to have equipped.
---
* Endurance
---
   * good doggy is amazing, 3 canned dog food gives you full hunger, you find enough dog food be not need any other food item, this one perk has you covered from level 1 to end game and beyond.
---
   * Fire proof is amazing, this plus power armor you can ignore flying scorched beasts, your own explosives etc.
---
* Charisma
---
   * Lone wandered is amazing, this plus power armor you can ignore &lt;insert any enemy here&gt; etc. helps you do more power attacks (you are using a two-hander right?), run more when encumbered etc.
---
* Intelligence
---
   * Batteries not included is amazing, pick up any fusion cores you find (you are using power armor right?).
---
   * First aid is amazing, all the stimpacks you can carry around with traveling pharmacy will be much better, a normal stimpack can give you 90% full hp
---
* Agility
---
   * Action boy/girl is amazing, helps you do more power attack, run more when encumbered etc.
---
   * Born survivor is amazing, the hundreds of stimpacks that heal you for 90% each will now automatically activate by themselves, you will not die... ever. Pure casualness here, if you take my advice on anything, take this perk to max. I know this function already exists as a mod for legendary armor, or a normal mod for power armor, those version do spare you 3 points of perks, but they aren't as good as the perks, and you might not find them early game.
---
   * Thru-hiker is amazing, you can carry hundreds of bottles of purified water and dog food cans.
---
* Luck 
---
   * Pharma Farma is amazing, you need it in order to get hundreds of stimpacks so you can be immortal, also it's good money to sell the extra chems you get this way.
---
   * Luck of the Draw is amazing, you will never need to repair your weapons\* again.
---
   * Starched genes is amazing, if you are not a marsupial, you are playing the game wrong. I don't care what anyone says. You can have other mutations as well if you want, just stay away from emphatic, it makes you very vulnerable while solo, and if you are casual, you will be solo.
---
Imagine having to loop the ws run 100 times to get a AA rolling pin from a 3* lego  :(
---
Yeah. I'm fairly certain that Knight is supposed to be olive green, like Brandis wore in Fallout 4  
---
yeah its pc sorry
---
I have random spawns in about three locations near my CAMP, one of them inside a hill.
---
That describes it perfectly, thank you. I'm farming the wrong version of the plant. I'll hit up a zone tonight and at least locate/see it so I know what I'm looking for. 
---
I have plenty of GM and HRF (&gt;24 each)
---
Hardened Mass is the tough one to get. I have 8 thru 4 WS zone trips. I'll keep grinding.
---
Be safe out there...or not!
---
Thank you for confirming.  So is there a vendor that consistently sells these plans?
---
&gt; since you want an unlimited stash but that‚Äôs so unfeasible, even with the reasoning explained you‚Äôre still ignorant to it.
---
I literally never said this. Now YOU are moving the goalposts 'W-w-well stability is also gameplay. Ignore what I said about it clearly being for server performance.'
---
You are just spewing absolute shit to try and dig yourself out of a hole where you have tried to play both sides of an argument.
---
&gt;Servers need to be stable, gameplay needs to balanced.
---
&gt;Stash and weight limitations do this role.
---
Ah yes, that exceptional important gameplay balance that is 'server stability'
---
&gt;It‚Äôs clearly for stability. ‚ÄúWe will continue to monitor server stability an continue to make stash limit adjustments in a way that doesn‚Äôt negatively impact server performance‚Äù
---
It's *clearly* for that. Oh wait, no it's for making the gameplay balanced. Wait no, it's actually to keep the servers up. No wait, it's just for everything. Yep, that's it.
---
Blind seldom means "black screen", like most people think. Some people are like that, but most have vision so bad they cannot do much. Extreme nearsightedness is common. A big screen, thick glasses, and some helper elements make computer use and gaming possible for these people. 
---
Oh to bad I would if given you a welcome kit if you were on pc 
---
Yesterday I was transferring ammo to my stash and noticed all my .308 was missing. 
---
I panicked thinking I‚Äôd dumped it somewhere.
---
Nope. When I got out of the stash transfer view and into pip boy ammo inventory it was still there, but it was divided into 2 unequal stacks. 
---
When I drew my rifle, I noticed that the ammo count was not the combined count. It was one of the stacks.
---
I have no idea wth this is about.
---
Trust me, my shop's grand opening this last weekend was a huge success. That's not the problem. What this guy needs is a sales pitch and an ad. 
---
The have not made of free....
---
And dont thank them for it lol.
---
This is content that should have been here on launch die this price. 
---
I hope they will just allow local host and get lost at this point
---
Someone give this guy a medal for their patience.
---
I'm coming here from Red Dead. 
---
The level of support this game gets is *unreal* compared to how R* is treating their players.
---
I am lvl 120ish and I have only had convo with 4 people so far....oddly they where all girls so I do not know what to make of that.
---
I'm at 140+ and still haven't launched a nuke yet. I just spend most the time walking around looking for plans. I hope what they posted on the roadmap will renew the game for everyone 
---
[Technical Debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) I think is what you mean.
---
best idea I have read in months
---
Big facts
---
They are also a 1st party Microsoft studio now,  I doubt they will ever make a multi-platform game again, the exception being xbox-pc
---
I've never seen any Deep Pocketed plans at a vendor, most come from Treasure Digs.
---
I have now played the game (all weekend) and feel like I‚Äôve given it a fair shake. The first 5 or so levels I wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked it, I‚Äôll be honest. I really regretted buying it. I pushed through a little and now I‚Äôm at level 14. I‚Äôm really glad I did because I‚Äôm hooked. Sure there are a few small bugs here and there, but overall it‚Äôs really not that. What Bethesda have done is just, yet again amazing. It‚Äôs so dynamic, so full of content, and it keeps me coming back for more.
---
 I‚Äôd say the hate it received is conceivable, but I wish people would give it a chance. I‚Äôve already made a few friends and 95% of people you run across are good people. I‚Äôve already had like three people just randomly give me stuff to help me out. The PVP environment does very little to take away from the Fallout experience. In my opinion, it opens things up and feels almost like something was missing this whole time. 
---
I only spent $40 on this game, but it‚Äôs worth the $60 full price. I honestly give this game a 10/10. Love it.
---
Hosted servers will eventually exist, they have said so from the very beginning. Expect it 4th quarter this year if they keep on top of their timeline
---
You can't. But thankfully someone put together a list. Just filter the spreadsheet to isolate the mods that can be learned by plans only. Link[](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/)
---
Ok
---
Hmm I assumed that was only a problem when money was involved. If you‚Äôre making something and not selling it I assumed it was ok 
---
It's the experience not the destination.
---
What is an "accessible length" to you? 10, 15 minutes? 
---
You say you're not saying he should dumb it down... But that's exactly what cutting the time would do. There's a reason it's as long as it is.
---
If you would rather be playing video games, why even bother caring that it's too long to "access"? You don't like commentary, so don't bother with it. I don't like country music. You don't hear me going "It should have more shredding guitar solos."
---
Now, if your argument was that maybe he should have broken the one big video into seperate videos, that's an entirely different conversation.
---
These are weak spots because they take extra damage right? Because to be honest I have had much more luck shooting robot's legs out from underneath them. They seem to take high amounts of damage and restrict mobility.
---
Im running out of things to do so atm so i like fighting them and the 300xp they give. Still they are not worth fighting for loot sadly. 1* Scorchbeasts sound like a good idea, but disable the regain of health. They are hard to hit sometimes. 
---
The majority of players are kind people. 
---
Willing to part with a kidney? You might have to.
---
Well, I played last night and had an insta healing non legendary.  So... cool?
---
Interesting, but likely just an oversight because you're never supposed to see the body. All the vault 76ers are supposed to be real people though. Can't have NPCs -_-
---
Except it's not. OC hasn't seen it, doesn't mean it isn't happening.
---
I disagree, love the game.
---
I have SD maxed 30% chance, made 600 rounds of 5.56 and it proc‚Äôd twice.  Prior to the patch I would have had an additional 30% mores ammo.  Stealth nerf?
---
Wise words, you're not wrong.
---
Could be. But that means that lowlevel areas are still good for farming those lowlevel parts
---
Upvote for math!
---
Crippling legs of robots really seem to do large amounts of damage too.
---
For some folks ti is a form of perverse amusement.
---
I've only ever found them as a lvl 20, does about 2 damage. Looks good, but not terribly effective in combat at higher levels.
---
that is a badass camp
---
Yeah. Exactly as they are now they're much tougher to kill than any legendary enemy I've fought anywhere else. They should be legendary.
---
my weapon damage is not changing.
---
Oh. I didint see that there. Thanks
---
Or Bethesda can change it so it stops dropping so much shit?
---
I think that is the image Youtube auto-generated.
---
I heard when you do that and re-log it becomes broken again? And my character is always hungry and thirsty even more now. Are you experiencing that?
---
I‚Äôve followed him in there. Definitely on his route.  Followed him through there until the gulpers. Different story there, even with his sledge.
---
Gain levels to unlock all the perk cards just because all your special points are set up doesn‚Äôt mean there are not additional perk cards to be had. 
---
Fissure Prime has quite a bit but make sure have plenty of Fusion Cores in case u have to sprint to escape enemies so u can fast travel out of there. Where u see 2-6 trees is where u can find the most and if u can level up and get Green Thumb perk (if u dont have it) that will REALLY help you because there isn‚Äôt exactly a ton of Flash Fern in the zones that are commonly nuked.
---
When I had trouble getting hardened mass I would swoop thru White Springs during the nuke and scavenge enemy corpses that I did NOT kill! I don‚Äôt know if it was a glitch or a delay in loot populating on the corpses but after other players moved along (ie, got sick of grinding) or logged out I noted I could aways find Hardened Mass to the point I was throwing it away. This saved me a ton of ammo, but of course I missed out on XP and legendary loot.  
---
It's not a "serious" challenge, that one.  It's more like a timer to gauge how long you've been playing the game, since this isn't Steam and we don't have a convenient "Hours played" display anywhere.  In practice, it's easy to make 20 Atoms by just doing the various Daily Challenges.
---
No, I like the lite pvp elements in Adventure mode. Go ask for a separate game mode.
---
Even worse when you kill the queen and her body disappears before the loot loads. Had this happen this weekend and it was very frustrating.
---
I killed one last night because it was staying in the area where I was helping noobs do their quests. I told them to just hunker down when one appears, but that bastard would not go away.  It was obsessed with attacking the super mutants that were spawning nearby, and then circled till they respawn and repeat...
---
I was mildly surprised. no great loot, but there were 5 or 6 items worth holding on to (including the body parts). Still not worth the bullets and sledgehammer damage, but better than an organ and a pencil.
---
Speed runner cultist, running full unyielding Cavalier AP Refresh. AP Refresh perks, dodgy, lone wanderer, high DR/ER. Bloodied SS deathclaw for dmg, Vampire SS knife,for healing.
---
No guns. Just hack and slash because Sithis demands blood
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal.  
---
I understand your position, I get it all the time from my business users and, to some extent from my own management.  Here's the thing though... an application like FO76. (Which is not really one application but many, many self contained modules...sort of), contains literally millions of lines of code. To write everything "Greenfield" everytime you went to make a change or fix a bug, even if only for that one module you're working on, would take weeks or months to release...and then you'd still potentially have integration issues with all of the other pieces it interacts with.  I've really simplified the issues and challenges,  but perhaps that help to clarify it some for you. 
---
Which is why there aren't many people interested in the plans I want. It's relatively easy to find one set of level 15 raider PA for a friend ahead of time. Getting together sets on the fly to give away to random low level players like I want to do ... Eh 
---
We fortunately didn‚Äôt get to kill her because of the amount of useless bots that showed up. Half of them didn‚Äôt even shoot her, and the other half were chasing her when she was flying, and not staying rooted to a spot where she could land 
---
Something like that, I can understand why someone would just log off or crash the game client if they aggroed. 
---
The rail stations where everywhere above ground, but a lot of them are destroyed and not even accessible. There are 3 I can only think of on top of my head. Probably more. I guess they use trains to transport goods and the above ground mono rails or what ever they are called is used for people. 
---
Up vote for the CoQ reference. Live and drink!
---
Building the set is one of your quests anyway. At level 25, the firehouse should grant you the quest from one of the terminals as you try to track down the missing responder. 
---
No payments from me - I payed once, enough.
---
This happens every time I enter the Enclave via the staff entrance.
---
Omg what? How have you not launched a single nuke? 
---
Yea unfortunately, but figured play with the idea 
---
It‚Äôs both, you can only have 6 weapons on Fortnite, it‚Äôs unbalanced having more slots because you can have meds/weapons for every range. They lowered the max mats because of server performance with build fights.
---
Battlefield and having 2 weapons plus sidearm - again, speaks for itself.
---
Same goes with Cod.
---
Smite you can only buy 6 items, be silly buying 20 and having max stats would it not? 
---
You clearly have no idea about Multiplayer games, and it‚Äôs evident.
---
No goal posts moved, no question evaded,  no ‚Äútwo sides‚Äù about it. Stash and weight limitations are balance and stability anchors, whether you accept/understand that is another matter completely but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs in place.
---
If you genuinely think for one minute that having a stash limit provokes playtime this discussion is over as it doesn‚Äôt make a difference in anyway shape or form, nobody loads the game up and says ‚Äúright, time go to get some _____‚Äù and then logs off, literally nobody and if you‚Äôre gonna sit there and say you know a guy, you‚Äôre talking out your ass.
---
People play the game when they want to play the game, not because the stash has space for some more steel. You play because you WANT to play.

It is divided into I think 7 sections covering what he sees as design problems with mechanics that tie together that impact how players are influenced to play the game.

In short the objective is to rebuild America, but that is just not possible and things players do have no lasting impact on the environment due to the game mechanics, and he goes on to recommend how that could be fixed.
---
I kill those people. I will jump in front of them firing so they will damage meand kill them until they leave the zone. Low level players staying to tag her are super annoying and hurts the fight for everyone.
---
Just to be clear, this is an accessibility in gaming issue.  FO76 narrowly missed the cutoff to be legally required to implement text chat, and I don't care.  The law is a good law and exists for a reason and Bethesda should be adhering to it whether required or not.
---

---
Take a look at a good game that actually cares about it's players like Apex Legends from Respawn.  They have text chat.  They have voice chat.  But, get this, they have an option to play text chat out loud with one of them roboty voices.  But then, get this too, they also have an option to take voice chat and put it in text.  Is it perfect?  No, but this should be the fucking standard in gaming.
---
 This goes beyond irritation at Bethesda for bugs or missing features, this goes beyond the scam of a nylon bag.  This is not providing accessibility to those with disabilities and it is fucking disgusting.  This is Bethesda refusing to install a fucking wheelchair ramp.  This is unacceptable, and the lack of even acknowledging their disrespect to those with disabilities has long since solidified I will never pay this company another cent for anything ever again.  I decided this back when they added push to talk but didn't even mention text chat.  I encourage others to take the stand as well against this kind of crap.
---
Accessibility in gaming matters, and it should matter to all of us.

Actually curious here as I‚Äôve been contemplating R2R2.  I hear it‚Äôs good but what‚Äôs lacking. 
---
Yup, that's the one. I have maxed-out bear arms, so it weighs less than a pound. I never use it, but it weighs so little, so I never bother putting it in the stash.  
---
Oh, and I removed the damn MIRV mod.
---
May I recommend the alternate sub r/Fo76filthycasuals? It's a little less salty than this one...

Welcome to the Wasteland, we got bugs and pain...
---
I'm level 82 had haven't fired a nuke yet either. The last time I tried to do my silo-run, my game hard-froze when attempting to eat food in my Pip-Boy. Basically, the time it takes isn't worth the reward (at least by myself). Half the time I log in someone has already nuked Whitesprings or Fissure Site Prime. 
---
I was just worried that they may make the new content start after the Nuke Quest, i.e. you have to do the Nuke Quest if you want to start the new main quest. I'd rather them not do that. But if that's the case then I'll keep trying to fire a damn nuke lol. 
---
I hate them. HATE them.
---
It's more annoying when you play in third-person because, for whatever reason, the view gets stuck in first-person until it resets.
---
in the subway tunnels that will be a full price DLC sometime in the future.
---
Yeah, that makes sense tbh. 
---
It is. At some point there is not much to do... but i have over 150h in it and it was fun time.  
---
You must understand what Fallout game are, and remember that it's create by Bethesda.  
---
Then you can have so much fun with that game.
---
I gave up and just started killing ads for xp and legendaries and got hit with the infinite loads for the legendaries I killed. But of course the random scorched bodies I could loot but not the actual legendaries I killed

You, on the other hand, are a BoS NPC. Set to essential. You must be a quest giver. Have any quests?

I just switched to red dead online a couple days ago, and I kind of agree with you. Most of the xbox servers are completely broken and apparently have been for some time now.
---
That could explain it partly, but why don't they implement a counter somewhere in a menu? Displaying some measly reward at the end makes it all look like a joke.
---
Yeah really just put it on a different timer when an area is nuked, it‚Äôs all just their decision to let us have what we get today. Apparently they don‚Äôt have a clear thinking when it comes to farming of any kind. When a player goes through all the trouble and waiting time to farm a location, sometimes involve a lot of fighting, they should be rewarded every time they try right? Nope Bethesda *thinks* it‚Äôs not a good idea. The second time you kill those ghouls and search the medic box on a different server you get absolutely nothing. ‚ÄòTry again laterz‚Äô sez Bethesda. 
---
There is so much replayability that it's insane. Plus all that is to come in the roadmap will make for some interesting times.
---
Here's the fun part. Mine is on Seneca Peaks, south side.
---
When I fast travel, it'll place me in one of two locations. If I fast travel *again*, it'll place me in the right spot.  
---
Likewise, when people fast travel to my camp, I warn them to wear power armour, or be prepared for a fall.
---
50/50 chance for them to be placed correctly inside, or on the cliff face. Like with me, fast travelling again puts them inside.  
---
So...idk. I guess fast travelling when you're near your camp and it's loaded puts you in a better spot, fast travel from far away and it just puts you on the perimeter. . .unless it's your camp.
---
Feels a lot more legendary killing a SB than a 3* radroach you kill with a gun bash
---
I left this game like a month ago, and I guess day one bugs are still in. I had high Hope's for this game. I had gotten to level 100 without duping or glitching (besides the carry weight one) and never got a single explosive or two shot weapon, because half the time I would not be rewarded. Couldn't kill things even though I could do up to 800 damage with a axe. From what I'm aware all these bugs are still relevant. I'm not sure if the xbox bug where the scorchbeast queen achievement was unobtainable is still in. Anyway my point is this is unacceptable, and I think the studio that had developed this game really needs a make over.
---
I am pretty bored, I jump on and do my daily and weekly challenges as the first goal of my day, keeps me busy if you don't mind them .. some are quite challenging .. then I build camps on my other alt characters, I have 10 characters, so I might work on different camps depending what I feel like .. also I level them up, they all pretty low level except my primary characters etc .. I always find something to do, it's like a 2nd job, depends what you enjoy .. don't really enjoy the quest line or following the story, so do my own stuff ..
---
My build is whatever looks cool when I get a new card and what just killed me.  The weapon I use is All Rise but when that breaks, it's whatever I have the most ammo for. 
---
Level 42 and going mediocre.
---
Yeah that was probably me. I like to look for high level owners of workshops. They provide me with plenty of caps and tons of scrap. The last three people I got had about 100 lbs of scrap on them each.
---
I run the chameleon mutation with a silenced pistol. Headshot criticals will drop the heaviest of power armor users within a second. Rarely do people realize I have been watching them for 10 minutes waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
---
That sucks. I rarely do the queen these days since the event overall is poorly designed and the loot is pretty poor. Seems like a waste of a nuke vs. Whitespeing or monongah.
---
I know man. Level 91 Deathclaw?  Meh.  Mid level gulper?  I think about running away but they drop decent loot
---
I also wear a beer hat and clown outfit. 
---
But it's even better if they come with the mods on.

I'm not 100% sure why you're being downvoted.  [It is the law.](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/21st-century-communications-and-video-accessibility-act-cvaa)  The law doesn't apply to FO76 because it took effect for games released after Jan 1, 2019, but that doesn't change the fact that it ***IS*** a need because accessibility in gaming is important, and fuck anyone who thinks that people with disabilities should be left behind in gaming.
---
Thanks for trying to help, but it's probably a random world spawn unfortunately. 
---
&gt; It‚Äôs both, you can only have 6 weapons on Fortnite
---
Laughable comparison. Is Fortnite persistent over game sessions?
---
Battlefield. Cod. Same laughable comparison. But since we are on that topic, why didn't you pick Minecraft as a comparison? Guess it doesn't fit your narrative.
---
&gt;No goal posts moved, no question evaded, no ‚Äútwo sides‚Äù about it. Stash and weight limitations are balance and stability anchors, 
---
This is literally moving them from 'It is obviously a stability issue' to 'It's for balance and stability'.
---
&gt;If you genuinely think for one minute that having a stash limit provokes playtime this discussion is over as it doesn‚Äôt make a difference in anyway shape or form,
---
Wow, ok. Of course stash limit provokes playtime. **You said it yourself**
---
&gt;If everyone ran around with 300 stims nobody would ever die. If you had an unlimited stash, you could fill up after a day and not need to adventure stock up for weeks, which will crush the playtime said person puts forward to the game.
---
This is literally you saying stash limits provoke playtime.
---
Now, if you genuinely think for one minute that you are going to succeed in arguing against your own point then this discussion is over.
---
Buddy of mine collects plans, that is all he doesn't, he wants to be able to craft and make everything, too tedious for me ..
---
When you going to launch a nuke, I did mine later as well, probably 80+ before I launched, probably would do more if the servers were more stable, last time I tried, crashed in the middle of the silo and I said fuck it ..
---
It wouldn't be all that surprising to me if there were members in the BoS.  They are all over the place around the Responders's areas.  Some were living in Harper's Ferry, etc.  The world was still populated when the other dwellers left the vault.
---
I'd imagine the whole "prove you were part of the military" was a bit easier when Taggerdy and the other members of the BoS were still alive that could approve the applications of those wishing to join.  And you didn't have to use the automated, damaged, Ghoul, Scorched, and Super Mutant - Overun systems in place.
---
I'm sure Pheonix's Vault Dweller recruitment message wasn't first spoken to us.

Welcome to the game!

Prevent anyone from building where my camp is when I am not logged in.  14 5.56mm, a stimpak, and two bobby pins, oh and 20 caps.

Got an ultracite optimized bracer plan off a regular scorchbeast the other day. Wasnt expecting it and was pleasantly surprised 
---
Don't know why I keep bothering to reply when people keep insisting on putting words in my mouth that were not there. Did I say 10 minutes did I say 15 minutes? It would be absurd to try to suggest that you would cut a two and a half hour video into a 10 or 15 minute video.  The very fact that I said I didn't want it dumbed-down ,  just more concise perhaps, or else reorganized into more manageable segment's should have made that clear. However, if he did decide to post an executive summary that was of that length, then that might be great.
---
I said in several comments here that perhaps reorganizing the information so that I could be served and more manageable amounts might have been a good idea. Another comment I point out that 45 minutes is the usual attention span of a listener. This is not my opinion, is based on Research and that is why most University lectures are limited to that amount of time.
---
Eventually I saw that one of the commenters was kind enough to post a timestamp for people with little time to skip two and get summary at the end. Instead of criticizing us for not having 2 hours to sift through this, they posted something helpful.
---
As to my rather playing video games, yes I would. But I am interested, and I can find time for videos here and there, but to find time for two hour videos on a regular basis is not something I am willing to to sacrifice other things for. There's a lot of people on here commenting that they don't have time to watch the full video, maybe they only have two hours of free time at night and have to choose between watching this video or playing the game. Why does that offend you the people point that out?
---
Did you get it for free with the rubber thumb pads?
---
I didn‚Äôt mention Minecraft because i didn‚Äôt think about it. But guess what, Minecraft does have limitations, so that point just fell flat right on it‚Äôs ass didn‚Äôt it?

Vault 76 dwellers doing the ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù event who died during the sonic scream attack of a SB, Vault Tec probably released a scouting party of guinea pig‚Äôs to see if it was safe for the Overseer to open the door for us, a mirror vault maybe and eventually we‚Äôll find were all clones genetically modified to be more robust and resistant to the perils of a post apocalyptic environment and Vault Tec are as evil as ever and monitoring our progress lol 
---
Give scorthbeasts a decent chance at any plan in the game would make them worthwhile.
---
More great info! 
---
I will def try your delayed WS run. I have plenty of *weapons, only grind the zone for these mats at the moment. Once I can craft my Excavator CS I will set out on other quests, hit WS zone as needed and help higher levels with SBQ at the Prime.
---
Exactly. Which is why they should make adventure mode non-PvP when they release Survival Mode.
---
I don't even mind the instanced loot boxes taking awhile and buildings being slow to repopulate, that's all fine and dandy not farming one specific location over and over... Except when I spend hours prepping to go in a silo, spend 30 minutes in a silo, and launch a nuke to kill one wave of enemies in the nuke zone
---
Team play ruins stealth so only use it if you go alone or if your boys want to go fuckin full socom on these hoes.
---
its r/fo76bazaar . Unfortunately most of what you have is easily obtainable through regular casual game play so I doubt you'll get any hits.
---
Thats a great idea! That would be so helpful and so much less annoying. Maybe it could work on all the benches you see. 
---
  It would be cool to store some extra cards too, just because I don't want some or have multiple. All that's left is to figure out how to handle picking and hacking cards. You do that and you really are the hero we deserve 
---
Do people watch those videos for entertainment value or is it they need someone to tell them how to think about something? I'm sure its a percentage of each. 
---
I watch videos on youtube of gameplay footage before I've bought a lot of games but I never watch these negative opinion pieces.
---
I just hit shit with All Rise for 400 damage a pop.
---
Haven't fully read OP yet but I disagree.  I managed hundreds of hours on Fo4 with a weapon that two shot behemoths.  If you think this game would suffer from being more fun the you sound crazy to me.
---
OP, love the deck idea, it sounds like preset perk card loadouts so instead of needing to move 4 cards for a level 3 picklock, I move one preset instead so I have a loadout with 3 lockpick perks.
---
Let me think.  Between lockpick, hacker, and ammosmith/superduper that's 3 preset loadouts needed right there.  Another 2 for a range and melee build.  At least 5 preset loadouts would be needed to really ease the slow perk card setup system.
---
I'm indifferent on everything else but not in a bad way, I like the ideas you've voiced here but doubt they'll rebuild the game and redo voice acting.
---
I liked how the vox syringer literally makes animals sound like unhappy voice actors shafted with crappy lines.  Oh, and the same girl that voiced the Watoga Shopping Plaza greeting did the Ad Packet Top of the World holotape.  Who is this lovely sounding person?  Props to her.
---
There's good and bad parts in the creative aspect, in this entire game really.  I hate some things and love others, it's been an emotional roller coaster for me...
---
Don‚Äôt post this on r/fallout. You‚Äôll be heavily downvoted while people tell you your stupid and ruining the franchise for enjoying this game. 
---
Wtf is that lmao
---
It‚Äôs a good game. Atoms have no gameplay required purpose. If there‚Äôs something that really makes you feel good from atom shop you get the choice to exchange some moneys for it. 
---
Not really. Every system in existence has a limit. That is the nature of everything. But if you are trying to tell me that 'limits exist therefore any limit is fine' is a valid line of reasoning then you are just plain wrong.
---
That sounds pretty fun lol
---
That takes a little too much flux or server hopping lol

how many times did you fall to your death while building this?
---
Pretty sure it happens when you first load into an area, and you are given control of your character before the loading is completed.  Once it finishes load properly it puts you back at your starting point.  Doesn't matter where you enter, it can happen.  I think Whitespring happens more often cause there is so much stuff to load in that area.
---
I've had it happen in Enclave Bunker, Whitespring, my Camp, outside the Service Entrance of the Bunker, pretty sure even at Watoga Station.
---
Too early to give it a 10/10 :) I love the game, I love 50% of the game, the world, what they have done, mechanics, the other 50% sucks ass, bad design, bad decisions, chronic failures, crashes and just general BS. The game deserves all the hate it gets, but it also deserves a lot of love. I hate people that are constantly bashing it, but I understand the pain .. I still play it for at least 5 hours most days, I have 10 characters, 2 xboxes and I am still going strong. I mess around on different characters, I love my low level characters and the struggles they go thru to try level up .. I mess around with camps and build different camps and have them all strategically placed across the map for quick fast travels .. if I need to get somewhere, I just login with 1 xbox and place my camp and it allows my other character to fast travel for free.
---
I give the game a 5/10, personally hate pvp and destroyed of bases. I am really hoping pve and pvp will be finally separated and destroying of peoples bases on pve servers will be a thing of the past. Build a bunker which can't be destroyed, but there are still ways to get inside and destroy the inside if people are determined enough.
---
This is all perspective because I love killing them. Found multiple prime mods (handmade, hunting rifle, optimized servos, medic pump) I did not have on scorchbeasts yesterday. They give solid XP for the effort and the occasional 1\* worth keeping for my friends with little ammo expended and no need for power armor.
---
I agree the SBQ is NOT worth the trouble. She bugs out and doesn't take damage far too often. That said, last night I joined the fight with 3 minutes remaining. We failed but crippled her wing in time and were able to kill and loot her after the quest ended. Found my 37th ultracite rusty knuckle.
---
p.s. Wood is a problem with all legendary creations and not just the SB.
---
I found an AA ripper once, I thought people meant that when they referred to chainsaws
---
Workshops are a great way to handle PvP as an opt-in. Someone has it, you want it - take it. 
---
Attacking a CAMP could easily be tied to this system too. Instead of just being able to attack the CAMP and destroy it, let me initiate a takeover by interacting with their camp first. Maybe they're farming a resource I want, or I just really like this location. Or maybe I just want to break stuff. I have to opt-in first and it gives the target a couple of seconds to react to someone *about* to attack rather than having already destroyed some stuff.

I can and do, as not everyone wants to use discord.   
---
Problems:   
---
\- If you leave it on auto (to switch back and forth between team and local), then if you tend to play with people, you never get to use local. So if someone else is trying to communicate with you, you have to manually switch constantly, which occasionally breaks the entire thing, then you can't hear anyone anymore.   
---
\-If you crash or get disconnected, you can find out if it was the server, etc, and know who to join on. Just the disconnecting, makes the entire thing worth it.   
---
\-Some people don't want to use their microphone, which is where the point of this post comes in.  
---
\-Some people just aren't comfortable using their microphone in the game, around a bunch of randos. I play with a few other women, and most of them prefer to use only emotes outside of discord. Saves them the headache of dealing with trashy people.

The Scorchbeast boss that spawns at the end of the Glassed Cavern drops plans. Also, I think I've found plans on some of the already-dead corpses there, too.
---
Plan: Marine recon helmet
---
Bethesda doesn't appreciate a single person playing the damn game. 
---
This one seems to have sprung up after Patch 6, and can sometimes cause the Scorchbeast Queen to become immune. It's definitely on our radar and we're actively investigating.  
---
Glad to hear you are loving the game! After about 200 hours, I started running out of things to do and decided to stop playing (I only play solo, or I am sure I would have put more hours in). We will be getting new content starting March 12th, so I will be jumping back in. I would bet the content should be rolling out before you start to get bored with the game. The roadmap looks very promising, and it is all free... The game seems like an amazing value even at $60 to me.
---
By whose standards are the low, Yours? And who are you tell me again? Again that‚Äôs an opinion not a fact regardless how many people may feel that way it‚Äôs entirely that, THEIR opinion which doesn‚Äôt dictate the future for EVERYONE involved.

The limits exist for balance and stability, no other reason. How the fuck can you sit there an say they keep it low to keep people playing but you can‚Äôt enjoy the game at all if you‚Äôre encumbered 24/7? Like it‚Äôs an actual stupid argument to be making.

There's no room in lore for pvp, you want pvp go to a pvp server, fallout needed coop, not pvp, this isn't fucking GTA, it's Fallout.  Cooperative pve is what we all wanted except for some *trolls*.  Don't cater to those bloody people at all.  Yes pvp can be fun, put in a mode for it, hunter/hunted is fun, put in more pvp custom games like it.
---
But for fucks sake, if you're going to put in a bunch of antigriefer mechanics that get used by griefers to grief, then just remove the ability for griefing, make workshops in adventure mode and specific events the only places pvp can occur, outside of them take it away and put it in pvp servers.
---
If we could have a pve, pvp, and mixed server options that'd be cool. OR, AND THIS IS A CRAZY IDEA!!!  Private servers!  Omg no waayy!
---
Playing Fallout 76 is a lot like having a girlfriend. You guys are going to have a ton of fun together and make great memories (the game is legitimately fun). But there's also going to be a lot of yelling about stupid things (bugs and glitches), and a lot things being thrown at the wall (your controller/keyboard/mouse when the came freezes or crashes). And there will be MANY times when you swear THIS is the last fucking straw, and this god damn relationship is fucking over, and you never want to see her again...
---
...But the the next day, you guys will make up, put all that stuff in the past, and continue making great memories.
---
When you wear full marine or combat, it‚Äôs worth it for the sole purpose of the ballistic fiber. It goes from costing 5 per repair to 2 per repair.

The funny part about that is how many people criticized this game and held up Rockstar as some sort of deity saying that Bethesda needed to take lessons from them. Now in the long run it shows that Bethesda maybe isn't so how much of a devil as people would like to have believed. Which some of us said all along
---
When people held up Red Dead as a shining example all I could think of was how had all of these people forgotten the debacle that was the GTA online launch, seems in the end that the Red Dead online launch wasn't that much better
---
We obviously disagree on that this a good game. But I agree that spending ATOMs is optional. I have earned plenty to buy some things, if I wanted to.
---
But that's not the point I'm making. To me it looks like an insult to give players just 20 ATOMs for their effort.
---
I recommend only spending perk points on essentials until you are certain the kind of build you want. That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt stress too much on the perk points as you likely will reach a point where you have a bunch of unused points. At my most I had 62 unused level ups lol probably a bit excessive but it didn‚Äôt hinder my experience in the least. 
---
I will never understand why people hang around moping about a game they do not/did not/no longer enjoy, its like they enjoy hanging around not being happy with a game. 
---
I'm talking about regular scorchbeast that drop organs and wing fragments (leather and ultracite). The wood legendary was a joke about RNG

I usually only do workshops on nearly empty or empty servers for this reason alone.  Plenty of places to make a camp and get near the same items, if not more.

---
&gt; By whose standards are they low
---
The genre's. As proven by the fact that when you need to make some comparisons you need to go and get some FPS/Battle Royale games to make your point. What is the limit in Ark again? Was there some hidden restriction in those other survival/looter games where you couldn't build more containers for your items?
---
&gt;The limits exist **for balance and** stability, no other reason.
---
Wrong. The limits exist for stability. You said so yourself.
---
No, but there was a lot of talk about how the PvP was *optional*. The entire existence of slap damage shows they *tried* to make it at least partially opt-in. There are just things they could do to make it work better. The system, as it is, makes for shitty PvP and allows griefers. People are suggesting ways to make griefing less likely while still letting people who want to PvP do so.
---
Late January update (update 5?) changed the Vendor Plan system.  Supposedly making all Vendor Plans available all the time (with the exception of some CAMP items according to the patch notes).
---
But, something was either not spelled out correctly in the notes or messed up with the Vendor Lists.  BOS Mods for Combat armor are not longer available from ANY vendor.  Combat Armor Deep Pocketed mods are also missing from all vendors.
---
Marine Armor plans are not available at any vendor (though, they pop very reliably west of Watoga station and in Camp Venture).  Marine Armor Deep Pocketed Limbs plans are available at vendors, but torso doesn't appear to be.
---
There are a large number of plans missing.  Sturdy/Heavy combat plans are available, but you still have to server hop to get them all (sometimes there, sometimes not, always just 1 part though, Arms/Legs/Torso, never all of them at once).
---
Impatiently waiting for Beth to fix this.  As not having BOS Mod plans or Deep Pocketed plans available hinders gear progression.  Prior to the Update you could find them with some server hopping.  Currently I have yet to find BOS plans in the wild (though Combat Deep Pocketed do seem to spawn more).
---
They just acknowledged they are "looking into it" prior to the Patch 6, but nothing about it yet.
---
Oh I see. My apologies then. I‚Äôm still rather new to reddit
---
They should just release it as solo player, or solo, pvp, and I've. Might as well just completely fracture what little player base this game has left
---
/u/Ladydevann /u/Valseek /u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
This needs to be brought to the devs attentions.
---
I agree. There is nothing to do. Like really nothing. I learned the hard way after paying ‚Ç¨200 for the Power Armor Edition.
---
Their road map with future updates and content is too little too late in my opinion. 
---
And don't forget to have super duper perk card in place for a chance to get twice the violet flux! :)
---
Have any nuke cards you wanna spare then lol We have been trying to launch one every time we play these days. 
---
There has been some improvement in sever stability, and we have more stash space, some bugs have been fixed.  However, many many bugs still are quite irritating, some game breaking.  It seems like every time they fix one bug, they create another. 
---
Thank you for posting, and adding the video! We're actively investigating immortal Scorchbeast Queens. 
---
This is on the frontpage already
---
I hate it when the splash damage kills a legendary I haven't tagged yet
---
Friend of mine setup a trading post at WS just south of the golf area, 4 people showed up after he made a listing of selling bulk junk.  He had all his bulk junk on him.
---
These 4 players proceeded to trade with him, then began attacking his shop, then killed him in 2 hits and took all his stuff, destroyed his entire camp, then blocked him from session so he couldn't try to pvp back his stuff.
---
There's some serious trash people out there who only want to hurt others.  Pray for their souls cause they're going to **Hurt** when they die and get judged by God.
---
Yes. Well some solution is needed. Picking up stuff to reduce lagg is getting old.
---
Super Duper and Green Thumb!
---
I've got 2 different locations that I spawn at (not a huge difference, but definitely not the same).  One is a ways away from the initial placement, so not at the center (and nowhere near the current CAMP object location).  The other is closer to the middle, up in the air somewhere, and I fall a small distance.
---
No idea what triggers the different locations.  Neither are near the original or current CAMP object.
---
Just FYI drop a nuke north on General Steak house, I've collected up to 100 flash ferns from the area and you don't have to worry about high level mutated enemies as much.  Couple of Yao Guai, or a deathclaw, theres a Mirelurk Queen in the pond just southwest of the steakhouse,  can get a Scorchbeast from the nearby fissure, but not the SBQ.  The Steakhouse has a small plantation behind it with all sorts of plants that mutate also.  Tato plants drop violet flux too when mutated. 
---
But the servers are running 300 percent better according to Bethesda. It‚Äôs awful watching the spinning wheel of death.
---
Don't take workshops.
---
We all realize it can initiate PVP, but jerks have been using it top just assassinate people.
---
They will initiate taking it, which engages PVP, then hunt you down to kill you.  A lot of the time, they never finish taking the workshop.  They just want to kill the owner.
---
Since the PVP isn't limited to the workshop boundries, they will hunt you across the map.  Sometimes they even send their friends to where you are to kill you the second they start taking it.
---
The workshop PVP needs to be overhauled.  It shouldn't extend past the build area of the workshop.
---
Click "edit"
---
Oh I'm not impressed either. Too expensive to craft the ammo for a negligible return on damage.
---
Something I've always wanted to try is a permanently low health build, making use of all those perks that give you bonuses for being low, plus bloodied weapons, maybe a couple of choice mutations to make it more workable, like those giving regen or damage resist.
---
I have a few, if you are on PC.
---
Just to be clear, are you sure the instant-healing enemies aren't just legendaries? Because that's normal behavior. In FO4, it would trigger "Enemy has mutated" message, but in 76 that's absent, but the healing remains. like you said, it ups the difficulty, and that's the point. The lack of a notification means people unfamiliar with FO4 are caught off guard.
---
It took you weeks to get 50 stimpaks? 
---
Dog when I get home I‚Äôll hook you up with like a 100 if you want. Save any tick blood or blood packs and I‚Äôll make you more. 
---
Is that a bag of all trump? My scavenger mode activates if I see a plastic spoon 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and it crashes a LOT during nukespring events. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the nuke visuals or just the amount of polygon of so many players/ghouls is beyond what the console can handle. I‚Äôd be very lucky if I get to see the sunshine afterwards. 
---
Perhaps like cubes?
---
Naw, actually pretty good
---
I was gonna try that but I heard adrenal is bigger ATM
---
The story is beyond 10/10. The world is hands down the most beautiful, impressive, and immersive game world ever created. 
---
It feels fully lived in. The main city at night is absolutely incredible.
---
The random events are so well blended that it's honestly jarring the first time you see something repeat and it breaks the illusion.
---
That being said, it has several downsides (very few in single player):
---
The pacing is a bit off. Not so much in the narrative, but in how things are unlocked. At times it feels like you're not given full access to everything in the game until far too late. That's really my only single-player complaint.
---
In general, the lack of updates is just disappointing.
---
Specific to Online: 
---
There is next to *zero* content. It's very clear that Online was nowhere near ready to be delivered, but deadlines had to be met.
---
Essentially, the free-roam was ready to go, but it's almost entirely empty and everything that *is* in it was thrown together with superglue and duct tape.
---
Currently, there is a massive lack of missions. Only the intro story missions are out, and they're lackluster. They also do not offer solid payouts after the first completion.
---
Stranger Missions, the random missions you can do repeatedly for rewards, *can* be fun. Currently, the payout system is extremely flawed however. The longer you take to complete the mission, the higher your reward. 
---
The logic behind this is that if the mission is more difficult, it takes longer, so you deserve more. The flaw is that it encourages you to just sit around for 10 minutes running out the clock on the objective.
---
Player assassinations, a type of Stranger Mission which you would think would be among the highest paying missions, often pay under $3.00 in-game because they can be completed quickly if you are efficient.
---
Beyond the payout flaw, the missions themselves are broken. 25% of the time they don't even appear on the map, and 50% of the time when they do they bug and don't start.
---
Showdown missions are trash. If you join a team mode while grouped in a Posse, there is a **large** chance that your posse will be on separate teams. 
---
The maps are not designed for PvP, it's just the game world. This leads to *massively* uneven spawns.  
---
Coupled with this, spawns in general are just broken. The modes themselves aren't great either. I only like Hostile Territories and Most Wanted, and even though I like them, because of the spawn issues both are *seriously* flawed.
---
Showdowns are generally a shitshow of spawning behind each other, getting a head shot, then repeating the process. Unfortunately, they are also currently the best way to level up and earn money.
---
Posse's aren't well designed. The camps are pretty useless, and if you form a Persistent Posse (Has a name, is permanent) you can't even join it unless the leader is on. 
---
This is kind of one of the basic QoL problems that really truly upset me about the game. 
---
Another significant flaw is that currently, there is no way to remove weapons from your inventory. 
---
Weapon switching can be extremely important in this game, and often you'll be cycling through extra guns that you literally will *never* use while trying to reach the one you want.
---
Finally, and once again, there's just no content. No property, not enough clothing, not enough guns, not enough gun customization, no businesses, no end-game difficulty content.
---
 If you go to the RDR subreddit it's a circle-jerk of people bitching about micro-transactions ruining the game, and while I understand the hate for micro-transactions, it makes **no** sense. **There's not even anything to buy with the micro-transactions**! 
---
Thanks for the reports, all! We'll look into it. 
---
I could see where that's an issue for you, but I'm not really into settlement building. My C.A.M.P is literally just a place for me to store my goods, sleep, and craft. 
---
Also a revive build. Wearing armor that can revive you and add in mysterious savior + revenant
---
Or sends the corpses flying to who knows where 
---
Do you have a targeting HUD? I'm on PS4 and I crash once every other night now. Disconnects are a different story though
---
Yes, just some additional basic geometric shapes.
---
Yeah about two weeks, i dont get any drops with stimpacks :/ have to go to all the first aid kits to get some and even there most of the time I get dirty water.. are you on Xbox ? Awesome thank you! 
---
Oh yeah. My bad, I forgot that they named the PvP mode "survival."
---
I meant that they should add a new (third) game mode that is more survival horror based. There are a lot of things that MATN suggested that could be implemented rather easily. 
---
Make food and water less plentiful, weigh more, and satisfy less (give the more complex recipes a better niche by restoring more.)
---
They could remove fast travel, except to your camp and other established towns. They could also remove the compass in the ash heap, make certain items like bandanas not protect fully from airborne disease. 
---
I also liked the idea of more thresholds in the food and water meters. Instead of hitting at 25%, give them a smaller penalty at 75%, increasing at 50%, and up to current (or worse) at 25%. 
---
These are all relatively simple numeric tweaks that would make the game much more challenging, and wouldn't require too much new code. And if it all results in a game that's much too hard, tough, that's the whole point. It's the horror survival mode. 
---
You are still here? I was being polite and asking nicely for you to stop and you are still talking shit. What the World has come to...
---
You can do some crazy things with cubes 
---
Lucky. I've come across countless enemies that like to heal bullet damage. Melee damage'll stick, most of the time. 
---
Not looking for Minecraft! üòÜ
---
Currently lvl 168 and I run a build I call the enclave medic.

---
I tired to only put the cards I swap into and out of and the cards I share the most. I mainly use a shotgun to break all the legs I see when we are in combat but lately I run a two shot rocket launcher/fatman with mirv and a hammer. 
---
I don't have stem packs on me and Super Stems don't let you revive down players, so I have a lot of alcohol for when people go down. 
---
As an enclave medic I heal in three ways, Super stems, cards and burning everything in nukular fire that might be causing you pain. 
---
Hey Glicko, 
---
below other comments you mentioned the game resetting the inis even with read-only flag on restart. Have you found a workaround for that ? I¬¥d like to follow your ini tweak guide but I don¬¥t want the effort to be meaningless after a day. 
---
Some builds are better for cripple than others. My shotgunner is a crit based monster, and normal shots tend to cripple in one go. It takes me 3 shots to kill an assaultron and they tend to have 80% of their health when they die.
---
Death by a thousand "bites" one might say.
---
I (level 28) got my ass kicked in power armor by about 6 rad rats yesterday during a "Defend the Workshop" event. The turrets did nothing.
---
If I see that drop when I'm on I will jump in!
---
They've been saying for a month that energy weapon rebalancing is coming in March.
---
Hahahaha :) took you a sec
---
I think what SB needs is an actual mechanic to outfight it.  If you shoot the wings, the SB should eventually be grounded, or it has a weak spot, like a dragon is week on the belly or w/e, something that makes you strategize to kill it more easily.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Far too long... it‚Äôs been a long day!
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **2nd Cakeday** oliverpersson! ^(hug)
---
I just put on a targeting HUD a couple of days ago. I knew it causes a lot of crashes so I removed it from my PAs. Bumped into one at a vendor bot so I figured what if they fixed it in the latest patch, so I wanted to give it a try. Crashed twice yesterday so maybe it‚Äôs time to remove it again. 
---
Thanks for the great reply. As soon as my power comes back on I‚Äôm going to put the plans up on the market place and see what I can get. I‚Äôve had the game since day one of BETA but I decided to take a break and let Beth make some needed updates (and to play RDR2). Can‚Äôt wait to get back into Appalachia and see all the great changes I‚Äôve read about.  
---
I'm PSN unfortunately. You should try to launch one though. You will want to launch one every time you play for the XP ans drops then. It beats server hopping.
---
Monorail!
---
Thanks for the stream, it was great! I'm sure we could get together a crew on Xbox to play with you. Even could take down the SBQ if you want.
---
We're working on a fix for this and hoping to roll it out with our next patch!
---
All things considered 200 hours for $60 seems pretty good value compared to just about anything else. I haven't looked into the roadmap - doing that now.
---
Well, dang, I‚Äôm on PS4 brother. 
---
However, I can give you a few tips. 
---
In the Watoga Mayors office, after you complete Mayor for a day, the chest spawns 8 stims. 
---
Try to use Diluted as much as possible. A lot of the healing from regular stims is usually wasted. The Chemist perk will get you 4 diluted for each single stim. 
---
Horde events and taking workshops will bet around 4-5 stims a quest as well, and they‚Äôre super quick. Bonus if you hang around to complete at least one defense quest. 
---
I'll definitely second this - It's fun for me to just explore the map, and to find new locations. Pretty much all of them have either a terminal with their history, or some notes telling you about the people who live there. 
---
lowkey worried about the types of relationships you've been in
---
I remember holotapes about a system to ground them but it never went anywhere 
---
Does the chainsaw benefit from the 2H perks?
---
Do you have the level 3 Pharma Farma perk equipped, if not, it is an essential perk. Make sure you also searching the boxes, not just looting them
---
I'm not arguing that some people enjoy grossly overpowered weapons; whatever floats their boat, but you certainly are going to burn through content faster and potentially miss out on a lot of gameplay mechanics they are there for players who don't one-shot everything.
---
But if you can put hundreds of hours in using one weapon, more power to you; I'm on my third alt already, just trying different things. 
---
Yeah oxhorns OK. You know who was really good? The Nth apple. He made good lore stuff but got mad and quit one day during fallout 4. I miss that guy.
---
P.S. I'm not really caught up with the lore but we might not be wastelanders here in Appalachia. Im still in a lone wanderer headspace
---
Its a great spot! Here is where I found out about it: https://youtu.be/dDX8pCWGjaM
---
It's a good idea though, especially with more than just cubes 
---
White Knight and Fix it Good are really useful. Lucky Break is useful for melee if you can spare the points.
---
If they push the build zone out of turret range from the clubhouse, the problem is solved but things like this still work.
---
This has happened to me in The Whitespring as well.  lvl91 Glowing Deathclaw running and hiding between buildings.  It reminds me of Fallout 4, doing arena matches with trapped wildlife.  The only thing that a Deathclaw would run from and always does is a Mirelurk King.  I had a clip of a Mirelurk King chasing down and killing 3 Deathclaws  at Sanctuary, it was hilarious.
---
Most of these posts are exactly the same,  no helpful ideas just build a wall between em.. 
---
Also noted that the tin cans alarm in Whitesprings tennis court building is bugged and cant be disarmed. Also saw that legendaries showed no loot, disappeared or I got the spinning arrows..Had a few legendaries just disappear altogether never could loot them. The real lazy ghouls in the maintenance building are funny though, thanks for that. I love how they refuse to get up even after I smash them with my sledge they will finally stand up to die..:)
---
Its a blast, I really still love it. Yeah there are issues, but it is what you make of it and how you look at things...
---
I just want a bobblehead stand. 
---
*if you downvote me that just proves I‚Äôm right!* 
---
Instant downvote, every time 
---
Thanks! I'll keep an eye out for a fix.
---
Yes, I believe it does.
---
Only spawns lvl20 and with fast but terrible dmg, somewhat improved with Artisan and mods
---
I agree. If i didnt make this post i would never have thought about that, and i would have quit the game because i thought for sure they were cheating.
---
That makes sense. I just wanted to understand why people get a kick out of it and why it makes them happy. 
---
I was honestly just annoyed with this guy because he wouldn't stop trying to level my camp. It felt good to kill him and collect the bounty he had on his head, but after his third visit to my camp, I was just tired of it. He probably would have kept doing it if I allowed it, but I didn't want to feed into his desire to troll me, or whatever he was trying to accomplish, so I just left the game. In some way I probably encouraged his behavior by staying in my camp to defend it but all I wanted to do was complete a quest, and I couldn't do that with this guy continuously returning to my site to destroy it. 
---
If both parties are having fun and are enjoying it, then, by all means, go toe-to-toe with each other.  
---
I could give you some stims later in about 2 or so hours 
---
&gt; Okay but op said he destroys any camp he sees at whitesprings. No matter if it‚Äôs just turrets or an actual camp.
---
you should read it again. OP says he went to destroy it and realized it had no turrets, so he then praised the builder.
---
 A completely balanced build. Probably the rarest build out there. ;)
---
We all do but tbh I'd rather have my collection of bears first.
---
Yeah I run with a vats matrix overlay on my t60, only because that's the first mod I found to replace my targeting hud. When I'm in nuke zones I'll notice the SBQ and other mobs highlighted in red. At this point I realize someone near me is going to crash soon :( lol
---
When ever i see a regenerating enemy, the stakes are raised because they usually have better loot.
---
Diseased sometimes drop Legendary loot.
---
The roadmap mentioned decorating your camp with objects from your stash
---
I like your thinking. It was whilst clearing up my inventory that the thought popped into my head.
---
Of course, some sort of 'librarian' NPC could work too, but I'd also like to see the supply drops get some love. 
---
You said it.  The latest patch is an explosive device as they say.  The amount of butt hurt is way over played IMHO.  
---
None of them have gotten a response from Bethesda so people are going to keep posting them.
---
That's pretty cool camp you got there. What does the inside look like?
---
I must be UBER blind I'll check again thanks!!
---
Belly for bonus damage over head? How certain are you?
---
I do the same build yet with shotguns instead of melee.
---
Well, that's pretty ok. Something to be said for persistence, then.
---
What is the combat inhibitor? Is that the light on its head? 
---
I love Filthy Casuals. I have noticed since the roadmap was released this sub has lost a lot of the negative posts that used to dominate the thread. r/fallout is a lost cause but it would be nice to see this sub regain the positivity that it had in the beginning. 
---
Name means nothing. What you forget is that we can switch between this modes anytime. That means there is no point to "Ohh lets just add 3rd mode, that is what MATN explained", because when things get hard in MATN mode, people are just gonna switch to Adventure mode and do the hard part in there and then maybe switch back to MANT mode. It makes whole MATN mode pointless. 
---
I swear my gauss rifle did more damage when I hit their belly than their face. You could test it though and see if I‚Äôm right or not 
---
It will say in the load screen info scroll, that some large mobs have a Legendary leader and the mob will keep spawning till you kill the Alpha.  I'm pretty sure this is designed behavior since I've seen it many, many times from all sorts of mobs.
---
I see silver spoon. 
---
You can definitely hide from them, I've done it numerous times even now, and I'm not using some min-max 15 agility build with legendary  armor either.
---
I think it really  depends a lot on if other players are near you, or if other enemies are near.  But if a scorchbeast is alone,  I can repeatedly get sneak attacks on it, and all it will do is  blindly fire at my direction (accurately), but since I'm still getting sneak attacks,  it  all works out.
---
I've seen the mod at vendors. I believe it was at the Enclave Bunker but not sure. I think the chance of getting mods from scrapping marine armor is really low. I run scrapper and have broken down a ton of pieces with very few mods unlocked.
---
No. You can actually enjoy this game in exceedingly casual ways. You can completely ignore the main quest line.
---
Collect outfits
---
Build a cool solo base
---
Be social and help random others
---
Build a bar and roleplay.
---
Hunt out cool monsters and take pics of your adventure.
---
Bear display cabinet?

I think it is on their back somewhere, can be targeted with VATS

Found it i was a fool and believed the pic had all the info and the text under it was just a repeat. Thanks can't wait to use communist bear as target practice 
---
I quit because I tried to remove one item from my inventory and it took every item from my inventory and it deleted them all. Including all the legendary armor I was wearing and all my weapons. 
---
Update on this: The team is investigating! Thank you for the tag again :)
---
‚ÄúOh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that‚Äôs how it always starts. Then later there‚Äôs lagging and crashing.‚Äù

You'll be in my camp, see steal handmade* . You'll steal. You're wanted for 100 caps. It's a level 15 1* stalker's handmade. You'll be annoyed. Sneak headshot. It cost you 250 caps. 
---
Yeah, I've have to do some anecdotal testing later today. I don't recall them having an actual targetable belly though. Just an all encompassing body.
---
My hubby found a four star hunters machete it's awesome and he is level 157 and it's the first one he has come across he always has great legendary weapon finds 
---
Yeah I've only ever joined people from my friends list until this game. I can click join on people I haven't friended. It's not everybody so maybe it's an option or maybe it's if they add you 
---
 A hard goal right now. Assemble a complete set of Heavy Combat Armor with Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the limbs. Why? Complete immunity to explosions. Those TSEs don't bother me.
---
 Took me about 50 hours altogether,
---
Elaborate.
---
Why is it fun for you?
---
I enjoy the game by exploring the vast wasteland,  collecting junk and items for crafting and modding, and leveling up. I mostly stay away from other people and if I run across another person's camp I either stop to admire it or I use their workbenches and stash boxes and go along my merry way. 
---
I like that theory haha 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs targetable, but I felt like their lower underside was more prone to damage when I targeted them 
---
With the chemist perk, you can get 4 diluted per 1 regular,
---
Uhmm.. I thought you were with the minutemen.. eh.. Ad Victorium
---
Yeah, honestly, I would've expected using VATS to cripple the wings would ground them.
---
I have stood there and waited, assuming it is some kind of load delay. Nope. two steps then back to the door.
---
Hmm, I doubt Bethesda is able to split weak points for a single part of an enemy...
---
I find most of my hardened mass in other people's meat piles as well. 
---
roadmap doesn't say it so not for years at least
---
Im the one guy you'll never meet who uses the gatling laser
---
Away from game right now, but I have All Rise, Bloodied Axe from the comic character (forgot the name), two shot Handmade and explosive shotgun.  Have 30 melee two handers damage perk, 15 strength,  4 perception, 11 intellect . My gear is BoC combat armor and few marine pieces. Forgot the legendary mod on some of them. Have 1 stealth on crouch and 1 stealth field on melee hit received. I only have 1 star. 
---
Imagine?! I live it!
---
I make sure to equip tormentor in case it helps more than I know. No idea if it really does or not. Although I know I give it many concussions once it's on the ground 
---
Thanks &lt;3. Good bot 
---
 Scorchbeasts shoot their armpits and inner wing. They land sooner. I don't use VATS so I can do this. ;)
---
Alls fair now that i know the reason. Its just a minor annoyance, caps dont have much value and i only pick up scrap to get the atom challenges done. Sounds fun being a stealthy assassin.
---
Yep... happened to me yesterday my friend!
---
Your claim is that you had only 50 stimpaks, and they were removed by Bethesda? I don't buy it.
---
My last queen run, she just went poof at about 10% health. Gone. Not dead. Just gone. And we could not loot any of the yard trash either. All that ammo, wasted entirely. 
---
I have not been back and do not plan to until this issue is fixed. Considering how rare nukes down there have been, I am clearly not alone in this attitude.
---
I don't mind the repair costs, but it wasn't a quick fight where we beat each other up and went along our merry ways. I showed up at my camp to defend and the dude would just not stop trying to destroy it. 
---
I guess he got mad because I easily killed him the first time I came around to protect my post, so he just had to keep coming back. But if that's the case just take your loss and walk away. There was no clear winner in this situation, it was just annoying. 
---
They have to make sure we're server hopping for those desk fans
---
Or two mole miner gauntlets
---
I‚Äôm a level 85, and I use full sentinel with a bloodied build and a bloodied explosive lever action that does 648. While I‚Äôm standing still and aiming, (lever actuon gives +50 ballistic DR while aiming) I‚Äôm essentially invincible to any of the SM there. I need to be careful when I move though, because I get 3 or 4 shotted from the SM when I‚Äôm not standing still. Closed quarters are also tough for my explosive stuff.

What you need is rank 2 fire proof (end) and rank 2 blocker (strength)
---
This is what I take and I survive most pvp encounters with a few atoms here and there
---
May want to pick up some luck defensive perks too if your armor isn‚Äôt built up yet
---
you are assuming they can. You can't loot spinning arrows, no matter how much you may want to.
---
Totally agree. Scrapping weapons should be useful. Steel and wood is not that rare. Also, various weapons should yield different types of material too
---
Yeah, that blows. 
---
Firstly it is cathartic and a nice change of pace from the 'shoot bat, loot bat, get nothing'.
---
Secondly, because it generates posts like this where we can see the group who bought the game clearly without doing any great deal of product research gnashing their teeth. Hopefully they migrate away from the 'buy before you try' mentality that lets studios get away with releasing things people don't want.
---
Thirdly, because it is part of the game and therefore it is there to be enjoyed.
---
Easily one of my top three missions in the main story. Hell, Gourmands arc may be my favorite story arc in the main. Disturbing, gross, kind of funny. Scary as hell first time you go in there (I went solo). Perfection.
---
You're surprised people are talking shit about a the developers of a bad production? 
---
You're surprised that not everyone is happy with the current progress? 
---
A regular basis? It's one video dude. One.
---
Stop pulling out that 45 minute crap. You can find studies that will tell you anything. And if this one were accurate... Well, we'd be seeing shorter movies. Shorter video games. Shorter documentaries (which this could easily fall under).
---
That's great that people are posting time stamps. I'm not here to be helpful though. I'm here to tell you to deal with it. Can't sit through two hours? Don't. Stop watching and come back later. I do it all the time for a variety of reasons.
---
By the way, I didn't put any comments in your mouth. I asked a question. What would be a more manageable time for you? You want to read into that? Be my guest.
---
:) I appreciate the concern! I'll be starting a new camp soon since this I've had this one a while, but somehow I haven't had a single issue with griefers thankfully
---
But...the experience is its own reward, right?
---
Yeah it is fairly strong in PVE; extremely strong in PVP. I usually marsupial my way to a high vantage point and just wait for the perfect moment to strike. I had something similar used on me in the past and it inspired the pure stealth PVP build. The fact that you can claim a workshop anywhere in its border makes it all the more better. Previously I had to sit on top of the work station flag and wait.
---
Is grognaks axe in 76? I have found memories of massacring the entire institute with that beauty.
---
You're not wrong but the lagging and crashing is way down from November and the beta.
---
Possibly just timing. Passenger and freight trains often share the same tracks. So maybe passenger trains were out of the area.
---
If you are low level you might benefit from healing salves. Act just like stimpacks and the ingredients are really easy to find in the forest, especially if you have green thumb equipped.
---
One's that aren't all sunshine and sparkles 24/7

 That's your computer. I doubt its random as mine only does that, rarely when I quit to desktop. It sometimes does not exit well. 
---
 Never had that in game myself, so I doubt its Bethesda.
---
It would happen to me if I did too much damage too quickly, but didn‚Äôt *quite* kill them. I‚Äôd see the bar drop a good chunk, but then pop back up as if it didn‚Äôt even register in the first place.
---
No you will have to remake your character.
---
Yeah I used to read game reviews a lot back in the day from respected sources to see if I was interested but now with twitch or lets plays I haven't paid attention to game reviews in years. Why would I watch a video of someone talking about it when I can just watch actual gameplay? Opinions are subjective no matter what. 
---
ALL OF THEM AT ONCE MAYBE
---
Daym okay thought it was account bind that sucks thanks. Lot man. 
---
Like being killed with a spoon.
---
Yeah, it did that to me with quests, even normally quitting the game, it didn‚Äôt sync the past X mins of checkpoints but did the location. 
---
There is a spot you can build camp that has a bar üòÅ
---
You are a nerd. In vault 76 you were bullied. When you left the vault you came across a small stash of comics and memorabilia. The comics are those of grognak the barbarian, along with a costume and a wood axe someone used to cosplay. You change your name to grognak the barbarian and set out in search of a proper axe.
---
Aggravating how you can take cover inside, but they just eternally fly over the roof and somehow damage you through it.

This is 76 Lore, we don't ask questions.

Sorry, was using BaconReader on my phone and screwed up the link function. Here it is, in all it's glory. You can filter the spreadsheet to see which can be learned via scrapping and which need plans.

Why dont you guys think the tesla is good? I use a charging one that melts pvp and pve 
---
Obviously bad ones 
---
It sure is. I have an instigating grognak's axe in my stash
---
That's the best weapon I've found for the miners. 
---
Nah I watched the video. The only thing you have in your camp is a stash box in the middle. Nothing to even protect!
---
yeah.. glad I learned Fireproof lessens their damage.. They are also why I carry a 50 cal with me everywhere
---
Yes sir, sorry sir.
---
Lol yep it‚Äôs that predictable. It is a good idea but the implementation is so incompetent. They could have simply used a thick red or cyan outline around the potential targets, similar to the VATS visual. But no they had to reinvent the wheel and this shaded dark red visual is nothing but crashing nightmare. 
---
It‚Äôs true. They totally will. Don‚Äôt even sub there
---
Mine is fine after fixing it a few days ago. I'm not sure about the hunger and thirst... It may be quicker, but I run the carnivore mutation, so food is not a problem.
---
I think it‚Äôs a PC thing, but a Bethesda thing. 
---
Even if they reduced the amount due to use and ‚Äúbreakage‚Äù is better than getting none of the rare mats

The crashing didn't start until it started randomly sharing the HUD to every player around you though 
---
Whole point of my reply to u bobcat.  I don't think there is anyway to understand why some troll and grief or cheat and others are almost obsessed with playing honestly.   I just didn't want you to get discouraged and not play this really fun (for me anyway) game because of a few asshats, that you know as well as I do, you are always going to have to deal with.  I am glad you stood your ground and gave this loser the business, especially since he was higher level than you.  Thumbs up wanderer!
---
High school in Grafton in a closet, as well.

Sure, I can craft most things in the game, and also have 4 vendor characters to sell stuff.

Found a 3 star 10mm pistol with increased fire rate, double ammo, and armor piercing. Just on my regular build the thing is a beast without stealth, with it added it is amazing. Chews through ammo like no other but that didn't stop me from starting to build a new character just for it. It will be a cross between intellect and luck, with a medium amount of agility and charisma. Kind of a squishy healer that gets by solo with stealth. 
---
I play mostly in Xo1 power armor. 15 strength,  4 precision 6 Charisma 11 intelligent,  and I forgot what's on luck and agility.  I have 3 "10% Two hander damage" perks and the perk that increase swing speed to max. I use the Perception perk for the Granade throw thing. I have level 1 tenderizer and 1 of the radioactive weapon swing in charisma and that solo perk to level 2. I have Nerd Rage level 2, level 1 explosion and rest power armor perks in intelligent.  I have action boy 2, and born survivor rank 1,

I‚Äôve noticed that one day i‚Äôll find a ton of hardened, next day glowing, next day high radiation fluids. it‚Äôs like i find only one and almost very little of the others. the fluids are the ones i consistently see the least.

causes me to wonder if coincidence or somehow programmed into the game. 
---
I don't think Bethesda claimed anything was working just fine, in fact they apologized in their recent post. it happens, deal with it, move on .. they working on stability issues as they have said already.
---
What system are you on?

Open pipboy when spawning in...cant move. Way to go

There's a big difference between having a disagreement with your SO and throwing shit, man

Well, for sure it isnt notes or holotapes.  None of them have any weight.  Also, if you want to declutter, just drop or stash them.

I started that video not expecting to finish it because it was 2 and half hours, but I just finished the whole thing.  His version of what the game could be is the game I want to play.  I agree with basically everything he said and found my self saddened.  I found myself longing for the systems/moments he alluded to in past games.  I hope parts (all) of his vision come to life at some point.  
---
My hope is that the Nuclear Winter mode mentioned in the road map is a much harder lean into the survival mode.  
---
He just earned himself a new subscriber too.
---
With the pricey cost of games today I go to these videos to get a review. Red dead Redemption 2 is major hyped but I didnt enjoy the game. Wasted 60$. Dont want that to happen again. I was able to rent the game from Redbox to try and enjoyed it, since it felt like the single player game but with a 7 Days To Die feel. The game was 30 something and I got it for the discount. 
---
That‚Äôs awesome I dig it
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I'm 135 still have the i am become death quest. Probably killed the queen a dozen or so times. Sometimes i grind for gear, sometimes i get lost wondering around. Something i allways loved about fallout and still true with 76. I can spend hours running around just checking out locations and getting into fights.
---
Yeah what‚Äôs the details lol
---
Doesn't power armor use a seperate perk (Power Patcher) and regular armor use white knight?   
---
random crashes happen on every Bethesda game on every platform. That‚Äôs what happens when you use an engine designed for windows 95.
---
I'm just going to leave this here. [https://opencritic.com/game/7084/anthem/charts](https://opencritic.com/game/7084/anthem/charts)
---
It is the question that many ask when they are done with quests and are level 50 or higher. What you are supposed to do is now you put together best gear, like you normally would in any other online game. But this is where things get really confusing, because garbage endgame that is heavily RNG based. 
---
1) So, you could server hop until you see some good events like "AWOL Armaments" or "Violent Night", that both spawn legendary monster that drop legendary gear. But the thing is, the loot pool contains over 100 000 item combinations.
---
2) Other option is to launch nuke yourself. You can nuke SBQ and have a chance to get 3\* legendary or any other items from 100 000+  item pool reward list. Or you could launch nuke on something else like Whitespring, but there is also high loot pool reward and high player may kill the legendary before you can tag him. 
---
...so basically option 1 and 2 are heavily luck based. Option 1 isn't even something you can just "Ohh hey I am going to do this" and option 2 for you probably takes hour to clear silo, with high chances of getting nothing valuable. So both of them are pretty garbage. 
---
3) Rather than relaying on luck, better start collecting caps and keep eye on trading forums. It is much easier to buy things from players than it is to do some RNG based bs events. While you are collecting caps, craft bullets and prepare to do "Legendary" events when they are up, because you can just go someones else SBQ, do 1 damage and still get same rewards as those who do full damage.
---
All these option are f#cking garbage, because they are all heavily dependable on RNG, but it it what it is until summer. Currently there is no solid "Ohh I am going to do this dungeon and get rewarded". Most of the times you get some pos item that you can't even scrape for chance of getting mod.
---
That sounds fun I had a armor piercing handgun but got rid of it awhile back I don‚Äôt know why lol
---
Wow! This is the first time anyone's mentioned this. I think you're onto something!
---
Especially not people like you
---
Well they are right.
---
I haven't played 76, but I'll give it a chance in a year or when it's stable and complete, im just getting tired of explaining why I don't want fallout 3 turned into fallout 4 over there and for some reason r/fallout now thinks fallout 4 was God's gift to the series?
---
I got it a couple weeks ago and I‚Äôve been loving it. The only reason I had to stop for a bit was because my backup wired controller broke while I was waiting for my design lab one. 
---
The game is awesome and I hate myself for allowing a bunch of youtubers convince me not to get it. Welcome to Appalachia, friend. 
---
I'm kind of looking forward to the day they put in private servers and mods so I can finally buy the game. I hear the map is all that I hoped it would be, but I'm just not interested in BGS's spin-off of Fallout. Once we get mods so the mod community can make this more like a real Fallout game I will be on it like white on rice!
---
Hey, not knocking the quality at all, just wondering where I will find time :) I'll try though - maybe good bedtime viewing!
---
My friends and I have an ongoing competition to see how far we can get into the Enclave bunker before we reset. I‚Äôve made it to the three vendor stations on video. A friend says he‚Äôs made it past that and into the red lobby but he doesn‚Äôt have proof. So he‚Äôs been trying to recreate that for a screen grab. It‚Äôs a game within the game! 
---
I watched them as an hones review tbh. But now I see most of the youtube reviewers  are like the game journalists. They don‚Äôt really play the games either. After falling in love with fallout 76 the past couple weeks I‚Äôm just going to start making my own judgement calls on games. 
---
Honestly, this sounds like a professional chill post.
---
Thanking a corporation for releasing *paid* content, before they even fixed basic bugs...
---
&gt; I don't really see them gaming
---
Was the pun purposeful?
---
Those kinds of people haven't played New Vegas 
---
I fought 3 at once yesterday, no legendaries, no good loot. Just a waste of ammo.
---
My money is on 4\* is coming with Vaults and 5\* is coming in Fall. Because it would be f#cking joke if Vendor started to sell you 4\* items. That is one very shitty online game concept. Vendor idea is that you can reroll your items, means the current 100 000 loot pool is getting smaller and it is going to be less RNG to put together dream set of your.
---
And I propose that you should have at least received 3 1* legendary items for your time and bullets 
---
It'll run smoother in a few years once Bethesda gets its Y2K patch out.
---
Would be fun indeed. Better drops when more people are protecting the workshops against mobs/npc's 
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 2 weeks and I‚Äôm still loving the game. The community (aside from like 10%) is quite possibly the best gaming community I‚Äôve ever been a part of. Almost everyone is super helpful. It‚Äôs fun to play solo or with other. It‚Äôs an open world fallout simulator. You‚Äôre looking at it as a fallout game, when it‚Äôs a fallout survival game. You are trying to survive. Not our fault you dumped hundreds of hours into it after a couple months and got bored. Not our problem at all.
---
Lol, can‚Äôt escape the haters. 
---
If you are on xbox, I have a leather deep pocket plan if you want to buy it, im not sure if its limbs or torso though (im not at home, and the screenshot I took of plans im selling clipped off which part it is) .
---
I can check when I get home.
---
Be a clown. Use an ax. Take lots of drugs.
---
No ideas for a new character though. Sorry. Good luck.
---
I thought the Tesla electrical discharge was supposed to jump between enemies standing close to each other.  I've never had that happen even when the baddies are stepping on each others toes.
---
I know that spot, and it is nowhere near the golf club. Nothing for that camp to "farm". I was thinking, it just may actually HELP to prevent the golf club spam because of the radius that prevents other people from building. OP: Have you ever noticed another settlement at the back of the golf club while you were on the server?
---
I would be more worried about the SB that spawns near there and flies over that area.
---
For all rails? That seems unlikely with how many are at the stations waiting to catch the train. Usually a train runs every hour or so. If a train was 1+hours out passengers would not likely be sitting at the stations yet.
---
Thanks for the link! Will definitely watch all of the video later on, as I really want my base to remain secret. For now at least.
---
Also, if you remember watching a clip about or have seen yourself a spot with little to no enemies spawning around, I'd be forever in your debt.
---
What went wrong was people assumed the game would be bad because it was online, you get more clicks by going with that opinion than going against it.
---
So Youtubers said it was bad for more clicks, since so many Youtubers said it's bad everyone else assumes it is.
---
It was basically a slow motion circle jerk.
---
Most of them have the feel of people losing their shit over the first time they get killed and immediately coming here to vent . It's really barely an issue compared to the majority of shit and it's a literal advertised part of the game.  
---
There are some solutions and some good comments too, just also a lot of senseless whining.  Like I posted before Id like this topic to possibly get stickied so we can maybe collect some useful ideas all in one post and not a bunch of confirmation biasm.
---
That‚Äôs a crazy language you got there.
---
I ran into an entire thread of people who say they destroy any camp at white springs. I‚Äôve personally had my camp destroyed at whitesprings many many times. It was a platform with turrets. It was a place where I left my water purifiers unlocked, food unlocked, doors unlocked, so anybody who needed anything could help themself. Almost everytime I fast traveled to my camp it was a bunch of posts sticking in the air. I think you underestimate how douchey some people can be. 
---
Agreed.  Letting them heal has led to better drops.
---
I remember when FO4 came out and the crazy hate on r/fallout about it. Stupidly, I listened and didn‚Äôt buy the game for over a year. After playing it I realized that sub isn‚Äôt for actually fallout fans, it‚Äôs just for the ones who think their opinion is superior then everyone else‚Äôs. 
---
No one hates fallout like r/fallout 
---
Slenderscorched wantsto give a high five!
---
Don't give the kid too much ammo or he'll get banned.
---
I use both, and have a pretty high level of success with my Stealth.
---
I believe there should be legendary poop piles.. just sayin'. With all the stuff they're eating (apparently their ration consists of machine guns, plans, solid armor pieces etc.) poop should at least have more valuable items as well! Anyone with me on this one bois? Eh? :\]
---
They would also have a small chance of containing plans for building poop piles in your CAMP, to replace stash box... Would be awesome.
---
Can't decide wheter to be thankful or to be not so oblivious to your sarcasm!
---
Hey, I'm on ps4 looking for a crew to queen with and have lots of mod capabilities. Would love to check out your discord server. Please pm me an invite or whatever works. Have a lvl 102 mixed build melee rifleman.
---
In the vault were the child of a cook, and a security guard. Upon exiting the vault your parents were killed before reaching the overseers camp.  Your furious about loosing your parents in the world, and look to punish the harsh enemies outside of the vault with your melee skills &amp; rolling pins.
---
No. Escape artist will break aggro outside of line of sight, they'll still find you with just one Chameleon piece. 
---
Why not use both?
---
Good point well made
---
Oh wow. thanks for telling me exactly what this game is and why it's my problem. But tell me, what exactly is there to the 'survival' aspect of it. Has your character ever been in danger of starving? Of dying of thirst? Of freezing to death or of contracting a debilitating disease? If this is a Fallout survival game it certainly doesn't do much to make surviving an actual part of the gameplay.
---
Here's the flip side. This is a game-as-a-service, it very much is Bethesda's problem if people play it a lot and get bored of it.
---
It's pretty incredible really, Bethesda made a game in a genre that is designed to incentivise playing constantly, doing the same thing over and over again for small upgrades and progression. And the defense from the playerbase when they fail at this? 'Lol just don't play it as much'.
---
All in favor of the legendary poop piles say I
---
Cool cool hit me up 
---
Misterfruit88 I can drop ya link to discord here?
---
Because RDR2 is a fantastic game and RDO isn't.
---
Lol, nope
---
I'm 114 I have a melee/PA/crafting build. I collect plans and build and maintain my groups, weapons and armor including mods. I also do this for my alts and build there stuff as they level.
---
I explore and have 3 different farm paths that I do, I stay busy just running him and my alts.
---
Each of my alts are different I've got a big gun tank, sniper commando, automatic/1H just collecting, maintaining, and playing is a full time job.
---
Find something you like and build upon it, I like to craft so my whole experience revolves around it.
---
Clearly a lot of people just wanter a co op fallout experience and this game isn't it so they are using this topic as a crux to change the game into something it was never really intended to be . Sucks for everyone I guess .
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I scrapped all the garbage my first scorch beast gave me. I was also level 25 and spent my time hiding in whitesprings while all the sentrybots and assaultrons did almost all of the work. 
---
I won't be finishing the whole video (out of principal /s) and I did not see that part but I can offer some technical insight as an indy game dev and CK modder. There's a good chance a drastic change won't happen and definitely not soon judging by their 100-day road map.
---
Stash weight/limit are probably just made up values used to throttle input/output to the stash where frequent calls to the database incur large operating costs (moving/removing lots of "items" in the database, that sort of thing). Throttling is for maintenance, stability, and performance. Database calls in blast zones can already get a little locked up at times.
---
Notes are a non-issue by design, notice how plans have weights though? Most players will never even think to waste time hording useless notes at an extreme level and if they do, they are most likely trying to bring down the server with it (which is ban-worthy even if by design IMO). It leads me to wonder if Bethesda has left this loophole as an experiment (possibly even a social experiment).
---
But, the stash system really depends on how exactly Bethesda has networked the game and why, what are their performance targets, what technology do their databases use, what limitations have they set as a business (dial-up speeds are still a thing sadly), and there is a layer of server authentication.
---
Another possibility is they just want each individual piece owned by players of literally everything, tracked, networked, individually synced, etc., to future-proof any idea that will need it (thinking of mods maybe). Maybe the "place your stash stuff around your CAMP" is a result for them of their system being the way it is. Bethesda is a group of people in the end.
---
I would wager that the YT video is missing a wealth of information as to why and what is/was possible but I think the point of it is to just lend some critical thinking anyway. There's probably also some personal preference involved at the end of the day too (a lot of people hated ARK and Minecraft). That said, I'm very glad to see someone unloading their constructive criticisms at this game, that's how we get quality-assured future content folks.
---
Well hello there... How you doin'? 
---
So it‚Äôs save to say if I can see the effect without having the hud myself, it‚Äôs not yet safe to use one lol 
---
It's up to you, be what you want. I'm not the police.
---
Bethesda claims stability has increased by 300%, and this makes sense because I haven't disconnected in a long time.
---
This place (current evidence not withstanding) is actually pretty quiet, although I've camped in some very remote places in the divide where I never saw anyone (or thing). There are some real nice, very isolated spots south of lake Eloise. 
---
I was hoping someone would recognize it!
---
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt even bother talking to those people. They just wanna be mad.
---
Here is the link to AGS

But who cares, you've got a rOaD mAp now.

Because they'll totally implement it all properly and how it's described without issue.
---
Yep. Core i7 7700 with a GTX 2080. It's definitely my PC. You're totally right. I need the core i9 the run this game, and a copy of Windows 95 for compatibility
---
You received a few leather and some super rare and exciting ultracite!
---
And instead of the slap system I still believe flagging for pvp would have been a better option. They indeed talked about it being optional but this way both sides get a lesser experience. Let people who flag for pvp have all the pvp experiences they want on a pvp shard and everyone who does not want to worry about just turn it off and play on pve shards
---
Search BADCompanySarge on YouTube. He has a few interesting builds and the backstory to go with them.
---
You can tame scorchbeast ???
---
Can you have them guard your camp like with other tamed creatures?
---
*#1 made me laugh, really hard, I will get that perk card now, just for that.*
---
Server lag.  Happens with almost every place i enter.    
---
only happens on heavy load times it seems.  If play nice an early EST i never have the issue.   Its once 4-6pm EST comes around till late night this happens to me.  
---
I am running a hazmat only berserker build, I play that my guy is a scavenger that is deathly afraid of turning into a ghoul. He refuses to get out of his hazmat suit for any reason.
---
I think the ‚Äúbetter loot‚Äù is a myth that got debunked on several occasions.
---
This so much this, I have scrap my sniper rifle soo many times :|
---
Beth needs to add some visual cue so it's more obvious as an intended mechanic. Although, why not make it more interesting? Give it a random different mutation with unique visuals instead? If they're too lazy for animation then some kind of auras will do just fine. 
---
Also, why doesnt this game have buffs/debuffs bar on enemies?
---
And dont forget the disappearing legendary corpses
---
but then how can they sell you emotes? 
---
Yup if you go through a few decent SBQ runs and that doesn't happen, I'd bet good money they fixed it
---
That‚Äôs not little..
---
I tried building a camp just East of the Hotel on one of the flatter bits of the green and every time I came back it was utterly wrecked. Decided the convenience of a fee WS fast-travel spot wasn't worth having to rebuild it every time. Wasn't even remotely close to the Golf Club so I dunno who or what was wrecking it. 
---
Can someone give me some info please?
---
I bought this game yesterday and i love PvP.
---
Is there anyway for me and my friends to play in a exclusively pvp server, where we can engage in pvp without the fear of ruining someone else game? We don't like to be douchebags but we would like to play this game like DayZ, where pvp is always enable but you only engage if you choose so, another thing that would make this "PvP" server good would be the possibilite to not see everyone location, since in a PVP enviroment it would absolute ruin the fun and the "feel" of being in alert all the time.
---
So is there anything we can do or any server we can join or our only option is to wait the "hardcore" they anounced in the roadmap
---
Mom?
---
I don‚Äôt even understand why wooden armor is even a thing? I‚Äôve never seen anyone wear it other than as a joke. 
---
So, redoing Adrenal fixed it for you then? If so that's good. I want to re-do mine but want to make sure it works before I did it.
---
I don't mind them as much now that they don't non-stop scream at you.  That stuff was bullshit.
---
They still don't land often enough, which is irritating.  I shouldn't have to shoot it for 5 minutes to get it to land.  It seems to land less the further on the combat gets too, which is just a bad fucking move for Bethesda to make.  You want things to be a challenge, not a chore.  
---
This list is fucking awesome! I didnt know of protectrons, assaultrons and mr gutsys in nuke silos.
---
I do still need help.  Im getting myself out of the doghouse first.  Went out drinking last night and kinda over did it haha.  Spouse wasnt to happy.  Bathroom, check, laundry, half check... haha ill add you once I jump on.  Thanks bud
---
That made me laugh. I'll take the positive interpretation out of it, although your comment was clearly sarcastic to me.
---
Well.. why don't you use nuke mines? I mean, the whole line of mines are exactly there for this purpose.
---
That being the case, those people were indeed epic douche-canoes.  
---
Personally, I am very specific about the camps that I target - just turret farms aimed at the back of the golf club.  If I see unarmed camps in that spot, I'll deliberately try to kite the ghouls to the opposite side of the club to keep them away from it.
---
I know people can be shits, but (so far - and just from my own gameplay observations) they seem to be the exception rather than the rule.  
---
Do you run around with a group?
---
For some reason, I always think "Leave me alone, I don't want anything of yours. I just want to go about my day.", but that might change ever so ce I got active in the marketplace. Maybe it's an anti-social thing, but it seems time consuming to scroll through another's inventory and not be able to see the 2 or 3 additional perks of their weapons and armor. 
---
The only reason I don't have the game cuz of my 3rd world country internet 
---
Youtubers can kiss my ass.  Bandwagon jumping fucking idiots.
---
It has its whacky moments but also it‚Äôs fun ones.
---
I too built my C.A.M.P up there!  Marsupial for the win!
---
Haven't seen a singe one offer post patch in game.  In LFG on xbox the "top 100" would only go back 15-20 minutes old before, now often times there are less than 100 posts.
---
Now go to r/pcgaming, r/Games or r/gaming and they'll kill you for this opinion.
---
My supersledge will not allow the miday healing...
---
I had one person blow apart my camp with an explosive minigun (no idea if it was TSE or just explosive) one time when it was in the middle of nowhere. I've been camped by watoga station for a month now. Plain view when fast traveling , no one has attacked it yet.
---
So, pro-tip. You CAN learn recipes from scrapping weapons and armor. It must be fully repaired to have a chance to learn the plan, and if it is over 100% that increases your chances of learning it. IE, characters with higher intelligence and the relevant perks will have an easier time learning how to craft weapons and armor without the plans.
---
As for the pipe weapon plans, everyone starts of being able to craft;
---
Pipe pistols
---
Pipe revolvers
---
Pipe bolt-actions
---
Hunting rifles
---
Throwing knives
---
Light leather armor: arms, legs, and chest
---
Is great but we've got a bunch of high upvote posts already going on it
---
Enemies instantly healing damage you've dealt to them is something we're aware of and continuing to investigate. If you're encountering this, and don't mind sharing some account information with me so that we can take a closer look at what happened in specific cases where this occurred, can you please **PM** me the following?:  
---
* The primary platform you play on (Xbox One, PlayStation 4, or PC)
---
* Your [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Account name (and gamertag if on console)
---
* The Email address associated with your [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) account
---
* The name of the character this occurs with (if you have more than one)   
---
Thank you very much for your continued reports on this!
---
Ultracite guns are fucked all around with barrel mods. You can even make it shoot plasma, sometimes. Dunno eta for fixes. 
---
Bingo. The slam system is the worst of both worlds. You have to either individually get consent for each PvP to deal full damage (making snipers impossible) or mess around with glitches and take advantage of weird mechanics like having someone on your team contest the workshop of someone and then shooting them. If they just had a "PvP Flag" like *many* other opt-in PvP games then you would either be PvP or wouldn't. If you're not, you don't take *any* damage from it. If you are, you take full. 
---
Honestly, the biggest reason griefing is a thing with the current PvP system is because we have no set servers. Someone can run around, destroy as much as they want, get a massive bounty and then server hop and do it all over again with no repercussions.
---
How dare you
---
Will look into this. First thought is potentially a server that was under performing. Thanks for the report.
---
Once I found wooden armor I thought... Why isn't this the crafted armor we start with the plans for? I mean... After crafting any leather armor the wooden armor is now garbage 
---
I tried last night.  Couldnt make it through.  Used all my health items.  Not a single item in my inventory gives me health right now because i used EVERYTHING.  I was about to launch it but i died, on my way back... game crashed so i gave up.  
---
Why are ppl still surprised the game is broken? Like 99% of ppl say its shit and the 1% that still play are constantly complaining. Did you not get the memo? Like the 600 memos within the first week?
---
Go scoop up some dog poop from the neighbor, put it in your CD tray then report all the shit you find. Same thing. Probably just as fun and a bit cheaper initially. 
---
I used the jetpack.
---
This one's on our radar and we're hoping to have a fix roll out for invisible teammates in our next patch!
---
It's like that fore sometimes, and then other times I end up leaving the zone with 30 or more of each
---
Presumably PvE players could only claim unowned workshops. I don't have a strong opinion on the mater, but that wouldn't be a change for &gt;90% of players. I own workshops frequently and they're very rarely contested. 
---
There's no doubt about it, you are absolutely right.
---
Repairing should come with the same small chance of getting a mod for that gear that breaking one down does.  Same with modding, every mod should come with a small chance at plans.  
---
If that's too powerful, tie the chance to the amount of materials consumed.
---
Nah, there's passenger cars in the game. Whitesprings is one example, just off the top of my head.
---
It would probably help if you list platform.  If your on xbox I do them installed with the Legs for 750 caps each
---
Nice! I love it up there.    
---
I've already decided to move, because it's kind of far away from the stuff I'm doing, but once I get bored with that I'll probably move back.
---
This! My main is a two-hander with power armour build (though I use a black powder pistol for range and because I'm a pirate yaaaarrrrr) - and it's insanely effective. I was able to hit nuke zones in my mid 20's and do fine (though I burned through a LOT of Radaway) - and now that I've hit lvl 50, I can bring down most enemies in 1-3 hits. I have a good build that I've been following that I can send you if you'd like :) 
---
I'm not sure why they don't tbh. FO4 had a visual and animated cue for them going through a "Legendary Mutation" 
---
Yeah something needs done. These are the enemy. The big bads. But they're just big garbage 
---
Point blank annihilation.
---
So a magazine for each weapon individually?
---
Evil Todd Howard take money now 
---
It's annecdotal at best. Rolls do seem better so I'm going to do it anyways. Kinda like how I still hold B when I'm catching pokemon. I know it doesn't do anything... but it makes me FEEL more confident.
---
You're going to be spending quite a bit of time on the north side of the ash heap till you reach the 20-30s
---
I set up around the landfill and take it over every time I log in. 
---
Later on in the quests I set up around the ammo factory (top right of the map) as you'll be fast traveling up there a lot. It's easy enough to take over the factory and supplement whatever weapon build you have at the time.
---
My .02
---
The mines would be armed. I don't want something that can be accidentally tripped by a random spawn in.  
---
I think for the sake of their immersion attempt, they should have it available through your pip boy.
---
I have found that when I leave the Glowing meat on the Corpses, and come back about 10 minutes later, they will often have Hardened Mass on them instead.
---
I enjoy making up stories for my characters, even though there's no need to RP. Hope you get some ideas from this OP. I only have one main character, my other toon is only 16. There's other ideas I have but those will be for alts because of special restrictions.
---
My character has been many things. For a while he was with Vault Tec security taking down wanted individuals with a cop cap on and his trusty shotgun. Then he became a crazed cannibal clown swinging around the croquette sledge. Now he's a greaser punk with a drug problem and a switchblade. My next change is to work on the perks for Heavy Gunner and wear a bos bomber jacket with (in my head canon anyway) a salvaged vertibird minigun.
---
Since this is all the same character and he can switch to any of those builds any time, I'm not sure how I could fit these changes together. Maybe he has amnesia and tries different styles to find the person he used to be. Maybe he's developed Dissociative Identity Disorder and he really feels like he's all of these people. Or maybe the Wasteland has affected him too deeply and he's had his mind twisted over time.
---
Maybe they'll make it like Borderlands 2 where it be more difficult the gear and guns will be a higher. I think if they do that you'll have (like BL2) powerlevel gear. Might be something like that, overpowered guns and armor. I would welcome something hardcore. 
---
Who doesn't like a challenge.  All I can say if you don't want to prestige your high level character make one now so you try it on one of them.
---
RC
---
Yep. In a derp. I literally refreshed the page and there it was. 
---
There is a bos mod for combat helmets, not that it does anything stats wise. Its just a paint job.

OK. My guns are strong. My Lever Action hits at 130 or so and as Its Instigating I one shot many things. I hunt and kill Scrochbeasts with it.
---
 My Handmade is also very strong and with the 10% bonus for aiming from its low level Legendary, it gets me to 85 or so. I don't actually have a sniper as the Short Night Vision scope on the Handmade takes care of all those needs.
---
 My Shotguns are strong but I still use the level 20 OSE Double Mag I found long ago and it, even after the nerf, takes care of the close range stuff very well. Killed a level 90 odd Deathclaw, a lot of high level Lurks and the Mothman yesterday. ;)
---
 My Shiskabab repaired to 200% is pretty nice. Its my best Legendary and is my Scorchbeast finisher.
---
 I have discovered Combat Knives and now they are my weapon of choice for any non open situation. I swap between a normal Serrated one, hitting at well over 100 wit 200% repair and a Nocturnal 40% faster one doing slightly more at night. They are amazing fun and seriously OP.
---
 So I happily kill stuff, quite effectively, from very far away to in my face. Any emergent situation can be dealt with and I am happy with my build. 
---
Totally agree. They are easier after the last patch, but still.
---
I just started trading with others here and randomly in game, and it is a hugely rewarding, addicting experience. Adds a whole new level to the game. Highly recommend.
---
I got a prime plan and two ultracite power armor plans from them over the weekend. Over the past few moths I‚Äôve gotten quite a few prime plans from them. This weekend was the first time I‚Äôve seen power armor plans drop though. 
---
same here, stuck on sbq, behemoth, and sloth that won't clear after a kill
---
Wish we knew how it'd work.  Is it just a random exchange, three 1 stars for a new one star, three 1 stars for a random roll at 1-3 stars, do we break 6 items with bloodied to get a bloodied that can apply to other things?  Can you modify existing weapons to be better?
---
So many questions about how it will work.  Probably just going to be a "fill up the bar and get a new random legendary", but there might be waaay more to it.
---
No kidding, that‚Äôs cool. I want one now lol. 
---
Past 3 out 5 lvl 50 scorched beasts have given me  prime plans.
---
Exactly, in fact when I first found a piece I thought it was an actual wooden leg, I said to myself ‚Äúwtf did they add wooden legs for? That‚Äôs so wierd.‚Äù
---
Then I realized it was armor and said ‚Äúoh, well it still sucks.‚Äù
---
...This is so weird, I had the exact same experience without Power Armor. Took Monongah plant workshop, put up like 10 turrets. All of them were intact....and they didn't do anything on any of the subsequent waves.
---
I got a response and the numbers they threw out at me we're inflated by almost 10k each as well as a totally bogus count on Nuka-Colas
---
Slowly.
---
Seem to remember Mirelurk Queen being needed too.
---
Should have thought of that myself, lol. If it happens again, I'll tag you. 
---
Shooting out their eyes as well. Acts as both a weak spot, and if you take out all 3? They go blind, and can't actually see you. That isn't to say they'll stop shooting, however. They'll blindly fire in your general direction.
---
Same for me. I've been racking my brain on how to make workshops better to try and make a constructive feedback post. 
---
They really are a great addition to the game they just need a little something extra to make them worth taking to most players.
---
I can tell you right now the ammo production rate of the munitions factory is far too slow. I only take it if I know I'm going to be on for a good bit to make it worthwhile.
---
I always keep an instigating tesla rifle on me, so i can kill a horde in a few shots and you dont have to worry about being accurate.
---
Could indeed be instanced, or become coop events with invading/attacking mobs/npc's, while on PvP servers the workshops stay open for pvp takeovers.
---
Several got 3 star explosives eh?  And you know this how?
---
So much bullshit.  You couldn't loot it, maybe one of your buddies couldn't, but you don't know shit about the results for the rest.  
---
Yeah, it's a problem, we all know, if you stick around eventually you'll be able to loot, even if it's not loading all the loot in there might not be displayed yet, but it always comes through eventually.
---
I have groups melt all the time. In PvP I dont even aim I just shoot the ground nearby 
---
Yes, a magazine for each gun with a category of weapon mods for that gun.
---
You can coat dog shit in sugar but it's still dog shit lol
---
Okay fair point, I don‚Äôt think Bethesda will do squat for just one third of the player base, the PC port was an afterthought to begin with which I‚Äôm sure they regret making. 
---
Now wouldn't THAT be an advertising stream for Beth. Sponsored food/drink spawns!
---
Okay 
---
Yeah, I've seen that happen before.  It usually re-syncs after 3-4 minutes and starts taking damage again, as if you hadn't shot it thousands of times in the mean time.
---
I had a SBQ battle this past weekend where I was unable to loot anything, so I gathered Flux for a little while and then went back to try again, but got disconnected.
---
It is very frustrating after you use a lot of Ammo &amp; Aid to get through an event, then get nothing in return.
---
But we need wooden legs to get to the cow level
---
Agreed I honestly picked up any gun I saw just to repair my favorite gun.
---
The calm before the storm.
---
[https://imgur.com/HGskaA1](https://imgur.com/HGskaA1)
---
Yeah, there is that and Grafton monster, but none of them are getting checked after being killed
---
Keep telling yourself that. Meanwhile I'm sure you don't prop up your opinion that this game is fantastic, no, you wouldn't be that hypocritical to unironically provide subjective feedback while saying that other subjective feedback that you don't agree with is objectively wrong.
---
&gt;  I also have no clue where people get those 2 shot explosive weapons.
---
The vast majority of them were duped items that were then bought on the marketplace or for real world money on ebay.  TSEs were meant to be extremely rare.
---
This is a cool post! I enjoyed the historical links - it's interesting to see the background and potential sources of Wasteland Lore.
---
I am on top of Seneca Peak so I know all about " bad spawns". When I first built there, the game was spawning me in below my CAMP box, about 10ft., which just happened to be "in the mountain". It would put me in the same exact spot every time. I would then have to fast travel again to my base in hopes that it would not spawn me in the map which still did not work most of the time. I would have to make sure I was in PA every time so that if it did spawn me in the mountain, I could hopefully jump off and not get stuck.
---
The fix: I put my CAMP box about that much higher which meant that I needed to put it on the roof of my house in order to spawn in right. It now spawns me almost exactly on the spot that I originally put my CAMP box down.
---
It is not 100% as it still spawns me inside the mountain ( mostly when I first login ) about 1out of 10 times. However, it is now pretty consistent on spawn. 
---
Why they do not have the fast travel mats, like in the workshops, is the question???
---
The 5 factions are set so the route is really just how to get to Raiders and Responders vendors.  There are multiple options (I use Sutton and Flatwoods most often).  Farm junk at supermutiant locations to get extra caps.
---
I just started playing a few days ago, what did I miss? üòÇ
---
So how exactly benefit from chameleon? Is it just like I crouch to a site, find some super mutants, i keep crouching forward as long as they can't detect me, then i stop at very close range from them and chameleon pop and they will never detect me as long as i don't move, isn't it? (even i stay at the open spot?)
---
ps. how to edit the posted topic that i was wrong spelling? lol
---
If you're on PS4 I have a lot of good 3* Berserker stuff in my shop
---
Bugged for me as well. I've killed all of them, nothing counted. I'm wondering if it's like the flower one the other week where you have to do it all in one go on the same server. If so, fffuuuuu that.
---
It's not due to the capabilities of your computer, it's due to windows being a horrid operating system and Bethesda probably has some memory leaks.
---
I have had that issue numerous times - here is a fix that works most of the time - do NOT load into a place or back into the open world at the same time. Wait for one person to fully load in, and then the other person. I saw that tip mentioned here and it helped us. good luck
---
Cheers 
---
If it wasn‚Äôt for the dupers spreading god tier weapons like wild fire, she‚Äôd be impossible to kill anyway. Imagine a bunch of people down there wasting a million rounds trying kill her with 2* stalkers and mutant slayer weapons only to move her health bar a fraction of an inch. I‚Äôve given up on even going down there to fight it because the loot is utter garbage every time. 
---
That's lag! 
---
This has been happening long before the latest patch, she's also been flying away into an inaccessible region long before the last patch.
---
Hmm, weird - so I guess it can vary from location to location. 
---
As others suggested, a door-mat, or just put us where the C.A.M.P. object is (I call it the overhead projector, dunno makes me think of one). 
---
It's happened to me. The only reason I pick them up these days is to stop that annoying beeping!
---
Just wait, after you've played it for 900 hours you'll be able to do a college level dissertation on why it actually sucks!
---
the above is sarcasm just in case 
---
Awesome, I love it.
---
I was doing a SBQ the other day and it didn't spawn for some reason.  So me and my bro walk into the cloud and start looting flux and killing scorched out of the fissure there.  They kept swarming but we seems to be keeping up.
---
Until about 30 of them spawned all at once.  Like rows of them not quite but almost to the edge of my vision, all staring right at me with malice in their eyes.
---
Apparently some other guys got bored of waiting and came along so it wasn't quite the wall of death I had been anticipating though, in fact we managed it quite handily.
---
Weapon knowledge XP i like it.  The better you know your weapon etc...
---
Which is fine, but not really what Fallout has ever been about. I think there should be a mode that keeps it where it is, but a separate mode for a much harsher experience.
---
Which ones? That wasn‚Äôt in 4 to my knowledge 
---
Currently on a server that is the same. I think it is a mix of high population density, with lots of enemies being killed in high succession? Lots of varied meat piles everywhere etc.
---
Basically I'd like to be able to create a very large and specific controlled explosion. Like 12 or so mini nukes stacked and waiting patiently to pop by my hand. 
---
Str on torso for little bit extra str/carry wieght
---
This isn't a good thing. Compare it to how Digital Extremes treat the players. Compare it to how ConcernedApe treat them, how Grinding Gear Games do, how Retro Studios do.
---
Being better than the bottom of the pile is still bad.
---
ok, been a long time since i followed that quest.  Prolly caught a bug since the last  patch.
---
anyone in gmt can add me, same name
---
The greater Whitesprings area is always so laggy for me. It's the worst lag in the game for me. I can do all sorts of stuff everywhere else, but in there sometimes I can't even open a door. I'll fast travel in, wait and wait and wait and wait and nothing loads, and then I'm dead because I was being attacked by things I couldn't see.   
---
I often server hop the Enclave vendor (Dear RNG gods momma wants her Calibrated Shocks!), and getting through that handprint door is the worst. It's a good thing I'm super patient.
---
Yes!!! We want it yesterday
---
Pls add it for console players also
---
The content looks like it can breathe some life back into the game for people like me. I agree, 200 hours for $60 is a good deal. I only paid $40, like you, so I am very happy I bought it. With the coming content, it may be more like 300-400 hours for $40...
---
Over the last couple days I went down the list. I've killed at least one of everything both days. Nothing is getting checked.
---
YouTube, critics and most of the players.
---
It was has lowest rating for a AAA game in at least 10 years and is a commercial disappointment. People are giving it as a freebie, if you buy something else.
---
Lol, as a kid I had a burner out of an old electric oven. It mildly resembled a tommy gun and every kid in the trailer park wanted it. I think I fought like 3 other kids to keep it.
---
Cheers, will give that a go 
---
You can‚Äôt bring them to your camp. If you want to bring an animal to your camp they have to be random spawns. Scorch beasts are always static spawns unfortunately. That would be badass if you could though!
---
It was wartime and this was a heavy mining area.  The basic ground based trains were being used for freight.
---
The monorail system was for civilian.
---
It happened once to me.  I just assumed maybe it was a code I already had.
---
I think all the zone-specific elements sound fantastic. The idea of a one-player experience that lets you play with the factions before shit hit the fan for them also sounds incredible. The VR simulation from fallout 3 in the town demonstrates that type of dissonant gameplay can work and be received well. It would he SO cool to be able to play as a random tech in the Enclave and be a part of Modus going crazy and everyone dying where you could make a choice to impact your own character outside of it - helping modus aids you in launching nukes in the future by giving you a piece of each nuke launch code so you need one less or a free nuclear keycard every week so you don't have to down a cargobot for it - or aiding the people in the enclave but ultimately failing gives you charisma-boosting cosmetic item you can wear in addition to all your other clothes ( like a pin or a badge or something). That way you care more about the ruins and the devastation you're playing through in real-time, you still get to make choices that impact your gameplay (but not necessarily others around you who still get to make their own choices) and you get to be immersed in the lore of what happened in the world you're exploring. SO MUCH POTENTIAL. 
---
It seems to spawn you about 15 feet away from the camp unit in a certain direction now that I think about it. I had it on the bridge next to where I was building and it would always put me in the grass across the street from the bridge. Then I hid the camp unit behind my fusion generator in my shed and now I keep spawning where my kitchen should be and my house doesn't spawn till I move from the area. I'm going to play with this tonight and see if I can get it to spawn me in my front yard reliably.
---
I‚Äôm with you: I quite enjoy it, myself.

Since you mentioned it, let's talk about how branching and merging works in software development. First- the problem.  Suppose there is a text file on a network drive somewhere and ten people all need to make a big update to that file. They each open the file in the morning, make some changes, and save the file at the end of the day.  Sadly the only changes left at the end of the day are those from the last person who saved it, since all the others get overwritten every time the file is saved.  This problem can be solved by using a version control system.  A VCS controls how you update that file so instead of just overwriting the file your changes are added to everyone else's changes and nobodies work is lost.  The process of adding your changes back into the main file is called merging.  Merging can be complicated because it's not really just one file.  It is usually several and sometimes hundreds or thousands of files that need to be merged all at once.  And there are normally several developers each working on their own changes to a bunch of different files all at the same time. The VCS keeps track of each developers work by giving them a branch to work on.  A branch is like a snapshot of all the code at one point in time.  You make a branch of the code, make a bunch of changes, then merge your changes back into the main branch.  But while you were working on your branch, everyone else was changing things in their branches and merging their changes to the main branch.  So when you finally merge your changes the VCS will tell you there are conflicts because some of the files you changed were also changed by other developers. When there are conflicts it's your job as the developer to figure out which changes need to be kept.  This is probably where the problem happened.  Some developer saw a bunch of conflicts when he went to merge his branch and he chose to just keep some of the files from his own branch that he shouldn't have.  The files in his branch contained bugs that were already fixed in the main branch.  But since he didn't work on those fixes he didn't realize he was overwriting fixes with old bugs.

FO76 is not a fallout game. It's a greedy cash grab that spits in the face of its fans.
---
i got lucky like that once and of course it was when i didn‚Äôt really need any flux lol
---
Wow you really are jack of all trades nice
---
I guess you can get too much of a good thing 
---
My favorite early Homesite was on 64 heading toward morgantown.  There is a junkpile beside the train bridge.  You have easy access to morgantown station for a Vendor.  Morgantown highschool for plastic and the airport and train yard for lots of other scrap and loot.  Only downside was no water so you need the small purifier plans.
---
Then why are there people with luggage at the stations?
---
Yeah, from your link, only 7% recommend FO76, while 14% recommend Anthem.
---
Not sure what you were attempting to show with those links, as all you showed was that anthem is recommended twice as much as FO76.
---
Then by that logic it should be easy to tell the difference between someone duping and someone picking things up out of a bag. 
---
I'm lvl 67, working on BoS Quest line and the Enclave. My goal is to launch my Nuke before the DLC drops. Wanted all of that out of the way and hope to be at least lvl 70 then.
---
I sure havent

Did you watch the whole video? He rails against people being self-sufficient almost the entire time, talks about how people being afraid of each other all the time or just waving, instead, multiple times, and presents ideas on how to get people to play more cooperatively together through world pvp events, factions that would be perma-pvp, etc. I think you're missing the hugely positive impacts some of these changes would have on increasing and improving overall player interactions. 
---
Kinda looks like the candyman jacket.
---
wow, you get a legendary from the beast? I never got one before but wing, meat, or sometimes stimpacks.
---
Also the fact that the stairs to the entrance at Fort Defiance don‚Äôt actually work as stairs!! 
---
Is that supposed to be funny?
---
Ha, I know exactly what you mean. 
---
Haha, says the guy that got his opinion off of YouTube. 
---
Ah. What about things like grafton monsters and mothman etc...
---
I see quite a few grafton monsters out in the wild.
---
That‚Äôs another one to add to the list!! Meat hook and just need a volunteer to stand behind for a new video! 
---
Jon is fantastic. He does great Fallout stuff and really loves the series, but is willing to be honest and provide constructive crit where needed! 
---
Make it like apex legends did. They made it cool and accessible
---
Accent walls FTW.
---
Just solo'd a silo at level 59 (pinged 60 during). It's annoying, but not much worse than a 'Power Up' event. It took me longer for my melee build to down the keycard drone.

 Well the one I'm using is the 7th I've built. Its an ancient i5 750 and I have a GTX 1070 in it now. It will be replaced soon witha Ryzen build I have almost all the parts for. It will go in my 24" tower from the nineties I painted Red a few builds ago.
---
 OK my computer runs the game really well. Never crashes and handles many games including this one very well. That crap never happens to me ... so its undoubtedly your machine.
---
First SB you kill you get 200 copies of Marine recon helmet. You drop 199 in a paper bag. 3 hours later Bethesda hotfixes the drops. Plans are selling like hotcakes now and you dropped 199 of them instead hitting the gold Rush. :(

This build uses a minigun with the shredder mod to grind your enemies to dust. If anyone is interested, I will take some time to explain the intricacies but basically, I find shredding to be fun enough to overcome the overhead of fast weapon degradation and repair cost. I tried going back to a supersledge and I just couldn't do it; it wasn't as fun.
---
Sorry but lrn 2 headshot the queen, please. I can headshot the mirelurk queen with every round in my rifles. Spouts are nowhere NEAR as effective as they were in FO4.
---
Says the guy in denial that the game is a boring grindfest with recycled skyrim dragons.
---
How many guns have you crafted and then immediately scrapped? Is that actually fun for anyone to do?
---
I'm saying you should get a legendary 
---
Okay so, break down; higher intelligence means a higher quality of crafted item, in regards to the amount of durability. It also increases what you get from scrapping, such as the chance of getting mods from weapons and armor, and what and how much scrap you get from it. Weapon mods are easier to learn than armor mods, because there are more of them; however with armor you can repeatedly scrap the cheapest part to craft (ie leather left arms) and it will unlock mods for arms, legs, and chest. You may have to craft and scrap several hundred to learn all the mods, but in the end it's worth it. I was able to learn every single leather armor mod by scrapping only Level 1 left arms. You get the leather and cloth back, it just costs you 1 steel per arm without higher intelligence or the scrapper perk. 
---
You can also learn how to craft weapons and armor by scrapping them. This is a percentage based on: your intelligence, the condition of the item (it must be atleast 100% repaired to learn how to craft it, higher percentages mean higher chances of learning in my experience), and relevant perks. 
---
I have not been able to use the pre-made weapon mods to learn a new mod as of yet. I am trying different methods to see if it works, but no luck so far. It's most likely just to help people who don't have that mod unlocked, even though for the more complex ones you have to have the relevant perk to apply it to your weapon or armor anyway so. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to learn it from the mod tey. I do hope they let us make those ourselves when they start player vending though. I'm super excited for that update, between this and the vault raids it looks like this might finally start feeling like an online game.
---
Oh, and not to do with crafting but I see comments about these all the time; at the Poseidon Power Plant, the fusion core producer, one of the connectors is bugged. When looking at the front, wire the 4th connector to the second, and the resource producer will fire up. If you're having trouble placing the nuclear resource producer, you have to shoot the red canisters out of the hole before you can place it.
---
Feel free to ask of you have any more questions! The more everyone knows, the better this game will be!
---
See that, you were crafting weapons even back then lol
---
I once found some spare wooden planks my Dad had thrown away in the shed. Using a hacksaw, I cut them into a nice looking sword, then painted the blade with silver spray paint. I would attack the various shrubs in the nearby woods. I guess I was a melee build.
---
It does, he is incorrect.
---
I've tried it, still not a big fan. Prefer TS3 for the simple fact I can host the TS3 server on my own server instead of having to deal with some random running the server I use. I like having full control of my own server. Which you can't do with discord.
---
Don't do that...easy fix..you just haven't fully loaded in yet, that's on you. Test by trying to draw your equipped weapon before trying to open any menus.
---
‚ÄúBe my victim...‚Äù
---
Awesome!
---
And this post was made a month ago. Stop creeping through my posts and do something productive. 
---
I love his suggestion for raider characters towards the end. Basically, allow players to complete a quest to become a raider. They get open PvP, but loads of restrictions as well‚Äîso they have to think things through, not just create random chaos. There are so many strings that could be pulled from there. 
---
I like to try to bisect the map along with Vault76 (along with your camp they form 2 permanent free fast-travel locations). V76 is kinda north-of-central-and-west so I go kinda central to south-of-central-east. This gives me a closer spot to travel to things all over the map with. YMMV
---
Also, pick a spot with a useful resource node. Garbage, Lead, Steel, etc... 
---
It‚Äôs worth a shot. It takes up quite a bit of your camp budget though. About as much as turrets I believe 
---
I have a Bloodied one. Only issue I have with it is that it breaks way too fast. Makeshift warrior equipped, same thing. Damned axe barely survives a WS run.
---
This. This beats the hell out of an 'engame grind' anyday.   
---
Go. Hunt. Kill Scorched.
---
FO3 also did that.  The talon company mercs kept my weapons and armour in tip top condition lol
---
I still like this game
---
Once you get the hang of it the silos take like 30 mins. And I promise there‚Äôs nothing more fun than actually choosing your target and firing even if it‚Äôs a common spot, especially if a large amount of the server fast travels to it before touchdown. Makes you feel good that people are benefitting from your hard work, plus you can sell all the flux you collect for an incredibly high amount of caps 
---
What you describe does sound actionable. You knew what you were doing when you spammed those bobble heads.
---
&gt;  I got sloppy, and said "fuck it, so many using this to get ahead and so i'll use them for this run".
---
Highkey the most difficult part is getting the damn keycard 
---
What can you expect from a comic replica I suppose :(
---
Didn‚Äôt deny what I said. I‚Äôll leave it at that. Enjoy your hate! I‚Äôm going to have fun. 
---
What does this have to do with the topic at hand? This is a buy thread, not a ban thread. I don't get why you would put this here. 
---
I‚Äôve had numerous examples at WS killing ghouls and even a legendary deathclaw and after killing them they disappear.  Nothing to drop because they went gonzo. 
---
They used to annoy me greatly but with Fireproof equipped they are a non issue. Found this out when I fast travelled to the Generals Steakhouse and was faced with 3 SBs and a horde of angry mutants and running away was not possible because the game doesn't care if you've just spawned in and can't move. :)
---
Thanks for the reply, I'll probably give it another shot this weekend - as you've pointed it I may really enjoy doing the runs once I get them going like clockwork. 
---
I bounced around for awhile until I launched my nuke, then I ‚Äúretired‚Äù to Whitesprings where I‚Äôm probably always going to stay. 
---
Fallout 4 was released early November and its first content update came in late March. Considering that, aren‚Äôt all the claims that bethesda is taking too long for additional content completely false? Seems to me that 76 is roughly going the same pace as far as updates go. 
---
I think this one was another Cash Grab sadly. Anthem is another example and go ahead and throw it in a list with the launch of Destiny 2 and No Mans Sky. 
---
All of us need to stop preordering games and just wait a couple days to see the reviews. These companies know we will buy it because it says ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù on it.
---
We need to prove them wrong come time for their next release. 
---
it's bugged for me too.
---
I‚Äôd recommend MIRV and you could try to find a TS Fat Man which would double it to 12 shells in one shot 
---
I've actually encountered mothman *more* before mothman week.  I've seen him exactly one time since the week kicked off.  It was a vengeful mothman in the woods near the munitions factory.
---
If a player throws down a mine (in the ash heap for example) and the quick travels across the map and back, will the mine still be there when you quick travel back if it hasn‚Äôt yet been detonated or will it de-spawn?
---
I don't have these problems. 
---
Could it be unstable hardware?
---
Have your done a cold reboot? Switched off overclocks (as a test of system stability)?
---
i had insta-healing gulpers yesterday, which proceeded to destroy my camp :(
---
&gt; 18k nuka colas is impossible
---
Is it **literally physically impossible** or just *highly improbable* because if there's any room for doubt then... 
---
I've been playing what I like to call a Sol Paladin, loosely based off a Dark Souls "Praise the Sun!" vibe. I run around in power armor with two handed melee weapons, trying to help out other players I run into. With the data mined Horsemen of the Apocalypse skins for Power Armor having been found, I'm also considering trying to shift him into the embodiment of one of the horsemen, probably War.
---
Here's my build, if you're interested: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3f6575&amp;d=i44cu2a04pe2lt2er2ew1ee2ep1s42sm2sn2ss2se2eh2eu0au1c81l71&amp;w=&amp;n=Sol%20Paladin
---
Hopefully some accessibility laws are put in place.
---
If game developers want to treat games like a service then they need to start accommodating for disabilities. Simple as that.
---
FWIW I don‚Äôt think it shows up if you ONLY have a dedicated card and no onboard video. I only have the Nvidia and I don‚Äôt have that option either. 
---
But my game is running fine with lower specs than OP. So I don‚Äôt think the absence of this option is necessarily an indicator of a problem. 
---
They just curious what you have. 
---
I sometimes offer free ammo just to take a peek to other people‚Äôs inventory. Lmao
---
SCREWS!!!! the real currency of FO76
---
Some of the lore in this and other games suggests that things were really starting to fall apart in the days leading up to the bombs. I have always taken the large number of skeletons with suitcases to just be people desperate to leave cities any way possible, whether that's in a comfortable passenger train, or by skipping into a freight train.
---
That being said, the *stations* are clearly passenger rail stations. They have elevated boarding platforms, customer seating, a ticket window, restrooms, etc. They are intended for passenger trains.
---
One could invent all kinds of reasons why there aren't any passenger trains on the tracks, but the technical reason is probably to cut back on the number of unique textures and models. The lore reason might be that the stations were examples of recently-obsolete, pre-monorail transportation that hadn't been torn down yet, even after the rails had been given up to private freight operators. There are also no passenger train facilities of any kind that I've found, but plenty of freight rail facilities.
---
To be honest they probably just should have stuck to the Red Rockets as the vendor hubs, seeing as how the Fallout lore heavily leans on the American consumerist frenzy around personal car ownership.
---
They‚Äôre looking for anything useful that you have. Past ~60 you‚Äôre just shooting the breeze 
---
I love the translation
---
Aggressotron
---
Nope they‚Äôre a pain but if you‚Äôre PS4 I can make you one 
---
Apparently you haven't used discord then. That's exactly what you **CAN** do... Apparently you missed the big "Create Server" button that let's you make your own server and manage it yourself...
---
Boiled water maybe they‚Äôre starvingz
---
For a replica it does deal an enormous amount of damage so I'm fine with it although it's weird that my bloodied power fist barely takes a dent when the axe almost breaks after 1 WS run. And nuked WS? Nah, half way through it pops.
---
Seriously. If they just included a damn AA cannon that could knock them out of the sky or a net launcher you could use to force them down and stop them from taking off again for 30 seconds to a minute then they wouldn't be so annoying.
---
For real. Every screw I have goes into making western revolvers, so I can immediately scrap them, and typically not learn anything. I have to eventually get the hardened receiver right? Or armor piercing, or anything better than severe. 
---
Seems like you're just looking for problems, because the solution is amazingly obvious. 
---
Don't allow switching. 
---
Maybe allow people to switch *off* of these survival servers, maybe. But certainly don't let anyone bring an existing character over. New characters only. 
---
Gotta sharpen that edge if you want those ghouls to bleed
---
But don't you typically keep everything you aren't using in your stash?
---
Is there a reason why we have to wait until the next patch? Why can't they be hotfixed? Every other online multiplayer game does hotfix's for any major bugs that cause major issues like loot not dropping, or enemies being invincible.
---
Well considering my entire set of excavator AND X0-1 literally vanished from my inventory one morning I completely believe it. 
---
Game has been / continues to be a complete mess
---
&gt; As for you the whole "third party programs", you do realize that bethesda's twitter has retweeted screenshots of people using third party mods, such as the "perk loadout manager" which does give players using it an advantage. So this whole idea that using third party software to change how the game functions is against their rules seems sketchy at best. Because if they truly were against third party programs being used, they sure as hell wouldn't be sharing screenshots and links to the third party software themselves on twitter.
---
I don‚Äôt think they particularly care, it been obvious for a while they never intended to release the game on PC but some time into its development they had an about turn on this decision. So many reported bugs and concern for lack of features are non issues when it come to consoles. Also people are more susceptible to micro transactions because the barrier to entry is much higher (you have to pay like $15 a month for PlayStation plus/XBox gold) so people play longer and can‚Äôt use free mods. 
---
So perhaps you can educate me a little more about legendaries, can you get ultra light and the trait that turns you invisible on the same piece of legendary armour?
---
You do realize that 76 is a dead game right?
---
Side question. A guy was nice and put stuff in a bag for me, how is that done?
---
Yea. So you have the best one on you. And sometimes you see how messy people are with their inventory. For me I am just nosy in a secretly way. Lmao.
---
If you find a legendary creature you should alert players in the area and share the kill. 
---
There aren't any.
---
I love it when the game just keeps heaping it on.  
---
For those of you who haven't before, go take over the Grafton steel mill and start a fight with the Super Mutants but stick to the yard.  They will keep coming in droves for an extended period, it's tons of fun.  Then the defense will pop and a few dozen more enemies will join the fun.
---
I suspect he‚Äôs hoping you just picked some sweet legendary item of which you do not know the value because you‚Äôre only level 50+. Most players aren‚Äôt on Reddit and don‚Äôt know how highly sought certain armor types are or that you could trade certain weapons for a small fortune. So I guess he‚Äôs just hoping to get lucky. 
---
Instead of crippling the wings crippling the head knocks them unconscious they crash land and after 30 seconds they wake up and fly
---
I never said anyone‚Äôs feedback is objectively wrong, the objectivity wrong thing is when youtubers, ‚Äúgaming‚Äù media covers and spreads false info about the game. Remember the pay to win lunch boxes that 76 was going to add? Where are they at? 
---
This is actually potentially also good with the changes made to exploding and  two-shot guns.  There are probably still excesses of those floating around,  so now we'll have a legendary item sink that
---
will probably remove quite a few to give players a chance to getting some more desirable legendary items.
---
Me too. Now if only I could get enough ammo (I suck so I need a lot).
---
With hookers and blackjack?
---
**YES!** Brilliant idea! Why does this not have more upvotes?!
---
You‚Äôre correct. Like I said, I almost never use power armor (except in nuke zones) and that‚Äôs why white knight is so valuable to me. When I‚Äôm in nuke zones I use power patcher, but power armor stuff is for a different conversation :)
---
No, blunt objects to the face leave a better impression. And a dent.
---
While I do not condone the behavior, I think it can be summed up thusly. "Raiders gonna raid."
---
I don't care what anyone says, 76 is not only fun, it's gorgeous. Walking through a forest early in the morning with fog rolling down and sunlight peeking through the branches is just amazing.
---
Was it a paper bag? If so, he dropped something then transferred items into it, or just dropped them all. 
---
If not, was it a bag just sitting around? If so, that's a container, and they just transferred the stuff into it. 
---
What console are you on?
---
Laugh in Apex legends
---
I get the bug where I can't swing all the time, its truly annoying. The fix is to open and close your pip boy. 
---
Was the gaming media spreading false info about Start Wars: Battlefront 2 lootboxes?
---
Back when beta was approaching and people were talking about proximity voice implementation and some possible limitations with it (even before the PTT debacle) I said, at the time, 'well at least we should be able to coordinate things like trading at longer distance via text chat'.  Someone came back with 'well they haven't mentioned text chat, are you sure they'll have it?'.  I was absolutely flummoxed by the question - 'A multiplayer game in the 21st century with no text chat? No designer of a game with a PC game client would do that.'  It's one of those base state assumptions.  Turns out I was wrong.  There are apparently game designers in the 21st century who are still not familiar with basic must-have multiplayer game features.
---
I really like these ideas. My misc and holo tabs on my pipboy are overflowing with items.
---
It doesn't have to be a game shattering reward, just something mildly useful or even faction related gear...clean outfits..
---
You strip all the heads when removing them üòÇ
---
Yeah, anything like that. Anything, really, that could more consistently get them to land so they're worth fighting. As they are they're more annoying than a threat.
---
I thing the minority of critic comes from people who have only played the game for a short time. I would say they game just gets boring when you are in the endgame and everything becomes to repetitive.
---
Paper bag after I asked for Radaway 
---
You haven't even played it lmao
---
Played all weekend an noticed many enemies (legendary mostly) health instant heals once you got them to a certain point. Like I would get them down to say 20% and its like they hit a stimpak.
---
&gt; Some of the lore in this and other games suggests that things were really starting to fall apart in the days leading up to the bombs. I have always taken the large number of skeletons with suitcases to just be people desperate to leave cities any way possible, whether that's in a comfortable passenger train, or by skipping into a freight train.
---
I would 100% be able to buy that if they had people/suitcases on the train wrecks, and people at the stations trying to chase trains instead of sitting at the stations. It would have been easy for them to do. 
---
Is there a good post that shows the most sought out armor types? Weapon too I guess. I have nothing so... 
---
So you hit them with the axe so much it breaks, then keep hitting them and it becomes a sledgehammer
---
You could probably use the campfire trick to get a foundation where you want. Place one in a legal place and the use the campfire to place one next to it that you wouldn't be able to normally.
---
As luck would have it - I caught the tale end of my run on twitch [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386158889](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386158889).
---
Hopefully that is helpful. Of note, you do not see the disappearing loot bug after a fresh kill.. I think this might be System - PC
---
player name - emixxary
---
 I sent a PM with the other details. 
---
Really? I only encountered Super Mutants. As soon as I can log in again, I'll try to hunt some Mole Miners, thanks!
---
Perhaps they treat people like cattle and crush them into a cargo carriage. 
---
Yeah, you just drop it (it's a command in your pip boy screen), and anything you drop appears in a paper bag. 
---
Since they charge a lot for stuff now you could just use X-01 Armor with T60 Legs with Calibrated shocks. You can find mods for power armor but pigs will fly before you find calibrated shocks for X-01.
---
If you Youtube where to find mods you'll find mods for a lot of things. Buying the plans is crazy expensive.
---
I'd love it if they dropped like a ragdoll like when they die bahaha damage them a little on impact
---
Thank you for bringing this up. This has happened to me but to make matters worse i couldn't even move. So i stood there getting attacked and couldn't even fight or run. This is definitely a major bug. The not being able to see players is a great way to implement this. maybe even a second or two of invincibility so people don't booby trap door ways
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I wish the scrounger perk gave screws from scrapping something even just guns.
---
If all else fails, I'll try that. Though I personally just run away from Deathclaws, haha
---
It's entirely when you post. If it dies in the first hour, it will never gain traction again. Hitting the right moment to get 40 upvotes and a few comments right out of the bag will likely counter any mass downvoters that are lurking. You just have to hope for sympathetic masses trawling through the new posts.
---
Yet you still waste your time on the subreddit for a game you are staying away from. 
---
 For Scorchbeasts the X0-1 is no better than any other good PA. You want BOS Heavy Combat with Dense on the chest and Strengthened on the Limbs for complete explosion resistance. Her screeching is all explosive and don't do shit to me. ;) 
---
I'm on satellite internet, so I have lag issues even when everything is working perfectly. I would think it was just my internet, but my brother plays on "real" internet down in the city and he has issues too.
---
I think I just got lucky with the fact the mole rat discussion kept attention on the post, and then Bethesda replied. I have had other posts languish as well. 
---
Don‚Äôt carry junk on you. Ever. People **will** find it, and they **will** take all of your lead to make ammo. 
---
Weirdly, I found that I do far more damage hitting the legs of humanoids instead of the head. Added cripple/slow pretty often is nice too.
---
Headshots seem to do little. I do not VATS, so maybe that is a factor.
---
Honestly, I'd be shocked if the xbox population cracks 10k right now.
---
Definitely performs well on the one X.  I played with friends who had the day one xbox and had to reboot the game before SBQ fights.  Or about every 2 hours.  I had significantly less performance issues on my oneX than was reported all through out launch.
---
However, server stability is unaffected by your client performance.  So... early on, it was very iffy staying connected.  Things have definitely gotten better since launch in that regard though.
---
That‚Äôs irrelevant, I‚Äôve seen more false info about 76 than any other game 
---
When someone is fighting the sbq don't intiate a trade!
---
I was dumb, I looted all the golf balls in Whitesprings and then didn't instantly put them in my stash. \*sigh\*
---
That's a genius idea, actually. Now I want that as feature.
---
That‚Äôs very odd. I can, I wonder if it‚Äôs some PA mod that prevents it. All I have is calibrated shocks, motion assist servos, and s bright headlamp. 
---
This is basically me too!  Shotgun, Handmade and Melee.  Live in power armor for combat situations (my X 01 has a lot of damage resist).  Lots of mutations.  Vanguard armor cause I‚Äôm always at high health.  I love being all over the place.  
---
Recently, I have loaded in to numerous dead servers. I was in one with 8 people and another with 3. Unless everyone else is kneeling, then the servers are empty. Also, there are very few level 100+ players on the ones I have been on recently. 
---
I always spawn south east of the CAMP device. 
---
Yeah im on ps4
---
I do the same thing. I usually don't go that way though, but go down the stairway to the right, then across the main control room and into the military wing. I have made it all the way across the main control room before it snapped me back once. 
---
Interesting.  I just switch weapons back and forth.
---
It is truly annoying though and always happens at the most inopportune times.
---
Ps4
---
Performs well on my X, usually see 5-7 people max on map. Very rare to run into them.
---
Not sure you are doing anything wrong.  Very rare for me too. Seen 4 in 180 lvls.. Didn't see my first until around lvl. 50 maybe. Got 2 in the Mire, just exploring, 1 near my camp up in the mountains South of Watoga, above the Bog, got my 4th (glowing ) after I nuked The Whitesprings last night at the gate entrance by the Enclave entrance bunker.  First 2 were stalking, third was Vengeful, 4th was glowing (nuked of course), but this was the first I've seen since the event started.
---
With the evacuations rush I'd honestly buy that. I'd just expect to see cars full of bodies and bags when they crashed then.
---
You don't even have to research it.  You can go into the comments and say "I would never play this game!" and people would reply "me neither!" and then 4 months later the video creator would come out and say "Hey guys, I'm gonna try Fallout 76 soon!"
---
Then if you say they should try it they're like "If Bethesda wanted people to buy it they'd have a trial or make it free to play.."
---
'That specific example I gave is irrelevant'
---
Ok champ.
---
Yeah, I have two combat perk loadouts. One for melee that includes White Knight and Rank 5 Makeshift Warrior, one for SQB that includes Power Patcher and Rank 5 Gunsmith.
---
screwdrivers get auto-scrapped into steel and wood, so you must be scrapping everything with a tire iron
---
I too have a melee build and almost quit the main story trying to get they keycard drone. Luckily another group of people came by and helped me shoot it down.
---
Use them. They are a great addition to FO76: especially Perk Loadout Manager, Better Inventory, Power Armor Clean HUD and no vignette, better maps (I like the crafting workbench map), glowing bags, meat piles, Flora, and ore.
---
I've been using them since right after BETA when they starting coming out with no issues.
---
Bethesda's official stance is that they don't support mods, so don't ask them for sulport if you use them. If you need support, you'll have to reproduce the problem without the mods in use before you will get their help.
---
:)
---
Here's an upvote to salve the wound
---
Awesome, there are less bigs now then launch and we still have a lack of endgame content (not unheard of in early mmos) but there is alot of good in the game as well.
---
Seems to come and go. Kinda like the slomo walking that happens once in a while and I have to swap weapons to get out of it and be able to run again. Not sure exactly what is causing it. 
---
Take my pen knife, my good man!
---
I‚Äôd give my left nut to have some people play music with me.
---
I have a dedicated music room with all the instruments (and two tubas because tubas are the GOAT instrument) but no one to play music with.
---
Sad times.  For now I play the tuba in an empty room in an empty house.
---
Looking over the cranberry bog from a cliff on the savage divide, the level of detail at max distance is astonishing. You can even see weather patterns like rain clouds and rad storms, I had no idea that was even a thing. I can't post the screen now I'm at work I'll try to find it later though. 
---
Thanks man:) 
---
I've tried fast traveling from the cliff face and wind up in the same place or further away. Sometimes at the closest known map location and for me that's the munitions factory. 
---
That would be awesome :P 
---
 Yeah, I have to be a bit careful when I get in my X0-1 as I'm normally immune to explosives and my X0-1 ain't. ;)
---
Not the most ideal, but thanks for the work around, now does a TS MIRV Fatman fire 12 shots or is it mechanically gimped ? I've never seen one 
---
I hope not, I feel as it would ruin the game. Someone sets up out whitesprings with a turret base as long as they want farming unlimited exp and legendaries uncontested. Then they can sell the legendaries/if they bring out the event where you scrap you‚Äôre unwanted legendaries for better ones, you‚Äôre somewhat creating the pay to win system. I beg they don‚Äôt allow other players to host servers, especially when they can barely handle the servers themselves. 
---
Makeshift reforging weapons 
---
If there are beds/sleeping bags/seating close to you while in combat, do not use the E (PC) key  or you will start the sleep/seating unbreakable animation.
---
Ey thanks for the info man thinking of getting it on my x aswell because want to sit back and relax the game as well as try hard at a desk, for me 10k players isn‚Äôt too bad as long as I‚Äôm in servers with like five or more players and stuff. Reasonable for the game to kinda be dead right now.
---
1 clarification point-   
---
As others have mentioned, the "flash fern" version of the mutated fern is what you need, but many/most nukes dropped at Fissure Prime are set such that most of the fighting happens OUTSIDE the nuke zone (at the drop site north of the Fissure). So you have to walk IN to the nuke zone (not just where the 12 level 100+ guys are clustered on top of the concrete building blasting the Queen... ) in order to even see Flash Ferns.  If you aren't taking rads... you aren't gonna see flash ferns. I've seen clusters of ferns right on the edge that had BOTH flash and regular mutated ferns... use your headlamp to spot the telltale purple color.
---
That. I will try.
---
There is no reason to believe player hosted servers will be connected to official servers
---
Thanks for this info. I haven‚Äôt played in a few weeks but about to jump back in. One thing I want to make sure I‚Äôm clear on though, are you saying you can actually learn how to craft the base weapon by scrapping it as long as its condition is 100%+? 
---
I have never came across that but I also bet I‚Äôve never scrapped a 100% item that I didn‚Äôt craft myself, meaning I already had the plans to craft it. I doubt many others have either since that would mean finding a weapon, repairing it to max then scrapping it. This is an amazing find if true. 
---
I think you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôve done the asylum yesterday and the would spawn back where the server thought they were last which was my theory. One body actually moved back to its spawn point confirmed, the others I wouldn‚Äôt know for sure. 
---
100+ hours, can confidently say the game is garbage. 2/10, buggy fallout 4 mp mod at best
---
Unless I'm wrong, doesn't the "diseased" modifier for enemies cover up the legendary title in the enemies name?  People could also be fighting a legendary enemy without knowing they are.
---
Gotta love it when PvP balance fucks up PvE gameplay.
---
My friend made a church for him
---
As far as I know mines persist like paper bags 
---
Ok, so I must take rads to see it?
---
Np! Also PA and a trusty melee weapon are your best friends in the silos
---
I am waiting on player vending.  I have ***HUNDREDS*** of screws that I have been hoarding.
---
I will build my wasteland empire on screws!!
---
Yep... I expect the mutating to full heal... but this is different. Here is a clip from yesterday where you can see their health bounce back from my damage and damage from others.. you can also see it do the full heal it is s'posed to do. 
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496) 
---
I assumed this was server instability. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs registering your hits on the server - it‚Äôs instantly displaying the damage as being done to the enemy, but when the server refreshes it hasn‚Äôt registered and goes back to full health. Very annoying 
---
this is so annoying i wish they would change it to "hold" the button for a second to sit or sleep
---
Sorry. I'm xbone. I have an extra plan for the lever.
---
Yeah. Good example! Just like that.
---
I suggest finding a cool spot at Camden park so you can farm Mr. fuzzy tokens! You can get 3 a day and if you do it for like a hundred days you can buy something super cool. (no spoilers)
---
Never get a handjob off an assaultron
---
Its alright
---
Dont attack enemies at whitesprings while the robots are near you
---
I can‚Äôt speak for 76 but I know it worked on 4, here‚Äôs a [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f-lVO1DrItw) of it (I also had it in 4 it was great
---
Much, much better recently. I'm getting maybe one disconnect in every 5-6 hours session (if I'm on that long). Servers always seem really populated, plenty high level players with a good mix of new and medium too. Just not seeing as many nukes being deployed as before. But running smoooooooooth and not getting crashes on login anymore too.
---
You very well could be right. Unless there's a bug where not legendaries are dropping legendary items.
---
Hint: Toy trucks.  Toy trucks all day long.
---
I have about 600 screws to sell when player vending is implemented.
---
What you mean by x3.. like you get 30 every half hour?.. my base is built on an acid site too and I get the same 10acid/30min intervals but if there is a way to maximize this further I'd love to know
---
Adhesive is Anglers...   
---
(Basically all the Far Harbor critters are terrifying, and travel in larger groups than I'm comfortable with). :) 
---
I‚Äôm cool with that! When you want to? 
---
Probably a bug that switched to the next post. Or OP completely edited is post.
---
This \^! if you can one shot a legendary dont! let other players get a hit in and then kill it. Even with reg ghouls in whitesprings i like to let everyone get a hit in before i finish em. But yeah always share the kill!
---
Gotcha, sorry read that wrong and have heard alot power armor users complain about the rebalance. Was wondering if I was missing something. 
---
Like which? The witch costume is the only one I know of, but is super hard to get. 
---
When can u get on?
---
Thanks a lot man really convincing me of getting it on one x now :)
---
No hate for the video itself, but this is like the sixth time I've seen this at this point. It's an extremely minor inconvenience, but dangit if this ain't slightly irritating
---
Had similar experiences with my friends. Its nice to stay on the same server and see that new player suddendly arent added. Only people who choose to join via friendslist.
---
This is how I once took all the workshops. And yes I agree defend missions get old quick. Would be improved with leveled mobs and atleast 1 legendary mob per event.
---
Funny I used to be ¬´that guy¬ª running the silos at 14-16 minutes. Good to see there are other people out there addicted to being effective.
---
Now im doing the annoying robot challenges so not rushing it anymore. A few more days and im done. Me thinks.
---
Around 7 to 8
---
Fireproof maxed out works really, really well in case you don‚Äôt have that.  I‚Äôll be beside a blown up car with or without PA and it barely hits my HP.  
---
They are not officially supported but they will only ban you if you use cheat mods, which nexus largely removes anyway. So most if not all of what you will find there are fine. I use 5-6 mods from there, and have for over a month.
---
no it's all random
---
Alright sounds good. What level you need it? 
---
This is what I was hoping to hear thanks!
---
Here is a video fo ti from my experience - [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496)
---
Ah, I see. It just seemed way out of place for me. Thanks for the answer brah. Muchly appreciated. 
---
Oh yeah gulpers drop lots of tasty meat
---
The trick is to look at meat piles to see the spinning arrows, then do something else and come back to it.
---
For whatever reason the game insists on giving you the spinning arrows when you first try to loot it, as if you have to look at the meat pile for the game to decide it should load loot on it.
---
When I do the SBQ, I don‚Äôt expect any meat pile to load.  I just quickly look at all the meat piles to see the spinning arrows, then by the time I get back to the first meat pile there‚Äôd be loot there.
---
With the SBQ specifically it loads faster once you get the prompt saying that Scorched Earth has been completed.
---
With everything else, I find that if you land the killing shot it loads instantly for you, and delays for everyone else.
---
We don't need an official faction if we embrace Mothman in our hearts, br√∂ther
---
here is a video of it happening. (Karma, please). [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496)

---
No problem at all captain! I'm UK/EU so not sure if that is anything to do with servers being busy vs empty. If you do pick it up definitely gimme a shout. Will be well up for helping you out! GT JaggersLips13
---
You're welcome :)
---
10k might even be a reach. When you start recognizing familiar names on different servers, I am thinking the player pool is pretty small. I won‚Äôt launch a SBQ nuke anymore since there is rarely enough players over level 50 to help. 
---
That's such a cool attitude that I can't help but root for you.
---
I wanna post pics of my house but don‚Äôt know how..üò≠
---
It's true. It's a small chance, but I've done it myself so. You're right, my first couple weeks in game I never thought to repair and then scrap, but then I repaired some thinking I would sell them because it increases their worth and ended up scrapping them and voila. Mechanic learned. It SEEMS to be linked to intelligence score, and maybe perks. Mostly intelligence score though.
---
Same here UK/EU   Ey I will man thanks a lot!
---
So you play garbage games for over 100 hours. Fallout 4 is even more garbage though.
---
So pve is the wAy to go with it!   Great info !  Thanks.  
---
Yeah I figured.  Thank you! 
---
There is always one weekly challenge that doesn't work for me. It's kind of pathetic.
---
You‚Äôre not really far from Camp McClintock, and there are a few Steel resource nodes there. Also, it‚Äôs in a great geographic location. Check there.
---
The grafton monster that spawns south of hemlock holes dropped bos combat armor chest plans yesterday. As far as scorched beast I had the lvl 50 baby beast drop ultrcite mod plans . The fissure south of white springs, I got ultracite internal database mod plan. The bat by the pumpkin patch in the north dropped ultracite kenetic dynamo mod plan. Both mods are poop, but I think this means that ANY schorched beast has the loot pool for ultracite mods now. So yeh they are worth using bullets and hammers on.
---
Thank you man ! 
---
and hopefully they‚Äôre not, because if it comes out in the 4th quarter this year, all hell will break loose. 3 months and they‚Äôre still dealing with beta bugs. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be able to let players host for sometime, and if so, it has to be separate. It would tank the economy as fast as dupers 
---
The screws get stripped when you try to remove them. 
---
The springs are so worn that they're no longer usable. 
---
Thank you so much I lll check these out! 
---
I want to but I get my ass handed to me every time. But I'm level 35 and I honestly don't try to get myself kitted as best I can. Just what I'm interested in. But the fact that it is a challenge is actually what attracts me.
---
I guarantee you buy the next Elder Scrolls and Fallout games.
---
Same.
---
I‚Äôm sitting on 1400 screws and 80 bulk springs.
---
I sold 30 bulk adhesive and 25 bulk oil just yesterday.
---
Anyone that kills me would be set for junk for at least a fortnight because I have no space left in my stash.
---
Nice one man, looking forward to it!! Message me here or on Xbox. Shake it!!
---
Yes 80% chance for finding chems  Pharma farms lvl 3 
---
If this exists in 76 it's going to be a very expensive joy ride one afternoon.  But then im not already saving the mats for Nukes nothing 
---
They absolutely need to be more worth fighting.
---
I can make the outfit for PS4, don‚Äôt remember where I got the plan though. Happy to make them if anyone wants one. 
---
**I love Grahm**, everytime I see him I get excited!
---
His dialogue is fun*(great easter egg in there)*, Chally the Moo-Moo is adorable, and trading with him has always seemed beneficial*(moreso than other vendors)*.
---
I even take a picture with him everytime I ran into him through the main story game play, so I have progression pics of my characters success next to the only real NPC the game has. 
---
Sometimes I'll get nostalgic and go back to see my progression pics with my big green buddy and his moo moo :D
---
I do too. My post was to bring attention to issues... I am still hopeful that it gets fixed. Great storytelling. 
---
Why would anyone want to host a server if it's identical to an official server? There would be no point at all
---
This is what I'd vote for. I'd love a mechanic that encourages you to be precise where you shoot to get the best advantage. But then again, I love Monster Hunter and Horizon Zero Dawn cause they work like that (MH more than Horizon but Horizon's combat feels like MH lite... I wish it were a little more like MH and less once you know the weakness the monster is totally easy. I'd still like it to be challenging even when you know the weakness where as Horizon once you know the weakness they are super easy).
---
The game is very fun and double and if you play with friends. Many negative reviews are from people who either have not played the game, or have played more than 500 hours. For my part, the game is still brutally funny and with the new road map, one has hope.
---
you can have the baddest imaginary build in the world and it will still crash if you have a corrupt file, driver issue, or a variety of other issues unrelated to raw power.  
---
3rd gen i5, GTX 750m laptop here. No crashes whatsoever since the patch.
---
This thread has a great map to help you make up your mind.

---
I used one of the lead deposits near the red/white dome thing, but that might be a bit North of where you want to be at level 7. Next to the river to the West of the map are some good junk piles. The one next to the river West of Flatwoods would probably do you well.   
---
I've built a LOT of camps, and this is personal preference, but I wish someone had told me at a lower level: turrets are crap. They take 10% of your build limit. And often don't do a single thing when you're being attacked. Repairing your walls is also really cheap. I don't have any turrets on my builds now. I either build somewhere no one can get to me, or just repair my walls more often. 
---
I use game fly to see if i like a game, then buy it digital
---
It‚Äôs awesome! 
---
Really wanted to see if it got better lel. Also Fallout 4 is so much better then this "game", and Fallout 4 was so bad that I'm suprised they made this dumpster fire mod for it. Such a shame too, great series will never get another sequal because of how hard this junk flopped.
---
I made the same discovery and posted on it a while back!
---
"My working theory - I hunt the Behemoth regularly near my CAMP location (Twin Lakes). When he runs at me up the hill and subsequently dies, he falls through the map, and respawns, dead, in the lake where he comes from. And I can loot him. So perhaps same thing is happening for other big enemies... they are teleporting back to original spawn location?"
---
Play The Whitesprings Roulette
---
I chose a out of the way location with lots of accessible water and natural resources, I have wood, blackberries, and a cluster of rare firecracker berries. 
---
Another good idea is to make your home near a place you farm, whether it‚Äôs for particular junk, resources, plans, or equipment. 
---
What about a little more dark souls where when you know the weakness it's now possible to win, maybe, you'll probably still die though.
---
I would like to do it more. I just wish it were more user friendly and easier to initiate. I don‚Äôt always want to use my mic, I don‚Äôt always have what you want to buy on my character. Player vendors will help a lot. But after a few times of spending a few minutes to find what I want in their inventory, asking for it, and usually getting refused. I never really bothered with it again. Maybe I gotta give it a go again these days. 
---
Less chance of running into mutants in the game...
---
Best place to find the best plans? 
---
I need to try the straight scatter-gun build on my next alt. I already rely heavily on them in early - mid game, particularly after I get the Perforated mag for the combat shotty...   
---
For HW Builds, while the Minigun's damage remains super underwhelming, if you combine the "accelerated barrels" with the Stabilized Perk, you get a LOT of chances to cripple a limb in a very short amount of time. (Fire rate is a legit 314). Shoot til they fall over, then walk over and kill them with something cheaper... :)   
---
As always, it does terrible things to weapon condition, but as a close in "please no closer to me Mr. Deathclaw" weapon, it's fantastic. Works pretty well on Stealthed Assaultrons too... "I hear him over there somewhere....\[spray\] THERE you are..."  
---
I‚Äôm using the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm overencumbered but still want to do some damage‚Äù build.
---
9 points of rifleman in perception, literally everything else other thank LCK is populated with fast travel and weight reduction / carry weight perks.
---
It‚Äôs a necessity when you‚Äôve got 2500 rounds of Ultracite 2mm EC and 150 lbs of legendary weapons (with the weight reduction perks and legendary armour effects), amongst others.
---
So the meta for melee players nowadays seems to be the bloodied build. You find a weapon with the Bloodied prefix (damage scales with lower HP), and you wear unyielding legendary armor to increase your strength when low on health. This is a non power armor build. You grab perks like Nerd Rage, Serendipity, and Radicool to further boost survivability and damage. Grab mutations like twisted muscles and adrenal reaction. Essentially, you irradiate yourself to low HP in order to dramatically boost damage output.
---
Power armor is not too effective in PVP. You are a big target, slow, and cannot take advantage of a bloodied build as well as non power armor users do. It looks like you are trying to do a bloodied build, but not quite there.
---
I do not personally use melee or power armor. I am trying to repeat what others have said. Hopefully someone who does use melee or power armor can confirm and expand upon what I have said.
---
When doing Uranium Fever with other people don‚Äôt try to kill everything yourself ASAP. Give everyone else a chance to get a hit in. 
---
Yeah I was thinking about that at the same time I was writing. You do find some skeletons in train cars but not a lot with luggage or body language to suggest people were trying to escape, like long platform lines or people mid-crossing or whatever. I definitely think it's a missed opportunity in terms of scene-setting. Kind of thing they could fix with some lore and a quest though.
---
reposting the top article on the front page. A bold move. Lets see how this strategy works out.
---
 Oh for sure. Of course I have 3 Fireproof. My Bos Heavy Combat takes no damage at all. I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and suffer no damage.
---
 My X0-1 is pretty good but nothing like my Combat Armor.
---
Oh, and if you want to have a house you can "move" easily, put a single foundation and then have a stair leading up. That way you can put your build down anywhere you can fit a single foundation piece.   
---
I tend to rebuild every time because I like building, but it's easier to just plop down the entire structure if you're not into building. 
---
I have said this a billion times and i will say it again Bethesda and their fanbase abuse each other like that one couple everyone knows that constantly fight over little shit throwing plates and slap each other but when the cops get called they ban together to be the perfect couple and say nothing is wrong 
---
In before it‚Äôs a Fallout 4 remaster with the fo76 engine.
---
To be honest it‚Äôs the more realistic guess based on BGS‚Äô past history.
---
3 times I've done this nuke. Each time the SBQ loot loads pretty much instantly but I have to wait like half an hour for everything else.
---
It does, yes. 
---
I believe you were misreading the tag on the vault suit.
---
It was a size 9L.  Perhaps you need to make an appointment to have you eyes checked.  You can register for an appointment down at the Charleston DMV.
---
Be sure you take a number and wait for your number to be called.
---
Problem is that there isn‚Äôt any place within the camp parameters where I coul place a legal foundation. I‚Äôm on one of the towers of the monorail üòÇ
---
It's a to be continued kind of quest... I think &gt;.&gt;
---
Then you get banned for having too many helmets.
---
Then they patch SBQ to only drop barbed wire cane mods
---
On PC... Wish we could cross platforms! 
---
Well yeah you got it after it was actually playable a lot of us payed 60 dollars for a game in alpha 
---
Great stories! The players make the game :)
---
For the investment of resources needed for scorchbeasts I think they should be 1-3* legendaries. 
---
As it goes now I just switch servers if a scorchbeast aggros on me. Easier/quicker/more profitable than taking the time to kill it.
---
Wish this wasn't the case though.
---
Enjoy the game 
---
Post patch, I've been able to hold workshops, *and* not worry about infinite loading screens when fast traveling. Also, **0** disconnects, even during laggy SBQ fights.
---
Population depends on how long you're in server, the longer you stay put, the lower the population gets. If you get lonely, just server hop and you're back in a populated area.
---
It's been great!
---
In case this post is a response to my [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aulfvf/instahealing_enemies_disappearing_loot_unable_to/) from earlier today - here is a twitch highlight clip showing what I was posting about - a 3 star legendary that you can see insta-heal and also do the full heal that it is s'posed to. [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496) 
---
oh- and you can see what fancy loot it dropped for me as well. 
---
No they just remove all but one from the inventory no ban
---
For melee build, put emergency protocols on your X-01 torso: damage reduced by 50% oh hells yes, and that one mod for the arms that lowers the ap cost of power attacks
---
for fartin around and showin' off, T-51b with nuke cola paint, jetpack torso
---
For junk runs, excavator with strength on the torso
---
Otherwise calibrated shocks on the legs, targeting HUD on the helmet
---
I imagine it's different for everyone. Ask? And then if you don't have it, or don't want to trade, say you aren't interested?   
---
High level players need stuff, too lol
---
I‚Äôve never been to WV but I‚Äôm sure that after so much time in F76 I would enjoy seeing some of the actual locations. I‚Äôve done this for several other games with maps based on real cities. It‚Äôs always been enjoyable to see what the designers used for the in-game locations. 
---
That said, I‚Äôm not thinking of making a special trip across the country. Just of I happen to be in that area at some point I‚Äôd probably divert to see the real Whitespring, for example. 
---
I would love to see this as well.
---
Don't follow high level players into their homes. The baggie of spoiled meat is merely a ploy to drop the floor out from beneath you and watch you plummet to your death.
---
I should have learned my lesson about accepting spoiled meat from strange men after that last trip to planned parenthood, but what can I say, I've always been a little slow.
---
All scorchbeasts are banned
---
You on? I'll be on in 10min more
---
Other than the lack of Pepperoni rolls, yeah this is alternate WV. Do you like the outdoors? Old people with antiquated ideas? Cryptids? Then WV is the state for you. Seriously though, the Appalachian region of the US is incredible and I‚Äôm proud to be a part of it, but definitely pick your stops first and go from there. Stay out of Pax, no hospitals for 120 miles in any direction.
---
Ah... I am fine with it being possible to win even if you don't know the weakness (but a whole lot harder and a lot longer and a lot less likely). As long as it makes it much less likely that you are going to win (like knowing the weakness gives you a considerable advantage. And yet I also don't want it to be so considerable it makes hte monster easy &lt;- Horizon many of the robots got ridiculously easy once you knew where to hit them).
---
Yeah man have fun! It‚Äôs a *blast* 
---
Maybe he enjoys hearing about the drama like I do. I haven‚Äôt played since December and pop in time to time to see what Bethesda has done next (presumably bad).
---
Here, I will validate your prediciton:
---
First dozen hours are fun, picking up the quest line, exploring the map, fighting new creatures, but the frustration and boredom will escalate strongly after that until you as "salty" as the rest.
---
 It's a good game, but a disappointing Fallout.
---
Nah. Penis, Brain, Jaw!
---
I don't know what the Gutsy's thruster is...Great list btw!
---
Addendum; always check containers near vendors. If someone was recently through with stuff they didn't want, most people put it in the closest container. I've found some great stuff, and deposited a lot of ammo and mats. I once found like 200 plastic. I nearly cried lol.
---
BoS wins!
---
It worked for me today and I hadn't even realised it was a challenge. It popped up after I killed a radscorpion at a workshop defend event. 
---
I‚Äôm online now I left my Xbox on but I had to go and I‚Äôll be back in few minutes
---
Yep. The Prime Fissure nukers have gotten very clever in the last month or 2, always leaving out a fast travel spot so they can pop in and trick the queen into fighting OUTSIDE the nuke zone. It's a good strategy, you don't have to constantly pop rad-x or have friends with Rad Sponge shared. But it screws up the flux farming, because you aren't IN the nuke zone when you fight her, and the nuke zone itself ends up so far south that the viable flux gathering area gets cut in half by the southern border of the map. (You can only walk about 1/3 of the way into the zone before you hit the  "you can't go that way" fence). The other occasional side effect of the cool nuke placement is that occasionally the SBQ actually flies off into that no go zone and stays there... ; ) #funtimes
---
I thought only 3-star legendary enemies have this effect; are all Legendary enemies supposed to have the ability to heal up?
---
It's an exaggeration. Dark souls... Prepare to die.
---
Can we have make-up sex with the game then? üòòüòòüòò
---
Why are you wining to us? We cant do a damn thing about it.
---
It's random.
---
Awesome thanks
---
Funny, I got stuck in the same exact situation at about level 20! I hid in the bathroom just opening the door and launching grenades at the Wendingo, strategically closing the door when he tried to open it!
---
The SB are kind of like the ultimate griefers.
---
My favorite bug: when armor randomly stops being worn for no reason I can figure out. I'll be skipping along and realize my power armor leg came off. "Oh snap, did it break!?", nope just magically no longer wearing it. Pop it back on, 5 minutes later, off again! wtf whyyyyyy.
---
I carry a light weight rifle that does little damage just for this situation. My Ghoul Slayer Gauss one-shots everything at the Whitespring so when other players are around I whip out the pea shooter to make sure I‚Äôm not That Guy. 
---
I have a medic pump on my exc and x01 torso‚Äôs, I love it, if I‚Äôm getting stuck into a mob with a melee weapons I‚Äôm not always concentrating on my health so getting a stimpack hit is handy and it means I don‚Äôt feel the need to equip born survivor so that frees up special points for something else. I tried reactive plates but it didn‚Äôt feel like it was doing much and I‚Äôve heard the stealth boy torso consumes a lot of action points. I‚Äôve never seen the x01 jet pack at a vendor so haven‚Äôt tried it but I‚Äôve got the marsupial mutation so it‚Äôs medic pump on everything for me lol
---
Swings and roundabouts.. the nice players seem more plentiful, but the odd griefer keeps us on our toes!
---
The Whitesprings is the only place it ever happens for me and it happens every time I go there, regardless of the time of day. It‚Äôs kind of annoying, but not a huge deal. 
---
Holy shit you played Fo4 and thought it was shit and decided to put 100 hours into it's sequel? Are you just that stupid? Stop doing things you don't enjoy. You probably only play Yu-Gi-Oh because you've already invested so much money in it. That or you're just one of the cancerous plebs that actually enjoyed Jump Force.
---
I tried the campfire trick for quite a while last night, but couldn't get it to work with a foundation. If you get it to work PLEASE let me know because I would love you forever.   
---
...wait, were we trying to build at the same spot? Can you get there from some logs?!
---
No problem at all, when are you gonna be on?
---
They also drop prime plans. I killed between 5-8 and had those 4 listed plans drop. The queen is a whole different story.
---
Only confirmed patch will be the one supporting Wild Appalachia and that's not until March 12.

It's pretty unreasonable for /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ to leave the existing Adrenal Reaction mutation in a broken state and force players to remove it and reapply it.  There is an assumption that this is a hardcore endgame build and so players will be able and willing to potentially clear all their mutations and then reapply them, but it is not fair.

Some of us are fighting the good fight üëä

That server isn't hosted on your own server, it is still hosted on discords servers. What TS3 allows is for me to run the whole TS3 server on my own private computer.
---
Mirelurk Queen weekness? Lol...one hit from my melee weapon.
---
It does cover it often. That's why its vital to check every creature you kill, often times there are legendary drops in diseased mobs.
---
The robobrain got me a couple of times!
---
If you‚Äôre looking for PvP, respect that many others aren‚Äôt interested. If another player doesn‚Äôt start fighting back or gives you the Thumbs Down emote, walk away and look for another player. 
---
What's your gt 
---
Fixed it for me; doesn't display in the Effects tab, but if you view your weapons damage, it will increase correctly as your health goes down.
---
Yes! 
---
I have a lot of fun with this game.
---
Have you ever come across the bug? I have. It's very different from legendary enemies regeneration. What happens when I get it is the enemy health bar gets knocked to almost 0, then regenerates. It happens repeatedly and it's impossible to kill the enemy. I've generally had it happen using a gun with an enemy which is far lower level than my character.
---
I think legendaries regenerating is a fairly obvious mechanic. When I see someone talking about this, it generally looks like they're talking about the unkillable enemy, not the one that takes a few more hits to die.
---
Every single time at Whitesprings.  
---
I now race to see how far I can get before being kicked back.
---
Thanks dude 
---
Pro tip: Adventure and explore a lot before finishing most of your main and side quests. It is an open world game for the most part. Take advantage of that. Walk in random directions. Explore interesting places.
---
If you can hold off until being level 50, the weapon or armor rewards that you received for finishing those quests will be at maximum level.
---
Most likely has to do with the game being tied to consoles.  Don't know for sure but I think they have to put in when and what they are updating so hotfixes are harder to do. 
---
And if you find one of the Legendary miners at one end of the area, you can use the Follow Me emote to let other players know where he is. Work together! 
---
THIS IS MALARKY
---
Are you looking for sympathy here?
---
Pretty sure the only ones who may care are the rest of the banned dupers. You can all cry together.
---
I stayed across from the Hillfolk hotdog shack. Use the substation for power.
---
Do you know the price?
---
I should be on at about 2 pst
---
2 questions: when I walk just SW of Watoga TS what is the area where the tents are located? Is that "inside" the zone or am I way off?
---
Yeah. One thing I find unsatisfying is that attackers don't PVP the workshop owner in order to take the workshop. Ownership just isn't that valuable. The attackers either want the caps and junk for the kill or the fun of the hunt. 
---
Pretty dope fits the fallout world well good job!
---
Well they did have those Sonic attack hacks. Hacking griefers can't get any worse 
---
I‚Äôm certainly starting to believe that some unlucky souls are getting unintentionally banned.  I‚Äôm sure you are posting your story to try to help everyone understand what is going on, but I don‚Äôt think anyone will change their opinion until bethesda officially says something. Whether you got incorrectly banned or not, all posting here does is stir the pot. For your best bet at getting some real results I hope you have submitted this issue to bethesda. Don‚Äôt spam, just send one support ticket, write down the number associated with it, and use that number to spam them if you want. Tell whoever you can get a hold of your support ticket number and get the issue expedited.
---
Besides forest areas scale to players in them I think. My guess a higher level recently rolled through and enemies haven't re-spawned for your level yet (unless you went to cranberry bog, then yeah that sounds about right).
---
That sucks man, hoe fully they patch the dupe bug soon so everyone who was banned, rightfully or not, can play again. Does seem kind of a bummer that if you picked up someone‚Äôs dropped loot and they had crazy amounts, then you got banned too. Kinda makes you wanna stream every second of gameplay just in case.
---
When you see another player you wave at them 
---
If you see someone, give them a wave or thumbs up... but not deathclaws. 
---
There is probably a higher level player nearby 
---
 As well check the vendors. Many people dump stuff that they don't want. I have bought more useful stuff than found useful stuff so far.
---
 The Whitespring, The Bunker, Watoga Staion, Phoenix and Wallace at Harper's Ferry often have useful stuff. 
---
Oki, this explaibs what happend to me the other day. Thought i'd rly bad aim.
---
Do you like intense racism? Then I have *just* the place for you
---
Yes we are!!! üòÇüòÇ I currently have my base ‚Äútwo floors‚Äù lower and just recently discovered the logs that lead to the rail and the top!
---
Have had this happen multiple times on the Scorchbeast Queen and a lot of other high level enemies in nuke zones. in the past.
---
Did I ask you to do anything? I started the whole thing by saying i just wanted to get this out there. 
---
That‚Äôs ‚ÄúSigns and Letters‚Äù

Even at 3 points, I've seen it's only like a 13-15% chance of him appearing. I don't know how extensively it was researched, so please take it with a grain of salt.

2* - 10.5%

Seeing as you know your stuff... So is Rose the raider bot an uploaded consciousness of Rosalyn? I felt like this was hinted at but not confirmed. Her significant other was the leader, right? So maybe he missed her and made a robot version. Rosalyn's voice on the holotape from the Charleston capital building sounds exactly the same as Rose's. 
---
I can hear a few minds being blown by this one.
---
There's less guns in FO76.

Loading in and the only 1 or 2 quests you‚Äôre wanting to do don‚Äôt show up on the map or quest list.... bugs on bugs

Will you still be on at like 7?

well there is a pinned note at the top of this forum, and there were quite a few posts about it....

Like I said, I wasn't banned. I have not dupped. all good.

That I know, however i have been putting off taking them out of my inventory because i may want to listen to them again and a system i can send my excess items to a warehouse so ther players can use it would be nice. Like a guid vault kind of thing but faction based I'm assuming
---
Same while looting off benches and tables.
---
No i don‚Äôt want to fucking sit down 
---
I haven‚Äôt violated any rules here mr morality police, and thus you can bug off now. Idc what you have to say.
---
Thank you 
---
I thought playing Fallout 3 after visiting DC was pretty awesome. I‚Äôm not sure how many locations in this game are real but it would be cool to compare some like the whitesprings and others. 
---
Great job lakke! Fantastic big brain move!
---
Daaaamn, MODUS
---
Could something also be done with her damage resistance or a system that excludes certain players from buffing the queen based on their level, weapons, and armor?  It's frustrating that her damage resistance increases significantly no matter who joins the event.  It's unfair to punish high level players to waste more resources and possibly fail the event because of several very low level players joining.  
---
Which ones do you have?
---
If tou check the offered Items only, a lot of times, they're just wanting to sell you something

Stop taking my workshops. They all belong to me. If you want to rebuild America you'll do it my way or pay the toll in caps.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs guaranteed but there is substation a little north of Watoga. Next to a green water lake. I fast traveled there twice yesterday and was greeted by a deathclaw both times. And both of those times, I got rewarded a night vision scoped lever rifle for its loot. Might just be random but its worth a try.
---
I think you are likely right. But I don't know how to fix it (other than maybe leave for another server and hope for the best). I have crazy fast DSL, and the mouse in my computer runs super fast in his wheel.. so I should be good to go.
---
yes but what i'm saying is that OP here is prob confusing it with the small letters set
---
Hey. I've been through the thick and thin with Diablo III and Elder Scrolls Online too. Fallout 76 will be no different. Deep down, you gotta love them, or it's never gonna work out.
---
Yeah that's my other kick in the balls. I had the video saved of me finding it but it was Jan 2nd so I got comfortable and deleted it thinking everything was fine. (more ammo for keyboard cowboys)
---
Just because you ask nicely doesn‚Äôt mean you get what you want lol. My answer is no I will not stop. You understand no don‚Äôt you? Hope so.
---
So again, it‚Äôs shite service, you‚Äôre con artists, luckily most ppl here have appeared to be smart enough not to bite.
---
Imo trading is the real game until they add more content
---
In this case, they didn't actually open a trade window, it was all just us talking. It just felt like I should have known what he was looking for. The only other option was to play a game of go fish for what we wanted. 
---
Had to defend the ammo depot yesterday from 3 scortchbeast at one andone dropped a shotgum prime ammo plan. I didnt seem to get the receiver plan unless its not universale for shotguns.  Grahm was also in the fight but he didnt do anything cause they never landed. 
---
ah had no idea they scaled. so they always scale to the highest players level?
---
Take a look at the map linked below for a rough idea of whether the area you're in is level appropriate. 
---

---
That should help, but some quests will ask you to go places you're not ready for. Just hide those quests in your pip-boy data tab until you're higher level. In those higher level areas, you'll still see enemies spawn based upon other higher-level player passing through. You have to be on your toes a bit everywhere outside the forest. Decisions to sneak, fight, or run last for awhile through the midgame. 
---
Is this junk you picked up off a duper? And you kept it? That's like stealing counterfeit money. 
---
I have a comment in my initial post saying when I logged in I was happy to see I wasnt banned, due to the wide net of banning... or something like that.  Likely replying to that.
---
 I've seen 2 and 3-star legendaries with glowing green auras, but it's not consistent. 
---
I‚Äôve broken this rule a lot. 
---
No sympathy just reporting on what happened to me. Thanks for your comment anyways though
---
They're not universal. I have pump shotgun prime receiever, but not combat shotgun or double barrel. 
---
Correct. Instead give the danger lizards belly rubs and head scritches
---
When I finally found the last piece of the heavy combat armor plan, after server hopping for about 3 hours, that's basically where it was going. I look damn good in a full suit of HCA.

He was asking about the Damage Resistance, not durability. It affects the durability and condition of crafted gear.
---
No room in the lore? A diverse, highly competitive group of people locked in a confined setting for 25 years (an extra 5 beyond the intended openning) with possible experiments conducted on them (is it wrong to be a bit skeptical on it being a true control vault?).
---
Aaand maybe I'm remembering wrong but not all of the notes around the vault were all rainbows and lolipops, there were some salty folks, at least towards the end.
---
Ultimately, the world as we knew it has ended, sure working together would be great but some people will do whatever it takes for THEIR survival even if it means cutting yours short. Ya know, like raiders.
---
I think so. At least they did in FO4, and most all of the one's I've encountered in FO76 have the single full-heal burst as well. The only one's that didn't were the one's I killed too quickly to allow the heal to trigger. 
---
I can see your point. Not trying to stir anything up just letting everyone know my frustration and situation. I did give the pictures to Bethesda support. Thanks for your time and comment.
---
I can't deny anything you said above. But Fallout 4 had way more content on release than this game. Fallout 4 was also more enjoyable in my opinion in that the game had less glitches and bugs.
---
This has worked for me as well on PC, can confirm.
---
His posted screenshots show 50,000+ of each type of flux. And, per Bethesda's message, it total items in a **30 day period**, not just the snapshot of one moment he thinks is "evidence" of his innocence.
---
Another issue is if I join a server that is currently in a nuke zone without power armor or a hazmat suit equipped.  I have died multiple times before I can do anything because of the radiation.

I have a two shot level 45 and an explosive lvl 35. Damage is i think 129 and 112 respectively with 3 rank 1 gunslingers.
---
Not great but okay for scorched and trash mobs. 
---
Don‚Äôt get irradiated either so there‚Äôs that.  Full charge shots seem a bit underwhelming tho I stick to 2 and 3. 
---
The explosive one seems a bit better despite being a level 35 with less damage on the stat page. 
---
Oh man sick burn coming from the unwashed smash/minecraft player. Really standing on such a high pedestal there.
---
I agree with you on your points, with that being said,  I'm pretty sure that most of the people on this thread that are tired of being grieved don't care what YOU'RE tired of.   I get that it makes "spam" threads, but maybe you wouldn't have to deal with so much "spam" if things were being done about the issue at the heart of the thread without having to wait months for a new game mode.   I don't mind the thought of YOU having to rehash "spam" threads, because if you're seeing it over and over, so are the Bethesda Devs.        I will say that your idea is a solid one, however, if you see a thread that doesn't necessarily apply to you, instead of making an announcement on the thread of what YOU'RE tired of, how bout you do as the Dionne Warwick song says and "walk on by".  Not trying to be a tool dude, but as someone who has spent more time than I should have  rebuilding my base after some clown whose mommy didn't hold them enough with a TSE shotgun destroyed it for no reason,  what YOU'RE tired of doesn't mean jack to me.

My handmade weighs about the same but my 3.. or is it 4 now... 10mm SMGs all weigh 6.3 pounds. Lovely little versatile killing machines. 
---
Certain mobs have max levels, not sure if areas have max levels as well. Whitesprings is a great example, normally the ghouls are around level 20 but when somebody over 50 enters the area they go to 45-68 (being that this is a desirable farm location its rare to see them spawn lower)
---
strange, all the mods plans are there and none recon sensors :)
---
How far did he fast travel for it?
---
Good point. Again all I got is "please believe me"
---
That was a close one lol down to the last minute! I‚Äôm big fan of Gatling plasmas. I‚Äôve just been using 50 cals and AA handmades  they seem to get the job done . Especially the 50 cal just that it shreds thew ammo haha 
---
Said he would come so much he knows me by name :(
---
I will let my community know you have these for sale when I get home!
---
You think that's strange? You should see how we pee!
---
Oh. So do you have it?
---
Yup, same with pre-patch 6 Adrenal Reaction being left in a broken state and players forced to re-apply it.  Should have been hotfixed but they just don't care.

He just went somewhere nearby then back to me and it worked.

Just to the west of the train station near top of the world is a wooded area with at least 4 ponds and some streams. Very tranquil. One of the ponds even has suicidal brahmin that slowly die to rads from the water. They respawn. Free meat.
---
That's a good point!   I'm sure the DEVS can come up with something creative. 
---
I'm wondering what level are all these people that ask for the PvP elements to be removed.
---
Me and my friends all have about 600 hours of gameplay, at the start we completed the quests, our builds and then continued to farm for better equipment.
---
After level 100 the game gets a little boring, anyway you keep farming Whitesprings and the Queen, but after a while you get all the plans and hunting 3* legendaries with this RNG it's usually not rewarding.
---
Right now the only real endgame content is PvP, that brings a little challenge and fun, and if you have pacifist on and don't take any workshop, theres almost no risks.
---
Just watch for armor with "Unyielding, Bolstering, Vanguards, Assassin's, Weightless" for Primaries, AP Refresh for secondary and Tertiary is either Damage reduction while sprinting (Cavaliers) or Damage reduction while standing (Sentinels) Also, people seem to love the -20% weight reduction pieces. Key pieces have 2/3 of those.
---
You can swap out your perk cards at any time? You are only bound to which ones you have chosen. Also, perk packs give you cards that you don't have to select, but when you level up you are not bound by cards that were given via packs. You can select any card that is available according to your level. Card availability is unlocked by character level, not perk packs.

Areas of the map have a level range. When it is time for mobs to spawn in an sub area of that area, the game generates mobs based upon the level of the closest players. If you wondered into top of the world to chase down the radio signal, you can easily run into high level mobs. There is a raider vendor there that high level players will visit and thus spawn high level mobs.

I don‚Äôt get what he‚Äôs trying to prove either. He just proved that he took duped items off the ground which could have pretty much him just dropping duped items from another account to his other.

I‚Äôm a bloodied explosive ranged build with full sentinel‚Äôs assassin‚Äôs. The armor is what really helps. Not many ranged people can kill me, unless they also have sentinel‚Äôs or cavalier‚Äôs assassin‚Äôs. Then, it‚Äôs just a contest of who can hit their vats crit first.

I've seen this bug before. When I've loaded into a server I have technical data under me if I had one in my inventory. Doesn't always happen, and seems to happen if I've picked up more than 1 technical data before turning in. The last time I saw it happen I looted 3-4 data in whitespring bunker doing my vendor runs, went to whitespring station and disconnected, when I loaded in the game I had technical data where a paper bag would spawn had I dropped an item

Why would you steal counterfeit money? Wouldn't the point of stealing be to steal real money? I mean im only going off of TV and Movies here.

Thats the way to go.  I got a 3-star instigating Grognak's axe.  First hit power attack does well over 500.

I agree. Rifle builds need to be competitive.

And more perks in general too.

If you really just picked up junk, then I **am** sorry it happened.

Unfortunately, you're going to find that the number of people on here claiming they're innocent, and wrongfully banned, has jaded many of the people here.

Nuke warheads are usually designed so they can't be accidentally triggered, so shooting one probably won't it go critical.  Just use a Fatman.

Hello, Im lead to believe that this is very limited to the weapons. I dont notice this healing problem on my lever action (which does much more damage than other rifles I have/had) but I noticed this before on weapons such as handmade and combat rifles. Currently carry a two shot handmade and instigating lever action. With the handmade, each shot would damage and then shortly heal, I would have to say, 50-75% of that damage. The only way to over come this is to shoot fast enough that it cant catch up and you kill the enemy. Ive tried slowing down shots that maybe it was client to server lag but even shoot, wait, shoot, wait, still shows up with healing from the enemy. I could then switch over to my lever action and kill the enemy like it wasnt any issue. And to note that this was prior to having legendary weapons as well. The standard handmade and combat rifles were plagued with this issue.

Any legendary with a star in the name will regenerate, a regular legendary without a star won't though.
---
I do too and laugh at myself when just now passing a stackout of super glue in Home Depot my instinct was to grab it all.
---
That‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt taken the time to perfect your build to make your current weapon do as much as it previously did. My lever action does 648, and I can completely destroy almost any player out there.
---
Just wanted to mention to give the legendary a second or two before running off. I don't always see the legendary item immediately on death, so I recheck after a few seconds.
---
Meh. Happens maybe once.
---
A month.
---
Or every couple weeks.
---
I wonder what would happen if everyone complained like this when something didn‚Äôt go their way.

The game isn‚Äôt broken people, you‚Äôll still be able to log on today and have the normal experience...

They used that effect for spontaneous legendary spawns, sometimes an enemy that didn't initially spawn as a legendary will start to glow and turn into one.
---
levels 1-10 are a blast.
---
once you hit level 20-30 you are bored to death farming the same quests that have no rewards and gear that sucks for 50 hours. then someone nukes white springs and you magically level to 50 in 15 minutes and feel like the last 50 hours wasted your life.
---
i want this game to get better so bad but it needs incentives to make the game rememorable and rewarding. right now its bad loot, bad story (or lack there of) and run out of things to do. i dont like that it comes down to playing like an mmo (replay the same dumb parts over and over) instead of an exploring game.
---
But you didn't show your inventory
---
You can starve to death you can die of thirst and if you don‚Äôt have a gas mask you can get lung diseases in certain areas as well as other diseases
---
More intelligence should give it a larger durability bar and more DR. The extra white bar comes from an int perk.
---
It'd be cool if it was guaranteed to proc at least every so many times, but the chances seemed so low I never bother.
---
Yes but often I'm too impatient and end up killing them in one hit.
---
Oh im very aware of that. Thanks for at least thinking I *can be* innocent.
---
I mainly play solo. sometimes I‚Äôll run into randoms who want to team up so I run with them for a bit to level up so I can finish Rose‚Äôs damn quests lol
---
He does for me. I literally get him showing up to about 40-50% of the mobs I attack. Maybe it is also linked to your luck level as I have a 12 luck right now.
---
Just because the game mechanics make it possible to starve to death if you go AFK for 20 hours does not make it a survival game. When is the last time you felt like the hunger/thirst meters were actually dangerous and not just tedious busywork?
---
They are referring to amounts accumulated in a 30 day period (just for clarification)
---
I‚Äôm not even sure what uktracite is tbh. I‚Äôm pretty new to the game still. Only lvl 31

Thanks for your input Mr NPC.

When i had to go map to map looking for food and they empty out every 25 to 30 minutes dude lol

Thanks for the suggestion, I'll check out the YouTube about it.   Kinda sad we have to do things like that in the first place.  
---
It suppresses the effects, for sure the benefits but TBH I don‚Äôt know about the negatives. All I know for sure is that when I took it I couldn‚Äôt  jump or run as I was used to. So now I just do a lot of Radaway. 
---
Something you won't need at all until you're at least 50
---
Nobody cares or believes you just picked that up off the ground.
---
Also, I think I might point out this seems like less of a bug and more of a server latency issue.
---
It's a thing. Had it the other day also.
---
I just ran into this as well. Strange in Numbers seemingly reverses it for my sniper character. My PIP-BOY damage values are less than base damage, and that‚Äôs with Nerd Rage, 9* weapon perks, and a bloodied weapon. 
---
Broadsider‚Äôs AoE is horrendous so if you‚Äôre not hitting them square in the body, that might be your problem.
---
I have an AA one that‚Äôs decent-ish. Definitely does more than slap damage but it‚Äôs a weird gun nonetheless and definitely needs a damage buff and a closer look at its mechanics as a whole.
---
I use it on super mutants more than on smaller enemies since they‚Äôre easier to hit. Takes about 3 shots to kill a high level one, so a whole clip, but the novelty of the gun is still fun even if it‚Äôs terribly inefficient 
---
It would kind of destroy the lore though. Scorchbeasts are hiveminds so they do what the queen says. They also have a plague called The Blight which either kills living things or makes them scorched. They breed so fast that it‚Äôs hypothesized in-game that they will cover the globe if not stopped, and the entire story of the game is you trying to stop them when everyone else failed. 
---
If I saw a person with a baby scorched I would murder them and take my bounty like a man!

All I see is a sea of XP.

A fully modded handmade with 90% weight reduction, is still **14.35** lbs.

Finding armor with 20% weapon weight reduction is a lifechanging event.

Found a CAMP in the middle of no where, half destroyed.

I fixed what I could and went about my day.  Small moments are fun to come across.
---
Well I spent a full 3 hours looking for radaway because my health bar was pretty much red. I‚Äôve had to look for food and stimpacks to heal while I‚Äôm wondering in the middle of a dangerous zone. Sorry you‚Äôre expectations were unrealistic and you got bored. That‚Äôs all there is to it.

Thank you I've got some plans

I'm on my 4th or 5th week of this game and I gotta say I felt and still feel the same way. I'm glad I waited a little bit from release.
---
Yes, but keep in mind that even with a single foundation camp you can screw it up. Don't know how, but keep everything up there simple without any experiments!
---
You do realise that a short fast travel to Flatwoods will give you all the food you ever need, and you begin the game being able to generate an infinite amount of purified water.
---
They are about as 'survival' as getting home from work and going 'oof, pretty hungry, better go to the store'. Are we all bushcraft geniuses because we manage to go day to day without dying on the kerb?
---
Did you also know that enemies are dangerous if you don't kill them? Pretty groundbreaking gameplay right there.
---
Good point. I'm on Xbox. Are you on now? I'll by 2 pair from you.
---
Yeah scorched are just weak and somehow annoying. They lack a bit of challenge. 
---
I also, like I said in the very first line of this post, am not suggesting it's not happening elsewhere. All I'm saying is see people may be confused when they see a legendary heal and I don't want to see a thousand posts saying the same thing when yours may be real it gives your post less credibility. I want your issues to be solved as well. Posts falsely stating the same thing only diminishes the validity of your post.
---
Remarks remarks remarks... And divide your shit up into subroutines.  
---
No manager anywhere should make a coder skip on those two things.  
---
Oh yeah, 76 is not only a buggy mess of a game, but a ton of its core mechanics are just lazy and awfully implemented. I agree with you there. I wish they had just released a proper game in the first place. But here we are.
---
It's very easy to do. Build a pyramid for myself at the edge of the map last night. Totally secure
---
That would suuuuuuuck, lol. I'd much rather take Fallout 3 on Fallout 4's engine.
---
I thought the game was fun until I got to level 50ish. I haven‚Äôt played it in months 
---
I have 15 luck :(
---
Just trying to log data and report my findings on other builds but I failed haha
---
Here it is again 'You have played this game to much that is why you are bored' when specifically talking about a game-as-a-service. A game literally designed to keep people playing.
---
Two big factors I‚Äôve seen are vats and enemy DR.  If I Vats to the head with a shotgun it seems to apply all pellet damage to the head.  Free aim, on target close range a little less damage, than vats, so some pellets hit torso?  Single shot weapons don‚Äôt seem to do this a lot, but I think that‚Äôs the game mechanic on shot accuracy sending the bullet off the head.  Then DR, shooting a scorched between head and leg, not much of a difference, shooting a super mutant head vs leg bigger difference, but not crazy.  
---
The sheer time, and scope of resources this would require is unrealistic. The video seems pedestrian and  a "play to the salty redditors" tune we've all heard time and time again. Why people waste their time watching stuff like this and sharing it- I have no idea.  I prefer to walk upright and organize my own thoughts instead of rip a bong, pop adderall and bang out essays about what could be. Sure loads of things could be different but reality is a motherfucker. Scope bloat exists in all projects and plans. It's a factor you have to account for when deciding where to invest time and resources. Some things can't be sorted out with lean and 6- sigma. In our minds were all Steven Spielberg and   Bill Gates. We can hop on Reddit and dissect any myriad of issues and act like it's Soo easy all the while postulating why the people we criticize were too blind to " get it". This crowd celebrates itself and like little lobsters never really succeed at anything but petty little victories. Killing things people love because under paid bloggers and journalist are desperate for a buck and click bait. Go ahead buy in gang, but the road map looks great, the game is great. I feel bad for everyone wasting their time telling people why they think something is bad in a thread that is supposed to be about sharing information for those partaking in something and enjoying.
---
tl dr?
---
Then get off Reddit because the title hints that clearly:
---
 " there be some READING required here, you twit."
---
Survival mode is supposed to drop pretty soon, apparently it is going to be PVP centric.  
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt need him strong, just adding him for build purposes and some utility lol
---
I stayed away from it for an entire month and changed my stream theme and everything, but I kept a ln eye here for the news because I still love the IP and want it to get better.  This place is the real news.
---
Don‚Äôt hoard! Pay attention to your junk weights. Some stuff weighs an insane amount.
---
why the fuck are people like you on this sub?
---
There needs to be some benefit to fighting the SOB's.
---
They now spawn in defense events for the munitions factory. The stupid bastards never land, so by the time you can shoot down 1 lvl 60 and 2 lvl 50's, every buildable item in the factory is completely broken. 
---
I just finished watching the entire video.  Here's my take.
---
While many of Jon's suggestions might make the game a better game in many ways, I don't think I would play it.  The two big pain points for me are his ideas to make the game more challenging and to make it less solo-player-friendly.  I don't play Fallout games for a challenge, and I don't really want to play with others.  
---
I am in agreement with a lot of his points about the grind and the mechanics of how a lot of things work, though.  He's right when he points out how silly it is to scrap weapons to learn mods that aren't even on that weapon, or how some harder-to-craft foods give no more benefits than easy ones, etc. etc.  Even though his ideal Fallout 76 is not mine, I do completely respect his POV and I think he is right about a lot of the things that the game gets wrong.
---
Not that anyone gives two shits what I think :-)
---
If one shoots a nuke in other FO games they pop
---
A-fucking-men and fuck Bethesda and any future games. They showed their true colours with Fallout76 and I'm convinced many of the defenders are paid by the comment.
---
Yes but you‚Äôre also supposed to take breaks. You don‚Äôt have to play all day every day mate. *You* are doing most likely doing that. I would only assume that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre so toxic. 
---
I havn't seen any real pvp since beta. Everything since is griefing and I have been with groups of griefers while they do it and then leave: 
---
a. find a guy at a shop
---
b. hit him obnoxiously for 2minutes until the guy responds
---
c. oh you have a uber bleed build and now they hit back and instant die so you can get their stuff
---
yay. that is just lame.  this is not UO inspired like they said it would be. its a joke
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt think they particularly care, it been obvious for a while they never intended to release the game on PC but some time into its development they had an about turn on this decision.
---
What? BGS is a computer game company first and foremost. They have said it over and over all of their games are designed for the PC first and then ported to consoles. This game is no different. 
---
&gt;So perhaps you can educate me a little more about legendaries, can you get ultra light and the trait that turns you invisible on the same piece of legendary armour?
---
Here is a link to answer all those kinds of questions:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_armor_effects
---
Yeah it‚Äôs known issue. It isn‚Äôt just your camp, but it can show up at any fast travel / spawn point.
---
Reminds me of the Ray Gun
---
yeah this was not a well thought out pvp system
---
What happened to the stickied thread for Feedback and issues? Mods got rid of it?
---
A new bug I am running into is after getting in or getting out of the excavator PA, my secondary weapon is unselected for loading. so when I try to switch weapons I become unarmed. Haven't tested on all PA. I am on Xbox and teammate I mentioned this to did not experience it
---
Did you poll everyone on the planet? Geez that was fast. Can I get the results? 
---
oh brother
---
Oh yeah. I don‚Äôt want to assume him to be either guilty or innocent. If it‚Äôs a genuine issue, take it up with support and take the issue up there. But If someone is just interested in getting commenters all riled up, then shut up and move on.
---
Do you have a younger sibling? If so, have them button mash for you.
---
Just look at the map after a nuke was launched. You have to be within the red circle
---
WV is a nice place, certainly more pleasant than the cultural and social wasteland known as Rockville, Maryland (where Bethesda unironically makes camp).  If this is your first visit to the U.S., I suggest you don't take travel advice from folks who haven't ever gone outside a major city and wouldn't last a day if they did.
---
Yeah I had fun the first 10 hrs or so as well. Just wait.
---
wait some more. that seems to resolve it for me
---
They could still offer hotfix's for the PC players, which would also actually work out well as a kind of "beta testing" the fixes to make sure they don't break something else. Kind of like how they completely broke adrenal reaction.
---
The other time this happened it was 500 and I was still there for 15 minutes
---
I like this, or possibly just have it all drop in a 'crashed vertibird' or some other appropriate container.
---
My camp is located right around that spot. That location isn't quite close enough to prevent people building alongside the club house, unfortunately.
---
What are you running on your X-01? 
---
Id also like to point out that some tracks go up some steep ass hills.  Real trains cant go up a massive incline like that, with all that weight. Maybe the Fallout ones can idk.
---
This game has been out for 4 months. Do you realise how casually you could play the game and still be well past 200 hours? And guess what, every week there are new posts coming in with their 'Hey guiz I just bought this and don't see why everyone is bored, I really enjoyed leaving Vault 76 and it seems cool so far'.
---
And every week 'Hey if you are bored you played to much'. Guess what, when they were designing this game, when they were putting in repeatable content, dailies, atom stores, they were thinking 'How can we keep people playing as long as possible?' Now the fact that the first predictable line is 'If you are bored you play to much' is proof of their abject failure to create a game that fits the medium.
---
'The best way to enjoy the game is to not play', what a tag line.
---
 Fully leveled and 200% repaired Serrated Combat Knife is so fast they just die. Try it. ;)
---
If you shoot the panel on the protectron's back it will go insane and attack everybody. I'm sure same with mr handy but i didn't try that
---
That is correct. I took pictures before it went into my inventory so i would know how to split it 3 ways with affecting things i already had. In hindsight, at these numbers who actually cares right?
---
Calling it a rant doesn't make what you said any better. I feel betrayed by Bethesda. Their actions prove the company is not concerned enough about quality. Ranting like this covers up chances to change their method.
---
The zone is determined by the targeting of the nuke.  Once the nuke is launched, you can see the giant red circle on your map. Inside is the zone, taking rads, bad monsters, happy flora etc. Outside is regular world.   
---
I think the spot you are referring to is Survey Camp Alpha (which is SE of the Train station), that rarely gets nuked itself, although it often gets visits from flyingdeathstereos... :)   
---
(and look for Power Armor mods/plans to the left of the Power Armor station)  
---
Then again, there are a lot of "places with Tents" (Brotherhood forward camps/missile sites) in the Cranberry Bog...  
---

---
I think that would be really cool if it was consistent. Keep some typical legendary spawns, yeah, but give every normal mob over a certain level some small percentage to mutate into a legendary after it reaches a health threshold. It could give a new sense of caution to the wasteland (for lower levels, a nice surprise for anyone who can handle themselves) as well as a small addition to the immersion. Can‚Äôt expect us to just look at a creature and know all of the stats on it, ya know?
---
Yes of course all those people who didn't like it must just not have been thinking for themselves. Your experience is the one true enlightened experience.
---
Lying about this would be implaisible- look I barely got any attention
---
I heared a rumor that Bethesda (or a branch of them) made this game with single player as its sole intent. The game built on top of this version of its engine was not designed as an online game. But, this is just speculation.
---
It would have been a better game, if Bethesda had just developed this game properly by holding it back a year or so. But they needed an 'in between' game to keep their share holders and investors happy. That's my conclusion about this game. It fell prey to business squabble. Art should never be influenced by investor's incentives and pressure.
---
I don't know of a faster way to get rid of them but good news! I don't think that bug happens anymore so you might not need to do the removal again. Watch YouTube videos and roll your thumb between the 2 buttons 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm going to keep my eye out.  I feel like I‚Äôve dumped these pieces back in the day when I wasn‚Äôt really chasing a specific build.  Now I‚Äôm at 165 and I think I regret it haha #noragrets
---
Guess I'll have to do that. Thanks for the feedback 
---
I have certainly across this "bug", but it was several patches ago. Also, I'd like to point out to everyone looking here. This is likely due to server latency and shots registering locally but the server not logging them. Then the server catches up and adjusts the monster health "instantly" to what the server  thinks it should be and updates it for the player. Less of a bug and more of a server stability issue. That's just my opinion. Perhaps people with this issue should check their internet connection. I'm not saying that's the cause. Don't get butthurt. I'm not calling everyone's internet crappy. I'm just trying to find a solution just like you. It could very well be Bethesda just has more back end work to do.
---
Had a thread about this before - you can ride a SB into battle if you wear only a loincloth and carry only a spear, and all your gear forever smells like farts.
---
Did you notice the dog helmet? Sometimes drops during Queen fights. It's likely they'll give us pets for our camps and all our "suggestions" are just a waste of our own time.
---
I did have a cool idea for that that should make the game more interesting without removing the challenge: Companions for workshops.
---
You just took grafton and killed 50 super mutants, what if your guy could collect ALL that gear and pool it for you? Might even help with server stability.
---
Collects all your crops at camp. Maybe you could even whistle for your Dogmeat out in the world and he'd collect everything within 50 feet.
---
I was kindof disappointed after completing that mission for commendation points, and that was it.. it was over. I was expecting some sortof repeatable quest or challenge to get rewards. 
---
Just because the smug was little, doesn't mean it doesn't have it's own wants and desires.
---
Because people were trying to escape/use the rail stations and refuge?  Look at the various stations,  tents and such set up,  luggage everywhere.
---
Ok so that can happen... Than you for believingr and no accusing me of being a liar. I just wondered. 
---
I know that and again this is all I got. The absence of evidence in my case is purely because I didnt think I'd need any.
---
Happened to me aswell, but it was 2000~ water purifiers. Made a macro on my keyboard and went afk. Dont know of any other solution.
---
Turn off your damn microphone if you're eating. No one wants their immersion ruined by some dude cr√∂nching on Doritos with the sound quality of an answering machine from 1983.
---
Yep!
---
I watched them because I need to know exacly when to buy fo76. And not the 10 min reviews mind you. The recent 2 and a half hour video of suggestions, plus Peterson's videos, plus I look at this subreddit from time to time.
---
I would love to buy fo76, I enjoyed the combat loop of 4, so I will probably enjoy this one too, but I'm leaving being the early adopter to others.
---
Recent players list requires friending to fast travel to them.  Have to go to their profile and join from there ( i use this method to rejoin when I get disconnected from a server during a nuke job.  Like Gundarkopia said, just appear offline or get their tag and ban them from your profile.
---
Sounds good, even if it turns out to be torso, i learned dp leather limbs, so I can mod it for you
---
If the bug is still around it's happening when you move your camp. I had to delete 25 of everything that was in my camp to make my current camp so I feel your pain :(
---
My lord, is that legal?
---
Tbh I'm tired of playing old BGS games and like 76 and hope the future is awesome for this title and whatever else we might get one day! Fo:nv, fo3, for, and skyrim were amazing but I'm more excited about the now and the future
---
Yeah, She's my third character but it's super cool. It's slow at first since you can't just charge your luck out of the gate, but once you hit the high 30s it becomes awesome. Every shot is either a crit or charges a crit.
---
Hmmm... *shrug*
---
I'd really love:
---
Global Chat - Everyone that is online in my region (not sure how it's set up currently, if it's all of North America on one server or NA East, NA West, etc.). This is also an ESSENTIAL grouping tool. Launched a nuke and need help killing SBQ? Let people know in Global. 
---
Server Chat - Just my current server, so I can tell people "hey, left some free plans, ammo, etc. in the Whitesprings cash register".
---
Party Chat - Obviously for party only.
---
Whisper Chat - whisper a particular player.
---
Your Honor, sure there is overwhelming evidence against me but, if you knew me personally, I would be far to lazy to kill that guy.
---
It's a known bug.. probably 5-10 topics on this exact thing per day. It's your own technical data that drops(or someone elses if they spawned there), if you have the "Forgotten Knowledge" quest, and if you pickup more than 1 technical data. Put technical data in the search bar at the top of the page to see the other topics, and maybe get some extra answers there too.
---
Somewhere, there may be a poor unfortunate soul who has no idea duping existed and picked up a paper bag. It's like christmas to them. Anyway, "everybody is a duper but every duper will say otherwise." Im not saying you're a duper, OP or a duper hunter or whatever since there is absolutely no way for the community to prove which is which other than blind trust and people are less likely to give you that since a lot of us have been screwed with the way the dupers did their thing. With that being said, I wish you good luck and try to move on. That's all I can give.
---
Thanks for sharing but you're kinda late, lol.
---
I love these people that say they put so much time into the game and that‚Äôs how they know it‚Äôs terrible. 
---
If it was so terrible, then why did you sink over 100 hours into it? Lol
---
More like they really enjoyed most of it but once they finished it they decided to be cool (like all those super cool youtubers /s)  and shit on it.
---
You are correct sir 
---
Tagged a couple of them in the last week and the second one dropped some decent stuff.  Went to work with my modded 50 cal and finished it off w/2 shot Gauss near Whitespring Station. 
---
Sweet!  Thanks!!
---
There were trailer trucks in fallout 4 that also had doors that could open. There are some that have dented doors that can be noticed are dented from a distance that cannot be opened. A door that is not dented can be picked and opened. I didnt realize this until I was 125+ hours into FO4
---
They would need to ban people for life that spam, and have the option to leave global chat. At $40-60 per game license, I couldn't see it being a huge deal.
---
I got the impression those were setup by the Responders.
---
Some quests may have to be put off until later for you. They designed them to be completed as you level up, and get stronger
---
My point is, you knew what was in that bag was all duped. Picking it up and keeping it is akin to stealing a bunch of counterfeit stuff.
---
Wasn't in quotes, took me a second. That's funny! I like you. You can stay.
---
Or the other response: ‚Äúoh yeah? Wait until you hit 7,000 hours. THEN tell me how much you like it, smart guy?‚Äù
---
No.  No one saw it.
---
/s
---
Did you buy the plan for the T60 jet pack?  Its the only mod I‚Äôm missing for mine. 
---
What are you talking about? Nobody saw that.
---
After the roadmap, that is obvious.  Thanks for what you guys do here, if you dont hear it enough.  It does get broken record sounding, but being the guy who talks to the customers then to the engineers is rough.
---
Dont forget you can destory people's bases while in passive mode and not get a bounty 
---
Farming, fight clubs, just finding someone to level up with if you're new or just want to level up in a party on a new character. 
---
Say you go to the trouble of launching a nuke at the Prime Fissure site but can't kill the SBQ. Announce it in the Discord and get some heavy hitters in there to kill her.
---
Or trading, there's lots of that.
---
&gt; The law doesn't apply to FO76 because it took effect for games released after Jan 1, 2019
---
Then it's not the law for this game...
---
&gt; and fuck anyone who thinks that people with disabilities should be left behind in gaming.
---
Can you imagine forming an opinion and delivering it to others while not being a hostile douchecanoe? Crazy, right? It's almost as if not being a complete twat will help people side with you and understand your position more. Also please oh please point out all these fictitious boogeymen who are saying they think people with disabilities should be left behind in gaming that you are so bravely standing up to. 
---
NAXX OUT PogChamp
---
I had two scorchbeast attack me a couple days back. After I killed them they vanished , leaving me with no loot for my troubles....
---
Up your ass
---
Tbh all I want in this game is a few npc characters. Like everytime we have to go find someone we already know they‚Äôre dead. It‚Äôd be cool to sprinkle in a few living ones for the quests. 
---
Other than that, I just got the game a few weeks ago and I‚Äôm loving it.
---
Oof. Well, I just saw it. My b everyone. 
---
The struggle is real. I was out with my wife shopping. I was listing scrap that I could get from items at the 'At Home' store. To this she responded that I play too much.
---
My friend bought the plan and I gave him the mats. He got super excited when I told him about using marsupial, strange in numbers and a jetpack to basically fly anywhere. Immediately went to buy the jetpack plan from vendor bots Phoenix haha
---
Yep, i do know about the perimeter of the nuke zone. Was just wondering about that tent area SE (thanks for the clarification m) of Watoga TS (WTS). I've not ventured much further than the area between WTS and the tents. That's where I found the mutated ferns. I was inside the nuke zone perimeter looking around stands of trees. The issue is that I wasn't picking up the glowing Fern and I'm obviously not wandering into the zone enough.
---
They only spawn as lvl20 and with meagre dmg but it‚Äôs fast and improves significantly with Artisan and weapon mods
---
I‚Äôm lvl 120 and the scorchbeast is no joke. It doesn‚Äôt cause me a lot of damage due to perk build but I burned through a lot of .50 ammo before I dropped it.  
---
You ask why but i'm pretty sure your mind is too closed to hear the answer.
---
Complex = fun. Everyone upvoting this plays in a really boring way, and after their first character they'll probably solo with another. Mindlessly grinding PVE where there aren't even any NPCs is boring. Playing 1/2 a game is boring.
---
I'll never be able to relate to buying a PVX title then asking for it to be more analogue. Survival mode will come, most PVPers will migrate, and the issue will be solved.
---
It's like you all hate excitement and can only imagine speed running Dark Souls instead of the natural 6 player.
---
This is awesome. I‚Äôve been going around trying to buy up all the plans just to have everything. Now I‚Äôve got something else to try. Awesome. 
---
I'm a clown your the one who is getting laughed at here buddy ;] 
---
guess its tve flatwood-monster.
---
Folks would actually start hunting scortchbeast and going to fissure sites rather than avoiding them.  All they are now are ammo sponges
---
The only killable alien in the game is the flatwoods monster, a very rare cryptid
---
https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/474259-fallout-76-flatwoods-monster-location-how-to-beat
---
Yes definitely. I've made a lap around whitesprings just waiting and they do eventually load in. For all the people saying they're loot is empty. Most likely the server is just way behind and they're not waiting long enough to see the loot.
---
 Only some of us! Some will sell you all the chems you want, some will build creepy trap rooms (heyyo!) And admittedly some of us want to eat you. 
---
Personally long pig is too chewy. 
---
Thanks a lot man got it for a really good deal and downloading now:)
---
I just got through killing a 3 star ghoul at White Springs and it had nothing. Plus the underpowered guns are still annoying the crap out of me.  
---
The Dev's intend you to organize a pacifist clan but you're too smart for that.
---
I will make it legal
---
What a douche bag. There are topics worth being hostile over.
---
Thanks person! No I totally knew about duping I just knew it would for sure get people in trouble so I never performed it. Also im lazy (see other comments on this). I'm even willing to admit that when i found this bag I knew for a fact it had to have come from someone performing duping. However the fact does remain that I never once performed the glitch.
---
I'm waiting for good news to come through. I also enjoy watching a fire burn. 
---
Which suggestion is too petty for you?
---
Put in a support ticket
---
no, I was sure it's availible in the vendor
---
Need a TL;DR
---
GNOMED!
---
Thanks I haven't cringed this hard in weeks.
---
Bad internet is not the cause, or at least not the only one. It is a server issue. But thinking that a lot of people just can't tell the difference from an enemy that won't die and an enemy that needs a few more hits to die comes across as trying to sweep a known bug (or whatever you want to call a bug that is server side) under the rug. I don't know -- when I read threads when people report this, it's like two conversations are going on talking about two different things with at least one group trying to convince another that they're not experiencing what they are experiencing.
---
Bethesda has more work to do. That's the nature of online games in general, and moreso with ones with a lot of bugs, whether they're client or server side bugs.
---
You know, Fallout 76 is the second time that I've experienced this sort of reaction in only a few short years. I played and still enjoy occasionally, Battlefront 2. I have loved every minute of my time in Fallout 76. 
---
I think at this point I've decided to try and not "feed the beast" as it where. Everytime somebody posts about something they hate on social media or through YouTube, you'll get even more people sharing it and drawing attention to it either positively or negatively. 
---
"Hey guys, look at this YouTuber shitting all over Fallout 76", and it'll be heavily watched and shared again by people who either agree or disagree with it. Best to just ignore it and let this trend just go away. If you see something you think you might like, try it out and make your own judgements. Don't let other people dictate and decide for you, negatively or positively. 
---
Glad you're having fun, welcome to Appalachia. Please try the water in Huntersville. 
---
I'm on it. I'm trying to come up with one, it was a lot of ideas packed into one post. 
---
Play it a few more days lol
---
I think I‚Äôd trade a few turrets for a grafton monster throwing poop at people.
---
Whenever I kill the Grafton Monster by Hemlock Holes - He has a couple Snarlly monster things with him... Which have Antiseptic.   
---
If you're on the PS4 I can help. 
---
nice RP as the guy late outta of the vault buddy . good stuff
---
I'm at work now, so I can't answer, but what does Jon say about grind? Personally I love that 76 has some of the "action RPG" feel that games like Diablo 3 and Path of Exile have. I don't mind grinding, although right now it's a bit frustrating because the thing we're supposed to grind - SBQ, is a ton of work without much payoff, while killing ghouls in Whitesprings is just boring. PoE with it's mapping system is great. Diablo 3's greater rifts were also extremely fun. Right now it's just weird though. It's like Fallout 76 wants to be an ARPG PvE grind game like Warframe / PoE / Diablo 3, but Fallout games have been traditionally single player story driven / exploration games that focus on player choice. There really isn't any choice in Fallout 76.
---
I'm one of the few that enjoys those games but also likes Fallout though.
---
You realize the game legitimately has a mountain of issues and people dont like it because of those, not because "YouTube." What you are doing is actual fanboyism
---
 Just one calibrated Leg so far. Some extra carry, but a Jet Pack is what I want. My alt has one and I used it in Fallout 4 a lot. Its just nice to hop on a bus and drop mines on the ghouls. ;)
---
Funny how I pointed this bug out (back in patch 3-4) via video my post got downvoted and deleted haha. I wasn't even been a jerk about it either. (At least imo)
---
Didnt know armor like that exists.
---
You know what I need? Mr Handy weak spots.
---
Yeah killing a legendary and getting NOTHING is one of the most annoying things in this game. I waste that much ammo and HP on these bastards only for me to get jack all? It's like Bethesda is giving me the finger.
---
I wish we could use the Bend Will shout on them so we could rid...
---
wait wrong game 
---
PVE + PVP is next level gaming, what better way to do it than on a shop where there are build options too. 12v12 shop PVP is the natural end game, what are you all doing that is more fun?
---
welcome to last week
---
Fus!
---
go to blackwater mine there is some easy radiation and a decontamination arc there to use 
---
I haven‚Äôt played in well over a month but it‚Äôs good to see that all the same issues still exist..........
---
Look I agree with you. But I also think you may underestimate how dumb people can be reguarding online games and servers. 
---
Post titles that don't end with punctuation (or do end w/ ellipses) seem to get flagged. Usually adding a period to mine gets them through ... ymmv  
---
Nice camp!
---
Ro!
---
I‚Äôll make sure to try that next time I‚Äôm at Dyer Chem getting throttled by 5 Colonels at once, thanks! 
---
If you replace the entire list with "swing a deathclaw gauntlet over and over until it stops moving" it would reflect my playstyle perfectly.
---
thx..it was only a test..i have the serums on my main character..but i heard about the ways ppl forced mutations so i wanted to try on my alt
---
Best way to fix it is to refund everyone and burrow the physical copies in the desert.
---
Legendary wood b doesn't grow on trees you know...
---
Same
---
I can be on 6-7pm Eastern time, small window I know.  I could do it after Wednesday as well. (two day work trip)
---
It's 2019 have you even heard of a live stream? Dark Ages indeed. It's a 25 player game if you're not on a live stream - the intended hub - you're medieval probably playing solo, or a total cave man always encumbered.
---
Just in case no one said it: the chat in Warframe is toxic and detracts from the experience. Gamers are nasty.
---
I‚Äôm can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs serious and what‚Äôs r/gamingcirclejerk 
---
Lmfao omg this 
---
D'oh! ... Mmm doughnuts. 
---
I dunno man, it IS nice to be able to nuke someone who has a turret base at Whitesprings with the orbital strike beacon. 100% worth the 100 cap bounty.
---
U finna play tn 
---
I seriously appreciate your honesty
---
 Well get in there. Its dangerous hanging around outside. ;)
---
Having only experience in FO4, I found most melee enemies can be crippled easily by going for the legs. Nothing funnier than some massive legendary getting hobbled and then slowly whacking away at it with a melee. 
---
If I visit a camp and a tuba is present you bet your ass that thing is getting played.  Hail Tuba!
---
Ummm, what?
---
Now I need someone to mod that into Skyrim...a shout that turns your enemies into doughnuts...
---
I'd kill a scorchbeast for a handful of screws. Better than the rough screwing they're currently giving us.
---
It's treason then
---
 Give r/fo76 about 3 months. When the tryhards and wannabe streamers move onto the newest product in line (anthem for example taking hits left and right) the sub will be a haven like r/fo76filthycasuals, and give r/fallout a year. In a year of content and story updates, and established groups in a freeform method (who you meet in the wasteland, not necessarily the biggest "clan" in the game) then the old school fallout players are going to go on a new quest for a water chip and encounter ken yung the 22 year old from Missouri rp'ing the Shi, or players like me with nice inviting deathtraps. Theyre going to stumble around going "but... the brotherhood can't lose" 
---
I play on ps4 and i can't say I've had any problems with enemies healing them selves other than the legendary ones that heal one or two times. I was at white springs yesterday and had three legendary enimies one no stars one two star and one three star the corpse dissappeard just as i went to loot it. Needless to say i was not happy never had a problem with this until yesterday. Also i killed a scortch beast which upon death fell into a fisher crack i was able to loot the corpse but ended up falling in and dying. I was not able to reclaim my dropped loot when i came back i understand that falling into a fisher means instant death but maybe either make it where you can grab your loot at least when this happens or possibly make enimies not be able to fall into it? 
---
By the way there were only 3 people on the server and the other two were at the power plant in the forest so no one picked up my loot
---
Thank you for doing your part Redditor
---
 I killed it 3 times in a week, just lately.. 
---
Do you usually accept meat from strange men? üòÇ
---
&gt; If it was so terrible, then why did you sink over 100 hours into it? Lol
---
Usually people do that to see if it gets better in the endgame or to try and get their money's worth if they bought it at full price like me.  I legitimately think it is up there with the worst games I have ever played, and I put so many hours into it because I bought it on launch with a friend and we were just trying to play together.  We both stopped playing about a month and a half ago, the only actual fun was how hilariously over the top all the bugs were.  There is no actual story, you are just following someone else's story
---
Hey all! We are aware of this one and tracking down a fix. I don't have an ETA to share right now, but we'll let you know once the fix is ready to roll out in a patch. Thanks for your reports!
---
I sure did know. But at the end of the day this is a game that makes resources pretty scarce. If you're wanting to make real world comparisons heres one: I'm very doubtful that anyone in this situation in the real world (post-Apocalypse) would sit there and think "Hmmmm, did this come from a reputable source?" As sure as I am doubtful that anyone's first thought if they find a bag of money is "I should figure out who this belongs to." Even if thats their second thought, Im sure its not their first.
---
\*Also aware that in the real world if you found a paper bag with \~750k Lbs in it you need to find a scientist (if any left) right away.
---
I doubt anyone that got banned were still playing or had anything major left to do. If anything the things that got us banned is what kept us playing for more than one month anyways.
---
Good to know thanks! 
---
Wow... So your just a dick... Understood.
---
the rad shower will get rid of the mutation tho..no?
---
Known issue.
---
Hahaha :)
---
Me too. Tried it several times over the last weeks. 
---
That works for me. (5pm CST for me) Is it 750 for both legs or 1500?
---
I'd guess you have the top of the world quest to the radio array and/or the find your friend in lewiston quest.    
---
The first time I did path of the wind, I was teamed with a lvl 65 player, I was sub lvl 10. 
---
All I could do was hide - Mutants lvl 48+.
---
The 2nd time through Path...., I was a 27 running solo.  All scorched 1-6, and mutant 5-25.
---
  Hit your map button and pan over the yellow dots (other players).  anyone with a large level number that is in an area you want to go (or are) will likely spawn higher level enemies.  
---
Stay on the left side of the map in the green.  You can also  handle most of the stuff north by the alligator.
---
For example, the grafton steel plant is usually L5 and L10 mutants outside, L15-20 inside.  
---
Grafton dam is similar, but larger number simultaniously - I dont recommend melee for either one.
---
Right along the savage divide can be doable to iffy depending on who else is around.
---
Bottom left and the right half of the map...I'd say avoid for now.
---
Eh, it does, but... MIRV nukes/MIRV grenades are kind of broken right now. They don‚Äôt split properly. The TS MIRV looked like it launched 2 groups of stacked mini nukes, that then ‚Äúsplit‚Äù at whatever range they split at. But after that the submunitions went invisible, and while it did go off in a series of flashes, it wasn‚Äôt a very large amount of area. It seemed more like all the submunitions were right on top of each other, it was just the area of the TS two nukes. 
---
Still waiting for you to show me all these people who are saying they think "people with disabilities should be left behind in gaming" you brave ally of the differently abled. Also, no - text emotes in a video game isn't a "topic worth being hostile over" in any sense of the word, you really are on a roll today.
---
Great and insightful thoughts! Hopefully one of two people from Bethesda read this so they can make the game better. Thanks for caring Complication!
---
Hey now we can't have people going to fissures to farm scorchbeasts. Pff farming end game enemies what's this game coming to.
---
*Turns Alduin to a doughnut and eats him*
---
Really enjoy it too. Met a higher level guy who just gave me some better guns and ammo and then just sent me on my way which was so nice. Then about 20 minutes later I bumped into three level 80+ T***s who thought it was a good idea to kill a level 7 who's minding his own business 
---
*anything* that recovers RAD damage will make it go away. You need Starched Genes luck perk
---
Agree, killed the game for me. It's only saving grace is the Fallout world with friends and it keeps you from seeing your friends but the fact that it STILL exists irks me a lot.
---
Why in the world are you worried about what Reddit thinks?
---
Post your issues in a constructive way and don't worry about it.  You did your part.
---
Not power armor; that‚Äôs on legendary non-PA.
---
Hey you know what would be a neat mod? Something like a tactical harness mod for your arms in PA that reduced weapon or ordnance weights. That‚Äôs be cool. 
---
The people who keep repeating that OP will be downvoted for liking the game are just as annoying as the people who blindy hate the game.
---
Up voted because its funny how late you are. 
---
Still have the broadsider? I would love that for my pirate build :D
---
Why do you respond to this and not to all the requests for basic patches and functionality?
---
I know your job must be difficult but the seemingly deaf void to which the concerns regarding 76 and Bethesda's disregard for its fanbase are rather depressing for long-time Bethesda games fans. 
---
Damn, I was hoping it was like FISTO's "thruster". :P
---
Loktar ogar!
---
Thruster is #1 but it‚Äôs hard to hit, I go for the eyes.  They cripple easy and it throws them off.  
---
What are you playing on. I got some good pieces on Xbox I think
---
The protectrons just kind of slowly crawl after you by dragging themselves along. Makes me laugh every time.
---
Hmmm yes I agree, shallow and pedantic 
---
Just to show the other side of the story here - 
---
I'm a level 235 with a bloodied, explosive harpoon gun. I took Hemlock Holes last night to get some acid. I had a level 30 player attacking me non stop.
---
And you know what? He did really respectable damage to me. Even killed me once when he got the jump one me and started firing before I could move (damn you load times!). I think I got 200 caps off of him from all of his deaths, but when he finally killed me, he got 235 due to my level. 
---
So what I'm saying is, don't necessarily think that higher level = stronger. The scaling is pretty damn balanced in this game.
---
Dude... You've already posted this in the actual market, this isn't the place for these kinds of posts. 
---
Thanks I usually do pop the eyes off first. Good to know!
---
Username checks out
---
I am absolutely convinced something can be done for those that are deaf and literally can't hear or for those that simply do NOT want to use voice ...that is actually better to communicate with than the current emotes. maybe its not text, maybe it is but I cannot stand the current system, it bothers me more than the current bugs and disconnects....
---
Have any lever actions on those mules? I‚Äôm looking for a non explosive.
---
Preferably instigating with VATS bonuses
---
I had the health regen on enemies where they wouldn't die.  It was happening with the weapon I had equipped when I logged in. I also had the problem that sometimes with that equipped weapon it displayed the wrong ammo amount or said I didn't have any ammo or wrong ammo for this weapon (something like that).  Switching to another weapon and back seems to fix the issue
---
Am I? I just got an email today  :( also I dont browse this sub often 
---
I looked over some details, i'm no lawyer but i disagree with your assertion that games need to add extra functions. Adding subtitles is one thing but instituting text chat is not required to enjoy or play the game.
---
Pretty sure 99% of the complaints are from solo players proving this isn't a need. Everything is 75% easier for me with a team.
---
Additionally you cannot force all games with any type of MP to add text chat.
---
Furthermore i'm confused that all of you aren't visiting and organizing on live streams, the natural hub.
---
 Vault Tech Agricultural Research near Flatwood has lots.
---
Ranged stealth would just like Bethesda to remove the bs they purposely implemented where a mob that can't reach you will leash back to out of range and heal to full.
---
My thoughts are some asshole wanted to nerf ws farming even more by screwing with people killing from the wall.
---
This is likely where he heal bug originates too, and it never should've been done.
---
Ranged snipers are a thing in fallout, whether they like it or not.  
---
Dude, the dev‚Äôs in this sub are relatively pretty on point with responses compared to other subs.
---
He can respond to this post because he doesn‚Äôt need to address a complex issue that he may not have an answer for at the moment. 
---
Have had this exact issue way more than once, and last night on the last stage of Mayor for a Day.  My teammate came out of the elevator invisible.  Even worse, there have been times when a teammate is invisible on the main map, so you can't respawn to them when you die.  Extremely frustrating...
---
No, do the research your damn self, it's all over Google and Reddit. I'm not your damn life coach.
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **6th Cakeday** bottomlesscoffee! ^(hug)
---
OK. First I feel people are using the term ' griefer' as interchangeable with ' someone killed me once'. To me griefing means getting your stuff destroyed or being killed repeatedly by the same person . 
---
Second , as lame as it is to be on the other side of that I'm assuring those people are having fun too.. As unfortunate as that is , they are paying customers too. 
---
Third,  none of these posts have gotten to even 1k votes..  Normally they seem to Peter out around 300-500 up votes...  I haven't been tracking them , so maybe I am off and one or more got up voted to something even remote ly note worthy. 
---
Fourthly,  I've suggested some actual decent ideas to how to curb this issue. Unlike posts like this one that are just noise, with no actual realistic suggestions . Just saying split pvp and pve down the middle isn't a realistic solution.  Unless certain aspects of the core game functions are adjusted to keep it balanced.
---
Final point, Im asking for them to make a stickied thread so we can actual collect meaningful data and thoughts over a longer period of time.  Why wouldn't you want a stickied thread instead of a bunch of useless posts that get burried in a couple days tops.
---
My rant does nothing to cover up the piece of shit game they made. If they want to fix shit they will if not they wont. I think gamers have an overinflated ego of what their say in things really are these days. 
---
I do believe the game has some code to prevent you from getting stuck, I‚Äôve gotten stuck many times, and it‚Äôs always wiggled out, after a while I see the toon starting to slide to one side and then I‚Äôll be able to jump out and free myself
---
This weekend in the silo, I VATS-attacked a turret and ended up in the roof, and I could not move at all to jump back down as usual, I couldn‚Äôt fast-travel and grenades just went through and away from me, but after a few minutes it wiggled a little and was able to jump down 
---
Hol up how do you get Grognak's Axe?
---
Hey! Seriously liking the game, and I was *very* skeptical about it at first. 
---
Seems like you guys are really beginning to get into the swing of having everything in the state everyone wants it to be and getting things to their full potential. 
---
Greatly appreciate your work. 
---
It's rare, and I have a hodge podge of armor, but my chameleon leather leg with 20% weapon weight reduction will always be part of my suit.
---
I have another one with 20% weapon, and one with 20% food/chem weight reduction.
---
That should be enough fire power for some fun and foolery in a contested workshop 
---
Haha damn, looks fun! Might even be better to carry than the bloodied overrepaired Ripper I use, since as a heavy weapon user a minigun is like 2lbs. The ripper lasts a long time, but it loses its effectiveness long before it breaks enough for me to overrepair it again :-/
---
Question: is inviting someone to your team so you can FT for free a douche move or a wise one?
---
good bot
---
Fuck the roadmap, if we aren't somewhere now then I couldn't give a shit where we are 2 years down the line.
---
Thank god for him. Thank god FOR HIM.
---
I'd pay good money for a set of Weightless wood armor.
---
I absolutely love things like that. I also am fond of seeing a deathclaw with a bad leg, limping after me. 
---
Not anything. Nuka grape I think? Won‚Äôt. And teammates with rad sponge won‚Äôt. And Sun Kissed won‚Äôt.
---
Why the cry for separate servers?  One could have pvp flags or zones that would work just as well no?
---
Whatever you drop appears in a paper sack.
---
Yeah, I've seen both Mutated and Flash around the SAME TREE in the edges of the zone. Deeper in, it's all flash... (did anyone mention equipping the Green Thumb for double flux? Do that too... :) )
---
Wow, I did not know this and I played FO4
---
Two Times the Slow.

Do you have rads and an auto stimpack armor? The armor will try to heal you even with the rads taking up your health bar. He doesn't know any better, he's just a piece of armor
---
A limbless monstrosity is a happy monstrosity!
---
This is not what I meant, but it is now! That‚Äôs a perfect explanation of what is happening. Thanks. 
---
what are "prime" plans?
---
Thank you for taking note of them!
---
Yeah Grahm is the ultimate character. Once he helped me clear out the Cranberry Bog side. A pleasant surprise! [Album](https://imgur.com/a/x3aM08z)
---
&gt; i'm no lawyer but i disagree with your assertion that games need to add extra functions. Adding subtitles is one thing but instituting text chat is not required to enjoy or play the game.
---
It's not my assertion.  It's covered in the law, not explicitly, but it's pretty clear that communication must be accessible, that includes text chat.  Also, actual lawyers made that claim, I'm simply repeating it.
---
&gt;Pretty sure 99% of the complaints are from solo players proving this isn't a need.
---
Okay, well you're made up "pretty sure" statistic of 99% is not really relevant.  If people who are deaf cannot communicate because of a lack of text chat, it's a violation of the CVAA, and it's also just fucking wrong.
---
&gt;Additionally you cannot force all games with any type of MP to add text chat.
---
Yes, the FCC absolutely can.  WTF does that even mean?
---
&gt;Furthermore i'm confused that all of you aren't visiting and organizing on live streams
---
I legitimately have no idea what you're talking about... I'm a huge supporter of the Abel Gamers charity, so I'm not sure if you're referring to their annual charity streams?
---
Trade or get lucky on a drop
---
yes but he was talking about getting rid of it then getting a different one that place is good for getting that perfect starter mutation
---
The bug came back with the patch before the previous one. (the one where a lot of changes were reverted). A friend of mine loves the Tesla rifle, but never uses it because it almost always gives him the damage bug and he‚Äôll have to relog to clear it.
---
I‚Äôm not there yet, but I have a daily lap which takes 4 minutes and goes a little somethin like this...*hit it*
---
Head east to the silver ore, then hit 2 aluminum veins, then 1 iron ore. Pacify the alpha death claw, kill him, harvest his black titanium. Do a U-turn for home. Mine the uranium ore. Kill the glowing mole rat that has spawned by now. Collect his nuclear waste.
---
Stash it all and play a little piano.
---
A couple IRL hours later I do it all again.
---
It ate a sentinel assaultron head.  Gotta watch out for those little buggers
---
Flash, go back in time and tell your mother she did not raise you right.
---
I've tested that theory very heavily, and it simply don't hold water.
---
Some of the best drops I've got came from OHKs, and letting them heal has not resulted in any better rolls of the RNG slot machine in my experience.
---
I was just over 2700/7600 "Kill Legendary Enemies" achievement last time I checked.
---
Your best bet is just making a macro
---
I believe instead if they just stated a "ok we're going to rebuild this, and you're going to help," meaning turn the joke that this is still an early access game and we're just testers into reality, I believe everyone would 1) be on board, 2) actually get involved in the creation process instead of yelling about "another bug or broken feature." Let us free roam without the story and/or lore (or perhaps explore structures but not KNOW what's going on there), and experiment with the mechanics and gameplay. Perhaps have a weekly or even daily polls/surveys on user experience to help make the dream a reality. It worked for D&amp;D 5e, and look at how BIG that is, probably the biggest D&amp;D has ever been (albeit the whole "satan's game" thing in the 70s-80s).
---
I don't mind the atom shop, and I can see WHY it's there in our current "age" of gaming (although I too abhore it), but if a steady stream of revenue is what's craved, I seriously think most would have no issue paying a subscription for a true fallout multiplayer game.
---
I gotta say, I expect bugs here and there in a game, especially an online game. I've had some here and there, nothing game breaking. But it's kinda like, oh bugs, yeah. It'd be great if a game was 100% polished and no bugs at all, because it does suck, but what's the point in getting mad when it's a given when it comes to games/online games. 
---
Lol I don't have to brown nose. Their shit runs amazing on my rig.
---
You can't run the game, that doesn't make me a brown nosee.
---
Sucks for you.
---
I can kill one at a time solo in a hazmat, no big deal. But make that 2 and it takes 20 times longer, not worth it. Make it 3 and I'll just swap server.
---
Same here.
---
That one is not as hard those outside.
---
Or just PA with emergency protocols torso and with fireproof perk. I run a bloodied PA heavy weapons build and scorchbeast attacks tickle (along with most other things, emergency protocols is very effective. Yao guai still scare me)
---
This won‚Äôt be about the nuts and bolts of Fo76, but I would just like to toss something out there:
---
Jon (MATN) is consistently one of the most positive voices in the Fallout community, and I would like to encourage everyone within the community to take a page out of his book. 
---
I am like many of you here: I absolutely adore the Fallout franchise, I was very excited about the release of Fo76, and I was subsequently let down by the game (at least, as it was at release) for various reasons. I don‚Äôt know what happened behind the scenes for the game to turn out this way, but I do appreciate the fact that Bethesda is trying to do a bit of course correction here. The fact remains that if we want this game to improve, we not only need to provide feedback to the developers, but we also need to be respectful, responsible, and courteous. We all love Fallout here. We all want a game where we can immerse ourselves in the lore and gameplay. We all want that classic Fallout environment that has always been a breeding ground for wild, and often hilarious stories. And guess what? There are a ton of people at Bethesda who want that too. Let‚Äôs be supportive of them, in every way that we can. 
---
Maybe Fo76 will one day be the game we all hoped it would be, and maybe it will still fall short once the final update has been published. Who knows for sure? Maybe some of the ambitious ideas that Jon and others have put forward will be implemented in further games in the franchise. I certainly hope they‚Äôre given consideration. 
---
Let‚Äôs hope big, dream big, and work together to make the game what it can be. If not this time around, then definitely the next time.
---
I run pretty low with my rifles. 170Maxed before looting. 
---
Heaviest rifle is only 10.7 pounds. 
---
Excavator with the 350. 
---
If anything they should large amounts of extendo mags. 
---
My biggest problem is still and always having to reload with my rifles. 
---
I hope bethesda sees this, this is a great idea
---
what's fireproof? a perk?
---
because i like discovering new things mate :).
---
I can really only play when my son is napping so voice chat isn't really an option for me. It'd be great to have text chat so I can communicate without waking him. I'm on Xbox.
---
Yea I always thought the first time they heal is a good thing and you get the legendary drops. Then I saw all the posts here about it being a bug and I was  confused. 
---
Random trading is a tricky business, for sure. Mainly I coordinate trades/buys on r/fo76market and it has been very fruitful. When I do random trades, I'll message the player with basic offers while we browse each other's inventories. That has helped a lot.
---
So are you going to make it?
---
hey thanks yeh knew about mole rats and mutant suicider :)
---
You can usually tell by the upvotes. If the upvotes are positive, on this sub it's guaranteed he finished the title by saying he liked it, on /r/fallout it's guaranteed he didn't like it. 
---
the xp needed to level up between each level doesn't change after 50. For example 50 to 51 is the same as 140 to 141. Just do what you've been doing after u reached level 50.
---
Because there is a lot of us that really enjoy the game. 
---
Not to mention all the total irrational hate that gets thrown about this sub and r/fallout. Some blatant lies and total falsehoods that people who play the game know are bullshit. Remember the trading ‚Äúglitch‚Äù that multiple people a day posted about that turned out to be totally false? How about all the people that got ‚Äúinnocently‚Äù banned by Bethesda for no reason? 
---
We know a lot of what‚Äôs floating around about the game is hyperbole and lies. 
---
Was/are there issues? Yes.
---
Has those issues been totally blown out of proportion by people that just like to feel superior, weather they played the game or not? Absolutely. 
---
There is definitely a lot of content creators that have found a lot of success with mostly nothing but negativity. Cleanprincegaming and yong yea come to mind. But there‚Äôs tons of enthusiastic passionate gamers that make content about gaming, and you can tell they just love gaming. People are passionate about this shit, and they get fired up. I put about 70 hours into fallout 76 and I came to agree with a lot of the negative things they were saying.  Put I put in that 70 hours and had fun for that time despite anything I read or saw. Pull your head out of your ass and realize there‚Äôs some awesome people there that have really interesting shit to say about the games we love. 
---
Thank you so much for this. This pretty much answers my question
---
Inside the main building? Cause i was just there last night and didnt get much.
---
Had the same issue with Hemlock Holes. There's me, level 235, against a level 30, who keeps waiting until I leave and then attacking it. I'd already committed heavily to that server as I'd already taken 4 other workshops.I one shot him every time (hooray bloodied explosive harpoon gun), but because Hemlock loads you right out in the open, he got wise and sat on the spawn point, then unloaded directly into my head. Pretty frustrating watching my HP drop so fast when I'm in the best power armor possible and I literally can't move. Super stimpack saved me the first time he did that, but after 10 or so attempts, he finally got me. Ironically we basically came out even - he lost \~30 caps each time and died 11 times, I lost 235 on my one death. He left after that - I think he just wanted to recoup his losses lol.  
---
Although, IDK about that whole power armor going from 200% to red in one shot man. I had a hell of a firefight against a guy with an explosive combat shotgun - we're talking like 30 minutes of slugging each other with everything we have, and I didn't even lose half of my durability.
---
Just be careful. Reports are that mirv is hazardous to the user, I was launching them off the roof of my camp(which is on the edge of a cliff) with no obstructions nearby 
---
I can kill one really easy solo but I'm PA and the only thing that holds me back is their Sonic attack blinding me, 3 could keep me permanently blinded before so I'd be forced to run. 
---
Ksh ksh ksh ugh ugh ugh ugh ksh ksh ksh... And sprinting and sprinting and sprinting ...
---
yeah, It's under endurance.. 
---
As someone who is level 235 - you hurt a hell of a lot more than you think you do. Put on the Fireproof perk to reduce explosive damage and you will be on even footing with just about anyone.  Level 30s can kill me no problem.
---
Only when they brown bag it. New year, new me. 
---
What if you could get a scotchbeast stomach place it down at your camp, and cut it open as a appropriately leveled loot crate with worthwhile items
---
The first rule of Fallout 76 is everyone complains about Fallout 76.
---
And as for the trading forums, where do you find that?
---
I call BS on Bethesda. Fix it! Fix it now! 60 bucks and through all the BS we still play and you pull this crap. Get rid of this new chameleon bug too (time it right if you bend down and run and you stay invisible) fix it and fix it now!
---
Yes, I have Several Levers, don't remember if any are instigating, but I don't think any are explosive.
---
I get that but I have not found there to be much response from Beth at all regarding actual issues. Rather, just a new promotion of some stupid armor suit for 10usd.
---
I fear that the reddit person is simply paid a few bucks per hour, told nothing, and basically paid to take it on the chin without the option of passing along any relevant feedback. But maybe somebody with some say will actually listen and the next fallout or TES game won't be a total disaster leading to the implosion of Beth. 
---
never know...
---
Victory or Sovngarde!
---
I'm fine with that, as long as I can keep it off my screen entirely.
---
I don't even tolerate global chats in actual MMORPGs, the last thing I want is a box on my screen littered with people selling shit nobody wants and random insults.
---
I will have to message you later for mutations (not recipes) and T-60 parts. Will be on tonight around 630-700 (central)
---
Only by your pathetic crew. No one else cares because they know this is a rip off.
---
If you have a lot of enemies chasing after you, run behind another player and the enemies will lock on to him
---
What PAs can you do? I have multiple 
---
That is a terrible waste of both your time and money. I didn't buy the game until I was sure I was going to enjoy it and I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it until I tried the beta. I played the beta and enjoyed it so I bought it. If you were so unsure you should've looked more into the game before sinking both money and time into it.
---
If you contest a shop now, both the owner and you are instantly flagged for pvp and will do / take full damage, and you can battle all throughout the workshop now, not just that tiny circle.
---
This is pretty much what killed the social experience of Ark Survival Evolved.  In PVE, the persistent servers eventually became too overcrowded and resources spawns were overrun. In PVP, unrestricted guilds and alliances came to dominate clusters of persistent servers to the point that no one could do anything without their permission.  The game space was simply too small and the costs of non-cooperation too negligible to sustain.  
---
IMHO - if you're going to have persistent servers then you must also have perma-death, otherwise the game will ALWAYS devolve to "who can spend the most time in-game."  Even with perma-death it will still devolve to such, but the risk will always be there that you can lose everything.  This will make players act more rationally.
---
Can't wait for new content with same bugs!
---
All T series. 
---
Anyway of getting the mutations to work properly on PS4?
---
That being said, the chat set up is for roleplaying intent.
---
Your brother just happens to be deaf during the apocolypse.
---
Yeah chat is good in ESO. 
---
Just an idea but it may be for the legendary vendor coming in May , of course people don‚Äôt know how the system will work but stocking up on cheap legendaries might be a way to acquire bread in the future
---
That's why i (as a german) can't play a game or watch a movie synched/translated to german. The translations are so akward (at best, most of the time they're just hilarious).
---
Going 200 to red was simple, bobbleheads. Amount of damage done to you scales the durability loss of PA, which is why PA in pve hardly ever needs to be repaired. But bobblehead extreme overkill can seriously damage PA. That's been fixed already. 
---
for starting a new character i would assume
---
My favorite is crafting leather/metal armor and mods requiring no ballistic fiber, but repairing it does. It's more worthwhile to build new armor than repair it.
---
This isn‚Äôt an unusual build though, lots of people run it in PVE. My stealth sniper and my PA/HW/explosives guy both run 20% health builds. I‚Äôm all about damage :)
---
no prob. If im not on by then im usually on the xbox app so just msg me on xbox.
---
I believe you but, you still picked up a ton of shit. I believe you but my Bethesda don't. Prrrrrtat.
---
Entertaining and sad at the same time... :\[
---
&gt; Remember the trading ‚Äúglitch‚Äù that multiple people a day posted about that turned out to be totally false?
---
It wasn't though, it was a real glitch that was patched out that people just posted about still being in a few days after they fixed it.  There were several duping glitches and 2 of them I know involved trading, the most common dupe was the artillery glitch
---
&gt;How about all the people that got ‚Äúinnocently‚Äù banned by Bethesda for no reason?
---
Yeah I believe them more than Bethesda if we are looking the track record here, especially since they said they were banning people with 100k halloween candies and saying they are rare.  I'm not banned, but I can safely say that getting 100k halloween candy would not take a month or even a week.
---
&gt;We know a lot of what‚Äôs floating around about the game is hyperbole and lies.
---
The most popular post yesterday was like 2 and a half hours of someone saying all the things still wrong that need to be fixed or totally changed.  Beyond any of that even, the game has no appeal for the standard gamer.  It has no story, and that isn't debatable.  You are following someone else's story.  There is zero dialog in the game.  There are no actual NPCs, just terminals and robots with no character (outside of Rose, who may as well have been a holotape because she has no interactivity)
---
good point.
---
Oh I will! When I get my hands on one it's going to be glory to the power of atom 
---
Word , I‚Äôm down with fast traveling to vault 76 and your camp but not any other locations 
---
If you get Adrenal after the patch it works, except the new version is broken with Strange in Numbers. It either neutralizes it or makes it go negative (seems to neutralize it on my HW guy, my sniper does less than base weapon damage if I have SiN equipped...which is waaaay worse since I have bloodied weapon, nerd rage, 9 weapon perks...)
---
Wasn‚Äôt at the fire department was it?  I dropped some radaway for a guy there
---
I think this is why you're not completely banned just a soft ban.
---
Paid, you say?
---
So if their post sounds like a "professional shill", what does someone lying to smear a company get labled as?
---
Oh, yeah. A fucking liar.
---
Ok can i message you when i get home? 
---
I would def welcome this.
---
All jokes aside, I've been grinding for lead wrong the whole time. I would server hop gyms and silos and average 150 per locations if they weren't already picked. This past weekend I worked over lucky hole mine, went to camp, smelted the ore with super duper equiped and ended up with 1110 lead for about 15 minutes worth of work.
---
Listening to this at work and theres honestly so many good points being made. I'm finding myself hoping for a more intense survival based game going forward, I like the game as is but some of the ideas can help it reach its massive potential. 
---
I am running 5 characters.  Have a 189, a 43, a 13, a 6 and a 4 so those low level legendaries help me get the others up to speed quicker to use the high level legendaries I have reserved for them. 
---
Oh.  Well in that case everyone else must be imagining it.
---
We're talking about the most petty thing you've done in FO76, but if you post the most prettiest thing you saw as well, that'd be A-Okay with me.
---
Wait what did you say?
---
\&gt; Seems Scrochbeasts exist just to consume bullets at a net loss for the players. 
---
:=O
---
Mind is blown.
---
So they're here to make us consume. If it weren't for SB's we'd all be swimming in brown bags full of ammo thrown away.
---
ahhhh thats what u meant..test there..i never knew about that..is  that outside of the mine?
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox as well.  Won‚Äôt be on til tomorrow but if you do I have some caps.  What are you willing to sell for or trade?  
---
Ah so he was an exploiter / duper stacking like 100 explosive bobbleheads. That makes more sense. Doesn't make sense to complain about it now that it's fixed though.
---
&gt; That is a terrible waste of both your time and money
---
I have bought every Fallout game on release, this is the first regrettable purchase.  We played to the point where we realized there was no redeeming qualities, and we wanted to make sure we gave it a fair shot to try and get our $60 worth of play out of it.
---
&gt;If you were so unsure you should've looked more into the game before sinking both money and time into it.
---
No one at all would have bought the game if you just went off reviews, literally zero people
---
I play this game pretty frequently, at least 4 hours a day when I get off work, and I have not encountered the insta healing bug since January. However, the other three bugs are still very obviously in game.
---
Playing a sniper, I find that Protectrons have very weak legs, and you can do far more damage aiming for those then you can going for their giant noggins.
---
What shout do you get when you kill neltharion?
---
This. I give 30 Bulked Lead to 2 Players recently and still have 400 to spare + 1500 rounds for my 3 regular Weapons. That was after 30 minute deep scavenge of Lucky Hole Mine is excavator. It's 100% the best way to farm Lead
---
Thanks. But to be honest if feels like getting a "soft" stick in the rectum.
---
Yep. I'm at work now myself. 
---
Are any of your limbs crippled?
---
i call it the deja vu glitch
---
Was this after the latest patch and is it for the armor or just the helmet?
---
Makes sense thanks for your input!
---
Thanks for the offer but im PC and level 110 i can handle things myself. This does give me the idea of killing the Level 20 Grafton Monster in Charleston when i am trying to get the Vendor Bot Responder to spawn.
---
Shes dead AND YOU KNEW THAT ALREADY!
---
It was one of my first tastes of PvP. And I was ranting hard hahaha sorry. PA still feels like paper in PvP 
---
Does anyone else feel that the upcoming preorder will be a second straight mistake by Bethesda??? Are they going the way of Ubisoft and Assassin's creed, pumping out many low qualities vs. Few high qualities? I would mention new dawn but I haven't played or heard anything about it.
---
I'm for and against this. I would love to be able to ask someone over chat if they want to group up for a quest/ event. But at the same time, I don't want to see spam of people selling items or selling stuff for real world money.
---
The "destroy literally everything" shout.
---
I‚Äôm lucky I have one, they‚Äôre so awesome.  Can‚Äôt wait til you get one they‚Äôre so fun! 
---
Lol easy big guy. 
---
I meant helping you by giving you the antiseptic I don‚Äôt use or having the monster respawn.
---
Good luck happy hunting 
---
And you were mining with the excavator PA right? Cause you extract more ore.
---
Why? Salt's delicious.
---
I started stockpiling crap 3* legendaries a few days ago, better be worth it, hope for the best, expect the worse.
---
That sounds like a shout I want to use! 
---
What hat/helmet is that? 
---
They've stated there will be private servers eventually, so people can make mods. From the looks of the road map though, it won't be this year.
---
I picked 1 one up but ended up selling it.
---
I approve this message.
---
 I will not run a Bloodied build. I have no wish to run around near death just so my guns work better.  ;)
---
 I don't like most of the popular builds and have recently posted my balanced approach ... here:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aun4up/lets_hear_your_unconventional_builds/
---
Mods for weapons.  Like prime receiver (rifle).  They require ultracite. 
---
Thank you for the explanation. It‚Äôs an important distinction and I over looked those facts. I was originally thinking sunk cost but it looks like the proper term would have been Technical Debt, which someone below pointed out. 
---
Is that the one near Grafton Steel? I have never been able to dig it up.
---
Ouch, where were you ?
---
Scorched overall are a bland disappointment. Which is weird, because they did a great job with the other, new creatures like the Grafton monster, Snallygaster and Wendigo.
---
They should have just used normal humans, and had varying degrees of Scorchedness. Ranging from mostly human looking with some burning here and there to twisted beyond recognition with ultracite crystal armor. Make them more like regular ghouls (with armor and weapons befitting their location) rather than the same four feral bacon ghouls with identical animations regardless of weapons. 
---
When I enter the building after spawning in the inside yard, I always forget to pick up that clipboard, which is lying on the pulpit near the door... So I'm actually very satisfied with this feature of instant teleportation! I will never miss a single clipboard again!
---
I've actually never met him. Though I rarely traverse roads.
---
Everything - centermass...ish.
---
xoxo,
---
Bloodied explosive .50 cal
---
I did this first time. Creep in to the part of the Cave where the SB is and look for the debris/stairs(?) to the right side of the Cave. You can take cover under the debris. I managed to kill the SB without taking much damage cause the SB is grounded and can't get close enough to you to kill you. Just throw lots of grenades and shoot it in its stupid face
---
Mostly I just hit them with my hammer. 
---
This would be an amazing faction to open up honestly, this game needs more Mothman!....I desire warfare between mothed ghouls and scorched!
---
Last time I checked achievements I was only around 40 of 7600 on giant creatures, and SBs, yet the "Kill Legendary Enemies" is over 2700.
---
Something is definitely off with the counter, I killed the Grafton Monster by the Charleston Train yard about 40 times in one day while trying to get the random vendor to spawn.
---
üòÅ Re-Read your post your talking about Snallygasters not the Grafton Monster. And the Charleston GM doesn't have Snallygasters with him.
---
Yeah, add the "legendary (enemy) had mutated" message from 4 back, along with the orange glow, and then give them a random mutation. Like your sniping ghouls, safe from a rooftop, and boom, all of a sudden that glowing ghoul has marsupial.
---
Sounds good. I will give you guys a line when I am ready to roll. Kinda busy time in the real world right now. Might have time tomorrow night or this weekend to play.
---
Cheers!
---
If you see a clown playing tuba in the sewer, it's best to walk away.
---
It was probably a month ago, and for the armor
---
No *but*, bravos are worthless wastes of time/ammo/durability. This does not appear likely to change.
---
It seems as though the area it's most likely to spawn is in the southern parts of The Mire. You'll know it when you see it. 
---
Between 9 perception used for all three cards of rifleman/commando, 3 for tank killer, and 3 for ground pounder, there is literally no room for anything else. The rest of the weight reduction perks are all grouped with their weapon types, right? 
---
No. It was the BBQ joint.
---
Having an additional assest trying to access loot tables, en masse? Yeah. You guys don't seem to understand what causes 76's server issues...
---
Bethesda needs to learn how to divide loot tables better before that will be doable.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's a great idea, and most MMORPGs have optional items that do exactly this.
---
That's more or less right, yeah. Which can make it a very mixed blessing to travel with a party member who is of much higher level than you are! 
---
Thtat's supposed to happen on legendary enemies.
---
Yes, they do.
---
Ok thank you. 
---
I have been crafting, then modding, and scrapping for a while now and only got the helmet. 
---
And so far no luck finding them with that or other places mentioned. 
---
West Tek Center in the middle of the map is for me more enjoyable, tons off super mutants (mostly a legendary in there) with the keycard to the "secret" area a nice place to farm exp. thats my place to go because many dont go there because: they shoot back XD gouhls not \^\^
---
that's nice and all, but it's something that I know doesn't take long (I've used the tools for Fallout 4 myself) to adjust really and there just simply isn't an excuse at this point for it
---
so, again, I'll believe it when I see it but "In a future patch!" means nothing to me anymore
---
Let‚Äôs do it. 
---
No player icons 
---
No adamantium Skeleton 
---
Limbs can only be repaired by targeting the individual limb with a Stimpak. 
---
Hard cap on inventory. 100 base only, with 100 increase with a backpack and 50 increase with power Armor. 
---
Dmg extremely increased and make it the same for each player. So no has an advantage, the only advantage would be positioning/skill. 
---
Last but not least. 
---
Disease should be crippling and become a priority once you have obtained one. 
---
I can walk around for hours with diseases, not really realistic. 
---
Yep
---
After killing the 20th boss in a row with no loot I stop playing and haven't picked it up since
---
First, the trading glitch I‚Äôm taking about is that someone could take any and everything from your character from the trade screen. The one that had multiple posts per day for a couple weeks and had no proof posted with it. 
---
Second, you really think all these people are ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù ? Every time the banhammer comes down on any game you have floods of people claiming that they were totally ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù and were banned for no apparent reason (hint: they weren‚Äôt). Sure, someone could have 100,000 prices of candy... but why would they? That‚Äôs literally the only thing you could get legitimately without making the game a 100% grind for the thing they wanted. 
---
Third, the fact that you say that there isn‚Äôt any story proves you‚Äôve either never played the game or your a total troll. Spoiler: there is a story. While you might not have liked the story, you claiming there isn‚Äôt one and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not up for debate‚Äù proves my point. So many falsehoods that are easily disproved yet accepted by the masses because of people like you who spread the lies to feel like there opinion is superior.
---
Forth, for someone who apparently hates the game it‚Äôs odd to see you lurking in that games main sub. Maybe you should spend your time somewhere that you don‚Äôt hate? Maybe your just hear to troll and feel superior? 
---
I can't say I'm surprised at how RDR Online turned out given how GTA Online has been the past few years. Needless to say, I haven't bought Red Dead 2 nor will I even if it does come out on PC.
---
A group of Super Mutants helped me immobilize it.
---
Get real dude. Every video game has bugs sir. Get off your high horse.
---
I know shooting suiciders carrying one will cause it to go off, but it's seeming that it's already primed at that point.  Can you just shoot a mini nuke sitting on a shelf and it detonates a nuke?
---
Praise thy Mothman
---
I get what you're asking for, and I stated that I thought it was a good idea.  However, I think that most people on this thread have been killed WAAAYYY more than once by some jerk that has nothing better to do than harass other people.  I can say from experience; rarely is it the case that someone kills you once and then leaves you alone, in fact it happened to me and some brand new players I was giving water just last night.  So, to come into a thread for people who are having similar issues and tell everyone what YOU'RE tired of isn't going to be recieved well.  Maybe, try using some tact instead.  The folks in this thread feel wronged by people against whom they have no recourse, I cant take on a level 300 that wants to farm me for caps and make me miserable until he gets bored.  I'm not going to want to listen to someone who comes in and tells me he's tired of seeing our complaint, I'm gonna tell him to kick rocks.  While your suggestions are good ones, your approach makes it fall on deaf ears. 
---
Oh lord. Know your junk! One can trap is 9 lead. There is lead all over and its the one thing I never run out of. Now steel is a pain. ;)
---
I'm not discouraged at all. I've been playing since day one and have really enjoyed it. I've only really dealt with one other troll the whole time I've been playing. 
---
I would probably be a high level player by now if it weren't for the fact that I work full time and have a 2-year old and 9-month old that I'm a parent of. I only really play on the weekends after my kids go to bed and me and my wife have our alone time. 
---
Yes if you want to come with you can
---
Jesus... so glad I posted this. Thanks for sharing 
---
Haven't we all?
---
Well, it‚Äôs one of the best games of all time, so that‚Äôs a dumb decision. 
---
yep and the most bad thing about that is that bugthesda dont realy know how to make a HOTFIX -,- it cant be so hard to work on the small bugs and fix them faster... no we have to wait again weeks befor MAYBE they solve the problem √í.√ì 
---
What's happening is a high level player wandered through there before you.  This is one reoccurring problem with FO76 that I'm not sure can be fixed.  Try server hopping.
---
In general though, I'll keep an eye on the player dots on the map.  If my quest is taking me to an area with grossly higher or lower players already there, I'll server hopping or skip that for now.  You either screw lower players (like in your scenario) or every enemy is a bullet sponge.
---
I always leg protectrons. 
---
You could just fart directly into the wine glass next time.
---
Pretty sure the Radscorpion weakness is actually the face unless that isn't carried over from Fallout 4, it's only able to be shot via VATS,  because if you try to shoot it in normal aiming, the hitbox seems to intersect the torso hitbox so it's physically impossible without VATS magic bullets.  Same applies to Mirelurk hunters, since they have a face too assuming they're ripped straight from Fallout 4.
---
Also, the same applies to Handy, and Gutsy combat inhibitors.  Unlike Fallout 3, and New Vegas, the Combat  Inhibitor is *inside* their torso, a bit above the thruster region, which means it's impossible to also hit in standard shooting.  The only way to hit it is with VATS, and it had abnormally low percentages at almost every angle, like 4-14%.
---
Also, I know I sound like a broken record mentioning Fallout 4, but in Far Harbor, the Gulpers weakness was actually their head, not their belly.  Might be worth clarifying if it has changed, or if it's still their head.
---
I get it. However, they also heal before they hit 50% or lower as well sometimes. Especially annoying when it happens to the SBQ when she's above 50%. But I totally get what you're saying and you're not wrong.
---
See I never have any issues with steel because I scrap every weapon I pick up. I always head to scorched and super mutant locations just to collect their weapons. 
---
Upvote this folks !!
---
But most of them are still in release versions because they chose to ship them. Not because they were not aware of them or couldnt fix them. This is an active decision and not something that just is.
---
Honestly, even if every single one of them dropped 1 star legendary items...I still would NOT fight them.  Even considering the upcoming 'buy back legendaries' mechanic that's coming soon.  Nope.  Not worth it.  Even after the sonic attack 'nerf'.  
---
Scorchbeasts are the new standard of measure in the "not worth the fight for the rewards" in gaming.  
---
If they reliably dropped 2/3 star equipment, that would get me to bite.  Why would I want to go through an entire SB fight for a 1 star that I could get off one-shotting literately any other legendary critter in the game?
---
Pass...
---
That's unfortunate, I hear people have tracked his walking path so if you want to see what you're missing...
---
Personally, I've purposefully kept myself unaware of his travel path, because it makes the random encounters that much more exciting for me, but I'm sure it shouldn't be too hard to find posts where people talk about his whereabouts.
---
Whatever you decide, I hope you get to meet him some time soon! He's such a great character :)
---
This happened to me just last night (so not last patch).  If I were to shoot at a slightly slower rate it would basically remain static health.  Drop down a bit, go back up a bit, etc.
---
They should make Mothman faction a thing and make it so that a Mothman sometimes appears to help you when you're in combat.
---
A way to think of this is that the software isn't a telephone pole, it's more like a tree.
---
There's a main trunk of the tree, and each "release" is one of the bigger branches.
---
The way that code development works is that there are several "branches" alive at the same time, in parallel
---
The individual devs also have the code that's on their dev workstation. The dev can decide to bring this branch, that branch, or even directly the main trunk to their computer to work from (though that's often considered bad form). 
---
So imagine that in this tree, the bug was fixed on a dev's branch off of Release branch 5.
---
But Branch 6 had already begun, before Branch 5 was released, and before that fix on Branch 5 had been made.
---
Release 5 goes out, and everybody is happy.
---
Now that change needs to get back to the main tree, and also back out to every single other un-released branch that has already budded off the trunk of the tree. Otherwise, it's going to be missing.
---
There are many ways that this could have gone missing, and avoiding that is one of the important jobs for people who set up the processes for source code control and branch management strategy.
---
Maybe whoever was putting the changes back to the main trunk made a mistake.
---
Maybe whoever was bringing those changes to Branch 6 made a mistake.
---
Maybe some dev on Branch 6 made some changes in that same area based on the pre-fix code, and then made a mistake.
---
Because these human mistakes happen, you need testing to verify that nothing was lost.
---
And that missed, as well.
---
Hmmm. Time to put that vibrating hand through Nora again. Only this time, 15 years earlier.
---
Yup.
---
Big atom trying to keep you from accumulating without buying!
---
Server jumping whitesprings is still the fastest way to level up, sadly. Plus way more legendary drops than anywhere else. 
---
West Tek is second. 
---
750c Each so 1500 total
---
They nerfed whitespring ghoul xp but as far as I can tell it's probably still the fastest.
---
I got a bunch of stuff. One 3* vanguard with weapon weight reduction maybe I think. One other vanguard. I think one star. Other stuff good and bad
---
Shoot, I forgot that spawns can be a bit random! Sorry about that. 
---
Enemies scale to the first player in their proximity when they spawn.
---
It's the one legit complaint I have with the design of the game.
---
Todd should play WoW, for like a week.
---
You shouldn't have to server hop or relog to do a progression quest because of a lazily implemented scaling system.
---
But this is all due to the game's entire lack of sharding, so it's likely not a simple fix unless sharding is added.
---
(I don't see that happening though, with a paltry 24 players per server.)
---
somewhere on the roof, i believe
---
I will keep selling the Good stuff to other players for now.
---
I have 1 character that is very near the max limit with nothing but legendary Weapons, and another that is maxed with legendary Armor.
---
I would be sweet if we could remove the legendary modifiers &amp; apply them to other weapons, if that happens My Gunsmith skills and stock will become very valuable.
---
What game, has open world and big as Fallout, have you ever played that had zero bugs? I'll answer for you, none. No game has come out bug free.
---
Church of the Perpetual Lamp
---
So why don't they give even as paltry of rewards as those legendary creatures that get one shot? It's not about making them something you want to farm but making them less than complete garbage you know? This change would be a slight one that would make it slightly worth it to some people, and less of a complete garbage nuisance. The intrinsic reward of "I beat a scorchbeast!" Really... Just isn't 
---
Can't you just use harpoons? Those are recoverable right?
---
Sounds like most other apex predators. 
---
If not in combat, +100% V.A.T.S accuracy at +50% AP cost
---
Lack of evidence isn't evidence. 
---
It was like that in others, 76 may be different however most players first response to a mininuke isn't bullets  
---
I don't know about you guys, but my Recon Armor Piercing .308 does wonders. 1 shot, 1 kill.
---
Yeah, same boat there. I try to avoid looking up the more mysterious things, including his path. The day I do find him though, it'll be great. :D
---
Just yesterday I found the Mothman for the first time though, hunted for like two hours in the woods around the museum city. Learned the hard way that even if he's hostile and sees you? If you shoot him, he still teleports away. Didn't get to fight it. Also doesn't help that I don't have any PS4 friends who play it, so no one to help with finding neat things like Grahm or Mothman.
---
Man, any little thing I can pass on to help ease the grind makes my day.
---
right, I'm permanently overencumbered though, so no sprinting for me lol
---
Actually what you are experiencing is a commie vortex designed to confuse and disorientate their enemies.
---
You and your friend are sent to parallel dimensions that cross over a third dimension where the interactions from the other show up in your dimension.
---
The effect is meant to confuse and demoralize the enemy.  Stay strong and do not fall for this commie trick.
---
You may have to activate your teleportation device in your issues Pip-boy a few times to break free from this commie vortex.
---
Keep fighting those commies soldier!
---
Go to the whitesprings laundromat. Pick up the industrial abraxo cleaners. Theres at least five. Should be good for a little while
---
Pretty sure Severe is better than hardened, and armor piercing is a legendary trait, not a mod.
---
turn on your mic when eating 
---
&gt;the best games of all time
---
Does "one of the best games of all time" (that's a great buzzword to slang around) earn that qualification by having a *notoriously* bad online that even *you* have just complained about?
---
Sue me, I'm honestly unimpressed by Cowboy GTA and I won't reward shitty business practices from Rockstar
---
What? You say you disconnected from the server? Lol
---
Aren't they still the best weapon in the game?
---
*Please assume the position.*
---
Does look awesome üëç
---
I keep forgetting to go there. I need to arrange a "visit".
---
Well, the point being made wasn't that they were there to consume bullets, but the "at a net loss for the players".
---
Most everything else in the game, the amount of bullets you expend is offset by the rewards for the kill.  The value of the items received is more than the value of the bullets spent.  Maybe not in lead/steal/gunpowder itself but in other items.  I walk away from a Scorchbeast kill at level 50 having spent a few hundred 5.56 rounds and I get a liver, or heart, or brain.  Maybe a Stimpak if I'm lucky.
---
That level 68 scorched conqueror dropped 3 weapons to scrap for mods/steel, and a couple dozen ammo for each of them.  Plus random healing/food items.  Only two two hits from the same weapon.  The level 60+ Supermutant dropped 10 caps, a bunch of ammo and weapons, more Stimpaks, and only took 5 shots to kill.
---
That Scorched and Super Mutant, plus every other enemy around them in the two areas consumed less ammo than that single ScorchedBeast, and yielded much more exp.
---
I have never scrapped anything by accident, but, I pay attention and seldom get in a big hurry to do anything.
---
I did suffer the Mods being scrapped for materials while crafting bug, and that ate a pair of Calibrated Shocks Mods.
---
This is one of the most holier-than-thou post I've seen in a while. Like, this guy thinks he's hot shit, doesn't he.
---
Some people just wanna see the world burn.
---
throw multiplayer in there and things just multiply too
---
It‚Äôs glitched has been for a few months

Enjoy your read.

Not allowing switching would been solution when game was release. It is not solution when I have put hundreds of hours into developing character and farming all this gear. I have done all the quest, I have seen most of the places, I am not interested doing it again, even if it is on harder difficulty. 
---
Yea I did not know that. Saw a PSA later about it.
---
 I do too but I make most of my ammo, and that's where it gets used up.
---
That's good to know, we have had one level 300 kill 4-5 of us over and over again, it gets super old, quick.  I get that this is supposed to be the wasteland, but it IS a video game.  I deal with enough crap at work, I don't want to be frustrated by some dude with no life that gets his jollies by ruining other people's fun while I'm trying to unwind.  I'm not a high level, I work long hours and have limited time to play, so I would like to see something done.  Thank you for the info though, it is appreciated. 
---
Thank you for your reply.
---
I'm not saying players shouldn't play how they want to, even if that means continuously attacking an unwilling player, I'm just trying to understand the mentality behind it if you do like to play that way.
---
Talk is cheap. Promises from Bethesda mean nothing until it arrives in game, working. I wouldn‚Äôt trust the roadmap as far as I could throw it if it was written on a paper airplane.
---
Charleston 
---
Okay?
---
White Springs? Hell no.     At your level, if you are serious about XP, you should clear out  West Tek research solo. Shit tons of XP.
---
I meant piercing and perforating, and of severe is higher damage than hardened, that makes it different than every other firearm, unless I am gravely mistaken. Severe is just higher crit damage. Which could be more dmg, but hardened is more every shot. Which makes it built dependent. 
---
In order to learn the plan from scrapping the weapon or armor must be at 100% condition or higher. To learn the plan from picking it up for the first time your intelligence must be higher. Both are only chances. Not guarantees, and your intelligence score impacts the likelihood. 
---
If that's how you want to view it, go a head.
---
The ones I've ran into were looking for ammo or trying to unload their extra gear. One dude after B.S.ing for a bit asked if I had any good melee weapons. I said no and he dropped a 3 star Vampiric Combat Knife and said have fun...it is gangsta. So you might as well say Hi, It could really work out for you.
---
Don't forget to loot the bos body as it's got some combat armour on it.
---
We need a sad trombone.
---
It was released on Friday
---
If you want to run a second one on a team I will run through it with you. If you crash out you can join back to team I'll be online in twenty minutes or so.
---
&gt; Second, you really think all these people are ‚Äúinnocent
---
Not all, but at least some of them
---
&gt; Sure, someone could have 100,000 prices of candy... but why would they? 
---
Because it is the only weightless food in the game that doesn't spoil and is free
---
&gt;Third, the fact that you say that there isn‚Äôt any story proves you‚Äôve either never played the game or your a total troll. 
---
I completed all the main "story" quests
---
I‚Äôm talking about up north - by hemlock. 
---
&gt;As soon as my power comes back on
---
Care to elaborate ?
---
And if I understood correctly, do you live in the USA ?
---
Below are the perk card levels to go with the build. Doesn't look like you can reach full benefit until L47:
---
L2	Action Boy/Girl
---
L20	Sneak
---
L27	Covert Operative
---
L30	Starched Genes
---
L33	Grim Reaper's Sprint
---
L35	Escape Artist
---
L42	Bloody Mess
---
L44	Critical Savvy
---
L47	Better Criticals
---
That wasn't that great an insult ryan, at the risk of making the same mistake your parents made and expecting too much of you, I believe you can do better.
---
No worries, there are plenty of fixed Mole Miner spawns I can farm!
---
Yeah, western revolver is weird. The wiki, at least, shows severe as +18 damage and hardened as +12: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Western_revolver_(Fallout_76)
---
In most bethesda games, enemies evolve with you. Animals have variants and radioactive, skeletons got armors, etc. It's weird that this dosen't happen with scorched
---
There are still totally viable and usable legendary items that aren't max level.  I'm at level 265 and I still use a level 40 bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet.  Being a high level doesn't mean that you've managed to grab the best drops that the game has to offer.  In fact, I was running around with a level 20 bloodied combat shotgun this morning simply because I don't happen to have a shotgun in my inventory that outclasses it and I don't always want to run and gun with a handmade.
---
Welp. Looks like you were full of it. Lol. 
---
Are you hitting the walk button by mistake? (the button that stops you from sprinting and makes you walk slowly like you are crouched) I think the default is caps lock so I hit it by mistake occasionally when hitting a or tab.
---
Power armor does feel like paper, I agree. You're probably far better off with a full assassin set of marine armor. Although with the nerfs, I think fighting against people with TSE weapons is much more reasonable. You pretty much HAVE to use the fireproof perk, but with that it's not so bad. A level 200 vs level 200 fight is a serious slug match right now - stimpacks can keep up, but damn I probably burned through 50 fighting a dude over the munition factory. Two-Shot Explosive combat shotgun vs. bloody explosive harpoon gun. Only reason I won was due to getting to 20% hp and letting bloodied / nerd rage kick in and getting a head shot at point blank.
---
The most fun you'll ever have with a minigun for about 3 minutes.
---
Sometimes I jump and land between pipes and can't jump anymore to get out and have to fast travel die or server hop
---
Just tested and Concentrated Fire is not enabled. When I turn it on, it will consistently increase damage in VATS. However, I am noticing this happen randomly with it disabled.
---
Troubleshoot your shit, edgelord.
---
I want to know how many people are currently still playing this game
---
Is this true? I wasn‚Äôt aware and this gives me hope
---
I would love a hardcore mode like this. For some reason I doubt survival will be that unforgiving
---
Okay good to know. Thanks for the info
---
what no rolling pin? 
---
yes
---
I second this question
---
Yeah I'm aware of that button and no. 
---
That will make me even slower. Plus that wouldn't stop me from crouching. Guess I'm kind of wondering if this is a glitch people know of since I randomly am able to run with nothing being changed. 
---
We had a really strong wind storm come through our area yesterday. Power has been out for 28 hours so far and we still don‚Äôt have a time for restoration yet. Yes, I‚Äôm in the US.
---
And it‚Äôs fucking cold lol. 
---
My caps tell a different story
---
I Spent 80 dollars on a broken game played the broken game, now I can‚Äôt even play this game because I am apparently banned. I have no email stating why from Bethesda. I guess I‚Äôll just charge back. 
---
Yeah I just posted about this the other day. Nothing could get it to work.
---
Talons 
---
I actually enjoy hunting them down but i would enjoy them 10x more if i got rewarded from it
---
Will do.
---
The tough part is remembering which meat pile is the SBQ.   On my last trip through a member of the group sat still on the spot and we waited about 10 minutes for everything to load. 
---
I believe most with dmg like that are running bloody builds. I may be off the mark, but I have only seen that type of damage with the bloody glass cannon type of build. If others know of other ways, I would love to know also
---
Nuka-vulin, BruichRADdich, Mut Isla, Radphroig, I think there's potential. 
---
I can see the benefits of both having and not having fast travel except to camp and vault 76. It would be incredibly immersive and a lot of fun. I would for sure build a new character for that type of playthrough. But at the very least they must not have player icons on the map, or an opt out system combined with wanted players being visible and not seeing others
---
Nope. We're all DPS, ping ponging aggro based on damage threat.
---
Dude I swear I was playing on that server, I finally got a 1 * legend tire iron. Me and like 5 higher level guys in excavator armor. 
---
Are you on PC? And are you willing to pay the caps the vendor asks for? If so I‚Äôll be on the lookout. I found a vendor yesterday that had two. 
---
They made level 50 leather armor take fiber now :(
---
What does that do?
---
Good to know, thanks
---
never heard of it before. when this sort of thing happens its been people hitting caps lock without realizing it.
---
With the randomly running thing, is it you hitting the button or you just randomly running? I would say it is your keyboard, but you said you checked your keyboard.
---
It‚Äôs plus 25% unarmed damage. You should also get bloody mess which is 15% more dmg maxes out 
---
It needs to be changes so pets always respawn and have a dismiss option. 
---
NP
---
The price the vendor asks is malleable. With hard bargain 3 and charisma drugs it can be a lot less. But I think I have 9k now. I am on pc. 
---
I dunno if its server performance but I find that they don't heal until they get close to 1-5% health.
---
Actually, Halloween candy does have weight. 
---
Thanks for proving my point. 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Halloween_candy
---
Green Thumb mentions are highly mentioned! I will grind on...
---
idk, my vampires pole hook with 40% faster swing speed and +1 strength is pretty nice...
---
That was long, but that was good. 
---
One point of paying more attention to the lore would have kept me more interested in the game. I ran across several holo tapes and letters that seemed like they were going to lead me down a good story line and not only did they just end, but they never even really start. It's been a while but I remember hearing a tape where a guy was suspicious of what was going on at the place he was working for. A couple of thugs come in to take him away because of this. And I found out nothing about what happened to the guy, what was going on at the place, did anyone miss him, etc. 
---
Another was the raider turned pastor. I found a few notes where he started his deception. A location where people were catching on to him and he poisoned everyone, and then nothing else. No closure. Did he create another congregation? Did someone see through his BS and take him out before he could take them out? He just vanishes from the area / planet. I could have spent a ton of time just following the trail of clues. Now there are a few lines like this. But there are so many more that just gives a snapshot of: something happened. But no way of finding out who was involved, what happened, why it happened, and what the ending was.   
---
I really have no clue how that perk works. Some people say that they crouch and go to "caution",even in front of enemies. It's not as easy for me.
---
I also use chameleon. Could it be chameleon breaks the perk?
---
I have a, bloodied deathclaw and it goes to 360 dmg, and i haven't placed the extra claw mod on it yet.. 
---
...I'm carrying 300 stimpacks, 15 diluted, 30 super.
---
200 radaways, 100 diluted.
---
Like 100 radx, 100 diluted.
---
1 buffout, nothing else.
---
I'm a medic, don't say I didn't come prepared o:
---
Yep, bloodied, mutations and right perks its very easy... my bloodied supersledge is monster killer
---
Are you on ps4? I‚Äôll take that off your hands for like 2k
---
Nope xbox
---
Bethesda, like most devs, are sick of being forced to implement achievements.
---
This is why 76 doesn't have any on PC.
---
They're only there on console because of manufacturer requirements.
---
The worm is turning.
---
It looks like he's wearing the Brotherhood of Steel [Medical Goggles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Medical_goggles_(Fallout_4)) from Fallout 4. Didn't know they were in the game.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, so let me rephrase that to hard bargain 3 + grape mentats pricing. 
---
You have absolutely no way to prove this.  It‚Äôs likely not true.
---
They may be heading in the right direction. These are power armor designs that were data mined after the last patch: https://m.imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy
---
Up north by Morgantown Airport is a great place.  There's a field just west of Mama Dolce's that will centrally locate you within easy walking distance of a bunch of good resources with Lvl 5-8 max bad guys  and 2 events spawn there all the time.
---
There‚Äôs people on this board that are desperate to convince people that all the bugs are generally fixed. 
---
Using sound logic I can‚Äôt figure out why people are arguing against their own self interests. 
---
It'd make that Weapon Scrapper perk somewhat useful too
---
Anything else? 
---
Lmao go play WoW. Get 1v40d.
---
Punished Duper
---
A hero denied by his community
---
Were you wearing PA? Because that makes my game freeze alot especially in nuke zones. Its hard to do without ik.  I wish bethesda or microsoft could give a decent answer why the game freezes suddenly, i barely get disconnected, it just freezes. 
---
Got it. I'll take two pair. (3000 total) I'll be on at 5pm. Gamertag: vCurtisv
---
Ditto.  Regular as clockwork...UNLESS I wait about 10-15 seconds.  Then it works smoothly.  Must be a loading issue.
---
Damn who shit on ur cereal this morning?
---
Good job 
---
Is every legendary supposed to have a legendary item?  I have never been clear on why people assume this.
---
Lol you right. I am grumpy af.. Sorry OP. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say all. I said often. IRL, I have taken the Amtrak regionally and waiting for the passenger train have had a couple of freight trains pass through the station. Near where I live, the commuter, passenger and freight train rails all group up in certain areas. I see lots of freight trains pass through. In Columbia, SC, where I used to live, the Amtrak passenger train only passes through twice a day (one time being 2:30 am). But I can tell you that freight trains pass through all day long. You can not only hear their horns throughout the day, but you get stuck in traffic in various places around town because of all of the roads the tracks cross. Plus there are factories and such with lots of materials for transport. In the US, more money is in freight transportation, not passenger transportation. It's  actually not unrealistic. 
---

---
Pretty happy with it tbh, some interior things have changed but not too much and the entrance now has a permanent campfire that allows me to play a foundation down when I enter the building to make it absolutely impenetrable
---
I can‚Äôt beliebe bethesda botched how good/legendary weapons drop and how bad the endgame is. 
---
There‚Äôs ONE end game boss and it‚Äôs not even worth the caps to fast travel to fight it. Sad stuff man. 
---
TSEs aren't a big deal at all. The PvP balance in this game is just non-existent. Nobody past 50 should be able to kill another player past 50 in one shot unless that player isn't wearing any armor or any armor perks. No player should become practically unkillable in the right legendary armor either. There are ways to counter this but they shouldn't exist in the first place. I guess my PvP experiences in WoW and dark souls have me spoiled? 
---
People have said Whitesprings and West Tek, but I like Watoga for free and easy XP. Plenty of challenging 'dungeon' areas too. These make up the 3 Ws that people run for legendaries, too. I leveled three times just running for leggies
---
I have one auto stim, and one born survivor.  One would proc, then if I got knocked down in the time window, the second would proc.  Not sure which occurred first honestly.
---
After reaching level 76 with my first character, I got tired of the fact that I was kind of locked into a certain weapon type based on my perks, so I'd find cool guns that I just couldn't use, and had fat stacks of ammo that I'd never be able to use.
---
So with my second character, I'm [attempting a build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4e41f3&amp;d=c72sf2sg2s01ss2se2a72aa2am2a12a42eo2ej4ed3ep0ew0p53la2i10sb0&amp;w=&amp;n=) that doesn't use any weapon specializations (other than some general melee stuff), so I'm free to use any weapon I find, and utilize all types of ammo. Instead the build is focused on non-PA damage reduction and survivability.
---
For all I know, the build could be trash, but so far at level 17 it's working out.
---
all good bro. we cool.
---
I am using a two-handed melee AND automatic rifles, with PA 'build'. Because they are what I found funnest when I started. In hind-sight probably both are a bit weaker than if I had focused on one or the other, but, fun. I just finished moving points at lvl 112 to make it low health/no PA/mutations build to take advantage of some bloodied weapons and a decent full set of Unyielding I have slowly collected.
---
SBQ is worth fighting, the regular scorchbeast are not worth it.
---
True, though (1) it doesn‚Äôt help that there‚Äôs no indication of it being an intended effect in-game ala spell animation; and (2) most instances are bugged regen :(
---
Been annoying and very common since launch.   There's also a much more fatal variant where enemies are only visible to you or your friend, usually after a team fast travel or crossing one of the game's invisible boundary areas (cells?).   This combined with the various patch shenanigans makes me feel like Beaker to Bethesda's Dr. Honeydew.
---
Bethesda themselves said it was paid content.  It's what they did with a bit of the money they made from the Atom Shop.
---
If you were PS4 I‚Äôd make it up to ya. Good luck sir! 
---
Do you often ride passenger trains in the US?
---
Yeah I agree, might be anecdotal but I've one shot a legendary mole miner during uranium fever and got a 3* super sledge, whereas other times I've let the health regen and have got a 1* wood armor off a 3* enemy.
---
I attempted something like this and it was burned to the ground. I hope you have better luck than I.
---
Oh cool, Awesome stuff!
---
*crawls back under a rock*
---
Damn if only we had crossplay.
---
I ride a train to work every day.
---
I thought that achievement was broken. Mine still says 2/72 after 100+ hours in the game and countless legendary enemies killed. 
---
PS5 maybe! 
---
I got  key card if you want to run a silo. Got a headset?
---
That's asking for a lot
---
Hope you're right. :)
---
The damage seen in those pictures are mainly based on the bloodied mechanic. Perks like nerd rage and serums like adrenal reaction play a major role. Furthermore, other perks like bloody mess, specific unarmed weapon damage perks and strength related perks add to physical/ballistic damage numbers. 
---
Which MMO's have a companion like that? Skyrim?
---
I bought the game and played it for 50+ levels. I follow it very sparsely to see if it improves and maybe eventually I'll come back to it. I don't take any satisfaction from that. I saw the latest roadmap and think possibly I'll come back when they open the vault. Why that's such a difficult concept for you to understand? 
---
Medical Goggles
---
I thought that they changed that about a month ago.
---
O h n o
---
You are correct.
---
You didn't do enough damage to get loot would be my guess, you need to do a certain amount of damage to receive loot in my testing it wasnt just a case of no legendary no loot spawned for you at all that ionized meat was group loot.
---
The loot bug with the spinning wheel usually means the server is lagging or you are, try not streaming and you should see this issue disappear.
---
If you want text chat just go to a live stream. How else can you organize 25p.
---
Don't build a turret camp at the back of Whitespirng golf course.
---
absolutely hate this bug - the workaround (that doesn't always work) that my friend and I use is to always try to fast travel separately, which has its own downsides (one getting stuck unable to fast travel from enemies arriving from nowhere, the other getting caught in a crossfire at destination). Almost always happens at Glassed Caverns, which is the worst place to get left stuck outside waiting for the first player to load in before the second can enter.
---
Or Breathing Like Darth Vader ... OH, lord some people hahaha.  (Sarcasm) I love it when I have to hear the back ground conversations of someones mom asking if they pissed on the toilet seat and why they did not clean it up. Come on people .. Find a mute button .. You don't have to leave your Mic on the whole time.
---
I think some people forget honestly .. but Oh boy the things I am hearing 
---
Agreed, I need to find a better spot thats closer to Watoga yet out of the way enough to not have to worry about enemy spawns
---
Thanks for commenting but i'm just looking for people who's ready to take on the queen but needs someone to help. I'll let u know tho if I decide to launch one myself later.
---
Maybe even let them level up as well.
---
This is all in one region though so it should be more like how SEPTA works than AMTRAK. You don't take AMTRAK to go to a place you could drive in 30 minutes. Now you could assume they mixed the 2 in the FO world, but still for there to be no passenger trains for the WHOLE line, is unusual. It's not like All of the Amtrak rails are empty for a freight car to go through, just a section of it. Based on people with luggage waiting at the station, they were clearly waiting for something.
---
I need them goggles. i actually just found the BOS Scientist Scribe outfit over this past weekend and really like it but couldn't figure out a good hat to go with.  
---
If you run through Big Bend Tunnel and pickup everything (ie. weapons, junk, etc) you can scrap it all at the end and you usually end up with 150-200 steel. Just remember to bring something like your Excavator PA so you fast travel back to your camp.
---
Did you try Pike, Otis?
---
Yep, this. You can find them in the Antique Shop (probably in other places but idk) on the shelves right at the entrance, it doesn't spawn all the time, sometimes nothing, sometimes BoS hood's and some others as well. 
---
I like this Idea... the only issue though is it limits the rewards to Enclave. I like the idea of some type of redeemable point system based on scorch-beast level that you could turn-in to a faction rewards NPC and get some reward. If there were only NPCs in the game... then you could do that
---
Ever wonder if maybe they aren‚Äôt supposed to be worth hunting and killing?  Not every tough enemy is a loot pi√±ata.  They‚Äôre just assholes who are not worth the ammo.
---
I‚Äôve lost two legendaries outside West-Tek this way. I hear the battle cry of ‚Äúrun awaaaay‚Äù and the subtitle shows it‚Äôs from a legendary, so I go looking but they‚Äôre never there. I assume they ran for the hills. 
---
This is a great idea!!
---
I've been told that the "make a friend" one actually refers to befriending a pet through the Animal Friend perk (and possibly a certain questline involving a deathclaw).  That said, it didn't clear for me anyway.   I also have the bobblehead use one perpetually glitched because it doesn't recognize the Endurance bobblehead use, and a monsters one that doesn't recognize yao guai kills of any type.
---
weight 0.01, with any weight perk it turns it to zero dipshit
---
Ok, well I hope it gets better for you guys anytime soon.
---
If it‚Äôs a diseased enemy, the ‚Äúdiseased‚Äù text overrides the ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù text. You can have legendary enemies that way without knowing it. 
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool, it‚Äôs heavy endurance lol
---
Hermit Crab - not the truck part
---
I can‚Äôt argue with you‚Äôre logic
---
I'll get a pic of where I exactly got stuck
---
Pm me and we can try to find a time
---
Most of the time you can unequip and re-equip a armor piece to fix
---
That bloody build is what I call a conventional unconventional haha
---
Okay, cool, just checking because I've seen a few threads where people were complaining about the legendaries healing, not realizing it was intended behavior. 
---
 I quit fast traveling. I will when I play with others but that's very rare.  
---
 I carry my X0-1 in my pocket and it has one Calibrated leg and hauls about 275. I do go out and like to use that route but its the first thing I run out of. If I am diligent and grab all the cooking pots and other steel crap as I do stuff I can almost keep up.
---
Stats and perk cards? Seems really interesting 
---
This is great - but I bet your experience would have been 100% better with text (Team or Area) chat... just guessing.
---
Blows my mind people are still putting up with this game
---
I like soups since they quench both. Corn, glowing fungus, and brain fungus are all pretty easy to keep in stock. Foods that add strength or carry weight are nice to have too.
---
I have a feeling you were the reason why I couldn‚Äôt join that one server 2 days ago...
---
There is a good video out there explaining how to do this, but basically it's all about CAMP placement.
---
You can move it around after claiming a spot to alter your spawn in and ft locations. 
---
I moved it on a cliff camp where I was spawning off the edge to get a better spot.
---
It takes a little trial and error but can help stop spawning in foundations and other issues.
---
Someone posted a friggin pyramid they made to honor mothman
---
That happens 100% of the time for me.  Kill or craft something.  As soon as you earn a single XP point the meter will Re-render and display properly.
---
I‚Äôm all about the cultist dagger.  I just wish there were more mods for it. 
---
I love a good fast knife. 
---
Btw getting the last hit on the queen doesn't work two maned her and neither of us got the check mark for it.
---
Cranberry cobblers
---
&gt; *lying to smear a company*  
---
What lie? They announced the content as paid.
---
Related: Anyone else mildly annoyed by how the locomotives couldn't *actually* work, because they have no couplers to connect to cars behind them to be able to pull them?
---
I was wondering if the xp was gone, I was loosing my mind, or it was a rendering glitch
---
It really is. I wanted to get max HP up, and get those damage reducing perks. Interestingly, early Endurance perk cards are pretty trash, so at level 17, I still have 1 Endurance. Mostly Charisma, Strength, and Agility early on.
---
Dude, for my team it was a glowing ant and a ghoul. We kited the ant to the ghoul to get it off of us, and it was able to kill the heretofore immortal ghoul, but remained immortal itself. We just had to leave Fort Defiance before it killed us all. It was tenacious. 
---
I agree no game has come out bug free, I think the issue is the following:
---
* How quick are the developers to resolve identified bugs (How responsive are they)?
---
* How game breaking were the bugs (which ties into #1)?
---
* How easily identifiable the bugs were (how thorough were they in testing)?
---
So yes, every game has bugs when it's released, but there were bugs they didn't resolve that were known about back in Fallout 4 (Lever action rifle reloading) or that took more than a single patch to fix (such as no legendary rifle drops - which took a while to fix). 
---
So while "technically" true that every game has bugs of one sort or another, it's the same as saying someone who speeds is the same as a murderer because they both broke laws.   
---
Rockit .. Thanks fo rthi sone .. really grinds my gears 
---
I have completed the bobblehead challenge. And they said that they fixed the Yao guai challenge in a previous patch. After they fixed it I was able to complete that.
---
How does playing the game stealthily work?
---
So what‚Äôs your user name?
---
Just kidding. 
---
There should be an option to search by box number 
---
Imagine if a vertibot pulled up above you and 5 PA scorched dropped out of the sky!
---
I think they would fall out instead of dropping.
---
I have been getting a lot random invites lately .. I wonder if that's what these are for .. "Light Bulb moment" .. Hmm I might have to start accepting these.. but on the other hand what door am I opening by doing so .. Uggh 
---
I only get an error message about how the data is  damaged. I is an in-story error message that the terminal is giving me, not my xbox.
---
What about Mole Miners? Do we punch them right on their breathing mask?
---
Not what you said though. You said it was weightless, it‚Äôs not weightless.
---
Also name calling because you got shutdown. Classic troll. 
---
Oh I can see how you misread that, or how I wasn‚Äôt specific enough. 
---
I don‚Äôt have it now, but I see it very often, like once a day usually. If I find it again do you want me to grab it?
---
No it's when I try to run, sometimes it works. And my keyboard is working for everything else fine. 
---
If they fix it so that anyone that gets some hits in as I have mentioned in this post then that would fix the problem. But for now bugged is bugged 
---
I have a ghoul slaying combat knife, I can clear the white springs club house very quickly. Often killing all but the charred in one hit. Even the glowing ones from nukes take 3-4 hits at most. Very fun. I make it a point to run around there once a day when it‚Äôs empty. Definitely faster than my bloodied super sledge.
---
That's a bit telling that it was almost the exact same scenario.  I hope that means Bethesda will have an easier time replicating and fixing the bug.  It's hard enough to keep a supply of ammo without walking, immortal bullet sponges in the wild.
---
I bought a corsair mic on black friday for cheap. Flip the mike down its on, flip it up its off. That's how I remedied that.
---
Done it! And forgot to loot for the Armor üò≠
---
The outfit ( or something very similar) does exist if NV honest hearts DC is canon.
---
You find some in a cave that belonged to a guy who lived through the apocalypse.
---
I got the same one. It has enormous ear cups. Very comfortable. 
---
Does a "Weakness to Dees nuts" joke apply to Super Mutants?
---
Yes I‚Äôm agreeing with you haha, I was just clarifying for OP that that‚Äôs the plan he wants 
---
I've seen scorched wit miniguns in SBQ fights, but I agree that there should be scorched BoS soldiers in PA. 
---
Ribeye Steak.  Grilled Radstag.  Wood + Brahamin or Radstag.  Plus 20 carry weight.
---
I always keep at least one on me.
---
Yes! Sorry I didn‚Äôt get the alert for this. It‚Äôs already made, just lmk whenever you‚Äôre ready to pick it up :) 
---
If I was this upset about a game and how poorly I thought the company was managing it, I just would'nt play it and I would move on to something that made me happier.
---
&gt; Not what you said though. You said it was weightless, it‚Äôs not weightless.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Also name calling because you got shutdown. Classic troll.
---
I feel like you aren't even a real person if that is your logic lol.  It is effectively the only weightless food, no other food is zero weight with thru-hiker.  It is also super easy to amass tons of
---
These comments always seem strange to me, because I wear power armor 24/7 running a pretty [garden-variety heavy weapons build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f373e86&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22ic4ip2ih2id2s72ls2lt2a04pe2cu2sg2eh2e12e60&amp;w=e00es2c52ik0e82at1lm2iq2&amp;n=Hevy%20Waponz) and there is literally *nothing* that scares me anymore. The only thing I think about now is "How expensive is it to kill this thing?" Mirelurk Queens are a hard pass, but it's open season on everything else.
---
Ribeye and rad stag are great for carry weight. Dilberts oil and tarberry for running. Deathclaw steak for +2 strength. 
---
But PA prevents you from getting airborne and water diseases. Soooo this wouldn‚Äôt meet up with how the world is setup. 
---
Plus, the fusion cores wouldn‚Äôt last long enough for them to wait years for us to get there. 
---
Try to increase your strength as high as possible since melee damage scales of strength stat. Like others have said first increase your base damage through modifiers. Then factor in stuff that scale off how bloodied builds work. And finally, increase your damage through food/chems/alchohol. Before anything max your strength to 15, this is mandatory.
---
1. First get iron fist rank 3, bloodied mess rank 3, talons mutation.
---
2. Get your health low through radiation. Now work on low health perks. Start with getting the radicool perk in endurance tree, and nerd rage. Next get yourself an unyielding set since that is the best and only set of armor that increases damage for melee damage (increases all stats (not endurance) when low hp). You can get up to 15 strength!! Bloodied got nerfed? or broken since the scaling doesen't work right now unless you are below 60%, and you really don't see the results until you are very low like under 15%. For starters also, find yourself a bloodied weapon.
---
3. Finally increase your damage if you are really needing it through food, alcohol, chems. Alcohol is everywhere and they increase your strength stat. I personally use the party boy perk in charisma to triple the effect since certain alcohol can increase your str by 9. Cheap and accessible food is from glowing meat. Cook that shit and its 10% unarmed damage which lasts awhile. Glowing meat is everywhere. Finally psychobuff for scorched queens or whatever.
---
I might have missed a few things, but hope this helps.
---
I don't think you have even remotely a clue about what you're talking about...
---
The miming was cool enough, we got there. I can't imagine making it out alive if I had to stop and type every 5 metres :) 
---
I should have mic'd up but I'm a shy guy generally, and my boy was sleeping so didn't want to be too loud. 
---
I hope they add different legendary traits on weapons overtime. I want the Junkie trait to add a random drug stat to your weapon with variable % on the effect.
---
Stabby stab.
---
Same. I have an Anti-Armor + Faster Swing speed Combat Knife and nothing I've found so far beats it. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see some two-bit journo report on this.
---
No, wait, I can.
---
&gt;Should people that Bought the game on day One/preordered, then seen that same game slashed in half then even lower afterwards
---
That happens with every game.
---
That's probably mostly people with marsupial just trying to jump around, and someone is standing too close.
---
I like this Post ... Make sure you're locking up Resources/Water purifiers if you don't want to share. Took me 75 lvls before a realized I could do this.   segue too 
---
I try to leave a few crafting stations, stash boxes outside and an unlocked water purifier for them travelers who have taken on more then they can carry or just need a drink .. Man I can't tell you how happy it makes someone when they are over encumbered and dying of thirst to walk up on a base that is set up like this to help out a fellow traveler.
---
Creating a small building by your base with a lvl 0 lock with nothing in it but a toilet ... wait for trespasser to pick lock only to find a toilet in it and now they are wanted?  
---
I don‚Äôt wear PA except in nuke zones.  My regular armor is pretty good and I have explosive weapons but gulpers are still a pain in the ASS
---
YES PLEASE.
---
Lmfao at the flow of this. Showing your cheeky side with that toilet game üòÇ
---
He was a desert ranger yes, but I seriously doubt that they‚Äôd retcon their marine combat armor for prewar riot gear 
---
This happened to my friend.  He should be able to search by PO Box but cannot.  He has gone back thru every step, but the system is telling him to go to that computer in the post office.
---
He is stuck.  He has decided to ignore it.  We tried helping him, but nothing we try can push him thru the quest.
---
1. This game was developed by Bethesda Austin, a much smaller team who never worked on the creation engine.
---
2. This game was made in 3 years, very little time for bug fixing
---
Bethesda Maryland (the ones who made all the good ones) are working on Starfield and TES VI. It‚Äôs ok, you don‚Äôt have to worry.
---
Yeah I didn't clear for me either and I've tamed a few pets. No friends for me I guess :(
---
 I'm not sure there is a faster way, outside of one shotting stuff. ;)
---
**If by serious you mean** people thanking for *paid content* (where the previous content is still unfinished) or saying that the game  "saved my disabled friends life", they usually come from accounts suspiciously created around/after Fo76 launch and probably are from PR companies (which is called professional shilling).
---
For instance, this account was created at the apex of December 4th patch debacle.
---
If you have interest in knowing more about shilling:
---
&gt; [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uIrnEIuL8o&amp;t) where the guy actually calls to a PR company that offer "shill services" and also interview a Reddit moderator about the theme.  
---
&gt;It's pretty widespread, now and then there's an AMA of professional shills [like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/7ja6de/ive_been_a_corporate_shill_on_reddit_and_on_other/).  
---
&gt;[Here's a massive thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/) of journalistic articles (from NY Times and such) about shilling. 
---
Don't judge Super Mutants when they die in various positions.
---
&gt;Does "one of the best games of all time" (that's a great buzzword to slang around) earn that qualification by having a notoriously bad online that even you have just complained about? I'm definitely not about to go buy a console just to play this game
---
No, it earned that qualification by having one of the most well developed open-world multiplayer environments ever created, coupled with what is hands down one of the best single-player experiences of all time. 
---
Yes I complained about it. I also have absolutely zero problem dying on the hill that it is without a doubt one of the best video games of all time and in my opinion *unarguably* the most impressive.
---
You literally haven't even played it and you're talking shit. It's ridiculous lmao. 
---
&gt;Back to the original post - Rockstar is an entirely unrelated entity? - Bethesda will have to prove they can actually do stuff rather than saying "it's coming it's coming", because that's all the past 100+ days have been. Don't get your hopes up or you're likely going to be disappointed. It's happened to this game's community over and over and over since the release.
---
Rockstar is a major studio with a major Online release that has significant bugs and lack of content. 
---
I'm comparing them to Bethesda, which is also major studio with a major Online release that has significant bugs and a lack of content.
---
 Bethesda has had more updates, more communication with players, and more improvements to QoL issues than Red Dead by a massive factor.
---
Do you see how these things are similar now? 
---
Seems to me like the last few updates to this game have done a great job of proving that Bethesda can actually do stuff. 
---
I've suggested modified Bear Arms perk to include rifles.
---
Way easier than adding new cards.
---
That tracks with my experience I think. Oh Bethesda.
---
You also see "steal" from government drones you shoot down. 
---
I have a 3\* combat knife, +40% swing speed is one of the modifiers. It is a BEAST against ghoul mobs and the like.
---
Yeah, the system isn't clear at all, it's stupid how they have it. 
---
So true, there's also a lot of misinformation on here about Uranium Fever being level capped, and I looted my Primary Rifle, level 45 TSE Handmade came from UF. also got a really nice 3* Combat Armor Chest from there a few days ago, but I have noticed while doing the event with low level players I do tend to get low level rolls.
---
Not anymore :(
---
 I often end up stabbing the ground as it kills so quick.
---
Could we benefit from some sort of icon or notification that the server is having problems prior to the "controls disabled" point? 
---
Something akin would be like in the Battlefield franchise of games, you can get little floating icons when your connection to the server is poor or there are other server-side issues. That way we could keep playing.
---
Alternatively, reduce the threshold for disabling controls. It would be frustrating, but it would likely reduce this and the WS shuffle, which is my unfunny way of describing loading into, say, the WS bunker and walking forward, then having it snap you back to the entrance after a few seconds.
---
The easy answer as a player of course is to say "fix the servers" but I'd be willing to settle for a stopgap until that becomes a possibility. Just brainstorming, bracing for the downvotes...
---
This community is the best, thanks for all the upvotes and all the bells and whistles. Made my day. 
---
In the words of one of my favourite Fallout characters, Three Dog from Fallout 3...
---
Keep fighting the good fight!
---
Well personally I couldn't care one way or the other.  My gf and I have been attacked one time in over 100hrs. Of game play and neither of our bases have ever been attacked.  Ps4 though .. So maybe ppl are nicer tha   other platforms 
---
Meh I don't care for it. I'm pretty low level 40 ish  and all weekend everytime I claimed a work shop some 200+ would come in and contest it and get 1 hit. Its usually a big great wasre of my time. 
---
I wish my battery lasted a little longer, other than that no complaints
---
You‚Äôre pretty much going to have to wait; the closest thing we have now is hunter/hunted. It‚Äôs the same server as everyone else, though - five people tune into the radio station to initiate it and you all each have somebody that you hunt and which hunt you. 
---

---
The frustrating reality is he probably didn't hear you..90% of the time, I run on "team" so I don't hear "area" at all. Which was a very stupid design decision. 
---
Toothpaste also has antiseptic.
---
As long as you don't try to put the foundation on something it won't work with, like rock, it's always worked for me.  I did it that way for the first 10 or so times before I started rebuilding to the spot I'm at. 
---
I know, I know. I just automatically equip Wrecking Ball and go to town when I see a turret CAMP back there, it's a huge peeve of mine. There's no talking sense into these scumbags!
---
Nah. I'm good with what I have. I respect the right of others to feel differently and understand if they do.
---
Should people that bought fallout , fallout 2 and fallout tactics 20 years ago get free atoms because Bethesda gifted them to everyone for free?
---
I view them as an interesting way to farm Ammo and aid chems, but that's about it.  They aren't worth doing on a regular farm basis. 
---
no right as soon as you walk in to your right is the decon chamber
---
You're killing the earth &gt;&lt;
---
lol, No.
---
A week later?  Not really saying the OP has a point but honestly, it was shitty that the game was slashed to being so cheap so quickly after release.
---
I want to say yes, but if I see it tonight when I play, it will be hard to resist getting it and then you would be stuck. I wish you could send messages on pc! You can add me as a friend in game, name is my reddit name. 
---
I Do Carrots as i've yet to have the mobs atk it at my camp and they too are Food/drink quencher. Sidenote:  I've since had the mobs run into my home an atk me or go straight after my walls even if they have range weapons when killed and looted? Since the last patch.
---
Haha, awesome! 
---
I thought about abandoning a "regular" build and just doing tents on carpet, but when you fast travel there you land on the ground and have to go around to get up there and got tired of that. 
---
I can't because I'm too low level... Meanwhile he goes and destroys everything I own like a 10 yr old because I want a fair play experience 
---
Better tighten up that xp!  
---
Why not get the team that you had ready to kill the queen on that server invite you back?
---
Actually, I got the HyperX cloud stinger headset which has a boom mic that flips up. I bought the corded version. 
---
Which is exactly what I've done, lol
---
I haven't opened 76 in at least two weeks now
---
 I have a Vampire one. I'll over repair it, but it won't come up to the Combat Knife I don't think. It would be nice, as it looks so fine. ;)
---
You should be able to hear area, you just can‚Äôt talk unless you swap your mic off team.  
---
Good luck with that.
---
What about.... SCORCHBEAST SOULS!? Maybe I'm the Scorchborn and don't even know it...
---
A game was put on sale for black friday? That's unheard of! STOP THE PRESSES!
---
Are you on PS4? I'll fix your camp. 
---
Hey man. Take it from me personally. You're not allowed to talk about how you had a bad time in the game here or all the Keyboard Cowboys and Bethesda dick riders come and tell you about your just a baby and "deal with it."
---
I thought explosive laser weapons don't work properly?
---
It seems to be for some, and not others, just like some of the other achievements are broken for me, but not others, I have compared with team mates recently, and we were all baffled.
---
Damn right! I don‚Äôt even bother shooting bullets tbh, it‚Äôs way more fun this way and can actually kill stuff 
---
Get a ps4 controller
---
Looks like it's too late xD post is already at 0. IDGAF. 
---
Stop complaining and use your mouth.. Just kidding, I would like this addition as well please.
---
I'd rather be a fru fru pink pony then a Rob zombie nerd. 
---
It's Monday anyways new stuff in the shop tomorrow. Hope it's something super pink. 
---
Excuse me but what is uranium fewer?
---
Nah I'm on PC :P It's ok though it was just a wood mansion. Will take me like 2 hours of woodfarming but it's cool. 
---
Returning customer! Got any new mutation recipes? I bought speed demon and marsupial from you a while ago.
---
Happens often, especially in the Digital PC realm.  Getting deals of 25-35% off the week after release on big titles from authorized resellers like Green Man Gaming.
---
Mine is Wireless but simply have to plug the very long usb cable which came with it to charge into it when it's low. Not really that inconvenient. Sometimes I just forget it's plugged in and try to walk to the kitchen and it almost gets yanked off my head.
---
it's nice you still want to compare them, but again, what Rockstar does is unrelated to Bethesda and what they do in their game.
---
Like I said about GTA Online, I'm not going to support shitty business practices. I knew before RDRO came out it would be what it was (as evidenced by GTA online's sales models). However, there is no real precedent from Bethesda about the dumpster fire that has been 76.
---
I look forward to seeing your eventual complaints about F76's development status and crushing dismay when Bethesda still barely chugs out anything at all.
---
Ahhh I would've liked to rack up a nice bounty on his camp 
---
NOW SELLING CAPS HALF OFF at catchthecommieboardgame.lel 
---
I just bought it for $40 last week. But now that I've played it, I would honestly have given full price.
---
This is a pretty ridiculous proposition. 
---
It's spreading all around 
---
Lmao it's actually an event that spawns in the mine east of whitesprings
---
I paid ¬£600 for a TV when that particular TV was brand new.  Now I can buy the same TV for ¬£300 or less. Should Panasonic give me free TV channels or some other free things because I paid for something when it was new? Prices drop as time goes by, that's just the way it works
---
We're on ps4 and right now are being harassed, maybe you've been lucky. 
---
Whatever Kool-aid they drank, I must have missed out. 
---
It is! Pretty nice coincidence! I put the camp station as high as I could on the tower while still be able to reach the ground with a ladder. Would need to find a way to get all up to the top, without to have to walk over the logs and the rail.  If we can find a solution to place at least one foundation and build from there.
---
Didn't have one.
---
I'd be willing to save up commendations for X-01 Calibrated Shocks since the plan doesn't exist. IMO, this is a great idea, OP.  
---
Now that dupers are on the run, this could be viable, from my perspective as a player and livestreamer. It's something that would be different each time, making viewership more interesting and unique. When I go into a missile silo to start a nuke/SBQ event I get a lot of my viewers saying "didn't you do this already?" and as much as I enjoy doing it, I would love to offer my few viewers some different worthwhile content. That's not to say I don't do events and explore the map for fun stuff but the SB fights are usually the most popular. It would be cool to up the stakes!
---
Stimpack just fyi.
---
yeah a few can't name them of the top of my head tho
---
I'm working on a build in the cliff behind the Monorail Elevator. So far so good. Just started last night though, so we'll see about spawn points.
---
I want to see a Camouflage SBQ...
---
after patch 5 not really b4 they were in vendors after a few reloggs
---
The npcs that used the power armor could have been contaminated before entering the armor or while they weren't in it.
---
You don't need a fusion core to use power armor you just need one to use it effectively and walk at a normal speed. Hence why they would be called brutes.
---
Store your junk if you are wanted or own a workshop.  Otherwise I will find you and your things will be mine.
---
Lol salty duper
---
It should be backspace.
---
Whatever suits your playstyle.
---
Better question is.. do you want to go solo? Team? Melee? Unarmed? Sneaky sniper? Heavy Gunner?
---
And you have that Option and respect your option... I would prefer something darker.  Whats Rob Zombie nerd even mean ? was just using it as an Example.. can't tell if you're being funny or trying to give me grief... 
---
Same name in game as here, as well. Fire off a PM if you get it and I won‚Äôt nab it. 
---
But worst case scenario, if I get it and you already found one, I still haven‚Äôt learned it. I‚Äôve been kinda debating whether the price was worth it. So if I end up with one you don‚Äôt want then I don‚Äôt have to try to convince myself one way or the other anymore lol
---
Level 14 checking in, I'll do an AMA at some point. Whats up fam?
---
There's a few ways griefers can take advantage by you accepting a team invite. From simply seeing where your camp is, and being able to fast travel there, drop team, and attack it, to dropping from the world, leaving you in ownership of a workshop they claimed, then rejoining and joining their friends team, one of them contests your workshop, now their whole team had PvP enabling against you.
---
I have been approached by a number of higher level people lately where they wave / act friendly and offered trade. They spend 30 seconds looking at what I have, back out of trade then attack me. I assume this is to:
---
1. See if have some junk they want
---
2. Know I am not carrying any decent ranged weapons / only have melee All Rise so back off and two shot me.
---
This is especially prevelant if I have a workshop (I guess I should be more wary at workshops but I'm friendly by nature).
---
Its a little frustrating but not the end of the world so I block them and move on. I don't block them because they killed me per say , more because it feels they were dishonest in being friendly then killing me less than a min later. 
---
Not commuter trains. Of course those come frequently. Maybe that's the confusion. In small towns, regional passenger trains only come, typically, once or twice a day. There are no commuter trains. When I've ridden Amtrak and had to switch lines, you just go to a tiny train station and you wait and can see several freight trains while you wait an hour or more for your passenger train. Idk. I lived in a freight train heavy town, always mapping my trips around town to the schedules if possible, throughout the day. Passenger trains only twice a day and the don't stop for very long -- like 10-15 min for boarding, then it's gone. I just don't see how it's implausible to see a lot of freight cars and fewer passenger cars (there are some though).
---
I saw a post saying they are currently not showing up in Vendor inventories due to an unknown bug. Guess I'll have to get lucky and find the plans on a treasure hunt or random world spawn :/
---
A Random Event at Blackwater Mine.
---
You have to protect &amp; repair Uranium Extractors from waves of Mole Miners that include a legendary in each of the 3 waves. it's very lucrative for gathering Steel, usually get around 400 per event.

---
I just want a 5\* Rolling pin

Well... You and a buddy go to the golf club at whitesprings. Kill app the ghouls, should be at least 2-3 legendaries there. Then one of you stand back outside the clubhouse behind the bus while the other re logs. When someone new joins the server(your friend), all the ghouls in the clubhouse respawn. Rinse, repeat. 
---
Now... I've had much better legendary drops from organically killed legendaries. I usually get a bunch of junk farming whitesprings. Could just be annecdotal though.
---
I run herbivore mutation and live off of soup, but i still cook and sell everything for the xp and caps.
---
And just because you dont care doesn't mean other people should feel the same as you.  Don't come in and tell others what you're tired of if you've never had the problem they're having.  
---
Or maybe you unlucky ;) that sucks though for you. Sorry to hear . Anyways here's hoping they make a sticky so the community can xome up with some realistic solutiona, that maybe appease mostly everyone 
---
I will play mostly solo. Rest is opened, but I would prefer not to be closed to one type of weapon. I do not really mind to be a character who uses everything. I don't want to spend hundred of hours to get "perfect build", I really want to have fun 
---
I find melee quite fun and very powerful, and love never having to deal with ammo. However you will need to either use power armor, or have a good non power armor build because you‚Äôll probably be getting hit a lot. 
---
It can be hard for scorchbeasts (the big flying green devil bats), I usually keep a gun on hand even when running melee to deal with them specifically. 
---
Same boat, level 14 here. I want to find somewhere:
---
\- with crafting stations because I cant build my own yet.
---
\-with a decent amount of other player activity like Flatwoods.
---
ooohhh i want the cranberry relish recipe..do u know where this is?
---
Yes 
---
When I am low on mats I find owned workshops and kill the owner, 1 out of 5 have copious amounts of junk.
---
I have studio quality  studio monitor speakers and subwoofer that I game on, and I have acoustic treatment in the room (the other hobby I mentioned in the post is dance music production, so I'm all decked out with audio stuff). It feels like a bit of a waste to just not use all of that. Plus I travel for work and I already have to take one pair of headphones with me for noise cancelling on planes, so I'd really rather not carry a second pair just in the off chance I maybe have the time to game.  
---
This is a great solution for some others, just maybe not for me, so thank you for your suggestion!
---
What's the shortcut for P2T on the PS4 controller? Didn't know there was one lol
---
I'll try this when I get back on. Thanks!
---
Your redemption code for them is on the way inside a canvas bag.
---
It's kinda frustrating how small the CAMP footprint is. I thought it'd go to the ground from the top but it doesn't. I fell a few times. :p
---
That's a really good idea. I like how the bf servers show when it's got high ping. It would be a good implementation to this game.
---
medical goggles..i found one in the game..but its pretty hard to get..i wanted another for my alt..so i was able to find one on the market subs for 300
---
It's actually East of the train station, but that's where I've been since ~ lvl 18 (45 now) and I don't really plan to move anytime soon. Closer to the road is a junk node too, and you're close to a lookout tower that produces ~30 caps/day, enough to cover my fast travel needs for my session. 
---
Is playing melee really fun? I mean when I'm playing with axe it doesn't look fun, but I like to shoot. Maybe I would go in "mixed" character who uses both, melee and weapon? 
---
Spent a LOT of caps traveling around trying to find and kill only to see they weren't recognized. I'd be happy if Beth at least gave me the 30 Atoms for my troubles.
---
You can move your camp for just the cost of camps.  It rebuilds automatically.
---
Mate, just stop. You hate the game yet there are many others who enjoy it. I enjoy it, and I really don‚Äôt care what you think
---
Yeah this kept happening to me in Beta. Kinda killed the whole "teaming up" part. 
---
How did he find your base?
---
Im sad no one else got this reference
---
I always go for the legs first with my shotgun and the enforcer perk. Then atleast I don‚Äôt have to worry about getting chased down and can shoot them with a sniper rifle from far away
---
No kidding. We ran out of time &amp; she still had 2/3 health on first revive.
---
Some spawns seem to have a capped/set level.  The raider PA that spawns in the keyed room at the south of the big bridge and inside the locked (lvl 3 lock lol) trailer at the northern junkyard have always been lvl 15 for me and I've checked many times trying to get the damned Right Leg.  Have you seen higher lvl at those locations?
---
I realized this weekend I surpassed 750.  With player vending coming my hoarding habits might just come in handy. 
---
Crashing on your first nuke is a rite of passage, its less prevelant now but it does happen. I was lucky that I didn't on my first but good practice is to join a team before you launch so you can join back onto the server. 
---
I accidentally did this the other day to a poor level 22. 
---
I zoned in and then a split second a level 22 zoned in. Before charging the clubhouse I put on my headset and offered to tank for him so he could tag enemies but I think he had chat turned off. 
---
In the mean time while I‚Äôm trying to communicate that, the ghoulies catch our scent and rush us. He just disconnected. 
---
Sorry I skewed the ghouls so high, random level 22 dude. 
---
The proper debate format is thus:
---
When you say ____ i don't understand for the reason of _____.
---
Yeah I think it is around 10 floors max. I think I have 8 at the moment from the stairs on the bottom to my roof.
---
Is there a cap?
---
Kek. Me and a friend saw somebody just hanging in one spot of the map for a while, and figured that he must be at his camp. Now I‚Äôm not one to bully people, but my friend is. He went there and killed him a few times, and said he had a bunch of lead and was gonna just take half. Now me, needing to make 5.56, fast traveled over to him and took ~~everything else~~ the rest of the lead. Welcome to the wasteland, I guess. 
---
Who don't want a damn FishLamp after the apocalypse?  \~smh\~
---
I killed the queen solo (I was completely alone on the server), still don't have the challenge marked complete.
---
Ah yeah. East. Oops. I stumbled upon them a few day ago when running from a mothman that I wasn't prepared for. 
---
Yes, they exist. 
---
likewise mine would be "shotgun spray and pray"
---
I guess. I feel like the super mutants are the brutes and it doesn‚Äôt stretch the PA lore in the game. 
---
What good is a PA brute if they are stuck at a crawl. 
---
mirelurk kings are no joke
---
All these months of playing and its never occurred to me that legendaries get a free heal based on amount of stars, is this true?
---
That's the attitude that makes any opinion you carry invalid.  No one is going to give any idea you have any attention because you take the attitude of "it doesn't happen to me, so it's not a problem".   Take care dude, I dont have the energy to debate with you on this. 
---
LOL, yeah he's definitely Grahm's shadier sibling. :)
---
wow really? even the broken stuff? 
---
Categoricshoe47 
---
I have a zealot‚Äôs and a AA combat knife w/swing speed and +strength they are super fun weapons. My dream combat knife is a Bloodied version with those same attributes. 
---
Do you mean point pleasant bridge and the wv lumber mill?
---
They exist.  I sold a 3* to someone on PC a week or so ago.
---
I think it‚Äôs fun as it‚Äôs incredibly OP, using a fast weapon with the +swing speed perk you swing super fast and just obliterate everything in your path. 
---
Would depend on your preferred play style, but if you go with a mixed build you won‚Äôt get max damage on either weapon. 
---
Alternatively once you‚Äôre high enough level and have most the perk cards, you could switch as you please. For example I‚Äôm running a one handed gladiator build, but if I want to use a Sledgehammer I switch my gladiator cards to slugger. There‚Äôs gun cards in the strength tree you could switch to as well. 
---
It just debuffs the mutations for the duration of the Rad-X
---
Good question before i indulge my new-found weightless ap refresh armor addiction full binge lol
---
Make a melee character and a gun character. Level them both to around 8 -10. You'll know the answer to your question and any "mistakes" you make in SPECIAL allocation can be quickly fixed after you hit 50.
---
Explore on foot and only fast travel to your camp and vault 76
---
My caps tell a story of taking tons of caps from groups like you :].
---
oh, thank you verry much :-)
---
On the other hand my .50 HMG weighs the same as two soda bottles
---
There's more than one server. I too think they are scumbags. I just don't let it bother me and find a new server.
---
You wouldn't happen to have any more info on this would you? Don't perticularly want to make the same mistake again.. 
---
Also happy cake day and such.
---
Im truly interested in why you said ‚Äòcosplaying.‚Äô It‚Äôs literally something I have never done and think it‚Äôs kinda gross. 
---
THIS! .. We waste SO much time dealing with this crap, I gave up for now. Maybe after the "roadmap" is done - they will consider game breaking bugs a priority. 
---
Can something also be done about the repair cost for the decontamination arch? It is absurdly expensive to fix, to the point that people store it when not in use. It should cost stable flux to craft, not fix.
---
It seems cosmetic stuff in most games lean toward the silly or wacky, and usually have bright colors. Even Gears of War has neon pink guns and shit. I don't personally get the appeal, but then again, I'm probably not the target audience for that stuff.
---
Nope disgusting!!
---
I eat the corpse of my enemies :)
---
&gt; "How expensive is it to kill this thing?"
---
I just started thinking like this recently. I was a level 40ish when I killed my first Scorchbeast and I probably used 400 rounds between all the different weapons. 
---
In my defense I didn't know which one to use, and I pointlessly sprayed 10mm fire ammo and shotgun from too far away. 
---
I figured one more such engagement would KO my ammo reserves.
---
So can I reset the stats? I didn't know about it.
---
For now I've done only 1 lvl in Persistance, Concentrated Fire. So after that, I can choose anything. Could you give me nice build? 
---
Literally me dude plz bethesda just give me my guy back:(
---
The real tragedy is when you kill someone and find a few hundered of nearly every mat.  I never farm as a raider, I let fools do it for me.
---
This seems to be a fix for other online games as well that work like this, actually applied this while playing Skyrim Together with a friend and it worked. You‚Äôve fixed a problem for me in a whole nother game!
---
Yes, absolutely. I didn't come into this game expecting a lot in terms of pvp, because I'm huge on theorycrafting and the second I looked at what legendaries could be combined together and the potential damage output, I knew that the devs had no fucking idea what they were doing in terms of balancing damage output for pvp. I think it's much more "normalized" now. It's far better than it used to be though.
---
Excavator Armor never made it into production or use.  Mole Miners wouldn‚Äôt have had it to get stuck in. 
---
How long did it take them to reply to your ticket?
---
not to be a sticker... but you played for 20 hours and almost launched 20 nukes... but you also say one guy launches the nukes and it has a 3 hour cool down... 20 nukes should take about 60 hours then...
---
As a lowley level 17 would also like to know !
---
I thought a wanted a Quad version of most of my guns until I got a Quad Single Action Revolver. It took a surprisingly long while to reload all 24 rounds individually with the long reload animation. I assume the Lever Action Rifle would take awhile too. Just food for thought. 
---
Now you will never be drawn like one of his French girls..
---
Just bind it to a key of your liking with the controller turned off. I bound mine at left &lt;Ctrl&gt;. After turning on the controller it still works for PTT.
---
How much would you want for it? If it's still available of course!
---
I guess so.  Really your loss , more so than mine as its not a problem that's affected me or my partner . If you guys want to shoot yourself in the collective foot by taking an attitude of you're either with us or against us.. 
---
Still not working after attempting this..
---
I just lost the game. &gt;.&gt;
---
Become Johnny of the RadBoyGang or RBG for short. You go around selling drugs to new kids fresh out the vault. You wield a Submachine gun that you got from your uncle Tommy, also have your trusty knife with you incase you need to dice things up. When people don't buy your drugs you just start attacking them and talk smack on your mic saying things like "Just because you were raised in a metal box don't make ya smart like me kid" or "Should've stayed in school." Also your build has to be proficient at making drugs but you are also a business type with higher charisma. You could also run around with a pet and if it gets hurt you pop a bunch of drugs and kill everything in site for revenge.
---
Or maybe a nerve was hit?
---
I‚Äôm in no way a raider. I just try to be a good guy. But desperate times...
---
I'm also a fru fru pink pony kinda gal :) 
---
What's funny is that you actually see scorched that bug out sometimes that are holding gatling lasers / fat mans, but they are pointing them straight up, and they can't attack. They just kinda look at you and make noise. I think they just need fixed. Would be cool to see them in power armor though, although I'm not sure how that would work in terms of lore.
---
People enjoy lots of niche and bad things. Nothing wrong with that.
---
&gt; i still cook and sell everything for the xp and caps
---
smart man you are
---
Just like Monkey Magic.
---
I am going to try what it says here:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aumj5h/how\_is\_the\_camp\_spawn\_point\_determined/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aumj5h/how_is_the_camp_spawn_point_determined/)
---
I didn't know moving the CAMP thing changes the spawn point, I have my CAMP thing on the 4th floor.
---
In West Virginia??? There's no commuter train. People are not taking trains to go anywhere locally. There're only regional trains, like Amtrak. People are at the train station with luggage because they are waiting for the Amtrak to pass through town the once or twice a day it may pass through.
---
And, correct. The Amtrak rails are not empty. Like I mentioned in my other posts, the freight trains run through the passenger station without stopping, while you're waiting for the passenger train to come. Several freight trains can come through while you're waiting. But there are more freight trains passing through than passenger trains in smaller cities. Like I said before, in Columbia, SC, the passenger train only comes through twice a day. There is no commuter train in Columbia. 
---
And when you look at all of the mining and logging in WV, you can understand why there is a need for a lot of freight trains if they are exporting materials. That's why you see factories and warehouses right next to the rail yards and tracks in train stop towns. I used to drive 2000 miles a month in SC through these towns. Over 5 years of doing that, I probably only saw a passenger train a handful of times, compared to the, probably, many 10s, if not 100s of times I saw freight trains.
---
I dont take myself all that seriously tbh I thought it was a mildly amusing shower thought type thing. Oh well. 
---
an xp tip..go to whitespring and stand on the ledges so they cant get to u..u need a powerful weapon..so u need at least a hunting rifle
---
PLAYERS as well. I was ganked while loading in to defend my workshop because the person attacking stood on the spawn point and unloaded directly into my head at point blank range. This is REALLY frustrating to go defend and get killed because I literally can't do anything for 3-4 seconds while the fade in from black / control lock is on.
---
A lot of the challenges are bugged. I've discovered Grafton Dam with 5 characters and it still says I have not. There's about a dozen challanges that don't work and usually one a week. And if a weekly is pick flowers and not pick wild flowers it doesn't work :/
---
\^
---
No i dont have it :/
---
Awesome idea we really need this !! 
---
No, I leave bags of it on toilets.
---
Very nice! You must have spent some time designing it and it turned out lovely üòä 
---
Ah good looking out. Fixed it.
---
 Yes my alt has one. ;)
---
I can't wait for survival to get in on some fun pvp
---
I use the glowing meat pile mod, works great!
---
Wish I read this sooner.. got green thumb yesterday to begin my Mothman egg farming but was extremely disappointed to see it no longer worked on eggs.. just wasted a perk card.. would've prefered woodchucker over green thumb as green thumb is now useless to me.... Other than regular vegetation does green work benefit anything else?
---
You seem pretty hostile for no reason dude.Also you cannot fast travel while thirsty or hungry or I cant atleast it shows me a message saying so.
---
3 hour cool down for each nuke silo, you can launch from Alpha then go to Bravo, then Charlie, once the 3 hours is up you can launch from Alpha again. 
---
3 silos.
---
 The Single Action is a useless gun. Get a Western Revolver and yes it does.

They should steal arks taming and breeding methods lol

John Bethesda here, ill get right on it! Expect an update within the hour!
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer u/Valseek u/Ladydevann u/kindofsquishy please take a look at this.

Perhaps you should consider becoming a raider. It is the quickest way to make caps and acquire mats.  
---
Tesla rifle makes them easy
---
Wrong subreddit. 
---
It doesn't work if you're out of regular stimpaks. Super stimpaks and diluted stimpaks won't work for revivals. 
---
It's not a for us or against us thing.  You telling people what you're "tired" of seeing is not the way to get folks to listen to what you have to say.  Regardless of your good ideas, (which I have stated multiple times that they are) people aren't going to care, if you pretty much start out your statement telling them that you are tired of their complaints.  You seem so stuck on your ideas that you don't get that.  As far as an "our loss" type deal, the folks on this thread were just fine before you graced us with your opinions, I'm sure we'll get by without them (we'll find a way).  Obviously there are enough people here who have a problem that it warrants a thread, that you being "lucky" is just that.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure grieving people is against terms of service, so it's really not their right, paying customers or not. 
---
Step, the single step in front of the fucking door to fort defiance fails to function as a step
---
I completed the collect wood challenge a few weeks back - it took me a while to realize that the wording of the challenge is ambiguous. I'd much rather have it count towards the amount of wood you collect and not the number of times you collect wood. Of course - once you finish the first challenge the next one is to collect wood 7600 times. That is not going to happen within my lifetime. (of playing the game).
---
I think even blowing up a car to kill someone causes a wanted level. pretty sure an orbital strike would too.
---
&gt;I think this bug should have a very high priority because of how frequent and highly disrupting it is to gameplay experience.
---
Awww, you cute kids, thinking Bethesda actually fixes game breaking bugs.   
---
Pro Tip:  The fact you "Absolutely in love" with a game that is such a piece of shit is 100% the reason why they will never fix those bugs.   You love playing with dog shit, why remove the smell now?  You've already proven you'll keep playing with the dog shit.
---
&gt;the only issue though is it limits the rewards to Enclave
---
Until more expansive faction content is added, sticking the late-game stuff behind the Enclave is the only thing that really makes sense. 
---
The Enclave is already positioned as the end-game portion of the storyline, so it would make sense for the end-game encounter rewards to be redeemed there.
---
like a mule with a spinning wheel... No one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it.
---
 I love killing these commie drones. AMERICA
---
I wish we knew what they were saying rather than "speaks Chinese".

No. That is terrible. lol

Spend a few caps to move your camp and it will all be repaired 
---
Dude, if I saw loose screws I would have taken them too...   
---
This is a tough one.  If he picked them up, he doesn't deserve a ban.  But how do they account for that???
---
I have the same problem on PS4. I have a ticket in with Bethesda but no real word from them. I'm going to try just pushing through to the next step of the quest that I looked  and see if it just let's me move on.
---
Corn soup especially - adds AP regen
---
Been there, done that.  Noticed a significant downtick in camp griefing as of late.  Makes one wonder why.  In the end, it‚Äôs just junk. :) As long as some folks enjoy it, I‚Äôm happy. 
---
Yep.
---
Oh, that's true- good point. I've done that haha. Well, here goes nothing then...
---
Ya. We‚Äôve noticed if you can see the name plate you can reequip an outfit but it‚Äôs annoying as heck. Also, there is a bug where you can‚Äôt see the name plate and you have to relog. It sucks so much when you are deep in a building and get put outside and have to run through it all again to get to the group. 
---
Your point?
---
Then all those desk fans and clipboards will just sit there!
---
Aren't you tired of seeing these posts too? 
---
True, but rare.
---
Thank you!  And yes, I‚Äôm a bit obsessive about camp building. 
---
I know there‚Äôs the saying ‚Äúdie a hero or love long enough to become the bad guy,‚Äù and I know I‚Äôm probably already going down the path of the latter. So as much as I may hate raiders, I‚Äôll probably become one. Can...can I still wear my tuxedo while being a dick? 
---
I'\[ll put it like this:  I high strength build with melee perks is the one build where you can't go wrong.   I've said since the first week that the game is really out of whack in favor of melee. 
---
Yeah, I'm sure there' exceptions to this but the short version is that:
---
1. Melee weapons just  do more damage
---
2. They have very cheap repair 
---
3. They break slower 
---
4. You don't have to go around scavenging lead, steel and gunpowder or capture an ammo factory to make them work. 
---
Guns are way past due for a buff, especially heavy guns, in my opinion. 
---
I have only two characters, and both have 15 strength.  One of them is a rifleman build, the other is a heavy weapons build, but I go through times when I swap out for melee perks and use melee so I can spend time stockpiling ammo for my guns. 
---
idk
---
You can place a foundation on the potted plants in the atom store 
---
It's all like you can trade pets on the market "I have a lvl 50 scorched beast that's blue want 25k caps"
---
after level 50, each level you get you can either move one of your special points or pick a new perk card. 
---
If you want to do a full reset it‚Äôs a bit of a pain as you‚Äôd need say another 50+ levels to completely change your character, but it‚Äôs easy to move a few points around
---
At least you saw him. I heard his voice near Charleston and couldn't see him. He kept talking but I had to give up since he and his lovable cow wasn't visible.
---
I really wish there was a limit to how many times someone can take revenge.  It gets boring when someone keeps trying to kill me and I just keep killing them. I refuse to leave a server because they dont know when to give up
---
Yeah idk why they didn't copy that over. That sitting position worked for anyone who used that couch. I remember having it in one of my settlements and waking up to Preston laying on the couch, lol.
---
Mono'doh

My melee character eats everything regardless of what state it is in.
---
My stealth character eats processed foods only.

oh yeah!!!!!

Improvise, adapt, and overcome 
---
Thing is, they invite people to those events specifically to get blind adoration and good PR.
---
Thoughtful criticism isn't useful for building hype.

I think a mailbox type thing would be awesome. Can put items in a "package" with a pre-prepared note (generic like "thank you" to avoid people abusing the system with nasty notes)...

According to this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/edit#gid=165633648 it can be located anywhere Gourmet Recipes drop, or as a random quest reward for Cranberry Bog events. If you are on PC, I have a spare recipe for it I can sell you.
---
I'd love to see a map of the whole tram system before the war..the giant loop around WV
---
I have not played in a while (honestly forgot the game existed) but did they not fix most of the bugs by now? I mean it has been months so I would assume that the game is at a way better place then it was at the start wouldn't it?
---
PSA for anyone reading - the challenge does not require taking all 20 at once and you can always just server hop.  That being said, this sounds like just as good a solution as any, and I second the whole "just talk to people" approach when you can, sometimes you make a decent friend that way.
---
I think there is a reliable spawn for the recipe in Freddy Fears House of Scares, which is up north close to the Red Rocket Mega Stop. I‚Äôve usually found them inside the kitchen
---
I do believe that you need either lockpick one or two to get it though. 
---
dang it!
---
This post made me realize I'm a sadist when killing protectrons. I always shot their legs then dance around them as they crawl and try to shoot me.
---
Could you give me good melee build?   
---
And I've also spent 1 point into persistance (Concentrated fire), is it a problem? :/ 
---
How is this possible? These major bugs were the reason I put this game down long ago, hoping to eventually return when it became a functioning game. This is laughable considering they made it clear they would put in serious effort to fix the mess they released. 
---
I'm not about to shoot those cute little Scorchies and Clawbois in their tums
---
Ahaha man. Lunch breaks have to be real weird after that. 
---
Could you give me any good build? And is it a problem that I've already used 1 lvl into Persistance (Conc. fire)? 
---
I don't like it. Be famous = get more famous because you're famous, even though you don't do anything. Wait. Isn't that just Kim Kardashian?
---
I believe I said good day, sir!
---
Worse and worse every day? I played for 5 hours yesterday and had 1 weird loot glitch. Half of the people got 3 star explosives?? I myself hate waiting for the SBQ to load its loot but its understandable when the server has to load in roughly 500 new items for all if the people participating, further server optimization will improve this issue. But it's not getting worse every day. I've played since the stress test. Level 204, sbq is a high draw even for servers. Sometimes it performs pretty great. These posts seem like they are written before the poster stops and takes a deep breath, I killed sbq 2 consecutive times in the same server and had no issue once I waited for the loot to load.
---
Intimidating when one could have a fatman at high levels or a kitted out flamer at mid levels chewing through that health and obscuring your vision for getting too close.
---
Looks awesome good stuff.
---
Saves ammo too!
---
explain how this is the wrong subreddit when there is literally a flair for trading.
---
It's in a completely unrelated thread, but Bethesda replied that this issue is already listed for a fix in the next patch.

You can upgrade your refresh speed by the perk I think is called "action man/woman" but when you are done upgrading that perk I think that is sort of a cap, I hope that is your answer

Dude!  I'm agreeing with you %100!  What you're not taking away from this is... If you want people to listen, don't come into a thread full of upset people and tell them that you're TIRED of seeing their threads.  If you had come at folks differently, they would probably have listened to what you had to say instead of reflexively downvoting you.  That's been my point (the one you're missing) all along.  Not contesting the validity of what you have to say, just how you're saying it.  People aren't in this thread because they're having a  great time, they have a problem that so far, hasn't been properly addressed.

aww but daAAAAAAAd like that means I have to do stuff other than what I want to do right now ... make them server hop.

Look at the coment of the other dude. But havent checked if it works yet.

What about the brotherhood?

There‚Äôs a river behind my camp. I can wash it out.

The wrong Allen died.

Dude I hope really hope they make it a faction 
---
Can I get updates post patch etc.... 
---
anyone loose anything at all?  
---
I keep asking in game and all I hear is nobody at all had anything happen to them as it applies to having duuped items removed.
---
Just an RPG, thanks.
---
Pretty sure hunger/thirst never disables fast travel. And claiming that this makes survival a thing is like saying the combat is hard because if you let a supermutant shoot you 50 times before you respond then you usually die.
---
There is no scarcity, there is no danger that you can find yourself stuck in the middle of nowhere with no prospect for finding anything edible. Hell, if you do decide to starve yourself to death for the funnies you don't even suffer for it.
---
The point is, if you want to die due to survival mechanics you have to actively try to do it. It can't just sneak up on an unprepared player and do them in. But why would you let yourself starve when if you are completely screwed you can spawn your C.A.M.P right on top of yourself, stash, food, water and all.
---
Free of charge.
---
They've been doing this for some time (as early as early January) but yeah it seems unlikely that even though they never travel in threes they somehow heard you got the munitions plant and decided to team up.
---
I would maybe be ok with one but three? Ffs sometimes I think Bethesda had never actually fought one.
---
I don‚Äôt. People seeking revenge is my main source of caps. Let em keep at it, just more cash in my pocket. Eventually they figure out that they can‚Äôt kill ya. 
---
my first tame disappeared in front of me after taming. my second one attacked friends on team then disappeared never to return. my third tame never came back but I found her dead on my porch when I came back later. 
---
and this is after trying to get this to even work at all  .... so much needs fixed here.

You could try a Gauss Rifle or even a Plasma Rifle, Also Tank Killer is great.
---
I traded a bunch of aluminum for 6 caps a pop the other day for over 1k caps and it made my day lol
---
How about then they cant seek revenge if they are out of caps because I had a guy that I cleaned of his caps after 3 kills and he kept coming like 15 more times

Only if I can turn it off/ignore it.

Wow some of you need to calm down and I saw a few people recommend that they should and why I brought it up. I play 76 still its a good game, I like it.

Thanks for letting me know!

Love the condescending attitude you‚Äôre putting forward. Your parents ever tell you your opinion isn‚Äôt worth that much?
---
I can 1 shot protectrons in the torso, can‚Äôt 1 shot them anywhere else
---
Glad it wasn‚Äôt just me &amp; my slow internet connection.
---
Yep that's how I built my condo 
---
Just crossed lines I guess.  Im mistook the ' tones' of your comments . Its all good my man ! 
---
Judging by the frequency of the "REEEEEE" i'm pretty sure it's saying "Kill me".
---
Assaultron and Protectron legs are both weak points as well, particularly with assaultrons. Assaultrons can still face beam you when down, but they crawl very slowly and it makes them much easier to deal with. Just don't disable their arms, because they will sprint at you and self destruct on you if their arms are disabled and their legs still function.
---
 Thanks for letting me know! 
---
so annoying when people set up their turretts at the back of the whitrsprings golf club..waste of good looting and xp. 
---
This is helpful.  Are there certain weapon/ammo types that are better for damage to certain enemies?  Energy? Shotgun? etc?  I'd love to see that info too....
---
I think I've seen you in a scotch beast queen fight.
---
Everything except wolves, ghouls, and those damned mole rats can be inflicted with the Scorch. I didn‚Äôt think this included our saviors however. 
---
They should make it "Diseased Radroach \*\*\*"
---
Someone did this to me and I thought was very polite, so I do the same. I did it to one person and they didn't reply, so I took it. They showed up about 10 mins later, they didn't build anything except some turrets. They realized I sent them a message and apologized for not seeing it. Was funny .. I leant you can't take a workshop very well in pacifist mode ..
---
If you want to be immersed and follow the story I suggest you head to the overseers office and eject the holotape from there and listen to it. 
---
Also pick up free stuff at stands and last stand has some perk cards and your first level up.
---
Play as much as possible without fast travelling unless you have run that specific A-B scenario a lot of times because its between the locations the game shines with random enocunters and lot of weird stuff placed everywere. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to spoil your entry to I suggest just listening to the holotape and go from there. You appreciate your surroundings alot more when you know the stories.
---
You can get a perk card that shows their innate defence. Such examples are robots are weaker to energy damage. Super mutants are immune to radiation etc.
---
Psst. A fine tuned heavy gunner bloodied build is hands down the best in the game currently. I can clear a nuke zone whitespring clubhouse full of ghouls in less than 15 seconds if the rush me through the front door. A three level 80 scorchbeast attack lasts 30 seconds.  
---
Lastly for PvP I haven‚Äôt lost a fight in weeks, even against the ‚Äúinvincible‚Äù Assassins/sentinel armor sets.
---
Speaking of which, how many Withdrawal effects can one have? For that Junkie legendary perk? 
---
This game is a joke.
---
The GMs/Devs are a joke.
---
Bethesda is a joke.
---
OP is just an idiot.
---
There done. So who's excited about The Divide 2!?
---
I know what the consensus is. But I assume your parents instilled in you that your opinion is worth more than that of other people? I mean, everyone else is wrong about this game if you're enjoying it right?
---
a LOT of crouching
---
I put what I‚Äôm currently using, but there‚Äôs a lot of personal preference attached to your build so you‚Äôll want to design something that matches how you like to play - this is where it might be good to do a few throwaway characters to see what you like. For example:
---
-Do you want to use power armor
---
-What‚Äôs your preferred weapon
---
-Do you want a high health build or a low health - low health gets extra damage boosts with some perks and armor but you‚Äôll have to maintain that low health 
---
-Are you going to use chems (boosts stats for a short period of time)
---
-Are you going to use mutations (offers benefits in one field in exchange for reduction in another field)
---
-Do you want the convenience factor of weight reduction perks (inventory management becomes a large game aspect later on)
---
-Do you want to use items to heal/cure rads or would you prefer to have perks that can heal you
---
-Are you playing on a team or solo 
---
I‚Äôd recommend going through the nukes website and just play around and see what appeals to you personally. 
---
My current build is around a solo, unarmed meat hook weapon, not using power armor so I put emphasis on the defensive/reducing incoming damage but I also added some quality of life perks -ie reduced AP spend for sprinting just because it annoys me to walk slow, and adamantium skeleton maxed cause it irritates me to stimpak when I break a leg. 
---

If it isn't a body part that can be targeted in VATS, then it doesn't exist. You're just hitting some other body part.

I second this

That‚Äôs every post on this website. Some bloke posts an article from any publication on the appropriate subreddit and people will gild it. It‚Äôs a way for people to express something they really like.

In this case, I don‚Äôt think Jon cares. SolarDragon was doing something nice for his mate by sharing his friend‚Äôs work and I‚Äôm sure Jon appreciates it. Nothing horrible or dishonest or *sinister* about it
---
Oh what was the game that didn't ban cheaters, just put all the cheaters on the same server? I want this but with scumbags. 
---
If you want to buy the plan, the Grafton Station sells it. The cost is a little over $1800. It is the lever gun plan. 
---
yeah but is there not a star at the end of the name?
---
Most vendor bots sell them
---
Oh ok thx
---
They shoudl get into debt... with interest :D
---
Once you reach - 25k you declare bankruptcy and your character gets reset to lvl 1 :P
---
I did the blackwater thing, got 4 mutations after several attempts and server hopping. I lucked out and got some decent ones, but it really is luck of the draw. I was curious about it, too, and already had starched genes, so I was good to go. 
---
That is very true, servwr hopping woukd have been my first choice tbh but i had the munitions factory on the go asqell and wamted to keep it xD
---
My tse gatling laser shreds her health, but even with weapon artisan it just doesn't last long. I want to play around with the perk that has a chance to repair your weapon on a kill, but that seems chaotic and probably wouldn't help much.
---
Fists and hammers are 
---
Woah dude... I might use your story and pretend is was me, if that's ok?
---
I mean I just haven't been laid in a while and this is guaranteed action right here.
---
I dunno man ionized meat is pretty delicious.
---
I'm not sure what is more of a slap in the face. Getting nothing or getting some nocturnal pool cue or a piece of wood armor.
---
I wish they did something like that for people with high bounties. If they have a 1000 cap bounty and only have 10 caps i should get 1000 for killing them and they now have -990 caps and have to earn caps to get them back to zero befor they can buy anything or fast travel
---
'Hey sexy lady, wanna kill all humans?' My friend Bender Bending Rodrigues told me..   
---
Well, it's nothing complicated.   Invest heavily in strength perks, and melee perk are all in the strength tree.   Slugger is the melee perk that I use but gladiator is good too.
---
750?
---
The vendors sell deep pocketed plans for 1250 (base price, no hard bargain).
---
[based on this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H5lmmYb3lSbGhu2v9W99vHp_0vDzWv0A2HLn3yUfjpI/edit?usp=drivesdk)
---
You can still sometimes pick them even if nothing is on then, there was a bug a while ago, I still try pick stuff 
---
No, you can't reset the stats (SPECIAL points). But you can move the perk cards around once you've picked them, and by level 50 you'll have enough perk cards to really change your character.
---
Ooooph.  Hmm. Need to see how many caps I got.  I‚Äôm light these days. Though you might say a few hundred.  Would you be offended at 500?

---
You still need to aim up. I don't have one at the moment to test, but from what I recall, the mirv splits as soon as it hits the highest point of it's trajectory, so if you shot it straight out, or downwards, that's going to be immediately. After splitting, the sub-warheads separate and fall in a sorry if umbrella pattern, meaning some are going to come back towards you from where they split. So yeah, if you fire it straight out, or down, even if you are shooting it off a cliff or roof, you will hit yourself. What you want to do is fire it upwards, so that the top of the arc is above the target, and away from you, then let all those babies rain down.
---
they used what they could for evac, freight, passenger, whatever they had
---
I will fully mod your gatling gun for the mats required. I've done this for people before. I was lucky and I've only scrapped about 30 or so gatling guns and I have all the mods unlocked. 
---
What region are you in where you're only seeing 5-7 people on a server? I'm in the NW, and I can't recall the last time I saw a server that wasn't full or nearly full. I've also had numerous occasions where I've tried to join friends and got stuck in the queue because the world was full.
---
Add in the fact that a TSE "Legendary" gun (both Lever Action and Handmade) now feel like pathetic garbage, I can't even kill BUGS without multiple hits - makes the idea of playing the game quite unappealing, very sad.
---
Yeah the Scorched are a letdown. They are pretty much just ghouls. 
---
Should have just had human NPCs. 
---
While nice in theory, I don't want my base overrun with the deranged rantings of xXx_Pu55–ßDestroyer_xXx
---
The thing is - fusion cores were meant to be able to last hundreds of years!
---
First TSE was stupidly OP, then, they went overboard with the nerf.  
---
Rifles in general are stupidly weak and pathetic - even with a ton of perks put towards trying to make them effective.
---
There you are. I knew you'd show up
---
Just bought it today mate, can't go wrong for 10‚Ç¨. 
---
Its still Fallout, and i love it.
---
There is...
---
Pretty sure carnivore protects me against diseases from meat so I eat whatever I have really
---
Ps4? I'll sell you one for 1k
---
Did you aim up, from the top? Or just shoot it straight out or down?
---
It's stuff like this that keeps me logging into the game. Hugs out to the care bears.
---
Man i wanna buu 1 jus to try it
---
500 is fine
---
The train station platforms are comically tiny, where I live trains don't stop at stations that tiny very often.
---
I'm still playing it daily and loving it, can't wait for the updates to start rolling in either!!
---
Also have a good group of like minded players who I am always teaming up with so that helps too üòÅ
---
If you're on xb, I have the plans I'd be willing to part with for a reasonable price.
---
I can show you a very quiet spot with little to no enemies, I just moved from there after being there for months. Has a very good view and I never had a single turret or other defense set up.
---
I know the winter jacket is 
---
My whole plan of attack relies on positional advantage - carefully scope out a point where I can safely shoot the enemies but they can't easily get to me.
---
I like it - the negative opinions are overblown and the roadmap for 2019 is exciting
---
I found using guns to be more fun, but much harder because they do a lot less damage and so the enemies don't die as fast. Also I wound up running out of certain types of ammo, so I either had to carry multiple types of guns with me (which made me over-encumbered and unable to fast-travel) or craft more ammo at a tinker's station (which required finding lead and gunpowder).
---
After level 40 or so I switched to melee -- the enemies die faster, so the game is easier, and I don't have to craft ammo. However, I do have to craft a little bit of ammo for when I fight the scorchbeast, since it is airborne most of the time.
---
To make the Scrapper perk even more useful, add a second star to it to get (some, then all with a 3-star perk?) the screws and springs back, but add a countdown timer to the process. This would slow people down, making it not necessarily everyone's cup of tea (or too OP), and would have the added effect of being easier on server resources. 
---
Is it a good idea? I honestly don't know, but I'd give it a shot if it were an option. I'm currently overloaded on springs and farming desk fans for screws. 
---
BTW, if you're looking for springs, I can't recommend Sugar Grove enough. Pens and clipboards are in abundance. I have a Troubleshooting Fast sledgehammer with the heavy rocket mod on with rank 3 martial artist, and I go "John Henry on Psychobuff" on all the robots in there.
---
Hahah. Yeah but once and a while? I mean the dude can run up and yell in the mic. And teenagers in real life still drive by and yell things. To be expected.
---
I can attest that they all get at least 1 heal (in FO4 a message saying "ENEMY_NAME Mutated" would pop up) where they get swirly glowy stuff around them (unless you down them quickly enough). It was in another thread on here that I saw someone mention that they get an additional heal for each star but I can't seem to find information elsewhere about it.
---
Also the email says aquired in 30-days of game play not had on you at one time. Picking up one bag probably means he picked up more then one. And honestly the one bag put him half way to the 100k. 
---
Nah, I keep hold of my spoiled food and make fertiliser later
---
Can you post your build
---
I was actually thinking about adding not the song but whatever it is you're talking about
---
you can't really tell if ur doing more damage to her with certain weapons if ur not killing her solo.
---
Agreed.
---
Specially once the survival mode goes up although I have a feeling the worst offenders will steer clear of that.
---
The handful of 'griefers' I have encountered were mostly opportunists, only one of them was actually somewhat skilled.
---
Depends are you going for raw damage per shot or something that you can fire multiple times before having to reload?  
---
Just save your ammo and all riser super sledge everything in the face. 
---
I thought all robots was the torso weak spot 
---
Shooting a protection's combat inhibitor worked pretty well for me. Better than the torso? 
---
Yep, I have/had the plan. Got it from Grafton and I don't remember what I paid for it but I don't think it was $1800.
---
No but there's diminishing returns
---
Amazing to me. Three months later, and here you are with the same problem. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure if you aim close to straight up you will live, but I don‚Äôt know because I haven‚Äôt tried it.
---
What I have done is shoot my Daisycutter off a cliff near whitesprings, and blowing myself up, fundamental proof it is broken
---
Also not the evidence of absence.
---
Oh c'mon, she's way too old!
---
U on xb1..lol so i can buy i
---
I witnessed an orbital strike on a whitespring camp yesterday  - followed by some guys taking care of the rest with miniguns. 
---
It was glorious. 
---
Spammed the guy with the biggest bounty with thumbs Ups and hearts. 
---
First, where would you even store all that? Even if you can dupe items, the stash limit should limit even that. On a side note, even after playing for months, I feel like I have nothing to show for it. I can‚Äôt even keep legendaries AND the necessary materials I need. It‚Äôs a constant trade-off and that bugs me. 
---
you can never be too old ;)

"According to established Fallout lore the Brotherhood of Steel should not have emerged from their Californian bunker until around the year 2150. Fallout 76, however, is set on the other side of the country - in 2102."
---
It‚Äôs uncommon , you can get it if you manage to spawn the Charleston vendor bot with a friend and server hop a few times . It‚Äôs not worth that much , because it‚Äôs kinda ugly . The hunters Longcoat,  longshoreman and the clean space suit are the most requested of the uncommon ones .
---
I have only ran into one group of greifers. They had one guy with a high bounty. We killed him and got no caps then him and his buddies where free to pvp against us. Luckily they didn't do to well and we came out with more caps but we had to all pop stealth boys to disengage because they ran out of caps but kept seeking revenge 
---
The best part is I came out with around the same amount of caps I had before the war started. I'll try the PVP servers but idk if they will be for me or not 
---
can you (re)write my irl biography please 
---
Checking in. Took a break for two weeks. Looking for an excuse to come back but haven't found it yet in this subreddit. I'll comment my opinions if I damn please lol.
---
Remarkably well. Even in daylight things don't see me unless in fairly close. The stealth multiplier helps me do one shots on many &lt;40 guys. 
---
I play similarly to this guy. I have several weight reduction perks. Bandolier and several hours with the munitions factory has me setting at about 11k weightless .45 rounds. But I do carry a few guns. I mostly use a silenced explosive lever action but I have a silenced +30% robot handmade as well.
---
I also carry an excavator suit for when I'm too heavy or as extra protection if the bad guys find me.
---
But still it's like something I use less than 5% of the time.
---
Holy cow I got a alt just like this, his name is stinky Pete, stealth/carrying stuff/rumbages out the trash/runs away and uses pipe pistols.
---
Idiot? Come on person. I never name called and I believe all I've been is nice. Even though I'm getting down voted for it. (strange concept) 
---
I agree. Griefers aren't as common as some people make them out to be. Just pointing out the worst case scenarios of accepting random team invites.

This is the single gayest string of comments I think I‚Äôve ever read.

My dude dont know what galaxy you are on but this is fallout 76..absolutely nobody gives a flying sh*t are you kidding us lmaooo get on re2, apex, hell even the god forsaken order 1886, anything to stop reminding people of what cheap lousy revitalized 2008 formula they rebooted while keeping the graphics and animations..id say missions but noone has had such lackluster in any era.. i believe ridge racers galaga section in the first 30 seconds had more action and replay than fallout76
---
Nice one, I reckon Nerdrage perk is mandatory
---
They don‚Äôt have to add you (at least on Xbox) to join because I‚Äôve used it to track down a couple of guys that wrecked my house and wreck em back - definitely weren‚Äôt people that friended me &gt;.&lt;
---
There might be a privacy setting though, depending on the platform, that allows for something like appearing online but people can‚Äôt join your game.  On Xbox at least it‚Äôs either 1) appear offline, 2) block for session in-game, or 3) they can join.

Hope I could help some!

Step 1- return the game. LOL JK check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals

It's a good thing I have more upvotes than I have f**ks to give... Cause you sir have earned this one. This is an excellent recommendation.

All the things I'm looking for. Would you mind sending me a pm with your location on the map? It would be hard for me to log in right now.

I always feel bad for the guy (what's left of him, anyway) draped over the pinball machine in Watoga Station. I can't imagine what his last thoughts were. "Welp, can't leave and robots are murdering everyone, might as well go for high score"
---
Whats your problem?
---
Stop answering all these comments as if bethsada is viewing your comments and will forgive.
---
Oh, the game is mostly great. The map is fantastic, fun to explore, and the combat is fun too. The later parts of the game have problems (i.e. server crashing so you can't hold workshops, most guns are under-powered, not enough inventory or stash space) but the game is still fun.
---
Allow me to introduce you to r/furry_irl ~~and now I‚Äôll take the downvotes~~
---
Vault Tec Security guy sounds like fun if there'd be more wanted individuals
---
It was up a ways in the forest above WS. Not all that concealed or anything so I guess he stumbled onto it. When I found him, he was just finishing up destroying the upper floor so I logged out 
---
If you find a starred-legendary, use a low-damage weapon and kite around it while using the 'come here' emote for people in the area. If no one is around or comes by soon, feel free to kill it. Also, the legendaries you can get from Uranium Fever cap out at level 40.
---
Does it have to be unique workshops, or can you ignore the defense event and then retake it for a 2nd credit?
---
Try adrenaline &amp; bloody mess perks
---
Instigating  rifle for solo play or bloodied(if your willing to do low health) will boost your damage.
---
If going down the bloodied path also use nerd rage perk.
---
Did someone take your junk?
---
I would stay clear if I were you. I have 259 hours in the game and let me tell yah. This isn‚Äôt worth it. Glitches aren‚Äôt bad, but once u hit level 30 or so and have discovered every thing the game gets really boring and u can only look forward to the grind of rank 50, but even when u hit level 50 and finish the story, there is nothing exciting to do. I‚Äôve redone my camp 10+ times from the ground up for cool styles but it gets boring fast. Also the gameplay turns spongey after level 50 and if u don‚Äôt buy a two shot explosive weapon from reddit then ur just stuck putting 25 rounds into one super mutant. The combat doesn‚Äôt get more challenging just more boring. I‚Äôve always wanted an online ( co op ) fallout but we got this garbage instead. Also looking towards the future. They haven‚Äôt put much support into this game. There has been some patches but not a lot over a long time. And the dlc coming sounds really stupid. It isn‚Äôt a big one like far harbor. It is just more events on the same map and events can get really boring after you‚Äôve done 50 of em. So I‚Äôd say skip this and buy metro 
---
Its PC but no, she'll keep that. ;)
---
I built much the same next to the Whitespring Station, hoping it's out of the blast zone. But yes, everything is open for the public whenever I'm online. 
---
Step 2, in particular, is why I enjoy this game so much. It's Friday with the most inopportune crashes, but the fact that you can basically play this game as you want us very compelling.
---
Note to self, if I ever see a suspicious bag filled with shitloads of items, make sure I only pick up 99k items out of it.
---
In seriousness though, I have developed a habit of hitting take all on any paper bag I see. If I came across a duper's bag, I'd have picked it up without thinking, and only noticed when my AP started dropping while walking in my power armor. It would be in my inventory for at least a minute without me even knowing. I get the feeling that even if I dropped it all soon as I noticed, Bethesda would still ban me for ever having it to begin with, even though it was unintentional.
---
Really fucked up Bethesda.
---
You also forgot to mention they also do more damage and can have special abilities the messages for them can be found in the last patch notes
---
Okay, well my gay ass reported you.
---
[long, awkward silence, punctuated only by chewing]
---
‚ÄúSo uh... wh- would you, uh, like my fruit cu-‚Äú
---
‚ÄúJust, just leave me alone, Michael...‚Äù
---
Lol ok
---
It's for cosplayers.
---
"What's something that could be whipped up in a week with readily available items from Walmart?"
---
Where did you get his head gear?
---
Isn't really "on him" though?
---
I have a lot of weightless 1 stars and a few 2 stars  I don't need, I've been trying to get rid of them for cheap, around 300 caps etc but no one wants them. 
---
As I started watching I was afraid he'd be doing lategame focused builds, but he nicely suggests some minimum special points + handy perks, and uses that as a basis. Also his backstories are (sometimes) quite good, I *really* like how the squad sergeant's backstory and gameplay interact. He's a sniper (because) he's kinda immobile, also higher charisma because he's an inspirational squad leader, and the perks really weave nicely into it. Thank you a lot for this suggestion.
---
You have 2 image of your junk tab...
---
You say you had zero Nuka Cola...
---
That'd be under aid...
---
So... 
---
IT WORKS. My brother tested it for me cause I'm at work. This is life changing lol 
---
If youre on Xbox I want to give you armor I picked up that's plus stealth and reduced junk just because I respect the roleplay
---
Yes that's kind if the point if them..
---
If you build a turret nest at the back oh Whitesprings clubhouse, I will destroy it :)
---
https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/01/04/video-game-communication-now-covered-by-accessibility-law/
---
make a post and tag the Beth employees asking if the cvaa affects them. 
---
Yes, they aren't loaded in yet and are trying to open menus..lmao
---
Added you
---
It amazes me that people are still trying to play this game in earnest. At some point you have to know that you forked over your money for a half-baked POS whose own devs don't know how to support. Cut your losses.
---
Will be on in an hour and a half maybe
---
If a high level character calls you over they normally are trying to help. 
---
I have tried numerous times to hand out some purified water &amp; stimpaks &amp; the other player runs the other way.
---
I would have loved those items below level 10
---
I was like you. Skeptical. I was actually excited when I first saw the trailer but didnt buy it immediately due to the amount of hate it got but I said fuck it 2 weeks later, bought it for full price and enjoyed it a lot. Currently level 150 with 330 hours in. The world is immersive and not too challenging, well it is if you are just starting. The enemies are cool albeit a little bit annnoying. It is also cheaper than it was before, so there's that. There are also a lot upcoming events which introduces new stuff, all for free. 
---
As for the negative reviews, a lot of them are recycled, "X" has stated that fo76 is shit and is a buggy mess, "Y" wants to write an article about it but is less inclined to play the game and bandwagon's "X's" review. I am by no means saying the game is perfect but it's fun. For me. Money well spent. Try it and form your own opinion, if it isn't for you and you dislike the game then your negative opinion about it will be fair and valid.
---
My first location was in the woods directly between the White Powder Winter Sports and Relay Tower HN-B1-12. This gave me a lot of wood to pick up and there is three work benches close by since I didn‚Äôt have the plans. Additionally there are a lot of blackberries, squirrels and frogs in the area for food. Additionally I can farm scrap at the radio tower, downed airplane and the lodge. After that. Now I am south  of top of the world heading to the National Isolated Radio Array  as their is little player traffic and has a nice pond with a small waterfall 
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they jacked the price up for that plan like r erytbing else... But yea it was like 8-900 prior
---
Nope just fair pvp, well it‚Äôs usually 2-3vs me but that‚Äôs still usually fair.
---
I don't know why we're pretending these 2 branchs of Bethesda can't communicate or corroborate and therefore they get a pass. 0% of their job requires physical proximity. It's 2019.
---
I can only consume the most exquisite, cumbersome and elitist meals and recipes as to not anger the ghost of my father Bob the Baker by eating peasant food. To honor the memory of my mother as a security guard I vow to shoot before asking questions.
---
Maybe the cvaa could be reason to get them to add it, also could be the reason they didn't add it (some companies went with no communications as an option)
---
Talking out your ass I see
---
Bring back the Super Mutant Suiciders. They were fun to shoot at in Fallout 4. As long as you actually hit them at a safe distance.
---
Probably not true but would definitely be interesting: after the bombs fell someone found a working train engine and hooked all the passengers cars they could find to it. That person is currently traveling all over the continent wherever they can find intact rails collecting survivors and handing out aid when they come across a failing settlement. This person is also to protagonist of an unreleased Fallout spinoff game called Fallout: North America or something like that.
---
You're a gentleman and a scholar. 
---
I think it‚Äôs because a lot of new players don‚Äôt realize how nice this game‚Äôs community is yet. They‚Äôre just expecting the typical asshats in most online games.
---
Best MMORPG I've ever played. I can just ignore everyone else if I want to. I'm a solo player at heart.
---
Id appreciate it if we were gaurenteed a 3* item for either the queen or completion of the event. Instead of getting a 1 star bs weapon thats not even worth carrying to the vendor. I do like the plans being dropped though
---
Thank god they don‚Äôt have the power glowing ones in the previous fallouts 
---
Why a spoon? Why not an axe or something?
---
They can be the enemies of defend the workshop events at any workshops in higher level regions (basically everything to the west of the savage divide and including the savage divide). I've had them spawn at the munitions factory, at Red Rocket, at The Federal Disposal Site, at Spruce Knob, at Berkeley Springs and The Abandoned Bog Town (There's no way in hell you can get me to pay Caps for all the instruments so I've been taking alot of workshops)... 
---
meant to say gun instead of weapon, my bad
---
I could be wrong about how it's *supposed* to work, but if the intended design of the weapon is that it splits as soon as it starts falling, and spreads in all directions, in an umbrella pattern, from the point of split, then the result would be, if you fire it slightly downwards, or even level, it will split immediately, and at least one of those little warheads will come back towards you, hitting whatever you are standing on. If that is the case, doesn't mean it's broken, it means you aren't using it right (no blame, it's not like it comes with a manual).
---
*If* I'm right, then it *needs* an upward trajectory, regardless of how high you are shooting it from. You need to fire it at enough of an angle so that when it hits the top of it's arc, it is farther away from you then it's umbrella spread pattern.
---
Havnt has any of these issues since last update. 
---
Made a small fortune off Scews and Hunting Rifle ammo. Then Bethesda lowered the drop rate on the latter...
---
Perfect ‚ò∫
---
Okay, so I will use melee build, but could you give me exactly the build that is good?  
---
I am terribly bad at doing builds in any rpg game, so I do not want to waste my points. 
---
*pretends to be shocked*
---
I love guns too much, so I actually never have done a full melee build, so I have no experience with how hard you hit with that build, but looking at those perks, what ridiculous strength numbers are you achieving if you meet every condition?
---
That's why you're going back in time
---
IDK I'm just spitballing here. But maybe Bethesda shouldnt clear the loading screen until I don't know.. the player has loaded in? Call me crazy.
---
Only once when I was desperate. Otherwise I make it into Fertilizer or toss it out when my hoarding starts to break my back.
---
Not sure but there‚Äôs definitely AoE on the shots so I think it works.
---
I‚Äôve heard anti armor doesn‚Äôt on laser weapons tho since it doesn‚Äôt change enemy ER
---
Anti armor and double ammo can‚Äôt occur on the same gun. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt use chems so I have no clue lmao
---
Hasn't this been going on for weeks now?
---
This is akin to finding a bag of money in the woods and taking it home, only to have the Feds kicking in your door ten minutes later because that money was stolen and dropped by some other goon who's running free with the other nine bags of cash.
---
Why doesn't Bethesda just update their item tracking systems, patch the glitch, and then ban the people who are actually duping the items?  
---
Now I'm not saying that OP is innocent, but it's not hard to believe that at least some of the people getting banned for duping weren't actually the ones duping the items...  It's almost as if Bethesda wants to lose what's left of their Fo76 playerbase as they've made so many poor decisions with this title.
---
This is another case of a suggestion actually having unintended positive consequences. 
---
Let's say this gets implemented, as written, and they add an archivist or librarian (as written in the comments) that you can go to to access all the notes and holotapes if you want to go back through them. 
---
1. You really wouldn't have to carry but a fraction of these items, making overall server load for the same number of players at a time less, allowing for more resources elsewhere possibly creating a "fewer bugs overall" effect.
---
2. Allow checking out a copy of a tape or a note in case you need details at a specific time.
---
Rules could be made backend to not allow quest items to be handed over (this already exists, to a point) so you'd never accidentally lose the password for a terminal you needed.
---
Damn, you are secret salty alll over this lmaoo dude you are a complete loser. Byebye game hhahahahhahahahahahahahah.
---
 You are punished for 76 violations:).
---
What about those of us trying to learn mods for Marine/Trapper armor? I‚Äôve killed hundreds of plastic in the last 5 minutes :-/
---
Same problem for a long time.  No search by box number option available.
---
I feel like the SBQs health isn't the problem.  It's a combination of her movements and people not understanding some of the mechanics in place. She takes way more damage on the ground then in flight however she tends not to land much if she is being hit by heavy guns while flying. I have been in small groups where we can kill her no problem by only shooting at her with rifles or ignoring her completely until she lands then unload on her while she is grounded. It's also important to note that some people need to try and clear some of the adds when possible so when she does land everyone can focus on her and not have to switch focus to the scorched Deathclaw trying to eat there face.
---
The best opinion you will ever get about anything in life will always be your own... There is an old adage that says "opinions are like a**holes... everyone has one, and most of them stink"
---
Many enjoy the game and look forward to the upcoming content. Many criticise the game because it isn't their perfect idea of what the game should be. Still others criticize it because of the "bandwagon mentality". Your best bet is give it a go. At least then you will have the best opinion about the game.
---
Looking forward to hear your personal feelings about F76 once you have given it a go! üëç
---
That is hilarious, won't you die in 2 hits to everything though? Running in headfirst with, to my knowledge, little to nothing DR? How do you go about that?
---
What's this grinding you speak of, isn't that an app some people use??
---
Also, what items do you all yearn for? I am quite content with picking up whatever is dropped..... mostly..... I do however, WANT those fluorescent letters though... BADLY!!
---
But I have no caps because I spend it all on plans üòÖ
---
Why not have that spendable faction rep be either Enclave or BOS? It could be part of some sort of automated system for both factions, and would provide an actual reason (other than personal preference) to start having real faction alignment... 
---
My psn is AchillesEGA...add me if you would like to join. If you're able to conquer all of the workshops you will get a quest reward
---
Ghoul slaying weapon plus glow sights perk equals profit 
---
It‚Äôs the server/netcode for sure, it‚Äôs definitely not the game engine. 
---
Just an idea but I thought it wasn't too bad (&amp; probably not terribly hard to implement)
---
My character or me? Lmfaoooo kidding 
---
Yes idiot.
---
50 is it's max level. After that you'll see no further increases.
---
The fallout universe has a mutation that make you jump high but no one ever invented a drill clutch  lol
---
If you did it at level 60 you have a maxed level all rise. It wont go up as you level and you cant redo the quest unless you start a new character 
---
Depends on people's play styles. US combat armor and exp weapons seem to be the most popular 
---
Are... you asking what aspects of the game developers consider outside of pvp??
---
Perks and SPECIAL points allocation are the only things that would boost it
---
Unique weapons do scale to the level first aquired, but only up to 50.
---
 A lvl 50 All Rise is the max.
---
Low health heavy gun build? I'm tuning an unyielding build right now and the only bloodied weapon I've come across is a pipe gun. I swear I've probably sold hundreds of bloodied weapons to vendors in the past.
---
Thanks for your reply! I'm afraid of clowns though so imma let this one pass
---
There are suiciders in 76 I've shot a few to bits already 
---
I was taking on a legendary glowing gulper last night. It did not fight me, just stood there. I would get it almost to 0 health then it would run away and regenerate some health,  continued attacking and almost to 0 health, it runs away and regenerated more health. Basically did this rinse and repeated until its health was full. At that point, I left having wasted close to 500 rounds of 5.56 ammo on it. 
---
A few days ago I logged in after taking a break and was immediately getting sniped across the entire map by a hacker. Wtf. 
---
I apologize, I came in a little hot.  I'm one of the people affected, so I'm happy for any attention we can generate for this issue.  You DO have solid ideas that would probably help alleviate some of this, I hope some devs are paying attention.   
---
Then get on it mr.dev team
---
Huh, I've never come across any.
---
Welch Station. Saw them today.

Cool outfit
---
There are a couple of notes and holotapes at camp venture detailing meeting Maxson. I'm at work right now so I can't confirm if the notes mention a physical meeting (like describing his appearance) so I'm still leaning towards Retconned even though either way it's semantics 
---
Where's the defence crew to blame this problem on dupers or people rushing through the game too quickly?
---
That would be amazingly funny. They just ragdoll off the vertibird, fall to the ground, get back up, and then start charging at you.
---
So what are you? A Keyboard Space Ranger? Keyboard Jockey? Keyboard Ninja? And if not, why would only the Keyboard Cowboys downvote you? Do the other Keyboard ____ all agree with you? What if they are Touchscreen Commandos? Or Voice Interface Taxidermists? It would seem to me that in your very personal appeal for some kind of internet validation that you have managed to ignore a vast number of people who could have been involved in your discussion.  Shameful, really.
---
Thank you. I just bought one from a player vendor and it‚Äôs 179 damage which is stronger than my first one ü§î 
---
Were there any passenger cars in Fallout 4? That'd likely be your answer.
---
Love game. If u a fallout lover ull like this game. But like any game it has issues. 
---
Cause voice sucks, you have to hear other people's lives over a shitty mic, along with heavy breathing and loud eating.
---
No one will ever remember that nerd, but grognak will become a legend! Hope you can find a way to live through nuke zones without PA or hazmat suit. lead lined trapper gear with radiation resist effects, radiation resist perks and radx might be enough. Maybe. ü§∑
---
Problem is that all those are trying to eat your face off, and what if she doesn‚Äôt land at all? 
---
I know that her weak spot is the belly, that‚Äôs where I get most damage done, but still. 
---
And you‚Äôre probably right players are just not wise enough to do the research on the subject.
---
It's becasue yo udrop all the screws adn springs when you take it apart
---
I had to reply to this because I couldn't hold the soup I was eating in my mouth from laughing. That painted a great picture in my head.
---
Build your bed, campfire, stash box, food/water first as a necessity and then build your C.A.M.P. Pay attention as you build as to what items you'll need and save them as you explore. I'm only level 10 and my CAMP is pretty much done and I can repair it 15x over if needed. That's the piece of advice I'd go with : find a spot for your CAMP and slowly explore the surrounding areas in the beginning. 
---
A faction? Cool, more lifeless holotapes and notes to find.
---
What would happen if someone stumbles upon a corpse that has duped loot in it? Would they still get banned? And why, they didn't know that 
---
Wholesale removal of pvp would be a massive loss for Bethesda, it would mean they screwed up horrifically because pvp was a major feature of the game they were talked about at great length.
---
So just keep that in mind, if you want pvp to be removed, you want Bethesda to suffer a failure in one of their core game features.
---
He doesn't look that awesome.
---
90% of the times I have fought her where she didn't lands seemed to be because about 6 people where lighting her up with .50 cals staggering her in the air so she just stayed there and refused to land and just because a bullet sponge 
---
No the heavy combat armor is a separate item from the standard combat armor or the sturdy combat armor. Plans are random (and rare), I believe you might find some on the special vendors (grahm or roaming robot) otherwise you can get pieces from the Watoga High School event monster mash. Best of luck hunting the plains down OP, and let us know if you find them. 
---
1k for all the 5.56?
---
He's an empath by mutation, all these other personalities are comrades who died along side him, and you're stuck with empath mutation! ... No no no that's too brutal. I don't wish empath mutation on anyone 
---
No, I have not done this dick move. I've been victim of it, though. :-P
---
You can definitely move SPECIAL points around after level 50. Every level gives you the option to choose a new perk card or move a point.
---
If it was like a $20 with nobody around to claim it and no identifiers? Sure id pocket it, but if it was an unmarked bag with 1k in it or like some absurd amount of money you bet your ass id call the cops about it.
---
Can you 1500?
---
*facepalm* Well, I‚Äôm not waisting my time on nuking her if players don‚Äôt try to cooperate 
---
&gt; 2 hours of woodfarming
---
??? That would be thousands of wood, are you really using that much?
---
You can get like 100 wood a visit to [Sylvie &amp; Sons loggingcamp](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvie_%26_Sons_logging_camp), and simply server hop to respawn the wood.
---
Basically how things seem right now. Unless you have a large group of friends readily available to join you it's a gamble 
---
So you picked up a duper's items and is surprised you got banned? Why? You picked up duplicated items while you knew they where just by the item count. You deserve this
---
Do it
---
suit of whitespring? u mean jumpsuit?
---
Love this
---
Just got it a few days ago and finding time to play every day. I don't know what it was like before...but it's smooth now. I haven't had any issues on PS4 besides the occasional second of lag in high populated areas but it's barely noticeable. Currently level 10 and loving every minute of it! 
---
Who am I?
---
Thanks!!!
---
Holy... which plants exactly? Are they named ‚Äúpotted‚Äù?
---
I appreciate the reply, I actually found out that the "Front sight ring" does not visually align with the aiming point while firing from the hip or aiming down sights - and that was the only mod I was after. I just don't have the ability to apply any of the mods myself - I was more trying to help the OP with a specific example. 
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Not really looking to spend more than 1k. I'd suggest just waiting im sure someone will offer more caps.
---
I have few, but I‚Äôm strongest one so far, one got banned for a month, he was stronger, but now I am till he comes back, and even he is rarely on, I‚Äôd like people help me beat her on ps4 with me
---
Because it hurts more! 
---
Have you ever taken anything apart? That's exactly how you learn how to make parts for something.

That‚Äôs the joke üòÇ

Several hours?
---
Fast travel to Prickett's Fort in the North, equip the Woodchucker perk, and get over 200 wood from the stack of firewood there.  Hop servers and repeat if needed.
---
Oh I get it. I get jokes.
---
 i do first making a photo, but i m offline now. Anyway i can describe u it: is a green suit with 'caddy' and under 'WitheSpring' written on the back. 
---
General a good idea is to check the average level of players on the map. If they are all of a decent level nuke prime and hope the join if not just farm flux so you didn't waste a nuke. Until they add a looking for group option this is the best we can hope for unless you post to reddit befor you nuke prime
---
It could be repaired to over 100% condition, which increases damage. That or your character has a new mutation or perk that's buffing you. I have also found that my melee damage has generally varied between  patches due to various glitches that can affect you unpredictably. 
---
Can't find you, sent a PM
---
how much do u want for it?
---
I understand Bethesda's objection to players duplicating items, but the only reasonable way to address that problem is to patch out duping and destroy the duped items.
---
If they absolutely must punish players, then penalize the actual duplicators; don't ban people just for possessing duplicated items.
---
It is NOT our responsibility as players to police and enforce the rules of Bethesda's EULA. If they are going to burden players with being cautious of trading for items or finding items which may have been duplicated, then they're effectively outlawing looting and trading, because it's impossible for a player to determine if an item was duplicated.
---
My theory is that their server architecture is so amateurish that they can't actually identify who the dupers are, there isn't a way to identify duped items beyond suspicious quantities, and they can't yet figure out how to actually prevent duping.
---
If they had actually done a beta like they had promised, this an other issues would have been caught prior to release. Instead they did an extremely limited access demo 2 weeks before launch, so now the game is a massive festering dumpster pile, and their solution is to use it as a funeral pyre for sacrificing suspected cheaters.
---
This is not how you fix the game; this is how you lose what little player base you still have.
---
My goodness friend, you could marinade a whale in that salt.
---
I saved up my Atoms and bought the Black Fiisherman's Outfit and love it. I'm an outdoorsman-type build and it goes wonderfully with the living style. On topic - Hold on to it and find the right guy/gal to buy it. Someone playing an outdoorsman/lumberjack will pay extra to have it. 
---
In fallout 2 things like Brahmin and mole rats took reduced damage to the head - used to be ‚Äúall groin shots, all the time‚Äù in the old days, lol
---
What platform?
---
From personal experience turrents are a waist of budget enimies just spawn inside your base or where you don't have a turrent lol 
---
I‚Äôll do that
---
v Curtis v
---
It's amazing how much work this community does for this dev team!

 Great idea right here!!

Good call, I will add it. PC.
---
He showed me the one that looks like topiary in a Nuke.
---
Yeah I got yah. I am not there anymore I just recently moved, but I was there for a couple months. My bad if that was worded weirdly in my last post haha.
---
If you enjoy playing solo you shouldn‚Äôt get it, not until they put out dedicated pvp servers and disabled players slapping damage in the adventure mode. My friends asked me the same question and after i told them how the game worked they walked away. 
---
I said destroy,  not systematically break apart 
---
If you have any perks that help cripple aim for her wings it may help make her land more I believe 
---
Hey guys, I didn't cheat or pick up duped items and I didn't get banned!  
---
I agree, i think bathesda royaly screwed that one up
---
I have a turret protecting my garden and nothing else. Turrets don't work particularly well. 
---
praise him 
---
Mordor? Ooooohhhh mortars
---
Hey np . Feel free to take them and reword it any way you feel , if you're so inclined.  Just wish we had a stickied thread more than anything.  !
---
Never worked for me
---
Keep bulk in stash until ready to sell. 
---
Dupers = TSE damage buffs
---
Also consider this is on a server that has logs. That's akin to walking up to the evidence room of a police station, in front of cops, on camera, and taking a bag of money.
---
Oh my god, does no one in the wasteland have any manners?  Cross your legs!
---
I started a new game yesterday and ran into a bunch of problems. Since they are problems that will be seen by new players, they really ought to be fixed by now. The game crashed before the opening cinematic. The loading screen took ages. The quest markers in the vault wouldn't time out, so I had 3 or 4 telling me to go back. When I got out I found someone had looted everywhere ahead of me, which is only a mild annoyance but makes the game look really boring to a new player. Then it was ok for a while until I met some ghouls. I killed them, but they respawned right in front of me (which, unfortunately, is not unusual). I tried to shoot them, but they took no damage and they ignored me. I took some funny screenshots and carried on. Eventually the server started being slow to respond and I stopped playing.
---
Forgot to write i m on ps4.
---
Turrets tend to mostly just distract intruders while you get a jump to finish them. They take up a lot of budget so make sure to have 2 turrets maximum. 
---
Maybe we still can, or start one.  I'm not super well versed, but I agree that it would help to have all the data somewhere it would do the most good. 
---
bein all sneaky beaky like. 
---
It's hard to figure out what's a bug and what isn't with the queen right now lol
---
Build on the edge of a cliff and never have to worry about enemies spawning behind/in your base again. I've had intruders fall off the side of the mountain and die at my camp. 
---
I leveled a base that was blocking the responder vendor, so I decided to have some fun with the bounty.
---
Dude, assassins sentinel is easilly staggered. There is multiple ways to counter this. If youre going to be mad about something be mad about assassin cavaliers, even that can be beaten though
---
I was gonna say that Empath kinda sucks tho lol
---
This is all super interesting.
---
The factions speculation you put out, if true, might piss off some folks who feel like they're being forced into PvP though. 
---
I can
---
What do you mean "kinda" sucks? Hahaha :p 
---
I kinda wanna rp as a reporter now...
---
Just got 76 a few days ago and fucking love it. Glad I didn't listen to all the hate. 
---
That quest spawned two level 80 scorchbeasts for me, and I played it solo with doo-doo weapons. Good times. 
---
Thank you. This is good to know as I was planning to put 21 of them down in a sort of "Man-O-War" type fortress style.
---
Maps too big.  No thanks.

I appreciated this in FO4, would not in FO76.  If you want to walk, go walk.

&gt; immersive
---
Ok, but this is a video game, they never claimed that "immersive" was one of their design goals as far as I know.
---
I've been holding onto Radstag Stews for the Food/Water replenishing and bonus of Energy Resistance. Can be multi-beneficial in a few tight spots. 
---
thats harsh.
---
Hope they got whats coming to them :).
---
I use a ski sword. Same same.
---
FO4 also had subways. There was no Grafton Monster but they made that.
---
There was a topic yesterday about this with some healthy back and forth.   My opinion is you are a lame ass if you build and place your turret camp in back of the golf club.  Sounds like you were trying to earn XPs legitimately and this happens.  Not cool.

The pink armor is my favorite. Played so much to grind out the Atoms for it.

Only 15 hours left and still not fixed, will the people who participated in the event get the reward once it's fixed?
---
Regional rail station are that small. Stations that I stand on every day are smaller than that inside but a bit bigger outside.
---
Do you think the map is to big for no icons? I could imagine going many game hours searching forever to find anyone. I guess they could have less servers with a bigger pop to avoid that.
---
Got it today from treasure map, around Overseers camp. Maps often have a plans for camp 
---
affirmative

You should, they def offset the balance of a bad situation both  PVE and PVP! I get pretty doped up before any serious fight 
---
I went whitespring turret camp hunting with an orbital strike and my handy dandy explosive Gatling gun after reading this post. Server hopped a few times, no turret camps but I wound up in a nuked whitespring and got a couple hundred pounds of legendaries

Life is magic by Red Robot Labs, but they seem to have disappeared and that game didn't last long so... there's that.
---
I had the SBQ heal to full health when she was down to about 10% last night. Didnt have time to drop her down all over again.
---
why the fuck was this on my google discover cards 
---
Bethesda can you please fix... lmfao
---
Bring back the Y-17 Trauma Override Harness from Old World Blues. those things were creepy as fuck and you can have some in bigger, more armored suits with heavy weapons like the Master Harness.
---
Oh they fired all of us. It's only the marketing team that's left now
---
Yea just noticed that while playing today, its anti armor because it has the mag, its plus 1 agility.
---
Literally just put fallout fours scrapper perk back into the game. Shit was way more useful than the current perk.
---
Why did you pick something up that seemed suspicious off the ground, point is, you stole duped items, probably used said duped items and now you are complaining that Bethesda can't count
---
Still alive and waiting... :)
---
It was a great idea and super useful in fo4. No idea why they decided to nerf it into complete uselessness. 
---
That works providing you have the stash space.  The more immediate issue is that perks that lower item weight only work if that item is on your person. Since I use bandolier, some of my ammo is weightless while I carry it, but if I try to stash it, the weight counts... Same thing with bulk junk.  If I store it it weighs more than it does if I carry it
---
right-o
---
Didn't you say you had a mule account to take things from one place to another, that counts towards the 100k in the past 30 days
---
We have 800 lbs of stash space. It may be time to do some cleaning out if you don't have the space lol
---
I love it when they hit the ground like they're gonna eat me or something. Wish I could get the queen though still working on it. Dont you just get a thrill out of beating a tough enemy?
---
Wasnt the original excuse for having this much shit, a massive amount of play time or am I mandala effecting this scenario? Because now that the reason has changed from extreme grinding to "picked up a supers bag" theres even less reason to doubt Bethesda's actions, coming from a non biased viewpoint.
---
Yes had this experience too and changed my standard out fit to now match! 
---
Zealots cultist dagger, running around with a skeleton mask, assorted armor and no clothes. Friendly to fellow players, deadly to scorched and others alike. Stabby stabby 
---
If you are still alive in a couple hours, a second chameleon will join the hunter! :)
---
I would probably give you stim packs just for not stealing any of my junk. I end up selling any I have when I have more than 20. 
---
But my screws...I NEED MY SCREWS MAAAAAN
