how much you gunna pay for a broken game? "cult of mothman" lmao

This crosses into the same territory as the original holiday bundles back in 2018. Remember when everything came into the Atomic Shop already half price? You can‚Äôt advertise something as a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù when no one is having to pay full price for it. Because the ranger outfits are 1st exclusives, they can‚Äôt be discounted for 1st members. Had they released them to everyone and then given them to 1st members for free they could claim that this was the advertised discount, but they didn‚Äôt.
---
That's awesome dude. The world is enormous so there is endless places to go and sites to see. Just be careful where you go pending your level, the mire and cranberry bog are dangerous for low leveled people. Good thing you got a friend helping you.
---

---
When i started a year ago there wasn't as many people on at the time so I got little to no help. I wasn't used to the whole survival aspect of the game cause I didn't play an previous Fallout's on any mode other than normal. The first like 20 levels was making me pull my hair out but I got used to it and now I'm level 130 and on cruise control lol. I'm on Xbox, am currently offline for a bit tho. Hoping to be back on before Wastelanders comes out.
---
Congrats!
---
I agree. The plan is kinda worthless when you can just buy the mod from the vendors.
---
We‚Äôre just out here trying to scav too man!!
---
I‚Äôve been downvoted because of opinion, but damn why am I getting downvoted because of a fact??? Just trying to help him out so he doesn‚Äôt try and sell it at a high price and people think he‚Äôs an idiot
---
its weird on how they just keep circling that one area..
---
üëçüëç
---
Dispute your charges,  reverse it in your card.   Cite bait and switch, fraud, etc.  Start there. 
---
Good luck!
---
I think I was in game with you a couple times! I‚Äôm not very good at it either but I enjoy the different play styles. My friends don‚Äôt really care for NW so I queue with team fill on mostly and I‚Äôve gotten everything from bush wookies to circle huggers and it‚Äôs always exciting when the team all makes it to the end for a win. Only happened a couple times but it makes me happy
---
He never had anything good for me.
---
Remember the holiday bundles back in 2018, where they were released as already being half off? This is the same thing. No one is paying anything for these items so it is false advertising to claim that these are the discounts promised in their promotional content.
---
I would still prefer a keypad to enter a number, like the one for entering the nuke code
---
Ive always seen them there. Pretty sure i counted 22 one time but idk why they hang there.
---
Man one time my team died and so I was hiding just to try to make it a little longer for the xp and someone walked right by my bush and I got him lol felt so proud of myself and then I died
---
Re-read your post history and re-evaluate your priorities.
---
Not if it says "exclusive. "
---
I missed out on the raider pipboy and the skin for the handmade. Can‚Äôt wait for those to get here
---
Yeah that's where they all hang out. Instead of the server despawning and then having to reload them later they just kind of hang out there.  It's normal game design stuff but most games aren't quite so lazy and put it somewhere you won't see it lol
---
Ill learn his name when he can learn to be easily found.
---
wtf ?
---
I didnt downvote ya brother and also I used the plan, but much appreciated for the information I had no idea üôèüèª
---
Hello. It counts for the possum badges but not for the general achievements.
---
Thanks!
---
It's annoying and often over looked. Switch stone top to dark wood, log out log in and you should have extra space. Just make sure you switch all of it. I also think this is how people end up over budget. If I want to place something new or even replace an item with similar, I have to change all my flooring, relog, make changes, switch flooring back. Awful. I think the mesh flooring may be bugged as well. The budget space is significantly more, maybe even double. Testing needs to be done.
---
Probably a bug.
---
This is false. You can‚Äôt claim that FO1st exclusive cosmetics are ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù. Remember when the holiday bundles were originally released last year? Remember how they were added to the shop already showing half off? Remember how they had to remove the false discount? This is the same thing. Because these items are exclusive to FO1st members, no one is paying a full price for them, therefore they can‚Äôt be advertised as ‚Äúexclusive discounts‚Äù.
---
70% of the people on this sub is here just to downvote so just ignore it. Look at this reply as an example.
---
Base building and looking at other players CAMPs, definitely keeps me interested.
---
You are wrong, the plan is very rare as it only drops from this event, practically it is worthless but to a collector this would be worth alot
---
Lol oh ok that makes sense. Thank you.
---
good prices right there.
---
I don‚Äôt feel like what I said was hard to comprehend.
---
It's a 100% discount!
---
For this reason I am holding onto mine to see what happens.
---
Fine, from a value standpoint I guess a collector might pay a lot for it, but it definitely isn‚Äôt worth that much. Is an autograph from a famous football player worth money? Yes, but in the end it‚Äôs a piece of paper with some marker, other than the money you can get for it or you like the team/player,  it‚Äôs completely worthless
---
There‚Äôs a place in the mire called the Maw (looks like a hole on the map) that you can jump into shallow water in a certain spot around the edge.
---
If you haven't done the watoga mayor for a day quest, get the robots to kill you
---
It will be interesting to see how much of that content revolves around a social element of gameplay and how much caters to the desire for a more classic Fallout experience in that respect. If for example there's some huge group boss battle like the Scorchbeast Queen which can't realistically be beaten by a single player without a radically min/maxed character build and inventory.
---
Anyone who tells me to turn off my mic for their youtube, better get ready to hear the Beatles greatest hits played over the mic.

Guess you'll be unsubscribing from the subreddit, then, huh? Well, it's a shame to lose you, but obviously there's no point in keeping tabs on games you don't play and have no interest in.

And if you took the road that went around behind the quarry from Goosprings, Cazadores üòµ
---
Why are you even here?
---
Pretty much the same here.  I have an Instigating WR Shovel just for that event.  Picked up a Zealot WR Shovel on my alt yesterday too.
---
And even if the event stopped being a thing, let me tell you, the sound effect of whacking someone with a shovel in this game is priceless.
---
Exactly... your ign is on point
---
Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not the way advertising works. If there is no full price then there can‚Äôt be a discount. Bethesda should already know this, I just don‚Äôt think anyone has caused that big of a fuss this time.
---
Read the posters at train stations, those will start 3 separate quest lines. Vault raid is a team thing, doing it solo dont work. There's also a small quest in the sewers under harpers ferry.
---
Read the posters at the railway stations for

You said hungry as well, didn't any grilled radstag did you?

I got a 2* AA33 plasma rifle from a 3* legendary robot. Double checked that showed 2* in pip boy menu. I fast travelled and it became 3* AA3315 version. I have screenshots of this situation
---
[removed]
---
Sweet, I did not know about the posters thank you.
---
I learned real quick about vault 94, I made it two rooms in and died
---
Thanks for saving me the trouble of finding a link. You blame the victims, the exploiters, and Bethesda.
---
They should change deathclaw island into deathclaw gym. They can pump some iron for the New Years and get buff.
---
Frognak's axe.
---
It better fucking be in there.
---
That was brilliant. Definitely a solid idea! :)
---
From what I heard they changed it to give the monthly discounted item, like NCR Ranger outfit skins, for free instead to keep people paying for it.
---
i think we different ideas of lots of buffs many of which are more powerful than perks
---
well fed perk in endurance
---
I got one the other day, too, and was wondering the same thing. Thanks, y‚Äôall!
---
My psycho is not counting either
---
Yes give them to level 4 or lower character. The possible loot for under level 5 is much smaller giving a good chance to get plasma grenade plan. It worked for me!
---
*scrolling...scrolling...scr-* aaand I'm out of VATS

well yes i have un subbed now, im so sorry for having an opinion. please continue to enjoy your broken game (hence every post on this sub), u guys seen the new hack where you lose all of your inventory?  you guys gunna defend that as well? as i said im sorry please continue playing your full price game, for a subscription, to buy more shit that was in fallout 4. fans like you guys are why the gamming industry is the way it is roll on fallout 5
---
Basically, it removes Prime Receiver plans from the pool, which means that the odds of getting a plan that's actually desirable go up.

I want to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and companies. I want universal health care. Trump has destroyed our soft power around the world while hanging over big wins to our enemies. He order our troops to walk away from allies and the prisoners we were guarding because he said we don't get anything out of it..meanwhile he has major investments and debts all over the world. Can't see those taxes though? Come on. How about the horseshit blame shift he's trying to pass over the interference. Strong arming allies to investigate a private business because it hired the son of his challenger? Believing Putin on the world stage over our US intel? Bashing and shitting all over the FBI because they caught all his lackey fucks. Mueller report is the most damning piece of investigative work I've ever witnessed. GOP is protecting Trump like they have something to hide or are just that god damn afraid of losing power. Am I a Republican?
---
Yeah, it's been months, and it's still not counting. Fortunately Psychobuff does work, so at least you're halfway there. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Another thing I've noticed is things like Psychobuff count as two, so in the long run it works out in our favor.
---
Does it mater what size gifts?
---
Sorry man, are you online? I accepted your request. Thanks a bunch
---
üòÇ 
---
Okay, kid. 
---
How about whatever build people enjoy is correct for them?
---
Just because you define ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô as ‚Äòoptimized for X function‚Äô doesn‚Äôt make that the ‚Äòcorrect build‚Äô for other people. 
---
Move along, gatekeeping nitwit.
---
I kind of like that they are there. It's like a cute little nest of drones.
---
Actually I found him randomly without doing the terminal mission and I have my camera but suspicious person mission is in my terminal so the two are not exclusive. It all just depends on how you find him. I'm sure if I ever go to one of the locations my terminal is listing they will disappear from the terminal itself but since I already have the camera I haven't tested this.
---
&gt; u guys seen the new hack where you lose all of your inventory? you guys gunna defend that as well?
---
Of course not. I would never defend the hackers who produced third-party software to interfere with the normal functions of the game that way. But at least this "new" hack was already patched out a week ago and isn't a thing anymore.
---
Most of the time you get ~20-25 fps. A lot of times it does drop to 1-2 fps (quick weapon switch, crafting after a certain time played etc.). Especially the fps drop with crafting is annoying.
---
My main does need around 2-3 seconds to craft a single food item because of the freeze while my twinks can craft 10+ items in the same time.
---
You'll also get a lot of bluescreens in the queen fight which is not fixed till today.
---
After a cargobot spawns, it always travels to that spot. You can age a server that way. The more bots there are, the older the server. You can use this as a benchmark for whether or not you should bother taking over a workshop before the server crashes.
---
Check you PM
---
If the terminal shows the photographer at a location your friend can't fast travel to just server hop and it will change the location where the photographer is at. That's how I got the photographer for one of my alts when they were still low level. I just server hopped a bunch of times until they appeared at the lighthouse.
---
I mean between the fake porcentage and the assuptions that are practicly insulting the people of this sub... you litteraly ask for downvotes...
---
I just don't think there's going to be too many people who are going to be upset enough to say "NO! I **WANTED** to pay atoms for these items! I don't **WANT** them for free!" 
---
I feel like most people are gonna let this one slide since it's actually more generous than what was originally offered.
---
Stingy bois werent so bad after big MT though. Lol.
---
Wait until a hacker steals your pip-boy. 
---
*coming soon to a console near you*
---
Oh ok that‚Äôs very interesting thanks for the information
---
I would love to see all the smart mutants having a conversation. You know... Strong, Fawkes, Lily, Erickson and Grahm. Could proove to be either exceptionnaly cool, or exceptionnaly stupid. Depends on the execution.
---
Cazadores
---
As others have mentioned, it's about avoiding high cost items. If you're really into building and want your place to be as big and detailed as possible, **remove all turrets and crops from your camp**. Neither of them are very useful, as the turrets suck at defense and are currently bugged anyway, and you can take 2m each session to fast travel to a farm and harvest many hours worth of food and water.
---
After that, try to minimize the number of foundation and roof pieces you use. This will be easier if you find a place for your camp that has some preexisting structures, so you don't have to invest so much into buildings. Lights can also add up, but aren't as expensive as they used to be, so you can still use a healthy number. And then make sure you don't waste a lot of decor on power conduits and the like.
---
Imagine playing it on console without DLC for your first time though... ‚Ä† RIP ‚Ä†
---
Everytime I want to give this game a chance, it immediately crashes and I remember why I quit playing in the first place.
---
Get a life
---
Considering the ranger armor outfit was one of the perks  promised, it'd be kinda lame to make you buy different colors for it - especially since the colors are so similar it's very underwhelming even as a free gift.
---
But, thats how i played it. Lol. 
---
I didnt say anything about stingy bois before big MT. Lol.
---
Crave cickets as my dyslexia likes to call them.
---
I saw the mess too but had faith. It was misplaced but I know they'll eventually make It right
---
I server hopped @ wavy Willard‚Äôs.
---
if he wasn‚Äôt there, went inside, killed all the scorched (I‚Äôd guess Santa is there now, too)
---
then hopped and did it again until he showed.  loot the green lockers every hop - I found several bobbleheads there too
---
Betas dont mean the final product tho. Ever.
---
define recently
---
That is not true these days, especially if the beta happens two weeks before launch. It was exactly the same game. Exactly.
---
Elite memberships tend to discount a range of items
---
More details, what cheating do you mean that could could take all your items.
---
Did they empty your stash Also? Was this from the recently patched widely publicised hack.
---
I mean you could claim that about any online game with "builds" that builds aren't really builds because you can have a gimped character without the optimal build.
---
What platform?
---
I list every new plan as 1400. I could be more sophisticated but whatever
---
The one gatekeeping here is you claiming that there aren't correct builds in this game. Every online game with character you build from stats and skills. You can claim there are "no builds" in WoW as well. But only a fool who has never played WoW would agree with that.
---
I get from your post history you are one of those weirdos that can't admit they are wrong and will straight up say whatever you can to make yourself feel you aren't wrong. But you are.
---
If they're offering FO1 member something for less than what the usual price point would be, it's a discount. Whether it's a 10%, or a 100%, it's still discounted. You're trying to argue semantics, and redefine what "discount" means.
---
Just to make sure, when you learn a plan, it doesn't stay in your notes as known  unless you have another unread plan of the same thing. Did you try to craft it?
---
‚ÄúAs a Fallout 1st member, you‚Äôll have access to exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop, so not only are you getting bonus Atoms every month, you‚Äôll get discounts on some sweet items to spend those Atoms on.‚Äù Found[here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce) says otherwise.
---
Also, you can‚Äôt advertise a product as discounted if no one is paying full price. This is just basic consumer rights stuff.
---
Absolutely. Deathclaws should be feared and a major threat. Even without a very OP build, they are very easy to kill.
---
What? You seem to have missed a word somewhere.
---
"I think we different ideas of lots of buffs" what?
---
I'm going by angry turtles food build. That drops the SBQ in under 30 seconds with zero legendaries.
---
What was to original, full price for the NRC ranger outfit then?
---
Traveling to players camps to buy legendarys from their vending machines. I like that most of the time they have what I want. Player vending machines are the best thing about this game.
---
The events are ok, scorched earth and cryptid are fabulous.
---
I have not vault raided because it's not an every hour automatic event. I don't like the requirements as it is.
---
Yawn ü•±
---
The fixed a light bulb in the bathroom over at Watoga high school
---
100% discounted, is *still a discount*. When they eventually offer the ranger skins to non-members do you honestly believe they're going to be free? Because that's the only way your argument would be  valid.
---
This literally happened to me yesterday. Just wanted to die
---
And I love all the sounds all these actions make very satisfying.
---
It is a challenge. Camps already tank performance. Having small items everywhere would be expensive. And camp budget is already pretty laughable.
---
Its a racket to grab more money.but to each his own i guess.
---
I have my level 4 opening all mine and I've probably gotten 20 plasma grenades and quite a few of the rare mounts. You would think I'd be rolling in caps but, well, that wrapping paper.
---
yeah I hear you..but the brand ambassadors/shills will be here shortly, asking why you still play, blame your isp, your router, tell you no one else has these problems,,,,but I hear you
---
The one where you aren‚Äôt playing on PC.
---
Thats happened to me a few times recently but only on my melee character.  Seems to happen when you land a hit thru VATS that shouldnt actually connect.  Like thru a wall or the enemy moves out of range.  
---
If you exit and close the game then relaunch it will go away.
---
And your argument depends on Bethesda eventually releasing the outfits to all players. They haven‚Äôt said they plan on doing that. Until then it is false advertising to call them a discount.
---
Every one of my grenades came from the small "low quality" gifts.
---
The current bugs are long in the tooth. People are getting nostalgic for the old ones to spice up the gaming experience a little.
---
Would rather play fallout 4 than outer world's
---
No no I guess what I‚Äôm after is there were baby deathclaws in the game before??
---
I disagree but but only a little.
---
Outer world's has more replay value than fo4 imo. Everything else we're bros.
---
I just linked it, here it is again genius. Downs the SBQ in under 30 seconds using food buffs and zero legendary items and relies on the fridge.

Buying a multiplayer game built on an easily moddable single player engine from a company notoriously known for their bugs and glitches, and some of the worst types of hacks happen in their multiplayer-only game that focusses on player advancements causing several roadblocks getting in the way. The company charges you $13 a month or $100 a year for private servers just so you can avoid it, and downplays the worst possible hacks that can ruin multiplayer games like Fallout 76.
---
I feel like this shouldn't be surprising coming from Bethesda using a modified version of Fallout 4 to build Fallout 76. I expect this to be downvoted here, but it really shouldn't be surprising anyone of anything that happens with this game. I say this as someone who plays it once a month.
---
LOL there was no sony wide patch 3 days ago. There hasn't been a ps4 patch in the last 6 weeks.
---
Excellent or EGGselent
---
The free items are the discount.
---
right. the equivalent of a large/med/small gift. Enable "Pharmacist" and you get 2x gifts too (don't know why).  You craft them at a tinker's bench.
---
send a friend request
---
This is wrong. I‚Äôm too tired to explain why. Maybe someone else will come along and give enough of a shit to show you why.
---
depends on the level. Im level 115 and i can kill a level 21 deathclaw easy. However i still cant kill the murelock kings in the cave and they take me out in 5 or 6 hits when i am level 115 and they are only 50 which makes no sense. This game has a lot of issues.
---
You want zee lonnnng range scope.  However that also increases the AP cost.  There's also a ton of misinformation about AP cost in VATS so make you experiment to sort the BS from the truth.  And for killing SBs you want to conc-fire focus on their noggin not their wings.
---
Are you on pc? I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs possible, you get maybe 700 when you win a round. Are you killing 20 people and winning every round lol?
---
I have it.  And i dont really like it.  Its like they crammed FO:NV, Bioshock, Borderlands and Destiny into one game with 10 times the loading screens.
---
That's what you think it'd be used for but it's used a marketing tool these days. "Pre-order and get exclusive access to the BETA!"
---
You have to craft gifts using the Tinker‚Äôs workbench, but then, yes, you receive a random assortment of items.
---
You buy the gift wrap, then craft it at a tinker's workbench into a "handmade holiday gift", then open it &amp; get similar items as you would from killing a legendary / santatron. And for some reason the chemist perk will double the number of gifts you can craft.   
---
I've periodically been crafting them to give away cuz they seem like a more reliable random present for a person with an unknown build / playstyle than most of the other items I usually drop...
---
Fallout and destiny have so many more loading screens
---
also another question,  i know the small gifts give power armor pieces plans, would the larger ones gives a better chance of obtaining them? im tryna get them all
---
I'd like to be able to put a buy order into my vendor, you know like wanted to buy, 10,000 5.56 1 cap ea
---
pretty sure cause it counts as an aid item
---
Bugs, fixes, events, more bugs, some more fixes
---
Yeah, singular nests can be found some randomly but there is no Quarry or Deathclaw cave like FO3 or NV where you can find around a dozen or more. Plus they're slower have less armor and no longer have the leap attack so are far less threatening.
---
Sorry, I shouldn‚Äôt say you opinion is wrong, but rather that it doesn‚Äôt matter what your opinion is. If your opinion is factually wrong you are still entitled to it, it just doesn‚Äôt change the facts of the situation.
---
Edit: lol last comment didn‚Äôt go through so now I look dumb. I had said that your opinion was wrong and wasn‚Äôt supported by the facts.
---
It's a mid core rpg that Is 20 hours short
---
Oh no, that's awful! I've also been blue screening a lot on PS4. I submit the "report a problem" each time it happens, but so far I've thankfully managed to avoid losing any items. But I should probably start submitting actual bug reports because it's not clear to me whether that method submits directly to bethesda vs to playstation.   
---
I unfortunately don't have the sloth plan yet but feel free to add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero) and I will get you another large present. And potentially some luck-related drug or food too, although I'm not sure whether they help get better plans? &lt;3

Yep. This game is a steaming pile of shit over a year after launch, what else is new?
---
Very nice, found one myself today and learned it.
---
The frat letters are pretty big but you have to get fairly creative to make use of all the characters.
---
Ayyyy I might even give you a couple presents from the holiday event for your troubles! I won't be online until after 9 PST tho. If you're still out gifting I'll make sure to swing by! I'll send you a message on live if you're still on by then. If not no biggie, I just have to say thank you for making a bunch of people happy, and for being someone who makes the community look good!
---
Fallout 1st itself is already shady. You're surprised?
---
And of course, this is the only viable build in the game, and everyone that isn‚Äôt a moron is using it.
---
You sure about that, Mr. PC?
---
Where did I say it was the only build? You keep putting words in my mouth to argue against because you can't argue against what I'm actually saying. It is kind of flattering how badly you are doing yet continue to try to prove your already disproved comment.
---
[deleted]
---
Seeing as I have a ps4 pro and psvr that I play every day? Yup, I'm positive there have been no patches in at least the last month.
---
No
---
Hate that gamemode
---
That‚Äôs what is unique about these items. I‚Äôve already gifted over 60 of them to people tonight.
---
Cool story. 
---
9/10 would read again.
---
&gt; Bethesda was forced to refund the game to certain people because it was deemed a faulty product. 
---
No, Zenimax was forced to refund people because they asked for one and Zenimax said "we don't give refunds".
---
Oh, so it‚Äôs not the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô build?  
---
Which one is the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô build then?
---
Define ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô.
---
This happened before survival mode tho. So there is stuff to argue about.
---
Unless you're a melee build killing them in the air is not an issue with a good build.  OP just wants to make something that's meant to be difficult, easy.  Where's the point in that.
---
Says the dude that thinks that sony released a patch on christmas when there was no need to hotfix anything at the time. Want to make more things up to try to defend your disproved comment?
---
Collect plans from gameplay, don‚Äôt learn them immediately. 
---
When you have a bunch to learn cleanly leave the server and close the game. Allowing the client to synchronise with the server
---
Reload the game and enjoy your plans.
---
Before it was even announced
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm not so sure I wanna go back anytime soon though. At least not without some heavier firepower.
---
Builds are designed to maximize the characters abilities. There is zero ability that good with salt enhances that can't be enhanced with the fridge and allow you to include 3 more perk levels into Luck which is the only perk tree really that has an abundance of good perks.
---
So the loss of 3 perk spots in the best stat is a MAJOR loss for ANY build.
---
Its..its just a little..alright? No big thing! Aint no reason ta get upset ova here!
---
this may sound dumb ass hell. but 90% of servers (atleast on pc) never has more than 15 players one them. perhaps make servers smaller because they are never full anyway? I would think one or two players missing from a server would make plenty of room for this sorta stuff
---
I don't know about currently, but there have been MANY building bugs in the past where items were taking up more budget space than they should've been. It never hurts to scrap the whole thing periodically and start over, cuz it seems like new updates often bring mysterious new building bugs which can be difficult to pin down.   
---
I didn't originally start building camps around in-game content in order to have more available budget, I just thought it was fun. But some of the structures I built around (exa: monorail, cabins, empty houses) provided walls that could not be destroyed AND a significantly bigger budget, so that was a win-in.   
---
Also, there are some locations (caves, partly or entirely surrounded by water, etc) where you can use the environment as protection rather than relying on the turrets which are buggy &amp; often not as effective as they could be even when they seem "perfectly" placed ;(  
---
I tend to go the route of relatively minimal defense and putting all the items which are "expensive" to repair really high off the ground &amp; just accepting that I'll do minimal repairs each time I return to my camp.
---
Where did I say they released a patch on Christmas?  Stop putting words in my mouth.
---
I have only handcrafted two High Quality Gifts, and I‚Äôm not certain what was in them as I have them as gifts to another player. Sorry, I‚Äôm not sure on the answer. On the gifts that the Santatrons find or found on the Holiday Scorched, the quality (term used loosely) grows from small to large, so I‚Äôm assuming the Large give better quality items.
---
Too true, haven't planted any for a while though. Plenty of great harvesting sites around and haven't needed to grow my own.
---
This is a much appreciated gift. Are you still doing the giveaway, or will you do another tomorrow? Just seeing if I missed the opportunity? Thanks again for your kindness.
---
You are the one saying that the post that says they haven't been able to play the game for 3 days, which means if the patch put out by sony that would put it on christmas. 
---
You didn't even read what you are trying to deny. This is hilarious how bad you are at this.
---
Its chemist that doubles it.
---
Is it not marked as an atom item?
---
Come find out! (Hint: no it‚Äôs a regular item)
---
Also please, when something returns, don't have it only in a bundle - I wanted the little blue generators that are silent, but not the entire bundle they were in for 1500 atoms or whatever it was.
---
Tbh they could take away all your benefits and I feel you guys so would still pay.
---
Y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt have to do this is the game wasn‚Äôt still in beta phase
---
yeah i played it, twice, in less than 50 hours. i ran into a few game breaking bugs and was generally unimpressed. i have no idea why people hyped it as a fallout killer type game. at best its like KOTOR but shittier. thank fuck i only spent $1 on it with gamespass
---
Aim for the brain :)   I use a heavy hitting prime rifle just for the SBs and a handmade for the regular scorched.  The biggest problem I have is the stupid weapon switching bug that randomly picks shit in my inventory to hand me.
---
VATS is SB killing on easy mode.  In 20 mins I can clear every fissure.
---
Zero ability?  üòÇ 
---
The ability to keep food viable for longer (ten times as long compared to only twice as long). This in turn reduces the time needed to spend gathering &amp; crafting the food.  It also means that same food is immediately available and you avoid having to return to base to ‚Äòrefill‚Äô.  And for any builds that use food buffs, that makes a huge difference, bud. 
---
Food avoids spoilage five times longer.
---
You have the food on you and available to use, not stored at home. 
---
Less time spent on gathering/crafting. 
---
More time spent on acquiring other resources of greater value. 
---
And for someone that already has a powerfully viable build that can one-shot every non SB enemy and doesn‚Äôt need those extra 3 perk slots, that time savings translates into more loot, more XP and more caps.
---
But, hey, if you need to dedicate all those perk points to make your build effective, I can see why you‚Äôd be a naysayer. 
---
Some of us are more efficient.
---
No, I asked you a clarifying question. That wasn‚Äôt a statement.
---
Try a little reading comprehension.
---
Thanks.
---
No offense, but you basically should have known after everything that's happened by this point that you were throwing your money away. That doesn't mean Bethesda isn't 100% responsible for fraud or misrepresentation, but exactly where have you been for the past 1.25 years?
---
Thank you for the positive vibes. üëç
---
Structured better than Fallout 76s coding.

It would be easier for you to learn if you look it up on youtube. It would be hard for me to explain here.

Sry ps4 üôà. Are there pics of this?
---
I get to top 5 every round. And no Xbox.
---
ROFL, you can get all those from the fridge and the added 40% slower degradation is far inferior to almost all the other perks in luck such as the VATS and crit perks. those will add much more over having to waste 3 perks just to slow food degradation.
---
Also why would they have to travel back to their camp? Just drop the tent and grab it out of the tent. You can drop them anywhere. So once again you are making up reasons why it isn't an issue but you have to ignore half the games functions for your reasoning to stand any muster.
---
I‚Äôll be on for quite a while tonight!
---
It just works.
---
Yeah hold on let me take a pic and then upload it to imgur then post the link here. Brb
---
You claimed that the reason that person started crashing three days ago was due to a sony patch they put out. Sony didn't put a patch out 3 days ago as that was christmas...
---
I think they have a lot of bug fixes, including those from launch, attached to the Wastelanders build of the game.
---
Missed that my bad and it's all good no worries
---
You da man
---
It was a side character, he was farming nuke zones when I was using it and he avoided most enemies without a problem. There is always the problem of other people getting you spotted so you need to make sure to position yourself correctly. Radiation is your one weakness in wood and that's why I say look for radiation resistance in your legendary pieces or at least rock radshield/rad-x diluted. I never took that character out to the queen since I always play with friends who are casuals.
---
Oh!  So you need to also pay for the FO1st membership as well to make using the fridge viable. 
---
So, your ‚Äòcorrect build‚Äô involves spending extra money on convenience items instead of playing the base version of the game. 
---
Thanks for the clarification. Does your correct build also rely on repair kits, too?
---
People are still having issues with their weapons losing stars again. So that is already back again.
---

Boom! Happy Holidays!
---
Lmao not sure why that got flagged. I swear it‚Äôs safe.
---
I‚Äôm still on!
---
 Is 100% off an original price a discount, or not?
---
That's a rhetorical question, because arguing 100% discount, isn't a discount, is about as wrong as it can get.
---
Aw shit. That actually looks sick
---
&gt;Oh! So you need to also pay for the FO1st membership as well to make using the fridge viable.
---
&gt;So, your ‚Äòcorrect build‚Äô involves spending extra money on convenience items instead of playing the base version of the game. 
---
I mean the game is p2w so why not blow some cash on it to have a major advantage over others? It is no different than the people who buy legendaries on ebay. If you got money to spend, who cares how you spend it.
---
I mean hell go look at any other online game with p2w mechanics, the builds all require them in those games as well. It is literally the point of the p2w convenience items, to make them where end game players have to pay to compete with those other players who pay for the advantages as well.
---
I wish you were on Xbox so I could share the wealth! Cheers and Happy Holidays!
---
Fun isn‚Äôt it
---
Can I give you any ammo or anything for your kindness
---
True enough but it is worth doing as a precaution.
---
No I didn‚Äôt. I asked a question. 
---
You need to read that again.
---
The discount is on atoms with your month purchase.
---
It‚Äôs cheaper to get fo1st than it is to buy atoms in any form.
---
Okay, then I answered your question. You still going to claim the crashing that started 3 days ago for them and the numerous others in that thread was from a sony patch they released on christmas?
---
I lost my ultracite to a blue screen
---
What else do you expect from this shit company? :D How many more times will they have to lie and screw you people over for you all to start seeing them for what they are - fucking incompetent scum of the gaming industry.
---
Fake news
---
It wouldn't be pretty lame because they never promised reskins in the first place.  
---
They sold people one specific version of the ranger armor and that's exactly what people got.  
---
This is the kind of attitude that forced Bethesda to make the reskins free in the first place.  Every time Bethesda has released an outfit and later released a recolored version there has NEVER been an instance of people getting that new version for free or even discounted for owning the original, but 1st people whined enough and Bethesda was afraid enough because of the backlash against 1st that they gave in and gave people something for free that they never advertised as a feature.
---
**Translation:** *‚ÄôI can‚Äôt PvP (as admitted in another thread),  and rely on pay-to-win to be viable in PVE, and I also admit to using an illegitimate service I didn‚Äôt pay for.‚Äô*
---
Thanks, kid. That was more than I needed.
---
Was more of a question of surprise than actual curiosity. I found a way to stack the prefab stairs on each other to create a stair tower the other day. Made a cool 5 story apartment building.
---
Nothing but complaints from you people. You get a good amount of atoms, scrap box with no bottom, and a nice tent. Quit bitching and play the damn game.
---
That sounds really cool
---
frying pan melee weapon
---
that's good people like you think that's fake news ;) check out on Facebook and you can find the glitch. 
---
But you cant dupe Armor, Weapons, Ammo etc. only Aid Items like Stims, Stealth Boys, Food
---
Where did I ever claim that?  I‚Äôd have to have done that already to be ‚Äòstill going‚Äô. 
---
Wow.  Grasping at straws.
---
I don't pvp in this game because it is overrun with hackers. I pvp in plenty of other games that have actual anticheat software. Hell, I was on one of the top 2's team on my WoW server with my buddy running pally shaman.
---
Want to keep making more shit up boy?
---
They do have the attack where they attempt to bite your head off &amp; gore you with their horns.  That move does enough damage to almost 1 shot me and my block reflects enough damage that I kill it from 3/4ths of it's hp.  Rare as hell when they do it though.
---
Are you going to stop paying for the service OP? They haven't delivered on what they promised. Seems reasonable.
---
So then are you going to backtrack on your claim about the "sony wide patch" causing the crashes?
---
Damn, your a a persistent little shill. You keep arguing like you actually have the facts correct or something.
---
I‚Äôm not your teacher, I‚Äôm not your tutor, I‚Äôm not you financial advisor. If you want to understand this and why you are wrong, go ask someone who has to give you an answer to get a paycheck. I‚Äôm not interested in going around in a circle of denial and straight up ignorance.
---
Thanks for the info
---
That Gun from New Vegas, the Tesla Cannon from Fallout 3, and the oldschool Wattz 2000 laser rifle.
---
I would love to see the recharger rifle make a comeback along with a rework to the chainsaw so that it works like the ones from New Vegas and has legendary capability.
---
Yes we have it, but it doesn't work this way.
---
I didn‚Äôt make up anything. 
---
I said you can‚Äôt PVP in **this game**. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say *why*. 
---
Relax, sweetheart.  Give that jaw a rest. 
---
My Fishing skill is already 600.
---
Tesla Cannon from Fallout 3, being a Heavy Weapons guy that I am, I feel it'd be satisfying af to blast enemies in the face with a bolt of energy.
---
(PS: Bethesda, If you make the Tesla Cannon anything but a heavy weapon, i will come for you. :\^ )
---
Check what out on facebook? I've seen nothing on any of the big trade groups.
---
There it is, you don't have any valid points, so you start with the rediculous "shill" accusations. You're wrong. I was kindly pointing that out, and you start name calling. You should thank me for wasting my time doing so.
---
No, you must be online
---
Why would I want to pvp in a game overrun with hackers? Sounds like you are just a hacker salty that pretty much the only people who still play NW are other hackers.
---
I want Vault 77's Puppet Man's Vault Boy Puppet...  with sound effects of maniacal giggling as it basically destroys your enemies.
---
Thank you for the information!
---
Something to learn about online video games: people are immensely stupid. They either can‚Äôt read, or can, and just don‚Äôt give a fuck.
---
nobody gives a shit about your camp rules, to them you just some person thats taking up loot and space
---
Many WW1 and WW2 era weapons would be excellent candidates as they would be pre-divergence weapons and already have established lore in 1/2/tactics... even though those three games take place many, many, many years after Vault 76 opens.
---
You're right... i'm a salty liar without a life and human friends... i delete this post and go to sleep.. it's 03:21 am in my Country
---
Happened to me twice and I only tried to launch a nuke 4 times. 50/50 shot of being successful at launching nukes. Its why I haven't launched a nuke in months and never will try again. To those who launch nukes, I love and appreciate your bravery.
---
It's mindless. I can play it while listening to YouTube or a podcast or whatnot in the background. It doesn't require a lot of my attention. That can be good or bad, because there's so little to do you don't have to focus so much. But for me I like it. I don't want all games to be like that, but that's what 76 is and I recognize that and play it in that way.
---
Just got your 2 accounts reported for dupes btw. You really are a smart one, not even using a fresh reddit account. Ffs
---
You said check out facebook and I said where... you couldn't give an answer. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Same problem. I regret buying it.
---
How can I backtrack when I never made that claim?
---
Asking ‚ÄòWas X the cause?‚Äô is not the same as stating ‚ÄòX was the cause.‚Äô
---
See, the first one is a question.  The second is a statement. 
---
A question isn‚Äôt a claim. It‚Äôs an inquiry. 
---
Sorry, I can‚Äôt keep this up. Teaching you the rules of the English language isn‚Äôt in my job description. Go find a tutor, kid.
---
Truer words have never been spoken. It is remarkable that some of the people who play online are able to feed themselves, it is shocking.
---
I'm on a cliff. The only things that spawn there are  mongrel dogs on rare occasions.
---
Hi! This is so kind of you! I also play NW just by hiding in bushes but didn‚Äôt have time to commit past the wreathes and presents. Still have anything left? I‚Äôm going to be on in about an hour and would love some and would be happy to trade if I have anything you‚Äôre interested in üôÇ
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be on! Just message me on here or on Xbox and I‚Äôll send an invite.
---
?
---
Originally I added rules to the walls of my camp to give it more personality. Now i think people are just purposefully being dicks about it.
---
You asked what you considered a rhetorical question which is why you followed it up with answering it yourself trying to act smug about something you're wrong about.
---
Here is where you did it boy:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/egpbcn/a_thought_on_the_faction_pvp_possibly_coming_with/fcb6d1d/
---
You left your posts on trade subs with your 2 igns?
---
This is the only game where I would have to log out before using cool things just in case it crashes out and I lose them. Unacceptable.
---
Oh, now it‚Äôs ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt *want* to PvP‚Äô. 
---
Nah, I‚Äôm just laughing at how wound up you got when someone told you that you ca it decide what is ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô for a build. 
---
You can cite what is the best setup for DPS or survivability or level advancement, and so on. 
---
But ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô build overall?  Heh. No. 
---
I know this may upset you, but... not everyone wants to play this game the way that you want to play this game. 
---
Shocking, I know. But you‚Äôll get over it. 
---
üòÇ
---
Another thing you should know is that there is a 5 minute grace period for your friends when the last person who has Fallout 1st logs off. Meaning, as long as 1 person on the private server has the subscription, the server will stay up.
---
Ok well that makes more sense. And sounds better than the original complaint? So, that seems unlikely actually.
---
Yeah, where did I say "I couldn't" pvp? Oh right I didn't, I've said from the get go I don't pvp due to the hackers in this game. There is no point unless you yourself are also hacking. 
---
Keep trying boy, I love watching you struggle to try to save face.
---
 I have stuffed hundreds of things into it. Whole sets of nice armour, Legendaries, at least 8 now and all kinds of nice stuff, a built Handmade today. ;) 
---
 Never lost a thing. Its so nice to use my high level's crafting ability, so my lower level chars, all above 60 now, can just learn what they need. He can give them the rest.

Yeah, that‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt be FO76 side, son.

What‚Äôs wrong with that?  
---
You‚Äôre confusing hypothetical with rhetorical. 
---
But keep dancing. I love every minute of it.
---
Doubt it. Unarmed weapons are already extremely strong.
---
&gt;Probably a lot. I see survival tents and people with scrap boxes in their CAMPs everywhere. 
---
Literally every SBQ fight these days looks like a god damned campground. Once people realized the tents were indestructible people started throwing them down around V9 and the heavy gunners stand on top to avoid getting nibbled on by mole rats and shit.
---
Ignoring the fact you changed it 15 minutes ago? You realize it shows the time you edit it a post right? LMFAO
---
He's right, though. No one gives a shit about your rules in even the slightest way, even if they're fair and sensible. The internet is the internet. People will be asshats whether or not it benefits them.
---
Although not really common anymore, people used to blow your base up entirely just because they could and because it meant you had to use resources to repair/rebuild it.
---
We need more WW2 Weapons!
---
You were in the trade subreddits tryimg to trade. With your 2 accounts. Since you are saying you have duped over 800 stealthboys, you have been reported on both accounts for exploits.
---
This game will get good coverage a while after Bethesda can eventually figure out how to patch a game without embarrassingly reintroducing bugs or creating new bugs that can be found within 10 minutes of actually playing the game regularly.   There‚Äôs nothing to defend from their side other than to keep silent or say as little as possible when something really hits the news wire like the pc hack recently.  You should start by first calling out Bethesda on all the stuff they can‚Äôt seem to fix or rebreak between patches, then much later worry about ‚Äòbad press‚Äô.
---
And I love watching you get your panties twisted easier and faster than a drunk prom queen in Minnesota. 
---
It‚Äôs so cute how just a simple choice of words sparks so much impotent rage within you. 
---
It‚Äôs been fun, son. And while some black men might be bothered by you using the word ‚Äòboy‚Äô, I‚Äôll just laugh at how easily you got riled up.
---
That's true, but if it were not free I personally wouldn't have bought it in the first place since I don't like recolored items. But if people do, that's fine. It's just my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs not name calling, it‚Äôs describing an action. My points are completely valid, you just refuse to accept that Bethesda has done anything wrong in the way they advertised this feature, thus you are shilling for them. I know it doesn‚Äôt fit exactly to what you are doing because I highly doubt you are getting paid, but it‚Äôs close enough.
---
Basic advertising will tell you that you can‚Äôt discount something if it was never a full price to begin with. If you were correct then the re-color and the new armored variant of the NRC should go to a set price once they are no longer available to unlock for free through just subscribing. This is still kind of shady because then it is no longer a discounted item for players who subscribe later.
---
Or, Bethesda has to release them to all players at a higher value than they were offered to FO1st members. This seems very unlikely since they also advertised these as exclusive items for members. (If you‚Äôre keeping track this option would also be false advertising since they said it would be exclusive to first members)
---
You can‚Äôt say that something given as a incentive to join a subscription service is given at a 100% discount. You have to either release it at a full price before, during, or after it is offered for free. If you don‚Äôt, it‚Äòs just an exclusive unlockable item.
---
Oh, you mean for clarification sake?  That was for your benefit. 
---
But I love how you dance for me. 
---
Do it more slowly this time. Daddy likes to watch.
---
Nobody loiters in my camp. They just break into my Santatron. I'd love for my missle turrets to help out there.
---
It's just the fact that just to spite you their willing to waste half a hour of their lives just because.
---
Same. Had to lock up mine in a shed with my generators. Have to go through the roof just so people dont steal from me
---
In addition to the tips about dumping your turrets, lighted letters, and crops, there's also a glitch whereby you can get additional building budget. It's not hard to do, so if you're seeing camps with a lot of stuff in them, that's likely how.
---
Trust me, I totally agree with you. But you can't really expect otherwise.
---
I like the hunt for better and better gear, replacing each armor piece or a nice 2* for a better 3* legendary. 
---
 I enjoy trading and making caps by picking up deals that I find on decent legendaries then tricking them out with all the best mods and reselling for profit. 
---
I enjoy hosting players at my camp and offering gifts and being nice to people. I have been playing since beta and my play style/strategies get me more than id ever need so I share it in hopes players stick with the game. 
---
Making friends and new allies is always fun in a game like this too. I've always thought faction wars for control of the map would be a cool concept for this game.
---
You think I'm upset? You must be projecting, I'm having a good laugh to see how far I can make you go. You just keep being the good little doggy and follow along while I lead you by your nose down your own ignorance of comments.
---
Sure seems you are the one with their panties in a twist editing comments 45 minutes later to try to change what you said. Seems you are the one with their dander up, as I don't give enough of a shit about this conversation to go back and edit things to try to "win". I'll stick with laughing at you and replying while continuing to watch The grand tour with my wife.
---
So true. This is odd. I play the game almost daily and what you mention that's not acceptable. I've stopped complaining because it's pointless. But We all should complain. Instead, I look and say "Yeah that's normal" and carry on. Avoiding many things in the game because I know what to expect. Yeah I put big letters in my camp saying "BETHESDA SUCKS" on an empty wall with 2 cardboard cutouts on each side pointing towards it to make sure everyone see's it. But aside from that I expect the experience to be shit. So I avoid the shit. Because this is a shit game made by a company who doesn't give a fuck. If I may be blunt. I apologize. I'm not a gamer. But since the day I played New Vegas I came to love Fallout. Its the only game I play and it sucks it's so continually broken. It's an amazing premise and when done correctly this has the opportunity to be an amazing game. It sucks to expect and live with pure shit. This is my rant I guess. Good to let it out sometimes. I'm up voting you Sir. You speak the truth.
---
If you get to top 5, you only get, at the most 500 xp.
---
No, because it isn't an actual server. Think more like GTA V private instance. It's just a separate instance that you can go to, and invite people to, that anyone on your friends list can join without  invite as well.
---
That was a joke.. i dont have friends and i have post fake news for some answers from other humans.. and which 2 Accounts? and i dont have duped 800 Stealth Boys, i have never duped anything but if i found a dupe glitch i would dupe some stuff for me. No Weapons, no Armor because on the Market are too much good duped Items already and i dont like this.
---
Well report me for nothing.. i'm just a 18 years old bastard without a life. Do it human.. report me.
---
I go to sleep right now, my eyes are tired..
---
You edited it to make it look like a question 45 minutes later, which happened to coincide with me pointing out you were wrong about any sony patches.
---
But keep trying, you editing things to try to save face shows how important this random internet forum is to you. LOL
---
What it really makes me wonder though is why everyone expects this game to get better when most of its problems lie within the community itself. Hackers.exploiters,asshats,etc.
---
The best and easiest thing you can do for yourself in this game is to turn down the volume for footsteps.
---
Sure thing, kid. That must be the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô way to do it.  You care enough to go in and pull the old versions and keep trying to win an argument that‚Äôs based solely on ‚Äòopinion‚Äô. 
---
I don‚Äôt even care what system issues affected PS4. That wasn‚Äôt even the point of me commenting in here... but you flinched just like I expected.  
---
Keep squirming, gatekeeping trog.
---
It‚Äôs been amusing as hell. 
---
We‚Äôll be watching your career with great interest.
---
Aww, boo hoo. My little buddy still doesn‚Äôt get it. 
---
Ask your wife. She‚Äôll probably be able to explain it to you in monosyllabic words. 
---
There is no final product for many games these days. They update the games for years. Fortnite was saying it is in beta while being the number one game in the world. I have an idle game I have been playing in beta for over 2 years.
---
That being said, the F76 beta was more of a real beta -- let people play test and then have devs work on what they find. Regardless. If someone wasn't satisfied with beta, it would have been naive to count on the game being vastly improved in one month.
---
No, the greatest Christmas present would be them finally figuring out that hiding features which should've already been implemented at launch (e.g. bottomless storage for scrap or even just the ability to play by yourself in a private game.. did everyone forget how they promised that?) behind a $13/mo or $100/yr SUBSCRIPTION PAYWALL was a slap in the face to every fallout fan and should (at the VERY LEAST) be gotten rid of. As if I'm gonna keep playing a game that finally offers a solution to their inventory micro-management simulator if I'll just indefinitely pay them money like it's a Netflix or Hulu subscription. Ridiculous.
---
Uh huh, keep projecting. LMAO 
---
I didn't pull up any "old versions" I don't need to, as reddit itself shows when the edit is done. So not only do you not know how the game runs on the ps4 you also don't even know how this website works.
---
Is there anything you aren't completely wrong about?
---
Yep. I‚Äôve started playing Paladins a lot recently, and it‚Äôs honestly concerning how many people flank with tank characters, and how many people play in the back lines when they‚Äôre playing flankers. It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt understand what character they‚Äôre playing.
---
Shhh they‚Äôll just nerf Iron fist by 60% and add in 2 more 3 level perk cards!
---
A beta is sufficient to decide to cancel a preorder and wait to see what others say about release build. It is a very helpful data point. When you preorder, you are giving the dev the benefit of the doubt. If the beta feels shoddy, they should lose the benefit of the doubt.
---
I killed 2 of the Lvl 91's outside of Watoga yesterday with a bloodied pipe bolt-action rifle with .38s - i wasn't even half-bloody -so I would agree that they're a bit weak.
---
Good boy, keep following along and showing how important this is to you. I'll keep laughing at how you've been wrong about literally everything you've claimed in the conversations we've been having.
---
I'll keep wasting your time while we laugh at you continuing to be led along your own ignorant comments.
---
Oh, but then how do you know what I said before?
---
All I did was correct a typo. For clarity sake. 
---
Why does that upset you so much?
---
Get ready to sell some booze. You‚Äôre gonna have a lot.
---
Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game?
---
You even dont need to equip the base version to be able to do around 6 or 7 times the dps of any other build in mp.
---
And other than the commondo sneak builds which are 100% useless in mp but at least 4 times as expansive you can play solo and mp the same way.
---
I run the same build but use a TSAA hunting rifle chambered in .50 as my main sniping weapon I‚Äôve got an executionersTS lever action that I‚Äôve been thinking about using. What‚Äôs your take on a lever over a hunting rifle? I like the rifle for the ease of making more ammo, but the fire rate is way better on the lever
---
another option is to do something about it with turrets and/or locked doors instead of putting letters on your walls 
---

Is it wrong to want to make my camp a bit different. It's nice to look at it instead of just a blank wall

Because I had the comment still open in another tab. So edits don't show up unless you refresh that page. So when I copied the link in this thread it was still showing the original comment you made prior to editing it.

Do you not know how chrome or firefox works either? Jesus how do you even tie your shoes in the morning?

Understatement of year!
---
From what I heard, which may be wrong since I don't have FO 1st, the change was because people complained when they found out the "discounts" would be on items exclusive to FO 1st members in the first place. So there was no "normal" price, and they complained they'd just be spending half the monthly atoms on an item only they could get, rather than it being a discount.
---
Oh, dear. You seem to think your opinion matters to me. 
---
Clearly you haven‚Äôt been following along. 
---
Your opinion on ‚Äòcorrect builds‚Äô didn‚Äôt matter to me at the beginning.  Why would any other opinion you have be any different?
---
The fact that you‚Äôve ever thought your opinion mattered to me is kind of sad, son. 
---
You‚Äôre just not that important. At all. To anyone.

I gave up on Outer Worlds while exploring Monarch.  The game is far too bound up in story, to the point where it began to feel like a choose-your-own-adventure book.  If you're going to write that kind of game, the story should be more than a collection of strung together tropes.  The characters who weren't forgettable seemed to have been lifted from other games.  Phineas Welles came across to me as a sober version of Far Cry 3's Dr. Earnhardt.
---
The combat began to feel repetitive very early quickly.  Weaponry was interesting at first, but soon you're bogged down in dozens of choices with only incremental improvements.  I did like the weapon/armor modding system, that's where I spent most of the money I earned.  The game also has something like legendary pieces, but they never seemed as good as the stuff I'd mod.  
---
Regardless, you're stymied by the menu system.  Equipping yourself and companions becomes a chore.  You want to juggle armor between your team; every time you select a different person, the menu switches from armor to whatever the default is.  While I don't recall the exact method (maybe mouse hover), the description of a weapon or armor piece would be wrong; I recall resorting the menu would fix it.  It was frustrating as hell, but it's been about 2 months since I've played, maybe they've fixed these issues.  
---
At first, Outer Worlds reminded me a lot of Knights of the Old Republic (in a good way, I loved that game).  Outer Worlds is not open world.  It's not linear, but you're going where they want you to with little option.  There aren't invisible walls, you can see them quite clearly.  As time passed, OW began to remind me of KotOR2 (in a bad way, I despised that game).  The truth is - other than New Vegas - I've never much liked Obsidian's games.  Clunky stories and/or bad writing get in the way of me just playing a game.
---
You think I want your opinion? I'd go out of my way to do the exact opposite of your opinion, after seeing how you've literally been wrong with 100% accuracy.

I feel wastelanders is gonna be a huge let down. "The whole future of the game rests on this update" maaan we are so fucked lol

Says the good boy following along while I make a fool of him for his stupid comments. 
---
Want a doggy treat boy?
---
"If we hold items back for a long enough time. Even never bring some items back. People will want to buy every item every week we update the shop. This will result in much more Atom sales. We had to leave a bunch of stuff broken and push back the Wastelander update for a year to put most of the team on increasing Atom sales revenue. In Spring we will tell them it will be out end of summer but we'll push it to end of fall, erase and change our site and press releases and say we always said end of fall. I expect revenue to increase 5% with this move. When wastelanders comes out it will cost 500 Atoms a week to play. The exact amount we give out for daily/weekly challenges. We expect it to completely break the game but I still forcast an increase of an additional 5% based on the users who are still playing and buying atoms" -Todd Howard talking to shareholders.

I love it when they have no self control.

Wow it‚Äôs about $100 USD for a year or $12.99 USD a month in the states. If you buy atoms it‚Äôs a decent deal for players here. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs so expensive for you guys.
---
Run along boy, now that I've completely destroyed any arguments you had and all you've got left is weak ass insults that are more funny than insulting.
---
You know nothing about me, just like you know nothing about this game obviously.
---
Really looking forward for you to explain us the glitch. Bethesda isn't gonna move a finger on this matter, I'm positive about that unfortunately.
---
Great build as well man, loved the CAMP!
---
People have been asking for this for months. So far no response sadly. 
---
My only suggestion is using the Xbox app to take screenshots of your photos then deleting them from the game so you can take more.
---
My only work around so far. Or if your not taking photos for challenges just take use the screenshot function while in photo mode so it goes directly to your hard drive or external hard drive.
---
Good luck
---

---
Aww did the fool finally realize I was just wasting your time and mocking you for your ignorant comments? Now you got to run away after I've disproved all your claims and all you're left with are weak ineffectual insults. Because that is all you are is weak and ineffectual at everything.

I‚Äôm playing on PS4 pro and I keep getting these damn blue screen crashes. But when I play on my regular PS4 the blue screen crash doesn‚Äôt happen. Is there a anything I can do to fix this issue??
---
You should do a coloring page where the ranger armor you get from bethesda's new Fallout Worst subscription actually looks as it's worth getting like it does in that fallout 4 mod
---
Fallout 2, not this game
---
You went deep
---
even without the price difference, the atoms you get don't give you enough IMHO. If you compare watching whatever you want on netflix to a fireplace, a weapon skin and some wallpaper (for example), it doesn't feel competitive on the entertainment marketplace. Bethesda should be more more aware that people think that way. If they're not pricing things right, they'll end up with only whales buying their stuff.
---
Wow, only one minute for that string pull to get a result.
---
I know you‚Äôre easily manipulated.

Yea I was just talking about this last night, they used to be formidable now they‚Äôre like overgrown mole rats.

Most annoying thing shouldn‚Äôt even have a limit I should be able to fill my hard drive!
---
Did ya check the mounted section (wall decor, I believe) of the camp building interface??? If it actually took and you learned it, it will no longer be in your pip-boy.
---
The constant stash inventory micro-management simulation feature that you get for not paying an overpriced subscription is really just to die for. The best part is how they've had that feature in the game since launch and so now it's almost like they're paying me with all the money I'm saving by not paying to get rid of it yknow?
---
&gt; scrolling...scrolling...scr- aaand I'm out of VATS
---
Sorry I don't get it ... what are you referencing?

Okay, that was three minutes for that string pull to get a result.

A little better. Need to work on that self control a bit, kid. 
---
You‚Äôre the one dancing trying to prove me wrong or that I made edits, etc. You‚Äôre putting out all the effort, son, not me. Keeping multiple tabs open to monitor me.

i have all the event PA plans if ur on xbox

Please, no. I can already onehit 98% of the enemies with my unyielding ninja. I don't need my punches to be 40 percent stronger. 
---
I used to ask for it, during the first month, while learning game mechanics. Then I discovered the unyielding + mutated + bloodied unarmed combo. Yikes. Talk about overkill.
---
It isnt really worth it to capture every workshop if you have access to a private server. Except if you want to afk farm. Otherwise it's way more effective to farm glassed caverns. You'll get 4-8 scorched spawns every ~20 seconds. Most of the time every second pull at least one is legendary sometimes even 2-3 per pull. After on hour you'll drop legandaries and swim in gifts.
---
Well if you are stupid enough to  pay for Fallout 1st...
---
This strikes me as such a dumb form of pedantry and semantics. Rather than offering the opportunity to obtain something cheaply, they've instead offered to give it for free. This is not a downgrade in the service being offered. One would have to be perverse in the extreme to regard this as a slight to be endured rather than a boon to be celebrated.

Yup same, I have it on pc to but ain‚Äôt touching that till they fix the hacking permanently

Yes,  that is definitely more effective, and is how I have been spending most of evenings since this event launched.  I just had to see what happened if I went all-out like that.üòâ  The Glass Cavern run is definitely more rewarding.

I don't use the billboard or letters because it takes up so much budget to make a decent sign. I'm left with enough for four walls and a sleeping bag.

And now you‚Äôll see what self-control and discipline actually is. Watch closely and you may learn something, kid.
---
üòÇ so much wine.
---
Interesting.   I have been doing speed-runs.  I take out the closet group and then mine the closest Ultracite to get the next  batch to spawn.   Takes me maybe 15 minutes to do a run through there now,  and then I just move on to a new server and do it all over again.
---
Not everyone thinks that way. I cancelled my Netflix and got a FO1st subscription because I find a source of video entertainment that I can actually participate in to be much more valuable than one that I just sit mindlessly and stare at.  There's only a $1 difference in monthly price here between Netflix and FO1st any amount of entertainment I get out of Fallout far surpasses that extra dollar that I spend. Most of Netflix content is crap and even without FO1st I tend to only keep my Netflix subscription 3 months out of the year. Once I've watched everything that entertaining I cancel and wait until they build up enough content but it's worth subscribing again.

I posted this in a response to the top comment, but for visibility I will repost it as a new comment thread here (I‚Äôm on mobile so I apologize for the poor formatting). This was in response to a user commenting that the references to exclusive discounts was removed from the marketing for FO1st:
---
It was never actually removed. This[This](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce)  page on Bethesda‚Äôs official website contains the line ‚ÄúAs a Fallout 1st member, you‚Äôll have access to exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop, so not only are you getting bonus Atoms every month, you‚Äôll get discounts on some sweet items to spend those Atoms on.‚Äù
---
So it‚Äôs not just a figment if anyone‚Äôs imagination or magically disappeared from the marketing overnight. It‚Äôs still there for everyone to see. The problem is that there have been several pages advertising first added, but if I remember correctly, this was the page posted at launch.
---
Edit: Looks like this article was published Oct. 31 2019 which corresponds to the release of FO1st so like I said above, this looks like the official release advert.
---
Ohhhhh. That glowing skeleton skin would look sick at night in a bush.
---
I feel similarly.  Netflix isn't worth much to me.  FO-First so far, is of more enjoyable use.  I look at the cost, compare it to a meal or cofffee, and judge what I think provides more longevity in pleasure.
---
So, I clearly did not think this through before I opened everything..... The nearest vendor to my out-in-the-boondocks C.A.M.P. is normally a 35-Cap hop away.  I am now at full capacity on my stash &amp; almost double on my carry-capacity. Looks like I am in for a slow, painful slog through the Mire tonight.
---
Quietly holding out hope that Bethesda has a shred of dignity left.
---
This is a great list!   Thank you!
---
Thank you for the notice! Was able to get my boyfriend to log in for me and get it since I'm out of town for the weekend.
---
Ah you do it another way =D You can just run trough the whole dungeon and only loot the ultracite at the end then alt f4 quit if you join the exact same server again one of those spots you already looted is again clickable but wont vanish after you clicked it. Everytime you click it now again 4-8 scorched will spawn ;) this will work until you leave the cave or reset the server. 
---
I had like ~500 piles of dead scourched lying around before the server did crash... i kinda only loot the legendary ones.
---
Hi! I‚Äôm around but have the wrong Astrosguy or you left. Either way, no worries but just in case I‚Äôm ZforZombies2016

Likewise. I moved 500+ pounds of crap legendaries to my sales alt this afternoon. I also crafted/gathered 300+ presents on my main and moved them to my level 5 character to open.
---
I know there's a risk, but I've done it enough times that if I happen to lose something I won't be too chuffed about it.

By the way, I was looking at your post history and it seems like no matter what game you play you are not happy. Maybe it's time to find a new hobby for your own mental healths sake?
---
Just roaming the map and enjoying the environment. Regardless of all the bugs they did a great job creating a environment and from all The fallouts it's the most immersive.
---
The problem with that is some of us have tents/camps in the same place for all 5 characters. My level 5 is camped near Sutton Station, and 3 of my other alts have their survival tent there.

And I'm not going to apolgize for speaking english at a normal adult level. If that's too much for you to handle, that's your problem, not mine. I'm not going to talk down to people by reducing my vocabulary to that of children on the assumption that they can't speak like adults. It's disrespectful.

What a success. I want to thank the community for being so supportive. Enjoy the holidays and I hope you got something nice (irl and in-game)!

I came back and even got to add to my mole miner gauntlet collection! Woo-hoo!

Support weapons. Like i dont know a net gun that traps enemies for a few seconds.

This makes me feel much less guilty about not having done so yet at level 78!
---
The very first time pvp (that I wasn't even involved with) broke out in my camp they destroyed my radiation shower and I was done with that. From then on if people started acting like idiots, I'd hurry up and store it. Pacifist is all fine and dandy unless your teammates are a little too trigger happy with others.
---
Once you put the keycard in, you don't have to reinsert it if you go back to the silo
---
What guns do you use? I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs only heavy weapons that stagger them but when you see their head go backwards when you shoot (easy to spot on the queen) that means if they were going to land now they won‚Äôt and it resets the process
---
That doesn't effect carry weight... Well fed rank 2 is 50+HP and well hydrated is 50% faster AP regen.
---
The art and environment are amazing as well as Appalachia radio songs (except a couple of shitty ones, wish there were a ‚Äòskip‚Äô button). Lighting and atmospheric effects are gorgeous to look at. Weapons‚Äô visual and audio are very satisfying. Boss fights are well-designed. Rewards are lackluster most of the time but the action is good.
---
I remember running to my quest and seeing my first deathclaw in the road ahead a week ago, I immediately stopped and went crouch to stealth, slowly backed away and ran and took a different path around to my quest.  Haven't killed a deathclaw yet but didn't realize they weren't a challenge like new vegas, my worst fear in that game was seeing a deathclaw.

I thought about this a lot but it would come down to so many people hiding. Ive always been a pvp guy on NW but honestly it could go both ways for me. People hiding under water and in bushes would annoy me after awhile but still being part of the game i couldnt get to upset over it. Id probably vote yes to the night maps
---
I used a hunting rifle as my main weapon for almost 100 levels.  It may not have been the best weapon, but it got the job done just fine.
---
Not every weapon needs to be as good as the best.  If it can get the job done easily, it's perfectly fine.  Plus, it gives you something to strive for as you play.
---
I haven't encountered a maintenance shutdown on private yet, but that would piss me off too. I did one month of first, mainly to get a stockpile of 5.56 and legendaries, in that month I have been able to get the wepons I wanted, by trading and mumbles, and 79k 556. I'm going to cancel after my month now because private servers are boring, and I have enough crap to live off of for a long time

I started using a instigating hunting rifle around level 60 and im at 210 still using it.  Instigating / limb damage / faster reload.  My backup is a furious FFR handmade for when I'm in trouble.
---
Just gotta find the mod, I think.  The Mod Plans for Ultracite aren't really as common as they once were.  I remember there were times when people were just dropping Ultracite Explosive Vent Plans by the scores upon the ground.
---
they need to make sheepsquach much more aggressive with some melee action.  as much of an ammo dump they are, there should be a better chance of them taking you down.  I've died to mirelark kinds and bears way more than i have sheepsquachs.
---
Uh no?  It's really versatile, upgrade-able and powerful.  It's mostly just been rare as all hell to get good Legendary versions of the rifle.  Not sure what you're smoking when you say it's overshadowed.
---
Ok thank you
---
Good get I had like 20 charisma when I found mine so it was 8800 but I feel like it barely sells lower
---
Do you mean your carried weight goes up from 80 to 120, or that your maximum encumbrance decreases?
---
If the left number goes up, then there has to either be a weight reduction effect going away or new weight coming in from somewhere. 
---
Check your perks and your gear for such effects to see if there are any active/inactive. 
---
If it‚Äôs the right number that goes down, that means your carry capacity decreased for some reason. There is food that grants carry weight increases, and of course effects that increase your Strength. A 40 lbs shift is basically 8 points of Strength, but could also be affected by food like Grilled Radstag that directly increases your carry capacity. 
---
Is it possible that some of those types of effects wore off? 
---
Heck, it could even be Unyielding gear granting bonus strength and then if you healed some Rads or health, that bonus drops. 
---
I hope you get it figured out, but there are too many variable to accurately diagnosis this issue for you.
---
There was a few not so broken events with a couple of cool prizes but other than that and this Christmas event there wasn't much on
---
Try to log out and back in. I‚Äôve had mine show up again after that, or check your stash.

AMEN TO THAT. I feel like I'm getting some of my moxy back... at 57, feel like I might be able to start over. From scratch.  Thinking of heading back to Alaska by this time next year.
---
Someone came in to buy things from your publicly accessible vendor, and this was going to put you at or over max caps?
---
Horrifying story.
---
Instigating yes, the rest is up to you. Technically a lever does a little more damage but I just don't like the way it sounds as much as the hunting rifle.

I don't know, the Holiday event has really been for me just a stark reminder of how shitty the  RNG in this game is.  And not because of what I didn't get, ***but because of what  I did get.***  I am level 355 and today I opened a gift and got plans for... a baseball bat.  I got these plans for the first time.  I had never learned them until today.  These aren't plans that I need. They aren't particularly important.  They pretty meaningless actually. But I've ran tons of events and had thousands of plans drop but it took me 355 levels to get plans for a damned baseball bat? Seriously?
---
Lots of new mounted head plans available from the Christmas event. That‚Äôs kept me grinding lately.
---
This is awesome
---
There's a few side roads that end, not sure of a crater though.
---
Nukashine is fucking wild.
---
If you start at the monorail fast travel and then run towards the circus, there‚Äôs a giant crater in the ground!
---
I actually got the plasma grenade plans- BEFORE I GOT THE BASEBALL BAT! LOL!  I mean.. wow. WTF
---
It doesn't have to be a crater, sorry for that dumb stipulation! Just has to look like the road ends at the town I'm gonna build. Thanks for the info, can you give me a few general areas of where these would be?
---
Back in the day, we used to fire explosive shotguns at the mainframes.  Explosive autos worked well too.  Grenades other than Frags seem too precious to waste on the terminals though, but it's your call.

When I get spotted I swap from my AAE .50 hunting rifle to my TSE handmade and get out of trouble

Thanks man! Appreciate that. I'm gonna check it out after this trade I'm couriering for
---
The hunting rifle didn't drop as legendary for the first 3/4 months the game was out so they didn't really get mass duped. 
---
An instigating and faster fire rate would be pretty damn good if you can find one. My instigating lever kills most pve stuff in one shot.
---
Probably any grenade just some produce a bigger blast radium. Maybe try the explosive perk with your grenades?
---
Honest mistake is putting something up on atom shop for 5 atoms. This is deliberate as they never said monthly exclusive sales.

Anyone on PS4 doing this?
---
I once had a rifle with 90% reduced weight and it kept glitching and one time it weighed 20 pounds then the next day it weighed 1.35 pounds it bounced around constantly.
---
Not reasonably true when it says ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù to FO1st members.
---
Follow the main quest to the overseer's camp then Flatwoods.  Water is important.  Pick up everything you can and scrap it. Keep only the weapons you can use. Scrap the weapons you don't to open the mods.  Then take some time and look around and learn what you should be doing.  Don't waste time on a large fancy camp .. keep it simple.  If you need caps you can sell junk and weapons to the vendor bots for caps, you can not sell most scrap unless bulked. Have fun.
---
For me the lore and exploration is the appeal of 76.  Finding peoples' personal stories and listening to them on tapes, reading their final thoughts, and putting together the myriad interconnected stories that start off small and solitary, was what drew me.  There's easter eggs, little call-outs to other Fallout games, and just the gorgeous biomes that you encounter.  If you are not feeling connected to some of the stories and quests, I am not sure what to say.  To each their own, I suppose?
---
Also there are plenty of NPC's, they are just nonhuman.  :-)

Quit, the game dosnt really get much better, each new patch fixes one thing and brakes 10 other things.
---
Wait till wastlanders comes out next year and see if that makes it better.
---
Hrmm... you sure that Explosive effects don't work?
---
I'm always down to help. Shoot me a friend invite sometime. CapAm40
---
Oh yeah.. if another player gets your attention and drops a paper bag they are giving you something... Take it and thank them.
---
I could see that being a slight issue.. the camp of whichever character you're logged into would have to get priority placement.
---
Lag makes high-risk pvp difficult. The wanted system is also entirely one-sided, bypassing the slap dynamic for the wanted party but still making you unable to initiate pvp. Your best bet is to use sentinel gear and stand (don't crouch) and tank the initial shot. Just don't stand out where you can be sniped with vats. Make sure you use radiation to keep your health at your desired level and use healing items that work over time in anticipation of a fight. Stay away from things that add life or endurance, as the recalculation when it wears off can put you at 1 health temporarily. Otherwise, it's just down to gear, perks, and planning.
---
Huh? I shoot them with my handmade one at a time... hence my post about using grenades
---
Well i guess its good the game didnt cost me much then üòÖ
---
That's why I enjoyed Meat Week. He was always up the hill from my camp. Brought a ton of players to my base for vending as well. Wish he'd just stay there
---
Suppose i should stop playing music and listen to the individual story lines huh? Thanks lol
---
I'll try that. Cos when i removed everything else feom vendor. I didnt see them in my stash. Hope relogin helps...
---
Thanks! I was seriously considering spending a few hours to build a base so i guess ill go horde shit instead üòÇ
---
what they need to, is move the bolt back to the other side. nothing more irritating than using a left handed bolt with a right handed animation. and maybe bump the fire rate up a tiny bit.
---
I built one at my police camp. Used the cryptic poster and vault cutouts as targets. You can even use a foot switch to open the door for shooting the targets as a game
---
This is great!  I always love to see new people getting into rp in any game. It adds so much to the experience if you find others to tag along or even by yourself at times. Hope you have fun!
---
Ultracite and Excavator power armor unfortunately don't have any headlamp mods.
---
Some of the best people are the recluses.
---
Rip
---
So true!
---
I don‚Äôt care what weapons they add as long as they make legendary variants possible to get.
---
I used to love chucking nuka grenades.  They are cheap and make a nice explosion.  Lol
---
I've been trying to find a community that does rp but I can't say that I've been lucky. Thank you though! I had to get my fiance to read over it because I like to use run on sentences. Lmao
---
The hunting rifle is a solid weapon. The only real downside is that it is slow to fire. It is a weapon meant to be used with stealth and that requires proper positioning to keep out of the frying pan. 
---
As much as I like it however, it is simply outclassed by the lever action, handmade, the gauss rifle, and even the combat rifle. The versatility of the lever and combat rifles are such that they can handle mobs better with the gauss being a little stronger with excellent hip-fire accuracy (i.e., you don't need to aim down the sights to hit flying targets). Versatility rules unless you are extremely patient, and in that case, the hunting rifle is an excellent weapon.
---
Imho, the handmade and combat rifle should be automatics, while the hunting rifle, lever action, and gauss rifle being the sniper weapons of choice. The poor assault rifle is outclassed by pretty much every other weapon.
---
I've had issues placing objects in existing buildings, turns out mats don't care what they're placed on and displays are quite happy to be placed on mats all day long...üòä
---
Only if you logged in.,
---
My game crashed yesterday as I was retrieving my drop bag after I was killed by an exploding Robobrain.
---
Yeah sorry this comes from a level 200+ player. Doing everything in the game will get you to level 40 or so, after that it's just grinding for gear and repetitive gameplay.
---
 
---
Unlike past fallouts this one doesn't have a bunch of hidden lore and feature. No new content to play till waaterlanders as far as I heard.
---
Phew good thing I didn‚Äôt, what happend though?
---
Yeah get a refund asap. This game is not at a playable state. Come back around May 2020
---
Charisma can count for a lot, dooooo not forget about the Party Boy perk, Whiskeys get +30 carry weight. 
---
Chems don‚Äôt stack so don‚Äôt waste em all in one go.
---
Higher intelligence= more scrap from weapons and armor, password guesses have shorter words
---
Try to mess around with Nuclear Winter on a seperate character, and bank all of the caps and XP so that character can roll out of vault 76 level 10-20 and get decent quest rewards!(I.e. lvl 15/25/35/45 somerset special, black diamond)
---
I love you! But how are you spawning on the welcome mat when you fast travel?
---
You need to have a different mindset playing this game. There is a lot of lore, but you need to actually read it from notes or listen to holotapes to experience the story. It doesn't get pushed in your face with conversations like in the other games.
---
Don't rush the main storyline, join events, get to know others from the vault.
---
In all honesty, if it is possible to keep grinding and getting better and better gear, thats the sort of game thatll get me absolutely hooked! I love it when i can just melt away my time becoming overpowered
---
I feel ya on finding communities. Its hard to find good people to rp with. A lot of people I met usually just end up playing however or giving up on the rp :(
---
Good luck on starting your story though!
---
Thank you!
---
Might help!
---
At least 1 hacker robbed 500ish people.
---
Several others also struck using the same hack.  
---
Might be still going on.
---
‚ÄúIt just works.‚Äù
---
Just a quick question. Scorch murdered by turrents, can you loot these bodies?
---
The community.   
---
I came into the game feeling actively unenthusiastic about the concept of teaming up with strangers &amp; had such good experiences that I am now a person who actively seeks out teaming up with random people (including in other games), dropping gifts for whoever happens to stop by my camp, designing camps to be useful or entertaining, etc.    
---
In some games I've felt guilty about teaming up. I'm decent at combat but not exceptional so it often felt like I wasn't able to contribute equally. But since this game has more potential areas of knowledge than a more straightforward FPS, I've often been able to join a team of people with perfected powerful builds &amp; weapons &amp; etc. and still have useful supplies / skills in different areas / etc.
---
Well shit, alot of the second half of that went right over my head, guess ill experience the game a bit more them come back and see if i understand haha
---
This is what the game should be. Full of mechanics, scientists,  chefs, junk sellers, doctors, explorers,  mercenaries, adventurers, drug addicts, farmers, moonshiners, tavern owners, etc
---
The whole thing goes to hell after level 50 or 60 since everyone can be good at everything. I wish the levels were capped to allow more of what you are doing. Players could have 5 totally different characters with different talents. Maybe this is what they wanted.
---
All that aside I really like what you have here. Good job!
---
We got details yeeeeeeeeeeeeees!
---
So he was trying to steal from you then...or no?
---
An interesting proposal....   might actually make Deathclaw Island scary again!
---
I got it for about $15, it would be a waste of time for me to drive to the shop i got it from üòã
---
You are brilliant, I don't know if my keyboard supports macros I will have to duckduckgo it. Thx so much :)
---
Is this happening on PS4?
---
I definitely agree with you there, but with this new character I'm walking down the road just taking my time. Not rushing into anything, I THRIVE TO BE DARYL lol
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Okay, you really need to understand how this game works. If some changes like that is applied, something horrible, gamebreaking is bound to happen. That's how it's been for the last 13 months. So please don't ask for any gameplay changes. It does us nothing but bad. I have a feeling this Wastelanders update will be the doom of us
---
Burn it then?
---
I could certainly adapt if they announced this and gave us a few days to move, but for my purposes it is nice having most of my characters set up with a singular free FT point. My main has enough caps that it doesn't matter, but the other 4 are lazy bastards....
---
Once ur end game theres literally nothing to do except drop nukes and maybe a few events.. would add raids to the list but with servers being slow as shit, and vault raids being time based.. not a great combo..
---
Main reason im playing my alt more than my main rn tbh
---
The hunting rifle should be more powerful but slower than the lever action considering that the lever action uses .45 while the hunting uses .308/.50 which should do massive damage to targets, not the same a a .45 or less. The trade off for the lever action should be +fire rate but -damage while the the hunting rifle should be vice versa.
---
Also plan on it being my "Stream Character"
---
Congratulations Bushmaster! I barely had the patience to hide my way through the snowflake metal armor. Luckily I was gifted the fancy pants outfit by a kind stranger because I am definitely not bothering with that grind.
---
Fellow bush hider here, but I must confess that I actually fired at another player this week. He gunned down my bush mate. I had bonded with this player who had looked right at me as we met in the same hiding place and never thought about attacking me in the entire 3 minutes we knew each other. His loss was too much that I had to attempt vengeance. I downed the player that took him but his squad mates got me back and revived him. It's definitely for the best as the bloodlust may have never been quenched if I had actually gotten my first kill.
---
Lose your legendary Armor and use nothing more powerful than the anti-scorched pistol you got from firebreathers.
---
**16 times** more broken
---
I like when I'm on a money run and he shows up. Saves me the overencumberd walk to a vendor. Nice change of pace when it happens.
---
This game abstracts ammunition so weirdly...  here's a comparison of the 'smaller' .45 of a lever action, against the .308.
---

---
How to get them respawned?
---
They don't count as "your" kills, as far as I can tell.
---
Quality of life improvements? How about text chat, perk card loadouts, a looking-for-group tool and a global trading post?
---
I don't suppose you're still on?
---
Thx man ill give them a go
---
You and what pipe pistols?
---
This subreddit.
---
I dunno
---
What is this rug glitched connector you speak of?
---
Yes
---
Ah,hello brother
---
Thanks Sage!
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm not. Watching the Witcher and about to head to bed. But I can giveaway more the next few days. I made 200 sets and I still have about 90 left.
---
wait you actualy BOUGHT repair kits? lmao sue bethesda? fucking moron.
---
Look who's talking, dipshit. Try doing some research and gathering information before you act out. You're just making yourself look like a fool
---
Hey, I don't know about you but not everybody in the game is running some OP high-damage build that turns pretty much every enemy in the game into complete jokes. Deathclaws are pretty deadly for me to deal with, since I usually have to whip out whatever heavy gun I have on me to do any real pain against them. And unless I'm in power armor, I'm getting outright killed in 3 hits by them. No buts. 
---
Like obviously Deathclaws won't feel threatening when you're OP as shit, dealing 182 damage per shot without crits
---
Get the excavator P.A. at lvl 25 a.s.a.p. This armor will allow you to gather way more minerals and metals.
---
Mutate as soon as soon as you get starched genes (lvl 30). Life will get way easier. I like marsupial &amp; speed demon. 
---
Run leader of the pack if low level (1-10) for easy low level legendaries. 
---
The Christmas scorched legendaries drop a lot of decent low level legendaries so farm them like crazy.
---
I‚Äôm glad other people are giving away the outfits as well. If I ever see you near my bush I will let you pass in peace. üôè
---
Ah ok when do you suppose you'll be on
---
research what?
---
On Suing bethesda, on why someone might buy repair kits, etc. The facts that go into the post
---
Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to the Texans game at 3:30 CST so it‚Äôll definitely be the evening. Maybe 9 pm CSTish
---
They really need a better animator to animate those because their current one is awful. Animations are everything with a gun, it's gotta feel satisfying.
---
Suits, lots of suits
---
I agree
---
Ok cool
---
have fun trying to sue bethesda over 2 50 cent repair kits.
---
Mood,also look out for matching men in suits and glasses
---
Why do you think I said do some fucking research dingus? There are HUNDREDS of reasons we could sue Bethesda now!
---
Idk,but I can get you a suit and glasses
---
The nuclear winter fur lined coat?
---
Seems like every three or four games this week, I‚Äôve been teamed with folks who just stand there waiting for the fire to eat them.
---
i dont think you understand how litigation works bud
---
Buddy, that‚Äôs a atomic shooter item technically,if anyone where to drop it it would disappear,you gotta grind for it I guess
---
This is the main reason I quit and requit doing vault raids.   Too much invested to not have progress saved, a basic of good vault gameplay on many MMO‚Äôs.
---
This would be a good time to stop playing the game.
---
I've been told by alot of people there's a glitch and you can buy them out of vendors.
---
That‚Äôs actually incorrect. [NW dropped](https://imgur.com/a/06geLSw)
---
It's not just the raids though. It's the entire game being this way
---
Weird,well watch out for matching men in suit and glasses,you may just meet us
---
I gave away over 100 sets tonight on Xbox.
---
Huh,thought it was,got it,sorry
---
I've been in courtrooms more times than you've stepped foot outside, so don't you dare tell me what I do and don't know.
---
No problem. It probably should have been unable to drop or trade. But until they fix it I‚Äôm gonna give away as many as I can!
---
I would if I had it
---
why are you in court so much? do you get sued alot? probation hearings?
---
I just rolled with it!  I am going for an off meta build as per my style (I‚Äôm a rookie and have to have some qol perks at the sake of optimal damage).  I‚Äôm going for a mix of VATS rifle and limited sniping.  That being said, I‚Äôm going to end up moving some points from strength/endurance, but I won‚Äôt change drastically.  I expect to play for a long time to come, haven‚Äôt even finished the main story by a long shot lol.  Happy new year!
---
For your information, I'm a an appointed defense attorney in the United states. So again, don't tell me what I do and don't know about how legal actions work.

Not sure if it's still up, but they were giving it away for free as a christmas gift in Fallout 4 last week. If you get the itch to play that one again.

Even better, rugs can be placed on mats and then put underground, so you can set things partially in the ground. I've gotten used to placing everything on mats in my camp.

I'm pretty sure I happen to have an extra, if u still need it I'll be on tomorrow and would be happy to give it to u, I kno the pain of losing something to a blue screen
---
god help anyone who seeks your legal counsel.

you arent fooling anyone kid.

Oh okay could be, I use a prime lever action on the SBs and often they land while I'm shooting them.   If it's heavies that stagger them that would make sense

What about the hat? I just want the hat. Pls

---
From some legal stuff used in court cases ive dealt with that came from online offenses: "Calling someone 'kid' is a typical way for young adults to make themselves feel older and more mature, and is most often used online"
---
This information was used in a case on a harrassment charge, coming from angry parents. They lost miserably, since it was a one time occasion and was an online interaction. 
---
Out of all 284 cases I've had, I've only lost 28. So try saying I'm a faliure again and we'll see just who looks bad then
---
I think you aren't aware of how costly suing someone can be. 
---
Would you be willing to put up 10-20k for the *chance* to take on an entire buildings worth of '100k a quarter' lawyers?

Lawyers that have already vetted everything done by the company and put in place safeguards they can pull in court like trap cards.

Not exactly *free* money. ;p

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.

There will be a new quest line in a bit with npcs,but otherwise it is fun to random crap with friends,like me and my friend walk around in tan suits and patrolmen glasses ,we are identical and like scaring people

Aww a fellow bush dweller, nice of you but would rather get rewards myself for later use.
---
Tadaaaa - Todd Howard
---
Could you please name some ways? I don‚Äôt see how you could sue them for buying repair kits and not being happy with your purchase. What do you even expect to get out of them in this case? A refund on the repair kits you used? I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs even worth the time and trouble.
---
Lmfao talking about hobbies yet you're the one going through other people's post history ü§£ü§£

Don't talk to me about finding a hobby when you're being sad enough to think my post history gives you some form of validation of being a Moron
---
I dig it!
---
You posted on an iOS forum asking about the name of an app you had on your iPad in 6th grade. Since the first iPads came out in 2010 the earliest your school would have has one for you is 2011. That would put you at the oldest in your early 20‚Äôs. 
---
Furthermore you need a license to practice law in each state in the US. You don‚Äôt just become a lawyer and become an ‚Äúappointed defense attorney in the US‚Äù. I mean, if you have managed to pass law school and pass the bar exam for every state in the US by 20 years old super kudos to you. You can see how it‚Äôs just not likely.
---
Vault raids are far too expensive to run even at novice as you burn so much ammo on bullet sponges. Would love them just to shorten the thing and give us an option to get 8 people in and not be "instanced".
---
Buddy, that was my son. I allow him to use my device and my accounts, so long as he doesn't get me in amy trouble (which he has on several occasions, getting him grounded)
---
if you are going to troll, at least be clever. even the most smooth brained moron can tell you arent an attorney. just stop
---
Congrats, could never do that with a pistol build so guess I won't be doing that anytime soon.
---
Yeah, agreed.
---
nice idea, but you already can create several characters to do exactly that.
---
I've posted proof on the r/police subreddit using a secondary account, if you can find it. It's legit the same username with a few numbers.
---
this kid posts on r/Minecraft and r/teenagers. its just some kid.
---
I'll admit that I haven't done a direct comparison of the two.  The .50 receiver does provide some great damage.  You might like the lever for its range; I believe it's around 25% more range than a hunting rifle (long barrels of course).  The main reasons I like my lever are 1) it shares .45 ammo with my Fixer, and 2) mine also has limb damage, which is an under-appreciated feature for keeping enemies away.
---
I‚Äôve had my camp in the same spot for months with no problems, this is very recent and it‚Äôs also happened at several workshops as well. It doesn‚Äôt happen all the time but when it does I have to log out as the game becomes unplayable. Can‚Äôt play if I can‚Äôt see! I‚Äôm hoping someone has an idea of what I could do here.
---
Ok then back to the point. If we the player base of Fallout 76 were to seek a class action lawsuit against Bethesda what in your legal opinion would be the specific legal claims we could make? Also please cite precedence so we can consider these as well. Could you also please provide the terms in the EULA we all agree to that Bethesda is in breach of? This will be especially important for our case.
---
im sure you did
---
I can kill them in one stealth shot with my instigating  black powder, but cave crickets take 2. Seems legit...
---
Is there a trick to this? Tried it multiple times and cannot get it to work.
---
Talk about an oversight, why not have a kill box there?
---
If I‚Äôve learned anything from Gaijin entertainment and Bethesda....
---
They never will.
---
Wow, very specific. However, It would take a few days to gather that information in my free time, and I never waste a ton of time doing it without pay. So I'm sorry, but I can't provide all of it. I can however, provide some minor things tomorrow
---
I hope those aren‚Äôt the ‚Äústrongest‚Äù cases you have against Bethesda. Didn‚Äôt they give the Christmas tent to FO1st subscribers? I believe that‚Äôs a discount. 
---
I guess it really just depends on which country you live in. The ‚Äúgame will not work how you expect‚Äù is not a case you will win in the United States. There has to be thousands of games that haven‚Äôt worked like I expected which is completely subjective.
---
"I'm fully qualified"
---
"somebody sue them!"
---
Hmm
---
If you are qualified to the degree you claim, but went through the actions you claim, God help our legal system.
---
One word for me: fanboy. Its alot like an abusive relationship where i keep telling everyone "... but i love her!?!"  I know. Fact is i love it, bugs and all.
---
So it sounds like you want separate servers aka split the player base? I‚Äôm all for a harder mode but you have to consider how it will effect the longevity of the game.
---
I was thinking Astro-then to infinity and beyond type shiz and how that relates to xp grinding
---
its simple. most people dont play video games to worry about Bethesda business practices or worry about ideology. just just play the game, if its too buggy they leave, its beth sells something they dont want, they dont buy. the noise here on reddit, or the clickbait videos on youtube really arent reflective of reality.
---
&gt;All because Beth made it more rewarding to sage squat than to pick up a rifle and join your team in battle.
---
The only battle that matters is the last one. 
---
It's a battle royale mode.  The entire point of the match is to win. And you win by being the last team alive. So that is what earns the most XP.
---
If they were taking advantage of the fun I get by playing the game, I would've spent more money than just my PS4 copy and pc key.
---
I'm enjoying the game, I buy cosmetics with the free atoms I get by doing the challenges (in a month I made something like 3k without grinding it, just by playing normally).
---
Some people spend a lot on the game, but if they can afford it and they want a cosmetic, it's common sense to pay for it if it's not free.
---
But not all of them are payed for, some of them are refunded, and nobody has ever bothered to actually take action. People need to stop letting corporations and companies win everything, or the world will just keep getting worse.
---
I would do it myself if I didn't already have cases I deal with on a daily basis
---
it was also due to the fact that in 4 Deathclaws now do this meaningless swerving thing as you shoot at them which in reality just slows them down if you have any sort of aim.
---
Happened to me twice yesterday. I was like "why tf would I want to hunt you if you're a simple low level legendary...".
---

Sorry, my bad. Looch#7529.

Depend on what you pressed, it could be in your inventory too.

People here just don't get it.

I would keep the 3rd one for situations where you know you wont maintain stealth, like SBQ

Welcome to Fallout 76!
---
The game ain't so different from FO4(which is it's problem too), so if you have the patience to actually read and you liked 4, you will probably like 76. 
---
76's endgame as a online game is it's biggest issue.
---
No it only matters because Australian law requires refunds for faulty products. If it was not faulty, they couldn't have been sued
---
What?! Bethesda not delivering what they promised/advertised?!
---
8k damage is not that strong, ennemies need more hp. Joke, I love my glass canon melee.
---
If on Ps4 I saw you both in a camp about an hour in half maybe 2 hours ago. One of you had a minigun I believe.

I thought it was fixed?
---
Does Ultracite have Emergency Protocol for torso? I‚Äôve been trying to find the plan but haven‚Äôt had any luck
---
My question is a bit off subject but still C.A.M.P. related. How is it that this game has been out for a year and they've still not added the most obvious thing they could add to make it feel more like you're resettling the Appalachian countryside, log cabins. They would be the perfect thing to build and make it feel authentic. With stone fireplaces. And covered porches.
---
Except they are reflective of reality. It's a public forum.  
---
If people have issues they have no way to voice them otherwise. Beth Support doesn't give a shit. When something breaks the camels back people come here.
---
Congratulations, you can solo novice and standard! Unless you‚Äôre australvoid, you‚Äôre not soloing dead in the water on expert. I guarantee there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre soloing the second and third rotation of the raid on standard in less than 10 minutes. Have fun grinding standard hundreds of times!
---
I‚Äôd keep one of the fixers and the combat rifle but change that to .38
---
They need to be buffed so they are just as strong in the game as in the stories and legends  we hear from people across the wasteland, we've heard stories of them tearing through parties of 6-12 people in a matter of minutes
---
Classic reason is to get a brain fart and drop it instead of putting it down regularly at some point. Looks the same, standing there. But it is removed from your inventory. 
---
Not saying that is what happened here though, but it is what my friend did. Had to craft him a new set.
---
I‚Äôd use the one you were already using, given those choices.
---
It is in a playable state and that is fact. Just played it yesterday.
---
I bought the hat and fur lined coat for 500 caps each at a player vendor tonight. They had crafted about 5 each.
---
Make deathclaws scary again 2020
---
You obviously didn't look very long.
---
Hahahah yes =)
---
wait what
---
Mine was a Furious Lever Action.    I know it had "Damaged Increased After Each Consecutive Shot"  and  increased vats damage and one other thing i can't remember.     Now it only has 50% Percent Limb Damage and Damaged increased after each shot.       I was gonna put a ticket in but to be quite honest i'm just gonna get told they can't do shit about it so i just scrapped it.
---
You should always restart this game if you find something you want to make sure you keep for good.
---
You current Executioners Fixer (imho) is the best of the 3 weapons for a stealth VATS build.
---
If you haven‚Äôt already, I would recommend the following mods to reduce the VATS AP cost: aligned barrel, reflex sight, forceful stock.  
---
Also, I would highly recommend switching to a commando build (mod to automatic receiver- this will reduce your VATS AP cost by 50%).  The reduced damage is not very noticeable- you will still be 1-2 shotting most enemies.  However, the DPS,  ability for crowd control and going through a mag in VATS are greatly improved.   All you need to do is switch commando perks for rifleman perks (I frequently switch between the builds: commando for Fixers; rifleman for lever &amp; sniper rifle).
---
Fixer gives a noticeable bonus to stealth
---
PS. AngryTurtle (on YouTube) has some excellent videos on VATS, sneak and builds.
---
PPS. As someone suggested in comments, keep both fixers and mod one to .38 ammo for trash mobs or for that extra challenge.
---
PPPS. The Barbarian Fixer could be a fun weapon.  However, I would keep it for later.  The low resistance chameleon stealth build would be effective with the right perks and equipment.
---
r/humblebrag

Regarding the Mutant‚Äôs prefix: it‚Äôs only 10% bonus regardless of number of mutations

are you really surprised by this? it's bethesda we are talking about
---
Suit up in a ghillie suit and hide in the bushes! More xp from surviving as long as possible and placing in the top 5.
---
I too generally suck at pvp/br, and I get most of my points from just hiding and hoping for the lonely kill or two. Only a couple of times have i wiped a team of four with careful planning, chems, and sneak attacks. 
---
With practice at hidding, watching your surroundings, and trap/distraction camp placements, you can tend to reach the top 10. Maybe 5. I strive for 2nd, but usually make somewhere between in the top 10 at least.  I think at Top 5 or higher can get you a around 100-500 (figure 1rst place) xp.
---
&gt; I swear, is somebody gonna sue Bethesda? They need to learn a lesson, and it's just free money for us at this point!
---
They haven't actually done anything illegal, so no, it would not be free money for us. In fact, the person who starts it would likely have to declare bankruptcy because all the costs would fall on them after they lose.
---
And it is not cheap.
---
They have a system in Elder Scrolls Online where every enemy is the same high level, and lower level players are scaled up to be able to fight them. Leveling up in that system is still useful as you have access to better skills and gear, but essentially you're the same challenge level throughout the game.
---
Weird how you and your son have the exact same posting style, the exact same attitude, the exact same grammatical tics, the exact same everything, really.
---
It's almost like your son doesn't exist and it's just you.
---
Even more nothing.
---
because there is no actual legal grounds you could hope to win off of. Armchair lawyering basically.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
First time I've ever used them but where I place it is where I spawn when I ft to the workshop, usually right beside the santa-tron container.  Well, except for the dirt track workshop, usually just end up falling through the map and land with a broken leg.
---
Level up hyperdrawl to ten, decrease push and ignition, shuttle back black flaps, avoid the mass gravital pull and bobs your uncle!
---
I've relogin. All my items which i pulled out from the vendor machine are gone. Nevertheless. I m not badly affected by this problem. Now am only going to place a few stash on the vendor only for sales...
---
Got on for the first time in months and 2 minutes after joining a lobby with my friend we finally get ready to play and a nuke is a launched and immediately crashed the game. Haven‚Äôt opened the game since. I‚Äôm not even mad just disappointed.
---
I don't need a discount, If I'm running low, I just buy more, although the Atoms I get with my 1st Membership should be enough, probably, maybe.  
---
Looking forward to the new content coming in FO76 and the new Atom Store Items being added with it.
---
Nah stealthboys need to stay the same unless they take vats out of pvp
---
Ive see that twice now. Same location both times, actually. I wonder if it has anything to do with laying down in the vault before spawning. Waist high being about bed height. But honestly, who knows.
---
It does, but it gives the same error.
---
The exe file forces me to log in and the bethesdanetupdater launches the Launcher, which works, but if it was already launched, it does nothing and you have to open it from the expandable menu next to the internet, keyboard layout,time and notifications.
---
My level 289 has never got the plasma grenade plans. Not from gifts and not from 300 attempts at battle bot. My levels 15 and 19 have had them multiple times from gifts.
---
I can't find them.  I can find the game in the Control panel, but that's it.
---
If you use the map around Deathclaws too it will become even easier
---
Just wait till you get banned for hacking the game.
---
Did i miss any moomoo?
---
You seem to have all the basic Specials. I have lower str and higher int/charisma. I would work in a point of Gun Fu if you use vats. 
---
I dont like Exlposive weapons so i have 5 ranks of Gunsmith. I keep the 5 in int unless I want to switch back to Demo Expert in the future. You want demo expert if you have explosive. I just got tired of repairing it every 5 minutes.
---
Imo, stealth commando is best for SBQ. My finger gets tired of pulling the trigger after 500 rounds from my handmade, but I dont run her often. 
---
I have never shot an ultracite round and I still one shot 99% of the game.
---
No 2 is a Berzerkers ( not that great ).   No3 is a Mutants with 250dr ( currently bugged but hopefully fixed soon ).
---
No1 is an Executioners -  not bad - best of the bunch.
---
As for weapons, I've been running Instigating Handmade, Two Shot Handmade, Furious, Handmade, and AA Handmade. The instigating and furious seem to be the best for my playstyle. I finally found an instigating lever so that may change.
---
Any power armour body plans for t45 t61 51 or raider
---
That's how I roll, yo. These are my opinions as how I prefer to play. So much of this can change depending on preference. Por ejemplo, I use rejuvinated in endurance rather than good doggy, because I have a radtoad farm. I also keep my str at 5 so I can have some flexibility with melee, heavy weapons, or weight reducing perks.
---
thanks for the reply ! good advice
---
Had a workshop doing a defend against scorched and  my turrents took out 2 legendary scorched before I could get a hit so missed out on both gifts.  
---
 You would think because they were my turrents I would get something.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Ps4
---
Good idea, that would be cool!
---
They are so tough man! :)
---
I honestly think the whole thing would run a lot better if you  just ran it as an overly complex fallout 4 mod :P
---
Maybe...apart from SheepSquaches. As a high Level player it seems like enemies should become tougher. But they don‚Äôt really.
---
In my opinion balancing 76 around bloodied builds would be a terrible decision that would absolutely kill the game. Bloodied builds bring in the players who want to be overpowered and who do not want challenge in the game; there is a reason why so many players run with it. Bloodied removes any challenge to combat and will also be removing any challenge with the upcoming Wastelanders due to the insane special stats the sets gives. The only way to make the game difficult again would be to entirely remove the legendaries and the builds that break the game in the first place; not to cater to them.
---
True! I have the same issues. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense, like the size of a Cricket compared to a DeathClaw is minuscule, but yet they are tougher? What?
---
Me too...it‚Äôs strange!
---
It comes down to personality: some players need rewards and exp in order to take care of their teammates, some people use their stimpacks on others without hesitation
---
I went into the Wendigo cave yesterday thinking it would be an easy kill for the challenge! I'm leven 95 after all. 
---
But a Mirelurk king cornered me and melted my health. Glad it's not just me.
---
If it's this upsetting to you then YOU should sue Bethesda rather than asking someone to carry that weight for you. I can believe that it's nice to vent sometimes, though
---
Sent you a dm in case the link gets modded out.
---
I play both ways, just depends on how my teammates play.  If they go guns blazing, I‚Äôm right there with them.
---
Quick story on how I AFK during a match and scored the win,  
---
My full team vs 8 other players and the current safe zone was damn small.  I was on the edge just hiding when somebody dropped a nuke that was twice the size of the safe zone.  I was able to barely make it out, the bomb killed all 11 other players.  My team gets the win and all the glorious bonus XP. 
---
So yeah I understand why some people hate AFKing, but sometimes it‚Äôs not a bad thing.
---
Why not just add some fucking high level enimes? 
---
Games been out over a year and im still 4x the highest mob on the game
---
True, they have the reputation of being scary and tough, but aren‚Äôt either in Fallout 76. They were in Fallout 3, 4 and New Vegas. But are no longer difficult to kill. I do like the animation where they jump out of the ground however...that is cool! :)
---
It's more fun and quick to play it than hide in a Bush
---
Yes, me too! It‚Äôs a shame, as they are the most Iconic enemy within the Fallout games i think.
---
Well, I see where you're coming from, but the game is easy enough even without bloodied builds.
---
Yes, I run bloodied builds on all my characters and I think they need to balance out other builds to bring them on par with bloodied ones along with progressive mob stats. Implementation of support legendary effects and/or perk cards would be greatly appreciated for such builds. Also, some perks that only buff you progressively as you level up if you don't have specific gear (or do not any legendary gear at all) might help to even things out.
---
kinda selfish don‚Äôt ya think? it‚Äôs a  really fun game i‚Äôve been having a blast this month exploring the wasteland. Im just happy I didn‚Äôt listen to some of the bad reviews out there and saw a couple good ones. id hate for others to miss out on it for that reason as well
---
Isn't that what is supposed to happen?
---
No it isn't.
---
The thing I'm suggesting is a way to introduce higher (and ever growing) threat from every monster in game to make combat more dynamic and engaging. This system might also alter the mob's level according to other buffs applied to make a threat more visible from distance :D Simply adding yet another tier of mob levels won't help much if they won't scale with your ever increasing levels as far as I see.
---
Xbox. I just haven't played in a long time and was waiting for the big update but it got pushed back. I'll probably jump back on eventually after this inventory wipe hack is gone. I know it's only on PC but I do not want to take my chances.
---
I was being sarcastic. Meaning that he did something that wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen so Bethesda might ban him. ‚ÄúHaha‚Äù It was just a joke.
---
Try playing with non-legendary weapons in a non-sneak build, it's a little more difficult. For a reference to how powerful players would be if god rolls hadn't been duped, see Mistress of Mystery lol. I'm saying that even if mobs need a buff, players need a nerf too
---
exactly! this game is so good it just gets a lot of hate because of bugs
---
Fallout is for 18+ not for childs...
---
You know that a big part of the playerbase is 18- ...
---
I agree completely.
---
No, it has nothing to do with servers. It's just your local GPU and CPU power.
---
True, but in the open world and most likely for all of Wastelanders (Since it will be catered to any level) bloodied will absolutely reign supreme by a vast margin. Very few people even touch Project Paradise after the first month of it being it and Vault raids are horrible with current stability and the amount of ammunition you have to waste on it due to it being balanced around said builds.
---
Not Bloodied Tesla u mean quad. And bloodied in PvP aren't meta it's full health builds
---
I wan a "get real cash in my credit card account for every crash n bugs i encounter" armor/weapon. Pun intended
---
Sucks :(
---
Lmfao it‚Äôs pretty clear you don‚Äôt know a damn thing and obviously you‚Äôve yet to face a high health junkies build, you‚Äôll get melted in 1-2 seconds or faster facing one with a JFFR Tesla or even a quad. Either way stealth boy/teslas, explosive lasers/Gatling plasmas and strangler heart are cheesy af and if you use them you‚Äôre a scrub.
---
For crying out loud your post is literally asking people how you can be more tanky lol.
---
Nah I play with randoms all the time on both Xbox and PC when friends aren‚Äôt online and I‚Äôm 30. What‚Äôs your IGN? 
---
My mic splitter is broken so I have no voice though.
---
it aint wrong, but it is not practical to expect random players from all over the world to comply to your rules...
---
That‚Äôs pretty neat. I actually have it with all of the DLC‚Äôs, so it‚Äôs not much use to me. But thank you for letting me know! :)
---
I love this game but....
---
God DAMN some of you are petty.
---
People in the start of the thread are discussing filing lawsuits against Bethesda for ‚Äúfraud‚Äù....and a lot of them are completely serious.
---
You get free atoms. Why the hell would you prefer a discount over that? Just use the free atoms, Christ.
---
I hope you all find something more fulfilling in your lives than to demonize the developer of a game that you most likely play constantly.
---
I was a junkies build, and junkies Tesla builds don't hold up to bloodied, you guys must be ps4 players, call it a scrub move but I'll be off with your caps kiddo
---
I've had this a couple times both with mole rats I could only get it down to about 1% health then it instantly jumped back to 100%
---
What's a jffr Tesla?
---
Lol yeah your ps4 you guys are months behind xbox
---
I don't see a new video connected to his YouTube channel. Why not provide a link?
---
People are getting paid to abuse this sub and game. PERIOD. THIS is the thriving morally bankrupt field that is advertising and marketing online. I am sick and tired of seeing posts blaming trolls and bored or young users. Fucking Christ. How have so many of you not figure this out? Gullible AF.
---
Why isn‚Äôt the inspector outfit on there! Such BS
---
This shouldn't have happened, and it's entirely the fault of Bethesda for not patching this issue when it was first brought up. They need to take the in-game safety of their players more seriously: the next person who comes along and decides to exploit security vulnerabilities might not be so nice to give a video for us to react to. If this is what it takes to get Bethesda to patch severe issues within their game then I'm cool with losing some gear to a hacker during a SBQ fight (Bethesda said they'd do something to compensate players for their losses, and the last time they did that they gave people hundreds of Vault Steel)
---
It's probably just that one server that went down for maintenance. You can probably join another server.
---
This doesn't embarrass Bethesda. It's pushing users to pay Beth MORE for First rather than leave the game. If this fucking grade A loser is out to hurt Beth, he's failing miserably. If this person is trying to get Beth more money and keep the game popular, by all means..
---
I'm just going to wait and see. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Bethesda did the absolute bare minimum to deal with the immediate issue rather than sufficiently test to see if their "fix" was somewhat robust.
---
I'm not playing until Wastelanders anyhow so it doesn't bother me none personally.
---
You can keep down voting the 100s of people that tell the truth, but dont fucking delude people into thinking this game is actually worth buying and playing. Go ahead and push this comment to the bottom you shills, I'll wait.
---
i wish we could just enter the number on our keyboard
---
Don‚Äôt be ridiculous, you honestly don‚Äôt believe this hack has made the game more popular
---
He need to wait for someone to write him a new hack so he can get off again by hearing children cry. He's just a sick duck stalking children in the game.
---
Yet they did do something about it. I get it, you're happy for this douchebag, he's a hero to you. 
---
I mean he is the guy actually ripping people off. But I guess it's easier to blame bethesda, than the criminal right?
---
I really don't understand people like you. If you hate bethesda, and hate the game, simply stop playing, and if you have stopped playing, take the loss and move on with your life. It's much healthier than obsessing over something you clearly hate. People don't have to hate the same things you do. And you don't have to try and make them change their mind. Other people liking a game doesn't hurt you in any way. 
---
I guess you could be lonely, and are seeking validation in trashing on something you see others trashing on. Is it that you're lacking any real life social interactions, and are lashing out at an uncairing world by trashing on a game you hate?
---
I'd say get a girlfriend, but looking at your post history, that doesn't seem like it's an option for you outside of paying for it. 
---
"I‚Äôd stretch that asshole and fist it"
---
Such a romantic, I bet you're a hit with all the camgirls.
---
Lol I like what I like. 
---
Also literally you are the definition of human toxic garbage. 
---
Also how is the guy who is literally showing the world that a gaming company can‚Äôt keep anything safe ON THIER OWN GAME a criminal? I think you should find out what an actual criminal is.
---
We have both moved on from this silly interaction.. why are you here stirring the pot? who reads this far into a 1v1 thread? wtf. like I said not my finest work. You are calling us out for being ridiculous? maybe we should call you out for being the same..
---
I never called your "ridiculous". I just got to the end of your sparring match and felt compelled to give both your heads a shake. 
---
But you have a point, my input was not really needed.
---
F
---
Ar you on ps4?
---
Loot, scrap or sell everything
---
What kinda shotgun you running with ? I tried an explosive one i found but I swear the monsters were healing throu it
---
Do all the missions first
---
Anti armor combat, im currently looking for an anti armor Explosive combat but im not that lucky
---
you ask for advice, but you're butthurt when people reply? 
---
what exactly did you expect posting this
---
Idk if the explosives work bro i swear it's like it does a ton of dmg snd then it rewinds the health back like it didn't do it.
---
You on PC?
---
Well like i said i havent found one yet but my normal combat shotgun didnt do anything, i have all shotgunner perks and Enforcer 3 and the ant didnt cripple once. I have better odds crippling the tail on a scorched beast
---
Yup, happens in workshops too.
---
So the point of the post was ?
---
nukacrypt
---
We've been defending them since oblivion, some since morrowind and even arena. For me, I stopped defending them when ESO came out, I knew they would stop making single player games and only make dlcs. It's more profitable that way. And fallout 4 was so bland. The construction wasn't even original idea, and it was crudely designed.
---
Is the kids name Black+Cat or is that the hacker? I'd like to give him my unused strangler set.
---
I am a PC player. I feel the same as you. Not bad enough that it stops me from spending the extra money each month for super junk storage and atom points. Cheaper than a movie.
---
I recently moved my camp closer to Vault 76 to give a hand up to new players who may have received the game for the holidays. Guess what? Lots of new players...and we are building community. Keep it up.
---
From this lonely wanderer, thanks for the original poster‚Äôs words and sentiments. Merry Christmas.
---
I launched my first nuke at lvl 35
---
The kid is Black+Cat. Be warned I have not spoken with him. This could be a carefully engineered hoax done to get people to give donations. 
---
I do know the lead guy preforming the operation. He sells weapons and armor for both caps and real world money
---
Absolutely agree.
---
Can we get some confirmation that Bethesda is going to act before this drops? It‚Äôs almost like they want this game to die. Even if it‚Äôs just this guy fear mongering they need to communicate that to this community.
---
It really is insane the flip flop between posts. On this sub the post is either venerating the game and the playerbase as literal Jesus. Or it's a post bitching about how literal dogshit the actual game is.
---
The worst part is that we are starting to see the same practices bleed into other games now too. MtGA is starting to have ridiculously priced events that people have been begging them to make just regular things.
---
That is just the most disgusting behavior I've ever seen.. hope he gets what coming to him
---
I was told manta man works as unstoppable and sleepwear.
---
The new twitch suit is also formal. Orety good for a dapper suit that is free.
---
I don't think the kid is a scammer.. that is genuine crying
---
Servers dont crash in private worlds :)
---
Don't go and watch the full video, stop it and report (This is child abuse btw) - watching the entire video gives them ad revenue, and this kind of youtuber needs to be removed... from the internet if at all possible.
---
That was terrible. 
---
I dont know if it was staged or not, but that kid was suffering for sure.
---
Why?
---
I had major issues with crashing (on xbox), it made the game unplayable. Quit playing for a year thinking I would give them time to patch the bugs etc. 
---
Started a new character recently and had the same issues with crashing, was tempted to throw it in for good. Then we changed our internet provider (had issues with our wifi speed for a while) and bought a signal extender. Works near perfect now, still have the odd crash but nowhere near as frequent and frustrating as before. Plus I usually get a server not responding warning before it drops out completely so I know not to do anything such as reading plans etc.
---
Weird, but good to know, thank you
---
I guess It wouldn't be Bethesda if it didn't have weird glitches, lol. Ty
---
There's an option to turn off player name's in the game's Settings - if you do this everyone will appear as Player
---
Oh damn. Thanks! Somehow clicked that at some point
---
The perp in the video is BodegaTheKid, the same guy who led a gang to steal from 500 plus people with the hack last week.
---
Nope, they're not. Also why do you attack people for not having the same opinion..?
---
Is there a plant next to the wall? Sometimes the surroundings just grow into my camp, I even had a tree once coming through the floor. Maybe that kills the wallpaper.
---
People that respond to things 'THEY' don't like this way, do u truly believe any woman, deserves that kinda bs?
---
People like this need to stay AWAY from other people. Online AND in real life.
---
Yup
---
I have difficulty standing by this opinion, but I still believe it: the guy might not be we'll adjusted in his hatred, the action itself might be illegal by legal interpretation, but he's doing the same general service for players as a whistleblower or a white hat.
---
The ONLY difference is he is benefitting from thr hack. But publicizing himself, sharing the hack code? I have to believe he is making a statemebt and forcing Bethesda's hand.
---
They wouldn't accept help of people who were building the community and support for the game. Bug notes from the plauers were being ignored, or fixes were coming at a pace that compared to tech savvy players who cpuld mod the repairs in tbemselves were too slow.
---
So you force them to fix something by exposing and forcing the vulnerabilities. You damage their reputation but they did that to themselves over and over this year.
---
And while I believe in having mercy on people and understanding there are hamstringing issues that happen behind the scenes I also believe in holding people and companies accountable to behavior.
---
This just seems effective.i hate it bevause i disagree with the means but its effective
---
I like to study how much of a waste of sweat and sperm you really are.
---
Another tip for placing down items in pre-existing structures where the camp items would otherwise float, intersect, require support, or teleport elsewhere upon placement: try using blueprints. 
---
Build all your objects somewhere else in your camp, individually blueprint each one, store them, THEN try to put the items down via those blueprints. It‚Äôs finicky and doesn‚Äôt work all the time, but it‚Äôs allowed me to build in places that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt permit [all this clutter](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/B9a5sog)
---
CE-34878 is basically a really fancy way of saying the PS4 ran out of available memory and the OS performed a memory dump.
---
Programs use bits of memory to store data. When that memory is spent the program is supposed to release that memory back into the pool of available memory so the OS and other programs can use it. Fallout 76 doesn't release its  spent memory beck to the pool. It tires to recycle/reuse that memory it has but the poor programming of the program itself doesn't do this. It insteads hoards spent memory and then requests the CPU to give it more memory.
---
So to avoid a crash and data loss the CPU gives 76 more memory to use. 76 will do this until there is no more memory the CPU can give to Fallout 76. Then the PS4 runs out of memory and has no more to give the CPU will force a program crash and reclaim that memory from 76 by performing a memory dump and put that reclaimed memory back into the pool of available memory.
---
These crashes usually happens at the point where 76 needs memory but the PS4 has no more to give and its usually at major parts of the game such as launching a nuke, learning plans, crafting of any kind, accessing any vendor including the scrip machine, and going into new cells you haven't been in during this play session.
---
I hope my explanation was useful. Usually what I try to do is if im going to the main menu for any reason and the games been running for awhile I just close the app and restart it.
---
I just shot milk out my nose üëç
---
Can we report the scammers to Bethesda and get them banned, they are cancer to the community.
---
I usually have something snarky to say, but what a genuine scumbag that dude is being to the kid.
---
Is this the same person as "erectban" on the unknown cheats forum? Obviously, there is always a chance of more exploits being found, but one has more reason to take these kinds of threats seriously if they come from someone actually developing hacks.
---
performance on ps4 non-pro is cancer 
---
fps drops, bugged out smoke from generators even though smoke from smoke machine looks perfectly fine and no lag when nearby, this so-called 'light effect' looks like part of the screen brightness is set to 200% etc 
---
optimisation is needed
---
Just made a mule that's level 2.
---
Gonna trade my gifts over see if get something new.
---
Been getting trash last week or so,  not even good duplicates.
---
Back to private worlds for me then and also fuck this little bitch deserves to be beaten and castrated
---
Yeah but paying $100 a year for a game to not crash is shitty standards, don't you think?
---
stealing people's weapons with hacks
---
They don't care, they want to enrage people into buying Fo1st
---
What's selfish about wanting a game to be released in a professional, competent state?
---
PC?
---
if you're still playing this shitheap game it's on you really
---
He‚Äôs a scumbag but he won‚Äôt be getting any revenue, not enough subs and overall views.  YT changed the rules a few years back
---
I mean, something similar sure, but not exactly that
---
lol
---
Are you saying all this security mess is actually good for Bethesda? Do you know its their fault these cheats are live in the first place?
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be a jerk. I just want to make sure you know that it‚Äôs ‚Äúmust have‚Äù.
---
This is your first post here, good one.
---
This sounds like horse shit to me.  I doubt you ever played the game.
---
I had a base at the same location. Have not played in a few months, logged in a few days ago and saw how the fuckers deleted my base i spend hours working on. It was the best base i ever build even bought the mothman building pack for it...  
---
I was so disapointed that i logged into my other char just to see that they nerfed the shit out of my pistol vats crit build. This build was pretty strong and alot of fun now i can not get the crit meter full and they nerfed my two shot explosive+ crit dmg weapon into the ground it seems.
---
After a few game crashes i gave up and probably wont log in for a while. :'(
---
Go fight me gusties
---
Welcome to the sub, great first post.
---
There's a location literally called deathclaw island. With one, low level deathclaw. Lame.
---
I still think it'd be nice to have servers that are buffed across the board. Bring forest, Ash and toxic valley enemies up to around lvl 50 and Mire and Bog enemies up to around 100.
---
Oh right, yes i understand now. It took me a while. Made a grammar mistake. Thank you :)
---
Oh there is nothing wrong with that. He just seemed like he didn't want people to play/support fallout 76. Like I said the game is so much fun and it would suck for some people to miss out on it.
---
Yes, there should be more spawns for them. I agree. That sounds like a good idea, especially for high Level players, giving them more of a challenge. But for the low Levels...they may struggle! :)
---
The PC Master race! Where every game is subject to the abilities of a sweaty 13yr old Korean boy.
---
Of course, it's part and parcel with being PC masterrace.
---
I was level 200+ by the time I got round to I Am Become Death, there's heaps to do beside the main questline
---
Kinda cool though. Turrets actually defending your camp is rarer than a 3 star bloodied fixer.
---
They give lots of xp and the necessary tools, plans and access to buildings
---
Yep is it a real nice sound to wack a bitch with a shovel in this game. 
---
(Kinda hope there will be shovel skins one day)
---
It is a troll see the post history.. :(
---
Yeah its either do the main quest line straight, or just wander around and gain xp. 
---
I need to jump back on solo and give it another chance. 
---
I find I always run out of bullets right now.
---
It was already confirmed that there will be a "normalization" of some sort coming with Wastelanders, with the aim of leveling the field between low and high level players, especially at events. While no explanation was given regarding how this is planned to work in practice, I speculate it could involve reworking the enemy level scaling system to make it instanced to each player. That is, making enemy spawns "static" (they can still be randomized, but what you get does not depend on another player's level, which is one of the frustrating aspects of FO76 to new players), but simulating different levels per player. This involves decoupling enemy levels from their type and variant (e.g. a charred feral ghoul is no longer guaranteed to be level 62, but rather could be anything from level 30 to 200, and even different for two players looking at the same ghoul at the same time), and for each player, scaling the creature's incoming and outgoing damage, as well as DR and ER, XP, loot, etc., according to a leveling curve. And different tables can be used depending on the circumstances, whether you are just exploring a random place, an instanced location, or are playing a regular event, or a public event.
---
Of course, all the above is speculation, and might be completely wrong, it just seems feasible to implement, in line with the stated goals, and other multiplayer games may already have similar systems. In practice, it could even be something very simple, like gradually moving the difficulty slider in Skyrim from "novice" to "legendary" as the player levels from, say, 1 to 200. In other words, damage multipliers calculated from the player's level.
---
Plenty around here.
---
The damage cap in PvP is 110 per shot, so the extra damage you‚Äôre getting from Nerd Rage is worthless for PvP. Serendipity and some legendary armor effects might help a little, but ultimately, filling your health bar before PvP is the only thing that‚Äôs going to make you less squishy.

Never thought I'd say it but I miss being terrified by Deathclaws

Yep, my PS4 controller has seen some major league velocity flights straight into the couch thanks to this game. Fortunately the controllers are tough little bastards!
---
Nice.  launched my first at 140 something.  tried at 120 something and lost my big gun after exiting security console.  had that gun more than 80 levels was heartbroken.  second try, had a new gun, but much pucker factor until launch.   well done!

Scrap box is the solution to the biggest FAKE problem of the game.
---
never forget the FAKE part.
---
Maintenance shutdown happens, it's not a failure. What they can do is warn us beforehand, like.... 2 days upfront. This thing are usually scheduled.
---
the inventory stealer that got released was a different method than the one he is using, thats why his hack is still working
---
Same as the Nuka World Handmade skins, there‚Äôs 3 there in the files just going unused
---
Because as it turns out a large corporation promising one thing and then giving people something else can be upsetting regardless of what is given.
---
Totally agree, I hunted for an IE hunting rifle forever. I may find better guns but it‚Äôs just to cool to not use, and if you can find an EE or EFF handmade to back it up you‚Äôre really in the money haha. I‚Äôd still be very happy with a little bump in damage tho
---
Instigating crossbows are very useable too, I have a limb damage one and it easily one shots pretty much anything.
---
I mean if the price is right..
---
Because everything is being run with corporate greed in mind now. Why give people a good product when you can make more money off of a shitty one?
---
Just asking, it wouldn't be the first time something got patched out, and someone still tries to jump on the "oh woe is me, give me free stuff" bandwagon. This reddit is crazy.
---
Sucks, wonder why the patch didn't work.
---
Was hoping to get 3k but I might just use it as a battening chip incase someone has the right gun I'm looking for
---
If the effect is to monetize griefing and hacking by driving people to his You Tube channel then, yes, this jerk is effective. Regardless of the game, system, or situation, creating or exacerbating an existing issue so that it has to be solved immediately does not make someone a hero. Don't forget the fact that they could have returned the taken items after their point was made. They didn't. The means matters. And the only effect, in this case is, the developers scrambled to fix a single problem that was previously unexploited. During the holidays. This did nothing to help fix the larger issues.
---
maybe have team of three go hunting for fourth hider.  get a little exp.  they will still get points if the rest of us warriors win??!!!   i have gone into matches with level 3, 6, me and, 97.  the 97 spawns in other side of map, and newbies into the airport.  i spawn in with them knowing its gonna be a short match, but i die trying to protect my team.  97 hides in a bush and lives much longer, but has no honor...
---
Nah, you haven't paid the troll toll so.
---
Haha smart
---
Personally, I think it's pretty sad that so many people are truly &amp; deeply hurt over a video game.
---
It's 'Oh, no.. my precious video game and all the fantasies in my head have been ruined and my life is over'. When, in reality, it's more like 'I have no life and I need to stay away from video games so I can go get a life, interact with real people in the real world, then things like this wouldn't bother me because it's just a video game'.
---
Bring on the the downvotes. You can't admit it for so many reasons, but everyone knows that within this community.. downvotes hold more validity.
---
Personal attacks don't help your case here. Yes, we should blame the hacker for ripping people off. Yes, we can also blame Bethesda for allowing a game to go live on an engine that has a history of being heavily modded and altered. Creation engine modders envisioned these exact problems with hacks before F76 even released but Bethesda brushed them off by saying the modders were wrong or that their game was not hackable. Bethesda clearly didn't implement the safeguards to prevent the sort of widespread hacking we have seen over the last few months, and for that, they absolutely hold all of the blame. 
---
There is a saying "don't hate the player, hate the game". Bethesda setup the game in a state that is easily hackable. Some nefarious players are just taking advantage of that
---
It‚Äôs kind of the point for you to have to look for him, that‚Äôs why he sells some of the rarer stuff
---
Or just play good games....
---
It's victim blaming, the OP was subtle in this in his OP, but it is clear to see that he is in fact blaming the players for playing a game that has been hacked.
---
what about 1 xp per 1% hp damage to the other player?
---
 you still get that 100 xp, but if done like that people may not be so thirst happy.  (and it would play into "assist" points like a past thread wanted)
---
More likely they will try to fix it, break camps in the process, release that "fix" then have to revert it to before the fix.
---
Me too! I want them to be scary...they should and need to be. They are the most terrifying creature in Appalachia, but yet so weak.

---
We can mouse over and slide the bar. I tried typing it in for the longest time
---
I wish this game was offline single player
---
Yes this is Reddit, we don't attack, we downvote into oblivion.
---
That really doesn't make sense. Every single game has hackers, hackers don't hate a game they hack, they are just lazy jackasses who want an easy advantage over others. That is why NW has so many hacks compared to adventure.
---
If they hated this game so bad and were out to ruin it then why would the hacker warn Bethesda before the hack was released with a full write up of the hack and how to fix it? 
---

Unironically the bugs. They make me appreciate real life even more; they make me thank mother nature for fine tuning a world that prevents me from just casually falling through the ground or getting murked by some t-posing wildlife.
---
The concrete defense walls can snap together. Build your structure than use those. They are a major pain in the butt though, especially if you go large but ive also seen them stacked. Otherwise use the brick walls and put the white part facing out.

traceylorris1971  just mic up and mention reddit.  i usually don't accept distance invites unless you message me.  too many people looking to exploit otherwise.

It doesn't matter.  People like this get off on sheer view counts and comments too.  Just having their name plastered about makes them happy.  Psychopaths aren't wired like normal people are.  There is something deeply wrong with them, mentally, and normal logic doesn't apply.
---
The defensive walls are great but are a pita to place on uneven ground and take up a ton of camp budget. The brick wall idea is not ideal, it‚Äôs more white not that concrete grey. I might just stick with metal walls

And how was your blatantly necessary comment contributing to the discussion? How's the spectator's seat? Is it comfortable? Would you like some eggnog? I would.
---
In all seriousness, I was addressed with a non-argument towards my original post. So I participated with non-arguments.. to both of your detriments.. I suppose? Honestly.. I'm deeply sorry that this wasn't to your liking. I'll do better next time, taking the appropriate measures to ensure that I respond to every single post in reference to me with less witty banter and more.. "intelligible" responses. As deserved. :)
---
However, if you have something you'd like to debate about, i'm all ears. We can talk about why I disagree with OP, if you have any interesting counter-arguments. I won't be an asshole. I swear.
---
I was talking about the people that hate 76, not the hacker himself. He gives fuel to haters of 76 to continue their quest to trash talk this game, in order to try and financially hurt bethesda. 
---
Watch this sub every single update, and you'll see them come out of the woodwork to trash talk the game and claim it's broken. AFTER. EVERY. UPDATE. 
---
Hell, I saw one post claiming the update broke the game, the day before the update released. 
---
You know the ones, they've been playing since 6 months before beta, they've logged more hours than is actually humanly possible, and they've uninstalled the game at least 7 times at this point.
---
You could put the concrete barriers down and use the large tent. Then maybe the warehouse walls to create a garage for your power armor stations

---
Thx, added, I am DaveBlazko, would be really appreciated
---
Thanks for the heads up. I had this on my ps4 and Bethesda message says it's hard drive and reset etc and so does Sony site. Got a pro now and it's still happening. Only this game though.
---
I have a vampire explosive gatling laser and you can withstand 10 shots without fireproof or dense chest.
---
Amen, brother
---
Bethesda haven't fixed the problem...
---
All they have been doing since launch is reacting and patching out the latest hack of the week the problem is F76 dreadful netcode and lack of any proper cheat detection/prevention... After a year of problems being caused by this Bethesda has shown no sign of willingness to even attempt to fix the problem.
---
It's all about Bethesdas magic mutated carrot, that God Howard keeps sticking in there assess. Lmao!
---
That's just sad... Really sad.
---
Yeah thats been happening a lot i have lost a lot of plans cause of crashing
---
Quantum spamming isn‚Äôt exclusive to Bloodied builds. 
---
The fact that you came on here looking for advice on how to make your Bloodied build more survivable shows you don‚Äôt know everything there is to know about the build type and the PvP meta. 
---
Perhaps instead of dismissing what people are saying, you actually keep an open mind and engage in a dialogue?
---
*If you know everything already...* ***why did you make this post?***
---
Okay so go and farm things for 500 fucking hours just so a kid can take it all in 5 seconds and then tell me who's being a bitch. Also, you fucking ask for downvotes, quit being a jerk and you wont be downvoted. Its that simple.
---
Did this happen yesterday? If so, I was in that match and it was hilarious. (I obviously didn't make it out in time.)
---
When my wife saw the radius of the blast over the current safe zone, her comment was "that crazy bastard."
---
They are not flagged as Atom Shop, and as such can be traded or sold.
---
If you're not going to play the game, why the @#$% do you even care what **other people** do when it doesn't affect you?
---
Well, add me at Littleol79 . I will have finished my challenges in 2 or 3 hours. I can sell as much as you want for even less than 1k.
---
Is the game different on our platform than it is for the PS4 guys?  
---
Wait, our Bloodied Teslas do an extra 25% damage, that was in the last patch. I forgot about that. 
---
/s
---
They're not. Ive been selling a dozen of NW caps for 500 caps each. Crazy how much caps people are ready to spend on that game.
---
He is. He most definitely is.
---
&gt;Would you trust a "fix" a hacker sent you? I sure as hell wouldn't.
---
When it is a write up on the hack and the way to fix it without sending any files? Yes I'd trust it as I'd be able to look into my code and see the issue and see if the fix they sent actually is a fix. Most major online games do that.
---
&gt; It's most likely a code for ransomware. I get it, you're on the side of the hacker.
---
How does just sending a report ticket = ransomware? Do you even know what you are talking about or just repeating shit you've heard on CSI? 
---
To send ransomware they'd have to send it in a package that the victim would have to download and execute the payload. 
---
It is also hilarious you think I support hackers, I don't. I just find it hilarious that bethesda had the fix to this hack nearly 4 days before it went public and they did nothing with it.
---
&gt;Either way, if you don't like the game, there's an easy solution for you. DON'T PLAY IT. 
---
Where did I say I don't like the game? You are making a whole lot of baseless assumptions about things you know nothing about.
---
&gt;I simply don't see the obsession haters have with trying to convince everyone else to hate this game too. I personally like the game. 
---
Pointing out bethesdas major fuck ups isn't "hating the game" it is more along the lines of "not ignoring the screw ups from bethesda with this game". Do you also feel that the criticism Anthem got was unwarranted also, or is it only games YOU like that aren't allowed to be criticized?
---
Astros guy not Astro guy. Although I do love NASA considering I grew up a few steps from Johnson Space Center. 
---
So either way you‚Äôre close enough. Upvote it is.
---
Abso----ing-lutely!!!!
---
Bethesda and this community was told about 3 days before the inventory hack went live that is was going to go public....
---
The issue with F76 according to the hackers and modders is that the netcode used is very basic laughable even and the engine was designed to be modded add ontop the fact there is no detection/tamper software (anti-cheat) running on F76 the only thing Bethesda can do is wait for hacks to go public see what it is and patch out that exploit then check their basic log system to try and restore missing items etc.
---
Bethesda have shown no signs that they are willing or even able to fix the problem so looks like people will just have to accept this is how its going to be on PC.
---
Oh got one more don‚Äôt light up the build object green if you‚Äôre not gonna let me place it there, don‚Äôt get my hopes up only to find out I actually can‚Äôt place it there
---
SYNTHS !
---
Same ways dude. I realized it by mistake after months of playing.... "WTF?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! wow I'm such a degenerate"
---
I think someone likes attention, and should be ignored unless they produce something actionable.
---
That's like saying this apple is really good if you don't mind eating around the worms.  The worms make the apple bad.
---
Thanks for sharing your viewpoint. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Log out and back in, it may have returned.
---
Dang, I‚Äôve attempted one but ended up scrapping the idea. That was in the hills though and I got frustrated with the uneven ground. I‚Äôm going to try again but on a road though
---
If a game is good in every aspect except for one, does that make it a bad game? I don't think it does. But clearly 3 people disagree with me.
---
Do I think they meant for these to be shared? No. These were the most difficult NW rewards to obtain so far (based on sheer amount of XP needed). 
---
I know a lot of people didn‚Äôt have time to grind xp on a video game over the holidays, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving them away. Cheers!
---
The winter clothes too?
---
It‚Äôs in the photo I posted. Yes.
---
The way the level-up system works is your banked perks slots at the **LOWEST** level of expenditure until they are gone.  So if you just hit level 45, the game looks at you as if you are level 42 until you've spent those banked slots.
---
Looks like the clothes are just marked costume but the hat is marked formal , so it probably worked for challenges that required just 1 piece of formal
---
https://imgur.com/a/irqpyrS
---
The Hat works but some challenges like this weekly require 2 pieces whereas others only required 1:   https://imgur.com/a/irqpyrS
---
I think this is hilarious and rightfully deserved for a company that took my money, lied, and never fixed the game. They deserve to be sabotaged and honestly I wouldn't doubt if this person is doing it because he felt like he got screwed over too. You know for a fact that Bethesda will never fix these vulnerabilities.
---
Personally I rather have limb damage over explosive for a couple reasons. One is I don't want to run demolition expert. Two is explosive weapons need to be repaired way more often.  Three is the limb damage is helpful for big enemies that I cant single shot or I shoot while out of stealth.  A shot or two to a leg and they are limping giving me extra time.  Personal preference of course.
---
Oh...all i see is the beanie. Any idea when youll be on again?
---
Try a semi auto handmade or lever action rifle. Faster rate of fire than a hunting rifle which leads to much higher dps. 
---
But if you find an instigating hunting rifle (double damage when target is at full health) you usually will only have to shoot once! Haha
---
A lever action, throw in the quad legendary effect n ur set
---
Stalking children is a bit much. He‚Äôs just targeting any players
---
Since they can be traded got an extra pair?
---
Given that this "one" aspect is a whole lexicon of bugs, exploits, bugs that randomly get brought back into existence at the drop of a hat along with major ones existing since launch...
---
*Yeah that does make the game pretty bad.* I'm convinced this game is only really surviving at this point due to the IP. Anything else would have been forgotten.
---
It keeps saying server disconnected whenever I try to join you via Xbox menu???
---
Click the link or the photo it has three photos in it. 
---
I‚Äôll be at the Texans game all day today so probably not online until late. Then several times throughout the week. Add me and find me when I‚Äôm on!
---
Eh? I can still shoot off the cores.... Or is that because I use an explosive rifle?
---
Yeah i didnt click the link, my bad. But i will! Whats ur GT, same as on here?
---
Some cards go to level 5, some start at level 2, to get all cards you need to collect about 1126 levels to have every level of every card. If you want just the max level of each card it is about 564...this is provided you have randomly received all cards while leveling up.
---
i had a similar issue a couple days ago. xbox reboot fixed it. not sure if its the same problem tho
---
I see a lot of confusion around this whole situation so here is what seemingly happened: there were talks about the inventory steal cheat and ErectBan was posting about it. Someone (one of those dataminers previously banned) took what was known and tried to get it working in game - was successful. During the week before the cheat became widespread this was submitted to Bethesda with a write up on how to fix it and do it. Several days later the cheat becomes widespread
---
I hope we meet if you play Xbox.
---
Ps4 so definitely wasn't you then but you had copycats
---
Got it.
---
I play on PS4 , maybe on pc is better I don‚Äôt know :(
---
Dude, go clutch pearls elsewhere.
---
The moral of this story is, Bethesda is a corporate entity, and  we as the players choose to play the role of the" Donkey". 
---
If God Howard was to tell you too jump off a bridge would you.  Probably not, right!
---
 But if God Howard made it look like you were going to get something in return for jumping off that bridge, you might take the risk and do it. 
---
It's all a dirty corporate game of manipulation. Look at how the game dynamics work, it's all based on psychology, we keep grinding to level up, because it's human nature to want to be the best player, we all want to have bragging rights, we all want to be number one.  
---
I fell for this trap, so did so many others. I remember seeing the pre launch video and ran out to buy the game and all the extras I could before release. $300 CAD later, hook, line, and sinker. 
---
They managed to manipulate my thoughts on the game before launch and suckered me in with a Video. 
---
Game launch, day one, wow this is  not as great as the pre launch Video, what did I just pay for?
---
 Well I spent all this money I guess I will make the best of it.
---
 3 months in, wow I really like that power armor skin, so now because  I want  to  stand out above  the rest, I  will spend the 1800 atoms, now I am out of atoms, but I  really want that  cool camp set up, because I want my camp to stand out above the rest. I guess I will spend another $50 CAD on more atoms. 
---
It's all smoke and mirrors my friends, Bethesda, praise on our weaknesses, because they can. And we are venerable and let them. 
---
This whole game is based on human psychology inside the game, and out side of the game. I wouldn't put it past them to be using subliminal words, sounds, and colors to help you make your choices easier, when it comes to you giving your hard earned money away. 
---
Another examples of how they are manipulating your mind, they make daily, and weekly challenges more of an annoyances, and  tedious, so you would rather enjoy the game play and give them your money for atoms. Also look at how the Atomic shop is staged with pictures that makes it more appealing to you, and it grabs your attention, and makes you think I need that. Also how the currency is marketed up to hundreds, apposed to the dollars amount it is equivalent to. 
---
Same goes for the Fallout 1st membership, one big line off shit to keep you thinking this going to give me a one up over other players. 
---
Again manipulating your mind based on basic principles of psychology. Because it human nature to keep up with the Jones. If your neighbor puts in a a new asphalt driveway, you one up him and put in exposed concrete driveway. 
---
This how the corporate games work! 
---
So before you become a sucker, remember these simple words. 
---
Stop 
---
Think
---
Observe 
---
Plan 
---
This message was brought to you by the better business Bureau of Appalachia.

I am a veteran of getting carrots stuck in my ass, so I  thought maybe this could help prevent carrot ass syndrome.

Your answer is not useful -.-

Good for you :(
---
- Stick to the forest until you are more comfortable.
---
- Stick to the main quest at first and do all side quests in the forest at first.
---
- Pick up everything and scrap it or sell it. Don‚Äôt hold too much junk, bulk and sell it instead.
---
- If you see someone selling serums for 100 caps each buy a bunch. You can sell them to vendors for 250 caps minimum (up to 500 each depending on your charisma). 
---
- Try to max out the 1400 caps per day vendor limit. 
---
- Don‚Äôt buy guns or any expensive things from robot vendors. 
---
- Try to focus your build on one type of weapon (melee, heavy guns, semi-automatic rifle, full-automatic rifle, pistol, etc). In my opinion automatic rifle build is the most powerful of the ranged options.
---
From the discord I'm in that's mostly ps4 players they blue screen at least 2-3 times a play session.
---
That's like saying an electric car is good in every aspect except it can only drive a hundred feet without being recharged.
---
In theory, it's a good game. In execution, it's a shit show. A shit show I still play regularly, but a shit show nonetheless.
---
Oh, and don‚Äôt take any workshops. People will just come and kill you. Only do that if you have fallout 1st and a private world.
---
I hate the ‚ÄúBethesda fixed it the same day‚Äù people. No. No they didn‚Äôt. The hack wasn‚Äôt popularized until that Monday, but they were well warned at least a week in advance but chose to do nothing.
---
Only when shit hit the fan did they decide to move on this hack, they didn‚Äôt care about you PC players and I doubt renewed reports will do anything until shit hits the fan again.
---
that‚Äôs my take, downvote away
---
Sent a fr!
---
I had Cat 5 cable running to my xb1 because wifi is too slow for it with everyone else at home so I got cat 6 or 7 and it helped a bunch.
---
I now crash about two or three times a day. Two times I‚Äôd say is game bugs and once is server
---
Yep.  Repeat after me:  actual damages.
---
You *can* sue anyone for anything (in the US).  What you will have the possibility of winning in a suit is actual damages - monetary loss.  Other damages exist, but rarely are damages awarded for being afraid, and being afraid of a tiny chance of losing virtual goods with no monetary value...yeah a judge isn't going to go along with that.
---
That aside, BGS wouldn't be responsible for the situation, the actual thief is the one that is at fault here.  If you could successfully sue *anyone* in this, it is the hacker, not the game.
---
In my opinion you‚Äôre better off running a full health junkies build. Bloodied is higher damage, but you‚Äôre essentially a glass cannon.
---
And when release was the B.E.T.A. without that tag on it, there's a problem. Should never have been released in the state it was.
---
To be fair, you didn't really ask a very useful question. They answered what you asked, at least.
---
I love how this guy is getting downvoted for basically saying that Bethesda needs to get their shit together.
---
This is proof that you sheeple deserve this.
---
It's a monster if you put the right mods on it kinda like an automatic explosive shotgun without the nerf
---
I think it‚Äôs a deliberate attack against the users and Bethesda by some miserable scumbags. Leave people alone, this is why we can‚Äôt have nice things. Go find some other hobby, like f‚Äôing yourself instead of other people.
---
I hate those nasty, honking bastards. Explosive shotgun
---
It‚Äôs been happening to me frequently. Power armor in my inventory and in my stash are affected.
---
Any sort of sniper really as long as it looks cool and doesn‚Äôt take up 50% of the screen like some guns do in first person
---
When that update happened I lost my X01 calibrated shocks and entirely lost the left or right arm I can‚Äôt remember which, for me the update caused more problems than it fixed. What was it even trying to fix anyways?

Well , it's not like Bethesda have'nt lied before or anything right? ü§î
---
Why nerf one build to the ground but my bloodied melee build is still op? I dont get it. "And just redo your build" nice joke if there is no good cave around and all the work is lost. Whats the big metal door with the number lock for anyway?
---
I don't think I could stomach using no Legendary gear.  I mean, I basically get that from Lv. 1-20 already, and those levels are a drag.  I must apparently play a rather high-energy game normally, because I'm constantly out-of-breath as a low-level.
---
Haha well you‚Äôre in for some fun! I‚Äôm sure you already know but Bloodied Handmades and Lever Guns are a blast for Commando/Rifleman specialization. I still haven‚Äôt gotten a bloodied lever but the executioners effect was definitely enough to make it my go-to rifle. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the explosive/silencer combo which makes it so satisfying.
---
Im honestly right about to dropping my shotgun - it‚Äôs only good for a medium range which is the time when I switch from rifle to melee.
---
&gt; that anyone on your friends list can join without  invite as well.
---
Only if you have the server set to to open. If you have it set to group only, only people you are actively grouped up with can join.
---
They took my camp location months ago and did nothing with the area....sucks being homeless..I slept in a friend's generator room till I found a new spot...
---
You make my old bat cave build look like squatters rights
---
Commando especially vats crit sneak build is highly valuable. You could benefit by creating a new character out of the vault and making that your heavy build. Transfer using your own character to character trainstation medical bag, fo1st private world preferably, some shielded underarmor, chosen armor and weapons, supplies from your current commando build. There are many benefits to creating and managing multiple characters.
---
Oh cool thank you üòé
---
I‚Äôm actually gonna be using the perfect storm got a lvl 50 one and i like the fire effect. Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs actually useful with the time it takes to respec!
---
It's the first item under the misc building tab (furthest right) iirc. Only usable at workshops however.
---
Damn I wish we had these for our camps
---
Logic doesn't apply to psychopaths.
---
Your paranoid
---
I‚Äôm sorry but your understanding of the situation/timeline isn‚Äôt totally accurate. 
---
People also bash this game because they are still hurt about the game releasing not-as-expected and continually falling for every hype machine trick out there.
---
Looks fairly stress free. And starting 1/1 they are suppose to be consistently easier on a daily basis so I'm looking forward to what kind of challenges they put out.
---
I dunno man, the dailies on 10/12/19 were pretty easy. Maybe a tie? I‚Äôll call it a tie.
---
That's an oddly specific date. Made me literally laugh out loud :)
---
Now that‚Äôs fast and friendly service!
---
Can I add you? I‚Äôd love to get my hands on the beanie!
---
Haha I‚Äôm glad. Cause I was totally bs-ing for the lolz. I agree today‚Äôs are pretty darn quick to complete. Cheers!
---
Definitely seems like there‚Äôs a dedicated cadre who won‚Äôt / don‚Äôt play who are here for the sole purpose of spreading misinformation and to shit on the actual player base
---
Yes but I only like to give them away in sets so you have to take both. Plus they match!
---
Yes we already have an mg42, lets get an m1 garand and ppsh and dat mother fucking mauser ( Chinese pistol in fallout 3)
---
That‚Äôs fine by me, I‚Äôll add you! Is there a specific time we can meet?
---
Lever action and gauss rifles are really good. Semi-autos are normally really good, but if you spec into commando you can end up having a much higher DPS than if you spec into semi autos
---
Bethesda customer support actually understands and is empathetic to our problems, it's just that they can't nor want to do anything at all about them
---
Who profit from that abuse ? Who are the competitors ?
---
I disagree with the analogy and the distance used in it.
---
I wonder if the performance differs from user to user and I just don't get it as bad as others then. Because other than crashing maybe once a week, I don't really run into any issues. I've never had a vault run or a nuke run go out on me - and the way you hear people talk they would have me believe its a 50/50 chance of success vs crash. You hear stories of people getting hacked but I wonder what % of people it actually affects. 
---
I've never been hacked. I've never had anything disappear or lose a star. I've never really lost anything at all.
---
I mean sometimes an enemy will spawn frozen in place and can't be killed, and I did see some scorchbeast corpses fall out of the sky for no reason a while back, but other than that..
---
I'm even open to the possibility I am too oblivious or unaware to realize a bug is happening, but..
---
From my end there just seems to be very little issues. Maybe it's all about perspective, I have no other way to understand it at this point.
---
So quick in fact I'll wait til the last 30 minutes tomorrow morning to complete them for the thrill of the challenge lol
---
don't worry, bethesda's got you. It'll only cost 1,000 atoms and you must be part of Fallout 1st
---
Hmmm. I‚Äôm busy most of today at the Texans game, but add me anyway. I‚Äôll be on a lot this coming week. We shall get you this beanie!! (And outfit!)
---
Barbarian/Ironclad have greatly diminishing returns on damage mitigation once you have decent armor. You'd definitely get more survivability out of lifegiver than Ironclad. Unless you specifically want to use unarmed, you get more milage out of 3 rank 1 damage cards for one of the other melee types than ironfist. I use ironfist and 3 rank 1 gladiator cards because both affect the meathook.
---
There's more, but bloodied gear basically comes down to adrenal reaction, Unyielding, and bloody weapon with damage perks. You'll be able to solo all content except for the Imposter Sheepsquatch and protecting all 3 animals at Arktos Pharma.
---
If I'm not going full minmax I run Unstoppable Monster with Iron Fist and travelling pharmacy because I carry around 600 pounds of chems at any given time.
---
I‚Äôm gonna lol at you if you forget
---
Thanks for trying to clear the air sage. 
---
So much misinformation &amp; BS on this one - I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve had more then your fill by now.
---
That's dope my Captain!
---
The hackers who keep doing this are assholes, i think anyone can agree with that. But people keep cutting Bethesda a little too much slack in my opinion.
---
I'm not sure if BGS has ever ran a live service game before, but this is not the way to do it. 
---
* BR mode has been a hack infested playground for months and there's still no anti cheat. The most they do is hand out temporary bans.
---
* Exploits existed and were reported in beta that made their way into launch of the game that Bethesda took forever to fix.
---
* Anyone remember those 1-2 months where the game was dupe-pocalypse? I know they said they removed most of  those items, but i can guarantee you a ton of them are still in circulation. And how soon were they made aware of those exploits? And again only when shit hit the fan and people had millions of pieces of items did they finally do something about it.
---
* And then there are the EXP exploits. I remember the recent one happened, got reported, and then they instead of fixing it wen ahead with their plan to introduce double EXP weekend. Then finally 3 weeks later the EXP exploit was fixed.
---
BGS is incredibly slow with exploiters and hackers, but could not be faster when it comes to atom shop changes.
---
But to be fair, there was a nugget of truth in the "fear ploy."  The exploit was live and people were getting their stuff taken.  Stuff that, as far as I know, Bethesda still hasn't tried to make right in any specific way.
---
This guy is just a primitive schoolyard bully who hides behind a computer.
---
That's why people like me are forced to believe in things like karma.  Someday, he'll attack the wrong person.  Meet someone who is a bigger jerk.  And they'll clean his clock.
---
Much obliged! My GT is Vault Boy53, and I saw yours earlier :3
---
I would say just shoot me a message when you‚Äôre available-
---
I have an instigating hunting rifle, it's awesome.  I can one-shot nearly everything if I'm in a rifle build-out.
---
But lately I've just been using my mutant's Fixer, and running as a commando build.  I also have a furious handmade.
---
The rifleman build did me well from levels 25~60 or so, but now I rarely shift back into it.  Commando FTW.
---
So your the BOS manager who decided we can only put one technical data on the slot. . .
---
*Joke aside* - Cant sat I agree with your wildly ... heretic stance on pre-war skunkworks equipment but I‚Äôm all for you going all in on Faction play.
---
What a good time to take a break and have medical treatment.
---
maybe i will wait straight into wastelander.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying! Lol there‚Äôs 20 seconds after being downed to get revived I believe. I can take out a full team by myself sometimes but it‚Äôs pretty rare. I‚Äôm pretty lucky if I‚Äôm able to pull it off before my teammate bleeds out. Usually takes grenades. That is, if the enemies hadn‚Äôt thirsted the teammate already. 
---
I don‚Äôt see why Bethesda wouldn‚Äôt want to give dead teammates experience as for as long as their team is alive and they stay spectating.
---
i crash consistently, sometimes i can predict it. a terrible pity that it crashes at basically the same places all the time yet nothing has ever been done to fix it.
---
some of them off the top of my head
---
- walking past the script machine at the purveyor 
---
- ‚Äòpress button to start‚Äô after waking up from rest mode
---
- walking from the whitesprings clubhouse to the porches on the houses
---
You so NY lmao
---
Sell them if you can‚Äôt use it.
---
Cranberry Bog is mostly flat and it's also BoS territory. Shouldn't be hard to find a nice spot without any trenches.
---
This is clearly false though. The irony is quite often it is the other way around
---
really? even with all thats happened. the exploits from beta that were reported made the way into launch. the bugs that existed since fallout4. the 2 months they took to fix duping, the 4 weeks they took to fix XP exploit. the blatant disrespect and P2W creep and growing greed of the atom shop. the uncontested hackers in nuclear winter, the constant reemergence of exploits and the constant feet dragging of bethesda, you still put your faith in them?
---
if this guy says another hack is on the way i believe him because i quite frankly don't trust nor have the faith in bethesda. the best thing he ever did was be a cocky asshole, imagine if this hacking issue existed in a closed or more private community?
---
And yet Bethesda's support is still ignoring tickets regarding the stolen gear.
---
Make nice display items
---
I will too lol. I'm pretty OCD about completing my daily and weekly challenges though so I'll probably get anxiety and complete them in the next hour lol.
---
I've never been hacked due to not playing NW often and being a console player. The serious hacks, like the inventory theft one, is PC only. I play maybe an hour or two a week, if lucky. I average three or four crashes a session. I encounter frozen, invulnerable enemies many, many times per session.
---
sorry man..... i get in for a look, but i have my best friend here and i couldn't leave him alone, while i play. i saw you online but i couldn't stay and play.
---
I did. It didn't.
---
This is just my opinion, but I'd shunt some of those Endurance points into Agility and take up a stealth angle, particularly with the one simple addition of Escape Artist (break line-of-sight, crouch, now no one knows where you went).  If you have full Unyielding, you probably don't need the actual Sneak perk, especially if you apply the relevant stealth mods to your armor.  My main used to be purely Bloodied melee, but she started to go in the same direction as my alt, who is stealth pistols with melee as a fallback.  The reason is simple.  If I can sit back and plink everyone with a pistol, I don't need to risk death by getting my hands dirty.  The claws come out for the Scorchbeast Queen, of course, but that's about it.
---
Legacy weapons hit different and dense doesnt seem to help much against them. I can stand under my own orbital strike beacons and take 0 damage but my explosive laser rifle almost insta kills me
---
Keep in mind that in PvP your weapons will be capped at 110 damage per round and your damage resistance will be capped at 300 damage resistance.
---
I haven‚Äôt really explored much of the cranberry bog, I‚Äôll check it out.
---
I‚Äôm a rifle build. My primary weapon is a lever action. For a rifle build it‚Äôs hard to beat. I also use an automatic handmade. While it doesn‚Äôt gain the perks from the rifleman cards and doesn‚Äôt do as much damage per shot, it does put more bullets down range much faster than the lever action and sometimes that‚Äôs what you need. I also keep a fully automatic pistol as a side arm so I don‚Äôt waste my 45‚Äôs and 5.56 on low level goons. I used to keep a shotgun around for this but after all the shotgun nerfs they are effectively useless now.
---
Yep it is why I use a lot of survival utility perks to like serendipity and dogy
---
Would disagree. Found a level 50 instigating and put the 50 cal reciever on it, gave it to a level 60 that had shit legendaries. Now he one shots most of the enemies in the game
---
One thing I did when I wanted a PvP character was to abandon bloodied weapons and unyielding armor and I went with a high health vanguard/sentinel armor set up. 
---
I used all anti-armor weapons. My main go-to was a AA FFR handmade and I had a AAE laser rifle if the handmade wouldn't do the trick. 
---
For perk cards I used serendipity and bloody mess in luck. Some say to use dodgy in agility but I found the AP drain from it was a hindrance more than anything so I guit using it plus I don't think it stacks with sentinel armor effects. 
---
I found having my health at max greatly improved my wins in PvP versus having it reduced for bloodied and unyielding effects.
---
Edited for typos
---
Assume you‚Äôve gone to the armor bench to try and make the outfit? I didn‚Äôt get any notification either, but did that and noticed the new outfit.
---
Unlink then relink if you already had twitch prime before the bundle was released.
---
On ps4  you cant sell  the beanie but the fur coat u could . Edit* I'm talking about the robot vendor*
---
I'm sorry, are you asking a question, or are you spreading FUD?
---
Well assuming you are being completely honest, that's fucked up. I wonder what the difference is. I play on Xbox.. are you on PS or XBox? If you are crashing 3 times every 1-2 hours, that is pretty wild.
---
Look I love the fallout franchise but 76 is technical shit. I love the world, I am okay with mechanics, but technically the game is shit. There is no way we have seen the last PC vulnerability.
---
I know, I know see you all in down vote hell. But one day, even you, might see reality.
---
I've had Mole rats get stuck underground, it's super annoying.
---
I'm on Xbox. I'm good for two crash to launch screens a play session, and a good one or two "server not responding, controls disabled" every week and a half. For all I know I should wipe the game and reinstall to my Xbox, or it's because it's on an external hdd not the internal one. Could be any number of things. I've learned to just live with it, and rarely complain because it does no good. For what it's worth I love the game and want to see it succeed, so I don't complain, because my luck it'll get shut down.
---
dunno what fud means, but i'm expressing my thoughts on the current situation, what probelm do you have with that?
---
Do you have rad and poison resist armor and dense chest piece? I find those help lots. 
---
I run with the monster and all unyielding, but I use sun kissed, healing factor and born survivor to stay at full health.
---
It takes me two hits to kill max level ghouls and mutants until adrenaline kicks in. If I do start to get into trouble during an extended battle (AWOL, the front of Westech), my health starts to go down, and I become Superman. Occasionally I‚Äôll pop a psycho buff; but I don‚Äôt really go through many chems. I keep 10 stimpacks on me, and routinely sell extras.
---
I run pretty much your build, but w four points in perception (lockpick x 3, and rotating green thumb, butchers, pan), charisma, travel agent and hard bargain 3)
---
Going back to Fallout 4 after playing and building in 76 was crazy. You can place walls anywhere (not just a foundation/wall edge), foundations didn't randomly not place because of some random 3 pixel wide rock, don't even get me started on how easy it is to add stairs and new floors.
---
You need to go to the nuke zone in the bog, around every tree is violet. Did you look on the market place, they go for around 200-300 caps now, how much do you need ?
---
Poor santatron lol
---
Do you use anything for defenses?
---
What platform are you on? Sorry if it was mentioned but I didnt see it in the comments
---
The TSE LMG way out performs the TSE Gatling.  With heavy weapons perk and bloodied mess, you'll get 15.90 hits per second for a total damage per second of 1840!  Compared to a Gatling with the same perks of only 471 total damage per second.
---
I've always purchase my .308 ammo at the CAMP vendors for 1 cap each, the same you would typically pay for 5mm ammo.  Use a plinking gun of some sort, such as a Tesla or 10mm sub to take out low level nuisance threats to conserve your .308 for the bigger targets.
---
Aww, I missed the donuts
---
I check every vendor when I'm in game. Only missing 2 pieces. Thanks for the clue about the bog, I'll keep an eye out next time a nuke lands there.
---
That makes total sense, but also my "bad" turret was attacking my walls and the ground so crossfire maybe caused a glitch or the turret just turned bad after being hit lol
---
Yes it is, juicehead himself even replied to me about it in this thread. The dataminers sent the hack and fix to Bethesda a whole week before it was released by erect ban.
---

They supposedly moving towards easy challenges as of 1st Jan 2020, so this could be the start of it ..
---
Punji boards
---
Thing is I never found any mole rats. Only Mole miners, Scorched and Feral Ghouls.
---
I used to do full health back at the beginning and still try from time to time but I find I die at the same rate especially when they get you to the 150 to mark and kill you before serindipty can activate but I also ran marine sentinal assassin powered set . so I'm not sure what the difference that may be
---
I'll have to try that until I get the good turrets at least :) thanks for the quick reply.
---
Some subreddits, this one included, require that you host a photo somewhere like imgur and then link it here.
---
you can trade the beanie on ps4..i bought one for caps
---
Are they worth anything?
---
Playing since Beta. Im ashamed But what you get from doing all daily Challengers??
---
I will sell you a couple for 100 per if you need. Yeah bog for violet, for all other fluxes go to white springs. There is 1 or 2 spots for violet at white springs, but they generally gone, just north of the golf club in the stream and north of white springs behind the houses, bog is still the best location, just head for the biggest trees, you can't miss them, they shine purple.
---
I feel like lag/delay has a lot to do with the outcome as well. I've had players ask how I keep one shotting them but on my end I'm using a full mag to kill them.
---
Use a handmade super flexible and keep in mind your damage is directly affect by your perk load out try tank killer on hard enimeis
---
Kept in mind that you have to stabilise the flux. You need a couple of ingredients for that.
---
Same I'll hear like a crashing sound sometimes then just drop dead from what seems like a 1 shot
---
I desperately want Brotherhood Stuff

No, not every weird thing that happens is the result of someone spoiling your fun.

---
Thanks for the advice. Unfortunately, no. I'm still trying to learn mods for my marine armor, so it's mostly ultra-light and hardened at the moment. I'll look into sun kissed, healing factor and born survivor.
---
Consult the maps [here](https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY) then go launch a nuke on the area with the flora you need. You can gather the materials yourself.

Is there any benefit to going with Mysterious Savior?
---
&gt; He gives fuel to haters of 76 to continue their quest to trash talk this game, in order to try and financially hurt bethesda.
---
lol Or he just exploits one of the numerous vulnerabilities and the haters take it from there.
---
It's amazing how in every single one of your posts, you refuse to put blame squarely where it lands. On Bethesdas shoulders. This is Bethesdas buggy game. This is Bethesdas shitty code. This is Bethesdas lack of security. This is Bethesdas constant stream of problems.
---
You can sit there and claim that people want to hate. Or that hackers will do whatever. But at the end of the day, the only reason there are all these problems, is the root, Bethesda. Haters don't create the bugs we see. Bethesda did. Hackers don't create the security flaws we see, Bethesda did. But you refuse to blame who is responsible here.
---
The game is fun. I enjoyed it. I stopped playing because it's just not a completed game. It's still chock full of bugs. Quests can't be completed. Updates randomly bring old bugs back. Or cause the game to be unplayable. There are numerous security problems. Etc. Etc. Etc.
---
The game is not a AAA release ready game, and it's been out for over a year.
---
I get that you like and want to defend the game. But you are being biased, and you need to be realistic. There are numerous problems with this game, and there is no one to blame but Bethesda. Just learn to accept that.
---
I can give you one. Knightofthecrow is my gt. I am getting on in a few.
---
1. They could bring any item into the game the week before.
---
2. After having access to any item, the game was boring... so they decided to steal from other players.
---
3.They went far out of their way to be as public and exploitative in the most cruel fashion... Because they are on the hate train.
---
Never once did they step back. I'm pretty sure it makes sense buddy.  The hackers say they "reported" the week before, during holiday season...and then used it full force.
---
Make a video, log who you stole from, return the items later.  That's a hostage situation that gets at Beth for coding errors,but no they just stole, teased burnt and hurt.  
---
I feel they are mad at people for enjoying the game.
---
I don't see any reason to put blame on Beth if this is the hackers method, they just want fame, I don't believe anything they say and as far as I am concerned they can get bent.
---
Yeah... the turret becomes an enemy... so your whole camp becomes a target. Just like a supermutant attacking the walls, etc.
---
Wait? You guys are getting paid?
---
Such bullshit. The game has a ton of bugs and problems even a year after release. That's on Bethesda, no one else. Stop fanboying and grow up.
---
Im guessing your a vats user because yes they nerfed all two shot weapons in vats, guns are still strong just cant use em in vats because 99% of the time the other shots do not hit
---
my auto stim does not work at all never procs and food drink and chem weights are not not effected i am wearing 2 pieces of armor for them and the weights don't change
---
Have you tried going elsewhere for a little bit and then go back? I had an issue at Tyler county dirt track where a molerat got stuck and kept jumping between two places. Had to leave it for 5 mins then go back when it had freed itself
---
I've yet to launch my first nuke. It would be simpler to buy the missing ingredient. Much cheaper in material and time.
---
I get them from Breach &amp; Clear pretty frequently, I sell them at 250-300 caps. Sometimes they sit awhile but eventually someone buys.
---
Would say do full health instead so you have more time to heal against something like a strangler
---
Fuck him. I'm enjoying my Christmas and New Year, I'm not going to let some miserable shower of shite spoil my fun. 
---
It isn't dramatic to call him a terrorist. He is deliberately spreading fear into a playerbase for a game that he himself doesn't enjoy. Bethesda fixed the issue in less than a day, and that was during a holiday. I imagine there will already be plans in place for when the team get back in January. 
---
I sincerely hope he doesn't entirely scare players away. Just travel light, hang out with friends, go scorched hunting in lower level areas, tinker with your CAMP. Most of all have fun. Don't let this cunt get the better of you.
---
I havent really dealt with strangler on xbox yet most people with it got pushed out by the beach boys and there sub groups
---
Paying 1c for ammo is a terrible price, also the Gatling can be used on any enemy, big or small. 5mm can be crafted much cheaper than paying 1c per, and when enemies only take a few shots to kill that‚Äôs a max of maybe 5c worth of ammo. The LMG has way better dps, but in ammo efficiency it‚Äôs terrible
---
I'm not applying anything against other players :D I think you might need to reread my original post since you totally missed the point of it.
---
What I think is gaining levels, always looking for better gear and having fun overcoming challenges the game throws your way is a huge part of why people play it. If you don't like this part of the game and prefer just explore the world, doing quests and playing all casual, you won't even notice the balancing changes I propose, because you won't reach the point where mobs become very strong anytime soon.
---
What I suggested will become BARELY noticeable if you'll level up past 150-200 which is the point where you will already know many (if not most) of the game mechanics and how to play the game more efficiently. Believe me, I played with lots of builds throughout my 1200 hours of gameplay and I know that even doubling mobs health and damage won't make the game much harder for the guy that pushed that far. Since levelling at higher levels take a while, you won't notice that difficulty of the fights will get drastically harder within a short period of time. But also you will get more xp and more loot along the way.
---
If you are already a high level (above 400-600) and oneshot everything, then you WILL notice that mobs became tougher and maybe you won't even oneshot them. Maybe you'll even need to shoot twice to kill'em now :D But here's the catch - you will get even more rewards because you worked hard to reach that level and there must be something to incentivize people to push their levels even further. So here it is. More levels = more xp rewards and more loot. This is what I suggest.
---
Now tell me where exactly is this screwing with people.
---
Yea, I forgot that legacy weapons effects are from before the patch where they fixed explosive weapons. So their 2nd bullets deal same as first bullet and their explosives are much more powerful, but they damage you a lot more too
---
Alright, let me login ..
---
As a 76 hater myself, I just wish they would turn the game over to modders and give us real private servers. They can't do the job themselves. Oh well, other games get released every week I guess, just sad when a franchise you love let's you down like that. It's the same for all haters, trust me. Deep down, we just care more than the very company that's taking your money.
---
I haven't seen any official posts about that sort of rebalancing but it sounds interesting! Looking forward to see something like that with wastelanders release.
---
It will be Tinker
---
Some times you just gotta teach the young'uns a lesson
---
Yes, the purveyor and top of the world train station and walking in or out of the Whitespring clubhouse cell are pretty bad. Specially when other players are around. And even more so if close enough to interact with them.
---
Yeah? Well I didn't play for close to a year and came back to find they'd deleted both of my characters.
---
Soooo.... I guess they'll just purge characters after X amount of time.
---
Betheseda how is the person in those youtube videos not banned? His IGN is clearly visible in his other videos, which involving scamming a young child and making him cry for over 20 minutes.
---
Good luck with the broken game
---
It happened at several workshops too where I hadn‚Äôt built any walls at all. Same visual glitch tho, striped walls of different colors coming from my peripheral vision and converging towards the the center, but it obscures everything! I can‚Äôt play when it happens but so far it‚Äôs been a rare glitch. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a way to verify game files or is this an issue with the Xbox?
---
Ya it is. They should be worth double. So 40 xp. Then on double xp weekends 80 each, even then  that's stretching it.
---
Thanks so much dude! You're awesome!
---
Nothing special for completing them all. Just the Atoms for each one or the NW rewards.
---
Per shot? What effects do you have on it?
---
Xbox
---
It sounds like some key aspects are still viable, but the hack maker needs to update a few things to enable it
---
Should have got it a year ago. You would have understood.
---
That‚Äôs incorrect.
---
I'm working on alt characters.  Extra storage space and you can script more per day.  Once I have my builds set on the different characters I can change my playstyle when ever I want without re-allocating dozens of points.
---
No problem, I haven‚Äôt used missile turrets or any good ones but machine gun turrets take up a ton of budget an just get destroyed in a couple shots.
---
I'm telling u with 100 percent certainty I specifically checked this last night the beanie wouldn't show up in the trade menu with the vendor. But the fur coat did. That's why I'msaying this. This is my experience. Are u on ps4?
---
Good point very buggy at the start
---
Features if you don't mind
---
U will people are using strangler with jetpack to counter Teslas
---
I‚Äôm not but I‚Äôm in a group with people on PS4 and one dude got the rewards and gave beanies to everyone in the group. So it‚Äôs def tradeable on PS4. 100%.
---
Unfortunately you chose a sour time in the game to join up on PC, there are some hackers out there who can essentially steal your entire inventory should the feel like it. Keep a lot of valuables in your stash box maybe until you see the fix for it come up. No one can really say for sure if a lot of the bug fixes will ever come, they seem to be moving at a snail's pace with them. I feel like everyone is waiting in anticipation for the wastelanders update to drop before they fully develop an opinion. The only bugs they seem to update are the game breaking ones. Duping probably still exists in some small circles rather than on a massive scale thanks to that, and hopefully the inventory theft will get fixed up as well. Not to mention shoddy server connectivity and crashes but I've always been fine with playing through those if it means playing fallout with friends!
---
You really are a garbage human.
---
I'm talking selling to the vendor. I read someone say they got 30 caps selling to the vendor for the beanie but I wasnt able to sell one. The fir coat was worth 18 caps tho
---
Let me know if there is.  You'd be surprised which items are valuable/rare, especially in the trading scene.  The purveyor gave me a pipe pistol the other night and someone offered me 18,000 caps for it.
---
Wastelanders is coming out in the new year and it's supposedly had a lot of development put into it. With that release is to be a large game update that is to address most of the ongoing bugs in the game. 
---
The PC version has been going through a bout of issues as of late which you can find more "information" on that simply by browsing this forum but I wont dive too deep into that. I'll let you make your own decision and mind up on that on your own accord. 
---
Yes this game has a future regardless of what some will say. Yes there is hate here for the game but if you browse a lot of other popular games subreddit's you'll also find hate there as well. 
---
Wherever there is praise for something you'll find hate for it as well. It's the ying and yang of life so to speak. 
---
I and many others enjoy the game and look forward to its future. I'd say the supporters outnumber those that do not and you'll see some of those that do not support chime in to my comment I'm sure.
---
I was mentioned in the [GameZone interview](https://www.gamezone.com/originals/interview-fallout76-e32019/) after E3:
---
&gt; **This is obviously a lot of content but the question always is ‚ÄòWhat happens next?‚Äô**
---
&gt;
---
&gt; **Gardiner:** ...we‚Äôre going to take a hard look at our character progression so high-level players will have something to entice them to keep moving forward. We‚Äôre calling it the legendary character system, we‚Äôre looking at a wholelistic balance pass across the whole game for Wastelanders so that high-level players and low-level players can still participate in events and other things together so new players don‚Äôt feel so overwhelmed when they come out of the vault by level 300s. We‚Äôve got a lot on our plate!
---
And at [QuakeCon](https://youtu.be/1jR52HB-9NY?t=2426):
---
&gt; ...you know also for wastelanders, we have two more big ambitious goals that will land at or around the launch of wastelanders, one is we're calling it internally - it's a sort of a pointy hat word - renormalization, where we're basically looking at the balance as a whole, and trying to make sure that any new players coming in don't see a big wave of level 300 players, and feel like they can't have fun and compete in the game.
---
&gt; So, we're gonna look at making that a little more - look, it's called normalize, where you take the highs and the lows, and you sort of bring them together a little bit. Obviously, strong characters will still be strong, and weak characters will still have things they struggle with, but we're gonna try to bring that in a little. Especially for events and things, so players can engage and come together and help each other and support, which this community loves to do.
---
What the changes are going to be, that is anyone's guess.
---
Setting up your water collectors in your camp next to a water source and having a good 5-10 purifiers although taking a lot of space will be a good way of making caps ! I advise :)
---
Pretty much
---
Sell things through an online market.
---
If you are at a point where you can launch your own nuke, and you already have a supply of HRF, GM, and HM...
---
\- goto to the silo near toxic valley.
---
Make ground zero the more or less the center of the valley, or perhaps a bit NW to include Wavy Willards.   
---
You‚Äôll walk out with at least 200 violet flux.  
---
If no camp around, you‚Äôll need to Fast travel to you preferred chem bench location.
---
Bonus: different kinds of critters there.  I had everythingfrom mirelucks to assaultrons when I did it.
---
Otherwise, yea, the bog is the place for violet.  Closest chem station to stabilize is upstairs in the high school, but you‚Äôll likely have to fight your way to it.
---
Great idea, but I think they should wait till they can make everything a separate stash including the display cases and fridge
---
OHHHHHH my bad I totally misread you. I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt try to sell them to the vendor bots! I‚Äôll check tonight. I‚Äôm sorry internet friend.
---
Don't worry the fanboys are traumatized of all the negativities. So every post that feels negative all claws out.
---
Sorry I'm talking the robot vendor. I wasnt able to sell one to them but fur I was able to
---
That inventory hack was fixed
---
No problem I was clear either 8) ya let me know if u could sell or not. The beanie specifically
---
Thought they brought the whole game off line for maintenance either way it's been around 2 hours every time didn't know there were any scheduled
---
I‚Äôm being serious I wish him luck because just the other week I gave up so i hope others can have fun where I could not
---
Oh thank goodness I felt so bad for PC people. I'd quite forever if I had my shit stolen like that. Too many hours spent farming and trading.
---
Oooh sweeet that would be awesome! I‚Äôd happily trade you for it I‚Äôve got a few plans from the event or oddball legendaries. Low on caps tho due to my wrapping paper addiction. I‚Äôll be on in about 20 minutes
---
Fireproof perk helps a lot.
---
If you have a lot of rubber, plastic and glass for marine helmets or a lot of water purifiers for purified water, you can sell them with level 1 characters equipped with full unyielding gear. Full unyielding on a level 1 character plus a level in charisma should get you to the selling hard limit.
---
Sell, move unyielding armour and caps to main character, delete level 1 character, create new one and repeat. Each new character can sell another 1400 caps and get another 150 scrip (mmurg will only sell level 1 weapons/armour though, good way to get level 1 unyielding armour). Technically you can do this until you run out of things to sell.
---
I used this to buy hundreds upon hundreds of large gift wrapping while I had every workshop claimed and generating gifts too. I got caps from the gifts which I sunk back into gift wrapping.
---
Agreed, I just have all these ideas of when I‚Äôm building and want them to be heard to see what other‚Äôs think. No on will know unless I share it.
---
This game has a future and hopefully wastelanders will bring people back when it does come out and if your worried about bugs to me it seems like most are only on PC, most of the bugs I hear YouTubers talk about never happen on PS4, but I could just be lucky, but you definitely should make your own opinion
---
And we love it ! Bethesda, if you are reading this, please keep it that way !
---
It was fixed before Christmas I believe, but I highly doubt the hackers will stay down forever, I don't even think a anti cheat can do it unfortunately
---
I‚Äôd like that, along with maybe one that was still doable but more of a challenge that was worth more Atoms. Like, for 30-40 Atoms, kill 5 Scorchbeasts or 1 Legendary Scorchbeasts. 
---
Maybe about 50 Atoms from ‚Äòeasy‚Äô challenges and an extra 30-40 from ‚Äòhard‚Äô challenges.
---
Id use executioner, exploding bullets can mak enemy's investigate but not the spot you shoot from they check the spot the bullets exploded, so if used correctly you can pull nearby enemy's out of cover
---
That‚Äôs what it seems like to me.
---
Makes sense. Agreed.
---
The purpose is that the plasma hits significantly different that the laser. I had the laser and not the plasma so I was trying to get more info. I just got the plasma which kills me in a split second if I hit anything close while the Gatling laser takes 4 times as long to kill myself at the same distance. So they are different, was looking for useful input.
---
Yes, it stays burrowed underground until you approach. It‚Äôs near where the picnic blanket and corpses are. If it‚Äôs not there, someone already killed it and it hasn‚Äôt refreshed yet. You can server hop to try to get it again, but it‚Äôs there.
---
Everything is not fixed. Bethesda doesnt know how. I'm not bashing them, it's the truth. Theyve never made an online game before, they dont know what they're doing.
---
Thanks for clarification!
---
Not really, it still feels pretty shallow. Sure it can be fun with others, but if that's a requirement for any game to be fun then it's shit imho. I like building camps and did enjoy exploring the map but I'm pretty much done with that now. If Wastelanders is no good, then that's the final nail in the "uninstall" coffin for me.
---
Ah, yes, the ‚ÄòSleep in a bed for 50 Atoms‚Äô. That was a nice surprise.
---
Or the 3 star legendary that flies off a minute after surface to air ends
---
I miss the explosive Thompson - was my goto.
---
The M1 Garand and carbine were fun, but then again, that might be more because I‚Äôve fired those IRL Rather than used them extensively in game.
---
I like to dilute chems and sell them, or go thru wes tek and collect assault rifles and sell them. For trading I just sell 556 ammo pretty consistently
---
Players would be much less fearful if Bethesda would come out with a simple statement saying yes this is a problem and could be one in the future.  If you feel as if your character was hacked we will roll it back no problems.  People get fearful if they have spent hundreds of in game hours to build up a character and camp and find good weapons to have all of that erased with no plan for recovery.
---
And probably fix the fucking engine. The fact that Bethesda was warned a year prior about using an outdated singleplayer engine that was modded for YEARS will be a bad idea, and all they did is ignore those warnings.
---
Yes there was that one and the ‚Äúwalk 10 meters in any direction‚Äù for 69 atoms. That one was nice.
---
One foundation, 3 full walls, 2 half walls one of those with windows so you can grab through. Roof, 4 turrets on each corner divided by a concrete barrier to keep those idiots from shooting themselves up all the time.
---
Have you started the quest at Abbies bunker? What did you do last?
---
Thanks everyone for the responses. I did end up trading and got a ve Gatling plasma to compliment my ve Gatling laser. The laser is much weaker I would say about 1/3 the dps and you down yourself significantly slower while shooting close. Laser takes 15 shots to the floor with fireproof 3 to kill self. The plasma kills self in 4 shots to the floor. But it‚Äôs a monster for dps against mobs. You can however shoot mobs that are close and stay up with full health with either one as long as the enemy is alive. Once it‚Äôs dead, you have a split second to stop shooting with the plasma and plenty of time with the laser. Both are excellent. I will use the plasma on large groups or powerful enemies and the laser on smaller mobs. Thank you everyone
---
Of that actually makes sense I may have to dawn my sentinal assassin armor
---
Have you completed the quest Rose gave you over the radio? After that you should be able to go up to the top floor to talk to Ross to continue.
---
Are you on xbox or Pc?
---
I've done bunker buster
---
Multi-million dollar dev team vs. one sweaty script boi
---
Bethesda is losing by choice.
---
Best way is to buy a bunch of serums from people who sell them in bulk for around 100 caps each. These can then be sold to vendors for between 250 and 500 caps depending on your charisma, and whether or not you have hard bargain
---
It‚Äôs sad really. I want this game to live. Has it been perfect every step of the way? No. Has Bethesda messed up constantly with the handling with this game? Yes! However, I still grew up with the company and fallout. I want this game to win I want it to turn around. I feel true fans will set standards for Bethesda and demand they meet them. Like seriously how long can the pc version survive like this? When everyday you play you‚Äôre risking the loss of all your hard work, at any moment all your grinding can be for not. Not knowing if things are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or not should be some of the most basic of basic things to ask a company to communicate to you. This shouldn‚Äôt be something players are leaving to chance. The reason there‚Äôs so much fear is because there‚Äôs very little clarity coming from Bethesda.
---
So fun ha ha
---
Okay, I think I see it. It must be the Blackwater mine mission.
---
you support hackers and cheaters out if spite? weak
---
Ya, I'm going to agree with you on this.
---
If you're on xbox could you see if you can build a billboard at my camp? If you can I'll pay you caps. Some atomic items can be placed but I don't know which ones. I have the greenhouse because someone built it for me. If it does place will you take 300 caps?
---
"It‚Äôs like if someone went and murdered 532 people just to ‚Äúprove he could get away with it‚Äù 
---
No, no it isn't. It's nothing like mass murder by an individual on an unprecedented scale, gets some perspective dude.
---
Yes, that is a better way to say it because I do love Bethesda, weird features and all.
---
Providing advice about something you don't actually KNOW about... RIP lol
---
Here is a good link that walks you through things:
---
https://ca.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/The_Missing_Link
---
There are quite a few quests related to Rose
---
Well that friggin sucks
---
So I gifted a beanie to a friend, and he jumped on NW and his XP is now going towards the outfit. It slipped the rest of the challenges. They show as  greyed out for him.
---
So...if you want to grind for the previous rewards don't pick up a beanie.
---
In my opinion, it would be a useful addition if the combat rifle had an option for a .308 semi-auto receiver, like in Fallout 4. Maybe with a damage multiplier of 1.5 relative to the standard .45 receiver (the hardened .45 is 1.25x damage), or even 1.6 with the fire rate lowered from 33 to 30. That seems reasonably balanced, although the Fixer could become quite powerful then.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people hate this guy. At this point he‚Äôs clearly doing us and Bethesda a service to show how shitty the backend of this game is in order to force Bethesda to fix it once and for all. 
---
I want this guy to deal so much damage that either Bethesda will improve it like a triple A game should be or will loose the entire player base, because the way things are now are simply embarrassing, and Bethesda can‚Äôt keep lying to us with a simple ‚Äúwe fixed it‚Äù, because they clearly didn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt, and these hackers are just showing the true face of how bad this game is.
---
calling people fanboys because they don‚Äôt like hackers and cheats? get a grip.
---
Try to jump servers. Sometimes energies get stuck underground and you can‚Äôt kill or see them.
---
No, because I honestly enjoy running into random people and/or hanging out with friends. These hackers are scumbags who need to face justice. Be it in court, or vigilante imo.
---
Oh my goodness that‚Äôs good info. You should post that as it‚Äôs own post! That‚Äôs info the community needs.
---
I‚Äôm going to hold onto them for at least a few months for sure
---
This is exactly what everyone said last time........before over 500+ people had their shit stolen..... Come on man!!
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I cannot remember the last time I disconnected or blue screened, it would have been maybe 1 or 2 months ago and I play maybe every other day for a couple of hours.
---
Pick up everything including junk and sell it. Whitespring is good too because ghouls drop chems u can sell and its close to a vendor
---
Thank you
---
They used to be legendaries and the game still treats them like they are.  Sell em to a vendor.
---
The Fixer is my favorite weapon by far already. If it was more powerful it would be way too OP. (But I‚Äôm ok with that lol)
---
Agreed. The hunting rifle does marginally more damage per shot than a similarly kitted out lever action rifle but has 60% of the firing rate and is heavier as well. They should increase the damage of all .50 receivers by another 10-20% at least to make up for the much slower firing rate.
---
well you see a lot of people praising hackers and cheats and saying its all Bethesda‚Äôs fault. why can‚Äôt people just be objective both ways? I fucking despise hackers and cheaters, AND I think Bethesda could up their security game. 
---
but out of the two, the hackers are truly the villains. even if you are upset about something Bethesda has done, supporting hackers and praising them for hurting BGS is a shit position to take, and it will always get my downvote
---
And you can also get those items ingame, VERY easily. In fact, a few people I know actually have a small stock of repair kits NOT from the store, but never really bother using them because we're all conscious about making sure we keep our stuff from breaking. P2W accusations over repair kits? come on bro...
---
Yeah, they fixed that back at the beginning of November
---
Yeah me to they like that crazy uncle that keeps doing stupid shit and everyone complains about it but your like nah he man that's pretty cool lol
---
go watch vonwiclehoffer  's   other youtube videos. scamming and mocking a young children crying and scamming others.
---
This subs victim mentality is mental. Say that the media overreacts about issues in the game, that people should be more positive, whilst simultaneously calling this guy a terrorist and personally insulting him over a game. Hahahahahahahaha
---
I like how we get downvoted for simple statements of fact. You don't have to spend money to acquire atoms.
---
The damage resistance part is false.
---
Stuff like that... Not just that.
---
I tried shooting them but they are immortal over there. It's the edge of the game so your bullets won't reach.
---
They are going for about $10 on eBay.
---
I think its fun, tbh. Im sorry you couldnt enjoy it :(
---
What do you mean side by side? Like ‚ñ°‚ñ° or ‚ñ°‚ñ†‚ñ°( the black square is a wall)
---
Had the same cave around the first month of launch, a lot of good aluminum (i think it was) nodes there. Sadly it got removed twice and i had to rebuild it every time since the game wouldnt let me place it (it was before you had the choice to move to another world if your space was occupied), i got so annoyed that i just plopped down a simple house in a field with barely anything build, because i didnt want to build it a fourth time.... the time i log in my house AGAIN got removed because someone was occupied a completely random spot on the map where my house was... i again couldnt place it down, this is when i noticed the placement was fucked (they also seemed to have fixed that later but i stopped playing before that)... i got so annoyed i just stopped playing. 
---
It was just too much with all the annoying time wasters that they didnt fix. I tried to play again about 2 months ago because i thought at this point it should be atleast decently playable... still so many time wasters in the game, that are either bugs or seemingly intended that i just didnt enjoy my time and moved on.
---
I can only recommend just finding another game thats less bothersome than 76, these constant hits in your face just dont make it fun to play :/
---
December 31st
---
All the other Mounted head plans show in the notes tab as (known): but mega sloth Isn‚Äôt in the list.   I did notice there are three non-selectable items In the Pip-boy list named ‚Äú(0)‚Äú
---
After getting over the annoyance and started playing again...Eventually made it back to my camp.  
---
Opened a bunch more presents.  RNG was nice to me - got mothman, the frog, the gorilla...and even though I Still don‚Äôt See the plan in the pip boy, you are correct - the mega sloth was in the build menu.
---
Without the wall in between them
---
Has the hacker ever shown that he warned BE in advance before releasing the exploit?
---
I think holiday events are cool but i wish they would last longer. I always visit family during the holidays so i never get to participate. I only got to play one day.

You wish for the impossible, and I look forward to randos betraying your faith and ruining your day. This story has played out to many times before in every game since the dawn of public multiplayer.
---
You want justice? You first have to acknowledge the real crime here and go after the cause the true disease not the symptom that highlights the flaws and vulnerabilities well after you were warned and had more than ample time to fix them.
---
GT Astrosguy. I‚Äôm always lookin‚Äô for fun people to walk around the Wasteland with. I never have much of a plan when I log on. Kill stuff, loot stuff, sell stuff. Ya know.
---
The change I suggested is only for the semi-auto (rifleman) mode, a powerful automatic .45 receiver would still have the better DPS, and .45 is also cheaper to craft. In fact, a regular .308 combat rifle could even be buffed a bit more than the above numbers, if we compare it to the hardened 5.56 handmade that has a fire rate of 40.
---
The dude who stole the items was on this forum and would regularly post before he was banned recently. Here is his explanation for scamming people even before he was able to use the hack to steal items.                                                                                                                                                 "I'm \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ this is what I do. I don't do it for the items I do it  for  the fun of it, I've collected every outfit, I'm loaded with  legacies,  dev room stuff, ideal weapons and armor sets (there's nothing  that i  legitimately need and almost nothing that don't already have).  The kid I  mentioned above was done the other night, he was number 257  of the  people I've done that to (I keep a list). If you have any  doubt's or  concerns about the legitimacy of my claims feel free to look  me up on M  76 or other trade sub reddits. So long as you are mindful  and not a  pushover when it comes to trading there's nothing i can do to  effect  you. If you have any questions about who else i've done this  to, other  experiences, or feel like stopping by ingame feel free to  (PC). "
---
I feel bad for you don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll get another soon. üëç
---
Just place a wall like you normally would then change it to doorway
---
I guess it depends on how rare they become. If it becomes almost impossible to find again,  I'll probably go for more like 5k. I've got several that I'm saving for a rainy day.
---
I see. I like your suggestion. The game could use a lot of balancing ideas like yours.
---
As i understand it, scorched pets eventually become untamed.  Can someone confirm..
---
I wouldnt believe anything without video proof, but honestly, its less than surprising that Bethesda says something is fixed when it isnt... they said now on basically every possible occasion that something was fixed and then the good people of reddit that round up all the bugs found out the truth...
---
Bethesda lies to save face, the hackers dont have anything to win here, atleast nothing real, but they show us how fucking ridiculous Bethesda is and how they lie through their teeth over and over and over again.
---
For now i recommend just wait and see, but like i said, my days of being surprised by Bethesda saying something is fixed when it isnt are over.
---
Thats actually what i was trying to do.  Was inside whitesprings in the room with all the workbenches.  Opened the gift, learned the plan, hit the button to  tab over to apparel so I could put on PA in case it was nuked when I spawned back in , and boom, crash.
---
Go to the new Grafton Pawnshop and start the mini quest to get your unique 6 digit code to open that door.
---
I was thinking the same thing like a day ago. I saw a silver Mathmos Rocket lava lamp that had Cyan "lava" in it. It gave me some major Fallout vibes. lol
---
Same! My team was always focused of killing and leveling up and nothing else. Let me know when you'll be on I'd like to have someone to play with!
---
I‚Äôll call someone a fanboy all day when they sit blindly while their fellow players are getting ripped off!! You get a grip on reality dude! Screw these hackers that much goes without saying. But Jesus you can‚Äôt tell me a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry‚Äù post from Bethesda wouldn‚Äôt add some much needed clarity to all of this.
---
Big bend tunnel and glassed cavern
---
lol so bitter
---
It‚Äôs currently OP because there‚Äôs wedding rings that have sentinel and AP refresh lmao
---
I assume youve already tuned into Rose?  And done her annoying quests?
---
A good scopes lever action is my best go to for rifle, would highly recommend
---
I literally just got it and when it got to my camp it was scorched and that was maybe 2 hours before maint shut down
---
&gt;He wants you to be afraid,
---
Every thought about that he has nothing to gain but everything to lose from publishing these hacks, like you yourself even said, so his goal must be something different than fame or fear, i personally think its to show how incompetent Bethesda is and he is doing a great job at that.
---
Also dont you remember the ban wave that caught many of the people invested in giving Bethesda a shitload of information about still operable exploits and bugs? They confirmed they worked and gave a full report of how they worked so Bethesda can fix them and what did they get? They go banned and the exploits stayed live... its obvious that this doesnt work as an honest avenue to better the game...
---
Bethesda AGAIN said they fixed something, which they didnt actually fix... how often have we heard from them that they removed this or that or patched this or that just to see even directly on patch day, that nothing had changed or they even made it worse...
---
I applaud that guy for showing how shitty they are.
---
I still would like to see him do it without harming any players in his endevours but protests only work if you inconvenience the average person and thats why this works.
---
Ok I‚Äôll add ya when I get on later. I have a lot of NW rewards to give away. Errbody wants a beanie haha
---
It's the conceit that the game is not challenging and is too easy.  I understand that for many it is.  Yet for others, it is not and they struggle despite being high level.  I'm not complaining for my own part, I get where you are coming from.  I just also understand that applying my own paradigm about what I find challenging or easy, is selfish and discounts what others' experiences might be.  So the proposal itself is fine, but the idea behind it, that the game needs 'fixing' in regards to difficulty, is a conceit I cannot get behind.
---
I've done at least 1. Guess I still have more to do. Those damn miners are killing me so quickly. Now I'm remembering why I haven't finished this quest line yet.
---
See people agree with me
---
I definitely appreciate the offer!
---
Gods of RNG must have known my frustration level - last night they granted me the Mothman, the Frog, the gorilla...and a mega sloth. :)
---
And you fell for it.
---
Will they feed into Mumble's machines?
---
I don't have vending machines anymore I'd just give them away or chuck them if they aren't worth anything to any one.
---
Thx for answering
---
How do you get a beanie?
---
thx
---
Unfortunately, no.
---
Keep reporting them to consumer rights groups in Canada we have a government department, I got my FULL REFUND of the game 2 weeks after I bought it, it's called implied warranties.
---
then your info was meaningless - since I was telling a NEW PLAYER how pacifist worked NOW and you went into a rant about how something bad happened before it was patched...... wow this is just even sadder I'd have stopped a few comments ago
---
if ANYONE is crafting these in ps4... HMU!
---
I would like to see legendary throwing weapons. Meat cleavers, knives, grenades, etc that have different perks or even just ability to regenerate more of them every 10 seconds. Like a limir of 3 or something.  Most are not used because you lose when you use
---
*Noice...*
---
You are way more disciplined than I am at building. I'm more chaotic... here's my build in that cave [('the NUMBERS MASON! What do they MEEEAAANNN???')](https://vimeo.com/381910184)
---
We all know that most of the players of the majority of games that arent Fortnite or PUBG are adults and not kids. 
---
Also if his goal was to fuck up players, he wouldnt inform Bethesda beforehand and give them the information and time to fix/patch it and then only broadcast it to show their incompetence.
---
But whatever floats your boat.
---
It‚Äôs one of the Nuclear Winter rewards. It takes a LOT of XP. But this time they are droppable unlike all the other NW challenge rewards. So I made 200 beanies and 200 Fur lined coats last night and gave away about 110 of them.
---
Noted, and definitely appreciate the generosity.  I‚Äôll get a friend request to you when I login again.
---
Are you looking for anything in particular?
---
Making a video reel isnt something you do in 5min. Most likely he wants to top what his previous video showed so more people being robbed, which takes time.
---
Just wait and see, either he tells the truth or not, but at this point its just guesswork at best.
---
Storage for each item type would be great along with a way to sell them as well. Especially food, something that prolongs their shelf life and lets people buy it from you. Definetly opens up new avenues of gameplay!
---
That‚Äôs good :) usually to me 2/3 times :( reall bad, I don‚Äôt understand why, my PS4 is connected with Ethernet, I tried to delete lot of people from friend list , etc ,
---
Oh wow! How much do they cost?
---
Zero!
---
Let‚Äôs all hold a moment of silence in memory of Mr Sloth :(
---
True but at least he would lose a large amount of the items he has stolen as well. Two of his main account IGN are visible in those videos.
---
that happens a lot to me, actually once it let 3 spawn that way, and for melee they will always get themselves in a position to be whackable
---
Looks pretty good to me. You using any mutations? If so, mightvwant to consider class freak as a lot of them reduce strength pretty significantly. 
---
Edit to above: mightvwant to drop better critically for class freak if using mutations. With unyielding, bloodied, your sneak attacks will one shot a ton of enemies and better critical might be overkill. Maybe equip for SBQ fight. 
---
Also, just a personal preference, not necessary, but I really like using party boy/girl on melee builds. With the ability to craft alcohols, its can get really powerful. Whiskey is +6 STR, Vodka +3 STR and +75HP. 
---
If it were me, I'd drop 3 in PER and add it to CHR for partyboy/girl. Like I said though, it's all personal preference.
---
Calm down bethesda shill, you are getting your juices flowing everywhere lol
---
I really like this, and I honestly liked the textured rocks in the walls.  You were building in a cave after all.  One of the other really great building games is Conan exiles and I absolutely love doing builds that meld into the terrain instead of just making giant square boxes in a field.  This is great stuff and you have some real creativity here.
---
It's been changed to an encripted so it can't be a pet anymore like the deathclaw and hermit crab either
---
Those poor vault dwellers all alone in that train car sucks,badass cave idea though
---
"He could easily send a detailed report of what the problem is and how to fix it" modders already tried that and bethesda banned them and all of their accounts so no that wouldn't work for obvious reasons
---
Wait a few months and sell them for what they were before.
---
Maybe have those nuka cola mixers from the nuka world dlc
---
pc? i really need to make more friends, being a recluse kinda sucks and you cant xfer items safely
---
Cheers.
---
There's a lot of things going unused in the files
---
why does chad‚Äôs house say fuck chad in the front in giant lettering?
---
I probably should, thanks.
---
The game made a reference to the chinese stealth suit so it would be a nice adition, not as a atomic shop skin or overclothing but a fully functional stealth suit like in fallout 3 and 4
---
Someone know how to do the glitch?
---

---
What to you mean? As of when? This was only 2 days ago
---
Shooting a radroach with my TSE handmade is overkill too, but I'll still do it. Lol. Nah, jokes aside, you're right, it is a bit unnecessary. It just prevents any damage that you have to repair.
---
LegacyKillerHD is the Youtube equivalent of an ambulance chaser. Literally all his videos are ‚ÄúPlayers are enraged!‚Äù Or ‚Äúthe huge controversy!‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not fully informed about this new Fallout situation, so I‚Äôm not going to outright say he‚Äôs right or wrong, but just know that this dude is always going to try and fan the flames for views.
---
I fucking hate that you exist automod
---
They recently did it from what a few friends of mine said because they had them as well and no longer can do it
---
I don't know when though
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Morgantown Airport. Just hate that place...
---
Edit 2: totally missed this on my first look....you're going to want serendipity. I've found it to be absolutely essential for bloodied melee. Though you use sneak, you'll still occasionally get caught in mobs and/or enemies shooting in your general direction during caution. You'll die pretty frequently without it imo.
---
Sorry, xbox here. Yeah transfering is really risky without the 1st subscription. Always had to wait till a friend could get on, but love the ability to transfer on my private server. Probably my favorite thing about the 1st subscription. Too bad my friends dont like adventure mode could have saved some money. Lol
---
wow 82gb, comcast used to have a 100gb softcap, thank god im on a buisness line, actual unlimited is priceless
---
I‚Äôm running a bar on PS4 and I‚Äôm torn about this. On one side I can keep selling while farming but the lack of human contact would be disappointing. Been able to meet and talk to a lot of cool people.
---
If your still on I‚Äôm so on to hide in some bushes
---
Gt: Tommyc33
---
you're totally right...that's a great fit for this build
---
AVR medical (which I had the best luck finding presents)
---
Summerville Dam
---
Overlook Cabin 
---
Riverside manor
---
Bolton Green
---
I guess most places I hunted scorched for presents.  
---
 The only place I visited regularly before and after the event is the national radio research center.  It‚Äôs near my camp and easy to pickup crafting materials.
---
It's 7000 XP, but you have to unlock the previous rewards first. You can't earn them at the same time like you could for the Halloween event.
---
I have a junkies ss meathook. +1 something. Ill have to look
---
It‚Äôs worth more than 100k
---
If this was true the fo 1st items would be available to everyone not just fo 1st members.
---
Trade glitch caused by trade being disabled by local events.
---
Stopping trade from ever being disabled in the first place should fix.
---
How can it be a discount if nobody but 1st can even buy it?
---
I idea of running a bar is cool. It‚Äôd be cooler if you could get a robot bar tender like in the train stations
---
You can trade immediately after both of you leave the event area..
---
thanks! Those are great ideas. Here's another good question: melee or unarmed? I suppose the build could proibably suit both of them
---
Thx!  He has been grinding the challenges so he will have the previous ones. The information is helpful. Thx for sharing!
---
If I'm sneaking I'll use an instigating explosive lever action that will one shot most things cause of x3.50 sneak attack dmg, if I'm not sneaking I use a tse handmade which takes things down in a few shots and holds 30 bullets
---
Oh I‚Äôd have to fight you over a robot bartender haha.  Most of the appeal of my bar is the Roleplaying.  I really don‚Äôt want to eliminate the human element.  Getting people to roleplay who don‚Äôt usually Roleplay is the best, and I‚Äôd hate to lose that.
---
You raise a good point and it would make sense IF op had said something that implied praise to the hacker.
---
Which he didn't.
---
well. not to flipflop on you too much, I actually run 3 ironclad,3fireproof and 1 radicool fora total of 7 endurance. it still helps you sprint longer and remain a little less squishy.  the fireproof works against alot of what will kill you. you feel basically invincible vs random vehicles that blow up, missiles, grenades, anglers etc.
---
I have 2 points in dead man sprinting(agi), 20% faster sprint feels Really good. and 1 point marathoner(agi), the 1 point marathoner is huge value I always run it as well as the 1 point adrenaline I see you have. 
---
 I mean at this point we are sorta nitpicking because an xtra 5% dmg from bloodymess is normally superfluous, you could just run any quality of life perk with left over stats. I also noticed you dont run traveling pharmacy. Traveling P and thru-hiker are staples on all 5 of my chars.
---
Incisor is your main dmg boost from strength. here is my strength tree:
---
3 tpharmacy
---
3 barbarian
---
1 iron fist
---
3 blocker
---
3 incisor
---
2 martial artist. 
---
I dont really miss the dmg boost from other iron fists etc, and since I only carry 2 powerfists on me I dont really need the third martial artists, 10% attack speed loss is really only felt vs queen since 1shotting anyways
---
What we don't know yet is if they will be removed from the CAMP altogether or not, since the usual scrap collecting version was Atom Shop only or if they will just walk around and collect nothing but "holiday" scrap
---
Good to see a pc player that wasnt set sideways with the pc based hacks.  I love gifting random stuff to noobs. I have yoo much of everything aside from god roll weapons and armor so i give pretty feeely of my ammo chems meds. A use a very limited batch of weapons so i always have excess ammo i wont use. And i make about 50+ stimpacks everytime we have craft healing items as a daily.... with healing factor those get dusty and weigh a lot.
---
Cheers to building a community one tiny act of kindness at a time
---
I mean, anyone who hadn't gotten the small backpack would likely still want to do a run on Morgantown airport (but the trainyard always has better legendary count)
---
Yeah, plus the perk packs, you could likely get them all sooner
---
I would remove Barbarian, blocker, all perception...sneak...all unnecessary for sneak melee. Barbarian and blocker arent saving you when you break stealth infront of the queen. 
---
Rather more dmg and endurance perks
---
Do you even read what you type? Of course I‚Äôd trust a guy who found a way past security and is willing to detail exactly how it happened without causing harm. Anyone dumb enough to refuse that will get robbed.
---
Anything you neeed??
---
I'm on PS4 and I've seen a player with it before. A while back. He said it was a quest reward. I myself never could find much other information on it.
---
That would be fantastic
---
The striped suit from twitch prime works for me
---
No I'm good man. Thanks though!
---
Yeah claiming a workshop in adventure mode basically makes you a target. Good advice!
---
While awesome the map does not seem to update in real time
---
I noticed this in survival and other pvp adventures
---
hm good point, but I‚Äôm still in the camp of what op is saying since 99% of the time I‚Äôve been Trade glitch‚Äôd is bc I was near an event earlier or the last time I logged out
---
it‚Äôs time they do something about the  glitch
---
I had a similar looking event outside of the Charleston Courthouse the other day, xb1, also. I could turn and look different ways to avoid it, but it made getting into the courthouse very difficult
---
I remember when people used to use that cave to try and glitch to the dev room üòÖ
---
Thank you!!
---
If you‚Äôre on PC you can have your pick of any number of my legendaries and all of my ammo.  It‚Äôs the holy grail and I‚Äôd give almost anything for one!
---
Edit: I also have some of the rare plans from the event if you want those as well.
---
You may want to think about investing in some rad resist then to keep yourself from getting cooked by ghouls.
---
Thats would be cool to have a browser map or something for it, I have it on minecraft as 1 of my mods so would be cool to have on this too
---
You're welcome!
---
That would make more sense. I really doubt people figured out how to get into the dev room on ps4. I wonder why there‚Äôs basically no info about this paint anywhere on the internet
---
Someone hooked me up for free. Come see my shop. Add D-Wall317 on PSN and let me know if I have something you want. As a gift!
---
What‚Äôs your PSN?
---
And I crashed right after lol
---
Nah its alright, they just need to expand their team, like, bring in a new team to work on that
---
Sounds great, I'm slmick5
---
But you read the plan so why would it still be there. I‚Äôm a bit confused
---
The one I killed was on the shore just outside the abandoned house. There should have been a nest on the ground that had the bone meal.
---
Lol
---
Just curious, how do you even hold that many caps? Just have 5 characters and switch to them all during a trade?
---
what would you put in place of those things? Also, isn't 15 STR pretty much a no-brainer for unarmed/ melee? I didn't see many other necessary STR perks to take
---
Haha this happens to often.
---
o__O)
---
The imposter sheepsquatch helmet definitely works with the costume imo
---
Like aids? So you can run around and give people purple aids? Perfect.
---
Yes.
---
They need to just leave it be and work on the base game more. Need more content!!! And any bugs left squished! Hoping wastelanders is not a total bust!
---
I never researched much but I'm about the same level and ive been running rifleman perks boosting up semi auto rifles, vats and gun smithing.  Using a level 25 lever action gets me great damage.  I need to embrace a melee weapon.
---
You want power armor for the perk stabalized though. It makes the build work unless youre only running explosives.
---
My favorite comment I see is "Bethesda never acknowledges any of the issues" but almost all of the issues people are referencing are listed on their "know bugs and issues" page on their official site which unfortunately has no where near the traffic reddit does.
---
Stealth commando relies heavy on perception, Agility and Luck is optional, You can apply vats as a nice addition 
---
Strength - 5 Only bandolier and travelling pharmacy
---
Perception - 10 for commando perks and concentrated fire
---
Endurance 5-6 for Adantium skeleton and Fireproof
---
Charisma is optional but use tenderizer as extra damage
---
Intelligence 7 depends if you use an explosive gun
---
Agility at 9-12, for covert OP, Sneak and escape artist and Thru hiker
---
Luck - Minimum 8 and it can go up more for Vats perks
---
its a fun way to play, I go through west tek 1 shotting everything
---
There are people who actually enjoy the game mode. Heck, I know people who exclusively play Nuclear Winter.
---
Just because you don't like a game mode doesn't mean it should be removed or stop receiving updates.
---
Look at some of the CoD games for example. There are people who exclusively play multiplayer and others who exclusively play zombies.
---
Also, the recent updates have been minor changes. They're not putting as many resources into it as you think because it is not the biggest part of the game.
---
The gatlinggun is the most economical heavy weapon and should be your go to weapon unless fighting difficult content. crafting 180 5mm rounds is so freaking cheap its hilarious.
---
Yeah PS4 NW is hella fun
---
Yeah. It would look less suspicious if the wording was "discount on atoms"
---
Stabalized is one of the best perks out there though. Going heavy gunner without it seems useless to me. You can also run emergency protocols if you want to run a bloodied build.
---
Im running 15/4/1/9/9/9, but its not optimized at all, i usually have all the heavy gunner perks equipped with bear arms and bullet shield for 15 str. Tenderizer and lone wanderer takes up 7 cha, but i could probably get 10 so i can fit suppressor.
---
8 points in int for stabalized/gunsmith is also recommended.
---
8 points in agility for actionboy/adrenaline is also great.
---
Iv seen people run alot of luck for mutations etc. But i atleast have bloody mess and one gun army equipped always.
---
Relog
---
My favorite thing I see is, now I'm not gonna name names but a certain youtuber who's video thumbnails which make it look like every game company is lucky to survive anything, like its an actual apocalypse every time anything remotely bad or "bad" happens.  
---
  
---
Like, this is the ["videos" tab](https://imgur.com/eeuKvBF) on this youtubers channel, look how literally everything is an end of the world crisis for game companies
---
I've always wanted a pizza cutter as a melee. 
---
I also want to see the Plasma Defender come back, I loved it in 2/NV.
---
And I thought I am wasting my money.
---
All I know about the gilded minigun is that was an extremely small chance for it to drop in the garrahan building.  
---
The gold paint for the 44 is similar but noticeably different.  
---
https://i.imgur.com/35Y2qXb.jpg
---
Jesus 60k are they role playing the fallout world inflated prices
---
Is that the Asian sensations, as I like to call him, videos? Lol
---
Didn't realize the perk would work with my TSE, you just changed the way I play the game.
---
Two words Holo-Rifle
---
The only issue I have is that 50% of these are way too modern compared to the style of Fallout and FO76. I believe 60s is as far as modern should go, and that 70s is way too much.
---
Well I hope he's happy. I uninstalled this shit few days ago..  Sad I was actually having a lil fun with the holiday event and planning on trying to get a few more recipes. I'm not just blaming bethesda I also know the hackers are total shit bags too. And you don't have to wish bad on people like that.. Karma will get them. But after keeping on with the game through the 250 "fix" bug that made all my high end armor useless and all the other shit since beta... this was it for me. I'm no Elite gamer but I give to my friends and to total strangers whenever they needed something in game. The kind of people you need to foster a good community in this game and I'm done.
---
I think the people behind this need to go to jail. It's a little more than a ToS violation at this point. A stretch behind bars will put these pricks in their place, cause frankly, they are nothing more than sad little fucks hiding behind their monitors. 
---
I'll continue to play regardless, just as I continue to live my irl life when other pathetic little cunts try to terrorise us with bombs and whatever. 
---
As Churchill said "we shall never surrender".
---
Lets just say his name sounds a lot like LegacyKillerH*C*  But remember that he is not only a C, but also a massive D
---
Me too but I hope they will think about it and let us take the part of creativity to bridge over the time till wastelanders comes. I have the same problem with floating objects in my camp, but my location is the only one with the tunnels ive found in the game, without any locations nearby.  I cant build next to the rail thats above the tunnel what means I have to improvise to solve the problem, although the camp building is already very restricted.
---
as far as i have seen, it only negates her base DR and ER. not her passive damage resist bonus
---
I also heard the minigun was patched out around January. It seemed like it was a random mod that could be randomly generated for the loot pool. People were looking for this minigun since we saw it in game but not for a revolver so others might have been scrapped unknowingly. 
---
There is also the possibility it was breifly availible to craft for them from the ATX item permissions breaking a few times. I have had access to loads of atom shop paints I never purchased for breif periods. The gilded minigun looks like a new years sale item in the patch 16 ATX dump.
---
I use a TSE railway with a prime receiver. It does an insane amount of damage from a distance, cripples mobs and ammo is free when you loot the bodies.
---
Plus it holds 10 rounds and makes a 'Choo choo' sound when reloading.
---
I renamed it "The American Express" 'cause I never leave home without it.
---
So how do I get them? What do I need to do?
---
Would be nice if the Nuka Cola plant was a workshop.
---
Unfortunately, no. Armor penetration only reduces DR and ER.
---
The SBQ has the highest DR and DR (300 for both) compared to all other NPCs, so the AA legendary effect works best on her. Bloodied, junkies, and furious weapons still do better damage against her tho.
---
Also, scorchbeasts seem to also resist explosive damage.
---
If they made tradable legendary clothing or accessories, they would probably completely alter the in game economy. Even if they just did 1 star "food build" things, being able to consistently equip 2 extra weight reduction abilities would be amazing.
---
I have run an AA Prime Plasma Gatling and a Hunters Prime Plasma Gatling against the SBQ at close range and seems that Hunters is giving 2 or 3 more damage points per shot than the AA, 26 to 23 or 24.  It seems both should be higher given the Legendary prefixes and that they are both Primed.  I do get some much higher hits but the standard is that.  Against Legendary SB's they both seem to average about 55 points a hit.
---
I mean I would charge that much because prior to this event you had like a 0.05% (might be 0.02%) chance from 3 ash heap events...
---
Yep, looks like the same pattern but without the black
---
May I ask how many hours you put into the game? Screenshot as well.
---
That doesn't excuse harassing and bullying them.
---
TIL, are there alot in the burrowed holes in the wall?
---
Ill try to find it I forgot my Xbox password
---
Oh yeah, that one. They all bright futures in the hate propaganda market. It's unfortunate they make money off it too.
---
Let's rephrase it once more. I'm applying the paradigm about the game being more rewarding. And to compensate that a difficulty curve could've been implemented that goes ever upwards, but very smoothly so that people will barely notice it while playing casually. Do you mind getting more rewards playing the game? I don't. The percentages (if you find them too harsh) are not set in stone and are a subject to change, and of course will need a lot of testing and balancing. So I really don't understand why you're judging from a position as if it already got implemented and already ruined the game for the entire playerpase.
---
To be pretty honest with you, I haven't encountered people with levels above 200 that struggle with game. If they play normally it takes quite some time to come that far. And they'll definitely get familiar with lots of game mechanics along the way. Maybe gaming is really not for them if they spend 200-400 hours in game and still have no clue how things work, I dunno. Anyway, it must be a very small percentage of the playerbase.
---
Also, if I were you speaking about what's selfish and what isn't, I'd also take a note that trying to say to people which opinions are generally "good" and which are generally "bad" is a little bit condescending to say the least.
---
I never discounted other people's experiences, I just didn't write about these experiences. I'd gladly make OP 10 times longer to cover all the details surrounding the topic, but that's not very convenient for me as a non-native english speaker.
---
Also, is your ign "Coxinga"? I started seeing you quite often in the text chat recently :D Mine is VvT btw.
---
I believe there is only one possible location for finding bone meal. Look up a video on the quest and follow it to the location.
---
Ranger build sounds right up your alley.
---
 Level up all the rifleman perks, tank killer, and 1 rank of concentrated fire. 
---
Take the first rank in gladiator perks giving you 30pct boosted 1h melee damage.  Then fully rank the perk that boosts swing speed (the name escapes me). I like fully ranked blocker as well.
---
Lone wanderer and fireproof are nice fully ranked as is action boy.  Starched genes is a must imo.
---
The rest are up to you!! This is a great build for snipers and you can switch out to melee quickly to fight off enemies if you get swarmed. The rifleman build is easy on ammo too. Lever actions are pretty good in this build.
---
Good luck!!
---
Think iv done as little as 3 dmg with a missle launcher on SBs
---
So that makes it okay to harass and bully them? Yikes.
---
Okay that‚Äôs kinda good it means I‚Äôm not alone then! I‚Äôve been playing since beta and this has never happened before hopefully it‚Äôll get fixed at some point. Thanks for commenting
---
You can also run the crafting perks at your camp, just switch them out when you want to build/repair.  I concentrated on the damage perks first then the crafting perks after I had a few spare levels built up.
---
Handmade rifle and/or the fixer for mid range enemies, and sniper rifle or Lever Action rifle for long range. the former two have a decent rate of fire whilst still being a rifle, and the latter two ha e the most bang for their buck per bullet but take longest to fire!
---
Somehow the same perk spread on commando than rifleman for some reason does more damage for less bullets expended!
---
Nice I never thought of that!  Thanks that‚Äôs a great suggestion.
---
Pretty sure it was supposed to be where that alpha deathclaw was pacing back and forth, but I killed him and walked all around the shore where he was at and there was no nest
---
His name is Graham &amp; it is pronounced Grey-am. It is just that Graham can't spell &amp; speaks pidgin English
---
You want twisted muscles, adrenal reaction, talons, carnivore, scaly skin. If you play on teams get herd mentality and do stranger in numbers and it will boost your damage even more. Stack melee/strength boosting meats. Fury is the best chem. Use whisky for tanky bosses and vintage nuka shine for the queen with party boy. Make sure to have one piece of poison resistance at least on your armor if your bloodied.
---
RIP
---
Ya, you waste your damage potential running with crafting cards on all the time. Besides most guns, especially the lever are pretty cheap to repair anyway. The build I outlined above leaves a bit of room for quality of life perks too!! Good luck!
---
I run rank 2 and that's incorrect, you want to run around 30 to 40% health to give nerd rage room to move
---
Mine are at 500
---
I'm asking about bloodied builds not junkies or full health noobs
---
No I'm not a scrub
---
Youre not understanding what's going on
---
Can't wait to see it along with bugthesda finally shuting down the servers and giving refunds to all who bought it.
---
I enjoy it.
---
I have a weak melee weapon and when paired with a simple Chem I can single handedly kill the queen if she lands. I won't divulge it but I'm in no way tailored for melee since I have 3 strength. I would not want it patched.
---
That sounds perfect thanks I‚Äôll start looking into these with the SPECIAL build tool I found online today.
---
Is a lever action craftable or it it something I need to get through a random drop?
---
You clearly aren't reading any of this
---
Yep i do
---
Really? because code developers and modders of the game have been saying its the engine for years, it still has bugs in it left over from Morrowind!
---
That's what I wasnt sure about. If the 70% was attributed to armor/dr or if it was a special effect
---
I would love to get one of each if you still have them. Been trying NW but not much of a PVP player so I prolly won't get them unlocked...
---
GT MagnumForce357
---
Service rifle skin for Handmade or Light Machine gun skin for Assault rifle
---
Did you ever watch Nuka Break from back in the day? I think it was a fo3 spoof but still very good.
---
It‚Äôs ok man I know it hurts
---
I'm pretty sure that FO76 was primarily optimized for consoles and since Xbox One X is the most powerful they made it perform best on that. 
---
I dont say that to be a shill, I say that cause since launch I've had no where nearly as many issues shown/reported on my Xbox as what is shown and complained about on both PC and PS4.
---
Yes it does
---
It‚Äôs tough to know where someone is coming from when they don‚Äôt enjoy something without seeing their perspective.
---
For example, I have over 500 hours in FO76 and I haven‚Äôt played since feb19. At this point in time, I don‚Äôt like the game and where it‚Äôs headed but that doesn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt get my monies worth in those 500 hours 11 months ago.
---
At the same time I don‚Äôt think it is fair for someone to hate on something if they only played 5-15% of the content.
---
For example, the Netflix show The Witcher, RT critics gave a review over the whole series off of ~15% of the content.
---
Either way you have a right to your opinion, I just think it‚Äôs fair for everyone else listening to see if we can take your advice seriously or not :)
---
I'll be happy to play with any if you. I just wander around, usually over encumbered farming Xmas scorched &amp; collecting legendary weapons to scrip &amp; trying to find some decent stuff
---
I'm also on Fallout 1st so we can play on a private server...no pressure, play however you want at your own pace.
---
Aside from what I already mentioned I look for rare collectibles in the game &amp; LOVE to fight Scorched Beasts!
---
I sent you both friend requests
---
Grow a sense of humor, I literally said ‚ÄúI jest‚Äù
---
This seems like a terrible idea
---
The only thing on that list we actually need is Bozar.  The Fallout 2 version, not the poor excuse of a Bozar from New Vegas.
---
You annoying PS4 noobs don't read
---
I've got one. PSN is dtb7591
---
And you just moved over to a Bloodied build, but don‚Äôt know how to make it effective. That‚Äôs clear from your first post. 
---
Being closed minded to advice, when you make a ‚Äòrequesting advice post‚Äô isn‚Äôt a good strategy. 
---
There are pros and cons to both builds. 
---
But calling someone a ‚Äònoob‚Äô when they‚Äôve been playing since beta is cute, kid. 
---
Best of luck. See ya later. 
---
And watch out for those Executioner‚Äôs FFR Gamma Guns. That‚Äôs a silver bullet against virtually every Bloodied build.
---
Lmao the fact you think executioner's is a good effect proves me right
---
Bloodied is not exactly OP, sure you do a lot of damage but take some heavy rads or a strong hit you are dead.. glass cannon builds have their weak points...bloodied builds being no health to absorb more then a hit
---
I fully agree I was the game was fun for a long while then you would just get to powerful or like me my friends have all your scrap deleted after a update  and one other thing we all preorder the 80 dollar version so we did put our money in
---
Agreed in seems a lil to advanced. (Advanced meaning in terms of style)
---
I‚Äôd love to see the M16 return. Would really add to the ranger armor.
---
You are better off crafting or buying one from player vendors.
---
I forgot to add that you probably want to take the sneak perks too.
---
Personally. I think it needs a lot of work. Not gonna say its perfect, cause its far from that. However, i have always loved fallout, and have always wanted an online fallout. So here we are, boom. Online fallout. Sure its buggy af, but its bethesda we're talking about here. Every single game they have ever released has been buggy as hell.
---
Plus, its a rather small team working on this game. So with that being said, im gonna cut them some slack. Theyre trying, and personally im gonna remain a fan. For the love the franchise.
---
Do you think it is possible that they will bring in a new team to do that?
---
Go right ahead. I‚Äôve posted that a lot here to help others. 
---
And to clarify, I only sell the legendaries that I can‚Äôt scrip because I‚Äôve hit my 150 daily limit. When I‚Äôve still got about 20 legendaries left over, I save the best weight/scrip ratio ones to scrip the next day, but the rest need to move so I keep my stash clean. 
---
You might run into the same situation; having more legendaries that you can easily scrip, but perhaps not. Definitely get your daily scrip first, and use the really trash ones like ‚ÄòNocturnal‚Äô and ‚ÄòMutants‚Äô for that.  Ones like Bloodied, Junkies, AA, Quad and a few others might be in demand depending on your customer base. 
---
If you‚Äôre not yet familiar with all the legendary effects, check this out:  https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
I thought in the thread from last night this was a drop in a beta test that stuck around and why it's such a low level.
---
I'm hoping no one is running around thinking this is still finable.
---
Isn't the "proof" of 500+ just from a video where a small fraction of people are robbed and even duplicate players? Like, nothing other than someone saying it and everyone running with it.
---
Your nerd rage never kicks in if you don‚Äôt go below 20%. I always run my bloodied build at 10-15%. Never above 20.
---
You want it to kick in while you're taking damage, the more hp you have the more of a range you have for that 20% and serendipity to proc, also foods to increase ho help a lot on this
---
Got it for 150 the other day and thought that was a steal. Good find
---
Do you know where this thread is? I‚Äôm looking for more info about it
---
I want mine to be active all the time. Not just when I‚Äôm getting hits Otherwise like I said, you‚Äôre better off running junkies if you‚Äôre not taking advantage of nerd rage.
---
Solo has less robots and bs then a group.. 
---
I can solo threw in 15 min ish
---
Found also one for 20 caps. You can't believe how thankful i was. This really made my day, because i thought i would miss the plan by opening gifts... One step closer to fulfill all scout challenges
---
I am taking advantage, must be Xbox knowledge then
---
Against a Bloodied build?  Yes, it is. 
---
You state in another post that you try to stay around 30-40% health. 
---
Executioners does +50% damage (including the Rad Damage) if the Target is below 40% health. 
---
Versus what you‚Äôve stated so far as your build, it‚Äôs a quick kill weapon. 
---
Tell me, what is a better primary legendary effect for a non-Bloodied build to use against a Bloodied build?
---
Did you notice the comments of his viewers on his newest video. It's got them all talking like the hack is still actively going.
---
Ok thanks.  I haven‚Äôt seen many of these perks yet so this is a big help.  I appreciate the suggestions.
---
With that we now have a reason to love the NW rewards. Bet those will increase the value on some things if you sell them or be high value in themselves in trade.
---
quit while u can
---
X
---
ive quit F76 but thanks
---
Fabulous idea!!
---
I forgot about those
---
I did watch that but wasn‚Äôt a fan honestly
---
There‚Äôs also a pump action shotgun version
---
I beat the shit out of one with a modded boxing glove and a bloodied build once, pretty funny
---
OP: u/Sinistas
---
read that in Simon‚Äôs voice lol
---
Ironfist doesn't have 3 levels like gladiator and slugger, there is just the one you can put 3 ranks on.
---
I stumbled onto the bone meal before even getting to that stage in the quest lol
---
What if wastelanders is mostly instanced areas in a separate "world/map" where they do not exist anymore?
---
LOL, how much ransomware do you have? I bet you're still waiting for that Nigerian prince to give you millions of dollars he promised you. 
---
What he could have done is email bethesda and say, "Hey, heads up, I discovered a way to exploit your game, here's how." Not release it to the public so that players get taken advantage of first.
---
I'd stick to large tents, honestly. Maybe a small 2x1 warehouse structure keeping things realistic. Looking at other bases the brotherhood built and used, they kept things Spartan and only really used the bare essentials. I've been toying with a similar idea for a camp build based around what I've seen the brotherhood leave in the bog and I think having a central resource extractor, open air crafting, and 3-4 large tents on wooden foundations would blend in really well!
---
That‚Äôs funny. Bloodied is so good for damage output. Even bad Bloodied weapons are good.
---
Itd still feel weird I'm mean we killed the queen of a hive mind they shouldnt function properly anymore
---
Plz do
---
And you trust no one would use that against you? Isn't that literally how hacking happens. Not getting "PAST" security but convincing security to GIVE you access? z
---
I keep hearing that getting past security is only in Hollywood Hacking, and real hackers get people to do that for them first.
---
Yeah thats what i mean though, its plain to see that none of them have ever played it, the only info theyve ever gotten about it is from him, but the only info he gives out is bad news, because why would you promote a game when you can clearly just harbour a grudge against bethesda
---
That figures. I can‚Äôt play today.
---
No, but i can dream
---
Nice try Todd Howard. Eat sh*t
---
Just mod it in?
---
Literally just a texture file my dude. Super easy to do.
---
Hippies belong chained to a locked gate on a logging road in the 70's
---
Well, the person said it was a bug.
---
It certainly looks like that.  The damage numbers don't match up *at all* with how much her health bar is depleting.  At first, I thought maybe it was some wacky legacy effect, but there's no number displayed for explosive damage or anything.
---
Be cautious against those Executioner‚Äôs FFR Gamma Guns. They tear through most Bloodied builds insanely fast.
---
Maybe they only exist in a small radius around fissures.  I agree though. Maybe the SBQ just gets changed to scorchbeast leader for lore reasons.
---
Queen wasn't the only hive mind
---
I know man
---
Ok, show me how to do this on xbox
---
If you say so, fascist
---
True. The lore of the story will not make sense. It will be very interesting to see what they do with the lore with wastelanders. 
---
Perhaps the scorchbeast queen event will go away and be replaced by another big boss event. Remember the screenshots of that giant wendigo looking thing from a while back? 
---
Has a game ever had its main event replaced with a different main event in its lifetime?
---
There was another?
---
They need to do the opposite of this post.
---
Not sacrifice any resources from the core 76 team but that was never the case anyhow since Dallas was the one responsible for NW.
---
True. But I have been to many events where one person is there with a ranged weapon wrecking her in less than a minute.
---
Shotgun with enforcer perk. Hella fun! üòÇ
---
Technically the raid in wow and intestinal with each new season they due
---
Ment destiny dont know why it auto corrected intestinal
---
Perhaps that's the plan with this game. A season's type approach.
---
Hmm.. yea idk how to do that haha.
---
Lol I was like..."I gotta look that game up. Never heard of it" lol
---
Thatd be cool but I dont have much faith after Robert altmans I review since he thru away everyones good faith
---
That‚Äôs what Yoda said.
---
The rifle build is usefull for leveling up but should morph into comando as soon as possible.  I won't argue the value of an instigating lever action with 9 rifle perks, but honestly, it will one shot most enemies without any rifle perks.
---
Most of this game is about DPS...how much damage can a weapon do over a period of time, say 30 seconds, or 60.  The hunting rifle and lever will never keep up with a handmade - over a period of time.  
---
Bandolier 2 so you can carry all the ammo you want
---
Adrenaline, as many as you can afford
---
Handmade of choice with Powerful Auto Receiver (Bloodied, AA, and Furious are popular)
---
Actually, if you have a pc available it should be easy. Create a .ba2 file with the texture path and you should be good
---
Oh man I need a baby yoda has so adorable but on a serious note was there another hivemind?
---
That‚Äôs where my base was at. I also built outside of the map there. I blocked the entrances with concrete foundations and I had an unbreakable base. But of course it got deleted too.
---
Yeah. I enjoy the game as is so if wastelanders adds to the game but the core game stays as is I wont lose any sleep over it. 
---
They did say in the beginning they plan to support this game for years so it'll be interesting to see what we've been waiting for.
---
‚ÄúThis right here is my laaab!‚Äù Man I heard the 10 year old in you come out :) it put a big smile on my face. Too bad that location was used. Your base made me want to go build there right now!
---
Y
---
The damage number is nice.
---
I remeber that but it feels pretty disingenuous with things lately
---
I figure since it‚Äôs a hive mind, it‚Äôs literally one mind. So, no?
---
Hell ya man! Spread good karma :)
---
Oh srry I thought you where the other guy that said there was another I was under the assumption the queen was it.
---
Thanks, not on currently but I'll shoot you a message when I am! :)
---
Gt: GrowlingTiger44
---
All scorch infected are connected to all scorch beasts. That is why scorch will show up against any sb fight
---
I thought so she where controlled by the queen though
---
I may try it with just tents but fort Adams has a few smaller buildings. I wish we could build the perimeter like they have it at the brotherhood camps and outposts
---
Actually the whole scorch and super mutant thing doesnt even match the lore in the game. Fo76 is only 25 years after the bombs dropped and theres no way super mutants have came to be yet. Oxhorn covers this in one of his videos.
---
No worries. I share your assumption. I was just just being a smart-ass with the Yoda reference.
---
this is what i think as well, i have a gut feeling that SBs will be confined to cranberry bog due to the proximity to the queen.  it could also work into a "humans cant push to far into the bog" kinda thing for the current questline
---
Huh, didn't know that. Originally, my concept for my character was going to be "sharp dressed sniper", but found the pastor thing first, and liked it (with the skull mask). Now I'm "Vater Geist" (Father Ghost).
---
I started as a Rifle build too. Ended up using a hybrid Rifleman/TH Melee/PA LMG. I am using TH melee when I am low on ammo, PA LMG when fighting SBQ and for everything else I am using my good old TS Handmade rifle.
---
They should replace them with a new enemy type. While the reign of the scorched beasts ends, the terror of the West Virginia Northern flying squirrel begins.
---
I remeber that but they do mention that the West Coast mutant where around longer than the east coast ones thats how they explained how big they got in 3
---
You can‚Äôt seem to read. I‚Äôm on Xbox and sometimes console. Not PS4. 
---
I don‚Äôt have little girl hands that would fit a fragile little PS4 controller.
---
Giant flying acid pooping rats
---
Np .. glad I could help .. hope you got your jetpack created ..
---
Baby yoda duhast
---
Lead by a queen yes.  Controlled to the point they lack the capability for independent thought and action. Not so much. Least I do not remember any lore that says so.
---
Hahahahha I can agree with you there
---
Definitely a bug, but looks like it might have something to do with a bloodied build.
---
something something WestTek experimenting pre war on the citizens of Huntersville..
---
I happen to like Free States the most, so I was lucky with the bundle. But I can‚Äôt fathom why BoS doesn‚Äôt have a bundle as well!
---
He also revealed in his theft video the exact name of an alt account for a Christmas give away 5 days ago so they could ban it as well.
---
This is from dev room.
---
I have seen a gilded pump shotgun and a gilded single action revolver before too.
---
TBH, I don't see ranged weapon SBQ kills happen that often.  It's either a very obscure bug or an exploit.  I normally hit the SBQ in the thousands, and I don't move her health bar nearly as much as his double-digit damage seems to.
---
...... 
---
I'm not seeing your point......
---
And I'm pretty sure today's challenges are the easiest they've been in months.
---
With this game you think I'm just paranoid?
---
Hmm. I still dont understand how there would be behemoths and stuff yet. Definitely the scorch beasts. 25 years just doesnt seem right
---
Yeah I get how people have a bad taste right now. I still enjoy the game as do a lot of others. I'm all for people voicing their opinions but it has gotten to a point where most people aren't civil about it anymore. Resorting straight to calling people who do still play names and stuff like that. I don't understand it. Im the type of person where if I don't enjoy a game anymore I just quit playing it and walk away. I won't even visit the forum for said game anymore either. I feel like there is no point in being actively involved in a community forum for a game I don't play or enjoy anymore. 
---
I see too many people here hating on the game but they will admit they quit playing it. So why are they here still bashing the game you know? Why can't they move on? It's like certain types of people have an addiction to being angry at something or someone.
---
I lost my power armor except the chassis fighting the scorchbeast queen while a naked guy ran around the crowd of players and i'm on ps4 .
---
They are used as ammo in some weapons right? Although I would love this too. I use them like candy. Recently found a guy selling 30 new for 100 each. Got them all.
---
Railway rifle is amazing, you do need Bandoleer perk with it. But it is really nice for those days you just dont feel like farming lead nodes to make ammo, just make a ton of spikes with steel only
---
Imho VE GP is best used while jetpacking...
---
Also a little tip: Formula P tightens the spread of beam splitter; great for long-range pve/pvp action
---
That‚Äôs a normal price, people usually sell for 1c per charge
---
Bear Arm. IIRC, the plan is only obtainable from Project Paradise. After you learn the plan, then legendary variants can drop.
---
Since you have to complete that event to have a chance at learning the plan, it‚Äôs fairly rare I‚Äôd say.
---
depending on the weapon, I find it almost impossible not to fire 2 or 3 shots with one "tap" using a railway rifle or 10mm SMG
---
The kill legendaries with a boxing glove or Fatman is easy.. and btw it's a weekly challenge so there's plenty of time to get it done.. :)
---
Ok that actually fills in some holes then
---
I found an instigating hunting rifle but it‚Äôs only lvl 20. They should allow you to spend scripts on upgrading weapon levels.
---
on that subject, I wanna see those vulture scorchbeasts in action! There‚Äôs tonnes of cool unused shit but they‚Äôre by far the standouts imo
---
Yeah, I suggested the same thing, It really is a great weapon, I use an FE auto rwr
---
You can‚Äôt get into the dev room on PS4 though
---
Why are you getting downvote this is kinda funny
---
Perhaps it's a bug of some kind that people know how to replicate and they keep it a secret to themselves? Just the other day I launched one on the queen. Traveled and repaired my weapon at the shack by the drop site, ran out of the shack and there were only two other players there and they had her almost dead. One guy was carrying a .50 cal of some kind and the other player had put his weapon away once she died so I never got a good look at what he was using because he was messing around with his stash box in his tent after she died. I was able to hit her enough to loot her so I went back to my camp and didnt stick around because like I said I've seen quick deaths so often I didn't think much of it.
---
Fuck yeah, "like a freight train going up the ass of the competition WHOO WHOO!!"
---
That's what I was thinking based on his health bar.
---
I dont understand. If you dislike this game, why be apart of the reddit?
---
The game is great, and im sorry you feel as if you need to discourage others from playing.
---
Where is the event?
---
I thought the dev room was a literal physical door you entered? I have seen the one on PC, hence why I've seen the guns. These also can have effects on them, the gilded pump was a lvl 15 bloodied shotgun.
---
It depends. Also depends where you are downed. Sometimes you fall behind a structure that provides some cover. Or sometimes you can have another teammate provide cover.
---
That's a Bear Arm.   It's a drop from Project Paradise.  The plan can also drop from the same event, but the conditions are very difficult to achieve (all animals must survive) and its mods have to be learned the same way.  Once you know the plan for the Bear Arm, you have a rare chance to get a Legendary one from Murmrgh.
---
Gameplay-wise, it's basically a Power Fist.  It makes a rather quiet roar sound when you punch something.  It's kind of a novelty, you get bragging points for having something different.
---
Obnoxiously, the Scorched in this event never drop them, despite using them.
---
Arktos pharma
---
It was a room under the map that pc players could only get into because they installed mods. On PS4 modding isn‚Äôt possible
---
Yeah I agree. It is time to let up on the raid restrictions, especially since a ton of people already have the raid armor without even doing the raids.
---
How much would they even be worth?
---
I think to earn it you have to keep all 4 friendly animals alive for it drop.
---
They already said this isn‚Äôt happening
---
Basically waiting for wastelanders now
---
Event is called Project Paradise, and it comes up in rotation from the main events - it's located at Arktos Pharma. You have to keep all the NPC animals for the event to have a chance to drop the plan.
---
If you're on XB1 and want one, I can craft one for you!
---
You can get into it as well by breaking the ground and placing things to go under. Underbase instruments is how people do it. No mods needed, just some clipping that drops your items you need down there
---
What are beach boys, if I may inquire?
---
Also that TSE Laser is wildly inaccurate; you may want to switch to some other explo type.
---
Agreed I still play a few hours a night not like I used to but still enough and it is bad that we have to have such a negative stigma as fallout players
---
If you think this game has it's second dream moments then I'll have to disappoint, for me the big highlights are: the camera mode, the fact that you can be stupidly op and how the place looks..
---
 there are a fair few audio logs but not much of an overall plot, woman go find nukes so you go find nukes first because reasons.
---
Before this event they were so rare they‚Äôd be going for basically anything the seller wanted, now everyone is a little unsure how much to charge, the consensus seems to be around 5k but plenty of people still wanting more and others charging a lot less
---
We don‚Äôt really know how common they are now so the price is all over the place
---
Pens are a great idea. Anything to make tamed pets more useful and consistent.
---
Probably an exploit, then.
---
Yessir. Part of the airborne now, haha
---
Other crestur i'm really waiting for is the colossal wendigo from the upcoming dlc, the normal wendigo is already scary when it surprises you but the colossal one is an eldritch horror
---
After doing the queen at level 11, everything else in the game will be so anticlimactic for him though, lol
---
So they arent gonna change there mind last minute like before?
---
I tried to convince them not to come along, I couldn‚Äôt really stop them ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
They are used as ammo for gatling lasers however
---
No you can‚Äôt. On pc you had to use a teleporting hack and input the dev room ID. It was so far below the ground that there was an automatic teleport back to the surface when you reach a certain point. No way to reach it on console.
---
Like before? When did they change story/lore at the last minute before?
---
Lol, good on him for only dying once though. That‚Äôs impressive.
---
Without PA + Stabilized you'll be severely crippling your dmg and accuracy, especially with that TSE LMG (which is a great gun of course).
---
Behemoths yes I agree , I‚Äôm not sure why they‚Äôre around however Scorch beasts were originally irradiated bats which the enclave exposed to Biochemicals in 2083, therefore it‚Äôs not the radiation which made Scorchbeasts  ; its the Enclave purposely experimenting on them in a controlled habitat in order to create a beast.
---
I use it to spray the ground people when we resort to stealthboys I also PvP in 3rd person
---
People have stuff that they didn't earn, so probably not
---
Oh andnit was a raider group on face book and xbox
---
Oooh thanks for shedding some light! Cheers
---
I sold one for 7600c. After the Christmas even went live.
---
They can be traded. That's on Bethesda for fucking up, not the players.
---
The only plothole that comes with wastelander is, that people are still coming out of the vault, that got sealed away for good :x you can even read that inside vault on of the computers that there will be no air after 24 hours lol.
---
Yes, I'm on Xbox one and I'm a level 45, if you can, can you make it a level 50 please? I'd rather wait to use it so it can do as much damage as possible if that's an option
---
Same happened to me after not playing for a long time. I found my base deleted there.
---
Some are easy and some not so much....Some days I get the list that I cant do anything on....
---
No, I picked one up without knowing what it was, how can I be punished for that?
---
I play NW on PS4, can confirm it is indeed fun. Lol
---
An efficient one at least lol
---
That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm looking at it. Just curious what their stance will be lol like we will hear a thing about it!
---
Well you need to consider into the fact that technically, these guns are canon in the Fallout Lore (At least those that aren't in Fallout Tactics if you want to be specific.) Either way, the Fallout universe would still have to go through the modern era whilst advancing on weaponry with everything else. Sure, some things would've changed since after WW2, but there's a lot of potential that they can tap into.
---
I think they were saying that you‚Äôre going to meet two of the NPCs inside the vault. So I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll be introduced from the very beginning. I still plan on using my main rather than starting from scratch.
---
No. It‚Äôs not like people are using an exploit to get them.
---
It's the responsibly of the company to fight back against it, so yes. I also support exploiters, I've been someone who exploited bugs to get an advantage in hope the dev's would hear me out when they messed up. The thing is, most dev's dont care or simply dont know how to fix the issue. For bethsada, I think they honestly dont care. So why should I care what these players do to each other?
---
Yea im kinda in between. I just wanna make sure its not gonna be super low-level, with low-yield rewards.
---
See why can't we have fun spread the fun and joy! The hacking fucking BS and ruining others doesn't prove your anything to Bethesda or anyone else well except that you are a POS.
---
I've pretty much got everything in game. I mainly farm legendary stuff waiting for the next big update so I'm good.
---
That makes sense. I hope not, that would be disappointing. Or maybe only the first few quests? I really hope it‚Äôs something that caters more to high level end game players
---
I didnt even know you could get pets. So yea.. thanks for that info haha
---
Im guessing its the pacify perk?
---
I thoight they where coming from outside of appalachia and stuff
---
Never used to work that way buying them so I Would say it is a bug
---
Solar because Thron is good for Meele, best meele effect is unyeilding but unyeilding can't be dropped on Thron
---
I ment the promotional stuff wastelander is one legendary players is another keeping nuclear winter all thru summer was another
---
I would like the experience to tailor to all players. Low and high levels. Maybe make the enemies scale to your level? That would be neat
---
What, play Whack-A-Mole with the accounts? You can buy another for under $8... The problem is that this is possible at all. The fault lies squarely on Bethesda. They are the only ones who can prevent this from happening. They could have better verification of the client side code. They could file an injunction against the makers of the software used or press criminal charges (copyright laws). This strong arm tactic was necessary in GTA Online, but they waited too long and the method was less effective.
---
Oh yeah they look really cool, wendigos are one of my favourites. I wanna run the WS golf club but have all the ghouls replaced with them, proper endgame content lol
---
Why not assasins sentinel armors?
---
I've got a BOS character with a full on outpost build that looks incredible on PC that I have setup underneath a power pylon. Using the natural terrain in the area to defend the camp from the high ground along with walls blocking the two entrances setup with rocket turrets and defendable check points. The camp itself consists of two metal structures; one with the power station and the second to protect the shop. The rest of the camp uses large tents as sleeping and crafting quarters that are based off of existing BOS outposts around the map. I would be happy to show off the build if you are interested in checking it out.
---
I'm dizzy after reading this.
---
What happened to the victims last time? Did they get all their stuff back?
---
I wish I was on pc to see that
---
You think he does this so he can have those items? lol......OMG....No, he cares not one shit about those items. He got his sweat salty tears. Theory of mind is something people struggle with until they are well into adulthood.
---
I used to rock it but having both my prefixes working at the same time when you need it was unreliable
---
And how does this change anything? One guy can ruin your experience and none of you guys believe Bethsada is capable of protecting any of you from it. After everything this company put you through and the fact that they cant look out for you, you guys still play. So enjoy your game. Tell us more about your life changing stories this game has made on you're lives, like how all your time being wasted by a single user.
---
Weird i with my handmade dose 442 each hit and i can see it move and kill her within 10 mins myself on my rifle guy.
---
I agree, that would be neat. They really need something that‚Äôs more of a challenge for the high level players.
---
Also this is xbox
---
I'm sure ps4is different
---
Gilded minigun and red asylum uniform have got to be up there now, especially with the plasma plans becoming more common.
---
The rare fasnacht masks too but not convinced they dropped on console
---
I‚Äôm a collector on xbox and I have had gilded miniguns from way back in the day. They drop from scorched conquerers, it‚Äôs extremely rare tbh. This screenshot of the pistol is most likely on pc with a ps4 controller input, just like the photos of the rare faschnacht masks and other stuff seen and questioned on this sub in the past. Just my opinion, but I‚Äôm fairly certain this does not drop unless it was added in with the latest patch (I don‚Äôt datamine so I couldn‚Äôt be certain)
---
Its definitely an exploit. All damage to the queen is reduced by 70%, THEN those hits are applied to her 300DR/ER resistances, and finally applied to her health. She has \~32.7K Health, so his numbers make very little sense because his bursts are only about 400 ish damage total but taking off \~10k health. Though, it could just be that the damage numbers shown are wrong which happens in a lot of games I play.   
---
I know there are people out there using some exploit to kill her insanely with ranged but they are not as common anymore. Usually fast kills are just some guy with a tweaked out stealth melee build that you cant see crouched under her.
---
&gt;The fault lies squarely on Bethesda. 
---
Stopped reading after that. Might as well say the police are squarely to blame for crime.
---
Depends what system ur playing on, which system r u on?
---
level 1 Nocturnal 3\* rolling pin with damage reflect while blocking and +1 agility
---
Check your pipboy, it is still reclamation day. Wastelanders is about people coming back to the Appalachian region.
---
Lol I've sold this plan multiple times for like 5-10 caps
---
It is all random when the 75% works but you significantly up your chances when you have assasins + sentinel. It is without a doubt better for surviving in pvp than uny/sent
---
The wasteland is a dangerous place! I saw someone trap their Deathclaw in their living room using furniture. I‚Äôm not sure if this works because I don‚Äôt have the perks unlocked to be able to tame creatures
---
I would like them to put "Armor" and "Clothing" as separate as well.  Then add a "Legendary" Tag also.
---
This way if a camp has 20 "Armor" and 20 "Weapons", I would see "Weapons 20" "Armor 10" "Clothing 10" "Legendary items 25".  From this I can easily see there are 10 Legendary Armor pieces, and 15 Legendary weapons. 
---
Too often I go to a camp with 20+ weapons and armor, just to find Civil war clothes and basic shotguns.
---
Nicely done dude!!! Keep up the good work helping the rookies.
---
I used to say the same thing but serendipity is probably the single most powerful perk in this game and basically having it always active help more
---
Easy glassed cavern,  been glitching out the spawn in there since the event started I'm sick of the place üòÇ
---
I can't see them caring too much about that.
---
What I think happened.. and I am not defending Bethesda is that the common word was the hack would be released on Wednesday (Christmas Day). So they opted to work on and test the fix before releasing it on the following Tuesday which is when they typically have maintenance. ErectBan figuring that it might get patched out sooner than later released it intentionally on a Sunday afternoon where nobody would be around to do anything about it.
---
Everything adds up so if you want to be as good in pvp as possible you use serendipity -with- ass/sent armor
---
You should try and focus your build on one weapon class. I was a semi-auto rifle guy for a long time, then I switched to commando and never looked back.
---
Start by getting level 1 in rifleman, master rifleman, and expert rifleman (or commando). Level 1 in each will give you a ten percent increase per card, for 30% increase. Start with that and see which you like more before investing more perk points into the cards.
---
Also strongly recommend tank killer at 3, and concentrated fire at 3 if you use VATS. Unlock and use bloody mess at 3 when you can use it. Also make sure you get starched genes at 2 and take advantage of mutations!
---
I‚Äôll stick with my main and only character...
---
Thanks for the mention, and passing this along!
---
The majority of the games data is stored client side.
---
There's you answer.
---
But thats the issue with seredipty on a full health with sentinal assassin it is inconsistent cause you have to reach a specific threshold be fore the game triggers it where as when your already bloodied it is almost always active
---
Well, if the police is supposed to guard a place but leave for 3 hours to eat donuts with the frontdoor wide open, they kinda are. Opportunity makes thieves.
---
Oo Oka
---
Ive also been where sentinal assassin since before the nerf they suffered have the unyielding aspect grant you almost 500 AP with dodgy is absurd
---
Except the Police don't program software for criminals to use...  
---
What you are saying makes literally no sense.
---
The NPCs will be outside the entrance of V76 so you don't NEED to start a new character. The confusion probably came from the article series being named "Inside the Vault".
---
You can still play low health even with ass/sent armors... uny bonus does nothing to your ranged  weapon damage
---
This kind of crap has been going on since release day. So much of it was totally BS, like all the people claiming they were losing random weapons or armor but who couldn't ever seem to duplicate it or provide any evidence of it. If this guy's MO is to boast and beat his chest before he shows anything then he's probably less than honest--but these days people believe the dumbest crap.
---
I've been off this sub for like six months, hadn't played the game in a while but decided to pick it back up, and missing all this pointless drama hasn't hurt me one bit. I've been excited to play again and loving all the stuff that's new to me. In my opinion trusting random YouTubers or Reddit users for news or information is a terrible idea.
---
I'm a bit shocked those channels are still alive, the niche audience seems like it would have continued to shrink or get sick of all the negativity. How many videos can these channels churn out about the same thing?
---
Edit: I apologize for the length but one last thing, this very kind of post by the OP seems to serve to promote these kinds of players and ideas. I fully support the old school idea of "ignore them and they'll go away."
---
Thanks for this because I‚Äôm a dedicated Responder character and didn‚Äôt want to lose my good outfits
---
I don‚Äôt fully understand how damage with AA weapons is calculated. Using an AA rifle with tank killer at is supposed to be able to penetrate 70% of armor, but I don‚Äôt see that translate to the damage numbers. I‚Äôve found I get far higher damage with junkies weapons for example. Bloodied is even a step above that in damage.
---
Don‚Äôt you get this every roll from murmgh?!?
---
Tbh your just trying to prove a useless point and should've taken your own advice buddy roo.
---
Your rightbit just gives you significantly more action points and the ability to be right infront of someone to get sneak attack bonuses
---
Dodgy only reduces the damage a bit, not neglet it
---
Don't you mean +1 charisma? :P
---
Correct by 30 points if I'm not mistaken
---
it‚Äôs nice of you for helping others that need it the most.
---
In pvp the damage cap is reached very easily so it is not that vital
---
i thought that you can still go back inside the vault with your character after your leave? But you are correct, they were saying they‚Äôre right up front the vault
---
 Only can tame ones on random encounter zones.
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll do anything, it‚Äôs a little similar to the high capacity backpack plan glitch when that came out- we all got to keep our backpacks!
---
no you dont you only need the plans for the fixer, the sheepsquatch weapons and the shepards crook
---
The default sort order for the notes tab is alphabetical descending.
---
YOu have to roll the list to the P section to read Plans you find that you don‚Äôt know.  They are listed under the notes tab as Plan:whatever.   Once you read it, it‚Äôs name changes to 
---
(Known) Plan:whatever and it moves to the top of the of the list. (Since parenthesis are first alphabetically) 
---
So ...  I got the plan.  It was listed correctly in the Notes tab.   Pressed X to read it. Game crashed.  
---
When I logged back in, the plan did not appear in the list as a (Known) Plan: Megasloth. Nor did it appear as Plan: megasloth.  
---
Still doesn‚Äôt appear.
---
OTOH, the other plans are named  (Known) Plan: crashed Santa (2), (Known) Plan: mounted tick (14), etc,  indicating that I not only know the plan, but have 14 of them (to individually sell, give away, whatever)
---
Again, damage gap in pvp is there so sneak attacks are useless. And when you are crouched to attack sneak your sentinel does not work
---
The western outfits and the other ones from the rare bot vendor
---
Can anyone confirm this is true or not for the Halloween rewards? Would love to grab a glowing skeleton outfit on PC.
---
The rare bot vendor?
---
I‚Äôd actually love a weapon that boosted Charisma, to be honest.
---
My wild ass guess is that Bethesda employees are in this thread. Anything that places any blame at all on Bethesda is down-voted until it is ghosted. All of this, from the buggy spaghetti code to their lack of legal response to the situation, is Bethesda's fault. No one but Bethesda can fix FO 76. No one but Bethesda can prevent hacks. No one but Bethesda can prevent my desktop from losing over 200 pixels from my desktop every time I leave the game (they stretch 3840 to 4096). And those stack; multiple proper exits of the game will result in losing progressively more and more of my desktop space. After a few exits I lose two columns of icons, and cannot even see the option to shut down or restart. The only fix that I can do is restart my PC... every time I exit FO 76.  Only Bethesda can fix that very specific issue. 
---
tl;dr this is ALL entirely Bethesda's responsibility.
---
Not currently.
---
Its not from the dev room, for pc as far as i know it only exists because of the spawning it items hack (spawn in the loose mod and attach it to the pistol) or a much earlier hack (1-2 months after release) that did the same thing, but only for craftable objects, of which the paint mod is one.
---
I can confirm this is not true for any other Nuclear Winter challenge reward.
---
Yeah I guess with selling to vendors and wastelanders coming I figure it'd be better
---
Also for the bear arm you need to know the plan
---
Unlikely. They didn‚Äôt crack down on people having the Nuke Globe or Deathclaw Topiary that didn‚Äôt buy them.
---
The one spawning by Charleston station
---
I don‚Äôt think they will ever have high value since I plan on giving away hundreds of them for free.
---
as long as ive played ive never seen a deathclaw on deathclaw island
---
i place rubber bands on my controller make sure is on Left Stick and the Right Stick as that wont kick you out and be at your camp.....i check every hour on the character and go collect and repeat (private world) my experience the Santatron collects more in an HR not just 1 gift.
---
Alright, appreciate the reply so I didn't waste time searching.
---
Fair enough.  Didn‚Äôt want you to think I would be trying to take advantage of your generosity. :)
---
Yeah armor penetration seems tough to judge for me. I mean, if you had AA legendary, tank killer, and perforating mag, that adds up to over 100% so do you ignore all resistance or is it capped at 90 or something?
---
Ill give ya 7 caps for it
---
Honestly the nurf/buff cycle is in every online game I've played.  I'm a minmaxer so I know all too well how much effort it takes to switch from one character config to another when these things happen to hit you.  But, you just have to accept that the rules are the same for everyone and the more specialised your character, the more susceptible you are if the nurf bat happens to hit your setup.  You just have to suck it up, roll with it, (find out what the new meta is ;) ) and change it up.  In a way it keeps things fresh, though it is pretty demoralizing.
---
I'm just not seeing it if you wanna help me test I play on xbox and am always looking more more help testing effects
---
[PS4] I feel like the rarest thing on PS4 would be the Marine Armor Helmet - the ‚Äúcolourful‚Äù one, not the wetsuit/tactical one. I‚Äôve seen two posts online in my life time of people having them on PS4, although I have not seen them in game myself, so the videos/photos could of been fake.
---
It sucks as that is the one thing I wanted the most. A benefit of being on PC.
---
This is from the guy stealing items in the video: "I'm __________ this is what I do. I don't do it for the items I do it for the fun of it, I've collected every outfit, I'm loaded with legacies, dev room stuff, ideal weapons and armor sets (there's nothing that i legitimately need and almost nothing that don't already have). The kid I mentioned above was done the other night, he was number 257 of the people I've done that to (I keep a list). If you have any doubt's or concerns about the legitimacy of my claims feel free to look me up on M 76 or other trade sub reddits. So long as you are mindful and not a pushover when it comes to trading there's nothing i can do to effect you. If you have any questions about who else i've done this to, other experiences, or feel like stopping by ingame feel free to (PC). "                                                                                                           He needs the items on his account to scam people.
---
I've been selling all found plans/recipes for 3 caps each near the vault entrance over the holidays but some high level player cleared me out the other day.
---
I was in the middle of an event when my caps notifications went mad.
---
Plenty of new players benefited with lots of purchases over the event time so not totally in vain.
---
Too effective.
---
Depends. Also depends on what system you are on. This is my experience for Xbox.
---
For outfits the most expensive is the red asylum. The rare fasnacht masks are priceless, but there is dispute about whether they ever dropped.
---
For guns the most expensive ones right now seem to be god roll fixers. The most expensive would be the bloodied 25 25 fixer I would bet. Bloodied 25 25 handmade is certainly up there, as is a junkies 25 25 fixer/handmade.
---
For unarmed the bloodied SS strength meat hook is pretty expensive. The most expensive melee are the rare bear arms.
---
Then you get into pricing for legacy items. Some of those are hard to put a price tag on. DE weapons are some of the most expensive, especially the DE gatling plasma or DE LMG. 
---
For armor, specific powered pieces can be crazy expensive. Things like powered sentinel assassin heavy combat, heavy leather, or scout for example are super pricy.
---
Torn between unscorched oven mitt and mouthharp...both junk items.
---
Ideally people wouldn't support the game or at least buy it used or don't support Bethesda's greedy mtx Atomic Shop or Fallout 1st. I got the game used for $10.00, and the reviews are completely justified for this game. FO76 is the same as Anthem if you are going to buy it get it the lowest price you can. My personal experience with both would justify that price which is what I tell people about my personal opinion on the game. I know I don't want anything like FO76 again, and especially the bs Bethesda has done. From now on I recommend people to buy anything from Bethesda used and cheapest they can find. 
---
My opinion the game doesn't offer anything better other games give out, but I still love on to see what is/if theirs anything new.
---
What‚Äôs the color scheme??
---
You can search through my post history; I don't think i have made posts about life changing stories fallout 76 has made on me. I was just posting that to show you that he wasn't scamming/hacking because he felt he had been screwed over.
---
I feel you there. I use have a sweet camp in the tunnel at Harpers but alas that too was removed months ago.
---
Wasn‚Äôt aware of that.
---
Ecks bocks
---
I normally wouldn't click on a YouTube link but I'm glad I did this time, great job, RIP cavebase :(
---
Ok I guess illl see you on later
---
No idea. I did the math and that‚Äôs what I ran for the longest time, but I found that it wasn‚Äôt translating to actual damage numbers once they released the option for that. I run a junkies or bloodied build now.
---
Depends on if it‚Äôs legendary or not, and if so, if it‚Äôs a legacy or not. Also depends on what system you are on.
---
Someone on Facebook is selling it right now for PS4
---
"I'm __________ this is what I do. I don't do it for the items I do it for the fun of it"
---
         
---
There you go. So my theory of mind is correct. Thank you!
---
[Charisma 15] tell you what I‚Äôll do 3 caps and I‚Äôll throw in a purified water
---
Not about tears. This takes time and effort. Someone is funding him. He's getting compensated for this shit... He should expose THAT.
---
Yeah agree with this also
---
Have you played Fallout 4, specifically Far Harbor?
---
Im not saying that was the only way, thats just all ive heard, and its not in any dev cells was all i was really saying
---
I have played fallout 4, but not far harbor :(
---
yes but the way he scams people is offering items he has that are valuable. Remove his items and accounts and it would be much more difficult for him to scam people.
---
Unfortunately you can't, but it is a good idea
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Marine_armor_%28Far_Harbor%29
---
[Berry Mentats] I‚Äôll take it off your hands if YOU give me 3 caps because I‚Äôll have to carry it and it‚Äôs so damn heavy
---
Ment to say can't then can
---
Why does everything have to be hard?  You think life is not hard enough as it is. You just have to mention you have a sub and some low life downvotes.
---
It‚Äôs the helmet ( first picture )
---
There is nothing to test, I am giving you the facts. In pvp there is damage gap around 110 per shot for your bullets and the same in the receiving end. Even if you do 9999 dmg per shot while sneaking and with uny agility bonuses it only does max 110 dmg per shot.
---
Same thing with your defences. Even if you have dodgy to reduce the damage by 30%, the other guy still gets to the 110 damage gap with every shot. Hence every measure that you can take to reduce the damage you take (read: 5 x assasins, not unyielding armors) helps you to stay alive. It is mathematics.
---
How many upvoted you? I did.
---
It would be mitigated if the game had some actual damn server client validation. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff processed on the clients end
---
Ok cool maybe Bethesda üòâüòâüòâ will fix that
---
i keep wanting to move my camp but i just like the location too much..up by the Dirt Track
---
Why can't unyielding be on thorn armor?
---
If the engine is okay, what does it need to be fixed for?
---
I agree. I feel like the Gamebryo/Creation Engine is an amazing engine in many ways. The sheer vastness of intractability with objects throughout such large worlds is something I haven't seen paralleled in other games/engines. The engine, for better or worse, is modifiable in ways that no other game engine can be modded, and that has extended the life of games released on it immensely. I don't know if it was the best engine to use for a multiplayer game (and over time it is becoming more apparent that it may not be), but for single player, offline RPG FPS's, I think it's in a league of its own.
---
All that being said, I hope Bethesda continues to develop this engine instead of moving to UE or Unity. I don't feel those engines would suit FO or Elder Scrolls well, at least without significant effort. I also think that rebuilding from the "ground up" would take a very long time, and wouldn't be better than just refactoring the existing engine (just research some world-renown programmers' thoughts on rewriting code vs. refactoring code).
---
Could even make sense from a roleplay perspective. Like, a shiny switchblade that makes you look ‚Äòtough‚Äô.
---
Bffr fixers r king rn and a bffr25 handmade too.  Red asylum is pretty high up there but no where near the fixer or even handmade also the be gatling plasma is valuable but nothing comes close to a bffr fixer especially if that fixer had a good third effect
---
[Charisma 30+]  [Berry mentats] [Formula p] all right here num nuts your gonna give me everything you have aight or else including that heavy ass ultrecite lazar wifle.
---
&gt;"huh huh huh h-hey Bethesda, just use a new game engine!
---
That would cost them money.
---
Most police normally don't "guard" places, they respond and resolve crimes. Typically after they are committed. Could Bethesda and while we are at it, the police do a better job? Of course.  Although that doesn't justify wrong doing or place the blame entirely on them.
---
This repeating narrative of "People who do things that are wrong are validated because an opportunity presented itself to do so" is quite harmful. Are these freedom fighters or modern day Robin Hoods? No. They are people who act on malicious intent that thrive on mischief and the misfortune of others. There is nothing that makes the other side sympathetic in regards to this issue.
---
Oh and along with that stuff unyielding ap sentinel heavy leather armor is HIGHLY desirable
---
Weird. Easily 90% of the time when I go there I find one. Sometimes a magazine spawns there, but it‚Äôs hard to see.
---
What does "legacy" mean?
---
I elevated a 1 tile floor with four walls up one flight of stairs, didn't need a roof. Then I made four walls on the bottom foundation. I located it away from the action at the edge of the build zone. I didn't use turrets but if you don't mind spending the scrap go for it. There are some workshops that are much harder than others to maintain due to type of mobs of course.
---
I have all 3 sets vault armor crafted and have run all 3 for awhile to give them a fair chance. TL;DR version -solar maybe
---
Solar.  Sort of ok, I have been re-rolling pieces on this set occasionally and finally have 1 piece with the rolls I want out of 5.  Vanguard is really the primary that makes the most sense to me since you only heal yourself and nearby team mates while at high health.  I was running a great set
---
Of vanguard scout armor plus instigating melee weapons before the raids and got used to this play style.
---
Thorn.  If you have decent melee weapons you are already 1 shotting everything and really don‚Äôt need the bleed damage boost for PVE. No noticeable damage boost on larger enemies like scorch Beast queen.  A little fun in PVP but not really good for that either.  Sneak perk this set adds is not very good either 
---
Strangler power armor is only set worth crafting in my opinion.  I use a explosive Gatling 5mm and no issues lagging everyone out on Xbox.  Use this set all the time now.
---
I think you severely underestimate the power of being bored. Sure it takes time and effort to trial and error a program that'll do what you want, but it doesn't require much money and someone who is experienced in coding could easily do it in their free time while even having a full time job.
---
Glassed caverns number one! I must have 400 pieces of ultracite ore.
---
Simplest answer is the tears. He said he does it for the tear. Right now I am debating on if I want tears as I write this. Calculating risk/reward.... probability of tears is almost certain. Risk of ban is moderate... Denied... run FalloutQuotes.exe... "If you chain too many assumptions together, you rarely get what you bargained for." AKA Occam's Razor.
---
Means it isn‚Äôt in the game as a random loot drop anymore. Like Explosive Energy Weapons.
---
The solution for me was to exit the game, followed by a full log out from the Bethesda launcher. After logging back in to both, I received the items. Assuming your account linked successfully, this should work.
---
Make and sell Mothman Egg Omelettes is another good one too!
---
I'm not denining the damage gap but there is always a difference when something is applied in practice and paper realieing on the armor to properly proc is unreliable my biggest evidence is when the tweaked the 250 Dr affect they some how created and sub effect of disabling primary effects on armor. I stopped where the sent ass armor because assassin was bugged for patch 12. I'm always up to do testing tho it helps break down the difference in understanding for people.
---
Sounds good, send me a msg - GT same as here! Doing Nuke Winter but once I'm out I'll join in your game and make ya one
---
Ok, thanks
---
Lol I can drop them for you.
---
Saw someone today who got a Gilded .44 thats by far the Most valuable i Heard of
---
I don't buy the motive. This takes time and effort. This hatefest continues to materialize a full year into this game. I believe this person is being paid or compensated in some material way to target this game and this community. This is some terrorist marketing shit either funded by Beths competitors or Beth themselves. Been seeing this for too long on a daily basis.. This is next level fuckery. This dude or one of his crew should expose it.
---
Gonna be completely honest I just thought that was a reward for collecting all the deathclaw eggs
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Bethesda hadn't completely sealed the breach. But I'm still not going to change my play behaviour because some degenerate is looking for attention. 
---
For now it's just a rumour like many others. We'll see what happens in the near future.
---
Ahem *3
---
If someone paid me to hack a game, I'd say I do it for the tears too. Come on ..Easiest EXCUSE is the tears. This guy is out to hurt Beth? Driving sales and users to Private worlds they pay Beth for is hurting Beth? People been saying this games been dying for 12 months.. it isn't. This isn't an assumption. It's a god damned observation.
---
You kinda deserve this for being a toxic community
---
You can do the testing but before that the assasins/sentinel is better on paper
---
3K is a fair price but other people's prices will be all over the place.  Some vendors think their shit is super valuable.
---
Police frequently guards places, that's why you see policemen patrol in airports, train stations or public places. Also, I wouldn't consider bethesda as the police, but the home owners. And they have no doors or windows installed. Everybody would blame them.
---
But honestly, I appreciate what these hackers do. They force bethesda to react and improve their eork which can only be beneficial for future titles. They clearly didn't give a shit about community feedback until now, maybe they start giving a shit now.
---
Yes very agree it is why inever got rid of my powered set
---
Correct, it has a value of zero. Zero value items won't show up in the trading menu with vendor bots
---
It looks like what I said went right over your head, so let me explain it to you. People are deflecting blame from the offender to the enforcer. 
---
Bethesda did program software to use. Correct. It is their duty to enforce the protection of that asset. However they did not program the script to compromise the software. Whether they take a day, week, month or in some cases never respond to a security threat it doesn't mean the offender should be condoned or free of blame. Particularly when these are people of malicious intent.
---
YouTubers profit the most lel
---
Because Bethesda
---
On pc that thing is everywhere
---
Over my head? You wrote 6 words.
---
Bored for a full year eh? This doesn't require much money but it's the efforts make companies money and lose companies money. Get that part? Free time and bored I get... but consider a full year of attention..500+ stripped in a few days in not for tears. That is someone at fucking WORK , yo. Come on. Can see your point, I can...but can ya see mine?
---
I hid in 8623 bushs so you didn‚Äôt have to cheers man.
---
Yes, the style is exactly what I'm talking of. Things are 50's and 60's mainly in design.
---
mostly depends, finding a non-legendary out in the world is rare, it took me FOREVER to learn all the mods for it by scrapping them
---
At the risk of this being a waste of time if the thread gets squashed, and betraying acting like a miserable misanthrope in RL...
---
That broke my heart.  The kid was blubbering and simply didn't know better/was too trusting.  Did he learn a life lesson?  Perhaps, but it was super-shitty.  You can get your rocks off by doing that and then giving the stuff back after, saying "kid, this is why you need to be careful" - still evil for making him cry, but keeping the things, and doing it again and again, is really sociopathic.
---
And, he says something about his father in the video, maybe he grinded the gear for his father and it was actually his dad's account, but that hurt me worse - I'm a few times older than the kid (probably more than old enough to be the kid's father, I'm in my 40s), but just lost my dad last year, and STILL am not over it, so... just visualizing a dad playing this with his kid, and the kid is so upset because he's now lost his dad's gear, it hurt to hear.
---
Over my head? You wrote 6 words.  
---
A better comparison would be to government not police.  
---
Government creates bad policy with loopholes - Company takes advantage of loophole even if it is unethical. No-one gets in shit until the policy is fixed as it is non-functional policy.
---
Why would they do anything. They do nothing with things get screwed up and we pay the price and loose stuff...
---
All they did is shift timelines for development, unless I am missing something? What did they change their mind about?
---
Last minute for realises technically the legendary player was supposed to be in ever upwards and they didnt mention anything till 2 weeks after
---
I would be very interested in finding out how you would respond should you be affected by a hack or other means in the future. Hope it doesn't happen as unlike these people, I don't wish ill will towards strangers.
---
Probably the single best thing they could do for camp building would be to port a version of Place Everywhere.
---
It's the Swiss Army Knife of builder tools: No more collision detection, item nudging, x-y-z rotations, shrink/enlarge, copy parameters and paste them onto another item, and even undo last action (all those times you placed items that disappeared, no longer a problem).
---
Obviously we all super want more budget, but the QOL this mod introduces is beyond comparison. Camp quality and individuality of builds would go through the roof.
---
If you mention you have a sub these days you will attract  some downvotes from certain sad types but heh I slogged it out for a year until it arrived and now I regret not signing up on the first day.  It reinvigorates the game for me.
---
So good on you.
---
What's stopping you, curiously?
---
You're saying you think someone is paying this guy who yeet people's inventory but honestly Fallout 76 is literally just a single player game with some shoddy netcode slapped on, I highly doubt there is any where near as many server checks as there should be, hell even Conan Exiles and Ark have had at one point or another inventory yeeting hacks and they actually have some sort of anti-hack in form of Battleye and AFAIK there isn't any anti-cheat in Fallout 76.
---
All i'm saying is, creating a hack actually doesn't take that much effort it's just experience especially when the game A) doesn't have Anti-cheat and B) For some god awful reason gives the client way too much power with no server checks.
---
It definitely does, and ive enjoyed it so much. The main reason is; I have my camp in a pretty popular spot and it ALWAYS tells me i have to move it or switch worlds. I had to do this 10-12 times to find a world that i could actually play in. NO MORE :D
---
The video of the kid is hard to watch. It is even more disturbing that he was proud of it and posted it to youtube for public view.
---
Not fanboying here.. this could BE Bethesda funding this. This isn't done for fun. Full year of dedicated hate can't be written off as boredom. Dude stripping 500 people, making sure he gets it all recorded, that's not for fun. That's work and you know it. I'm tired of people being so obtuse. You fucking get it but you comment as if such immoral things were unfathomable on your pristine internet. These are the new methods on advertising and anti advertising online. There are no rules. If this group WAS getting compensated they aren't doing anything illegal. Behold the internet..modern day tower of Babel. Babel 2.0
---
Really?!
---
Can I get one and I‚Äôll cover the supplies?
---
Yea I totally agree. To me it kind of felt like they got the write up on Friday and were like welllll we could work over the weekend or...
---
So much typing to say absolutely nothing.
---
People aren't getting paid to abuse this sub and game. The game brings it on itself because its buggy and full of problems, even a year after release. Period.
---
Why does it bother you that I have fun playing a game you don't enjoy?
---
How much was the oven mitt going for? I found one early on and eventually scrapped it to empty out some stash space because I didn't think it'd be hard to find.
---
if we get a "stim machine" i want it to be the model of the auto doc's you see in the silos, you can set a price. or set it for free. cannot be used if at full HP
---
A stable server
---
The hell is that?
---
I'd be pissed at the company and stop using their products. I don't have to do that in this case because I didn't boot up FO76 for months.
---
OK, I am guessing you are a yougling, so I will play nice nice. I will walk you through the second order effects of the the scenario you described. I will use a first person voice that is from the hacker's perspective. 
---
     
---
That's cute, you banned my accounts. I could buy a bottle of Johnny Walker, or I could instead buy some cheap vodka and a couple FO 76 accounts. I can run the vodka through a charcoal filter and it will taste like top shelf.  Now I get a weekend of tears to chase my shots. Score!
---
OK, I know you think you got the ace in the whole. Do you understand the power of exponential growth? I could go over the MySpace worm that a guy  thought would be a cute gag for his friends ended up almosy shutting down the internet.  I could quote a troll looking man named Albert. All I need is someone to trade with me to get the growth started. The first scam I get 2x better gear. Then I do the next scam. Again, I have 2X better gear.  After 10 iterations you have 1000 times as much. After 20 I have 1000 times as much. What you start with is almost inconsequential. 1 or 1000 quickly tends to infinity in the long run. You cannot tackle an exponential growth problem by constraining the initial conditions. One must combat the processes that allows the exponential growth. The solution is doomed from go unless you can see my exploit and ban me in real time. $8 isn't much for salty tears. Can they stop me that quickly, because I feel that is the market value for tears,
---
Rumors of systems not crashing. I look for this land of prosperity however, I have returned empty handed.
---
[Charisma 1][psycho] GIVE IT TO ME NOW!
---
2 handed sword.
---
I have spoken.
---
What about a melee build? Since your points are mostly in strength it shouldn‚Äôt take too long. 
---
You can attack her all the time, but when she‚Äôs flying you can protect those who are shooting. 
---
And when you can attack her it‚Äôs pretty decent damage. I do about 120 when it‚Äôs more than 40% health each hit and I hit about  170 when she had less than 40% health.
---
If they haven't lifted your ban by now, they won't. Many people who were banned for that were unbanned during the summer - looks like you weren't lucky.
---
Sounds good! Msg me on XB1
---
This is why private servers are handy. Join a private server, collect the eggs, than join a public, collect the eggs, join another private, it‚Äôll reset itself, and you can collect the eggs again.
---
Ya I say this cause someone on here claimed it was sold for 30 caps it is not. That's all I was saying
---
I can relate, but in a much more extreme case. Friday the 13th is a game I use to play regularly, but exploits were running wild and even fixs would just lead to more. Almost nobody gets banned unless you were reported by a major streamer. There was even one common exploit they said they wouldn't ban anybody for and would just try to fix it when they get to it. Not even temp bans. 
---
One might say "well that is some indie company", but their current player base vs people working on the game is probably equal to Bethesda.. maybe even greater when you size them up accordingly.
---
With that said, you just mentioned how you haven't booted this game up in months. So are you just here to reap attention on a potentially hot issue that doesn't affect you? Might as well be posting on a Star Wars forum at this point.
---
Currently and interestingly enough, Bethesda does. If this guys goal wants to hurt profits, he's failing spectacularly. Private subscriptions are through the roof. I've never seen so many people playing Private and more are in their own little worlds everyday I log on. The people playing right now have endured an entire year of some of the crazy, game breaking, rage inducing bugs ever encountered in a game..and they continue to play. Attacking/scaring them isn't going to hurt any sales..instead it's driving die hards to pay for First. If the hackers or youtubers had proof these business tactics were being deployed, they should expose that instead of fucking over everyone else for table scraps.
---
No, of course not. At worst, they‚Äôll simply patch it to no longer be tradeable.
---
Distinguished guests would be my pick.
---
Lol yeah I hate events that make no sense so I‚Äôd be down for losing that one. The location would make a great raider spot too.
---
Haha yes bann his 'revealed alt account' would be funny smh.
---
Z
---
I just upgraded a lvl6 9yo with armor, weapons, ammo and chems. I hope they have fun, it is weird because while he is mine, my sons are 8,10,13 so yeah.. had to help out another dweller
---
Been collecting them on both servers without any problems.
---
Commando doesn't stack with heavy gunner, that's just for assault rifles. 
---
Low health is the way to go for huge damage because the bloodied effect, adrenal reaction mutation, and nerd rage perk all stack. 
---
If you want to go full health, junkies is a 50% buff if you have 5 addictions. After that, best bet is probably anti armor. Be sure to utilize bobble heads, psycho tats and ballistic bock for max damage with ranged weapons regardless of your build. Put prime receivers on your weapons if you have the resources to either craft or buy the ultracite ammo.
---
Wearing power armor with emergency protocols helps with managing low health, especially radiation damage.
---
No shit Sherlock, because as has been explained too many fucking times CUSTOMER SUPPORT HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE GAME.  It's a fucking call center, they can't give you SHIT back if you've lost it.  That's why when Bethesda updated everyone on the incident they told anyone effected to submit a ticket just so they have a record of who lost something so the ACTUAL FUCKING GAME DEVELOPERS can handle this shit when they're not on holiday.
---
Well considering it has stolen goods gotten from his hacks it would be the correct action to take.
---
Try the handmade or fixer in commando mode vs rifleman mode, I'm using up far less ammo than I used to in rifleman mode!
---
That‚Äôs what I was afraid of but thank you for the information.
---
I could make a program to do this pretty easily for PC. If there is a lot of interest for it, I would be happy to do it.
---
Yes. This is good for Beth. The only people left playing after a year of this insanity are die hard Fallout players and rather than not play they are being driven to Private worlds..paying for safety. Struggling with the patch being so quick.. Great that it was fast and so close to the holidays like that..bothered that they had this fix just waiting in the wings and that it went off without creating any other problems. Not 100% clear to me what's happening here or who is to blame but I think the groups attacking have thee answers.
---
I'm a tse build and collector, I have currently 17 uses. My level 123 is proof you just have to have the right cards. All of my weapons have roughly 300dps even after the nerf ( but then again my mains are legacy ;))
---
There‚Äôs some interesting raider lore in that area related to the main quest line so yeah would be nice if it was taken over by raiders again.
---
It's made the game more PROFITABLE.
---
none.. 
---
when i think of events there are some I wish were not in the list for major server events so they would happen more again.. or the rotation would move faster...
---
I never find myself wishing one would go away altogether
---
If the hack were still live you wouldn't be hearing about it a week later from some dipshit's youtube video, you'd be seeing this place burning to the ground with threads about people still losing their shit.
---
It's gotta say unscorched. Oven mitts are everywhere. The clean version and the mouthharp are possible pulls from junk piles. 
---
If anyone knows any other ways to get them, please tell me.
---
Is this the only way to make Bethesda aware of the issues in their game? Honestly Bethesda deserves it at this point if these hacks keep happening. The players don't deserve it, but Bethesda absolutely does.
---
Whatever people tell you don‚Äôt be a bloodied explosive build or anything like that on your first playthrough, just take the game causally so you can enjoy it and not 1 shot everything in sight by level 50
---
Dogwood can go yes. It is just a fasttravel event. Would be more interesting if you had to protect one of those machines and feed it fertiliser that gets dropped by the enemies that try to attack it.
---
I don't want it to really go but Manhunt could be made some more difficult. What if they make Maddog a Behemoth instead?
---
I really hope we get a bunch more events in the future. It is kinda sad they never really seem to add more of them?
---
The whole game.
---
So much typing to say nothing.. pfft. Right back at ya. You can claim that. It doesn't hold water to anyone witnessing this on a daily basis for a damn year.
---
Remember when every other day was threads screaming about how Bethesda was making challenges too difficult/impossible on purpose to force people to buy atoms?
---
Nobody deserves a ban. They should be so lucky anybody plays this as much of a mess as it's been. You should wtite to them and see what they have to say.
---
You don't have enough ice cream seasons on you for it to be entertaining. Good day young Master!
---
Fair enough man that‚Äôs understandable! But would you really miss Dogwood..? Lol
---
Ouch..
---
Fusion core generators at posiden keep my 4 or 5 ultrasite gat lazers topped off. 
---
Kill low level scortched, start power plant, claim shop and power that with Grafton and do a weight room silo run to get all the steel, lead, cores and copper I need
---
The one I had was unscorched. I looked it up after I commented and apparently there is a static spawn at New River Gorge Resort.
---
I dont think any events should go away, rather they should be adjusted so there is more action to a lot of them. There are several that are just to drawn out with very little XP gain or some are just down right boring like project beanstalk. It seems like no matter how many people are at some of them the enemy waves are a small handful of enemies that usually only one or two players get a hit on before the enemy dies. 
---
On a side note. I've always thought AWOL should be a public event for how much of a pain in the ass those gutsy's can be sometimes.
---
&gt;Company takes advantage of loophole even if it is unethical
---
Terrible example. 
---
If it is a loop hole then that would make it legal, at least until they make changes. 
---
Hacks particularly ones via 3rd party aren't in any online game.
---
Yep adding a little quality of life add on to a few existing items could have a big impact on trading.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing a mail system either
---
The company could have handed them the tools for all I know.. How hard it was to make doesn't interest me. It's the time spent recording, attacking 500+ users, following the game with loathing and dedication for an entire year, filling the sub with bullshit.. Those are what's telling.
---
 I have been finishing Scorchbeasts with a Plasma Flamer for a while now. It just melts em'. 
---
 This does not surprise me. Its a Bloodied Auto Barrel and with all the crap, should hit like a fleet of trucks. ;)
---
Okay, I guess I just won‚Äôt feel bad if I leave a teammate. Just trying to think of ideas to help the game play.
---
That one in the ash heep where the miner  machine comes up with a lot of empty safes on it.
---
Okay I will try but hopefully I can remember my Bethesda account that I used haha. This is the first fallout game I have played.
---
I do. Personally I think we should have a few that are easy and 1-2 that require some special effort, but for more Atoms. Just for the variety. 
---
But I‚Äôll gladly take the easy ones, of course.
---
&gt; So are you just here to reap attention on a potentially hot issue that doesn't affect you?
---
The only reason I'm still here is because I hope to see a sign that a company I once valued above every other company on this planet gains back their brain and starts doing stuff correctly. If this was some random indie company I wouldn't give a crap.
---
Yes I got a responder firemen helmet from that event.
---
How do I choose khajiit though?
---
It wasn't maintenance, they just disappear. I have tamed over 20 creatures. They always disappear within 48 hours. I have submitted bug reports, but no luck. On a few occasions, I have been in my camp looking at a tamed creature, server hopped, and they were gone on the next server and never returned. 
---
The tamed creatures have been bugged since day 1.
---
I wish the challenges with clothing would mark it if you are wearing something that counts, or are in an area that counts for challenges that are area specific.
---
It is just weird we have to look up so much online imo.
---
When there's more than one, yes.
---
The best AWOL I ever had was when each wave had a Legendary and they spawned in varied positions that made everyone circle around the RobCo building, instead of just being perched next to the truck.  "This is probably how this event is supposed to be," I thought.
---
So the same as gifting someone a set of Excevator Power Armor! Wow they don't learn!
---
You're trying to imply that I'm too young to make this observation? Swell. My advertising background and age shouldn't factor in to what you can observe with your own eyes. Think for yourselves. Don't be sheep.
---
Bethesda's buggy code is itself the offense. You seem to keep missing that point.
---
WHERE?! People are looking for this thing.
---
You're the one making the claim. So. Back it up. Show me proof that people are getting paid to abuse this sub and game?
---
This sub is a toxic shithole echochamber. And barely will listen to any criticism of the game. Even when valid. The game just experienced a major breach of security, with hackers able to take your entire inventory, and you're still right here. Pretending like the game isn't a bug infested mess. Don't be surprised when at least a little of the actual criticisms of the game make their way to this sub. You can't always keep the door to the echo chamber shut, you idiot.
---
The bloodied UGL works well on the SBQ but you need another weapon to quickly swap to if the mobs start to overwhelm you. Like a vampire weapon ( axe or handmade etc ). I run about half health for Scorched Earth so you have to keep an eye on it.
---
Agreed. 
---
Bethesda provides the game. PEOPLE are responsible for this miserable Bullshit hack. 
---
When someone shoots another person you don't go arrest Smith and Wesson.
---
You arrest the shooter.
---
Not how policing works.
---
Try again.
---
The fact that they plastered a brand onto a business model, and the only reason it's still standing regardless of the rampant error of this concept is fanboys want something so badly, they'll accept this shit show gladly.
---
I fucking love fallout, the shit put out since Interplay sold the IP is not fallout.
---
Ok right on. Now I'm accepting that a bug could cause high damage like in the video but I do see a lot of scorched earth events that end within a minute or two by a very small group of players. 
---
What are these players doing with their builds to kill her that fast? 
---
I've researched it online and set a character up once based on what I read but still felt like I wasn't really doing much more damage than I normally would.
---
What am I missing?
---
How is it any worse than using Police as an example?
---
The police don't create law, only govern it.
---
Government writes thousands of lines in order to create policy and sometimes those lines contain mistakes. Much more analogous to writing code.
---
Simple fact is. Bethesda is using a decade year old engine converted for online play. The majority of assets are stored locally so easily manipulated.
---
Obviously the hacker is to blame, but so is Bethesda. It's a 2 way street. They could have implemented decent anti-cheat from day one. But still haven't. Saying that cheats aren't included in the game is ridiculous, it's not a physical thing it's intellectual property, it's code.  If you disagree with me then fine. Good for you.
---
All of the ones that don‚Äôt level scale.
---
Bethesda didn't program the software used to make these exploits possible.....
---
Your lack of theory of mind explains the current state of advertising. Checks out. Do you project often or just in this comment thread?
---
 There are no good all round builds. You can build a pretty good hybrid as long as you know what you are doing.
---
 OK. Stack Strength and Perception for a nice Rifle and Knife build. The Rifle can become Commando in the same space. Its just 9 Perks you can swap between. This is one of my chars goal:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff44585&amp;d=pl2pp2pk2pd2l71lt2eh2c72ib4ar2ao0s52ss2si2sj2se2pe2eu0a03&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=RifleKnife
---
 PA only shines for Heavy Weapons and really many of us are tougher without it.
---
Yeah I love that event for the legendary chances but lately it seems like you can just sit in the trailer and stealth kill them all by yourself. If they catch you me off guard I'm still screwed though lol
---
Hum nice of you to assume my age and explain high school algebra concepts to me. Except he can usually only scam one or two items at a time. F(x) = 2\^x is not the proper function to model this, his ninth scam wouldn't be for 512 items. A more appropriate model would be g(x) = 2+ 2(x-1), where x = number of scams for both functions.  Would take him around 500 scams to acquire 1000 new items. If you assume each scam takes at least 10 minutes ( he has quite the elaborate pitch as he travels from camp to camp;probably underestimating time here), it would take him a large amount of time and effort to get back to where he was. Not to mention he would have to level characters ,the community is aware of his voice, and he would have a much harder time scamming now.
---
A legendary Alien Blaster that respawns ammo. I'm sure that wouldn't be broken or anyting
---
Indeed.  I'm used to that.  Although even then, you need a crazy build that's basically good at fighting the Queen and nothing else.
---
Stealth melee's numbers are weird too.  I don't actually hit her for \~5,000-6,000, despite what the damage numbers say, because the way the sneak multiplier gets calculated is apparently wrong.  It's probably a third of that.  You wouldn't think this information would be more objective than it is.  From the number of times you can see damage numbers in melee, and not have a hit connect, the values aren't being passed through the server for verification when they really should be.
---
You should learn more about the legal system.  To prove false marketing, you have to prove that they had an intent to deceive /before/ a campaign went out.  This is almost the same degree of proof required for pre-meditated murder.  It's just not likely you can prove that.
---
Then follow it up with your damages. You can sue for damages--which are not just some grandiose figure you get to pick, but rather you have to prove you were damaged and tie it to fiscal things.  So you were damaged ... $10?  $60?  It's just not a real case.
---
The only thing Bethesda is culpable for is incompetence, and unfortunately, that isn't really anything you can take somebody to court about unless it's a safety / negligence thing.
---
&gt; Obviously the hacker is to blame,
---
I had a few things to say, but just to narrow it all down to one... you do realize my initial response was based off somebody suggesting Bethesda is entirely to blame?
---
It's not pay to win, I'm not competing against u or anyone else, so what I get or what I do doesn't effect u or ur outcome.
---
Juicehead as well.
---
Are you going to do it again?
---
It's all just code mate. They wrote the holes in it.
---
Maybe they could implement decent anti-cheat too... Just a thought.
---
Lol, right not sure where the 4 came from, I will go with fat fingering it on my phone
---
It's supposed to spawn here: [https://map76.com/junk\_misc/unscorchedovenmitt](https://map76.com/junk_misc/unscorchedovenmitt).
---
Yep! Add me and find me and I‚Äôll drop you a set. Gt Astrosguy
---
 It will be a Primed gun and with all the Commando and damage building stacks you can do it can reach extremely high numbers. 
---
I don't use Bloodied myself as I am in the thick of it a lot and the Armour stack to do it right, is a big ass quest all in its own.
---
All events that trigger every time you just show up somewhere to do something else.  You all know the mayor, but anymore every time I go to see that cunt about buying some lego I get queen of the hunt.
---
That's a plausible amount of damage though and you will definitely move her bar at that rate.
---
I'm asking the hackers/youtubers to do just that. 
---
This sub is toxic because it's fabricated to be toxic. People aren't posting their real experiences or opinions. They are here to influence you. This is hard to accept maybe? That you are constantly being lied to, marketed to, deceived? There are real criticisms, yes. I 100% agree with you.. and this sub is useful to us as consumers to give feedback on those problems...but it can be used in many ways. Companies can abuse the fuck out of social media and there's nothing ..fucking nothing illegal about it.
---
Yeah, once I developed my alt into a stealth gunslinger, she had an extremely efficient way of dealing with that event, such that my main basically took up the same thing.  The event was a royal pain before then, since she was Bloodied melee.
---
I've lost 3 deathclaws, mirelurk king, 2 sloths, a radrat, a glowing radstag and a Yao Gui, it's hard times in the animal taming business :'(
---
Can be dropped and traded to those in adventure mode? How does this work ?
---
Check the link in the original post above
---
Yeah my bloodied toon gets wrecked at that event lol.
---
I watched a full minute of someone stealing the clothes off characters. Each stolen item makes his outfit better. Once he reaches a full outfit of high value gear, no more need for the growth. All he has to do is get someone with high value gear to trade with him. The exponential growth was to explain how he can get from "I got this Level 15 DSE pipe pistol and some meds to trade for" to being a walking billboard of gear. His terminal goal isn't the gear, it is the tears. Tears he will be getting from the first trade onward. Better gear just speeds of the velocity of the thefts and the end goal of tears.
---
Someone said i clearly worked for bethesda too the other day, it must be a new meme to just take out your sexual tentions on people now, lol
---
But so is Bethesda. You forgot to quote that part.
---
I was responding to your comparison. Yes I know.
---
If Bethesda is letting this continue for (possibly) months then more of the blame is inherently shifted to them for not having a response to their product being used to hurt other users.  
---
And quite frankly after following this game and purchasing it on day one. Bethesda need a huge kick up the fucking ass.
---
For me, it's my "GET EVERYONE AWAY FROM ME" Quad Automatic Tesla Rifle.
---
I might as well name it Panic Button. üòÇ
---
Haven't actually checked the burrowed holes, haven't noticed in there. But, in the main area, center where the workbenches are at and where you need the key to get into- if you go behind there and follow the tracks down to where it dead ends, there are aluminum veins all down through there, in both ends of that chamber. Wear your excavator armor, and you'll come out of there with plenty of aluminum.
---
Enjoying all the "Bethesda could have easily prevented this by......" Posts. 
---
Welcome to online gaming fallout fans. I realize you're used to singleplayer experiences. 
---
But here's a little insider tips.... Every game has hackers. Aim bots. Cheaters. If you think otherwise you're a naive, uninformed chud. 
---
Even at the higher end of competitive shooters.... People have been caught cheating/using exploits. 
---
Every online game struggles with this shit.
---
PS. Modders ain't gonna do fuck all. They'll be waging the same ongoing arms race with hackers.
---
The SBQ will blunt 70% of the damage outright, so whatever you see on the weapon in your Pip-Boy?  Take 30% of that for a crude metric of what you can expect, without buffs.
---
[vegetarian ham] Keep it. My karmically correct wasteland experience does not call for me to roast plants by gatling laser, ultracite or otherwise. Good day, sir.
---
I‚Äôm lv 90 I die like 5 times. Really epic
---
I don't why youre getting down voted while preaching the good word of the people
---
New River Gorge Resort. I've been through this place. I've seen that link when it was still working. I don't know anyone that's found it.
---
If you really wanna play bad you could always make a second PSN account and Bethesda account to start again with.
---
I took the other path.  I built in 95% of that place.  I spent 40+ hours making it to where I thought I wanted. . .  .Then spent another 40 hrs rebuilding it. I'm still not satisfied with it yet.  I need to go back with some mods (the entire settlement was built before I started modding) and finish it.
---
\^ This is the right answer.
---
By ever upwards do you mean wild Appalachia? That‚Äôs not true. Anyway it was delayed. That isn‚Äôt the same as changing their minds
---
Do you have a link for that?  I have been wondering what happened to the ‚Äúlegendary perk‚Äù option. I figured it just got buried...
---
I just wish they were more interesting tbh. Most of them have no logic or sense of continuity, don‚Äôt get me wrong I like Project Paradise a lot but what experiment are we even conducting? Why are we defending the friendly animal? What is the result pf the experiment? I know it‚Äôs a ‚Äòdon‚Äôt think about, just shoot gun‚Äô ordeal but it would be nice for there to be some narrative there as well, Preston Garvey‚Äôs radiant quests had more to them than events lol
---
Delayes lead to project getting dropped sometimes completly forgotten lets not for get this is the same studio that laid off 30 people then brought in new people that never worked on this project to handle updates
---
Breach and clear? Why, it‚Äôs easy and I always get a ton of ore from it
---
squarely: directly, without deviating to one side.
---
I would be proud to be a Bethesda employee. People can hate that statement if they want, which I'm sure some will but I don't see them for the devils so many are trying to convince the world they are. 
---
Now I'm going to sit back and watch the hate flow my way :)
---
Each shot I do says seven in numbers, 14 if I aim at the head lol try a zealots or primed and unload on it lol
---
That would work but then I would have to pay for ps plus on another account. So I doubt I will do that.
---
I think it is buried ive tried navigating the bethsda page but it is so buggy and useless I can find anything of refrence for wild appalachia
---
No you don't. As long as your main account is set to primary on your console and it has ps+ you'll be able to play and any other accounts on that console would too.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs it, maybe it glitched out on me when I did it, there was nothing in the safes. They were just empty
---
Ok? They still haven‚Äôt changed their mind about any of the things you mentioned.
---
I‚Äôd trade two cows and one donkey for one of those plans! Why can‚Äôt I ever get that lucky comrade
---
There's a spot due south and slightly west of Vault 76 that has a rock "cave" with a hole in the ceiling.  Not too far from where Grahm's Meat Week was.
---
That's sorta just NW of Grahm's meat spot, just along the cliffs.
---
 edit: English
---
Sure thing dood.
---
What's that do?
---
This is the spot I believe he's looking for. I had a camp there for a while.
---
Oh, I did not realize that. I will give that a try, thank you!
---
Thank you very much! I am on the hunt. Gotta get this new CAMP started.
---
I started as a primary shotgun build but eventually got bummed at how poor the damage output was even with a full suite of shotgun perks. 
---
I always used some rifles before but I now I use my instigating/+50% vats crit lever action constantly. I don‚Äôt even have the rifleman cards maxed and I one-shot almost all mobs from stealth. 
---
It really shines in vats with the right perks! Off the top of my head, Gun-Fu, Action Boy, Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint, Adrenaline, Covert Operative, Four-Leaf Clover and Better Criticals all work great for me.
---
Must have because I walk away with all kinds of lead, iron, silver, gold ore
---
Thanks for thee info. I was in the wrong place entirely. Is it not a "cave"?
---
Scribe Grant: MASSIVE final wave incoming!
---
-Spawns a single SB with a chaperone of 2 scorched
---
Do you have evidence to the contray cause from where I see on a constant basis is look to the future for shinny thing and will bait and switch with similar but not he same things. Saying they havent is just denial of what has happened.
---
What does it cost? Gotta see if I have enough lol (level 50)
---
You said "stopped reading after that" and used the comparison to Police as an excuse as to disregard the argument completely.
---
I tried to make you see somewhere in the middle. Get it yet?
---
You are making zero sense. You are saying Bethesda funds bad press about itself? You are saying people are getting paid?
---
Look. I will say this as simply as I can so you can try and understand it.
---
FO76 is a buggy mess. It was released before it was ready. And has constant problems and exploits. This makes it easy for people to hate it, because there is so much to hate.
---
No one is getting paid.
---
Stop being paranoid.
---
Stop being a fanboy.
---
Grow up.
---
You can ONLY scrap them if you don't want them..and you get nothing. Dropping is the only way to be rid of them right now and it destroys it. I know. It blows. Can't sell em or trade em at all.
---
No they didn't, stop spreading lies.
---
No problem!
---
Tbh the time it takes to jump five times must‚Äôve been long enough for either one of you to get a kill, especially true w an m79 but any other green tier or higher weapon is capable of the same
---
Awww that bites.  Ty for reply tho this is only my 2nd so I wasn't sure.  My first was a cow and never made it home
---
Someone has to arrest or kill the pet thief lol
---
Perhaps. I'd love to. I'll try to join.
---
C'mon in!
---
There‚Äôs also a cave in the far northeast of the map. I can‚Äôt recall the exact location, but it‚Äôs northeast of the ammo factory, right at the map boundary.
---
Obviously this is not in the forest. That one is not far from Graham‚Äôs meat cook as mentioned by others.
---
sold my plans for 5k, still got over 200 hundred gifts to open so hoping to find more
---
I like that one, really good for santa scorched right now. The place is full of scorched and as you do the event they just keep coming.
---
Shame it's a huge waste of time the rest of the year, I like that place.
---
Just checked. It's on a counter in the concession stand near the pool.
---
I would say if you‚Äôve already launched a nuke you‚Äôre probably trying to do things too high level for you which will be why you‚Äôre struggling. Things get a lot easier when you get to lvl 50, you get higher level cards max lvl weapons and armor and you can specialise your build more! Just take it slow and fight enemies that aren‚Äôt impossible for you to kill!
---
If you don't want to die as much, there are a couple of options.  
---
The first is to get a Vampires heavy gun as it would heal you as long as you have things to shoot. 
---
The second is to try looking into a junkies build.   That's what I'm working towards. 
---
Alternatively, I currently run a full health build but with a 50 cal machine gun.   I have a Zealots with faster reload.  It does more damage against the spawns and when you couple it with the Adenaline perk card you can boost your damage per shot quite a bit.
---
&gt;Except the Police don't program software for criminals to use...
---
Tor was created by two Navy employees and was further developed by DARPA
---
Yet criminals use it.
---
I could probably list other "gov't funded things" that have been used by criminals easily anyway.
---
I think the one you are talking about is up the hill from point pleasant - if you‚Äôre on Xbox I can take you
---
I actually don‚Äôt mind that one, I like how the Hornwright quest ties into it and becomes more profitable, plus it‚Äôs good for ore.
---
I understand that happens quite often but in relation to this argument I am talking end-user software that was sold to a consumer.
---
In other words, it wasn't made for criminals to use or sold to them.
---
And that's why I tried to steer the conversation away from using the police as an example. It doesn't really work. Government probably doesn't either but I believe it's a more relatable comparison than the cops.
---
So many people still trading it on PS4!
---
&gt;enemy waves are a small handful of enemies that usually only one or two players get a hit on before the enemy dies
---
This is what makes most of them kinda boring in my opinion. Being overwelmed in Primal Cuts or Campfire Tales is way more fun than just waiting between enemy spawns in Tea Time. Public events are meant for at least a couple of players, 4 mole rats and bugs ain't gonna cut it.
---
A huge amount of enemies like the ghouls in the golf club comming for you are way more fun to kill than a small bunch of bugs, specially with other vault dwellers helping you out.
---
I would reccomend bringing that endurance down some
---
When you get to higher levels, you'll drop off in dmg unless you correctly focus your perk points and cards towards a certain play style. Then once you know the play style you want, you can go looking on a Reddit marketplace, or vendors for a relatively good weapon to fit your build. Armor is also kind of important, but that can come much later, the main focus/quickest change should be with dmg output.
---
First off and most importantly. What type of playstyle do you want to use? Melee or range? 1 hand or 2 hand? Sniper, Commando or Heavy guns? (I don't include pistol or shotgun because they either fall behind with DPS endgame, or your perks aren't suited for it)
---
Do you want run a bloodied build? Huge dmg output, but always on the edge of death (this will require getting specialised armor sets) maybe a junkies build?
---
Right..... but you are gonna tell me every single online game has the problems of Fo76?
---
After the Pioneer Scouts questline, I also can't un-hear Scribe Grant as the overly excited voice at the Athletics course.
---
Why is this an exploit?
---
It's not Hopewell Cave-size, no.  But it is a little underground spot, and a fairly popular CAMP location.
---
I'll probably be on in about an hour if you want play. Just a heads up I don't have a headset, don't know if that matters to you or not.
---
Why not covert the handmade to non-automatic? The fire rate is still high and you get the damage perks
---
All I can do is go off of the various communications and status updates which all indicate Q1 for legendary players and wastelanders. I don‚Äôt know what you are implying. Are you saying they decided not to release them? Because I would like evidence for that claim.
---
Just launched it!
---
I didn‚Äôt launch my first nuke until I was level 180. There is a TON to do in the game. Take your time and go through all the quests and side quests and build up your character.
---
For sure man, at first I liked Sanjay but now he‚Äôs the next Preston for me, I got all his lines down to a fuckin T lol
---
Also I didn't realize I learned the plan for prime for the GG, so I put that on and crafted some ultracite ammo.  I'll have to remember to farm more violet flux next nuke zone, on top of more lead and ultracite but that's easy.  Luckily also I have 10 points in INT so I put a maxed out Gunsmith with maxed out Demo Expert.  260 DMG pre chem for antiarmor + explosive.  I'm debating if I want to go for a junkies build or a bloodied.  I guess bloodied since I have a gatling laser, and I will need to farm for adrenal gland mutation.
---
Had to google what ballistic bock is, guess I have a reason to go back to BIV.
---
I have one big guns bobblehead, but it's for my collection.  It's been tough going from camp to camp finding one let alone out in the wild.
---
Damnit. I always have to work when the fun is happening
---
What I'm saying if we take into account previous serious with pushing back content and then it just getting droped you'll see a trend content is lost and dropped in several fallout games without ever being implemented. Even if it wasn't explicitly shown to players it happens. Probably might see release differnet from which they described it or may get left on the cutting room floor who knows.
---
You can put an extended mag on the rifle for more capacity. If you want faster fire rate it's either handmade or combat rifle. The lever is great but again there's limited ammo capacity unless you find a good legendary variant.
