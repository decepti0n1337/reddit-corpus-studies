Nope as I have said many times people will just always add 10 percent to what they sell now to get the price they originally wanted
---
---
---
Oh shit!
---
U can only get it during the encrypted event. You have to complete the event.
---

---
Edit: multiple times unless ur lucky
---
I agree.  MATN has given the game a fair shake.  He has criticisms, as we all do, and while I don't really agree with his "And how to fix it" proposal, there's no doubt that he speaks from an informed viewpoint, rather than just spouting off for hits like countless others.
---
pc, happened to me 3/4 times. It auto-solved everytime. Irrelevant visual bug,
---
Damn, now I'm definitely going to have to do this, I'm weighed down quite a bit by legendary gear waiting for that new vendor.
---
Yup. Regularly shop Whitesprings for cheap legendaries. Found some very decent 2/3 legendaries and a ton of * stuff good for my new character.
---
I hate the new extra steps
---
Well sorry if I believe that the bean counters at Bethesda knew what they were doing. It just seems to me like it's more likely that an unexpected variable such as duping caused inflation in the economy than it is that a team of bean counters didn't do their job correctly. 
---
If you disagree that's fine but you and that other prick basically attacked me for daring to suggest that dupers possibly contributed to the inflation of the economy. It's not like my theory is that far fetched.
---
&gt;SOURCE
---
Hahahahahaha, except that's LITERALLY not what he fucking said. Christ I can't tell if people have just gone completely stupid, or if we as a society have just accepted lying as a thing that's ok. I hope you're disappointed. With everything that ever happens to you.
---
The materials from the sheepsquatch are for crafting the Sheepsquatch Staff, Club and Shard. You need to do the free range event to get those plans.
---
For this reason I haven’t built a camp in a month. I use the camp as a free transit spot and do all chores in whitesprings. Hopefully the griefing a-holes will get bored and quit the game once camps are unbreakable.
---
Same for me. I did free range where 2 of them showed up at the end  and no atoms.
---
I agree with this, but it also doesn't really set a "punishment" for people that duped and were only suspended, which might set a precedent that it could be worth to explot something a little and get to keep an arbitrary amount. Kind of like don't rob the biggest bank and have to give it all back, but rob a small one and get to keep some.
---
Just to let you know (am mod on two other subs) the auto mod does get things wrong.  We don’t usually set them with single words, but certain combos can trigger the heuristic filter.  Always PM us to take a look (which you’ve done, yay). The folks here do a great job and are very communicative.
---
I thought slap damage was taken out of the game?
---
You’re act as though caps are important or hard to get...
---
There isn’t really a cap sink anywhere in this game, find myself capped on my toons frequently
---
10% isn’t a big deal
---
Mountain out of a molerat hill
---
Got the nukashine for the x01 and swapped out the gold helmet for a darker one. Looks much better.
---
the weapon reduced weight perk only really applies to the weapon itself, mod weight is added after the -90% is factored in.
---
Yeah, it would really suck if the armor you "earned" by buying it from dupers lost some cap value.
---
Still works now, massive help
---
That's not a bad idea to be fair. 🤔 Might be time to go mobile and modular.
---
NO. I use them when I am out of resources. Taking it out of the game would screw me, and waste programmer’s time.
---
It was.
---
I have never messed with workshops just for that reason. I get harassed enough just being in adventure on pacifist.  :(
---
I just now realized what "powered" armor does. I don't really feel I need AP so much on my melee build. But yeah I'm a hoarder. With maxxed out traveling pharmacy, batteries included, thru-hiker, martial artist, I still have like 375 carry weight and 800 in my stash. A lot of it is saving up for the legendary vendor which isn't for another month but I feel given how nerfed legendary drops are now I really need to hold on to the three stars I have regardless of how useless they are. I also am waiting for plans to drop from the sheepsquatch so I'm hoarding those components too and they're heavy.
---
Me too!  And I thought CAMPs could no longer be destroyed.  But I've been proved wrong.
---
Thank you. Got it lol.
---
I didnt realize this was a thing, raise awareness fellow dweller!!!!!
---
You don’t know me.
---
I’ve been playing for 1.5 months.
---
My armor was earned the legit way.
---
Doesn’t take much research to learn that duping emphasis was placed on guns not armor.
---
That’s why TSE guns go for south of 10K, while one piece of Assassins Sentinel armor goes for north of 30K.
---
It’s less common because it wasn’t duped as much.
---
Furthermore, if I were a duper I’d be banned.
---
Stop being lazy, farm your way to decent gear instead of accusing everyone who has it of being a duper.
---
Yeah, the moderators are pretty cool here. They already helped me out. I will make sure to message them next time instead of jumping the gun.
---
And all you have to do is hit the SBQ a couple of times and when she finally dies you can loot her body. As long as you land a few bullets in here a loot drop will be instanced to your character.
---
I wish I could reassign the power armor exit key to something out of the way. Getting a bit old jumping out of your armor by accident right in the middle of a fire fight.
---
The typical 1 star item and he drops like a sheepsquatch horn,skull. Like how scorchbeasts drop body parts.
---
[deleted]
---
unless you have a weapon that's 100% and you want to force it to 150% but you can't workbench repair it unless it's 99% or below.
---
or, you don't have the materials for a repair.
---
I love this idea too
---
I wasnt attacking you dude. I was giving you my thoughts on why I didnt believe duping was the major cause. Like I said, it didnt help matters any on some aspects, but it was heading in that direction regardless. Also as I previously said, make 3* enemies drop 3* items, 2* enemies drop 2 and 3* items, and 1* guys have a chance at any with 1* being the higher probability. That would introduce more good items and lower the cost of those good items. The caps were always going to get out of control. Once you have most of what you want you just start not spending.
---
Glad to hear it’s sorted, and we kinda depend on y’all to tell us when things go south.  :)
---
Just wondering is there anyone who would want to sell a tse gauss rifle or a tse dragon? If so just give me a price.
---
I just want to trade in crap items for better ones. Like for example a berserkers pipe wrench. I do melee but not with two handed weapons.
---
You can't expect a scorchbeast to be easy to kill after only 8 hours in.  As far as gun fights lasting too long, it's probably more an issue of poor quality early game gear. Gun fights at my level are overly brief if anything. 
---
As far as the "why I am surviving, for the sake of it etc", every single video game in the history of video games have all been without exception a waste of time. You could have a game with millions of choices and billions of outcomes, which would still be a waste of time. 
---
What is the "right feel" for a survival shooter?
---
Personally, I would vote for leaving Legendaries as is, but severely nerf weapon and armor repair so that resources to repair with are actually more valuable and sought after - it shouldn't be trivially easy to get enough steel and such to repair easily - would need to remove repairkits from the Atom Shop for this though...in game drops would make them much sought after items if this happened.  Also, implement some sort of system where eventually things break entirely. One way would be to just have anything that breaks be gone permanently.  Or perhaps a  limited number of times that it could be repaired.
---
The advantage here is that nothing would last forever.  It would be really hard to acquire a full set of legendary gear and it would make lower tier legendaries more valuable...you'd be less likely to get rid of that 1* left arm if you knew your 3* version would break eventually.  It would also limit building around one set of gear a bit more as you wouldn't always be sure that you'd have a full set.
---
I'm in with this idea.  As is, I never play Survival Mode now because it's just not what survival mode should be. I would roll up a new character for this kind of game mode in a heartbeat though if it happened.
---
Oh, and more random mob spawn points. It's very possible to travel quite a ways and not bump into anything threatening as it is now.
---
I see a few robot models and would love to have a display case for those.
---
Level 90 something. I've joined in on other people's a couple times, but still haven't done my own yet.
---
On Xbox it isn't a problem for me, have to hold down A for about 1 full second. Rarely do it by accident
---
It's no doubt the same people getting their shit spread in PvP. They think everyone who put any effort in is "running around in ebay armor, with a tse weapon that one shots." 
---
Basically if you put any though into PvP optimization, or have farmed for or even, god forbid, bought items from a "duper" on reddit. You are the bad guy griefing these skilless babies. They don't do their research, they don't put in the time, and they want to be able to compete with anyone.
---
Just like life, there's always someone better than you, someone losing sleep for farming. People calling in sick to play all day. Kids that don't have responsibilities yet. You can't hold any of that against anybody. 
---
What you do with your time is your choice. They are saying that we should not be rewarded for putting in exponentially more time, and effort than them? Ffs it's laughable at best.
---
or check the market subs. I got lucky and found the headpiece at a vendor bought the outfit from someone else since encrypted is a dead/no win event now.
---
How come everyone complains about this but I've never had any issue with pvp? and I literally always play worried it'll happen cuz people always complain that someone random one shot them, but I never once got attacked and killed by another player besides when my bullets accidentally hit them and put us in pvp. I've had my camp destroyed one time and I've been playing since launch pretty much. Also not saying this doesn't happen but it never has to me so why? I'm shit at this game too anyone could kill me
---
Uhhh...I get shot at all the time, but BC I'm on pacifist they don't hurt me.  So something is wrong on your end.
---
Nothing worth looting usually
---
I’ll help you get up a few lvls then run one with you, psn is ak56thethird
---
The supposed camps thing won’t be added till next week. Never was added. Idk what’s up about the slap damage issue you’ve got though.
---
I see
---
Well name another machine that's got three reels that spin and you win based off of them lining up? If you're not even in a look at the photo at the areas that were circled, why comment?
---
Lol me and 2 guys do it all the time
---
screw you means you don't know how to use kits in pip-boy? Not much time to waste, because they obviosly have backups
---
direct slap damage was removed, camp PVP damage when not in PVP is to be added at a later date.
---
So use it.
---
“Is the game worth giving another shot in your opinion.” Considering that the only people that browse this subreddit are players that pour hours and hours into this game, I think you all ready know what the general consensus on this sub is going to be.
---
I genuinely forgot about repair kits until now
---
[removed]
---
Lol, as representative of the “They took er jerbs”! Scorched Political Action Group we look forward to working with you in the future.
---
Indeed, although I'm not sure how certain effects like bloodied (Things like AA, TS and E effects can easily be explained since they basically exist irl as well) could work even with that explanation.
---
Thank you guys for all the feedback
---
Your walking cane, Mr. President. It once belonged to Andrew Jackson.
---
https://i.imgur.com/sIA9VRM.jpg
---
Thanks! And I totally get that now. I'll make sure to do so next time 😅
---
No it’s not worth it
---
Just hang around for 5 minutes, take note of where he dies and roughly 5 minutes later a metal pile will spawn that you can loot. Chances are you’ll be the only one left there because others gave up too early.
---
&gt; There will be NO UPGRADING of your existing legendaries' star ratings; and
---
&gt; There will be NO ADDING STARS to your existing gear.
---
I fully expected this, ever since duping was first discovered. They need a way to depreciate the value of all the two-shot/bloodied/furious/AA/etc.+explosive weapons that were duped an ungodly amount of times, otherwise everyone would still be using the same duped weapons for all of FO76's lifetime.
---
There is a glitch where you put a small cooking station with the handle of the spoon facing the rock (it has to be laid very close to the rocks).  Then you go into crafting and when you exit crafting you take a step back and you’re inside the mountain. I could see my camp and everything outside, but no one could see me inside...just my gamer tag.  You can’t do it just anywhere, a friend and I tried. We did find a spot for him so he has his camp completely underground. It was fun for a while, and I still have my camp in the same place so could rebuild it anytime I want 😁
---
They mentioned that explosive shotguns have been displaying incorrect lower damage numbers than what they were actually dealing.
---
You must be the only 3 guys capable of doing it. Past 2 weeks I've seen nothing but fails, nobody will activate the pylons or revive anyone who is.
---
Lol newbs
---
check your inventory, you probably have some
---
Its actually very easy if 3 ppl do what has to be done
---
How so?
---
I’m sure you have some, I just randomly found some in my inventory and I did it even notice receiving them.
---
His body doesn't disappear, it turns invisible. You can typically find it still if you continue to search in area where it died. Can also wait 5+ minutes until it turns into a meat/metal pile. Another option others have suggested is using the new camera to scan the area. It will highlight the name when it's in frame, making it easier to find.
---
At least they liked you man
---
Way to jump straight the scorchbeast man. There aren't many builds that can one shot a scorchbeast with a 3 star...
---
Our battle will be legendary!
---
No
---
Duping was a contributing factor in what I would consider mass inflation in the games economy. The 10% tax is now a sink to try and drain the money that was printed out of the economy.
---
If anyone is mad about that......be mad at the dupers. If anyone has duped weapons in their inventory (knowingly or not) blame yourself. Pay the tax and accept it for what it is.
---
That's my opinion and I'm leaving it at that. Fire away with the down votes I don't give a shit about my E-rep.
---
The only way to find out is to fire it up and see. What annoyed you before may have been fixed, or not been addressed at all. What you perceive as lack of content might be part of someone's daily grind for caps or better equipment. The trading scene is pretty full on, so there might be an opportunity to score top level gear quickly. Try PVP if that rattles your cage. No one else can decide if the game is going to be fun for YOU.
---
... how else would you repair on the fly with the new kits?
---
Everyone has different plans for their character, so depending on what you want to achieve by playing Fallout will answer that question for you. I usually tell people that the only way they know if they'll like it or not is to play it themselves. I personally enjoy it for the most part.
---
It should be, but I'm amazed every single time I go to this event. There was 1 time I activated all 3 pylons and was the only one shooting. There were 8 other people there, than I died and someone took the little bit of junk I had. This event has made me lose all faith in this community lol.
---
Leaving a comment so I can find this later, thank you for the info :)
---
I mean, you said "good roll," not "god roll."  The entire point of a god roll is something that might only happen a few times to any given character and fundamentally changes that character.  But you don't need top-of-the-line gear to conquer PvE.  Not in the slightest.
---
I noticed that too. And thank you for adding “yoked” to my vocabulary lol
---
Damn what a bar!!! Definitely outdid me!
---
Exactly!
---
Every single second I’m not at work or with my girl I’m playing, and every single second I can’t play I’m searching for deals on reddit, FB, discord, and LFG.
---
These clowns could go through my comment history and see the trades for every single thing I have, but they’re too lazy to.
---
They’d rather call me a duper, and that’s exactly why they can’t succeed in game.
---
Thanks, I been looking for a straight answer on this subject for three hours.
---
Yeah its quite annoying. Find a couple people that actually care ! Lol do events with them.
---
If u want the mascot set ill give u one, whats ur psn?
---
Androids shitty keyboard auto correct said good roll......I actually said god roll.
---
Sorry for the confusion.
---
.....so become murder hobos?
---
Further incentivising server hopping, which only adds to the game's instability. Good call, Beth.
---
select weapon, press inspect (x on pc) then repair kit (T)
---
Right.
---
The bones don't even give ultracite like scorchbeast wing does so yeah nothing special
---
If I pick up a cap, put it in a machine and maybe a good legendary drops, that's gambling.
---
If I pick up a bullet, shoot it into a legendary mob, and maybe I get a good legendary, that's gaming.
---
One of these 2 statements is silly.  Take your pick.
---
Because apparently they want people running fully specialized builds with super rare weapons and armor to do less damage than some level 50 greenhorn with an All Rise.
---
Well, I see a *lot* of Gatling Lasers at any SBQ battle these days, so maybe there's something to it.
---
On the other hand, it may be like the Mr. Handy Buzz Blades where the gray damage you see removed from her health bar actually reflects the *total* damage she has taken since you started sawing, not how much *you* are actually doing.
---
Well I got bitch slapped once and died so...
---
More like a wastelander scav than raider, like a water thief it something from New Vegas haha.
---
I said **everything**. Not lots of stuff, not a large amount of shit. Everything except these two mobs is literally everything but those two mobs. My rifle build can, and until shotguns get fixed they might be able to. Heavy weapon builds can if they have the right mods on the right weapons.
---
The point is, 3 stars or 1 star, it's really not that different. The first star is where the majority of the importance is, the other two stars are just potential nice shit, like for a vats build or explosive for 20% more damage. It's different for armor because cav/sent are really strong and they only come on 3 star pieces.
---
Because the world is influenced by upvotes on reddit now. Thanks for speaking for everyone.
---
The meme fits even more
---
If only your character name was actually displayed in game
---
That's not what pacifist does. It takes away your ability to damage other players. Makes it so you don't damage a player accidentally and become wanted. It says it on the bottom of the screen in settings where you turn it on
---
Not sure you know what prospective means, considering you wrote the literal opposite of it. Review is off to a great start. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, you're 8 hours in and complaining about tough enemies? I see no potential in this prospect whatsoever. Blah blah blah. All I see lately from "reviews" are people complaining about having to do literally anything. Did you read that 3,000 page RDR2 review where the asshole just complained for like 8 hours about having to press buttons to play the game. That's you. Maybe go watch a movie and get the fuck outta here?
---
n/p, and I know exactly what you mean.
---
The question is, does it need fixing?
---
My BE shotgun might do twice as much damage as my BE lever (apparently) but from 1/3rd of the distance and is 1/2 as effective against 'armor' lacking any 'AA' perks and considering the way the damage equation calculates 'armor penetration' (DR).
---
Even if taking the argument into consideration your answer is still 'yes, it does because x, y and z' (x most likely being 'PvP' *sigh* and y 'because in line with the rest' disregarding the fact that single strong projectile =/= multiple weaker projectiles) does it need fixing right now, over let's say 'stealth' or 'fusion core drain using VATS/Power Attack' or any of the other reported/documented and frustrating bugs?
---
Because to the untrained eye the priorities seem very lopsided.
---
What is fun - I guess I am a loser because I keep having the most fun with stuff that is 'over performing'? - gets patched out, what is frustrating - I have a sweet VATS PA build that works great but needs the sponsorship of Poseidon Energy to perform and maintaining stealth consistently involves server hopping every couple of hours give or take and ignoring situations where 'mob faction a is fighting mob faction b', and that is just to mention two, I could keep going - gets... not even acknowledged?
---
What gives?
---
I just got the head doing the quest, u gonna give it to me for free?
---
I mean, that goes to show how often I've tried to use this evil pay-to-win game-breaking item on-the-fly, right? 😂
---
Either way, putting both of the repair options under Inspect is just clunky and weird.  What they should have done is keep Repair as it was, and have it display a menu asking if you want a Workshop Repair/Repair Kit/Improved Repair Kit.
---
How are you selecting the weapon if not in the Pipboy?
---
Tried it for 15 minutes just now, no sheepsqatch.
---
I've done it before successfully with the camera, so yes it can work.  It's also possible the corpse just disappears.
---
Personally, I'm done with them.  I haven't found the last 4-5 I killed, and I spend a *lot* of time looking if I can't find it.
---
Yup
---
Lol. I never accused you of duping (although buying duped items is pretty much just as bad). But bitching about Bethesda giving us a better way to optomize our builds, just because you spent a lot of caps buying yours from other players is ridiculous.
---
SoIdier is my psn, am on now
---
Nice; next time let me perch on the roof and watch this phenomenon. I'll be quite like Boo.
---
Sometimes you can recover it by waiting 10 mins and a meat pile will appear or fast travelling back, I have managed a few times to claim my loot this way, but not all times. You get plans and outfits, all worth while.
---
I'll try to be there!
---
Console stores them locally. People have confirmed they don't persist across different physical consoles.
---
If you keep playing the game for one more hour to see if you can find one more 3* enemy and buy $20 worth of Atoms while you are playing........that is gambling.
---
No different than a casino designing the floor to make it hard to find the exit and flashing lights and bells to attract you back in.
---
Only difference is that casinos nare over seen by a gaming commission and so far video game companies are unregulated.
---
And you called me obtuse..... LOL
---
Again, no. They are correcting an issue where they were never actually nerfed when they were intended to be. The explosive damage was supposedly still +100% (pre-nerf) when it should have been 20% like all other explosive weapons.
---
I think if you inject anyone with nukashine instead of giving them drink they'll die instantly
---
No, keep playing. -Bethesda
---
Harpers Ferry, lately they been nuking that spot for the burros "dungeon ", a little to the west of it, in the swamp area. You can get maybe 30-50 raw crimson flux easy.
---
Agreed
---
Not free range...and I was attempting to help bloodied melee stand in its face for three to four minutes. Nonetheless, everyone has his or her strategy.
---
That might actually happen, I have a dog helmet. I've been holding on to it for a while. I'm guessing they wouldn't have that in there unless they were either too lazy and just imported every asset from fallout 4, or they were adding dogs at some point.
---
That's a mod for the chest. You modify a current one you have made with the buttressed mod.
---
Well I don't get damaged by other players and I don't hurt others.
---
Ok - ty 👍🏻
---
They've improved it in the sense that it doesn't crash on me 3 times a hour, now its maybe twice a week. The pop in has gotten worse in some areas, the new content is disappointing and mostly dead already. Mainly because Item drops are still terrible and broken so its gotten to the point of asking yourself what is the point? Its worth giving another shot if you have it, it is better but there's still plenty of bugs and annoyances. I think if you don't have really high expectations and don't let any past bad experience sway you, you can have some fun with the game.
---
I want to say somewhere between harpers ferry and the substation west of it. It's in between that area.
---
What? I can’t mod my legendary piece?
---
You probably unlocked buttressed for trapper arms or legs. It doesn't actually matter what body part you scrap, so if you're crafting to scrap then it's cheapest to make arms.
---
I’ve got nothing a few times.....
---
Have they said anything about potentially bringing back the Festival from a few months back at a later date?
---
Expect it to increase this week as they know it will be their last chance, keep an eye on your camp and if anyone goes near it change characters or log off until the patch comes out. Mines has been trashed 2-3 times but none recently .. I have some bunkers which they can't touch :) Completely enclosed in foundations, but should not be needed going forward.
---
Optimizing your build is not the same as having the very best weapons and armor in the game.
---
Also, do you have a magic wand that tells you which items are duped?
---
Could you lend it to me?
---
Actually I think you should lend it to Bethesda first because they couldn’t even tell.
---
If they can’t tell, how am I supposed to tell!?
---
You can make a decent amount more now.
---
Thanks a lot for your answers
---
I haven't replayed it, but the main reason why I don't is simple: Plans.  I don't envy trying to reacquire all the Plans that my main character already knows.  If the game had a formal transfer box like Borderlands 2 had, maybe I'd feel differently.  Or if the Plan knowledge was shared between characters.  It would be exciting to try things with a second character that weren't available to me on the first.  Like, what if I had a Handmade Rifle at Lv. 15?
---
So, I'm content to pick different perk cards for my main to have her do different things instead.
---
Usually it’s a piece of wood armor or a drill, occasionally a one star melee stuff, same as any random item from a one star ghoul.
---
Don't know if she always did that, but for last couple months i been doing the sbq, I've seen the flux drop as loot.
---
You can't inspect weapon without pipboy or workbench
---
No you can. Sometimes when you scrap and learn mods from scrapping it will learn a mod for a difference piece of that armor type. I was scrapping leather right legs and learned studded but I can only make it on every other limb and not the right leg. So maybe you learned it for the limbs.
---
Normally the Scorched Earth event rewards give you four random stable flux. The queen itself shouldn't drop them. Sometimes players die shortly after the queen and you loot their bag, accidentally or otherwise.
---
I play for two hours. I get 3 legendaries I do not like. I break those down for scrips, then check if I get 1 legendary from that(Without any confirmation that is even how it will be done). Maybe i do, maybe I don't. If I do, whoope. If I don't, I got play to find more legendaries and come back later.
---
Big fucking deal
---
&gt; our business will be "taxed" 10%. I want to make the argument that this is a very good thing.
---
I care a shit about to have to pay taxes or not. 
---
All I want is a good platform to unload the stuff in my stash for caps, while helping someone in the process.
---
I am really excited to find how this new feature works in practice...
---
Oh jeez 
---
Ok now I got it
---
Thx a lot. I was scrapping chest and got for arm 
---
I thought it’s mistake
---
So I should scrap the most cheap pArt? And can get all mods for all armor?
---
100% you have electricity mutation on or that other one
---
But if the option isn't presented in all possible screens, how else would they remind us of this thing that we totally requested be put in the game for us?
---
3 was the first time you saw them 3d, though, and they did a fantastic job of making them horrifying.  Not to mention they were still troubling even towards high levels, AND in power armor.
---
"Claws that can rip through power armor" used to be in their description.
---
I've only gotten the free, in game ones. They're fucking great in the middle of a fire fight. Why would anyone refuse to use them?  And how do they break the game? 
---
If I'm in the middle of a SBQ fight, having to leave the fight and go fix my weapons/armor is annoying as fuck lol
---
To each their own I guess.
---
The second time through was more of a grind to 50 without caring about quests or rewards from quests. Basically just did as many quests as I could to level up as fast as I could. The process feels longer because it has already been done. The end result is cool cuz you can have a different build.
---
To be fair, any 3* Gamma Guns really aren't worth much. No primary legendary effects really compliment it since none of them modify the radiation damage which is the whole point of the Gamma Gun. It also has severe restrictions on its second and third legendary effects. They can only be +50% limb damage and 90% reduced weight or +1 to a special stat, which aren't really useful either.
---
They might make it be a reward like the brewing dlc where there is a small quest line
---
I'm not sure honestly. I think certain ones are through certain pieces but I could be wrong.
---
This would create a more Hunt : Showdown or Escape From Tarkov; I love it!!! Definitely would enjoy these changes, more or less the same. Just something more dynamic then how things are with be super S P I C Y!!!
---
You're assuming that each pellet is calculated individually, but I'm pretty sure that their damage is combined before the DR calc is applied. I've tested for two-shot weapons, which probably work the same way.
---
On PC "E" (exit/enter) is right next to the W you hold down to walk
---
So it's not implemented yet?? If so, that's a bummer...
---
I have a bunch of items like that. People try to explain it away i.e. you must have added custom mods to it. Nope I checked mine, just bare bone standard weapons and armors that still weigh a lot with the ‘90% reduced weight’ feature. It looks to me that the programmer mistook ‘90% weight reduction’ as ‘90% of original weight’. So the items are slightly lighter than non-legendary but not by much.
---
It's not even about what he said, it's how much he said. He had a full playthrough where he finished pretty much everything the game had to offer. He gave his opinion on the game throughout that play through. Then he made a single (albeit 2 hour) video on his thoughts about it. That's it. No weekly "bethesda is literally hitler" videos
---
Only
---
Marsupial
---
Adrenal Reaction
---
Twisted Muscles
---
Or maybe the nuka quantum pain job?
---
Well i guess they must be hacking then lol
---
Plus all the legendary effects that are sometimes unwanted or sometimes it's good but installed to a wrong weapon.
---
😂
---
The replayability lasted a few months but it definitely fizzled out to me. Plus days gone just dropped ;p
---
Just the fact u thought he died and the poof lol
---
I go to casinos and don't put a penny in any machines.
---
When I hear a 12 year old playing a game whining about staying up a little longer so he can find a handmade like his best buddy found......... that's gambling.
---
Might be be fucking deal to you.......but when little Johnnie's mother gets her credit card bill and Bethesda gets called before Congress they are going to feel like assholes trying to claim that their game isn't a gambling device.........WHEN THEY PUT A FUCKING SLOT MACHINE IN IT......LOL
---
Yes, again bravo sir. You in turn made MY game more fun for ME to play! Lol. I would of never gotten my BE lever action that I use for like 2- 3 hours a day!!!
---
Hey! That rolling pin will split your shit S I D E W A Y S!!!! Don't sleep it!
---
Yup, just did it, we where 2 different players that both found it with our cam's, just inside some rocks, not possible to see, tucked the cam away and then i could loot "the rock" lol
---
It's seem to happen on every kill now, boddy always gone :(
---
yeah, screw code reusability!
---
next update
---
Nope, scheduled for next week.
---
There is a reason why two-shot one stars are dirt cheap and two shot explosives are not.
---
You're right it's supposed to be hard, but when 3 star legendary enemies are dropping 1 star legendary wood armor, that's a problem
---
10/10 would recommend. Whitesprings is a far greater gold mine w Tesla rifle. Love using it there...and everywhere else.
---
Optimizing your build literally means using the best items and skill combos.   Also, you might as well bitch about the upcoming backpacks, because they make calibrated shocks slightly less valuable.
---
Slap damage can’t kill you with one shot (unless you are running an extremely bloody build with only 1% health) 😱
---
Do you mean the legendary "prestige" system?
---
Beautiful. Nice work!
---
This is similar to how I feel.  I have a great house, with great weapons and gear. there is something satisfying to me about starting again from nothing and fighting your way through the low level enemies with new weapons and little ammo. but after a while I tend to just get comfortable and settle into a build and it gets repetitive. 
---
I have been considering just stripping down my main and forcing him to restart from scratch. that way I still have my plans and perk cards. but I can begin re-exploring with new builds.
---
... You're a special kind of weird.
---
I hope there isn’t that low of a limit if one at all on spins, it sounds like it’s gonna be random anyway. Imagine using your only spin and rolling something worse than before. Lol.
---
&gt;  what about all those guys who killed dupers and ditched it in the lake for the lol’s
---
They shouldn't have gotten involved, they should have recorded what they were doing and submitted a report to Bethesda. Other players had zero reason to get involved, so you pick up a bag of duped weapons and claimed to have dumped it somewhere, all you've done is slow down the dupers and now they have to dupe it all over again, putting more stress on the server (I think one dupe method fucked up servers while it was being done).
---
Right on, I'm at keys right now just waiting for folks to show
---
😂😂😂😂
---
You think anyone who knows what the hell theyre doing in this game uses PA.
---
You just discredited your whole POV to me when you said that
---
"thanks for the loot sucker"
---
Big fucking deal.
---
I second the motion! Perhaps with an accompanying phone app, to make it easier to interact.
---
I got suspended for moving ammo between accounts. Never duped. Never will. I'm even back to doing literally the same thing I was in the month leading to my ban. 
---
Loot everything, stash it, once stash is full, mule it. 
---
I've got over 11000 fusion cells just from looting. They mention in my ban email 70000 5mm rounds. What happens if I hit that number again.
---
I found out that the game options are global between both modes. so if I where to play survival, i would have to turn off pacifist but if I go back to adventure, I would have to go back in and turn it back on.
---
I run stealth sniper/ unarmed bloodied build and I wreck shit! BUT that’s because I got a couple low level unyielding pieces and worked my way up from there. Checkout the market or bazaar and cop you a legendary weapon to you  liking or maybe a piece of armor etc. the trade/ seller market is the best thing about the game imo
---
TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION 
---
VIVE LA REVOLUTION!!!!!
---
next time show both pictures together so they can easily be compared. Highly Recommended!
---
Some guy on the internet thinks I'm weird.
---
....and I'm like.....big fucking deal.
---
Just pointing out differences. The person you were talking to was arguing. Me, I was trolling.
---
Ya, but how cool would it be to fight glowing ghouls with a cheesy old monster flick playing in the backdrop.
---
He always waits until you think he's not coming anymore. Naughty little alpaca
---
That's the exception, not the rule and that's because TS applies explosive twice, making it increase damage by 40% rather than 20%. The actual good affixes (bloodied, furious, instigating) aren't dirt cheap. Also, 2 hander and fist builds can 1 shot everything as well.
---
I found the sheepsquatch imposter head in a suitcase at a train station.
---
Yeah that's pretty shit haha
---
You are blind
---
I thought this was the official way to do things?
---
I am Private Parts
---
One weird exception: Ultra-light combat torso can be learned by scrapping. Possibly a bug.
---
Yw. There's no reason you would have known they were there. It's not really intuitive that the eggs would be there.
---
Well, at least it's not months away because of delays... I hope...
---
I don't even use PA, I was making a point. But now that I've discredited myself in your eyes, I'm going to go sit in a dark room and cry.
---
Yet people insist they won't give a competitive advantage.  Imagine when faction warfare gets bigger and we have drawn out group on group fights (maybe even involving multiple respawns) - with a repair kit someone who has their main weapon break can just duck behind a wall while their team covers for them whereas if they don't have one they either have to use a less powerful secondary weapon or leave the area altogether which means the team is down a member for a bit.
---
I said you're being obtuse.  You can stop whenever you want.  If you can't, then you are obtuse.
---
If you really believe what you're saying here, you can report illegal gambling to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the branch of the FBI that deals with cyber crime.
---
https://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx/
---
I'd suggest, if you choose to go that route, that you do not argue with them when they tell you that there is no crime being committed.  That can't end well.  But, if you're correct, FO76 will be shut down and you'll have done the world a great service, saving us from...some great evil or something, I don't know.  I give up.
---
I would use it
---
Anyone out there duping repair kits if so ill pay 25caps each!..............dont get butt hurt .  This is meant to be a joke and i do not condone duping.
---
Well, they've been out of the game for several months.  That's a pretty lengthy suspension.
---
Those guys are all wrong, it’s not in the game yet. You talking about legendary player respec. They do talk about what game does after lvl 50. But yes Bethesda is now quiet about the legendary respec. Or I just haven’t seen anything new about it.
---
We'll call you willfully ignorant.
---
The patch I have been waiting for, will finally be able to experience some content from the previous patches after I exchange my legendaries and my character can move again.
---
SBQ: Just go bloodied. It's easy enough in PA, even if you don't have the best set of perks for it. Swap out some stealth perks for Dodgy.
---
Imposter: Never mind about damage, just get a pylon and you're more useful than 90% of the people who show up.
---
For some reason I though my Heavy Turret have lower perception than my level 4 turret.
---
When I built my house north of arkos Pharma to get Acid whenver I finish my adventuring and collecting scraps or need to fast travel and get a cheaper travel to other places.
---
North of my house is a campsite where enemies naturally spawn and my turrets instsntly detects them and shoots at them. But when I built my heavy turret starting when I got my goody Home defence. A scorched spawn and sniped my turret one by one
---
The blob...
---
Mmm Yes Indeed
---
True, I'm part of "they". Just trying to point out different ways people might interpret it.
---
I started a new character, did the main quest, and leveled up almost exclusively in survival. Played a melee/non power armor build. 
---
Really makes the game fresh to be in survival with a different build. Tension everywhere, limited fast travel. Highly recommend.
---
Using weight as a balancing factor is ridiculous.
---
Freaking 23 lbs. rifles is insane. Especially since the regular guns don’t have any weight perks.
---
I need plans for that bed. Mine is just gnarly looking
---
They're free. In game items. Might as well complain about being able to switch weapons on the fly. "But I don't have a bloodied handmade it's not fair!" Boo hoo.
---
Thats how i took it. You buy them. No reroll
---
Killed the queen four times yesterday as main contributor, got two stalkers’ knives, a tire iron and a piece of combat armor in total. The loot from the queen has always been bad but since two patches ago it became next to worthless.
---
It makes me laugh because people unaware of what can/cannot be locked could absentmindly unlock something thinking it's a part of the world and get a bounty. 
---
He took all of his locks off because he didn't want to be that asshole.
---
Our filter was overzealous. We've dialed it back now.
---
If you find a post has been removed in error, please message the mods. We'll fix it as soon as we can.
---
It'd be nice for adventure mode but in pvp mode it'd make high lvl players too strong
---
&gt; They don't want everyone to easily get the best of the best. It's an adventure game, they want you adventuring.
---
You still can buy "the best of the best" from dupers in eBay, Ali, websites... in seconds. Nothing more easy than this.
---
At this point, I think that the game needs a RATIONAL method for involved players to get the optimal gear they want, other than to buy it from the dupers outside of the game.
---
No shit. That was my point.
---
It was looted from getting into the 'dev room'. Item is still not in-game.
---
I want some of those Harper's ferry turrets.
---
I guess I did forget to put that in for just adventure mode lol.
---
Lol
---
My problem is I didn't notice the stash limit till it was full, now I have tonnes of meds, bobble heads, and magazines taking up the stash. Might open "Justin yermums medicine cabinet"
---
I enjoyed the first 50 levels more the second time, but then I rushed most of the quests first time around because I was playing entirely with a team.
---
Played rifle first time, mostly shotgun second time.
---
Um.   Of course there are a bunch of things in the game which give a competitive advantage.  The point is they are not selling them in the Atom store...  It would be like selling that bloodied handmade in the Atom store or any other powerful weapon...  They promised not to do this.
---
So you seem to be missing the point with your comparison.  Also just want to point out that you are bordering on being 'not nice' with your Boo Hoo stuff - it comes off as 'making fun of' others and you might want to work on your interpersonal effectiveness skills.
---
We don't joke about duping on this sub. It's like joking about Hiroshima and Nagasaki in japan
---
Get rid of weapon artisans and fix it good. Only equip them when repairing. They’re just a waste to have on all the time. Also consider having revanent for boss fights and pvp, it’s under endurance.
---
I had an issue a few days ago with the Queen, but I was able to do this challenge yesterday, so I don't know what causes it.
---
Also, helps to mention your platform
---
This is the lemonade stand vendor who sells lemonade and hard lemonade recipes. He can be found in a handful of locations, it seems this one was in one of his cranberry bog locations when this picture was taken.
---
Prime is good for crimson, and far better than Whitesprings. Just pick up all the blast berries.
---
the Excavator was designed to give a set bonus of +100 carry weight when you use the entire set. as well as a mining yield increase with both arms on the same chassis.
---
DR and ER on the Excavator are the lowest of any power armor, so you are trading protection for utility
---
I don’t agree with lowering accuracy at all, but you make some great points. We’ll have to just wait and see what the Nuclear Winter game mode brings because it’s possible that it is something along these lines.
---
oh i got you. pip-boy repair isn't fast enough for you
---
Good on you my friend, I've pointed a couple people your way (well, the mods in general, not you specifically), glad to see you're on top of things.
---
You find them throughout Appalachia. Vendors don't sell them. If you go to mama dolces, directly west of that is a small shack/shed, should have one that regularly spawns there. If empty, make your way to Morgantown Trainyard, their should be one that spawns inside one of the train cars
---
There’s several places to get them. Best place is go to watoga station and go south east. There’s a place there that’s a camp. You can get it there
---
Yes one is because of pacifist mode and the other is because Bethesda took away damage to non hostile players,what they called slap damage. Just trying to keep the information strait, way too many players are confused as Bethesda doesn't alway explain things well
---
Great idea. Like prestige
---
it was in the golf course but ima say it anyway some rando dropped thousands of tse gat plasmas, gauses, 50. cals,  god roll melles ect.
---
Did it just a few days ago when reworking my camp.
---
Always had the chance.  Got 4 flux at my first kill about 3 weeks after release.
---
What thats not funny either?
---
So how much is the Tax?
---
Yeah well i'd like that very much. In fallout 4 i could use basically every weapon because every lvl i get a skill point and i loved how at first i could play as rifle man, then a few lvls later i could invest in pistols or sneaking and then maybe heavy weapons. But now changing your build is very tedious and you can't switch right back so once you have a build you're gonna have to live with it.
---
I didn't sign a contract saying I'd be nice when I signed up for Reddit. It's not my job to make you feel warm and fuzzy. 
---
You're complaining about free in-game items. That are superior to the Atom variety. You can choose to not use them, that's up to you. It's a very boo hoo story if you refuse to use something you can get for literally free, just because someone else chooses to use them. You're dying because you're stubborn and you want everyone else to go down with you, when there's a free option right there.
---
No. They already mentioned a little while back that they would make it so people can’t destroy your base anymore unless you engage in PvP. That feature is coming on May 7.
---
I can donate steel if you’re on PS4.
---
By the way, you can move your camp a few centimetres and everything will get repaired without using resources. You just have to re-place everything.
---
What kinda bloodied tesla ya got?
---
You got real quiet when called out on your bullshit, now didn’t you.
---
watoga has a bunch of them, just throw the armor on it on the ground.. or scrap it
---
What platform are you on PS4 or Xbox One?
---
Some guy on the internet thinks I'm ignorant.
---
They already said they ate going to make it so player can’t destroy your base anymore unless you engage in PvP. Turrets won’t attack them as they won’t do damage to your base. The feature is coming May 7.
---
It would be great then I could actually favourite what I want to instead of what I want to protect from fast paced selling.
---
PS4
---
Big dog would be cool there’s a small dog in game on top of the cliff in the mire
---
Many barns throughout Appalachia contain a power armor chassis.
---
It's for selling your legendaries for Scrip, can't buy anything from it - that's why we have to wait for the Purveyor to surface.
---
Is explained in the article text but it's an interesting point that it has a slot machine on it.
---
Thanks all!
---
Drops jet pack mods more frequently now too. I’ve gotten all of them (except XO-1, of course).
---
Okay, I'm sure someone from that platform will probably contact you.
---
I'd enjoy this and not having the legendary enemy that I just killed instantly despawn before I can loot it.
---
I'll never forget you bloodied swing speed +1 str super sledge
---
I had it once just north of the KMAX station in the south of the Mire. He ran in to kill some moleminers. The other time was at the location west of the Watoga Train station along the tracks. He again showed up to just start fighting the Scorched that were stationed there.
---
Understandable, how many 1 stars or 2 stars that are trash I get maybe 500 is too much but 250ish
---
Oh I'm aware of that. But we'll know it for a fact within a week.
---
Belching Betty if you aren't trying to fire a shot. FT and go in building right in front of you
---
Im assuming when they come in adventure mode, it will be when camps can no longer take (all? or just player) damage. Thats my guess as to why they haven't already come. They want to release that patch first.
---
Exactly like those. If you lurk long enough in the markets, or farm top of the world armor benches long enough, you can eventually come across them.
---
You can mod them per the last update.
---
It is all good.  Doesn't hurt me when people do the whole 'boo hoo' making fun of people thing.  It just makes you look like an ass and lose respect.
---
Also experience is free in game.  What would you say to people being able to buy XP?  The most powerful armor and weapons are also free but it would become pay to win if you could just buy them rather than putting in the work.
---
I'm sure we'll know very soon.
---
I don't even care about defence, we just need the budget for aesthetic items
---
This is definitely a bug and has been around since patch 8 if not mistaken.
---
Sometimes it will also drain your plasma core from 200 down to 0 in a second and require you reload again.
---
No. Sony kiboshed the x-platform play options. Even with a universal Bethesda account, your character is tied to the platform.
---
Stop scaring the studio audience
---
You are being represented by the overseer lol
---
Did they have a work shop at any point during your game?
---
I had that happen doing Lode Bearing the other day. I was still in the mine.
---
Beeing? Like w/ bees?
---
Truuueee
---
pistols do, big guns do, explosives (grenades and explosive ammo) do, shotguns do. only one that does not is rifles from what i have seen
---
You cant use it yourself, and 1 use = 1 bottle
---
RELEASE: SUMMER 2019
---
Summer will bring another series of major updates to Fallout 76, including Nuclear Winter - an entirely new way to play that changes the rules of the wasteland.
---
New Feature: Legendary Players – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Who knows what that actually means.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019p
---
No we had no workshops for that very reason
---
I believe that is from the sheepsquach quest. I’ve had that drop by my house too. Usually you see something like that happen with duplicate keys, holotapes, technical data and such. I believe you actually dropped it by force on Bethesda’s side. I see it more common in technical data. Not so much on keys anymore. But I believe Calvin was either the burrows or sheepsquach.
---
Legendary vendor is a she according to Inside the Vault
---
And there **won’t** be buyable legendary currency, but I do enjoy your pitch fork enthusiasm there
---
Almost 200 hours in the game.... aaand what’s a dragon?
---
Found one by mama dolces.  Thanks man
---
If that happens—and I don’t think it will—but if it does, I’m out.
---
That note should be over at the curios shop.  Weird.
---
Sucks mate
---
I didn’t believe either till I lost my excavator chest between a fast travel
---
No biggie, just a chest, who cares, remade it; but it’s a thing
---
What console are you on? Can probably hook you up with a new rig if it’s xbox and you’re strapped for cash
---
No I left when I realized that you didn't understand anything about economics. You're just whining.
---
This happened to me twice my bloodied knife and BE rifle. Was not happy. I have all kinds of high end gear that just sits in my box now because I don’t want to loss it.
---
Just arseholes that can’t pick fights in real life. It’s called a Napoleon complex, or inferiority complex. They’re weak in real life so acting tough makes them feel better. This hasn’t happened to me yet, probably because of my level, but if it did I’d either just kill them until they left for free caps or ignore them, let them have their little hissy fit at my base and repair it when they’re done.
---
Yeah it's not just weapons.  A tattered field jacket mysteriously disappeared from my inventory the other day.  Kind of scary when you're carrying 100k+ in weapons.
---
I agree but Bethesda did make a point when they rebalanced the turrets to be cheaper. Everything you do will directly affect server stability. So they have to monitor stability while making budget changes and stash box changes. With player vending coming out next week, that’s something else they have to monitor.
---
As much as I agree and wish I had more room to build, I’d much rather have stable servers that I can actually play on. I’m sure they will increase it as they fix stability issues and continue to deal with duper’s. You can pretty much directly blame duper’s for stability issues. The same for repetitive bug exploits.
---
[](/celestiabarf)I see drunk robrobrains, and chem'd out Ms. Nannys in this wasteland, I could imagine a blackout pipboy losing track of your stuff.  
---
  
---
How about it? Did'ja spill some Nukashine on yer' ol' pipboy?  
---
(Sucks what happened to ya' man. at least it's something you can craft again)
---
Hell, I'll never use a repair kit.  I've got fix it good and the one for weapons.  I always repair at benches and make it a habit of checking equipment condition on the regular.
---
I found a both a 3* pipe wrench and lead pipe on my last character and played a plumber
---
my concern is if a player shows up and starts shooting up the camp and the turrets retaliate does that send us into PVP as if a workshop was being contested? We will know soon.
---
For me, the game continues slowing improving in all areas.
---
Two steps forward, one step back, two steps forward, one step back... 
---
I guess it must be complicated to handle a game of this magnitude and complexity. I take it.
---
Ah I missed that little detail. Happens when ya just skim.
---
And I do hope that is the way things end up being. I'm just proposing the what if and say hey I said it first.
---
Heavy ass handmades. I guess I made mine out of lead.
---
You shut up when I asked you to back up your slander of me with some actual facts.
---
Ugh this so much
---
Ok thank you that’s kind of what I thought I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t doing something wrong and I could be using better armor with the same carry weight bonus
---
Haha that is too awesome
---
I have 4-5  lvl 40 rad-toads that spawn at my camp every time I log in and respawn every 15 minutes so I have 8 heavy turrets and 2 missile turrets to cover all angles to minimise the damage they do, plus i get all the free meat and eggs + occasional extras all the time.
---
I also love both those game (tarkovs devs can go hang however but the game itself is great) but if you wanted that then go play that. Trying to adapt fallout into a super spicy hardcore pvp murderfest seems like a losing battle it's very hard to have a proper pvp experience when there is a level system tied to how much damage you do and how much you can take it means that skill takes a backseat to numbers. You can land as many headshots as you like but if you are lvl 10 and they are 200 you are going to have a bad time.
---
Yes both hunt and tarkov do have levels but neither of them directly tie the damage you can do to them if you get a AK-105 it works the same for a level 1 as a level 40 aside from the soft skills which make little differences to things like handling and reload time, things that a person could improve upon with practice and training not somehow being able to make a rifle have more Powa.
---
You would also need things like item sinks otherwise it becomes a race to the meta items (but more than normal) due to the "more realistic" damage models people tend to want in things like this it means you just made that super-powerful gun that much more powerful when everything is buying the farm with half a dozen 10mm rounds. The inability to lose items would mean that as soon as you have the best item then that is it you are now the most powerful and unless you somehow accidentally scrap it that's not going to change unless newer better items come around though nerfs or new items altogether. People need to be dethroned and the balance of power needs to be mutable otherwise it becomes "facestomp sim 2000" and we have enough of that in real life if i wanted to be shat on from a great high by someone with advantages that i won't be able to get due in great part to the people s\*\*\*ting on you from a great height at every turn i would go back to working in a large corporate office. That is only fun for the people on the top and for them without the people to stomp on the fun fades fast leaving like proper pvp people but they won't be there, they will be playing a game that was balanced "properly" from the start.
---
I'm not saying you couldn't do it but chances are a truly hardcore fallout game with all the issues of the Fallout games on the current engine would be horrible to play. And I would not trust Bethesda to do it either if there is a chance of pulling this off it would have to come from the modding community.
---
wowow that is wall of text for what should have been a pretty small reply.
---
lol what
---
I spent hours server hopping to tame a dog for my camp. He only lasted a few hours before he got killed :(
---
Yeah I feel really bad about the ones that lose their fave weapon. I can craft this again easy just crazy it’s happening to more people now
---
No! I have failed my one true goal lol.
---
Yes.
---
I’m sure it’s relatively difficult. Especially considering Bethesda has almost no experience in online games when it comes to them being the ones directly in charge of the game production and stability. I see a lot of bugs they claimed that they fixed but didn’t fully fix as well. I praise them for certain things and then I shun in a way for oblivious behavior. Such as nerfing perk cards, weapons, armor and altering loot tables without saying a word. Hopefully people will start praising them more for the good so that they can get honest feedback but also feel like the game is worth putting that extra effort in. They are people too. They make bad choices and they make good ones. Gotta hear both sides.
---
That sucks. I feel bad for people that lose really rare things like that. Sorry that happened to you :/
---
I’m sorry that happened to you :(
---
hopefully next patch they will drop the "no Non PVP player damage to camps" in the next patch.
---
You’re so kind. I’m on ps4 but I can make another one very easily. Just feeling really bad for the people that lose their favorite weapons and rare outfits and such, you know? But now I’m a firm believer this is happening
---
Wait,that's illegal
---
Sorry I’m on PS4
---
I dont know what happened lol
---
You can name the Power Armour Chassis from your inventory if you inspect it and rename.
---
Then you will really enjoy the invisible enemy spawn . 
---
If i could only count the number of times i have died due to that :)

Look at you wanting a free economy while taking the man's 1400 cap dole every day. Do you honestly think those bots can resell the 50 civil war era suits you sold them? It's all just scheme to make you feel productive while secretly giving you a handout.
---
Its not. Why oonlee melee was capped is something to thank the tse whiners for

It’s so weird that they haven’t added this. I know Bethesda devs are a bit special in the head but damn. Consoles can at least message each other outside of the game.
---
I’ve only created one additional character. It was such a grind to get to level 50. The story has no re-playability. If you’ve played through it once, you’ve seen it all. So I asked a friend to help me level up by grinding Whitesprings, West-Tek, and the Cranberry Bog.
---
Lol, fair enough, I’ll shout credit to this callout if it comes true :p
---
Lol, was kinda forced into it. I’ve one shorted it before a few times, but i was down to 4 minutes and the only person who showed up literally ran away lol.
---
I only got five too... : /
---
My first account was suspended for the same brown bag pickup. Never duped but agree I should have left it alone. I just talked to support the other day after 4 months and was just told it’s being looked into still with no eta. I’d be fine with it getting scrubbed, I just want the username back.
---
Fact is you're an idiot and can't understand that printing money (duping) caused rapid inflation if the economy.
---
You're probably one of the idiots who has a Bernie Sanders bumper sticker on your car, if you even have a car.
---
So true. I just asked a friend to help me level up by grinding Whitesprings, West-Tek, and the Cranberry Bog.
---
Yup happens to me all the time.  Not sure yet of a guaranteed method to avoid this so if someone knows would be great to share
---
We need to reevaluate the weight of things.... like rifles...
---
If it's Whitesprings there are ghouls in the ceiling which drop down.
---
I believe you are correct. However, there is almost always a new bug. And I do have hope.
---
Please upvote this post if you agree with it, we need Bethesda to see these survival mode suggestions if we want the mode to be good. I can't see myself ever playing it in the state that it's in because PvP is completely unbalanced (and they have yet to comment on locking survival mode to new characters only or even simple balancing fixes).
---
Nah it was in my friends base
---
All good, so much junk in my box, need to cull it soon anyway, haha
---
No joke, glad I haven’t lost any of my decent stuff... ^^yet
---
Sounds like socialism but ok /s
---
I've found doing the story and random quests you find along the way to be more beneficial. Unless of course you have a few buddies who can handle big hoards and you can just sit back and tag for XP.
---
2000.
---
I remember hearing about it maybe in a interview. They better though cause since I heard it I’ve been trying to save one of each lol
---
Ps: this question is for pvp purpouses
---
Haven't noticed a difference myself, but I don't use power armor a whole lot so my expectations may be skewed. When I'm in it it's ultracite.
---
Didn’t Bethesda promise everyone that this wouldn’t happened?
---
I have had to bring my repair cards up to their max level to get to 200% build and that seems to solve my problem.
---
From my understand the photo must have a king queen and a hunter or spawn.
---
So I have to take a picture of all of them?
---
All in one, good luck with that...
---
In one picture yes. Posted before finishing typing my bad
---
Because never before has a Fallout game had gambling mechanics in it.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_casinos
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gambling
---
Nope, never.
---
Oh no someone on the internet doesn't respect me whatever will I do?
---
I don't PvP so what other people do doesn't really matter to me:
---
Other people already have better weapon and armor than I do. 
---
Other people power level, there are level 700s out there. 
---
Other people paid real money for weapons on eBay.
---
None of that matters because it doesn't effect me. As long as the same item is available to me for free, why would I care if someone else buys it?
---
Heck, I've bought ammo on the subreddit. Does that make me a monster? 🤔
---
I don't want the game to be F2W. I don't. But I don't really think this is going to make that. Hopefully everyone will refuse to buy them. But I don't really see that happening either.
---
Whitesprings. Buy what you need and server hop. They'll replenish.
---
Happens to me, as well.
---
Mirelurk hatchlings are going to be a b*tch to get and take a picture of.
---
All of the vendors sell junk. It's just a matter of hitting them at the right time for the materials you need. And that could be almost any time. Just have to keep checking or farm those materials yourself. I break down a lot of guns and any equipment or anything I can to gain all the materials I need to keep up my repairs.
---
You're both very talented! Send me a message with the price you would charge for an A3 poster with your art, please. Love the one you posted here, but could also be any other one you want to do - I want to encourage and help artists whenever possible (I'm a wannabee photographer an know how hard it can be!).
---
Or I can kill all of them in one spot and take a picture of there corpses.
---
Yes, they're a small company compared to the giants. But they're not actually giants. It is something I find quite interesting.
---
I tried doing it with the queen spawn location above watoga and I couldn't get it. But I just watched a youtube video by InnovSurvivalist and I guess you gotta have them all. Like a family picture. I shall try again when I log back in.
---
Some guy posted a guide on an easy how to in the glass cavern
---
But will they add 10% to that 10% and then 10% to that 10%?
---
Just pointing out that the math of saying "just add 10%" is mathematically incorrect, 10% of 100 is 10, 10+100=110, 10% of 110 is 11, leaving you with 99 not 100. Technically you'd multiply your wanted price by 10/9 (or just add 1/9th of the value to it) to get the new price you'd want after removing 10%. Ex, 100*10/9 = 111.1 repeating, 10% of 111.1 repeating is 11.1 repeating, 111.1 R - 11.1 R = 100.
---
Hunters are a pain to spawn in. They’re so rare.
---
as long as it's not too obstructing, I don't want some big ass text of some bot trying to scam people into clicking their shady link to cover my screen
---
They can be dead just not meat piles. And ita a hunter or a spawn but must have a queen and king
---
Link please if you can.
---
Oh Lord the masses of already begun.  Calm down and go back to wetting yourself over repair kits.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
FUCKING PLEASE. SOMETIMES I NEED TO COMMUNICATE AND ITS 3 IN THE FUCKING MORNING AND MY KIDS ARE ASLEEP AND I SHOULD BE TOO, BUT IM NOT, AND I CANT TALK TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF STUPID LIMITED “EMOTES”
---
Honestly I enjoy the free kits just wish they didnt have weight...
---
Agree. I've been using the quarry above watoga and didn't know it was a family picture and thought it was each mob solo lol
---
I only carry a vampire laser gat and my entire character is built around it. The light show still makes me happy and with the vampire affect I can facetank the queen and everything in the bog at once. (I do have a lot of defensive and damage avoidance perks as well. the damage is not as high as most of the ballistic heavies but the range and accuracy are really good. I do have to repair it a lot and the fusion core consumption is real. a single queen fight sets me back 10 to 15 cores a regular scorch costs about a fusion core and a half. that is a bit of perk as well though because it gives me purpose to gather the cores. I prefer farming the cores VS making ammo like for typical weapons. I don't like being in the crafting menu any more than I have to. with fusion cores I make ammo slower and less efficient but I can take the power plant and have them generate passively while I don't do things involving crafting. so its nice for me. I am wierd though, I would rather take an hour to drive to the power company and and back to pay the bill in person than log in and pay it with credit card in 15 minutes. I really don't make sense to myself in many ways.
---
That suuucccckkkkkssss
---
What about having a certain radius in which you could send a message on your pip boy and everyone in that circle gets a “message” or “alert” on their pip boy. Put it in the radio section or something
---
Did you even read the post? The op is just saying that junk should be considered differently than individual items because it takes up less memory to track 800 lbs of scrap divided into 53 categories than it does 800 lbs of items divided into possibly over a thousand categories.

Link if I did it right
---
I don’t know if it’s related but power core duration seems to have been nerfed too. I’m getting through them at at least 3 times the rate I was.
---
While it may not directly mean that, it doesn't change the fact that because they're so hilariously small, it's not fair at all to compare them software/entertainment/or even quality-wise to companies that have up to 30 people for every single one person BGS has.
---
It doesn't excuse much, but when you think about it, it explains a hell of a lot more about their day 1 content than the common "Bad Engine" slam.
---
&gt;When I hear a 12 year old playing a game whining about staying up a little longer so he can find a handmade like his best buddy found......... that's gambling.
---
By this logic, any video game with RNG of any kind is gambling.
---
There have been a couple of posts that mention that the 'native' DR of the frame is no longer  applying once you furnish it with the relevant pieces.
---
Whether this is the case or not should be simple enough to verify.
---
Take all the pieces off, note your DR stats, then equip one piece at a time and verify that it 'adds up'.
---
Thanks dude!!!
---
Deflection, avoidance, and personal attacks. I could make a wild accusation about your political ideology, but I’m not like you.
---
You're being disingenuous. Don't put your spin on my logic
---
And they had to port the same game everywhere,, even to Alexa just to pay the bills for the past 8 years.
---
I'll check tomorrow and let ya know.
---
Hidden by default, but being able to swap between none, global, local and team would be good

My brother -tripping the light fantastic - facetanking all of the bog while creating a dazzing lightshow off the back of a mirelurk queens ass. laser gat is the way, laser gat is the future. all hail the laser gat!

That's good to know.
---
I've actually had very similar thing happening with my Excavator Power Armor and I has really confused when I only took like two shots from a scorched in it. It's probably a bug because out of PA I take more shots somehow.
---
Had this happen to me a couple of times, no mutations, no workshop and in pacifist mode and get one shot in adventure mode. I’m not sure how the hell its possible but people seem to have found a way.
---
We should develop a posse to take groups like this out.
---
I've just been playing the past 2/3 weeks, and that plays scares me, I went in for the first time today while it was nuked and honestly the non nuked area is much scarier. Especially cause there is less players in the area when it Isn't nuked
---
That would make sense. What causes that
---
Please tell me he only uses black powder weapons
---
It's literally what you said though.
---
Bassicaly The first owner,Todd made a public announcement like some other server makers about Vendetta what got him banned,then Friend took over,not much after i became a moderator and as the game launched slowly we all lost any hope in both the game and the server so friend decided to sell it for quite a big amount of money,few days later the kid who got ownership did what you already know he did,us mods made a new server and invited everyone we could to it but the discord community just collapsed at some point,we reported friend for selling a discord server but considering i still found him in welcome msgs from months ago means hes not a deleted user so discord never really gave a fuck  
---
EDIT NOTE: Friend was a jackass right after he sold it,i doubt he actually sold it,the kids probably his friend or something
---
That's lovely
---
Gotta wait a few weekz
---
For you maybe not for me I'll just increase it by 10% pass the burden on to the buyer and go about my business
---
No it's not. It's what you chose to hear.
---
Hey Im on right now!   Add me: awheaton65
---
Yeah, black powder, lever rifles, and axes
---
Do you use VATS or Power Attack?
---
Those two chomp through the FC and Power User does not mitigate it.
---
Don't know if that specifically will be a thing. But the update to allow us to decorate camp with items in inventory was pushed out at least a couple weeks.
---
The game was intentionally made broken (white knight nerfed) to create a demand for repair kits. Next time they will break food spoil rate to sell you Food Kit, then they will nerf ammo drops to sell you Ammo Kits and so on, until the game is unplayable without donations.
---
the way two-shot legendary is it increases damage by 25% and the weapon shoots an extra projectile, that way with a hunting rifle or minigun each projectile is dealing \~62.5% of the max damage, which with say the combat shotgun each projectile is dealing about 11.1% more damage, however in most cases the final damage dealt comes out higher, even with the lower damage of normally single projectile weapons. And I don't think they changed the way multi-projectile weapons are calculated as it's been per projectile since Fallout 3 and was such in 4, however I can give it some testing later.
---
my plan was to just wait and repair they're gone now got bored about 10mins after i posted this
---
It was probably a nuke zone an hour prior to your visit.  The flowers and ghouls stay the same for a while after the nuke is over.
---
You sure are effected by other small things like people stating different opinions.  Kind of feel bad for you.  Anyways I am done with this thread because I do have better things to do.  It does entertain me a tad bit that you are so invested in trying to make fun of people online wallowing in whatever emotion it is that drives you.  I wouldn't call you a monster just someone with issues who is making an ass out of themselves.  Again, I have better things to do so have a good day.  You can rant all you want.
---
&gt; pitch fork enthusiasm 
---
[](/kcelestiabeautiful)I wasn't going to say anything, but after reading that I just have to say: I love what Bethesda has done with the pitchfork, no longer do I have to decide between a torch ***OR*** the pitchfork when it's angry mob time it can be **BOTH!**  
---
Thanks, Bethesda... NOW DON'T MAKE ME USE IT!
---
Sorry you’re getting downvoted, mutations have large boosts with minimal risk outside of the str losses.
---
I literally quoted your exact words. What other way could that be interpreted other than "RNG loot is gambling"?
---
This is only because another player sold them to that vendor
---
I don't remember, it was less than a year ago. Maybe last Fall.
---
You're the one ranting about other people playing a different way than you want them to. 😂
---
Not really, would like Bethesda to fix it as it very much defeats the point of having adventure mode lol
---
I'll give an upvote for creativity not the intent. Lol
---
Those jokes started being funny the minute he left the theater
---
It's not actually in the game yet so there's no way to know for sure. As I've said about 10 times I've already read the entire damn article that's why I wrote this.
---
Isn't that because you lose the radio signal?
---
It's not so bad for me.  I would feel bad if someone just quit because their item they can't replace vanishes.  I hope they figure this out sooner than later.
---
I am ok with stash tying to vending I'm just worried advertising my camp with a sale will cause people trollers to destroy the camp.  That will make me not use the vending
---
My understanding is the explosion stops the jumps so no.
---
Wouldn't mind donating caps and ammo to that,
---
though it would be a little Minutemeny.
---
Yeah would be nice if they fixed it
---
Retaining wall dirt foundations would solve a lot of problems.
---
That's true. I'm going to wait till after the update and give this some thought.
---
I’m betting they got their arses handed to them in PvP and they needed to vent... guess they forgot they could literally leave world and get the same spot but just decided on being a dick....
---
Wait.
---
It was fun. A majority of players would come by and drop bags of materials and such to contribute. But it only takes one random ass hat to ruin it. It should be set up where teams can hold them and random groups can share ownership.
---
I never even needed White Knight, I repair my armor very seldomly. 
---
And spoil rate has been jacked for longer than WK has been nerfed. 🤔
---
Bethesda already has this for ESO so I guess it could be implemented in Fallout as well.
---
What about the hatchlings?
---
Heavy weapons user, I never use vats in power armour for exactly that reason. Think it might be bugged as I’ve been one shot killed in adventure mode a couple of times this week too (no mutations, pacifist mode, no workshop and not in a team). At level 125 I shouldn’t be one shot by anything lol.
---
Agreed on the visit with the flux, but I've been starving for Legendaries and have had shit luck up until now, in particular when roaming nuked zones.  It seems like lately you can just stroll into WS in broad daylight and walk away with tons of stuff.
---
Granted we're not talking 3\* stuff, but hey - I'm working off a low base here :)
---
 Contributing to a conversation is not ranting.  Don't want to continue this thread but do need to communicate this.  You are the one ranting like an immature ass.
---
It’s haunted
---
some of the mole miners have higher pitched voices already
---
Yeah
---
Platform?
---
hmu on xbox if you want my gt is my name TotallyTachanka
---
At least I wont have to play with people such as yourself. So that's a win.
---
Do they have any schedule for their inventories?
---
I hear ya, if you're new... felt the same way when I started.  If you see me roamin on Xbox (DaveCz) drop me a shout - will watch your back through the perils of WS.
---
A black powder rifle on steroids.
---
I was just there twice and it was literally dead. Good server. Stay on it and go farm. That is how I’ve got my best drops.
---
Sometimes it goes into orbit, and crash lands in the forest!
---
I am on Xbox as well.
---
I just thought I'd post some thoughts. The game has some strengths...but it also has glaring weak points. I can see why some enjoy it, thought. It's got freedom and atmosphere in spades.
---
That's fair, probably right.
---
naw that sounds more like a old school radio dial turning off
---
Server hop at the giant teapot, he spawns on one of the picnic tables
---
The Goody Mk8 Turrets. I missed those. Mk. 8 Turrets are explosive incendiary ammo so they're pretty good . A common exploit in FO4 is to keep rebuilding the same turret over and over again until you get the Mk. 8 Turret
---
I do not know the exact schedule but I know that they are on a 20-hour cycle.  There are players that do dump a lot of the scrap at venders to make room in their stash. Also watch for paper bags on the ground at the vendors because many times I have found some really good stuff in those bags.
---
I feel your pain. 🤦‍♂️
---
I wouldn’t mind getting a legendary Bobby pin as long as it never breaks lolz
---
I haven't noticed anything... yet.     But I mostly wear T51 and Ultracite.  I'm a power armor heavy weapons build so I am in PA  quite a bit. Did a nuke silo run today and didn't notice a problem. But that doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist. I'm wondering if there's something that maybe triggers it.
---
There is also a brotherhood of steel vendor at White springs that handles a lot of plans for armor and there mods.
---
Infinite stash exploit with artillery&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Felt good having 3k of Junk chilling there
---
Lolz
---
Same I now have 3 characters, 2 stealth (1 sniper and 1 heavy weapons,)  and now 1 automatic rifleman .
---
I seem to get the weirdest stuff
---
lucy k is correct you will only be able to sell you legendarys for scrip.
---
I am. You’re more than welcome to see it. Pm me
---
Absolutely this! I’m at max budget and will probably have to delete things to make room for players vending lol
---
Stealth heavy weapons seems like an oxymoron....
---
What i think is that we don't need more stash weight, we need better ways of managing it and sorting it. There's no doubt about 200 pounds of useless shit in my stash that i have a hard enough time spotting and tossing.
---
You are making assumptions based on the photo.  We have been burned in the past getting our hopes up.
---
I rename my items so my keepers always stay at the top of the list. Weapons example:
---
01 Fixer
---
02 Shotgun 
---
03 Gauss
---
(I also map them to faves wheel in that order)
---
With armor, the system is:
---
AA Leather Chameleon Chest
---
AA L Arm Leather Healing
---
AA L Leg Leather AutoStim
---
AAPA Excavator
---
(And so on)
---
That way all sellable stuff falls below my keepers.
---
Oh yes that too. Also martial artist. Increases swing speed which increases dps a lot.
---
And revenant is good for teams or boss fights like the Queen. Serious increase in damage and for 2 minutes, which is pretty good. Not everyone likes having to go down though.
---
Just had this happen to me on PS4. Very frustrating: is it gone forever on PS4? There’s no real way for me to open up a support ticket via console.
---
Please do this more often!
---
Yeah, I noticed :(
---
It's gambling once you add in micro transactions.
---
Fallout 4 added cosmetic micro transactions but never hid anything behind RNG. The game was open to the mod community and it wasn't difficult to find legendaries.
---
You're are being willfully ignorant.
---
You should probably just quit playing now so you dont get pissed later. lMAO
---
Tbh I wouldn't mind if they somehow just dropped the legendary loot pools into the legendary vendor list, at least it'd be comparable and not just garbage predetermined ones.
---
It’s fun as hell to play. Lolz
---
That’s probably exactly what will happen, you’ll get 1 token per star for each piece and new items will be 500+. Then they’ll release different size bundles available from the atom store.
---
I don’t mind a few caps lost adding 10 percent would be fine
---
Got the camera a hour ago at a monument south of the civilwar cemetary
---
Well, assuming that even ever happens, I'll use the kits that drop from the SBQ as I've got a dozen or more already and they repair 150% instead of just the full amount
---
You need to take a picture with the hatchlings OR a hunter. You don’t need both
---
I'd like to sink everything into the ground so it's not floating.
---
&gt; you are bordering on being 'not nice' with your Boo Hoo stuff
---
I'm not who you were replying to, but good lord aren't you a sensitive one. I really worry about you in the real big bad world
---
5 days. The patch releases on Tuesday, May 7th.
---
I do miss going down the list of weapons, repair was greyed out then it lights up on a weapon that needs it. Repair, repair, skip, repair, done.
---
Those were the days... Member? I member....
---
Hahaha wow
---
Thanks for telling me!
---
Did you read the article
---
Omg this
---
Love the lmg but man does it burn through ammo
---
There are hackers in this game. Seen two cases already, both of them killed me in a similar way as described by op. They are normally low-level (even level 1) with marsupial and explosive weapons.
---
Omw to you. Sorry so late.
---
Always had a giant red drop of flux from the scorched earth event, not the queen herself.
---
Yeah would have been great if I didnt bloe through almost 600 rounds of my rifle ammo on trash like supermutants and radrats...oh well.
---
Nice suggestions man. You should make them a separate post
---
👍

---
You mean this one. Where it says " when we release Patch 9 on May 7 ."
---
You can tame dogs? :0
---
What does "Caps from your sale, minus a nominal fee of 10% to maintain a healthy in-game economy, will be added to your Cap balance" mean? We have a tax?
---
Also, if anyone will be able to see our camp location, then players shouldn't be able to destroy our camp unless we attack back. The amount of times that people have destroyed my camp without me retaliating is ridiculous. I'm not about to let everyone know where my camp is if more people are going to ruin it constantly.
---
It literally says its pushed back a few weeks
---
I believee it
---
The machine looks like it's bodged together out of a bunch of different things, maybe a bunch of the caps just get lost or chewed up by the machinery each time it's operated.
---
That's highly unlikely, they know that if they do that it will fuck the entire game.
---
Don't really understand why you were downvoted for this, since this actually happened to me. Didn't have enough circuitry to repair my laser rifle, so I said "fuck it" and repaired it using an improved kit. Don't get me wrong, the reason the option exists at the workstation is probably redundant code that the devs are too lazy to fix, but OP's claim that no one will EVER use repair kits at a workbench is a silly claim.
---
DISPLAY CASES ARE COMING
---
As some of you may already be aware, we’re planning to add display cases so that you can show off some of the items you’ve collected, such as weapons, bobbleheads, and magazines, in your C.A.M.P.s. We’re excited to bring this feature to the game, but it’s going to take a little more time and testing to make sure we get it right. As a result, display cases are going to arrive a few weeks after we release Patch 9. We know many of you are waiting to be able to flaunt your collections, and we appreciate your patience.
---
I was in the Ash Heap had 3 SBs attacking and that bug with the Plasma Gat was Fucking annoying, especially when in Vats.
---
PLEASE! do it like WoW, a general channel, a trade channel, etc. The number of times where I wish I could ask folks if they wanted to do a sheepsquatch with me...
---
10% so if you sell something for 1,000 caps you only get 900.
---
Even the brahmin levitates.
---
Just go carnivore and use butcher's bounty on your kills. Then you don't even have to cook it unless you want the effects or slower spoilage.
---
No, the vending machines release on Tuesday. They were originally supposed to release in April, but got delayed to this patch, which it literally says will be released on Tuesday.
---
Did you not read what i posted
---
What dog, man why dog! Do you have a dog with armor ?
---
Look at Captain Noob's video on the level 1 pipe pistol. He easily took down a scorchbeast with one. It all matters on your build and ability to use said build. PvE is already perfect enough as it is.
---
Mine started making the same exact noise last night. T51 with nukashine paint job.
---
I ran into 1 at welch and killed it with the help of a scorched....apparently sheepy was too mad to actually hit said scorched  also encountered another one (both were level 50 legendaries) near the big mining machine in the ash heap (forget the name sorry) but with no helpful scorched around I just ran. To be fair I was level 35 when I found both of them.
---
That would work too.
---
I already got flamed by the fanboys earlier for posting this. Get ready for a lot of down votes.
---
Ah. that didn't show when I replied; sorry. Display cases are delayed. I assumed OP was talking about putting Nuka Cola in machines for selling purposes. My apologies.
---
It does work like this for favorted items. But as we have a limit on the amount of favorted it kinda sucks that i's so limited.
---
Yes!  The OP is right. I live down the road.  Ask someone who lives there...
---
My stash is going to be reduced by 60% with the legendary scrapping. So I'm excited. :)
---
I built the perfect base but due to budget limits I can’t decorate it as much as I want. I hope they raise the limit, especially considering they are about to add a lot of new C.A.M.P objects with the Ever Upwards DLC
---
oh yeah. i forgot you could lock the water. i had left mine purposely unlocked since they have a weight limit that is almost always reached before i even get back.
---
I totally feel you on a lot of observations you wrote about, being a casual/ but everyday player of the game :). It's not the best game ever, but Bethesda is genius when it comes to making an addicting gaming experience. I get why it's just not for you. It's no where close to their previous games for me, but I appreciate the experimenting with what this universe can be in the future ;).
---
I listen to my own music play list and play through the mic and say my char found a iPod..someone complains I play it out and say hey man to hell with you I found this damn thing and I am gonna listen to it!!
---
I do like just about everything here.  Especially the idea of locked in perks. My current character can do just about anything really well right now. I feel powerful. However there is no need to play with anyone the way it is right now.
---
What are your thoughts on faction gameplay?
---
Ya we really need this put into the game because it gets super annoying when I need to spend a ton of caps to get my gun back.
---
I definitely say this helps a lot. Did it myself and it worked wonders
---
Not surprised.
---
Instead of an 800 stash and being able to cart 1500 over your max, let's reverse that
---
I want a dog that follows me around fun
---
I have never heard that term before but I am stealing wankspangle.
---
equip enforcer, shoot at it until it lands. explosive ones help a lot.
---
On the side of the Watoga Civic Center there is a  fire escape , go up that to the roof and follow that across to the Watoga Transit Hub.  The Quest Marker activates tehre and takes you to an elevator on top of the Transit Hub that takes you to the Lobby.  That's as close as I am so far..
---
That really sucks. I do hope they help you all out with this. There are a lot of limiting factors when it comes to consoles. You can see this in any multiplatform game.
---
Yep. Consistently happens to me, in either xo1 or excavator using the Gatling plasma onxbox1
---
Did you actually think this through or did you just post it without the capability of weighing the options here?
---
All right, thank you.
---
or I keep finding either holo tapes or notes from people saying "if i die please take care of my cats " if I cannot have I dog I would take a cat to have wonder around my camp
---
I sit and wait, once she lands it’s over
---
I want a cat too
---
Ahh! Numbers!! It hurts my tiny brain! Make it STOP!! D:
---
It’s not really ghost weight. When you mod a weapon its weight increases visibly. And some of them increase it by a lot of weight.
---
One trip to Silva Homestead with green thumb, 160+ corn, 200+ razor grain. You can easily make a batch of 50 whiskey or bourbon
---
West Morgantown area has tons of mutifruit plants too
---
So you don't really need to grow much in your camp if you don't want to. Gourds maybe if you want Cranberry Relish to make the leveling challenges quicker, but gourds are one of the worst for levitating too.
---
Yet here you are playing away
---
I have a station on Pandora called “Swing Radio.” It plays music that fits right into the game, but has a lot more to it so I don’t have to listen to Butcher Pete 4 times in a single hour.
---
... You bought something, anything, for 100k caps?
---
I got bad news. Your high value item is going to be devalued regardless of the legendary vendor. As the game goes on and the meta changes, eventually your god tier set is going to be less god tier, and prices will drop accordingly, never mind when the people willing to pay 100k dwindles and the price drops in response to decreased demand.
---
You bought during a bubble, and here comes the needle. Sorry, dude/dudette/dudetrix/ect, but nothing in the future is going to make you happy about how much you paid. But hey, at least you wern't one of those poor suckers who paid real money for TSE weapons back in the day!
---
Honestly ever since they added the repair kits. Killing the queen has been a net gain for me. :)
---
You can’t buy anything good for caps.
---
I traded stuff that I got from trading stuff that I farmed.
---
But yeah, there’s always a power creep in games like this, I’m aware lol.
---
My favorite npc in the game. Sorry BIV.
---
To me it was ghost weight lol dint know where the extra poundage was coming from
---
It still won't be remotely full time viable. Consumption rate is way to high for how much you can make. It needs to be at least around 40. When it consumes 8 to 10 rounds per second, you need to be able to craft at least a magazines worth of ammo from the required materials.
---
Every weapon class has a weight reduction perk except rifles. It's bonkers that my already light pistol can have its weight reduced by 75% with a perk card, and my 19 pound gatling gun can be reduced to 90% of its original weight with a perk card, but something like a fully modded hunting rifle can easily weigh upwards of 12-15 weight.  
---
Not only that but for some of those weapons (melee and shotgun) you not only reduce the weight but also increase the swing speed (for melee) and reload speed (for shotguns) on the same perk card as the weight reduction perk.
---
I like to head to the overseers camp up near flatwoods to leave my known plans in the toolbox there  and as someone who does not have any heavy guns or energy guns  i tend to leave all the missiles, mini nukes, and various energy ammo in any cash registers that I find near traders. cause the with luck ammo perk card I am always swimming in ammo ( which I would love to sell to traders for caps btw bethesda if you are listening )
---
The problem really is the time and material investment for me. It's just not worth it.  So much faster and cheaper to hit up my secret spots and get 3* legendary enemies for the fast travel cost. 
---
They need to buff her loot pool and give her rare stuff to drop. The serums were cool. Maybe give her a chance to drop some named legendaries like the ones in survival. Idk
---
take my upvote. I needed this.... I still miss my vanguard ap wep reduction marine armor.
---
Pvp is garbage in this game anyway
---
Just walk away
---
Build one generator to power what you need to at work shops
---
Pointless making it pretty, everything vanishes when the servers rolling reset anyway
---
Fair enough, at least you know it's coming :)
---
Automatic. And if you get quad legendary even better :)
---
Maybe it could show medals and awards if you click on them through the map.
---
That's amazing! Especially considering you don't even have legendaries. Unless of course you have Stead Fast
---
Trade completed. Thank you for your business. Enjoy!
---
Nah. Just the standard army issue equipment.
---
the lower stash limit requires us to make choices. This is more real world.
---
It's pointless. Unless you have a lowbie, or a toon with no caps and no junk.
---
Yeah, it shouldn't be hard to make it so you're only hostile in the capture zone. I don't get it either.
---
When there is a challenge to take a specific workshop, I'll take it then immediately change servers.  Not a big fan of workshops after they changed them a month or two after release.
---
Saw him a couple of times at Whitespring, on a bonnet of red sports car in front of resort entrance. Spawned there for me the very first time I went to WS after installing the last patch.
---
My wife took my furious rolling pin for those days when I come home smelling of nukeshine
---
I think a certain mod adds that sound.
---
I think he got it before I even got on we were just building his house and then both of us just instantly died and then the guy of course started destroying his house before we could leave
---
You dont PvP but make a statement on a object that has obvious effect on PvP? Sounds like you're making a statement with no footing. The problem is that for some people, they're willing to shell out that money just so they can spam their TSE shotguns and never have to worry about being vulnerable. 
---
Even now, if you control a workshop, these people can come in, one shot you, and claim your work. The only real thing they have to worry about is when they're vulnerable due to their weapons breaking. Not to mention the possible future repercussions. They shouldn't be able to be purchased for real currency, they should have been rewards and craftable on-use items from the get-go. Not to mention the only source of them, Free Range, hasn't seemed to drop any of these repair kits for any of the people I have talked to, meaning their drop rate must be incredibly low.
---
Huh, What do you mean? What are some problems you see with the idea?
---
I have only met a couple of players who seek out pvp with lower level players.  The two times I remember being jumped by a bunch of other players, I just jumped to another server. One time I did encounter someone with a weapon similar to what you described, I remember the ground blowing up all around me and within a couple of seconds, I was dead.
---
I've actually met more players that would assist during combating a tough creature then wave hi after it's dead, then walk off.
---
Frustrating, but I see your point.  Thank you for the input.
---
\*Ahem\* Nerd here. The word you're looking for is "Libel".  
---
Carry on.
---
Changing servers is a solid idea to avoid the temptation to defend it, good call.
---
That's the unfortunate reality. Even if you are fully equipped, armored up, stim packs ready to go, weapons are opd in pvp. After one or two lost rounds, the payoff (other than pride) isn't worth it.
---
If you are on a team and the other person on the team tags a player. They can tag back and engage in pvp. Thus pacifist mode is irrelevant since one person on the team didn't have it. Also some events disable this, and allow anyone to freely pvp in them.
---
I expect to walk in with 1* wood armor and walk out with 1* wood armor
---
&gt; a lot more effort 
---
Yea, not really. A grand 8 adhesive, 12 steel, and a spring. Depends on the item of course, but still, it really isn't that difficult to get a handful of materials. The only time I'd bother using a repair kit would be in the field, like if an Excavator armor piece broke and I lost the carry weight bonus, which of course prevents me from fast traveling. If I know I'm not near a power armor station, then I might use it (it's pretty rare though to not be within 5 minutes of one, as there are so damn many of them). It would be an emergency use only item for me, but with even the most minor of preparation it's extraordinarily difficult to end up in a "no other option" situation. The only other way to use repair kits is if you're just plain lazy. None of the materials used for repairing are exceptionally difficult to get, and getting a decent pile of them isn't difficult either... you literally get them just by playing and by picking up at least some of what you come across. You have to actively avoid picking up anything to not have the required materials.
---
turrets wont retaliate until you hit back and initiate PVP with the other player/players...
---
No matter where you're at on the entire map, if someone tries to take your workshop, anyone on their team can kill you or anyone in your group. It's a stupid set up.
---
I do the same thing. But I leave stimpacks. If I see a low level at their camp, I'll drop some radx,radaway etc. Since I'm a higher level, I have more then enough, so I randomly share.
---
 Three-quarters of Reddit is assumptions based on photos. Yes I saw something in the photo that other people may have missed and posted it. I'm really not understanding what the hell's going on here...

Remove levels all together on survival mode. Maybe keep count of past bounty? And post users profile name at train station if constantly getting a bounty.

---
They need to rebalance junk and the economy as a whole. 
---
I honestly don't know what people will be buying or selling on their vendors right now. 
---
Imagine a real in-game economy and player vending? It would be amazing. But right now, everyone has a billion of everything if you're beyond level 40 or so. Without specialization, skills, or some other mechanism for consuming resources, there is no real in-game economy.
---
It wasn’t actually, it was obtained from constantly dropping and picking it up during the event
---
Excellent list!
---
To add my thoughts, I'd also love to see randomized drops across the inventory upon death. This way, you never pick a fight where you aren't willing to lose something good. PvP means more if both players have much to lose.
---
What gambling related microtransactions are in Fallout 76?
---
I could see why playing it though your mic might annoy others though, I have mine set to Push to Talk. 
---
If they are like me and you, and have their own source of additional audio you would end up stopping them being able to hear yours due to the music quality of hearing it go from Speaker to Mic back to Speaker. 
---
I'd end up muting you; and then you'd be mad when I don't respond to you talking to me. 
---
Imagine your on the bus after a hard days work and some 15 year old Chad is playing a terrible Rap Song he's wrote himself, on repeat, for the whole bus to hear. There's how people will view you in game, and it would be sad because I'm sure there is many awesome things about you.
---
Two Shot Authority? :p
---
I second this. ^ great idea for those people to contribute.
---
i'm not sure if they know i'm in the same boat as you bud havn't had a mire daily since around lvl 100 im 360 now
---
I want to start a bicycle gang, and ring our bells menacingly as we pass by people.
---
My point is everything being said ITT can be said for buying things from other players. You can get these items in game, and in fact the in game version is superior. 
---
As for workshops, no one is going to contest a Workshop without making sure their weapons and armor are ready to go. That'd be a stupid waste of time. 
---
I've already stated that I don't want the game to be P2W. I've said that I will continue to use the FREE, in game versions, but will never spend Atoms on them. You can argue it all you want, but you're arguing against points I've already said I don't agree with. 
---
However, what do you mean by "Not to mention the only source of them, Free Range,"? They drop from SBQ.  I've got 11 of the things and I've only had to fight SBQ 3 times to get that many. I guess if you're not interested in the SBQ, it'd be nice if it were the reward for other events, as well, and I'm all for that. But to say the drop rate is incredibly low is just not true.
---
I hope a can use tokens to buy more drills
---
It's so stupid and pathetic and just shows how shit they are and how scared they are to actually PvP in survival
---
How about like they did it in Fallout 3?
---
You aren't contributing to a conversation when you sum up the other person's point of view as "ranting".  I also never made fun of anyone. You might be projecting a bit with both of those claims. 
---
I hope you can learn that not everyone trying to talk to you is attacking you.
---
i found a 2\* tse comabt shotty :) bery nice find
---
Are you in a team with anyone at all?
---
You are an insufferable condescending douchebag. How does that come off?
---
It wasn't mentioned in this "inside the vault" but was in the past.
---
Big chill until it lands then light it up. Another strat might be to try and cripple its wings
---
Exactly! Feels very Destiny-ish!
---
Probably because of how many times the word "caps" was used. Lol. Just my guess
---
You should definitely give a listen to "Eragon" and "A Song of Ice and Fire"
---
You may want to run. Lol
---
Thank you, much appreciated
---
Slap damage doesn’t even exist anymor
---
You mean make it so you don't gain experience and levels at all?
---
I love stashbox camps. So brutalist. So functional.
---
Correction for your very bad grammar: Yes. It is worth it.
---
**They need to rebalance weapon damage, rate of fire, DR, and health pools for everything.**
---
The game has been out long enough that they can understand power curves and common specs, and make a lot more weapons or combinations viable. 
---
**They also need to rebalance junk and the economy as a whole.** 
---
Imagine a real in-game economy and player vending? It would be amazing. But right now, everyone has a billion of everything if you're beyond level 40 or so. Without specialization, skills, or some other mechanism for consuming resources, there is no real in-game economy. 
---
So much more is possible with the game by planning out weapon values or tweaking back end economics that would totally enrich the game!
---
Nah doesn’t bother me if they mute me 😂
---
New Gad tea party time
---
Maybe the Quantum and Hullicigen (I think) are making you high and so you see that stuff as floating. :p
---
I didn't even use psycho imagine then
---
Ah .. so if I see a douche bag players with it, can I report him :) ?
---
If you don't want to repair it, simply re-place you camp for the caps. You get everything bluprinted with nothing lost. :). Also camp immunity comes next update! Yay!
---
Then in the 4 times I killed her this week, she refused to drop them, on any of my characters, womp womp, and by F2W do you mean Free to Win? Because that means everyone has an equal chance regardless of how much money they throw at the game, Pay to Win, is the issue, P2W. 
---
In all honesty, I support the idea of these kits, but they really didnt need to add them to the atomic shop, and its idiotic they did. It would have been better for them to be something youd craft like back in New Vegas, with a combination wrench, duct tape, screwdriver, and etc. It seems like they're just using them as a way to supplement an influx of atoms so they dont need to keep working on quality items for the atomic shop, which is something that is already hit or miss, with all the cruddy reskins with the few actually unique and interesting items like the new Horseman paintjobs and the Bone Raider skin.
---
I'd recommend changing either Iron First or Incisor for Barbarian.
---
Shrek: *Heavy breathing*
---
I'm expecting to dump about 20 or 30 assorted low-star items and walk out with only one legendary weapon of mixed quality.  It might not be great, but my stash space will be happy to finally be cleared up.
---
Hmmm...gonna have to slow down my nukashine consumption I guess.
---
A similar post has been posted about this before. It does seem to be a popular enough idea for them to implement. :)
---
What if you had no arms though? Then it really would be quite challenging.
---
Agreed, I used to be like you, haha
---
Then I became allllll efficiency
---
I leave the creativity and prettying to my camp space
---
If it makes you feel better, filling it with all that stuff, they had to pay a lot to claim it off you, lol
---
Her name.  She's a she.
---
This seems kind of reactionary...   
---
Bethesda seems to Implement things in waves, I be willing to wager the vendor is going to come out with some basic options, and get its ability expanded over time as they figure out the balance.
---
I change servers aftrr I have taken the workshop for a challenge too - it also means it is free for other players to just grab it and go.
---
Did you get it yet? I'm at level 68 and have never seen the card.. ;-)
---
"Where hard work and dedication doesn't always pay off" sounds just like my life. ;)
---
I submitted a ticket for this so I guess they know now? Maybe I'll get a reply.
---
I always squeeze off a round after reloading because of this.
---
Awwwwww.....😢
---
Going to try to join on you
---
There is a mod for this. But I do believe they are working on a solution.
---
Moving used to be a fix for invisible wires taking up your camp budget but not being deletable
---
That was fixed apparently
---
Moving shouldn’t do squat anymore
---
I know someone with a Quad Automatic Legendary Tesla Rifle and ZOMG! Absolute shop wrecker.
---
Yeah, some more budget for decorations would be really nice. 
---
I've never noticed my budget changing, and I'm level 123 and have moved numerous times. They've recently made certain things like lights and turrets take less space, which was really nice, as now I can finally afford a turret lol. 
---
Do you have a brahmin, or a tamed creature? They can be pretty budget expensive. Things like water purifiers are also kinda budget hogs.
---
People get off on it. I feel ya.
---
Yeah, I honestly cannot understand why they think their loot table is satisfying or good for players and the longevity of the game.
---
It's not better to reroll. That's highly inefficient. A post 50 char means a char that already has plenty of cards unlocked. You are also better geared to farm exp at a much faster pace. All your cards are unlocked so there are no gating.
---
It doesn't specify if monsters can damage it though. I forsee a new griefing system.  Lure monsters to a camp and let them do it. Hopefully not
---
It's a skinner box. Only an idiot would fail to realize that
---
Yes
---
That Abe looks badass, but... I feel like the civil war top hat is almost a bit too big for the head.
---
Give it a few months and Zenimax will monetize this like they did with ESO. Players can pay for an unlimited separate “junk” storage bag.
---
I don't remember where I saw this but each power armor paint job has a unique sound of some sort, maybe that might be it.
---
PS4, noticed it as well for a while. Got the center of my base around an extractor on one of my characters and if a player jumps in they can’t get out so I’ve tried placing like 4 signs. They also clip through on Metal Walls too, so, there’s that.
---
Lol I never gave any numbers out or said there name. I just point out that you need to be care full of what you say on a hot mic. How is that harassing some.
---
I'll save you the trouble: [https://imgur.com/a/6l2S04c](https://imgur.com/a/6l2S04c) 
---
Level 50 Protectrons have 115 DR and 375 HP. You'd expect 158 HP damage per shot if it was a single-projectile weapon with 247 paper damage and no armor penetration. That matches perfectly with the \~42% of the HP bar. Hence the damage for the eight pellets is combined before the DR calc.
---
Fun thing from that test: The second shot finished it off. I'm not whether I accidentally hit a weak spot or Tenderizer stacks per pellet.
---
Great points! I would like to add a rework of the death, respawn and fast travel mechanics to this list.
---
I was wondering if they changed it at all. Good to know and thanks for the reply.
---
No I don't even know how to get one at my camp. Would be kinda cool though. I only have 1 purifier and I think 2 turrets. Theres usually scorched or mole rats around the camp once an hour so it's necessary to have them; although I may need more. These days, I think with the changes to survival, alot of people have come back to adventure to mess with people. My camp either gets completely obliterated or attacked by people playing AT LEAST once or twice a day.. But that's another post I have to make.
---
Do you just mean server hopping to get more enemies after you've killed them all at a good spot?
---
The issue of level balance and damage are already being worked on with the damage normalisation system, it still needs a lot of tweaking but I don't see that as being as much of an issue as you describe.
---
Things like this make me super happy camp immunity is coming next update. :)
---
I don't know about your luck but everyone else I've seen remark having them got them from the SBQ. I didn't even realize I had gotten them until I noticed the repair option in my Pipboy.  I was totally surprised to realize I had 11 of them, and even more pleased to realize the ones in game do more repair than the Atom ones. 
---
As to your confusion about F2W, yes, I meant P2W, hence how it says P2W in my latest post that you just replied to. I realize I did earlier say the wrong thing, my bad. 
---
 I actually paid for Atoms the other day when I was able to do 3 SBQs in a row without any server issues, because to me that means they've really been working on the stability of the game and are "deserving" of some positive feedback. I got a variety of things I'd been looking at in the shop, and feel pretty good about the general direction of the game.  
---
I do not like "usable" items being in the Atom shop, but the ease (for me at least and I'm not even a particularly powerful character) of getting them in game means I'll never be even remotely tempted to buy them from the Atom shop.
---
Who else is slightly concerned that teddy bears are not mentioned as a collectible for the display case?
---
I would sell my first born for a bloodied explosive gatling. Jk. But seriously, he's 10 and plays well with other kids.
---
Do we know if the tokens can be traded between players? if they can, they might become a new form of currency
---
Yes this is a must, getting tired of wasting extra time so Bethesda can show me option to use repair kits.
---
Laser durability still sucks, why no love for laser? Those are very nice looking weapons and nowhere as OP as other weapons but you don’t want people to use them. I’ve seen more people using cryolator than laser guns.
---
I regularly drop anything I don't want into the register in the crafting section of whitesprings, like legendaries that are "okay" but not my playstyle, apre plans, ammo, and so on.
---
I would go as far as dropping everything on death. I know it seems crazily punitive but I think it would work.
---
Fuck me , i actually bothered going there and we killed it. Did not find the body. Thanks for the tip
---
This made me lol
---
Should be addressed in the patch next week. Outside of survival, camps should be invulnerable
---
No worries mate, basically any info you look up, if it’s older than a month, likely had changes made
---
I'm honestly dumbfounded that it isn't in the game already. I don't think there's a multiplayer game on PC that I know of at least, that doesn't offer some form of in-game text communication except Fallout 76. 
---
There's so many occasions it would've come in handy. Yeah you can still use a headset but more options is better than just one. There's plenty of reasons people can't or don't use headsets. And there's only so many ways you can vaguely communicate with emotes.
---
(EDIT: Bethesda could even tie an emote into using text chat. Say you hit whatever key it is to start typing, your character brings up his/her Pip Boy or maybe a random typewriter and starts to fiddle with it as if typing while an emote icon hovers above them. That way people will know if someone is typing)
---
Yes! That's what I was referring to. I was hoping that was showing up on the horizon.
---
Being from New York I forget things like these poster walls are stuff that's not common everywhere. Love how you did it here!
---
When I first had it out I felt it was nice and peaceful, now months later, I find it annoying and tend to go shut it off lol I just like how it look so I have it around but ugh Everytime i fast travel to my camp ugh
---
This is why I name my stuff "My (thing)" or in the case of my explosive minigun "DON'T SELL THIS"
---
Great feedback. I would play survival if most of what you layed out was implemented.
---
Yeah, that's how DayZ did it, but I can't help but think that would drive off all but the most committed survivalists.
---
I'd like it, I just don't think many others would. But, I'd love to be proven wrong on that!
---
It needs to have more sound tracks, for example option to switch between the 2 radio stations in game and maybe some unique soundtrack to the jukebox other than the one it has currently
---
I'd love it if they'd fix the heart of the enemy "daily" quest that never seems to actually reset.
---
Make sweet love to the molewoman for legendary deals
---
I was selling drinks for 100c each except tequila that needs Flux. 100c isn't high and letting you get some profit.[PC]
---
I haven't heard that sound but whenever I fall from a high place when I land in PA, I now hear an alien static-y type noise
---
So can we provide universal healthcare with that 10% tax? Appa-latch-ee-uh care for all! (Yes, you have to pronounce it like the vendorbot or you aren’t eligible!)
---
It's under resources, next to water. 
---
Then I dunno. Unless your 1 story is like, the entire size of the CAMP circle, you should have room for some decorations. Do you have stuff in stored or something maybe? Could be a bug, too. Can you post a screenshot of your base?
---
Are you on console? I hear griefers are worse there.
---
This also happens with Gatling Lasers, which can be annoying when it chews through precious fusion cores.
---
Never mind asshole shot it
---
Or drink more! Maybe you'll start to have telekinetic powers!
---
While I do agree that a lock system would be smart, like making a favorited item locked would have been the easiest route.. with the current mechanic you can't accidentally spam sell something favorited because it reverses the confirm / cancel buttons, which was clearly done with spam selling in mind.
---
It's different than other games and if they just made a lock feature I'd be cool with it but I don't get how anyone accidentally sells the wrong thing with how it currently works.
---
I’m sorry how is that bad grammar? 😂 fuck outta here
---
Since the changes to survival, all the aholes are coming back and trying to destroy other people's livelihood in adventure. At the end of the day I've learned you need to be prepared for anything. Get yourself some descent armor and at least 1 good weapon. Set up your perks for that weapon and you may have a chance. Keep in mind that they can destroy your entire camp without you being notified, and only get a 5 cap bounty. When you go to your camp they will try to kill you and get alot more caps if you retaliate. That seems to be the new thing for losers to do these days.
---
At least they’re upvoting you haha
---
you have plague mutation right? quit hurting that brahmin
---
Yep ps4. I do have decorations and things inside I'd just like the option to put more. I haven't checked stored in a while. I'll have to double check that. Thanks
---
Yes. A thousand times yes.
---
Cept legendaries can't be scrapped...?
---
&gt; Is walking away always the correct choice if you're not fully geared for PvP? 
---
You're lucky if you have that option. Normally the PvPers will either wait until you're at the workshop before contesting it, or kill you anywhere on the map by having a team-mate contest it. They're typically not interested in the workshop itself, and often won't bother completing the takeover once they have your caps.
---
For what it's worth, a dense torso mod and 2-3 points of Fireproof will give you almost complete protection from the explosive part of an attack. Also works against scorchbeast sonic blasts. If you fight someone with assassin/sentinel armor then you're just throwing away caps though.
---
I've always thought a Fallout/DayZ hybrid type game would be amazing, it kills me that we are so close... I need this dream to be realised.. please Todd.. please.
---
It’s really just another way for them to just get ppl who are too lazy to work to get resources to spend money to buy a kit to do it all for them..
---
I'd say that something you may need to take up with Microsoft if you can't save more images on the console.
---
Good luck, I've only seen arm plans for sale once, and can't figure out where they spawn in game.
---
Seriously! I would be in love, but I know many people wouldn't like that style of game. If would be nice to just have it as an option, though.
---
You are a bad , bad man,.. quit touching those Brahmins teets,..
---
.556 is highly coveted too.
---
It seems we are unfamiliar with sarcasm and I shall close the register at this point.
---
Console?? Lol
---
Does it need the hat...? Or just the jumpsuit thing that is everywhere
---
Creepy
---
It gets the point across
---
Bethesda forgot to put raider armor plans in any of the world spawn, vendor or daily/event reward lists. The only quest that can drop them is Signal Strength. So you get one plan ever. If you're lucky.
---
Are you on PC? I'll buy that lobbing tesla from you for cheap if not legendary. I want to do some tests with the lobbing variant but can not for the life of me get the dam thing learned by scrapping them.
---
(PS4 but what’s the difference now days) 
---
It’s not that you can’t save more images on the console. There isn’t a screen cap limit. There is a hard limit on photographs you can take and since fallout 76 only pulls from the photo gallery in game rather than stuff saved on the hard drive of your system (like screen caps) and seems to only save your photographs to that same save data that’s obligatory to Fallout 76 itself rather than just your remaining hard drive space it causes issues with how much your able to do with the photography system. The limiting factor being Fallout. 
---
I’m tracking how simple computers work, jumped out of the PC scene like 8yrs ago when it stopped being worth the money put in.
---
Im not either on the fanboy most liked list lol , i'll upvote you
---
I'm sorry, I think I misread your OP. I thought you had just the basic structure and no decorations. You've probably just hit the limit, which I agree is waaaay too small. Hopefully you can find some wiggle room in your stored, though.
---
&gt; I just point out that you need to be care full of what you say on a hot mic
---
I don't even have a mic, so no I don't. You really need to figure out what you means. I don't understand how you can mistake it since you clearly use it right way yourself, too.
---
Hopping on now, hopefully we get more.
---
It’s in the road map if I remember well for the Nuclear Winter dlc or about that time. Check BS official site.
---
Reminds me of a teenage romance flick. Set in a post apocalyptic backdrop, finding love in the unlikeliest of places is the tale of two sweethearts. You've got some poetic writing skills! Well done.
---
My problem has never been that they spawn inside. Its the annoying fact that I've seen them open a level 3 locked door and waltz right in.
---
You can Make flamers then scrap them and you get 500 each time with scrapper perk
---
I’ll never use it, but I’m not arrogant enough to presume I speak for everyone. Something a lot of entitled dickheads on this sub do, like you.
---
I noticed this tonight when I almost sold one of mine...it caught my attention and saved me from selling my favorite Axe.
---
So looking forward to this... but it would be amazing if we could also add basic items we're looking to buy with prices.  I'll beat any vendors price on plain Nuka Colas, and pay top dollar for holotape games I don't have yet.  This could turn into "content" for players to fetch wanted items for others.
---
This would be very helpful
---
Mb pc and I think jumpsuit or the outfit that spawns ingame works.
---
If you are not specced for auto I actually like the standard over the charging variant. The charging I believe only holds 8 rounds versus the semi's 15. Between having to charge it for full damage and less shots between reloading I "feel" the semi does better dps.
---
Why? Gild him for speaking for the entire community? Are you children? I don’t buy for a second you’re a job working adult and you don’t notice how ridiculously entitled this post sounds. It’s because of toxic shit like this no one takes 76 subs seriously.
---
Watoga station sells light, sturdy and heavy.
---
Sturdy i have seen the most but theres a heavy plan for sale occasionally
---
very helpful to casuals and people who wanna get concrete numbers on how many shots it takes before your weapon degrades with and without the weapon artisan upgrade.
---
Still need more?
---
There is a HUD warning when the weapon hits something like 10%, a red gun icon along with other icons (mutation, food, etc).
---
They did, and there’s been nothing indicating that it will be a thing. I don’t think it’s going to happen either. 
---
OP asked what people would think if it happened, so I answered. I love the game, but that would be a bridge too far for me.
---
They get a 5cap bounty per destroyed piece of your camp that you can collect not a 5cap bounty for the whole base.
---
Yeah the problem is this, like when tame a deathclaw it always becomes lv 21, when you tame an attack dog it always becomes lv 1 and a strong gust of wind kills it.
---
This i kind of a vague answer but just watch a few build tutorials on youtube and just play how you have to most fun
---
No, no, no.
---
How about everyone just plugs in a mic and starts using it. How simple is that?
---
:( rip I wish the doggo could follow you around too
---
Correct, their is that as well just to warn you about it almost breaking. Having that along with the cnd bar on your hud will help you see how soon the weapon will break since it takes a few more shots till it properly breaks.
---
500 copper scraps. My tesla had ammo for a week. :-)
---
For suggesting they should reimplement the original repair UI/process? I don’t see the toxicity :/ maybe I’m tone deaf here but it just seemed like a good idea? I don’t see where the toxicity is in THIS post but I’m sorry you feel that way.
---
Yes especially before you have rank 5 of gunsmith, weapons tend to break at the worst moment possible
---
Or just store things you don't want seen in stash. Once vending opens up next week, you won't have to worry about it anyways unless you continue to manually trade.
---
I would LOVE to ask if anyone on wants to quest or whatnot. It’s a MMO, I want ppl to chat with.
---
yes this please
---
That "fireproof" idea is a solid one to work towards, thank you for that
---

Just stopping by on this 5 month old post to show the solution because I came across this issue too and found it.  [https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/164592-fallout-4/73578150](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/164592-fallout-4/73578150)

Found the fallout 4 guide, still applies to 76.
---
I noticed a few SBQs ago that she'd sometimes just go right through the ground, then after a bit pop out somewhere. Kinda like a magic trick.
---
Fast travell to the the burning mine seems to work wonders

Eh, maybe I don’t want open world chat.

Maybe you’re yanking on the bull and not the cow. They have to reproduce somehow.

   I don't know much about him, He seems very mission oriented and always doing or going somewhere. cannot seem to sit still for very long, doesn't socialize much. seems to avoid most sources of communication but seems friendly when approached in the field.
---
Thanks!
---
It's because they use that high damage output to overkill other players, instead of raid bosses.
---
I was literally 1 shot whilst in pacifist mode today by a guy using a buzzblade. 
---
It's not that they're wrong for playing the game, it's that they're wrong for exploiting game mechanics to grief other players.
---
😁
---
If you are taking a workshop you are warned that you can be pvped. Dont like it? dont take work shops it's that simple. Everything found at workshops can be farmed elsewhere without the risk. As to defending against higher geared players you could consider using a rifle build with a vats crit +50% rifle and a Chameleon piece of armour for these instances. And be aware that if you kill them once and then leave the server you'll have robbed them of what they seek and you can be sure they will be upset as you go your merry way.
---
Are you on PC? I think I saw you sitting at one of the train stations and was gonna ask what you were wearing. Wasn't till the next day I realized it was a raider chest piece.
---
Farm Southwest of Harper's ferry
---
If you had a gramy character that would be gold...... Perspective is key just cause its not good for you doesnt mean its not good for someone else and yea it happens kinda like how i got disconected during the Cryptid event thats 2000 caps im not getting back.
---
you are downvoted but you are correct. this is how it always start. the least offensive addition added to the options of things you can buy, then add more things to this slippery slope. anyone whose been through a few online games with the microtransaction model will recognize this pattern.
---
the point that it's free or whatever doesn't relate to their promise that they wouldn't introduce "pay to win" (which, frankly, could be anything). personally i don't mind these aspects - if i can get things in-game, and others choose to buy them with real money, then good; i'm not concerned about it being "imbalanced" or unfair.
---
but bethesda are walking back on their promise. the above points of other users does none of addressing that.
---
Likely adrenaline reaction, or are coated in something that when exposed to stress gets stronger. Who knows.  
---
Though for many legendary effects the idea can still fit especially the armor ones.  I mean all unyelding is, is reactive armor.
---
With cripple perks it will fall to the ground with the same animation as a crippled deathclaw. Super easy to fight when it just lays there beating the ground uselessly cause it can't get up.
---
Its a hassle taking stuff out just to trade ,regardless I believe ppl will continue to Manually trade as it is they get better advertisement on fb/reddit  .we don’t know much about the player vendor not to mention manually trading is tax free .
---
It took me a while to come up with a system that worked for me. I kept track of what I used the most and least, then set a number for each piece of scrap. Example:  25 Bones, 50 circuits, 150 screws, 200 steel, etc. So when I scrap a bunch of stuff I’ll quickly run down my list of junk and pull out whatever goes over that number. It only takes me a few minutes now since I’ve been doing it for a while now. I won’t keep weapons or armor I won’t use.  I still get full and it’s usually because I haven’t paid attention to my junk, but it takes no more than 5 minutes to clean it up.  I try to leave myself atleast 100 lbs to play with in case I need it.
---
100 lbs is 45.4 kg
---
same but PS4 :/
---
It'd be nice to have an incentive to keep leveling a character after level 50.
---
Can't wait for the prestige system.  Hope it's worth it.
---
I'm a retired guy. I do play often, usually daily. My level is 126 and still learning.
---
I thought the lack of text chat on PC was a really dumb decision at launch. But I've been playing some other online games again lately and realized it's actually better not hearing the thoughts of random people in games like this. 
---
It's mostly just used like a chat room to talk politics or other stuff that has nothing to do with the actual playing of the game. Then when people are talking about the game it's usually just to talk shit about how bad everyone else is or how great they are. Very little is actual useful and needed communication about playing the game.
---
That's not necessarily a reason not to have it and you could always turn the chat off, but I think they wanted to avoid the toxicity that comes with text chats. They should have went with more of a tactical Arma style communication with the emotes though and it wouldn't be an issue that sometimes you can't use voice chat.
---
Also, not saying there's not toxicity with voice chat. I've met the 13 year olds kids on PS4. But in my experience, when you're just chatting with a random person locally in this game instead of being in a Call of Duty lobby or something then they're usually fairly polite and friendly. I've never come across someone using the voice chat in an abusive way in this game specifically.
---
Aww. Sorry man!  Yeah, my normal people still play on occasion, but not nearly as much as I would like!
---
But thats would defeat the grind.
---
We would have everything already if that was the case.
---
Okay, well Jaxx1231 is my gt, add me!
---
Sunday Brother’s?
---
AND for the inevitable duplication exploits and server instability it introduces, because there is a 0% chance this gets implemented without major exploits that will take months to fix.
---
That's the one
---
Brotherhood vendors will have them. Play the ol hop server event and you'll eventually find them.
---
I dropped my all rise in a SBQ battle :( it didn’t stick around.
---
Thank you!
---
Okay, will do tomorrow. What time or day (s) are you on?
---
It's also one more headache for developers to moderate and ensure measures are available for stemming any bullying or nasty crap. They did a lot to make sure the game had a friendly environment online, which is kinda rare, and I can understand why chat would have been a distraction early on. Or maybe I'm reading it wrong.
---
Well I work from home, so I make my schedule. So anytime. Just lemme know.

Mine was a vampire swing speed +1 end pick axe....but it just went poof.... When it wasnt on my favorites wheel i almost cried. Also i am sorry your loss.

I switched to a radio for just that reason. Looks good on my bar rail too. 🙂

Mine usually throws a kick if I click"milk" from to near its rump.

Thanks, i got already one from lovely person &lt;3

Hahaha gg

As soon as I can use push-to-talk with a controller, I will.
---
Are you guys farming her? I could send 3 nukes if you help me kill that monster.
---
120K!? geez. I'm rich!  I have several gat lasers, some 3 star ones too (forgot what effect). 120K must be fore a \*\*\* explosive, bloodied, or something highly desired.
---
Hi rich, I'm dad!
---
You launch the nukes and we help kill her?
---
Yeah there is, but you have to open pipboy to look how much longer it will last, this is good sugestion.
---
Hydraulics?
---
Treasure maps. I have some plans to craft every armor. But only some parts. 550hours in. I belive i used only about 50maps tho. It gives even super rare plans.
---
I don't remember. How did workshops change after release?
---
It took a while, but I finally got the White Russian recipe.. and after that, I've not received any new recipes I've not known.. So I do hope they rectify this issue at some point.
---
Alas, Babylon. The audiobook is excellently narrated by Will Patton, and thematically spot on. A small Florida community deals with the aftermath of a nuclear war.
---
Many are over encumbered. West Tech is a place to farm. Many of us use calibrated shocks on our armor to increase the carry weight.
---
People "lose" items because of **misclicks**....not because the game is secretly, randomly selecting users to delete their items.
---
Bethesda, we will never use repair kits.
---
I agree! Dogs have been by our side for 30,000 ..  an atomic bomb cannot compare to the power of friendship with DOG
---
Very kewl 👍
---
Ye
---
Ah, so you're the one who crashed all the servers. Probably the very same guy that one-shots all the legendaries before anyone gets to them.
---
I’ve swapped to radios because I prefer Appalachia Radio, and I always turn all five of them on when I go to my camp. When I had the Jukebox I still enjoyed it, rarely turned off the classical, granted I played piano as a kid
---
Sure, join me add TrainerSeb on psn we are launching a queen rn and then we are gonna server hop and you can launch 3 more if you so please
---
&gt; so we have to server hop and server hop and server hop and go back day after day after day until we finally (FINALLY)
---
You don't have to do that if it's so tedious. How about just check in when you feel like it, or are in the area. I don't get why you'd make the game a grind if you don't enjoy it.
---
Yeah and it's only going to get worse. Once camps are indestructible workshops are going to be the only way for griefers to grief.
---
I think this is being taken to seriously. Its a game, shoot, loot, sell, pillage, have fun, blow shit up... Economics, economy tracking and taxing?? I mean come on; let a game be a game.
---
I only ever did then to get plans but not anymore since people have to be so pathetic
---
Lost two of my best weapons. Just got back one --  same level/effect gatling I lost (only \*) but the other was a \*\* MG42... THAT one I'm really upset about losing.  And I've lost 2 calibrated shock legs for my excavator this week alone.  That wiped out my screw reserve and took some of my flux reserve... not to mention leaving me walking to the nearest power armor station to craft a new leg(s).  I now carry an extra PA in inventory in case this happens again.  I hope the PA doesn't vanish!
---
This seems unsafe. Are there any downsides?
---
Often times I'll see a technical data on the ground in wierd places. I cant pick it. Like its glued to the ground or somthing.
---
I'd like a 🐈 or 2.
---
True story?
---
The truest of the stories!
---
Yea we shouldn't be taxed like this. Especially when serum recipes cost 25k caps each.
---
What do you feel sucks about it?
---
I have a mic. I've never heard another person speak. I've tried talking and people ignore me. I don't think it works. Tried on 2 PCs.
---
Awesome. Glad some justice is done to players who live to grief camps. Bravo!
---
Without those taxes, how will we pay to keep repairing the whitesprings though? Cleaning up nuclear fallout is expensive work, you know.
---
that's not really as dumb as you would think I used to play game called ARK and you could build a toilet and crap in it and turn that into fertilizer for your plants
---
no re rolling just hoping that the vender has something good for sale. Many myself included were hoping for re rolls because it would allow you to take the crappy 3* items and make them into something.
---
This guy will probably sell basic nocturnal shit that nobody wants.
---
Bobblehead stand from Fallout 3?  Why not Fallout 4, considering pretty much all of the other art assets are from 4.
---
The keywords are if the "turrets are not hostile". If a player wants to initiate PVP all they have to do is shoot at the turrets. Hopefully, I'm very wrong.
---
They are in misc
---
no it wouldnt! the legendary bug boss of the game should at least give the best tier loot.  like atleast 3\*
---
not that i am carry that much weapons or armor... add pockets or deep pockets to your armor, 15 points in strength and use perks like solar powered, radicool, scattershot, strong back and the marsupial mutation. 
---
See [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to find out what fits best to you.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping this makes it in sooner or later, on consoles as well. It makes it so much easier to arrange trades, group up for activities, etc. And for those who aren't interested in text chat, every game I've played that includes it also includes the option to hide chat.
---
100 at least.
---
I have 18 and it pisses me off
---
A lot of the hardcore farmers offload their excess loot on secondary characters, sometimes even buying a second account to facilitate easy item transfers. 
---
Whitesprings is the go-to for farming a ton of garbage legendaries, but players looking for decent three star loot will farm places like West-Tek or events like Encryptid or Scorched Earth.
---
you get quantity of legendaries not quality
---
Find Yao Gui to murder
---
(The zombie bears)
---
Hahahahaha. Gun is an alcoholic.
---
God, for real. This would be such happiness.
---
So you also understand how there needs to be *massive* caps sinks for that to happen. This is a step in the right direction of fixing the economy but in actuality there needs to be dozens of little taxing transactions like this all across. 
---
They should mean something. But currently, and until there's something worth spending them on, they won't. Trades for trades, that's where we are. And while 10% will bring player trading into a more casual audience, it won't fix the (larger than) 1% internet trading has created, which unfortunately is the majority of traders available now and when this feature becomes available. 
---
You'll still only get garbage gear from traders. Because caps don't matter.
---
My interpretation is they're going to implement it in a way where a player has to initiate PVP with you before your turrets become hostile to an attacker and until then, the turrets remain on standby and take no damage like the rest of the C.A.M.P. That's the most logical approach for Bethesda to take.
---
Yea happened to me a few times, really hate they would have something like that especially when it takes 1min to turn it off and in that time you dead 6 times over.
---
Makes a lot of sense to me.
---
Well it did happen. You can stick your head in the sand all you want. Think I'll stick around a little longer.
---
This is true.
---
Yet another online douchebag. :)
---
There’s a workshop up near the top with three acid nodes. Claim it and place extractors.
---
I cannot seem to take the last photo in the galleria. The goal location spot is 10 high but I can't get the camera to acknowledge that there is an attraction there.
---
Yet another online douchebag. :)  I only said he was an ass after he started making an ass out of himself.
---
There is a vein past hemlock holes heading east.
---
i did the same with an explosive handmade, gun disappeared from their inventory a few seconds later thankfully
---
That was the whole point of the post... not using the workshop cause it gets contested, or it attracts griefers.
---
That workshop is Hemlock Holes Maintenance, which OP was referring to.
---
You literally were attacking someone online because of their comment.  If you dont think the 'oh boo hoo' in the context of the rest of your post is not making fun of people and an attack then you are just simply rude and oblivious about your lack of social skills.  Every single time I make this point about repair kits, or something else critical of Bethesda, there are people doing the whole "oh boo hoo" thing and calling us whiners.  It is immature and makes me think you guys are kids.
---
Although it is unpopular I think people should stand up and tell people when they are being rude.  Just trying to be helpful.
---
Why do they need to reiterate something they have already announced in the past? That's just wasting space in their articles. Also Inside the the Vault is just a brief overview of what's to come, it's not a comprehensive patch notes which doesn't get released until the update.
---
Yes please.
---
I carry like 15 guns just get weight reduction armor and bear arms goes along way
---
Maybe I've been lucky, or maybe it's just the time of day I play, but I've never been contested there. If you're on Xbox, I'd be happy to try to help you defend it. I can't promise success, but I can guarantee I'll do my best.
---
I use my excavator armor and make sure to logout in it. Logging in I have roughy 545 carry weight. I'm rarely overencumbered though
---
VATS cost is affected by the weight of the weapon. So, technically yes. The shorter barrels reduce weight a bit, reducing AP cost of VATS in turn.
---
Also makes for a grand photo with the new camera: [https://i.imgur.com/A2u1K59.png](https://i.imgur.com/A2u1K59.png)
---
Perks legendary effects i have weapon, ammo, chems, food and junk -20% some doubled so i dont need perks for those set weight classes unless it beats it like "thru hiker 3*" which i always have on plus martial artist reduceing melee more with 20% still commimg off my guns and what not. 
---
Also seen a seen a sub on here about un-moding or adding light weightmods stored guns and armor you dont use Great tip just make sure its not rare modsyou taking off 👍
---
Hope that helps.
---
Never questioned or doubted your knowledge of the game, I'm sure you know quite a bit. Perhaps even more than me. I would certainly like to know the best way to gear if you would look pass our differences. 
---
What's in question is your assumed belief that "hard work" in context of a video game is a well defined, understood concept. And your belief that the legendary vendor invalidates the time you spent or the worth of your gear. And that obtaining a legendary from the vendor won't be as "difficult." 
---
We know we break down legendaries for scrip, and use that to buy new ones. But we don't know the exchange rate, how the stock of the vendor is decided, how the stock is rotated, or the quality of the legendaries that are sold.
---
I completely missed that. My bad.
---
It’s just the skylight. Just stand below it, aim up, and click. At least that worked for me on 2 characters
---
i am also concerned with this as well, i recently for months now have had my camp outside the whitespring golf course however ive grown tired of the continuous rapid fire from all of my overpowering the high level ghouls, so now im looking for a more peaceful alternative with a view, so any suggestions, preferably on a cliff side would be nice
---
It’s been patched but if you used it to store loads of different items you got terrible lag from it, however if you used it as I did to store the same items (broken down junk) then you were alright because of the way the game keeps track of items.
---
That and also the stash is still capped at 800 so I can’t put anything into it, my old main is now my mule lol
---
My GT is Davolicious, and I'm...well, let's say I'm no spring chicken. If I'm available, I'm always happy to group up and help out with whatever I can.
---
Haha okay!
---
I didn't attack anyone. If someone saying "boo hoo" freaks you out this much you should check out when people tell each other to go fuck themselves. 
---
You going on and on about boo hoo is silly, considering you have said  I'm "ranting", "wallowing", "making an ass of" myself. All of which are a lot ruder than "boo hoo".
---
Yeah, there is no replayability because we don't get a choice in the quest. Pick this or that or you won't progress. Would be nice to get a quest where we got to decide the outcome.
---
Doesn't explain legendaries though.
---
Here, for your whole “it’s part of the region’s history” argument that you wanted to make.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly
---
Sure it does. If you're dropping items you're not intending to why wouldn't it impact a legendary?
---
It’s a great idea until you find out what happens when you use human poo for fertilizer. Maybe thats just what happens in North Korea and people who aren’t already riddled with parasites won’t make such a terrible fertilizer, who knows
---
Concentrated fire and enforcer. Rank 1 of each works. Shoot the wings until it's crippled. It lands very soon after. 100% easiest way to kill them imo
---
Its only explosive ones
---
I want a attack cat and a nice cat who eats spaghetti
---
I agree. I think you should be able to scrap Legendaries(I think this is a thing, just haven't played in over a month.) and gain 1 mod from it if it has more than 1 mod on it. Then you can attach it to another but must have a free slot(1 slot for each level) or it erases that mod.    
---
To upgrade you need a list of items.    
---
Level 2 isn't too hard to get, 3, a bit harder, and then 4 and 5 require more items and even a mission and a unique item from a named enemy.
---
That would be really nice. Until then, hopefully the legendary vendor makes it a bit easier to get the good stuff.
---
No you need the prime handmade receiver to unlock the ultracite ammo
---
agree +1
---
Oh my, what happened to mister sensitive snowflake? Really, you calling out others for being "mean" and insulting and then you go and do it...which also makes you a hypocrite.  Congrats,  you win.
---
Thanks! I also got the bar set
---
Nope. Those sounds when moving or landing come with the Nukashine paintjob itself :)
---
12 slots on the wheel. That's all you can mark as favorites.
---
Crevasse Dam. After you wipe out the supers head into the lake near thunder Mountain. There's a group of blood bugs that spawn in the water. Near them is a bear already dead just in the water. Another bear on the northern shore near a deathclaw nest. One more bear floating in the sky near the lake. Shoot it to make it fall. Then head to thunder mountain and loot the trailers and area of coolant bottles.
---
please. please please please.
---
The movie could change when nuked! Maybe it plays OG godzilla (some of those might be public domain now?), and spawns a glowing mirelurk queen/ giant glowing fog crawler.
---
Of course, the projector, the speakers, they're bound to attract the mutant fish men...
---
One last thing, I want to have to tune my pip-boy radio in to hear the sound. And make that the objective to start the event: **Movie Night.** *Defend the movie goers (skeletons/ teddy bears/radroaches) from the local hoodlums (super mutants with missile launchers).*
---
The catch is, silent/supressed/ melee weapons only. The more noise made, the less the event reward. So you have to take out enemies before they can fire weapons. Could be a good event for all us 15 perception/agility folks!
---
Could also be great if timed for the summer blockbuster season!
---
Exactly! 
---
Man it sucks that the NCR armor wasn’t in 4 or 76. Not as NCR armor of course but the concept.
---
what if you are deaf?
---
Mules. New accounts are cheap. Open a second copy of the game and dump stuff on a new character.
---
That sort of makes them sound like OP cazadores.
---
No we always need to level up, but we should ignore their level period.
---
Yeah I am and I usually sit in that spot after a queen attack to leave stuff in the suitcase and also see what things people sell
---
While I hope this is addressed eventually, it's a common bug that's been around a while. I usually just sell (or fail to sell) something cheap that I was going to sell anyway, and it fixes itself.
---
This would be an awesome feature that I was actually thinking about yesterday while giving away my level 10 legionaries to low level players...
---
Ya I was looking at it today but I want more lol
---
This is correct. You'll need to either farm the Scorchbeast Queen (she should always drop a prime plan you don't have, until you know all of them), or buy one from someone else.
---
Just taking a wild guess but, not so simple for people that can't hear.
---
Yeah it absolutely needs to happen, but I believe there are better ways to make that happen (like fun consumables that cost caps) rather than a weird tax like this.
---
You can't scrap legendaries
---
Had this annoying bug for the past week mainly in white springs. I just back right out of the trade seems to fix it.
---
Hopefully it's sorted out soon!
---
It is to reduce the current inflation. At the moment you gain more caps then you spend (at least at higher levels) which makes the caps less valuble for every day that goes by. I have 4 characters, if i would bother transfering caps between them all of them would have 25k. Instead i just give 1-1,5k caps per day to a friend since wont get anything from selling if i am at 25k. 
---
The inflation is getting more noticable in player trading and now that everyone will be able to trade in-game they want to start reducing it before it gets worse.
---
What do you mean it is the exception? It's one of the most sought after combinations and has been for almost the entire time the game has existed.
---
I meant after the patch, for legendary scrip.
---
I can help kill her if you still doing them n if this one guys doesn’t respsond I have 2 keycards you can have
---
I love the idea of the pencil, it seems so random yet so powerful
---
Hey, is there any chance we could get some skylights for our C.A.M.P.s?
---
I've been agonizing over what my roof is missing for days and it's a skylight.
---
Ey that’s cute man
---
I swear if this is random it's just another skinners box
---
On my PS4 the names on the "recent" tab don't include a "join" option, only "friend", "team" and "block".
---
I’d do 556s at 1 cap a piece, but you’re going to need 1000s. I see people by 5k bullets at a time, if not more. 
---
I wouldn’t go for fusion cores because market has them roughly at 40 caps a piece, and most PA players stock up and don’t let themselves get that low. Maybe focus on ammo only. 
---
(And radaway, maybe?)
---
without the ability to communicate this game feels like a single player fallout without the story
---
really needs a way to communicate outside of mics to ever be successful but I doubt it will ever come because moderation costs money
---
the game just feels too lonely to be a great multiplayer, it will always be a niche without it
---
sure it appeals to a few people, dozens im sure, but most people are actually social and mics just arent enough
---
Just imagine a pencil with speed demon running towards you at 70 mph with a super sledge in hand, now that's terrifying.
---
70 mph is 112.65 km/h
---
I bet it requires a LOT of *scrip* to get what you want for the legendary vendor. I usually just give them out to lower lvls to help out unless they are ones that Ivreally like.
---
I’ve been having this problem lately, and am starting to avoid workshops full stop. It sucks. :/
---
Yeah, while it would have been nice if Todd had couched his terms a bit more carefully, like "We're planning for the ability to re-roll legendaries" rather than just outright stating that it would be possible, but I get that when he was speaking, it was a feature which was still in development. 
---
This said, I think that a good deal of ill-will could be easily dispelled by saying "Sorry about jumping the gun on that idea. As it turned out, it wasn't as practical as we thought it would be and we had to go with something which worked a bit better. Obviously I spoke a bit too soon there."
---
Honestly while a nice idea it's a completely useless idea. You can take a work shop and get plenty for free besides once you equip the perk cards for pa fusion cores almost never run out. So it would never actually be of use sadly
---
I’d go into survival mode more often if my camped wouldn’t be destroyed in 5 seconds
---
It's just so dumb that they have so little of a life they have to do that for no reason and then act like they're the greatest in the universe at the game
---
That was never proven but thank you.
---
id be more content with fusion core downsizing. merging multiple partially charged ones into 1 fully charged one
---
Ikr. I'm never redoing my crops again now that I have everything down. 10 grain, to do the 10 beer dailies in one harvest, some corn and mutfruit for additions beer stuff and one of the rest.
---
Isnt xbox chat, discord or PSN enough?
---
Very true. Though I fully expect to see people doing a LOT of server-hopping in the hopes of finding a better selection in her stock of legendary gear available to them. In the week or so after she's introduced into the game, I'd expect to see people randomly appearing and disappearing in her shop every ten seconds or so.
---
Thanks!  I’ll try and hop on around that time to see if I can catch you
---
Yup I agree with that I'd love to combine them
---
Yeah, they’re so powerful, taking on players who are specced with Pack Rat and Green Thumb. Oooh the challenge. /s
---
People will say “they do it for the caps!” But I can make 5k on caps selling lead and steel, so jokes on them. Take my measly 200 caps while I server hop.
---
Take a look at green thumb in perception, lol
---
You can cut down your crops in one level if you want :p
---
Oh that sucks. Haven't ran into it myself, so I can't help you there. If you're on PC I can help you with caps if you need.
---
A current Workaround to this on PC is to use the radial menu. If you've got the weapon hot keyed it will show its durability under the icon.
---
Much faster than opening the Pip-Boy and you can do it whilst still moving around.
---
I'd much prefer your suggestion but until this gets added (if ever) there *is* a better way than checking in the Pip-Boy or waiting for the red notification to appear.
---
Exactly I just don't even see how it's any fun it's just sad and pathetic
---
TL;DR: Bethesda wants you to feel a sense of pride and accomplishment when you get a 3* Legendary
---
lol did you even read the patch notes?
---
I skimmed after the bit you said you weren’t getting drops, but
---
A lot of the time, it’s just server lag for the item to appear
---
Wait around for like 30s, something should pop up
---
^(a wild 1* leather hunters right arm appears)
---
I'm jealous. I paid 2,500 caps for my TSE 10mm gun. You definitely got the better deal than me.
---
Yeah, because it synergizes. Again that's why it's the exception not the rule. TS is **garbage** without explosive and explosive is twice as strong with TS. In every other case, the 1 star version of the gun is almost as strong as any 3 star variant as the majority of the weapons power comes from being a good prefix such as bloodied instigating or furious.
---
i just wish we could combine partially empty ones
---
Scaled much better in pvp mode than adventure. Just because it wasn’t explosive doesn’t mean it wasn’t legendary. Could have been Anti Armor or Bloodied.
---
Also if he had sentinel or even assassins armor on your getting less damage.
---
Ya I feel you buddy. Still like 3 weeks till legendary vendor, and I'm so curious (and worried, since this is 76 we're talking about) as to how it's going to be implemented. Like will the legendary tokens/scrip/etc we get let for turning things in let us re-roll total randomly? Or re-roll a specific tier on an item? Apply specific properties directly? Move existing properties between pieces? So impatient to find out how it's going to work and wether stockpiling junk legendaries on a mule will have actually been worthwhile, or mostly a waste of time.
---
i think he means more on the lines of getting crap 1 star wood armor from the highest tier mob in the game
---
I’ve been getting this sound as well it started after I put the plague rider paint on my X-01
---
That would be nice, I have four levelled toons and none of them will get dailies there.
---
Said that I don't think fixing frustrating bugs is 'top of the list' given what has been prioritised so far therefore it may be a while until they get around to this.
---
This *please*
---
I was not using a 'lets make fun of people who don't share my view' approach.  Calling someone an asshole is not the same as mocking people with the stupid 'oh boo hoo you whiner' crap you people keep saying when someone has a different opinion.  It literally happens every time I bring up things about repair kits the last guy literally said the same "Boo hoo" thing.  You get to call someone an asshole if they are one.
---
I was in no way negative with my opinion when I post on fo76 but end up having a bunch of kids say I am a whiner and use that childish 'boo hoo' crap.  It is ok to call someone an asshole when they act like one.
---
I was actually rather nice about it.  I said basically there was no need to talk to people (who are trying to engage in a conversation) that way.  It wasn't until after he started saying stuff like he is not there to make me feel warm and whatever that I called him an ass.
---
There is, but when you have multiple about to break...
---
I know I'd be a lot less likely to immediately go to VATS when I hear *"COOOONGRATULAAAATIONS!"*
---
Oooh, I see
---
My mistake
---
I’m guilty of doin it for the extra degrade time for them. Got some from the bat queen and got curious. It did not in fact make my weapons last longer
---
&gt; The fuck our taxes going?
---
Same as always. Military contractors and weapons manufacturers. They always get the biggest slice of the pie in the US.
---
This whole thread is off the rails......
---
might give me a reason to go back to the game since I dont have a mic
---
I don't think the new sounds are just the Nukashine paint job, though. I haven't applied it yet (I know, I'm lazy), but there's a new sound that happens when I land from a height.
---
r/photography is leaking again! 
---
Do you find the 105mm lens being super tiny as annoying as I do? Also, how about that auto-film loading mechanism? Wish I could hot-swap 35mm that quick! 6 frames? If it were 6X7 maaaaaayyyyybeee
---
Cool photos bruh.
---
Crazy right!?
---
I have that. You need 2 grains per brew so you still need 10 plants.
---
Thus always to tyrants.
---
... caps will still be there in the game. The cap economy will be for auto vendors, etc. I suspect player trade economy moves to legendary tokens.
---
Or I’m not following you.
---
Upvoted because I miss SWG. (I know there's a fan-made server now, but with 24GB/mo of available bandwidth, I can barely manage the patches some months, nevermind re-obtaining everything to play SWG! heh)
---
D'oh, I should have read all the comments before I posted basically the same thing as you.
---
Get back to me after 500+ hours of grinding legendaries and we'll see if you have the same attitude.
---
Boo
---
Plans and drugs. I've hoarded almost 50 pounds of drugs. And alcohol. Currently sitting on a dozen vintage Nuka shine since I gave a few (that shit is more overweight than my mom, Bethesda)
---
Got an instigating crippling fast shooting gamma gun. I almost want to do a gunslinger for that.
---
Look in game setting. You can pick any button you want to use. I believe back space is default
---
yes not to mention some of the plans you only find like once every 500 hours ..lol
---
Latest inside the vault doesn’t seem to indicate re-rolls at all. Pity - even at a very high scrip count ... I’d love to be able to re-spin some of my 3* where 2 fo the 3 are right where I want and try to tweak the 3rd rather than RNG.
---
They also tend to have better durability.
---
Captainoob is the best
---
Idk. I think it's fine. 10% isn't much, even for people who dont already vend online. I guess we just disagree on this, and that's fine.
---
Roleplayers at their finest. Love it.
---
I accidentally found this bug tried to sell something and suddenly 1400 caps appear!! Thought I was magic haha
---
Bro I got like 400 hours logged in “ I have a feeling that’s wrong I play almost every day for 8 hours for the past 4 months but hey” and I got excited for a vampire mini gun -_- my rng sucks no matter what game I play lmao
---
They said they are working on a way to make this happen.
---
Ammo is solid. 556, shotgun, maybe some prime items.
---
I’ll probably drop in decent legendaries I won’t be using that aren’t scrip bait.
---
Plans, maps and mods.
---
Of course, targeted aid. Radaway, Rad Shield, Super Stim,
---
How're you thinking it'll work then? JW, everyone seems to have different theories lol, and I really can't for the life of me guess which it'll be
---
I'm still using about the same amount of diluted stimpacks every time I fight the fake sheepsquatch. Sometimes less than before, sometimes more, but it averages about the same. So if there is a bug, its' not consistent across all players or all situations.
---
The repair kit drops maybe replaced the higher end drops do you think? These are useful to keep the items you use in top shape and still make her a. Must fight imo
---
I’m kinda glad it’s the way it is. Good weapons are cheap enough as it is. With a buff, everything would be worthless
---
I would assume there would be a way to turn it off
---
Text chat on console too. No games do it, but its useful for quick messages you dont wanna pull the mic out for.
---
I was gonna ask if the bot is Ukrainian ummm yeah.
---
Just find a nice quiet node somewhere and put a house on it.  Never having to worry about acid again has been great.
---
i usually play 7pm to 3am est daily can join me anytime ya see me on, psn: silune (just reference this post since i gnore random friend requests with no note)
---
Who knew a *shitpost* would get so much love in the Fallout 76 community...
---
I'm going to keep farming and scrap the legendaries I have when the vendor is added just to test it out and see
---
Plans, chems, recipes, mods, fully modded mid-level stuff if you're near a low-level spot, ammo's, alcohols, food. Basically.
---
back out of the camp build menu and re-open it
---
I think the legendary vendor will just be a vendor, selling legendary weapons and armor for scrip.
---
And with the legendary vendor, it'll just be that much easier.
---
I do and sometimes it still doesn’t work. Very annoying!
---
Not gonna lie, that was my first thought too.
---
huh, interesting.
---
Yes they are trying. If you don't remove caps now and then, everybody has 25k caps (or a million if there's no hardmax) and a single stimpak has to be sold 10k for you to consider selling yours. 
---
So in order to put player vendor, this is needed.
---
if it is a trash roll that no one will buy, save it and make it scrip. if it is a decent roll. sell it for caps
---
it just happens sometimes
---
disconnect and join another server then. those two methods work for me. the second only if the first fails several times
---
Gotcha, thank ya kind sir
---
Captainnoob is the shit
---
I run (almost) the same stealth-melee build and the mighty drill is my go-to meme weapon, hilarious to farm WesTek or Whitesprings with it
---
A bug as far as I can tell.  Try tabbing out and reversing the connection. For example, if you tried running wire from your generator to a power pylon at first, start with the pylon instead and attaching the wire to the generator.  That usually works for me.
---
Sounds good I’ve just been looking for someway to grind end game but honestly I don’t know how or what is needed for end game. Also my build is a hot ass mess and dps is low so I need to figure out what build I want
---
It definitely IS viable, as long as it’s doing above 100dmg per tick :)
---
They dont want your caps because caps are abundant, so this is infact exactly your problem.
---
If they fix inflation caps will have value in player-to-player transations.
---
and Missiles!
---
Oh, I see
---
But there is an icon already.
---
Like preset ones, like the Survival rewards?
---
I mean maybe, although I doubt that, based on what little info there is. Especially since Inside the Vault says:
---
 "For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get thelegendary weapon or armor of your dreams"
---
Also, I know this thread is mostly postulation, but it does reference Todd saying it'd be a re-roll system specifically:

See downvotes. Don’t message or comment on my posts lol.  if you disagree with the whole idea behind my original post here that many, and yea that includes my family, have understood rather than rebuke then that’s your problem. Not mine lol. And for the record I’m not underage. This feed is over. Get lost dude and don’t send me private messages.
---
failed to make a proper retort, still a cry baby. serith 1 you zero on your stupid forehead
---
But some people (like me) will undercut those prices, even if I take a "loss" there is a chance I could do more business. Yay capitalism! Liberty Prime approved
---
ok whatever. I am not you.
---
THIS! I had an amazing neighbor (my camp is across from Slocum Joe's, which happens to be a popular C.A.M.P. spot.) He was so kind and welcoming when I visited. He then followed me back and proceeded to drop a ton of Stimpacks, materials, and recipes. Not only that, he had me invite to a team (I had no idea what I was doing as I was so new and low level) and then proceeded to build generators to power a massive C.A.M.P. setup. This guy was such an angel. I had no idea what to do (no mic at the time) so I spammed heart and thumbs up emotes, and then tried to give him some homemade Starlight Berry Cobbler. lol. There are so many awesome people in this game; it's been wonderful to experience. I just feel bad that I can't repay the favor in the same way since I'm so low level. &lt;3
---
With legendary trader coming soon just consider it banked currency for later. 
---
Every drop can't be ideal on a game like this, no sense being upset about it.
---
your lame dude. if you PvP ( which you don't) repair kits don't anything competitive. you die within 1 minute in the toughest engagements. so you can " repair" and then head back into the fight but having a broken weapon generally isn't how PvP goes down. 
---
playing fallout like it's competitive is really stupid. the game has no incentive for being competitive at this time but the fact your competing means your just wasting resources. have fun picketing with your friends in front of Amazon this weekend. your THAT person.
---
The thing is thought that we can still play separately, just not together
---
I totally name fun of people like you in game after leveling your house cause you locked the door and I want a stove to use.
---
All they did was make repairing a clunky annoying experience.
---
I think you are right BUT asking too much. For a game studio, those are a lot of massive changes to do.
---
I think the vendor is coming with patch 9, which is 6 days away
---
Pick up meat hook or the pipe rifle. Meat hook is benighted from unarmed peeks and belle perks and the pipe rifle is getting Benifit from pistol and rifle perks.
---
That’s a photoshop FYI. What are you referring too. The red gun marker in the bottom right?
---
Let us not attribute to maliciousness, what we can attribute to ignorance.
---
I posted a link about this a long time ago. but yeah.. shits rwal
---
Nice
---
You're welcome :)
---
You're welcome.
---
Roadmap says the 23:
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/fallout-76-roadmap/
---
The next patch is the Pioneer Quest (backpacks) and Player Vending Machines
---
But how are anything outside TSE shotguns viable? It's impossibru!!
---
/s
---
Obviously
---
I am not competitive.  It is just that it technically gives a competitive advantage, especially in certain situations which you just aren't thinking about, which Bethesda promised not to do.  It just takes a little bit of creativity and critical thinking to see how it could possibly give a competitive advantage.  I was not talking about one on one PVP even though there are situations where it still stands such as sniper battles where it is easy to get cover.  It won't create a huge advantage and might not work in all situations but it is an advantage - and the criticism is more about the promise Bethesda made than me actually worried about someone getting an edge on me.  It is a principle thing.
---
You got that Lincoln Repeater?
---
No I mean, running the AWOL event by myself, smashing through stimpacks and ammo and crushing every wave of gutsy on my own, to fight the only 3 star legendary, killing it.... and nothing showing up in the inventory... and I did wait.. like 5-7 minutes lol 
---
I would have been happy with a 1 star wood left arm... at least it would have been better then nothing
---
Oh didn't know about this otherwise I wouldn't have mentioned it lol
---
Pretty sure I sold a bloodied meathook three stars because of the cursor moving in your inventory issue. The thing was not only favourite, it was most certainly equipped at the time. This is frustrating.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abwz03/comment/ed3koor
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd love if it were coming so soon 🤣
---
I recently sold 120 grape mentats to Modus when I realized how absurd it was that I was carrying so many around with me all at once. I'll never need to have more than, like, five or six, but I routinely find myself with well over 200. I should be treating most of them as mid-range vendor-junk.
---
Would be better if we could do what FNV did and we cna quick assign repair kits and it'll fix our broken weapon instead of having to go through 3 menus.
---
There's this thing that's works exactly foe the same result: crafting them. 
---
You're just asking for even more braindead way to farm this thing. Keeping up cost of PA is already barely a nuance as it is.
---
Gotta do what u gotta do to survive in the Wasteland LOL (obviously the only viable weapon is the Alien Blaster)
---
it's not. you need sinks. caps have no value anymore and if you want proof check the forums. the most bad ass items people only want trades for because they are at the cap limit. you have to have something to always done money on or else there is no point.
---
Do you have any idea how many combinations you can get ? IIRC A single three Star on the SBQ would make you do around 1500 nuke launch to get the item you want.
---
Or even just the planters from Fallout 4. The fact that they were introduced with one of the DLCs as a solution to an existing problem in that game, and that the same problem exists in this game which had *already previously been solved* but which they didn't provide us with the solutions for is absurd.
---
Check the whitespring vendors, with the addition of the faction vendors, I was able to buy heavy combat chest and heavy combat legs in that server and it took 2 server hops to get the legs.
---
Thank you for your response, sucks you lost a weapon like that.
---
Highland Marsh had a Queen, King and Hatchlings ready for the slaughter.
---
Only the King was far away, so I shot the King, and waited until he was about halfway from where I shot him to where the Queen was, started killing the Queen, by the time I killed the Queen, the King was by the Queen's body, then I killed the King, and then killed the hatchlings.
---
I just uninstalled. I am done with Bethesda. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice... I will never give this company another penny of my hard earned money. The real shame is I loved to play Fallout Shelter on my Nintendo. But its gone also. I am done.
---
I wouldn't mind if you tried to destroy my house.  Might try to defend it but won't be whining about it.  I don't mind people who play tough.  I do mind people who are rude when someone is trying to have a conversation, and I do mind what Bethesda is doing with the Atom store.
---
When this happens I just try to attach from the other side, has worked every time for me (on PC).
---
Ahhh, it's legendary VENDING machines I read about, my bad. For anyone that hasn't seen the patch 9 notes:

Yeah, they have a teammate contest the workshop while they hunt you down through the map.
---
Imagine thinking PvP is griefing.
---
One was literally on rock behind my camp too.  Really weird
---
Imagine thinking that destroying someone’s camp outside of workshops is griefing.  My poem is great have a good day sir.
---
Id hope they start with just needing new characters and bringing the npc health and damage closer together.
---
To trigger dailies in The Mire?
---
Weapons that don't drop anymore. The best example is a 2 Shot Exploding Flamer.. Weapons that didn't make sense but existed anyway
---
Wow has many items with 0.01% drop rate.
---
Color wheel. 
---
*Always* a color wheel. 
---
I mean, I don't understand a damned thing about the actual integration of such a feature...but I have a hard time understanding why *any* game with customizable cosmetics doesn't offer some form of actual choice. World is full of colors, screw you and your restrictions.
---
Smart AND modest!
---
VERY modest!  I’m so great!
---
I seriously agree, training up an alt at the moment and it's annoying as hell that I have to find and relearn plans I already have on my main.
---
Certain weapons and armor I have to craft it with my main and transfer to my alt but it's time consuming to even do that plus I have to rope in a friend to transfer them
---
It's RNG. Just like any RNG drop based game, ya win some, ya lose some. You think I like dumping the time into doing Destiny &amp; Destiny 2 raids to get crap drops? Or grinding for ages on Diablo 3 to get junk? No, but RNG is RNG and so you grind and move on.
---
Thanks for the link! That's really cool that they are adding the turn-in machines all over the place, and before the vendor even gets here. Guess I won't have to wait so long to unload my mule. Just left waiting to see what the hell my "scrip" will actually do lol
---
Tbh this service should be included with the legendary vendor.
---
Let us make a choice to either use the new currency/tokens to either increase the level of existing legendary items or change a legendary type on our weapons/armor
---
I’d also like the weapon itself to change visually the worse its condition gets, so I can turn my hud off and still know.
---
Now that’s an entirely new feature but would bend well with this one. It would be amazing. I remember seeing an animation from fallout 4 for when your weapon breaks.
---
I am the most cautious, grandma-level player even in the current iteration of survival but the idea of what you just describe makes me salivate. 
---
I am dreaming of a time when pvp in survival gets super balanced and a hardcore mode emerges where we can loot each other’s entire inventory on death. Or their camps. This obviously would only make sense if in order to do this mode, you started a fresh character.
---
How would it work though? That's the question. How I'll implement it is that when you're customizing your power armor in the station, you'll be able to individually paint each part for your power armor. When you go to the paint section, there'll be an option saying "Custom Paint" where it'll bring up a color wheel and an input where you can put a Hex code. This way or atomic shop and vendor, I'll be happy.
---
I fucking dread this patch for this reason. After months of playing I finally found an amazing quad explosive one perception double barrel. I'm terrified it's gonna suck shit after they mess with it, frankly I don't trust them at all when it comes to balancing.
---
They’ve already confirmed that they’re working on this. In the meantime you can just move the pictures to somewhere else on the hard drive.
---
sounds like sentinel armor
---
I don't accept fights that are out of my league, no point in wasting resources.
---
My armor and PA increase my carry weight so I can still walk carrying them all 
---
I'm perminantly over encumbered and have been for 3-4 months now.
---
Last time I counted I had 23 weapons on me not including grenade types lol
---
This would be very helpful for the black powder players!
---
They should have a separate and scalable microservice for inventory management which is separate from the server you are on.  Monolithic architectures tend to not scale well..
---
I agree I like it as well, and as much as ppl talk shit bout it (so i know im on the minority) I like the encrypted event. its a all hands on like the sbq but with more of a co-op feel. The sbq it seems like it's everyone for themselves.
---
You’re acting like they haven’t broken promises or done the bare minimum in the past. Don’t be silly.
---
Because she’s f***ing pissed.
---
It would also be nice to have the option to make an armor piece heavy. Or turn in script to upgrade the piece to a heavy one.
---
The idea of shaders also is pretty good. Probably Bethesda can find a way to implement it, but color wheel allows unlimited customization while shaders restrict you to like only red and white. What I got to give props to is Anthem and their color customization, too bad it really isn't in a good spot right now.
---
LOooohohoooooww drop expectations for me. I am happy to get the loot at all. And learn a new plan very least but if you going for a specific set i dont blame you.
---
Dont just look on 1 place and bank on a SBQ for everything i mean isnt there other Events to do dont nukes raise the level cap.....of where ever you nuke ?! White spring yea but event wise Heart of the swamp One violent night and the newly added Burrows. Plus harpers ferry with a garunted legendary spawn 2-4 without a nuke.... At least for me.
---
I take 5 mins before playing to clean up my photo gallery in the main menu. But that's just me. (No disrespect OP)
---
Interesting mechanic. Do you know how this script  is?
---
Something like:
---
If (pissed) {fly away}    ??
---
I used to have one but I prefer the music on the radios. Thing with the jukebox is it automatically starts up on starting the game but my radios don't. If I want welcoming music to my bar for folk to drink to, I have to remember to turn them on before I head on out.
---
Proving it was never worth that much in the first place.
---
I usually kill the Grafton monster just north of Hemlock, a lot of the time there will be a couple of Snallygasters in the area with him so 20ish acid per run is very easy. Then you can server hop and repeat, plus things like Abraxo in Whitesprings laundry area are pretty good.
---
What platform? I hope the guy sees your post and we can see some pictures of video if he posts it up. Or if you have some.
---
It’s at 800 because it I needs to be right now. Instability. It’ll increase over time.
---
No, that was the dupers.
---
Three snallygasters outside of Toxic Larry's Meat n Go.
---
Decon arch TSE? You sure he didn't stopped playing?
---
If (home) = (nuked) and iff progesterone level &gt; 75% of baseline then destroy armor with acid and  fly = offmap. 
---
PS.  Your character deserves no food.
---
That’s not at all why it was increased, and your style of play doesn’t decide other peoples.
---
And you’re a stupid fucking cunt.
---
use paint from the atom shop
---
What if scrip isn't transferable?
---
Just me playing satan' s advocate. 😎
---
Happened to me last week, the sign is still inside the wall, your post just reminded me it’s there lol
---
It's like people have never played MMORPG's before this game.
---
It's called the grind for a reason.    Those that can hack it get the good stuff, those that can't, complain and give up.
---
Yeah man but this topic is about getting better loot on the SBQ so we talk about the loot you get on the SBQ. Is it the first time you ever use a forum?
---
Then I'll have someone help me move the items I wanna re-roll to the mule, and have the mule do the re-rolls, and then transfer back 🤷
---
I saw a tweet by a Japanese Fallout 76 player a while ago who did something similar to OP, but arguably even more impressively absurd: 
---
https://twitter.com/chalist_/status/1111237975587717120
---
Yes. That shows you when your Weapon will break. Is that not what you're asking for?
---
Sorry about the video. I keep confusing private and unlisted. It should be up now.
---
Get off your high horse brah, it’s a game... you must be real fun at parties😂if people wanna do that then I don’t see the issue.  Beth needed to take accountability for their own mess and the failure to fix duping after months just shows their incompetence. Beth shills and white knights defending their actions so far are laughable... Beth can make no mistakes and are always 100% correct according to them. This game was and still is a big L in the industry and they know that. Makes real marketing and business sense to ban and temp ban probably half of the player base hahaha yikes.
---
It's level 5 ;(
---
I want the damn vaults!!!!! :(
---
Hoooo. 
---
Then what does the prime receiver make to a weapon? Able to use ultracite ammo? If yes what is the difference between a ultracite gatling laser, a gatling laser with prime receiver and a zealot gatling laser, and which is most effective on a sbq? ._.
---
Needed to kill a sheepsquatch for the daily challenge, thank you for this info.
---
Take your PVP to survival and leave us adventurers alone.
---
You could always go play Fallout 4.
---
Lots of events are doing that now, had it happen with SBQ and guided meditation.
---
From what I can see your not in the water park but on the outskirts. I've had it happen with watoga part on other lv up challenge I was in the river NE side of watoga and it didn't catch it.
---
F
---
Yeah happened to me yesterday at enclave medicap vendor.
---
Agreed!
---
Yes definitely good and real.  Have made the Radstag Stew, which is a curry made from goat or lamb.  Very tasty.
---
No shit... Of the last 10 queen's I have done (most launched myself or with a group) I have got a zero drop 7 of them.
---
I think I'd rather get crap to trade for scrip than to lose 1000s of bullets and chems for nothing
---
I hope it's a priority even without vendors. We've had gangs of griefers coming through and destroying our camps because they can't hack it in survival.
---
I have a 3 star nocturnal wood left leg in just holding on to until the vendor comes out lol
---
Because the sales of that fancy shit keeps the servers running
---
I was actually amazed by these holotape games. I got a bit addicted on the Grognak holotape game and it felt like nostalgia of other games I used to play
---
Nice! I wrote something similar a few days ago, about macking survival actual survial...
---
What do you think about a character deletion upon death?
---
*scared eyebot noises*
---
If you owned a workshop and they claimed it you become a enemy or if you were on a team and your teammates fought that person you are still agro to that person because of your team mates
---
If it's a favourite you'll get the CND from the wheel
---
Which I why I don't think this is needed
---
 If it's a favourite you'll get the CND from the wheel
---
I always just tap him and then walk backwards to the other players so they can get a share to (have a .50cal expl so i can kill fast if i want). Melee players tend to be (in my experience) the one hit killers.
---
Nope twas solo one the guy wasn’t wanted nor was I I was simply trading with a player and he walked up and smacked me thrice and ended my life
---
Passafist doesn't protect you from those situations and it could have been a teammates workshop being claimed that made you aggro towards them and able to be attacked
---
“You can have any color as long as it’s black”
---
Did you own a workshop
---
The 25k cap is doing most of the job  by itself.
---
This is a good choice from bethesda: nothing can worth more that 25k that way and in a practical way that mean nothing can worth more than around 10k, because the transaction become tedious to achieve.
---
Courier dogs! Please make it happen.
---
I’ve done it.
---
Some asshole had his house locked up tight and elevated off the ground so you couldn’t get through a window, and running around attacking other people and their homes. Anyone that fought back was murdered instantly due to his build.
---
I lured mutants, a roller bot, and two scorch beasts to his fortress home. It took a while of me kiting them around it, but they leveled that fucking thing to the ground. He couldn’t do a thing to me about it.
---
Fuck that guy. I’d do it again.
---
I don't think I will use repair kits period. I mean what is the point of looting otherwise? Just not my jam thanks but no.
---
Other people have said it already but just wait around the area it died until it turns into a metal pile. There was one time that once it exploded me and a couple of friends scoured the area and couldn’t find it at all until about 15 minutes later when it finally turned to a metal pile. If you can’t find it just be a little patient with it. It also helps to clear out some of the other metal piles so that when one pops up in an odd spot you know it’s the imposter.
---
Not all weapons and armor have skins though but I do but I need skins for some of my other weapons if so
---
It’s probably your count for how many ‘points’ of legendary stars you have turned in. I’m hoping to hit 999 the first day
---
OMG MORE GRIEFING THIS IS GETTING OUT OF HAND BATHSASDA
---
Slap Damage isn't in the game anymore, you were taking full damage.
---
Why were you taking full damage? You would have to provide more info.
---
Yes actually it is and I apoligize for that.
---
Ps4 I hope he sees it too. I wish I took the last 15 min video but I got distracted.
---
My main is a blood relavtive to a red head without any legs and has a similar affinity to things mechanical.
---
My Alt, is an Assaultron that broke it's programing and found the Mansion of Mysteries.
---
Recoil. It's very important sometimes
---
Did you drop a "/s" ? 
---
If not : this is a thread of conversation. The theme is "we are not looting good enough stuff on the last boss of the game". So we discuss what could be done, in current proposition "have automatically *** stuff on that creature".
---
Sure, if you farm the whole game, you'll meet many legendaries, and end with many good drops. We all did that. Most endgame players have *** stuff. 
---
But it's still infuriating to face the last boss of the game and leave with a wooden left leg that reduces damages from mirelurks. Nobody wants that. It has no value. Not even with the legendary vendor coming.
---
Uhh no. People buy junk all the time. Acid, steel, plastic. Others. It’s all valuable.
---
As long as it's optional I'm all for this. Turn it on if you want to trade, advertise things for sale or group. Turn it off for solo play. Simples
---
Because you’re locked into PVP automatically and never out of it.  Adventure isn’t survival so unfortunately when you go in you and anything you own is subject to get the hurt put on you.
---
awsome thanks dude
---
niice will try that thanks
---
While I would’ve loved for this to happen, imagine 24 people in a server running around with 24 dogs lol.  When I pictured it I laughed very, very hard.
---
I do love him! I’m waiting possibility to use him everywhere I have Ultracite AAE laser and the durability is only for 1 SBQ event. That’s bad for me, I want to use it only
---
Watch who you team up with. If they start a pvp you are also aggro due to association as a team mate.
---
For the moment, they will only have the exchanging feature, and then MAYBE they'll get a rerolling function. I pulled this from a month old comment regarding what little Bethesda talked about it earlier (think it was when they did a stream at pax east, or some other convention): "Only thing we've been told is that we'll be able to scrap and sell legendaries and that it takes * levels into account somehow. Most recent interview there was reference to being able to do something **to make a desired result more likely somehow**. No real details on that."
---
So from that description, it's at least somewhat likely that there will be a reroll function, and it could very likely be tied to the machine rather than the vendor. However, due to having not even mentioned about it with this weeks Inside The Vault (and there will be another one with more details regarding the Purveyor vendor), that the rerolling function might be something they're backtracking on, or is a feature that might get delayed (probably this...), or was never going to be something to being with (which would be seriously disappointing).
---
There's also the chance that rather then rerolling effects on legendary items we own, we'll instead have the ability to buy legendary items with random effects... which would be pretty ass compared to rerolling. "**to make a desired result more likely somehow**" could also be interpreted with this kind of system as this: You pay up an X amount of Scrips to choose the weapon you want with the effects you want, and the more you pay, the more likely you'll get what you want. There is a chance that they'll do things like a "Heavy Weapon Mystery Box" and a "Unarmed Weapon Mystery Box". With that kind of system, the more you pay the more likely you'll get what you want, BUT there is the chance that you'll get what you want for substantially less (chances are that it simply won't be worth it though, and just paying the highest amount you can is the reliable way of doing it.). However, I have a hard time believing that they will even implement a way to get a super high chance of getting EXACTLY what you want. Random rerolling seems more likely, and if they give you the ability to pay more for higher chances, the chances probably won't be that high anyway.
---
Setting speculation aside, I'm 95% sure that there's going to be some kind of gambling involved anyway. That's just how endgame content works. You kill a boss or complete a dungeon/raid/whatever for the chance of something, and/or a special vendor that you can gamble at can get you other rewards (or an alternative way to obtain the same rewards).
---

---
I don't carry a lot of weapons. Handmade, shotty and knife. My carry weight without PA is 380.
---
Upnuked, so Fred can see the post and give us a tour. And maybe tutorial. :)
---
\- reactive plate can trigger PVP even in passive mode
---
? I don’t understand how that is relevant to getting told that your camp is under attack, so you can go to your camp and attack said individual(s)
---
While I agree that workshops need to be contested, I feel that PVP is the wrong way to go about this. More often than not, it's not a low level player that *really needs* to use that workshop. It's the ones who are going around at level 150+ one-shotting lower level players just for their caps and junk while claiming the workshop just to make the previous owner attempt to reclaim it so they can farm caps.
---
A chat room in out pipboy would be pretty interesting
---
Yeah me and me 2000 pounds of stuff crashed the servers and not the people duping tens of thousands of items on a daily basis.
---
He's literally asking for an option to stop having to do that every time.
---
The game ark does it for console, that's the only one I can think of atm

31st of October, 2077. Anthony Torres was a sun of a texan father (occupation: farmer) and a west-virginian mother (occupation: chef). He was barely 8 years old when he was faced with the glow of nuclear annihilation. Raised with a more cowboy-esque mindset, southern hospitality and values such as high work, high reward he took to the wasteland with a dream. However, once seeing everything was nuked to shit, he got a slight obsession over trying to live as comfortable as plausible. As close to pre-war america.  
---
This is best seen in his C.A.M.P., which is basically a bar, barn, brahmin and a lot of farmed land. Due to his willingness to put in the effort, he is one of the only reliable food sources about, even making cheese, and raiding him can cause quite some empty stomachs down the line.  
---
It also helps that he brews alcohol, and if there's two things that will survive the apocalypse, it's capitalism and alcoholism.  
---
TL;DR: Halfbreed texan makes a kick-ass saloon and is a reliable source of farmed food for those willing to pay.
---
I get what he's asking. i was just offering a solution. Jeez
---
I just want to be able to merge half empty ones.
---
I meant really for other players. So they have their own main camp and a fully functioning shop camp that im leaving open to the public. My food/water farm downstairs are locked though lol
---
Harper's Ferry, West Tek, The Burrows are [relatively good places](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=197047020).
---
I get overencumbered pretty quickly in Whitesprings and I slug along as long a possible (especially if it is nuked but the radiation is glitching out) and then sell the loot to vendors.
---
ahhhh that's what It reminded me of!!!!! its been bugging me lol
---
Far too many crybaby’s on here. My personal best drop was an AA handmade from a non legendary ghoul at white springs. I’m 775 hours played. Drops are RANDOM, you win some you lose some. If everyone got a tse and legendary sentinel armour from every scorchedbeast, game wouldn’t be too much fun. Would it!??. Bring on the downvotes, entitled children.
---
And now for text chat
---
on xbox? I might have to come visit next week :)
---
Goodish bot
---
Still have it ?
---
No joke
---
Please fix -_-
---
It means that in adventure mode you get a notification because it’s going from non hostile to hostile.  Why would they give a notification in survival mode when the point is for no one to be visible (except for the leaderboards and wanted)?
---

It's this cave not same guy.
---
I had to take mine out of my CAMP cause I just can't listen to it anymore.
---
I do because I don’t give a shit about “others” opinions

At least it's half of it.
---
Someone’s chest piece went missing tonight dashboarding and loading back in.  Such a strange bug.
---
Sorry, i can only upvote you once.  
---
Thanks.
---
I am not against bigger stashsize, but the current size is very manageable. The more you play the more know what you don't need.
---
Also if you sell stuff, this stuff will go out of your inventory by definition and the legendary money will probably help to free a lot of room too.
---
They were wanted? But I wasn’t aggroged on em
---
You don’t have control over that unfortunately.
---
&gt;Genuiene question, but how have you earned that much? I've put in several hours into my main character, and I think I'm yet to hit 10k total (I'm counting everything I've purchased...I currently only have about 2.5k on my character). Though I will also admit I've still got a lot of exploring, questing and looting to do (hit level 50 during the double XP weekend, still havent done nuke zones or anything yet though)
---
There's a 1400 daily cap availability from vendors. If you clear that out every day it only takes 17 days.
---
From the posts on reddit, it seems that only excavator armor is effected. (At least I did not see posts re other pieces)
---
Also, it seems all were with Store-paint
---
Had 3 pieces go missing so far
---
&gt; As long as you land a few bullets in here a loot drop will be instanced to your character
---
unless it bugs out and gives you nothing at all for 3 SBQs in a row, go figure
---
Juicehead did a video today with Speculation on how the Legendary vendor will work.

What is wrong with playing the instruments. Isn't that the idea.  Haven't done this one for a while. Does it just reduce the time for spawning?
---
I agree. There are many reasons why someone would have a mic and never use it. Take me for an example, there is a toddler in the house that takes naps during the day. Everyone sleeps at different times in this house - I myself like to game either late at night or early in the morning. The same reason I cannot talk with the mic is the same reason that I have to play with headphones. Need. Quiet. I would love to talk, I just can't. I wouldn;t be surprised if many other people are in this same situation. Give us a voice in the game - a keyboard :)
---
I’ll follow you around barking at everything I see if you pay me in violet flux.
---
Exactly this. People whining about being given an extra option, christ. Used two kits the other day as I ran out of silver.
---
That sucks.  It must have thought I was outside the park.  Cause I was definitely IN the waterpark.  I was inside the building under a big slide.
---
Imma take a workshop and fiddle to figure out user staircase. I'll update. 😎
---
This, I have herd mentality so it helps to be in a team but sometimes after events my teammates try to fight and they people attack me
---
So does this mean explosive shotguns will be worthless now? Can't wait to watch one of my favorite weapons become trash overnight.
---
1200 hrs and ive seen two people *ever* enter H/H. even with free atoms as a prize no one cares
---
I remember these days!
---
I just hope that it wont cause a conflict like what happened with the brewing station. Don't I recall taking a brew out of your stash that was fermenting broke your character? :/
---
You are meant to feel isolated and alone for the most part - human interactions are precious and fleeting and the world has been ravaged by nuclear bombs - that said, once you find friends and good companions you simply add them as friends and talk, it’s far quicker and easier to talk and you can game still whilst talking - text chat boxes look a mess in my opinion and often obscure details within a game, mics can be picked up for very reasonable prices these days and they don’t have to be high quality for people to hear you...
---
youre not a real man until you kill the queen with a Mr Handy Buzz Blade doing 150+ damage @ VFAST
---
1 million caps
---
...or you could take your PVP to survival and leave us adventurers alone.
---
Use kits to farm kits or use money to get more kits.
---
People will use money.
---
This is game breaking, it's basically Shark Cards for GTA. This game is a joke.
---
No, no we don’t...
---
They look scruffy, obscure details in the game world and take you away from the game... talking doesn’t interrupt the flow and allows you to communicate and warn other players of enemies during battles - this is also the advantage of having real people instead of NPC’s - as a species we’ve been communicating verbal for centuries and long may it continue - more so in games...
---
So if you can’t trump up £20 for a mic then use discord or the consoles chat command but don’t obscure the screen with more unnecessary clutter!
---
It’s a server over loaded problem with lag factory characters and grill cheeses cooked on the servers. Happens to cause a lot of problems when it get busy.
---
Slap damage isn't in the game anymore
---
Will probably cost 1500 atoms. I was surprised the stand wasnt in at the beginning but bobbleheads operate differently in this game so I can see why we didn't need one.
---
Im 90% sure all types drop. As for quantity im not sure. Its definitely less than before way less.
---
The problem is that people sleep. Especially toddlers. The same reason I can't use a mic is the same reason I can't play without headphones. Everyone sleeps at different times here. Should I really need to get a house of my own right now just so I can play with a mic? That would be a ridiculous overhead for a game. It would be more simple to add a transparent keyboard chatroom on the lower left (like runescape), that you can turn on or off in the settings. And there can be a word bubble e-mote which signifies that you are talking in keyboard chat or that you are requesting (to the person near you) to turn on keyboard chat and read your text. Why not? It's opens up to more players which are people in different situations like the situation here I am in.  
---
Also, some people mentioned that some gamers are deaf. I never thought of that, but that is an even better reason for keyboard chat although I think that deaf people would need subtitles for NPC dialog as well.
---
I have mostly every legendary effect with Explosiv on my shotguns and I run a Bloodied build but I have to say melee is much better and OP instead of Explo shotguns. 
---
Sure with vats critical and all Shotgun skills they got a lot of power but my Bloodied Powerfist without any Perks does 250 dmg more then my Bloodied Explo Pump lol
---
Added. Thank you.

Alex or Dredrot is what he went by these days was a Tall slender creature compared to what he looked like before the war. Waking up to the sound of the bombs falling from the sky that fateful day. Quiet and warped he wondered the wastes of Appalachia he quickly started a hobby, Collecting Teeth being human or not.  After many quick and failed attempts to reconnect with survivors, Dredrot started avoiding or hiding in plain sight from other survivors all together. 
---
Once in contact with radiation Dredrot took a different approach. Evolve. Evolution was natural in life and with it he evolved. A walking ground zero of diseases and radiation from not only his way of life but way of eating. His modo  ”if it’s edible it’s nourishment”  this included the meat of man. 
---
Age: 47
---
Could you elaborate?
---
Why? Why should I not PvP in a game with PvP, and even the ability for you to turn it off if you don't want to participate? With the impending camp damage changes, you have absolutely NO reason to ever experience PvP if you don't want to.
---
I don't think he did. After all this, he fast travelled away, and a few minutes later I see this come here gesture icon on the screen. Wasn't sure what it meant, as I've only teamed once. Eventually I fast travel to him and he's in the more with a dead sheepsquatch. I just missed the event due to my slow reaction.
---
Couldn’t they just make a “Bulk Scrap” recipe? Maybe give it a slight weight discount compared to the individual components so people would be enticed to use it.
---
So you say, explosive is OP on shotguns, because you chain crits?
---
Yeah, you are totally right. So I'm triying my luck if someone willing. :)
---
It could possibly be partly to do with CVAA legislation.  As of January 1st, any game produced, or "substantially updated", must ensure all their modes of electronic communication are as accessible as possible for people with disabilities.  They would have to, at some point, implement text-to-speech or something I guess, and ensure the text chat is readable to people with all kinds of vision impairments.
---
Exactly. They may be slowly working on making an actual finished game, but they create problems to sell you a solution. And the moment the whales stop spending, support will drop.
---
Are you sure? When I had my xbox 360 quite some time ago, I could do it with other games. Are they really not accessible?
---
This is actually entirely believable and that's sad
---
This mod for the Torso in power armor (Reactive plates) reflects 50% of damage back to the attacker, thus overrides passive mode when the attacker takes damage and triggers PVP. It’s like you are fighting back, but in this case the the reactive plates are doing this for you.
---
they downvote posts like this and yet upvote posts about poop on a bed(toilet paper + fertilizer on a bed) . SMH

Meeee! I have the outfit and need help too.

I can help, IGN:emreyigit93

Is it possible play on survival sending all aids in stash?

Unless it was unkillable like Dogmeant was, I would leave him in my camp all safe and happy :)

In absence of that, id be happy if I could just rename my pet Deathclaw to something lol

That's so cool :)

I just spammed the "question mark" emote and other players guided me to the body. This is a much better solution if nobody guides you to it though!
---
Ya the location stuff is kinda messed I'm always getting power up a power plant in my camp and it's across the map. Also most of the location discovery challenges are bugged as well
---
Yes thats what most do, 100 stims is huge in stash unfortunately. I started a new character doing this.
---
This is a multiplayer game, very few play them to feel lonely and isolated. You can workaround the lack of a text chat, but you really shouldn't have to. Most people will just stop playing and play other games that have basic features.
---
Except even with PVP "turned off," it's still essentially on. There are a few exploits people use to override passive mode and players trying to ignore PVP.
---
Until those camp changes are made and it's a surefire thing that PVP can't be initiated regardless of whatever steps we take to avoid it, please don't attack randos in adventure mode. There's a mode specifically for PVP where you can murder to your heart's content, where nobody has any excuse to complain about getting killed. You literally have an open doorway to it. Go do it there.
---
When do we get a photomode pose that's the player holding a boombox above their head
---
I also wouldn't delete it unless I had a reliable source or replacing it.
---
Yeah, it’s saved in the application save data (your save game file) as one large lumped save data. Rather than saving it separately.
---
You can do it at just about any level. I've done it in the teens at least four times.
---
Ah, now I understand. I'll add it. Thank you.
---
I can confirm that! The vendor in the production area of the enclave (enter through the service entrance) and basically keep gong straight). The trade terminal randomly spawns with 3 -4 scout Armour pieces so if you server hope a few times you can get a whole set. (It took me about 45 minutes of hopping to get a complete set of both Forest and urban.
---
Do not put your camp on the golf course that can attract ghouls of any description. That is well and truly asking for your camp to be destroyed! 
---
I suppose that might become null soon too with the camp update, but then again they can always seek you out and attack you instead to then attack your camp?
---
Also be very careful during xp runs in nuke zones if anyone asks you to trade. Seeing your inventory for the nuke items junk can lead to them attacking you
---
Delete them as friend and add them again, this happens to me and my wife occasionally
---
It still makes the UI look cluttered and ugly and it was never marketed as a traditional multiplayer game, if people want text chat use Discord or other services but changing a company’s vision to suit needs would isolate other players that don’t like a UI full of useless info...
---
I'll add you and head in now.
---
Agree with all issues. Unfortunately this post isn't some quaint/cute tail about how someone made someone else a an in game sandwich with heart emotes(this kind of fuckery goes viral) ,so naturally, this post(and all others that discuss issues with game mechanics) won't see enough votes to make a difference. smh
---
Its best to wait till lvl 50 to get the max damage. Same goes for All rise, daisy cutter.
---
They might. But given this is a game designed to be played over years, I'd bet that's waaay down the road. I'd be happy to be wrong.
---
Cool, accepted your request.
---
It is the same case as sledgehammer bs. Supersledge. They look the same but are totally different. Dont share mods. Different stats.
---
Saying it looks cluttered and ugly when it isn't even implemented. Imagine reddit without comments, that is the shell of a game that fallout 76 is.
---
It's a bug, l2p issue or OP is full of shit. 
---
Judging by the other 3000 posts about this with absolutely zero video evidence so far, I will pick the third.
---
I read a post that claimed that if you want to move your camp and accept the first position it shows in front of you then you get charged the quoted rate. However the poster claimed that if you fiddle with it and wander about looking for the perfect spot (as you do!) Then the cost escalates. I haven't had chance to try this yet as I am not ready to move.
---
I don't mind the tax so much as... not really understand it.
---
To clarify, I understand why a tax is necessary. I do not understand why it's being applied to player vending, but when you have the same trade face to face there's no tax
---
Is the vending machine secretly sentient and taking a cut? Are people whittling wooden caps and using those? ~~can the difference be made up in wood scraps if so?~~
---
We can trade it amongst players so I dont see why we couldn't with player vending. Thatd be like if we couldn't sell plans.
---
You miss the point of the game if you think the aftermath of the worlds annihilation should be ‘social’ 
---
Show me one UI screenshot from any other game where it doesn’t look cluttered and obscure the view of the player?
---
Sorry my opinion differs from yours, live with the fact that the world is full of different and diverse people who can co exist whilst not agreeing ok everything! I’m not going to reply to any further posts and you won’t change my mind.
---
Ok I have my camera on my other character, so ill be back in a moment!
---
the explosive part is what kills the enemies. the crit lets each pellet land centre mass.
---
If you're doing it for the weapon, I agree. But the weapon isn't that great, and probably not worth locking yourself out of the associated faction for 30 levels. But if you really like missile launchers...
---
That's what Farcry 2 did.  The lower condition your gun got the worse it looked, IIRC there was no hud indication and if you kept firing a bad condition weapon it would break and you'd take damage from getting hit in the face by the upper receiver.
---
Okay go do the same exact thing I've done with your bloodied melee build. Same speed, same amount of healing items. Explosive shotguns farm the fastest without question.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
To you too! Happy to help with the photos next time too.
---
I've been totally ignoring all locks for perhaps 30 levels because of this, it's just not worth the switch out time..but if what you say is true, hmm..
---
Definitely interested in this, I'm 50, my best mate 45 and we need more friends, levels 118 and 78 respectively
---
Great idea, will try it out later 👍
---
Put settings to lowest. Open 2 Fallout76.exe. Trade with mule. Its incredibly easy.
---
Assassins sent or Cav, unyealding is good but you are a glasscanon if you rock a bloodied build. 
---
Me as a melee goes with Assassins cav + the perkcards to stack that resistence. Basicly imortal when i run, but if somone vatscrit in the head, you die quite fast despite cav or sent. I have not tried bolstering yet in pvp, might work, and might not work.
---
Ok from what I gather it's good for like half walls and low rises bc it's hell on budget but using the footlockers sideways you CAN put a rug on top of it perpendicular and it will act as a step. You can rotate the footlocker and may to make spiral stairs. Note it will look kinda wonky but will be functional. 
---
Happy building wastelanders
---
Swagdaddy42069 "The Cockpuncher"*
---
^*"The ^Cockpuncher" ^title ^is ^unlocked ^by ^killing ^76 ^chickens ^with ^punching ^attacks
---
There is a mod that adds it in the game though idk bethesda's stance on that
---
But it is tedious to force you to but repair kits.
---
Ah ok, I get it thanks
---
How tf did you not blow yourself up at the end when you fired right at your feet??
---
What weapons do you use?
---
They're not released yet... Wasnt due until the nuclear winter dlc which comes towards the end of the summer. If wild appalachia is anything to go by, Nuclear Winter will be released bit by bit in a similar fashion.
---
A good pvp build would have good few points in agility
---
I have an attack cat. He is a 25 lbs. Main Koon that has attacked dogs twice his size. We are very proud of him.
---
So I got mostly the same build 2 month before but switched to a Bloodied Melee build. I use my Explo shotguns only as a side weapon without Perks they do 250-350dmg per shot. My Bloodied Swingspeed Powerfist now with melee Perks do 2000 dmg with a normal hit haha. Tell me that shotguns are better lol
---
Also you don't need the fireproof perk that protects you from blowing your ass up with your own Explo weapons
---
My personal experience with PvP is extremely mixed. 
---
With my main character I always play Adventure Mode and there is where I find the strongest players, all with TSE weapons and marsupial mutations. 
---
On the other hand when I play Survival with my 20ish lvl character I end killing players way above my lvl. 
---
I read somewhere on this reddit the PA is not very effective in PvP, but don’t know why.
---
Dense/padded mods or/and fireproof perk.
---
In PvP no armour rating is good, you get instantly baked by God roll weapons no matter what you're wearing unless you have god roll sentinel/assassin's gear even then someone with VATS crit could still melt you. Best thing to do is just to hide and try to sneak upon other players and catch them by surprise and while running. The only legendary effects that are worth looking at are bloodied and maybe AA and everything else is trash. Most people have dense/ fireproof so forget about explosive weapons. You should focus on staggering other players with crits and your build if you want to stand a chance
---
I've noticed better loot as well.
---
Mainly a Heavy Weapons guy. My main is an Anti-Armor Gatling gun, but i also use a Tesla Rifle, Handmade Rifle and a Gatling Plasma frequently as well.
---
Yea I've had a enclave maxed lvl plasma I been holding forever... not a single mod
---
I have dense, but not fireproof. Maybe because I'm used to playing with my be shottys. Gotta be like 20 feet away for me to not be blown up with them when I'm playing at 20% health ha
---
I assume this for VATS usage, right?
---
Unyielding sentinel is good for vats . Ass/sent is good for immortality
---
Or, I can continue playing the game the way I want, and you can accept that you're playing a multiplayer game with PvP. I don't randomly attack players, and I rarely end up in PvP outside of workshops. 
---
Strange of you to assume that anyone who isn't sobbing about PvP on reddit threads is running around randomly attacking people or exploiting to initiate PvP.
---
for the ones that don't have this, I make them favorites so they pop in the list to avoid dropping/selling them
---
I didn't know about the dense/fireproof thing... I do see a lot of explosive weapons (especially shotguns). Oh well looks like a bloodied build it is then...
---
I did make a mod for pc that makes regular repairing work the way it used to.
---
How much did they go for? I never even considered selling mine. I mostly use them with Unyielding to boost my tactical helmet prices.
---
There is a mod that does enable text chat and there is some text chat stuff in the ui files but it just doesn't connect to anything
---
I just hope that they invest their time in future content and that's why the updates comming so slowly.
---
Yeah i remember when the game first came out and no-one had godly legendary gear, having PA made the fights really drawn out and exciting. I guess the Armor Penetration in the game just makes PA moot.
---
Yes gives you good ap. Then you cards which help avoid damage. Shame we can't upload images here buy my build has 15 agility and 15 perception because I focus on auto weapons. Low carisma and low intelligence with 1 strength
---
Get rid of traveling pharmacy and get 3 ranks of incisor. It'll give you insane armor penetration. Other than that it's all personal taste so that's good.
---
Blocker instead of the chem card in strenght, reduce incoming melee dmg up to 45%
---
I'd focus on the handmade and have the tesla as backup. Use commando perks and make the gun auto
---
Unfortunately that's the only viable build until Bethesda balances the other effects to make them even close to viable
---
I actually don't agree with this. Each character is supposed to be a fresh out of the vault person so of course they wouldn't know all those plans. This would also make some quests useless to do since you get plans for a lot of them
---
I can't remember. Not a LOT or anything; probably like 12 caps each? But again: I didn't need more than 200 of them in my inventory. I think I have something like 50 of them at this point, which is still a completely absurd number, considering how easy they are to make.
---
How do you get by without the carry weight?
---
Let us rent bird or lime scooters
---
You can always get 5 rank Adrenaline if your going on an xp run, especially in Whitesprings. Constantly killing Ghouls will ramp up your damage.
---
With difficulty buy it's got to be done to have a good pvp build. You can have strength if you focus on melee and I think shotguns
---
Do most enemies have armour? Cause the only ones I can think of are super mutants and feral ghoul reavers, or does this count against scorch beasts and death claws ?
---
2/3 Fireproof and dense on my chest makes my own explosives guns do 0 damage to yourself.
---
Thus would 100% change the armour meta.
---
Leveled my weapons mule to 50. Struck 4/5 weapon weight reducing armor on him. (still looking for left leg if anyone has it on PC)   
---
15 str, marsupial, radicool, and weapon weight reducing perks.  
---
I have over 3000kg of weapons on mine (370something of them) and can still fast travel. Working on acquiring uny/+1str/-20% weapon weight reduction next.
---
I just hit level 50 on my first melee build, and from what I’ve seen unless it’s a preference I’d suggest just not worrying about power Armor as you don’t need it. 
---
In terms of PvE I’ve been soloing deatchlaws and sheepsquatches and can take on hordes of ghouls/ scorchers/ mutants no issues and all just running around in leather Armor. even waited for scorchbeasts to land and taking extremely negligible damage
---
In terms of PvP I’ve had my first real experience with it today and frankly it’s a whoever gets the drop wins kind of situation so it doesn’t seem to be a negative for PvP. 
---
My current build is 
---
STR: 15 
---
- martial artist 3
---
- incisor 3
---
- barbarian 3
---
- gladiator 3
---
- expert gladiator 3
---
(Thinking of dropping incisor to 1 or 2 and getting master gladiator 1 or 2 for an extra 10 or 15%) 
---
PER: 1 
---
- whatever is there 
---
END: 10 
---
- ironclad 5
---
- fireproof 3 
---
- rejuvenated 2 
---
(end was on like 2 points until about level 30 when these cards started coming in) 
---
CHA: 4 
---
- lone wanderer 4 
---
INT: 8
---
- makeshift warrior 5
---
- first aid 3 
---
(Probably going to drop this back to 5) 
---
AGI: 12
---
- action boy 2 
---
- marathoner 3 
---
- evasive 3 
---
- moving target 3 
---
LCK: 6
---
- serendipity 3 
---
- bloody mess 3 
---
(Looking at upping luck to 9 for the vats crit) 
---
Other option would be to up AGI to 15
---
The weapon I’ve been using is ski sword, level 45 with metal shards is 176 base damage plus all the perk benefits it’s pretty crazy strong. I don’t have any legendary weapons as of yet. 
---
With no reloading and one/two hitting mob creatures it’s pretty easy going. I’m focused on getting combat or Marine Armor and then depending on what activities I’m doing having white knight to sub in when repairing Armor. 
---
Obviously if you want to power Armor then go for it and if so apologies if this hasn’t helped
---
its not about whats "better" or what does more damage. Clear speed is what im showing here. Next to nothing speed clears as fast as shotguns do.
---
This is nice a I'm not good at PvP please help. Instead of PvP is broken reeeeeee
---
Really?? Damn... think it's time to re spec. Only have 1 in endurance ha! Thanks!
---
I'm deaf, so this would be awesome for me. It's very frustrating not being able to communicate. I'm kinda forced into being the lone wanderer when I would like to join in on stuff with other players such as the Scorchbeast Queen and the fake Saskwatch etc.
---
And obviously there needs to be an inspect button on what's for sale. I will be selling power armors and since we probably won't get more stash space I will have to sell complete sets due to separate pieces weighing ridiculusly more. Do you want to buy Power Armor Chassis for 2000 caps or Power Armor Chassis for 25000 caps?
---
It's because shotguns are bugged and still deal double damage instead of 20% with the Explosive effect. But that will be fixed with next patch.
---
It's stupid.  We might as well just build floors and a few benches in survival. We can't Have camps that are decent and commit to survival the way it is
---
Once you know what your up against you can sneak through it at any level. I got a lv4 into the bunker after having someone taxi me to that side of the map.
---
yeah, that's pretty much the same reaction I had :)
---
Great to see other options for melee builds, I'm always looking to try and find ways to make my character the most powerful so this I great to see what other people are doing, I've thought about not using power armour, but the benefit of it is the extra 10 points to strength which adds and extra 10 damage, and the damage resistance which really helps when getting up close to the higher level enemies, the obvious down side is the weight of fusion cores, and using X-01 armour I get no upgrade to carry weight which sucks when I want to explore Appalachia, may have to invest in some excavator armour.
---
Lead: Lucky hole mine in Excavator PA. Stupid easy  
---
Gears. National Radio Array. 
---
Adhesive: i have no idea, i seem to always have a surplus from looting bodies and scrapping. (im not even sure what junk contains it other than glue bottles)
---
It wouldn't be better than the top tier builds, although it could have enough rad resist to wear in a nuke zone which would change that but it could be tweaked, it wouldn't be game breaking
---
Sably enough I was hoping for a machine looking like the ammo or meds vending machines at the train stations. This piece of garbage will look bad in my bar. I really wish for a nicer model in the atom shop, but they mostly just do repaints.
---
Last boss of the game??? Lmao dude there's so many fissures that don't even spawn a boss, and they will be adding them to these sites. Sheepsquatch added after sbq, imposter squatch too. Sbq at best is the first real boss of the game. If you don't like grinding go play Mario.
---
Also, is using V.A.T.S useful? I never really used it in 4, and I've barely touched it in 76, half the time I forget about it.
---
It would.
---
I loved the alien disintegrator so much.
---
But what would be better for which playstyle? I'm a bloodied be handmade user. But I've realized that maybe I might use AAE weps and different perk cards, and run an assassin's sent set, as bloodied in pvp = dying instantly.
---
I used to run with 1 as well. I always run 3/3 Adamantium Skeleton too. Without it your own shotguns will cripple you pretty often.
---
Wow, you're pleasant.
---
Not that it should matter to you, but gangs of griefers have been moving around adventure servers attacking camps, workshops and players. I've been in two large groups who have dealt with these groups of people. They go on adventure because they can't hack it on survival, and it's easier to grief on adventure. Not that I intended to accuse you of griefing (and if that's the way it sounded I apologize), but you're going to hear people whine and moan when they're just trying to enjoy the game casually, with friends, for non-pvp content or for the storyline (yes, people still play for story).
---
The game isn't a PVP game. It's a multiplayer game with PVP in it. People can play whether or not they want PVP. They shouldn't have to go in expecting  to be attacked, any less than they should go in expecting the server to crash because of dupers.
---
It's actually a light kitchen knife. You just need to switch it on.
---
Yep, I’ve got 5 industrial water purifiers unlocked and somewhere completely out of the way, I’ve noticed there’s only really 1 survival server at least where I’m based, someone’s found it and now they’re starting to destroy it. 
---
At least by chance came across them same level as me and absolutely destroyed them but now I figure I’ve got to move or store the stuff. No real point trying to up the defense on the camp 
---
It’s PvP so if someone wants to destroy your shit they should either get a wanted or you should at least be able to show up and fight back
---
How? Not allot of people are going to have the level of resources it would take to make it at it's most powerful state
---
Explosive Gauss no longer drops. Be prepared to pay a pretty cap. And a shitload of ugly ones.
---
I edit my first comment as a rough outline why.
---
I'm guessing it will be as it has more stars and is harder to get. I will finally get rid of my 3\* gamma guns and hope to get well payed for the worthless guns.
---
If you're melee VATS is a must because of the pounce (you literally jump on enemies)
---
Ha! Misdirection shitpost.
---
It needs to default to off!
---
Sorry i am missing you. Do you mean that you are looking for the plan or just  the weapon itself ?
---
Think you would need to get the plan as you would need to be able to craft the ammo as well. Is the prime for the Gatling laser difficult to find ?
---
I run a hybrid melee/shotgun stealth bloodield build on one of my toons.
---
Yes, my unarmed damage is significantly higher but I still need sneak up to every single enemy and be very aware of my surroundings. Arguably is a more engaging playstyle but in terms of 'clearing the room' is nowhere near as effective as the shotgun.
---
I don't even need VATS like Glorf. I aim in the general direction of the mobs and the blast plus the splash damage, boosted by adrenal/bloodied etc and multiplied by covert operative does the rest.
---
Now they are going to castrate the splash damage, because is a bug and needs fixing.
---
No arguing there if that is the case.
---
Thing is, bugs like this make out for other bugs - case in point dropping stealth for no reason and having to server hop/relog to fix it or stealth damage multiplier not applying because there is someone not in your faction engaged in combat too - that are not even acknowledged, let alone fixed.
---
'Well this is shit but at least my shotgun is amazing' is the kind of thing that keeps one going.
---
If you give everything that is amazing the 'meh' treatment, because 'bug fixing', and you don't address what is frustrating, because reasons?, is tricky to keep going.
---
I can deal with crippling, but blowing myself up is getting old now. Especially doing west tec runs! Like that at the end wouldve been where I just do a kamikaze and hope it doesn't freeze when I try and re enter the building ha!
---
we cant stress this anough. Cant be so difficult to realise...
---
I've disabled the ingame chat almost all the time because most time one hear only garbage noises .oO( did the guy who abuse his girlfriend realise his mic is on or does he just dont care anyone in the area can hear him? )
---
Blimey. That's some play time right there.
---
So the barbarian perk gives you an extra 60 dmg resistance at STR15, evasive an extra 30-45 DMG and Energy resistance, and moving target 45 damage and energy resistance while running (so when you sprint towards enemies shooting at you) depending on how much AGI. I don’t know the value of the power Armor resistance but other than the extra strength that it gives you, these cards give huge base Armor benefit. Because it’s a pure melee build I haven’t really run in to any issues with carry weight, and because you don’t need the cores or any heavy weapon options ie missiles there’s also more stash room 
---
How does the strength multiplier work for damage? Is it literally just +10 base damage?
---
Brilliant idea! Just like the Fo4 companion but put a new text chat tab in it
---
Yes! Was thinking this again for the 20th time last night, we need to be able to communicate with other players and a pip boy phone app would make so much sense.
---
I'm not a fan of mics but bought one just for this issue, except it doesn't work with FO76, because .... looking at you Bethesda.
---
And the endless stagger status.
---
Except many people have issues with mics not working in FO76, me included. It's a pain in the ass
---
A much needed nerf. Laser Explosives will be next.
---
Sadly enough I do believe this will be true. Hours of serverhopping to get that thing you want. Extremely boring and not really any better than farming for the legendaries in the first place. That would make this whole thing kind of pointless.
---
I don’t really touch it either, I only really use it if disorientated in PvE when you’re in the middle of everything, sometimes helpful against legendaries, and I’ve noticed the PvP when you get melted in one shot apparently it’s VATS crit related, so I can’t really say whether it creates much benefit atm 
---
Though if it with better criticals there’s and additional 40% damage I can imagine that’ll be helpful for some legendaries, don’t really know though I’m not fully sold on it, which is why I might put the extra 3 in to agility and do Adrenalin perk for PvE
---
'Bethesda' and 'fixing shit' don't really go hand in hand. But I appreciate your optimism.
---
Ironically I've never actually had either of mine happen to me, but I've seen it enough
---
A bug? In a Bethesda game? Surely not!
---
Yeah, I encounter this one every time I play. I just sell something anyway because I know it'll wake up.
---
Whatever she isn't my mom, hell she ran away in the middle of the night not caring enough to see us out after 25 years together!  Go to Silo Alpha and hear what she really thinks about all of us!
---
"You're." The word is "you're."
---
You insult and attack others when they say something you disagree with. That only tells me you're deeply insecure and your insecurities are controlling you to the point that they dictate the content of your Reddit comments.
---
Good luck with that crippling self-esteem issue, whatever it is. Because luck is what you'll need if you think trolling folks is going to make you feel better for a meaningful amount of time.
---
The economy has crashed. Legendary items don't sell for caps anymore, just trades. 25000 caps is too little to buy you even mid tier legendaries. Making good legendaries more readily available would have the effect of making them sell for caps again and making caps more valuable.
---
I think making good legendaries more available would restore the economy, not crash it.
---
Like if u crii everytime
---
But it is currently the last boss of the game. The one you fight after finishing the main quest. 
---
Are you legit that stupid? 
---
The sheepsquatch is certainly not the last boss of anything since it's a random encounter. The impostor is a boss, but certainly not the main. 
---
And I didn't complain about grinding, OP did. Maybe take a class in analysis and reading could help you.
---
But it is a multiplayer. Bethesda own blurb says "Work together, or not", we get to choose how we play and communication is essential if you want to play effectively with others. Not everyone wants to or can use a mic and the inability to talk to other players is game limiting and will push some players away.
---
One explanation is that we as players suck at building stuff and our machines mangle and destroy 10% of the caps put into them.  Think about it, our rifles break after a few hundred rounds go through them and we rarely do any sort of preventative maintenance on anything.
---
Yeah that's true. Maybe I don't agree too this because all my shotguns got Sniper accurate even when I starting hip fire. Everything that can mod the hip fire precision is equipped so all bullets hits at 1 point. My DB gives headshots with all bullets at every range that's why I clean out a room much faster with my Bloodied ss bowie or Powerfist. Just sprinting into the room  hack and slay everything down with 1 hit and when you got SS on a bowie it's  like a ripper lol
---
Heavy robot is like 55 physical chest 27 physical limbs with  alloy modded on them so it's not too far off but it would have to come down a little and probably get rid of the 50 gains for the day 5 
---
I'm moreso pitching the concept here, I came up with it on my lunch break pulling numbers out of my ass basically. But if someone where to refine the idea and balance it out, probably step that DR% down to around 5 or 10 maybe it would work. It need some standout qualities to make people interested in it and want to go for it but not too good that everyone feels like they need it or can't be successful without it
---
But why?
---
Why do you care so much that I take one shell less to kill the Super Mutant du jour?
---
Why something I find fun and does not affect your fun in any shape or form is a 'much needed nerf'.
---
Does it annoy you that I am having fun? Does it irk you that I can kill mob 'x' in two shots instead of three? I play on my own, I bother no one. 99.9% of the players have never met me and never will.
---
If is the existence of the weapon itself you have a choice, you can choose to use something else. I cannot choose to 'un-nerf' it though, at least until finally we have private servers.
---
If is the fact that I am using it and enjoying using it?, can't really help with that. The devs can of course, help I mean with that particular one and they seem to be going to do just that so you can pat yourself on the back I guess.
---
I think it sounds like they are adding a few defined displays like the bobblehead stand in FO4 and the magazine racks, nothing else. No telephones on the desk or fans on the bookshelf.
---
How to totally miss the point: the comment.
---
You realize PvP exists in this game, and many people play it, right?
---
I'd put that bar right below the AP bar and takes about 50% of the AP bar space from the right.
---
does what it says on the tin
---
Interesting, that sounds like better placement. Or we could choose where to place our hud elements but that would take longer
---
Good ol pirates! Indeed
---
I know that PvP exists but if that is the whole point of your comment conversely you do realise that PvE exists and that many people play it right?
---
Why woudl everything have to be 'balanced' for PvP in mind when PvE is as much part of the game as PvP?
---
What?
---
Favorite weapon amd pull up the favorites wheel and it shows condition, it's what I do.
---
i've seen you state this on a couple of posts..  where have you got 7th may from?  have you got a source / link?  i'm not saying you're wrong, i'm just eager to confirm it!
---
(and "juicehead" is not a source; it's the fact he has stated it in a video that has got me looking for confirmation)..
---
thanks..
---
Good workaround, I do the same, having both makes it better
---
100%, I want food, water and weapon conditions to be permanently toggleable on screen.
---
Yes, and options to make them transparent as well
---
especially considering this is no ordinary online game, but it's quite peculiar
---
Yes please!!!
---
it does excactly what it says that it will do. other perks etc,give boost at night such as mr sandman,come in to effect at night. simples
---
Exactly that reason, break away from the mould a little, plus I can’t begin to explain how exciting it was when I was younger to be able to add each bobblehead to the stand as I progressed, it was also my very first Xbox game so everything was exciting!
---
Gotcha! Cant qant to check it out. I thought my dreams came true and we cpuod Jbe main camps and little pop up shops too.
---
Really? What system are you on? If it’s PC then the error is probably with the software / drivers not installed correctly or conflicting with other software.... I just plug my headset in and talk, set it to Area for random encounters and Team for in team chat...
---
if its a weapon, look at the stats. it will tell you.
---
The syringer cannot spawn with legendary tags!
---
On PC you can use this:
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148) 
---
With this, you can't sell or drop or scrap any favorited or equipped item
---
And is PvE a valid excuse to not balance weapons?
---
Because right now, Explosive shotguns are doing, *on accident* 180% more damage than other Explosive weapons. 
---
I get it. I really do. Baby likes his shotgun. But baby has to understand that his shotgun needs to be balanced like the rest of the weapons.
---
There's a real risk of low end legendaries disappearing while high end will still be unattainable. My guess would be that we will be able to buy mid legendaries not quite up to standard with what we really want like the ones on challenges in survival. It would make it basically useless for end game players. Still, randomly generated legendaries would require you to severhop like for those X01 mods.
---
Ok, if you physically cannot talk to others due to a disability (presumably that’s what you meant right?) then, yeah typing in an optional chat window that could be turned on or off would be useful.
---
However, the majority can talk and it would clutter the UI and take away from the experience for many too!
---
I presume you’ve seen Minecraft and World of Warcraft’s onscreen chat, scrolls too fast to read, looks awful and ruins the experience?
---
Legendary tokens are not able to be traded between characters/other players.
---
Did anybody get video?  I was laughing too hard..
---
ah hold on a tic. increases during the night,but correct,doesn't tell by how much.
---
I suppose we could test it,look at the stats during day/night.
---
had these come up before,but chucked them.
---
No, you don't.
---
Baby uses his shotgun as a crutch, to make up for the fact that baby keeps dropping of stealth for no reason and needs to server hop to fix it, and apparently this doesn't need bug fixing.
---
Or to make up for the fact that baby has a sweet PA VATS build that due to another unfortunate bug that doesn't need fixing chomps through fusion cores.
---
Or that baby has not had a daily in The Mire for three months across four different characters, another bug that doesn't need fixing.
---
And other 100+ bugs that are grinding baby down and none of them need fixing.
---
But I have to empathise that the couple of things baby find actually fun, may they be as broken and the one baby finds un-fun, have to be taken away because the grown-ups want to do pew pew.
---
Don't accept random friend requests, especially if they're not even in your vicinity; chances are they want to see where your camp is so they can destroy it.
---
Until passive camps is released in the next patch, store decon showers when not in use, as they require one of each stable flux (in addition to other materials) to repair.
---
Grenades break too fast, feels like after i throw it it's consumed.
---
For QOL 
---
How about a bulk all option.
---
And
---
I'd like to bulk silver, gold, titanium (can buy bulk solver and gold) but not bulk it?
---
Some details on what PA mods will do during the buying and building options would be nice.
---
More skins for weapons and armour - chrome whould be nice or field grey.
---
Timer on events so i dont pay to travel to them just as they end.
---
And an option to wipe perk cards and rebuild them, i have so many maxed duplicates now its crazy.
---
More addons for the crossbow.  Lazer marker, scope, ratchet fast reloaded etc.
---
You have a drill but no nail gun?
---
Ability to make screws / springs / lockpicks
---
How about being able to craft or find and reuse solar panels and link them to the batteries we collect.
---
...
---
They're not that bad actually. Yeah they're only usable at night but if you only you them during the night these weapons are really decent
---
Awks. Well I hope it gets changed soon.
---
I’m currently writing in a journal irl from my characters perspective from the beginning of the game to now. Through main quests and side quests.
---
Make a new post on it mate, that’s what I’d recommend. Oh and do it on an active time as well
---
Theres a mod for it on PC.
---
Well, baby is about to lose his crutch. But baby will be fine, I promise.
---
Not a lot for me. Nice addition, more content coming after that. In it for the long stretch.
---
So dramatic... it's just a fucking trading platform. It's not gonna break or make anything.
---
I understand your view. But not me. There’s still so much in the game I want to do. And by the time I do it there will be more content.  I have like 30 1 and 2 star items to break down next week. Maybe I’ll try selling the 3 stars to players instead of waiting for the vendor later in the month.
---
There is no sure location or method for items or legendary effects. For 1\*, farm Whitesprings as much as you can due to the legendary density. 
---
Keep weapons with the desired type or desired legendary effect in your stash and it will increase the chance of seeing that type of weapon. You can also buy a crappy gun from a vendor for this. For example, you see a Two Shot Pipe Pistol, buy it and stash it. If you see a Nocturnal Handmade, buy it and stash it. I have some Gatling Guns stashed and get one with 1:62 chance. I also have a bunch of Handmades and get one with 1:115 - i.e., I have to kill 62/115 legendaries on average to get one.
---
Note tough that every legendary enemy can drop any legendary loot from a table of 200 items, half of it is armor and only a quarter is ranged weapons. That is 1:200 for a particular item such as Handmade by default.
---
I have a mule account.  
---
I bought an extra account/key for the game (they're still on sale lots of places). Then you just launch the game, tab out and launch it again (via the exe, not the bethesda launcher). You can then alt+tab between clients. Send friend requests so you can get your accounts on friends list, join sessions there. Only trouble is that they use the same .ini - I'd like to use another for the 2nd account, so I could drag the window to a 2nd monitor instead of having to alt+tab.
---
Everyone says they'll quit when something new happens.  In reality very few actually do.  I have been playing since B.E.T.A., usually around 8-10 hours a day, and could not give less of a shit if someone is able to get their dream gear without a shit ton of grind.  I am retired and have time to kill, others have work and kids and can't spend every waking hour in game.  I would like them to be able to enjoy this game to the fullest, feel like they are contributing to the ISQ or SBQ fights and in general make our community a better place even though they don't have multiple hours to grind out content.

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4gWcpeopiSywMb5GCpPAem/inside-the-vault-new-survival-challenge-rewards-and-more-april-18-2019 ADVENTURE MODE C.A.M.P. DAMAGE PROTECTIONS
---
When we originally launched the Survival Beta with Patch 7.5 last month, we made an Adventure Mode change to prevent you from taking attack damage from players you are not hostile against (a.k.a. “slap” damage). At that time, we had also mentioned that we planned to bring similar damage protections to Adventure Mode players’ C.A.M.P.s in the future. This is a change that will prevent other players’ attacks from dealing damage to objects and structures you’ve built in your C.A.M.P. so long as you (or your Turrets) are not hostile against those players. We’re excited to let you know that we’re currently planning to roll this out with Patch 9 in early May.
---
Patch 9 releases on May 7.
---
Baby is always fine.
---
Baby has adapted through six months, 1300 hours, 10 fully developed toons, and five accounts.
---
However baby is up to here with the grown ups and wishes they would go away and leave him be, same as he does with the grown-ups.
---
The SBQ no longer scales with the number of players since Patch 8. This has been confirmed via data mining and in-game experience.
---
Would you be willing to PM me the list you have?  I'll share it with some very good friends of mine.  :)
---
I think player vending is gonna be pretty much a game changer, though i feel like since it makes caps even easier to get, it'll make them even more worthless, so i am a little bit worried about the economy. Tje legendary vendor on the other hand sounds very interesting as well but i wouldn't expect too much otherwise you'll probably be disappointed. I don't think it'll make it much easier to get good legendaries. But that's just what i think.
---
Sometimes damage doesn't register on her. Did you see the hit indicator around your crosshair (assuming you are ranged)?
---
That road map is for the whole year.  They’re still coming. But you can enjoy hunting sheepsquatch if you haven’t yet!
---
same, I dont think its going to go well.
---
I have noticed that. Super mutants seem to spot  me crouched in the bushes after one shot with a silencer. May as well not have it. Maybe they are all experts at ballistic forensics and can determine the trajectory of a shot of one of their comrades instantly. Hmmmm
---
nice, thanks!
---
as to the time, actually, Iv'e looked for the in game time,but not found. Between 6pm and 6am,fine, but whats the actual time ?????????
---
Awesome!!! Love it
---
Doesn’t get much better than that
---
I'll have to lockpick tonight and see. I have been ignoring locks for some time now. Thanks for the heads up I hope what you say is true
---
But i can stab them without noticing? :D
---
I spend 4hours plaing, i had 20 reasons to delete this game, like there will be always something that will suprise me.
---
Unfortunately, your toy interferes with the grown-ups business.
---
Make it that you need to learn a plan again so it's account wide. 1x only char 2x account
---
What do you mean by actual time? I think the ingame time is different from server to server
---
Are you in Power Armor?
---
A bloodied Mr. Handy clears amazingly fast and you never have to stand still or worry about anything. Does AoE dmg aswell
---
I feel like this game is where Diablo 3 was in the beginning when it concerns loot. In Diablo 3, at the start, more people "played the auction house" game than the actual game itself. It was killing Diablo. The made the bold decision to get rid of both auction houses (they had a real money and fake money auction house), and then they significantly upped the drop rate of legendaries. They were guaranteed to drop single and even multiple times on certain events and/or kills. This saved the game. It was still a grind to find the perfect weapon or armor slot, but you would upgrade you current gear more often. You felt like you were stikk progressing as a character even if you didn't find the perfect item. Imo, they need to do the same in Fallout 76.
---
Yes, multiple times. Idk, i think it's because i did low damage to her.
---
I believe a Bethesda employee commented and said Script can’t be traded.
---
got a point there. try the sneak to evade perk card. Iv'e had them within 2 mtrs and they can't see me.
---
My house doesn't even have 4 walls
---
Are you fn serious? This is post nuclear apocalypse and your worried about the effects of plastic on the environment? Just kill me now....
---
Beta...200! It was a nightmare. I filled up the first day.
---
I meant caps will not play a roll in the legendary vendor. They will still be part of the game.
---
I'd like to see them tax 10% on 1cap as that is what I'm going to sell all my gear at - hahahahah sticking it to the man
---
How are good weapons cheap? They're ridiculously expensive
---
At this point we have hit an impasse.
---
Just rest assured that the devs are on your side which I guess makes my plea just a rant because there is sweet fuck all I can do about it except adapt again.
---
I hope the strategy does pay off though and people with your preferences feel looked after and remain engaged because I am still eagerly awaiting private servers and much looking forward to the next single player game.
---
See, that’s a you problem. This game wasn’t designed or intended to be a grind legendary items kind of game. The fact that you’ve had a hard time being successful at it should have been a clue, but here we are, with hundreds of people just like you expecting something else, and demanding it be “fixed” to their wishes.
---
The hills have eyes.
---
good call there. I've used one of these a long time ago and remember it being super fast and fun. really durable too. might revisit. thanks for the tip!
---
I don't have any friends or friend requests and the game still lags for me for months on PC. Yesterday, I was at a nuked Whitesprings standing next to a door, not moving at all, looking at the pip-boy and just by other people jumping around made my game lag a lot. I think it is related to the game using too much memory and loading audio over and over without caching.
---
The repair kits are quest reward not Queen loot
---
Wouldn’t you need several condition bars for each worn and equipped piece? Could be why they haven’t done it.
---
He knows what you did.
---
Occasionally, some of the Enclave events rewards you with with a pre-modded one. I've seen aligned/stablized/true mods on these. You can also find their mods being sold by vendors throughout the world.
---
Wut?
---
You may find someone willing but i would never do that trade.
---
What? They’ve never done it for armor like ever, this is for weapons only. It’s stupid to do all of the pieces. Maybe a mod to make a small model showing the conditions of a piece but not official game
---
if I hop servers,then its always been the same time (ish) for me anyway,but never been able to find anything that tells me the ingame time. I like to swap out sneak with mr sandman,depending on the time of day.alright, if the stars are out its night,but whats dawn/twilight.but still forget to swap them out anyway
---
Im still playing despite the multiple kicks in teeth by BGS.  It’s pretty clear that they want this game to go down a particular route which many players are happy with.
---
For me, they are constantly chipping away at the reasons as to why I’m still playing.  I can’t put a percentage on it - if I had to think off the top of my head it’s maybe 60-40 :/
---
Vendors outside of the Enclave Bunker can sell them on occasion. You can also get pre-modded ones as a reward from Enclave events.
---
Yep, if you delete the game, they won't hear you then. 😂
---
If there wasn't PvP I wouldn't care at all.
---
Mine is modded that way... thank you though
---
I traded 1 BOS sent/ass powered piece (right leg) straight up for a tse laser rifle, so probably too much to ask.
---
But you can always ask.
---
Please everyone, don't overhype it.
---
No, it works on normal menu I’ve just discovered but not from the hotkey / circle menu - must be a bug or glitch...
---
Sorry didn’t see that it was for weapons only. Although, why is it stupid to do it for armour? I don’t recall armour degrading previously, though it’s been a long time since I’ve played f3 or 4.
---
No.  As a responsible gun owner you should periodically and properly maintain your firearm for safety and malfunctions.
---
They are on the road map for summer...
---
ark developers did it.
---
Yeah I've heard of this. It's very annoying for survival players.
---
gave up trying to analyse the mechanics.they are what they are
---
No no, armor was never in pieces till fallout 4, it was an outfit really and the best outfit was power armor or a strong combat armor, two pieces being the helmet and main outfit, fallout 4 removes degrading and made it more modular. I’d said it be stupid to have those pieces around cause it would clutter the hud potentially.
---
I bet its going to just be like any vendor but you just trade the legendary vouchers instead of caps. There will be no good weapons ever like how we never see calibrated shocks. Still have high hopes tho.
---
The thing is explosive lasers are gonna keep going up in value due to the fact they are now a finite weapon, if I was lucky enough to have one I would keep it for like a year and then trade it for a massive amount of value.
---
Yeah i tried with a friend last nightand it just doesn't work. Not even free atoms move people. Too bad because it's fun and with zero risks.
---
Also at this point the challenge should be to participate, not win.
---
It will be a long wait.
---
Silently judging you...
---
In a new mode or survival, most definetly, add somewhat realism and weapon jamming in conditions. I’m in Australia and we got rid of our guns long ago tho
---
Yeah go away your negativity isn't making the game better. And ff you come back in some years and the game still exists don't write a post like ''is this game worth it again!?'', instead read the patchnotes and play the game yourself.
---
40-50? I only get 20! (PS4)
---
Is it a flick knife? 😂
---
Your pip boy tells you the time.
---
Do you think I would be still here after all this strife, going to the extent of creating my own functional party or four after all my friends went back to modding FO4/Skyrim, if I wouldn't be a patient baby?
---
No, it doesn’t work that way, it only applies for your current weapon equipped
---
Really, you should be **happy**. They said the shotgun was doing more damage than was being displayed, so they fixed that bug for you.
---
Go to Mountainside bed and breakfast down by the train cars there is always a static spawn of 2 Yao Guai's kill them server hop and keep repeating.
---
I agree on this, i'm forced to play alone since i cannot use a mic everytime :(
---
I agree, u wana start again, well, start again
---
I think that’s why I am so hopeful for the game and I stick around even after being annoyed sometimes by stability flaws. I’ve been waiting for a unique game to come out. This is the first one that I can say is unique since rainbow six siege.
---
If you don't want to randomly die don't own workshops at all, if you take them for plans or challenges leave the world entirely. An owned workshop is super easy to exploit for the purpose of killing the owner, wherever they are.
---
Im with you OP.
---
Also using "I need more luck so dont so that" is a ridiculously bad argument - these take over slots at luck tree. I'd prefer to respec to find 5 points to put into endurance, so that my luck character could have 15 perk points spent on combat, instead of the bare-minimum 10 or the excentric 13.
---
And when our Camp was only a hole in the ground covered by a piece of tarpolin!
---
*soon*
---
There hasn't been any official mention of a reroll feature.
---
The main issue is, TSE are OP without counter part.
---
For example, Melee Bloody build  can also be considered as OP at some point, but there are some big trade off
---
1) melee needs close combat
---
2) you run with very low health all the time
---
3) you need to build something that allows you to be able to tank with low health. 
---
TSE weapons are OP natively without hassle.
---
I'm sorry to hear you're stuck in limbo like that.  That really sucks.  I get the "punishment" viewpoint, and I was admittedly on that bandwagon back during the dupocalypse, but I'm also a big fan of moderation in penalties.  It feels like, at this point, they're turning a blind eye to the 'suspensions' and that's not cool.  
---
A suspension that's never lifted is a termination, you know?  Not quite a ban, which would disallow you from playing the game under another name, but still a termination.  Also, at least for console players, playing under another account is going to be expensive and extremely inconvenient.
---
Good to hear it, soldier.
---
Sadly it might be a bug with the armor. The same thing happens with radiation resist. I’ve ran into several that way 25 rad resist but doesn’t reflect. So it’s really a two star in my eyes.
---
i dont want start again i just want different builds
---
Did I play in a band with you?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/RCryhtD](https://imgur.com/a/RCryhtD)
---
I got to keep mine. I even sent a ticket in to Bethesda because around the same time that I duped that item by accident I also lost a few things in my inventory Bethesda basically told me there's nothing they can do about individual items so they couldn't replace the items I lost but they told me just to keep the item that was accidentally duped.. so bonus I have an extra be gauss
---
Yes please!   
---
Countless times I've run into Legendary enemies who have several stars, which as a level 26, I CAN NOT KILL!   
---
I've invited people to my game, to try and get them to come to me, all decline and go on there merry way. Missed out on a lot of legendary items because of this
---
Sadly that is the one bug that didn't bother me.
---
There are a 100+ that do though - to put it in perspective I have a sweet sweet robot armor arm that dropped for me 5 months ago and despite numerous reports they still have not added the relevant ma keyword to the ARMO record so that particular flavour of armor can be modded - but these don't bother the devs.
---
Is hard to empathise with others when one's 'cause' is not just met with a distinct lack of empathy but also with condescension.
---
Said that in this case it doesn't matter. As said before the devs have your back all the way.
---
Have you had time to look into this yet?
---
Abraham Lincoln Scorched Hunter
---
ye think it must be I logged out and back in and it worked so hopefully it stays working thank you
---
lol this isn't real content. Dunno why it would matter one way or the other. this reads like all the other "this better be good" posts people make every patch
---
Mothpersons do.
---
Soo... I can build a nice bar with antique furniture and beautiful mirrors and chairs, but when I want to sell stuff I go looking for the worst looking burnt out trash I can find to put my stuff for sale in. It looks AWFUL! Please make a better looking version in the same way as there are several versions of the cooking station. We NEED this.
---
Wrong
---
I hope so. I hate buying armor and it’s bugged to the point of not working.
---
That's a good tip. Here's one for those who are just starting to get their feet wet in the savage divide: There's a tiny Raiders camp next to the train station at the Top of the World. There's a random mix of enemies that spawn there, with levels anywhere from 14 to maybe  60 something (you can pick em off from the little defense post at the station). A random plan spawns in a display case next to a metal helmet. It has consistently given me an interesting plan (got wooden desks last time).
---
Fixed with skins, when you skin an item, eg currently cammo it is not shown in the vendor list.  But we need more skins.
---
oh suger............If thats staring me in the face........................................................................................................................................bugger
---
Pretty sure sheepsquatch fur is BF.
---
It is surprisingly effective. I now run silos with an Executioner's Handmade instead of a Troubleshooter's Handmade. Somehow it chews through the high level Gutsies and Assaultron's first 60% more effectively. I suspect with Tormentor 3, getting the limbs damaged below 40%, even if the full health is still above 40% enables the damage boost to the entire body.
---
That's a great tip thanks!
---
Yeah it's gonna be a while before we finish the road map. Not even done with the first third of it
---
You mean the mothman?  That's rare..
---
I don't understand anything
---
I see your a fellow nukaCHAD...
---
I did find one out in the wilds sitting in an abandoned camp.
---
I never checked for dangly bits. Yeah. They are rare. But they do drop them.
---
as pointless as I think it is in the game because literally all it is is for people who are too scared to talk and I don't understand why you're too scared to talk because it's not like you're even around these people are meeting these people you're in your house by yourself most likely talking to a mic.
---
But if you are really smart you get Bethesda to do this by the next patch guaranteed.  
---
How you might ask simply point out to them that not having text chat in the game prevents mute people from being able to communicate. As of right now they're violating basic human rights why not allowing this one disable the group the ability to communicate in the game.
---
Just remind them that there's mute players who play the game you can't talk that there is no text chat the same as voice chat can you have major game in a way that prevents disabled people from playing and goes against human rights..
---
I assume they're actually referring to armour
---
Yep.
---
It's better to find another enemy or junk items I would say.
---
Assassin sent won't save you if you run bloodied. A crit headshot will still do enough damage to kill you. 
---
So either run unyielding bloodied for a glass cannon build or run assassin sent aae for more survival.
---
Would explain why they can take so much damage
---
No volume control on your TV ?
---
Most likely.
---
Judging you for crimes
---
I really am not going there at all. It makes no difference to anyone if I play or not.
---
I am curious of how Bethesda is going to keep players going with this game. I am not certain that "monster of the month" will do it alone. Unless this is how things work in this sort of game. I havent played any other online games in this vein (WoW, etc.).
---
Well im looking forward to it, as the hassle of looking up 'shop' posts over the multiplayer board on live to peruse, then having to join the world and find its full is frustrating :/
---
Now I can just see any shops on the map :)
---
I've tried really hard to make 800 work and for the most part it has. I do think it's time tho for at least a bump to 1200.
---
Fight Sheepsquatch or loot Fort Defiance.

---
Honestly, she should have a chance to drop legendary weapons unique to her, maybe a scorchbeast gauntlet or wing armour or something. Actually, so should all rare enemies. I've fought about 3 mothmen since release and they drop bugger all.
---
If you can't talk while your kids are sleeping in the house then your kids and you are going to have a lot more problems when they grow up...  ( No knocking parenting just pointing out that we develop sleep patterns and habits one more level and if you're always used to it being perfectly quiet the rest of your life any little noise will wake you up)
---
Unfortunately for baby, this is a game for everyone. If the one thing baby uses happens to be overpowered, that’s great for baby. But it’s bad for the game. 
---
You say your power doesn’t affect other players, but this just isn’t true. And I’m not even talking about pvp, which obviously needs to be balanced to actually work. If you have an unfair advantage, that means everyone else has an unfair disadvantage. You’re killing things with less shots, farming items faster, and all just because the game isn’t designed properly. Again, great for baby, but equally shitty for anyone who doesn’t use the OP thing. 
---
If baby wants to be OP, go play GTA and turn on god mode. It’s really not fair to compromise the entire game for everyone just so some people can have their selfish desires.
---
I got incredibly frustrated with the stealth system, every other day it is broken one way or another (rifle stealth- every possible perk card) everything from spotted a huge distance and haven’t fired a bullet to permanent “danger” etc. however this all changed when I swapped my 3* Chameleon/stealth on hit armors to minimum 1* unyielding. Now I can be sitting on their heads and not be seen (no chameleon effects or any mutations). Unyielding has been the only effect that (to me) has made range stealth viable again.
---
yeah so far so good fingers crossed for both of us
---
Are you on PS4?
---
I've seen a lot of people mentioning the weight reduction legendary modifiers have been having issues. I want to say since the Burrows was added?
---
But yeah, I think they're been a bit finicky.
---
I'm on Xbox and have the same issue. I found that if I join someone's game through an invite or the Xbox interface (while already in a server), my weapon weight armors won't work. If you leave the server THEN join an invite, the armors work fine.
---
Same too its really going to change the community I cant wait!!
---
Yeah.  I now regret essentially naming two of my characters mule1 and mule2.  Now that I have leveled them a bit and they have their own lives, I feel like they've earned proper names.
---
Intriguing. I've been collecting those recipes but progress has been slow since they are expensive to by. I want to make all the healing and chems for new players!
---
This tip may certainly help me in this endeavour. Thanks a lot!
---
Disapproving Mothman sees your act of hubris and disapproves.

Your not chaining crits. Chaining crits is when you proc a crit off of the previous crit. Watching the video, that never happens. You are procing a crit off of the shit following the crit or the second shot following the crit. My guess is that you have a 15+ in luck. With better criticals that automatically yields a crit every 3rd shot. If you do have a 15+ luck four leaf clover is a waste of ranks.
---
thanks for the heads up brother
---
Open concept, nice
---
I can craft you a full set of deep pocketed armor if you want it.
---
No no no no no
---
Amazing capture.
---
Why are you such a gigantic asshole? 
---
Games need endgame content in order to retain their playerbase. Right now, endgame content is farming legendaries. Bethesda realizes this, hence, the legendary vendor. 
---
Get off your fucking high horse and stop being overtly hostile just because people have put more time into a game than you have.
---
hopefully they fix this after the next update
---
Interesting. Thanks for sharing.
---
Yeah saw the update on that
---
Fingers crossed. I'm happy to be able to use mods against, that's for sure.
---
The guy wanted to farm ghouls there but I didn't feel like spending 20min at one event
---
Good to know, I'll check it cause I've been searching for Buffout recipe for months. Maybe that's the place :)
---
Well written. I did some basic searching yesterday after I posted this trying to find the original comments that spurred the reroll idea. I thought there was something they said that was a little more on those lines but I couldn't find it.
---
Seeing that picture with a damn slot machine showing, and again, if you guys haven't looked look at the things I circled one of them is Big sticker of a lady playing at a slot machine, and then actual slot machine mechanics on the device, it's not like it can't have multiple or functions.
---
I forgot to write it but the other thing that set me off on this tangent is look at the remote that the player is using. Just like somebody hitting the jackpot on a slot machine.
---
yeah that was a bad one that bug . people where selling mods then other people couldn't use them and blaming the buyer which is ludacris
---
Or buy bulk from vendor... but no there isn't many things that drop BF
---
ok so I should stock pile 556.s at 1 cap a piece :) thanks guys
---
I am guessing you use power armor? Regular armor breaks pretty damn fast without white knight, it wasn't bad with it but I haven't been outside a suit of power armor since they nerfed it so I don't know how it is now. Power armor on the other hand never seems to break.
---
Aww, did I hurt your feelings.  :p
---
Ill do whatever i damn want, i wont let griefers keep me down
---
What did they change exactly?
---
Launch was pretty catastrophic. Thankfully Bethesda have ironed out some of the major problems. I've definitely had a laugh playing with my mate. Glad I picked it up super cheap.
---
And your poor choice of play doesn't decide what the devs do.  Your point?
---
Your time will come
---
Honestly I have no clue how it's gonna go, cause too many people want to trade for a certain item these days instead of for caps. Which is honestly super annoying, imo, but whatever
---
Because it's a God damn multiplayer game. Not only is it a fucking nightmare getting 1 shotted as soon as you engage in combat, but it can also fuck up PVE events. It's not fun for anyone when some dickhead turns up in heart of the swamp or the sheepsquatch and just one shots the enemy. Even worse in a nuke zone when they immediately kill any legendary before you can get a hit in. 
---
In a multiplayer game they need to balance it so EVERYONE can have fun, not just YOUR selfish ass.
---
Definitely! A fair boost in difficulty, more organic PVP and also some of the changes will open up the door to more player interactions beyond murder.
---
If you are using a gun with explosive bullets, the silencer is worthless.
---
I don't want to play anymore
---
I remember building that green footlocker as a stashbox in the ammo factory last year. Back then it got destroyed by the attacking scorchbeast gassing the whole place while I was reloading my dragon inside.
---
I had one day where I crashed a lot. More than any other day. I checked the Bethesda support and it recommended power cycling as the first port of call. Literally just turn off the console, unplug at the mains, give it 10 seconds, plug it back in and go.
---
That solved the bulk of my crashing. Guessing something fucked up in some temporary memory. If you're still having problems I think you then move on to rebuilding database and / or reinstalling.
---
Best gun is a 1* bloody 50 cal. Fire rate, aim damage, reload etc would be nice but just bloody 1* is ridiculous over kill if I'm at halfish or less hp. 2-3 shots on super mutants when in Nerd Rage range
---
Sheepsquatch mysterious fur scraps down to ballistic fibre, mothmen drop it, military grade duct tape scraps to ballistic fibre cloth and adhesive and military ammo bags yield ballistic fibre when scrapped, can’t think of any other sources off the top of my head
---
As someone who is currently carrying around 70 fusion cores, I disagree
---
Free range, sbq and fakesquatch pull the server together. Good things.
---
Other events don't. We need more "complicated" events like this. Too many people don't bother with the power plants because half the players won't touch anything related to workshops as they avoid anything remotely PVP ish (I understand how it works ... so no need to tell me it doesnt work that way ... I know ... people are weird)
---
I've never had issues with griefing from launch up until recently.  It's increased in the last two weeks.  So it should be a priority.
---
No, must have been a fellow Abe.
---
Free Range isn't really exciting to me, tbh. I'll do it if I'm nearby and not busy, but I can't really be arsed to go out of my for it.
---
I want horde mode sort of events, a bit like Uranium Fever.
---
And when this 'fix' goes in effect properly geared VATS crit builds will have an unfair advantage over my now 'gimped' shotgun build.
---
I would know because I have a toon geared that way and at the moment they go toe-to-toe, each one being better depending on the circumstances.
---
And the - unfortunately non-VATS because there aren't enough fusion cores in Appalachia to feed that ravenous hunger, if that bug were fixed then they would have to nerf it immediately after ai guess, but that doesn't make it less of a bug - heavy weapons PA build with my trusty AA Gatling doesn't lag far behind.
---
You see, the argument does fall a bit flat because changing the numbers around doesn't bring balance, just makes whatever is close and next-in-line OP.
---
So the nerfing game continues until everything is meh.
---
You may be under the impression that this is the only weapon/build I use when in fact is the one I have the most fun with and irks me to see it meh-d for nothing.
---
You're welcome
---
Dude, chill.
---
First I’ve got 650 hours in.
---
Second you’re making things up... YOU’VE chosen farming legendary items as YOUR end game that’s not a Bethesda end game. There is no “end game” with this game as it’s not intended to end, hence all the content they continue to add. 
---
Third the legendary vendor is more likely about removing the millions of in world items that people have been hoarding hence the early turn in period and the probable low exchange rate that hasn’t been announced yet.
---
Fourth your defensiveness and calling me an asshole sure is a sign you have issues. It’s you who has been hostile, and it’s likely because you know I’m right. This game wasn’t meant to be played how you’re playing it. It’s a freaking adventure game, stop grinding and start adventuring and you too can have fun again.
---
👍👍
---
Keep in mind pacifism only stops you from damaging other players.  If you capture a workshop, you can still be attacked.  Just means you can't hit back.
---
Depends on when you arrive. I recommend a Troubleshooter's or Executioner's weapon to begin with, maybe Anti-armor but the hit detection on Assaultrons and Gutsies are quite odd sometimes.
---
If the silo is "fresh" on that server, you start out with low level (8-22) robots but max level turrets (40) and as you go deeper in, the robots will max out (46-52) at the last stage.
---
If there were launches before on that server, all destroyed turrets remain destroyed and the silo will be full of level 46-52 robots from the very beginning.
---
I mostly do silo runs on my own but once (2 months ago) teamed up with someone else (who was lvl \~60); we got non-maxed turrets (28) and robots (22-38), so it was easier.
---
Some additional tips:
---
* Have at least 45 steel and 15 circuit to fix the Mainframe Cores. Don't throw them away after but fix them outside at a safe Tinker's Workbench and bring them for the next run. Saves 2 minutes.
---
* Before launching, go back to the previous room and fix your weapons and armor up before going against the SBQ for example. I'd also recommend taking off Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior/etc if your weapon is above 100% when you start so you can repair them back to max just before the launch.
---
* Destroy turrets in the rooms before progressing with the launch, saves you from potential lags during the fights.
---
* You'll get some missiles and random item when you finish the launch prep, so you could end up overencumbered.
---
* You can fast travel out, no need to run up that exit tunnel (like certain nuker youtubers do all the time).
---
* Sometimes the server lags badly, so you'll have to wait minutes and/or redo the reactor part a couple of times. It seems the more people are there in the silo (even non-team), the worse it gets.
---
I completely understand what you're saying. In an RPG with PVP the two can end up at war with one another.  
---
BGS have already decided to include PVP in the mix, more so with the current iteration of survival mode so it doesn't seem too unreasonable to flesh that out into something more balanced. We aren't talking about redesigning the game from scratch but instead rebalancing and reworking some of the existing systems to soften to gap between the god tier and the newbies.   
---
As I mentioned in my post, disabling or dramatically reducing the effects of legendary prefixes, perk cards and mutations when engaged in a PVP fight would put players on a much more even playing field. So long as they only impact PVP then PVE would not require a total rework. Some legendary effects, mutations and perk cards would probably need removing entirely from the survival mode for it to work properly when it comes to PVP engagements.
---
The current set-up simply does not work. For PVP to work everybody has to have a fighting chance for the system to be balance. Of course armour and weapon quality should impact the fight but for low level players to not feel cheated or hopeless the driving force behind the successor in a fight must be witt and skill.
---
Also to say that true hardcore survival wouldn't work in Fallout isn't necessarily true. Fallout 4 had a survival mode that was incredibly popular and the reason I bought the game after watching tons of streamers play it. Not only did many of them play the vanilla mode but many modded it to be significantly more hardcore and challenging.
---
Finally a topic on this  in the HOT area! I hope that they will see that and give some answers :x They are pretty silent about this
---
Yea but it still sucks because Im used to it being a certain way , nothing was ever said about it. I can't imagine how shitty my pump will be now that it will do half the dmg. Its not that strong to begin with but hey ill get over it. Maybe ill just stop using shotguns.
---
Only after someone have nuked something else than the queen from there.
---
Those all sound great - as long as those changes only apply to Survival mode.  Some folks like to casually play (we have kids, lives, jobs, etc), and gutting Adventure mode to accommodate these changes would not be a welcome change.
---
I want to add a thought.  As you mentioned there is a lot of gear that needs to be removed from the game.  They might make the initial system very draconian as far as exchange rates with a plan to later ease it up a bit.  I would expect them to give very little for what you give them at first rollout.
---
Nice take on the "hate the smell of moth balls" joke
---
Is it unheard of? Probably not. But I don't think it's common. Maybe I've been lucky, but I haven't experienced it, nor heard my friends complaining about it. 
---
Aside from prior recommendations, I'd maybe trying using a tinker's bench in a different location or something, see if that breaks the cycle.
---
Having a cap limit has not stopped prices getting too high. There are people paying up to 75k caps for items, that's three characters full caps loadout. And that is not people selling items, but people wanting to buy.
---
Now tell me that current limit is keeping the prices from getting too high?
---
Hello, it is a random drop from the Event.
---
I made some changes to your build
---
I saw you had 1 point left overall so i would remove 2 points from iron fist and add the last point to to strength and get martial artist. You'll lose 10% overall damage but you get a huge amount of attack speed which should outweight the dmg loss.
---
Since you are going for a bloodied build, i highly advice using unyielding gear pieces. You easily get all the charisma you need to share anything (even up to 5\*), thats why i would lower tenderizer to 1 and free up 2 points.
---
Ricochet isnt a really good talent and i would ditch that too, leaving you with 5 unspent points, which all get dumped into agi, 5\* adrenaline, 1\* marathoner, 3\*action boy/girl. Agi is also important for power attacks with melee weapons.
---
Swapping out some stuff in intelligence for nerd rage, especially the crafting related perks. Batteries included shouldnt be necessary, cuz of the massive amount of strength you have with proper gear (30+), which translates into something around 300 lbs of weightlimit (not to mention the upcoming backpack). Another 2 points you could either put into strength for barbarian or agility for evasive or dodgy (dodgy only if you dont power attack with your melee very often).
---

---
See that build as a guideline rather then something strict. If you think you could go with more def, you could lower adrenaline to 3\*, and ditch marathoner all together and put evasive 3\* AND dodgy 3\* in there. Or go with only 8 points in agi (ditch marathoner) and get barbarian to 3\*. You get my point :)
---
I knew I needed to slow my ROF on me SAW when its barrel turned red. OR have a misfire at 5%, something that's not omnipresent, but catches one's attention.
---
That's fair enough! If enemies were to become more lethal, as in deal more damage but be less bullet spongey then they would need their accuracy reducing otherwise the PVE is at risk of becoming too difficult. It was done in Fallout 4 survival mode pretty well and some modders went on to take it further making it even better.  
---
In terms of player weapon handling, I think increase in recoil for all weapons would be a good way to make PVP and PVE more interesting. Currently you can point and spray most weapons quite easily which can lead to PVP fights ending very quickly. This is a rather minor detail as far as the points I've made go though so if everything else came and this didn't I wouldn't be too disappointed.
---
Thanks for the kind words - It's good to know others are hungry for a proper survival mode!
---
Ah ok that sucks haha.
---
Was hoping because you get a level 30 version earlier in the quest, that the drop might be guaranteed.
---
\&gt; acts like a dick  
---
\&gt; "Dude chill bro you have problems man"   
---
If you don't understand what endgame means, I'm not sure I can come even remotely close to convincing you that there should be some incentive to play the game after you've explored the same areas a thousand times. Why would bethesda care about people keeping legendaries in their stashes? They're just going to be replaced with other legendaries. You are not right, about anything you've claimed, at all, even a little bit.   
---
Aside from re-building my camp a different way, helping new players, and "adventuring" (whatever the fuck that means), there needs to be some form of progression. Levels are meaningless once you've purchased all the perks you'll use. Mule toons/accounts fill up with massive stockpiles of junk. For fuck's sake, there aren't even cosmetics that are locked behind collections/etc that we can progress towards. The ONLY progression is improving your gear, which means farming legendaries.
---
The laundry hampers in WS spa seem to always have above average loot
---
Narrator's voice: those were his famous last words...
---
Awesome picture.
---
JWR, AWR and FCDWR have never worked properly (they don't stack with the relevant perks afaik.)
---
WWR not working is news to me and makes me want to not log on to my main mule until it's fixed
---
Anyone know how I can get the sentry helmet plans? Why off topic, don't care.
---
Perma-death is an interesting concept for Fallout but it's a little offtopic here as that's not really what this thread is about. Perma-death would need an entirely new rulset righting up because it needs to consider what actual will get saved on your character when dying? Would you have to re-do the entire story again? I could imaging that getting pretty annoying quickly :-)
---
Ammunition? The prices are ridiculus at the vending machines at the train stations.
---
SBQ takes considerably longer (more bullets, more condition) than killing even 50 players.
---
[Me after I unload my 500 lbs of guns to the vendor machine.](https://media.giphy.com/media/GprjkyEo06ewU/giphy.gif)
---
I have got it 3 times on 3 different characters, none of them have done the event more than 2-3 times :)
---
500 lbs is 227.0 kg
---
Thanks for the kind words!
---
Well, you clearly have it all figured out. Be well.
---
and as a bonus you will also get several white fedora's, lol
---
No plan at Harpers ferry for me, lvl 29. 
---
3rd of May.
---
Yes.  Especially once you add powered to the equation
---
Got the game with the power helmet (which is really what I was after) and didn't read any of the negative press before playing,  and have been having fun since launch.  Despite some bugs it's been a blast.
---
Yeah but you still have to walk to every ennemy to loot so what's the difference? I have to find stims you have to find ammo's, same shit.
---
Oh really, that's pretty cool.  I've been playing since B.E.T.A. but have started over a few times, so when I finally discovered Silo Alpha on my current character I thought that was the standard message.
---
Glad you’re coming back around! It’s definitely a fun time despite its problems. Hopefully they continue to update and change things over the next year to make this game great. PS5 is probably releasing next fall and maybe they’ll have a port/remaster/goty edition with all the fixings and dlc.
---
Definitely! This is actually something that I missed off the list actually. In survival mode camps need to be much more durable. Maybe you have to use specific tools or weapons to penetrate walls like C4 or drills or lockpicks. The items would have to be difficult to get hold of so that people couldn't just take out every base they see.   
---
Standard weapons and tools should deal almost minimal damage.  
---
These two combined would cut down on the amount of base griefing for the shits and giggles.
---
We really need an official “known issues” compilation and official Wish List. 
---
It would really help the community if we knew that certain features were on their radar for future development.
---
I tend to avoid the ones that increase DR alone and instead spec for full reduction % like Fireproof, Blocker. 
---
Martial Artist, Incisor, Blocker then 6 in damage. As you level, pick up the weight ones for convenience swaps.
---
Can you use them from pip-boy if they're in your stash? I'm guessing not.
---
Only carry what you need/use a majority of the time. Stash or get rid of everything else. I only carry 2-3 weapons, store all junk, carry 2-0 of each aid, and maybe a couple thousand rounds per gun.
---
Yes definitely in the right direction for survival.
---
Increasing the weapon damage on key areas of the body like head or crippling limbs will create very immersive combat. Some of the bigger monsters could still be a bit tanky and the boss legendaries would of course need to stay tanky.
---
This is the reason I don't plant crops
---
If they make items account bound, im selling my fo76 accounts. 
---
Worst decision in the history of the diablo franchise.
---
Haha I feel you - This is the dream Fallout for me.
---
La...mps...
---
Bruh that's like 5 lbs to carry!
---
5 lbs is 2.27 kg
---
What system do you play on..I have a bunch of the plans kicking around, I'll give you one..I'm on PC.
---
Added. Thank you. I forgot about decon.
---
Definitely! Adventure mode is great where it is at.   
---
The current survival mode doesn't offer much beyond adventure other than a pvp deathmatch experience. I'd like to see survival step up the challenge in both PVP and PVE where veterans of adventure mode or those that just like it nasty can start a new character in and feed on the struggle :-)
---
PS4? Join the raiders community
---
I'm on Xbox unfortunately, really appreciate the offer though.
---
Yeah the game is really pulling me in for hours every day, and i've played  every single day since release.
---
I’d still be logging in everyday player vending/legendary vending regardless, neither make or break the game for me, I’m 200+ levels in with 800+ hours all on one character and I’m not bored yet, quite the opposite tbh, and as for 1* weapons there are plenty out there I’ve had lots of fun with e.g my fully modded bloodied 1* Rolling pin, and with 1* armour it’s still valuable even if it’s not 3* assassins, sentinel, unyielding etc. I still wear the 1* piece of chameleon combat armour I had from a ghoul at whitesprings about 100 levels ago.
---
I'm just surprised it is so low. I expected 25%.
---
Everyone. I kinda stopped using mine.
---
This. I had maybe one or two stragglers since launch, but now every time I log on it's either me or my friends getting attacked by griefers. One of our faction groups who help new players is threatened to break up if it continues.
---
I actually like the white fedora haha, i scrapped my first by accident.
---
Then joined another Encryptid event on a whim as I was in the ash heap, was a nice surprise to get another
---
Yes the current iteration of character builds is almost none existent because we can just swap in and out perk cards as we wish. As an example, there's no reason to seek out a player who role plays as a weapons crafter because you can swap the cards to do it yourself.  
---
Imagine if rerolling was extremely costly and / or time gated so you couldn't swap in and out all the time. Weapons crafting, high quality repairing and ammo crafting could be a real trade that people seek out. The same goes for other utility perks and skills.
---
I'd like to see this too although I'm not entirely sure BGS would go that far. Time will tell I guess! :-)
---
known glitch.   
---
Random quest item "drops" from a player when they fast travel, Server hop.   
---
I do the tech data dump most of the time.
---
Thats great to know thank you.
---
At over 2k caps a go, it'll get expensive quickly
---
&gt; except it doesn't work with FO76, because .... looking at you Bethesda.
---
Playing devils advocate here, but I doubt your mic issues are with the game itself.
---
You find one than scrap it for the plan
---
I’m a scientific from WV trying to find the perfect place to start digging and building a Scientific Institute, a safe place for us to live and work on how to save the surface.
---
I picked it up preowned a couple days ago, intrigued to give it a go, now that things are looking better.
---
Random question; I like handguns, can one make a build around handguns in fo76?
---
I think this is quite contentious.
---
On one hand, you could have a level 2 come fresh out the vault building a lavish camp with fusion generators and metal walls and awesome lighting and furniture and having a top-spec modded to the teeth hunting rifle. That seems kinda op.
---
On the other hand you find yourself traipsing around once more praying to god this workshop capture will give you the plans for that cool stash box which you already unlocked twice before.
---
Asking too much of a multi-billion pound games development studio? :-)  
---
Nothing I've asked for includes new content or huge overhauls really, just a re-balance and a rework of the current systems to create a more challenge PVE and PVP experience. That's all part of what the BETA exists for surely?
---
Most of what I've suggested is borrowed from Fallout 4 survival, modded or other survival games. We aren't talking about something revolutionary or incredibly costly to implement. Mostly just switching off some features in the game and tweaking overs to accommodate the multiplayer experience better.
---
Game has much bigger problems in my opinion. :P
---
😑
---
Ps4 fortnite save the world even has a text chat.
---
Have a good one. Reflect on your personality.
---
That doesn't help console players
---
Other tip: if you find it, hit it. It will make red bright sparks that can help other players
---
I am on PC.  I would love to get my hands on the plans.   Ill trade caps or other things.  I have the herbivore serum too.
---
My personality is just fine...
---
You cannot collect more than 25k from the vending machines in one go. You also don't know in advance when someone is going to make a purchase, so you have to be online with a gap between the caps you have and 25k equal to whatever amount you hope to collect. If you wanted the option to charge a full 25k, you wouldn't even be able to fast travel while you wait to receive it.
---
Besides that, the vending machines will bring a lot of casual sellers onto the market who never bothered with selling through forums etc. The vending machines will be the easy way to buy things, and forums will be the hard way. People like convenience stores. 
---
So, I think the vending machines will put a brake on prices. The legendary vendor, however, is going to do the opposite.
---
That is awesome. I am only at 730 hours, but it just has gone flat. Maybe the rolling pin in the key. Lol.
---
Ive found 2 Assaultron heads on assaultrons i've killed, scrapped them and learnt plans.
---
I believe Mentats increase your chances of learning mods via scrapping
---
The red arrow goes away when you are in stealth. At least it does when you are successfully stealthed.
---
No shit!... Okay cool thanks buddy!!!
---
&gt;as pointless as I think it is in the game because literally all it is is for people who are too scared to talk and I don't understand why you're too scared to talk because it's not like you're even around these people are meeting these people you're in your house by yourself most likely talking to a mic.
---
 It has nothing to do with being scared. I do not want to hear your squeaky voice or anybody else's voice for that matter when I play video games.
---
No Beth Game ever had done this and Beth games so bad they are praised, always stick to their roots.
---
Thanks buddy!!!
---
I regard that measure as a mere fraction of the total "accidental loss" prevention we need. Consider this;
---
Indicators the player wants to keep the item - it is;
---
+ Equipped
---
+ Favourited
---
+ Renamed
---
+ In the n^th top percentile of high value items
---
Ways the player could lose said items;
---
+ Dropping
---
+ Trading to player
---
+ Selling to vendor
---
+ Moving to container
---
+ Scrapping
---
I believe we need confirmations for *any* actions which meet one or more criteria on both of these lists. So far all they have done is prevented scrapping on favourited items.
---

---
I suggest screenshoting the photo in your gallery then deleting it, this saves on space and on xbox you can save the image on your phone too through the Xbox app
---
Yeah pretty much. I started another character and how I've played her is as if she was on her journey. I have done next to no level grinding or excessive scavenging as you would normally. I run a weekly serial on her story with the first post here https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt-XgajD7Hm/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=ek3sbm8d16l7
---
 It has been pretty fun. I play her very differently, my main is my natural play style. With Bernice and that I've ended up in map regions not geared to her level, I'm a much more cautious player and sometimes I have to run rather than fight which is probably more accurate to how people from Vault 76 would perhaps behave when faced with threats they can't handle alone.

But Bernice was in the vault at around 10 years old. Her Dad is off somewhere in California with the army and her Mum is also in that state but with the intelligence branch of the army separated from her husband. Bernice entered the vault with her uncle and aunt, her uncle is a veteran who lost his leg in combat and was discharged as a result. She has left on her own and has a few ideas of what to do.
---
Is that Mk3? I heard Mk3 is bugged.
---
But deep down, you know that is a dude with a female character at the other side...
---
Probably to contribute to the more realistic and hardcore tone of the mode.
---
There is no disrespect, an opinion is an opinion. (Even if I did get slightly triggered by it).  Just for me on console I already have a lot of pictures indent wanna delete, from the few days of exiting the vault during beta and launch, to my first suit of power armor, even a new updated picture of me after going through the dmv... fuck dmvs.
---
And of course with all these pictures and me playing on console I can only have so many.  There will come a time for me where I have to delete some photos from my beautiful collection just so I can do a challenge.
---
You can nerf my tse, you can add more bugs with every update, YOU CAN PUT A 10% ON MY VENDING MACHINES... but dont make delete my memories.
---
I'm talking about the whole thing, not when crouching. When you are standing with the Charmeleon mutation or running using stealthboys. It shouldn't be like that. Stealth means stealth!
---
I listen to audio dramas and my own music often, I've barely used the in-game radio just because it gets too repetitive after a while. I like some of the music on the Classical station, but there's too much of it that makes it sound like you're in a horror movie and that's the last thing I want while I'm sneaking around darkened corridors, hoping to avoid ambush from ghouls.
---
Not hammering people that like this kind of gameplay, definitely not being the no-fun police here.
---
My question is: How is this fun? I mean, if I could One-shot everything that easily the game would get old very quickly IMHO. The same applies to bloodied builds with 2k+ damage.
---
I can One-shot some mobs with my Fatman/Nuka Grenades but it's not efficient cost-wise, and even then they're not 5% as deadly as explosive shotguns and bloodied weapons.
---
Thanks for that gif, it clearly shows there's a problem that needs to be addressed.
---
Say that after you get 10-12 more instead of an actual reward.
---
He's not mad, just disappointed.
---
I completely agree with every single point! Games nowadays are too easy and follow this “participation trophy” philosophy, like no matter how good or bad you are at this game, eventually everyone will become a level 300 powerhouse given enough time. Things never go downwards, death has no real consequences etc. 
---
Everytime you die you loose one level or perk so that next time you encounter a deathclaw your butthole will squeeze instead thinking “oh nice some easy loot and XP”
---
I'm sorry, there's so much i don't understand about the game still. Seeing some of those cards look problematic because missing those shots felt buggy, not intended. I don't know why they don't just make it like 95% damage reduction so at least the player attacking knows that something happened in the first place. I thought my shots were just disappearing or something. I wasn't trying to be accusatory btw, i was really confused .-.
---
&gt; You see, the argument does fall a bit flat because changing the numbers around doesn't bring balance
---
And your argument falls flat because it makes no sense. Yes, balancing a game is a long process that won’t be solved in a day, particularly when it’s as broken as this one. But just because it’s difficult doesn’t mean it’s futile, and it certainly doesn’t mean that a perfectly balanced game would be ideal. That’s nonsense.
---
&gt; So the nerfing game continues until everything is meh.
---
If balanced is “meh” for you, then maybe you just don’t like fair games. That’s fine. But again, this is a game for everyone, not just you.
---
&gt; You may be under the impression that this is the only weapon/build I use...
---
No, I was under the impression that “baby” wasn’t actually a real person, and was meant to represent anyone who likes the fact that the game is imbalanced. I was under the impression that we were talking about game balance, not about how you are personally upset. 
---
&gt; ...irks me to see it meh-d for nothing.
---
It’s not for nothing. I literally just explained why imbalances like that are bad for multiplayer games, even just in terms of co-op. If something is overpowered, it needs to be fixed. It’s not fair for you to put your enjoyment of a weapon above the balance of the game for everyone. I’m sorry that you don’t get to have your fun thing, but it’s not all about you. And it doesn’t matter why you like the overpowered thing... if it’s overpowered, it needs to be fixed, even if it means you personally don’t get to use your fun gun anymore. Look beyond yourself for a second.
---
I’m on Xbox I can make you one if you can provide the mats. I’ll be on around 2 EST
---
I just press triangle square x circle. It's really quick 🤷
---
It counts against anything with armor; which majority of enemies have to some degree or another.
---
You can get 25k caps like it’s nothing now. The vendors have like 2.5k between the factions and cap stash farms make big bank.
---
Jesus dude repair kits arent that big of a deal.
---
I am just glad it didnt get abandoned like Anthem. their 10 years of support turned into 10 weeks
---
No we don't
---
This should have been there since launch!
---
it's pretty rare drop, but i can sell you one plan on pc for only 25000 caps! (bargain acceptable)
---
Not sure on the 105, I just got it before logging off last night. I snapped a few pics of my house and realized one thing I would love is an extreme wide angle, which is fun when in regular photo mode (messing with FOV). I have an 11-16mm extreme wide angle I shoot a lot of urbex with.
---
My every day lens is an 18-135, so I did enjoy the "zoom" from the 105. I wish it was a scrollable zoom and not a set amount, it would make it more realistic.
---
Love doing all the events and they can all bring players together on the server - only problem is I don't know when most are happening until i stumble on them checking the map
---
not as quick as it was
---
They have 1400 caps each day but if you only get caps from that it's gonna take a while to reach 25k
---
Does it even exist? 🤔
---
Enclave has 1400 on its own as well
---
Jesus, yeah. I've been following Anthem. What the fuck happened to Bioware of yore?
---
Mass Effect 2 is still one of, if not my favourite game of all time. How have they been shitting the bed so hard, for so long?!
---
People need to realize the 'stealth' in this game is a make-believe system, the game simply Pretends that the creatures can't see you even when you are 2 feet away from them. Call yourself 'stealth build' all you like, but If in real life something won't happen, don't rely on it, because the glitch in the game will expose you under the right circumstances.
---
Welcome!
---
“Hey...”
---
“You got any sugar?”
---
Enclave also has 1400 on its own so just censoring and nothing else that’s 11 days.
---
It is a great game.
---
Shoutout to "disable/hide" as a common option.
---
They've implemented an anti-scrap protection for favorites! We need anti-sell and anti-drop protection!
---
I’ve tried to avoid buying any so I have no idea how they work, my build doesn’t use power armor so I don’t waste my resources on the SBQ because of server crashes and all around bad experiences fighting her in the past. Ugh. I don’t care if they add pay to win shit if it means they can stabilize their game tbh.
---
What armor skin is that?
---
👍🏻
---
Isn't that the stealth rifle/shotgun? I found that in the trunk of the car at the top of the penthouses tower while doing the quest
---
At least I could swear I did
---
👌🏻 Marie Kondo that shit away!
---
Too early to discuss actual implementation, but I'm keeping my hopes high my quad bashing damage harpoon gun looses the insulting bashing damage.
---
Haha Couldn't agree more! I'm yearning for a good butt hole squeeze.
---
You know ,  along with the drill,  you could put on the Mad Scientist outfit,  Mad Scientist goggles, the Medical Smile mask and you could role play as a Mad Dentist.
---
To me, it looks like NukaShine
---
to be fair, you do find the gun in an irradiated pool of water in a rusted safe. so it could have been damaged, and as a vault dweller you might not be able to repair it to do better damage and only just to clean it up. then again you are also able to craft nukes, mini guns, and fusion generators just from steel, screws, glue, and wood
---
You mention abandoning workshops. Is this actually a feature or do you mean by leaving the world?
---
Which is why the next patch will nerf them
---
&gt; EXPLOSIVE SHOTGUN BUG FIXES
---
&gt; We’re also implementing fixes for a pair of bugs affecting shotguns that have the explosive legendary effect. The first was causing them to deal double damage, rather than the 20% increase the explosive effect is intended to provide. The second issue was causing the Pip-Boy to display lower damage numbers than explosive shotguns were actually dealing to your targets. While these aren’t true balance changes, it’s important that we address these issues to bring more consistency to both the displayed and actual damage output of explosive shotguns. 
---
Hear hear. I second this. Plug in. Set to area. Jibber jabber at wastelanders...
---
EA
---
I think it's literally every item has this potential
---
I do like where you are going with the concept of weapon durability becoming poorer over time. Each time you repair the max durability could shrink a bit more.
---
The only problem is that would need a bit of work put into it because with how weak durability is in the game this would be more of an annoyance.
---
Go over to M76 and trade for what you want.  Or just hit up the key vendors and buy what others sold.  I bought lvl 50 Unyielding/Sentinel combat armor at a vendor just last week.
---
They have already chipped away at my reason for playing. It all started after the tse nerf. I enjoy one shoring everything and playing the game with little challenge. The grind in the game is boring as hell to me, and legendary hunting is crap now that I can’t complete mayor for a day and go around killing Watoga robots without any challenge for legendaries
---
Yes. I did an event with a guy and after he wanted to pvp. Normally I survive TSE damage but that gun was wicked. I think it has an AA effect.
---
😒 Yeah, still, not all of the fault goes to them. After the big Jason Schreier piece, it's become pretty apparent Biowares management is totally inept. 5+ years to get out of pre-production? Wtf?! Haha
---
Are you new to gaming? Pvp dictates for balance
---
BOOO!  
---
Looks at Scout Armor, cries.
---
Gladiator benefits 2H weapons. Marital Arts benefits 1H weapons.  
---
Blocker (take less damage) and Incisor (armor penetration) benefit both.
---
Glowsight3 for increased damage against glowing ones.
---
Batteries included for lower Fusion core weight.
---
fix it good for repairing
---
 2H weapons may do more damage, but have a slower swing speed (even with swing speed perks), than 1H weapons.  As a result, 1H weapons may do more damage faster.  (A Fast 1H weapon may make 3-4 hits in the same time it takes a slow 2H weapon to make 1 hit)  
---
This becomes evident when meleeing a mob.
---
IIRC, as I progressed through levels, my main weapon were :
---
1-20: Fire axe, 10mm pistol/38 auto pipe rifle
---
20-30: vampire machete/38 auto
---
30-40: vampire machete/Death tambo/hardened sniper
---
40-50: vampire machete/death tambo/deathclaw gauntlet/hardened sniper
---
50-75: cultist blade/vampire switchblade/executioner combat
---
Scenario based, I use either a sniper and an executioners rifle as secondaries.  
---
The executioners rifle is my primary when a SB is flapping around.
---
I've used several other very effective 1H.  Blade of Bastet, Assaultron blade, vampire hatchet, some instigating weapons...but I keep going back to the cultist blade/executioners.
---
 
---
Be aware some 1H weapons do not work in PA. (e.g. deathclaw gauntlet, death tambo)  I used those until I stated farming legendaries. Now I'm too over-encumbered to not use PA.  Hope to fix that once the legendary vendor and player vending are active.
---
I tried shotguns - don't work well with my build - but I don't have shotgun perks
---
That sounds like fun.
---
Warframe has been in development for the same time and it is if not one of the best/complete F2P game right now and they are still adding so much content.
---
Here is an idea i'd like your opinion on.
---
Level cap 50.  No more levels past that, no point or perk choice. Maybe put in a quest to get perk card packs or turn them into very high level loot.  Maybe put in a respec option that is hard to find.  (Format wise I keep thinking of a "What Makes You SPECIAL" book you have to quest for.) 
---
Balance wise there shouldn't be any issues since 50 is already a soft cap in regards to health, damage, etc.  What this forces in survival mode, however, is hard choices with perk cards, and it forces you to make some choices between crafting, weight, or damage related perks.
---
Of course this assumes forcing new characters.
---
You sound like a window licker.
---
That's not true, I can make all the ultricite ammo, but not all the receivers. I'm pretty sure the SBQ, dropped all the ammo plans once for me, but only got the gauss rifle prime plane. I still don't have the handmade prime receiver, but just made 5.56 ultricite ammo yesterday for someone.
---
You were expecting a nuke but it was me, mothman!
---
You lose the caps.  Just like when you sell stuff to a vendor and you're at max caps.
---
Bless DE. I don't know how the fuck they have been able to do what they have. I'm glad their parent company is happy for them to keep doing their thing, hands off.
---
The fact that in Warframe I can trade on the market for a few hours and make £15 worth of plat and go get my self a swanky bundle is amazing.
---
After Fortuna, I was more than happy to throw some money at them.. They gave me fucking hoverboards.
---
It was, whitespring ghouls respawn every time a person comes into the area. Legendaries everywhere and basically nonstop xp. But they had to nerf it.
---
Nope, but I have not engaged in PvP since I quit Ultima Online.
---
Hmm, I've been wanting a spiral staircase for awhile. I might have to try this.
---
Where did you get that stealth blade mod?
---
Good point, but they would already be violating it. Eg you can communicate now via voice... unless you have some kind of speech disorder, or are mute. The way to help those people communicate is by adding text chat.
---
They are nice, but close range only. My combat rifle can do pretty much this same trick, but it reloads every 25 mutants. Shotguns are cool, but not OP, even with how their current damage is bugged (displayed as lower than it is, deals more than intended).
---
Thank you! Huge help. Weird question if I’m even asking it clearly. So I’m copying this build.... https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/dangerous-solo-full-damage-two-handed-melee-build-one-shot-everything/    Does it matter when/how I level up a secondary weapon? Like rifle for instance
---
works on console too
---
I'm doing a bloodied stealth commando at the moment (with bloodied handmade rifle) but after finding a level 50 bloodied pipe bolt action rifle on a vendor, I realized this gun would be great for taking out trash mobs like super mutants. After some calculations, I realized that with the all rifle man perks at rank 3, bloody mess rank 3, covert operative rank 3 (2.5x sneak attack criticals),the adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage perk at rank 3 this weapon hits for 1250 damage per shot with stealth (500 base damage).makes a lot of sense because .308 rounds are quite large. I just switch up my perks from commando to rifle man and can out super mutants in one shot no matter what level they are. It is so OP
---
with in 1 year, I had put about 1000 hours into the game. and thrown more money at it than any other game i have played, and every dollar was worth it. Now I am just waiting for Inaros prime and new war to come out. 
---
BTW Oberon Main 4 days
---
Welcome, Vault dweller. Happy reclamation day! If you need any assistance or any starter gear I will be online in 4 to 5 hours. However I would suggest to explore and enjoy the game on your own pacing and try to get some teammates to explore together. If you decide that you need help, please dm me.
---
Happy hunting!
---
The display cases, can we have more details on what can be displayed, I don't really into those bubbleheads and the magazine things, junks are more like my things though
---
Welcome to the fallout out world. I love seeing new players cuz it shows the community is growing even among the blind hate the game gets. I've enjoyed the game alot since its release and have yet to get bored with it. Anytime u get stuck on something most people on this reddit r pretty helpful so dont be afraid to ask. Have fun
---
Yes some are effective for a stealth build, but if you wanna be all gun-ho with them save up on caps cause the really good legendaries can be expensive
---
Have reactive plates on your PA? That’ll but you into combat
---
No matter how many times I read this I’m not understanding your point. 
---
It’s stealth build as the perk cards refer to “stealth” and add damage modifications if in “stealth/hidden” mode.
---
Of course if something in real life doesn’t work then you can’t rely on it but somehow I’m missing perk cards in real life that render me invisible, so I’m unsure to your “real life reference”. 
---
Having played way to many hours on fo4 and having certain aspects of perks work one day and not the next without changing any parameters, or by relogging to fix. I can say this build is broken in many ways and is a common complaint within the community. I was merely giving my two cents to the OP about a viable way I have found to play ranged “stealth”
---
Nova Prime main. My Nova, Ferrox, Aklex Prime and Orthos prime set up probably have 20 forma spread across that load out. I've invested so much time into that set up I'm hesitant to use anything else haha.
---
🤣
---
It's the nukashine skin on T-51b armour.
---
u/Valseek Will display cases allow us to display our power armor?...Still holding about 60 lbs of Power Armor in my stash to display.
---
60 lbs is 27.24 kg
---
Same for the bathroom on the 4th floor of fort defiance. I found antibiotics and disease cure recipe right next to each other last night in there. Never seen a recipe in a bathroom mirror before.
---
Switch to weapons tab and scrap your guns on that list
---
Yup thats what i did. I was in weapons and it scrapped my armor
---
Well, the game has been completely unplayable since they introduced the kits, haven’t you heard?
---
&gt;  I haven’t tried it out in Survival mode or against other players
---
You would look a right tit using an explosive shotgun on someone in survival mode only to find out they had a dense armor mod and level 3 fireproof.  They don't even need a legendary effect to make it useless.
---
I think my opticor has about 400 hours of usage. even if puncture is not as good as slash, but when you do 20k puncture, it does not even matter
---
Try accessing and using it through the full menu, not the quick menu.  I experience the same bug and it prevents me from using stealthboys via the quick menu.  I hope Bethesda fixes this soon.
---
The horror!
---
Mothman doesn't like that
---
That's beautiful, I love it. Keep up that writing, it's very nice to read
---
For sure. Kind of similar to Nova and anti-matter drop. When you're doing nuclear warhead levels of damage, the damage type doesn't really matter. Everything is already dead.
---
First, you need to understand that the studio in Austin is certainly not what made Bethesda worth "multiple billion".
---
The UI changes are "pretty easy" normally to remove indeed. No biggie. 
---
But the recoil, damage and accuracy of weapons are much more complicated to balance, not to mention if you want to make a difference between PVP and PVE. 
---
Making visual differences for a leg injury is VERY costly. You need to pay a designer for the new model showing the injury, a new animation, test that the new buffs/debuffs are correctly applied/cleansed, and if you do this correctly you have to do it for EACH monster actually alive in the game, plus combination of the models (leg/arm injury, both legs, etc).
---
"Revisiting the loot economy" means re-thinking the whole way items are spawned in the map/generated by ennemies. You have apparently no idea how many tweaks that would take. Same with "remove or redesign mutations". That would need weeks of balance and testing, to achieve a situation that would please YOU more but would irrate many other players.
---
I won't even start on the "negate server hopping" stuff. I'm pretty sure if they were able to ensure player will stay on the same server all along, they would have gone with it since it would have prevented a lot of issues, so my take is that this is a design choice in their architecture that can't change. 
---
Btw, in PVP, if I can log off/log on and be sure to log again on the same server, you won't be able to kill me because I will Alt-F4 the game. (I say "I will" but I don't play PVP, this is rethorical)
---
You have good ideas and I agree with some of them, but yes, for a studio, it's a lot of work to suit YOUR vision of the game.
---
This
---
What paint job is that? - cool about Mothman too!
---
That's too bad
---
It's the nukashine paint.
---
True. But have you played eso?  With conjugation a lot of characters run around with 2 companions behind you.
---
What!? You were in weapons!? You sure you weren’t rushing and where maybe just in the inventory tab? Either way that sucks!!!
---
Welcome :)
---
So where do you think the problem is? Is the autosave broken and not reading inventories correctly, maybe? Is the anti-duper scans malfunctioning?
---
People are claiming to loose stuff from their person, stash, mules. Armor, power armor, weapons. 
---
What mechanics would have to malfunction to do this? What systems have access to inventory and stash that could explain this?
---
Glad that you enjoyed the game ! See you in the wasteland :)
---
100% sure. I only made that mistake once early on ib the game.  What was worse when it scrapped my frame..i was 520 lbs inside westek. That was a loooooong sketchy walk back home lol
---
Like in F3 when your guns would jam up when they got low condition! They need to bring this back.
---
Me too, fellow member.
---
You speak as if there is a grand plan of balancing in place, of which there is zero evidence.
---
What there is evidence of is knee-jerk reactions to very specific instances where a sector of the playerbase has gone 'dis OP plz nerf' while most of the drive is applied to pressing on with whichever timetable the devs have and are lagging behind, whatever is left in its wake unacknowledged and unfixed be damned.
---
Either way my selfishness or lack thereof is rendered mot at this point, the change is coming and that is that.
---
I will have to adapt again until my current "selfish OP weapon" of choice becomes a target and so on and so forth.
---
Rerolling items was merely speculation.  It does not appear that there will be any reroll mechanic.
---
&gt;In the lore and according to the myth Mothman is either meant to appear just before a catastrophe is about to occur or warn others of danger
---
That's weird because he always sneaks up on me in the woods and the only catastrophe is his.
---
I also use others as portable lightning rods.
---
Richard Gere approves this message
---
I kinda wish 76's end game was more like WF's. with the atom shop it is kinda turning into that. instead of Fashion Frame, it turns into Fashion Power Armor. if only we could do our own custom colors and paints with preset patterns like Warframe.
---
I love the game. I bought it on release (have never played a FO game) and have been obsessed with it. I play everyday, even if it’s just an hour or so. I always find things to do, and then there are the daily challenges. I’m definitely never bored! I have completed the main quest line and most of the side ones.
---
Can you please post a link to your build? Very interested to try this out!
---
Welcome to Appalachia!
---
Don't forget that mutants will also return fire to the sound of gunfire.  Reconnaissance by fire was the military term.
---
You are invincible to other players while in pacifist mode. You had a workshop. Or were on a team with someone who did. Or you were on a team engaged in PVP. Or you were wanted.
---
Or you were in survival.
---
How did that meet up with the overseer go? Was she chatty? :P Seriously tho, good choice. And remember that people meet there (overseers camp) ALOT so if you can stop by periodically to check the box, do it. I personally stop by and drop food and aid and more importantly, plans!!! Just a suggestion if your on the area. Plus there is a random spawn for a serious of loot right next to it across the street, always something to pick up.  Except for maybe this “sheepsquatch” thing everyone is talking about. But that’s probably BS, West Virginia hooey ;)
---
"Mothman will remember that"
---
Thank you, I see now how I could have been far more specific. I was indeed at a workshop and built a structure there, as well as structures and defences around resource harvesting equipment (fences around and turrets on an oil extractor for example). At one point I ran out of steel and was merrily running around to find some more to scrap when it crashed. When I hit "Play" again it took me back to the same site (normal) but someone else had claimed the site so clearly a different world. I guess the obvious question "Would it be possible to quit and re-start to find the one i left? Or are there too many worlds?"
---
Did you cheese the queen and lure her out of the rad zone? She doesn't like that.
---
Mine is now down by Twin Lakes. I was also wanting a cliff side but also wanted water access. I'm so picky!
---
Cant get to that site from where I am right now.
---
Recall I didn't plan a build in advance, I selected the perks that benefited me at the time.  And that's how I ended up melee.  
---
I started with thinkgs I know from previous versions - weight reduction, chem duration, reduced spoilage, then started on weapon perks.  
---
Had I preplanned, I might have gone rifle, because that's what I've always done in FO  (3, 4, NV).  
---
But I've come to really like the melee, even though it is a departure from norm for me.
---
I have +10% accuracy and 2x armor penetration perks for automatic rifles. (Don't remember what they are named.)  I didn't select them until after I had found/looted the appropriate weapon.  You should find a 38 auto pipe rifle really early, and a sniper not long after that.
---
Thank you
---
Upgrade your Luck Perk irl.
---
Well I’ve  has some weird shit happen to me but I can’t say I’ve scrapped apparel through the weapons menu. But regardless, if I’m using my PA it’s excavator, and if it’s excavator it’s got calibrated shocks on for sure! So I feel your pain but good luck replacing them! There are some PA services on the “market” that can help out for pretty cheap unless you know the plans already.
---
It's a glitch here's a link to my post with a vid
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjazzq/bug_and_proof_of_disappearing_power_armor_pieces/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Best bet for now is do not fast scrap as OP has suggested.
---
Going Melee is so foreign/bizarre to me but it feels so right for this time around for me. Especially with how different the game is in general. Really appreciate your help/thoughts
---
I was saying in this game they make the enemies completely blind to your presence if you're 'sneaking', you can of course enhance the effect with perks and legendary effects to make them even blinder and maximize your damage. However when any component in this make believe system is broken, player gets exposed and get frustrated. But if you use terrain and architecture as your cover and maintain a safe distance as you would do in real life, you're more likely to be safe. The game is less glitchy if you use common sense, but if you push the make believe system too hard it will break.
---
I thought I'd be incredibly clever once and put almost everything I had in a bag hidden at my CAMP so I could fast travel (Yes, I am a pack rat, don't judge me) LOL... anyway, the server crashed and a lost it all ... a sad day
---
lmao
---
This post reminds me of a book “flowers for Algernon”
---
Thank you! Looks very spiffy :)
---
Nah I was just letting you know.
---
That place is a brewing gold mine.
---
Yea i know almost all the exc plans..ir was just a pain..i hopped servers at blackwater for like 2 hrs to get a new frame. Idk what was goibg on there..guess the bew skins cane out and everyone abd their mom is makinf new sets lol
---
That’s what happens when you let others decide for you.
---
Welcome back!
---
That would be terrible.  Like subsisting on dog food in some post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland.
---
And cores seem to be draining much faster after patch 8.5
---
OP isn't crazy please see the link I posted in the parent comments for a vid. I have also submitted said video to Bethesda for review.
---
It isn’t poor at all. Elder Scrolls and Fallout, Fallout especially, have always been about hoarding. There were never real limits, except when you had so much that the game couldn’t load.
---
My point is your style of play isn’t important. No one gives a shit and it doesn’t help anyone for you to brag about having less things than everyone else.
---
Tonight.. you.
---
If there was a place I could pay 75 - 100 caps for a primed fusion core... I'd visit it.
---
The RNG Gods require a sacrifice. 
---
Kidding aside, I’m level 175 and didn’t start to see better loot until I started grinding more kills, and focusing on higher level opponents.
---
I’ve gotten most of my best drops from some obvious places like West-Tek, White Springs and Blackwater mine because my base is near there, but if you want better opponents do Nuke Zones and things like the Missile Batteries North and South of Watoga. 
---
The SAM sites are  not easy to solo unless you have good gear, because you can be confronted by multiple scorched beasts sometimes, but with a buddy or two you should get a ton of opportunities for good drops.
---
Well the game must have been working at its finest because the last time it got completely destroyed all the people doing it only had 5 cap bounties and I lost 140 caps as soon as I got their from them killing me before the game even finished loading. It wass great that I loose more caps then them, then have to spend thousands to rebuild when all they got was a 5 cap bounty. Thanks bethesda...

Farm white springs golf course. I got a quad explosive combat shotgun from there max level
---
I believe they use a shot spotter system.
---
Thanks
---
I'll give you a 3* for it... not gonna be a God roll... but ya know...
---
Me too! Semi retired, level 123 gt profshade2
---
Oh my. Nice drop. Thanks
---
The way I see it, unless you can trade the legendary for another one that you want, I don't see many selling them. There's no point in having caps, other than buying mats or ammo from other players.
---
NP, by far the best place to farm for your time
---
That’s very generous, but I am on PS4. Thank you, though.
---
I've had attack dogs spawn in during a SBQ fight, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was a lazy import from FO4.
---
Well I never really decided I wasn't going to play it. I just kept not choosing to play it.
---
Yes it’ll give you access to more advanced weapons to help you
---
Check this [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5yzrl/lvl_40_legendary_farming_locations_and_events/) for legendary mob locations and events.
---
And you'll be grinding a lot for good ones.   The RND god is fickle at worst and a cunt at best.
---
Pretty sure thats the way they want it. Claiming a workshop means you are down for PVP anywhere on the map.
---
That's a cloaking blade
---
L74.   Not in your boat.  Might not even be in your part of the ocean.
---
Not sure how you are defining "success" of the vending system.
---
  Right now, I'm holding legendaries for either the legendary vendor or player vending, and living with being over-encumbered"
---
If player vending does't remove weight from stash, then the legendary vendor will get them, and I'll keep right on playing.  
---
  Still have multiple quests to complete, explore the rest of the more and bog, launch a nuke...Experienced a sheepsquatch a couple nights ago, but I have yet to face the SBQ....
---
PC
---
Thanks for all the help guys thanks.
---
For what it’s worth I am a level 218 and am only now making my way through the BOS quest line. I’ve launched many a nuke and killed many queens. I don’t think there’s a wrong way to play honestly just do what you feel like doing!
---
You either gotta join em or avoid em. Not really another option.
---
Use the in game photo mode
---
At any point during that hypothetical “slippery slope” you talk about the game will be worth playing or not, and people will make their own decisions as to where they draw the line. The point I’m clear on is that I’m not going to lose my shit over a hypothetical.
---
Ok, thanks for help :)
---
I’m just wondering if the powers that be will notice any drop off in player numbers logging on when the vendor arrives?? Eg, all those alt accounts being emptied and potentially not being used for a time?
---
Yes it does.
---
Players still pick locks? I bet your going to tell me you still hack terminals also.
---
Is it still available? If so, how in the world can I get this?
---
Whos hat is taller abraham Abraham Lincoln or doug digadome owner of dougs dale digadome
---
No way. Maybe a 1 for 1 trade.
---
So good guy please tell me which time zone you are and when you are online and maybe I can come over :)
---
SBQ? Is that the scorchbeast queen? If so, I just completed it.
---
Just accepted the friend requests
---
This is what highschool felt like..
---
Enclave bunker has so much to offer and has X-01 plans
---
I did Enclave first. Wouldn't worry about it. It's not like other Fallout games where allegiance means something.
---
It got released 2 days ago iirc and it's still up on the featured section of the store for 1400 points.
---
I dunno, my friend one shots everything using melee, it’s kinda lame tbh.
---
But to each his own I guess.
---
Waiting for the biggest Lämp
---
Thanks for the clarification, yes I would agree for real life applications of stealth of course you would utilise terrain and choose camouflage to suit the area etc. but unfortunately doesn’t use or require those mechanisms in game to help with he build. I refer to it being broken, when I’m 100+ yards away, keeping still and merely training my sights on the enemy, they without being shot at will somehow aggro to my position. Bushes, darkness or not. Gear is modded for stealth too. Other examples would be bottom floor of a building (no enemies) and still somehow pulling aggro from mob that2-3 building levels higher then yourself. But slap on unyielding and have less then 20% hp and you could tap dance on their chest and not be sighted.
---
Random. I've gotten it 3x though. So it's definitely not impossible.

I'm guessing your friend didn't have pacifist on.

I just meant the spelling bro, that’s all
---
The deep pocketed and polymer mods attach.  The only problem is that you can't tell the difference between the torso and limb mods, so you *will* end up buying a torso mod when you've already got it.
---
Some mods (used?) to be specialised for legs or arms, but the armor slots aren't so it (used?) to be impossible to add a brawling (for example) mod.
---
OP, are you having a stroke? Do we need to call an ambulance?
---
&gt; there are no legendary scout pieces
---
I was sooo hoping that the legendary vendor would allow us to fix that, but apparently not.  Bummer.
---
There was some mods for f04 i used..im in ohio...so i had 11 suits of power armor painted like the cleveland browns uniforms..with jetpacks lol..It was extra dope. Id love to have that in this game
---
There's a new one from a different author called Save Everything.
---
He did he doesnt like pvp so he leaves it on
---
Gotcha... still don't like the grammer police especially on a platform like reddit where there are a lot of non-english speakers. 
---
Though in your defense it was a tough read
---
Just replace barrels with d@cks sorry it was just low hanging fruit.
---
I don't think they'll be available to purchase in the atom shop.
---
Is it good looking? Worth the buy?
---
Lol, last two guys who tried to PvP me with a TSE got handled. 5-2. . .
---
Anthem hasn't been abandoned. People said the same shit about this game when it came out. Give it a few months, like other games have gotten. Anthem has had a ton of problems, but it's hard to avoid when they had 1.5y of crunch time, and during that window managemet was still figuring things out.  Not defending the game, just think the toxic fanbase is ridiculous
---
Lol ..thumb is wiggin out from mass scrapping all night. 
---
...that was fd bud.
---
This is quite sad actually. 😂 I've been playing 76 since beta.... Never get a single 3 star legendary weapon nor armor.
---
That’s awesome.  I only get disconnected from the server after I launch a nuke.
---
Wow......damn lockpicking critters
---
I know it's a long shot but now I'm really hoping that the legendary vendor will sell plans for legendary effects that you can craft for weapons/armor, similar to the serum recipes in the Enclave bunker. Obviously highly priced (250 legendary scrip, 500, etc..)  but then you could buy the plan to craft explosive or anti-armor or whatever other effect as a mod for your items.
---
I certainly agree the bounty system is weird
---
I beg to differ on that
---

In my opinion (and from the opinions I've seen online so far) it's a really good looking skin. It's mainly black and gold with some details being coloured in a nice quantum blue colour like the visors of the helmets or the eyes of the X-01 armour. There is another skin up that is currently on the store for 1400 points which is the 2nd one from on this album: https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy I got both because both of them look really good but if you want more value for your points I'd go with nukashine cause it goes on all power armours apart from ultracite (though I haven't tried painting it yet) whilst the horseman skin can be applied on all power armours but it changes the model of the armour.
---
Duh!
---
I wish they would take that, but also rework bobbleheads.
---
Let the stand have 7 "Active slots" where bobbleheads are displayed, otherwise it acts as storage for bobbleheads.
---
Change the perks though so that have bobbleheads give a buff for a time, then cooldown, or something like "+10 carryweight" so long as its active
---
Are you on today?
---
The game is easy enough that you can make anything work, but handguns have a couple issues that hold them back. No armor piercing perks, the heavy hitting revolvers don’t have AP magazines, the fast firing 10mm have smaller mags than rifles, and one of the big ones is that Agility tree has a lot of very nice combat perks in it, which means your pistol damage perks are now competing for SPECIAL slots with other high-value perks, which isn’t something you really have to deal with with the other weapon specialties.
---
So War Rider is up right now? Is it for all the armors?
---
Report it. Send in a ticket. Be thorough, include everything you can remember about the situation. 
---
If this is an actual bug/glitch they need all of the info they can get from every instance so they can recreate it and establish the cause.
---
That would be really a great addition to the game, I remade my base yesterday and I spent over 30m trying to plant all my crops due to terrain issues, it either said "you can't plant in the water" (because my camp is near a rive and it bugs out to the terrain borders) or "it needs support", or just plain red marks... It would make things easier for everyone and aesthetically better too. Crops flying look just wrong to be honest!
---
But it’s not trash, that’s the thing, it never was.
---
The internet hate train was the trash, they greatly exaggerated what was bad and downplayed what was good.
---
Glad you’re having fun now friend!
---
They want a bar that’s shows the entire condition of the weapon as it goes down. Not just when it gets down to 10%
---
You can use them to stack the floored stairs, as well as making then look like supports for floating floors. Like struts to support a balcony or such. It's all about aesthetic, or you could just leave them floating. That's about it.
---
...and then you came on voicechat and i heard your voice of a 42 year old man...
---
Is this really the case? Stealth build here that hasn’t had the pleasure of owning an explosive weapon yet on 76.
---
Yeah it's up and you can apply it to all armours but it won't add the red bits onto each individual armour and instead it will change the whole model e.g. if I apply it onto an X-01 suit it will change the whole model so it looks like the one on the picture i.e. T-45 with the red bits of metal welded onto it.
---
 I have a legendary shotgun I'm not using much. (Drop from WS)
---
I think its a 2 shot with some other perk.  I do not think its explosive. 
---
If you are PS4, I'm sure we an work something out.
---
and  everyone is happy and the world keeps spinning.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Can you tell me the level? When you can of course.
---
Not a dev room item. Although it would be in there... 
---
Some lucky people figured out how to get it from the monster mash event. Not sure if they ever fixed the glitch that let them.
---
It was originally supposed to support multiple layers of foundations so you don’t get that needs support error but then people started using those and camp fires to bug and make a house of nothing but foundations.
---
I think it was also to add support for a second floor so you could put stuff like pressure plates on the second floor. But it never actually worked. You can do it now without support beams I believe.
---
So it changes all armors to a modified version of the power armor? e.g. T-51b Regular —&gt; T-51b War Rider
---
Compared to my sneak bloody unyielding that's really fast -- also if my stealth goes foobar I'm dead
---
It's not like it'd be full of r/creepyasterisks material... * pouts *
---
Thanks! :)
---
Its more that i have a level 110 with a great camp i dont want to move and most of the plans and i decided to make a alt for a different build but cant make any weapons or even crafting stations.
---
Secondly sometimes i wanna just build camps
---
Bloody need you to run with low hp all the time, it's a (quite big) tradeoff. And maintaining the low hp for sustainable damage requires some management.
---
TSE doesnt have tradeoff at all
---
Could have been on fire sitting in front of the door :D
---
I used to drop my stuff in a suitcase..log out..log in with a mule and pray to atom i got back in..only failed me twice..but..recently..my son got an xbox for his birthday...and now..when he sleeps..i have two xboxs..one for my main and my collection...and on his..i have 3 characters maxed with junk. I am now free to farm. I empty my main down to a couple weapons and excavator..a few ionized abd inerts..with healing factor i only keep about 5 stims just in case...but other than that..i pick up all legendaries steel and lead. It takes about a day to max out again. It literally changed the game. My 50 cal is never hungry anymore.
---
Shhh, don't spoil it!
---
I wouldn’t even mind them each giving a small buff such as +1% damage or +1% health which would stack to 7% when you collect them all, but you can only have one buff active at any time and have to go back to your stand to change it.
---
...which is exactly why I always mute my mic when I play Fallout 76.
---
No if I apply it to an X-01 suit it will change from a X-01 model to a T-45 war rider model i.e. the one that is on the picture. It won't change the damage resistances or anything but it will change visually.
---
Not useless, you could always donate duplicate plans to other noobs , and or just trash the plans because they arent rare anyway, everyone has them from the main quest.
---
I never thought it was trash. I just wasn't super compelled to play it because all the hype around the game absolutely tanked on release I guess.
---
You're pissed that a level 30 can't beat someone 180 levels above you? Seems pretty entitled. Level up and try again
---
I think they should implement a non-traditional way of doing this.
---
At the moment, we buy plans from vendors or quests and they are learned for that character, and that works (it's how it works in games with other crafting systems).
---
What I wish Bethesda would do is put plans in the ATOM store as well, BUT hear me out before you downvote. Several crafting systems are based on RNG...so unlocking a plan on one character for your whole account gets rid of play time, and some players would skip quests or become OP early on. If plans were put into the ATOM shop, and priced fairly as well as not change prices of items in game, I think it would do well. 
---
Want a fusion generator? 250 atoms. Don't wanna spend 250 atoms? Spend 230 caps in game. Handmade rifle? 500 atoms. Don't wanna spend 500 atoms? Spend 1500 caps in game (I don't remember the cost for these plans in game). Oh, you just want a fancy light set? 100 atoms.
---
I feel like if Bethtesda could categorize these plans and price appropriately, it would be a good system. Weapons could scale from 250 to 1000 caps depending on the weapon and how you normally unlock it. CAMP decorations and plans could be 50 to 500 atoms. Recipes could be 50 atoms, etc.
---
I would love this it’s not like they couldn’t pull the info off the menu and put it on the hud.
---
I always thought lowly of the Quad explosive double barrels. never thought they would even get close to being as strong as a Bloodied Combat shotgun with the 9/9 Shotgun perks, 3/3 Bloody Mess, and full unyielding, and a guy with low HP. I never doubted they could kill, just never thought they could do it as efficiently. You certainly changed my mind. And I'm gonna try that trick with Four Leaf Clover, never knew that. Thanks!
---
I buy mine online but I get some decent ones from farming.
---
Never had a god roll or bought one though
---
Yea if you slow it down its no problem.  But man ehat a pia. Could not find a new frame for hours
---
It's the same game you played before, on slightly better servers.
---
Couple new quests and a drunk robot.
---
I would love a wider lens as well. Like a "0.5x" might be perfect, considering the current "105mm" lens's widest is "1x".
---
I just wish the model for the lens was actually a zoom lens. I know, the camera model is a rangefinder, but still.
---
Also yes, a scroll, even D-pad to zoom would be dope. For PS4 its L1... considering you "aim" the camera with L2, its kinda tricky as-is.
---
How do you like your 11-16?
---
Uh? A bloodied heavy weapon build can. I clear west-tek without even reloading my gatling gun, its a 1star bloodied version, if I had a BE version I’d be 1tapping everything at up to 200 range, no VATS, with sniper-like accuracy. As it is its 1-3 shots depending on my aim and Adrenaline levels. Hell the Burrows is a slaughterhouse. I WANT to get everything’s attention ‘cause I can just start hosing down a hallway and grin as they all try and run through the hail of lead.
---
Oh ok sweet I gotcha, thanks for the help man!
---
I think it would provoke more pvp. I’d destroy houses just to get to that jukebox if they played country and had a player vending spot lol.
---
Oh. I haven't played it on PS4 since beta. I guess you have to do item transfers the hard way.
---
I have my camp right next to the missile tube and I've had several cryptid visits. Mothman a couple times and Flatwoods Monster a couple days ago. There's a random spawn somewhere around there but I haven't figure out the exact location yet.
---
No problem :)
---
'I can't access my game right now...'
---
They never confirmed stash weight had anything to do with crashing servers. It was the dupers.
---
"Bloody Humans, always with the light shows! Not bad, I've seen better though"
---
It’s random... I haven’t seen it drop in the ~15 times I’ve run the event, I just bought it off someone for 1.5k.
---
A day’s worth of vendor farming is worth it imp.
---
I think you’re going to be disappointed with the next patch.
---
Anyway, I support separate modes, I just want to enjoy good coop PVE but I sure respect people that love hardcore PVP.
---
Welcome to the wastelands!! I know someone else already touched base on periodically checking the Overseers cache for stuff that higher levels will leave there. But also check all containers at the stations as people leave things in there for lower levels as well...stims, weapons, chems, armor, ammo, etc.  I make treated marine wet suits as it adds a little resistance...every little bit helps 😁
---
Balls of cotton
---
You didn't say that you weren't in a team with someone. So I'm guessing you were and they probably engaged whoever it was in pvp.
---
I appreciate the offer but I feel like that’d mean a lot less than getting there myself
---
On platform just have 1 friend on a server. Drop the stuff in a random bin and log out and log in on alt there and grab it.
---
I don't know how to send you a photo from Mobile Reddit, or I'd assist you. :( I tried. &lt;/3
---
I do.
---
Not a respec.
---
It took me way too long to realize that the beeping scorched officers make wasn’t some weird mutated frog ambient noise.
---
Great feedback!
---
My one bit of advice for Bethesda is do balance PVP and PVE totally separate, if one change is made to guns in PVP, then DONT change them automatically the same way for PvE- keep them separate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Na if you got the right Perks and armor you can play with 20% hp without getting any or really dmg. TSE Weapons got really worse accuracy
---
Cool, ppl actually still play Fo76? 😱
---
Yeah I had one in the savage divide once I killed it I stepped on multiple pulse mines and died
---
I use them for exactly this, they look brilliant as support posts for sections of camp with overhangs. Serves no practical purpose but aesthetically it’s brilliant, especially with strings of lights between them.
---
You can send it to my email: noah.morano@gmail.com
---
OK.  I probably wont be on until after midnight EST tonight.
---
My bad on probably not been too clear regarding health visual indicators. I wasn't necessarily referring to third or first person animations. I appreciate that mocap and implementing them isn't cheap and is time consuming. I was really referring to the fact that currently in game if you break a leg it is inconsequential and within 30 seconds you heal without any form of aid. As an example, simply using the stagger animation until the required medication and / or drugs are consumed or a much more time has passed  10-15 minutes. The existing health mechanics are fine as is, I was refering about making some changes to them to make survival more immersive.
---
I also wasn't suggesting a  completely redesigning the loot economy. Many of the changes I suggested tie into this and it would rework itself. Server hopping for example - I get this isn't an easy fix and probably the hardiest of them all. As someone who works in the games industry myself, I find it hard to believe that the game was designed with server hopping in mind. I for one wouldn't want that as a key feature and I highly doubt Bethesda did or still do. Surely you want your players to be immersed in the world they join, not constantly hopping in and out of different ones every 2-3 minutes to farm legendary monsters. This change also spills into adventure mode. The problem that persists with server hopping is that it means infinite access to legendary monsters and loot. You can just swap every time you want something different. I do it myself and I see people doing it constantly as well because the end game has literally become just that - Server hopping to farm. While it isn't the best solution, a cool down on server swapping could be implemented to stop folks constantly swapping in and out. The finer details would be for the developers to decide and it looks like something of this nature might be coming in the near future based on the most recent video from Juice head. Also on the subject of how loot is spawned and distributed, I'm most certain that they have build systems for loot spawning and distribution so it would be a matter of changing spawn rates for certain items. They clearly haven't manually placed millions of items around the world because different items spawn at different locations and sometimes they don't spawn at all. This is also something that was done many times by modders to make loot more scarce in Fallout 4.
---
I understand that there has been some good indication that the studio you are refering to has taken the lead on Fallout 76, but lets not pretend that they do not resources beyond that studio considering all of the studios operate under the BG umbrella. Just recently Todd Howard and friends did their talk about how many studios it took to make the game. There's a lot of money and resources in this company as one of the biggest studios in the world and I'm sure they could funnel a bit more towards Austin should they need to. With all that said I don't want to digress. The point I want to make is that none of the suggestions I've made are outrageous or unachievable. Many of them have been done before either in Fallout 4 or other survival games.
---
do the same thing as OP, show us that it's just as smooth.
---
Lvl 35 automatic Explosive weapon.
---
I mean i roughly believe you but still not fully lol.
---
This is actually really awesome, it's moments like these that make me truly appreciate this game.
---
Oh man, I lost my mind the first time I heard the officer. I had no clue what I was looking for, and he was dead on the ground so it took even longer to find him
---
Ok. 
---
I don't think that's useful and the GUI is already pretty encumbered.
---
It wouldn't bring much to have a bar showing your item's condition if the current one isn't enough for you.
---
Yes, there are literally thousands of worlds so it's very rare to go back to the one you previously were in (but it does happen). The only way to reliably do this is to have a friend on that server and you can rejoin them. I have a couple dozen 'friends' on my list from trading and whatnot and I will typically always join one of their servers so if I crash, I can just hop back on. However, even if you do this in your situation, you will still have to reclaim the workshop, but your stuff should still be there provided no one else has claimed it or demolished your work. 
---
Something to try, is if you build things you like, blueprint them. That way, when you take over the workshop again you can just drop the blueprints down. I personally wouldn't spend my own resources building up a workshop since you can lose it at the drop of a hat (server shut down, crash, disconnect, another player takes it). When you a building, you'll see the resources in green. When they change to yellow, that means you are using  your own scrap now because the workshop ran out of that one. After you've held it for a while, the workshop will slowly accumulate more scrap but it's very slow. Also remember that owning a workshop marks you for PvP, even if you have pacifist enabled.
---
...last night

Yes, I've noticed but... I was well into the game before I realized the  drums I was hearing all the time was actually weapons firing in the distance.

Very interesting observations, I considered a sneak build myself because at first glance the game offers very nice effects and perks. Then I realized how glitchy it is when I used chameleon armor/mutation and stealthboy mod power armors. No way a real person should be able to see me but supermutants and ghouls rushed straight to me and scorchbeasts sonic attacked me when I should be completely invisible. However I found out when I used objects terrains and trees as cover, as one would do in real life, the game observes that most of the time and I would be safe. Camouflage and bushes don't help much, if any, but terrain and buildings and large trees help a lot.

&gt; we didnt have any good alien guns until the expansion Mothership Zeta

This fucking game is playing this game like its Doom.

Is it 20 before ammosmith or after? Because adding that plus super duper I imagine yields at least that much anyways.

---
I wasn't a fan of it either.  It was still better than the auction houses, and if you are grouped with friends when it drops you can still transfer the items.  I don't think that is going to be an issue here as they are letting players sell through vendors.  I simply saying they need to make it so legionaries drop more often, and are guaranteed with certain kills and/or events.  Specific loot tables to bosses would be nice too.
---
I just don't want the game to turn into server hopping to shop vendors to progress you character faster.  That is the absolute wrong way for any game's character advancement.
---
Gatling laser uses fusion cores as ammo? Must be nice to be a fusion core baron
---
Picked it up after holding out on it for a long time to see whether it was as bad as people said it was and must say I've been having a lot of fun with this game. As radically different as it is from the rest of the series it's still pretty good though I imagine launch was complete Hell but I'm glad to see that Bethesda hasn't just given up on this game after all the backlash they received.
---
I had an automatic two shot explosive and it seriously just broke the game I liturally didn't even need to carry any other guns. Shotgun ammo is easy to find I didn't even need to worry about ammo. I sold it to some random guy for like 6000 caps. This was before survival mode came out kinda made me regret my decision.
---
Before ammo smith. With super duper and ammo with you get 34 per craft. Getting 85 per craft is reasonable IMO.

COD, etc..  for me, fallout 76 (and 4) are more like turn based RPGs, where your "turns" are dictated by your action points..  the fun for me is the knowledge and planning that goes into creating the most efficient build, so that i can kill enemies as efficiently as possible - so that i can kill them before my "turns" (AP) run out and it is their turn to come at me..  the same way in a turn-based RPG you would choose the most appropriate weapon for the fight, choose which form of attack to use, how best to spend the number of strikes you have, etc - that is the fun in the combat for those type of games, and it's the same for me choosing the right perks, the right weapon to exploit those perks, etc..
---
admittedly i don't charge around like OP, i am a much slower, calculated player, but to each their own..  i put over 2000 hours into fallout 4 playing it like this, and never got bored..  the only reason i moved on was before fallout 76 came out!
---
thats a great comparison lol. Its more or less accurate.
---
right... and i don't think anyone did.
---
it seems to me that it was actually the other way around: people were making fun of those mentioning the p2w aspect, ridiculing this hypothetical, and being angry at those who just pointed out that bethesda are walking back on their promise.
---
commenting on something does not mean you've "lost your shit", but a lot of people in the comments very clearly lost their shit over something way more trivial, so it doesn't seem to matter whether there's any good reason to lose your shit or not.
---
Holy shit it looks like you're playing DooM 2016
---
that sucks donkey balls. sorry that happened to you. now I know to go slow and careful. thanks for sharing this.
---
Welcome to an Online Fallout, just watch out for the players who role-play as A-Holes, sorry should have said Raiders, AKA Professional A-Holes.  
---
Thankfully I have met far more friendly players than not-so-friendly, just be careful out there, it can be dangerous, but also amazing.
---
If you play alone versus regular NPCs, you can, but as soon as you fight a bigger boss (not that there are many), you need to be quite careful.
---
No perks can fully prevent you to get damage, you can just have a high chance to not get damage. 
---
But I find that quite fun actually, this adds a challenge to the game
---
Yeah.  Back when Survival came out, I thought about making a character for that and starting over.  But what would be the end result?  Bloodied anything is pretty powerful, as is melee, and out of sheer laziness (i.e. not wanting to craft a ton of ammo to stay afloat), I'd probably gravitate back in that direction regardless.
---
Try a different build?  Again, I could do it on my main by swapping cards and a point or two around.
---
Stealth has been fixed and has nothing to do with the explosive shotguns tho. Server hopping is also unrelated and infact promotes OP clear speed with Explosive shotguns.
---
Not very strong counterpoints.
---
Fun is relative, some girl made 12k caps of picking and selling blackberries the first 20days after launch.
---
I mean you make your own fun, i don't feel like shotguns need to be pointlessly nerfed don't get me wrong but a lot of other weapons way underperform in comparison. *cough missile launcher*
---
It was probably both, lets be real. If someone was duping, they were probably also using the carry-weight glitch as well.
---
Omg yes
---
Is it though?  I suppose that would put it on par with like the chaingun ammo which seems okay at the rate it spits ammo.
---
and?
---
Oh I’m not doubting anything at this point! I’ve had a lot of crazy random things happen, nothing to make me stop playing by no means, but definitely have ran into my share of “bugs” but luckily not this! I have scraped outfits accidentally but that was my fault and I was still pissed.
---
... in the dark
---
Honestly if they buffed the loot of the fort defiance "line in the sand" mission, that is a great coop mission or maybe made the SB a 3star...something to encourage more people to do it.
---
No worries. Im trying to bring more of this kind of issue to light. Cause this play style is an issue. Its blatantly too easy. I weave in nuka grenades as well usually. The gif was also ignoring all loot, which usually takes time.
---
I added rifles back into my build to mix it up a bit and its such an insane ammo difference. Cant wait for this nerf to actually make other builds strong.
---
Praise him!
---
Where did you come from where did you go??
---
Any good non random encounter alien weapons lol
---
The least armored enemy in the game past level 50 are charred ghouls with 115.
---
Super mutant warlords are around 170.
---
What you see has absolutely nothing to do with an enemy's armor values, a super mutant with no "armor" is just as tough as one wearing the full armor suit they can have. It is purely visual so they look slightly different from one to the next. 
---
The way Bethesda made enemies was to give them arbitrary amounts of armor that increases with level for no reason other than higher level enemies should have higher stats, completely defeating the point of the armor system's theoretical nuance. Take any enemy and multiply their level by 3, and that's about how much armor they have, there are only scorched and ghouls that break this trend by having level times two ish armor instead of 3.
---
Everything else is purely health differences
---
But it's the mothman who looks guilty.
---
semantics really, im able to non stop spam crits that all 1 shot super mutants on torso shots.
---
white knight doesn't work with power armor anyway, so if above poster is using power armor exclusively and commenting about white knight he's probably wrong
---
Where did you come from MOTHMAN IS COTTON EYE JOE
---
I understand you and I'm glad you didn't took it the bad way. In no way I want to tell people how to play the game they spent hours and money on!
---
usually I loot as I go, this was just to show the full speed of an explosive shotgun.
---
It'll make a big difference to me. I run a support/medic build and Friendly Fire is a really fun perk I completely neglect as I never have enough ammo. Now I'll actually be able to use my flamer for more than 2 seconds at a time.
---
That's not OP, that's pretty realistic. If in real life you should be able to one or two shot a strong enemy with a DB shotgun, you should be allowed to achieve that in game with a rare weapon and proper perks. If they have to nerf this they are running out of ways to enhance the longevity of the game.
---
I guess carrying a tonne of weapons like assault rifles would have added to the strain but most people just had thousands of weight worth of junk, which is fine.
---
Awesome photo 👍
---
I dont think my gun is OP as I dont think the OP gun is. Its a great roll on a corresponding build from an experienced player that knows how to use it. Easily within best possible rolls, as DB shotty is revolving around ridiculous firerate but with frequent reload, quad is the best prefix here. I see zero reasons for why it shouldn't be amazing in such conditions, on the contrary, if what we seen wouldn't be insanely smooth there'd be room for uncomfortable questions.
---
The knock
---
&gt; How is this fun?
---
Looks like he's playing Doom 2016.
---
Which is infinitely more fun than Fallout 4's general gunplay.
---
You may already know this but it's because of the ridiculous agility you can get with the unyielding gear. I just switched to an unyielding build last weekend and it's pretty great. A couple ranks of Sneak plus Escape Artist and you're basically undetectable.
---
Melee build, PA (just because I'm farming legendaries thus usually overencumbered), sniper secondary.
---
I put a point under Charisma for Tenderizer (make enemy take 5% damage)
---
Excavator PA (+100 carry weight) with Motion assist servos ( +2 Str)
---
I'm betting it was both. If you were duping, you were probably also carry weight glitching too. People were either too dumb, or didn't care that their "playstyle" was was one of the factors effecting server stability. And then I bet those dupers had the nerve to get on youtube and complain about all the crashing they were causing.
---
Quest lol.  I did a mine event before it was gonna close in and I got 5 bf and a fusion core
---
So incisor should be very overpowered?
---
Is there anything in 76 that hints at aliens. I always use to look at the night sky but they never put anything up there in any of the games lol.
---
I think that in-real life banks should sell money printing machines, obviously highly priced but once you buy one you can just print your own money.
---
^ this is what's wrong with your suggestion.
---
I feel like that would have a bad effect like all the duping of God teir items caused when the game came out. 
---
Maybe if the recipe was destroyed and you got a one time craft out of it. So you could choose what you wanted to put it on. Then yeah.
---
I felt exactly the same, I love having the freedom I've earned to build or make whatever
---
Stealth is still broken.
---
I can still easily enconter the issue where I go Hidden &gt; Caution &gt; Danger in 1 second flat with no enemy having line of sight and when this happens once it will keep happening no matter what until I server hop; it happens least once every couple of hours. I don't know what causes it so I cannot prevent it from happening, I can only fix it by logging out or sever hopping.
---
Moreover stealth damage bonus will not apply if you engage in a fight where two or more other opponnents not in your faction are already fighting each other.
---
Yes, one makes one's own fun however not sure how this applies to this scenario.
---
Either way yes, explosive weapons in general got severely shafted months ago when instead of a much needed review of dps and durability they got the Demolition Expert nerf instead. Because fairness and all that.
---
They need to also nerf the bloodied builds then as well.   With the right combination a Gauss can easily run 1K dmg or even some of the stupid OP melee weapons get there. 
---
Part of the issue is the stacking of effects.  You add 5 Demo Expert and 5 Adrenaline to an explosive shotgun build and heck pop a psycho while you are at it and yes it can get pretty ridiculous.  
---
My explosive double barrel runs 272 dmg without Adrenaline or chems initiated.   I don’t run Four Leaf Clover or Better Crits.
---
Nice! I think The Clash would go well with FO76!
---
Plans are individual items. There's no way to seperate X amount of .45 ammo to sell, so you'd have to put *all* of it up for sale at Y per bullet.
---
They also have a carry weight of 0.1, so while they didn't cost me Atoms, they do cost inventory space, so I might as well use them.  Just like flux.
---
Its not the explosive shotguns that's OP, its all the additional AP refresh armor pieces and OP's character's stacked build.  5x Sentinel armor, 4x Power gear - that's not the average player in game.
---
Therefore my first post.
---
The important thing is you’re having fun now.
---
"It just works!"
---
-Todd
---
We use Suppressors, not Silencers right?
---
Doesn't that just dampen the report of the gun? I'm not gun savvy, so maybe someone will educate me?
---
I dont disagree. I can actually do pretty much this exact same clear with a normal quad shotgun. Explosive does so much more for the shotgun than any other gun. It basically turns any crit into a guarantee that all 7 pellets land and explode. The actual ballistic shotgun damage is reduced by range but the damage I'm mostly dealing is explosive. This is whats being nerfed. I think.
---
With a non explosive shotgun you just have to get up way way closer. If im in close quarters any double barrel to the face will 1 shot a super mutant.
---
Who’s joe?
---
Yes I did but cheers anyway. 
---
How incredibly different is sneak build with unyielding compared to “sneak” mods/Armor perks. You’re not wrong when you say undetectable, I don’t think I have been “sighted” or even “detected” since changing gears.
---
But the flamer will eat that 20 ammo in one click. I've been waiting on the day I can use my medic and heal my teammates with holy fire.
---
When I first started, during the bera, and while still only level 2. The mothman appeared for it knew death and destruction had arrived ;-)
---
You can't one shot every mob in, also you have to actually aim lol. But it does look like a doom gameplay, and I agree the gunplay is much more satisfying!
---
True, but I'm not really standing still very often in this clip and my health barely moves. The powered gear though is a big part. That AP regen lets me play as gungho as this. But thats exactly what needs nerfing.
---
To add to that, just make sure if your planning to open a shop/Camp for other players (Like ive built) that you ALWAYS LEAVE PASCIFIST ON. 
---
No PVP on your side means no damage to your camp :) 
---
I'm even considering putting a turret or two inside the shop as it were sort of acting like a 'Bouncer' lol. Since they have also been updated to do extra damage scaling against players
---
I had the same issue with many of them. I had to stop shooting it right when it came out of the ground. I let it get up and glow and do a couple attacks before tagging it and now I get drops just fine.
---
Didn't think about that haha.
---
You can also attach lights directly onto the poles too.
---
Handguns are probably the weakest weapon, even with full perks. Guerilla seems to work better though.
---
It has its ups and downs. Like this for example:
---
Launch - Major down
---
release of Wild Appalachia DLC - Up
---
putting repair kits on the atomic shop - down
---
the sheepsquatch stuff - up.
---
Player vending is next and I just hope it breaks the trend and its a up.
---
No you see, it has interesting implications on freedom of enemy design, and creates nearly limitless space for interesting weapons, effects, and enemies to all exist in their own niches.
---
You can give an enemy 100 000 hitpoints but no armor, and it would take different weapons to kill than one with 1000 hitpoints and 1000 armor by nature, rather than having one single best weapon in all circumstances.
---
The problem is Bethesda doesn't have any enemies in this game that are different than standard fare formula of level times three armor. If you make all enemies the same, then all weapons that are more or less effective against this one type of enemy will be the best or worse, even if theory says an enemy can exist that the weapon would do better against.
---
The difference between deathclaws, fog crawlers, sheepsquach, sentry bots, and super mutants is one has more or less health than the others, there is no other significant difference between them when it comes to shooting them dead, so the same weapon is always the best weapon.
---
I think the one time use recipe would be a great way to do it! There's a hundred different ways they could go with this idea, I just wanted to get the foundation for the idea out there.
---
the best thing i have read all week, is this guy bragging about meaningless video game bullshit calling someone else a loser on the internet.  thats gold Jerry, GOLD!
---
I read this in a very screechy voice, and was quite amused :)
---
Different strokes. I'm perfectly content with the existence of OP gear in Fallout, and really, I get the most satisfaction out of games like this once I've collected max level gear and am able to just start tearing through enemies without feeling like I'm resource starved.  IMHO, in games like this, regular enemy mobs should eventually just be pushovers, with the real gameplay challenge coming from end-game bosses.
---
Now, with all that said, E shotguns in this game were probably OP, at least compared to what is achievable with other weapons.  As powerful as bloodied CAN be, I don't think it's OP because it does very much require more trade-off and awareness to use successfully.
---
I'm torn between arguing that the video clearly demonstrates that the gun is OP or agreeing that it's not, considering it is likely the best gun in the game. This isn't like saying melee was OP vs. guns, in that any melee weapon with the right perk cards makes someone insanely stronger at level 6. This is a very specific, very rare gun, and arguably the best gun in the game. Can it clear an entire build of level 68 super mutants in under a minute? Yeah. Should it be able to? Probably.
---
It's not a nerf per se.  They're fixing a bug.  The 20% increase down from a 100% increase was implemented a while ago.  So no nerf unless that bug affected you since the original change.
---
Yep, really it just makes it inconvenient to make stuff for yourself, via transfers through trusted friends. What would fix a lot is a mailbox system for bartering. See warcraft. Then you could just mail your own stuff to yourself. And allow camp items to be mailed too. Let me sell my missle turrets to the people who cant be bothered to invite me and pay me.
---
I think its 1500 over you're carry weight. I might be and probably am wrong.
---
I'm not retired, but I am old.
---
GT = TEH RED ZMAN
---
Got a group of us that have a bustling Village just to the east of Vault 76.
---
High agility improve you steath a lot. And...  be sure your pipboy lamp is turned off ;)
---
I run with around 30 AGI and I never get caught with a melee build or gun with silencer.
---
Also NPC sometimes fire back at you but they didnt spot you. They just fire where they think you are, if you move, you can see them searching where you were. This is quite a cool behavior.
---
I mean, yeah, so will a plasma flamer or a minigun. It's really not that bad anymore. I have mods that make it more efficient and since it's a two shot and I'm using it to heal rather than hurt enemies it's fine.
---
oh you know they are gonna sell it on the atom store
---
It will ne nice to get rid of some unwanted stuff rather than dropping it on the floor. Even if it only makes a cap or two its better than nothing.
---
On that note, do we know if there is anything you cant sell?
---
Like normal vendors, you cant sell them certain things like Ammo. I was wondering if we can sell everything in our own shop? To be fair if its our shop we should decide what we want to sell after all lol

You can see the biggest change in how any recommendation post in r/Fallout isn't automatically met with jeers and protest.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Yeah. I was just pointing it out because the crit rate has nothing to do with the weapon itself. I sit have an auto handmade. I basically start every burst as a crit and the following 2 rounds refill my crit meter for the next enemy.
---
That's true, I do like u/Chadodius's idea of the one time use recipe idea. There's multiple ways they could approach doing something like this, I just thought I'd get the base idea out there and see if they want to run with it in any way. Doubtful, but you never know.
---
Happy cake day!
---
In addition to what's already been said, I think some of the Ghouls or Scorched in the Cranberry Bog randomly drop Military-Grade Duct Tape, don't they?  It's not a reliable thing, but I'm pretty sure I've seen it on some enemy's inventory there.
---
1500 lbs over your max carry weight. So if you can carry 240 lbs, you absolute max is 1740 lbs.
---
Yes, it means that if you sell an item for 100 caps, the person buying will pay 100 caps and you'll recieve 90.
---
Plans were that CAMP damage immunity (as long as you're not Wanted) was always going to be put in with the player vending.
---
oh I hope you are right! and anyone else confirm or deny?
---
i thought it was just 1500 flat so if you are correct then its 800 base weight + 1500 = 2300 lbs?
---
that would be amazing if its the case
---
Nice set of T-51. That's what I use myself. Really looking forward to the Pale Rider skin
---
Best gun in the game - no such thing.
---
There is only best tool for given relationship between position of the shooter and the shot target. Tesla is infinitely better for shooting enemies you dont see that will see you before you see them when you enter a building. Shotgun users will be shredded to pieces by a sniper, if sniper is aware of shotgunner position for last 300 meters. What OP demonstrated was how close range godroll is shredding at close range. If it wouldn't be doing so, there would be no reason for its existence. What we see here is an example of thing that is not OP. Its a thing that is just right.
---
Good look out there in Appalachia!
---
The world would be better with more forward thinking people like you😁
---
awesome!!! thank you for the confirmation!
---
this 800 fills up so darn fast :(
---
this would be cool except for the fact I crash every time I pick a lock :(
---
Maybe have mutated poo monsters spawn in your camp gardens overtime.
---
Pretty sure (though I haven't looked at the legal side of things with Pandora) that it would take a licensing agreement (aka $$$) to integrate Pandora into the game.  That's not the kind of thing you can just code in and hope no one notices.
---
Seems they charge $27/mo for businesses, per instance.  How many copies of FO76 would they need to license that for?
---
Bastards! Well thank you. At least i know that now.
---
If only stairs could be flush against walls 🤔
---
Mk3 I’m confused? Fallout 76 Stealth boys in quick menu are bugged
---
Hell yeah :).
---
Sorry for any misunderstanding.
---
Yeah as much I like the sleek futuristic look of the X-01, I still like the older bulkier pre-war army look of the T-51, almost looks like a human tank plus it's the best armour in the game ballistic and energy resistance wise.
---
Don't let minor annoyances like not being in game stop you from being in game! ;-)
---
Buzz Blade is my new main. I've got Instigating and Furious variants and they absolutely wreck shit with sneak attacks. I'm gonna be so sad if Bethesda nerfs the over repaired damage boost.
---
....with the lube
---
Vanguard sentinel gives you the best odds. 
---
Critical hits ignore damage resistance, so a critical will cut straight through sentinel, but the extra 175 damage reduction at full health from vanguard can still reduce the damage of the first critical hit by enough that unless your opponent is running a crit spam build and can land 2 or three in one vats go then you should be able to maybe survive the rest of the normal shots, for about half a second anyways.
---
Other damage reduction effects don't help much more because they also get negated when you get crit, so the only effect that can help more than 0 in these cases are the ones that give straight armor, mutants, nocturnal, and vanguard, one of which is clearly better than the rest.
---
No, but I assume it will come back annually, as it's a real spring festival.
---
please be careful asking this question. i asked once and then men in black suits showed up at my home.
---
I had to google her and I’m none the wiser! Good talk coach!
---
Kinda 6 months too late
---
I've encountered a few enemies whose health bars go down and then back up again (mostly supermutants), but they've all died after another shot or two. I've also had enemies vanish from right in front of me before I could loot them. I haven't seen this particular mole rat though.
---
I mean i spent a lot of resources om my nuclear power generator....
---
i kinda feel beach boys is a weird choice so that slightly breaks my immersion
---
The blade broke off in the last scorched he killed.  It's doing 0 damage because he's now just smacking them with the hilt.
---
I've yet to use power armor. I always think the pictures of power armor look cool. I need to start using power armor.
---
.... Last summer.
---
*Our [stimpaks] will be legendary!*
---
100% want this to apply to CAMP plans. I keep thinking about starting an alt to make a new CAMP, but I'd only have access to basic stuff and it always puts me off. Its especially irksome since Atom Shop CAMP items are account bound and it just sort of FEELS like it should be true across the board.
---
Would be fine if armor/weapon/mod plans weren't account-bound but....let me build a nice CAMP. I would legit even pay for this. :(
---
Aside from the suggestions here, always check vendors, especially at Whitespring and Watoga. I've gotten more good legendaries from vendors than I have from my own drops.
---
On the contrary I’m looking forward to a lot of what’s coming in the next patch! Player vending machines and backpacks are both something I’m looking forward to :-)
---
I resorted to trying to run away like a sissy and then leaving the server before I lost all my carefully chosen junk. His health bar would go down to a scrap of red before springing back to life repeatedly. Very annoying!
---
Yeah, someone posted info about that sound here earlier. It starts to be a little bit annoying over time. Guess I'll make a mod to make it silent quite soon.
---
Lifegoal. Cheap suit, combover, "This PA is a STEAL man!"
---
I only thought it was a typewriter.  They were laundering enigma machines!  😨
---
Good bot. Do you do 0 lbs?
---
Lmao ohh no my fake internet points how dare you. I promise I'll continue to state the obvious because idgaf about karma. FYI if OP had stated they were away from the game I'd have posted differently.
---
This is the best idea to reduce caps from the economy although I am doubtful they would employ this tactic as it would hurt or eliminate their revenue stream.  If implemented this would work like gangbusters
---
Your Alabama daughter
---
I think what actually happens is that her AI skips a beat, and my guess is that it occurs because there's a very specific, maybe frame-perfect point where you can interrupt what she's doing and she'll never come back to it.
---
Now, why they couldn't just put a "Hey, I'm 1000m from the nuke zone, maybe I should turn around and fly back" catch-all on it, I don't know.
---
Oh..... good to know.
---
I was under the impression you were going to hate the flagging of top players etc.
---
The restoring thing is something I've noticed before as well (and taught me to slow down, probably before I scrapped something good...I think...)
---
It doesn't seem to make any sense.  If a list is sorted, and you scrap something on the list, the list should have no reason to change at that point (other than to take the item away).  I've watched a stack of items jump around the list when I'm scrapping single items, which honestly is a scary thing to happen when you're permanently destroying something.
---
only just comleted that at l100. on ps4,and had no major issues. watch out for rosie not where you excpect her to be,she'll be somewhere around but not always at the top.
---
had the pointer direct me UNDER top of world.Came back later to find her.
---
anyone want the armour ?  still in my stash.
---
My bad I have some shitty reading comprehension.
---
I finished but didn't turn in, and logged off. Had to restart from beginning. 
---
Then I finished half and logged off, and it remembered my progress. 
---
I guess the moral is, you might get it to work, but be prepared to have to try a few times. The plus side is you keep the exp for each partial quest completion.
---
Unless you can reach 1000+ damage per hit incisor helps a lot (armor multiplied by 6 is the threshold, so even for ghouls it's over 700), if you are below about 300 (armor times 6 after reducing 75%) per hit it is the most powerful perk for damage output you can put on any weapon from any class. It is so good you don't need armor piercing effects on your weapons at all to still wipe the floor with all kinds of enemies, while guns that can't get 3 different sources of armor piercing really struggle to shine.
---
Legendary 50 armor piercing + 40% armor piercing magazine mod + 36% armor piercing perk, all combined on a rifle are only barely better than just incisor on it's own.
---
You could possibly tie it to different challenges, like “[Username] The collector” for finding different bobbleheads and magazines, or “Appalachia Traveler [Username]” for finding different locations.
---
Ooh yes that bit I despise 😂 This whole leaderboard / top 3 market business belongs in a battle royale or death match mode.
---
All the tickets are filed through [our website here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10). Please let me know when you get that ticket number. Unfortunately, our team cannot restore lost items but with your ticket number, we can investigate what happened so we can address it in a future update.
---
Not really but I’ve been using them and I think they are in a good spot in pvp and pve just ammo is a problem :/
---
Yes for sure. Luckily..and im sure everyones pretty similar all the weapons i use are legendary..so none of those can get scrapped..but..i do have a collection of rare outfits id lose my mind if they disappeared.
---
It is tube on end of gun. Who cares? I am not american, here we don't have guns at home :D silencer is easy to remember how to spell so it is silencer! Ok?
---
Not from me. Too heavy, too slow, not powerful enough.
---
If you don’t dry your typewriter thoroughly after washing it will rust. Also the gentle motion of the tumble dryer tends to knock loose any dust or other particles not removed during the wash cycle. Highly recommended.
---
I had been using a two-shot Gatling up until the 2 shot nerf so I guess I need to do some research on what the current meta is.
---
I had the same problem in fort defiance but with ghouls instead. They would just stand there and make noises but wouldn't die.
---
Unless you have a stack of 15 plans so I assume you can pick and choose how much of each item you want to sell. Tho I think the min will be 1 cap per item making ammo a touch more expensive.
---
You mean my stash of 75 fedoras insn't going to make me rich when player vending comes around? :P
---
(I'm only slightly exaggerating - plus I have a big pile o' fasnacht masks and other drops from both events...I don't even want to count them)
---
Not so hard, I made a few friends.  (Although one of them is now playing survival mode.  Went to join his session -- "wonder what that little campfire icon means?" -- "what the fuck, why is it putting my name on a death list on the top of the screen, let me out of here!")
---
And?
---
We need a oh shit reverse button when we scrap a good gun we didn't want to. 
---
Only cuz I don't know why I keep hitting that button every once in awhile..
---
as are new players.might be just late night servers,but seeing a big increase coming out the vault on adventure.
---
No, I mean they are actually two different things, not the same and that is why you get spotted by Super Mutants.
---
Fuck yes, they did.
---
Damage buff, durability buff. Heavy weapons are badass now.
---
I saw it. It was in fort defiance a few weeks ago.
---
I have 20 agi, and they spot me, with ranged weapons more with melee. Thats my point.
---
By me owning the plans and being able to edit other people's camos while on teams
---
Awesome! Is Gatling still the primary one? I always wanted to use the 50cal but it was hot garbage before.
---
Maybe they won't allow us to sell anything below ten caps?  Here's hoping.
---
I want to say there was a technical reason with the save files on why players can't rename characters? I'll have to ask the Dev's again about that.
---
[im just gonna make some popcorn and check back at this thread throughout the day, should be interesting](https://imgur.com/GDNyuPn)
---
Where's the actual launch silo for site alpha?
---
I've seen players use the metal mesh floors as temporary sky lights. But we mentioned to the Dev's before how that is a player CAMP request. :)
---
But this begs the question, is it your shotgun or your build that causes this?  Because I can assure you I could not do this with my TSE combat shotgun.  My toon is also more of a merchant / crafting build because that's my playstyle.  I carry a shotgun to can hold my own, but nowhere near this.
---
The most boring thing is that Your stealth attacks don't count if the target is engaged with one molerat...
---
Anti armor explosive  is the meta for pvp but with heavy weapons it’s kinda hard because you stand still and your gone so you gotta always be moving
---
So in the clip you are pressing Q + space bar on almost every kill? Always crits? So you mean when you fire a crit it refills the crit meter on its own?
---
You just missed out on The Action Hero.  It was the challenge given for completing a weekly survival mode challenge.  You had to:
---
Craft 40 molotovs
---
Craft 40 energy ammo
---
Craft 40 explosive ammo
---
Craft/scrap 20 melee weapons
---
craft/scrap 20 ranged weapons
---
I run a Two shot gatling gun, but this is a nice secondary.
---
The Action Hero is a 2 shot heavy machine gun (.50 cal) that reloads 15% faster, and fires 25% faster.
---
There are good consequences of the current game decisions that you neglect. Junk trading would be nonexistent on survival servers that were mode locked. The gap between endgame gear and initial gear had been made smaller several times already, and the fixer is enough to get you started in PvP if you played your cards and your build right. The main gap in PvP was, is, and for a long time will be the knowledge. I have on my hand at least two "holy shit it really works this way" obscure game mechanics that are not yet publicly known. The best survival strategy is to seek those who learned some interesting thing and apply that to your gameplay. The fact that you can freerly jump into more open PvP mode and then go back to adventure to play with your newly joined friends is great. For you and lone wanderers map markers are an immersion breaker. For PvP gangs its a method of communicating with other PvP gangs and while I agree we could have other tools for that in game too, don't take away what we already have if there is nothing new you give back.
---
I'd love to see more danger from weather, and in all these months I observed how survivals PvE became more deadly. For months I could stand surrounded by ghouls attacking me and ignore them. Now being surrounded by four of them means being torn to pieces and I love that. I'm all in for making the wasteland more challanging environment, but I'm fully against doing it through mechanics that are in the long run boring. I came here to compete in a obscure, vaguely desrcibed, knowledge-based environment, against other brilliant bastards trying to take me down. I'm not even interested in random PvP, I don't shoot all noobs I meet, I'm searching for the hunters and trying to make them prey. There are shittons of other games where you can die because of hunger, but there are very little titles that could compare to F76 greatest strengths. Some of the changes suggested here would make it even better. Others would take away all thats unique and marginalized the previous strengths.
---
You are nothing, please wander in traffic :)
---
There is a cap on weight reduction percentage. So for instance, if you already run Bandolier rank 2 and then put on a piece of armor with ammo weight reduction, you wont see a difference because the perk card already got you to the cap of 90%. Most of the weight reduction legendary effects follow a very simply outcome: the associated perk cards can get you to the 90% cap, at the cost of perk card points while a 5 piece set of the armor will get you to the 90% cap with 10% wasted. Now there are some additional benefits to getting your needed WR through armor, in that you get a blanket affect (think of FDC reduction negating BOTH your Thru Hiker and Traveling Pharmacy cards and Ammo reduction negating both Bandolier and Batteries Included). 
---
In my experience, and as someone who runs a 4 pc FDC WR and 1 pc Ammo WR set, I am able to essentially get rid of Thru Hiker and Traveling Pharmacy and rank down Bandolier without noticing an too much of an issue with carry weight.
---
I have found queen, when there was no nuke zone on that server, so she often maybe comes back after few hours.
---
No problem friend! :)
---
What!? That is really the worst luck I've heard of. I mean, statistically you should have found a 3 star  something in almost six months.
---
Especially for us loners with no friends or anything it would be nice to have a little pooch along.
---
This photo is incredible! Mind if we share this on the Fallout twitter on Monday?
---
Something something lamp... Nuke launches are bright?
---
I do have it equipped, but the corpses that don't explode still disappear :/
---
echo's my thoughts excactly.
---
.
---
I bet those damn pesky raiders were up to no good, **putting them typewriters in them washers and dryers**... honestly, where do they get their kicks?!
---
Solid colors would be cool, but better yet, a system like the Halo games have always had where you can change color of main pieces, visors, emblems and accents separately would be awesome.
---
I'd happily pay for something like this out of the Atom Shop.
---
So YOU got a reply (with not a single definitive piece of information, like WHEN it will occur) that doesnt mean EVERYONE got a reply
---
Are you an innocently banned player?
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
Dang, nice drop. For whitesprings that's a freaking unheard of drop.
---
I have dense on my chest piece with fire proof 3.  The most I do is break a limb sometimes.  Do virtually no damage to myself.
---
They wont ever stack with the relevant perks, its an either-or thing. 
---
Thats why WWR is by far the most valuable- you can take care of junk with 3 cheap perks, food and aid are 6 perks, but WWR covers 12 perks (melee, pistols, HW, shotguns) and grenades/mines, and rifles, which don’t even get perks. 
---
Any weight reduction is capped at 90%
---
I have lost a X01 Chest piece and two of my friends have lost X01 legs.
---
\&gt;  And how do people carry all these weapons and armor without being over weight? 
---
Excavator PA with motion assist servo's.  Will add calibrate shocks as soon as I have the appropriate flux.  Weight reduction perks for armor and weapons.  AP regen speed perks.
---
Carry a lot, and have a lot more stashed. Still overencumbered.  
---
Not being able to fast travel is good in that if forces exploring - 
---
it only a PITA when the quest areas are scattered around the map :)
---
My camp is a 2 story mess. I've been wanting to start from scratch but I just rather roam around then rebuild build a camp
---
At least it’s not just me I guess.
---
Passing this request along!
---
Correction - no one cares what YOU think
---
If you were smart enough to READ the OP you would see I have NEVER been banned or suspended (feel free to send me your GT and I will come smash you in game to prove it you idiot)
---
Do you have rank 3 equipped?  I haven’t seen any vanishing corpses, but upon forgetting to re equip after some crafting I left super duper on and the vanishing bug hit.
---
Add dirty water to the things added.  2 dirty waters if you have dysentery.
---
I hope we will get companions some day - even if it's just dogs / mongrels / other smaller creatures.
---
yeah.  maybe I left duper on.
---
Ask for compensation, OP.
---
Feel free to post it. Glad Bethesda noticed it as well :)
---
If you haven't found the story, you're just plain not trying.
---
Do they actually vanish or do they just turn into a blood pile? That seems to be happening to quick these days but I always find them the piles are exactly where they died not wear they rag doll to
---
I picked it up on Monday and am extremely happy I did. Hopefully people see how things are turning around and dive in. I actually like the no human NPC thing more than I thought I would. There were times in FO4 where I would get impatient and rush through the conversations using the subtitles.
---
When in the history of games (with this many working systems and inventories) have you experienced a perfectly functional game? Do we all know what it takes to create a 'functional' game? When you bake a cake, does it turn out to be perfect everytime you combine the ingredients? We learn and we improve. The point is, we have a game that we can complain about. The other point is, unless we have the same programming skill sets and can write better code... or even have produced a perfectly functional game of massive scale, we should be realistic here.
---
You can't have chat on a mobile game, and that's what F76 is - overhyped mobile game. Now let's all get virtually drunk, take pictures and share on facebook ...
---
So that wasn't just me noticing it! It's like a crit is a guaranteed hit!
---
I once had a 0% chance of hitting a Protectron's combat thingy limb part(I don't know what's it's called) with my combat shotgun, I accidentally shot a crit and it hit him in that exact spot, which was on his back, and he was facing me straight on. I had more like that but with 11% on other things.
---
I still don't know cause I got distracted taking pictures of the Mothman and then I had to go to fight the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Well, feel lucky you were able to loot him, both he and the imposter keeps disappointing for me. Yeah, I’ve tried all the tricks (wait till he melts, fast travel away, use the camera, etc.).
---
Cue the raider with the chain saw.
---
Yeah its a Stealth Combat Rifle. But its fixed at level 30. Once you know the plan, you can craft level 50 versions.
---
Im on xbox unfortunatly, appreciate the offer though
---
Now IM sad I never made a shotgunner. Maybe if I start now the nerf wouldnt affect the character too much and I could still 1 shot things.
---
Yeah, Pandora definitely needs exposure. Like when someone wants a graphic artist or coder to do a logo or app for free because it'll be good exposure for them. Gtfoh.
---
It isn't the amount that is important, it is the method. There are better ways, that involve consent, rather than automatically taxed transactions that one party is going to get bent over on. 10% on an expensive item is going to sting.
---
It's a post-apocalyptic world: food is scarce, government and law enforcement has collapsed.  Disease is rampant; the air, water and soil are toxic.  Let's play practical jokes!   😈
---
For me, the times I experienced this bug they were bodies and then just vanished before my eyes.  No meat pile, nothing.  Couldn’t even find with the camera trick.  Since making sure I’ve equipped rank 3 bloody mess I’ve had 0 vanishing corpses.  And that was about 20-30 hours of gameplay.
---
I have an explosive pump action and it can do more damage without any perks than my semi automatic rifles that I use.
---
If player vending is as popular and successful as they seem to think it will be, that 10% fee will destroy a lot of caps.
---
Over time it should produce some deflation in prices. I'm just not sure 10% is enough to outweigh the amount of caps being created.
---
Gotta say, Impartical Jokers of the wasteland would be a perfect show if someone took the time out there (here's hoping you've seen normal Impractical Jokers haha)
---
The same guy (or set of friends) using game exploits to kill people. The Regulator part was just a nod to the bounty hunter faction from Fallout 3.
---
uh, okay, but still, if anyone need it, i have it. Reminder that fixer has not only high sneak speed, it's base damage is about 20% higher than regular combat rifle
---
Pc?
---
I don’t know if I have been lucky or I just have good internet, but I have never crashed or froze out of this game
---
When I was using the MoM gear with the Eye of Ra and the Chameleon Mutation I was never detected. I couldn't carry anything... so that sucked...
---
I use heavy weapons alot and i love the 50cal. Its my primary heavy weapon, i dunno just feels good using it and feels powerful enough to me.
---
I also love the gatling plasma also. Despite how messed up it is atm.
---
they got a hefty buff a while ago
---
We have a knowledgeable expert - Real Motosan's Typewriter Repair &amp; Player Vendor Shop opening next week!
---
I've got a 3 star 50cal that's 2 shot, 10% more damage while aiming and 25 % faster reload
---
That thing can solo shred a level 80 scorchbeast in 1 mag and about 20 seconds
---
It also lasts  a long time with the perk that effects gun condition
---
I’m lvl 235 and was rewarded a lvl 30 Fixer. I hope to get the plans soon for my alt. A lvl 50 Fixer would be nice.
---
100% agree. I dont need my lvl 5 building a jet pack. I would like her to be able to craft ammo however with my mains extra resources i give to her.
---
I'll have to check that out and I mostly agree with you. Adventure mode PVE is pretty well balanced at this stage.
---
Same boat my friend i Played at launch didn't hate it but felt like it needed some polishing so left it went back to RDR2 then just last night i booted it up and man its quite fun. Optimization sure has improved since launch.
---
Right, I follow that logic. But I am saying that these synergies that you are speaking of far overshadow the lesser performing single star prefixes.
---
There is extremely low demand for one star weapons of any kind. So when I say they are trash keep in mind that I am completely comparing them to god tier gear, which is what people are actually seeking. At best those one stars are a bridge till they get something better.
---
Well I myself don't have the skills, but it's no secret that Bethesda games are known for extensive bugs and player made fixes. Perhaps they should have kept the game in development for a few more years instead of releasing a shell of a game to milk those cosmetic sales and fix it down the line.
---
I am taking a realistic approach. They nerf repair rates only to sell repair kits. There was talk of them releasing working fridges as spoil rates were increased. I follow the game with the hopes it will improve but I don't think it will. I hope they prove me wrong but I doubt it.
---
If that were in place I guess I could see myself giving it a try
---
yep. 😂 Gotta admit I'm not a very lucky person irl which also applies to all the games that are related to the infamous RNG system.
---
The game seems to drop 1 star things for me very very often and only drop 2 stars stuff in some very rare occasions.
---
My current best weapon is a 2 star Executioner's lever action rifle (which was gifted by a nice person :P )
---
Nice! Now you need to equip all of the pistol perk cards and see where that gets your damage to. It will be silly. Thanks for sharing, mate!
---
I did not cheat, nor have I EVER been banned or suspended from Fallout 76 (stated clearly in OP)  so please read the OP
---
There is NO Option to Appeal a suspension, all you can do is send in a help ticket (of which MANY are ignored)
---
Bethesda has made a massive amount of stupid mistakes in this game (well documented) and you believe they DIDN'T accidentally ban or suspend ANY innocent players?  Really, that is sad.
---
I am NOT saying they didn't (or shouldn't) ban or suspend people who CHEATED (why are 90% of the people on this forum too stupid to read or understand that?) 
---
I am NOT saying that all people who claim they are innocent are innocent, but if you think 100% of people wh were banned / suspended are guilty, then you must also believe that Bethesda NEVER MAKES ANY MISTAKES (which would make you a moron as they have made MANY)
---
If you read the OP you should understand what I am saying is
---
1. They have NOT communicated to the player base WHEN they are planning to un-suspend people (saying they will eventually "Fix it" so they can do so is utterly stupid as they have not even managed yet to fix their broken game
---
2. That they should respond to help tickets (which 100% they are not responding to all of them)
---
3. They suspended people accidentally (via their massive incompetence, which has been proven and admitted by Bethesda)
---
Bethesda is run by morons, and anyone who allows the bar to be set this low is part of the problem (they need to be held to a far higher standard)  as they are telling them "go ahead and treat us like crap, give us a broken beta game, and we will still suck your balls because we are morons"
---
Just be careful taking workshops
---
i live on pacifist mode.  I guess some people get off on grieving.  What exploit are they using?
---
Might have to pull those out of storage and have a play around. Never used them tbh. Finally curbing that fo4 hoard everything habit, can maintain light levels of loot within the backpack. Lol
---
I agree both were an issue but 1 much more than the other. They straight up said the duping was crashing servers in patch notes when they said they" fixed duplication glitches that caused server crashing" paraphrasing. At work cant find source.
---
basically yeah. im spamming Q and space non stop. thats why if you see me shoot randomly its because I thought/hoped I had a vats target.
---
Four Leaf Clover gives you a 13% chance per pellet to grant a crit. 7x13 = 91% chance to grant a crit. Add in some lag and I just seem to crit all the time.
---
Could you expand on this? I don't understand.
---
We call it the 'Whitesprings Yrashcan' paint job lol
---
I basically paid full price for a Steam Early Access game from a triple A company...change my mind.
---
If it's an exploit, report them.  Best we can do for now.  Just empty your junk collection before you go to find out.
---
Yeah? Which entirely backs up my point. Having a "hillbilly" costume in the game would be a ridiculous stereotype.
---
"everyone" lol
---
Gatling guns have some pretty impressive dph now, but they dropped the fire rate for heavy guns. It's great for everything but the queen, imo. Too slow. 
---
50 cals are pretty decent now, I think. But I haven't used one since the buff. I can tell you that it won't break during a queen fight anymore. 
---
My gatling laser is a goddammed monster now. Gatling plasmas, too. Those got the biggest buff
---
Or you could design a game that adjusts loot drop chances based on player level and hours played and give players a real sense of progress and satisfaction from end game boss battles.  Pure RNG for the sake of RNG is lazy game design.
---
We're talking about a rolling pin dropping from THE final boss in a game storyline that culminates in launching a nuclear missile, the most powerful and devastating weapon known to man.  That's just broken game design, and it's senseless.
---
Unless Bethesda is just in it for trolling, in which case, bravo, Bethesda.
---
I just open and close the vendor screen when this happens. Normally fixes it.
---
And silly would be complaining about something when I don't have the first clue of how to fix it myself.
---
I was thinking how fun it would be to develop (if only I knew how) lens profiles for Adobe for the ProSnap LOL. I was trying to wide angle perspective edit some, but with no lens profiles, it doesn't quite know what to do.
---
A nice prime lens for the ProSnap would be fun too, such as a 50mm, with nice bokah and all, rather than having to use the old photo mode to do that. There would be a lot more fun portraits :D
---
I absolutely love my wideangle, it's a Tokina 11-16. You can click back on the photo gallery link to find some of my non-fallout abandoned urbex stuff, a lot of it was shot with the wideangle.
---
Fallout appeals so much to me for the urbex aspect. Everything is abandoned, derelict, decaying. I love it, bugs and all. It's fun too that I've been to quite a few of these places, Washington DC, Vegas, Boston... haven't been to West Virginia yet though.
---
&gt; Negate server hopping significantly by only allowing it to occur once every hour. If you leave a server and boot back up the game in less than an hour then it should put you back on the same server. 
---
I have had an issue with this.
---
I have joined survival mode with my new survival only character. When I loaded into a server, it said that my camp was taken and that I could load into a new server. I accepted the change server and it kept putting me back into the exact same server over and over again. while it was trying to DC me from the server and join another one, I was being spawn killed at a train station with no means of even fighting back as the game kept kicking me and making me rejoin the exact same server. (the way I fixed it was load my main character into adventure and leave that server and load my survival character back into a different server)
---
I do agree that in most cases, you should not be able to just server hop, but some times it is needed so that you can spawn and have your camp.
---
As would the banjos, steel guitars and shine stills.
---
As others here have mentioned, we're working on a way to increase photo gallery space on consoles for a future update. As soon as we have all the details ironed out, we'll let everyone know. Most likely in an Inside the Vault.
---
It is both really. I honestly think they need to take a hard stance and start balancing perks instead of just weapons here. The numbers on some of these perks are insane and just make a bad situation worse.
---
Luck 10
---
yes it is a tax. Beth needs a method to reduce the caps in circulation to try to mitigate the inflationary trend.
---
Less caps available = lower prices overall 
---
is the theory
---
I would like a paint system like Warframe, where you can have a bunch of color pallets to choice from.
---
Ooo I know the one you mean, in the ash heap, I dive in there when it’s open for all the iron ore, never noticed the bf for the event lol....... doh😂
---
Yeah it's a pretty important part of survival mode that needs to be considered. Bases are way too weak right now.
---
Wait wait wait they finally buffed Laser/plasma heavies!?!? The laser gat is my faaaaaaav
---
You don't have to leave the world, but to just let players or NPCs take it over. So, abandon in the literal sense.
---
I have basically no utility perks. Non for carry weight anyway. I run with about 200 max carry weight and sit at around 140/200 if i clear out my inventory of all spare stuff. i usually just loot stuff as I go and happily accept the over encumbrance. With 4x Powered gear my ap regen is stupid quick.
---
Up until now I was extremely reluctant to use this, will 100% be using this in my build... thanks
---
If you own a workshop and they contest it it locks you into combat even if you die and lose the workshop. They basically farm you for caps till you server hop.
---
How many hours have you played?
---
This *usually* works for me as well.  I will add a couple things:
---
Connecting them in different order *can* help, as stated above.
---
Make sure that your cursor 'dot' is over the item you're connecting too.  Even if the item is highlighted, if the dot is pointing at something else, you may jump (this is inconsistent though).  Moving around a bit to get a better view of the item sometimes helps too, but not always.
---
If it gets stubborn quit out of editing and go back in, and try again.  This sometimes works.
---
Petting your dog and praying to the great and all-powerful mothman (yes, both at the same time) also seem to help sometimes.  ^^/s Or really any other random thing, because there doesn't seem to be any real rhyme or reason to it, but try the other things a bit and usually one of them will work.  
---
I've never run into something that doesn't eventually get connected if you try a couple of theses things.
---
If you're on PC, there is a mod that changes the button presses for repairs back to what it was. Got so sick of the repair kit prompt that I grabbed the mod. Worth it.
---
Well this is more of a technical issue that could easily be ironed out. If your camp is on the same server then of course it would still move you.
---
I feel your pain though - If I had to rebuild my camp every time I joined a server I would probably rage. Can't believe it was like that back at release. Luckily I didn't build anything fancy back then.
---
They used to give 20 scrap each when full, none of this ore nonsense.
---
I mean, not really. I get aggro through walls all the time, it doesn’t make much difference.
---
They're trying to hide the screws, damn commies...
---
When they come out of the washing machines you can use then to type secret message /s
---
I truly hope this is an intended mechanic. It would be the attention to small details like this that can continue the community.
---
I cannot correct you but I am going to put your theory to the test once I am back home.
---
There are quite a few plans I still want and to be fair I quite enjoy this event?
---
There is something quite... soothing about it despite the startling moments.
---
Standard PS4.
---
Resource collectors made 20 scrap each.  None of this ore nonsense.  The real challenge in keeping a workshop was in not being disconnected.
---
What makes it even more painful is when it’s destroyed as far as I go it takes me a good 3-4 hours of farming to repair everything “ I get distracted easy”
---
Slightly off topic as well but EFT has such a great inventory management system. I'd love to see something similar to that than the current list system but I imagine it would be a huge undertaking and difficult to make work on console platforms.
---
I don't know about that, saw a complete list of recipes in a data mined spreadsheet and there was no recipe for buffout, just bufftats and psychobuff, might have added it in the last couple months I suppose
---
No OP, we don't
---
Bethesda has some serious shortcomings with this project that absolutely need to improve, and I am not talking about the code itself.
---
All of our expectations have been set by Bethesda marketing itself.
---
The game does need to make money, but breaking promises and hyping mediocre content is not the way.
---
I love this game, but the team needs to seriously address the way they handle releases. We have stealth nerfs and hard dissapointment every release because of the words they choose to use, and the words they choose not to use.
---
I can top that up.
---
Corpses not just dissappear, the stand up and walk through the collision into the walls.
---
No kidding.
---
dude, if you want fo76 to succeed, dont drive away other players like this, its clear you are fanboy pretty hard, so shouldnt you be encouraging players to stay in the game?
---
I definitely recommend the Game of Thrones audiobooks especially since you haven't seen the show and won't have a voice expectation :) I work in a call center too and I listened to them at work and they were really good!
---
Sure, basically when you take a workshop you open yourself up to PvP and any player can come up and kill you. Many higher level players with advanced weapons and armor will be able to kill you with one shot.
---
China used this tactic to get on every market on planet, you commie bastard!!!
---
Haha That's what fallout is all about. You set out to do something then 4 hours later.... "Damn I never fixed my base".
---
Handguns are a bit weak right now, they don't have the depth of Perks available that other guns do. You can certainly use them well for questing, but they don't hold up against bigger enemies.
---
Saw you replied to me, something about calling me a dummy or some shit? 😂 so you're one of those assholes who gets pissed whenever people disagree and don't take your side. Good to know! Good luck getting through life with that mentality :)
---
Just like the Atom shop items!
---
If that's the case, wouldn't finding the perfect spot, then cancelling out and then going back in and dropping it immediately reset the cap cost? 
---
If that's the case, it's got to be a bug.
---
Ehr mah gehrd ets thu merthmern
---
I have my camp there, it's either a mothman or Yao gui stalking me
---
The banjo is art. And, were  you to look beyond Wikipedia, you'd see that there is a *proud* history of banjo making in the region.
---
Music? Same deal. Pride.
---
Moonshine? Again. Pride.
---
The notion of the toothless, shoeless, ignorant hick? No pride associated with it. 
---
It's not hard to understand.
---
btw - I love the game too, been playing since BETA.
---
Yup, all laser weapons got a damage and durability buff
---
With your mother
---
That's true I got unyielding cavalier armor so most of the time I sprinting im like in God mod, only the few seconds when I don't sprinting and refresh my ap or at the moment when I hit the enemy with Melee or guns and don't sprinting are dangerous for me. And yes... Radiation is my biggest boss enemy haha
---
Nah... Part of the fun of starting off new for me is having to find all the stuff again. I like being set at 0 again. if I can have all the plans I already have, that's way past set at zero. You do that and for those of us who may want to from time to time start off at ground zero (at least without losing the main character) will never be able to again.
---
OOF toxic much? Yikes

So, can you still repair at work shops or find these kits on Sierra bravo queens? Are you unable to obtain the cosmetic items by any other means than real currency? Some backpacks in the 'ever upwards' expansion have been noted to have increased perishables duration, but what about the good with salt perk? If you 'don't think it will', learn from this moment and find another game.
---
I've never had a problem with popping open my quick-select and looking at the condition there. That said, I wouldn't mind a little bar like what you've depicted at all. Though I'd perhaps change it to match the HP/AP bars a bit more (semi-opaque background as opposed to a thick border). Neat idea.
---
In my head it was to make tons of noise and escape a flood of feral ghouls.
---
This is my first fallout game I’ve ACTUALLY played i messed around a lil with fallout 4 but the base building is my favorite part 😁

No I think anyone who doesn't read the OP and makes stupid comment is a moron (like you)

Damn, dude. I'm embarrassed to even say what my best weapon is.

You and yasel70... You guys on xbox? I've got a bunch of stuff on a mule that I'll sell for cheap. GT Pa3ndr4g0n.
---
Not sure if this is your issue, but on accassion the Free Range event be slow to generate the legendary item.  The "normal" drops show up quickly on the body, and then the legendary appears in the list *after* a few additional seconds.  I'm guessing some of the loot is a fixed list, but the legendary is generated randomly.  With a lot of people at the event, you see the lag.  I have literally checked three of four times in a row and then suddenly the item appears in the list.  Just got my first staff plan last night after about twenty events...  Hang in there!
---
They were typing out their own money, money laundering
---
Hnnnnnng
---
That's eyerollingly incorrect.
---
Shark cards are literal in-game cash, used to buy every upgrade in the game. It's pay-to-play, because you can buy everything, new cars, bigger guns, missile silo, everything is accessible with that shark card money. Repair kits are, as of now, convenience items that nobody actually needs if they're smart enough to repair their damned weapons between fights.
---
Further, if we're talking eventual faction PVP, it still dosn't matter, because the kits are stupidly easy to farm. Grab your crew, launch a nuke, kill the queen, get a small pile of kits for everyone. They'll probably be doing that anyhow to gear up new members.
---
Feels like you had to go out of your way to have that many spelling mistakes in a single post.
---
Thank you for that!
---
Have you ever been to West Virginia or loved in any Southern States in the U.S.?
---
why are you even alive?  what value do you serve?  you are just another stupid mongoloid who comments on posts without even reading or understanding them
---
Could be why
---
I'm a big fan of base building too! That's why I love these open world survival games. I've probably spent just as much time building in them all as I have shooting things :-)
---
Big yikes dude, just looked through your comments. Get professional help cause you are the most toxic person I have seen on this reddit so far. Super big yikes
---
We have asked for this so many times. It so needs to happen and the only thing I can conclude is the team doesn't know how to make it work (like instancing)
---
I would swear that I've learned it. Could be wrong though. I usually find so much of it out in the wild Ive not looked to craft it for quite some time. Occasionally craft Bufftats and Psychobuff, but not Buffout itself. I'll have to look when I get online. Because now you have me curious lol.
---
Hey be glad it’s not a Ghoul Slayer Gamma Gun
---
If it exist that is
---
..its another bsg bug..
---
The point is, if they are willing to nerf things to sell a "solution", what more will they do? They have already gone back on the atom store items being purely cosmetic, they tried to pull a fast one with the canvas bag fiasco. What things have they done to benefit the player base?
---
Then be prepared to shit your pants when you aim that bad boy at the queen.
---
and can be purchased...
---
&gt; No telephones on the desk or fans on the bookshelf.
---
welp, that is like the only thing i was looking forward to. lol
---
I agree with all of the above.
---
I love stealth, i didn't know about those issues huh.
---
Totally agree about missile launcher rip :(.
---
That's how I felt about the ski sword for Flavor of Mayhem. Not a melee guy and obviously it wasn't level 50. It had to go.
---
my teammate lost all her X-01 power armor pieces recently, so it can happen to that one too at least
---
I can be on now, but the challenge ends in 28mins lol.
---
ERm... letting people buy handmade rifles or mods for guns  or that kind of stuff in general in the atom store would make bethesda have to outright admit they went back on their only cosmetics promise (now changed to no pay to win but still pay for convenience \*rolls eyes at Bethesda\*) promise as that would definitely be pay to win (you can pay to get the better weapons basically and better weapons would make it easier for you to win against another guy).
---
One time use recipe with insane ingredients (50 of all Fluxes) would make this maybe usable. 
---
And more wanted the effect (explosive) the more it costs.
---
my Luck base in 10 and i have maxed Four Leaf Clover and I’d say it activates minimum once per 10 shots.
---
sometimes it happens every-other shot up to 3 times, though.
---
OP I 100% agree with you and wanted similar out of survival mode, not some BS arcade deathmatch.
---
man i hope they fix this SOOn as bad word of mouth is gonna take over soon if people keep losing stuff like this
---
they need to lay off the ATOM store constant attention and fix these bugs first
---
Yeah I had sworn I purchased it from med wing in enclave bunker.

\^I know of this, but last I saw he was using the ground/terrain exploit by Seneca Rocks. You're basically below the ground, get people to travel/fast travel to you, and kill them.
---
That's awesome!  I just pictured the ending credits on World War Z - when the stadium is full of infected drawn by the sound system blasting noise, and they bomb it.  Typewriter in a dryer is good substitute!

Summoning a Cargobot with a US Government Supply Requisition Tape and taking a picture of it as it lowers to drop the crate also works.
---
Try loading it a couple more times.  If it still crashes, is there some equivalent of "Verify game integrity" on the PS4?
---
On PC, for me, crashes on initial load are *rare*.  I think I literally had my first one a couple days ago, and it gave me a scare because the reason I was reloading to begin with was because I crashed.  But the second time, it loaded fine, and I got the heck out of Charleston. 😂
---
Lol, so someone says " Keep this morally bankrupt Trash off the Beth forum "  - referring to me (when I am saying Bethesda should give a way for INNOCENT players to appeal and be un-suspended and you think I am TOXIC - you must be the stupidest person on the internet LOL)
---
I pity wastes of skin like you
---
this is a cool idea

I never have used any of mine. They are in the stash collecting dust not sure why i have them or what to do with them.

I got my 1st mothman last week. Get up to him and he disappears.

The ammunition depot has a landing pad
---
You are toxic cause you literally responded telling them to walk into traffic. Please seek professional help
---
I don't have a problem with the first part of your comment. But as for the making money, I agree, they have to make money. THey wouldn't be doing this if it weren't for that. But I want them to make it so they are incentivized to make the game better to make money, not have very easy ways to manipulate people to pay more by making the game worse. Pay for the convenience microtransactions do exactly that. Hell, the fact you can work for atoms actually makes it incentivized to them to make dailies a grindy chore (hey, guess what, daily's keep getting more ridiculous... I don't think that's just chance). I would have no problem if they at least had kept it to cosmetic only. Hell, I'd prefer if they either did you can only pay for the cosmetics in the atom store (no working for it) or even better, instead of having microtransactions you paid for DLC (for example the vending and backpack update would be a pay for DLC instead). I prefer DLC because they have to make the game fun in order to convince me I want more of it to play.

Luckily for me I dont care what you think or say as you are clearly a worthless moron.

Yea its weird. I literally never see anyone have hemlock holes, but the last 3 times i took the workshop over, twice it was contested after about 10 minutes. It really annoyed me.
---
Last time i managed to kill the guy like 3 times running, i then retook it and scrapped everything before leaving.
---
Yes they stack (Kinda) it's deminishing returns I understand. Which is why Sentinel, Assassins, Cavalier etc, are all in high demand.
---
Ie, 100 Dam base

1st would reduce it to 80
---
2nd would reduce that 80 to 64

Sorry you lost your weapons &gt;&lt;

The choice is yours. and it's literally as easy as changing an option in the settings menu.

wait until you realize you can see someone with stealth activates.... through 3 walls with approximately 60’ of distance! low PER builds can see u, too!
---
I believe lemonade and maybe sunshine oil or tea are the only non-alcoholic recipes, the alcoholic ones are fun though, if you do Biv's dailies :)
---
But it would be nice if they had a hardcore dedicated and separately balanced survival mode. instead of just the normal mode with pvp and no fast travel
---
You wouldn't even be affected then. Start over, sort use things you haven't found. It would be listed under known in plans as a duplicate.
---
Off hand I don't recall. More then 50 but less than 200. I've been here since launch and played when the servers were being stress tested, and last logged on yesterday.
---
Lucky! I only seem to get Anti-Armor ones.
---
WWR is only he most valuable if you use multiple types of weapons. I only use rifles, so I dont have any perks to save. But everyone has aid items and food and drink or else they die.
---
Thanks m8. Forgot to add it
---
Btw usually when I do it the sheepsquatch is a 1 star and sometimes there is 2. But the last I did was 1 sheepsquatch at 3 star even though the item it dropped was 1 star, we had all 3 brahmin alive for this one. Is that random on what star it will be?
---
Ive got a similar picture but it wasn't after a nuke launch. Creepy thing just started at me from behind a rock formation as I walked by.
---
I have been doing some testing with this in the Burrows. It seems the vanishing corpses are actually showing up where they originally spawned before dying, sometimes up to 100-150 yards (meters???) away. And even once I found the moved corpse it was MINUTES before the loot showed up. I have stopped going to the Burrows.

I kept hearing that early on and telling my friends that I thought it was important, and they were like naaaw it's just a frog or something. I felt like I was going mad everytime I heard it.

It didn't help that back then they would often fall through the world when they died so there would just be invisible beeping

It's great event overall. Quick, You always have to do something. Reward depends on your performance, cool boss in the end with chance of 3* legendary + a lot of new plans + free brahmin milk(and meat) i just removed my brahmin feeder with this event. also there is a lot of insects and yao guai wich means a lot of acid
---
Awesome photo!
---
Its pure randomness that he even spawned there. I watch a lot of nuke launches at Alpha as I usually launch from Alpha. My house is located just south of the launch silo (not the entry lake) so missiles frequently buzz my property. I think in the 2 months I've lived there i MAY have seen the Mothman once.
---
Not sure, tbh. Before switching to unyielding I didn't use any sneak perks because I had an Enforcer build. No need to sneak from things that are laying on the ground crippled.
---
The easiest one is there is an event called Collision Course at Morgantown Airport, it's super easy and when you finish a cargo bot comes down and drops a box on the landing spot, super easy to snap a pic then.
---
The amount you get for stars is completely random. While the rewards that spear on screen in white are determined by the amount alive if Brahmin
---
When they chose to use a way of making money that is based on manipulating your playerbase into paying to "fix the game", it's hard to believe they aren't doing subtle things to push you to pay more. Because that's exactly how companies make so much money with microtransactions that use items you can also work for in the game. Make it a good part of the game and then make it grindy and annoying to do so so they pay to just skip the bad part. IT's a very manipulative way of making money. Go watch Southpark's episode on it (a few years ago they did an excellent episode on how this way of making money is pretty much just abusing an addictive mindset to keep feeding the machine). They do a much better (and far more entertaining ;) ) explanation of this.
---
I have been seeing a lot of &lt; level 30 people walking about the map lately

Rip I’m on PS4
---
It wouldn’t be so bad to report if Bethesda didn’t ask for a video on PS4. The only way you can take videos is by social media accounts attached to the PS4. I don’t really want my social media linked to my PS4. You’d figure several pictures would be enough.
---
What "community" are you talking to?  This one?  From day-to-day, this community is rational and fine.
---
It gets screwed up when there's a controversy, but I don't consider that our "community."  Those people, the nomadic drama queens of Reddit, turn everything into a shitshow for a day or two with their angry soapbox screeds, and then disappear back into the ether just as quickly.
---
That’s nuts, I haven’t seen that happen.  I have a feeling the burrows are on separate server instances and that can absolutely cause what you’ve described.
---
I can do that with my bloodied power armor build. I run through west tek and use maybe 1 stimpack. At less than 20% health the name of the game is damage mitigation. Emergency protocols halves incoming damage before it hits you. Then use *4 lone wanderer and  *3 dodgy. It's almost ridiculous. I will go toe to toe with a lv 50 legendary mirelurk queen and not die. If i had scaly skin it would be more ridiculous.
---
Wow, didn't now that #rip
---
Have you ever been to West Virginia or lived in any Southern States in the U.S.?  It’s a different world.
---
"dude" is all you had to say to prove you are a moron
---
Primed gatling lasers have 1000 shots per core. Your gonna be doing 5 or 6 digit damage per violet flux, depending on your gun and your build.
---
Eh, I don’t use aid weight reduction because I barely carry aid. I always run a surplus, finding more than I use (water and meat are everywhere)
---
Screw the tax, they need proper cap sinks, like cobsumable items and novelty items people actually want to buy from NPCs that remove caps from the game.
---
They really need an experienced mmorpg economist to get in here and fix the mess that is the in game economy. There are way too many people running around with max caps and nothing to spend it on, and 10% vending tax won't fix that.
---
He knows what you've done. He's gonna haunt you.

First time I saw it was when I came out of one of the Free States Bunkers, left the door, saw him, spazzed out and cried a little cuz that reminded me of a nightmare I had when I was a kid. 
---
It was exactly the same too the glowing eyes in a darkened area and I was standing in a brightly lit room.
---
I had a full room of bugs who wouldn’t die so I feel like there is a bug in fort defiance
---
Please read this careful:  you are nothing, your thoughts are nothing, no one alive cares about anything you say
---
That's the exact same spot that I had my first ever encounter with the Mothman.
---
Ive had fun since Beta.  Sure there were some flaws, bugs and such but I was still having fun playing.
---
That's what you get for listening to the you tubers.
---
 I'm lucky as none of that YouTube crap interests me in this slightest.  I just don't understand how anybody can sit there and listen to another person talk about a video game. That  sounds boring as hell. To each their own though.
---
 Glad you finally decided to give it a chance though.
---
They are account wide when you buy them, and many of them are camp items
---
To be claar: I'm not a shill and upvoted this comment because it is against my view but not  unreasonable.
---
Also agree they would have benefited for a larger "soft-launch" before whipping up the marketing folks.  
---
Disagree that the content is mediocre but that is more subjective.  
---
What I think we do need to consider is that these types of larger, multi-platform, releases that push the envelopes of  safe technologies are going to be problematic.
---
Also, think that we need to consider the heavy cost of the server backed as there is no subscription service.  Only funded through a part of the original purchase and micro-transactions.  
---
But if we expect that a multi-million dollar software rollout across three platforms with new features are going to be completely clean day-one...this is not compatible with the new reality.  
---
We must change.
---
beautifully scary
---
What about the ambient back round music. Always gets me when theirs a string section bit and it sounds exactly like the start up music on the ps3?
---
No shit I left it on from adventure mode, it tells you there when you hit someone you're not doing damage but it doesnt tell you in survival so I thought it was glitching out.
---
An act of desperation in an attempt to escape. It writes itself har har
---
Please walk into traffic (as that is about all I think you are smart enough to accomplish)
---
This would be an ideal cap sink we desperately need. The weapons and armor uou want cant even be bought with caps anymore. So if i can find my bloody dream weapon at the slots? Yea id spend lol
---
I think it should be 3 stars with how much work it takes to keep 3 alive, also it would motivated players to help do the event too, since I had a guy come see that I was the only one and leave.
---
Just wait till you launch a nuke on the queen break a weapon or 2 spend thousands of rounds only to have her glitch through the ground or fly outside the map...
---
That summarises it quite eloquently, yes, thank you :)
---
Everyone is entitled to their own value judgement but that is less than a dollar per hour.  
---
To me that is good value.
---
so bethesda makes inflation much worse by pooling vendor caps to 1400 every day, then does this to counter it?
---
anyone find that strange?
---
/u/Valseek Will the Heavy barrel for the automatic grenade launcher be fixed as well? since the beta it does not increase damage like it states and as of right now, it is just a heavier long barrel.
---
I think only limited time plans such as the faschnat (think I butchered that) plans should be account wide.
---
God damn brilliant. The first suggestion in this sub that is actually worth the post.
---
Remember “bulk” from NV? 
---
I member. 
---
If I can craft in certain “bulk” quantities, let me BUY in those quantities. And let me sell my fucking missiles.
---
Maybe a hidden glowing one healing the ghouls and other glowing animals?
---
Does anyone know what that weird tribal sounding flute is in cranberry bog? It kinda reminds me of the forest temple in zelda oot
---
Day one stuff. I mean why.....
---
Throwing something like just a pair of overalls and a t-shirt in IS West Virginia.  It gets muggy in the summer but the winters aren’t too nasty compared to say New York or Boston.  If we’re looking at the country through the eyes of 50’s Americana, then the seclusion would make the adherence to “modern norms” less-so.
---
I didn’t even think of that you could put payouts to be either caps or some random legendary with the currency being chips you traded in only there.
---
Yes Free Range is fun but an absolute nightmare when running solo, trying to protect 3 cows with a poor excuse of a riflemen build is a recipe for failure and Im lvl 200 so good event just needs to be rebalanced so players running solo can do it.
---
\*\*Datamined spolier below\*\*

&gt;!Yet might not be a problem coming up since dataminers found some stuff to ask if we want to run events before we join servers so I might be able to farm events now with other people :).!&lt;

Is that why I keep encountering 'inactive' ghouls just standing there doing nothing?
---
They are not A-Posing or T-Posing, they are in the pose they have when you 'naturally' encounter them roaming around but frozen in place.
---
Might have to reinstall. They've thrown a bunch of updates at us and they might not all be playing together very well.
---
Can you pass this along u/ladydevann ? Like make it first where you'll be able to buy a variety of colors (black, white, red, etc) for cheap then implent a color wheel further on.
---
Compensation? For what?
---
???? what are you on about? they tied all the caps together
---
I think you have a better point than those that said "he lied!". But from what I saw (but I paid close attention to the game cause I was really excited for it), Sean pretty much gave me a good definition of what the game would be (I was very confused by so many people asking, "What do you do?"). But, the fact you had so many people confused by what you did would point that apparently he wasn't very good at getting his point across and yes, people will start making their own ideas. But, I don't think I made my own ideas as the game was what I expected save needing better balance and some minor stuff not being what he said like planets rotating (except I didn't expect to be able to go into the space stations, that was a very pleasant surprise. I could have sworn he said you just would go up to the station and trade).
---
Sadly the procedural generation was exactly what people expected who were warning the generation wouldn't be all that, animals are very similar to each other... And so far I haven't really seen that change :(.
---
Hey man, I’m online again if you still want to make that trade?
---
So I agree with this and am concerned their funding approach is compromised.  
---
It seems transparent that they originally planned to sell the perk cards and other things and took a last minute detour.  
---
I'd love for them to adopt a subscription model (hey WoW is still trucking) to maintain the back end as well as continually refine the program.  But I'm not sure that is compatible with the market.
---
Yes to this! I don't want to double grind for everything and would make it easier to play a new character.
---
I can’t confirm or deny this. It seems there’s definitely a cool down or else the quest would pop every time someone traveled to one of the locations. I never have the patience to test how long before it starts because it’s so easy to find another event within 1-3 server hops at the same location. That only takes about 5-10 minutes and sometimes the event is already underway at a different location (but mostly just at Fred’s bbq shack). 
---
I’ve been farming it every time I play and have gotten through the event so many times, but am still missing some plans. Some seem way more rare than others, and one is flat out incorrectly named (got plans for electrified sheepsquatch staff but the mod only applies to the club). I’m still hunting the correct electrified staff plans and am curious if there’s a poisoned club. Just learned yesterday there are plans for just a barbed staff (I knew about burning and burning barbed, but not just barbed). Just a general lack of info on the rewards in the community it seems.
---
If it's albino or part of a group (even if the rest are dead for some reason) it won't work.
---
Uh, for using their photo?
---
Maybe take the perk cards off and put them back on? I haven't had an issue - tamed a lil snally just last night.
---
Yea..integrate it with the legendary scrip. Id be so down for this
---
Definitely! :-)
---
I have only been waiting for player vending. Now watch the caps roll in.
---
.... for an hour
---
The only guaranteed 3* legendary bosses are SWQ and imposter, and they require MUCH more work
---
Absolutely. I run an Anti-Armor LMG and it *shreds* **everything**. Only downside is the bastard chews up .308 about as fast as I can make it sometimes. But that's why we carry 2-3 heavy weapons. Heh.
---
I'm doing the same. Red heads unite!
---
I’ve definitely seen that as well!
---
They don’t have to. Op gave consent for them to use photo.
---
No please, no more bullshit defense missions. The cows get pretty much one-shotted by the Sheepsquatches, and almost no one shows up anyway.
---
Yeah, true. As is, tho, the JB is lame.
---
Only if it has primm slim telling me all about Vicky and vale
---
my tip is NEVER hug walls while in chameleon. your “shimmering like water” body will clip with the wall... you kind of look like Han Solo in carbonite with the wall (like, 50% protruding).
---
on the roof of West Tek there are walls in some areas and a friend and i were able to see each other at equal distances. my PER is 15, his is 8. we could also see each other weapons drawn (red dot on HUD) at the same rate. but when i moved in chameleon he couldn’t “see” me until i stopped again but i could see his dot move when he moved. so basically lower PER seems to enjoy all the stealth detection that high PER can see on PER only really affects rifle dmg.
---
We don't need to change.
---
They need to change how they release content to manage expectations.
---
When they released the burrows people expected a "subterranean challenge for 2+ level 50+ characters" and set their expectations accordingly. What they released was a very nice new area that offered no challenge to most level 50+ characters even when solo.
---
The bar wasn't set by the community, it was set by bethesda. The content released was mediocre compared to the hype they sold.
---
When they released repair kits they broke Pete Hines words when he told us the Atomic shop would be cosmetic only. Many of us only bought into the game because of that and it is a bitter pill to swallow to stick around after they broke their word.
---
They set the bar because of what they said.
---
The community is not the problem here.
---
 Bethesda needs to tighten up their language when dealing with releases if they want people to not be upset.
---
In quite frankly the community has changed after repair kits, as many of the faces I am used to seeing daily have stopped logging in altogether, so maybe you are going to get your wish after all OP as dissenting voices choose to move on to greener pastures.
---
I’m honestly not mad the queens loot pool.
---
I mean, sorry you struggle to launch a nuke and kill the queen, but many teams out there are claim they can kill a queen in under 5 minutes - I’ve seen it randomly before too - a team of 4-5 200+ level guys demolishing  a queen in like 5 min. 
---
For endgame players, farming the queen is one of the few options. From collecting a key card to the end of scorched earth takes maybe an hour Solo, and quicker for me if I’m ina group. If I was guaranteed a 3* every time, shoot, I’d have 50 3* weapons in like a week or two, and eventually myself and other endgame players would simply be giving out OP weapons, devaluing them significantly.
---
&gt; curious if there’s a poisoned club
---
I got 3-4 poisoned clubs in a row
---
I'm on PC and after I recently returned from an extended trip and had to reinstal Windows 10 and FO76, Windows 10 entered repair loop, using the previous INI files and settings the game runs like a stuttering drunk at all times, cannot seem to fix it.
---
There have been a few updates since I previously played so something is very different now. Will keep messing with INI files and settings but now starting to give up hope I'll be able to get the game running like it did a couple of months ago :(
---
Heres a better way to make people lose caps, make items from vendors cheaper! I've never found myself buying anything from vendor besides plans and the occasional buyback of my legendary weapon and if I saw it as a viable option to spend caps at local vendor for items like ammo I would be no where close to he limit.
---
It's not honestly. I have to admit I'm part of the problem here, I think teh subscription model does usaully end up with a better game (because they ahve to convince you it's worth paying to keep playing). But I just can't justify more subscription fees on top of my other monthly bills. It's why I never tried MMOs' when I was younger cause I knew it could be soemthing I could get addicted to and I didn't want a monthly fee with it (everquest sounded really intriguing except for that). And why I didn't try ESO until they stopped the sub fee (though I supported them vocally for it but that doesn't matter to them).

It's why I prefer a DLC approach that still encourages them to make the game fun enough to make me pay more but doesn't make me pay a fee over and over and over again just to play. Or even Elite Dangerous's approach, you want customizations, pay (no working for it in the game. The only gripe I have is that they should at least offer a few basic customizations for free. They over \*nothing\* cosmetic for free).

Killed a 3* ghoul in white springs yesterday, before I could loot game froze and had to reboot :(

Ultracite ammo does not have separate plans. It is unlocked only when a prime receiver plan that uses that ammo is unlocked. There are two prime receivers for the handmade. One for automatic and a separate for semiauto. You probably learned the version you’re not interested in/not used for your build and that’s what unlocked ultracite 5.56 for you.
---
AND this doesn’t even take into account i’m wearing armor pieces and eating food to get my total PER at 26!
---
Oh. I didn't even know this was a thing. Thanks for the tip :)
---
Why, is PS4 incompatible with the game?
---
Hi! We're planning to address this issue in Patch 9 next week.
---
No I have a ps4 pro but base ps4 might have trouble running a game so large
---
Did you return to FO76 yet? 😳
---
So create a budgeted project that encompasses multiple, time-released sections and tell me how well it works. Even if you create a fully functional game, do you expect little blowback from the users? Instead of figuring out solutions to improve the game and implement new changes, scrapping the whole project and starting over is not viable. We don't buy a new car when we need an oil change. They created a support team who holds their tounges among the LEGIONS of negative posts. They do hotfixes and patches and put player-sourced ideas into this game. They changed how the survival mode functions based on feedback from players. They give this all to us, FOR FREE, while consistently following deadlines to assure that we have something to complain about.
---
Now that’s a good dog
---
That's real life mate, you need to lay off the strong drink ;)
---
Roll Tide
---
No Vim or craftable Nuka Colas yet--aside from Dark which is alcoholic, but definitely the best cola. Lemonade would be a good option, but you'll need a lot of acid to make it. Great drink though, despite the eh benefits it's non-perishable.
---
That is my theory. But it is such a large map and so many spawns that doing a controlled test is near impossible, even if you had a server to yourself. Too many vars.
---
Ok IC
---
I’ve gotten a couple of other good drops there too. Granted I’ve farmed there a ton but it’s worth it long term if you want amazing weapons. Hopefully they make the queen and sheepsquatch better options. They should each guarantee 2 3* max level legendaries at least.
---
Reminded me of a podcast from radiolab.
---
Some bird developed solid wing bones to make a weird noise for mating. Sounds like an industrial car backing up.

Firstly, I don't buy or trade my earned Atoms for the kits offered in the AS.  I do use the improved repair kits I get from the Queen fight to repair my Grog Axes above 100% simply because you can't on the bench.  I repair all my other equipment at their respective benches as normal. Secondly, you are respectfully entitled to your opinion on this controversial issue of course, but offering up only hypothetical, "Imagine if" scenarios as proof these kits are somehow giving any real competitive or tactical advantage to anyone isn't proof they actually are. Is "Faction Warfare" even a thing?  I'm certainly unaware of any "faction warfare" that is currently going on in the game outside of normal PVP encounters.  So I can't see how it can "get bigger".  I suppose there are a few teams that get together and duke it out from time to time. Certainly Hunter vs Hunted doesn't qualify. Sounds to me like you are assigning blame to repair kits for losing a hypothetical battle that could happen if Bethesda created a Faction vs Faction mode with an arena or map designed specifically for that sort of game play.  Sounds fun actually, but it doesn't really exist so I really can't be convinced the repair kits are causing an unbalanced advantage in the game we have based on that.
---
Let's be honest: It's weird, it's slow, and it has very little end game. By rights, it should be a bad game, but it's not. It's actually quite good for what it is. I've hit 557 hours, and finally have nothing to do in the game except for challenges and alts, at least until the next game content comes out.
---
I paid the launch price ($60 USD). I've gotten 557 hours of fun for about $0.10 per hour. That's a fucking steal.
---
You mean going “Ash Williams” on stuff.. Bruce is the actor whereas Ash is the character you are referring to   😉
---
Flatwoods monster.
---
We absolutely need the ability to display our character name as Roleplayers. It causes a ton of problems when hopping between characters, who are supposed to have totally different personalities and lives when everyone just knows us as the account name.
---
This can go both ways. There are people who want to start completely fresh and those who want to start over but keep all there plans.
---
Making people relearn all the plans is also another way to prolong the game.
---
I reinstalled today and using all new INI files or my back ups the game runs like a slug.
---
It can be done. Just keep in mind that you won't be one-shotting targets like some of the more common builds can do.
---
No worries. The game changes once you beat all of the main and side quests. You're basically on the prowl for legendaries and the best weapons and armor out there. Tweaking your character perks, leveling up, building and rebuilding your CAMP.
---
Not to be a pedant, but it's 80% more.
---
Toxic water would make more sense.
---
Fair point.
---
Ah, I have my house just across the lake from Alpha. Mothman is a relatively common spawn from that cliff for a cryptid, encountered him a few times.
---
are taxes starting to make sense now too?
---
On the top floor of fort defiance there was a glowing rad roach. Invincible.
---
Learned this the hard way last night. :(
---
But also helped me claim a workshop where I just couldn't find the workbench at all, haha.
---
It is, and just like real life I don't understand how people don't get this
---
Same problem with the mole rat and a blood bug.. 
---
Ofcourse the bug was a three star legendary....needless to say I really tried to kill that sucker for awhile
---
That didn't work for me but glad to know it worked for someone :)
---
This is the one I use.
---
if there is any chance you could please help us now, I know its been a while but I later found out after posting this that my friend had to go somewhere
---
Alas this caused her to fall to her death.... :'(
---
I know this is a frustrating issue, but wanted to let you know that we're currently planning to address it in Patch 9 so that the Cap cost displayed when moving your C.A.M.P. matches the actual cost.
---
I gave up on whitesprings months ago, best drop I ever got was a quad handmade with bonus aiming damage. I farm events and specific locations and random spawns. 
---
Had much better luck doing that. Latest explody gun was a quad 44, came from AWOL Armaments a couple weels ago.
---
except taxes actually pay for stuff like infrastructure. beth can't reinvest the lost caps into anything
---
the problem is more than from my perspective the game acts like my friends acount doesn' t exist and the other way around. nothing gets through to one another
---
This would be a way more fun and consensual way to take caps from us. I would love to see it.
---
I agree with you that the canvas bag and the nuka rum were terrible marketing decisions. I never paid for anything other than the flat game. Maybe we could start trend of committing all of our reddit complaints to paper and filling the bag to them. Then at the end of the day we could put all of the trash at the curb and go on with our day.
---
Sounds reasonable.
---
I have a feeling that will be the most interesting thing thing I learn today
---
I haven't really been getting any freezes for the past couple months. I played for probably like 12 hours last week and only had one crash on a standard Xbox. They've definitely improved the game's stability since launch: I would crash like once every 2 hours or so then.
---
I don't get it either. I'm hoping there's going to be some kind if explanation from a quest where we unlock it or something.
---
Same, its a great idea. I like it more than trading with a mouth breathing mole miner.
---
I use them to support my overhanging roofs. I make them sink into the ground so it looks like its actually supporting the roofing.
---
I can confirm on XBONE. Camden Park vendor has them. Took me a couple hours of server hopping to find them. I was able to install no problem. I bought 2 piercing mods just in case I find another legendary pole hook. I have a Vampire level 50. Totally worth the search.
---
Yep. Well aware of this.
---
Interesting. Thank you for letting us know. Would this explain why I lost 400caps, and minutes after it only cost 25caps? I get the visual bug, it’s just a bit confusing is all.
---
I'm a raider that's gone good. My character is a mute and makes sounds instead of talking. still a raider but I help out others more than I harm them.
---
The Institute? Oh no...
---
Weapons are debatable because of the PvP damage normalization, but overall I'd go with something that's quicker than a Dragon. Personally I used a level 5 Assassin's 10mm auto pistol as my go to to spam VATS crit headshots on my Survival mode alt basically until level 50 at which point I bought a max level Anti-Armor assault rifle  on r/market76. I can kill just about anyone if I spot them before they spot me, especially if they aren't stealthed (VATS is like instant death). Exploding and/or Bloodied weapons are really popular but I've never been interested in either so I don't really have much to add about those other than holy shit does a silenced Exploding weapon make the most obnoxious noise in the game.
---
Perks and legendary effects which reduce damage by a percentage are required to last 3 seconds instead of 1 second and overall much more effective than DR. I always have at a minimum for PvP the perks (all max rank) Blocker (45% less melee damage), Fireproof (45% less damage from explosions and flame attacks), and Lone Wanderer (20% less damage). 
---
Two other perks of note are Dodgy and Serendipity. Dodgy at max rank reduces 30% of all damage at the cost of 30 action points per hit, but you have to keep in mind you'll need a very high Agility for this to be effective and that might also gimp you if you are reliant on VATS. Serendipity at max rank gives you a 45% chance to avoid all damage when under 30% health, and is good all around but damn near required if you're running a Bloodied weapon (more damage lower your health is) and/or Unyielding armor (up to +3 for all special except Endurance the lower your health is).
---
In addition to the above mentioned perks, legendary armor can come with the damage % reducing effects including Assassin's (8% less damage from other players), Sentinel's (15% less damage while standing, note that jumping in one place counts as standing for this effect), and Cavalier's (15% less damage while sprinting). You can get both the Assassin's effect and either Sentinel's or Cavalier's on a single piece of armor and having a full set of these types of pieces can drastically increase your suitability.
---
It is also important to note that VATS critical hits completely ignore damage % reducing effects and serve as a counter to the above perks/legendary effects. In addition, staggering someone wearing Sentinel/Cavalier armor will temporarily disable JUST (I'm pretty sure at least but someone correct me if I'm wrong here) the Sentinel/Cavalier damage % reducing effects and give you an opening to do more damage.
---
Yeah the initial knee-jerk is over I think, finally.
---
Sadly none of the group I started playing with are returning but I am glad to see the game get some new blood.
---
That would be cool if Beth used the caps to fix and make the towns look better
---
Yeah I reserve the LMG for PVP only because it eats ammo so fast.  And I use Ultracite ammo because you can make batches of 86 rounds with the Ultacite (4 times more than the regular ammo).
---
no
---
From the posts in the Reddit bazzar it looks like the loot is pretty good on ps4. I see better stuff being traded on ps4 than xbox.
---
Maybe Xbox players are just hanging onto their stuff more.

You're more than welcome to jump in with me.

There needs to be a way to remove caps from circulation to increase its value, it’s basic macroeconomics
---
And the family pet
---
Only using "Animal Friend" ... don't even have Wasteland Whisperer -- never used it.   
---
Been swapping out perk cards all the time while I play.  It's just not working anymore for me for the past few weeks.
---
Sorry please try again is all i got.
---
TL/DR: Make the game easier
---
Have you ever smelled moth balls? 
---
How did you get your nose in between those little legs?
---
Before the bombs dropped whitespring completely replaced the staff with bots. Angry staff in situations like this would almost certainly have sabotaged a lot of equipment on their way out for payback. After the bombs dropped, no one was left to come fix the washers and dryers. 
---
(This is just my most realistic thoughts.)
---
Yea I switched my one endurance point from radicool to lv 1 fireproof and it actually made a huge difference. Tried firing at my feet and I survived (just). Really like the build I'm running, so not gonna re spec. Jumping before I fire is second nature to me now anyways ha! As long as it's not guaranteed instant death anymore im happy! Thanks for the advice!
---
Damn you got downvoted to hell in less than an hour. Beth should do a weekly photo contest for some atoms or something.
---
It is just one piece of the puzzle that would be absolutely fine if they slow the rate of consumption. Flamers are still not going to be used, which is a shame because it is obvious they wanted flamers to be the main healer weapon in the game.
---
Hahahahaha god damn mouth breathers.
---
&gt;would make it easier
---
yea this is a "make the game easier" request
---
Let's not do that
---
It's absurd and unnecessary. There are people who have mules full of caps, guess this is for them. The rest of us will just charge more than needed. Personally I find fast traveling to be enough of a cap sink.
---
I recognize that this is really important, and that it needed to be done, but damn am I sad that my favorite gun is going away. :(
---
Hehe
---
50 shade of fallout
---
We're not trolls, we just don't want the game to be easier than it already is
---
The kid is not my kid. but I get you on the whole "getting used to noise" thing. I don't think that they would listen to that kind of reasoning. I still think that a keyboard chat shouldn't be too hard and there shouldn't be any major reason for it being too problematic. But you know I just logged in and remembered that they game really isn't social anyways at least the way it is now, everyone is doing their own thing. But then again maybe that is because there is no keyboard chat because what I do know is that the only way to communicate is the mic and no one uses it. Is the game less social because people don't use a mic or do people not use a mic because they don't want to play socially and instead want to play on their own. I don't know, but a chat would be nice at least for trading.
---
It’s not a tax per se but a cap sink to combat inflation.  Otherwise caps would enter the economy and never leave so you have outrageous prices because of legendary drop rates. It’s a way to reduce saturation and increase the value of a cap. The more of something there is and the more that people have of it the less it is worth.
---
It still needs more improvement to make the medic role more viable. We should be seeing way more holy trinity style teams but the game doesn't really encourage it right now and the fuel consumption rate is one of the worst offenders.
---
Here is how it helps - numbers are made up for illustrative purposes:
---
Right now, the average player earns, say, 1000 caps each day, and spends 800. They would spend more, but they don't have a lot to buy, and fast travel only costs so much.
---
This means every day, players get richer. That means every day, money means less and less to them. So when they find an item they want, they are willing to pay huge amounts of caps (25k easily) for it, and are less willing to sell their own good items, because they don't want caps anyway. 
---
By taxing trades, caps are removed from the economy, which stops hyper inflation. It means caps will still have value. 
---
Also, lastly, everyone who had complained about this has made the same mistake you made. If the tax is 10%, in order to receive the same amount you would without tax, you don't bump prices by 10%, you bump them by ~11% .
---
This is because 0.90*110% would only get you 99% of what you started wanting. 0.90*111% gets you 100%. 
---
Bethesda doesn't care if you charge lots for items. They just want to remove caps from the economy, and I support this. Otherwise everyone will quickly have max caps, and they won't mean anything.
---
With some sock
---
I don't know what to tell ya then D: I would try submitting a ticket.
---
Hot florescent pink
---
Are they going to increase the stupid 25,000 Cap limit?  This is a very communist type restriction
---
Pc? I run an xbox but I remember seeing that pc players often use extra mods that is console users never have to worry about. Patch comes out, picks a fight with your mod programs... Could that be the problem?
---
I've yet to find a plan for an Ultracite LMG Receiver. :C
---
&gt; But I am saying that these synergies that you are speaking of far overshadow the lesser performing single star prefixes.
---
There is only one set of legendary mods with synergy and that is TSE. So again, you're wrong. The demand for one star weapons isn't low, it's that the supply is tremendous. On average everyone gets like 15-25 1 stars per 2 or 3 star item, then the 2/3 star has to  roll well to be of any use. For instance, I have a would be badass 3 star combat rifle, the 2nd and 3rd star are explosive/15% crit meter but the primary affix is berserkers and that's pure garbage.
---
So when I say they're not trash I'm also comparing them to god tier gear, god tier guns get like 25% more dps than the best 1 stars and weapons get 42 ish % more... For guns that's not particularly impressive or relevant. For melee that can be a huge deal, but a melee build doesn't need it to be at monster levels of damage anyway.
---
I dunno what is going on with your build/system but sneak works great for me using my suppressed Fixer and chameleon gear I have had enemies run right past me from behind looking for me. Capped three in the back of the head right after they did it the other day.
---
I think the opposite will happen. Now you can easily sell items you'd usually just dump on the floor. Stuff like legendary weapons, junk etc. That 10% won't have much of an impact
---
I compare gaming studios to sports ball teams. If the current coach is shit, and the current players are shit... it doesn't matter what they were like in their heydays.
---
Yeah, after what I commented.
---
Yeah the Beach Boys are kind of well known on the LFG on Xbox. This is why I only trade at the overseer's camp and my camp is well out of the way.
---
Yeah. It's just a little said when the team in question used to be Titans of the industry.
---
I just had an albino deathclaw do a pirouette and vanish after I shot it to death. It was funny until I realized I just wasted most of my ammo.
---
If the problem is there’s too much caps floating around, then perhaps there needs to some more stuff worth buying.  I know what will happen though, the prices will rise for the basic stuff.
---
Meanwhile in the weekly dev meeting....
---
So there’s some areas on the map which can hurt the players because the air is bad?
---
How bout we create air containers that can carried around which can’t be recharged and can only be bought by caps?
---
Good idea, let’s put it in.
---
******
---
&gt;I mean, that goes to show how often I've tried to use this evil pay-to-win game-breaking item on-the-fly, right? 
---
I have not paid one penny for them and I have six of them currently.   You can get them from in game events.  The queen seems to drop the regularly.  So it's not simply a pay to win mechanic.
---
PVPers know all the tricks to engage someone... PVEers are always behind.
---
Most people probably won't tell you how they did it, but you can always ask the guy killing you.
---
I'd also say make the survival servers a persistent choice which you can't move characters off of or on to, and workshops would be held by players/groups after they log off.  This would allow for the more "faction" focused PvP they initially talked about and would encourage more interaction both peaceful and violent, as reputations form.  Maybe up the server player limit for Survival up to 50 since the map is pretty big and would increase the chance of pitched 4v4 squad battles
---
Redrum
---
This, though I went into more detail below.
---
There are unlimited caps in this game and they are pretty easy to come by. This means they lose value because people want more caps for the same items as caps become more abundant. Things like bidding wars and whatnot really drive the price of items up because one person can afford to spend 125k on that full set of god-tier items. 
---
Now if caps were deleted from the game whenever a trade happened, their value may start to rise due to the increased scarcity. Now this won't take affect immediately, but after a while when the player base has lost quite a few caps you'll notice people less willing to spend as many caps as before.
---
Should contact a mod with all the proof.
---
It’s really not hard to do with melee I have a 1⭐️ aa death claw gauntlet and have all the unarmed perks and I 1-3 hit everything depending on the level lol
---
This also helps reduce damage from scorchbeast screams and other explosive weapons.  Although in Survival it may be different ( if you're playing it ).
---
That's pretty ominous. I love it.
---
Wait till they nerf nukes in a few weeks, or nerf the drop rates.
---
This is not the place to report some one and you can get banned for putting the players name here but thats unlikely the thread will probably just be deleted.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Where does it come out of the ground from?
---
Ah, yes, didn't think of that. Thank you
---
I would also love to see persistence and players bound to servers but I'm not sure how they would manage this one without allowing players to join servers via a server browser. This is probably something that will come when they allow for us to rent servers.
---
You are right. My brain collapsed there.
---
They can be saved local and moved via flash drive. It's a pain in the ass though.
---
Second that. It might violate terms of use of the game, depending upon the facts and some of the context.
---
This a wildly stupid move for Bethesda. If it was FO4 where we had settlements to raise and people to care for, I could see it; with 76, it’s a different story. We don’t have settlements or bustling, growing cities rising up from the ash of nuclear apocalypse. We don’t have human NPCs to care and provide for. The ruins of West Virginia are quite literally that: ruins. The only humans are the characters of live people, so if they’re referring to train station vendors as “giving back to the economy” they are entirely off-base. They’re overlooking the literal reason for player vending itself: the fact that we have built our own economy off of consistent prices and honest, fair deals — for the most part, anyhow. Putting a fee for the non-existent economy is damn near a slap in the face. 
---
So you’re right: people will overprice to cover the cost of the fee. Which, in essence, makes the fee incredibly pointless.
---
Its working for me and im on pc what platform are you?
---
Still don't know, that's why I tried fast travelling outside to see where it flew from but missed it cause I got distracted by Mothman.
---
Easiest way to get legendaries is to farm whitesprings when it's nuked also farm other valuable stuff, like most ammo, acid, steel, screws, adhesives etc. Sell this stuff online in the fo76 trading subreddit. Won't take long and with 15k you can buy some decent weapons.
---
I asked no reply. They where mad at us because we didn't feel like letting the timer run on one violent night so they could farm ghouls.  I had already fast traveled by the time they killed my friend so I didn't see what happened
---
Aw thanks it got me killed but I like it too lol.
---
Hi! We recently shared a few details on buffs coming to Flamer Fuel Cryo Cells: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview
---
Here's the text in case you can't view the link at work/school (not that I'm encouraging browsing Reddit at work or school, but you know...)
---
* Flamer Fuel created via crafting increased from 5 to 20.
---
* Cryo Cells created via crafting increased from 15 to 25.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Nice. I really enjoyed reading this.
---
It's a niche role and First Aid, Field Surgeon, and Team Medic is all you need. Friendly Fire is just a situational bit of support. This isn't an actual MMO and frankly I hope they're not going for that. I don't want the vault to be so bullet spongy we all have to sit around mobs and whack them for five minutes until they're dead, heal up, move on to the next.
---
Yeah, i wanted to, but it was a lot to type on a phone.  I think a lot of people incorrectly seperate simulation from real life.  As a part of human nature, any time there is an opportunity in game for player to player trade.  Rules of economics applies. Unless of course the game devoloper creates rules that control that.
---
I spent like an hour looking for this thing and I still haven’t found it yet. I did find the tower thing that’s around there and the raider bar place but where else should I be looking. Then again I could have gone right past it
---
Report it to mods, and if the messages were on a console/PC, report their ID to the service.
---
Yes, each star corresponds to a legendary effect. So a 1 Star legendary weapon has one legendary effect (Two-shot, Bloodied, etc) Finding a 3 star legendary is what you want to go for. There are VERY few mods that you can add to weapons that will increase their stars.
---
That being said, my non-vats shotgun build is deader than Lincoln come patch 9.
---
Just messaged one of the mods. Was very tempting to post screenshots of the messages, but I assume that would be considered "witch hunting" if I straight up shared their reddit name in this post
---
Anthem literally still has all those things except dupers AND no content lol
---
How can that submachine gun be bad? (Serious question.)
---
Can they be used on armor. I find ballistic fibre a pain to get.
---
You'll know next week when we know.
---
See, I didn’t even know they existed. Wish there was an updated compiled list
---
Good point.
---
Kinda of hate grinding double though, its like why would I want to farm 18 x 25k caps for all the mutation recipes again on a 2nd character?
---
It was all here on reddit, unfortunately. Just messaged one of the mods
---
Pre nerf, this was TSE weapons in a nutshell with no perk cards.  Now it obviously takes a lot more prep to get to this level.  With the correct perk cards, there's way more efficient weapons that an explosive shotgun.  In fact, majority of shots fire at me are from explosive Handmades or 50 Cal.  I feel like the minority running a shotgun nowadays.
---
I won't be on until after work
---
I'm surprised that they didn't do at least one photo contest when they added in the handheld camera
---
It is why WoW created a new gold sink (riding skill or similar) every expansion, and why Diablo 2 economy quickly became based on rare, small, items (SoJ).
---
Also why the economy in path of exile is kind of neat.
---
Players generate caps
---
Players spend caps at vendors
---
Players lose caps on death
---
Vendors get a significant %reduction recoup to cap availability when vending.
---
Introducing 2 new systems into the mix without some type of sink or exchange-loss-cost could encourage undesirable behavior.
---
Buying and reselling in this model costs me 10%, sounds like small margins in this context.
---
I think we would see quite a few more players seeking out one stars in the market if your assertions here were true. But not ever have I heard of people seeking out one stars aside to experiment with a prefix. Most of them in my experience end up as vendor trash, and absolutely will be exchanged for script after Tuesdays.
---
Hello! Thanks for the reports on this, we're planning to address the Class Freak and Grounded Mutation interaction in Patch 9.
---
Me too!  Middle aged and going bald.  LOL
---
Does it matter what your luck is at? Is it like that for LOTD(Luck of the Draw) and LB(Lucky Break)?
---
Was this on PS4? Ask as I was in a nuke zone around then 🤔🎮
---
So imposter sheepsquatch shows we can have mmorpg style bosses without going full on bullet sponge.
---
And the SBQ is absolutely a bullet sponge already soo...
---
Worth lol I wanna get some yao guai pics because I love them but it's just about guaranteed to get me killed lol
---
I'm playing this game in Survival for PVP and would not support anything that makes **finding a fight** more difficult. I also have zero problem with fighting people equipped with OP legendary weapons and armor. At level 35 with a 1\* Executioner's Handmade (found in survival) I was killing people. The only thing that really bothers me is stealth boys but the rest all have counters.
---
I have a crafting character and a rifle character. My friends found enough extras for both of them before I found. I'd sell you my extra but I'm on PS4. Good luck friend. RNGsus is not a merciful god.
---
Thanks :)
---
No problem. I hope they can help you out because that's pretty scummy behaviour :/
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the same person was saying similar things to me. He deleted his account a few minutes ago.
---
Deleted his whole account? Damn, might not be a point then
---
the higher the Luck the better. i dont use those 2 perks but as Luck is increased then so should their rates of activation.
---
This is excellent information and I completely agree...
---
It really is. Apparently that guy deleted his account, though. Not surprising
---
They will basicly tell you to block them. I've had this problem before.
---
And yea it's a good idea to not do any of that fancy witch hunting.
---
For cheap...for a mod nobody can get their hands on. Right.
---
We’ve only had the camera for a week, could still happen done the road.
---
My mistake, he deleted the thread, not his account. Hopefully he gets banned from here .

"When a human eats enough of a certain type of dumpster trash, particularly behind fast-food shops and quick-marts, they become infested with a brain parasite that takes over their mind and forces the host to become an online marketing expert.
---
Then, they convince the leaders at successful companies to do such things as, try to force game purchasers to buy in-game things they don't need, by absolutely ruining an essential game mechanic, in a successful game franchise, making something so PAINFULLY worse than it has ever been, in the franchise history, that the gamer loses love for the brand and the franchise. They do this, rather than the alternative of offering products and features which are desired by game purchases and would be paid for. Which is an entirely different thing from ruining a necessary game mechanic and potentially a successful game, by trying to force purchases of a poorly placed offering BECAUSE YOU HATE HUMAN GAMERS.
---
Eventually, sometimes, these human parasites are caught by leaders at these successful companies, and their policies and suggestions are removed from the games. Sometimes, however, the franchise and the associated brand loyalty is damaged irreparably."

---
So you think I should have to grind 450,000 caps per new character to learn all the serum recipes again? I rather shot myself in the foot then grind that much. Wouldn't mind if they dropped from things but they don't.
---
Definitely gonna block him, just don't want him doing this shit to anyone else
---
This is way better than my synopsis.  I figured, the Great War began in 2077.  Vault 76 opened twenty years later.  Since life in the post-war world would have likely been pretty short, the young people would have been illiterate.  They would have been angry at the clickety-clack word machine and might have wanted to imprison it in laundry jail.  And there you have it...
---
"So you’re right: people will overprice to cover the cost of the fee. Which, in essence, makes the fee incredibly pointless." Caps are still taken out of the game :D Even more so if you raise prices. You really should think before posting :D
---
But if you let another player take it over you're just leaving yourself open to pvp which goes against the whole point.
---
Keep in mind, a lot of creatures spawn underground, things like mole rats, mirelurks, ghouls, so can be impossible to find because they return to the earth.
---
I don't know what you want me to say. Those are arguably the hardest bosses in the game, SBQ being the "final boss" of the game. I would expect them to be tough and have a lot of health. That doesn't mean this is an MMO or needs more MMO mechanics.
---
They're fixing so players can't attack your camp without you being hostile to them first...
---
Yup, he was. Took screenshots before blocking him
---
Like many of my plans I don't even remember how the hell I even got it lol. It might have been a drop from the queen or I might have bought it from a vendor but can't remember.
---
I am extremely entered for it.
---
… in the closet.
---
\*As a follow on\*
---
As fallout is free market capitalism at its finest this is exponetially faster than in real life. Also understand drop rates for legendary 3\* with an ideal roll of your choice are 1-500000ish.  Assuming a 3\* legendary even shows which makes the number much greater.  Thats why when the TSE dupes were a thing you could get a fantastic weapon for 2k at the lowest.  If tons of people have tons of caps and no where to spend them demand comes into play, Which is why people pay 25k+ now for things.
---
I think some other additional fixes to this would be to have legendary vendor cost caps in addition to scrip.  Allow players to exchange caps like 100-1 for scrip.  Since i think it will function like gambling and not an actual reroll of an item a player owns.  They also could lower the prices of things and make them easier to aquire in game rather than in social media or other trading platforms.  For example having bulk springs cost 150 when you can get them 15 per on social media.  People look for convinence and ease after all, and need incentive.  Make the Card for sheepsquatch cost 500 cause you can nuke the queen for "free" and the loot table is agruably better.
---
Nice thank you, will have a gander.
---
Definitely something a lot of people are waiting on, the private server support.  I think a lot of developers have lost sight of the appeal of online gaming has always been the communities which form up, and though 76 isn't the only offender, it seems especially weird in this case to have so many systems actively discouraging it while in a setting all about communities coming together and rebuilding civilization in their own images.
---
That is no better. It adds nothing to your argument, and you have no evidence of either happening. It's another garbage slippery slope argument in a subreddit full of them.
---
I figured. Can't blame you, I've done it myself :)
---
Weird flex post.
---
Same person.
---
I am excited about my camp being on the map honestly. They are making them invincible soon regardless so not too worried about it.
---
How about being smart and actually just transfering all your plans to one character and make him the crafter for all five of your characters?
---
Your god damn right
---
Would've been nice to have the Fuel be similar to the Fusion/Plasma Cores.
---
This is why this game will succeed. Add 6 more months of good story-telling and seal the deal.
---
Probably referring to raider leathers (the under armor) and sack gas mask.
---
That and bright yellow, stand out like a sour thumb.
---
groves family cabin int the south west forest
---
They want to make the grind to gather 450,000 caps needed to buy all the serum plans longer lol.
---
18 mutations
---
25k caps each
---
= One heck of a grind that Power Armor can't match
---
Why would you need serums plans learned on more than 1 character... Just make them on the character you learned them on and transfer the serum to your other characters. There's no need for all of your characters to know all the plans...
---
Honestly bloody mess is a damage buff for all weapons.  Everyone should max it
---
I dunno. It seems like crap legendaries will be turned into script, good ones will be stuck into player vending machines and bot vendors will have nothing but civil war hats and marine tactical helmets. I don't expect to see much legendary gear being sold outside of player vending.
---
I'm just bummed that they went from "decorate your camp" to "... with display cases!" Not surprised, and I certainly can't blame them wanting to avoid the inevitable "I crashed a server with 5000 cheese wheels and a grenade" youtube videos. Still slightly bummed.
---
This is the correct answer.

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2J2ong0O2B6GAI1AeIdGcp/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-29-2019
---
Hmm we will see. I'm definitely looking forward to it
---
It'll come out at the same time as camp protection. As long as you're in adventure and not currently claiming a workshop, you'll be fine.
---
Agreed we need more, love to use flamer and cyro with hordes of enemies but darn if that ammo isn't hard to come by and make.
---
Praise the Zetans, our benevolent masters
---
Ladies and gentlemen, the raider chieftan!
---
Ive bought and crafted a set with the bone and this didnt happen, havent seen anyone else say it either
---
Patch notes: removed Mythical naming prefix to balance player expectations.
---
I would try the raider leathers which is an underarmor and the sack hood /gas mask you can buy at either vendor right by rose.
---
&gt; I am finally on my way to meet up with the overseer
---
me too, brother, me too
---
You can, I got the BOS mod for combat armour last night.  After reading this post, I crafted 15-20 L10 combat arms (make sure to use White Knight Perk) and while scrapping I got the BOS mod :)
---
It didn't show right away, logged off &amp; back on, now it's there. It's just the luck of the RNG gods.  
---
Definitely recommend using grape mentats to increase odds when scrapping anything. 
---
Thank you to all for the comments, very helpful.
---
Don't matter how large it is, I'll fill it within a day. Hoarder gotta hoard
---
Yeah not a huge surprise :/ Just be wary if they pop back up again.
---
I've had it happen with the Free Range Sheepsquatch. I was trying to loot the legendary and it just straight up disappeared before I could and unlike ghouls this guy starts underground so there's no way to refund the corpse at its spawn point.
---
Oh when they add the option to transfer items between characters? Is it he mailbox item in camp plans that I haven't unlocked yet?
---
The clothing categories can be pretty ambiguous, but any under-armor that takes on Raider lining mods like the Harness or Long Johns should count. For outfits, the Drifter outfit and Leather Coats *might* work, but I'm really not sure. Sack hoods should count as raider headgear, too - are the Assault Gas Masks from Fallout 4 in this game?
---
He deleted the thread, or it was removed actually. His account is still up but I blocked him
---
I think you've been spending too much time under power lines drinking nukashine friend.
---
Instigating doesnt work too well with it since itd only count for the first bullet and they dont do much damage due to the high fire rate
---
No this was on PC.
---
Not really.
---
Beat her last night and got a 1* Suppressor's Knuckles.  Now, I don't mind so much, because I'm level 325 and I've got time and materials to spare.  However, there are a lot of other players that sink SO MUCH into ammo, repairs, chems...
---
The drops need to be better from her if that's their final boss.
---
I tried to do the same but i couldn't get it short enough (im 13) so it just looked really wierd
---
I'd be interested in purchasing that plan.  What you looking to get for it?  I have a lot of plans, maps, caps, even a few decent legendarys
---
Had same plan but can't find one already repaired, and no I will not repair it using my aluminum, I need that aluminum to make my tinfoil hats!!!
---
Honestly, no. I don't think so. The casual protective/shielded lining is still printed on unobtainium. There's plenty of stuff that's just been left to the what if machine.
---
Tried to run swarm of suitors the other day. It was still broken too. At least the treasure map at the event worked now. 🤷😥
---
What???
---
I *literally* commented my original comment before OP gave permission.
---
that Furious Cryo is terrible....so terrible that I insist that you let me take it off your hands if you are on xbox! lol
---
j/k
---
....but no really how much you want?
---
Couldn’t agree more!  There are still players that do not run the cards for whatever reason.  I only ever saw the disappearance of corpses the few times I forgot to switch from super duper.
---
Wow! Thank you so much for the community outreach, I didn’t expect it. I read every article, look forward to it!
---
Yes this! Tired of having to delete all those photos.
---
That’s shitty, and if someone not running bloody mess got the last blow there’s no explosion... sorry for your loss!
---
Hey dude, point taken, but don't you insult my baby.  My meat hook does 1,200 damage base before adrenaline.  That guy could have done some significant damage had he chosen to and saved you a ton of ammo.  I think he was fucking with you, sadly.
---
Ur*
---
Ur god damn right
---
That would be awesome if you could please.
---
I'll google now and check what mats are needed
---
Its fun and there is new content but all the new content seems to bring new bugs so it can be a bit buggy still, worth getting a key for though if you can for less than £15
---
Like everyone...
---
1.5k, or I'll make you one for materials +tip. Won't be on till tonight though.
---
Thanks! Hadn't seen that one
---
Buy it and find out, nobody can tell you if it's worth it but you.
---
I used one of the US government supply requisition holotapes to summon a drop, then when it showed up and descended to drop the box down and I could get super close I took the photo
---
YES! On my first film crafting effort I crafted (inadvertently) almost double the amount of my actual photo library allottment
---
Do you use the stealth perk? it's not clear in your post.
---
And again, check your pipboy lamp (each time I get spotted it's because it's accidentaly turned on).
---
It's not impossible to transfer items between characters right now... Just find a container to put them in, have a friend on the same world or check recents, switch characters and go get them...
---
Sounds good. I'll purchase that. My PSN is Kishinsama42. I should be online later tonight. I'll be on the lookout for you
---
I just build my camp by Arktos Pharmacy and use an extractor. Its cheaper and faster all around. Plus you can take from the ground while its extracting every time you spawn in. I got up to 500 in some days and was able to bulk ALL THINGS.
---
No it doesn't exist.
---
[DETECTED]
---
There's a lot of threads just like yours - might be worth it to read through them and see but no one can tell you if it's going to be worth it to you or not as everyone has a different playstyle - likes different things - some tolerate bugs more than others /shrug
---
10% is fine. Hell, 20% is fine. The game needs cap sinks.
---
Added you.
---
*Mothman didn't like that*
---
I'm watching this on mute @ work and I can hear BFG Division playing in my head as I watch this.
---
Are there any game breaking bugs present? Im fine with harmless bugs like some stuff we saw in games like Skyrim and any other Bethesda game that I’ve played recently.
---
Bunker Buster is the better option to unlock more fun things to do so I would advise to do that first and if you want all legionaries from completing quests be at lvl 50+ before completing.
---
\*\*Spoiler below\*\*
---
&gt;!Making yourself part of Enclave and completing Bunker Buster will net you new events around the map related to them and finishing BoS questline line will only net you plans for Ultracite armor so its probably more important to unlock the Enclave events that appear around the map.!&lt;
---
Excavator calibrated shocks are pretty common at vendors. They're listed as "Calibrated Shocks" with no other descriptors so it's not totally obvious they're for the excavator set.
---
If you were into Fallout 4 most of the mechanics of this one will fit like a glove. You're going to want to scrap all your junk before you put it in your stash to save on weight. You learn weapon mods from scraping weapons, same with armor. You don't really need to repair things early on, just replace weapons and armor you get from dead things and doing events. VATS sucks at first, but as you level up it gets incredibly useful. If the event "Leader of the Pack" procs on your server go do it, it's low level and you might get a nice legendary piece. Springs, screws, aluminum and ballistic fiber are all premium junk and should be hoarded.
---
This happens to me all the time kinda annoying especially when its a 3* enemy.
---
Okay but they can still get bounty for stealing right?  I keep my locks on level 0 so they will get a bounty Lol
---
Oh thanks that explains it
---
- you can fast travel while inside a building
---
- fast travelling costs caps but not to vault 76 and your or your friends camps
---
- scrap weapons to get mods for it
---
- mods will be destroyed if you change them
---
- legendary weapons now can have 3 legendary effects
---
- go to whitesprings to buy and sell stuff, it's also a good farming spot
---
Yeah I'm assuming that's still the case.
---
You can "tag" items such as screws or wood. This will hive you a magnifying glass icon on any junk item that contains that item you want. For example if you tag aluminum if you hover over an aluminum tray it will have an icon showing that the tray has the item you tagged.
---
Don't build a base close to the golf club as someone will destroy it.
---
im at work so i cant view that link unfortunately, mind paraphrasing what it says?
---
Your items don't get destroyed if you are under the cap and add more. Game will just tell you that you cant fit more when you try get past the absolute limit.
---
Don't worry about buying plans early on - you will find them / earn them plenty from events. 
---
Be careful taking workshops early on - this will flag you for PVP. But it is a good way to get resources / plans.

I made mine look like Piper FO4 but she’s seen some stuff so she looks a little rough.
---
just encountered this but I'm in the middle of the quest xD
---
Oh I've done that a few times but they didn't always work out. Odds are low but already lost a TSE Dragon in some random train station after I crashed loading into 2nd character and the Fallout Social menu erased everyone I played with recently. To whoever found my baby Dragon have fun with it and thats if someone found it or could of merely been deleted during a server shutdown lol.
---
They don't have to be solely defence missions, but something a bit light-hearted but that's also a challenge.
---
Sour thumb... I love malaphors XD
---
It's okay by me, it's not like our resources will stop by the time we go back to our camp it's ready for taking :3
---
I met a guy with a 3* furious rolling pin. I laughed til i watched him DESTROY all the super mutants at Harpers Ferry in a hurry. 
---
Tied to the right cards and gear, modded, the rolling pin ain't no joke.
---
Balls of Cotton Eye Sloppy Joe
---
I don't believe any of the instrument weapons have available mods.
---
 If you see any scorchbeasts don't worry they are really friendly so its good to approach them.
---
hate to get political BUTT this is a perfect example of what democrats DO NOT understand..... FREE stimpacks and FREE radaway for everyone under level 49 but everyone that is playing must pay 100 caps a day for this to work.
---
Carry Weight: Is now capped to an absolute limit of 1,500 pounds over the character’s current maximum carry weight.
---
For example: If your carry weight limit is 210 pounds, then your maximum limit is 1,710 pounds.
---
Characters will be unable to exceed this new weight limit moving forward.
---
Characters who already exceed this limit will be unable to add any additional items or caps to their inventories until they have reduced their carry weight below the cap.
---
Dev Note: These limits exist primarily to keep servers from performing poorly, which can happen when we have too many items in the game world. They also play role in helping to regulate the in-game economy. We do recognize the desire to be able to own more of the cool items that we have in the game, and we are looking into a variety of solutions, including increasing the stash size. We will be sure to talk more about this when they are ready.
---
To be honest I had this same problem. No loot after a few times in the same spot. My under is there are 3 spots BBQ place, southern belle motel, and another(forgot where). You gotta go to the other spots and do the event to get all the extra stuff
---
Right? Me too. Loving the idea of selling stuff without somebody requesting my personal gear.
---
Your original post was about a sibling who was underage.
---
Take it as you will.
---
Reddit also isn't the real world, take that as you will too. Down votes or whatever. 
---
I agreed with your original post that the behavior experienced was not right.
---
But neither was complaining to Bethesda that your siblings snowflake rule breaking, age inappropriate feelings were hurt.
---
You also messaged me first, out of the blue, so you can't really complain that I reply.
---
That's stupid people shouldn't be able to kill me an hour later on the other side of the map when Im obviously not at all contesting it just because they have there friend go and stand in it while they track me down if they want PvP to be more of a thing why don't they make a mode for it oh ya they did
---
One of my characters is "me". 
---
Should revisit him. Been having way too much fun with my "Wasteland Doc" character lately though.
---
"Psst, hey... whatcha doin?"
---
In other fallouts they called me the deathclaw hugger, so i already hoped this would be in the game
---
I wish this game had a height slider.
---
Thats intended functionality
---
Yea but at the same time that would change the hitbox but i would love to do myself in the game
---
I would support this if sitting on the toilet for 30 seconds gave you the well rested buff so you could use the toilet instead of a bed.  They bothered to put tons of toilets in the game world, let's use em.
---
Yeah i kind of really like selling stuff. Feels like I'm spending most of my time playing fallout 76 on the trading subreddit. This feature will get trading back to the game also it's really convenient especially for cheap stuff you wouldn't usually bother trying to sell.
---
Yup I said this all day yesterday and got down voted for it 😂
---
I've been on quite a few queen killing adventures with a couple select groups that specialize in that. All the right cards and gear, everyone knows what to do. 3x nukes back to back about 15-20 minutes after she dies. One night she went down in 8 minutes,  followed by a nearly sub 7 minute run. If she didn't fly off doing whatever she felt like it would have been fast.
---
Gear has always been shit and it isn't getting better.
---
Yeah my camps next to there cuz it's possible to get two bobbleheads over there (though it keeps being already looted as of late)
---
they dont. Plasma rifles was locked to 1star and nocturnal only for quite some time
---
Quite frustrating, yes. Should have been addressed a long time ago. It makes player to player trading a total crap shoot.
---
..but be wary, they do have bad breath 🤢
---
Fair enough, but I'd still want to test it for science.
---
I always see a camp there, often getting attacked by scorched. Other than that, seems like a great spot.
---
I'd be happy if people would stop refering to all explosive guns as TSE's.
---
The vendor at the ski lodge right next to the trainstation @ top of the world sells bunch of raider gear FYI
---
I run rank 3 bloody mess and lose corpses all the time. Just last night I had 2 legendary mutants disappear before I could loot them. Iv seen it happen before but not as much as this week or so.
---
Considering that this game is just a reused single player engine that wasn't designed for multiplayer, lazy game design seems to actually be Bethesda's thing.
---
&gt;Assault Gas Masks from Fallout 4 in this game 
---
yep I saw one at the vendor, also selling sack hoods and such
---
Free to 500 caps is what I’ve seen on the market.
---
Oh cool. Where are you planning to move? I cant say I have been many places around WV myself but I can vouch for the beauty of Harpers Ferry.
---
Lol sorry, I was joking about how Bethesda might respond to this.
---
I’ve always read that since the event started, but after having completed it around 40 times, I’m not so sure about that anymore. I’ve completed it with 3 Brahmin left many times and wasn’t guaranteed a plan drop. Mutton meat almost every time, but not necessarily a weapon or mod plan. Alternatively, I’m pretty sure I have gotten weapon and mod plans even with 1 or 2 Brahmin alive. It still seems pretty random to me, but I’ve honestly not been expensively tracking all the conditions and rewards. Some hard data would be great
---
Lol! It wasn’t a complaint. And this is not about my sibling. That was my twin brother. Honestly this post is none of your business. Don’t reply and stop writing to me. It’s as simple as that.  Bye :)
---
I am on pc as well.........
---
Lol, then you will def enjoy. Some advice. There is a mission "mayor for a day" in Watoga. It rewards the all rise which is a good mele weapon and makes the robots friendly. Keep in mind when doing main and side missions the rewards are capped to your level up to 50. Sometimes its better to level up first. There are daily repeatable quests and events you can  do. Go to camden park asap so you can start getting those mr fuzzy tokens!
---
Then i dont know what to say apart from report it to bethesda
---
Because its a way to stick it to the man, you know what kind of damage washer or dryer with a typewriter in it running does to it? This is what caused so much inflation in the days before the nukes dropped.
---
&gt; I know what will happen though, the prices will rise for the basic stuff.
---
Yep. It's called inflation and it is a real thing.
---
Also, while I am not sure if you were serious or not but ideas like the 'air container' is actually a good idea
---
My guy &lt;3 haha
---
That's awesome. I really can't wait to see some pictures!
---
Not reactive plates but I forgot I had Tesla
---
And omg. There was no post about an underage sibling. You’re crazy dude or girl. Or whatever you are lol. Leave me alone. Again. It wasn’t a complaint. If you saw the YouTube vid which you won’t because it shows my real  name and pic, you’d understand. So stop judging and commenting and go troll something else that’s more worth your useless time.
---
I renamed all of my "keeper" gear to "\*(Name)", and have not had a problem since, because the \* is really, really obvious.
---
Of course, before that I got in the habit of not spamming buttons at a vendor or in the pipboy or in containers or, well, anywhere. That helped too.
---
Not saying a lock system wouldn't be nice, but there are other options to solve the problem for now.
---
It’s not absurd, and it has little to do with the mule accounts. You have to remember that game economies function differently from real world ones: they can infinitely produce more currency, with little to no limit on it. As players rack up more hours and collect caps directly from drops and from selling, the economy slowly deflates from the amount of caps in circulation. The only way to inflate the market is to impose more sinks to “drain” the excess currency that’s currently over-saturating the market. All MMOs do this.
---
Good to know, Thank you
---
No, because while they call it a "tax" it is more realistically a sink (or a consumption mechanism)
---
Taxes, in proper use, would have bots out fixing the roads and cleaning up the trash.
---
I would love this but would have massive issues with this update in other countries. Quite a few countries have issues with gambling hence why many games like Pokemon have the gambling locations ripped out of them or not done again in some remakes.
---
My Fiance and I are planning a summer trip to see FO76 locations in real life!
---
Sounds like a SBQ drop to me. I didn't even know the LMG had any mods to speak of.
---
sorry that was my bad; should of said that it was for pc
---
I can have raider underarmor and sack hood, then we can switch roles. IGN Baronik

Does the flamer plasma mod heal teammates with the perk, or is it just the flamer?
---
Idk man it’s much worse than this games release your just not hearing about it cause it didn’t sell well to begin with

Well, they know that they made shitty marketing choices. We can complain for the next ten years but what is it really accomplishing? Just gotta hope that they learn from their mistakes. I’m sure they will do more marketing. After all, they do need to pay their employees to continue to develop a game we bought once and they provide the free DLCs. I’m sure they will make more bad choices as they push to see how much the public will allow. I see Bethesda a lot like kids. Push a little, get away with some but not all. I think they will perform better as well if people compliment them on the things that they do right, rather than pointing out the negative that has been covered a million times.
---
I’ll start buying atoms if they continue to do a good job and keep the game playable. If not, I don’t see the point of the investment. I don’t need atoms nor have they came out with much that I want. But I do believe in supporting a company that builds a game right. This one has a ton of potential. Just gotta look past the negative youtubers. Most of them just watch someone else’s video and make the same complaints so they can get likes, subscribers and such. It’s not nearly as bad as the youtubers claim.
---
Do you have a link to an image of West Virginian
---
I would love this and plus would be easy atoms for Bethesda to sell.
---
A twin brother is a sibling......
---
As a public post on Reddit it is my business. 
---
But yeah if you stop messaging me directly, multiple times, I will stop writing to you.  Its as simple as that.
---
My question...
---
Do you think the 10% fee is enough to outweigh the amount of caps being created?
---
Current expectation: I will get my dream 10mm Two Shot Explosive with 3rd perk vats related gun on first attempt or I will cry upon not getting it and curl up under my desk.
---
Not a good or fun way. Just a way
---
&gt;… we absolutely love the… house prices… [and] the cost of living
---
Yeahhhhhh, I wonder why.
---
Lol! You are ridiculous and obviously just want the last word. leave us alone

Thanks man, people like you are the ones who make this community so great

About the lack of text chat and that damn USA law: Anthem, which I also own, launched without text chat.  
---
In their latest patch, looks like they are doing noticeable steps towards text chat, and to accomodate to the regulation.
---
Its still a mess and surreal, but at least they noticed about the issue:  
---
* Added STT (Speech-to-Text) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) on all platforms.  
---
 [https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/patch-110?setLocale=en-us](https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/patch-110?setLocale=en-us)   
---
It's still surreal and a mess, imo (haven't logged in some weeks) as they seem to have added speech to text, and text to speech, but I am not sure if....text to text has been implemented XD. There is no mention, but I would find it strange that you can TTS without TTT.  
---
Anyway, looks like at least they are doing steps towards this. The game should have launched with text chat, as the more successfull division2 (dont own it) did, and I also expected em to implement it by now. But well, lets keep asking for it!
---
abso-fckn-loooootly!!!!
---
I skipped that chapter in The Anarchist Cookbook, but you make sense: you can destroy legible correspondence and clean clothes in one move!  Dastardly!
---
I will try this weekend, I haven't had a lot of luck with posting pics, but I'll see what I can do.
---
EXACTLY! I love this game and have not bought anything with external currency. Think about the effort it takes to find a negative. Now think about the effort it takes to find a positive. Instead of taking the easy way out, help them or figure out the problem yourself or find a new game. Filling a forum page with posts about your personal opinion that is formed from a biased consensus accomplishes as much as you'd expect.
---
Yes this! Want to display armor and outfits!
---
Survival is where I do workshops for plans. Counterintuitive but works.
---
The right side of the map is good due to lack of train stations and most fighting happening at 76, ws, tow. Also cap penalty is less for death.
---
To be fair this blind faith in what they adding to the game is going to be amazing is whats keeping this game a float. Legendary system was so badly balanced that we are really desperate maybe we get what we been looking for, played since day 1 and currently lvl200 on main still have found only a few of legendary 10 mm pistols and all were just trash.
---
Very likely not overall, but it at least means that big sales (25k+) will remove more caps from the economy than vendor resets adds. 
---
There should probably be some other sink at some point, I'm guessing a fee to convert unused perk cards or similar. Maybe paid repair kits from vendors?
---
There's Karma in the waste land..
---
I am a support NPC at heart &lt;3 have a great day!

Anyone still watching this thread?  I'm on PC and found the guy at whitesprings. I'll keep moving around trying not to afk as long as I can if you guys want to send friend invites to grab it.

I know in game there are:
---
Nuka cola paint job - fetch quest
---
Nuka quantum paint job - fetch quest
---
Prototype for x01 - unlocked by quest 
---
BoS - farm technical documents
---
The rest are atom store.
---
May be missing

Here's what Ansel looks like at the Whitesprings main entranct.

Not much. But I'll trade an unbelievable amount of stuff for a sun mask.
---
Don't steal. If a container says steal in a workshop somebody has claimed and you pick the lock, you will get a bounty. Also applies to some supply drop containers annoyingly.
---
If you unintentionally do get a bounty, just take it on the chin if somebody tries to claim it. If you are actively for racking up a bounty and PvP, have at it, but I can't stand people who have one that get all upset when somebody comes after them. It's part of the game and everybody gets a bounty at some point. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Everyone wants to explain this in a way that makes Bethesda seem like they’ve put a monumental amount of philosophical thought into the issue of “too many caps in the economy” and how to fix that issue. 
---
Come on guys, for real?
---
Bugs!
---
There had to have been some new exploit that opened up regarding trading back and forth and somehow the caps people got were increasing. Or it opened the door to duplicating items or caps in some way we didn’t see. There are glitches involving buying and selling back items in other games. Hell, new Vegas had a giant exploit like this. If they pushed back the feature like they did, it was broken in major ways. We likely won’t ever know in what ways because of the change they implemented that we haven’t heard mentioned prior to yesterday. Which is great. But I think people are looking too deep into the “why a 10% reduction?” Bethesda most likely won’t ever come right out and say it, but it’s probably due to unforeseen bugs with straight trading back and forth in some way.
---
Search Groups for FO76, The MinuteDudes Group should come up near the top of the list, once you have joined you can check the group to see who's online and join their game.
---
On PS4 at least all photomode photos are saved in the Ps4's photo album.  Even if you delete them from FO76 they're still visible in the Ps4 album.
---
I highly recommend getting a Mic, group play depends heavily on good communication, and texting on Xbox sucks.
---
I completely agree. You can inform Bethesda of issues and sometimes you have every right to be upset. Like me losing my executioners assault rifle with faster fire rate and +1 agility to a server crash. That’s a god roll item and I lost it for a reason that wasn’t my own. So yea, I think times like that, a person deserves to be upset. But you also look at the pro end of things. If they didn’t ban all of those duper’s and fell through with unbanning them, would we still have a game to play? We all saw server stability skyrocket when they got banned and the items were deleted.
---
There’s informing them and then there’s just abuse. All that I can hope for is that Bethesda tries to please both types of players. The ones that want an overly easy game and players like me that want it harder. I’ve never complained about queen drops or legendary drops aside from getting a drill, which occasionally still happens. But I like knowing that I have something to work toward still. But you do have the other side of the spectrum which is those who expect 3 star legendaries off of 3 star creatures. Rather than acknowledging that a 3 star gives you a chance of a 3 star, while a one star has no chance.
---
Its a random drop from event and its rather low but good luck finding my fellow vault dweller.

Tattered field jacked + wrapped hood worked for me. Drifter outfit+ sack didn't.
---
I mean, they are trying. Its sad that most people think 2k caps is too much for an assaultron recall card.
---
It seems like most Reddit posters wouldn't spend 2k on a guaranteed 3 star item.
---
Thanks Badthesda! Just let him play the game how he wants! He bought it he should get to play his way, with easily attainable highest tier gear!
---
Search Groups on Xbox for FO76, the MinuteDudes group should come up near the top.
---
You mean you left your butt cover open after dropping a deuce?
---
I’m excited for this update. I’m mostly intrigued to see how everyone’s base and CAMPs look like. Great way to get ideas and inspiration.
---
Shame, wanted to add more rings or something :/ 
---
thanks for the reply tho
---
Welcome to the wasteland!
---
It was adventure mode and we both have pacifist more on and my friend got the thing like an hour before I even got on and we we're no where near the workshop we were just building his house so why should we have expected him to come track us down sneak up on us and kill us when we weren't even fighting for the workshop we shouldn't have to leave a server after claiming a workshop just so some assholes that's too bad at the game to play survival uses a work around to come kill us
---
Well the same username made a very simar post just before this one, talking about an underage player.
---
Those posts have now been deleted. 
---
If that wasn't you then you need to check who has access to your account.
---
Friend invite sent.
---
There's currently an issue causing Player Icons to be reset to the default icon when you exit the game client. We're planning to address this in patch 9 next week.
---
I wonder if you can have a barter exchange system in place?
---
Or even better... Use pre-war money, essentially making it an alternative currency!
---
[Thanks! This is what it looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/c36TYad)
---
Ahh i see. So the two shot  explosive ultracite pistol i have would be considered legacy
---
Aye inflation.... but I don’t see the need for it in game.  Some might say It’s only being used to fill yet another gap. That gap being a poor ill conceived economy. 
---
If they’re gonna spout the [greed](https://i.imgur.com/URYzWp3.jpg)  line then perhaps dropping the 25k limit might give some credence to it.
---
Was joking about the air container.  Wouldn’t be surprised if they did try and charge for free air next
---
Its not making it harder doing this. Its making it tedious
---
I haven’t even seen those so Gtfo out of my post. Leave me alone.
---
You need to go do something better with your time PC. Get off my post and go complain and troll something else. Weirdo.
---
I had a TSE silenced gun and everything around could pinpoint me when I shot it.
---
I swapped to a 1 \* instigating and mobs have literally pushed me aside looking for me.
---
I run 5 pieces of chameleon gear.
---
Also, if there are two mob types in the area, your stealth is shot, it seems also. 
---
Like super mutants fighting a vertibird or scorched.
---
Best to let one side win before you open fire, at least that is the way it seems to me.

RIP AND TEAR

I have a basic ps4 and it works great be patient with it or see if something might be wrong with ur console or something
---
Please update this list, as it’s the only great resource currently to track all the available plans!!
---
I recently obtained a Barbed Sheepsquatch Staff plan that I didn’t even know existed.
---
Those crazy ghouls...they will put anything in a washer. SMH
---
Bloody mess does not fix the issue. i've had it happen multiple times with Bloody mess 3 equipped.
---
Great!
---
You can pick them up from Scorched down in the southern part of Cranberry Bog a lot, and there is a plan to make them, but I have made 20, and scrapped them all, plus picked up at least 50 more and scrapped, but never learned a single mod.
---
It kinda sucks, since the Death Tambo was one of my Favorite weapons before I got a good 3\* DC Gauntlet.
---
Waiting near the Rose
---
Sack Hood+Raider Leathers worked for me
---
That hasn’t been my experience but I’m sorry this hasn’t been working for you.
---
Sorry, Berry mentats (increase intelligence) NOT grape mentats.
---
LOL.
---
That's what taxes are expected to be used for.
---
What taxes actually end up being used for is extravagant  pay raises for government employees and wasteful government contracts that are funneled to the friends and donors of bureaucrats.
---
Really! Source ?
---
This. 
---
The 10% fee is a nice idea to help fix the economy, but ultimately I don't think it will change anything.
---
 Caps are way too common in the wasteland and having the cap limit at a tiny 25k doesn't help either. 
---
Personally, I would rather Bethesda introduce an item for item trade economy or just decrease how often caps can be found in game.
---
Did you get the last hit on the mob when this occurred?
---
The mutants in the DC area can be a bit more violent.
---
Ich wünsche euch viel Glück und Spaß in eueren neuen Heimat!
---
Make a few pictures of your "camp"!
---
I keep farming those technical documents and haven't gotten the BOS yet. Does Luck have an impact on it or is it completely random?
---
Or government robots sitting on their ass all day getting a pay raise.
---
You will have to post about it!
---
I'm limited on my time to do stuff currently, but if you could go through the comments and put together all the ones I am missing, I'd be more than happy to add them. I wish I could look around for ones that are confirmed even outside of this thread, but it's the last few weeks of my semester before I get my degree at the moment.
---
Rewards for PvP should have been removed entirely from Adventure the day Survival went live.  Currently the only time I see pvp on PS4 in adventure mode is griefing and forcing people into pvp that don't want to pvp.  I had to remove 3 mutations last week so I am not forced to pvp every time I pass the whitespring or a train station.  Sucks we are forced to play the game the way a few jerks want to play it when all we want to do is play the game the way it was intended.
---
As long as you charge less than the vendor bot.
---
... after feeding your mogwai at 12:01 am.
---
Gotcha. I’ll make a compiled post later today I think. I’ve combed through these comments multiple times, it’s overall a great post for this information! Good luck with finals!
---
For security reasons I won't be too specific, but we will be within 30m of Harpers Ferry and Berkley Springs Castle! It took everything responsible in our minds not to buy the first house we saw in Harpers Ferry. It's just not a wise decision but we were like "BUT ITS SO PRETTY WE COULD LIVE THERE OMG". But eventually adult mode kicked in haha!
---
Ahh good to know
---
Oh well, it sucks for you my dude.
---
Pistol builds are completely viable. Like someone else said, you won't be a one man army, but I'm having a blast leveling up an alt as a sneaky pistol ninja. Sneak VATS crit shots will take huge chunks of HP off of most creatures, and a couple follow shots will usually finish them off. 
---
One suggestion would be to invest at least 3 points in strength and take the first rank of each card in the slugger or gladiator tree (depending on your preference for 1 vs 2 handed). If you get bum rushed by a swarm of ghouls it's nice to have something to smack them with.
---
I have bloody mess and this happens to me sometimes
---
They don't really.  I think I got it from the queen but I think I've also maybe seen prime receiver plans at BOS vendor at times.  Don't quote me on that though.
---
Thank you. I'll try to be ready next Tuesday too to get a bunch of information together from the new patch.
---
Dupers bought all of the serum recipes and sell mutations for 300 caps.
---
Blame dupers for not only the tax but the massive increase in vendor prices.
---
I can understand that.  Im actually a similar distance, so I tend to try out the hiking trails in Harpers Ferry. If you can manage a steeper climb, I actually know of a shortcut to the top of the cliff.
---
How do you access them? I couldn’t find them in the gallery app!
---
*clap clap, clap clap clap, clap clap clap clap, DOG SHOW!*
---
You can buy the plan, make them and break them down. I have found the on scorched. Dont know if there are any mods for them tho.
---
That's why I use the T-51 most of the time, though I'm trying to score calibrated shocks for X-01 for nuke zones. The other models I just don't have a use for.
---
Please don't make grenades out of your own poop and throw them at me.
---
Could you pass along a request to make it optional, if implemented? 
---
Personally, I prefer a less cluttered UI and would rather not have more elements (unless they're extremely unobtrusive) added.
---
Is it safe?
---
They typed something dirty
---
I am on xbox, would be open to trade for rifle/lever action/pipe pistol.  I prefer playing a  sneak/sniper build and still working on trying to improve my weapons/build (takes awhile to undo, 40 levels of poor perk picks)
---
I've been wanting to be the back end of a trading operation for quite a while. I like the grind for gear and don't want to spend my time trading and selling and dealing with people. I'm kinda anti social but have pretty good luck with the RNG. The vending machines will be a good compromise for me.
---
I keep my TSE pump shotty solely for destroying turrets and mainframe cores in the silos. For everything else, my bloodied lever action is much more satisfying to paly with.
---
[I made a post about the damage that it did](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdxtf2/the_converted_alien_blaster_is_shit_why_is_this/)
---
The level 20 one I had did 5 damage without perks and 8 damage with perks maxed, in the post I use High voltage Hefe and Overdrive and both of those increased the damage by 1.5?
---
Awesome shot and congrats to having it featured! 
---
Apparently, spending a bunch of Atoms on a new PA paintjob goes a long way towards drawing Bethesda's attention... almost... like a moth... being drawn to the light. (⌐■_■)
---
Are you sure about that? They just "indefinitely delayed" all upcoming planned end game content.
---
Nope.  Rifleman for single shot, commando (I believe is the name) for automatic.
---
Alec Knox, born inside the vault a few years after Vault 76 closed to a Texan Veteran of the war turned vault security guard. A mischievous, trouble maker of a child who held the title of designated hitter on his baseball team, his father encouraged Alec's competitive behavior, instilling in him the idea that he had to be the one on top in every situation. Passing his time with sports and a love of Gronak comics, he was anxious and excited when the vault finally opened, wanting to get out into the world.
---
Picking through the desolate wastes of Appalachia, he finds himself taken with ideals of the Raiders in the Savage Divide; the strongest survive. Setting up his own base, loving called Fort Knox, over the bones of an old raider camp, he now spends his days raiding through what's left of Appalachia, trusted axe by his side, more often than not drunk of whiskey, or high on fury. Or both, after a particularity good score.
---
I can help you two add each other as friends. You both should add and join me. IGN: jchamlin
---
Hey, my character, Alec Knox, is a Texan as well! Are you on PC? If so I'd love to come checkout your saloon!
---
I do hope they expand on the mods for certain unloved weapons. But yeah I'll give at looksee and hope I get lucky.
---
Been seeing more players level 40 and under last couple weeks.
---
Lol dude I did the exact same thing. Came back after months away and forgot dropping vs deploying power armor. Lost my excavator too but whatevs, the ultracite is way too expensive to replace
---
thank you so much
---
I'm always surprised that Violent Night doesn't draw in more people. It's the only "non boss battle" in the game that has server-wide notifications so you know it's active, it guarantees at least 1 legendary, and the endless waves of level 60+ ghouls give a decent chunk of XP. What's not to love?
---
Yep, I’ve successfully completed encryptid about 4-5 times now and still don’t have it
---
Nice...lol
---
thank you very much!
---
Excited? Hell yes! I am literally going to make so much money.
---
That's the price you pay for deciding you need an alt
---
What is up with the players walking really so while you do ALL of the work in keeping the cows alive and fighting the bugs,wolves and bear then jumping in for the sheep?
---
On a side note, I noticed I had like 10+ improved repair kits the other day just from doing the queen a few times.
---
Damn so pay2win. Us non-MTX using players out here stugglin' just to get by huh. Really being forced to shell out some cash
---
you dont need to loot her to get them.

It does, the camera HAS to have the name in the viewfinder. otherwise it won't count.
---
Was fixed a while back.

Hop on the trade subs and make a switch to a rifle. Those are pretty decent pieces.

Some people are assholes here. Brave enough to be a text and troll but nothing more :) Mods here are really helpful though. Post screenshots to them
---
I want the balloon plans I wish I could find someone with an extra one to trade.
---
With ammosmith and super duper you're getting at least 36, and potentially 56 units of fuel per craft. Seems decent enough to me.
---
Agreed.
---
But the combat rifle was bugged at some point that rifleman perks worked with automatic receivers.
---
Looking for confirmation that was patched or not.
---
Some people have recently been having a lot of stuttering but i havent had that myself and not sure how wide spread it is, there arent really any game breaking bugs, i picked up the game a few months ago and have been loving it since, its up to you if you feel like it something you would enjoy
---
There is no reason to do this other than people being lazy.
---
Yeah i didn't think it likely either, but it works perfectly everywhere else, in Windows, online games, sound apps. It's just FO76 where it's dead.
---
and the immersion excuse they use literally doesn't fucking matter. Barely anyone is actually hardcore roleplaying on this game.
---
Having a global text chat literally does nothing but improve the game
---
Always pick up:
---
Military Ammo Bags
---
Military Grade Duct Tape.
---
Maybe it’s a better chance to get better stuff
---
or you could find another player...
---
What are your IGNs?
---
I thought the in game 'info-bits' mentioned scorch beast wings are but I think I tried and they didn't scrap to ballistic. Too bad too, because that one minor item would just about double the value in fighting them.
---
I do really well with weight managment but only by not keeping any extra legendary items and keeping the extra stable flux at a minimum. The only extra items I keep are really good weapons.  I agree we need extra space. It is a job to keep it down at the space limit we have now.
---
we have both sent you friend requests, if you could please accept them so we can draw them?
---
The road by the overseers camp is gonna look like a strip mall...lol
---
Yep, your numbers are right.
---
repair kits = junk you have to collect to repair your stuff. So it's the way for whales to buy junk directly from atom shop. One day i'll count how much 1 junk of each type costs and bring table to the reddit
---
Every player has a chance to earn a base 1400 caps a day and there is not a single requirement to spend any since so much is craftable. Caps also appear out of thin air on kills and for quests, Gradually the value of each cap approaches irrelevance.
---
If there is 200 million in caps in the economy today and 300 million next week that means that box of screws that costs 50 caps at a vendor should become more like 75. But that deosn't happen.
---
Odd you cite a ill-conceived economy and then call the actual, proven tools to replicate a true model, unneeded.
---
GuardianCat and BlackDogsPower
---
For whatever reason, I've found an explosive 10mm pistol works best (by FAR) for the mainframe cores. While my TSE splitter laser and explosive shotgun destroy them, they don't do so in nearly the same radius as the pistol.
---
Yea. It shouldn’t be a pain in the ass to moderate each other. I get why they want a video. It’s hard to dispute a video. But Sony as it is doesn’t offer any type of support if your account gets hacked. If f they hack that, what happens with social media?
---
Chapstick
---
I had some bugged weightless armor that wasn’t allowing chameleon to trigger.  went to a work bench and modded it, and it started working again so maybe try that.
---
Weapon weight reduction + perk cards is... weird.  My heavy has about 25 weapons and they do change weight armored (I think I have one 20%) or PAed, but I haven’t calculated the true reduction.
---
And please don't forget consoles! I still don't understand why games like Destiny 2 have a text chat feature on PC but not on console. It makes being a part of a community that much easier.
---
Have you noticed if they still do damage to your armor, or is it negated before that point?
---
Same. It happened once in a while before the last two patches. Now it pretty consistently happens all the time. Not just legendaries.
---
If you have 15+ luck and are refilling the crit meter fast, what would be a better use of points to replace 4 Leaf Clover?
---
Or get rid of condition.
---
All new passwords? Like that would be a hassle. Pffft. You don't pay is enough for proper support.
---
I mean it happens?
---
Except not really
---
I think there are some powerful melee weapons you can craft with them
---
Man I don’t even remember my YouTube password and I’m lucky if I get my Facebook one right by the third try lol
---
They are needed for some of the sheepsquatch weapons but you dont need to keep more than 3 or 4.
---
I do agree that if a character goes into survival it should be stuck on survival
---
&gt; Would you consider it unethical to switch a character between Adventure and Survival modes?
---
​No
---
&gt; My thoughts on this is once you go into survival, that character should be bound to survival. 
---
No. Taking choice from players is never a good idea. Let people play the way they want when they want.
---
It's simple.
---
I think the flatwoods monster has the ability to hack turrets to make them not target it, its a feature, not a bug (as far as im aware) there should be a purple glow around them while hes near
---
I just want bushes to hide my levitating foundations.
---
In my eyes yes a character should be bound to a mode.
---
But the way Bethesda has it set up I do think in a few cases you should be able to switch back to adventure. If you have no caps left or not enough to pay for your death you should go back to adventure. Same if you have no materials or caps to repair your gear.
---
Should be it’s own post
---
Ah.  Okay then as of Tuesday on PS4 I did not get bonuses for having commando on when I equipped my hardened troubleshooters combat rifle.  I know this cause I face palmed when I realized I had just shot down a key card escort with the wrong perks equipped and wasted ammo/time like a newbie lol
---
What?  I thought armor got better as you went up like this: Raider -&gt; 51 -&gt; 60 -&gt; then Ultracite/X01 were about equal but different?
---
What about melee?
---
Thing about this game that really bugs me is this: melee attacks should basically do no damage to someone in power armor - I mean seriously, your wearing that and somebody comes at you with a knife/golf club/baseball bat/machete etc., you should honestly be able to ***just ignore them!?!???***
---
&gt;you can fast travel while inside a building
---
You have no idea how long it took me to figure this out. This is one of the best tips for new players.
---
They also need a mark as junk. So you can either sell all junk or scrap all junk
---
Yo

You can add as much as you want to your prices but i think what a lot of people are forgetting about is the 25k cap ceiling.... and im pretty sure most of us know what happen to the caps after you hit max. So for example,  say your selling 6 weapons only at 5k caps ea.... and assuming you cap muled all your caps prior to opening your store... you will loose 5k. I think what this will effectively do is cause people to lower prices to sell more. And being caps are over saturated anyway...who cares about the 10% Ebay fee. I know not everyone is in the wasteland 1% but i as a some what activity trader have over 50k caps.... and i know people with 4x that amount.
---
Tldr: i think it will be a good thing.
---
&gt;unless trades become tse combatshotgun for 2000 scrips (that is, a replacement currency).
---
One of the Beth CM's commented yesterday that legendary scrip is locked to your character and couldn't be used for trading purposes.
---
Yes luckily i found that out very early. It's the kind of tips everyone knows but always forgets to tell to new players
---
I can find cans of blue, red and yellow paint easily enough in the wasteland, and paintbrushes, and solvent.  Please let me paint my power armor.  Make us hunt for components - no problem, that's fair.  I have paid for skins I wanted from the Shop, and I will continue to do so when there's something appealing, but being able to make solid colors in the game would be a cool addition.

It was mentioned in one of the “inside the vault” articles by Bethesda but most recently they have only mentioned display cases and they have said they have had to push this back a few weeks.  With display cases for bobbleheads, magazines and weapons mentioned a couple of times now in their inside the vault articles  but no further word on junk items I’m wondering if decorating might be quite limited. The first time “use items from your stash to decorate your camp” was used was in this inside the vault:

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Sadly I think they’ve run into problems and gone down the display case route now but we’ll have to see when it finally rolls out.
---
The responder quest is a good way to familiarize yourself with the game. Just run that for a bit and take the game at your own pace after that. Have Fun!
---
I think, the only reason Bethesda has currently allowed all players intot he survival mode is because its a Beta, they want players to test everything out and having already OP built characters just means they can test the end game in survival without having to wait for new characters to level up.  
---
I think they have mentioned they were thinking of doing like "seasons" where you create a new character every month or few months for it
---
thank you so much we have now friended each other, thank you so much for helping us.
---
Xbox
---
You mean like a hopper
---
Yeah that was the first on i did, with back to basic
---
They currently aren’t used for anything other than breaking down into bone. I have all three weapons and lots of mods for each. Neither the crook, club, or staff, or any of their mods use the skull. The club uses one horn to craft and the staff uses two horns, no skulls.
---
Huh, interesting. I carry a level 25 BE pistol for taking out trash mobs in low level areas (and burning through all the 10mm I find), so next time I run a silo I'll have to try that.
---
Welcome aboard bud hope you enjoy your experience in appalachia.
---
That pic doesnt do the West Virginia paint justice.  I got it cause I wanted a really ugly PA paint cause I'm weird like that.  I was both disappointed and pleased it is in fact a heck of a lot cooler up close.  People check out my PA constantly and ask where I farmed the paint job.
---
Hmm, maybe I’m coming at it from the wrong angle?  Maybe the in game economy is working well and I’m just unlucky at the vendors when I want to spend my hard earned caps... I’ll try the market sub instead 😂😂😂
---
Guaranteed 3 star? You meant 1* wood right?
---
Locking characters between modes does nothing but divide the player base
---
Just to clarify, they aren’t. Only the horns are used for the weapons (club and staff) and the quills are used for sheepsquatch shards
---
Are all 3-stars just default good? 
---
Just got my first three star, lv50 Auto-stim I think metal chest piece with rad resist and pick lock sweet spot 
---
Not complaining but not sure whether that’s something to be excited about
---
Mothman: damnit jimmy i expected better of you 😢!!
---
Also clarifying here to squash (get it) misinformation. The skulls arent used to craft the club or staff, only the horns are
---
Block them and report them for being a moron. Sadly it will not stop them from creating another account in 5 minutes. 
---
Some people are just a-holes who hide behind a keyboard because they suck at life.
---
Yea I agree too the budget is rather small for camp, and no moving camps doesn't give more budget but does fix glitches like if you placed down a poster on a pylon and it got stuck.
---
Yeah I thought that X-01 or Ultracite were the best armours in the game resistance wise as well but it turns out that a level 50 T-51 suit is the best in terms of ballistic and energy resistance:
---
Max level Ultracite gives you 453 ballistic and 393 energy resist.
---
Max level X-01 gives you 398 ballistic and 453 energy resist.
---
Max level T-51 gives you 454 ballistic and 454 energy resist.
---
Only thing that T-51 is worse at is rad resist which is surpassed by both Ultracite and X-01 but that's quite easily manageable with rad-x and radaway.
---
BAD, CDPR GOOD. PRAISE GERALDO.
---
What hasn’t changed is identical posts to this popping up every day that are easy to find via the search function
---
Never thought about it that way, but I've heard about the seasons they'll be doing
---
People buy acid?  I just vendor bulk sold 500 :(
---
Yes u do have to server hop I learned the hard way after they have taken it they can still follow u and around and keep killing u
---
It's crazy, busts mainframes at like 3x the range the laser or shotgun do.
---
Follow the main quest for the first little bit, after that you may need to do side activities to level up a bit more.
---
Yes, play adventure and at lvl 5 turn on pacifist mode.
---
Avoid ppl who sell weapons for irl money its sketchy and generally viewed with negativity.
---
Jump on in, the nuclear waste is fine.
---
Yes, its solo friendly. You can also join the discord to find others to play with.
---
A LOT, please look at the Bethesda site, every week have new contend....
---
I noticed it sometimes wouldn't continue the quest once I completed part of it. I just logged off and back in for the fix. Good luck.
---
I’ve basically stopped picking locks unless it’s level 3. I’ve found some solid stuff from those so I keep trying. Maybe I’ll start checking some 2’s as well but I probably won’t go too much deeper than that.  It’s just a pain to swap cards back and forth
---
They are.
---
Yes yes yes yes yes
---
In regards to number 3 absolutely not. Don't let yourself get caught up in the need for god rolls... You will get drops and be able to trade for stuff just as good.
---
.... didn’t you engage in pvp tho?
---
you took the bait
---
For sure!
---
Can you make the crook and scrap it to get those mods? or they are drops only?
---
If you take a workshop, you should at ALL times move sneaking - once you sneak, after a short while you disappear from the map. This makes tracking you on the map to attack you via workshop contesting mechanics impossible.
---
If all precautions failed and you are being actively shot at, most of the time your best method of protecting yourself will be vats crit to the head with high damage weapon. Store/fill your crit bar as soon as attacked, good method is to fall back and fill the bar on passing critters.
---
Sneaking makes you imprevious to being targeted by VATS. Its actually more complicated than that and its based around enemy character having awareness of your character (perception against sneak check), but until you come close or they score first hit on you, you won't be targeted in vats while sneaking.
---
If you are not sure you can handle the enemy given how they move and how they shoot, you can't. Retreat.
---
Yeah I think they mentioned that was the reasoning behind letting characters go from advenure to survival despite the outcry to not allow it, I heard it and thought "actually thats a pretty good excuse"
---
Worked for me yesterday
---
I had just fast traveled to my camp and he was there so I didn't notice if they were glowing, just that when I lured him close to them they never fired a shot. I like that he hacked my terminals instead of it being a bug. Thanks
---
Does it take out multiple cores per shot? The reason I use the shotgun is that 3-4 hip fire shots into a console blows up all the cores without having to bother aiming.
---
I live in the Boston area and it was cool when Fallout 4 was released.  However, I never lived in the map zone.  But it was still cool seeing familiar locations through the eyes of Fallout...
---
If you don't like it then you can turn it off.
---
The weight reduction pieces stack additively with each other (eg. 20-&gt;40%), up to 90% maximum.
---
It gets a bit more interesting with weight reduction perks. For chems and food/drink, the armor stacks additively again, but for weapon weight it's the weight after perks that's reduced. Not sure about junk.
---
Yeah, happened to me today at Whitespring. Killed about ten ghouls and when I turned around to pick up the loot there was just nothing there. No blood piles, nothing. Very annoying.
---
Oh yeah, it takes out a whole console in 1-2 bullets, depending where you aim.
---
Yea you may not know how in game vendors work, so dupers also duped steel, stable flux, etc will all those go in massive price hikes?
---
Right? They thought this one out more than was initially realised. Or we're giving them too much credit hahaha
---
I prefer to think they did think it out though, gotta give credit where credit is due
---
Right?
---
Even just to hide small cosmetic issues caused by the CAMP building system.
---
Even if they allowed item for item it doesnt resolve the problem of people having to many caps, which is the understood currency to promote trading of items.   If they allowed for item for item trading there would be no point to the vendors and a lot of wasted programming and server space.  If the decrease the amount of caps found in game, it doesnt remove all the caps that have entered the game, with players using mules to store caps, or accounts to store caps.  Which increases server overhead and cost.
---
Going through the hassle of friending people on a separate network just to message them through a clunky UI isn't enough lol it doesn't connect people in the way an in-game chat UI can
---
What are you talking about? lmao
---
There are no mods unfortunately, I have a bloodied death tambourine also and I’d love to put some spikes, blades or barbs on it lol
---
Yeah its cool to have some special abilities from the crytids
---
That would be awesome. Even plain old grass would be cool.
---
That you got downvoted silly.
---
You could do it with a commando build I suppose... I don't know why you wouldn't want stealth though, you'd just be cheating yourself out of 3× the amount of damage you could be doing.
---
A post a while back with some datamined info on the mods confirmed you can’t get them from scrapping, only playing the event as random drops. That’s why I’ve been farming it for a week straight and I have more than half the available mods now, but there are still elusive ones. 
---
I scrap all my crooks (not the clubs or staffs) and can confirm I’ve never learned a new mod from scrapping a crook. But correct me if I’m wrong anyone, all the info around Free Range seems rather loose!
---
Id try to farm fusion cores at Thunder Mountain. Rarely ever a soul there when I take the workshops
---
Not enough though, the laser gun is nowhere nearly as durable as normal weapons. Better yes, sufficient for big boss fights no. Then you need materials like crystal to repair it. Please Bethesda it needs to last at least 3x longer.
---
You are welcome! Glad I could help.
---
I fast traveled to my CAMP and he was there, lvl 71 and first time I had encountered him, lvl 50 Mythical...what a friggi. bullet sponge since I was farming and only had my western revolver and spike sword
---
Hardcore RP can't really exist without text chat either.
---
I am non-stealth perked but my unyielding armor gives me around 36 agility, allowing me to sneak well. So I have that going for as a bloodied build I guess.
---
Maybe you had the Night King on your server.
---
Uhhh... what?
---
Prove it
---
You....you know you’re in a fallout76 sub, right?
---
Game is very solo-friendly. Think of it as a single player game with not-too-intrusive, often-friendly neighbors. Game mechanics are much closer to fallout 4, but I enjoy 76 much more. Follow the main quest at least through Morgantown airport for all the tutorial-esque quests. Do not, under any circumstance, pay real-world money for items in game, except through the atom shop. Scammers are bad enough on trading Reddit’s and Facebook groups, don’t lose actual money when so many folks are losing caps/good gear.
---
Oh, it's not a big deal. I would appreciate more if you just weren't rude about it for no reason.
---
Have you tried resetting your router and resetting the connection to your PS4?
---
Were you actually suspended?
---
When this happens to me I deposit the tech data into a random container and then pick it up again and eventually the mission will trigger.
---
Dont buy ammo.  Ever.  Make or farm it.
---
Still yell at my gf for this and shes been playing since november.
---
My bad turns out to be perfect for it, it’s right on the road, everything valuable is super hidden and impossible to get to. And it’s perfect for survival mode. I can’t flipping wait
---
Yeah I would imagine it is quite central or they know people take it often ..  these are the survival pussies who can't handle themselves in survival so they prey on pve players. Yes it's part of the game. Take one of the other power plants, I find they less likely to be take back. Also blueprint everything and don't build huge workshops unless you bored. I can setup and be ready to go in under 5 mins, if someone shows up, I jump and just take the next workshop. I use an alt with little or no caps so they get nothing .. or 20 caps for their time and effort ..
---
From the queen for sure. Occasionally level 80 SB also drop them. I got a Prime receiver plan for 10mm SMG.
---
Well since you asked so kindly. Nothing. Nothing has changed. There have been no patches and no additional content. You should stay away.
---
Oh man I get off work in 2 hours :( I still haven't found him. 
---
Good find :)
---
Ok, we get it you're a dick.
---
Is this even a thing anymore? Slap Damage is gone, Camp Damage is gone, and they have Survival to be dicks.
---
Resetting my router was the first thing i did, didnt work.
---
Havent done the resetting with my ps4, didnt know that was possible.
---
How do you do it?
---
"We don't buy a new car when we need an oil change."
---
The car manufacturer is unable to release a "fix" to your car which makes you get less mileage, then charge you for fuel that's slightly more effective.
---
The support team on reddit hardly address any legitimate concerns from the player base, but will comment on how they love certain wired roofing. To be fair, the support team should not be held responsible for the devs mistakes, but they should be held responsible for any lack of communication. Which there has been plenty of in the past.
---
That's hilarious. I forgot to mention grass which was actually the inspiration behind the post. 
---
I was thinking about how nice it'd be to have some grass to plant/carpet of grass to put down outside of my current camp location.
---
Is that Road Leathers and Sack hood with Straps ?
---
&gt;They also could lower the prices of things and make them easier to aquire in game rather than in social media or other trading platforms. For example having bulk springs cost 150 when you can get them 15 per on social media. 
---
Wouldn't keeping the prices the same but having a higher quantity availible also be benificial?
---
For example ultracite if vendors had a lot of ultracite availible even at a higher cost players would be tempted to buy it at the higher cost because of the added convenience factor. Spend an hour or two grinding or spend a bunch of caps. Personally I'd rather spend caps.
---
Shit I'd spend a ton of caps if vendors had stable flux I wouldn't even hesitate.
---
Time=Money
---
I've got a spare one if you're on PC.
---
Otherwise, just keep farming the SBQ. You can't get a prime plan again after you learn it, which increases the chance that you'll eventually get the one you want.
---
You can also find prime plans occasionally on normal scorchbeasts, maybe 1 in 20.
---
In your network settings there's an option called "test connection" or something to that effect. Just click it and let it do it's thing.
---
You should've asked for compensation!
---
Thanks for this, i have been waiting for those skins since the images were datamined.
---
Im not sure what I’m supposed to see?
---
well it shouldnt have, always makes my pet respawn next to my camp thingy when i do this .
---
No. I never drew a weapon the entire time nor had any mutations that would damage them.
---
No worries it will tell you that you cannot pick up more stuff. Even if you have to destroy something, choose a canned dog food or dirty water (mules eat and and drink too) problem solved.
---
Thats from the luck stat right? And you only het that at 50+ or something like that?
---
Honestly dude a comm ban comes from Xbox
---
Because i want to use energy weapons and they can\`t be silenced :(
---
If you want proof I have screenshots.
---
When you say 'spare' do you mean for freeeeee~? 
---
For real though, I'm on PC (sleepyface) and I *want that plan*. WUW?
---
A couple of months ago, I was playing with a team and a 200+ level came and killed all of us, then waited for us to respawn and would kill us immediately.  None of us even got a chance to fight back.  I ended up sending them a message...that I will not repeat here...and got comms banned for 24 hours.  The best thing to do is block them and switch servers.  You were baited. No matter what they did, you're considered in the wrong because you messaged them.  I'm not saying it's right, it's just the way it is.  And these griefers know it. Don't play their game.
---
Yes pz! This is such a long overdue feature and something that any mmo-lite or service game should have.
---
Fast travel back to that location or walk down the road and back again, sometimes I get lucky and things that haven't turned into meatpiles do. This has quite a few times so far.
---
Oh that yeah i also did that, didnt fix anything
---
If you haven’t left the vault when you read this, have your character go into their vault bedroom and nap. After a minute or three it’ll say you’re well rested. Then go take in the world. Being well rested gives you an XP boost. 
---
The main quest is good but I’d spend time with side and event and repeatable quests, too, to get more XP. The later parts of the main quest are better if you’re  higher level.
---
So physical disability is the only reason you shouldn't just use a mic? That's kind of a limiting/gatekeeper attitude. So anyone with shyness/anxiety/minor speech impediments/illness/poor spoken language skills/an environment not conducive to speech (sleeping partners, kids etc)/people who would rather avoid the risk of verbal abuse/or you know anyone who doesn't want to talk because of their own personal preferences, can just suck it because it doesn't fit in with your model of how the game should look? Dude.
---
It doesn't matter if you've had a bad experience with other chat windows in other games, it's not about you. From what I've read on here and experienced myself while playing, the best thing about FO76 is the players, how people help each other out and try to make it a great playing experience, and you want to limit that?
---
Yeah if implemented badly a chat window could suck, but then we'd tell Bethesda it sucked and hopefully they'd fix it, kind of like how they fixed huge areas of the game when we complained before. If they do introduce a chat option, like I and many others seem to want, then it should include an opt out setting, so it wouldn't effect you.
---
Sorry, not sorry. Poseidon seems to be taken more often than the other power plants. I hunt there often.
---
You need fusion cores, I need your caps.
---
The potato
---
I dont think that big sales +25k will happen.  Nothing has been expressed from bethesda what will happen when a player is or has reached the 25k limit.  I think in the short term "big trades" for high end items will still be done on social media because the vendor adds extra steps and as far as we know still cant exceed 25k or 22.5 with the 10%.  Instead a majority players will start vending aid, ammo, junk and other "extras." Legendaries will be scrip'd and the high end ones will still buy/sell in other places.  If 3\* legendaries of all types reach more saturation i can see the vendor being used, but again i dont see it happening in the forseeable future.  Again, the legendary vendor may change this.
---
You said he reported you.   But were you actually suspended for that response?  And by whom?
---
I've been playing this game on a PC up tp level 170s but after returning to game after a short break the lag/stuttering makes the game unplayable.
---
Something happrened I think with one of the last updates that seems to have killed the game for anyone with a lower end system/gpu. Probably BGS got a paycheck from GPU manufacturers to force us to buy the new GPUs that are being released.
---
i5 4670k 4 MHz
---

*Welcome Home!*
---
***Watch out for the ticks, they got a lot bigger***
---
  Right.  I have the plan, but lack violet flux.
---
(BTW, you can use the generic named plan for any PA, not just excavator.  Is what I did for "motion assist servos"  
---
Bought the plan, used same to upgrade torso on both excavator and T60.  Calibrated shock option also shows up for T60)
---
If you don’t consider most of the reasons you list as a disability (not a word to be ashamed of actually) then you’re not really helping the issue but carry on ‘dude’ looking for an argument, I’m listening...
---
Jayce and the Keyboard Warriors!
---
I think once they take it out of beta status, forcing new character creation would make some sense—especially if they do a seasons concept. 
---
In beta status though, I don’t see anything unethical about it, arguably it’s what Bethesda wants for development purposes. They want to see what works and what doesn’t, what weapons or builds are totally out of balance etc. They’re not going to get all that info without letting the crazy OP characters in.
---
And you’re now in violation of the subs rules. Perhaps spend a few moments familiarizing yourself with the rules and searching for relevant information before posting.
---
Oh I see! Then yes, Commando/Bloodied or Heavy Weapons Bloodied is what you want. I have a Bloodied Laser rifle, it's quite powerful!
---
I'm sad that you missed Fasnacht.  OTOH, you never really had to deal with a stash limit of 400 and super heavy bobby pins - so there's that.
---
Oh you meant the little balls of dust not... err... what I chucked at for 30 seconds
---
I'm not really sure how adding a tax for a self contained vending machine is unreasonable. It literally does the social work of trading for you. That's worth a tax. If you want to avoid it, trade the old fashioned way. It actually makes perfect sense that an automated service such as this comes with a fee.
---
No the only environment, game or otherwise it doesn't work in is FO76
---
Sometimes your typewriter behaves badly and needs punishment
---
you had to send him something other then "too scared for survival?" to get an xbox ban you sure you didnt use a cuss word in there somewhere?
---
NOT GRIEFED
---
So it is atom shop?
---
I'd sell for 2k. Queens are hard work these days :P
---
Uhhh...yeah bruh I do understand how in game vendors work.
---
Mutation serums were intended to be an end game cap sink but that never happened because dupers were essentially printing money which resulted in hyperinflation of the in game economy.
---
Vendors don't sell stable flux.
---
Hmm strange did you join there team?
---
The stim pack armor isnt a chance. its a gaurantee it used it when you are at or below 20% health; with a 1min cooldown (iirc)
---
It seems smart-assy, but he’s right. This same question gets asked Soooo often. It’s all available on their site, it would be best to read the week to week changes yourself. It’s a lot to type. Also, there are great answers in comments on similar posts even within the last 12 hrs. The short version, less bugs, quality of live improvements like shared vendor caps, new bugs and glitches, more quests, lots of new camp stuff and outfits... so much new stuff and it’s gonna keep coming out for a while
---
I like it when people try to take it from me and I show up with my .50 TSE I even made a guy leave the server the other night when he kept trying to take it from me lmao.
---
What platform you on?
---
Can do! Message me your user or add me and I'll probs be on around 7PM CST.
---
I think another good question is... What happens when what you buy has a remainder?  Like if you sell 200 5mm and sell it at 1c per and someone only buys 15.
---
My apologies, I didn't explain myself well. 
---
I meant it as a last ditch effort by abandoning the cap system and just embracing a trading economy. "I'll give you my 3 handmades for your one two level action mods". 
---
Obviously, this is not a good solution, but I would still like them to add item for item trading either way. People get scammed too often when trading guns now, but I fully understand what you're getting at.
---
Yes I was. By microsoft

Thank you Mr Wiggles for sharing your pain. Sadly, I am an inhuman monster and I continued the cycle. I couldn't get into their CAMP and their bed, but they had an unguarded punchbowl.

That’s a really cool picture dude, great that he was staring you down!
---
I have a 3* star furious cryolator. Never get any ammo for it so i never played with it much. What is it good for?
---
I mean there's no real reason not to have it. I would appreciate the feature
---
They were just there for me.
---
Its luck but I dont remember what level it unlocks.  I only put it in for crafting then take it out an replace it with bloody mess (15% flat damage buff) when I am not crafting.  30% chance to get double when you craft is TONS of extra food chems and ammo.  Also applies to end game crafting mats like nuked flora.  Pair it with Ammosmith in agi (again only when you are crafting) and you will never run out of bullets.
---
It's very low level enemies at that spawn.
---
Even with a not fully optimIzed bloody build. With just a 1* Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet and a Mish mash of armour....
---
I can run around WV like an absolute maniac. 
---
I started Farming West Tec for steel....  and I'm just mowing down super mutants  like they're nothing. 
---
I can literally stand beside a SB or the Random Sheepsquatch spawns and hack away.... 
---
I've never played a melee build in any other fallout, and only started in 76 to build up an ammo surplus. Now it's my go to.
---
My falliut 76 is drun k can you be home at. Eaght tonight and maked.supper
---
1. First run, do the main quest and low level events in the Forest, Toxic Valley and ash heap to learn the game mechanics, and do a second run, skip the main quest until level 50, so you get good rewards when you do the main quests.
---
2. I play solo and don't PVP; I think it will be more or less disabled in the near future, except for workshop I think.
---
3. If you have real world money to spend, who am I to argue, it is your cash.
---
4. No need to play F4 before; just have a blast with 76.
---
5. I always play solo and join crowd in some events, but I don't team up.
---
6. Do events, Loot/Junk everything especially lead, screws, springs, plastic ... don't hoard, take your time; remember that even if you set your settings to Pacifist, if you take ownership of a public workshop, you will be open to PVP wherever on the map.
---
I managed to get a Megasloth, but I logged in today and it was dead. Is that a common bug?
---
Heh... moth balls
---
I had that happen in the Burrows. Definitely startled me when that ghoul got back up and ghosted through a wall. 
---
I was also getting vanishing corpses. In some cases I *think* they were teleporting back to somewhere else they’d been traveling and them decomposing immediatly, but i had a legendary vanish and i never did find a suprise meat pile with a legendary in it.
---
There is no seperate pve/pvp mode, that's not how Bethesda made the game. Claming a workshop flags you for pvp, don't want pvp then don't claim workshops. Calling people names because you're too stubborn to play within the game's mechanics is just silly
---
Did you read any of my previous comments?
---
Pick up and scrap ALL the fans/hot plates/toy cars you find.

Thanks for helping me keep mind to try snapping ***any*** item to ***any*** object I may
---
not have considered combining / overlaying.  ( or ***didn't think*** ***could*** be done )
---
Everybody is.
---
First ever fight with it yesterday and the body disappears. About 10 people looking for it for 20 minutes with no luck
---
If you had unmarked misc quests it might not show, but you can still deposit them without the notification, I do it all the time
---
1. Main quest would be the best if you don’t want to grind in one location all day. Nuke zones are also a fastest way to. 
---
2. Yes. Technically there is always PVP based on what you do. There are workshops in the game you can claim which initiates PVP if another player contest it. You can also toggle off giving damage to other players or structures in settings under game and toggle pacifist mode on. 
---
3. Technically selling weapons or materials for real money is against bethesda terms and service and you can get banned from the game if they can find your info. I would only buy stuff from sub Reddit‘s and don’t pay real money for anything. Once you grasp the way to get caps you can make good money in caps.  
---
4. You really don’t need to go back to play fallout 4 first. But the game mechanics are very similar but it’s not that hard to learn it. It’s like most FPS and MMO’s games now.
---
5. Yes this game is a solo opportunity play style. I play solo about 90% of the time I play and I’ve played for over 500 hours. But playing with a group can be more fun and helpful. And there is nothing wrong with going solo. It is totally possible.
---
6. For other advice use aid wisely early on. Try to figure out a build you want and stick with. It will take some time to get everything to mix and match. A good build is melee or rifles but will take time to get all the cards for them. 
---
Also if you are on Xbox and need help I am always glad to help people GT is my Reddit name. 
---
Good luck out there in the waste fellow vault dweller!
---
Random.
---
I haven't got it yet but others have from what I've read.
---
I've heard you have better odds turning in 2+ at a time versus one-by-one.
---
Can't confirm that part though.
---
1. The main story isn't that great at telling the main story. I've missed a chunk of it because I found a corpse early on so I've finished the last mission but not a mission part way through.
---
2. Kind of yea. They are still improving this even more every now and again. Just make sure you join adventure mode and enable passive mode after level 5.
---
3. That will get you banned real quick.
---
4. You can skip 4 if you want you won't miss much. But honestly I had more fun solo in 4 than solo in 76.
---
5. Yes you can solo the entire game minus the world bosses (unless you are super great at the game)
---
6. Save your caps to buy stuff you want so don't go wasting them on ammo or healing items. Early levels just use a gun till you run out of ammo than use a different gun while leveling most guns are ok to use. BREAK JUNK DOWN BEFORE TOSSING IT INTO THE STASH. Don't bother with workshops unless you are staying on for a while as they cost caps to take over and you need to defend them but you also lose them when you exit the server.
---
I wasn't meaning it only happens with legendaries, just putting them on the stage because losing them sucked lol. Iv actually had them disappear before even hitting the ground a couple times. Not as often though.
---
Removing the foundation restrictions is a good start.
---
I'd like to see some of the "floating" restrictions removed though.  Like how you can't have a half wall floating without being connected to the floor under it.
---
I plan on turning my camp into a haunted house for the release of player vendors.
---
I generally get around clipping issues by hanging walls off of second level floors. I pretty much sealed my under groundish/under a Beaver dam camp this way.
---

---
IGN is jaj22 as well. I might be busy around then but I should be free an hour or two later.
---
They were always solid if you built for them. But after the buff the 50cal is probably the highest DPS in the game (until they fix armor piercing for energy weapons, anyway). Primed bloody explosive 50cal is the ultimate queenslayer.
---
They're still a bad addition to the game, though. But yeah, they're not shark cards. *yet*.
---
Yes.  It was for like a week.  One would expect they will pull all those limited time sales items back out of the vault again though at some time in the future.  Maybe black Friday or christmas.
---
They are reducing their damage next week though
---
The small concrete defense walls are great for hiding floating objects.
---
You're supposed to do it for humanity. If it was guaranteed good loot it would become the whole game.
---
Pretty sure the BoS events are locked to the questline- distant thunder, the missile camp quests, and defending fort defiance.
---
Welcome fellow Wastelander! I too would like to offer my assistance during your acclamation to Appalachia.  I'm on PC, and I enjoy hanging out and helping beginners (and even veterans) if they need it.  
---
I'm level 135 and most of us Wanderers that are around that level have earned our battle scars and are willing to share our knowledge to keep you looking as Vault-fresh as possible, so don't be afraid to ask for help, advice, etc.  
---
Also, I can't stress this enough....be mindful of IRL items suddenly changing when you see them.  At dinner, you may find yourself asking to pass the adhesive.  Or staring at your fork and knife and wondering if that's enough steel to make that auto pipe pistol.  It'll happen, and when it does, don't despair...embrace it....We are all right there with you.  You are not alone.
---
Welcome and enjoy your Wandering!
---
I hope it’s sooner but that seems like the most likely the case
---
Once I get established I need to get in touch with you!
---
You are 100% and I can't argue that, but we seeing more and more survival players trickle back to Adventure mode .. you just upset because you probably fall in that category .. similar to the players that go around destroying peoples camps. Just because the game allows, doesn't mean you have to play like that .. people don't even take the workshops, they just want camps and junk and to ruin someones day it is that simple.
---
Same with the players that cross the map to kill someone for kicks. If you want to kill someone, there is a mode, so go play it in and leave us PVE players alone ..
---
If you lockpick a locked camp or resource you’ll still get wanted
---
Picking locks..
---
If people wanna PvP they can play survival!
---
So we can split the PvE and PvP player base properly!
---
But they're so ugly lol.
---
Zero mods and new INI files, makes no difference, setting on HIgh, Medium or Low and using Ethernet, stuttering lag in all areas.
---
Second time with new Windows 10 and FO76 install, nothing else running. My rig has not changed, the game has.
---
Regular, sturdy or heavy.
---
workshops
---
Even the see through wire fence might work.
---
"It's one of them flamin' bags again."
---
I will help
---
Take heart in the fact that if they rereleased say the Blackbird Paint it would sell off the hook.  So we may see a lot of the limited edition paints cycle back in and out.
---
I just crafted the same armor and it did not look the same
---
All I know is I somehow have 5 of these kits and I've yet to use one at all.  In the field or at CAMP.  
---
I've never really saw the need for these to begin with, but, meh, that's just me.  If some people use and enjoy them then I'm all for it.  Wish I could hook up with whoever they are and give them mine.
---
Haven't they confirmed they're changing it like next patch? I remember they said they were changing the foundations.
---
There are other ways to get wanted that don't involve ruining someone else's play time.  Bethesda is failing the griefers, and I'm personally OK with that.
---
FWIW, the imposter seems to die in stealth a LOT. If you have the camera, take that out and look around the area. The viewfinder also shows corpses. That is how I found the last 4 of them I took part in killing.
---
great thanks. I'm at top of the world now :)
---
The chances for Four Leaf Clover are 7.5%, 10.5% and 13.5%. There's no dependence on Luck unless it actually changes the GetRandomPercent call (not likely).
---
Luck of the Draw triggers at a rate of 0.2% for the Minigun and Gatling Laser, 0.3% for other automatic weapons and 0.4% for any other weapons.
---
Data mined from the ESM.
---
land mine
---
That's my issue. I like to have my camps have a certain look, and the concrete barriers are just so jarring in more natural/polished builds.
---
men in black power armor looking for screws.
---
Alrighty, so is this 'special gas' the only thing that's going to let the car move? Can you still put regular gas in the car and it performs? When you say unable, does that mean 'our manufacturer quit trying to make a viable working product'? If rather have some involvement than anything. And if you had to hear, day in and day out, how upset people are with a section of your job you have no control over, how much would you love to hear about things that can't be instantaneously fixed at that moment?
---
Mine has been delayed for a few minutes then will throw up the splash screen when I access some random container or vendor etc. Still works for me though.
---
The whole point of the wanted system was to punish jerks for wrecking others experiences. If they aren’t allowed to do that in the first place there isn’t a need for the wanted system anymore. 
---
Turning a-holes into interesting content... that was the goal. It was an experiment and the majority of the player base said they didn’t like it. Time to move on
---
Also ugly. 
---
I use those mostly when I'm building factory/industrial/raider inspired camps. Or if I'm building around a run down existing structure.
---
Hahaha! That gave ME a chuckle. :)
---
How is it a failure? It's just further separating adventure mode and survival to cater differences for PVP desire.
---
Or are you just one of those assholes that grief camps in adventure mode?
---
So you say that explosive shotguns are OP, but then you explain that the mechanic that makes them OP has nothing to do with them being explosive?
---
Well shit. Thanks for the info!
---
LOL
---
At this point its clear that all f76 players want a sp experience with no pvp and no "real" danger
---
Plenty of other ways to become wanted/engage in PVP in Adventure mode.
---
Well done OP lol. Another massive failure.
---
K well with any clever object placement you can create the illusion of things being grounded when they actually aren’t.
---
No.
---
Such is life in fallout
---
1. follow the overseers quest.  It'll keep you more or less in level appropriate areas.  
---
Explore everything.  Then do it again.  (I was still discovering locations in the forest at L40.)
---
2. Go to options and ensure Pacifist mode is enabled.  (It it eliminates one way to open yourself to PvP.)  If you take workshops, you are automatically put in PVP mode regardless of the pacifist setting.  If you "steal" from certain containers, you will get a bounty, and someone will come to kill you.
---
3. Your money, but you don't have to.  Everything you need, you can get in game at no additional cost in real money.  
---
4. not if you dont want to.  If you've played new vegas, then you already know some faction names and understand parts of the backstory.  
---
5. You can play solo.  You can join teams if you want, but it's not mandatory.  You can participate in events without being on a team. 
---
6.  Enjoy the game.  Stay in the forest until level 15/20.  Toxic valley and the west side the divide 20-30.  Ash heap 30-40.  eastern side of the divide and beyond at 40+.  
---
If you become a regular here, try to ignore the negative that creeps in reasonably regularly.
---
[Mothman disliked that.]
---
Pretty sure I still have my 3* Zealots/Explosive/Fire Rate in one of my account stashes (I will need to double check the stats/effects, I am only 100% certain on the Zealot's prefix).
---
If that sounds like something you're looking for, let me know and I can confirm it when I get home!
---
/u/Valseek is the Anti Armor legendary modifier going to work with energy resistance in patch 9? This bug is currently crippling a lot of potential weapon combinations and has been an issue for a long time.
---
Why do you play an MP game guys? Just play a SP game
---
I would LOVE to have a game that gives me everything that I could dream of. Guess what, reality check tech. is recruiting for examples of how disappointment and exceptional entitlement. So, in summation, if you'd like to offer ACTUAL INPUT TO IMPROVE THE GAME, go to the manufactures website, put in your resume and be sure to tell them how many people agree with you on reddit.
---
So you’re telling me the average person with a £300 console (if on a budget) a monthly subscription fee to play online, doesn’t have a mobile phone, Android or IPhone that they can download an app onto to communicate whilst gaming?
---
You see I bring this up because I have a family that is often sleeping whilst I’m happily exploring Appalachia, using my headset and live-streaming the whole experience and I talk quietly because I have self control (something a lot of ‘dudes’ on here should learn), my friend doesn’t use a mic but when he stops on scene I wait for him and a message comes through on an app (wow! Amazing what modern technology can do!)
---
If you can afford a PC you can definitely afford a reasonable headset at £50. And stop using disability as a dirty word as that is a set back to the thousands of people that suffer in most of the examples you gave. You now nothing about myself either so don’t presume you know my views!
---
Good day sir!
---
Hell yeah
---
Well, there's the alien blaster weapon for one. There's also the Flatwoods Monster as mentioned. The only other bit of evidence I know of is a dismembered alien corpse in a locked closet in the basement of the taxidermy shop. That could be fake, but it looks like a Flatwoods monster without his helmet on, so I'm inclined to think it's real.
---
That stuff is insanely hard to place and again really doesnt fit in with any of my camps design. Just a few bushes and rocks would be a lovely addition to the game.
---
cheers bud
---
\+karma
---
lol go play survival and get wrecked, troll.
---
I think a lot of them want an online co-op Fallout experience. The PVP isn’t even good in this game, I feel sorry for people who bought it for that reason alone. Plenty of other games that are better in that department.
---
...With some rocks.
---
I also got a Vault 76 and some other locations missing from the map, so I can't fast travel, but this one really stabbed me in the heart.
---
There’s literally a whole server called survival that will allow you to do all this and more...
---
I believe it was to fix the game's current state?
---
+karma
---
I am a bit of a pvp boss in this game believe it or not...well known
---
Oh I agree rocks bushes terraform would be fantastic.
---
A lot of players just want an Adventure survivalish game with a side of PvP.
---
Not a PVP game they try to dig an adventure survivalist experience out of. 
---
Go play survival if you want more "danger". Except you won't. I know your type. Can't hack it in survival so they go and try to stomp non PvP focused players in adventure
---
My second character is bloodied shotguns with garbage non-PA. I use stealth sometimes but I'm fine with charging around and blasting enemies in the face too. Works best when you have plenty of cover to work with, otherwise you need to keep moving and kill everything as fast as possible. Serendipity helps a lot when you screw up.
---
If you wear PA with Emergency Protocols then it's a cruise. Hard to die even in a queen fight.
---
Oh I won't be online yet. Mayne 1 or 2 hours..
---
I too would love it but hope its not atomic shop related, instead have us find all the bobbleheads and once collected we can use them to build it and if its destroyed we need 1 steel to repair it not the bobble heads themselves lol.
---
Yeah but everyones invisible on the map...action might happen after logging in or within an hour waiting
---
I dont think they would offer anything in large quantity since it is a survival game.  Also they have raised /or high prices of things with unique incentives, targeting card, serum recipes, plans and people still chose to use social media.  I think that even if they did make things avail in large quantities for a high price, i think the ease of just posting up and waitng and hour or less for someone to sell you something they dont want or have extra of becuase of stash limit or whatever people will migrate to social media again.  Its much easier to post on reddit or facebook looking for stable flux and pay 10-20 per maybe even have someone give you some for free.
---
Which is why you're crying about limiting PVP in Adventure mode? 
---
So you can't be a "boss" and stomp non PvP focused players? 
---
Suuuuuurrrrreee
---
Yeah that's what they said. Game will die a horrible death before players ever see this content. EA will make sure of that.
---
A crying shame, I was hyped right up until I played the beta.
---
When the trees start speaking mothman
---
Shards?
---
MP games do not equal PVP.
---
I do play this as single player
---
Why not just play on the survival server? It’s literally exactly what you’re looking for and you can do it today... unless you can’t hack it there due to getting whipped and now taking it out on adventure mode... is that it?
---
Sweet - I usually get home around 4:30est. I will confirm the stats for you and then we can figure out any details!
---
You playin it wrong.
---
I highly doubt this is the case...especially with how much EA sunk into it. Well see down the road. I give it 6 months to a year and it'll have similar return any other game
---
this sub is full of great pics and I'm over here not even remembering what the screen shot key is
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
From what I understand this only applies to having pacifist mode on so it mostly means people who've no interest in pvp can play without it. I'm not seeing that as a failure.
---
Yeah, it’s a throwing weapon like the throwing knives. They’re just the pointy quills that you throw basically. You also get them as a drop from Free Range, I forget what else is required to craft them.
---
nope i'm lvl 350 and still having a great time.
---
😂😂😂
---
I agree item for item trading should be a thing.  They need a seperate box/window in a player to player trade where both players can view the items and a check that both players have to confirm before the transfer happens.
---
I read this as "Yeah, but those survival players are geared for PVP. I need easy non PvP focused targets so I can be a "boss""
---
Thats sad bro. Get help
---
Nice one problem I’m not going to be home saterday so maybe some day Sunday?
---
If some person with a high level approaches you, don't get startled. Use your mic if you have one. They may emote a gift, and if a paper bag appears at their feet, there is usually something useful inside. On the other hand, if somebody is whacking or shooting you for no reason, just ignore them or log off and then back on. Check the overseer's camp every once in awhile as people sometimes put stuff in it to give away. You can of course just play the game while totally avoiding other people if you want (it's a really big map with only two dozen other players on it max).
---
Yeah participate can be good for this Hunter/Hunted challenges.
---
Wait, seriously? Are you saying generic calibrated shocks will work on X-01? I feel like it would have been posted all over this sub if that were true.
---
Seems a few that wanted PvP can’t hack the PvP survival servers so they come back and complain about it on adventure mode when they have a whole server doing exactly what they want... post makes no sense at all...
---
You should read it as another half baked idea by Beth. In first day of survival i made thousands of caps and got thousands in junk lol
---
I hope for Bioware's sake it does. I love their back-catalogue. Unfortunately they seem to have lost their way since the end of last gen.
---
So it’s too hard and you want an easy game?
---
ha lol i guess "bro" but I have a full time job and this is my side hobby so to each his own
---
This has GOT to be fixed with the arrival of player trading stations. How can it not be?
---
No, but people accepting this new modification is encouraging the devs to nerf more features in the search for cash. In car terms, now your tires wear down much faster, but they sell a way to make them last longer. 
---
It was repair kits, soon it will be food storage. What next, gunpowder becoming extremely rare/highly inefficient, but we can sell you new gunpowder that makes ammo just like before.
---
Hence why I said the people who speak to the community shouldn't be held responsible for the devs mistakes but should be held responsible for lack of communication. 
---
Lastly, the community managers are hired to do precisely that, listen day in and day out, how upset people are with the game. That's literally their job. To hear people's opinions on the game (good or bad) and relay the information between company and consumer. It's not our fault they have so many complaints, if they do, people are clearly unhappy with the product.
---
I play in a group. We don't PvP....
---
Am I playing it wrong too? 
---
It seems like you're playing it wrong. Bethesda specifically made a game mode for the type of play you want.... And you're trying to play it in the mode they removed it from....
---
Nice, one problem it’s pretty late where I am now and I’m not going to be home saterday but will some time Sunday or any day after that, message me your gamertag and I’ll add you when I’m online next
---
Valid point, I use PA in large battles, like SBQ and Sheepsquatch. Don't use it much outside of that, but I'm a ranged build so don't get hit that often.
---
You can use them anywhere.
---
Agreed. I'd just like to see some natural camp items. Helps with variety and creativity
---
What took you so long?
---
Where do you see them? I was trying to find them in the Pipboy but couldn't.
---
My turrets targeted him but he wasn't that close to my camp, and while he was staring my direction, he didn't attack me. Not sure why my turrets were all bent out of shape about it.
---
Ok!
---
[Don't be unlucky and... Be a dog](https://youtu.be/bV1YnV3YGgQ)
---
Suuuuuureeeee you did. 
---
You profited heavily from survival, yet are back complaining about limiting PVP in Adventure?
---
Suuuuuurrrrreee bud. 
---
You're 10 ply. Text book 10 ply.
---
Yes they do
---
What platform are you on? If you're on Xbox I could probably make you some things to get started if you want!
---
I disagree. There could be a scenario where we think we have resources but realize we don't so then rather than hunting for resources as well as backing out just to go into a pipboy's item view, we can repair right there and then.
---
I lowered my expectations exponentially when I found out Scrip is untradeable. Lol
---
Can someone explain how I can craft a fixer but have yet to do that quest unless maybe I was gifted the plans
---
Ah, yes, a game in a series that has been historically been single player resulting in the majority of the player base desiring less PVP interaction. Fuck us for wanting to play alone or cooperatively.
---
Troll harder.
---
You can buy gas masks from vendors now
---
I get it , this guy is one of those people too chickensh\*t to go play survival but he wants to PVP
---
No, it's not. They added half of it so they can monitor the interest and set the prices in the legendary vendor of how much scrip anything will cost. Because many have a 6 month backlog of crap they've been holding, the turn in machines are going to get used like crazy in the first 24 hours. In response to that Bethesda is going to make the vendor crazy stupid expensive times 10 because that's how they operate.
---
Exactly! I honestly hope Bethesda adds this feature. It must needed in the high end side of trades.
---
I embarrassed myself last time the event popped up I was right next to the herd and grabbed the shepherds crook and headed out, half dozen lvl 40 glowing wolves popped up. Ran over to take care of these nuisances and... insta-died because I forgot I was leveling an alt and got my lvl 20 something butt stomped in a nanosecond.
---
One higher lvl player showed up shortly after, only to watch disgustedly as the last of the herd expired just as he arrived.
---
Ummmm... heart emoji?
---
That’s weird
---
I stopped due to getting just regular stuff and put them in my stash. Seems the good stuff went fast like the tech data.
---
I switch inbetween modes while i club baby seals and launder an ethiopian prince's money at  the same time im cheating on finals so who am i to say what is or isnt ethical
---
Why not just ignore it?
---
Gracias, papi.  :\*
---
I wasn’t being rude..? You can’t really get a sense of someone’s tone based on text.
---
I apologize if it did.
---
Yes to this 100 times+
---
so game can show you message in this scenario and offer you to use repair kit instead of require to inspect item any damn time
---
yes and those were crazy too
---
Yet you talk about "real danger".....
---
But you don't like the element of playing being tense because PvP could come anytime? 
---
Right. You're bad at PVP and need to be able to set the terms of your "danger" by being able to engage it on your schedule when you're ready and your opponent who is likely not geared for PvP isn't expecting it.
---
De nada. (All i learned in 2 years of Spanish in high school)
---
I found a dog helmet in game that is under “armor” and not for me... Seems likely!
---
That's actually a good solution
---
But to j'cuse them of not listening? Grow up. We see very small subset of data that we relate our experiences to. This development company works with litterly all of the data. Would you rather have paid DLC? Would you rather have a car that has good tires but only gets you to work for 2 months? Are gunpowder, repair kits and 3 star legendaries still in the game or obtainable? If your awnser is yes, you may want to rethink the legitimacy of your argument instead of raising the ole bandwagon flag and cuddling up on that big, warm, familiar crowd-sourced argument armchair.
---
Yes please. I would really like some more natural looking camp additions. I really like the themes they have already but camping really makes me think of being in nature and I would like to bring more nature into my camp. It would also be neat to make little pathways with stones or plants and things like that. 
---
I want a really run down kind of old, beaten looking camp - nothing really spiffy and I think if i could add weeds and the like to my camp it would really help that. 
---
And with your deathclaw comment - being able to build the deathclaw nests or bone piles an the like would be really nice as well.
---
That is literally nowhere near what he said.
---
Oh yea would love us to be more creative, and plus would open a new host of ways to made amazing camps!
---
People do them for plans. If you're on xbone I'll buy them from you
---
Come do pvp. I will give you a 7 seconds start advantage
---
Well you assume wrong. No interest in 76 pvp so i don't take workshops. In my whole 414 hours, checked just for you, i have taken 3 workshops. 
---
What I'm sick of is hearing people complain about pvp when it's their choice to claim workshops and join the pvp side of this game. 
---
You call yourself a pve player but if you claim a workshop then you are joining pvp. There is even a pop-up that makes sure you want to
---
I understand that there are hundreds of minor changes, but I am talking more about huge fundamental changes to gameplay.
---
Are there any plans worth getting? Like armor mods ands stuff like that?
---
I think it’s funny that you can have a huge camp all supported by a set of metal stairs but you can’t place a foundation piece...lol
---
So do you have a tse lever? I’ll give you 23k.  Come on man I need that tse lever......no?   Ok how about that be handmade?   Come on dude you gotta have one on your mule, right?   Legacy weapons?  Sentinel pieces?  Not gonna take caps eh?  Jerk.
---
There's so many almost caves in WV.... A few boulders placed... I'd be in underground heaven
---
I know that picking locks at camps will get you wanted. Also you can put bounties on players that killed you in survival.
---
I heard it's only worth doing Savage Divide and Cranberry Bog maps...but I still do the Mire (since I love exploring that place).
---
Cool. Thanks for the info man
---
The "Not really," "sucks for you," and calling me "silly" seemed pretty rude, but alright.
---
Checked daily for 2 months, got all from med wing but never ever Buffout one appeared.
---
So if someone wants to sell it to me I'll gladly pay 1k caps for it :) (on PC)
---
Shall I tell you what’s really crazy? Living in a world where everyone has the same opinion and no one is allowed to disagree...
---
Think! Before you type...
---
Just the flamer, it sucks.
---
There are some plans I think you can only get from doing treasure maps but from my understanding they're a little bit rare. Get a lot of scrap tho!
---
It gives everyone the chance to get a +40 swing speed knife. Super useful no matter how you look at it. It doesn’t need to be Op.
---
Same problem here. Mission tag stuck at the top of the world. Rose keeps telling me to go for missions -___-. I tried to get back to my steps, previously...like, reading terminals, holotapes....before the bug was triggered but nothing. Main quest and is still bugged since day one ? I'm speechless-------GG Bethesda
---
Interesting, I did not know that.
---
No. He's just making up excuses for the scenario I mentioned. 
---
It has nothing to do with the unpredictable nature of PvP in survival (as he criticized other players for not wanting danger in their game)
---
He wants to be able to pick on non PVP geared targets. When he is ready. When he knows to expect to engage in PvP.
---
yes there are.
---
Heavy metall Armor
---
Try the Raider Leathers underarmor and the sack hood / sack hood with straps - I believe you can get both from the vendors right by rose at the train station / resort.
---
I can remember there being a lot of threads asking for any kind of response from the devs, especially at launch, only to have no response at all. 
---
I cant believe you are trying to justify them nerfing game features to sell a "solution". The fact they said the atom store would be purely cosmetic, yet they sell skins that gave you buffs during certain events, and items to fix your weapons and armour, shows they don't care about going back on their word, and no amount of car analogies is going to change that.
---
bos plans from savage divide
---
power armor plans (incl armor pieces &amp; mods)
---
folks are buying those maps for 30-50 =&gt; not worth selling imo
---
As someone who has played WoW for a long time that doesnt rly uphold when it comes to items for progression or your build. Thats stuff like mounts and cosmetics.
---
I had this happen near my C.A.M.P. a few times with a Gulper spawn nearby. I  would engage them and one would always vanish on death and reappear hanging from the tree spawn point - not 'alive' as it was frozen in place.
---
I have also seen ghouls do this as well. Couldn't interact with the 'corpse' in any way though after killing them until it turned into a meat pile later on.
---
This is exactly what I was wondering. Thank you man
---
Mmmm, ya that is kinda their M.O. 🤔
---
Well, maybe I'll just turn in the few junk pieces *not*  on my mules until the Purveyor arrives, and try not to cause rampant inflation 👍 you make an excellent point
---
Same problem but probably has something to do with the change for all vendors to share same cap pool.
---
So I know this is a different take on the fallout franchise, but it is an RPG franchise. I don't think it is out of character to expect those elements to be included.
---
Alloyed Heavy Metal arm. You can buy heavy metal armor from raider vendors. Scrap enough and sooner or later you’ll learn Alloyed. Has an odd green tint to it.
---
I never knew that.  Great tip!
---
No, he wants consistent action which survival doesn't offer.
---
If your Documents folder is redirected, it won't work. The game's trying to write the file to Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\Photos\\someID\\ and it just cannot. I fought this fight for months and finally had to give up and cancel redirection. As soon as I did that, photos started working again.
---
Heavy metal 🤘
---
They're making it harder for people to grief and "raid" and I am SO down for it. I have been waiting to put my decontamination shower down for the longest time without worrying about it possibly being destroyed. And so long as I'm not hostile with anyone, everything is safe from other players!
---
That's just so foundations can be put in more places. Doesn't change walls at all. I'd love to not need foundations, personally. There are tons of really cool spots I'd like to build but can't.
---
Looks like Predator!
---
hottie patottie!
---
That could be it. Thanks. I'll try it.
---
I can do it for you, or craft you some. Whichever
---
1. Once the quests go in the direction of Whitesprings and Pleasant Valley, it's best to take a break and go exploring unless you're in an empty server. Those areas are normally full of max level enemies.
---
2. Enable pacifist. Don't tune into Hunter vs Hunted. Don't claim workshops. Don't pick locks near workshops. Don't pick locks on other people's supply drops. Don't join teams with players you don't trust, because they may dump a workshop on you and then kill you. If anyone attacks your camp, block them, change servers and hope they don't have a team. The last one should get fixed in the next patch.
---
3. It's against the ToS, I believe. Don't bother anyway, two-star weapons aren't that much better now.
---
Single player actually works a lot better with the quests, but can feel a bit desolate. Some people handle it better than others. I don't mind playing 70-80% solo but I'd quit without some shared experience.
---
I personally believe that everyone should have to create a new character if they want to play on survival. This makes it to where everyone starts with the same shit, and of course as time goes on, you can get better gear and armor to "be the best" and win those fights. I think it would be better if Bethesda enforced all new characters for survival mode
---
I do not believe it effects accuracy when aiming down the sights or hip firing.
---
I never understood a quad on a double barrel.
---
I mean, they wouldn't pay 2k for the guarantee of a random 3 star item.
---
That worked for me, I had to let the cargobot get really close to the ground after it dropped its supplies, before it started to fly away I snapped a picture of it recognized, below the cargobot itself.
---
Same player was on a server I was on, destroying every C.A.M.P on the map until he finally found mine. I had to log out and move to another server. Luckily he only got two walls before my house de-spawned. This was in adventure mode as well.
---
I added Bone Raider to my Excavator, it did not affect the level of any of the parts.
---
Sweet when will you be on ?
---
I was addicted to that slot machine in Borderlands 2, would be awesome to see something like that in fo76
---
It’s actually polished in the photo (the armor is my own lol). It’s legendary 1star and I love the look of the “wing.” I’d like to keep the same look up hopefully get 3 star, probably through trade. 
---
So it’s the “heavy” metal that gives it the wing? It’s not the auto stim effect?
---
Oh! Thank you.
---
Until a few days ago thats where my camp was. You can make a little run through the raider camp killing and collecting all the enemies scrap and weapons and come close to cleaning out raider bot Resins cap stash. Theres also 2 bobblehead spawns, about 5 plan spawns and 2 mod spawns. It also has a power armor spawn that usually has 3 pieces of raider armor on it. Last nice plan I found from there was the locker and resistant lining for raider under armor.
---
Yup for sure lol. Borderlands was a dope game. Got alot of things right.
---
Nice CAMP!
---
Exactly. Only turn in what you absolutely must or find that day. You and I and the handful that sees this or thinks about this will make little difference unfortunately. Majority of players will dump to make room in their stash which is how Bethesda will sell it. The whole time they'll be collecting data in the background to calculate how much scrip even something simple should cost. It'll end up an arm, a leg, and a dozen extras because of the current glut of items in existence. They have to know where to set the goal posts originally to ensure some but as few as possible reach them.
---
So for yesterday's challenge, Vault Tec University Jumpsuit (under armour) didn't count, but for today's, raider themed under armour counts? Both were described as "clothes". Can we please have some consistency :(
---
A handful of caps and the junk items on your person are all you lose from a PvP death, so it really doesn't hurt anything but your pride. 
---
I took workshops all the time when I was low level, and very rarely had a problem. It could happen, but it's not worth worrying about.
---
Asks for name but knows it lol
---
It's the worst in the Burrows.  They turn into meat piles that teleport to the enemy's initial spawn point almost instantly.  Sometimes it's an unlootable, unkillable ghoul twitching in the corner where the meat pile should be.  Sometimes the ghoul you just killed stands back up, walks across thin air and through a solid brick wall.  I'm no expert, but I think there's some issues with the Burrows.....and ghouls in general.  I've had it happen a couple times in the Whitespring, as well.  Ghoul ressurects itself, walks through a wall and across the sky until it's out of sight.
---
Everyone seems to be going for those legacy energy weapons and I can’t wrap my mind as to why they would spend so much for a piece of junk. Aside from being discontinued, there’s no real value to them. I thought about it and I tried my hardest to make the ones I’ve found be worth it. Like a five shot laser or plasma sniper rifle. I did the same for laser. The damage is just so bad lol. Ultracite lasers, regular lasers, mini and Gatling lasers. The only ones that seem to do any damage is plasma. Even at that they are subpar. You know it’s bad when you have a level 50 legendary laser rifle and you can’t one shot a level 5 ghoul at level 300.
---
But everyone follows the trend. First it was cosmetic rare outfits, then legacy weapons, then executioners explosive, now executioners faster fire rate. It’s almost like people are starting to realize that cosmetics do nothing for you and explosive damage is nerfed to the point that it’s not worth investing the points.
---
awesome
---
Lol but I still don’t UNDERSTAND it
---
Yikes, I guess people are really sensitive these days huh?
---
I have a fully decorated 6x6 2 story house with a dock, a big decorated "patio", 5 purifiers, ~20 crops, and 4 missile turrets, and I still have 20% of my budget left. What are you building that's taking up so much budget? Are you sure you don't have anything stored that's eating away at the available build limit?
---
Once again, being sarcastic. I really don't get what your problem is. It's not being sensitive; it's wanting to be able to speak to a stranger on the internet without it turning into subtle hostility. That shit get's annoying, like why not just be nice to people? You don't always have to be sarcastic and rude.
---
WV is a great place to live, I hope you guys have a great experience there, I know I did. They are some of the nicest and most humble people I have ever spent time with abd quite frankly I have missed the people since we moved. Some of the best friends I will ever make are natives.
---
I had this issue as well. I had to add an exception or something in my antivirus to allow Fallout 76 access to save things to the drive. I have Avast, but don't remember the option exactly as it's been a few months. Take a look around your anti virus for something like that.
---
Sorry I can't be much more help than that, but it can possibly give you a start on what to search for in the forums or though Google. I did a search in the subreddit but only saw one post related to it and it just said to shut down your anti virus, which I wouldn't recommend.
---
They are OP. Explosive doess 20% damage for each of the pellets, effectively ~doubling the damage. That 20% damage should be split according to number of pellets. Explosive damage neither gets damage falloff from distance.
---
I’ve gotten power armor plans from the cranberry bogs ones
---
Thanks for the info. A couple static plan spawns that I've found: an armor plan in Watoga on top of a crate in a train car north of the train station, and a camp item plan also in Watoga on top of a dresser in a semi trailer in the northwest part of town. 
---
Does anyone have a comprehensive list going of where to find plans?
---
Very true. I only started holding onto them recently, because I knew the Purveyor was getting closer. Before that I just vendored or dropped junk legendaries because they weren't worth the weight. But I guess a lotta players have been hoarding for months on end and have totally overloaded mules by now (instead of my relatively modest couple hundred lbs).
---
&gt;They are nice, but close range only. 
---
No, explosive damage doesn't have range.
---
Considering the robots are putting all that stuff in there, I imagine it's just their programming to "wash dirty things" and maybe the typewriters got dusty? One robot with a bad command line can account for 90% of Fallout games lol
---
Yep. I need to try that. Thanks.
---
This definitely works. Did it with my bf this morning and I had him wear exactly this
---
Lots of odd stuff found in the appliances to be honest. I always thought that stuff got there either from wastelanders looking to hide stuff they couldn't carry so they could come back later and retrieve it, and from the ghouls as they slowly go crazy and turn to ferals.
---
Crazy robots with faulty programming seem to be a thing now too so those could probably be added to that list as well.
---
He's gonna tell mom and you are in *so* much trouble
---
Sure, but I have no choice if I want fusion cores right ? Not only did Bethesda make it incredibly more difficult to find fusion cores, they secretly nerfed them down to 25% for the ones we do find. I am sure the people taking workshops have little or no interest in them .. if we could avoid them we would ..  in fact I would be happy if they removed the whole PVP aspect completely and gave us better ways to get materials like cores.
---
As an alternative I would be ok if they reduced the requirement to create fusion cores, using 5 pieces of flux to create one core is stupid ... if I can create plasma cores for less materials why not fusion ..
---
This is a good idea, also keep it limited to just camp items.
---
The people at Whitespring wash them, but the rich folks in Watoga just throw them away when they get dirty. They're really common in trash cans there.
---
&gt; Taking choice from players is never a good idea.
---
What if someone chooses that he wants to play in a pvp environment but not in one where he gets instakilled by an overpowered mode-switcher? 
---
Whether Bethesda restricts switching modes or not, at least one player's freedom is going to be affected. 
---
So, the real question is:  Whose freedom (of choice) has more weight - and why?
---
But in all seriousness: binding characters to the mode doesn't really help much either - because it will only be a matter of time until players who spend 40 hours a week in the game end up with vastly superior equipment than the average player... and we'll only find ourselves in the same situation as before. 
---
The proposed "seasons" might be the best solution to this. My suggestion would be to have different kinds of seasons, each with a limited set of perk cards! We could have a melee season and an explosive season, running at the same time, for a month or so. And after that, there could be a heavy weapons season vs a stealth season. So people wouldn't play their characters for hundreds of hours until they are totally min/maxed but they would create new characters in order to see how good they can get within a limited amount of time. Limiting choices CAN be engaging and fun, if done right.
---
He will remember your name.

IDK about X01, I don't have X01.  I do know the "calibrated shocks" and "motion assist servos" plans works to build the mod for both excavator \*and\* T60.

reads (I bolded and starred the text for emphasis):
---
**Calibrated shocks:** \+50 carry weight
---
The most popular mod piece in the game by far, calibrated shocks can add up to a total of 100 pounds of precious carry weight **\*to your choice of power armor\***.

It’s one of the most useful mod piece in this game that requires little to no introduction.

**\*Available for: ALL POWER ARMORS\***

Make sure you buy a really heavy duty weed whacker to keep those strangler vines in check. You don't want to come home and find your house two hundred feet in the air.
---
Keyboards are some of the germiest of places.
---
On my heavy focused melee character, I felt melee was already so powerful I could forgo the mutation for the convenance of more vats head shots. It did _feel_ like regular aiming was more effective after I removed it, it felt most noticeable with pistols over an automatic rifle, but can’t say for sure. I haven’t regretted removing, let’s say.
---
Seriously. Fuck grinding Rivendares deathcharger.
---
And experiment 12-b.
---
Please and the flag one for the team up emote
---
Take my tear-filled karma.
---
They do that to me occasionally. Sometimes, especially with WS ghouls, the body will teleport back to whatever its spawn point was. Not much help when you don't know where it spawned, though.
---
There already is a saluting emote for photos mode. I'm able to salute in my pics and I haven't bought the tricentenntial edition.
---
I agree. It was an escort mission but a nice, short one. It was super ominous, too. I can only imagine how freaked the first person to play it got when they heard the Sheepsquatch call for the first time.
---
OTOH?
---
Yeah, it seems like I missed out big time :(
---
“Looking to the future” emote iirc
---
Really? Maybe its unlocked with a quest i still havent discovered yet. In my game i can find none
---
He just wants all of your lamps brother.
---
I can't find where I originally saw the note about foundation restrictions being removed. It's something like only the first foundation needs to be in a proper placement, right?
---
I'd rather have a President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho skin.
---
I was thinking the same thing last night.  At the least, we need more repeatable daily quests.  Personally I like Free Range and Encryptid as tougher events geared towards strong players.  (no I don't chase away low level players, because it's an open map and if I can't pick up the slack, then I'm not a strong player.  They have just as much right to participate as I do.)  The fact that failure is an option if you're lazy is something I enjoy.
---
I don't particularly enjoy Biv's daily quest, but I just do it anyways because it's something to accomplish when the server is bereft of events.  
---
It seems like on certain servers they all pop up at once, then nothing is happening on the map for a couple hours.  It's not much of a problem if you server hop, but can be a pain if you've got a good team that you don't want to leave.
---
Thats interesting...
---
Is it just me, or is the Mothman fucking jumpscary as hell?
---
I don't think it affects normal aiming. But I have been wrong before!
---
This is such a specialized build though, why shouldn't you be able to do this? You sacrificed all weight saving perks, went all shotgun damage, and you spam VATS crits which means if you tried to use PA you'd blow through so many cores you'd go negative even if you permanently owned all the power plants. So you can't do nuke zones like this unless you stock up on a ton of cores first. This build is a West Tek farmer. Shouldn't it be really good at that?
---
On the other hand, every melee build can do everything in the game with much less resources, and they can use PA the whole time if they want. They might go a little bit slower than this, but not much because you skipped all the loot which artificially increases your clear time. They also still do more dps on bosses.
---
How hard was it to make yourself using 76’s character creation system? I’ve been tempted, but I’m not sure I have the sculpting skills to make a character that genuinely looks like me.
---
Yeah I agree the events could be better timed getting to some of them can be a challenge when they all kick off at the same time.
---
I hope someone manages to get something like Place Everywhere working in 76, without the use of a script extender obviously.
---
I'm on PS4, and I've been offloading pictures I want to keep to a USB drive to make room for all these photo challenges. It kinda sucks that all of the load screen photos now are just pictures of liberators and players pointing miniguns at me because I'm stalking them with a camera.
---
I just spend a TON of caps on plans for my alt and have had no issues getting enough for all 5 :) it my priority in game
---
They could have at least lowered prices of skins and increased chances for good loot. That takes very little man hours to do. But of course if they gave easy access to best loot then people would be done with grind much faster and complain that there is no content.
---
It really is the same issue like with this game - it was released months before it was ready, but who knows if in case of Anthem they would actually work on the game or still sit on their assess eating EA money.
---
Hello there
---
Only issue with wood armour is that it costs ballistic fiber to make it shrouded. Otherwise it's good enough to store
---
I'd settle for a salute tho
---
Once again, it’s hard to really get the tone of a person in text form. Whether the person is trying to be serious or not. When I said those things, in my mind, the intention was not to be hostile and only have a slight jest, that was it, I didn’t think much about it as I’m currently busy with some things and occasionally looking at my phone.
---
But it seems you can’t really grasp that.
---
Omg are you on Xbox? I want to see your haunted house!!
---
It was a free emote released a while back around the time of the road map announcement. It may have just been limited time, I’m not sure. Even if you got it, it disappeared from everyone’s emote selection sometime after release. They announced it would be usable again recently but not sure if its back yet or not, but they’re aware it disappeared
---
You can use rifle stock on handguns and then both pistol and rifle perks will apply, so arguably they have the most perks available. That of course does not make them the best, because you sacrifice other perks if you want to have bigger focus on weapon, but you technically are wrong.
---
It's like the "infinite monkeys typing infinite keyboards" thing. Only with washing machines
---
saved
---
*shrug*    
---
Yes and No.
---
Those who use Power Armor armor (PvE until it's viable in PvP) have gobs and gobs of Ballistic fiber, I've sold it in quantities of 1,000+ to players.
---
Survival pussies? I was on adventure and I wanted hemlock holes for the acid last night, so I took it for myself. I had to kill the pervious owner 3 times and throw No emotes before he moved on. 
---
I’d just like to point out that there’s a difference between actually claiming a workshop from someone and someone exploiting the ws pvp mechanic for easy caps.
---
Well its stupid to get a free emote when somebody paid for it with like 80 dollars.
---
There are way better ways to get materials than workshops. Many examples are in threads on this sub. 
---
You want a purely pve game but that's not what 76 is. It is very easy to avoid the pvp by playing within the mechanics of the game but that seems to be an unpopular opinion on these subs.
---
 Complain and call people names all you want but it won't change the fact that workshops are and will be pvp content
---
Underrated comment
---
Bring me a SHRUBBERY!
---
I agree,  they should put a cap on scrap,  individually,  for example: you can only have 80 waste acid or 50 steel and such
---
and some weed
---
Are you me? That was what my machine was going to sell. I can't wait to free up my chem and plan space. Also serums.
---
You're definitely going to have to find a Brotherhood flag to hang from your porch, adjacent to the Stars and Stripes.

sweet, scrap to bone until further notice! Thanks!
---
OK some people say it's completely RNG, but I always felt that the loot from bosses are bad by design, because there's no way I can get straight ten wood pieces from one single creature, the imposter sheepsquatch, simply by chance, given how small a percentage those wood pieces must represent in the overall loot pool. 
---
Last night when I was crafting ammo the ISS event alert came up, I figured let's see whether they have improved the loot yet, so I headed to the site. Took us less than a few minutes to mow her down. Checked the loot, no surprise, another wood left arm piece. So I fast traveled back to WS station, and saw another high level guy from the event was already at the vendor bot, so I waited. He was done quickly and left, I checked to see what he sold. A legendary wood right arm piece, the only legendary item that bot had at the moment, makes a pair with mine. 
---
Now you can argue it is completely RNG, or you can say he probably went there to sell some junk and that wood piece was from someone else. Totally fine and valid. But all the wood pieces I got from that event suggest that the boss' loot pool is very small and specific.
---
Display cases are coming in a few weeks apparently. They haven’t showed anything yet but I am hoping we get some regular shelves along with the expected glass weapon cases and bobblehead stand.
---
I can grasp that.
---
There's just no need whatsoever to have been rude, even in the slightest. Regardless of whether you meant it, most people would agree that you came across as sarcastic.
---
I believe he responded to me as well, but I don’t see the reply at all now. I was confused, but it seems like all his comments are removed.
---
I've always been a sucker for that Ratty Skirt look.
---
Yeah either he deleted the post or a mod removed along with his comments
---
This is gonna be a under appreciated thread
---
Thank you for explaining the bug that we all understand because they explained it already. When I shoot a SBQ on the ground with mine it deals about 1/8th of their hp, but my buddy can one shot it with his deathclaw gauntlet.
---
That's goals right there. I wish my gf was into gaming, I would love to play with her and visit place like that
---
Display cases are fine, but I’m talking about already in game shelves like the metal shelves and book cases.
---
Of course! I have no idea why, but whenever I read "Gluck" I always mix it up with sugar. Which I believe is "Zucker" right? You think you'd know the language better after almost 4yrs.
---
As a swamp dweller to your SW , WV would have been great for me but too far a commute ( and even further from my beloved beaches having grown up in S.  Fl) 
---
Still harpers ferry is a twice a year visit for me, Berkley Spring at least once a year along with Seneca rocks and 2-3 times to visit my brother in Morgantown ! 
---
Enjoy!!
---
Yeah I don’t think they will ever let us place items where we want like in 4 but bookcases that have pre placed slots or something would be cool.
---
That's going to be such a fun experience. I look forward to it!
---
I love your idea but we should separate something very important here, the progression system, survivor games aren't the best for progression but they are very rewarding in a different way, the difference between a survivor and adventure mode should be critical, one is fun because they are almost no limit to progress and the other is highly restricted at progression time.
---
Here are some ideas of mine:  
---
Legendaries should be VERY FUCKING DIFFICULT TO FIND, not every single fucking event drops between 1-4, make the game hard, enjoyable.
---
Legendaries effects shouldn't affect PvP
---
PvP should be ruled by energy and ballistic armor and armor piercing.
---
VATS OFFLANE.
---
No Names above players, no arrows pointing in the screen where your enemy is, that is friking ridiculously.
---
Camp's cannot be still, you can not place an extremely comfy base, YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE. Stay is an option only if you are not alone and want to fight extremely difficult. It shouldn't be very difficult to develop an algorithm to track players still, people who spend to much time in the same place will be punished being followed by a dense horde of moobs and for sure you can fight them but you will be needing to be very highly qualified for, spending too many resources to gain a reward, this should be the way to obtain some of the high-quality materials and items.  
---
Experience reduced.  
---
Resources should be MASSIVELY cut down.  
---
Loot should be highly reduced  
---
CAMP budget EXTREMELY reduced, increase the number of turrets or defenses by spending levels after level 50  
---
Team play should be required to go through some high-level areas.  
---
Making viable the Rol system in the game.  
---
Perks should be reworked: Concept idea Primary and Secondary Tree.
---
As primary we should find any rol play base build for offensive and defensive (including supporting) mechanics.  
---
As secondary we could choose between different areas, like Hacking and pick lock. Allowing players to access to new and different areas with precise loot, or enabling new fights in dungeons (imagine the burrows with one guy who can open a tube to reach a different area where we could find new lore, different enemies and who knows what) Crafting and repairing, farming and conserving (this could be a very interesting thing with the new backpacks system, and it shouldn't be a problem if you stay away from your crops while they grow up to avoid hordes. Utility and devices creator (engineer) to create repair kits and devices to detect hordes coming to you with a % fail probability, a modus nexus who can allow the player to track other players via modus, googles to track enemies paths. etc..  Doctors who can create more powerful heal supply and allowing to self-heal and others afflictions, creating some chems to avoid tracking, add some extra special points, etc..  
---
Creating some interactions between secondary trees and players, as an example:  
---
Engineers create a device to protect corn from radiation, those players who plant corn should exchange some caps with engineers to maximize efficiency in the farm.  
---
Farmers can craft very helpful meals this means that almost anyone who can find a farmer should be trading some caps for the meals.  
---
As the game should be difficult some things must change and with this reducing the stash limit is the best option. MAKE THE PLAYERS PLAY WITH EACH OTHER.  
---
I don't want to be omnipotent I want to play with friends, I want to rush a dungeon with people and suffer while doing it to get a reward that truly means something (EVEN IF IT IS SOMETHING SMALL like a recipe for a new chem or the plans for a new device for my engineer), making the game not repeatable but interesting to play.
---
I have a similar problem with floors under water. I can’t move it or remove them. I thought if I add another to it then I could remove it but no I just added another unrecoverable piece. I don’t want to rebuild my camp as it took ages to build.
---
I am currently looking for a new camp location cause I have no choice. 😭😭
---
I’d really like to see the service rifle back along with the Chinese Assault rifle
---
I run a plan shop and the shelves work alright to display random camp items (stools, clocks, plants, storage containers, statues, lights, signs, decorations, etc). The way I’ve had my shelves since the Fasnacht Parade really made it seem like a well stocked store of random plans and I love it. Here’s what I’m talking about: https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U
---
But I know what you mean, I’d be nice if we could place more random items or use display shelves.
---
With respect, if you used a "Legacy" (aka Explosive) Laser weapon, and didn't see how OP they are you did something wrong.  
---
This is not an insult, but a statement by someone who's doing mountains of bug reports and balance suggestions.  
---
If you mean standard energy weapons, you are 100% right and the Damage needs to be buffed by atleast another 30% and the durability increased by 50%
---
Marvin
---
an easy solution is to repair a veribot landing pad at a large workshop. Posiden energy plant and graft steel have landing pads.
---
I was really hoping they would introduce something like this with camp decorating because I would love to put out like a bottle of Nuka Cola or decorate my house with the bones of my enemies but it looks like right now we might be restricted to display cases. But I really hope in the future they might give us more decorating options. 
---
What's the point of all these different teddies if I can't show them off in my camp :(
---
That’s good. He seemed to go above and beyond just being a regular internet ass.  
---
His silence is appreciated, either way.

I managed to get a completion for a friend with a Drifter Outfit and sack hood, but I also had road leathers on as underarmor.
---
I used Bloodied weapons but I don’t play at low hp, I just play “normally”, I take hits and usually have around 50% hp mid firefight. At that sort of average, mid combat hp, Bloodied damage is better than anything else, 2shot is only +25%, and everything else is specific creatures. 
---
So I would say, yes, very viable, especially with some unyielding armor (but you don’t need it).
---
There is no question in my mind they will be adding more weapons with the later updates. I just hope they don't forget to release new skins for the older weapons to keep them fresh.
---
The Poseidon Energy plant and Grafton Steel have landing pads.
---
Can’t you repair by clicking on the CAMP itself?  (That is the little thing that expands, the physical object)
---
Mr. Clyde J. Buffington III

I was just talking to my buddy last night about how we haven't experienced any crashes or server boots in weeks. We held a workshop for 36 hours and gave it up when we had to go to bed. Before I'd be lucky to hold it for an hour before getting server booted.
---
Excellent shot!!
---
Glad your enjoying it.
---
I'm level 74 or 78 now and I feel like I am just getting into my groove. I know they said this game will be supported for a very long time, I hope thats true.
---
I've been there all of today and not had a PVP issue.
---
Several people have run thru and waved but no gunfire
---
I'm on Xbox but I would still love this to pieces
---
Yes Zucker means sugar. Well I know many that life for more years and can't even do small talk. If you want someone for writing or a bit playing together let it me know gt: Nasezentaur60
---
Or game wide voice chat
---
At least have a shared stash that spans the entire account.  Doesn't have to be a huge amount, 100 lbs would be plenty (imo).  
---
This way my main can craft for my alt without needing to inconvenience another player to serve as the intermediary.
---
Oh trust me you weren't missing out. You picked up the game at the right time though and I hope for cheap.
---
This is incredibly specific lol
---
That's what I am looking forward to! From what I understand the panhandle isn't exactly as cultural as it gets but I plan to take millions of day trips to familiarize myself with the state. I have been all throughout VA and MD so all I have is to go north and west! 
---
Since I have lived in Germany its been inner city living and while it's been a good time, my wife and I desperately  miss rural/country and slow living. It's really nice to know the people are sweet!
---
Nope, I repaired it. And it just left the wire hanging attached to nothing.
---
Moley Moley Moley Moley Mole.

Since I am a veteran, the neighborhood will probably just assume its some military crap and ignore it! lol
---
Just as long as it doesnt have to be posted to Twitter. I'm to lazy to make an account. Let us post them here and possibly separate the entries by console because I imagine PC will win every time otherwise
---
Yes, no love for the energy guns. What we need is new perk cards like the tank killer perk for energy rifles/guns. And Stabilized for the heavy energy guns.
---
I used the photo mode once to catch a photo of a (dead) scorched in a walking pose... three floors up in mid-air... One of the best pictures I have!
---
It could be a mix of my gear or perks idk. I tested both sets of ballistic and energy with the same amount of perks invested and I just couldn’t find hope on respecializing. Maybe I’m spoiled with my current build. To be fair, I can’t really find anything that matches up to my lever or dcg. I’m assuming it can be OP if it’s something like a Tesla explosive.
---
I watched some people with laser explosive heavy weapons and it still didn’t seem to do as much as the ballistic counterpart. It could be that I’m just seeing people who use them and don’t use them right. I’d love to see them perform. I know heavy weapons get a bonus for wearing power armor. In which I don’t use power armor.
---
It's under the Inspect option.
---
Rufus 
---
Cause you know Kim Possible
---
Last guy who tried that on me went 0-3 and left the server, lol.  He thought he was Billy Badass with his TSE, and Chameleon lol. I keep the cores. . . . and get YOUR Caps, lol. Now go away and toil in Survival.
---
I don't think that would be too bad
---
It's poorly designed. Just because you can do something, doesn't necessarily mean you should or even have to. PVP at workshops is poorly designed and should be removed entirely. I watched the people who took the workshop from me. They had zero interest in the workshop itself and just wanted to pvp. The intention was that you would be able to take workshops off other players so that way if it was claimed but you needed it there was the option of taking it from another player. What's currently happening is that workshops are being treated as pvp arenas. 
---
Look at it this way: You're level 38. Your best weapon is a standard laser gatling. You need Fusion Cores. So you power up poseidon and get the fusion core processor going. At some point, a level 179 comes along, one-shots you, takes your junk, takes over the workshop and proceeds to pvp their buddy because they don't actually require fusion cores or any of the other resources. They just want to do pvp. You now have no choice but to server hop and hope that this doesn't happen again.
---
Oh god yeah I’ve never used twitter and I’m way to lazy to make one now.
---
Indeed.  Their restrictions, presumably put in place to make CAMPs look plausible, did the complete opposite.
---
There is a ton of German heritage in the area too, you guys will feel right at home!
---
Yes I looooooove to lick windows.
---
I'd be walking my dog past your house, nod and say "Paladin...Paladin" to you and your wife if I saw that flag.
---
That's what I named the Radroach that you find wearing the wedding ring and top hat.
---
 I assume that will be part of Patch 9, but I'm not sure of that.
---
Guaca Moley
---
If it does it really isn't noticeable. I can hit targets well out of normal render distance with my long recon gauss extremely accurately
---
The little succulents look really nice on the shelves too!
---
We need a Colonel Gutsy bot in this sub for posts like this.
---
Yeah that happen to me too.
---
No way! Thanks for the heads up.
---
Assuming you are the typical "Blooded Build" using Unyielding etc then you'll be hard pressed to see the benefit until you perked out correctly.   
---
However all perks removed, armor etc, and using equivalent (aka non-bloodied) you will IMMEDIATELY see why people are going crazy for the Legacy lasers.
---
Oooooh kinky lol
---
Yes. Please.
---
Nah. What we have (excluding the pipe rifles) is more advanced then those. I would enjoy more strange wasteland weapons like the Junk Cannon or Ballistic Fists.
---
#MakeTheWastelandWeirdAgain
---
Just wait until the patch. Plasma is supposed to get a 30% boost and yea I’m bloodied. My main is full melee and my alt is an experiment ranged/fist hybrid.
---
I would part with it, I run. With a Vamp triple meathook, and a Vamp Combat knife mostly, but I’m on PC, sorry.
---
you're as cool as cotton socks!
---
NO and I’m very sad we didn’t.
---
Question is... did you say yes?
---
I use a bloodied build that is not stealthy at all and have a ton of fun.  My favorite weapons being the BE minigun and SMG
---
you're allowed to disagree and I am allowed to not like your opinion
---
everyone wins, friend
---
What do you mean OP. I have never won any pvp with explosive energy guns. Because of a few perk card and mutation. You are basically immune to energy and explosive.
---
Way too modern in aesthetics for the genre.
---
 [Miner Miracles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles)  quest.
---
damn  :(
---
Complete the miners miracles quest line and you can craft it
---
You have to craft it. To start the quest read the sign near the Rusty Pick
---
I never thought about doing this.  I just dropped a bunch of plans and now I feel bad.
---
\*sigh\*
---
ah shit.. here we go again..
---
Vendor got pushed back
---
Read the inside the vault articles to get the updated timeframes
---
Okay bro we good now. No more banter. ;)
---
Do you still need this?
---
I want a Fastnacht Halberd
---
No, I don’t think so. Some days I want the challenge of running across the map not knowing if I’m going to encounter something more deadly than a deathclaw, another player- other days I want the security of just pve and knowing I don’t have to lose my caps aid or junk unless I do something foolish. 
---
There’s going to be 3 modes before long and it hasn’t been a year yet. Will there be more? I don’t want to have to start fresh with every new mode.
---
I know the story starts that we are the last one out of the vault because of the party but it sounds like you drank the whole keg yourself.  Enjoy it out there!
---
Look at his profile, his account has been out right suspended.
---
No problem
---
I would love all the guns you listed because that was one issue for fallout 4 was there wasn't much weapon choice compared to 3 and NV.
---
Was this on PC? Just got a free Xbox One copy and if this is what occurs I won’t even install. No time for glitching griefers...
---
Blimey. Usually when I have a workshop it crashes or they close the server. I only take them when my mates online now haha.
---
None of the crashed cargobot random events work. I encountered at least two and the crashed version doesn't even register in the camera.
---
its an issue across all systems, but it seems you have a very persistant problem...
---
since all other games work ok with wifi, then it must be the game itself not your connection or ps4
---
have you tried totally turning the system on and off again?
---
i know that sounds simple but when i couldn't log in on my ps4 i did that and then it worked again
---
hope you get it working!
---
It was indeed on PC. This is the first time I have directly been affected by hackers, but twice in twenty minutes? I'm done for a while.
---
Had a level 22 mirelurk hunter me and my wife named Scuttles since December which just disappeared around February, never been able to tame anything ever since.  Would really appreciate a pm if theres a fix please.
---
full raider armor and a sack hood worked, thanks
---
Or just make them work with energy weapons aswell
---
My buddie made me believe you had to find it and not craft it, but thanks for telling me the location!
---
That nukashine paint is really underrated.  I've seen it a couple times in-game and the Atomic Shop pics don't do it justice.
---
Like just pressing the on button?
---
I'm pretty sure it's the fact that it's heavy, yes.  The heavy versions of Metal Armor limbs have odd spiky bits like that.
---
Wow I will definitely try this.  It has been metal piling lately after a few minutes
---
Kinda someone sent me it and it was ok but i needed to edit it a bit in photoshop but if you have a beter version maybe. I need a photo directly on top
---
If you don't play survival you should be alright.  People can still destroy your camp but if you turn on pacifist mode no players can kill you.  I've also been playing since February on xb1 and never seen anything like this.
---
I personally hate the clipping restrictions because i just want to make a curved wall camp with a flat roof.
---
Also most know but Watoga and The Whitesprings  train stations people deposit plans and such into suitcases for others. Putting the word out.
---
Very nice camp
---
r/fo76bazaar

Once I figure out how to get this garage door to close using this tripwire...

Getcha sneak on.  [I snuck up on a cat today.](https://imgur.com/Wqa64jF)
---
I look around my anti virus and could not find anything . I use AVG internet security.....
---
I was in pacifist mode. You can see it pop up in the corner at one point. The problem is, once he broke my base, my friend shot him with a weapon that should have killed him instantly, so he immediately became engaged with the rest of the team despite my pacifist.
---
One that looks nice and is not too expensive
---
Welcome to the Wasteland.
---
I've been referred to as my partners "slut whore wife" because we were "teaming" :)  You just gotta ignore the fucking grown children that are in this game
---
I killed a Yao Guai from that cliff!
---
Is it not learnable? I thought RNG just hated me. Haven't been able to learn that or the shotgun mod yet.
---
Then the perk card would be to valuable. Perks need balance.
---
This doesn't sound like a hacker, it sounds like your build isnt great and you got beat by someone with far better stuff that was running chameleon.
---
Watch the videos.
---
generators can be put anywhere
---
Ok.  That’s right.   What about the purifiers?
---
Please don't make another space platform.  Just build your camp on the ground.
---
The 1911 is over a hundred years old, and was in fallout new Vegas
---
Camp griefing occurring more since it will be gone in next update and workshops are easy way to force someone to pvp even if you wont try to retain ownership, not to mention you lose more caps if you seek revenge upon 2nd death. The whole pvp system is trash, only advice I can give don't take workshops since they are used by players who attained god roll weapons and armor and you won't stand a chance and don't worry about camp after 7th this month as its patched to be immune to player damage unless you engaged in pvp.
---
Anything like that would be fantastic. It’s funny how people asked to have grass not clip thru floors, and now every time you place a crop down all the foliage around it that used to help it blend in is removed. You can’t place anything on a stump anymore because they auto remove. 
---
I wish we had to ability to scrap the environment manually but that probably won’t happen.
---
I'd like whats usefull about it please enlighten me
---
i need to go ahead and just level up the sneak perk since I have all these extra perks i'm not doing anything with and sneak up on everybody! 
---
get some cute froggie pictures!
---
yeah about 4 days ago i just couldnt seem to log in, it just kept kicking me back to the main menu, (sorry but i cant remember the error it gave me)
---
so i just totally restarted the PS4 and then I could log in
---
last night, however, I was able to log in like normal, but each time i got into the game world it crashed within 10 seconds, again once i totally restarted the ps4, i was able to play again ok
---
i hope it works for you!
---
Not sure 30% will be enough to be honest, but will be curious to see how it works out.   
---
My main is 367, with 165 levels banked (special / perk card choices) so it's easy to respect for testing and get accurate data
---
the water purifiers camp fire glitch was removed. recent testing also shows that rug placing for them was also removed.
---
Don’t be put off, unless you go into survival mode or claim a workshop your character will not be flagged for P.V.P and if you enable pacifist mode then you won’t have to worry about any stray bullets inviting others to P.V.P with you. When you 1st leave the vault it will automatically put you in adventure mode and pacifist mode will automatically be enabled until you reach level 5 then you’ll have a notification to tell you to switch it on if you want. I haven’t watched the vid but you don’t have to glitch to be invisible you just need a stealth boy, the chameleon mutation or a piece of chameleon armour. I also suspect the OP is playing on P.C so you shouldn’t have any problems on Xbox
---
Doing the Todd's work out here today! 
---
That tire armor looks neat!
---
I don't think you can do purifiers like that.
---
See this guy's camp:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/YsYZMYg](https://imgur.com/gallery/YsYZMYg)
---
Op lacks knowledge of the games mechanics please don't take it to heart. Its a great game, ive played 500hrs and never been greifed. Its not even really possible in Adventure mode unless you open yourself up for pvp by claiming workshops or actually initiate it by shooting someone.
---
I’ve not once seen it, so I’m just going to treat it as rare for the time being.  Too risky to scrap.  I did that with a Radium Rifle in the hopes of adding its modification to another, better, Radium Rifle and never saw it again.  A lot of these modifications were lost to the RNG gods when the vendors went from having random plans to static plans.  I miss the days of getting calibrated shocks for the X-01 for less than 800 caps.  Had I known then what I know now, I would have scooped those up and hoarded them.
---
Bloodied heavy weapons build here. Rerolled during this XP weekend. I was skeptical too at first but don't let low hp scare you. Emegency protocols on PA can make you tanky enough. Add lone wanderer, blocker and serendipity and you wont even feel that you are running under 20% hp. For non-PA builds i guess you will need things like Sentinel and Cavalier tho so it might be expensive.
---
I’ve been on the ground since December.  I want to reach for the stars!  It’s gonna be two ladders and a wood box, nothing MC Escher like.  Does this mean your not coming to my shack warming party, skro?
---
I dont even have a camera yet..
---
Lmao to build better roads. What's it matter
---
I understand what you're saying then but why differentiate that if perks like rifleman and gunslinger buff them already aswell as ballistic counterparts? It wouldnt really make sense in that respect
---
Looks like sentinel assassin bullshit. He's jumping to avoid the stagger of the heavy weapons and not lose his OP legendary buffs, his low health means his weapon is a bloodied weapon. You got wrecked be OP gear.
---
That wiki is pretty bad, in my opinion. I’m hoping the fandom fallout wiki gets better, it was the best for FO4.
---
If he had some socks on then it's okay. That means no chromo.
---
Thanks for the advice! I would consider myself to have god weapons though, as I can kill any enemy with my 3\* legendaries far faster than anyone I know or have played with...
---
There’s also a poster to start the quest at Ohio river adventures in the fishing shack on the wall above the tool chest with the pick lock as far as I remember
---
Stopped farming combat armor mods just to get this post up as soon as I saw it, actually, so thank you 😂
---
On The Other Hand
---
I’ve got the same problem and have found no fix.
---
It is a great game. That being said, read the previous comments, and watch the linked videos before spouting your ignorance.
---
I did. Still dont see why you think its a hacker.
---
The first video is hard to tell. Seems like someone with great gear. 
---
But the 2nd video, i can't think of any legit way to regen health like that. You can clearly see him drop to 0 and regen instead of dying, no matter how many times you unload on him.
---
Screech or Stinky
---
Good ol' Stealth Boys
---
That guy was probably loaded up with psychotats and gear for damage resistance
---
Its a combat Handle
---
Same for me
---
Do you really think your opinion is important enough that OP took it into consideration before giving permission?
---
So refresh probably
---
Nibbles?
---
Oke i’ll try it out:)
---
Only the scariest nipple twisting predator
---
side note, best place to farm combat armor mods?
---
Not as tired as I was of the beer quests. 
---
As far as the sheepsquatch kill quest goes - you have to land the killing blow so it's better to hop a random spawn and kill it solo than trying to complete it in an event with 5 other people also trying to do the same.
---
I'm well aware of Bloodied and its power. I have a 3\* Bloodied Gat Plasma. You can watch their health drop to zero several times, and not die.
---
I did, how are they hackers? I stand by what I said.
---
Took me 8-10 shots in the Harper's Ferry Armoury to get the right 'courtyard.' When I see the word courtyard, I think of a central, open space. Usually centered. Not at the armoury though, lol. It's the shitty little patch just past the gate for some reason.
---
lol stinky is a good one
---
My comment was aimed at the person looking to play xb1.  The fact that you were in pacifist is irrelevant to the point I was making for them especially since your group member engaged.
---
r/KuraJay19 don't let him scare you.  I've rarely ever run across griefers on xb1, less than a handful, and if you do just log out and back in and your're done.  What I have run into is many people willing to help you out and give you free plans and gear and aid items.  We are an incredible community and it makes the game so much more fun.  When you start playing, dm me here and I can hook you up with some starter items and stuff to get you going.
---
also in-game we carry a wrist mounted computer at all times, its not very lore-breaking to have a new page in there that allows text messages to specific users, area, or server...
---
love wasn't in the books for him.  He was already dead...but at least he had a toilet to sit on.
---
Seriously. Current survival is hot garbage
---
Ever since they made it 800 it's been fine for me, and I horde like crazy...
---
It could honestly be the same bug the effects mobs hit them with a high powered weapon, games thinks your cheating so undoes the damage. Happens to my TSE harpoon gun all the time.
---
I did mean to say wasteland workshop; wild wasteland was one of my favorite in FONV.
---
I should have done that but after I mastered my atypical bloody build, I started blowing levels on making multi tier cards for when I wanted to switch them out on situation. After that I took all I could from str and agility. In hind sight, I would have saved time and effort if I did what you did after I finished the build.
---
**PvE:**
---
It's an exceptional weapon..  
---
In short you can mod the gun out to be non-automatic but fire as fast as you can click, have nearly zero recoil with exceptionally tight clusters, and with Beam Splitters it benefits from the Shotgun perks (stagger etc, we've tested it).  
---
**PVP:**
---
With the Beam splitter This means it causes a stagger almost every other click, breaking the Sentinel, or Cavaliers if you're in motion.  
---
Bloodied, Vampires, etc are of course top choices but I know people having fun with Furious and Suppressors's.
---
Oh and Purveyor potentially coming out early!! HEK!
---
Todd lied about Purveyor - Down
---
/still gettin those player vending machines/ - hesitant Up
---
Excuse my ignorance but how do you get a chainsaw?
---
Those are your opinions about the game and i mostly agree with them.
---
 Doesn't change the fact that workshops are the pvp content of Fallout 76 and Bethesda wants it that way, they have stated it in patch notes and made it easier to claim workshops awhile back.
---
That level 38 will have to do what we all have to do when running out of ammo...and probably shouldn't be using the highest ammo consuming weapon in the game as their main
---
I did worse than that, too. The reason I started recording the second video is because he let me sit there and spray him point-blank, and he stayed at 0 health for about 50 rounds.
---
That is what's called a bloodied sentinel PvP build.  They're not hacking, just taking advantage of a wildly OP combination of armor and perks that makes them unkillable unless you know the tricks to defeating the build.
---
I'm glad you posted this, because it would be good for Bethesda to see what a mess their PvP system is from a player's perspective, in real time on a real server.  Literally the right combo of gear and stats makes a player look like they're cheating when in reality they're operating within (currently) allowed parameters.
---
Whitesprings is for farming, so follow high levels and tag the legendaries with them so you can get the loot.  Heal them if they go down, or if they seem to be struggling go in and fight.  Or if you see a legendary let folks know and don't kill it by yourself so they can get the loot.
---
It happens.  I'm sorry to hear that.  In the future, try joining a friend on the same server, so you have a way to rejoin it when this happens.
---
On the other hand
---
took me a second lmao
---
It wasn't just me. There was a bunch of others there too. Several has mic's on and confirmed that they wasted a nuke...
---
Btw, two more attempts that day on different servers: One had the same problem, but the other was able to be taken down...
---
Okay dokay, showtime. I've justified, quite thoroughly how we have no idea how difficult it is to create a game on this scale. We have our experiences and the experiences of others who share a distaste for the game. Let's start with the most common response: what if. What if this game turned itself around and tried to live up to countless, snide expectations? What if we stopped playing a game that pissed us off so much and found something else to do? What if we didn't pay for the content we don't like? What happens then? Oh. Jeeze, what if he makes another car analogy. What if you promised your kid the means to go to Harvard but could only afford to pay for a state college? Shit happens, yo. Your delusions of grandeur that dictate a perfectly functional life should be kept in check. Better start coding and publicizing and funding this awesome idea for a game you have, because when it comes out I'm not gonna shit talk the minor things for that either. I'm either going to play the game, move on,  or gladly break down situations into metaphors that self-entitled, egotistical narsisicts can understand and interpret.
---
Thank you, I was playing solo. This is really the first time it’s crashed on me during Scorched Earth.
---
yes.  The scorched queen fell, everyone swarmed to gather her items.  As soon as I rushed her and started looting, my game crashed.
---
Currently just crafting and scrapping them as cheap as I can plus using super duper. If I find a good spot to pick them up, I'll let you know :)
---
I can guarantee you that griefing is *far* more rare than the community makes it out to be. Not to discredit the people that share their bad experiences, it's just that people don't talk about all the times they aren't being griefed, so the impression you get reading stories online makes it seem more common than it is.
---
I think PvP in this game isn't great to begin with, but I've only had two experiences over a couple hundred hours that went beyond that. I'm not saying it won't happen, it's just not close to being frequent enough to avoid the game altogether.
---
You got a point. This game is a F**** mess. But it's so fun to play. I give up... have a meeting with my buddy Biv.
---
Most likely cavalier or sentinel armor mixed with using chems
---
~huh, no green stuff here~
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/LJUmXW5.png](https://i.imgur.com/LJUmXW5.png)
---
Nice template.  Thanks brother.
---
I never place my turrets on the ground. They are elevated and have overlapping fields of fire.  Have not lost a turret to monsters in quite a while.
---
thanks!
---
Same on my system, I think consoles too even.
---
Took 15 shots and taking a workshop in order to get the vertibot shot. 
---
Some of the requirements are absolutely insane. The mirelurk one for example. 
---
I was enjoying them but they do make them ridiculous and crafting film isnt fun when it takes 15 shots per challenge. 
---
I too cant get the VTU courtyard one and gave up. If they wanted camera challenges they should have made them a sixth daily instead and at least have film drop in ammo containers here and there.
---
The stuttering issue is due to a change Bethesda made to the friends list, you likely have to many friends/ pending friend request, clear them out and the stuttering should subside
---
It's like a less dorky version of Trapper armor, so I'm all for this. XD
---
So what's the trick to not dying at 0% health, when being railed by a 50cal at over 160 dmg/shot? I'd really like to learn that one.
---
I'm British time zone but online all hours, would be glad to see you in the shop sometime
---
Haven't had it crash yet, but last SBQ fucked off to the East way out of bounds and got stuck on the mountains. 
---
Fun stuff. About 17 of us standing there disappointed.
---
Or even the word “trading” lol
---
THANK YOU
---
jeez, ive lost multiple legendary bodies to this in the past few days, one 3*.
---
You're the real mysterious savior.
---
I have no friends through here. Just downloaded the Bethesda client for this game. Do you have any other recommendations outside of the friends list?
---
I had to place a spotlight in the area for my turrets to see enemies.
---
I haven't played the game in... a while, months. But from I remember MK1 turrets were little more the decoration for your camp. And they took up so much build space it wasn't worth having them.
---
Off-topic; have you had any issues with Sheepsquatch?
---
This is the main reason I don’t want to start over. I craft constantly and have found tons of rare plans. It took months and was totally random acquiring them. If there’s a part of the game I really don’t want to do again, it’s finding plans. 
---
You can’t even get the limited time stuff (like fashnacht) on a new character.
---
Only good for plans really, and stuff to sell.
---
Hmm it might have armor learn rates like the radium rifle. First tesla I ever had was a lobbing and I thought it was crap. Got it from Uranium Fever. Sold that to a vendor fast. Wasn't till like a month or so later that I started to play around with the other types of teslas and now it is my favorite weapon. So far I've scrapped close to 100 and still only know 3 of the 5 variants. Like I said shotgun and lobbing have eluded me.
---
Uh, probably not? When did I ever say that?
---
And stop being rude, damn.
---
The convenience of them quieted the riot, it seems.
---
Problem still persist, i just moved my C.A.M.P, but the problem was still there. I suppose the range of turrets it's like a "bubble" around them, so, logically, should not make any difference if i put them at the roof or at the ground.
---
They are soooooo lazy to engage the enemies, like blinded randomly. Useless.
---
Do your best to just tag enemies that you can and try not to kill legendaries until people get a hit in! If you see a legendary that no one has noticed yet - get a tag on it and do the wave emote or try to lead it to people :) And try to revive players that go down!
---
I'm prettt weird with my own bed room in real life. It's a personal sanctuary to me, somewhere where I can truly relax without any judgement. In real life I always respect other people's rooms at parties and whatnot because I assume they might feel the same and I'd hate if someone entered my room without permission. I'd guess maybe it just carries over into the game for some. But about the companion part, you're right and I didn't realize until you said it. It really is alot lonelier without the companions, I really wish they'd add some.
---
I still haven't figured out how to win 76 or who I am competing against so I can beat them.
---
Recon sensors is only on x-01. If your on ps4 I have a recon sensor mod for sale
---
Yeah probably. All talk about them has dispersed.
---
Did you actually end up looting it. This used to happen way more in the past. Usually fixed itself if you walked away and came back.
---
Congrats. It's fun, right?
---
It really works ?Which one ?
---
I’m sorry the friends list issue is the only cause of the problem that I’m aware of, I would double check the ingame friends list just to make sure there’s nothing there
---
Yup. Really any train station but the high traffic ones like Watoga and Whitesprings are most likely to be looked for and used. If you really want them going to beginners, overseer’s camp or morgantown airport (or charlestown train station as well) are all high-traffic lowbie areas
---
all you have to do is run towards the other players.  Those legendaries will outrun you anyways!
---
I’m on Xbox that sucks ok well thank you
---
I dont see any evidence of hacking. What I do see is a client/server disagreement where your side registers that you have dealt all that damage before the server reconciles and informs your system. He never took the damage you were dealing due to his gear and build. Hes certainly min/maxed to a degree that makes him an exceptionally tough kill, but I dont see anything outside of the normal game mechanics.
---
Seems you aren't familiar with FO76 PVP.
---
That just seems like he had a dedicated PVP setup.
---
Invisibility via stealthboys or chameleon armor or mutation is critical to block vats.
---
Stacked Sentinel and Assassins outright prevents a player from taking a huge percentage of damage.
---
In PVP power armor is considered non viable when compared to this.
---
The way damage is presented for that protection can also seem a bit strange from the attackers point of view, the health bar will go down as if you did damage, but will return as if they are healing when the reduction from the protection is confirmed.
---
In the second clip the fact that he wasn't moving at all shows he was using sentinel (jumping doesn't cancel sentinel).
---
And him being low health from the get go suggests he was using a bloodied weapon for high damage.
---
Counters to sentinel are high vats Crits, or staggering (since you have heavy weapons this is the way you'd go).
---
Your explosive gattling plasma in your first clip is much less effective if they have Fireproof and dense chest.
---
Your 50cal in your second might be better if you had Stabilized for armor penetration on, but would still need you to stagger them with One Gun army to make any headway.
---
Are you straight out scrapping tesla rifles or have you learned the Tesla rifle plan first? I purchased the plan and have learned the shotgun modification from that. Can’t say I’ve scrapped nearly as many tesla rifles as you have.
---
QQ
---
Todd bless you and your determination! That's why I exclusively hop at Janet's because I've never seen a camp down there yet //knock on wood. But! if you are on Xbox I think I might have a extra coat!
---
Here's what I did: I asked some other player at Watoga train station to help. Gave him the clothes, we went there, took the picture of each other wearing them.
---
They’re too busy winning now I guess? Nah, it was all chicken littles and negative nancies spewing bullshit, probably fed from tabloid youtubers.
---
Some tips:
---
* Bloody is king but that doesn't mean other builds won't work. I have a bloody sniper and a VATS crit commando and they're equally viable.
---
* Melee is next to worthless.
---
* Worry less about DR and more about damage mitigation perks like Fireproof, Dodgy &amp; Serendipity (if bloody).
---
* A chameleon piece of armor does wonders if you want to sneak. 
---
* Fight in a team, running solo is tough at first.
---
* Mutations help a ton, tailor them to your build. 
---
* Armor: I have Assassin's/Sentinel and Assassin's/Cavalier on two characters and they aren't as OP as you would think. I'm running 4 pieces of Assassin's and 1 Chameleon on my latest (4 of which are powered) and I actually prefer it for sneak builds. Working on a Weighless Sentinel set to see how that works. Dense is an important mod because every one runs explosive.
---
* Weapons: Anti Armor and Bloody are both really valuable, Executioner's is next tier but still good. Instigating is garbage. Expect everyone to have an explosive handmade of some type or the new meta is explosive energy weapons. I just acquired a bloody explosive railway rifle and it hits like a truck. I regularly one shot people outside VATS range with it.
---
* A high perception with a high sneak means you surprise people more than you get surprised and starting the fight means winning most of the time.
---
Have only tried it once with the quest provided card, was trying to hold pylons best I could with my bloodied build but wasn't going spectacular. Pretty sure we got it under half way HP but didn't kill it before the timer ran out. 
---
Come across a few of the actual sheepsquatch in the wild, and did the free range, that all went fine.
---
Depends on your build and weapon choice, of course. The point of any game is to have options. If there was always one unequivocally “best” item it would ruin all choice and the game would be very boring very fast.
---
Probably bugged but it's not worth to run grounded on an energy weapon character. Energy weapons are not balanced enough yet for even a -12% reduction.. Try scaly.
---
On the note of houses for sale, we found out yesterday that the real Berkley Springs Castle is [for sale](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/276-Cacapon-Rd_Berkeley-Springs_WV_25411_M42771-54387) right now! 
---
But for real, congrats on the home purchase! I'm excited to see your in-real-life VS in-game photos! West Virginia is, in fact, a very beautiful state.
---
I’m wondering the same thing. I thought it would be where the statue is but the challenge isn’t completing when I take a pic there.
---
I haven’t seen the random encounters yet.. I have done the imposter sheepsquatch with the wonderful Fedora.
---
It wouldn't be the first time Bethesda said something and did something completely different
---
Whoa whoa whoa, this sub is no place for facts and useful advice!
---
Anyone I fail to beat is clearly hacking!
---
Muh roads!
---
I don't know how it's done, but I have seen curved wall CAMPs in the past.
---
If you're killing SBQ to get good legendaries, you're doing it wrong. If you're after legendaries, farm them in burrows or whitesprings. Legendary drop from the SBQ is just a bonus. The only real reason to do it is for plans flux and xp. You shouldn't be killing SBQ for legendary drops.
---
Yes, I am playing on PC. I am well aware of Chameleon and Stealth-boys, as my underarmor (for times I have to leave my PA) are all either Chameleon or Ultralight to prevent cancelling Chameleon. What happens in the videos is essentially that their health drops to zero, I keep shooting them, and they do not die. Thanks for the input though!
---
True but nay to the Glock
---
I feel conflicted on them, I feel like weapons are breaking more often yet being able to carry one weapon and instantly repairing it in the field is nice and already spent 500 atoms on repair kits.
---
You get repair kits when you slay the queen, soooo I’ve already accumulated almost 50, and they are handy as fcuk! I like em
---
I'll have to keep an eye out
---
I'm still on the fence with this one. I'd have to side with OP, even with all that gear. Sure the gear gives them higher dmg resistence so his bullets have less effect. But I can see his health drop to 0 and just regens instead. What piece of armor does that?
---
He’s using the crit only to make manual aiming easier.  I run a bloody/Explosive build but with power armor only. I never use vats and I one tap everything as well.  The crit build doesn’t make this any quicker.  It’s absolutely the explosive splash damage that’s deadly, the pellets critting and adding more procs isn’t much of an issue.  As most suspect they are taking it from 160% damage to 20% in regards to the explosive effect.  I enjoyed playing the OP shotgunner during this time frame and now I’m gonna jump on to the bloody unarmed spec till that specs time is up.  I enjoy min maxing characters, I have nothing against players who don’t like this style.  I’ve read Glorf’s earlier posts and I agree with him regarding the Blocker perk being the strongest mitigation perk in the game.  I also disagree with his love of grenades lol.
---
Elevated rockets are quite good. I tend not to use them though. My camp is in a tunnel with a concrete foundation block as a door 😊
---
Ok i complete just now, need to stay in front of the statue
---
I myself know the utter defeat of server hopping for this coat multiple times only too get met by someones ugly damn camp in the way.      Bullshit
---
Yeah, one of the more commonly requested features is the ability to rejoin last server, just to deal with problems like this.  But in the meantime, the best you can do is make friends and try to have one on whatever server you're on, if you plan to run silos and the SBQ.
---
It doesn't matter I you brake the legendary effects when you can't deal any damage in the first place.
---
It's a server lag issue.  On their end, their health bar is ever so slightly being slivered away.  It's kinda like the phantom damage effect that you get when engaging enemies that are fighting each other or other players.  Your "normal" damage appears, then it just rubberbands back to what the "buffed" state should apply.  Kinda like attacking the SBQ, doing full damage on your own, then all of a sudden it gets cut into slivers when other players join the event.
---
Three round burst Service Rifle please!
---
I have a curved wall camp, but you can not do a flat roof. I had to scrap my whole camp because I placed 1 had a half wall on top of a wall so I could try to do a raised roof. Took me 5 hours. i just want roofs to clip with roofs.
---
Nice copypasta. Consider contributing something useful, like the original commenter? :)
---
I have been meaning to team up with folks but I get carried away walking around and getting distracted..
---
Colin
---
I know! I was running through charleston the other day and we walked by and my friend was like "Wow this would make a nice spot for a camp!" and I immediately was like "NO!" do n o t
---
Vampire ffr rifles are hot right now for this reason
---
Are you on Ps4? Ive got a simple, but perfect set up I can show you.
---
I don't use a tripwire, I use keypad entey and pressure plates, but I'm sure I could implement a tripwire somehow.
---
Of course! I’ll add you bud! The more the merrier.
---
Thanks! I was taking the picture while facing the statue. Got it now!
---
Look up the definition of griefing.
---
It’s a sad day, different platform good buddy :(
---
Yep. It'll disappear right in front of me. There will be a blood spatter where the corpse _was_.
---
They honestly need to ban camps from being in an area that has a random spawn.
---
I’m not about to complain before it even gets here, it was dismal before. Acid is so useful tho, if they reduced the acid cost just a fraction next time, I think 20 would be fine (after ammosmith and sd). 5 acid 5 oil 2 steel? That’s manageable.
---
This was my first thought. I'm going to spend more time looking at camps than buying anything lol.
---
They have essentially eliminated the need for junk to repair if you kill enough queens. I have 14 sitting in my inventory right now and top off weapons as soon as they hit 99% 
---
They are a bad addition because they remove need for repair junk. Would be better if you had to craft them.
---
Also if you are buying them you have issues with how easy they are to get in bulk in the game
---
Thanks for the input. I do have stabilized, and the .50  is 3\* Furious.
---
He had full copyright of the pic, asking for compensation when it's going to be used by a company for a marketing campaign to make money is not a bad move.
---
Thank you for explaining, I wad having a hard time trying to convince these guys.
---
When someone (unsolicited) tries to steal your shit, and you beat them into submission? Yes, lol. Yes, it is. I'll share my shit, but not if you try to steal it and kill me first lol.
---
sentinel and cavalier gear.  Both of these players are using sentinel.  You can tell because they refuse to move aside from jumping in place.  Each piece of sentinel armor "-15% damage when standing and not moving" and all 5 pieces stack.  Add in Assassin primary effects "-8% damage vs other players" and PvP damage is reduced to almost nothing.  Pop in Nerd Rage and Serendipity and a low health build is basically unkillable.
---
Negative ghostrider
---
Some people hang out around unclaimed workshops, waiting to kill anyone that claims them.  It's not griefing...it's how the game is played.  Now, if they come to your camp and knock down the door (adventure mode) just to kill you...then yeah.
---
Missle turrets are my goto. I put them ontop of my water purifiers. The angle is tricky to get them to place, and sometimes you need to be at the same height as where you're trying to place it.
---
The missles are loud, but the ragdoll physics and damage output are worth it.
---
I bought the plan aye. I make and scrap them. As well as scrapping the random ones I come across. RNG just really doesn't like me.  :-(
---
Yea, eventually it will switch to that. But the camera can help find it too.
---
The sub expires topics no matter how much buzz they create. The posts were still alive and well as they sunk.
---
Check the receiver mods you have for both Handmade and Assault rifles. You have a Prime available for one of them if you can make Ultracite 5.56. That is unless I'm forgetting a 3rd gun that uses 5.56.
---
Here's the gist of it.
---
Each region has it's natural level range for things that spawn inside it, for example the forest is 1-15, cranberry bog is 35+
---
This creates a array of plans that are available for weapons, armor, and other plans, with weapons like the minigun that only spawn at level 35 minimum only being available from regions with that level as an option. This makes cranberry bog the most valuable area to get maps for, followed by the mire, savage divide, ash heap, toxic valley, and finally the forest. 
---
In addition each region has a set of rules for which power armor can spawn plans in that region, with the forest not being able to spawn power armor plans altogether, and each region having it's own sets.
---
The interplay between these two causes the savage divide to be more profitable than the mire, as the mire can spawn a few more high level items, but only spawns T-45 power armor plans, meaning the odds of acquiring power armor plans is very low, and not very valuable. While the savage divide can spawn raider, t-45, and t-51 plans, while having a narrower overall range of items, meaning you are much more likely to get high value power armor plans. Cranberry bog has value as the only region that can spawn t-60 plans, but also has a very high amount of high level plans available, while not spawning lower end plans.
---
The ash heap is the only region that spawns excavator, and maps for that region are fairly rare due to only having 2 map sites, while other regions have up to a dozen.
---
Overall, outside the forest the chance of getting power armor plans gives maps a decent value, even though these plans are extremely rare.
---
Are you running any other programs? Do you have more than 1 display hooked up to your GPU?
---
Part of it is a display bug between client side and server side damage resolution. 
---
A full sentinel/assassin build has something like 97% damage resistance (not armor, straight % damage resistance, which comes before armor) and a low-health version also has 45% avoidance. Your client-side damage bar doesn’t always account for all of that, so on your end your client “thinks” you did 100 damage to them, but then the server processed the combat formulas and comes back with “you did 0 or 1 damage” and the client re-displays the health bar with the correct values.
---
If your running the max stacked drugs, with group strange in numbers Empath with assassin's + (Cav/Sent) fireproof + Dense etc, you have little to fear from anyone who's not criticaling you,  but stagger apparently can be caused even when dealing less than a point of damage and not everyone, in fact most people don't have the min-maxed combo fully kitted out
---
I..... I honestly do not have an answer for this one but I'm just really happy you posted this haha!
---
Except they would just say no and probably replicate it lol
---
I own vampire heavies as well :\\ They don't ever seem to give me more than like 10 health per hit, and it's over time.
---
I have to admit i have seen some pretty cool camps there but why, do they not know what they are doing
---
Turrets are useless really, even after they buffed them.
---
Scorchbeasts lay waste to all
---
Perfect ;)
---
Much has changed but they are still garbage
---
Don’t bother with Grounded, at least for PvE. Energy damage sources in PvE are negligible, the downsides to Grounded are *not* worth 100 energy resist
---
Great photo!  And the comments on this thread are killing me
---
That is just crazy...wonder if coincidence or as intended?  If it was coincidence I think I would have peed myself.
---
Yes, absolutely.  
---
Also power armor, since it can't be legendary is also incredibly weak against PvP players that can lay down 1000's of damage in seconds.  It's no problem to VATS crit everyone with high percentage headshots on a maxed Ag/Per/Luck build and the right perks.
---
Fully agree!
---
It's ridiculous that anyone playing frequently still doesn't have this quest, though that hurts a little extra.
---
Wow congrats and condolences at the same time!
---
personally i really think they don't - i am sure that some people do but the majority probably just don't realize -they see a nice watered / flat spot and think *jackpot* 
---
i know i was messing with a guys camp last night that was sat on a random spawn while I was trying to get a new pet and i ended up messaging him- and he just didn't know it was a spawn point.
---
Yes i understand that. Exactly what i said/meant, in far fewer words. I'm not questioning that his gun does less damage. I'm questioning player dropping to 0 and then regen. 
---
Someone in a later comment explained it. It can all be attributed to lag in how the server processes damage. Attacker sees health drop to 0 because that is prior to taking into account the armor buffs the enemy has. Once server registers the attack and takes into account the buff, it recalculates the health drop and makes it appear as if regen.
---
You're talking about Sentinel build with Serendipity, right? I could see how that would help. But he let me spray him point-blank before he killed me the first time, almost like he was mocking me.
---
this is soooo good
---
Perfect
---
That, sir, was NOT the question.
---
You should have seen the look on my wife’s face when I recommended the castle! I can’t wait to upload. We will be traveling as soon as we stabilize.
---
Thanks! I'm still gonna use it I guess, just need to respec a bit.
---
The emote is from Enclave's quest
---
R91, Service Rifle, and Chinese Assault Rifle would be great
---
hold up.  I haven't found the tourist yet.  I would've assumed it was a skeleton.  It's a recently deceased human NPC?
---
What I cant believe is that you would get so mad but not stop and change servers. Instead you cry on Reddit and quit the game lol. Id hate to see how you would react to gta online.
---
That's good to hear. There is some hypocrisy floating around this sub, however. When the defender is victorious, PVP is fun. When the attacker is victorious, he is seen as a griefing asshole.
---
"our workshop"
---
Youdundiditandscreweduprighthereboi
---
It'll still kick ass....just not as much, I'd guess. They we're really talking about fixing the stats more than really nerfing it again, I believe.
---
Agreed. I wouldn’t mind a luger or a 9mm like Benny had (it was called Maria I think)
---
Weight reduction perks in my opinion
---
Get level 3 power user, it turns a 500 round core into a 1000 round core.
---
That would be nice information to have in game. Thank you. Any idea if final weight is calculated into that or if it's determined in bench, meaning does 90% reduced weight affect help?
---
Duecehead?
---
I'm assuming that's going to be an outfit, and not armor? Only shows one arm covered.
---
I know and I'm on almost every day, and at least one time per login I visit some of the spots...
---
The comment I replied too has everything you need to solve your ignorance problem. The only thing left to add was sarcasm.
---
It's not an issue with you being weak.  It's an issue of broken game mechanics being min/maxed against you.  Survival servers, and PvP in general, are a red hot mess.  Something is wrong if players in power armor are shredded in two hits by a guy with 19% health in conventional armor with a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Sentinel in my opinion
---
This, Bethesda really needs to fix this nonsense for the health of the game. PVP is so broken
---
Why waste ammo in places west of the savage divide? Low level ghouls and mole rats are a nuisance but move fast. Everyone’s lost half a clip trying to kill a mole rat chewing your ankles and spinning in circles around you. A light quick melee weapon at hand saves you a lot. 
---
It’s only the second max level +40ss knife I’ve obtained in all my playtime too. It’s not like they’re falling out of the woodwork.
---
Yeah... That kinda fucks u up... But it makes sense
---
AA alone is a great asset.
---
Touche. Human nature I guess. Everyone likes to see the bully get there comeuppance.  I don't generally PvP of my own volition, but I've come to accept the fact that it's best to be geared/prepared for it. Especially when running a workshop.
---
there's a difference between griefing and pvp - when you claim a workshop you do open yourself up to PVP - perhaps it would be wise to find a team of high level players to help you with a workshop - or buy cores from players until you're high enough to defend yourself?
---
If you have marsupial and speed demon mutations, should have no problem solo.
---
Oh I thought the other guy was the OP haha I would have jumped on if I'd seen this in time though. You have a raider outfit for today's challenge?
---
Fuck no.  I'm sure it'd shit out a ton of annoying liberators to fight you. I hate fighting those things.  The chinese propoganda, fast movement...screw them.
---
Just had a look and went through frame by frame and his health bar goes down to zero but then jumps back up a little bit and he stays alive then long enough to get the kill shot, looks like the jump you get with legendary enemies when they regain their bar but I’m wondering if this might be something odd going on with serendipity or something and visually he looks like he’s going to zero but serendipity has kicked in preventing damage being taken but the visuals are not matching up and then the game catches up and his health increases a fraction on the bar. (All speculation) but I would def send a support ticket in to Bethesda because of the fluctuating health bar and because you’ve got a good clip of it happening.
---
No thanks, I don’t want anymore clutter on the HUD. also why do you think the HUD is so simplistic already? It’s Bethesda’s way of promoting immersion and they aren’t going to drop it or throw a bunch of clutter on there any time soon, especially for something like this you can check in 1 second by popping up your radial menu and hovering over the weapon.
---
Are there not better things that could be done with dev time anyway? 
---
All the people make all of these suggestion posts need to realize there are literally hundreds of bugs plaguing this game and those are definitely more important than all these bullshit requests.
---
Having the text chat be optional to only show on a pipboy menu for me would be preferred. I would personally only use it to trade. However I agree as a whole that the game could benefit from text chat so long as the user could hide it away if unwanted. Last thing I need is chat clogging up my view of the wasteland of pinging me with alerts. 
---
I would also suggest a private message system via pipboys. To just send a message to a single person not the whole server. Perhaps a quest going to radio towers to enable the function. Just my 2 caps.
---
Check Modus...I see the recon sensor there pretty frequently.
---
I know itll never be implemented for lore purposes and obviously not in creation club because bethesda likes to dash my dreams but I would LOVE to see a modern model of the Autoaxe or Man-Opener. 
---
Been waiting for it to come out for Fallout 4 to start a new playthrough but oh well
---
Hell no lol
---
Yes this is common for me during laggy servers
---
They just convert to meat piles very quickly. I use a mod that makes them a little brighter and easier to spot after they become a pile.
---
I'd go and kill sentrybots if you have the weapon to do it. One clip from my handmade takes out a lvl 61. There's a consistent spawn north of whitesprings, just past the train yard. Guaranteed fusion core(s).
---
The best defense is a good offense.
---
Maria was such a sweet gun
---
Could even make a guest to get a local antenna working which would unlock the text chat for you or something.
---
What's that power armour skin there? Is there another new one out?
---
And so what? At least you tried, what do you have to lose? No recognition on Twitter for a video game pic? It's worth the effort to at least try to get atoms or something.
---
People downvoting me seriously make no sense.
---
You either need a second account or a friend.
---
 I used my stepdaughter's account when I got my long coat.
---
Once you find the vendor  You can hold it with your secondary account and keep logging in-and-out of your primary account and the bots inventory will change each time. 
---
Only downside of that is the bot just randomly dies a lot for no reason.
---
I'll sell ya some! I have a bunch of extras. Add me Molowa
---
What taxidermy place?
---
Id say they need that boost to do good, but probably ran into a rng
---
I do wish there was a robot boss that deployed mini bots like the Eyebots or Liberators out of its own body. The adds in the Impostor Sheepsquatch fight kinda fill that role, anyway.
---
Won the lottery bro!

That radroach already has a name and it's Roachie. Not the most original, I know, but I didn't come up with it.

I'd like to see an M1 in .308. The ca-ching when the clip ejects would be pretty cool. Of course the reload animation would never be right. :-)
---
Vault Tec University. where the giant vault boy statue is. around the area of Biv's Cellar
---
I really think they will eventually, they need to keep the interest in drip enough to keep people playing for the next 5 years
---
He's gonna put "recognized on a Twitter pic by Bethesda" on his resume
---
Power armor and pacifist mode aren't great for pvp you know, quite useless in fact. I'm also not sure why you'd say someone is griefing on survival. It's survival. I don't disagree that some gear is pretty unbalanced but using it isn't a reportable offense. Also, you could have just shot them with a gamma gun but hey ho.
---
At that point though, you've turned it into a rifle, not a pistol. If the point is to make an actual pistol build, there's not a lot there to boost it.
---
I think there’s a poster to start the quest at Charleston Fire Station, on the bulletin board in the garage.

Downclock cpu, downclock gpu, and load game off a 5400rpm hard drive. Should make for a miserable enough loading experience to accomplish what you want.

i guess I must be the luckiest guy with a camera in the Wasteland. Walked into the Vault-Tec University court yard, took one picture of the main building from there and bammm!  Done! Went to the Glassed Cavern, dragged a king to the corpses of the Queen and Hunter, bammm! Done! First picture of a Vertibird at Posidon worked too. I also learned you don't have to claim the workshop to repair the landing pad.  Not sure if I am doing something differently, but... it works great for me. I am on PC, not sure if the camera code might be more buggy on consoles?
---
In that case, I can't wait for CAMP damage to be removed because this was all in adventure. I don't play Survival because I'm a COOP junkie :\\
---
Yup I don’t know why this is happening but it is. Seen my teammate do it twice. Almost did it myself. Something about switching tabs and pressing to fast?
---
I notice the weapon and armor workbenches producing some weird effects when I enter Craft and switch to Modify. I have armor show up in the weapon bench, switch again and it’s gone.
---
This.  I believe it faces Mama Dolces.
---
Digger
---
the floor one works better then the wall mounted one. wall one seems like trash comparatively.
---
The workshop tells you that PvP is possible and to be ready for it. If you cannot deal with PvP or other players taking your workshop, as is intended by the game, don't take a workshop. As long as the fighting is confined to the PvP area of the workshop it is not griefing.
---
Just more bosses in general would be great!
---
I’m on PS4, not sure if that would make a difference.
---
Unless they raise the caps limit, there won't be anything good for sale.
---
The players with the most items worth buying are at the cap limit.
---
I live in P.A but don’t take power plants as I’m not into P.V.P, I just get them in the wild from P.A chassis and fusion core generators like the one on the nuka plant roof, 2 at Camden park, one behind the shed out the front of mama dolce etc, YouTube has videos of P.A chassis locations too. The P.A ones are only 25% but I’d rather that than be watching over my shoulder for a P.V.P enthusiast lol. If I’m ever desperate il just craft one but you need stable flux for that so it’s a last resort.
---
why let machines kill scorch beasts, when you can strangle them with your bare hands?
---
&gt;!or if they do not land, just use a gun and play a game of duck hunt!&lt;
---
Soo as you say i go close to big als tatoo and then face mama dolce?
---
im fairly high but definitely cant defend myself against someone with a pvp build, they just fast travel to me, kill me a few times for junk and caps until I leave the server. Every time
---
EDIT 4: This IS adventure mode.
---
If you go to the alien crash site, one of the doors is able to be opened but inaccessible. I'm hoping that in the coming patches there will be a cool quest with some type of alien vibe, and that the alien blaster will come in handy/get a boost then. Who knows
---
Oh, I'm sure he was.  Just to show how great he is at farming/buying gear and copying a meta build that every other player and their mom is using in survival mode.
---
Move back to adventure mode.  It's much easier on your constitution.  I fast traveled to a couple this morning for the "take pictures of other players weekly challenge" and helped them out with a bunch of building materials after hearing the husband/boyfriend ask for more wood from his ladyfriend over area chat.  They were both kinda low level and I felt bad for them, especially after the woman was in area chat saying "hey babe there's a lvl 200 guy in our garden, what should I do?"  I gave them like 100 wood, 100 steel, 50 concrete and whatever random scrap I had on me after asking to take their picture.  I also offered to dope myself up on chems and booze while naked to help with their challenge, or put on VTU gear so they could take a picture of me at the University, but they hadn't gotten the camera yet.  They were grateful for the scrap and I just carried on with my day.
---
just fast travel to VTU.
---
Nah man, I’m talking about a giant 50 foot liberator that tripods around and tries to shoot you with it’s massive laser cannon
---
thanks but maybe next time. Now that I have nothing left to lose I can just sit through the harassment..
---
90% of stars at any of the three slots are garbage
---
Some like beserkers ruin the entire weapon outright no matter how good the other two stars are.
---
Most are just not good enough, assassins +8% to players is just trash and might as well not be on the weapon at all as it gets outclassed by several others at the only thing it tries to do.
---
some are weapon specific, instigating is good on one shot kill type weapons, but meaningless on bullet hoses.
---
Then there are a few, anti armor, explosive, power attack, swing speed, that are just broken and outclass everything else they compete with on any weapon they are attached to.
---
Armor is less imbalanced than weapons, most legendries aren't too big a deal good or bad, it's just that they stack with themselves, so some like sentinels get busted when you complete the whole set. 15%damage reduction when standing still is alright, 75% is increadible.
---
Recently, I saw the Nuka-Quantum hat in the Atom Store and one of the photo examples was a player posing by a skeleton on an amusement park ride, holding a camera.   So of course, I spend a bunch of time and caps traveling around to various parks.   Finally found the skeleton holding a camera....   nothing happens!   sheeeiiiitt!!   
---
at least now, I know what to look for.  thanks!
---
Is there a place where they always spawn in the wild? I’ve found 2 of them east of Watoga randomly, but I’m just as likely to find a Mireluk Queen or a stealthed assaultron in that area, it seems to be random.  Hitting a sheepsquatch that ends up dying should be enough. The game knows you participated in killing it as it gives you XP, not sure why they would design the challenge to require you to land the killing blow.
---
Hey I just started a tread about that variant... [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bkckvj/questions\_about\_lobbing\_tesla\_rifles/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bkckvj/questions_about_lobbing_tesla_rifles/)
---
If you get a chance see if you can answer any of these questions for me please. I'll stop derailing your thread here.  :-)
---
Could you send me a picture of that  of yours ? im taking pictures everywhere on that position but it doesnt count :(
---
Molemeat
---
Considering that AAE is a highly sought after combo on any weapon, no matter what happens with the patch, this drop is awesome. Congrats!
---
Classic 10mm pistol from fo3
---
Anglers drop asbestos and adhesive. But ballistic fiber from vendors, it’s cheap enough, if you come up dry because everyone got to the various farming spots before you.
---
Watch the butt, two layers of the armor separate and one moves like a stubby tail while the other layer acts normally.
---
speed demon mutation will help you move a bit faster, maybe enough of a boost to get in there?
---
are you taking a picture of a player (not you) VTU clothing in the area?
---
That's why I'm not even going to do this quest until they add storage or other options.  I am not deleting my photos just for challenges.
---
Haha I'm sorry to hear that you have nothing left to lose but in case you need anything I sell a ton of materials and other supplies
---
Level 103! I just like taking pictures of naked mole rats in Appalachia!!!
---
Shit, I’m tired. Just misread that as giant vibrator boss.
---
wa-wah-wee-wah! great drop!
---
Today a guy didn't even let me tag a 3 star on the uranium fever event because of his greed and TSE shotgun :(
---
You can’t become immune to the explosive lasers, hell some of their damage even goes through sentinel without you being staggered. Explosive lasers are becoming meta in PvP for a reason, and you won’t survive more than a few seconds from someone with a quality explosive laser.
---
I can tell you all firsthand I’ve gotten 500+ kills in survival just with my explosive laser.
---
Player vending will flop if the caps limit isn't raised. All the players with legendaries worth buying are already at the cap limit and wont be selling them.
---
I have one, and I haven't noticed much of a difference from a regular barrel. It just leaves a small area of lightning.
---
You have speed demon? I haven't tried getting into vendor, but typically sprinting with speed demon mutation i find i get to where I'm going before everything finishes loading. However I'm on ps4, so may not be an issue on pc.
---
Yup. Sentinel&amp;assassin is 85% reduction by itself, add in perks like Dodgy, and Lone Wanderer (if solo) or shared Empath mutation from a teammate (if grouped) and you get pretty damn close to 97% reduction. 
---
And yup, the Serendipity is the 45% avoidance. 
---
And yeah, most of the people with those sets are hardcore pvpers... who tend to be a little douchey. Also Sentinel only works if you aren’t moving.
---
If you ever find the bot, have a friend hold it while you restart the game to refresh the bots inventory
---
Just what I wanted  to hear. Will give the game a try
---
No idea what that means.

Put pacifist mode on so if you are shooting to get hits in you don't initiate pvp by mistake!
---
Wasn't trying to be condescending.  I was just trying to answer your last question while assuming you were familiar with the way the servers analyze and transmit data back to you.  You got it exactly right with that comment!
---
I'm so jealous that you'll have a working sink and toilet.
---
there are 3 types of metal armor.
---
light metal armor,
---
sturdy metal armor,
---
heavy metal armor.
---
They all look different, have different weights and resistances, and require different plans to craft.
---
/yawn
---
Nope.  Kept going back for a few minutes and nothing.
---
Chameleon and stealth are probably best for pvp
---
I would love to see the Whitesprings go from a Resort to a Wasteland
---
I look in multiple spots every day. Still no quest
---
Affected by rifleman perks.
---
Yessssss
---
Can you build near it to give your PC more to chew on while rendering?
---
I like vanguard cause I'm always in a team with rad sponge and use vampire gun so I'm max health 90 percent of time.

Not true. People have zero friends in their list and the problem persists.

I agree that it isn't griefing but i also hate it.  Think about the waste of time for these guys to hang out and wait for someone to take a power plant just to kill them. There is some boring crap to do in this game but that has to take the cake.  A bunch of people on here are saying if you dont like it dont take power plants but i say if you want to kill other players go to survival mode.
---
Alright
---
it also has to be a Camera Picture. not a Photo mode Picture
---
Likewise.  I'm really wary of claiming workshops because PvP players LOOOOOVVVEEEEEE low hanging fruit.  I'm just bummed you spent so many caps trying to slay a ghost.
---
If you're on PC, my IGN is shankwell.  I have a couple [skeleton](https://imgur.com/6gbMKt7) [keys](https://imgur.com/FCwTOmR) and the ability to swap perks to beat griefers at their own game.  Also just happy to hang with nice people interested in helping each other.  Teamwork makes the dream work.
---
I feel you on that. I don't play that often but have already build a large collection of items for the legendary vendor so I'm overencumbered and need Excavator to run. Getting the cores is a chore
---
I'd like to see a randomized dungeon with random enemy spawns.
---
I was sorting out the misc stuff because I tend to accumulate ore and crap that eats up weight. I found I have 2 kits. I had forgotten you get them from queen kills. As I have killed her 4 times since release, and 3 were lootable, that makes the drop rate pretty high.
---
sentrybots have had the fusion core removed from their loot table long time ago I believe
---
I see moreso the actual Auctionhouse mechanic similar to WoW, serving well here. It allows you to post up, set your own price, it’s limited to caps so P2P trading still occurs, and could really give some meaning to Craft/Scavenge/Cook/Chemist/etc., role players to reach end-game, god-tier gear.
---
They did state that the Nuclear Winter DLC is to be a new mode "with real consequences" we just don't know for sure what type of mode that might be. I would like a hardcore PVE mode personally.
---
Hey a wall of text is what this place is just for! Appreciate the detailed response yo!!!!!!!
---
That's what I'm struggling with. I honestly think there's the possibility for all three. All of it looks new. So it could be a new armor set plus a new underarmor, but I am also leaning towards a new outfit entirely because one, the picture was related to the atomic shop, and two, that rubber-looking cloth is long. Looks like a long rain coat or something. And, if there is no crotch in that piece like there is in other underarmors, it is not going to work with a number of the armor sets that have a piece that looks like athletic cups, such as the heavy combat chest.
---
No worries here . I guess it's to much to ask for everything to just work as intended. As in visually show correct health bar.
---
lol at that point I could just call her "Chunks"
---
The game really picks up later on imo. The beginning was eh to me (the vault part was really cool though)
---
King of the Hill 
---
Dungeons 
---
Player Hub
---
Kind of a tricky one to search, nothing came up.
---
As in a mode where they just drop you into a location and its straight up hell, wave after wave coming at you?
---
yesterday I watched a lvl 20 ghoul waltz up to some players house, the turrets started firing at it, but it just kept attacking the players house, the turrets stopped firing at it, and then the ghoul proceeded to destroy a wall or two of the players house before i jumped in and killed it to help the player out
---
i just kinda giggled to myself as the turrets were totally worthless
---
Communist Prime! Hellz yeah, make this a _thing_.
---
I think the sliders are quite varied and precise. I made a character that looks so much like me it unsettled my friend
---
25000 caps to 2500 atoms.....takes a good long while to make that many caps, and that's not really many atoms.
---
You don't have to take a picture of a player, just a picture in that area. I took a pic of Mama Dolce from on top of the statue and it worked.
---
&gt;New Armor &amp; Excavator Skin
---
I believe we've seen the armor in an atom shop datamine before, the excavator skin not so much
---
&gt;Purveyor release date changed?
---
It would appear so, as it was originally slated for May23. u/ladydevann has this been moved up?
---
I didn't realize Nuclear Winter was billed as a mode.  I figured it would like like the nukashine or photographer content that is added to the main game.  Neat.
---
Kill ticks and loot them everytime you see em. Keep doing this as you level up and then one day you'll be far enough along to craft stimpacks and you'll be very thankful you hoarded all that tick loot!!
---
As far as i can tell, nothing is redirected.....
---
So you can sell your propane and propane accessories?
---
You say the beam splitter benefits from the shotgun perks but from testing I have found this not to be true.
---
Which perks exactly are you claiming effect the beam splitter?
---
You can avoid taking unnecessary shots by waiting for the little box at the top right to appear confirming that you've got the correct location in frame. If the box doesn't appear, don't take the picture, and wander around a little more to find the right spot.
---
That’s why I said “only one I’m aware of”
---
Mothman creeps me out.
---
Ain't nothing wrong with drugs bruh.
---
If you have the time, could you possibly look for that specific datamine? I've looked over all of them in the past as they have been posted, but I don't quite remember anything like the armor in that picture.
---
I got a fusion core from every sentrybot at white springs just Tuesday. Granted they were only 50% but still there.
---
Since I'm procrastinating as it's 4pm on a friday and my boss is out golfing, I'll take a few minutes real quick.
---
Pretty sure I have a recon sensor in my stash.  Can't confirm until later tonight around 7:00 CST.  Be glad to trade for serums if I still have it.  GT -  GREYLORD48
---
Do brotherhood of steel and enclave events.  They reward power cores and sometimes a lot of em.  I haven't taken a power plant in weeks and I live in PA, only get out to craft and scrap.
---
OP was asking about PvE, but for a solo build I have to admit this is what I like. 
---
Pretty much able to sneak very close to pick off enemies,  and I can hide from bigger stuff if I  don't want to engage. It does occasionally fail if I do get pinpointed by several mobs at once, though even then I can usually survive by just running away and hiding again or just standing my ground and spamming Stimpaks and RadAway.
---
Regarding the Vault-tec Courtyard:  
---
What worked for me was standing right next to the Vaultboy Statue (I stood at it's right leg), facing the main VTU building and taking a picture.  
---
The View finder DIDN'T have any information in the top right corner but i DID get the challenge completed.
---
Wade Airport also has a vertibot pad.
---
I honestly think the fusion generator in your base should produce one every hour
---
It snorks and borks but lastly it horks
---
yeah this is bullshit, i say create a ticket and send to bethesda, they need to see this if only to prove to them the armor perks are broken
---
That's a new outfit, not armor type. It was data mined a while back.
---
Its a great idea but for bethesda it would impossible 😂😂😂 they barely manage
---
If the little box at the top right doesn't appear with the NPC or location's name, don't take the picture because it won't register. I've never had trouble with the Vertibots, but I always take the pictures front-on and that seems to register just fine.
---
As for the mirelurk one, it is a uniquely challenging shot, but the atom reward reflects that, and once you know a viable location (see: Glassed Cavern), you can actually get it done pretty easily.
---
I don't know why either but I had no problem getting the challenge. The two places for sure that I know the sheepsquatch spawns as a random event is up in the top right hand corner of the map there's a pond that has a vertibot in it and a big container - there's a random spawn there and it's a good place to hop. I have also seen one down in the Overgrown Sundew Grove at the bottom of the cranberry bog - I'd just server hop at one of the two places and you should get one after a few. I've encountered a sheepsquatch alone / I've seen one fighting albino radstags and I've had one where there's a living mr. herder handy bot with 3 cows and a sheepsquatch will come - this is not the event tho.
---
Alright, I'll give that a try next time, thanks
---
Plasma and laser Gatling still have bugs... Only shoots one bullet at first after reload... Why buy em??? Especially PvP...
---
*lamp
---
i'm sorry I can understand how frustrating that would be - maybe try building a defense to give yourself a warning maybe - i saw someone who built a whole house on top of the core generator once - at least them breaking it would give you a chance to flee / leave server or something!
---
Forget the haters. I camped at Poseidon on Tuesday night while I watched TV and wasn’t challenged once. I ended up with 25 100% cores by the time I logged off. It’s all about timing and finding a decent server. It’s not always your day but don’t let that stop you.
---
No worries!
---
Kinda.  Canon-wise it could be a vault that is ever-changing (structurally).  Multiple floors of random enemy spawns that get harder and harder the further you go down.
---
The further you go, the stronger the enemies.  Also, the further you go down, the better the loot from said enemies...but if you die, you only get to choose a handful of items to take with you that you received from the enemies/treasure chests you find (maybe 1 item for every 5 floors cleared?)
---
Yes, there will be treasure chests!  The loot in treasure chests will increase in quality with how far you get too.  
---
You may feel pretty confident, until you get to the 20th floor and have to fight an imposter sheepsquatch all by yourself (without the pylons).
---
Probably all of the people just going around leveling up, hiding from everyone else.
---
Wait till Tuesday when Survival Score is added, should be easier to find people during that. Especially people going around leveling up.
---
Horde mode. (Pve)
---
You and a team hold a point down to massive waves of enemies at the end rewarded with ammo and lots of junk scrap. Should have a chance to spawn 3* and should be something you have to load into like a separate server with a team (there's a word for it but I can't think of it.)
---
JuSt DoNt TaKe WoRkShOpS tHeN, I'm really sick of your sht mate. If I wanted to be repeatedly harrased by teenagers I would play counterstrike
---
It’s survival not PVP. Pvp is just an option chill bro
---
I made a mistake I have those apparently, do you have calibrated shocks and maybe Tesla bracers?
---
No, it's actually a salute, called salute. You get it by completing I am become death.
---
Unyielding Bloodied sneak melee is probably highest possible damage in the game
---
[Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ng59/datamined_new_atomic_shop_items_1303_patch_1108/)
---
It's not actually armor, just apparel that looks like armor. look through the apparel imgur album from that thread.
---
Hardcore PvE would be amazing; but the latency on servers is just too extreme. Countless times, fast travel to an area only to die on spawn to a group of invisible ghouls.
---
Fair point, I'll definitely be using it. Need to grind out about 10 levels to adjust my build lol
---
Hey Devann :D
---
wow it literally takes a negative amount of skill
---
I was sitting invisible in a corner but had to defend the workshop form some mirelurks stuck on the other side and that made him aware of me, he had to be looking for me for a while
---
They need to add it as a mod from vendors or learnable through scrapping.
---
So far I have only ever had a lobbing Tesla as a non legendary drop, which sucks because I have some good Teslas that I want to try it on.
---
The two biggest things for me:
---
**Remove Legendaries and Mutations.**  Everyone fights on a level playing field and SKILL is needed to win.  If you have to do some balance for lower level players, balance normal weapons, balance perks, it will be a LOT easier to do without trying to nerf every OP meta build that you can get with Legendaries and Mutations.
---
**Remove whatever you have to...........to get more frigging people on the map.**  This is a big map, and the people per square KM is the lowest I've seen in the survival gaming industry.  Quests, gone.  Open world loot, gone (put it all in containers, so if you get 10 of X at a location, they're all in the boxes, containers, chests).  Missions I'd still keep in there.  Reduce that server load and RAISE the player count.
---
That would get me playing this game again.  Until then, I'm done with Fallout 76.  I love PVP but it's so ridiculously unbalanced it's not even skill.  Just OP build = win.  I'm not going to spend hundreds of hours chasing whatever is the most meta build possible.  I want to use SKILL to win.
---
Unfortunately, I'm not sure that's something they can fix with their current set-up.  It's a data transmission issue that may or may not have something to do with frankensteining a single player game into multiplayer that doesn't seem to have local or regional servers.  (I live in New York, and often encountered players from California, eastern Europe and even Australians.)
---
agreed but to them may be 25 dollars of lost revenue so I doubt they would consider it.  Be interesting to see how things shake out with player vending
---
Duuuuuuuuuuude, what would you want for it? Caps or legendarys? Yeah, Janet's is way better, I usually hop between the two.
---
Maybe it’s hard to see on a 4” cellphone screen.
---
&gt; I think it’s unfair to suspend me for over 2 months for me serving dupers some justice
---
Assuming what you say is true, your characters behavior is indistinguishable from the dupers themselves.
---
Also, and this is the big also ...
---
If you had thousands of Nukas on you and you could still run means that you were at least using the carry weight glitch to have effectively unlimited carry weight.
---
Good luck in your appeals
---
Enforcer, a few of us spent the better part of 2 hours, using Train Tracks to count distance, testing both the Harpoon Gun with Flechettes and the laser rifle w/ beam splitter, over and over again, with and without perks, and saw a major increase in stagger with the perks equipped.
---
Basically since they changed the high score to kill count, you have a negative feedback problem.
---
The only way you can fight people is if you know where they are, either by them having workshops or being on the high score table. Since there is nobody on the high score table until someone kills someone else, it takes forever to get out of that rut &gt;_&gt;
---
Simple, play on a console.
---
Honestly I’ll just give it to you if I have one! Pretty sure I do on my mule :) I’ll be off work in a couple hours!
---
Yes, I'm pretty sure they're releasing nuclear winter as a game mode around June or July
---
Same here. Still can't find any way to complete this.
---
Gizmo's 9mm Mauser.
---
I'm just excited to be able to have a stove with the door on both hinges!
---
You didn’t read it all the way I took their stuff and went to a different server and dropped them all of the ground I had the nukas for maybe 5 minutes and I got suspended for over 2 months now and idk what the carry glitch even is
---
700? For such a basic ass skin?!
---
Chrome minigun is only 500. Don't give them ideas haha.
---
Stand in front of the statue, face away from the statue when you take the pic with the camera. That worked for me.
---
Oh my gosh I didn't even think about Seneca Rocks!
---
Trading is still banned I think. Just so you know.
---
This made my day...!
---
There are almost no details though right? Just curious.
---
With how the weapons can be modded to fill multiple roles, what I really want to see is guns for niches in the game that aren't filled yet. 
---
For pistols, I think there's room for a powerful semi-automatic like the Desert Eagle or 14mm. A break-action revolver using the Flare Gun animations would be great too, but not in .44. I already think it's silly that the Western Revolver and .44 Pistol aren't the same base weapon. Also wish they'd include a generic version of Fallout 4's Deliverer in the loot lists - maybe chamber it in .38 to stand out from the 10mm, and also make that ammo used for something other than pipe guns.
---
The current Assault Rifle already sucks compared to the Handmade, so if they add something like the Service Rifle or Chinese AR I'd rather it be chambered in something other than 5.56 to stand out. The Chinese AR could just be a skin for the Handmade though, tbh. With how bad the .50 Receiver is for Hunting Rifles, they could get away with making a proper .50 Sniper Rifle like the Anti-Materiel Rifle. Maybe they could add the Bozar as a sniper weapon that uses Heavy Gun perks.
---
For energy weapons, I just want the existing ones to get buffs... but something like the Sonic Emitter or Microwave Emitter would be awesome. Or the Tesla Cannon, as a heavy guns version of the Tesla Rifle.
---
true but for the love of god why are atoms so absurdly over inflated in cost?
---
i mean 50 bucks in atoms (the price of FO4's season pass) will literally get me about 3 power armor skins in the atom shop.
---
This would make our day. My wife is a Brotherhood diehard in the Fallout series. I am more of a personalized faction fan. Minutemen were cool, I enjoyed the community surrounding Rivet City in 3, absolutely loved being with Yes Man in NV. In 76, hmm...... CULT OF MOTHMAN \*dive bombs into a lamp and dies\*
---
Right...but you still took the duped items.  I'd ban you too
---
"spooked ya"
---
What about something very unusual these days?!
---
Like... Battle royal mode?
---
Not that i want to join it nor wish for but i could imagine its coming sooner or later.
---
The mods banned trading on this sub.
---
Get one each of the following: Mutant slayer, ghoul slayer, hunters, zealots, chameleon. Make sure some of them are either sentinel or cavalier. Sprinkle in some AP refresh. The type of armor matters less than the effects but combat or marine armor is generally best.
---
You'll take 15% less damage from pretty much every enemy in the game. 30% less from scorchbeasts and scorched variants of animals. Then you'll take an additional 15%+ less damage while standing still or sprinting depending on how many sentinel/cavalier pieces you get.
---
Add Blocker, Dodgy, and maybe Serendipity and you'll be an absolute tank.
---
I’d dump Blocker, personally. You’re going to be in PA, which has roughly 45% innate damage reduction (beyond the actual armor rating) and that’ll give you the points to max out ordinance/bear arms/heavy gunner. 
---
You run a lot of Charisma! I only run 4, switching in/out Suppressor or Tenderizer or other things, depending. For a heavy&amp;explosives build I’d want to move points to Endurance to max Fireproof for the explosion resistance, and perception for the explosion radius.  
---
I used to recommend not using starched genes, because prior to the last patch, as best as i could tell, you wouldn’t mutate in power armor (mutation chance is based on chance per multiples of 5 rads taken, and its almost impossible to take even 5 rads at once in PA) but I’ve mutated several times since patch 8, so that’s out. 
---
I run a low-health build so I’ve got some points in Nerd Rage. Otherwise, fairly similar loadout.
---
Thermic Lance from NV, or would that be too OP?
---
I'd love to get the Lincoln Repeater again
---
Line in the sand works for this real well
---
As of yet they havent released any information on it. They've made mentions here and there about the vaults, and how they want to add more modes in the future which should include the nuclear winter mode.
---
Why? And if so why have the tag? It makes no sense
---
Blur our their name I want to read it!

Stand between Statue and Main building facing the Main - snap - done.
---
Worked for me
---
Are there really people who haven't done this yet?
---
3? Dude I just dropped about 10 fertilizer.
---
Yeah =\ I haven’t been around much so I’ve not had the chance
---
Perfect. Thank you.
---
That's awfully kind of you! Thanks for the offer. I'll hit you up if I get over this any time soon, hah
---
Just an actual "reality survival mode". Tighter carry limits, no fast travel at all, realistic ammo, food and water weights, a "volume"-based inventory where space &amp; weight are considered, no player markers whatsoever on maps.
---
 Great thank you do much for the advice
---
Chinese Pistol would be nice, no doubt
---
Gotta love my silver shredder. id love more chrome paints for every big gun.. and also power armor
---
or my wife and I's personal favorite:

Very rare drop.

I too play as an evil ginger
---
Survival offers more opportunities, and is more consistent than PVP in Adventure.
---
If he wants more consistent PVP opportunities criticizing it being limited in adventure is absolutely a bunk argument. 
---
Far more valid would be wanting a PVP specific location or area within survival. 
---
"Bethesda you made a game mode that promotes PVP and limits it on the other. Don't increase PVP on your new PVP promoted game mode.... Promote it more on the one you limited"
---
That makes a boat load of sense.
---
I am aware which is why I'm tring to just buy it at this point
---
It's a reference to one of the shitty tabloid youtubers you mentioned.

🤷‍♂️ No idea.
---
I haven't taken a workshop from someone in months, and the last one I did was the abandoned town above Watoga. I took it so I could build crafting stations and a stash box. People take Thunder Mountain from me all the time, since I farm fusion cores and nuclear ore from there. I don't come on here complaining about it and calling people teenagers though, because I can deal with it. I can deal with the consequences that it explicitly warned me about and either fight for the workshop or move on.

I’m on Xbox I’ll be on for awhile hit me up when you can n0sg0d425
---
As someone who uses the LAR most of the time, I'd like the Cowboy Repeater/Trail Carbine, or Lincoln's Repeater back. 
---
That said, the Brush gun is basically the LAR in 45-70. I'd be happy with a caliber conversion for that.
---
They could just disable manual reloading for it and force it to only reload when the clip was emptied.
---

I had a Scorchbeast Queen corpse vanish right in front of my very eyes before I looted it.
---
I've never raged quit in my life, until then.
---
It's the apocalypse man. I'd be fucked up all the time.
---
Yeah I have a mate but he's rarely on and he lacks the patience for this kinda thing ha
---
.....only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running through...
---
You'll live a happier and more fulfilling life if you just go ahead and do something that looks fun to you and not rely on other people to push in one direction or another .
---
Only if we get Liberty Prime to fight against it
---
My experience is they vanash and go to their spawn location. I will often find a body in a weird spot I can loot and it's because that's where that enemy originally spawned in.
---
Either that or make it spawn anyway.
---
Yup, I  believe that a lot of folks just don't know.  For this reason alone, I really hope Bethesda either moves the spawn points or makes these no-camp zones once they implement the no-damage camps.
---
sorry this is just my curiosity, so i decided to ask reddit if it is or not
---
Lol I see 5 to 10 posts like this a day. Yes the answer is yes F76  is a dope ass game. Make sure to read up on the mechanics and different legendary items.
---
Armor perks aren’t broken. Just don’r take workshops unless you are ready for a fight.  You have to go out of your way to make yourself a target.
---
Looks like because people suck that's why. Looks like I'll never find the plans I'm looking for I guess
---
This comment hits home hard. I have found myself outlining what scrap I can get from x item irl. I thought I was just messed up. Guess not.
---
Man the tesla cannon was such a cool gun in new vegas
---
Pretty sure the Keg can't be obtained in-game yet, it's like most of the mounted creature plans in that it's visible in build mode but the quest to unlock it isn't active yet. Dunno how I feel about them teasing new build items this way.
---
As for the fancy round table, you can get the vanilla version from Pendleton at the Whitesprings. I think it's part of the Resort Tables plan. That reminds me, I should replace the table in my house with the fancy Atom Shop version now...
---
My 4th grade English teacher is losing her shit right now.
---
Yeah, if you look at some of the unmarked structures around the map (I like to build off of them) they have a really great run down feel to it. I'd love to be able to carry that over grown , nature creeping in vibe to a few I've built.
---
How i go about getting that mutation?
---
Essentially, only find it. I recently farmed every heavy raider piece from the three raider Savage Divide vendors. Had to server hop several times but eventually found the whole set. 
---
What crazy looking armor when it’s Buttressed. I love it.
---
Me too. For all our sakes
---
This is a genius idea!!
---
The charging shotgun barrel mod can only be learnt from the plan, not by scrapping. The lobbing barrel mod cannot be learnt at all. 
---
Source: Data mining.
---
No I dea how to get it.
---
I don't have a pistol build, but I would dearly love the 5.56 from the original game and New Vegas.  What a strange idea, totally impractical in real life, but very cool and original.
---
The Chinese pistol (aka broomhandle Mauser) would be a much needed addition for Guerrilla builds to not be locked into 10mm, pipe and laser pistols.  A .45 auto would be a welcome addition to bridge the gap between the RoF of the 10mm and the high damage of the revolvers.  7 round mag capacity boosted to 14 with an extended mag would be nice.  Maybe a 10 round "stinging" version for armor penetration and larger capacity.  
---
I feel like the brush gun is basically the Lever Action Rifle, and the Chinese Rifle is the Handmade Rifle with some minor cosmetic variance.  The combat shotgun is probably a better version of the NV riot shotgun.
---
I'd be curious to see how the anti-materiel rifle would play out in 76.  They'd likely have to add in 12.7mm ammo, since .50 is so easy to make in quantity.  Clearly it would need to have massive stopping power, with some drawbacks of significant recoil, slow fire rate, limited magazine capacity and possibly quick weapon degradation.  In a lot of ways, an AA/E hunting rifle [(yes they really exist](https://imgur.com/0qijS48)) is basically the same thing, only it's a unicorn to find/buy/trade for.
---
I've searched for this table for so long and everyone I've talked with literally never had heard of the dang thing. If this is true, you are a fallout God among dwellers

---
okay thank you! i already commented on someone else saying i didnt know this was so asked. Thank you for your opinion on this
---
I mean It can be definitely can be. Depends on whether if you have friends or your a loner. You can have fun either way but the most important part is do you like these kind of games. Bugs for the most part are smoothed out no patches just giving us stuff fixing bugs they make in the recent patch
---
That's the dilemma of an online multiplayer game. How to implement those changes without infringing on other players experience? 
---
Let's say some players enjoy it as is. Or perhaps new players, they would be robbed of the experience as they would never see it as it was originally.
---
Agreed. It's honestly one of my favs.  And I've gotten 3 prime receivers from the spawned scorch beasts during this event.  Just make sure you have a couple of stacks of steel to repair the transmitter if it gets damaged.
---
I know 😆
---
All builds and lack of knowledge about PvP aside, your strategy in these videos in terrible. You just run right in the front door stomping around in your power armor, you’re such an easy target it’s kinda hilarious man.
---
Ditch the power armor, learn how to sneak and be stealthy, get a chameleon piece. Learn to use your radar to spot red dots which in PvP are your enemies location. And most importantly use some kind of actual strategy instead of running straight in the front door every time and looking around, like come on ffs what did you expect lol?
---
Subnautica has that mode. Called freedom I think. No food or drink, but you still need to scrounge for building materials. 
---
I've quite preferred it to the need to eat and drink. 
---
Though I don't really have an issue with it in 76, but some may like the idea.
---
All great points. I agree with you that legendary effects and mutations are both a problem in PvP and I hope more can be done to increase the player count
---
Lord Nurgle is disappointed in you
---
If I dm you my email address, can you forward me the newsletter? I haven't received one
---
Perma death would be fun times. 
---
Perhaps only have plans carried over after death.
---
Should have gone with the plague rider armor 😂
---
.."Homie don't play that!"
---
Has a wonderful search feature. If only people would use it a bit more.
---
A lore of lore has been bent and messed about to fit 76. I wouldn't think too hard about it.
---
Well crap. I really wanted to run some tests with it.
---
On the shotgun variant, "learnt from the plan" you mean I have to find that specific mod plan right? Cause I bought the tesla rifle plan but it doesn't let me mod it to shotgun.
---
If you are in pacifist it just means YOU do no damage—not him.   And once you or a teammate take a workshop slap damage no longer applies.
---
Perhaps a little late to the show but i still enjoy the game.
---
Here's my little campsite - better than some, not as good as others but hella fun building it regardless!

Shame story is one of the most important thing
---
I’ve found your testing to always be more than adequate and I’ll give enforcer a shot.
---
At the same time, there were still the same 2-3 "best" options in NV.  The rest were just flavor.  Cowboy repeaters were straight trash after lvl 15, only there to repair your Medicine Stick once you got it.
---
Of course. Bethesda used to always go to my spam, so check there too.
---
I used to have fun playing rust i do enjoy these kinds of games i was just wondering about this because i wasnt sure if it was as good as iv been hearing thank you for your opinion on this matter
---
Not in 76 it isn't.
---
May you please elaborate
---
Happens when your camera is equipped? That's when it happens to me. 
---
You're right, it is fun. From what I've noticed it always flings you left.
---
I'm 99% sure it's the Resort Tables plan, but don't send bounty hunters after me if I'm wrong. But I promise you it's obtainable in-game, since one is sitting in my own camp.
---
It should be on par with 5mm, 100 ammo per craft due to the rate at which both ammo types are consumed when fired.
---
I'd love to see this. 
---
Even with pacifist mode enabled. 
---
It'd make a lot of resources significantly more valued and in demand. 
---
I'd love to see decision making around engaging a group of enemies vs how much of my valuable ammo it's going to take. Or if I'll even have enough.
---
I believe it is when the camera's equipped. I know the second/third time it happened I had my camera out, and I'm thinking the first time I did as well
---
Sorry, just traded my 1 calibrated shock a couple days ago.  No bracers, but I come across them alot for some reason.  That doesn't help you today though.  Sorry.
---
I'd be game if they had the option for a minimalist hud
---
You can
---
#1 buy recipe and craft your own serum, off science wing in enclave bunker (costs like 24k caps)
---
#2 buy serum ( one time use) same location for like 4k caps.
---
#3 get radiation on purpose, eventually you get mutation for free, however it is random, so you may be there a while.
---
#4 post on reddit, can typically find someone selling serum for 150-350 caps each. 
---
Note: if you plan on keeping the mutation, you'd need starched genes perk card under luck. Otherwise using radaway will cure it.
---
you know how wood armor is locked to 1 star only at the moment, right? Plasma rifle was bugged and was locked to 1 star, ontop of that they could only spawn as the nocturnal legendary.
---
I think it’s definitely one of those camp objects you like to see in someone else’s camp but not your own.
---
I found it on Amazon for $18 about a month ago and think it was worth it. I think under $20 you'll probably get your money's worth. Any higher and it just depends.
---
Correct. Currently you'd need a lot of luck to find the right plan.
---
That’s ok if you come across either the mod or the plans I’ll take them if I find them first I’ll let you know ...thank you
---
Because the servers offer 20% increased XP, remove that and you'll remove the meat of population on these servers.
---
Survival doesn't know what it wants to be. Imho it's a data stream for fixing pvp and moving forward with factions.
---
Same shit happens all the time with melee people. They block your shots in their big ass PA and one shot the enemy with melee. It's a two way street.
---
For now.  Wait till they adjust degradation rates on a type of weapon or armor, or nerf the Gunsmith perk just a little bit.
---
The repair kits themselves are not a big deal but their existence taints any adjustment to junk, condition, or relevant perks. We won't know if it was adjusted for game reasons or revenue reasons.
---
TYVM
---
Well to my knowledge the T-60 is a new model that the BOS around the same time period as fallout 4 so it should not exist in 76. Also would explain why the ultracite power armor  looks more like the T-51 then the T- 60
---
It's been months so I don't know if you found out since this post, but if not I just wanted to point out that both are correct... but he's talking about healing rate and you're talking about time reduction.  
---
Let's say you had exactly 200 hp to heal and the heal over time effect of a stimpak would heal exactly that amount.  If it took 20 seconds to heal you fully, then you're being healed at a rate of 10 hp/s. If that healing rate is increased by 1.67 times, then now it's 16.7 hp/s.  200 divided by 16.7 is 12 seconds which is exactly what you found.
---
lmfao ya'll couldn't cut it in a blue state? had to run away to a mountain in a red state i see. What are you so scared of cities for?
---
Ok thanks. I have heard of this. A tip: With Super Duper you can sometimes get double results when refining ore.
---
Ok good feedback I can't arguee with that
---
Which is why I explained what you're supposed to see.
---
I see it happen that todd soon get a package with a typewriter and a note in it "wash it" lol
---
again agreed I like dumb stuff as much as the next guy cant bring myself to spend like 18 bucks on a power armour skin 3-4 bucks maybe 18 wtf
---
Because the users banned from the other trading subs make their way here and the mods here don't want to deal with the hassle of a blacklist
---
So the first time you travel to ws enemies will spawn and will respawn about every 20 min give or take if yiu leave and fast travel back. Look up the routes so you know where to start and finish or there could be conflicts with other players. I usually look at the map and go when no one is around. A good mele like the all rise and using twisted muscles/Martial artist perk will demolish non glowing gouls.
---
That one worked for me just fine all the time. It's a useful post though, definitely worth an upvote!
---
Sometimes these photo challenges get confusing, the latest daily one to take a photo at vtu courtyard. I ran all over the place taking pics like crazy but to no avail. Does it even trigger anywhere?
---
And that one about taking a pic of a player in raider clothes and hat. Which exactly are these clothes and hat?
---
Incorrect, in Fallout 4 you see the army wearing T-60 when the bombs are falling.
---
It is definitely is out of place, paradox no. If they would say that it was given out to only eastern army’s around the commonwealth and Virginia’s in limited number. With mass numbers of these being in certain bases. And others just a few t-60’s where they where testing its effectiveness in city warfare then it would make better sense lore wise.
---
I feel like it should be a better mix of X-01 and t-51. That has that prototype feel to it. With the a version being more t-51 then slowly transforming into what we now know as t-60. 
---
Just my take on what it should be
---
I'd assume yes as it's still a flamer. I keep meaning to test this but there's rarely opportunity in this game to heal people.
---
Keep your serums. or sell them to me.
---
Code could be buggier, which would suck. Sorry bro.
---
Aww man thought I was the first to get to you. Personally I like these posts because it means lots of new players! Good luck!
---
Yeah I have a friend group that I usually play with and I was thinking of using a Explosive flamer to heal and attac
---
They did O-O must of forgotten that sorry for the bad info
---
Really like this idea, a dynamic and responsive environment would take this game to the next level
---
Makes sense, thank you for clearing that up.
---
I know this is an older thread but I am getting the 4:8:2000 error code so is that the BANNED code? Because I was banned they said it wasn’t permanent but sure as hell looks like it was permanently banned. 
---
Also I didn’t duped say what you will but I didn’t, I have lots of friends (2 maybe now out of 100 plus before the bans that still play that I played with everyday and have all the same stuff pretty much, so I why me? Pretty sure I had over 100k of some stuff but got all that before the previous banned and past 30 day notice associated with my current ban) 
---
Anyway I promise I didn’t dupe dumped most of my ammo before the update and did a lot of mule transfer holding for ppl. I’ve made 4 tickets to Bethesda and called once and haven’t gotten any response back other than my first ticket with the for the error code back when I was banned with “you have been found to have 100k or more of a Rare item.” 
---
So I guess you got back into the game? Good for you! Sorry to again to post my 2cents on your old as hell thread, but I’m guessing my error code of “2000” is the blacklisted error code? 
---
I just haven’t seen much or can find much in the way of info for my predicament of when I could be unbanned or if it will happen? I’m guessing duping is still possible hence me still being banned? but I have also not heard anything about banned players in a really long time. 
---
Again sorry for the post, just looking for help and info Bethesda hasn’t gotten back to me on the issue and searching the internet hasn’t found much other than old posts from months ago. Like this one! But yours is relatively new.
---
If you're PC, I play with my best bud often a lot. I'm West Coast as well, so same hat.
---
Ahhh, fair enough! I don’t pay attention to much on youtube :)
---
It is just one thing on a list of 20 or so basic features that every MMORPG needs that Bethesda has failed to implement. This game has made it very obvious that these guys have never made an MMORPG before and that most of their devs haven't even played one.
---
I’ve got a medic’s plasma rifle I’ve had since like... december...
---
my big wish thats prob never going to happen is them remaster Newvegas and all the dlc and release on ps4 where it might actually run ok
---
Yes sometimes they fight but sometimes they flee.
---
I would appreciate a lot more giant enemies
---
Snuffles. It’s a throwback.
---
Take a dump: + 10 carry weight.
---
Same here - I found one spot I really liked but it's just a bit too close to the downed airplane location so I couldn't settle there but that's okay!
---
Yes, you can start it at a house northeast of Vault-Tec University
---
I actually play with someone from west Virginia so I keep asking him if things in the game exists also why there is so many beer bottles everywhere....
---
so you are ok with everything in that video?
---
geez
---
It would be cool to do this by launching 3 nukes at it within a certain time frame.
---
Well thats annoying.
---
Perfect, thanbk you ever so much :D
---
Also if you wait until June maybe July better quest lines will be coming, check the road map just to make sure. PvP is meh but they are still working out kinks
---
Skin for current assault rifle......m16
---
My friends and I have a fun, goofy group.  We can run up to 7-8 players between two teams on a lively Saturday afternoon server chatting through Discord, launching nukes, starting up events, sharing hits on 3 star enemies, swapping legendary gear and just goofing around with strange workshop decorating.  If someone starts griefing one of our camps or messes with a friend while they're trying to make a pile of ammo at that workshop, the poor bastard that shot one of us in the back while we're grabbing some ammo has no idea that there's now 7-8 lvl 200+ players across multiple servers that know their name and can converge on them no matter where they go.  I almost feel bad for the griefer until he figures out what's happening and manages to block all of us.
---
you can purchase it outright at the enclave vendor but you can buy them for alot cheaper on the market from other players
---
be sue to have starched genes lvl 2 perk card so the mutation doesnt go away if you use radaway
---
I call bs. I stole millions (yes, millions) of lbs in crafting materials from a duper's mule, and I wasn't banned.
---
I think there's something here you are not telling us.
---
Lol so is mine but even still I screw d them over and I only had the items for a couple of minutes so how does it that warrant a ban
---
It would be so amazing to have a camp item that you can enable that would call in whatever the local enemy was in wave after stronger wave until they are able to destroy the device.  
---
It would be like opening whole new tower defense game and really give you a great reason to hang out in camp.
---
Yup, camera + emote. Bug identified literally right after camera was released. Reddit was flooded with similar posts. Surprised bethesda didn't release a hotfix the next day.
---
This times a billion
---
Yep floor.
---
The wall one, everytime I log out and back in, I have to disconnect the cord and reconnect to get power back to it.
---
Seems glitched.
---
Nope full story it was about 303 thousand pounds of nukas but I really only had them for a few mins and my account got flagged for over 100 k of the same item with no appeal options I never duped or did any exploits I actively traded a lot but that’s it
---
now we just need legendary ones.
---
May just be a placebo effect but mine seem to be targeting better with it close by.
---
I'm a Free Stater for sure, a libertarian in real life, but I respect hard work, personal sacrifice and dedication in all forms.  Taggerdy's Thunder gets a ton of respect in my book.
---
There’s still no safe zone setting either and items still vanish from inventory as well.  There’s a lot of annoying things in this game that I’ve never experienced in any other game. Why no safe zone and fov slider?
---
Not just turrets. He can mind control everything but players.
---
Trying to get the vertibot is ridiculous, still stuck on that one.
---
Joins and agrees to pvp, complains about being killed to the internet. 
---
Please explain how it can be griefing when you agreed to pvp when claiming the workshop
---
I got this drop on xb1 last night. Reward for one violent night.
---
when i used the wall ones, id always hook them up by switches, and tell a terminal to turn them off and on again
---
West coast, ps4, gamertag Fallen_CRISIS.

It may be part of the game, but it’s a shitty part for those people trying to take a workshop and some crew comes in and instantly kills them.  There isn’t a real game there on either side, and that’s why we have this thread every single day.  Workshops are a cool part of the game that’s made into shit because these “raiders” want easy kills.
---
Been doing that event everytime it pops up with no luck lol
---
 Not hacking, but definitely proof that Bethesda needs to look at balancing legendary affixes on various things.
---
*proceeds to start attacking you if you dont trade with him*
---
Already exists
---
And now I realize why almost all the clothing is "dirty" lol
---
Oh, my bad I've been pretty AWOL lately so I haven't seen any of those posts.
---
Perfect, I wonder how low the chances are for each of them.
---
I do that event just to farm treasure maps tbh. The legendary drop is usually garbo. Let me tell you I was over the moon to see the shielded raider on the reward screen. I'm not even sure I have protected.
---
what about the Shoulder mounted 10MM MG from new vegas? id LOVE to have that. 
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Shoulder\_mounted\_machine\_gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Shoulder_mounted_machine_gun)
---
I can see your question isn’t being answered, but I think I see what you’re asking. 
---
I’ve noticed for a lot of armor the primary visual change is the level of defense (polished/shadowed/etc). Experiment for looks! I think one of the coolest changes nobody really knows about is “studded” on leather armor looks awesome. 
---
For the armor that was present in fallout 4, a lot of them are also visually changed by the effect mod on it. For example (using leather again because it has some really cool mods) the “brawler” mod on a heavy metal arm adds gigantic 1-2ft spikes on your shoulders. And the “weighted” mod adds giant metal ball studs all over the armor.
---
Last but not least, as mentioned previously. The light/sturdy/heavy versions of each armor will affect how the base model looks before mods or upgrades. 
---
Hope this helped!
---
I added the spotlights a few weeks back and it's like they woke up.
---
Just sent. We might need to tag a couple more community managers in here to get an actual response on the purveyor date.
---
Especially handy with Ultracite PA I would guess
---
interesting
---
might give it a shot next time. Grinding events for extended periods of time might be better than just waitin for someone to shoot me in the back
---
How funny! Go to notes in your pipboy and learn the plans first, then in the camp menu the tinkers bench is under crafting.
---
Create another account. Buy another copy of the game. I play with people who have accounts that are banned.
---
Now we need prices so I can sell some of my extra plans
---
I mean I figure if you could teleport and avoid death you would too lol
---
So strictly melee items. Sweet.
---
Technically it shouldn't exist in Appalachia. Fallout 4 explains it was first used in the Battle of Anchorage (Alaska) then distributed to help fight against protesters on October 23 (day of the bombs dropping). The shipments are only seen arriving at what are assumed to be high riot areas (aka Boston). The military were most likely were going to supply Grafton (and possibly Beckley) but the bombs stopped them. So although there shouldn't be T60 there almost was. We know the armor never arrived because A: Grafton has 0 power armor spawn locations and B: Beckley had small roits contained by robots instead of soldiers.
---
All I get is garbage from every event. It's sad and is killing the game for me
---
Ladder/seasonal
---
feel free to ping valseek as well, ladydevann is usually reliable though
---
Probably, bit if I did it then it's cheating.
---
I can see the headlines now:
---
"Man builds missile turrets on top of house, claims he always finds ghouls attacking his crops"
---
Would be nice if they had a higher chance for Addictol similar to how some first responders carry Narcan.
---
The Brush Gun is the Lever Action in game. Other games had the 30-30 and 357mag versions as the lever gun and the .45-70 as Brush Gun. In 76 there is just the one, in .45. For a lever gun that means .45-70, 45LC, or 540BM. All, in essence, the same round. (not interchangeable- just extremely close performance numbers)
---
I've been buying cores from the enclave if needed. During the dbl XP I picked up a few more cores so I have a stash. It seems cores were nerfed, hard to find lately? It would be cool to have a locator perk when one is near.
---
Yeah they've died down now. But all everyone was posting an hr after the update lol.
---
I would but that’s ridiculous also I could see maybe a one or two week suspension but I flat ban from the game forcing me to make a new account and buy the game again is stupid I feel like they wayyyy over reacted the way they did
---
Wait till update now we will be back to people getting marked on map for merely not dieing again\*.
---
\* Talking about survival score since living and getting exp aka normal stuff puts you higher and higher on the list till they tell where you at so cap hunters can track you down.
---
Yeah I know. Spawns with one are weak / light but you can get good numbers with a few more people. 
---
Anyway, I'd like more complicated events with mechanisms that encourage participation.
---
The game isn't full of glitching griefers. What happened to op is a rare case of somebody abusing a specific combination of legendary affixes and game mechanics; it's rare because it's not easy to get the gear required to do that, and this is in survival mode as well.
---
That said, the game is definitely not perfect but Bethesda is slowly balancing things as the game grows. It's nonetheless quite fun to play, as a newbie I recommend starting in normal mode though.
---
Makes sense during the showcase of the game last year tod did say this wasnt as hardcore on pvp as for example: rust or dayz
---
Well for starters, in Maryland if somebody invaded your home you can’t defend yourself unless they’ve hurt you. Grew up and dealt with that on a personal basis.
---
Where does this event spawn at?  Never seen it
---
I bet it is. I'm sorry. It's pretty frustrating to spend 5-10 mins to get a lvl 20 mutants 1* pipe wrench and some 40mm grenade rounds. Over and over and over.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/lbDpDIi.png](https://i.imgur.com/lbDpDIi.png)  
---
What am I doing wrong?
---
yeah, if I had an option to play offline I would 100%. Pointing out shitty game mechanics that are exploitable af. If I wanted pvp I would joind survival server or played fkin fortnite
---
I'd love for seasons to come to a Fallout game.  I could only imagine Rad-Blizzards where you need to manage your warmth as well to not freeze, almost like Zelda BotW, but not as severe.
---
That's 100% false.  My double barrel does dick damage from 40 feet but upclose can onevshot lvl. 68 ghouls.
---
Or party posters at train stations and player camps.
---
Here's a link to the Fallout 76 forums about the issue, but I wouldn't want to disable any antivirus capabilities, but you could just disable it when playing so it'll save at least.
---

---
i had to double back and check patch notes. I cant find anything that mentions it but im 100% sure plasma rifle/pistol was locked to 1star nocturnals at launch and was later fixed. i'll do some more digging for it, but i know thats the reason we dont see any explosive plasma rifles/pistols.
---
We can team up. I've done most quests so can help out if needed.
---
GT is same as here.
---
Xbox.
---
Maybe they like that one President. Whats his name? Chump? Lump? I can't remember, not important.
---
Yeah been looking for the bos mechanic jump suit and the leather coat as well I do so many events and get nothing its disheartening to say the least that the drop rates are so low
---
I’ll have to work on building an abysmal skybase that’s just one open floor plan with a bed, ammo table, welding bench, methlab, and shining station. 
---
I’ll update you with whether or not foundations clip together irl.
---
There are some in the files because you could mod it in fo4 but for some reason they didn’t add it it
---
Big explosive lamp make me friends
---
There are 3 spawn points. Groves Family Cabin in the Forest, Big Fred's BBQ Shack in the Savage Divide, Southern Belle Motel in the Mire.
---
1911 would fit, glock wouldn't belong though.
---
Thematically, I don’t think it will happen. A big thing in the fallout universe is showing the effects of that era’s exaggerated views on communism and enemies abroad, and how it led to us destroying our culture before the bombs even hit. It’s why the Americans go bonkers at the slightest hint of communism, but almost all actual communist met throughout the series have been sympathetic, like the submarine captain in four or the monks in LA. Making a giant, dangerous commibot would be a step backwards in the message they’re trying to send, even though it would be really really cool.
---
how much caps is one core ?
---
Near Fred’s BBQ shack and in the upper left corner of the forest, forget where it’s called but if you see an event marker in the top left of the world map it’s probably free range
---
Don't build anything and don't do the defend event. Just do the recapture. The pvp guy will fast travel for the event but you won't be around and if there isn't anything built theres no reason for them to stick around and take your shop. After a while go back do the recap for the same loot and then build up, and never stick around long.
---
Or hire some pvp mercs to run defence for a while
---
It’s ok you can say it. You don’t want to live in a democrat shit hole ;) And who can blame you
---
Thanks, if you end up with different results let me know.  
---
**More Details**  
---
We did it at WhiteSprings Train station.  
---
Removed all DMG perks  
---
Entered PVP  
---
Hip fire
---
Had 3 people watching (Right and ahead, Middle, Left and Behind) and counting the Staggers.    
---
Repeated the test 3 to 4 times for a good count, then did it again with Reflex, then again with scope, and finally with VATS
---
I’ve had this happen a few times too
---
I like the idea of players being able to affect the world. New players get to hear stories from veterans and see how their actions affect the wasteland they now call home. It shows that time is continuing to flow in the world beyond a ticking number on your pip-boy...
---
Thanks! I had to take, like, 4 or 5 different photos and it didn't register. Your method worked perfectly!
---
Recon scope for the win
---
And a throwing weapon
---
I got one of these to drop once. Gave it to my wife. Ruined the game for her . Made it too ez-mode she says.
---
So how does the name dragon come in? Is this player given or does it say dragon somewhere in game?
---
A proper survival mode.

---
They need an event called catastrophe in which 100 mothmen spawn around and you gotta whap em all in time 
---
or multiple nukes fall
---
I'm having same issue at pc, also sometimes my character is teleporting several times.
---
For quick fix to, I suggest you to use emotions again. It have a change to fix your issue.
---
Yeah, hope crafted gear gets the ability to turn legendary. Otherwise my Sheepsquatch imposter head was a waste of atoms AND mats
---
Because everuone would just set up massive arsenals near spwn points and then wander off to drink nuka cola in safe places while accumulating legendary stuff.
---
I've been meaning to record video of it happening because it happens to me all the time. They will just disappear. They don't leave the pile behind. I have even been in the inventory screen looking at the corpse's body when it will simply disappear without a trace. I'm playing on an Xbox One X. I now have the Bloody Mess maxed out and equipped. I honestly haven't paid attention to see if they're still disappearing with that perk equipped as it's a newer perk for my character.
---
**Bethesda:** Here's this neat new thing to do which we'll tie into a lot of daily challenges.
---
**Players:** Sweet! Do we start it like the other new quests from conveniently located posters?
---
**Bethesda:** [Well, sort of...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQfSLnRE2Fg#t=15s)
---
So to paraphrase what you are saying, "Don't you guys have phones?"
---
The LMG is an MG42, so I'd love to be able to use a fucking M1 Garand, I'd even pay.. Atoms at least, haha
---
I don't know about the gun damage reduction because I don't use energy weapons (melee).  The energy resistance works great though.
---
I get loot from critters killed by my camp turrets.
---
Did you ever find the limb plans? I can’t find them for shit. Bought the heavy combat chest piece but that’s it for me 😭
---
What system are you on, would be more than happy to help hunt him down and then go back and forth switching his inventory.
---
This game (and fo4) needs a "if the object is floating, automatically add some type of terrain around it so it looks better" system or something.
---
This is about the creepiest/stalker like story I've ever read on this sub, role playing is cool and all....but some of you go the extra mile and just make it creepy a shit. It's just a game people.
---
Same. Only once so far, but on ps4.
---
Well that's because of spread perhaps. Explosive damage doesn't have range. Try it out with different explosive guns.
---
On here, you need to use imgur and post a link.
---
I'm pretty sure a single giant liberator wouldn't fit into the lore... but what could work is if all the liberators joined to form one giant beast, like nano machines but bigger.
---
It would be part of an event that starts at Mama Dolces called, "Eat the People".
---
Liberators were designed to beat American robots not by being bigger and stronger, because china couldn't out do them in a head to head fight. The way liberators work is they attach to the head of other robots and take control of them. Chinese mind control bots.
---
There are actual in game models for the various robots that have been taken over by liberators, they just aren't implemented.
---
What you really want is liberty prime, covered in hundreds of tiny commie parasites that need to be removed. Like burning a wasps nest.
---
I'm not sure it works like that? Do high level enemies spawn if no one is there to see them? I've never seen a legendary corpse near a camp with no one else there.
---
Noticed that as well on my second play through.  Those Responders really knew how to party!
---
Very happy to help
---
You already know that plan. It’s found all over the place. You don’t need to do anything with it in your pipboy anymore, it’s already been learned by you. Now just go into your camp crafting menu and scroll to the right until you’re under the crafting tab. The Timkers bench should show up there
---
But you keep claiming workshops and agreeing to the pvp pop-up. So you are playing pvp. That's the point many players seem too stubborn to accept. Bethesda made workshops to be pvp content regardless of mode. 
---
Im sorry for your frustrations but they could easily be avoided by not joining in on the pvp content. It's your choice
---
200 something caps I think
---
Also acceptable!
---
Gotta select it in notes first to learn it. Then you should be good to go.
---
What level are you? They run from lower levels. At least they did for me.
---
It didn't last long though, once the war came they were just a bunch of washed up old criminals
---
You can reload a garand before the en bloc is empty.
---
That's sad! Whish Sony would be more willing for cross platform play. If you get a xbox as a present for holidays we could try it again. Until then  Auf Wiedersehen
---
No more out of place than giant mutated shrimp and deep sea anglers, in the mountains, hundreds of miles from the ocean.   :-)
---
You know you can get to an additional screen on your phone that has punctuation marks, right?
---
In the atom shop.. go to the emotes and equip it
---
The FMs are especially prone to fleeing if you sneak attack and stay crouched.  They seem more willing to fight if they have something to shoot at right away.  Mothmen of most types except maybe the vengeful ones seem to dip unless you can kill them quickly.
---
Fairly low for most of the encounters, less than 25. The most recent one almost 40
---
Steal what?
---
the pie?
---
Yes in real life you can.  Bethesa struggles with this in their games however.  It took them years to fix the Lever Action Rifle reload going back to Fallout 4.  I replied to someone poking fun at Bethesa struggling with reloading animations and offered a solution, thats all :)  Thank you for your post.
---
Biggest issue is laser weapons giving your position away. Basically a big flashing signpost so doubt you'd get a lot of millage out of stealth anyway. In pvp at least.
---
Can't the decon shower (and everything for that matter) be repaired by moving CAMP like...a foot? Kind of a hassle, but far less than getting all that flux.
---
Any plans that day (Known) in front of them are basically duplicate plans. Find someone that may want the known plans (no one needs a tinkers bench past level 3 or 4), drop them from your inventory, or put them in a random container for someone to find. Or find someone that sells plans and give your known plans to them. I’m a plan salesman on PS4 but looks like you’re on PC
---
Or a Liberator-head-style annihilator they “reprogrammed”. The ultimate strike bot lolol 
---
..._with concrete hammer-saw arms and laser-mounts, screaming propaganda in Sentry-bot tone...._
---
Ah, that may explain it.
---
The shards, but good joke
---
Oh I see.
---
D'oh, too bad you're on XBox; I'm also PNW but play PC
---
I sold the staff plan for 2k on xbox
---
Because the #1 thing that makes my blood boil in this game are idiots that set up their camps at WS with their pointless turrets pointed toward the WS Windows, killing all the ghoul spawns, rewarding no one. 
---
If those turrets actually rewarded the nimrods that do this? The game might actually deserve 25% of the hate it gets.
---
He's like "dude, really?"
---
The problem is that it's not a boring waiting game for the raider types. As soon as a defend event starts at your workshop, the event is public and other players can fast travel to you. They don't even have to wait for the enemies to be cleared before they can contest and kill you while distracted by the mob.
---
No, there's no real advantage to it when it comes to pvp engagements. And it's an option open to everyone, doesn't negatively impact others experience.
---
r/yeehaw
---
How come no one is talking about the rifle he is holding? That's a new weapon isn't it? Or is a reskin of the Dragon?
---
By decanter do you mean the punch bowl?
---
Lucky me I didn't need to waste any mats because I can't even craft the assaultron head, so I bought the skin for no reason.
---
It was like that 2 weeks ago, at least I won't lose 90% of my meds and 200-500 caps a death. . . for the limited period I'll bother with survival this week IF the weapon reward isn't garbage.
---
I've never seen a turret at WS TBH. Seems silly given how much it gets nuked. I see your point though, but it's not as if it's only open to those people to exploit.
---
I haven’t done that in a long time, and back then it seemed like if an item like the decon shower was destroyed and I moved my camp, the shower would just disappear. I haven’t blueprinted anything since like December and currently can’t move my camp to test how it works nowadays (I would lose the last magic carpet in Appalachia if I relocated!)
---
That'd be fun too!!! 🥊🎳🕹️
---
The most suspicious people in the Fallout universe are the ones that don't have drugs. Everybody was using before the bombs, and you can sure as hell bet they were using afterwords.
---
Don't buy a castle it's hard to maintain and you pay much for heating. Even in Germany castle aren't used as a house. But more for tourists
---
Honestly, this may have been patched, as I haven’t seen it happening in a while. But the annoyance resonates. ;)
---
Yes please!
---
Call it "Bug Zapper", gentlemen start your tesla guns!
---
Surely we'd just end up where we are now in regards to gear disparity but it would just take abit longer.
---
dude, i'm lvl 46 and didnt know this.   :-o
---
I think the game is fun. I know their is alot of poeple still saying it's a waist of money but what I'm slowly learning is it wasnt meant to b like the others basicly it's your game play it how u like. kind of wish their was a way to make custom NPCs so you could make story quest for people but that's s minor issue
---
If you mean punch bowl it’s still there.
---
Doesn't mean they weren't there. Haven't played much lately but I've seen plenty of guys doing pve in pvp even really high levels. It's easy enough to clear the leader board tag by killing yourself. Try whitesprings.
---
Well yeah, I meant in your inventory. He's saying they have weight, and I'm wondering how he knows that, as I haven't been able to find them in any of the Item categories.
---
Adapt or pick up Fo4.
---
Do you want me to say Fallout 76 is badly designed game? It is. All multiplayer elements can go burn in hell. If the only way to get a core is jump servers for 25% core or claim workshop for 100% core, I am forced to do these. It' not out of choice, I'm doing it out of necessity. I may stop doing it soon, and just delete the game from my drive to make space for something else to keep me entertained. I'm starting to consider this game no longer entertaining because of all the soul crushing grinding elements there are and not enough actual rewards. Happy now?
---
That was a different challenge.
---
nice, thanks, i 'm gonna enjoy it quite a bit then
---
Why hate on the camps? Other players make random encounter locations proc all the time, with or without a camp. Why does a camp make it worse?
---
I mean I get why people dislike turret camps behind the golf club. But it seems like you're directing game mechanics based anger at other players with this. Or am I missing something about how these spawn points work?
---
yep, my bad. as far as i've been told in another comment, it's still there, luckily
---
Yeah it is
---
I usually have everything else closed and only one monitor 1440p. I haven’t tried to unlock framrate yet, so that may be it as well. My monitor supports 144hz at 1440p
---
Craft em. Scrap em.
---
When you're in build mode, blueprints refer to things you have "blueprinted", like building objects you've selected, so you can just plop those items down as a set, without manually replacing them.
---
That workbench you're looking for is under Crafting.
---
If they ever get AA to work with energy weapons I'm afraid they will have to go back and nerf/undo some of the buffs they've done cause the dps is then to good. This will seriously tick people off. IMO they shouldn't be doing any buffs to energy until AA is fixed so they can see the end results.
---
I believe they are in the Misc tab.
---
Why is that? There is a function for adding photos so it seems strange it only allows text based posts
---
I would just personally rather it be that everyone start over, same level, and same stuff since we all end up with a pipe pistol and machete at the beginning lol. Then, this way, everyone would all have to grind and work for those God roll weapons and armor. Granted, people could also try and save up til they got max caps to buy said weapons or armor, but it's getting harder and harder to find someone who's willing to sell stuff like that for caps. Which personally I find to be really annoying, but that's just my take on it
---
Welcome to the club! 
---
Regardless of how terrible the launch was, the game has always had a lot to enjoy about it. 
---
Hopefully in a year from now they have all the kink ironed out and I can say the game is spectacular. For now, it's pretty damn good, a solid 7 out of 10.
---
Is that not just a base musket?
---
Man I was at a players house and there was a mirelurk destroying the fences around his crops, his rocket turrets going crazy but not able to shoot the mirelurk.  I went down to blast it with my shotgun, random pellet hits his fence and destroys it.  I get bounty, he shows up 5 seconds later 50 levels above me and blasts my face off.  Last time I try and help someone elses house lol
---
👍😂
---
I think the 60 per hour is the max you can produce, and it's a shared total. With 12 industrial purifiers each would only produce 5 per hour.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWPN52WeL5g#t=3m7s) is how I read that in my head.
---
Yeah but the pvp it’s different idk how to describe it besides it’s who ever pretty much gets first shot wins
---
On the emote wheel press R1 on trade.
---
Oh, me too. I don't expect to see legendaries for sale at the bot vendors after the legendary vendor and player vending come online. Prices will get competitive quickly.
---
Over time, and probably not very long, that 10% fee will destroy a lot of caps and that is definitely a good thing.
---
Where do you find the camera?
---
There's currently no planned expiration for both the free punch bowl and the gift emote.
---
If a tree falls in the forest, and nobody’s there to hear it, does it make a sound?
---
See I'm completely okay if they roll back the damage buffs a little or evena  little to much for some pen because they can always bring back a little base damage if they have to
---
That's crazy man. But even if u didn't see that I think it's just logical that it would b a skeleton. I can't imagine tourists wondered around after the war...🤔🙄
---
Same reason they put typewriters in suitcases and dresser drawers obviously. Don't you know how to use The Three Typewriters?
---
After you own it, check your emote wheel in game. There's a button option for some of the emotes that lets you swap them out. Don't remember which specific emote it replaces, but was the bottom right corner of the wheel.
---
I could set up a turret camp at an enemy spawn location. Stick myself in a box and wrap a rubber band around a controller and leave it.
---
It would either crash the server eventually or break the economy because of all the loot that co u is be farmed afk.
---
And you can't tell me people wouldn't abuse it.
---
Not at all. You need to take a breath and chill out. Sorry I've upset you further and offended your delicate nature by pointing the facts, I'll just stop now. Feel free to continue to whine and complain about something that is 100 your choice to avoid
---
Pretty sure camps prevent the random encounter from happening at all.
---
Every "collect wood" challenge we've had has worked the same way.
---
I've seen this once on PC as well.  I believe I emoted again to get out of it.
---
May 7 for gift emote on Xbox just read it in news...
---
..
---
What system do you play on i like pvp and I always have to be in a team so I could help
---
Each subreddit makes its own policies. You could check with one of the moderators, but that's what I've learned.
---
You can get them from the enclave bunker.
---
You did something wrong, probably.
---
A great spot to get them is the assault bots that look like tanks. Theres always one north of whitesprings along the tracks were the train accident is. He drops a nearly full core.
---
This happens a lot, I’m always surprised others can’t figure out how to quickly disable this. All you have to do is hold the button to get your weapon out (hold square on PS4). This will cancel being stuck gesturing.
---
I have my turrets hooked up to terminals, I found out he hacks your terminals, the turrets themselves glow the same aura of purple as him/her/it.
---
Yes. It has happened quite a few times.
---
As a complete stab in the dark, my next suggestion would be to set the Fallout76.exe file to run as an administrator. If there's no funny business in the path to your Documents\\My Games folder then a permissions issue is most likely.
---
The mods that don't require a perk don't seem to attach to urban armor. This has been a bug since day 1. Sleek effect should work out to faster moving while sneaking. O e day they'll patch it.
---
Grrrrr. Those damn burning barbed plans...
---
I server hop until I either find a fairly empty server or one filled with lower levels. Then I’ll take over all 3. I did for a whole day a few weeks ago and ended up with over 100, which I split with my teammates. I have a few to a couple other people that helped me defend them a couple times. It’s all in timing. And I server hopped a few times until I found one that met my needs.
---
Yup, minigun weights 14.4 pounds, combat rifle 14.98 lb.  Even if both had mods up the wazoo the rifle has nowhere near the metal mass of a minigun which looks like it should be mounted on a chopper or a tank or godzilla.....
---
It might not 'feel' bad if we had rifle weight reduction perks but nope.....
---
Yeah, alot of the community seems to feel similar. Personally I'd prefer a hardcore mode where legendarys are disabled. Think it would make for way more interesting and drawn out engagements. Because as is, balancing the obscene pool of effects is a nightmare.
---
I found mine in the level 3 safe inside Free States Bunker.
---
Oh I would have no problem with it either if AA worked. But you know there will be people crying rivers if they see any kind of nerf/rollback. 
---
Just seems like that could be avoided if they could fix AA or admit they can't and remove AA energy legendaries from dropping.
---
I like Bethesda and this game, but it's weird how the policy seems to have changed from "only cosmetic items" to "only items that don't provide a competitive advantage".  
---
If you're playing on Adventure Mode (in my experience, most people are), there's almost no competition in this game. If they added a "teleport cost no caps" perk that could only be obtained through the atom shop, it wouldn't give any competitive advantage to the user, but still would be kinda... not cool, right? It would be a "convenience option" - you could argue that then you won't be spending money to teleport and that's an advantage, but you aren't spending materials to repair either.  
---
I think this is a dangerous path to walk and not the right way to do things. I'm sure they can make a lot of money if they keep adding cool new models (not reskins, models) for weapons, armors etc. I hope this stops at the repair kits.
---
Okay well at least I have an idea of where to go now. Thank you.
---
that is very welcome news, the gift emote will cost something though i guess?
---
*locked safe lv3
---
I think, more accurately, the low-level versions of the Mothman and Flatwoods Monster flee from you.
---
I didn't know that. Noone thought that was something out of order?
---
No pacifist mode!
---
Yeah, camps prevent spawns. At least based on my own observations and other people's observations on this sub.
---
Good luck out there!
---
Absolutely. 
---
I think it would result in smaller, more portable CAMPs, the need to carry everything would create a natural cap-sink, as the cost to move one's CAMP would keep money limits reasonable. The inability to fast travel to every train station/vendor would mean players  can't spend hours grinding junk to sell... and the economy issue would naturally solve itself. 
---
Rewards for player kills would be reasonable... as players *would* be carrying junk pretty much at all times.
---
I think it would make character builds more sensible, too, and allow for greater *viable* builds.
---
Players would naturally congregate around certain areas (towns, vendors, train stations, workshops), ensuring that the game wouldn't be an empty expanse of chance encounters.
---
Basically... a mode for players who want more than vanilla PvE, but don't want the Death Match WWE Royal Rumble aspect of Survival mode. A game for the Fallout fans that want to survive in the wasteland, essentially.
---
Ooh, yeah I have to agree with you there, that would be really interesting. And yeah, agreed, total nightmare. That's why I stay out of PVP unless I have a workshop owned
---
I just did this, I spent DAYS searching for the jet pack for my X-01 jet pack and even more days searching for the calibrated shocks... I lost it all and I lost days... that’s what hurts. All the days of server hopping
---
Oh I bet Nuka Dark would be great!
---
This. I think it replaces trade emote. I had trouble figuring it out too. I think you go down a press right bumper on xbox
---
What overseer? Still have found her. Ugh.
---
Except there’s no Medium version in the game, and the recon markers don’t show up while scoped... but otherwise, sure
---
It's worded differently than the other material collection challenges we've had, too. They have all been worded, "Scrap junk to produce X" or something like that.
---
Given you have 5 slots with 3 permutations possible each on top of the base, you have room to fit in lots of stuff. Do you want to push offense (unyielding, AP refresh, etc.), defense (damage reducers) or utility (weight reduction, auto-stim, chameleon, etc.)?
---
did read the news but you never know with bethesda, just wanted to be sure in order to be ready when i do get my internet back
---
that last one is unlikely, enemies will always spawn to attack your camp from time to time
---
I’ve held Posiedon 3 times in the past week, for hours at a time, not once was I griefed... maybe because  I’m 200+?
---
*scared moth noises
---
I mean no natural spawns, like not next to a super mutant infested gas station
---
Seems pretty random, I have most of them but some have eluded me all week. Namely the electrified staff and heavy staff plans. I got the electrified staff plans but it unlocked the electrified mod for the club instead. Got video proof and pictures that it’s incorrectly named
---
don't forget about the wattz rifle and pistol! maybe even a colt 6250 for vault 13 aesthetics :P
---
Just... build your base 3x3, leaving the centre foundation block out?
---
Or am I missing something?
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Keep in mind their is also a weight limit. Once that is reached, it stops producing until you've taken the waters.
---
oof!  and you were just trying to help him out! sorry that happened to ya
---
I just want any sort of armor penetration to work for them so they can atleast be more of an option endgame than they are now
---
I use bloody mess at max rank and I still have body's doing this but it's more the legendary's that dissappear into the floor with just a blood mark left.
---
Get the spotlight and connect it to a terminal (if you have the plans) then go on the terminal and select it to target enemies, I haven't lost a single turret to anything except the occassional SB since I did it.
---
Because it would just create a junk mine... where you could wander off and just wait for shit to amass in the surrounding area.
---
maybe they could focus on making the existing pistols actually viable
---
Ah, silly me was just looking under R for Repair. Thanks.
---
Should have options to hide elements on the HUD
---
Gt? If I'm on around those times, I'd travel around.
---
I had one accross the road from Sutton station vicinity when I was leveling. 
---
Pretty flat and near a train station. Did get some low level enemies though.
---
&gt;The best way to complete that is to call a cargobot with a holotape , wait to drop the crate and then snap the picture
---
I want thermal optics so I can feel like The Predator 
---
"Want some candy?"
---
Not unless you also tag them at the same time, you don't.
---
I've got my base at one of the cow spawns and it seems to pop way more then an hour and a half. I'd say maybe 20 min. Tho I play almost strictly survival so it might be different here.
---
I’ve been selling the built crooks for.... nothing, I’ve never sold one. The modded clubs have been going for 500-750. Modded staffs for 1k each. Plans usually 1-2k. Next Burning Barbed Staff plan I get I probably won’t sell for less than 5k though, same if I ever get a duplicate electrified staff plan
---
Like a workshop?
---
On the dead tourists.
---
wait what ? I quit playing .. Are they nerfing Exploding again ?
---
Yeah near a station is a pretty good idea!
---
Have not even bothered trying to find the camera, nor do I care to take pictures and waste precious 3* legenday killing time. If I wanted to take pictures I'd do it outside the game or Play Pokemon Snap.
---
I can sell you the actual weapon on PS4
---
Not a paradox.
---
The T-60 was originally meant to be a redesign of the T-45d in the Fallout 4 engine but ended up looking different enough that they made it a new model. In Fallout 4 it’s got better stats than the T-51b. In 76 the T-51b now has higher overall stats but the T-60 is cheaper to repair.
---
Fallout 4s loading screens mention that T-51b was the pinnacle of PA, but the T-60 was the last model made.
---
So given this and the T-60 looks more like the T-45d it’s reasonable to assume that not only was the T-60 designed as a cheaper to produce upgrade to the 45d more larger and far better armored and energy efficient that the 45d. Without using the expensive, harder to source ceramics that the 51b needed. It’s also reasonable to think that many T-60 models were actually retrofitted T45d suits and would explain why the eastern BOS in Fallout 4 has so many suits.
---
It’s mentioned that after defeating the Enclave at the airbase in Fallout 3 the Brotherhood gained the ability to build new suits of power armor. But given they had a full compliment of T-45d it would make sense to upgrade all their suits first.
---
What IS a paradox is that in Fallout 76 the only BOS paint jobs are for the T-60 where as the WV BOS were all T-51b. It bothers me that they didn’t make a BOS paint for 51b and still haven’t.
---
Another thing that bothers me is the lack of power armor perks so to speak. In 3 and New Vegas different PA had different stat changes like T-45d would hinder your agility but add to your strength. I think each PA should have things like that.
---
Where is the dead tourist??
---
Yeah, I had a random Tesla Rifle with it and I wasn't that impressed with the lobbing one.
---
I would love that gun.  The explosive shotguns aren't being nerfed again.  They are fixing a bug that gives it 100% extra damage instead of the 20% from the nerf ages ago.  I've personally never had this bug.  My shotgun does like 400 damage and it reflects that correctly.  It did 1200 pre nerf.
---
Yeah I don’t think the lobbing barrel is really a mine... more of a small DoT AoE. Haven’t played with it much though. I just found a (shotgun?) lobbing barrel. I think it shoots 3 or 4 electric balls in a small spread, but I didn’t try it on enemies much
---
I have a lvl 15 Assassin's Explosive laser I found a long time ago and it just annoys me that it's so low level. I wish I could level it up to use in Survival.
---
What kind of perks do you use with your explosive laser?
---
I'm pretty sure that's why players hate people who set up camps at the white spring golf course. You get tons of exp for mowing down lots of ghouls.
---
Have it connected to a power switch and turn it off when going into Survival Mode
---
They forgot to nerf TSE shotties.
---
I have one so I'm a bit upset about it
---
Yeah. It still wasn't showing up on the wheel, but I figured it out. Thanks.
---
Yep. Thanks!
---
I'd say make it so there are toggable options to hide certain elements on the HUD and even an optional n to hide everything.
---
Thanks for the help guys. Do you know how many it can produce before it stops, by the way?
---
There are two of them, I’ve personally found them at the grave yard near the wandering palace, the statue of the mothman on the west side of the map, and on the car in front of you when you FT to the white springs resort. Just search for tourist in this sub, there’s a pretty nice list.
---
Might just be typos
---
It'd be cool to have a bonus to the nuka cola and nuka quantum paint jobs but they wouldn't be able to add a bonus to the nuka shine as it's a atom shop item. That would break they're p2w promise they made.
---
Yep. Found it. Thanks.
---
You don't really need to be easy to find, once you have the kiosk at your CAMP you're going to show up on the map. Between WS and West Tek would probably be a good region, as it's not far to travel from well trod stomping grounds.
---
No, they are fixing explosive shotgun, it wasn't reduced to +20% DMG apparently
---
Yea but after seeing the weapons coming up they are really bad except the bloodied death claw gauntlet and even then you might be tempted not to do it with legendary vendor coming out 5/16.
---
No. Explosive shotguns have been broken since that particular nerf. Bassically every gun but shotguns had a reduction to 20% while shotguns maintained the original 100% extra damage. They are finally fixing that and making explosive work the same way for shotguns as it does for everything else.
---
Figure it oot, bud
---
I've never seen a camp at WS. It seems silly given how much it gets nuked.
---
Yeah, but the junk extractors have a limit to how fast and how much they're gonna create.
---
Being able to sit back and let wave after wave of enemies die by your turrets... so you can go loot their corpses after every wave... it'd be too much. and it would flat out destroy any in-game economy.
---
if you are on pc and need a hand you can add me, i'm on most days , nick is Ciwawa
---
I anecdotally feel like it takes way more resources to repair stuff now, such that I end up doing most of my repairs at Whitesprings, where I can buy whatever junk I need.
---
Make a little shed?
---
5 each purifier.
---
Yeah I've had plenty of times where the bots have been right in front of me and I've snapped a whole clip of film and it still hasnt counted.
---
Whatever would look good in a cafe/bar?
---
Not sure. When you go to collect it has option for take and transfer.  Do transfer, then bottom of list should indicate weight limit. Then do some math, how much does each purified water weight? Remember this would be base value, not what it weights for you with all the weight reduction perks.
---
There was an alien blaster with the Purveyor place so perhaps there's a chance they will become viable? Just a though.
---
I seriously hate Mothmen. They creep me the hell out.
---
Same.
---
Sure that's true, but you have to find and use acid.   I'd rather just get the scrap and be done with it.
---
The emote was free, pretty sure.
---
Saw one earlier. I did my damnedest to kite a scorchbeast over from the fissure to it but the bloody thing kept giving up just before.
---
two shot, the gun is faulty and shoots an extra bullet
---
Anti-scorched, the ammo are made out of ultracite
---
dual and quad, the magazine is modded
---
instigating, you take the enemy by surprise, so it takes more damage 
---
for the others i can't find an excuse lol
---
i said you can make all 3 in hour and half
---
It's free now.  I have a feeling it will remain that way because it was a common request that really needed to be added.
---
Dude, go one handed, way more perk cards to use.
---
It's little things like this that make me love this game. Sure it's got its bugs and issues, but there are so many cool little things that happen organically that make it feel really special.
---
Should’ve said easy to get to because I doubt it’ll allow you to camps on the map
---
It would probably be OP... add it anyway.
---
Is there a similar list around for the Biv dailies? So I know when I can stop doing them lol
---
It's been good for months, so if you didn't like it last month you probably wont like it this month.
---
I know the club one.
---
i'm very happy, thank you all for helping me out
---
Happened to me. But checking my pipboy always fixes it.
---
You can pick the locks
---
just saw a post about this a few mins ago, but yeah, agreed. especially the original colt 6250 and wattz laser weapons
---
Just a couple helpful hints, you don’t have to claim a workshop to spawn the vertibot and the camera has to have the name of whatever you’re taking a picture of in the top right corner of your viewfinder.
---
Can we just remember that everyone is gonna be doing the same thing in the same places. So we all may have to hope several times before our camp will load. Stay sane people.
---
There's a pretty good flat spot across the road from the top of the world train station - it is next to a road but it's a little hidden by trees - but with the vending machine active people will find your camp easily. This is a pretty good spot imo because the Top of the world is a big quest hub so you'll probably get some traffic.
---
that's a good point, but i don't wanna be overkill, i can easily hammer down any mob in the game already. i would like to get to about 50ish more damage per hit but anything above that would make the game boring in a team. considering this, which weapon of those two you think is better?
---
Events are almost always the way to go in my opinion.  Ammo, plans, crafting mats, and aid oh my. Plus I encounter way more 3* legendaries doing events than I ever did at the whitespring or west tech.  Just make sure to mix it up and you will be surprised how effective it is.
---
Am I the only one who’d prefer that they didn’t try to make it canon  so they could put everything in it and not worry?
---
Definitely want the gun runners arsenal back, plus the cowboy themed stuff was great for role-playing.
---
Yup there is! Many vendors sell different mod plans. But the one that sells the most is the bos vendor in watoga. The escavator power armor plans are in a vendor in grafton (not grafton station).
---
Definitely get enforcer under agility. Would also recommend the shotgunner perks and scatter shot under strength.
---
Already feels like enough of a spin off that I'm surprised that tried so hard to shoehorn it in.
---
The best way it to spawn one at a workshop via Poseidon energy, the ammo factory, or wade airport.
---
Am I the only one who finds it funny that he has 8 bullets in a double barreled shotgun?
---
Go to fo76market
---
I have everything but those two. Just wsmt to find the plans.
---
Yes but your comment literally has nothing to do with the post so please be like a moth and fly off
---
You can pick the locks or you know- just message them. 
---
I messaged someone that I wanted to see inside their camp and they came right over and opened it up. I should have taken pics because it's gotta be one of the cutest lil camps I've ever seen but oh well.
---
if it is un owned and already set up, pick the locks on the stuff. free loot.
---
Sentinel is good for everything
---
go play survival
---
Have you ever been to WV? There's a reason people are fleeing the state.
---
Most flat spots are pretty easy to get to, though. If you were on top of Seneca Rocks you might have an issue with visitors, but otherwise there aren't really difficult to get to places. If I were you, I'd go over and wander around until you find a spot you like. If you want to stick to roads, you can always walk them and find somewhere that feels good. 
---
You gotta remember though, a lot of people are going to want to be near the centers of popular spots, so if you stick yourself right next to the WS train, as an example, you're probably going to be competing with lots of other players for your spot. Being a little more off the beaten track might be beneficial to actually being able to place your CAMP on a server.
---
Just not a fan of it, want to make crazy designs with water purifiers in my bar section or next to the coaches but in the end of the day I just want them to either remove restrictions on normal water purifiers or make them behave like artillery where they need either dirt or foundations to work.
---
At the Whitespring, working on it already!
---
That's just factually wrong, though.
---
No fuck that I want whitesprings to become a true player city.
---
Really hate wasting my build budget on that and rather its placed inside my house for easy access.
---
Not sure what you mean by out of placed, but it was supposedly made after T51 and therefore more advanced, but the Damage resistance is worse overall.
---
I would be so nice if they worked while scoped in.
---
Shit no. If I have to watch my back 24/7, and have my wits about me... the LAST thing I want is vision full of tracers, or to be focus-distracted by the sound of frogs in a babbling brook.
---
Hell no.
---
I’d like to add, two water purifiers are all you need. I log on, get the water, then playing for few hours, if I’m low on water I stop by my camp. But usually at the end of few hours gameplay I got like 30 purified water to sell to vendors.
---
Haven't noticed such a thing. 
---
But, I will try it when I get home today. Will report back.
---
I had an AA/E hunting rifle and traded it for 3 amazing pieces. You aren't wrong about it's unicorn status.
---
Unowned workshops arn't producing, even if its all powered and ready to use!
---
Nixie clocks. Stack them on top of each other and make the bar out of them. 
---
Or just one on a corner against the wall.
---
I have been. People are fleeing because many of the jobs which were in fossil fuels are no longer around thanks to the last president. What else ya got for me?
---
Its not your Xbox rest assured.... hell making soup and tea will crash the game. there is a new one on the PC if you are holding the camera and use an emote it teleports you to the other side of the map.
---
Play everyday. Login. Turrets firing. I run around and scoop up the goodies. Never tag them.
---
I'd like to see the ability to find out who's camp it is you're looking at without having to find the original device
---
I want the shiskebab buffed. I would also like a skin that makes it look like a regular katana blade.
---
I have the perfect spot for you, I’m going to DM you
---
No, more coal jobs have been lost under the current president than the last one. And WV has experienced a shrinking population for many years longer than that.
---
This would definitely be to my tastes.
---
Also small no-collision rocks and mounds of dirt to help "sink" some objects into the nature a little bit so we can have a lot more room for creative immersion instead of having to look at gravity-defying workbenches, etc. (or just allow us to sink stuff like 10% into the ground; that works too).
---
The most annoying right now is the game consumes bullets when you logout and into another server. Especially on the gatlin or handmade which can carry quite a bit. I've got used to logging out with a melee weapon but it's annoying.
---
Downvote for saying my turrets work? They defend my camp, I get the loot.
---
Huh. The never have a thing on 'em for me, unless I've gotten off at least a shot on them.
---
If you wanna be really sneaky, check if they have any crafting stations up against windows. You can warp inside that way.
---
(This is also a tip for anyone with crafting stations next to their windows who don't want intruders)
---
Spotted the console guy
---
Whiskey, cigarettes and beer bottles just like every fallout game. I think that's developers past time. Everyone needs a break now and then.
---
Hush! Dont start to use logic in here!
---
but seriously this needs to be a thing ...
---
Happened to me as well, it needs to appear in the top right corner , otherwise the camera doesn't know what are you photographing. If is out of focus or with zoom it won't work either.    
---
Simply, you need to channel your inner Peter Parker to snap a good picture
---
Just sneak a peek through the window like a normal person.
---
....
---
that's normal right?
---
With the camera out, if you emote you get flung to your characters left side. The fling is similar to hitting a golf ball the distance of a nuke zone. If there’s a mountain to your left, you may hit it and stop. Or you could hit something in front of it and ricochet in another direction. You’ll sometimes get launched up in the air too. Wearing two pieces of legendary armor that reduces damage by 50% negates fall damage, making this glitch usable to your advantage since you can’t die from it. Alternatively, use the goat legs perk card to survive most falls. The game will have problems loading areas if you fly too far, so sometimes you’ll get a glitchy-seeming loading screen. There’s a lot to this glitch, most don’t know you can use it to your advantage by lining yourself up the right way before using it.
---
Ooooh… that  gives me an idea. Water pipe that works like power connectors/wire.
---
Bethesda... give me plumbing, dammit.
---
where's the cave located?
---
I only lock my bedroom just in case i'm in there getting funky with myself everything else is free to use
---
Ok but where is it? let us see it, cut it and paste mate! we wanna know :P
---
You need One Gun Army too.  Stagger defeats Sentinel builds.
---
Memorable!
---
Someone may have been stashing them there for later. 🎊
---
You can check if they have turrets but I think that's the only thing besides the camp itself.
---
they know we are all a bunch of assholes
---
DO NOT meet the overseer!! She kicked me in the balls then destroyed my camp with a nuke.
---
#LIBERTY PRIME
---
&lt; Heavy patriotic breathing intensifies &gt;
---
I do the same. 
---
It’s the muties and scorched who fire ranged weapons like rifles at my turrets but when the light shines on them it’s pretty decent.
---
I wouldn’t say they couldn’t cut it..but Bethesda did this..there is no reason for any raider to play in survival..there are no rewards..the glory and rewards in Adventure mode are far more lucrative..
---
Being a raider myself not a griefer there is a difference a major one..you want to be mad at someone then blame Bethesda
---
absolutely
---
I will try that, it sounds fairly easy, thank you
---
[Where there’s a will, there’s a way!](https://youtu.be/nCP-tc1TK-k)
---
I don't mind the trapper stuff. I hate the regular raider stuff with the face cover thing. Looks like shit.
---
No, if you don’t like PVP (and I don’t) then stay off Survival and don’t take workshops.
---
I think he's adorable
---
Get they night eyes perk. Made wandering around the mire at night a shit ton easier.
---
I've removed almost all doors from my camp just to encourage people to come see it. I've spent weeks on it, hunting rare camp plans and tweeking things to look better. Still, the few visitors I've had have never bother going inside. I can't wait for player vending. Then they HAVE to come inside.
---
but you can still pick the producers and take what was left over in them without getting wanted, since it belongs to no one
---
I'm still yet to be online when one violent night triggers, or I've not paid attention. I'll have to hang out at the location one day and see what goes down. I'll have to dig my death tambo out if storage first though.
---
"Hey buddy...wanna buy some lamps?"
---
Again, nothing to loot.
---
Just do a vats critical on the fusion core when fighting. Goes down in one shot for me.

Mfw my AAE hunting rifle is level 40 :/

The rewards are the same as that mode just less of it, just they don't have to worry about bigger fish taking them out!
---
I want 100 caps for something?
---
Charge 111 caps.
---
#CAPITALISM
---
Good to hear thank you!
---
Out of curiosity, why roads? Not judging or anything. (After all, I prefer mine on high cliff ledges.) But there are plenty if places that offer natural protection areas for either dirt or water based purifiers, so as not to waste resources.
---
 Directly south of Monongah, for instance has rockwalls close to both sides of the road and might offer you the best of both worlds.
---
Varesk what platform are you on? I’m on pc and always willing to help !
---
Think of all that nonstop anxiety. Chances are, this was how they relieved stress besides plowing a few brahmin.
---
No the rewards were cut dramatically any player that is above lvl 100 that is a raider there is no reason for them to play survival they have nothing to gain from it
---
A Light Shining In Darkness, the 1911 .45 automatic, yes, yes please.
---
It's up on the hill directly west of hawkes refuge. I'm standing on it in this screenshot. There's some wire fencing around it and it's right next to where the hills start to go down to the east.

Can someone link me a vault tec u courtyard idk where to take the pic

I'd hate it but that's only be my camps there in a pretty decent spot
---
Where did you find it?
---
Giant every kind of boss would be pretty epic
---
As a young'un running around the mountains, seeing that Mothman pop up scared enough bejeesus out of me that it could have been level one and I'd a still taken off. LOL
---
you still picked up the duped items, which is still valid and fair reason to ban you, mate.
---
The bar set looks great so get the full set from the atom store, the letters and Signs plan costs a lot of caps but is worth it. Some of the beer signs / lights were on offer last I checked.
---
Curious to know how much dmg you’re at right now. I’m two handed melee and using All Rise. It’s always fun to wail away on groups of charging ghouls with it.
---
"I just wanted to take a picture with the human!"
---
You're losing a tiny amount of damage that will still one shot most enemies and players with head shots.  I'd buy/trade a lvl 40 version in a heartbeat.  Very, very ferocious effects that only plebs ignore with the idea that top level is the only option.  I was using a TS/E/reload lvl 35 handmade for quite a while before the nerf and it was a cheddar factory even on the SBQ.
---
I hope you’re right!
---
It didn’t sound like they were disabling lock picking, just destruction.
---
Gotta purge the cooties from all that filthy Sheepsquatch fanfic.
---
Not as much now that the camp boundaries have changed. Massive camps right across from the golf course all the time. Very annoying.
---
Out of curiosity, what are the liberators saying when it shows "speaking in Chinese" ?
---
Happens to me a lot, I usually keep a stealth boy mk 3 and use it in the pipboy menu to undo it, may work with stimpaks and such too anyway to cancel the animation of that emote.
---
How many players did you kill with that gun?
---
They're so tasty!
---
*MOTHMAN SEES ALL*
---
*NOTHING CAN ESCAPE HIS ALL SEEING EYES*
---
Only if we can get a Liberator army singing Cara Mia.  And maybe an an Animal King variant.
---
its actually gonna be great. keeps pests who want to break your stuff from doing so just to force PVP
---
It does. If I'm point blank blasting myself my armor breaks quickly. White Knight helps.

Where's the sheepsquatch unarmed weapon. :( Was it cut? &lt;\3

Looted it there today

You’re right, I was thinking of the photo mode pose Looking to the Future
---
What's on the body?
---
I try to avoid pvp for the most part, simply because I'm in the low 60s, mostly solo play and don't have great gear. I play on normal mode obviously.
---
That said I also need fusion cores and am prepared to throw down because there's literally a pop up that says this is opening me to pvp. 
---
Be stealthy, don't just sit in front of the core machine, sit a safe enough distance away that you can either engage in your terms or slip away if the situation looks unfavorable. Watch your map. Build actual defenses (rocket turrets, laser turrets).
---
If you don't have the perks, levels, gear or resources to defend your broadcasted pvp event then that's not on the people that show up to brawl, that's on you.
---
EQUALLY PRIME!
---
I just did that as you described and it worked thank you
---
I stupidly traded mine for an instigating/explosive lever gun, only to figure out that the lack of anti-armor mag mods on the lever gun drastically reduced the single headshot ability I could deliver on high level armored opponents, not to mention that the explosive effect would damage nearby mobs and negate the instigating damage.  I'm still hunting for an instigating hunting rifle with +10% aiming damage or +50% limb damage.
---
Camera spawn
---
I hope we get a "Chinese Invasion" storyline at some point where the Liberators play a larger role, and we'll probably see a boss version or two as well.
---
Hell yeah, they remind me of the big egg guys from platypus. Bonus points for anybody who remembers that game
---
indeed it is, especially because i need to take the aggro off my friends and a swing of that does wonders in that regard. at the moment i sit around 340 per swing but if i take some drugs and stuff i can easily reach 450 if needed.
---
the huge problem were schorchbeasts, but for those i took some perks without having to respec a single point, now if i see one i jump in my power armor to take advantage of the stabilized perk and cripple those fuckers down so we can have a chat face to face. another thing i'm enjoying a lot is pain train, it feels awesome to charge in when a mob is killing a friend, i can stun the mob and heal my friend very quickly and i love it
---
Rule #3 , I think. "No Meme posts." 'Cause if you allow photos, memes will follow.
---
Possibly. I really get nothing from most legendaries so to me, everything except exterminator pipe wrench is legacy.
---
To be fair, I got the daisy cutter (2 shot Fat man). The first time I pulled it out a vengeful mothman pops up in front of me.  I fire the fat man at him...
---
 I die instantly and lose all my junk
---
Well, isn't that a shame.  Then, you have to respect when someone locks their fucking door.
---
Take your camera out and snap a pic of the rewards
---
Me too! I spend a lot of time working on my camp and I'm looking forward to other people having a look at it!
---
Is there a rarity of them? I've done around 15 and all I got is  Recipe: Mutton Meat Pie
---
I'd love to see the p90 from 2.
---
Oh my god the first time my hud showed MK V (before I saw the model) I thought I was in for this. 
---
So down!
---
Floating bushes though? I'd like to see the floating razorgrain fixed first.
---
Disappointing to see bethesda have such little transparently about this issue and how its being adressed. Its even more disappointing to see how low the FO76 community acts to anyone they deem as a "duper". 
---
Ive never duped but was targed by [4:8:2000], still havnt gotten any help from bethesda after 3 months and still waiting. Why is it so difficult to dump/delete all items in question from characters invintorys and reactivate accounts. Every other large game producers do it that way and continue on, but bethesda drags it out.
---
Lets be honest, bethesda games on release are glitchy/broken and push the boundaries and for alot of us thats why we love them. FO76 was broken .... very very broken, people took advantage of it.  Bethesda fixed the probelm very well but they continue to drag out a "fix". 
---
Look i think duped items should be deleted even lock characters in question until its looked into but to lock the whole game is not right. You dont even have the option to create a new character and start new its as if bethesda is taking its 80$ game back. 
---
Boo bethesda help your customers back online safely and put all this duping nonsense to sleep once and for all.
---
Yeah, I’d like that too but thought I’d aim a little lower, if you know what I mean.
---
I have bloody mess on and it happens anyways
---
If the legendary vendor has a way to turn non-legendary items into legendary I will scream with happy. That'll make so many things useful (all crafts, items like Scout Armor or Enclave plasma).
---
Legendary Propaganda Flyer
---
Thanks for the link. Man... I hope they do the whole junk decoration option. You can collect bobbleheads in 76?
---
Giving us a junk dectoration option would be easy to implement. Half their work is done for them via Fallout 4 mods. All they need do is tweek the **OCDecorator** or **Make Static** mods and then we can just have a _place object_ option. Easy. No conflict.
---
I'm not sure, it still mostly performs like a pistol, because stock alone isn't that impactful. I doubt it will make pistols able to compete with anything, because you are still using perks to boost something that has poor base stats.
---
I suppose that the fact that most rifle perks are in Perception and pistols are in Agility means that you could get 60%+60% damage and a few other perks, maybe from luck and make build around crits or sth. You would have to have like 1 strength tho, but could be doable maybe with backpacks?
---
It was never in the game in the first place. The only thing I can think of is the deathclaw gauntlet skin that was in the trailer and that's a brahmin skull
---
What tools did you use in your research if you don't mind me asking websites things like that how did you search up the individual state laws how they handled taxes and such
---
Bought the bar set and it does look really good!
---
I'd like to see an actual Big Iron :/
---
I agree, and I'm still happy to have it since it's probably the best legendary roll I've ever gotten.
---
Exactly. Im leveling my alt atm just because i want a zero power armor pistol gunslinger and its a nightmare.
---
Yes. You are probably someone who made an alt and already suffered releveling and want others to have to do the same. Well shame on you.
---
Current state of the game, no not at all. Things are not very reroll friendly in terms of starting a new character and gathering plans etc, and the player base seems smallish so allowing people to move back and forth prevents dead world servers.
---
If things are better optimized in the future in regard to balance and endgame longevity (better perk respec, etc) then sure the two modes should be exclusive.
---
Just sent a request but you're showing offline on my list so i can't join you, thanks for trying
---
In.
---
So the guns from NV really?
---
Request sent
---
Not easier, simpler. Hate this generic response. 
---
Its not even a argument. Its simplifying a bad feature. The game isnt "hard" because plans are rare, the game is slower. There's a difference. You wanna extend play time in a bad way?
---
Especially when talking alts, we know where shit is and have a main who can buy it and send it over. Its just a waste of resources and time on our mains so our alts can have it.
---
Don't pretend this is a hard competitive game, its not, it never was, it never will be.
---
Whats wrong with you
---
I've been running an unyielding build similar to this, with a bloody PF and a zealot exploding handmade. It's so fun to use the PF, I find that I only use the rifle for large groups of low level enemies. 
---
Strength - I think you really want 15 points here. First, because strength = damage, and second because of carry weight.  I'd recommend Iron Fist, Barbarian, Incisor, Blocker and Martial Arts all  x 3
---
Perception looks good; for me, I got rid of the rifle perks, so I could run around with locksmith x 3.  
---
Endurance - Fireproof 2 or 3 is the difference between running from Scorch Beasts and running to them.  I've not found ghoulish to be that useful. I think you may need some points here. 
---
Charisma - Tenderizer and Suppressor - you might want to plug these back in for SBQ events, but for just running around, since you kill stuff so fast with bloodied weapons, these points might be better put into Inspirational or into Endurance or Strength.
---
Intelligence - Gunsmith - I see this as a perk for camp, gathering the mats to repair weapons isn't that hard. I like nerd rage. I think I'd bring Intelligence down to 3 or 5 depending on how much gunsmith you need, and put the points into Endurance or Strength. Of course you'll want to have Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan available for camp.
---
Agility - I haven't used Marathoner at all, but in non-PA build I really like having Dodgy. Obviously White Knight for camp.
---
Luck - that's what I run. Super Duper for camp.
---
Speak for yourself, Im more of a dick.
---
Oh gosh, imagine that, not everything given to you.  I don't know of a single video game where you unlock everything in one character and it's unlocked for every alt character you make.
---
You're thinking about Robobrains, they used to use the Sentry drop table, but was changed to have their own table without fusion drops.
---
Sentries still drop fusion cores.
---
I've read some say that turning in multiples at a time (2+) gives better odds.
---
I have nothing to support that, just that I've seen a few people mention that.
---
Impractical for real life you say...
---
https://www.keltecweapons.com/firearms/pistols/plr16/
---
Wow does that for all rep things now and i can craft and mail anything i want to my alts.
---
They would need to add at least 2 legendary attach points as wood armor currently only has 1 which is why it only drops as a 1 star
---
Thanks, I've read the same, still no joy
---
Quest from the Raider Chieftan, titled *"Murder She Wrote..."*
---
:( ... It sounded good in my head, but now that it's typed, I really don't know where to go from there! lol
---
I hope so, when the game first came out I'd hoped we could build proper settlements...was kinda disappointed when I saw how far apart camps have to be.
---
Trying through party. It seems to be fine on my end. I could join you. I won't. That'd defeat the purpose.
---
There's a difference between simpler and more replayable. Sorry if I like my games to have some sort of replay value...
---
Hell why do I have to do all the quests over again when I start a new character? That's your argument bud. It is easier.
---
Dang I must be doing something wrong cuz I’m only hitting 310 undrugged. That’s with max perk on all the slugger cards and 18 in strength. I don’t do PA tho. I have max ironclad perk and a bit into white knight so that helps out with taking damage. But I have adrenaline and with after killing a few enemies I was hitting 410 with no drugs. I usually don’t have issues with my group not getting xp and me hogging it all as they’ll get some pot shots while I’m running around attracting attention and I’ll sweep in for lethal damage. Sounds like you’re like me and hesitant to put down the sledge. I tried one handed and it just doesn’t do it for me like All Rise. Go with your gut.
---
Don't blame the shooter, blame the gun manufacturer!!
---
Punxsutawney Phil
---
Honestly... I don’t think this item is worth the effort. If you’re on PS4 I’ll sell you mine.
---
Yes it's the nukashine paint on T-51 armour.
---
I used to be a government contractor in North Virginia, and the amount of people who commute to work there and in DC was staggering. Felt like 1/4th of the company lived in WV and drove in each day.
---
Probably haven't gotten on so idk what the challenge is atm.
---
That's universal. Does it on consoles too.
---
Oh no they won't be getting hundreds of caps per kill plus a giant pool of chems,  then why are they settling for the 50 caps for baiting a low level forest workshop!
---
I've been doing it almost daily since beta and I haven't gotten any so yeah it's tough
---
Lol, I feel your pain. I found a TSE assault rifle 2 days before the nerf just enough time to see what I was missing.
---
RNG is ridiculous man, there's a guy on market76 who's found multiple elder paints, it's ridiculous
---
could you tell us what they say? i think i once heard on say "leave us alone" but I'm not sure
---
"President Eckhart would like to... see you... in his office to discuss your... posting performance." &lt;/modus&gt;
---
Nah bro i'm on ps4 as him and had no trouble at all just like you.  Hell i even did the behemoth/hound challenge!
---
Knowing the map and the mechanics inside out might be a factor.
---
For the picture of people you just ask people. I had a guy i traded with only once,asked him to help me for a daily and now we help each other daily for most of them.
---
Everytime I've tried to buy them I get downvoted. I eventually just deleted the posts.
---
I got mine for an aa/lmb dmg lever, marine sentinel piece, and one other gun. I felt it was a fair trade
---
That launches volleys of the smaller ones at you?  Hells yes.
---
That's beautiful but I was kind of expecting it to get kinky.
---
Like when does Fisto come to deliver a pizza?
---
Good to know one the IE lever. That was something I had my eye on.   I was thinking maybe a quad explosive lever is my next chase. Although I do like the vats legendary stuff
---
This could’ve been a nice constructive post
---
With hookers and blackjack.
---
Paladin Toaster
---
i think the difference in damage can be explained by herd mentality + strange in numbers, i sit between 21 and 23 strenght depending on of one or both team members are online. om top of that i also have a couple of pieces of armor that give +3 special if at full health, which i always am because i spam stimpacks for my buddies.
---
power armor is just for those weird cases where i need the heavy gun, if not i'm doing fine with barbarian, ironclad and junk shield. if you don't do guns i would really consider to buy twisted muscles, that is a thing of beauty.
---
and yes, you are correct, the feeling of hammering stuff in the face is very very pleasing, the axe is nice but it just doesn't feel as nice when smashing stuff
---
Campfires. Abuse their power til it gets fixed.
---
No. You can have a character that has not completed the BoS questline also loot containers and they will stack. But the character that has the Forbidden Knowledge quest trigger when one is picked up can only carry one at a time.
---
No, I jump into survival to get the weekly challenge done.
---
oh god i can't stop laughing XD
---
...at band camp.
---
Yeah, which makes me grip the AAE Lever Action rifle I found on a freaking vendor even tighter.  Fools!!!!!
---
I’ll check this evening, I may have some. 
---
My psn is the same as my u/
---
Did you buy the plan a second time if it shows as unknown? Heard that can work
---
If it's not a Missile Turret it's crap.  All the other turrets can't do crap.
---
&gt;Do they actually vanish or do they just turn into a blood pile? 
---
I did Line in the Sand earlier, and figured I'd collect the loot from the Scorched I killed at the end of it. I killed at least 30 or so Scorched, and there was about 5-6 meat piles. The bodies and meat piles vanished, unable to be looted.
---
Maybe I'll send my build as well the next time I post. Contrary to the apparently common belief, I do know how to set up a designated build...
---
The hotel underwent mandatory renovations and the robots kicked out all the staff and guests, renovated the rooms and now refuse to accept guests until paperwork from the state building inspector (I think that’s what Stratford, the general manager Handy says, at least). It’s all on the various terminals in the hotel. Personally, I think The Ironclad Service program (robots) was a ploy by the Enclave to keep people from getting nosy about the bunker. The golf course redesign might have also been cover for the bunker being built. 
---
I suspect eventually there will be a quest to retrieve the paperwork to reopen the whitespring.
---
Its got Green Lantern powerz
---
I really want to see the Winchester P-94 "Plasma Caster", the plasma rifle from Fallout 1,2, and NV make a return!
---
From what I've read you need to know Initiate before the others will drop  ... and Initiate doesn't drop anymore.
---
It didn't occur to me until now that you could totally build some kind of "trap CAMP" where the vending machine is only available if you pass through a series of challenges.
---
I also tried using the Camera a few days ago when the Impostor Sheepsquach died and went invisible for everyone and was able to locate and loot it as were others when I told them it was in front of me.
---
Presentatial office?
---
I use mine almost exclusively, especially not that I got a Bloodied variant!
---
However, I wish the magazine capacity was realistic at 7, or at *least* 6. Then offer an upgrade to 8, which is doable on real life variants (I had googled first heh).
---
Re-chambering (like /u/Anger_Mgmt_issues said) to other common variants like 30-30 and 357 would be extremely welcomed. For ease of implementation, I'd be OK with it just being .38 and .308, where .38 is a little weaker and .308 a little stronger. 
---
To further balance things out, if they DID make the magazine capacity more realistic and with an upgrade...  
---
.45 (default) at 6, with upgrade to 8
---
Could be this, I’ve only done the belle motel twice and by a happy coincidence my base sits just on the edge of the BBQ shack event, so usually triggers when I login, I’ll try to find the third one, cheers
---
Nice shot
---
You making that comment probably just inspired 5 people to build one.
---
Actually seen and recorded something like that in the Burrows.
---
Also Unyielding armor.  If you had a full set, that's +5 STR even at half health.
---
It was the source of my confusion over "Why does everything suck when I'm in Power Armor?"
---
Took me well over 200 tech data before I finally got all the paint jobs. Never found having more than one at a time made a difference in getting the paint to drop. Definitely recommend going to the control room in Monongah power plant if you’re finding less and less tech data at Whitesprings Bunker!
---
If it does happen, prepare for trolls that will run you over.
---
I just call in a supply drop.
---
Thanks for the tip, hopefully I get one soon
---
I've gotten 1 Plan: Shepherd's Crook, 1 Toothed Shepherd's Crook, 1 Horned Shepherd's Crook, 1  Plan: Sheepsquatch Club and 33 Mutton Meat Pie recipes so far...
---
Well.... Shit
---
This is very interesting. There is one other chinese robot mentioned, built to rival Liberty Prime. The propaganda posters show "their warmachine," a chinese clone of liberty prime. The fo76 game files also have the prime model's files if they wanted to put it on a reskinned chinese version.
---
I guess they are using an unstable sorting method.

If you’re on PS4 I’d be happy to paint your T-60 for you!
---
Some idiot of the Xbox forums who scams people, keeps posting to throw it in peoples faces that he scammed them, and his dumb self keeps saying he is cotton eyed Joel. I asked him if his name was actually Joel which he said it wasnt, it was a song. And I told him it was not a song. There is no song about Joel you idiot scammer lol goes to show the intelligence of the scammers on 76.
---
Need to come now, some guy got mad I wouldn't pvp so he found my camp and began blasting everything.  I logged out but he destroyed some costly stuff.  Knowing that moving the base fixes everything without using material I moved it but now cant get it to set up.  Frustrating
---
I appreciate the offer slippy but I'm on XB1
---
We need more Liberator content in general! So yes!
---
Agreed. I’ve lost all respect for him and his opinions. Actually searched and found a blocker so I could make sure I never see his content when I load YT.
---
Nice!
---
M150 is one of the greatest Fallout 4 modders I’ve seen, I’m happy they’re getting featured
---
Yes. Also, right now I can’t even log in. That’s why I came to check if the bullshit is limited to my sphere of experience. 
---
I’m having more blue screens and freezes like you, as well.
---
Where did you see the post?
---
Robots cleaning the parts before using them as material for robot repairs!
---
They previously stated fo76 will never have any kind of mounts as they want us to experience the game at a slow pace. This is also why none of the movement speed increasing perks stack for this purpose. And sadly engine cant handle multiple of us at high speeds.
---
More of the Chinese is Fallout 76 would be very relevant to the lore and give us formidable enemies.
---
Very first thing I thought of! lol second was driving off the bridge...ha!
---
Yep, just had my third and thought I'd check here. Server connection interrupted. 1:1:0.
---
Confirmed, can't get a few play mins between disconnects.
---
I dont get the freezing during the game but the load in delay is worse now. And it's not unusual for the game itself to crash now, where as before it was mainly being disconnected from the server.
---
I got it after 400+ hours it's just rng bro
---
They're not raiders, they're just dicks.
---
Read the post - this was NOT survival mode.
---
Tried one last time, didn’t even move and boom... server disconnect. I’ll try another character but it’s seems that this is a more common issue sadly
---
Not true I got Knight Sargent's paint but I never got the intiates
---
I suppose, I still think I should be able to buy it from the vendor though
---
A Chinese rip-off of liberty prime, named Lenin Prime or Chairman Mao Zebomb
---
I want a nuka wild paint job lol. Also I just want all the nuka cola flavors in the game, especially quartz
---
The Mothman does not approve....
---
Weird, are you implying that someone was WRONG on reddit?!
---
Honestly, I think it's more likely the Chinese used their hacking and reprogramming to steal liberty prime, or at least, one of the prototype iterations, and claim they built it, when really they just repainted it.
---
Exactly! Before this week I had a disconnect here and there, pretty normal that it happens sometimes but the last few days... more blue screens then in the last 2-3 months.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I have tried too yes.
---
Nope the internet and every one on it is always right, we should all learn to believe everything your told with out question
---
All kinds of turrets are basically a doorbell that alert you that something has spawned nearby! The only time they're worth anything is if you have an impenetrable foundation wall!
---
I honestly feel like the rewards screen and legendary pop up screen has been off or buggy for a few days maybe the last three weeks
---
yep, i mainly use pa for crowd control through a rain of .50 bullets, to cripple scorched wings or just to take cool pics XD
---
but i found i enjoy the smaller bonus of herd mentality more, because that i don't have to repair every day. sometimes i even go looting without armor just to enjoy the added risk (and because i'm a maniac when it comes to saving up resources)
---
Yes, same error message for me! Forgot to put it in the post
---
No. Bethesda isn't adding vehicles to Fallout 4, they're highlighting mods people made that add vehicles to Fallout 4. They've highlighted other mods in the past, it has no bearing on the content they'll make for Fallout 76.
---
The TSE will deal more damage if you hit with every pellet, but the spread will be far larger.
---
I know, right?  We want to know what the buzz is all about!
---
I think its a psn issue rather than the game itself
---
Somewhere different on every server!
---
Yawn.
---
If it's one shotting most things then you're not getting much use out of the executioners portion.
---
I managed to get a close up photo of a Mothman near Site Alpha. The effort they made with its design is fantastic
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/xsubvOx
---
I feel like the more I turn in on the same server the better the drops get towards say the 4th or 5th ,.. up to Paladin myself so far
---
I can't say what's happening from personal experience. I jumped up and spammed the quest for two weeks and got them all as soon as the new paints released. BoS role player yo!
---
Wait until May 7th.
---
On Bethesda.net
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/7f3XEI8JoNemrh4SeTLz9f/fallout-4-may-featured-mods
---
Oh that would be amazing, it would be there to get its revenge over all the killing of its children you have done over the course of the game, make it the size of a strikebreaker
---
Oh the Laser SMG, Plasma Caster, Ballistic Fist!
---
Glad to see a happy ending
---
Y’all should get married
---
Yeah I would pay for some natural features, especially if I can use them to cover holes in the foundation.
---
It's still a top end weapon my bro.
---
Nope I’m actually telling the truth and idk about a ban maybe a 2 week suspension and wow I love how instead of really adding to the conversation you instead chose to be a jáck@ass
---
The watoga are plans, and there currently are no plans for X-01 mods.
---
Strategy doesn't matter when your combined DPS of 700+ is literally incapable of dropping the target. I wasn't trying to win once I realized what was happening. I got hits, and was all I needed to make the point that they were unkillable. You can see their health at 0, and there were 3 of us shooting them.
---
The over hype is mostly generated by the community itself. 
---
The community is mostly the problem. Expectations are on us. Best not to have any, just briefly look into upcoming releases. Stop over speculating
---
I didn’t receive a reply so, I’m not so sure.
---
Posidon is often camped by raiders, I'd suggest the other two power plants, they're more out of the way and less frequented!
---
Liberator Prime anyone?
---
Played since launch been really random on the drops
---
Actually they are and when that person comes back again and again then it grows to much more and the free junk..hey just cause it chaps your tail doesn’t mean it isn’t smart
---
Depends on what you like. I love me the quad guns. I've got a TSE pump I'd trade for that.
---
That's an odd one alright
---
I found such a cool area for a CAMP on my alt but after building everything up I later realized the spot had 100% chance of spawning mobs inside of the camp (even inside the house itself) every time I logged in or returned to it. I have max amount of turrets up all elevated and they all just annihilated effortlessly by the frequent spawning low level mobs so not much I can do to prevent it being destroyed all the time.
---
Alright, I’ll trade
---
sorry, i meant the mods for T series that are sold in the vendor in Watoga. I know there arent any plans for X-01 mods in Watoga. Just eddited.
---
But they cant get into the bunker so where do they get them?
---
Interesting concept. I know the player vending will allow you to set prices for items but this is cooler!
---
Ok
---
It doesn't. Handing in 2 just gives slightly more xp and caps. The paint plans are just very low droprate.
---
They lost more in ammo than they gained from my death, it was a dick move since they obviously don't need the materials from the workshop. Since they were obviously so decked out for PvP it was cowardly of them to bait in Adventure.
---
I know it isn't much, but you've gotta consider too that I was doing more damage with each consecutive hit, because 3\* Furious.
---
really ? this makes no sense at all. I mean 5k for T-45 jetpack but 800 for X-01 is way too absurd
---
Cyanide and happiness took the idea for mothman first. They did it better.
---
I see whet you did there.
---
So to paraphrase this entire discussion, don’t you guys have lives?
---
Any other pics/info in it?
---
Seems like the kind of boss they would do in an mmo that was running low on ideas. Just take a preexisting enemy and make him about 5 times bigger and then spend a stupid amount of time hacking away at their feet until they die. I would much rather Bethesda come up with creative wacky ideas for boss enemies rather then just creating bigger meat shields. I do like the Sheepsquach, as an example, because even though he does have a lot of hp he has some unique mechanics and seems like his design was actually thought about. Whereas I don’t really care for the Scorchbeast Queen because she just seems like a buffed up Scorchbeast with nothing else to really offer.
---
Yea that’s what I was afraid of. My bloodied has no issues at all when it comes to pve. I haven’t really pvped much with it. It seems most want to run with sentinel so it seems like my gamma gun gets more use in PvP.

This is the dumbest post of all time. There have been likely billions of stupid posts on the internet, but I'm pretty sure this is the worst one. People are even applauding it, and that's even worse. Not only is just cringey, cosmically even, it's highly sensationalized, something Im assuming you don't like based upon your political comments, and you're telling me you're basing your research off of a fantasy world that happens to be loosely based on a real one? Fuck me, I've lost all hope. And of course you're from the DMV. I wonder how many times your Honda Accord has nearly caused an accident right next to me.
---
I can never seem to find the event as of late.  I even tried server hopping many times but no luck.
---
Maybe just do your own thing then?
---
You sure you didn’t accidentally drop it? I’ve been playing since bet and have never had this happen
---
Yeah, dude fires it off and he looks Raiden from Mortal Kombat...a very pissed off Raiden.
---
2 posts from 2 different people on the same subject only an hour apart? What sorcery is this?
---
i found holo tapes if thats what you mean but what i havent found is NPCs like in previous fallout titles that give me a reason to keep searching. Im glad you like holo stories I mean tapes thats good for you. Im looking for a fallout multiplayer experience not a multiplayer experience in a fallout setting.
---
I have about 12 of each check my vending machine next week
---
Nah, I got the knight and then knight captain. You don't need to get them in any particular order.
---
I think the paint jobs are #2 and #4, I could be wrong about that, but I don't think they even drop in order.
---
The legendary trader is a mole miner
---
It's a shame that majority of people I run into in-game don't have a camera yet. I've had some randoms help me with challenges requiring pics with other players and they never have camera themselves yet for me to help them complete it as well.
---
It sucks having to re-do the quest on alts too. :s
---
The Chinese Assault Rifle is technically in game, in a way. I mean, while datamining I saw there ARE a couple files for it; however, after I thought about it and looked at how the CAR looked in FO3 I realized that it's alive in 76 as a Barrel for the Handmade :P It's either the Short, or the Medium barrel, that present with the CAR's hand grip.   
---
\[/fun fact\] 
---
I'd also like more options, not because I'd particularly use any of them but just because it's a shame (and not fair, really) that they've taken out so many things with FO4/76 versus what was in FO3. I mean NV I understand the lack of implementation, since it wasn't "their" game, and frankly (unfortunately), I don't expect Bethesda to acknowledge NV and utilize any of those assets. It's canon, but that's as far as I can see them going with it. 
---
I'd like the Gauss from FO3 back, but with some small tweaks to the model/animation to make some design aspects less of a head-scratcher.   
---
And since I'd love for a Gatling Gauss (I believe it was in FO2), despite not expecting it'd become a thing, I'd settle for an Automatic Gauss. Which that'd be a good use of the original Gauss design then :)
---
The Alien gun in 76 is indeed a total let down, and I hope it's only this way currently because they have some big plan for it with a long quest, unlocking more mods and so forth.
---
A .45 ala M1911 that can be converted to Full Auto (obviously it'd be inaccurate as hell and rely on *"spray and pray"*) could easily work and fits with the game considering there's the Thompson SMG. 
---
Naturally, the Anti-Material Rifle would be great.
---
Riot Shotgun is just the Combat Shotgun with a drum, which we have. Brush Gun is Lever Action in different caliber (I commented elsewhere in the thread addressing that).   
---
As for the rest (not that I wouldn't welcome them all), IMO: 5.56 Pistol and Bozar are just... well, absurd lol 9mm SMG/Pistol and Chinese Pistol would be superfluous given the .38 Pipe Pistol, 10mm Pistol and 10mm SMG are all capable of filling that void. Not sure the Service Rifle offers much in comparison to the Combat Rifle and Assault Rifle, beyond being a different model.
---
The Dragon is its name. Its like Grognak's axe. It has a name like its a unique, but its a regular drop.
---
There’s a prompt the comes up everytime with names weapons. I’m positive I didn’t drop it.
---
Thankyou! I blew a good 10 film trying to get it to register, but this finally did it.
---
I believe the number of dead bodies may increase the speed in which they turn to piles. At least in my experience - a few random dead scorched along the road will stay for a while, but if I’ve just killed 10 of ‘em in one room they turn to piles much faster. It’s probably to keep large piles of bodies from bogging things down.
---
Drop your socks and grab your socks... haha never heard that before.
---
Whats the stats on it?
---
What about transferring into a world container?
---
Mod of jet pack from Modus at WS is about 450 with hard bargain. I bought two over the last month.
---
One time I initiated a fight with a Mothman, and he fought until I took a bit more than half his health, then he fled like a lil bitch
---
Moth man- "I'm old Greg"
---
Would love to see custom holotapes, it’s good to see 76 starting to find its feet but there’s a huge list of features that the game needs. Simple in game emotes can only go so far in most situations if you don’t have a mic.
---
But, yeah, there are no plans.
---
When I realized I had 18 power cores at level 15 I decided to use them up to free up stash space. I'm now 145+ and have 68 on me. I don't even pick them up from frames or power stations it's just from what I loot from bodies. And I've been running pa since level 15
---
Yeah one other that was new

this is bringing me flashbacks to that time a bunny kept taking my workshops! WAS IT YOU!?!?
---
I hope their first single is about mining cookies a Gotham prostitutes ass.
---
yes we have always known that but before we where only given art, now we have a model to see.
---
Broken arms.
---
Still available?
---
A multiplayer focused game requires other players to do some events?? (Surprised pikachu face)
---
I know what pacifist means and the rules that it entails. Slap damage was completely removed, btw. My problem is that at full pvp damage, with a weapon dealing 160+ damage per shot (and more with each hit), IN ADDITION to whatever damage my friends were doing, he remained at 0% health hit after hit, and we could not kill him.
---
If you don’t want to take a workshop just do Collision Course event in Morgantown.  When the cargo or lands with the supply crate it’s within camera detection range.
---
I hear you on that. There have been times when I play and attempt these events and no one else shows up. But this is usually during the day for me. I am in EST time zone.  
---
However, when I play at night I find that you see higher level people who will jump at the chance to do both these events. So I think it really boils down to when you attempt to do them.  But I guess it can also depend on who is on the server at the time too.
---
I found mine eventually at Bolton Greens next to the dead Raider on the fountain or whatever the circle thing in front of it was.
---
Babushka
---
Make that 6.
---
Sure add me please, I will change character for help.
---
be prepared for people telling you that you're lying and just trying to smear Fo76's "good name".
---
are you on PC or consoles? can you describe what happened exactly? like, you logged in and it was gone? but it was still on you before you last logged out?
---
TIRE ARMOR ROAD WARRIORRRRR
---
Yes, and the problem being nobody else bothers. That's my point.
---
I was already doing that. Now they wait until after you take it over then when the mini event to defend it against waves of whatever starts they use the event to fast travel right to the workshop while you're distracted.
---
I got a plan for an MIRV something and an Auto Grenade Launcher along with one of those, for what it's worth
---
No, just no. You do the quests to unlock more story, especially once more end game story comes out for all your characters so you are just wrong. Its not "easier" because not being able to customize my camp doesn't make fighting hordes harder. Anyone can give their alts anything they need so your point is void
---
I'm sure I'm late to the party, but why stack them?
---
Lenin Prime wouldn't really work.
---
Maoism is a completely different ideology from Leninism and was aimed at a different kind of worker.
---
imagine calling shotgun on a power armor user, not able to walk or run around, but acting as a secondary gunner
---
I swear if they put a giant liberator in the game because of this post, I will hunt you down lol I hate liberators
---
so how'd it go?
---
Really an inevitable flaw for most as-a-service games. Some even weaponize it to create a fear of missing out and pull players back. (Or inadvertently push them away).
---
&gt; Seems like the kind of boss they would do in an mmo that was running low on ideas. Just take a preexisting enemy and make him about 5 times bigger and then spend a stupid amount of time hacking away at their feet until they die.
---
So every Destiny boss in the entire series is due to a lack of creativity?
---
I was just going for the communist reference more than anything lol
---
As for replayability, removing fun aspects from a game you have 300+ hours in reduces replayability because it is boring work made tedious by rng
---
4x powered gear? What’s that? I Would love a quick AP regen
---
I was just thinking this yesterday. I'd love to have a room at the resort.
---
For mobs of bugs, try using a Tesla Rifle.
---
It’s possible that whoever you bought it off of, either duped it or purchased it from a duper. Bethesda deleted a bunch of duped items a while back. I’m fairly sure that they still monitor activity occasionally.
---
"contracted"
---
On a separate note, I really wish we could wear the Red Star pins that Liberators drop.
---
Since the Chinese were supposed to be infiltrating the US, it would be nice to have some Chinese inspired stuff.
---
I hesitate doing events that pop up I don't know the info on.  Does it take several people to succeed?  Do I need PA?  A close range weapon or rifle?  Etc.  
---
I wish there were short descriptions under the event when you click on it to join.  I think more people would participate.
---
I can't stand how you sell something in a menu and the list slightly resorts itself. So annoying
---
Replace the s in socks with a c. That's how I know it.
---
I don't have outfit, but if you got one I will happily wear it and pose, cause I need that challenge too.
---
Dramatic\_Prophet
---
Sure
---
But there are counters to Sentinel build—stagger, VATS crit.  If you would have staggered him first he would die.   And since he was bloodied you could also irradiate him.
---
I got The Dragon from one and a few plans, otherwise just odds and ends. There's a bunch of sites that show the locations so I just took a day and went around cashing them in. The nice part is there's no cooldown so if you have five of the same one you can just keep digging and get 5 sets of loot right away.
---
Most Marylanders are fucking stupid, so that makes sense. I'd say I run into an intelligent person here, roughly every 7 years.
---
Gonna need it back though
---
It looks cool 😎
---
If you can afford to buy a 1.5million dollar ~~house~~ castle, you can probably afford the associated costs.
---
Lmao I see now, this sub doesn’t allow that sort of talk?
---
Imalso surprised by the amout of beaker stands that end up in the laundary there too! To be honest I've never actually seen a fucking beaker stand in my whole like and then bang! Washing machines appear on the horizon. .I also love the way this universe has robots, hovercopters, computers, highly advanced pharmaceuticals and nuclear powered cars but still use Victorian technology to stay in touch....
---
is this super rare or something?
---
Sounds intriguing
---
And make sure you use the dromedary perk card too. Helps a bunch.

Just buy the rewards off reddit or LFG for the imposter outfits, much easier to earn caps than do them. The imposter event is basically impossible solo although I read a few did it with some serious gear, but I can't imagine it been that fun. You probably need quite a few people around 6 to really complete the event if they have the right gear and know how to play.
---
The Free Range event I did solo in the mire location with little difficulty .. I think mainly because the brahmin stay near you, the one at Fred's BBQ might be trickier as the brahmin venture off and get attacked by other creatures. 
---
I built a base near the end of the vent with 10 missile and heavy laser turrets to help me out and the cannon if I remember to use it, I think eventually people will get bored and as you said already stopped showing up, most of the ones I attended always have people so it is a hit or miss. I am going to try solo it tonight to see how it goes if no one shows up, but so far am enjoying it.
---
People need to protect the brahmin .. it could be the more people the more enemies .. doing it solo might be possible .. when two sheepsquatches show up, it does get busy.
---
Just to add to the list.
---
- Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun
---
- Plasma Caster
---
- R91 Assault Rife
---
- Arc Welder
---
- Bumper Sword
---
- Ballistic Fist
---
- Yao Guai Gauntlet 
---
- Tesla Cannon
---
- Sniper Rifle from Fallout 3 [semi auto, not bolt action]
---
- Pipe Shotgun
---
Some new original stuff would be cool.  A heavy pipe machine gun would be cool.
---
I'm remembering that Fallout 4 had inns. But I guess we can't have too many inns without any NPCs...
---
I thought they just reduced any count above 1, down to 1?   
---
I'm pretty sure two of my guns are of sketchy background, but they've never been taken from me. TSE Lever Action and TSE Handmade.
---
Lots at top of the world, surveyor and letter outfits all count, I am sure the explorer outfit will work as well, also masks up there if no one has taken them .. 2nd level
---
Overseer's Mission (!) quest is still bugged.
---
Damn, Fallout 4 quests still bugged.
---
I hear you. This morning I saw some jackhole with a 2400 bounty and knew I should have logged off, but I'd already put about a hundred bullets into a sheepsquatch. Got done, and he'd flattened my base and killed my pet deathclaw. I fixed it (except for the deathclaw), not knowing he was still in the area. He went after it immediately. Logged out before he got more than a couple of walls.
---
I have stagger with One Gun Army.
---
no extra XP in survival mode?
---
I’m not 100% sure what they did. I believe for the duper’s, they got rid of it all and left them one weapon. I’m not sure about those who were victims of buying items from them. I bought my tse gauss the day prior for 5k and was almost certain it was going to be deleted. Just seemed like it was sold to cheap.
---
I want the suit Pulowski wore in the commercials as well just to complete the snake oil salesman motif haha
---
PA unarmed is pretty useless. Just use something like a super sledge in Blast zones. Even without the slugger perks it'll do decent enough damage with 15 strength.
---
What's the difference between this and people just taking your workshop to start a fight?
---
I'm very curious what all the locked houses are for around the perimeter. Most are card or hand print locked iirc, and are inaccessible?
---
And weathervanes!
---
they are still under renovation, according to the bots
---
powered is the affix "Faster AP Refresh"
---
Yes the one in the savage divide I just failed on.
---
I was fine up until the sheepsquatches spawned. they were both level 80, and I managed to clear out the half dozen or so bugs before going for them. But a ton more spawned and literally destroyed the brahmin instantly.
---
I mean its just a shame nobody else bothers to turn up for events. Its especially disappointing when there is unique rewards involved.
---
Serious question: are these plans any good? If I am a melee guy are any of those likely to be better than what I already use? 
---
When I go to vendors I see plans for all kinds of weapons and they all look like trash. If I scrap every .44 I pick up, why would I buy a plan and build one? Same for all these random leather armor plans I find. 
---
Can you sell the items you make at a profit? What am I missing?
---
Thanks so much!!!
---
Yes! Weathercocks! (Because I am easily amused :P )
---
That's sweet
---
That’s cute asf
---
Yea I wish they had some plans you could find for different pre decorated shelves, like “kitchen supplies”  with some pans and stuff on it or a “food shelf” with veggies and food boxes any themed shelf like your garage could have a “maintenance” shelf with tools, paint, and such.
---
I was sad that you couldn't explore the castle too much in game. I have family in Berkely Springs and I spent a large amount of time there as a kid (grew up 20 min away in PA) I was shocked you didnt include the star theater, its almost as big a landmark as the castle, I dont remember seeing the roman baths that George Washington bathed in either (Berkeley Springs used to he called Bath I believe).
---
At least as it concerns Fissure Site Prime, you just need a considerate bomber who leaves Drop Site V9 out of the blast radius... which you *really* should do if you want to drop the SBQ quickly.
---
Not keeping the workshop as is my usual experience, they purposely left it unowned to wait for the next batch of players, whom would assume it to be free game.
---
I used to use a death tambourine and it was great.  I believe it takes advantage of both iron fist and gladiator perks as well for huge damage!
---
*turn around turn around*
---
If that was hint for me, I disagree. All life improving perks are waste of perk points. All you need is defensive and offensive perks that helps you survive. Perks like strong back, thru hiker, dromedary, cola nut, have no place in my build. Food and water is everywhere in the game.
---
Hopefully they can be unlocked in a future update
---
They are not unkillable, my PvP character would drop them in 1 second with how they were playing. You just need to read the advice people are giving you on this thread, I believe one guy mentioned stagger for you since you’re a heavy gunner. Get one gun army perk(luck) then unload on him with that Gatling plasma with the splitter mod, see if he doesn’t drop in a few seconds.
---
Thank you very much for the help.   Your awesome.
---
I finally got it, someone told me to stand to the right of the statue and take a photo of the school and it worked.
---
Aw, the vendor is so pretty :3
---
Neck beards in moms basement with a bowl of Cheetos bro....what else do they have to do?
---
I view diseases as benefits thanks to one of my mutations, so "gained" is fine with me.
---
You literally just took an opinion and said it was wrong. That's hilarious and sad at the same time.
---
Built a base to help you out .. people get bored quickly .. and the rewards aren't super exciting ... like I wouldn't bother with the burrows again ... going to farm the the free range for fun .. I will take a video, it built it yesterday and worked well, looking to see how the artiliary adds to the fun .. I prefer less people seems easier .. for the imposter outfits, bought 2 for 5K and 1 for 3.5K, they out there, just buy them while it is new or wait for better deals ..
---
Oh? Did I miss a mutation?
---
I already told those people, and apparently I have to again, that I have one gun army. It obviously didn't help
---
That would be awesome. I took a 2 month break from the game and missed that event. My username is also same as Reddit so add me on PSN if you happen to find one in your stash.
---
So something I just figured out (literally this week) is if you click on an item in the shop you can actually scroll through pictures of female and male characters wearing the item before you buy it 😊  
---
Helped me with a decision or two this week already lol
---
...which point? I've listed the cons of both options here
---
The equating of '*couldn't cut it in Survival'* to '*They still take workshops in Adventure'* is baffling. If I want to farm Aid items, I go to Survival. If I want to farm caps and junk, I go to Adventure mode. These things are not mutually exclusive.
---
Regardless, if someone falls for a trap this complicated then I say good on the raider. Most workshops go unattended no matter what infrastructure has been laid down.
---
I also fail to understand how PvP is being "***forced***" on someone that has to volunteer to take the workshop in the first place. 
---
Let's look at the facts:
---
Adventure mode is generally more populated, therefore more potential targets are present and they are visible on the map under most circumstances.
---
Workshop PvP favors the aggressor, since they have to challenge workshops to toggle PvP.
---
Adventure mode rewards are 4x those in Survival, plus junk hoarder tendencies are higher in Adventure Mode.
---
You do not risk losing aid items (particularly Stealth Boys) when dying in Adventure Mode PvP.
---
Workshops are claimed more frequently in Adventure mode, as there are more fusion core, ammo and food processing farmers lumbering about in their Excavator armor. 
---
The risk of dying in Adventure mode by a would-be Raider and losing caps is offset by two factors: 
---
**1)** You will generally kill more than you are killed if you're outfitted for it and taking advantage of all of the Adventure mode freebies, so the caps gamble is minimal. 
---
**2)** The Raider can stop their assault at any time with no recourse due to either the use of Pacifist Mode or Respawning instead of Seeking Revenge if they are killed.
---
There is essentially nothing in Survival (outside of aid items) that you can't get more of in Adventure mode (unless they change things).
---
That's not all to say that Survival doesn't have its benefits. It's a great place to die frequently with almost no penalty, test builds out and kill time. It's also more expensive because the returns on ammo and items like Stealth Boys are a risky proposition. I don't necessarily think that the list above speaks to ***GOOD*** design on behalf of our Bethesdan Overlords, but those are the rules we have. If players were incentivized to play other ways or more exclusively in Survival, they would.
---
nice aim!
---
Crit Savvy. When I swap to a combo build of rifles/shotguns I use 2 ranks of Four Leaf Clover, 3 Crit Savvy and 1 of Better Criticals.
---
On console, Xbox. I was at whitesprings looking at an outfit I just bought standing next to a trader bot. Some guy came up to me and hit causing my electric charge mutation to agro the bots so they would shoot at me. I server hopped, saw a bohemoth as I left whitesprings, went to equip my gun and it wasn’t there. I know I didn’t sell it or drop it because I have it named so it prompts you before doing any such action.
---
Thank you too. I thought it was imosible for today challenge :)
---
I've got two 3\* brass knuckles I can get up to around 600+ damage per hit with my bloodied/unyielding setup. Can also perk out for a shotgun. Its a fun combo.
---
Since power armor is basically useless outside of nuke zones, you should be aware that first weapons are absolutely stellar. With the right perks, and mutations you can be a massive powerhouse, even without the bloodied build making you a glass cannon. Invest in some vanguard combat armor, with weight reduction legendary perks on it, and you'll literally never use power armor outside of a nuke again, and you'll probably grow to love that powerfist. I run an AA combat knife, and no PA, and I have better defense than PA, and carry more without the armor due to having very specific weight reduction stats on my armor, and I never really regret it. I can use whatever weapon I want, and don't need batteries to run my defenses, so life is good. Look for the Twisted Muscles mutation, and Talons. For defense, Grounded, and Scaley Skin help to make PA a thing of the past.
---
Man that’s a shame if that’s the case. How are you supposed to know if it’s duped or not before purchasing? Now I’m out 3k caps and great gun.
---
Were we on xbox?
---
That’s really sweet, i only have mules.
---
Yes, the same problem for me
---
Just difficult to find. The body can spawn ~20 different places. Myself it took 9 different locations and about 2hrs to find today (mainly because I can't fast travel)
---
I got one build unarmed and I don’t use PA ever except blast zones. When going to blast zone, just PA gives you enough strength to use two handed melee. Also you know you will go there just swap the perks quickly and you set for high damage.
---
That’s what I pretty much said but shrugged my shoulders. You can’t fix the problem if you don’t target it as a whole. I’d be ok losing the weapon for the sake of server stability.
---
I just don't like that I have to trade to get the rewards. That's not fun to me. I like to earn stuff in game.
---
The rewards seem cool to me, I dunno, itl be nice to have new melee weapons. Im not too concerned with the imposter stuff, though it would of been nice to of got the fixer plans.
---
I actually really enjoy the burrows. To me its a fun little dungeon to clear out for some xp and caps. Something easy solo to switch off to and relax I guess.
---
Thank you. :)
---
You're welcome. :)
---
What's a sheepsquatch shard? That doesn't sound like something you craft, but something you find in a field.
---
Possibly with mushrooms growing on it...
---
there are reports of named weapons disappearing. don't do it.
---
Sadly there's just like a 7.14% chance to get it per technical data you turn in. *Theoretically*, you should be getting a paint job around every 14 documents you turn in, but you know how RNG is.
---
I’ll add you now, I’m about an hour away from being able to check.
---
You do know the majority of players aren't on reddit.   They won't be charging 50k for a tse.
---
how often do you run into a female miner who also works as a weapons dealer on the side? there’s gotta be some insider joke behind it.
---
I don’t even have mules, just the occasional friend I met on f76 that plays
---
Ah cool, now I just need people to bother turning up to the event....
---
Ah got it. There are still a few I don’t know
---
Damn I didn’t know that. That’s a shame too.
---
More of a hint for noobs - I’m really crap at gaming and took a long time getting to grips with carrying enough water to not die of thirst every 20mins! I’m only on level 82 and gave played every day for 5hrs+ since the BETA. I think I’m a slow learner - I’ll have to get to grips with builds someday.  I’ve only been through FO4 twice, and that took me over a year!
---
I want my cowboy hat to be legendary
---
You didn't see anything, got it??
---
I think just the total lack of human character interactions is a lot. It does give you that feel of being a lone wanderer, but I miss it quite a bit. I find myself searching the map for other players that are new and searching them out to give them gift bags, but the companions were really my favorite. Even Dogmeat made it feel a little more like home. Now I know why Tom Hanks needed Wilson.
---
So you dont have to run all the way back to the camp just to get the same boring stuff
---
It's the same with my tse combat shotgun but you're point is made.
---
Oh is that a crafted item? Didn't know, neat
---
How do you know when you are below %20 health?
---
Ya
---
Having plans shared character wide
---
If you struggle with that nukes and dragons is good too :)
---
I'm looking forward to them even though I think having them at our camps is a stupid idea. 
---
Everybody was sick of wasting time and caps fast traveling around to a half dozen different faction vendors so Beth put them all in one spot so we could take care of them all in one stop and get on with playing the game. So why not put all the player vending in one convenient spot too instead of spread across the map?
---
A TSE handmade at 3k caps is a nice deal, save up the caps for two to three days, contact the seller and get another one.
---
Lol XPat high lvls is pointless XP after lvl 50 is pointless
---
The backlash is so unnecessary honestly people just dont have time to play the game through 5 times and learn 1000+plans on all characters
---
It's a hassle
---
You on pc? Trade ya one if you can find me a union hat
---
The game really needs more energy weapons, wouldn't mind seeing watz laser snipers, Tesla cannons, or even the plasma caster.  
---
Infact do to the plasma cells, the plasma caster would fit perfectly as a DPH weapon.
---
I'm having constant disconnects and errors signing into the server atm.
---
Wow you are completely delusional. Please try making your own dungeon this weekend for us. Take a month if you have to. We’ll compare with the burrows and have a good laugh.
---
I tried to make my character a$ap yams if you know him
---
Is that a new bug? I played with recon primarily and never remember it not working when scoped.
---
Just for curiosity, can the staff and club heard the sheep? I would guess not, but kinda cool if it works.
---
I wanted to put out there what Bethesda could do to help the CAP economy and see if this idea sticks. From the video you shown to just thinking about it. I wanted to get other peoples thoughts.  
---
**Idea 1:**  
---
Spend CAPs for Atoms. From the video I thought I saw where it explained making real world currency can help keep a games economy in check. So maybe 100 CAPs = 1 Atom. So then with 25000 CAPs = 250 Atom I believe you could by some of the newer Smaller Atom Shop Items.   
---
**Idea 2:**  
---
On the CAP Sink idea. Why not charge 1000 CAPs to go from Survival server back to Adventure Server. This might cause people not to bounce so much between the two servers. May cause some people to pick a server and stay in it. I know it is just 1K CAPs. I feel like mostly higher level players go to survival server. Higher level players have more CAPs than the average lower level person.   
---
With this idea I don't think they should charge for people to go to the survival server. It should be free to enter but cost to leave.   
---
Just some ideas. I hope some of you all look at this and let me know where my thoughts are flawed.   
---
Thanks for your time.

"That gun" the blade runner replica
---
Submit a ticket and say you bought it by accident.
---
That’s been the case for me since like patch 6, but I don’t use it often. Do you use the scope or the x-01 helmet mod?
---
1) PS4?     2) how much lol
---
Would be nice if they will sell mods. There was a mod for Fallout 4 that turned legendary effects into an attachable mod so it is possible to do it. Will Bethesda do it? Probably not.
---
5k is the price for the plan, you buy the plan then craft your own T series jetpack. But there’s no plan for x01 and mods anywhere so you just need to check MODUS from time to time, it’s only a few hundred caps.
---
Stronger throwing knives with a poison effect I believe
---
Not sure how people are finding themselves not taking considerably more damage and repair upkeep while not wearing PA. Even with some of the perks it's immediately noticable with similar or even higher resistance values from my experience.
---
I travel with my wife too. She helped me design my bar.
---
From what I can gather,  some are able to turn a profit,  but guns are iffy as you’ll need the screws and gears for your usual gear too.
---
Armor is the best bet for cap craft,  the leathers can turn a small profit but.  The MTH is still the way to go there.
---
Yeah lol thank you for saying this.
---
I'll have to keep that in mind
---
Same, and I never had a problem with losing turrets.
---
Came here to say just this ^
---
Been getting the same thing for about the last hour.
---
I’ve suggested this too, thermal and make nights darker. Right now the night is bright as day there’s no need for the green tint fake IR.
---
You can get into the bunker by progressing the Enclave quest line to a certain point. That questline is separate and independent from the BoS one that causes Technical Data to convert into quest items and trigger the Forbidden Knowledge repeatable quest. Technical Data also spawns at many other locations within the world too, not just within the Enclave Bunker.
---
Yes, I tried to but it said it doesn't support on micro transaction went on PS4, instead ask Sony about it. Looks quite hopeless but I should give it a try
---
Someone needs to use the friend list more.
---
I'm thinking this too.
---
Curious - which outfits count as raider clothing?
---
This is what this game is about. Amazing story.
---
Difficult when none of your friends play Fallout 76
---
Thank you- that did it for me also after a lot of frustration.
---
I do the same thing but couple it with incisor, destroys Mr.Gutsies
---
I think this used to be the case, but has stopped working for me. I think they stealth fixed it. Unless maybe it still just works for the Death Tambo.
---
The scope. Distinctly remember seeing the little icons pop on when I was zoomed in. Haven't played in a couple months though.
---
Well said!
---
Have you seen how to make curtains?
---
Upload to imgur, post link
---
Yes mate at the beginning it’s bit harder to keep hydrated a fed, it’s ok  for ppl just exploring and playing in Pve to use those perks, but in PvP you just need every single perk point to help survive the battle.
---
North East of the munitions factory
---
The robots didn't kick anyone out, all the quests and staff are still there. Just check the dumpsters near the service entrance.
---
Make new friends. Play the game as intended by the devs.
---
There’s what — 24 players to a single server? Plenty of rooms for anyone who wants one. I know I’d check-in.
---
I know it's a shot in the dark, but if you're on PC, I just found him. Feel free to join.
---
They're not meant for solo play. The eyebombs/bloatflies need a gun fu VATS rifle/pistol/shotgun user to take out quickly before they cause problems. The imposter/real sheepsquach is best handled by melee/heavy gunners in power armor. You're supposed to cooperate with other players (like the game tells you over and over to do) to get it done.
---
No one showing up to those events is very strange. I have *never* seen either of those events with less than 5 players present. What system/timezone are you?
---
Yeah I think I've got incisor, absolute must, and martial artist just for kicks
---
Thank you for clarifying and goodbye Reddit
---
Gas Mask Man?
---
Stealth helps a lot for not taking damage and also not taking armor damage. Plus barbarian, evasive, serendipity, blocker, dodgy, fire proof. Even as a bloodied/unyielding build I can tank just fine for most encounters.
---
The wing on this metal armor is because it is heavy. It has nothing to do with the legendary effects, it’s simply the weight of the armor.
---
I saw Mothman today for the first time, I started a new character on a different plattform (PC), so I'm still a low level and was fighting some fat monster. He was standing on a bridge just watching me. He was lvl 35, so waay to high for me. At first I was like wtf is that, suuper creepy, but I had to kill that monster first. I have it recorded, when I approached him, he just flew off. It's probably the creepiest thing I've ever seen in a Fallout game.
---
"Couples that play together, stay together" or something to that effect.
---
Perhaps after a SBQ you can amend it to "Couples that slay together, stay together!"
---
At any rate, cool picture. 😄
---
Same issue for me. On at least my tenth disconnect of the evening and now I'm getting a cannot claim token error and unable to play at all.
---
Helped a lot! Seems I didn’t realize there is both metal armor AND heavy metal armor.
---
Got it! Thank you
---
Put down a small rug, place the smaller water purifier on the edge of the rug, move the rug onto another rug, place it anywhere you want. Also works with fruits/veggies if you want them inside or on a table.
---
Ah ok. Like at E3 when Todd Howard said you can play the game solo etc. When did he state that some events absolutely require multiple people? Which event then would be fine if others bothered to actually play events.....
---
I used Raider Leathers(underwear) as outfit and Sack Hood with Straps as hat.
---
Hi I made quick quote for Lone Wanderers check it out, it will help you hopefully with the Free Range event.

I do know this. Do you miss my point on purpose?
---
Wow great idea! I just have a lazier mindset
---
I'm level 42, is it to late to start working on this build? Like for example I have like 9 points in perception and in our build you only have 3? Is this where Respec comes into play?
---
Same here, they said it’s fixing a bug but really it’s a nerf. My shotguns do way less damage after the TSE nerf, now they simply want to nerf them more.
---
Lol bye
---
Yeah that’d be why, it started a couple months ago... patch 6 or 7
---
at 131 days you should have more than 5 karma. that’s why karma minimums are in place cause otherwise people who troll/waste ppls time would just shitpost all day
---
Give em a flamer and you have Pyro.
---
Two things metal grain silos and all those houses with red stars on them.
---
One of these days the entire map will come alive.
---
And your last statement is also very strange. I have never had 5 players on the free range event, and the only time I have had more then that on Imposter is the first couple of days it was out.
---
timezones doesn't matter, everytime I play its a full server.
---
Grimreaprincess :)
---
Dang, Xbox player here. Thank for replying!
---
Plague walker, its fun
---
Harpers ferry is the new whitespring, there is not much reasons to bomb it now
---
id have to be in the moment but ive heard that before
---
Fun stuff *wink wink nudge nudge*
---
#MothmanMondays ?
---
I cannot say that I am. I enjoy them.
---
Yeah! Well, best of luck. Yeah? She's pretty shy herself, and can relate to anxiety.
---
I asked, because I've never seen those events empty. I play on PC though, so it might be different on other systems.
---
*Ready for Titanfall!*
---
Most of those perks work with PA and the resistance you gain from the ones that don't barely do anything.
---
I've encountered the Sheepsquatch twice at the random encounter spawn just south of Hopewell Cave along the road (towards Sons of Dane compound). Not a guaranteed spawn but pretty easy to server hop that place if you do that sort of thing.
---
Can't ever imagine it happening.
---
Thank you but im on console... where did you find him/her?
---
She watched me play through FO4 many times, opting to skip movies or other activities, and instead, be my co driver. Now, she has her own Xbox and setup. It's my turn to bring her drinks and help her find quest items.
---
+karma 
---
That worked - thank you so much!
---
If you have a chameleon armor piece you don't show up on the map. Find a good place to sit and if someone comes to steal, you blast them into the ground. Worked for me and I waited to get 50 fusion cores and a few hundred crystal at Thunder Mt.

I logged in to Fallout 76 today and found that two of my legendary items were missing, All Rise, The Perfect Storm, The Eye of Ra, and the Garb of Mysteries. All the items except the All Rise were rewards for completing quests. I tried to go back and re-complete the quest, but the game will not let me. Can anyone tell me how do I get back the missing items? The items were in my inventory before this latest update. Is there a way to contact Bethesda directly and ask about this issue. If this is a bug, how do the heck we get our items back?
---
Wavy Willy's parking lot.
---
I noticed issues with the VTU courtyard photo too, would not register.  I’m also stuck at 9/10 players for the weekly challenge, can not get that one to complete for the life of me.
---
Seems highly suspect that the currency you can ‘win’ in the game is bugged out so bad, but dunno if this is malice or just incompetence.
